<text>James Kenneth Irving (March 20, 1928 – June 21, 2024) was a Canadian billionaire businessman and the first of three sons in the Irving family born to industrialist K.C. Irving. Born in Saint John, New Brunswick, he was the owner and later chairman of J. D. Irving. By the time of his death, his net worth was estimated between $5.5 and $7.2 billion.

== Early life ==
James Kenneth Irving was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, on March 20, 1928, the first of three sons born to K. C. Irving and his wife, Harriet Lila Irving (), from Galloway in Kent County. He was educated at Rothesay Netherwood School, a private school in the nearby town of Rothesay.

== Career ==
Beginning in 1957, Irving&#x27;s work in forestry had led to the planting of over a billion trees. Following K. C.&#x27;s death in 1992, ownership and responsibility for the Irving companies was divided amongst his sons, James, Arthur and Jack.

Irving assumed ownership and responsibility of the J. D. Irving conglomerate, which included ownership of several companies in multiple different fields, including logging, frozen foods, transportation and retail. He owned the Brunswick News publishing company until selling in 2022 to Postmedia, the publisher of major newspapers in New Brunswick, including the &quot;Telegraph-Journal&quot;, the &quot;Times &amp; Transcript&quot; and &quot;The Daily Gleaner&quot;. He later served as J.D. Irving&#x27;s chairman.

In 2000, Irving established the Partners Assisting Local Schools (PALS) program to work with local schools and &quot;give children unique learning opportunities...to break the cycle of poverty for youth living in low-income neighborhoods through academic achievement and the school environment&quot;. In 2004, he co-chaired a $25 million fundraising campaign for the Université de Moncton along with Denis Losier. By the time of Irving&#x27;s death, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth at $5.5 billion, while the &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot; guessed $7.2 billion.

==Personal life and death==
Irving was married to philanthropist Jean E. Irving until her death in 2019; they had been married for 69 years. They had four children, Jim Jr., Robert, Mary Jean and Judy.

Irving died in Saint John on June 21, 2024, at the age of 96. He was the last of K. C. Irving&#x27;s sons. His younger brother Arthur died a month earlier. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called him &quot;a symbol of Canadian entrepreneurship and philanthropy&quot;.

== Awards ==
Irving received a honorary doctorate from the Université de Moncton in 1989, for business administration. In November 2007, he was inducted into the 2008 Canadian Business Hall of Fame along with his two brothers.

In 2014, Irving received the Order of New Brunswick. In 2015, he received the Order of Canada, which described him as a &quot;corporate leader who has advanced economic development in rural and urban New Brunswick&quot;.

In 2016, Irving and Shirley Dysart were made Rotary International&#x27;s Paul Harris Fellows for creating PALS. In 2017, he won the Honorary Leader Award at the Diversity Champion Awards, organized by Pride of Race, Unity and Dignity through Education, an organization based in Saint John.

<text>The University of Albuquerque was a Catholic liberal arts university in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which opened in 1920 and closed in 1986. Its former campus on Albuquerque&#x27;s West Side now houses St. Pius X High School.

==History==
The institution was founded in 1920 as St. Francis Summer College. Located at St. Anthony&#x27;s Orphanage, the college was operated by the Poor Sisters of St. Francis Seraph and offered continuing education classes for nuns during the summer. In 1940, it was taken over by the Archdiocese of Santa Fe and chartered as a full-time college called the Catholic Teachers&#x27; College of New Mexico, offering four-year programs in arts, sciences, and education. The college moved to a new location at the former Rio Grande Industrial School campus on South 2nd Street in 1946, and control was handed back to the Poor Sisters the following year. In 1950, the college changed its name to the College of St. Joseph on the Rio Grande and broke ground on a new campus atop a bluff overlooking the Rio Grande on Albuquerque&#x27;s West Side. Classes began at the new location in 1951, encompassing a full liberal arts curriculum. The campus was formally dedicated by Archbishop Edwin Byrne in 1952.

During the 1950s and 1960s, enrollment grew steadily to more than 1,000 students and the college completed a gymnasium, arts and theater buildings, and dormitories. In 1960, it gained regional accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. By 1965, the college had 65 faculty members and offered a full liberal arts curriculum as well as pre-professional and graduate programs. In 1966, the name was changed to the University of Albuquerque, and a new student center was completed in 1967. However, by 1968 the university was in financial trouble and was forced to cut some of its departments and staff. Costs were further reduced in 1969 by cutting all intercollegiate athletic programs.

Under Frank Kleinhenz, its first lay president, the university reorganized its operations in the 1970s by relaxing admissions requirements and putting more emphasis on two-year and certificate programs in order to boost enrollment. This strategy was successful and the university reported a record 3,200 students in 1972. It was even able to build a new fine arts center, which opened in November of that year. However, Kleinhenz&#x27;s resignation in 1973 triggered a period of instability and enrollment declined again. Faced with mounting debts and the prospect of increased competition after the Technical Vocational Institute was authorized to offer two-year degrees, the university announced its closing at the end of the 1986 spring semester.

Following the university&#x27;s closing, the campus was repurposed to house St. Pius X High School as well as offices of the Archdiocese of Santa Fe. University of Albuquerque student records and transcripts are being housed in and can be retrieved from the University of New Mexico.

Fictitiously, the University of Albuquerque was still open and housed a renowned basketball program in the &quot;High School Musical&quot; film series (2006–2010), specifically &quot;High School Musical 2&quot; and &quot;High School Musical 3: Senior Year&quot;. In the films, their team name and mascot are said to be the Redhawks.

==Campus==
At the time of its closing in 1986, the university had a campus with 17 buildings. Most of the main buildings are still standing and have been put to various uses. The first two buildings to be completed on the West Side campus were Assumption Hall and St. Francis Hall, both built in 1950–52. The two-story brick buildings housed classrooms, offices, laboratories, a library, and a chapel, and now form the nucleus of the St. Pius X High School campus. St. Pius also took over the university&#x27;s Fine Arts Learning Center (1972) and gymnasium. Other notable buildings on the main campus included the University Center (1967), and three women&#x27;s dormitories—Madonna Hall (1961), St. Clare Hall (1964), and Lourdes Hall (1966). These buildings are used for various purposes by the Archdiocese of Santa Fe. There were also two men&#x27;s dormitories located a short distance south of the main campus, Byrne House (1965) and Davis House (1966). These buildings are now part of the Desert Hills adolescent treatment center.

==Athletics==
The University of Albuquerque&#x27;s sports teams, nicknamed the Dons, competed as NAIA independents in basketball, baseball, golf, tennis, and soccer. From 1966 to 1969, they were also members of the NCAA College Division (Division II). The basketball team attained modest success, competing in the NAIA Men&#x27;s Basketball Championships in 1964 (as St. Joseph), 1966, and 1968. They compiled a 1–3 tournament record with their only win coming against the University of New Haven in the 1966 edition. One of the Dons&#x27; most notable recruits was center Zoilo Dominguez, a veteran of the Argentinean national team who was named a third-team All-American in 1966. Starting in 1963, the team played its home games at the now demolished Albuquerque Civic Auditorium.

Financial difficulties led the university to cancel all of its athletic programs at the end of the 1968–69 season. The basketball program was eventually reinstated in 1980, albeit with a greatly reduced budget and a team composed of walk-ons. The university was planning to re-apply for NAIA membership at the time of its closing in 1986.

<text>Stanley Maurice Elkins (April 27, 1925 in Boston, Massachusetts – September 16, 2013 in Leeds, Massachusetts) was an American historian, best known for his unique and controversial comparison of slavery in the United States to Nazi concentration camps, and for his collaborations (in a book and numerous articles) with Eric McKitrick regarding the early American Republic. They together wrote &quot;The Age of Federalism&quot;, on the history of the founding fathers of America. He obtained his BA from Harvard University (under the GI bill scholarship) and his Ph.D. in history from Columbia University. Elkins first taught at the University of Chicago but spent most of his career as a professor of history at Smith College in Northampton, MA, where he raised his family and eventually retired.

==Career==
Elkins was born in Boston to Frank and Frances Elkins (née Reiner). He attended Boston English High School and enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1943, serving in the 362nd Infantry Regiment, fighting in France but primarily Italy during World War II. He served as initially a Scout and later a Prisoner Transport Guard (of German POWs). After the war, he married Dorothy Adele Lamken and attended Harvard University on the GI Bill (A.B. 1949), followed by Columbia University for graduate school in American history (M.A. 1951, Ph.D. 1958), where he studied under Richard Hofstadter. He and fellow graduate student Eric McKitrick received a joint appointment as assistant professors of history at the University of Chicago, where they taught from 1955 to 1960. In 1960 he joined the faculty at Smith College, where he was appointed the Sydenham Clark Parsons Professor Emeritus of History from 1969 until his death in 2013.

==&quot;Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life&quot;==
Based on Elkins&#x27; doctoral dissertation at Columbia University, this work was theoretically innovative and enormously influential when first published, although largely superseded today. In it, Elkins made two major, and controversial, statements, the first being American abolitionists reduced their effectiveness by insisting on ideological consistency and purity, and refusing to compromise with the slave system. He argued British abolitionists were more pragmatic and thus effective, allowing them to abolish slavery without war.

He went on to contrast slavery in North America with that in Spanish America, suggesting it was more important to focus on the structures governing the institution, rather than its conditions. In North America, slaves were deprived of any legal rights, including the ability to marry or have a family, be protected from violence, own property or make a will. With the exception of Maryland and Kentucky, slave states even passed legislation making it illegal for anyone to teach slaves to read and write, or allow them to own books. The removal of personal rights and utter dependence on their owners resulted in what Elkins called &quot;chattel slavery&quot;, which he contrasted with the system prevailing in Spanish America. Although conditions could be just as harsh, slaves generally had a variety of legal rights, including the ability to use the court system, purchase their freedom or contract their labour out to others. 

In addition, slavery in North America was almost exclusively a black experience, while in Spanish America it began as a &quot;misfortune&quot; that could happen to anyone who fell into debt. As a result, &quot;chattel slavery&quot; had a lasting impact on how black Americans viewed themselves and how they were perceived by wider society. Then-recent research by Bruno Bettelheim and others on inmates of Nazi concentration camps during World War II showed their totalitarian environment systematically destroyed the ability of inmates to resist, plan or form positive relationships with one another. Elkins suggested pre-Civil War slavery was a similar environment, views that were influential in the late 1960s when politicians like Daniel Patrick Moynihan supported affirmative action programs as a way to counteract the longterm impact of slavery on black culture.

His arguments have since been heavily criticised, particularly for his use of the racial slur &quot;Sambo&quot; to describe the allegedly &quot;infantilised&quot; state which black Americans were reduced to by slavery. In addition, critics point out Elkins provided no data or methodology for his comparison between WWII concentration camp victims, largely white Europeans, and black Americans. Initially heralded by the black community as an important and positive contribution, this comparison was considered offensive by descendants of both groups. Finally, it is suggested his criticism of American abolitionists ignores the reality of the society within which they operated, since every attempt made to achieve partial reform was blocked. The controversy is discussed in more detail in a collection of essays by Ann Lane, and also by historian John Wesley Blassingame.

==&quot;The Age of Federalism&quot;==
&quot;The Age of Federalism: The Early Republic, 1788-1800&quot;, co-authored by Elkins and Eric McKitrick, was described as a &quot;dazzling book,&quot; featuring an &quot;elegant and penetrating pen portrait of Hamilton.&quot;&quot;The Age of Federalism&quot; won the Bancroft Prize. The book explores the history of the Federalist party, discusses the relationships among key players, among them Thomas Jefferson, John Jay, and Alexander Hamilton, and analyzes the administrations of George Washington and John Adams.

<text>The EMC EA/EB is an early passenger train-hauling diesel locomotive built from May 16, 1937, to 1938 by Electro-Motive Corporation of La Grange, Illinois for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. They were the first model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units. Each locomotive unit developed from two Winton 201-A diesel engines, driving the wheels through an electric transmission—the generator driven by each engine provided current for traction motors. The locomotives were of A1A-A1A wheel arrangement—two three-axle trucks of which only the outer two axles were powered. Six two-unit locomotives were produced, each consisting of a lead cab-equipped EA A unit and a cabless booster EB B unit. They were numbered 51 through 56; the A units bore the bare number and the B units the number followed by &#x27;X&#x27;.

== Trains hauled ==
The six locomotives hauled some of the major named trains of the B&amp;O; the &quot;Royal Blue&quot;, the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot;, the &quot;National Limited&quot;, and others. These trains were streamliners in appearance, but they were built largely of refurbished heavyweight passenger cars rebuilt with smooth sides, smooth rooflines, air conditioning, new interiors and modern appointments.

B&amp;O 52 was sold to the Alton Railroad in 1940. This locomotive became a Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad unit in 1947.

== Significance and influence ==
The EA/EB—along with the more-or-less simultaneous E1 for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and the E2 for the Union Pacific Railroad, Chicago and North Western Railway and Southern Pacific Railroad—represented an important step in the evolution of the passenger diesel locomotive. While the EA, E1 and E2 were each built for a specific railroad, they were largely identical mechanically and were a step further away from the custom-built, integrated streamliner and towards mass-produced passenger locomotives—a step achieved with the E3 and E6, EMD&#x27;s later models.

== Styling ==
The EA/EB and E1 featured largely identical and innovative styling showing the influence of the Electro-Motive Corporation&#x27;s new buyer General Motors. While mechanically they had much in common with previous, experimental EMC locomotives, GM understood the importance of looking new and exciting, not primerely being technically innovative. This basic &quot;slant nose&quot; style was continued in the subsequent E3, E4, E5 and E6 models, while a more &quot;bulldog nose&quot; style was tried in the E2 and a style somewhere in between was used for the E7, E8 and E9, as well as the EMD F-Units.

Its initial design was protected under US Patent D106,918.

== Preservation ==
B&amp;O #51, the first EA built, has been preserved at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. The EA has completed cosmetic restoration and is now on exhibit.

==History==

===13h–14th centuries===

In 1213, King Ottokar I had granted the remote area around today&#x27;s Broumov and Police nad Metují to the Benedictine monks of Břevnov Monastery in Prague, who began to colonize the lands. The wooden Church of the Virgin Mary already stood here. Broumov was probably founded in 1255. Broumov was first mentioned in 1256 and already referred to as a market village. It was a centre of trade, crafts and administration of the abbatial estates. In 1275, the drapers in Broumov received from King Ottokar II the privilege of producing and selling cloth, and the production soon began to be exported. This laid the foundation for the textile industry in the region.

Many fires broke out and destroyed the original buildings except for the Church of the Virgin Mary and damaged the local castle. In 1305 and following years, the castle was largely rebuilt and extended by one of the abbots into a fortified monastery complex with an abbey and Church of Saint Adalbert. The town became the administrative centre of the abbey&#x27;s manors. In 1348, it received privileges by King Charles IV similar to royal towns. From 1357 to 1380, the town walls were built.

===15th–18th centuries===

The Broumov Monastery remained strongly tied to Břevnov Monastery, from where the monks fled during the Hussite Wars in 1420 to Broumov. The town was besieged by Hussites, but never conquered. However, it suffered losses and had to invest heavily in strengthening the walls. During the 15th century, Broumov was affected by war conflicts over the Bohemian throne. In the 16th century, the cloth production flourished and until the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was known as one of the biggest Bohemian producers and exporters of this article. Thanks to the wealth, it was possible to carry out renaissance repairs and build stone houses after the great fire in 1549.

It was incorporated into the Habsburg monarchy in 1526. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was damaged and looted several times. Thanks to good work of abbots between 1663 and 1738, the town recovered and reached economic prosperity. Broumov again suffered in the Silesian Wars from 1740 onwards, when troops of the Prussian Army plundered it and upon the 1742 Treaty of Breslau, the adjacent lands of Silesia and Kłodzko were cut off by the newly established Austro-Prussian border. The wars stopped most of the cloth manufactury.

===19th–20th centuries===
With Bohemia, the town became part of the Austrian Empire in 1804 and Austria-Hungary in 1867. From 1868 it was the administrative seat of Braunau District, one of 94 districts in the Austrian Kingdom of Bohemia. After the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, more than 400 citizens emigrated to Latin America, especially to Chile, where the village of Nueva Braunau was established near Puerto Varas in 1875.

During the first half of the 19th century, the built-up area of the town stretched outside the town walls. In the late 19th century, the industrialization started and new factories were established. Textile factories have become the mainstay of the economy.

Upon World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, Broumov with its predominantly German population became part of the new state of Czechoslovakia according to the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain. After the Munich Agreement, Broumov was occupied by Nazi Germany in October 1938 and incorporated into Reichsgau Sudetenland.

Pursuant to the Beneš decrees, the German-speaking population was expelled, including the monastery&#x27;s monks, who re-established the Braunau in Rohr Abbey in Bavaria. The Broumov Monastery was finally abolished in 1950; after the Velvet Revolution of 1989, the premises were returned to the Benedictines.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
The tradition of the textile industry continues to this day. The main employers in the town are the textile company Veba and its subsidiary Vebatrade-Plus.

==Transport==
Broumov is the starting point of the railway line Broumov–Starkoč via Náchod.

==Sights==
Broumov has preserved historical centre similar to Silesian towns with a large rectangular market square with two parallel main streets running from both sides of the square and converging at both gates located on the opposite sides of the town. Throughout the perimeter of the old town are preserved fragments of town walls. The town hall on the square was originally from the 13th century and one of the oldest in Bohemia. Its current appearance is a result of many reconstructions, the last are from 1839 and 1994. In the historic centre there are many valuable burghers&#x27; houses, originally in the Gothic style and rebuilt in 16th, 18th and 19th centuries.

The Benedictine Monastery of Saint Wenceslaus from the early 14th century was rebuilt in Baroque style to plans by Christoph Dientzenhofer, continued by his son, Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer in 1728–1738. Today the monastery houses the regional museum. The monastery garden is also accessible. The Church of Saint Adalbert in the monastery complex dates from 1357 and was baroque rebuilt in 1684–1694. For its value, the monastery is protected as a national cultural monument.

Besides the monastery church, there are four other significant churches in the town. The rarest is the wooden Church of the Virgin Mary, which is a national cultural monument. This cemetery church was founded at the latest in the early 13th century. It was rebuilt in 1450 or 1459 after it was burnt down by the Hussites, and repaired in 1779. It is one of the oldest wooden sacral buildings in central Europe. The church is exceptional not only for its age, but also for its construction technique. It does not contain any nails and is formed by half-timbered structure made of massive oak beams. It includes a gallery with Renaissance and Empire tombstones.

The Church of Saint Wenceslaus was built in 1728–1729 according to the design made by K. I. Dientzenhofer. It replaced an old wooden Protestant church, abolished in 1618. The church it the third building in the town protected as a national cultural monument.

The Church of Saint Peter and Paul was first mentioned in 1258. The church was replaced by a stone building in the 14th century and it rebuilt in Baroque style in 1679–1680. The tower was added in 1682.

The Church of the Holy Spirit was first mentioned in the 14th century. The originally wooden church was replaced in 1689 by the current stone building.

<text>Agathoclea Theotropus (; the epithet possibly means &quot;the Goddess-like&quot;) was an Indo-Greek queen married to Menander I, who ruled in parts of northern India in the 2nd-century BC as regent for her son Strato I. Born in Bactria, likely to a noble family (probably royal) with some authors such as Tarn alleging she was a daughter of Eucratides, however this is uncertain and Tarn is often criticised by modern authors for casually creating dynastic relationships. Nonetheless, Agathoclea would become one of the first woman ruler in the Hellenistic world, and she seems to have been relatively significant due to her large presence on the coins of Strato I.

==Date and genealogy==
The traditional view, introduced by Tarn and defended as late as 1998 by Bopearachchi, is that Agathokleia was the widow of Menander I. She may also have been the daughter of Eucratides. In the civil wars after Menander&#x27;s death, the Indo-Greek empire was divided, with Agathokleia and her young son Strato maintaining themselves in the eastern territories of Gandhara and Punjab.
The modern view, embraced by R. C. Senior and probably more solid since it is founded on numismatical analyses, suggests that Agathokleia was a later queen, perhaps ruling from 110 BC–100 BC or slightly later. In this case, Agathoclea was likely the widow of another king, possibly Nicias or Theophilus. In either case, Agathokleia was among the first women to rule a Hellenistic Kingdom.

Some of her subjects may have been reluctant to accept an infant king with a queen regent: unlike the Seleucid and Ptolemaic Kingdoms, almost all Indo-Greek rulers were depicted as grown men. This was probably because the kings were required to command armies, as can be seen on their coins where they are often depicted with helmets and spears. Agathokleia seems to have associated herself with Athena, the goddess of war. Athena was also the dynastic deity of the family of Menander, and Agathokleia&#x27;s prominent position suggests that she was herself the daughter of a king, though she was probably too late to have been a daughter of the Bactrian king Agathocles.

==Coinage==

The coins of Agathokleia and Strato were all bilingual, and Agathoclea&#x27;s name appears more often in the Greek legend than in the Indian.

&quot;(See Strato I for details of legends.)&quot;

Most of Agathoclea&#x27;s coins were struck jointly with her son Strato, though on their first issues, he is not featured on the portrait.

Silver: Bust of Agathoclea/walking king

Bust of Strato and Agathoclea conjoined/Athena Alcidemus

Bronzes: Bust of either helmeted Athena or Agathoclea as a personification of this goddess/sitting Heracles

The later king Heliocles II overstruck some of Agathoclea&#x27;s coins.

<doc id="1313974" wikidata="Q1232616" url="?curid=1313974" title="Antiquities of the Jews">
<text>Antiquities of the Jews (; , &quot;Ioudaikē archaiologia&quot;) is a 20-volume historiographical work, written in Greek, by historian Josephus in the 13th year of the reign of Roman emperor Domitian, which was 94 CE. The book contains an account of the history of the Jewish people for Josephus&#x27;s gentile patrons. In the first ten volumes, Josephus follows the events of the Hebrew Bible beginning with the creation of Adam and Eve.

The second ten volumes continues the history of the Jewish people beyond the biblical text and up to the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE). This work, along with Josephus&#x27;s other major work, &quot;The Jewish War&quot; (&quot;De Bello Iudaico&quot;), provides valuable background material for historians wishing to understand 1st-century CE Judaism and the early Christian period.

==Content==
Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; is a vital source for the history of the intertestamental period and the Jewish war against Rome. &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; is separated into twenty volumes:
In the preface of &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, Josephus provides his motivation for composing such a large work. He writes:
Now I have undertaken the present work, as thinking it will appear to all the Greeks worthy of their study; for it will contain all our antiquities, and the constitution of our government, as interpreted out of the Hebrew Scriptures.

Josephan scholar Louis Feldman highlights several of the misconceptions about the Jewish people that were being circulated in Josephus&#x27;s time. In particular, the Jews were thought to lack great historical figures and a credible history of their people. They were also accused of harboring hostility toward non-Jews, and were thought to be generally lacking in loyalty, respect for authority, and charity. With these harsh accusations against the Jews fluttering about the Roman empire, Josephus, set out to provide a Hellenized version of the Jewish history. Such a work is often called an &quot;apologia,&quot; as it pleads the case of a group of people or set of beliefs to a larger audience.

In order to accomplish this goal, Josephus omitted certain accounts in the Jewish narrative and even added a Hellenistic &quot;glaze&quot; to his work. For example, the &quot;Song of the Sea&quot; sung by Moses and the people of Israel after their deliverance at the Red Sea is completely omitted in Josephus&#x27;s text. He does mention, however, that Moses composed a song to God in hexameter—a rather unusual (and Greek) metrical scheme for an ancient Hebrew. Josephus also writes that Abraham taught science to the Egyptians, who in turn taught the Greeks, and that Moses set up a senatorial priestly aristocracy, which like Rome resisted monarchy. Thus, in an attempt to make the Jewish history more palatable to his Greco-Roman audience, the great figures of the biblical stories are presented as ideal philosopher-leaders.

In another example, apparently due to his concern with pagan antisemitism, Josephus omitted the entire episode of the golden calf from his account of the Israelites at Mount Sinai. It has been suggested that he was afraid that the biblical account might be employed by Alexandrian antisemites to lend credence to their allegation that the Jews worshiped an ass&#x27;s head in the Temple (cf. Apion 2:80, 114, 120; Tacitus, Histories 5:4). He also stated that the Ancient Egyptians forced the Jewish slaves to build the pyramids, writing &quot;They [the Egyptian taskmasters] set them also to build pyramids.&quot;

Josephus also adds a short account of his personal life, &quot;Vita&quot;, as an appendix to the &quot;Judean Antiquities&quot;.

Antiquities of the Jews contains a good deal of valuable, sometimes unique, historical material. This applies, for example, to the history of the Hellenistic states, Parthia, Armenia, the Nabatean kingdom, and the Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages and up to modern times the book was considered one of the most important sources in ancient Roman history, along with the works of Titus Livius, Tacitus, Suetonius, and Jerome. Because of this, Josephus is sometimes called the &quot;Titus Livius of the Greeks&quot;. The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; speculates that much of Josephus&#x27;s writings on Herod the Great and his sons draw from the work of Nicolaus of Damascus, a personal friend of Herod&#x27;s, whose writings remain largely missing; once Nicolaus&#x27;s narrative on Herod Archelaus ends, Josephus&#x27;s narrative becomes less detailed. Josephus admitted being familiar with Nicolaus&#x27;s work but also rebuked Nicolaus for exaggerating Herod&#x27;s royal claims and benevolence, where Josephus treated Herod as a tyrant.

The extant copies of this work contain two passages about Jesus and James the Just. The long one has come to be known as the &quot;Testimonium Flavianum&quot;. Scholars usually agree on the authenticity of the second passage, while the first one is considered to be authentic, but to have been subjected to Christian interpolation.

==Manuscripts==
The earliest Greek manuscript of Books 11–20 of the &quot;Antiquities&quot; dates from the eleventh century, the Ambrosianus 370 (F 128); preserved in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan. However, the manuscript tradition is complex and many manuscripts are incomplete.

The works of Josephus Flavius were popular in late antiquity. Then appeared the translation of &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; into Latin. It is attributed to either Jerome or his contemporary Tyrannius Rufinus. In medieval Europe, &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; circulated widely, mainly in Latin translation (e.g &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; from 1466 in the National Library of Poland).

This work of Joseph Flavius was translated into Old Bulgarian at the Preslav Literary School in the beginning of the 10th century during the time of Simeon the Great.

In the 9th–10th centuries, the so-called &quot;Josippon&quot;, written in Hebrew, appeared in Italy. It described the events of world and Jewish history from the time of the construction of the Tower of Babel to the capture of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 AD. Essentially, this chronicle was an abbreviated translation of &quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot; and &quot;The Jewish War&quot;, but Joseph ben Gorion was named the author. Josippon gained no less popularity than Antiquities of the Jews. With the advent of printing, it was published even before this major work of Josephus Flavius in 1476.

==Translations==
In 1602, Thomas Lodge published an English translation of both the &quot;Antiquities&quot; and the &quot;Wars&quot;. This volume amounted to over 800 pages.

The first printed edition of &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; in Greek appeared in 1544. Other publications followed—1553 (Antwerp), 1611 and 1634 (Cologne), 1687 (Oxford), 1691 (Leipzig), 1700 (Oxford), 1726 (Leiden), and so on. Already in the 15th–16th centuries, &quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot; was translated into Dutch, French, Italian, German and Spanish. The book was published both in modern languages and in Latin. The first Russian translation of &quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot; appeared in 1781. First Italian translation dates to 1549 in Venice.

One of the best known translations of this work was provided by William Whiston in 1737, which has been in print continuously since then. The Loeb Classical Library published a 1926 translation by Henry St. John Thackeray and Ralph Marcus, normally preferred academically. A cross-reference apparatus for the Works of Josephus and the Biblical canon also exists.

<doc id="1313984" wikidata="Q894585" url="?curid=1313984" title="Boston Scientific">
<text>Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC), headquartered in Marlborough, Massachusetts and incorporated in Delaware, is an American biotechnology and biomedical engineering firm and multinational manufacturer of medical devices used in interventional medical specialties, including interventional radiology, interventional cardiology, peripheral interventions, neuromodulation, neurovascular intervention, electrophysiology, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, endoscopy, oncology, urology and gynecology. Boston Scientific is widely known for the development of the Taxus Stent, a drug-eluting stent which is used to open clogged arteries. With the full acquisition of Cameron Health in June 2012, the company also became notable for offering a minimally invasive implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) which they call the EMBLEM subcutaneous implantable defibrillator (S-ICD).

== History ==
Boston Scientific was formed June 29, 1979, in Watertown, Massachusetts, as a holding company for the medical products company, Medi-Tech, Inc., and to position the company for growth in interventional medicine. Medi-Tech was the brainchild of Itzhak Bentov, a Czech-born émigré to Israel and then to the United States, who worked at the Arthur D. Little think tank in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and ran a contract research company from his rented house in Belmont, Massachusetts, a venture he founded in 1965 with a business friend, Dan Singer. In 1967 he was asked by Boston Beth Israel Hospital radiologists to design a steerable, remotely controlled catheter; a series of engineering designs, polymer improvements and prototypes led to the release of a new steerable angiography catheter in 1969. That year John Abele joined the small company with an option to buy, and a year later he exercised his option with Cooper Labs as a business partner, and the operation was moved – out of Bentov&#x27;s lab in the basement of the rectory of a Catholic church in Belmont – to Watertown. After a decade of steady growth, by chance Abele met Pete Nicholas in their neighborhood in Concord, Massachusetts. Their partnership hinged on Nicholas&#x27; goal to build business enterprises and Abele&#x27;s predilection for the vision and potential in noninvasive surgical instrumentation; they gathered backers in the Boston banking community to buy out the Cooper Labs interest and form the new corporation.

Less than a year later Kimray Medical Associates (later Mansfield Scientific, Inc.) was acquired, adding vena cava filters and cardiac output computers to the product line. By 1982 a renovated mill building in Watertown was transformed into a manufacturing plant. Acquisitions continued, with Endo-Tech (Microvasive, Inc.: gastrointestinal and pulmonary) in 1981 and then Van-Tec (urology) in 1988, and an international presence was expanded. Mansfield Scientific, Microvasive, and Medi-Tech merged into Boston Scientific December 31, 1988.

=== Initial public offering (1992) ===
On May 19, 1992, Boston Scientific launched an initial public offering of 23.5 million shares, of which 18.8 million were offered in the U.S. and 4.7 million were offered outside the U.S. The initial offering amounted to 23% of Boston Scientific&#x27;s outstanding stock. The opening price was $17 per share. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. (lead) and PaineWebber Inc. were the underwriters and Abbott Laboratories held a 20% stake (23.5 million shares). The market capitalization was about $1.6 billion. The U.S. shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

=== Post–IPO ===

From 1995 through 1997, Boston Scientific increased its technology R&amp;D and product offerings following several substantial acquisitions that included Cardiovascular Imaging Systems (intravascular ultrasound), SCIMED (cardiovascular), Vesica Medical (urology), Meadox (textile vascular prostheses), EP Technologies (cardiac ablation controllers), MinTec (abdominal aortic aneurysm grafts), Symbiosis Corporation (specialty medical product manufacture), and Target Therapeutics (on neurology). Boston Scientific acquired Target Therapeutics in a tax-free stock swap for about $1.1 billion, more than 10 times Target&#x27;s total sales, in contrast to the usual multiple of 10 times earnings.

The Taxus Stent was approved in 2003 in Europe and other countries and, in the United States, by the FDA in March 2004. It was the second drug-eluting stent approved in the United States.

In April 2004 the company announced that it had exercised an exclusive option to acquire Precision Vascular Systems, Inc., as part of a series of agreements between Boston Scientific and Precision Vascular in 2002 – for an undisclosed sum. In June Boston acquired Advanced Bionics Corporation for $740 million in cash, plus earn out payments. In December Boston completed its acquisition of Advanced Stent Technologies, Inc., for $120 million payable in Boston Scientific stock, plus the possibility of future contingent payments. AST had been developing stent and stent delivery systems specifically designed to address the anatomical needs of coronary artery disease in bifurcated vessels.

In April 2005, Boston exercised an exclusive option to acquire TriVascular, Inc., for an undisclosed sum and renamed it as Boston Scientific Santa Rosa Corporation, or BSSR. TriVascular was founded in January 1998 to develop less-invasive medical devices and procedures for treating abdominal aortic aneurysms, but BSC discontinued its endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) program in 2006. Also, in April 2005, BSC announced it had exercised its option to acquire CryoVascular Systems, Inc., and its proprietary angioplasty device to treat atherosclerotic disease of the legs and other peripheral arteries. In June Boston Scientific announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Nemo I Acquisition, Inc., had successfully acquired Salt Lake City-based Rubicon Medical Corporation, with Rubicon became a wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific.

In March 2008, BSC sold BSSR to TV2 Holding Company of Santa Rosa. Terms of the sale include $30 million in cash paid at the closing to BSC and a warrant allowing BSC to purchase a minority interest in TV2.

===Guidant merger===
In January 2006, the company announced an offer for its longtime competitor, Guidant, for $72 per share or $25 billion. The offer, however, was rejected. On April 21, 2006, BSC acquired Guidant for $27.2 billion. Guidant was split between BSC and Abbott Laboratories. Four years later, in 2010, when moving its heart-rhythm business from its acquisition of Guidant, Boston Scientific eliminated 1300 jobs.

==Organizational culture==
BSC has been assessed favorably by its employees. In &quot;Glassdoor&quot; annual &quot;Best Places to Work – Employee&#x27;s Choice Survey&quot;, BSC earned scores of:

===Social commitment===
Boston Scientific has set a standard for implementing an integrative organizational culture and states that it actively strives to further improve this by, among other things, increasing diversity among its employees – and in particular, among its managers, executives, and directors. To this end, the company has set itself the following goals in 2018:
* Leadership role by belonging to the top 10 companies in the integration of employees of the following groups: women, people of color, disabled persons and members of the LGBTQ community.
* Increase the proportion of people of color with supervisor or managerial functions to 20% in the USA including Puerto Rico (end of 2018: 19.6%, +1.8% compared to 2017).
* Increase the proportion of women in supervisor or managerial positions to 40% worldwide (end of 2018: 38.4%, +1.0% against 2017).

Success for these objectives has been chronicled and ranked by publications and organizations, including:

== Litigation ==
===Johnson &amp; Johnson patent litigation===
Beginning in 2003, Boston Scientific and Johnson &amp; Johnson were involved in a series of litigations involving patents covering heart stent medical devices. Both parties claimed that the other had infringed upon their patents. The litigation was settled once Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716 million to Johnson &amp; Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73 billion in February 2010.

It was announced in November 2014 that Johnson &amp; Johnson would have another chance for payback after a multibillion-dollar trial was set for November 20, 2014. A New York federal court judge would hear the case without a jury to decide whether Boston Scientific should be held liable for the contract breach.

===Transvaginal mesh===
Boston Scientific is one of several manufacturers of a medical device called transvaginal mesh, a type of surgical mesh used to treat pelvic organ prolapse. Experts concluded that the medical company had used cheap, counterfeit resin, which was both toxic and degraded when exposed to oxygen. When this was announced on &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; Boston Scientific responded by saying the broadcast was &quot;irresponsible and misleading,&quot; citing a 2017 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) report stating that although they found variability in the polypropylene resin, &quot;these differences do not present new safety or effectiveness concerns.&quot; One woman, who sued in 2011, was awarded $100 million. Two operations had failed to remove all the parts of the mesh and she was still in pain. The company appealed the decision and had the amount reduced to $10M. In 2015, Boston Scientific announced it would pay $119 million to 2,970 lawsuit plaintiffs, who had been injured by the mesh. On March 23, 2021, the company agreed to pay $189 million to settle allegations that it had seriously misrepresented the risks related to the vaginal mesh. As of Jan. 27, 2021, around 54,000 lawsuits related to transvaginal meshes had been filed against Boston Scientific.

In April 2019, the FDA ordered Boston Scientific and Coloplast to remove all of their vaginal mesh products from the United States market.

In 2020, Johnson &amp; Johnson was required to pay $344 million for failing to disclose the serious product risks of its transvaginal mesh product.

=== NIR stent ===
In 2005, Boston Scientific paid $74 million to settle allegations that it had continued to sell NIR stents (flexible stents) after learning that many of them were defective. Twenty-six injuries and one death may have been caused by malfunctioning stents.

=== Defective defibrillators ===

In 2011, Guidant, a subsidiary of Boston Scientific, was criminally convicted of a failure to report defibrillator safety problems to the FDA. The company was forced to pay more than $296 million in criminal fines and had to submit to the supervision of the U.S. Probation Office for three years. Even though Guidant knew the devices were defective, they continued to sell the defibrillators anyway. Guidant LLC had also advised its sales representatives to tell physicians that nothing was wrong with the defibrillators, and told the FDA that the proposed corrections were not being done to correct life-threatening device flaws, but were rather to improve process throughout. Not until three deaths had occurred and ten months had passed did the company reveal the defects in 2005. The directives for these wrongdoings had been implemented prior to Boston Scientific&#x27;s acquisition of Guidant in 2006.

In 2013, BSC and three of its subsidiaries – Guidant LLC, Guidant Sales LLC, and Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. – agreed to pay $30 million to settle allegations that, according to the Justice Department, between 2002 and 2005, Guidant knowingly sold defective heart devices to health care facilities that in turn implanted the devices into Medicare patients.

=== Bribery allegations ===

In 2009, Boston Scientific agreed to pay $22 million to settle allegations that its subsidiary Guidant LLC had used kickback schemes to boost sales for its pacemakers (cardiac rhythm management or CRM devices) and defibrillators (implantable cardioverter-defibrillators or ICD devices). Allegedly, Guidant paid doctors between $1,000 and $1,500 each to participate in one of its four post-studies known as RaCE ($1,500), RaCE II ($1,000), RaCE III ($1,000), and MERITS ($1,000).

== Obsidio Embolic Recall ==
In April 2024, the FDA announced a recall of Boston Scientific&#x27;s device, Obsidio Embolic, which is used to stop hemorrhaging and excessive bleeding. It has been found that when the device is paired with the aliquot technique, it can lead to bowel ischemia, which can mean longer hospitalization or death for patients.

== Financial restatement ==
On November 3, 1998, Boston Scientific restated its financial results for 1997, as well as its quarterly results for the first three quarters of 1998, due to the occurrence of business irregularities in the operations of its Japanese subsidiary.

<doc id="1313985" wikidata="Q6603845" url="?curid=1313985" title="List of Washington state symbols">
<text>The U.S. state of Washington has 21 official emblems, as designated by the Washington State Legislature. These symbols, which reflect the history and culture of the state, are often opportunities for politicians to &quot;tie themselves to popular symbols&quot;, for teachers to highlight the legislative process to their students, and for lobbyists to &quot;have their products given official designation&quot;.

While some of the symbols are unique to Washington, others are used by multiple states. For example, the willow goldfinch (also known as the American goldfinch), Washington&#x27;s state bird, is also an official symbol for Iowa and New Jersey. Washington&#x27;s state grass, bluebunch wheatgrass, is also a symbol for the state of Montana. The square dance and apple are commonly used state dances and state foods, respectively. While most states have an official motto and nickname, Washington&#x27;s motto (&quot;Al-ki&quot;, meaning &quot;by and by&quot; in Chinook Jargon) and nickname (&quot;The Evergreen State&quot;) have never been officially adopted by the Legislature.

Washington&#x27;s first official symbol was its flag, adopted in 1923. While some symbols, including the state flower and state seal, were selected before then, they were not adopted by the Legislature until later. Washington&#x27;s second symbol was the western hemlock, selected as the state tree in 1947. Fourteen symbols were added between 1950 and 2000. Five symbols have been adopted in the 21st century. The newest symbol of Washington is state dinosaur, &quot;Suciasaurus rex&quot;, which was declared in 2023.

== Unofficial symbols and unsuccessful proposals ==

While most states have an official motto and nickname, the Washington Legislature never officially adopted either. &quot;Al-ki&quot;, meaning &quot;by and by&quot; in Chinook Jargon, is the state&#x27;s unofficial motto, first appearing on the territorial seal designed by Lt. J.K. Duncan. Washington was unofficially nicknamed &quot;The Evergreen State&quot; by pioneer and historian C.T. Conover for its abundant evergreen forests.

Several symbols have been proposed for addition to the list of official state symbols but were never adopted. Proposed symbols have included Richard Berry&#x27;s &quot;Louie Louie&quot; or Dana Lyons&#x27; &quot;Our State Is a Dumpsite&quot; as the state song and Aplets and Cotlets (a confection made from apples and apricots by Liberty Orchards) as the state candy. The designation of sasquatch as the state&#x27;s official cryptid or monster has been proposed since the 1970s, going as far as a joke proclamation issued by Governor Daniel J. Evans in 1970.

<doc id="1313988" wikidata="Q329593" url="?curid=1313988" title="Thomas Bilotti">
<text>Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Bilotti (March 23, 1940 – December 16, 1985) was an American mobster who briefly served as underboss of the Gambino crime family in New York City. It was his promotion that helped trigger the 1985 assassination of Gambino boss Paul Castellano; Bilotti would end up killed as well as part of the assassination.

==Criminal career==
The son of Italian immigrants Lillian (née Rosso) and Anthony Bilotti, he was born on the Staten Island borough of New York City. As a young man, Bilotti became an associate in the crew of John &quot;Johnny D&quot; D&#x27;Alessio, a &quot;caporegime&quot; in the Gambino crime family who controlled illegal gambling and other rackets on Staten Island. He later became a criminal associate of John&#x27;s brothers Alexander &quot;Pope&quot; D&#x27;Alessio and Michael &quot;Mikey D&quot; D&#x27;Alessio. Bilotti also spent time as the chauffeur and bodyguard of Alexander &quot;The Ox&quot; DeBrizzi, an uncle of the D&#x27;Alessio brothers who controlled the Staten Island waterfront for the Gambino crime family. He became an integral member of the D&#x27;Alessio crew and was involved in labor racketeering, extortion and loansharking. In 1969, Bilotti was arrested on Staten Island on a felony charge of possessing stolen property. He gained a reputation for violence. In one incident, Bilotti assaulted Colombo crime family associate Robert Pate. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents Joseph O’Brien and Andris Kurins described Bilotti in the book &quot;Boss of Bosses: The Fall of the Godfather: The FBI and Paul Castellano&quot; as: &quot;He was basically a pit bull with shoes on. If he had a business ability beyond choreographing a shakedown or calculating the interest owed on shylock loans, it didn&#x27;t show. In a milieu not known for its conversational finesse, Bilotti distinguished himself by spluttering inarticulateness... He was short – five feet seven. He was stubby – a rock-solid two-twenty. He wore a bad toupée. He had no tact, no charm, no sense of humor. He had a big mouth, and his piggish eyes were too close together. To the concept of self-control he was a stranger&quot;. Bilotti was a reputed hitman for the D&#x27;Alessio crew, and was allegedly involved in at least eleven murders.

Bilotti was a resident of 33 Kensington Avenue on Staten Island in April 1970, when he and an accomplice, Thomas Papanier, were observed discarding firearms and arrested following a shooting in Jamesburg, New Jersey. Bilotti and Papanier were apprehended as they ran from the scene of the shooting, in which African-American teenager Emory Parks suffered superficial injuries when he was struck in the back of the head by birdshot pellets. The quick arrest of the pair occurred as the Jamesburg area was in the midst of significant racial tension after riots at the local high school, and police from Spotswood and Monroe Township were on alert. Although police suspected that the duo were responsible for Parks&#x27; injuries, Bilotti and Papanier were initially charged with carrying a concealed weapon, carrying a pistol without a permit and failing to secure a permit to purchase a pistol. A Middlesex County grand jury ultimately indicted the men only for illegal possession of concealed weapons.

In 1971, John D&#x27;Alessio allegedly recruited Thomas Bilotti and his brother Joseph to murder Thomas &quot;Tommy Edwards&quot; Ernst, the common-law husband of D&#x27;Alessio&#x27;s daughter Theresa. Ernst, who was in debt to two Staten Island mobsters, survived an initial attempt on his life at a Grasmere diner on August 31, 1971. He then agreed to meet with D&#x27;Alessio at the Wild Acres bar in Dingmans Ferry, near D&#x27;Alessio&#x27;s summer home in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, on September 2, 1971. After leaving the D&#x27;Alessio country mansion on his way to the meeting, Ernst&#x27;s Cadillac was overtaken by three men in a car who opened fire at him. However, this murder attempt also failed when Theresa D&#x27;Alessio, who was not supposed to be present, returned fire with a semi-automatic rifle. Ernst reportedly identified the two shooters to the Pennsylvania State Police before withrawing the identification. Ernst was ultimately killed on April 6, 1972 when he was ambushed and shot twice by an unidentified gunman on the porch of John D&#x27;Alessio&#x27;s home at 151 Jumel Street in Great Kills, where he had been making a visit to Theresa D&#x27;Alessio.

Bilotti&#x27;s first wife Catherine died of cancer in her mid-30s, and he subsequently remarried to Donna, a Brooklyn beauty parlor owner. He had a severely autistic son who had been institutionalized since childhood, and although Bilotti visited the boy regularly, he rarely spoke of him. Bilotti was best man at the wedding of actor Gianni Russo, a fellow native of Staten Island. Another Bilotti brother, Jimmy, worked for the singer Frank Sinatra in Las Vegas for several years during the 1970s and 1980s.

===Castellano protégé===
Over the years, Bilotti became a close aide-de-camp and confidant of another Gambino &quot;capo&quot;, Paul Castellano, who reportedly saw much potential in the ambitious Bilotti and took him on as a protégé. He served as Castellano&#x27;s primary chauffeur, bodyguard and enforcer. Although Castellano had worked hard to cultivate a sophisticated image, he chose the thuggish Bilotti as his protégé because he was &quot;vigilant, hardworking, fearless, and, above all, loyal&quot;, according to O&#x27;Brien and Kurins. The agents described his traits: &quot;As long as he was waiting on Paul Castellano, Tommy Bilotti was deferential, subdued, watchful yet calm, like a dog on a rug. His self-esteem derived from adoration of the master, and he could afford to be well-behaved. Problems occurred, however, when Bilotti was sent on errands of his own. Out of sight of the Boss, he got rambunctious. He tried to play the big shot; he overdid things. He got creative in a sadistic sort of way, and embroidered gratuitous cruelty through what should have been straightforward business transactions&quot;. In one incident, Bilotti entered a Staten Island bar armed with a baseball bat to collect an interest payment from the owner, who was still recovering and trying to pay medical bills from a beating sustained weeks earlier. He berated the bar patrons and owner before unzipping his pants and ordering the bar owner to put his mouth on him, saying to the patrons looking on: &quot;You see? He likes it&quot;. O&#x27;Brien was warned by Bruce Mouw, the supervisor of the FBI&#x27;s Squad C-16, which was assigned to investigate the Gambino crime family: &quot;Don&#x27;t ever talk to Tommy Bilotti alone. He doesn’t play by the rules, [and he has a] very short fuse&quot;. In an incident when O&#x27;Brien followed Bilotti to a beauty parlor owned by his second wife Donna, Bilotti left the parlor by a back door, entered another car and pulled up next to the vehicle from which O&#x27;Brien was carrying out surveillance and confronted the agent. Describing Bilotti&#x27;s demeanor during the encounter, O&#x27;Brien said: &quot;Now, most people, when they are building up to a fit of rage, need some give-and-take, some goading, to get them really psyched. Not Tommy Bilotti. When he got mad, it was like a nuclear reactor going into a meltdown. Once a certain threshold was reached, the process just fed on itself, the voltage increasing exponentially until the fuel was all used up and everything within a certain radius had been leveled. His voice got louder and louder, he made less and less sense. Soon he was just spitting out curses wrapped in random phrases, his face purple, his nostrils distended, ropy veins standing out on his pit-bull neck&quot;.

Following the death of Carlo Gambino, Castellano was elevated to boss of the Gambino crime family in 1976. Gambino&#x27;s decision to appoint Castellano as his successor essentially split the family into two factions; Castellano&#x27;s &quot;white-collar&quot; branch, and a &quot;blue-collar&quot; wing led by underboss Aniello Dellacroce. Bilotti was subsequently inducted as a &quot;made&quot; member of the family in October 1977, and his older brother Joseph followed suit in 1980. When Castellano moved into a custom built palatial mansion at 177 Benedict Road atop Staten Island&#x27;s Todt Hill in 1980, Bilotti moved into a less ostentatious home nearby. He was a regular visitor and dinner guest at Castellano&#x27;s mansion and was considered a close family friend. However, when Castellano started an affair with his live-in maid Gloria Olarte, Bilotti kept it secret from Castellano&#x27;s wife Nina. Bilotti, along with Salvatore Barbato, also provided security for Castellano and his estate. Bilotti and Castellano regularly vacationed together at Pompano Beach, Florida. Castellano promoted Bilotti to &quot;capo&quot; in the fall of 1981, and he oversaw a crew of &quot;soldati&quot; (&quot;soldiers&quot;) that included his brother Joseph Bilotti and John Gambino.

In addition to maintaining a large loansharking book, Bilotti was granted lucrative new business ventures by Castellano. The pair were partners in Scara-Mix, a concrete-supply company headquartered at 2537 Richmond Terrace in West New Brighton which continuously won profitable contracts. The company obtained more than $2 million in subcontracts on city and Transit Authority construction projects between 1984 and 1986 alone. Paul&#x27;s son Philip Castellano was installed as president of Scara-Mix, and Bilotti served as the company&#x27;s vice president, overseeing day-to-day activities on various construction projects in New York City and New Jersey in which the Gambino crime family had an interest. He was also heavily involved in the Steam Fitters Local 638 of the Plumbers Union that was represented by George Daly, an associate who belonged to Bilotti&#x27;s crew. Daly served as Local 638&#x27;s business agent until his 1987 conviction for soliciting bribes to ensure labor peace.

===Conspiracy===
Aniello Dellacroce&#x27;s death from cancer on started a chain of events that led to Castellano&#x27;s murder two weeks A group of Gambino mobsters, including members of Dellacroce&#x27;s faction as well as onetime Castellano loyalists, conspired to assassinate Castellano and supplant him with John Gotti as head of the family. The main conspirators who composed the dissident faction were Gotti, Joseph &quot;Joe Piney&quot; Armone, Frank &quot;Frankie D&quot; DeCicco, Robert &quot;DB&quot; DiBernardo and Salvatore &quot;Sammy the Bull&quot; Gravano – collectively known as &quot;the fist&quot;. Several factors contributed to the conspiracy to kill Castellano; his failure to attend Dellacroce&#x27;s wake was an insult to the Dellacroce family and his followers. Secondly, Castellano named his bodyguard Bilotti as the new underboss, a decision which caused insult to other members of the family who felt they were more deserving of the position. Castellano also hinted that he planned on breaking up Gotti&#x27;s crew over rumors of drug dealing.

Gravano suggested killing both Castellano and Bilotti while they were eating breakfast at a diner. However, when DeCicco tipped Gotti off that he would be having a meeting with Castellano and several other Gambino mobsters at Sparks Steak House on December 16, Gotti and the other conspirators decided to kill him then.

==Death==

On Monday, December 16, 1985, Bilotti drove Castellano to the prearranged early evening meeting at Sparks Steak House in Midtown Manhattan, on near (Salvatore Scala, Edward Lino, and John Carneglia) waited near the restaurant entrance; positioned down the street were backup shooters Dominick Pizzonia, Angelo Ruggiero, and the scene from a car across 

As Castellano was exiting the car at the front of the restaurant at around 5:26 pm EST, the gunmen ran up and shot him several Allegedly, Carneglia was the gunman who shot Castellano in the head. as he exited from the driver&#x27;s door; before leaving the murder scene, Gotti drove past to view 

===Aftermath===
Bilotti is buried fifty yards away from Castellano in the Moravian Cemetery of New Dorp, Staten Island. He left behind ten children, including a six-week-old baby daughter; his wife Donna suffered a nervous breakdown and a miscarriage. Bilotti&#x27;s lucrative loansharking business was taken over by Joe Watts, who was given Bilotti&#x27;s shylock book as a reward for acting as a backup shooter in the Castellano assassination. His former home on Staten Island was later purchased by the actor Steven Seagal.

Five years after Castellano&#x27;s murder, Gotti was arrested by the FBI in late 1990 on racketeering and denied bail 10 days with the help of Gravano becoming a government witness, Gotti was convicted of numerous racketeering charges, including the 1985 Castellano and Bilotti Gotti was sentenced to life in federal where he died of throat cancer a decade later 

Bilotti is portrayed by Richard Foronjy in the TV movie &quot;Boss of Bosses&quot;, Ron Gabriel in the 1996 made-for-TV movie &quot;Gotti&quot;, and Jerry Grayson in the NBC network TV movie &quot;Witness to the Mob&quot;. He was portrayed by an uncredited actor in the biopic 2018 &quot;Gotti&quot;.

==History==
The area around the Chrudimka River is inhabited since the 12th century. Hlinsko was founded in the 12th century as a guarding settlement on the trade route from Bohemia to Moravia. The first written mention of Hlinsko is from 1349. The fortress in Hlinsko is first documented in 1413. In the 16th century, it served as a royal customhouse.

During the reign of Maria Theresa, Hlinsko became a market town, and in 1834, it became a town. During its history, the town&#x27;s economy consisted mainly of agriculture, pottery, wire-making and weaving. The tradition of pottery craft originated in the 15th century and ended in the 19th century. In 1871, the railway was built and the town was industrialized.

<text>Jack Crawford Taylor (April 14, 1922 – July 2, 2016) was an American businessman and billionaire who founded the Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company. Taylor also was a fighter pilot for the United States Navy during World War II.

==Early life and education==
Taylor was the elder of two sons born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Melburne Martling Taylor and Dorothy Crawford Taylor. Taylor enrolled in the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis in 1940. He left school to join the U.S. Navy. During World War II, he piloted an F6F Hellcat fighter from the decks of the and the earning two Distinguished Flying Crosses and the Navy Air Medal.

==Career==
After the war, he returned to St. Louis and started a delivery service company. In 1948, he took a job at the Lindburg Cadillac dealership where he eventually became a sales manager. In 1957, he started a car leasing business at the dealership in partnership with his employer, Arthur R. Lindburg, which required that he take a 50 percent pay cut and put up $25,000 for a 25% interest in the business. Targeting people whose cars were in the shop, the Executive Leasing Company began operation with a total of seven cars.

In 1969, Taylor expanded outside St. Louis and changed the name of the company to Enterprise, after the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; aircraft carrier upon which he had served in World War II. Unlike his competitors, who focused on business rentals at airports, Taylor concentrated on the hometown market offering home pickup services which led to Enterprise&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;ll Pick You Up&quot; slogan. By 1980, the rental fleet had grown to 6,000 cars. In 1989, the fleet had grown to 50,000 and he changed the name of the company to Enterprise Rent-A-Car. By 1992, Enterprise surpassed $1 billion in revenues and by 1995, it reached $2 billion in revenues. In 2007, Enterprise purchased National Car Rental and Alamo Rent-A-Car. The current executive chairman is Taylor&#x27;s son, Andrew C. Taylor.

Taylor&#x27;s business credo was: &quot;Take care of your customers and employees first, and profits will follow.&quot;
His grand daughter, Chrissy Taylor, is now the CEO of the company.

== Philanthropy ==
Among other gifts, Taylor gave:
*$45 million to the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri, part of which established the Enterprise Rent-A-Car Institute to pursue green energy projects. 
*$40 million to the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra 
*$30 million to the Missouri Botanical Garden to fund global plant research. It was the largest gift ever to a U.S. botanical garden. 
*$25 million to establish the Enterprise Rent-A-Car Scholars Program at Washington University in St. Louis for minority and financially disadvantaged students
*$1 million to Ranken Technical College in St. Louis
*$22 million to 10 charitable and educational organizations that support underserved children in the St. Louis area
*$92.5 million to 13 cultural institutions and charities, mostly in the St. Louis area

==Personal life==
Taylor was married and divorced twice. In 1945, Taylor married the former Mary Ann MacCarthy, and the couple had two children: Andrew C. Taylor, who is the executive chairman of Enterprise, and Jo Ann Taylor, who runs the Taylor family philanthropic activities. Taylor and his first wife divorced in 1977 after a long separation, and in 1979, he married Susan Orrison. Taylor and Orrison divorced in 2000. In 1978, Taylor&#x27;s first wife married E. Desmond Lee, a widower and a prominent businessman and philanthropist in his own right.

Taylor died on July 2, 2016, in St. Louis at the age of 94.

== Honors ==
In 2021, the United States Naval Institute in Annapolis named its new conference center for Taylor.

<text>The Germ, thoughts towards nature in art and literature (1850) was a periodical established by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to disseminate their ideas. The magazine was edited by William Michael Rossetti. &quot;The Germ&quot; was renamed Art and Poetry, being Thoughts towards Nature, conducted principally by Artists for its last two issues. It was not a success, only surviving for four issues between January and April 1850.

Illustrations were provided by members of the brotherhood. Every issue began with an original etching. William Holman Hunt provided an illustration to Woolner&#x27;s poem &quot;My Beautiful Lady&quot; in the first issue. Collinson illustrated his own poem, &quot;The Child Jesus&quot;, in the second issue. Madox Brown created a two-page illustration of the King Lear and his daughters for the third issue, accompanying his article on the mechanics of a history painting. Walter Deverell depicted &quot;Viola and Olivia&quot; from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; in the last issue. 

&quot;The Germ&quot; published poetry by William Michael Rossetti and other members of the Brotherhood including William Michael Rossetti&#x27;s brother Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Thomas Woolner and James Collinson. Christina Rossetti also had her poetry published there. It also printed contributions of verse and essays on art and literature by associates of the Brotherhood including Ford Madox Brown and Coventry Patmore, as well as occasional book reviews.

==Title==
The title &quot;The Germ&quot; refers to the Pre-Raphaelite belief in the importance of nature (a &quot;germ&quot; is a seed) and of the human imagination, as implied by the phrase &quot;the germ of an idea&quot;. They hoped that the magazine would be a seed from which new creative ideas would grow. It was subtitled &quot;thoughts towards nature in art and literature&quot; to emphasise the editors&#x27; belief that poetry and art should be closely intertwined.

In the hope of improving the magazine&#x27;s poor sales, it was renamed with the less ambiguous title &quot;Art and Poetry, being Thoughts towards Nature, conducted principally by Artists&quot; for its final two issues. Each issue sold less than 100 copies and the magazine closed in May 1850.

==Editions==
&quot;The Germ&quot; was printed by Messrs. Tupper and Sons, a firm of lithographic and general printers in the City of London, who took a financial stake in the publication to try to ensure its success; the Tupper family had links to the Brotherhood through the sculptor John Lucas Tupper. Only 70 of the first issue of 700 copies were sold. The print run was reduced for the next edition, but sales did not pick up. George Tupper persuaded the group to carry on for two more issues, but ultimately bore the brunt of the financial losses.

A special limited edition (only 450 copies) of all four volumes of &quot;The Germ&quot; was published in 1898 on Van Gelder handmade paper, by Thomas B. Mosher, Portland, Maine, USA.

A facsimile edition of all four volumes plus &quot;Preface&quot; by W.M. Rossetti was published by Elliot Stock in 1901 and issued in a slipcase.

<text>Bruntál (; ) is a town in the Moravian-Silesian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 15,000 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
Bruntál consists of two municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):
*Bruntál (14,935)
*Karlovec (1)

Karlovec forms an exclave of the municipal territory.

==Etymology==

The original German name &quot;Freudenthal&quot; means &#x27;valley of joy&#x27; and refers to the town&#x27;s location in a valley. The Czech name was later created by transcribing the German name.

==Geography==
Bruntál is located about north of Olomouc and northwest of Ostrava, in the historical region of Czech Silesia. It lies in the Nízký Jeseník range. The town lies in a valley surrounded by several hills. The highest point is the hill Uhlířský vrch at above sea level.

The Černý Creek with its tributaries, the Bukový, Kobylí and Vodárenský creeks, flows through Bruntál. The Kobylí Pond is located in the middle of the town. Bukový fish pond with a surface area of lies in the northern part of the municipal territory. The Karlovec exclave is located on the banks of the Slezská Harta Reservoir, about southeast of the town centre.

The most remarkable geological site in the municipal territory of the town is Uhlířský vrch. Uhlířský vrch is a stratovolcano (&quot;compositive volcano&quot;) formed by both explosive and effusive eruptions, and is thus composed of pyroclastic rocks, of which 40–80% consist of lapilli, 10–50% consist of volcanic bombs and the rest, volcanic ash. It is one of the youngest extinct volcanoes in the Czech Republic.

==History==
===13th–15th centuries===
The first written mention of Bruntál is in the Uničov Charter issued by King Ottokar I in 1223. According to the charter, Bruntál was founded probably by Vladislaus Henry around 1213 and granted Magdeburg rights. Being the first settlement in Czech lands to be granted Magdeburg rights, Bruntál was an appellate court for all cities endowed with Magdeburg rights in Northern Moravia (including Olomouc and Opava) until 1352. The reasons behind the founding of the city probably included utilising mineral ore deposits in the region, as well as thwarting colonization by the Bishops of Wrocław.

Bruntál was founded as a mining town and the mining of precious metals and later iron ore in its vicinity was the main source of its prosperity until the 17th century. This fact was also reflected in the coat of arms, which already contains the figure of a miner in its oldest known image on a document from 1287. In addition to mining the town&#x27;s economic growth was aided by its location on a trade route and the development of crafts. 

Bruntál was owned by various branches of the Přemyslid dynasty almost continuously until 1474. It was owned by the Margraves of Moravia in 1213–1318, by the Dukes of Opava in 1318–1377, and by the Dukes of Krnov in 1377–1474 except for the years 1384–1390, when it was owned by Vladislaus II of Opole.
In 1474, during the Bohemian–Hungarian War (1468–1478), Bruntál was occupied by the armed forces of Matthias Corvinus who gave the town as a pledge to his supporter, Jan of Vrbno. Despite being only a possessor of the town, Jan of Vrbno started to style himself &quot;of Vrbno and Bruntál&quot; from 1476 onwards.

===16th century===

Sons of Jan of Vrbno and Bruntál (Bernard, Hynek, and Mikuláš) managed to secure an allodial title (ownership) to the town together with neighbouring villages and mines from the Dukes of Krnov in 1506 and established the Bruntál estate. The Lords of Vrbno and Bruntál were steadily stripping the town of its privileges and forced local inhabitants into corvée labour and religious conversion to Lutheranism. These encroachments upon town privileges and the liberties of its citizens resulted in an unsuccessful rebellion against Jan the Elder of Vrbno and Bruntál in 1556.

Despite political decline Bruntál&#x27;s economy flourished under the reigns of the Lords of Vrbno and Bruntál. Thank to the privileges granted by Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria in 1535 and 1558, and by Rudolf II in 1577, the town hosted several markets each year and new guilds emerged.

The expanded mining industry, backed by the Lords of Vrbno, led to the founding of several neighbouring towns, including Andělská Hora around 1550, and Vrbno pod Pradědem in 1611. During the 16th century, the character of the town changed as it was rebuilt in the Renaissance style and better fortified by building new bastions.

===17th–19th centuries===
In 1621, the estate was confiscated from Jan IV of Vrbno and Bruntál for his participation in the Bohemian Revolt and given to the Teutonic Order. Forced re-Catholicization took place in the following years. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was repeatedly looted and severely damaged, and was also hit by a fire in 1643 and by plague epidemics in 1633 and 1647. Bruntál recovered economically from the war damage during the rule of Johann Caspar von Ampringen, but lost its former importance and wealth.

During the 18th century several disasters befell the town, such as the plagues of 1714 and 1739, and the great fires of 1748 and 1764. Nevertheless, many new baroque buildings were built during this period and a new post office was established in 1748.

During the 19th century, industrialisation took place. In 1823–1826, the town fortifications were demolished, new public buildings were built, and many textile factories were established. Bruntál became the centre of textile industry of Czech Silesia. The railway was opened in 1872.

===20th century===

According to the Austrian census of 1910 the town had 8,066 inhabitants, out of which 7,939 (99.7%) were German-speaking. Jews were not allowed to declare Yiddish as their native language, thus most of them professed the German language. The most populous religious group was the Roman Catholics with 7,725 (95.8%), followed by the Protestants with 229 (2.8%), and the Jews with 97 (1.2%).

Until 1918, Bruntál was part of Austria-Hungary, in a district by the same name, one of the eight &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Austrian Silesia.

After World War I, Bruntál became part of the newly established Czechoslovakia, which led to riots by the German majority. Czech families began to come to the town and a large minority was gradually formed. German nationalism gained many sympathizers among German inhabitants of Bruntál, which was reflected in an attempted uprising in September 1938. After signing the Munich Agreement on 29 September 1938, Bruntál was occupied by Nazi Germany. From 1938 to 1945, it was part of the Reichsgau Sudetenland.

During World War II, the Germans operated a &quot;Gestapo&quot; prison in the town, the E339 and E352 forced labour subcamps of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp, a forced labour camp for Jews, and a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp for women.

The town was liberated by the Soviet Red Army on 7 May 1945, and then restored to Czechoslovakia. The German population was expelled in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement and resettled by Czechs. In the 1950s, the textile industry ended and was replaced by new industrial enterprises.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
The largest employer with the headquarters in the town is the Czech branch of the Osram company, a manufacturer of electric lights.

==Transport==
Bruntál lies at the crossroads of two main roads: the I/11 (the section from Opava to Šumperk) and the I/45 (connecting Krnov with Olomouc District).

Bruntál is located on the railway line Ostrava–Olomouc.

==Education==

There are five kindergartens, six primary schools (including one special primary school for children with intellectual disability), and three high schools. Art education is provided by the elementary art school.

Another educational facility is the Leisure Time Centre. This facility is aimed at providing various leisure activities for children of all ages and adults. The sorts of activities offered by the Leisure Time Centre vary from sports (belly dancing, volleyball, gymnastics, etc.) to pottery or playing musical instruments.

==Sights==

The most important monument is Bruntál Castle. The original Gothic fortress from the end of the 15th century was rebuilt into a Renaissance residence in the second half of the 16th century, and then baroque rebuilt in 1766–1769. It has an atypical floor plan with a triangular courtyard with arcades. The valuable equipment of the original interiors with a picture collection, armory and library has been preserved. Today the castle houses the regional museum and its premises are also used for cultural and social events.

The castle includes a castle park from the 16th century, on an area of more than . In the park there are the remains of the town fortifications, a salla terrena from 1894, and eleven sandstone sculptures from the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries.

The parish Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary dates from the second half of the 13th century. In 1729–1731, two chapels were added. The church was baroque reconstructed after the fires in 1749 and 1764, and the tower was raised.

The former Piarist monastery with the Church of Our Lady of Consolation was built in 1731–1752. Today it is used by the Orthodox Church.

The pilgrimage Church of Our Lady of Help is located on Uhlířský vrch. It is a large Baroque church built in 1755–1758, which replaced an old wooden chapel from 1654. A wide linden alley planted in 1770 leads to it, which is today a protected cultural monument.

<doc id="1314234" wikidata="Q1195354" url="?curid=1314234" title="Public holidays in Japan">
<text>were first established by the of 1948. It has since been amended 11 times to add additional holidays, the latest being in 2018, for a total of 16 recognized holidays. 

Article 3 of this law specifies that when a national holiday falls on a Sunday, the next working day shall become a public holiday, known as . Article 3 also determines that any day that falls between two other national holidays shall also become a holiday, known as . May 4, sandwiched between Constitution Memorial Day on May 3 and Children&#x27;s Day on May 5, was an annual example of such a holiday until it was replaced by Greenery Day in 2007.

Although it is not an official holiday, most companies voluntarily designate a holiday from December 29 to January 3, or, depending on the industry, from Christmas Eve to January 5. This case is unique in Asia.

==Table of Japanese holidays==
==Holidays in 2018–24==
The national holidays in 2018–2024 are as follows.

== Events of imperial mourning and celebration ==
In addition to the annual holidays listed above, certain events of celebration or mourning related to the imperial family are also treated as national holidays in the year in which they occur.

There have been six instances of such holidays since the introduction of the Public Holiday Law:
* April 10, 1959: Marriage of Crown Prince Akihito
* February 24, 1989: State Funeral of Emperor Shōwa (Hirohito)
* November 12, 1990: Official Enthronement Ceremony of the Emperor Emeritus (Akihito)
* June 9, 1993: Marriage of Crown Prince Naruhito
* April 30, 2019: Abdication of Emperor Akihito
* October 22, 2019: Official Enthronement Ceremony of the current Emperor (Naruhito)

==Recent changes==
Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend.

* Coming-of-Age Day: January 15 → 2nd Monday of January, starting in 2000.
* Marine Day: July 20 → 3rd Monday of July, starting in 2003.
* Respect for the Aged Day: September 15 → 3rd Monday of September, starting in 2003.
* Health and Sports Day: October 10 → 2nd Monday of October, starting in 2000.

In 2006, the country added Shōwa Day, a new national holiday, in place of Greenery Day on April 29, and to move Greenery Day to May 4. These changes took effect in 2007.

In 2014, the House of Councillors decided to add to the Japanese calendar on August 11, after lobbying by the Japanese Alpine Club. It is intended to coincide with the Bon Festival vacation time, giving Japanese people an opportunity to appreciate Japan&#x27;s mountains.

With the Japanese imperial transition, the Emperor&#x27;s Birthday was moved from December 23 to February 23 (the respective birthdays of Emperor Emeritus Akihito and Emperor Naruhito). Due to Akihito&#x27;s 2019 birthday being after his abdication but Naruhito&#x27;s before his accession, this holiday was not celebrated in 2019.

As special arrangement for the 2020 Summer Olympics, the 2020 dates for Marine Day, Sports Day, and Mountain Day were moved to July 23, July 24, and August 10 respectively. With the Olympics and Paralympics postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government left this change in place for 2020 and passed an amendment to the Olympic and Paralympic Special Measures Act to make a corresponding change to the holidays in 2021, moving them to July 22, July 23, and August 9 respectively.

<doc id="1314237" wikidata="Q4420081" url="?curid=1314237" title="Fort Lauderdale Airport station">
<text>Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport at Dania Beach station, or more commonly Fort Lauderdale Airport station, is a Tri-Rail commuter rail station in Dania Beach, Florida, located just west of Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport. The station is located at Gulfstream Way, adjacent to the interchange of I-95 and Griffin Road (SR 818). The station has two side platforms. A parking garage is located west of the southbound platform, while a small parking lot is east of the northbound platform. A pedestrian grade crossing connects between the two platforms at the north end of the station.

==History==
The Tri-Rail system was originally built with a Fort Lauderdale Airport station on Ravenswood Boulevard (Anglers Avenue) at SW 36th Street (Collins Road) at a cost of $806,000. It was directly across I-95 from the airport&#x27;s main runway. On January 3, 1989 – six days before the system opened on January 9 – Broward County aviation officials objected to the station being opened because it was located in the clear zone around the runway. (The Federal Aviation Administration did not object, as that agency&#x27;s authority extended only to regulating the height of structures near airports.) County commissioners then voted not to operate connecting bus service to the station and Tri-Rail postponed opening of the station. Due to internal miscommunication, some trains served the station on January 8.

Florida Department of Transportation and Broward County officials clashed over which agency was responsible for the station being built in the clear zone. Tri-Rail opened the station on March 10, 1989, promoting the county to vote on March 14 to withdraw support – which would have forced Tri-Rail to stop running – unless the station was closed. Local commentators called it a political maneuver, noting that frequently-congested I-95 was even closer to the runway than the station. The Tri-Rail board voted on March 17 to close the station on March 23. It temporarily reopened in May 1989 when the runway was closed for resurfacing. A replacement station opened at Tigertail Boulevard, about to the south, on July 17, 1989, at a cost of $268,000.

In 1996, the town of Dania Beach and Broward County swapped land to allow the county to build an access road to a new station site and the International Game Fish Association Hall of Fame and Museum. The new station, located about north of the Tigertail Road station site, opened on August 14, 2000. It was formally dedicated four days later. More elaborate than the earlier stations, the $3.3 million facility included octagonal pavilions, larger canopies, and a 200-space parking lot. Tri-Rail opened a 400-space parking garage at the station – the first parking garage on the system – in October 2010 to ease a parking shortage.

<doc id="1314242" wikidata="Q392815" url="?curid=1314242" title="Al-Ashraf Khalil">
<text>Al-Malik Al-Ashraf Salāh ad-Dīn Khalil ibn Qalawūn (; c. 1260s – 14 December 1293) was the eighth Turkic Bahri Mamluk sultan, succeeding his father Qalawun. He served from 12 November 1290 until his assassination in December 1293. He was well known for conquering the last of the Crusader states in Palestine after the siege of Acre in 1291. While walking with a friend, Khalil was attacked and assassinated by Baydara (his commander in chief) and his followers, who was then killed under the orders of Kitbugha.

==Early life==
Khalil&#x27;s exact year of birth is not known, although according to the Mamluk-era historian al-Safadi, he died &quot;in his thirties or less&quot;. He was the second son of Sultan Qalawun (r. 1279–1290) and his mother was a woman named Qutqutiya. Khalil had three brothers, as-Salih Ali, an-Nasir Muhammad and Ahmad, and two sisters. In 1284, Khalil married Ardukin, the daughter of Sayf ad-Din Nukih ibn Bayan, a Mongol emir of Qalawun. As-Salih Ali, al-Ashraf Khalil&#x27;s brother, married Ardukin&#x27;s sister, and both wives were chosen by Qalawun&#x27;s second wife because of their Mongol ethnicity, which was considered prestigious by the Mamluks. Khalil had two daughters with Ardukin, who are unnamed in the Mamluk sources.

Qalawun had proclaimed as-Salih Ali as his heir apparent in 1280. From that point on, as-Salih Ali&#x27;s name was added next to Qalawun&#x27;s name in treaties. Khalil&#x27;s name also began to be added to treaties in the regal style of &quot;al-Malik al-Ashraf&quot; starting in 1285 in the treaty between Qalawun and the king of Lesser Armenia. When as-Salih Ali died in 1288, Qalawun appointed al-Ashraf Khalil as his co-sultan. While al-Ashraf Khalil&#x27;s name was read alongside Qalawun&#x27;s name in the khutbah (Friday prayer sermon) and the emirs swore their allegiance to him, Qalawun did not sign the &quot;ahd&quot; (diploma of investiture) confirming al-Ashraf Khalil&#x27;s appointment. The reason for Qalawun&#x27;s apparent hesitance is not clear, but he may have considered al-Ashraf Khalil unsuitable for the sultanate or was wary of the enmity between al-Ashraf Khalil and the &quot;na&#x27;ib as-saltana&quot; (viceroy of Egypt), Emir Husam ad-Din Turuntay, who had been a strong advocate for as-Salih Ali&#x27;s accession.

==Reign==
Al-Ashraf Khalil succeeded Qalawun following the latter&#x27;s death on 9 November 1290. He prevented Qalawun&#x27;s burial for two months, either as a precaution to ensure his smooth succession or to wait until Qalawun&#x27;s mausoleum was completed. With his ascendancy, al-Ashraf Khalil absorbed his father&#x27;s roughly 6,000 Mansuriyya &quot;mamluks&quot; into his own 1,200-strong, mostly Circassian, &quot;mamluk&quot; corps, the Ashrafiyya. The Mansuriyya were the most powerful &quot;mamluk&quot; regiment in the sultanate and al-Ashraf Khalil sought to co-opt them.

In the royal procession following al-Ashraf Khalil&#x27;s accession to the throne, Turuntay launched an assassination attempt against al-Ashraf Khalil, but it failed. Instead, al-Ashraf Khalil had Turuntay imprisoned in the Cairo Citadel. After being heavily tortured for three days, Turuntay was put to death in November. He was briefly replaced by Emir Sanjar al-Shuja&#x27;i al-Mansuri until the latter was dispatched to Damascus and replaced by Emir Baydara. Al-Ashraf Khalil made Baydara &quot;na&#x27;ib as-saltana&quot; and &quot;atabeg al-asakir&quot; (commander in chief). The frequent exchanging of offices between the Mansuri emirs and their frequent imprisonment and release was a phenomenon that marked al-Ashraf Khalil&#x27;s three-year reign. According to historian Amir Mazor, &quot;Al-Ashraf Khalil&#x27;s policy toward the Mansuriyya was totally arbitrary, haphazard and lacked long-term political vision&quot;, but he nonetheless did not target the Mansuri &quot;mamluks&quot; as a faction and did not replace Mansuri officeholders with his Ashrafi &quot;mamluks&quot;.

===Conquest of Acre===

Qalawun had conquered the County of Tripoli in 1289 and made clear his determination to end the Crusader presence in Syria. In November 1290, he began his march toward Acre, the capital of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but died outside of Cairo shortly after. With the siege plans having already been prepared by Qalawun and his lieutenants, al-Ashraf Khalil resumed his father&#x27;s offensive on 2 March 1291. As he led the Mamluk army of Egypt, he sent orders to the Mamluk emirs of Syria, including the sultanate&#x27;s Ayyubid vassals in Hama under al-Muzaffar III Mahmud, to assemble their mangonels and head toward Acre. The other Syrian Mamluk armies were from Damascus (led by Lajin), Tripoli (led by Bilban) and al-Karak (led by Baibars al-Dawadar). There are no reliable figures for the size of the Mamluk army, but it was likely a significantly larger force than that of the Crusader defenders of Acre.

In May 1291, al-Ashraf Khalil&#x27;s army launched the assault against Acre. Heavy fighting ensued with the Knights Templar, which controlled the fortress. By 17 June, the Mamluks captured Acre, and a number of its inhabitants fled by sea. Remaining Crusader defenders held out in some of the towers in the city, but after further fighting they surrendered. Al-Ashraf Khalil ordered the execution of the remaining defenders and inhabitants. After abundant amounts of loot were plundered from the city by the Mamluk troops, al-Ashraf Khalil had Acre&#x27;s fortifications destroyed.

===Capture of other Crusader fortresses===
The news of the conquest of Acre reached Damascus and Cairo. Al-Ashraf Khalil entered the decorated city of Damascus with Franks chained at the feet and the captured crusader standards which were carried upside-down as a sign of their defeat. After celebrating his victory in Damascus, Khalil left for Cairo which was also decorated and celebrating. Arriving at Cairo, he ordered the release of Philip Mainebeuf and the men who accompanied him to Cairo earlier.

Following Acre&#x27;s capture, al-Ashraf Khalil and his generals proceeded to wrest control of the remaining Crusader-held fortresses along the Syrian coast. Within weeks, the Mamluks conquered Tyre, Sidon, Beirut, Haifa and Tartus. In August, the last Crusader outpost in Syria, the Templar fortress of Atlit south of Acre, was taken and on 7 August, al-Ashraf Khalil returned to Cairo in triumph as the &quot;final victor in the long struggle with the Crusaders&quot;, according to historian Peter Malcolm Holt.

In 1292, Al-Ashraf Khalil accompanied by his vizier Ibn al-Sal&#x27;us arrived in Damascus and then travelled via Aleppo to besiege the castle of &quot;Qal&#x27;at ar-Rum&quot; (Castle of the Romans) and was known as Hromgla in Armenian. &quot;Qal&#x27;at ar-Rum&quot;, which was the seat of the Patriarch of Armenia, was besieged by more than 30 catapults and was captured after 30 days by Khalil, who renamed it Qal&#x27;at al-Muslimin (Castle of the Muslims). Khalil left Emir al-Shuja‘i at the castle and returned to Damascus with prisoners. The population of Damascus bid farewell to the victorious Sultan on his way to Cairo at night with thousands of lighted candles. The Sultan entered Cairo through the Victory Gate (Bab al-Nasr) and was greeted by the celebrating population, also with thousands of lighted candles .

The Sultan returned to Damascus and assembled an army to invade Sis, the capital of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, but an Armenian embassy in Damascus had made terms with him first. Til Hemdun, Marash and Behesni were given to the Sultan in order to maintain peace. The Armenian kingdom had thus began to diminish much like its allied Crusader states.

The crusaders&#x27; kingdom of Jerusalem had already been destroyed by Saladin, Baibars and Qalawun, and Louis IX&#x27;s Seventh Crusade against Egypt ended in a complete failure, but the crusaders tried to keep their strongholds on the Syrian coast intact, hoping to be able one day to recapture what they had lost. Pope Nicholas IV tried to act but he died in 1292, and the European kings, who became involved in internal conflicts and struggles, became unable to organize new effective crusades. As for the Templars, they were accused of heresy in Europe and badly persecuted by King Philip IV of France and Pope Clement V.

=== Sack of Dongola ===
After the death of the Sultan of Egypt, Qalawun, and the ascension of his son, Sultan Khalil, to the throne of Egypt, the Kingdom of Makuria which had been conquered by the &quot;emirs&quot; Izz al-Din al-Kawrani, Izz al-Din Aidmar and Sanjar al-Masrouri in the Fourth battle of Dongola as ordered by Qalawun, and it annually sent the taxes and royalties imposed on it by Egypt in accordance with the ancient Baqt agreement. The Makurian king Samamoun thought that the new Egyptian Sultan was weak and young, and this was a great misconception on his part, and after a letter that was completely deceptive to al-Ashraf Khalil in which he said that due to the attacks of the Egyptian army on his kingdom during the reign of Qalawun and Baybars, the treasury of the Kingdom of Makuria has become empty and he will not be able to pay the imposed taxes and royalties. The Egyptian Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil was known for his temper, so he sent a letter full of threats and promises to the Makurian king, a letter that struck terror in Samamoun’s heart to the point that he described his country as being ruled by women. However, these words did not fool Sultan Khalil, who went on to order the movement of the Egyptian army under the leadership of &quot;emir&quot; Izz al-Din al-Afram, who moved from Cairo and arrived in Makuria and won a decisive victory over the Makurian forces. He entered the capital, Dongola, and plundered it completely. King Samamoun fled from Makuria as he had fled before in the campaigns of Qalawun.

=== Threatening the Republic of Venice with invasion ===
In 1292, Venetian pirates kidnapped Egyptian sailors and merchants in the Mediterranean Sea. This act angered al-Ashraf Khalil’s to the point that he began to actually think about invading the Republic of Venice, becoming the only Egyptian Sultan who thought about that. It was logical at the time that he would think about invading Venice, as the Egyptian army at that time was considered one of the strongest armies in the world and in less than 3 years, he eliminated the last 8 Crusader states in Palestine and invaded the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia. The Sultan, in light of his thoughts about invading Venice, gave orders to the Egyptian Navy to arrest any ship belonging to the Republic of Venice that entered the Egyptian coast, even if for the purpose of trade. In fact, the Egyptian Navy arrested Venetian ships that landed in Alexandria, and all their goods were seized and placed in the Egyptian treasury. The Sultan ordered the Venetian sailors and merchants to be placed in prisons. This made the Republic of Venice speak officially with the Sultanate of Egypt, and they sent a high-ranking official delegation with a lot of gifts. The delegation, when it met al-Ashraf Khalil, completely denied any relationship linking them to the pirates who kidnapped the Egyptian sailors, and that they did not know anything about this subject. Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil was very mad and was determined and told them that the Venetian prisoners will not be released except when the Egyptian sailors and merchants return. Later they reached an agreement in the end that the Venetians would pay a very large ransom to release their captives, in addition to that they would hand over the pirates to Egypt and return the kidnapped Egyptians. After that, the Venetians asked the Kingdom of Aragon to mediate with them in Egypt, and a peace treaty was concluded between the Sultanate of Egypt and the Republic of Venice through the mediation of the Spanish Kingdom of Aragon.

=== Incomplete Cyprus invasion ===
In late 1292, Cypriots kidnapped Egyptian sailors in the Mediterranean Sea. Al-Ashraf, who was known for his extreme pride and temper, ordered immediately to prepare and build 100 huge warships to invade all of Cyprus. He preferred to oversee the construction of these ships himself, and every now and then he would visit the ports and repeat the same sentence, with anger in his face:&quot;Cyprus... Cyprus... to the grave&quot; This means that Cyprus would be buried, but Al-Ashraf died before an invasion of Cyprus could be launched and not until the era of al-Ashraf Barsbay did the Mamluks launch a campaign against Cyprus.

=== Mongol threat ===
In 1293, Mongol ruler Gaykhatu sent his messengers with a threatening letter to the Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil saying:&quot;The Khan wishes to enter Aleppo and reside in it, it belongs to the conquests of his father Hulagu Khan by his sword, if you do not allow that, then he will cross to the Levant.&quot;Al-Ashraf Khalil immediately responded to them, while smiling and said:&quot;Alhamdulillah my brother the Khan agreed to what was in my mind and I talked about it with my princes that I request Baghdad from my brother, so if he does not allow that, I rode and conquered it with my troops, ravaged his country, killed his men, took it by force and appointed a representative there. Baghdad is the house of Islam and I wish to return it back to Islam but let him know we will see who enters whose country&#x27;s first.&quot;He took them out to where he had dropped them off and immediately wrote to the deputies of the Levant to prepare the accommodation and to get the soldiers ready to cross the Euphrates River and invade Baghdad. He presented to the princes and soldiers of Egypt to put on the war machine and come to Salah al-Din Square. Mongol messengers were sent to watch the soldiers. Most of the people of Cairo and Egypt went out to see the parade of the soldiers. It was a memorable day. The Sultan rode after the noon call to prayer, wearing a qarqal (an iron plate covered with brocade), and a keffiyeh over his head, and a shattaf in his hand. He entered the field, followed by the princes, one by one, with the latest war machines on them, and each of them carrying a spear on their robes. They fought and fled, displaying their war flags, until the afternoon call to prayer came.

This was the third military parade he presented during his sultanate. When their matter was over, he came down, took off his clothes, and made himself ready. He summoned the Mongol messengers and said to them:&quot;Inform my brother Gaykhatu that whoever has such soldiers with him does not stop entering your country or the country of others. I swear on my father&#x27;s grave, I will enter his place and destroy the homes of all the Mongols and make it an Islamic country until the Day of Resurrection, unless my time comes!&quot;Then he sent them back, and wrote urging the deputies, but his death was soon before he reached his hope following that.

=== Future ambitions ===
Al-Ashraf Khalil once stated that he has plans of invading Constantinople, Persia and Iraq:&quot;I am the king of the world and the sultan of the earth. God willing, we will conquer the East (Persia), the Rums (Byzantines; Constantinople), and Iraq, and we will possess the countries from the setting of the sun to the rising of the sun, and God will support me.&quot;

===Domestic conflicts and assassination===
Militarily, Al-Ashraf Khalil possessed the vigor and capability of two of his predecessors, Baibars and his father Qalawun. But many Emirs disliked him. He started his reign by executing and imprisoning a few prominent Emirs of his father, among them the vice-Sultan Turuntay. During the battle for Acre he arrested Hosam ad-Din Lajin and later after he returned to Cairo he executed Sunqur al-Ashqar, and a few Emirs. Khalil continued his father&#x27;s policy of replacing Turkish Mamluks with Circassians, a policy which contributed in the intensification of the rivalry among the Mamluks. After his victories against the Franks, arrogance got hold of al-Ashraf Khalil, he treated the Emirs roughly and began to sign messages and documents with the letter &quot;KH&quot; only. In addition, his Vizier Ibn al-Salus was envied by many Emirs and by the vice-Sultan Baydara in particular. Ibn al-Salus who, originally, was neither a Mamluk nor an Emir but a merchant from Damascus, became the most influential official during the reign of Khalil. While Al-Ashraf was rough on the Emirs, he was very generous towards Ibn al-Salus who did not treat the Emirs with respect. Ibn al-Salus was involved in the unjustly persecution of the supreme judge of Egypt Ibn Bint al-A&#x27;az, as he was involved in provoking the Sultan against Baydara on several occasions.

In December 1293, Al-Ashraf Khalil, accompanied by Ibn al-Salus, Baydara and other Emirs went to Turug in northern Egypt on a bird-hunting expedition. He sent Ibn Al-Salus to the nearby city of Alexandria to bring materials and to collect the taxes. Arriving at Alexandria, Ibn Al-Salus found out that the deputies of Baydara had already taken everything. On receiving a message from Ibn Al-Salus with this news, Al-Ashraf summoned Baydara to his &quot;Dihlis&quot; and insulted and threatened him in the presence of other Emirs. The distressed Baydar left the &quot;Dihlis&quot; and called Lajin, Qara Sunqur and other Emirs and together they decided to kill the Sultan. On 14 December, while the Sultan was walking with his friend Emir Shihab ad-Din Ahmad he was attacked and assassinated by Baydara and his followers. The Emirs who struck the Sultan after Baydara were Hosam ad-Din Lajin and Bahadir Ras Nubah followed by other Emirs. After the assassination of Al-Ashraf Khalil, Baydara and his followers went to the &quot;Dihliz&quot; and proclaimed Baydara the new Sultan. But Baydara was soon arrested by the Sultani Mamluks and Emirs. Baydara was killed by the Sultani Emirs led by Kitbugha and Baibars al-Jashnikir and his head was sent to Cairo. Ibn al-Salus was arrested in Alexandria and was sent to Cairo where he was mistreated and at last beaten to death. The Emirs who were involved in the assassination of Al-Ashraf Khalil were severely punished and executed. Lajin and Qara Sunqur fled and disappeared.

After the death of Al-Ashraf Khalil, the Emirs decided to install his 9-year-old brother Al-Nasir Muhammad as the new Sultan with Kitbugha as vice-Sultan and al-Shuja‘i as the new Vizier. But the death of Al-Ashraf Khalil was concealed for some time. While Al-Ashraf was dead, his brother Al-Nasir Muhammad was proclaimed Vice-Sultan and heir. A message from Egypt to the Syrian Emirs said: &quot;I appointed my brother al-Malik al-Nasir Muhammad as my Vicegerent and heir so that when I go to fight the enemy he replaces me &quot;. As soon as everything was under control the death of Al-Ahraf Khalil was revealed to the public in Egypt and Syria. He was buried in a mausoleum attached to a madrasa that he commissioned and built in 1288 (prior to his accession to the throne). His funerary complex, located in the Southern Cemetery of Cairo, is partly ruined today, though the domed structure over his tomb remains standing.

Al-Ashraf Khalil ruled about three years and two months. He had two daughters. Besides being remembered as the conqueror of Acre, he was remembered by Muslim historians as an intelligent Sultan who was fond of reading and learning.

==Coinage==
Coins of al-Ashraf Khalil were unique in Mamluk coinage history. New kinds of titles were inscribed on his coins, including: al-Sultan al-Malik al-Ashraf Salah al-Din Nasir al-Milah al-Muhamadiyah Muhyyi al-Dawalah al-Abasiyah (The Sultan King al-Ashraf Salah al-Din the Promoter of the Muhammadan Nation and the Revitalizer of the Abbasid Caliphate) and al-Sultan al-Malik al-Ashraf Salah al-Donya wa al-Din Qasim Amir al-mu&#x27;minin (The Sultan King al-Ashraf reform of temporal world and faith sharer of the Emir of the faithful), &quot;Emir of the faithful&quot; being the title of the Abbasid Caliph. His father Qalawun was also mentioned on Al-Ashraf&#x27;s coins as: Mawlana al-Sultan al-Malik al-Mansur (Our benefactor the Sultan King al-Mansur).

==History==

Archeological excavations have shown that the people lived in the area in the Paleolithic times. Other discoveries show occupation in the Bronze Age and the Hallstatt Culture period. During the Migration Period the area was slowly settled by Slavs in the 8th century.

The first written mention of Milevsko is from 1184 and three years later a Premonstratensian monastery was built. At the end of the 12th century, Milevsko was an important intersection of two trade routes. The following years were the time of prosperity and the monastery became one of the richest monasteries in the Bohemia. In 1327, Milevsko was first referred to as a market town, and in the 15th century, it became a town. The end of prosperity was caused by an attack of the Hussites, who burned the monastery down in 1420. After 1581 during the rule of Hodějovský of Hodějov, the monastery was rebuilt to a manor house. In 1622 after the Battle of White Mountain, the monastery was returned to Premonstrates of Strahov Monastery.

In the 17th and 18th centuries the town was struck by the bubonic plague. The town with its surroundings became one of the poorest regions in the kingdom, which lasted until the beginning of the 20th century. Traditional crafts developed here, especially pottery.

Until 1918, the town was a part of Austria-Hungary, a seat of the eponymous district, which was one of 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; of Bohemia.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
In Milevsko is a big machine factory ZVVZ (&quot;Závody na výrobu vzduchotechnických zařízení&quot; – the factory for the production of HVAC equipment).

==Transport==
The I/19 road (the section from Plzeň to Tábor) runs through the town.

Milevsko is located on the railway line Tábor–Písek.

==Sights==

The monastery complex consisting of several buildings is the main landmark. The Milevsko Monastery is the oldest in the South Bohemian Region. The Romanesque core is preserved to this day. The western part was rebuilt to the Baroque style and today it houses the regional Milevsko Museum.

The Church of Saint Giles is as old as the town. The massive bell tower and the north wall with a staircase have been preserved from the original Romanesque church. The church was rebuilt in Gothic style in the 14th century.

The historic town centre is made up of Dr. E. Beneše Square. Its landmarks are Old Town Hall, New Town Hall, and a church. The Church of Saint Bartholomew is a Neo-Romanesque building from 1844. The Old Town Hall was built in the Baroque style in the 17th century and today serves as a library, tourist information centre, gallery, and bank. The New Town Hall is a Neo-Renaissance building from 1901–1902 with sgraffito decoration of the facade from 1936.

<doc id="1314261" wikidata="Q44276" url="?curid=1314261" title="The Jewish War">
<text>The Jewish War is a work of Jewish history written by Josephus, a first-century Roman-Jewish historian. It has been described by the biblical historian Steve Mason as &quot;perhaps the most influential non-biblical text of Western history&quot;.

==Content==
Divided into seven books, it opens with a summary of Jewish history from the capture of Jerusalem by the Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes in 168 BC to the first stages of the First Jewish–Roman War (Books I and II). The next five books detail the unfolding of the war, under Roman generals Vespasian and Titus, to the death of the last Sicarii. The book was written about 75 AD, originally in Josephus&#x27; &quot;paternal tongue&quot; – either Aramaic or Hebrew – though this version has not survived. It was later translated into Greek, probably under the supervision of Josephus himself. Buth and Pierce wrote &quot;the current Greek edition does not appear to be a translation, but must be considered a new edition, a complete re-working of the first writing and likely a considerable expansion.&quot;

The sources of the First Jewish–Roman War are: this account of Josephus, the Talmud (Gittin 57b), Midrash Eichah, the Hebrew inscriptions on the Jewish coins minted, and Book V of Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot;.

The text also survives in an Old Slavonic version, as well as Hebrew which contains material not found in the Greek version, and which is lacking other material found in the Greek version.

==Influence==
Josephus was a popular writer among Christians in the fourth century and beyond as an independent historian to the events before, during, and after the life of Jesus of Nazareth. Josephus was always accessible in the Greek-reading Eastern Mediterranean. &quot;The Jewish War&quot; was translated into Latin () in the fourth century by Pseudo-Hegesippus in abbreviated form as well as by an unknown other in full, and both versions were widely distributed throughout the Western Roman Empire and its successor states. Christian interest in &quot;The Jewish War&quot; was largely out of interest in the downfall of the Jews and the Second Temple, which was one of the sources for the antisemitic trope of divine punishment for the crime of killing Jesus. Improvements in printing technology (the Gutenberg Press) led to the work receiving a number of new translations into the vernacular languages of Europe; the original Greek text was also published in Basel in 1544. In English, the most influential translations were Thomas Lodge&#x27;s 1602 translation (&quot;The Tragic History of the Jews&quot;), followed by William Whiston&#x27;s 1760s translation (&quot;The Wars of the Jews&quot;).

On the Jewish side, Josephus was far more obscure, as he was perceived as a traitor. Rabbinical writings for a millennium after his death (e.g. the Mishnah) almost never call out Josephus by name, although they sometimes tell parallel tales of the same events that Josephus narrated. An Italian Jew writing in the 10th century indirectly brought Josephus back to prominence among Jews: he authored the &quot;Yosippon&quot;, which paraphrases Pseudo-Hegesippus&#x27;s Latin version of &quot;The Jewish War&quot; (among other works), and included additional historical snippets at times. Jews generally distrusted Christian translations of Josephus until the 19th century, when sufficiently &quot;neutral&quot; vernacular language translations were made. Kalman Schulman finally created a translation of the Greek text of Josephus into Hebrew in 1863, although many rabbis continued to prefer the Yosippon version. By the 20th century, Jewish attitudes toward Josephus had softened, as Jews found parts of &quot;The Jewish War&quot; inspiring and favorable to the Jews. The last stand at Masada was seen as inspirational rather than tragic, for example. A 1938 / 1941 play, &quot;Jerusalem and Rome&quot;, was loosely based on &quot;The Jewish War&quot;, and various novels were written. These 20th century interpretations inevitably reflected the concerns of the era, unsurprisingly, such as the persecution of Jews in Russia and Nazi-era Europe, the nascent Zionist movement, and the situation of Jewish settlers in the British Mandate of Palestine.

For scholars, Josephus is and remains an invaluable resource for study of the Jewish-Roman war. While he is clearly deferential toward his Flavian dynasty Roman patrons, he is generally considered a relatively neutral source.

<doc id="1314272" wikidata="Q385599" url="?curid=1314272" title="Dirac comb">
<text>In mathematics, a Dirac comb (also known as sha function, impulse train or sampling function) is a periodic function with the formula
formula_1
for some given period formula_2. Here &quot;t&quot; is a real variable and the sum extends over all integers &quot;k.&quot; The Dirac delta function formula_3 and the Dirac comb are tempered distributions. The graph of the function resembles a comb (with the formula_3s as the comb&#x27;s &quot;teeth&quot;), hence its name and the use of the comb-like Cyrillic letter sha (Ш) to denote the function.

The symbol formula_5, where the period is omitted, represents a Dirac comb of unit period. This implies
formula_6

Because the Dirac comb function is periodic, it can be represented as a Fourier series based on the Dirichlet kernel:
formula_7

The Dirac comb function allows one to represent both continuous and discrete phenomena, such as sampling and aliasing, in a single framework of continuous Fourier analysis on tempered distributions, without any reference to Fourier series. The Fourier transform of a Dirac comb is another Dirac comb. Owing to the Convolution Theorem on tempered distributions which turns out to be the Poisson summation formula, in signal processing, the Dirac comb allows modelling sampling by &quot;multiplication&quot; with it, but it also allows modelling periodization by &quot;convolution&quot; with it.

== Dirac-comb identity ==

The Dirac comb can be constructed in two ways, either by using the &quot;comb&quot; operator (performing sampling) applied to the function that is constantly formula_8, or, alternatively, by using the &quot;rep&quot; operator (performing periodization) applied to the Dirac delta formula_3. Formally, this yields the following:
formula_10
where
formula_11 and formula_12

In signal processing, this property on one hand allows sampling a function formula_13 by &quot;multiplication&quot; with formula_14, and on the other hand it also allows the periodization of formula_13 by &quot;convolution&quot; with formula_16.
The Dirac comb identity is a particular case of the Convolution Theorem for tempered distributions.

== Scaling ==

The scaling property of the Dirac comb follows from the properties of the Dirac delta function. 
Since formula_17 for positive real numbers formula_18, it follows that:
formula_19
formula_20
Note that requiring positive scaling numbers formula_18 instead of negative ones is not a restriction because the negative sign would only reverse the order of the summation within formula_14, which does not affect the result.

== Fourier series ==

It is clear that formula_23 is periodic with period formula_2. That is,
formula_25
for all &quot;t&quot;. The complex Fourier series for such a periodic function is
formula_26
where (using distribution theory) the Fourier coefficients are
formula_27

All Fourier coefficients are 1/&quot;T&quot; resulting in
formula_28

When the period is one unit, this simplifies to 
formula_29
This is a divergent series, when understood as a series of ordinary complex numbers, but becomes convergent in the sense of distributions.

A &quot;square root&quot; of the Dirac comb is employed in some applications to physics, specifically:formula_30
However this is not a distribution in the ordinary sense.

== Fourier transform ==
The Fourier transform of a Dirac comb is also a Dirac comb. For the Fourier transform formula_31 expressed in frequency domain (Hz) the Dirac comb formula_32 of period formula_2 transforms into a rescaled Dirac comb of period formula_34 i.e. for
:formula_35 
:formula_36
is proportional to another Dirac comb, but with period formula_37 in frequency domain (radian/s). The Dirac comb formula_38 of unit period formula_39 is thus an eigenfunction of formula_31 to the eigenvalue formula_41

This result can be established by considering the respective Fourier transforms formula_42 of the family of functions formula_43 defined by

:formula_44

Since formula_43 is a convergent series of Gaussian functions, and Gaussians transform into Gaussians, each of their respective Fourier transforms formula_46 also results in a series of Gaussians, and explicit calculation establishes that

:formula_47

The functions formula_43 and formula_46 are thus each resembling a periodic function consisting of a series of equidistant Gaussian spikes formula_50 and formula_51 whose respective &quot;heights&quot; (pre-factors) are determined by slowly decreasing Gaussian envelope functions which drop to zero at infinity. Note that in the limit formula_52 each Gaussian spike becomes an infinitely sharp Dirac impulse centered respectively at formula_53 and formula_54 for each respective formula_55 and formula_56, and hence also all pre-factors formula_57 in formula_58 eventually become indistinguishable from formula_59. Therefore the functions formula_43 and their respective Fourier transforms formula_58 converge to the same function and this limit function is a series of infinite equidistant Gaussian spikes, each spike being multiplied by the same pre-factor of one, i.e., the Dirac comb for unit period:

:formula_62 and formula_63

Since formula_64, we obtain in this limit the result to be demonstrated:
:formula_65
The corresponding result for period formula_2 can be found by exploiting the scaling property of the Fourier transform,
:formula_67

Another manner to establish that the Dirac comb transforms into another Dirac comb starts by examining continuous Fourier transforms of periodic functions in general, and then specialises to the case of the Dirac comb. In order to also show that the specific rule depends on the convention for the Fourier transform, this will be shown using angular frequency with formula_68 for any periodic function formula_69 its Fourier transform
:formula_70 obeys:
:formula_71
because Fourier transforming formula_13 and formula_73 leads to formula_74 and formula_75 This equation implies that formula_76 nearly everywhere with the only possible exceptions lying at formula_77 with formula_78 and formula_79 When evaluating the Fourier transform at formula_80 the corresponding Fourier series expression times a corresponding delta function results. For the special case of the Fourier transform of the Dirac comb, the Fourier series integral over a single period covers only the Dirac function at the origin and thus gives formula_37 for each formula_82 This can be summarised by interpreting the Dirac comb as a limit of the Dirichlet kernel such that, at the positions formula_77 all exponentials in the sum formula_84 point into the same direction and add constructively. In other words, the continuous Fourier transform of periodic functions leads to
:formula_85 with formula_86
and
:formula_87
The Fourier series coefficients formula_88 for all formula_89 when formula_90, i.e. 
:formula_91
is another Dirac comb, but with period formula_92 in angular frequency domain (radian/s).

As mentioned, the specific rule depends on the convention for the used Fourier transform. Indeed, when using the scaling property of the Dirac delta function, the above may be re-expressed in ordinary frequency domain (Hz) and one obtains again:
formula_93

such that the unit period Dirac comb transforms to itself:
formula_94

Finally, the Dirac comb is also an eigenfunction of the unitary continuous Fourier transform in angular frequency space to the eigenvalue 1 when formula_95 because for the unitary Fourier transform 
:formula_96
the above may be re-expressed as 
formula_97

==Sampling and aliasing==

Multiplying any function by a Dirac comb transforms it into a train of impulses with integrals equal to the value of the function at the nodes of the comb. This operation is frequently used to represent sampling.
formula_98

Due to the self-transforming property of the Dirac comb and the convolution theorem, this corresponds to convolution with the Dirac comb in the frequency domain.
formula_99

Since convolution with a delta function formula_100 is equivalent to shifting the function by formula_101, convolution with the Dirac comb corresponds to replication or periodic summation:
:formula_102

This leads to a natural formulation of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. If the spectrum of the function formula_103 contains no frequencies higher than B (i.e., its spectrum is nonzero only in the interval formula_104) then samples of the original function at intervals formula_105 are sufficient to reconstruct the original signal. It suffices to multiply the spectrum of the sampled function by a suitable rectangle function, which is equivalent to applying a brick-wall lowpass filter.
:formula_106

:formula_107

In time domain, this &quot;multiplication with the rect function&quot; is equivalent to &quot;convolution with the sinc function.&quot; Hence, it restores the original function from its samples. This is known as the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula.

Remark: Most rigorously, multiplication of the rect function with a generalized function, such as the Dirac comb, fails. This is due to undetermined outcomes of the multiplication product at the interval boundaries. As a workaround, one uses a Lighthill unitary function instead of the rect function. It is smooth at the interval boundaries, hence it yields determined multiplication products everywhere, see , Theorem 22 for details.

== Use in directional statistics ==
In directional statistics, the Dirac comb of period formula_108 is equivalent to a wrapped Dirac delta function and is the analog of the Dirac delta function in linear statistics.

In linear statistics, the random variable formula_109 is usually distributed over the real-number line, or some subset thereof, and the probability density of formula_103 is a function whose domain is the set of real numbers, and whose integral from formula_111 to formula_112 is unity. In directional statistics, the random variable formula_113 is distributed over the unit circle, and the probability density of formula_114 is a function whose domain is some interval of the real numbers of length formula_108 and whose integral over that interval is unity. Just as the integral of the product of a Dirac delta function with an arbitrary function over the real-number line yields the value of that function at zero, so the integral of the product of a Dirac comb of period formula_108 with an arbitrary function of period formula_108 over the unit circle yields the value of that function at zero.

<text>Vlasic is an American brand of pickles that is currently owned by Conagra Brands. Since its introduction in 1942, it has become one of the most popular pickle brands in the United States.

==History==
Franjo &quot;Frank&quot; Vlašić, a Bosnian Croat, emigrated from Livno, Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the time part of Austria-Hungary, to Detroit, Michigan in 1912 and started a small creamery with savings from his factory job. His son Joseph acquired a milk route in 1922, which eventually grew into the state&#x27;s largest dairy distributor. In 1937, Vlasic was approached to distribute a home-style pickle, later marketing their fresh-packed pickle in glass jars. Its first plant was built in Imlay City, Michigan. The business rapidly expanded in the post-war years, corresponding with growth in per capita pickle consumption.

A child-bearing stork was introduced as a mascot in 1974, merging the stork baby mythology with the notion that pregnant women have an above average appetite for pickles. Vlasic marketed themselves as &quot;the pickle pregnant women crave...after all, who&#x27;s a better pickle expert?&quot; The modern Vlasic Stork speaks in a style reminiscent of Groucho Marx and holds a pickle like a cigar. The original voice was Ron Masak, since replaced by Doug Preis.

Vlasic Pickles was sold to Campbell Soup Company in 1978. It was spun off to &quot;Vlasic Foods International&quot; on March 30, 1998.

On April 13, 1999, the company introduced the Vlasic Hamburger Stackers, made from naturally grown but specially cultivated cucumbers long and over in diameter, which enabled a single pickle chip to cover an entire hamburger.

In early 2001, the company voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and its pickle and barbecue sauce units were initially planned to be sold to H. J. Heinz. By April of 2001, the company had backed out of the deal and was looking into other offers.

Vlasic is owned by Pinnacle Foods, a subsidiary of Conagra Brands, since its name change in 2001. The Vlasic Stork was shown in &quot;Icons&quot;, a MasterCard commercial during Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005 where he and many other famous advertising icons from food and cleaning equipment are shown having dinner together.

On April 10, 2019 at the Conagra Brands Investor Day event, Tom McGough, Conagra Co-Chief Operating Officer, announced that Vlasic Pickle Chips, made from vacuum-fried pickles, were in development. 

The cucumbers used in Vlasic pickles are grown in Michigan, including the cities of Mount Pleasant and Kalamazoo, and processed at its plant in Imlay City, Michigan.

<text>Kingsmeadow is a football stadium in Norbiton, Kingston upon Thames, London, which is used for home matches by Chelsea Women and Chelsea Development Squad. It was formerly the home of Kingstonian and AFC Wimbledon and has a capacity of 4,850 with 2,265 seats.

== History ==
The stadium was the home of Kingstonian from 1989, when they built the entire complex on the site following the sale of their former Richmond Road ground. Kingstonian opened the ground with a friendly against Queens Park Rangers. Following relegation from the Conference, Kingstonian went into financial administration and both the club and ground were purchased by Rajesh Khosla and his son Anup.

AFC Wimbledon played at the stadium from their foundation in 2002 until their move to a new stadium on Plough Lane in 2020; Wimbledon having moved to Milton Keynes in September 2003, becoming Milton Keynes Dons in June 2004. AFC Wimbledon were in the Combined Counties League at this time, but reached Football League One in 2016.
After one season as tenants of the Khoslas, AFC Wimbledon undertook to buy the leasehold of the ground. The club&#x27;s owners, the Dons Trust, launched a share issue to finance the purchase, which was closed the following summer. The club subsequently arranged for a commercial loan to clear the remaining debt to the Khoslas. Upon taking over the ground, its name was changed to the Fans&#x27; Stadium which remains the nickname of the ground today.

In November 2015, AFC Wimbledon supporters backed a proposal to sell the ground to Chelsea, who were interested in using the ground for its youth teams and women&#x27;s team. The sale was hugely detrimental to Kingstonian, with them unable to play in a ground that was now too big and expensive for a non-league side and over which they no longer had any control. Kingstonian started a groundshare with Leatherhead in 2017–8, and then moved to King George&#x27;s Field in Tolworth, sharing with Corinthian Casuals from the 2018–19 season.

Kingsmeadow became the new home of Chelsea Women, beginning with the 2017–18 FA WSL season. AFC Wimbledon departed Kingsmeadow for the new Plough Lane stadium in May 2020.

==Ownership==
The freehold of the site is owned by Kingston Council. The leasehold, which safeguards the site for the borough&#x27;s football team, was originally held by Kingstonian. After Kingstonian entered administration to avoid bankruptcy and lost the Kingsmeadow lease in October 2001, it was assigned in April 2002 by the administrators to a property developer, Rajesh Khosla, who was also by then owner of the club. In June 2003, he sold the lease to AFC Wimbledon, who at the time were already sub-tenants at the ground. Kingstonian secured a 25-year sub-tenancy agreement with AFC Wimbledon, with customary break clauses. The two clubs then operated a ground-sharing arrangement until 2017, with Kingstonian receiving preferentially cheap rental terms. The ground underwent various structural improvements and expansion during this period.

The ground&#x27;s lease is currently owned by Chelsea, having purchased it from AFC Wimbledon in 2015, in order to use it for their women&#x27;s and youth sides. Chelsea Women moved in for the start of the 2017–18 FA WSL 1 season.

==Structure and facilities==

Kingsmeadow comprises the following stands (as they were named under AFC Wimbledon sponsorship):

* John Green Stand – (formerly the &quot;Nongshim Stand&quot;) a newly built, covered behind-the-goal all-seater stand with 1,000 seats. It was first sponsored by Nong Shim Ltd., South Korea&#x27;s largest processed food manufacturer, whose UK head office is based locally in New Malden. The rebuilding of the stand increased the stadium capacity to approximately 4,850. It was renamed the &quot;John Green Stand&quot; for the 2015 season after the American author, whose keen interest in the team has led to a sponsorship agreement. Before the start of the 2015–16 season the club installed a camera gantry above the stand in order to get different angles for replays to be shown on Dons Player.
* Paul Strank Stand – the all-seater main stand with 1,265 seats, which also includes the stadium&#x27;s changing rooms, offices, three bars and other facilities. The main stand was extended during the 2008–09 season, adding more seats and also extending the roof to provide better protection from rain. It was also renamed the Paul Strank Stand at this time, after a supporter and benefactor of AFC Wimbledon.
* RyGas Stand – (formerly the &quot;East Stand&quot; and &quot;Your Golf Travel Stand&quot;) is a partially covered shallow terrace along the length of the pitch, opposite the main Paul Strank Stand. This stand also holds the camera gantry at the stadium as well as the scoreboard. 
* Chemflow End – (formerly the &quot;Athletics End&quot; and the &quot;Tempest End&quot;) a covered behind-the-goal deep terrace. Its original name came from the Kingston Athletics Centre which sits directly behind the stand. The terrace was covered during the 2005–06 season and renamed the Tempest End in recognition of the sponsorship of Tempest Sports, Wimbledon&#x27;s exclusive kit manufacturer since the club&#x27;s inception, who had partially paid for the development. For the 2013–14 season the stand was renamed the EcoHouse End in a new sponsorship deal with the now defunct EcoHouse Group, which had its main European office in nearby Richmond. During 2016 the stand was renamed the Chemflow End in another sponsorship deal.

As of October 2012, the stadium had a capacity of 4,850. It originally was designated to have a 6,299 capacity before modern safety requirements and ground improvements (such as re-profiling the Athletics End terrace and replacing the original terraced paddock in front of the main stand with seats) required the capacity to be reduced. Kingstonian&#x27;s highest attendance at Kingsmeadow was 4,582 for a friendly against Chelsea on 22 July 1995. AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s highest attendance at Kingsmeadow and the ground&#x27;s overall record attendance was 4,870 against Accrington Stanley on 14 May 2016.

The stadium is adjacent to an athletics stadium used by Kingston Athletic Club and Polytechnic Harriers.

<doc id="1314290" wikidata="Q430864" url="?curid=1314290" title="Nymburk">
<text>Nymburk (; ) is a town in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 16,000 inhabitants. It is situated on the Elbe River. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
Nymburk consists of five municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):
*Nymburk (13,944)
*Drahelice (853)

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the Middle High German expression &quot;ze der Niuwen Burk&quot;, meaning &quot;at the new castle&quot;. The name was soon transcribed into Czech as Nymburk.

==Geography==
Nymburk is located about east of Prague. It lies in a flat landscape in the Central Elbe Table within the Polabí lowland. The town is situated on both banks of the Elbe River and lies at the confluence of the Elbe and Mrlina rivers. The Výrovka River briefly crosses the municipal territory in the southwest.

==History==
The town was founded around 1275 by King Ottokar II. Throughout the Middle Ages it was one of the most important and strategic towns in the kingdom, as it protected Prague and was an important pillar of royal power.

During the reign of King Wenceslaus II, the Gothic Church of St. Nicholas (today the Church of St. Giles) and the Dominican monastery were constructed. The town was surrounded by burnt-brick walls with about fifty towers and two defensive ditches fed from the Elbe. The Hussite Wars in the 15th century affected the town only slightly (the Dominican monastery was looted) and so the town prospered until the beginning of the 17th century.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Nymburk was burned and looted, and the fortifications were almost completely destroyed. The recovery was disrupted by large fires. The turning point in the town&#x27;s modern history was the introduction of the railway in 1870. Since then, the town has grown, new buildings have been built, the Elbe river has been regulated, and a new bridge and a hydroelectric power plant with a lock chamber have been built. The town has expanded beyond the medieval walls (some portions of which have been preserved). However, the original medieval floor plan has been completely preserved.

==Demographics==
==Economy==

The Nymburk Brewery, located on the southern end of the town, was founded in 1895. With a production of about 200,000 hl/year, it is considered a medium-sized brewery in the Czech Republic. The brewery produces beer under the brand Postřižinské.

JDK is a large company that manufactures refrigeration equipment in Nymburk and exports it all over the world. Since 2005, the Chinese company Changhong has used a factory in Nymburk for the final assembly of LCD TVs for the European market.

==Transport==

Nymburk is a railway junction at the crossing of several railway lines: Prague–Kolín, Prague–Trutnov, Kolín–Rumburk, Nymburk–Mladá Boleslav, Nymburk–Rožďalovice and Nymburk–Poříčany.

The I/38 road from Mladá Boleslav to Kolín passes through the town.

==Sport==
The town is home to Basketball Nymburk, the most successful club of the Czech National Basketball League. It plays its home games at the &quot;Sportovní centrum&quot;.

Since 2015, an annual international rink bandy tournament has taken place in Nymburk. In 2017, the Federation of International Bandy decided to make the Nymburk tournament official.

The town&#x27;s football club is SK Polaban Nymburk.

==Sights==

The dominant feature of the town is the Gothic brick Church of Saint Giles, built in 1280–1380. This church, together with the preserved buildings of the Nymburk fortification, is a unique example of brick Gothic (originally North German) architecture in the Czech lands. The main landmark of the square is a rare Renaissance town hall from 1526.

Besides the preserved sections of the town walls, the town also features a road bridge from 1913, which connects the town centre with the neighborhood of Zálabí. Other important cultural monuments of Nymburk are the Turkish tower (the former waterworks from 1597), the Plague column (built in 1717), the Chapel of St. John of Nepomuk (originally a part of the Dominican monastery), the Bohumil Hrabal Grammar School, the Nymburk Synagogue, the Tourist Information Centre, the water tower and the Old Fisher House.

==In literature==
Bohumil Hrabal, who grew up in the town, wrote about Nymburk in his books &quot;The Little Town Where Time Stood Still, Cutting It Short, Beautiful Sadness, Harlequin&#x27;s Millions&quot; and &quot;Closely Watched Trains&quot;.

==Notable people==
*Bohuslav Matěj Černohorský (1684–1742), composer and organist
*Josef Kramolín (1730–1802), painter
*Antonín Janoušek (1877–1941), journalist and politician

<text>Jean Baptiste Douville (1794–1837), French traveller, was born at Hambye, in the department of Manche. Having at an early age inherited a fortune, he decided to gratify his taste for foreign travel. According to his own profession he visited India, Kashmir, Khorasan, Persia, Asia Minor and many parts of Europe. In 1826 he went to South America, and in 1827 left Brazil for the Portuguese possessions on the West Coast of Africa, where his presence in March 1828 is proved by the mention made of him in letters of Castello Branco, the governor-general of Luanda.

In May 1831 he reappeared in France, claiming to have pushed his explorations into the very heart of central Africa. His story was readily accepted by the Société de Géographie of Paris, which hastened to recognize his services by assigning him the great gold medal, and appointing him their secretary for the year 1832. On the publication of his narrative, &quot;Voyage au Congo et dans l&#x27;interieur de l&#x27;Afrique Equinoxiale&quot;, which occupied three volumes and was accompanied by an elaborate atlas, public enthusiasm ran high.

Before the year 1832 was out, however, it was established that Douville&#x27;s voyage was romance and not verity. He had probably been inspired by the appearance of René Caillié&#x27;s account of his journey to Timbuktu, and wished to obtain a share of the fame attaching to African explorers. Douville tried vainly to establish the truth of his story in &quot;Ma Defense&quot; (1832), and &quot;Trente Mois de ma Vie, ou Quinze Mois avant et Quinze Mois aprés ma Voyage au Congo&quot; (1833).

Mile Audrun, a lady to whom he was about to be married, committed suicide from grief at the disgrace; and the adventurer withdrew in 1833 to Brazil, and proceeded to make explorations in the Amazon Basin. According to Dr G. Gardner, in his &quot;Travels in the Interior of Brazil&quot; (1846), he was murdered in 1837 on the banks of the São Francisco River for charging too high for his medical assistance. Douville may well have explored part of the province of Angola, and Sir Richard Burton maintained that the Frenchman&#x27;s descriptions of the country of the Congo were lifelike; that his observations on the anthropology, ceremonies, customs and maladies of the people were remarkably accurate; and that even the native words used in his narrative were &quot;for the most part given with unusual correctness.&quot; It has been shown, however, that the chief source of Douville&#x27;s inspiration was a number of unpublished Portuguese manuscripts to which he had access.

==Bibliography==
His published journals include:

*&quot;Un voyage au Congo, 1827-1828: les tribulations d’un aventurier en Afrique équinoxiale.&quot; édition établie et présentée par Chantal Edel. Paris: La Table ronde, c1991. ()
*&quot;Voyage au Congo et dans l’intérieur de l’Afrique équinoxiale, fait dans les années 1828, 1829 et 1830.&quot; Paris: Chez J. Renouard, 1832. (3 volumes)

<text>Fort Lauderdale station is a train station in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It is served by Tri-Rail and Amtrak. The station is located on Southwest 21st Terrace, just south of West Broward Boulevard. The station has two side platforms connected by an elevated passageway. The station building, parking lot, and bus stops are located west of the southbound platform.

== History ==

The original station, which is used by Amtrak, is a former Seaboard Air Line Railway depot built in 1927. Designed in the prevalent Mediterranean Revival style by Gustav Maass of the West Palm Beach architectural firm Harvey &amp; Clarke, it is virtually identical to the Hollywood Seaboard station to the south. The station took the place of a temporary structure that had been hastily erected at the end of 1926 to greet the January 1927 arrival of the first Seaboard passenger train in South Florida, the &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;.

The station was served by the &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot; until 1953 and, among other Seaboard trains, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; beginning in 1939. Amtrak maintained &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; service to the station when it took over intercity passenger train service in 1971. Both the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Floridian&quot; continue to use the station.

On January 9, 1989, the Tri-County Commuter Rail Authority began Tri-Rail service to the station, building additional facilities and a pedestrian overpass just north of the original station. A park and ride lot is available, and is directly accessible via a proprietary exit from Interstate 95 north.

The station consists of a passenger waiting room on the northern end and a baggage room in the center section. On the southern end is a freight room, which is used by CSX, the successor to Seaboard. Just south of the street side entry to the passenger waiting room, and representative of the racial segregation laws of the era in which the station was constructed, is the entrance to what had been the &quot;colored&quot; waiting room.

On November 10, 2024, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; was merged with the as the &quot;Floridian&quot;.

<text>George Phydias Mitchell (May 21, 1919 – July 26, 2013) was an American businessman, real estate developer and philanthropist from Texas credited with pioneering the economic extraction of shale gas.

==Early life==
Mitchell was born to Greek immigrant parents in the port city of Galveston, Texas in 1919. His father, Savvas Paraskevopoulos, was from the village of Nestani in Arcadia, tended goats before immigrating to the United States in 1901, arriving at Ellis Island at the age of 20. He worked for railroads, and gradually moved west. When a paymaster got tired of writing his long name and threatened to fire him, Mr. Paraskevopoulos took the paymaster&#x27;s name, Mike Mitchell. Mike Mitchell settled in Galveston, where he ran a succession of shoe-shining and pressing shops. When he saw the picture of a beautiful woman in a local Greek newspaper, he headed for Florida, where she had settled, according to family lore. He persuaded her to abandon her fiancé and marry him. They lived above the shoeshine shop.

==Oil and gas business==
In 1940, George Mitchell earned a degree in petroleum engineering with an emphasis in geology from Texas A&amp;M University. He graduated as the valedictorian in his class and was also the captain of the men&#x27;s tennis team.

He started an independent oil and gas company, Mitchell Energy &amp; Development Corp., which grew into a Fortune 500 company. He participated in the development of about 10,000 wells, including more than 1000 wildcat wells.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the company experimented with application of different techniques of hydraulic fracturing of the Barnett Shale of Texas, eventually finding the right technique to economically extract the natural gas in the formation. The approach was widely adopted by the gas industry and spawned a new gas boom in North America. The Potential Gas Committee estimates that U.S. recoverable reserves will last 118 years at current production levels. but production is expected to more than triple by 2020. Because of the technological progress in industry fracking, George Mitchell is now known as the &quot;pioneer of shale&quot;. Mitchell Energy &amp; Development Corp. was later acquired by Devon Energy.

==Real estate development==
Mitchell was the developer of The Woodlands, an unincorporated yet governmentally structured township in Montgomery County, Texas, which he developed from timberland located 32 miles north of downtown Houston. He brought on landscape architect Ian McHarg to consult on the project. The master plan for the community called for preserving trees, protecting the environment, minimizing flooding and creating a &quot;pleasant&quot; urban environment. In 2010, The Woodlands was home to 97,000 people. When fully developed the population will have reached 130,000. 

He and his wife Cynthia played a major role in the revitalization of his hometown of Galveston. 

==Philanthropy==

Mitchell and his wife Cynthia, along with the Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation, have distributed or pledged more than $900 million in grants to causes, programs, and institutions.

The vast majority of this amount is related to science, environmental sustainability, and sustainability science-related fields, including the foundation&#x27;s current grant-making programs which focus on sustainability science, clean energy, water, and natural gas sustainability.

On December 7, 2010, he joined the Giving Pledge sponsored by Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates, making public his and Cynthia&#x27;s long-held private intent that the majority of their wealth would be donated to charitable causes.

According to the National Academies of Science, &quot;In the 1970s [Mitchell] helped sponsor the work of Dennis Meadows, whose Club of Rome study &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; was a global wake-up call on the pressing need for sustainable energy technologies and food sources worldwide.&quot;

Working with Meadows and other national leaders Mitchell created The Woodlands Conference series and the International George and Cynthia Mitchell Prize, both dedicated to sustainable development. He was particularly interested in the role of the business community in creating sustainable societies and he himself is &quot;a model of linking entrepreneurial success to the sustainability movement&quot;. The Mitchells also underwrote the National Academies&#x27; Our Common Journey: A Transition Toward Sustainability, the 1999 report that defined the role of science and technology in moving toward sustainability. As a follow-up to Our Common Journey, Mitchell donated $20 million to create the George and Cynthia Mitchell Endowment for Sustainability Science at the National Academy of Sciences committed to advancing science and technology in support of sustainable development. Mitchell also founded the Houston Advanced Research Center that explores strategies for sustainable development at the regional level. He donated $25 million to the Endowment for Regional Sustainability Science to support HARC&#x27;s work in sustainability science. Mitchell donated part of his wealth to the Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation, which supports programs for the efficient and wise use of Earth&#x27;s resources.

Enabled by Mitchell&#x27;s donation of $35 million, the Texas A&amp;M University Physics department relocated to two new buildings in late 2009: The George P. and Cynthia W. Mitchell Fundamental Physics and Astronomy Building and the George P. Mitchell Physics Building. In 2012, he committed an additional $20 million to the Mitchell Institute for Fundamental Physics and Astronomy. This donation was the latest in a series supporting science and the physics department in particular. With previous gifts supporting academic chairs, professorships and the Giant Magellan Telescope project, the Mitchells are Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s most generous modern benefactors, with donations totaling nearly $100 million; by 2011, his total contributions to universities and research organizations had reached $159 million.

Mitchell and his wife were also major supporters of Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s marine studies-oriented branch campus Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston (TAMUG), donating the land for the main campus and the main campus is named in honor of Mitchell&#x27;s father. Mitchell made numerous other gifts to the university over the years, including the donation of a yacht named S.V. Cynthia Woods named after his wife Cynthia.

Mitchell had a lifelong passion for tennis, and the tennis center at Texas A&amp;M University, where he was captain of the tennis team, was named in his honor. Built for an estimated $4.2 million, the official ribbon cutting ceremony was held on October 23, 1998. 

In 1984, he was the recipient of an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Houston.

==Personal life==
In 2004, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated his net worth as $1.6 billion, placing him among the 500 richest people worldwide. Mitchell died at the age of 94 on July 26, 2013, at his home in Galveston of natural causes, while surrounded by relatives. He was predeceased by his wife, Cynthia, who died on December 27, 2009, and his two brothers, Christie and Johnny. He was survived by his sister, Maria Mitchell Ballantyne; his ten children, daughters Pamela Maguire, Meredith Dreiss and Sheridan Lorenz, and sons Scott, Mark, Kent, Greg, Kirk, Todd and Grant; 23 grandchildren, 5 great grandchildren and 19 nieces and nephews.

<text>Edgar Gómez (born October 4, 1944) is a Puerto Rican jazz double bassist, known for his work with the Bill Evans Trio from 1966 to 1977.

==Biography==
Gómez moved with his family from Puerto Rico at a young age to New York, where he was raised. He started on double bass in the New York City school system at the age of eleven and at age thirteen went to the New York City High School of Music &amp; Art. He played in the Newport Festival Youth Band (led by Marshall Brown) from 1959 to 1961, and graduated from Juilliard in 1963.

He has played with musicians such as Gerry Mulligan, Marian McPartland, Paul Bley, Tania Maria, Steps Ahead, and Chick Corea. He spent a total of eleven years with the Bill Evans Trio, which included performances in the United States, Europe and Asia, as well as dozens of recordings.

His career mainly consists of working as an accompanist, a position suited for his quick reflexes and flexibility. In addition to working as a studio musician for many famous jazz musicians, he has recorded as a leader for Columbia Records, Projazz and Stretch. Many of his recent recordings as a leader are co-led by the jazz pianist Mark Kramer.

In May 2013, Gómez was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music in Valencia, Spain. This was the first honorary doctorate granted at the college&#x27;s new international campus in Spain.

<text>The hoolock gibbons are three primate species of genus Hoolock in the gibbon family, Hylobatidae, native to eastern Bangladesh, Northeast India, Myanmar, and Southwest China.

==Description==
Hoolocks are the second-largest of the gibbons, after the siamang. They reach a size of 60 to 90 cm and weigh 6 to 9 kg. The sexes are about the same size, but they differ considerably in coloration; males are black-colored with remarkable white brows, while females have a grey-brown fur, which is darker at the chest and neck. White rings around their eyes and mouths give their faces a mask-like appearance. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; says that the name &quot;hoolock&quot; is from &quot;a language of Assam.&quot;

==Distribution==

In northeast India, the hoolock is found south of Brahmaputra and the North Bank areas and east of the Dibang Rivers. Its range extends into seven states covering Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura (The seven northeastern states of India). The species are protected in India in the Hollongapar Gibbon sanctuary, which support 125 Individuals of the species, as of 2023. In Bangladesh, the western hoolock gibbons were distributed across 35 forest fragments. The largest of these (Lawachara and Kaptai) supported 42 and 84 individuals respectively, but 17 of the fragments had less than ten individuals. For a better overview the forest fragments are grouped into 13 areas. All areas are located within Chittagong and Sylhet divisions, mostly near the eastern border of the country. In China, in historical times, the skywalker gibbon was recorded in nine counties in the west bank of the Salween River in westernmost Yunnan province. Based on more recent interview surveys conducted in October–November 2008 and field surveys conducted in Mar, Apr, and Aug 2009, the current Chinese population of hoolock gibbons was found to be restricted to three counties (Baoshan, Tengchong, and Yingjiang). The population size was estimated to be less than 200 individuals. In Myanmar, all three species of hoolock gibbon can be found in the forested areas west of Thanlwin river. Of all four distribution countries, Myanmar holds the key population of all three species.

==Behaviour and diet==
Like the other gibbons, they are diurnal and arboreal, brachiating through the trees with their long arms. They live together in monogamous pairs, which stake out a territory. Their calls serve to locate family members and ward off other gibbons from their territory. Their diet consists mainly of fruits, insects and leaves.

==Breeding and lifecycle==
Young hoolocks are born after a 7-month gestation, with milky white or buff-colored hair. After about 6 months, the hair of males darkens and turns black, while the females&#x27; hair remains buff-colored throughout their lives. After 8–9 years, they are fully mature and their fur reaches its final coloration. Their life expectancy in the wild is about 25 years.

==Classification==
The classification of this gibbon has changed several times in the past few years. Classically, all gibbons were classified in the genus &quot;Hylobates&quot;, with the exception of the siamang. After some studies, the genus was divided into three subgenera (including the siamangs &quot;Symphalangus&quot;), and then into four (recognizing &quot;Bunopithecus&quot; as the hoolock subgenus distinct from other gibbon subgenera). These four subgenera were elevated to full genus status. However, the type species for &quot;Bunopithecus&quot; is &quot;Bunopithecus sericus&quot;, an extinct gibbon or gibbon-like ape from Sichuan, China. Very recent investigations have shown that the hoolock gibbons are not closely related to &quot;B. sericus&quot;, so they have been placed in their own genus, &quot;Hoolock&quot;. In the process, the two subspecies of hoolock gibbons have been raised to species level. A new subspecies of the western hoolock gibbon has been described recently from northeastern India, which has been named the Mishmi Hills hoolock gibbon, &quot;H. hoolock mishmiensis&quot;. A further new species, &quot;H. tianxing&quot;, with an estimated population of about 200, was discovered in southwest China in 2017.

<doc id="1314319" wikidata="Q3989977" url="?curid=1314319" title="The Weird Al Show">
<text>The Weird Al Show is an American television show hosted by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. Produced in association with Dick Clark Productions and taped at NBC Studios, it aired on Saturday mornings on CBS. The show ran for one season, from September 13 to December 6, 1997, with reruns airing until September 26, 1998. The show was released on DVD on August 15, 2006.

The show is framed as a show-within-a-show, with Yankovic, starring as himself, living in an underground home while working as a television show host. It uses a combination of live-action skits with numerous guests, animated shorts, and musical performances by Yankovic and other guest bands. CBS had greenlit the show from Yankovic, seeking content for its required Educational/Informative programming block and framed similarly to &quot;Pee-Wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;. Because of this, Yankovic and his writers struggled with developing content appropriate for children&#x27;s programming that met CBS&#x27;s expectations while still within Yankovic&#x27;s form of visual and adult humor.

==Synopsis==
Each episode starts with a narrator (Billy West) introducing today&#x27;s lesson to the viewers. Then, Al is in a common situation in his cave dwelling that he addresses to the viewers. Afterward, he watches a TV displaying parody shows and commercials that are related to the day&#x27;s show. Most of the time, Al&#x27;s friend Bobby the Inquisitive Boy stops by and asks him a question. In turn, Al plays him an old-fashioned educational film (with the original dialogue replaced) to help answer his question. Sometimes, the show features an animated cartoon called &quot;Fatman&quot;, which is about Weird Al as a fat superhero. At the end of the show, there is a commercial parody being shown followed by a band performing a song. Sometimes, Al reviews today&#x27;s lesson before closing out the show.

==Development==
Around the time of recording &quot;Eat It&quot; in 1984, Yankovic and his manager started pitching the idea of a children&#x27;s show hosted by Yankovic, believing that his energy suited this format well. It was not until the 1990s that the American network CBS showed interest, specifically looking for Saturday morning content that would meet new Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules requiring broadcast networks to carry a number of hours of &quot;Educational/Informative&quot; (E/I) programming content. While this was not Yankovic&#x27;s preferred approach, he considered it &quot;the deal we made with the devil&quot; as to get his show on air.

Director Peyton Reed was brought to the show through his wife, who worked in a music video production company that had done some of Yankovic&#x27;s music videos, and was hired by CBS to produce the show. The show had been pitched to Reed as similar to &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, but to have a more subversive humor that followed Yankovic&#x27;s style of comedy. CBS brought in Wayne White, the production designer for &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, to construct the set for &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot;. For casting, Yankovic used a combination of previous actors he collaborated with (such as Judy Tenuta) and casting calls for others.

Filming was done in NBC Studios in Burbank, California, in the same sound stage used by &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and down the hall from the recording of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. As Yankovic had difficulty in getting guests, he had sometimes tried to ask Leno&#x27;s guests to appear on his show while they were waiting backstage; he had approached and secured Drew Carey&#x27;s appearance this way.

Writing for the show was challenged due to the E/I expectations demanded by CBS. CBS, through producer Dick Clark, frequently demanded changes to some of the visual humor written by Yankovic and the writing staff, fearing it was &quot;imitable behavior&quot; for children watching, and which limited how much visual comedy they could use. CBS also demanded a moral for each episode, and insisted that the moral had to be stated clearly at the start of each episode. To get around this, Yankovic brought in voice actor Billy West to scream out the moral at the very start of the episode, and then let the episode continue as they wanted. The writers knew some of their material would be scrapped by censors but wrote such scenes anyway, but were often surprised at what the censors left in. For example, a sketch in which Baby and Papa Boolie commit suicide after listening to one too many of Fred Huggins&#x27;s songs was being seriously considered by the network for use on the show. The sketch was later rewritten to have Papa Boolie call a mental hospital to take Fred away. The unused script of the unedited Fred Huggins sequence is role-played in an audio commentary for an episode on the DVD.

CBS also wanted more of Yankovic&#x27;s music parodies as part of the show, though they would not pay for the royalties for the original song. Yankovic ended up doing one original parody, &quot;Lousy Haircut&quot;, loosely based on &quot;Firestarter&quot; by The Prodigy. The network desired to see musical acts of younger musical groups that would appeal to their target audience at the time. One of these was Hanson, who had just reached fame with their single &quot;MMMBop&quot;. From this, Yankovic and the band members developed a camaraderie that continued long after the show, with Yankovic helping to direct some of their later videos. The show also featured the first television broadcast of the Barenaked Ladies, though Yankovic was surprised that the network allowed them to use the band&#x27;s full name at the time.

The show was cancelled after one season. Yankovic and the others on the team acknowledged that CBS did not find that the show followed the formulatic pattern set by &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, and coupled with difficulties in keeping the show in check, opted to cancel it. Yankovic and others on the production found in retrospect that working on the show was far too stressful and not the vision of what they wanted it to be; for the show&#x27;s DVD commentary, much of the commentary ended up being directed at the issues they had with CBS in producing the show.

=== Undeveloped material ===
The series contains many &quot;Star Wars&quot; references, and Yankovic planned a segment in which he claimed to have played Luke Skywalker&#x27;s &quot;annoying younger brother&quot; in scenes cut from the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. According to Yankovic, he planned to show &quot;actual scenes from &quot;Star Wars&quot; with me green-screened into them, seamlessly interacting with the characters. Of course, we had to get clearances from everybody before CBS would agree to let us shoot it. In the end, George Lucas signed off on it, and Sir Alec Guinness signed off on it, but Mark Hamill would not agree to let us use any footage with him in it -- so unfortunately, the whole bit had to be scrapped.&quot;

== Music ==

===Theme song===
The theme song can be found on Yankovic&#x27;s album &quot;Running with Scissors&quot; (1999) as &quot;The Weird Al Show Theme&quot;.

It tells the story of how Al came to live in a tree and get a television show, including references to the fabricated life story in &quot;The Compleat Al&quot;, such as having worked in a nasal decongestant factory. Also referenced is playing on the company bowling team, which may be a reference to &quot;Generic Blues&quot;.

The visuals for the show&#x27;s theme are done in three different styles: traditional animation, 3D computer animation, and claymation. The claymation portion was done by Mark Osborne and Scott Nordlund, who had previously done Yankovic&#x27;s &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; music video, and the CGI portion was done by DNA Productions, with Marathon Media likely doing the traditional animation portion, thanks to its art-style.

===Bite Me===
After the end credits of each case, when the &quot;Ear Booker Productions&quot; logo flashes on the screen repeatedly, a three-second version of the &quot;Bite Me&quot; track can be heard. &quot;Bite Me&quot; originally appeared as a six second long hidden track on the CD version of Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Off the Deep End&quot;. The track appeared after 10 minutes of the final track (&quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me Anymore&quot;). The track was included as a parody of Nirvana&#x27;s hidden track on the album &quot;Nevermind&quot;, but also to scare listeners into turning off the CD.

<doc id="1314327" wikidata="Q5314019" url="?curid=1314327" title="Dun Cow">
<text>The Dun Cow is a common motif in English folklore. &quot;Dun&quot; is a dull shade of brownish grey.

==Dunsmore Heath==
The Dun Cow was said to be a savage beast roaming Dunsmore Heath, an area west of Dunchurch, near Rugby in Warwickshire, which was reputedly slain by Guy of Warwick. A large narwhal tusk is still exhibited at Warwick Castle as one of the ribs of the Dun Cow. The fable held that the cow belonged to a giant, and was kept on Mitchell&#x27;s Fold (middle fold), Shropshire. Its milk was inexhaustible; but one day an old witch who had filled her pail, wanted to fill her riddle (sieve) as well. This so enraged the animal that she broke loose from the fold and wandered to Dunsmore Heath, where she was slain by Guy of Warwick.

Isaac Taylor, in his &quot;Words and Places&quot; (p. 269), says the dun cow is a corruption of the &quot;Dena Gau&quot; (Danish region) in the neighbourhood of Warwick, with &quot;Gau&quot; in German meaning &quot;region or country&quot;. If this explanation is correct, the great achievement of Guy of Warwick may have been a victory over the Danes, and taking from them their settlement near Warwick.

==Whittingham==
A similar legend applies to Dun Cow Rib Farm in Halfpenny Lane, Whittingham, Lancashire, just outside the town of Longridge. Embedded in its wall is a large rib, supposedly from a giant dun cow that gave milk freely to all comers, but died of shock when an old witch asked it to fill a riddle instead of a pail. An alternative legend claims that the giant cow&#x27;s milk saved the local inhabitants from the Plague and that it was buried at nearby Cow Hill, near Grimsargh. It was also claimed that the cow would quench its thirst at &quot;Nick&#x27;s Water-Pot&quot;, a well on the summit of Parlick hill. In reality, the rib is probably from a whale or Bronze Age aurochs.

==Durham==
Local legend states that the city of Durham was founded in 995 AD by divine intervention. The 12th-century chronicler Symeon of Durham recounts in his &quot;Libellus de exordio atque procurso istius, hoc est Dunhelmensis&quot; that, after wandering in the north, Saint Cuthbert&#x27;s bier came to a miraculous halt at the hill of Warden Law and, despite the effort of the congregation, would not move. Aldhun, Bishop of Chester-le-Street and leader of the order, decreed a holy fast of three days, accompanied by prayers to the saint. Bede recounts that during this fast Saint Cuthbert appeared to the monk Eadmer with instructions that the coffin should be taken to Dun Holm.

After Eadmer’s revelation, Aldhun found that he was able to move the bier, but did not know where Dun Holm was. By chance later that day, the monks came across a milkmaid at Mount Joy who stated that she was seeking her lost dun cow which she had last seen at Dun Holm. The monks, realising that this was a sign from the saint, followed her. They settled at a &quot;wooded hill-island formed by a tight gorge-like meander of the River Wear&quot;. When they arrived at the destination, they erected the vestiges of Durham Cathedral, a &quot;modest building&quot; none of which survives today, having been supplanted by the Norman structure. Symeon states that this was the first building in the city.

==Bristol==
A tourist guide from 1923 states that:

In the glorious church of St Mary Redcliffe ... may still be seen the &quot;Dun Cow&quot; bone, the rib of a cow whale, now the only remaining trophy of Cabot&#x27;s expedition of 1497, but for a considerable period regarded as part of the body of George of Warwick.

== Anne Boleyn ==
George Cavendish, the biographer of Cardinal Wolsey, described carved and painted royal heraldic beasts in a garden at Richmond Palace. Wolsey said a dun cow (referring to a badge of the Earldom of Richmond or Warwick) was also found in the heraldry of Thomas Boleyn and was a portent of the relationship of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII.

==Public houses==
There are many public houses in the United Kingdom called The Dun Cow, including one on High Street West in Sunderland, beside the Sunderland Empire Theatre.

A pub called The Dun Cow in Sedgefield, County Durham, was visited jointly by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and American President George W. Bush in 2003.

The Dun Cow, Shrewsbury, is one of the oldest pubs in the UK, built by Rodger De Montgomery, first Earl of Shrewsbury circa 1085 as a hostel for the skilled masons and master builders brought in to oversee the construction of St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s (later known as Shrewsbury Abbey).

==Songs==
A British music hall song, &quot;When the Old Dun Cow Caught Fire&quot; (also known as &quot;The Old Dun Cow&quot;), refers to a pub named the Dun Cow, which catches on fire in the beginning of the song. The singer&#x27;s friends, most notably a man named Brown, decide to raid the Dun Cow&#x27;s cellar for alcohol and end up heavily intoxicated, partaking in shenanigans such as trying to prevent the firefighters (implied to also be seeking alcohol) from entering the cellar, washing their clothing in a tub of port wine (or stale beer in some versions), and using their slacks to nail up a makeshift roof after the pub partially collapses.

<text>Kevin Michael Harvick (born December 8, 1975) is an American semi-retired professional stock car racing driver and commentator for &quot;NASCAR on Fox&quot;.

He last competed full-time in the NASCAR Cup Series, driving the No. 4 Ford Mustang for Stewart–Haas Racing. Harvick won the Cup Series championship in 2014 as well as the 2001 and 2006 Xfinity Series championships, and the 2007 Daytona 500. Harvick holds the all-time record for Cup Series wins at Phoenix Raceway with nine wins. Harvick&#x27;s 121 combined national series wins currently rank him third all-time in NASCAR history, behind Richard Petty and Kyle Busch, respectively, while his 60 Cup wins are tenth in series history. Harvick began his NASCAR career in 1992, he is the third of only six drivers that have won a championship in both the Cup Series and the Xfinity Series, and the fifth of 36 drivers to win a race in each of NASCAR&#x27;s three national series. Harvick has worked as a broadcaster off-and-on for &quot;NASCAR on FOX&quot; since 2015, calling Xfinity Series races. Since retiring from NASCAR Cup Series competition, Harvick is signed to call Cup Series races for &quot;Fox&quot; starting in 2024.

Harvick is the owner of Kevin Harvick Incorporated, a race team that fielded cars in the Xfinity Series from 2004 to 2011 and the Truck Series between 2001 and 2011. The team&#x27;s No. 29 late model is driven full-time in the CARS Tour by Brent Crews, alongside the No. 62 late model which is driven by several different drivers, including Harvick himself. In the media, he has sometimes been nicknamed &quot;the Closer&quot; and &quot;Happy Harvick&quot; as well as &quot;Hot Humid Harvick&quot; as he often wins in very hot and humid weather just like Atlanta Motor Speedway.

==Early life==
Harvick was born in 1975 in Bakersfield, California, to parents Mike and JoNell (Walker) Harvick, and has a younger sister, Amber. He began kart racing at an early age, after his parents bought him a go-kart as a kindergarten graduation gift. Harvick grew up a fan of IndyCar driver and fellow Bakersfield native Rick Mears, and raced go-karts with Mears&#x27; son Clint. He achieved considerable success on the go-kart racing circuit, earning seven national championships and two Grand National championships.

While in high school, Harvick began racing late models part-time in 1992 in the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series. During the racing offseason, he competed on the North High School wrestling team, qualifying for a CIF Central Section title in his weight class his senior year. Harvick also played baseball, basketball, football, and soccer. After graduation, he attended Bakersfield College with the intention of majoring in architecture, but later dropped out in order to pursue a full-time racing career.

==NASCAR career==
===Early career===
Harvick made his Craftsman Truck Series debut in 1995 at the Mesa Marin Raceway, in his hometown of Bakersfield, where he started and finished 27th in his family-owned No. 72. He drove four races in the No. 72 the next season, his best finish was 11th at Mesa Marin. In 1997, he signed to drive the No. 75 for Spears Motorsports mid-season, posting two eighth-place finishes. He ran a full schedule the next season, posting 3 top-fives and finishing 17th in points. Harvick also moved up to the NASCAR Grand National Division, AutoZone West Series in 1997, and in 1998 Harvick won five races on his way to the Winston West Series championship while driving for Spears. He received his first real national exposure during the winter of 1997/1998 on ESPN2&#x27;s coverage of the NASCAR Winter Heat Series at Tucson Raceway Park. In 1999, he drove the No. 98 Porter Cable Ford for Liberty Racing, finishing 12th in points with six top-fives.

===1999–2000: NASCAR Busch Series===
On October 23, 1999, Harvick made his first NASCAR Busch Series start in the Kmart 200 at the Rockingham Speedway in the No. 2 Chevrolet. He would start 24th and finish 42nd due to engine failure. The race would be his only start in 1999. In 2000, Harvick would sign with Richard Childress Racing to drive the No. 2 Chevrolet for his first full Busch Series season. Despite failing to qualify for the second race of the season at Rockingham, Harvick would go on to win the NASCAR Busch Series Rookie of the Year with three wins, eight top-five finishes, and 16 top-tens as well as garnering third-place points finish.

===2001: Cup Series debut, replacing Earnhardt===
For 2001, Childress planned to run Harvick in the No. 2 ACDelco Chevy in the Busch Series full-time again, while developing him into the Winston Cup Series with up to seven races in the No. 30 AOL Chevy. He planned to race Harvick for a full schedule in 2002. The death of Dale Earnhardt on the last lap of the 2001 Daytona 500 changed Childress&#x27;s plans, and Harvick began his first Cup race the following week in the Dura Lube 400 at Rockingham, filling the seat vacated by Earnhardt&#x27;s passing in the renumbered No. 29 GM Goodwrench Service Plus Chevrolet.

On March 11, 2001, in the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, only three weeks after Earnhardt&#x27;s death, Harvick won his first career Winston Cup race in just his third start by narrowly edging Jeff Gordon. He won the race by only six one-thousandths of a second (.006). After the win, he paid tribute to Earnhardt, driving on the track backward with three fingers held aloft outside the driver&#x27;s window as a show of honor and respect. At the time, this broke the record for earliest career start for a driver to win a race in the Modern Era, since surpassed by Jamie McMurray and Trevor Bayne, both of whom accomplished the feat in their second starts, and then by Shane van Gisbergen in 2023 in his debut.

He won his second career Cup race at Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, Illinois. At the end of the season, he finished with two victories, six Top 5s, and 16 Top 10s. Harvick was awarded the NASCAR Rookie of the Year Award and secured a ninth-place finish in the 2001 points standings. He also won the Busch Series championship, becoming the first driver to win the Busch Series championship while also driving full-time in the Winston Cup Series with a Top 10 finish. Harvick would end the season winning six pole positions, and making 69 starts: 35 in Cup Series, an appearance in the Winston, 33 in the Busch Series, and one in the Craftsman Truck Series at Richmond International Raceway for Rick Carelli.

===2002===
In 2002, Harvick spent the season concentrating on running the Cup Series and would only start four races in the Busch Series. Harvick began the 2002 season making his first Daytona 500 start on the outside pole next to Jimmie Johnson, but his day ended after triggering an 18-car crash on lap 148 while running second to Jeff Gordon, relegating him to a 36th-place finish. Later in the season, he was fined for a post-race incident with Greg Biffle at Bristol Motor Speedway. Harvick was also suspended for rough driving in a Truck race at Martinsville, in which he announced on his radio that he intentionally spun out driver Coy Gibbs, prompting NASCAR to immediately take him out of the race. Even though it was heard on the radio that he did, Harvick lied in a post-race interview saying that he did not purposely wreck Gibbs. Harvick was banned from the Cup Series race the next day, with Kenny Wallace replacing him; he was also fined $35,000 and placed into another probation (he was already on probation for the Biffle incident). Harvick rebounded and scored his first career Winston Cup pole position in the Pepsi 400 at Daytona. Later in the season, he took his third Cup win at Chicagoland Speedway. This would prove to be one of the only bright spots in a disappointing season, as he finished 21st in the 2002 points standings with one win, one pole, five Top 5s, and eight Top 10s. Harvick became the 2002 IROC Champion in his first season in the Series, winning at California Speedway. In Trucks, Harvick began fielding his own No. 6 truck, driving himself in five races and winning at Phoenix.

===2003===

In the 2003 season, Harvick teamed with crew chief Todd Berrier in the Cup Series, with whom he had won the Busch championship in 2001. Together, they won the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis. Harvick and his team jumped to fifth in the 2003 point standings, coming within 252 points of Matt Kenseth. In the Busch Series, Harvick was teamed with Johnny Sauter, driving the No. 21 Hershey&#x27;s-sponsored PayDay car. The two would combine for three wins, 16 Top 5s, and 24 Top 10s, with Harvick posting all three wins. They would give Childress the NASCAR Busch Series owners&#x27; championship that season. Harvick competed in 19 of the 34 races, and Sauter competed in the other 15. Harvick also scored eight pole positions and finished 16th in the final drivers&#x27; standings.

===2004: First winless season===
On August 28 during the 2004 Sharpie 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway, Harvick had one of the most bizarre sequences of events happen to him. On lap 323, Harvick radioed to his crew that his right arm had fallen asleep on him and had gone numb which made it difficult for him to operate his race car properly and needed a backup driver. The caution came out 5 laps later and Harvick made his way onto pit road and was pulled out of the car. He was replaced by Kyle Petty, who was involved in an earlier wreck in the same race. Petty finished 24th 6 laps down for Harvick. Harvick was still able to stay 8th in points but in the last 2 regular season races at California and Richmond, Harvick would finish in 28th and 12th causing Harvick to fall from 8th to 15th in the standings missing out on the inaugural Chase for the Cup. Harvick&#x27;s season was also known for his conflicts with Matt Kenseth at Pocono and rookie Kasey Kahne at Phoenix. While winless in the 2004 Cup season, Harvick placed third in the voting for Most Popular Driver. He had fourteen Top 10 finishes and finished 14th in points. Harvick was paired with another driver in the Busch Series, rookie Clint Bowyer. They combined for one win, 13 Top 5s, and 20 Top 10s in the No. 21 car, with Reese&#x27;s Peanut Butter Cups as a sponsor. Harvick drove the No. 29 Busch car in the final race of the season at Homestead–Miami Speedway in the Ford 300, which he would claim his second win of the season. He finished 14th in the final standings. The No. 21 car finished fourth in the owner&#x27;s standings.

===2005===

In the 2005 season, Harvick&#x27;s only Cup win came at the Food City 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway, despite starting towards the rear of the field. He won without the assistance of crew chief Todd Berrier, who was serving a four-week suspension for a rules violation. In the Busch Series, Harvick was paired with Brandon Miller. Harvick and Miller combined for 3 wins, 15 top-fives, and 19 top-tens to give the No. 21 its second fourth-place finish in the owner&#x27;s standings. Harvick would win his first &quot;sweep&quot; of his career at Bristol, winning both the Sharpie Professional 250 Busch race and the Food City 500 Cup race, also giving him a record fourth Busch Series win at the track (tying with Morgan Shepherd). Harvick finished 14th in the Cup series standings and 18th in the Busch series driver&#x27;s standings.

===2006: Second Busch Championship and first Chase appearance===

In 2006, Harvick decided to run both of NASCAR&#x27;s Top 2 series full-time driving for Richard Childress. In the Busch Series, Harvick would be scheduled to run all 35 races, with three different cars. He ran four races for his team in the No. 33, the season opener at Daytona in Childress&#x27; No. 29, and the remaining 30 races for RCR&#x27;s No. 21. He won his first Busch Series race of the 2006 season at Nashville Superspeedway. He followed the win with a weekend sweep of the Busch Series and Sprint Cup races at Phoenix International Raceway. Harvick had nine wins, 23 Top 5s, and 32 Top 10s in the Busch Series. He clinched the 2006 NASCAR Busch Series championship on October 13, 2006, at Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway in the Dollar General 300. It was the earliest clinch of the championship ever in the Busch Series, locking up the title with four races to go. He ended the season with a record 824-point margin in the final standings.

In the Nextel Cup series, Harvick, along with teammate Jeff Burton, scored the first berths for Richard Childress Racing in the Chase for the Cup. Harvick would have 3 wins, 11 top-5&#x27;s and 14 top-10s going into the chase.
After a dominant win at New Hampshire, Harvick would have a substandard Chase run. He fell to sixth place in the point standings until he finished third at Texas. Following that was another dominating performance in the Checker Auto Parts 500 at Phoenix International Raceway on November 12. Harvick would win that race, moving him up to third in points. At the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, Harvick would finish fifth in the race and slip to fourth in the final standings to eventual 2006 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson.

===2007: Daytona 500 win===
Harvick opened the 2007 Sprint Cup series with a dramatic final lap pass in the Daytona 500, beating Mark Martin by .020 seconds in a green-white-checkered finish, the closest margin at the 500 since electronic scoring started in 1993. He would become only the fourth NASCAR driver to sweep both the Nationwide and Cup races in the opening weekend at Daytona. With the win, Harvick also became the sixth of eight drivers to win both the Daytona 500 and the Brickyard 400, following Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt, Dale Jarrett, Bill Elliott, Jimmie Johnson, and preceding Jamie McMurray and Ryan Newman. Harvick would be quiet for the remainder of the season, his only other win coming in the Sprint All-Star Race and finishing 10th in points.

In 2007, Harvick started the Nationwide Series season by winning the Orbitz 300 at Daytona, claiming his first win in a restrictor-plate race, as well as the first win for new sponsor AutoZone in NASCAR&#x27;s Nationwide Series. He also won at New Hampshire International Speedway, winning the Camping World 200 presented by RVs.com. He also ended up unexpectedly winning the inaugural race at Montreal in August, the NAPA Auto Parts 200, after with two laps to go, leader Robby Gordon was black-flagged for intentionally causing a crash involving rookie Marcos Ambrose. The win was considered a bit of an upset as many expected the road course ringers to dominate and Harvick had started 43rd in the race due to a driver change.

===2008: Second winless season===
Harvick went winless in 2008, but he was still able to post a fourth-place ranking in the 2008 Chase for the Sprint Cup. The fourth-place finish in the 2008 standings tied 2006 for his highest points position at the end of the season. Harvick also went the entire season without a single DNF for the second straight year. In the Nationwide Series, he ran twenty-two races for his team with sponsorship from Camping World, Rheem, and RoadLoans. He did not win a race in this series either. His lone win came in a Truck race at Phoenix.

===2009: Third winless season===

Harvick started the 2009 season by winning the Budweiser Shootout with a last-lap pass on Jamie McMurray. After Harvick damaged his primary car for the 2009 Daytona 500, his team switched to his Shootout car and he finished second when the race was declared official early due to rain.

This wasn&#x27;t his worst season, despite the point standings. He didn&#x27;t get a single win in the cup series this year knowing that he was successful in the Nationwide series and the truck series, having a total of 5 wins this season. Auto Club in California, Harvick blew his engine and suffered his first DNF in 82 starts. He won the first 2009 Nationwide Series race at Bristol, his first win in his car. In addition, he won the Camping World Truck Series race at Martinsville Speedway. During the season, Gil Martin became the new crew chief for Harvick as Childress decided to switch all team members of the No. 07 and No. 29 except the drivers and spotters, thus giving Casey Mears Harvick&#x27;s crew chief Todd Berrier. In the first five races following the switch, Harvick finished with an average of 25.4, finishing 34th, 11th, 41st, 17th, and 24th respectively. A short time later, reports surfaced stating that Harvick had asked for a release of his contract at the end of the 2009 season to join Stewart-Haas Racing for the 2010 season. Harvick refused to comment publicly on the subject of where he would be driving in 2010. His best race came at the Pep Boys Auto 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, where Harvick had the best car in a long run and led for most of the race, but was denied victory after a late-race caution from which later eventual race winner Kasey Kahne took advantage of when he went past Harvick on the restart; he finished second. He would miss the chase for the first time since 2005 and finished a disappointing 19th in the final standings.

===2010: Redemption===
Harvick&#x27;s 2010 season was considered a bounce-back year. He started the same way he did in 2009 by winning the Budweiser Shootout with a pass in the penultimate lap in a green-white-checkered situation. Harvick placed second in his Gatorade Duel by inches to Jimmie Johnson. He led the most laps in the Daytona 500 but ended up finishing seventh. He followed up his seventh at Daytona with a second at Auto Club Speedway again to Jimmie Johnson. After the race, Harvick told media members that the No. 48 team (of Johnson) &quot;had a golden horseshoe stuck up their ass&quot;. Following the race, Harvick followed up with another second-place finish to Johnson at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. He won the Aaron&#x27;s 499 after three green-white-checkered situations, passing Jamie McMurray in what was the 88th lead change of the race, setting a new NASCAR record. On July 3, Harvick captured his second win of the year by winning the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona. On August 15, Harvick captured his third win of the year by winning the Carfax 400 at Michigan. His win at Michigan locked him into the Chase for the Sprint Cup for the fourth time. He finished the regular season first place in points but started the Chase in third after the points were adjusted. During the 10-race Chase, Harvick scored five top-fives and nine top-tens. Despite scoring an average finish of 5.8 (best in the 2010 Chase and third-best all-time in the Chase), Harvick finished third overall, 41 points behind 2010 Champion Jimmie Johnson. However, under a full season points format, Harvick would&#x27;ve won his first championship by 285 points over Jimmie Johnson by locking up the championship a week early in Phoenix with a 6th place finish.

Harvick also won his first career Pole in the Camping World Truck Series at Gateway International Raceway in his own No. 2 Chevrolet Silverado. This added Harvick to the shortlist of NASCAR drivers who have won a pole award and a race in each of NASCAR&#x27;s three major series.

===2011: Feud with Kyle Busch===

With the departure of Royal Dutch Shell at the end of 2010, the No. 29 teams were searching for a new sponsor. In August 2010, it was announced that for 2011, the car&#x27;s primary sponsor would be with Budweiser for 20 races. Adding to Harvick&#x27;s new sponsorship, on January 25, 2011, Jimmy John&#x27;s and Richard Childress Racing reached a multi-year agreement to sponsor the No. 29 Sprint Cup team for 6 races in 2011. Harvick won his 15th career Cup race at Auto Club Speedway after passing defending series champion, Jimmie Johnson in the final turn in a finish resembling the previous race in 2010. As a joke to Harvick&#x27;s words in 2010, Johnson asked Harvick in post-race ceremonies if &quot;I can have my golden horseshoe back.&quot; Harvick took his second consecutive win of the year at Martinsville Speedway. Harvick then won the Coca-Cola 600 after Earnhardt Jr. ran out of fuel in the last turn on Lap 402. He would then later win at Richmond, narrowly beating Jeff Gordon due to a late-race pit stop that shuffled Harvick to the lead.

During the 2011 season, Kevin Harvick and fellow driver Kyle Busch were embroiled in a feud. After Harvick intentionally wrecked Busch at the 2010 Ford 400 at Homestead, he and Busch tangled several times during the 2011 season. A post-race incident at Darlington in May 2011 led NASCAR to put both drivers on probation and fining them $25,000. Later that season, Kyle Busch tangled with a bunch of drivers connected to Harvick&#x27;s team such as Elliott Sadler and Ron Hornaday Jr. Harvick was able to finish well in all three series, finishing 3rd in points in Cup, and clenching the 2011 Truck Series Owner&#x27;s Championship in his final season as a team owner.

At the season&#x27;s end, Harvick announced that he would shut down Kevin Harvick, Inc. because he wanted to focus on winning a Sprint Cup Series championship. In his statement announcing the closure, Harvick said that the difference in costs of similar bodies between Nationwide and Cup Series cars made it mathematically impossible for a non-Cup-affiliated team to operate effectively. Harvick also admitted that his original goal in forming KHI was to achieve the success in the Truck Series that he wasn&#x27;t able to get before driving in Winston Cup, and it blossomed into a venture to build drivers&#x27; careers. He sold KHI to Richard Childress.

===2012===
Although winless in the regular season, Harvick made the 2012 Chase through consistency. At Phoenix, Harvick avoided a chaos-filled race to collect his only win of the season and the 19th of his career. He went on to finish 8th in points.

===2013: Final season at RCR===

In 2013 at Daytona, Harvick dodged a practice wreck in the last session of practice, and the same in the Sprint Unlimited. Later, he would go on and tie Tony Stewart&#x27;s and Dale Jarrett&#x27;s record for wins in the Clash/Shootout/Unlimited. He also won his Budweiser Duel. He was caught up in a crash on lap 35 of the Daytona 500 and finished 41st. Harvick won his first race of the season at the 2013 Toyota Owners 400, which ended Kyle Busch&#x27;s four-year winning streak in the spring Richmond race. At the Coca-Cola 600, Harvick took the lead on the last cycle of pit stops and held off Kasey Kahne to win his 2nd 600. Harvick won his first pole position since September 2006 in qualifying for the 2013 Hollywood Casino 400. He dominated the race, leading 138 laps, and survived a wreck-filled event to take his third win of the season. Harvick won his fourth race of the year at the Phoenix race, taking the lead at the white flag when Carl Edwards ran out of gas. His tenure at RCR came to an end the following week at Homestead-Miami with a 10th-place finish. Harvick finished the season third in points again, with four wins, nine Top 5s, 21 Top 10 finishes, and one pole position.

===2014: Stewart-Haas Racing and Cup Series Championship===
It was officially confirmed on January 22, 2013, that Harvick would be switching teams and joining Stewart-Haas for the 2014 season. Harvick and Childress said the parting was mutual and that it was time for Harvick to move on. Stewart-Haas Racing did not confirm what sponsor or number Harvick would be given. During the official reports it was reported, but not officially told, that Budweiser was interested in staying with Harvick. On July 12, 2013, it was confirmed that Harvick would drive the No. 4 Chevrolet, and would replace Ryan Newman, who parted ways with Stewart-Haas Racing at the end of the season. Harvick retained Budweiser as his primary sponsor for 21 races, with Jimmy John&#x27;s sponsoring the remaining races for the 2014 season. In October, it was announced that Harvick would also run a partial schedule in the Nationwide Series in 2014, competing in a minimum of 12 races for JR Motorsports. Despite a second-place finish in his Budweiser Duel in a photo finish against Matt Kenseth and Kasey Kahne, Harvick failed post-race inspection, and his Duel finish was disallowed. As a result, Harvick started the Daytona 500 in 38th, getting in the 500 on a Provisional. Harvick ran upfront during the Daytona 500, but was caught up in a last-lap crash leaving turn 4, and was scored in the 13th position.
The following week at Phoenix, Harvick started 13th and dominated the race, leading 224 of 312 laps, holding off Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Brad Keselowski over the final seven laps to win. This was Harvick&#x27;s first win for Stewart-Haas Racing and snapped a tie with Jimmie Johnson for most all-time wins at Phoenix.

However, following Phoenix came a bizarre five-race stretch in which Harvick finished 36th or worse four times, due to a hub failure at Las Vegas (41st), a cut oil line at Bristol (39th), a blown tire at Auto Club (36th), and an engine failure at Texas (42nd) – each time squandering one of the fastest cars on the track, as well as leading the most laps.

At Darlington, Harvick dominated the Bojangles&#x27; Southern 500 and overtook Dale Earnhardt Jr. on the final lap to win his second race for Stewart-Haas Racing. Harvick almost won the Coca-Cola 600 for the third time in four years, but a poor pit stop with 250 laps left cost him the race. He recovered to score a second-place finish but finished 5.55 seconds behind Jimmie Johnson.

Harvick won the pole, both at Michigan and Indianapolis. In the Irwin Tools Night Race, Harvick controlled the race early. His race, however, turned for the worse when Harvick was later penalized by NASCAR for speeding on pit road, ensuring an 11th-place finish. During the Chase, now using an elimination format, Harvick went on to win the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte, giving him his third win of the season and ensuring his advancement to the next round.

At Texas Motor Speedway, Harvick got a second-place finish but started controversy after instigating a fight between Jeff Gordon and Brad Keselowski on pit road immediately following the race.

At Phoenix, Harvick won the race and swept both 2014 races Phoenix, allowing him to transfer into the final round of the Chase at Homestead.

At Homestead–Miami Speedway, Harvick was consistent all day long, occasionally battling with Jeff Gordon for the lead. After a late caution, Harvick decided to pit with four tires. Rebounding after restarting outside the top 10, Harvick managed to reach the Top-5, when another caution occurred. Harvick took the lead away from Denny Hamlin, and in the end, held off fellow championship contender Ryan Newman to win the Ford Ecoboost 400 and the Sprint Cup Championship by one position over Newman. This was Kevin Harvick&#x27;s first Sprint Cup Series championship in his career.

===2015===

In the Sprint Unlimited, Harvick scored an 11th-place finish despite receiving minor damage to his car from a wreck early in the race.

Harvick started the season by finishing second in the Daytona 500. At Las Vegas, Harvick held off Martin Truex Jr. to win his first race of the season. Harvick won again the next week for his fourth straight win at Phoenix and a record seventh win at the track overall. At Auto Club, Harvick managed to finish second, this time to Brad Keselowski. This brought his streak of Top 2 finishes to eight races overall. It appeared Harvick was on track to tie Richard Petty for most straight Top 2 finishes, but this streak came to an end with an eighth-place finish at Martinsville.

Harvick then went on to collect four straight Top 10 finishes at Daytona, Kentucky, New Hampshire, and Indianapolis. In the first race of the Chase at Chicagoland, Harvick finished 42nd after getting a flat tire and spinning into the wall due to contact with Jimmie Johnson a few laps earlier on a restart. A confrontation took place after Harvick met with Johnson and lightly punched him in the chest. Harvick dominated next week at Loudon, leading 216 of 300 laps. However, he ran out of gas, allowing Matt Kenseth to win. Harvick finished 21st, putting him in danger of being eliminated from the Chase. The following week at Dover International Speedway, Harvick dominated a majority of the race to earn the third win of the season, leading 351 of 400 laps in the process. That win allowed Harvick to clinch a spot into the next round of the Chase, after narrowly avoiding being eliminated.

In the final race of the Round of 12 at Talladega, Harvick was again in a tough situation. During a green-white-checker restart, Harvick&#x27;s car was unable to accelerate, which triggered a multi-car wreck. Due to the caution being displayed quickly after the leaders crossed the line, the race was considered official, and Joey Logano was declared the winner. Denny Hamlin, who was competing with Harvick for a spot in the next round, was caught up in the wreck and was eliminated from the Chase. Harvick managed to avoid the wreck, and finished 15th, advancing him to the next round in the Chase. Trevor Bayne, who was hit in the quarter panel by Harvick which triggered the wreck, accused him of intentionally spinning him out to secure a spot in the next round. Kevin Harvick and his crew chief, Rodney Childers, claimed that they had tried to move out of the way during the restart, knowing that their engine was failing. In the first race of the Round of 8, Harvick finished 8th at Martinsville. The next week at Texas, he managed to finish 3rd, despite having a faulty shifter which forced him to drive with one hand for the last several laps.

At Homestead, Harvick came up one spot short of the championship, finishing 2nd in the race and the championship to Kyle Busch. With 3 laps to go, Harvick was closing in on Busch but ran out of time, finishing 2nd to him by 1.5 seconds.

Despite his second-place finish in the championship, Harvick had led the point standings for much of the regular season from the third race of the season at Las Vegas to the Federated Auto Parts 400 at Richmond (a span of 24 races). After the latter race, he fell to fourth in the standings, allowing Johnson to take over in the top spot. He then fell to 15th (11 positions back) after the Chicagoland race as Matt Kenseth took over the points lead. After the fall Martinsville race, Harvick went back up to fourth in the standings. When the fall Phoenix race was shortened due to rain, Harvick retook the points lead. Under a full season points format, Harvick would&#x27;ve won his 2nd championship by 22 points over Joey Logano.

===2016===

In the 2016 Daytona 500, Harvick stayed upfront during a majority of the race and would end up finishing 4th. Harvick would earn his first win of the season at Phoenix by beating Carl Edwards in a photo finish by a margin of 0.10, the closest finish in the track&#x27;s history. The win was Harvick&#x27;s eighth win at Phoenix.

Over the next several weeks, Harvick finished consistently in the Top 10. His first DNF of the season would soon come at Daytona, where he was involved in a big accident on lap 90. Another rough race would come five weeks later at Watkins Glen, due to heavy contact from David Ragan after spinning out with 7 laps to go. The next week, Harvick would nab his second win of the season at Bristol, where he held off Ricky Stenhouse Jr. for the last 50 laps of the race.

In the first race of the Chase for the Sprint Cup at Chicagoland, Harvick would start at the rear of the field due to unapproved body modifications but quickly moved back up to the front within 30 laps. He would be put a lap down due to an untimely caution while Harvick was on pit road because he did not beat the leader, Martin Truex Jr., to the start-finish line. He never got back on the lead lap for the remainder of the race, and ultimately finished 20th. Harvick&#x27;s third win of the season would come at the very next week at Loudon, where he passed Matt Kenseth on a late-race restart with 7 laps to go. Next week at Dover, Harvick would have a broken track bar and would have to go to the garage but he was already locked into the next round due to his win at New Hampshire. The next week at Charlotte, Harvick would win the pole and would lead 155 laps before having electrical problems on lap 154 at the same time Joey Logano had a tire problem and hit the wall. Coming into Kansas, Harvick sat 12th in the Chase standings and would be in a must-win situation to make the round of 8, but that was no problem for Harvick as he would dominate the race along with Matt Kenseth until Kenseth would fade after tapping the wall. Harvick would lead 267 laps to victory, late in the race, Carl Edwards, would get the lead and lead several laps, but after a few cautions and restarts, Harvick would get back the lead and while Edwards and Kyle Busch would battle hard for 2nd place, Harvick would pull away to get his 4th win of the season, and advance into the Round of 8 in the Chase but he would officially get eliminated in the Round of 8. He would wrap up his 2016 season by winning the pole and finishing 3rd at Homestead-Miami. If NASCAR still had a full season points format, Kevin Harvick would&#x27;ve won his 3rd championship in 2016 and become the first person to win back-to-back championships since Jeff Gordon in 1997 and 1998.

===2017===

For 2017, Stewart-Haas switched from Chevrolet to Ford. Harvick went on to win Stage 2 and lead the most laps in the 2017 Daytona 500. A large wreck on lap 129 would hinder Harvick from topping his solid day off, and would ultimately finish 22nd. Next week at Atlanta, Harvick continued his momentum by capturing the pole position. Once the green flag waved, Harvick held the lead and didn&#x27;t look back. He would go on to lead 292 out of 325 laps, a race-high for him, and he would also sweep both race stages. With less than 20 to go, Austin Dillon&#x27;s car received a power failure, setting up a late-race caution. The field would pit, and Harvick would receive a devastating pit road penalty. This put him at the tail end of the longest line and would prevent him from closing out the race and winning yet again. Harvick would only advance up to the 9th position. Despite his disappointing performances, he would lead the points standings heading out of Atlanta due to his stage wins and consistency during the two races.

Harvick raced in the K&amp;N Pro Series West event at Sonoma Raceway, his first race in the series since Iowa Speedway in 2007, driving the No. 4 for Jefferson Pitts Racing. Harvick took the lead from Michael Self on lap 42 to win the race. A day later, he won the Toyota/Save Mart 350 to sweep the weekend, his second-ever road course win, and first at Sonoma. Teammate Clint Bowyer finished second to mark a Stewart-Haas 1–2. During the chase, Harvick struggled during the first round finishing 36th at Loudon and 17th at Dover. Though his playoff points and stage points saved him from elimination. The second round fared slightly better for Harvick though he did suffer a DNF at Talladega, again his stage points would keep him from elimination. Harvick finished 5th at Martinsville after sliding to the finish after last-lap contact. The following week at Texas, Harvick would win stage 1, lead a total of 35 laps, and win the race. Harvick&#x27;s win would secure him a spot in the Championship 4 at Homestead. The win was also Harvick&#x27;s first at Texas, leaving Kentucky and Pocono as the only tracks Harvick has yet to win. The following week at Phoenix, Harvick finished 5th. This marked the first season since 2011 where Harvick didn&#x27;t win a race at Phoenix. In the season finale at Homestead, Harvick started strong, leading the championship at one point, however, after hitting some debris and losing the handle of the car, Harvick was unable to run with the leaders Truex and Busch during the final green-flag run. He finished 4th in the race and 3rd in the final standings. With the retirements of Dale Jr. and Matt Kenseth, Harvick and his long-time rival Jimmie Johnson became the oldest full-time drivers in the Cup Series.

===2018===

Harvick would start the 2018 season with a DNF at the Daytona 500, after being involved in a crash just halfway through the race finishing 31st, but would earn dominant back-to-back wins at Atlanta (his first since 2001) and Las Vegas. This would be the first time Harvick would earn back-to-back wins since 2015 where he won at Las Vegas and Phoenix. It would also be his 100th career win across NASCAR&#x27;s top three series. However, his win at Las Vegas would not count toward the playoffs as he received an L1 penalty for the rear window of the car not being braced at all times. He has docked 20 points, crew chief Childers fined $50,000 and car chief Robert Smith suspended for the next two races. Despite Childers being absent in the Phoenix race and the penalty from last week, Harvick was able to score his 40th career win and would finally earn three consecutive wins after four previous attempts, for the first time in his career. Coming to California, four consecutive would not work for Harvick, as he was involved in a wreck with Kyle Larson early in the race, and would finish 35th place, nine laps down. He finished fifth at Martinsville, second at Texas, seventh at Bristol, fifth at Richmond, and fourth at Talladega. At Dover, Harvick dominated by leading the most laps and scoring his fourth win of the year. The following week at Kansas, he was again dominant, scoring the pole, finishing second in both stages, and taking the lead with two laps to go to win his fifth race of the season. This tied the most wins for Harvick in a season. Harvick was the first driver to win five of the first 13 races since Jeff Gordon in 1997. A week later in the All-Star Race, Harvick continued his winning streak yet again, winning stages 1 and 3 and held off Daniel Suárez to win for the first time in 11 years after winning it in 2007 driving the No. 29 car for RCR. Over the next seven races, Harvick would finish outside the top five only twice: at Charlotte after a tire failure, and Daytona after getting caught in an Overtime wreck. At New Hampshire, Harvick stayed in the top 10 for most of the race and with less than 15 to go, Harvick used the bump and run on Kyle Busch and held onto the lead to get his sixth win of the year, the best in his career. He finished fourth at Pocono and 10th at Watkins Glen. Coming into Michigan, Harvick had finished second six times since winning there in 2010. He won both stages and led 108 laps en route to his seventh win of the season.

In the playoffs, Harvick earned consistent finishes and used playoff points to advance himself toward the Round of 8, where he earned his eighth win of the season at Texas after winning both stages 1 and 2. However, he was penalized 40 points and had the win encumbered due to a spoiler infraction post-race, which put him 3 points above the cut-line heading to Phoenix. Harvick overcame a flat tire during the Phoenix race to secure enough points to make the Championship 4 at Homestead. In the season finale, Harvick ran up front for most of the early part of the race but his car got loose as the night went on. Harvick found himself in a position to win the race after pit strategy got him the lead in the final stage of the race but an ill-timed caution cost him the win. Harvick battled for the lead on the final restart but got overtaken by eventual winner Joey Logano. Harvick stated &quot;We just got beat tonight&quot; after the race. He finished the season third in the points standings, winning a career-high eight races and tying Kyle Busch for the most wins of the year.

===2019===

Harvick started his 2019 season by winning Duel 1 of the 2019 Gander RV Duels at Daytona. He finished 26th at the 2019 Daytona 500 after a late crash. Following Daytona, Harvick went on to finish in the top 10 6 straight times including 3 top-fives. Following Texas was an up-and-down stretch that lasted until race #19. At Bristol Motor Speedway, he finished a mediocre 13th after getting through traffic. Richmond was not bad as he was consistently in the top 5 all night and finished 4th. Things took a hard turn at Talladega where he earned his second DNF of the season, all on SuperSpeedways. Harvick bounced back with a 4th-place finish at Dover. He got the pole at Kansas and looked as if he was going to win but a poor stop by his crew members regulated him to finish 13th instead. Harvick almost won the All-Star race but finished second behind Kyle Larson. He then finished 10th at the Coca-Cola 600. A loose wheel at Pocono made him suffer a 22nd-place finish. Then in the next two races, he finished inside the top 7. He then finished outside the top 10 in the next three races. At Chicagoland, Harvick did well in both stages but a loose wheel got him to finish a mediocre 14th-place finish. Then next weekend, he finished 29th after getting collected in the Big One but still was able to run at the finish line driving his wrecked car. Then Kentucky was worse as he finished 22nd again. Heading into New Hampshire, Harvick had decent numbers but still was winless throughout the season after 19 races. Then in the next 7 races, he finished in the top 7 in 6 races. His only finish outside the top 10 was at Bristol as he suffered a DNF thanks to a transmission problem. He added this great momentum with wins at New Hampshire, Michigan, and Indianapolis. His Playoffs was also consistent as in the Round of 16, he finished 2nd at Las Vegas, 7th at Richmond, and finished third at the Charlotte Roval to advance to the Round of 12 and his average finish during those three races in the Round of 16 was an insane 4.0 during that stretch. At Talladega, Harvick made his 677th career start in the Cup Series, one more than the total career starts of Dale Earnhardt. His worse finish during the Playoffs was 17th at Talladega, after getting collected in the Big One but once again was able to finish the race. He scored his fourth win of the season at Texas to make his fifth appearance in the Championship 4 in the last six years. He went on to finish third in the standings for the third consecutive season after finishing fourth at Homestead.

===2020: Regular Season Championship ===

To start the 2020 season, Harvick finished fourth in Duel 2 of the Bluegreen Vacations Duels at Daytona. Despite sustaining minor damage, he finished fifth at the Daytona 500, his first top-five in the race since 2016. He stayed consistently in the top 10 at Las Vegas, Fontana, and Phoenix before the season was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On February 22, Harvick and Camping World CEO Marcus Lemonis offered a 100,000 reward to any full-time Cup Series driver who can beat Kyle Busch in the Truck Series. Corey LaJoie, Austin Dillon, Landon Cassill, and Timmy Hill were among those who showed interest in the challenge. Chase Elliott ultimately took up the bounty and won it in the Truck Series&#x27; first race back from the season pause at Charlotte.

When racing resumed on May 17, Harvick scored his 50th career win at The Real Heroes 400 at Darlington. The win allowed him to surpass his car owner Tony Stewart to become the 12th winningest driver in Cup Series history. Further victories came during the summer in the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta (where he celebrated in a similar manner to his 2001 victory there), the Pocono Organics 325 at Pocono (his first win at the track), the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis (after fellow championship contender Denny Hamlin blew a tire late), and a sweep of the Michigan doubleheader (becoming the first driver to win Cup races on back-to-back days since Richard Petty in 1971).

Following his seventh win of the season in the second Drydene 311 at Dover International Speedway, Harvick clinched the regular-season championship.

After a 20th-place finish at Daytona, Harvick opened the first round of the playoffs on a high note by holding off Austin Dillon to win his second Southern 500 and outdueled Kyle Busch two weeks later to win the Bristol Night Race for the second time in his career, becoming the first driver to win at least nine times in a season since Carl Edwards in 2008. Despite these achievements, Harvick was eliminated in the Round of 8 after finishing 17th at Martinsville. He finished fifth in the points standings, and went the entire season without a DNF for only the fourth time in his career. Under a full season format, Harvick would&#x27;ve won his 4th championship in 2020 and lock up the championship 2 races early in Texas and win the title by 82 points over Denny Hamlin.

===2021: Fourth winless season and feud with Chase Elliott===

Harvick began the 2021 Cup season with three consecutive top-ten finishes and was one of two drivers to do that, the other being Michael McDowell. His streak ended in the fourth race at Las Vegas when he finished 20th after starting on the pole. Harvick finished 37th at the inaugural Circuit of the Americas race after Bubba Wallace collided with him under rainy conditions, sustaining his first DNF since the 2019 Bass Pro Shops NRA Night Race. He, later on, criticized NASCAR for allowing the race to proceed with poor visibility. Despite scoring no wins for the first time since 2009, Harvick managed to make the playoffs with his consistency.

In March, he returned to the Truck Series for the first time since 2015 when he joined David Gilliland Racing to drive their No. 17 in the Bristol dirt race. Stewart-Haas also brought back their second Xfinity car for Harvick to run three road course races at Circuit of the Americas, Road America, and the Indianapolis Road Course, all of which were new to the Cup Series schedule that year. He ended up in the Nos. 5 and 99 for B. J. McLeod Motorsports in collaboration with Stewart-Haas Racing.

Despite lacking the bonus points of the other playoff contenders, Harvick stayed consistent enough to make it to the Round of 12. At the Bristol Night Race, he tangled with Chase Elliott, causing the latter to fall out of contention after cutting a tire. Harvick led the race on the closing laps, but a lapped Elliott created enough traffic to slow down Harvick, allowing Kyle Larson to overtake him for the win. This resulted in a heated verbal confrontation between Harvick and Elliott after the race. Neither driver was reprimanded by NASCAR. During the Charlotte Roval race, Harvick bumped Elliott and sent him to the wall with rear-end damage. Harvick later experienced brake failure and crashed head-on to the turn 1 wall. As a result, he was eliminated from the Round of 12, the earliest elimination from Playoff contention in his career. Despite this and going winless for the first time since 2009, he once again finished fifth in the final standings.

===2022: Highs and lows with the Next-Gen===

Harvick began the 2022 season with a 30th-place finish at the 2022 Daytona 500. Aside from four DNFs, he stayed consistent with his finishes until he won at Michigan, breaking a 65-race drought to become the 15th different winner in the season. Harvick then scored his 60th, and final, career victory at Richmond a week later. At the Southern 500, Harvick finished 33rd after his car caught fire, which resulted in being relegated to 16th and last in the Playoff standings. The following week at Kansas, Harvick slammed the wall on lap 33 after Ross Chastain made contact with Bubba Wallace, resulting in Harvick&#x27;s third consecutive DNF for the first time in his career. Harvick was eliminated in the Round of 16 after finishing 10th and being in a must-win situation at the Bristol night race. On October 5, Childers was suspended for four races and fined 100,000 for an L2 Penalty during post-race inspection after the Talladega playoff race. The penalty came under Sections 14.1 (vehicle assembly) and 14.5 (body) in the NASCAR Rule Book, both of which pertain to the body and overall vehicle assembly rules surrounding modification of a single-source supplied part. In addition, the No. 4 team was docked 100 driver and owner points. Harvick finished the season 15th in the points standings, his first points finish outside the top 10 since 2009.

===2023: Final full-time season===

On January 12, 2023, Harvick announced he would retire at the end of the 2023 season. He started the season with a 12th-place finish at the 2023 Daytona 500. He then followed up by getting 3 consecutive Top 10s, almost winning at Phoenix for his 10th time when a caution forced a Green-White-Checkered Finish, in which he finished 5th. In his final appearance at the All-Star Race, Harvick&#x27;s car used the No. 29 and a throwback paint scheme honoring his first career win at Atlanta in 2001. Despite not winning a race, Harvick stayed consistent enough to make the playoffs on his final season. He was eliminated at the conclusion of the Round of 16. At Talladega, Harvick finished second to Ryan Blaney, but was later disqualified after post-race inspection discovered a violation involving the car&#x27;s windshield fasteners. Harvick finished his Cup Series career with a seventh-place finish at Phoenix and 13th in the points standings.

=== 2024 ===
On April 28, 2024, it was announced that Harvick would be the standby driver for Kyle Larson at North Wilkesboro Speedway for the 2024 NASCAR All-Star race. Harvick took part in practice and qualifying.

==Other racing==
===American Canadian Tour and ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series===
On July 21, 2008, Harvick won $37,300 at the 35th annual TD Bank 250 presented by New England Dodge Dealers in Oxford, Maine. Harvick defeated tour regulars; Glen Luce and Joey Polewarczyk Jr to become the first active NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver to win the 250. The event is traditionally one of New England&#x27;s major short track races. Since his 1998 West Series championship, he has competed in four races with one win. He also made two starts in the ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series in 1999 for Childress in the No. 20 Invinca-Shields/Realtree Chevrolet, finishing in the top-five both times.

===CARS Tour===
On January 9, 2023, a consortium consisting of Kevin Harvick Incorporated, DEJ Management, Jeff Burton Autosports, Inc., and Trackhouse Racing Team purchased the CARS Tour.

==Broadcasting career==
On January 25, 2015, it was reported that Harvick, along with Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski, and Danica Patrick, would serve as a rotating analyst for Xfinity Series races with &quot;NASCAR on Fox&quot;. Harvick was the first of the four to commentate, starting at Daytona; he also worked at Las Vegas, Dover, and the Truck Series race at Talladega.

In June 2017, Harvick was the play-by-play commentator for the &quot;Fox NASCAR&quot; broadcast of the Xfinity race at Pocono as part of a Cup drivers-only coverage, he worked alongside Joey Logano and Clint Bowyer in the broadcast booth. Fox brought back the Drivers Only broadcast in 2018 at Talladega and 2019 at Charlotte in May, and the trio reprised their roles in the booth both years.

Harvick was not one of Fox&#x27;s guest analysts in 2020, and &quot;Drivers Only&quot; was not done that year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in 2021, Harvick was included in the lineup of guest analysts, and he served as a color commentator at Darlington in May.

On February 5, 2023, Fox Sports and Harvick announced that he would be joining the Fox NASCAR broadcast booth in 2024, joining Mike Joy and former RCR and SHR teammate Clint Bowyer starting in 2024.

==Personal life==

Harvick married DeLana (Linville) Harvick on February 28, 2001, in Las Vegas, Nevada, shortly after his Cup Series debut. They had met the previous year at Michigan International Speedway where at the time she was working in public relations for fellow driver Randy LaJoie. DeLana had worked in a similar capacity for Jeff Gordon previously and had even dabbled in race driving herself. DeLana is an active participant in Harvick&#x27;s career, co-owning and working with KHI Management LLC, as well as frequently appearing on Harvick&#x27;s pit box during Cup races.

The couple live in Charlotte, North Carolina with their son Keelan, who was born on July 8, 2012, and daughter Piper Harvick, born on December 28, 2017. Keelan competes in kart racing and legend car racing. In April 2021, Keelan joined his father in an eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series race.

Harvick is an avid fan of the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL and Eric Lindros possibly was his favorite player. He also stated during the ESPN broadcast of the 2011 5-hour Energy 500, while there was a rain delay, that he was a fan of the New York Yankees baseball team. On August 10, 2011, Harvick threw out the ceremonial first pitch between the Yankees and the Los Angeles Angels at Yankee Stadium.

===Kevin Harvick Foundation===
Established in 2010 by Harvick and his wife, DeLana, the mission of the Kevin Harvick Foundation (KHF) is to support programs that enrich the lives of children throughout the United States. The foundation works to not only improve the quality of life, but to help underprivileged youth find and realize their dreams by supporting programs such as the Kevin Harvick Athletic Scholarship Fund at California State University, Bakersfield, a camper cabin at Victory Junction, Baptist Children&#x27;s Homes of NC, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, and Kevin&#x27;s Krew.

==In media==
Harvick has made several TV talk show appearances during his career on shows such as &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, &quot;Jim Rome is Burning&quot;, and &quot;The Tony Danza Show&quot;. He was also on the first season of FX&#x27;s &quot;NASCAR Drivers: 360&quot;. It took an in-depth look at NASCAR drivers outside the track and the preparation it takes to be a NASCAR driver. Harvick has also been on &quot;MTV Cribs&quot;.

In early 2003 Harvick is featured on the cover NASCAR Racing 2003 Season alongside Jimmie Johnson.

In 2004, game show &quot;Family Feud&quot; hosted a NASCAR special involving Harvick, with help from fellow Californian and then-host Richard Karn. In the special, Harvick faced off against fellow race-car driver Jeremy Mayfield and his foundation, playing Family Feud on behalf of the Kevin Harvick Foundation. Although they did not win, Harvick and his team were able to score off 276 points, winning $276 for their charity.

On February 19, 2011, Harvick&#x27;s sponsor, Budweiser hosted &quot;The Roast of Kevin Harvick&quot;, which had some of Harvick&#x27;s opponents and teammates give their thoughts and opinions on the Sprint Cup driver.

In 2023, Kern County Raceway Park was given new ownership to Tim and Lisa Huddleston, the track was renamed as Kevin Harvick&#x27;s Kern Raceway in his honor.

===Nicknames===
Harvick was nicknamed &quot;Happy Harvick&quot; ironically due to his occasional temper outbursts. His pit sign, which was a smiley face, was a play on the nickname. He also received the nickname &quot;The Closer&quot; for his ability to make late passes for the win (often with the commentators asking &quot;Where did he come from?&quot; because he often made them from a considerable distance behind, usually taking advantage of the leader running out of fuel in the last few corners).

<text>An honors student or honor student is a student recognized for achieving high grades or high marks in their coursework at school.

==United States==

In the United States, honors students may refer to:
# Students recognized for their academic achievement on lists published periodically throughout the school year, known as the Honor Roll, varying from school to school, shows the student going above and beyond academic achievement and from enlarged different levels of education.
# Students enrolled in designated Advanced Placement courses, subject-specific honors courses, or school-based honors programs.
# Students who are members of the National Honor Society or other honor society.

Honors students are often recognized for their above-average academic achievements. A student who has made numerous appearances on the honour roll may be bestowed with some form of academic letter, certificate, or any other form of notification in recognition of their academic achievements. A similar concept to honour rolls exists in colleges and universities in Canada and the United States, known as the Dean&#x27;s List.

A growing archive of honor students can be found online.

==Elsewhere in the world==

In other countries, the meaning of honors can refer either to a specific type of academic degree or to the level of distinction with which an undergraduate degree was earned.

Honours degrees are usually four-year programs (sometimes also three-year programs, e.g., in England). A student who holds a &quot;de jure&quot; Honours degree is eligible for direct entry either to a Doctorate (Ph.D.) or to a two- to three years very-high-research Master&#x27;s degree program.

&#x27;Honours&#x27; can also mean that students have achieved their degree with a high overall average GPA and typically have undertaken a small final project, paper or essay (also known in the UK as a dissertation). See British undergraduate degree classification.

A third meaning is a postgraduate &quot;with Honors&quot; or &quot;cum honored&quot; degree, which is (part of) an academic degree itself, e.g. the one-year Bachelor with Honors degree in Australia, the one-year Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree in Canada or the four-year integrated Master with Honors degree in Scotland. Postgraduate Honors degree programs generally involve completion of master&#x27;s level courses and the submission of a long high-research thesis.

===Philippines===
In the Philippine education system, while an &quot;honor student&quot; can be used to denote students in undergraduate programs who achieved academic excellence, &quot;honor student&quot; can also refer to students under the basic education system (K-12) that obtained a transmuted grade of at least 90% after a quadmester (i.e. quarter).

Honor students are classified into three tiers: With Honors (90-94%), With High Honors (95-97%) and With Highest Honors (98-100%). Previously, students that achieved academic excellence were ranked solely by their transmuted grades.

== Criticism ==
Some researchers have questioned the validity of the honor roll as an effective form of positive reinforcement. It is argued that the pursuit of extrinsic reward is not an accurate reflection of intrinsic interest in course material. Many other criteria should also be employed to judge a student including standardized test scores, research experience, breadth and the level of courses taken, and academic-related extracurriculars performance. Writing honors thesis or semi-independent research in a subject may be more signal of interest or academic potential than achieving the label of &quot;Honors Student.&quot; There are also questions on the effectiveness of separating high-achieving students from their peers, in the form of magnet schools or honors courses or Gifted and Talented Education.

== Honors courses ==
An honors course is a class in which the most advanced students are placed. Most students placed in honors courses are highly motivated and dedicated to their academics and educational experience. Honors classes are more academically challenging and rigorous, also cover advanced course material, permit more in-depth study than a standard course of study and may require independent research.

Self-motivation is the main quality that characterizes an honors student. In addition to being committed to academics, they are encouraged and many participate in volunteer work, organizations and clubs, cooperative education, research, study abroad and cultural activities.

Honors programs have specific entrance requirements and completion criteria in order to graduate with Honors, or cum laude.

<doc id="1314374" wikidata="Q4347992" url="?curid=1314374" title="1946 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1946 United States Senate elections were held November 5, 1946, in the middle of Democratic President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s first term after Roosevelt&#x27;s passing. The 32 seats of Class 1 were contested in regular elections, and four special elections were held to fill vacancies. The Republicans took control of the Senate by picking up twelve seats, mostly from the Democrats. This was the first time since 1932 that the Republicans had held the Senate, recovering from a low of 16 seats following the 1936 Senate elections.

The vote was largely seen as a referendum on Truman, whose approval rating had sunk to 32% over the president&#x27;s controversial handling of a wave of post-war labor strikes, such as a nationwide railroad strike in May, at a time when Americans depended on train service for both commuter and long-distance travel. Just as damaging was Truman&#x27;s back-and-forth over whether to end unpopular wartime price controls to handle shortages, particularly in foodstuffs. For example, price controls on beef had led to a &quot;hamburger famine,&quot; but when Truman, in a surprise move, lifted the controls on October 14—just weeks before the election—meat prices shot up to record levels.

This is only one of two occasions in U.S. history that 10 or more Senate seats changed hands in a midterm election (the other being in 1958), and also one of five occasions where 10 or more Senate seats changed hands in any election, with the other occasions being in 1920, 1932, 1958, and 1980.

The president&#x27;s lack of popular support is widely seen as the reason for the Democrats&#x27; congressional defeat, the largest since they were trounced in the 1928 pro-Republican wave that brought Herbert Hoover to power. And for the first time since before the Great Depression, Republicans were seen as the party which could best handle the American economy.

However, the Republicans also benefited from what today would be called &quot;a good map,&quot; meaning that of the one-third of Senate seats up for election, the majority were held by Democrats. Besides the Republicans being able to hold onto all of their seats, this was the party&#x27;s largest senate gain since 1920.

<text>Tomás António Gonzaga (11 August 1744c. 1810) was a Portuguese poet. One of the most famous Neoclassic writers in colonial Brazil, he was also the &quot;ouvidor&quot; and the ombudsman of the city of Ouro Preto (formerly &quot;Vila Rica&quot;), as well as the of the appeal court in Bahia. He wrote under the pen name Dirceu.

He is patron of the 37th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.

==Biography==
Gonzaga was born in the &quot;freguesia&quot; (or parish) of Miragaia, in Porto, to João Bernardo Gonzaga and Tomásia Isabel Clark, who was of British descent. Tomásia died when Gonzaga was 1 year old, and soon after his mother&#x27;s death, he and his father moved to Recife, and then to Bahia, where João Bernardo served at the magistrature and was of the appeal court, and Gonzaga studied at a Jesuit school. Gonzaga was sent back to Portugal as a teenager, to the University of Coimbra, to finish his studies and, at 24 years old, he finished his Law course. He presented himself as a candidate for a chair at the University, with the thesis &quot;Tratado de Direito Natural&quot;, heavily influenced by Enlightenment ideals.

Gonzaga became the of the city of Beja in 1778, until 1781. In the following year, he returned to Brazil, becoming the of the city of Vila Rica (nowadays Ouro Preto). He held this post until 1789, when he was accused of being involved with the Minas Conspiracy. Arrested, he was sent to a prison in Ilha das Cobras, Rio de Janeiro. He spent three years in prison, and although he asserted his innocence, the authorities were influenced by his friendship with the conspirators. In 1792 he was sentenced to perpetual exile in Angola, later commuted to a ten-year exile on the Island of Mozambique. By that time, he was engaged to a woman named Maria Doroteia Joaquina de Seixas Brandão, possibly the &quot;Marília&quot; of his verses. His hope of being freed from his prison in order to see his beloved again is a prominent theme of the second part of his poetry book &quot;Marília de Dirceu&quot;.

Arriving at Mozambique, he fell ill and was charitably received by a wealthy Portuguese gentleman. He then married his daughter, Juliana de Sousa Mascarenhas, having with her two children: Ana and Alexandre.

Gonzaga lived the rest of his life in exile, having a wealthy and happy life and becoming a lawyer. He would die of a tropical disease he contracted; his date of death is unknown, although it is commonly accepted to be in 1810. His remains are currently interred at the Museu da Inconfidência in Ouro Preto.

==Works==
* &quot;Marília de Dirceu&quot;, poetry book (1792)
* &quot;Cartas Chilenas&quot;, discontinued series of satirical poems (1863)
His reputation rests on &quot;Marília&quot;, which contains all his published verses and is organized into two parts, corresponding with the stages of his life, the second having been written in prison.

==Representations in popular culture==
* Gonzaga was portrayed in many Brazilian telenovels and films. He was portrayed by Gianfrancesco Guarnieri in the telenovel &quot;Dez Vidas&quot; (1969); by Luiz Linhares in the film &quot;Os Inconfidentes&quot; (1972) and by Eduardo Galvão in the film &quot;Tiradentes&quot; (1999).
* In the 1984 children&#x27;s book &quot;A Ladeira da Saudade&quot;, by Brazilian author Ganymédes José, Gonzaga&#x27;s unrequited love by Maria Doroteia is explored on a more modern context.

<doc id="1314381" wikidata="Q294592" url="?curid=1314381" title="Public Against Violence">
<text>Public Against Violence (, VPN) was a political movement established in Bratislava, Slovakia in November 1989. It was the Slovak counterpart of the Czech Civic Forum.

==Velvet Revolution==

Public Against Violence (VPN) was founded during the Velvet Revolution, which overthrew the Communist Party rule in Czechoslovakia. After riot police cracked down on a student demonstration in Prague on the 17 November 1989 a growing series of demonstrations were held in Czechoslovakia. On the 19 November Civic Forum was founded in Prague as a coalition of opposition groups demanding the removal of the Communist leadership. The same evening a meeting was held in Bratislava, Slovakia attended by about 500 people where Public Against Violence was founded. The following day a first meeting of the coordinating committee of Public Against Violence took place.

Public Against Violence was similar to Civic Forum in being a broad movement in opposition to Communism. The founders of Public Against Violence included actor Milan Kňažko, dissident Ján Budaj and sociologist Fedor Gál, and the movement included cultural figures, religious and intellectual dissidents. Other early leaders included Catholic dissident Ján Čarnogurský whose trial was stopped during the revolution, František Mikloško and Miroslav Kusy, Vladimír Mečiar and the ex-leader of the Communist Party during the Prague Spring Alexander Dubček. Like Civic Forum, Public Against Violence called for the dominant role of the Communist Party to be ended, with a provisional government composed both of Communists and the opposition, leading to free elections. However Public Against Violence also called for relations between the Czechs and Slovaks to be altered in a new democratic federation.

Protests spread across Slovakia in November 1989 with branches of Public Against Violence being founded in many towns. Civic Forum and Public Against Violence worked together in negotiations with the Communist government, with Ján Čarnogurský representing Public Against Violence at talks together with Václav Havel for Civic Forum. After a two-hour general strike on 27 November demonstrated support for the opposition, agreement was reached on the 29 November for the leading role of the Communist Party to be ended.

==Interim government==
After the rejection by the opposition of an interim government which would have been largely Communist, another government of Czechoslovakia was formed on the 7 December 1989, with Slovak Communist Marián Čalfa as Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia. Čalfa went on to leave the Communist Party on the 18 January 1990 and would then join Public Against Violence. The government initially had an 11 to 10 majority of non-Communists, but this grew as people left the Communist party, while Václav Havel was elected President of Czechoslovakia and Alexander Dubček became the chair of the Federal Assembly.

In Slovakia a new government was also formed on the 12 December 1989 led by the Communist Minister of Justice Milan Čič, with equal numbers of Communists and non-Communists. Members of Public Against Violence formed part of the government, including Vladimír Mečiar as interior minister, and like Marián Čalfa nationally, Milan Čič would leave the Communist party in 1990 and joined Public Against Violence.

However Public Against Violence began to split even before the first democratic elections were held. At the beginning of 1990 Ján Čarnogurský and advocates of Christian democracy left Public Against Violence and founded the Christian Democratic Movement party in February 1990.

==1990 elections==

Going into the first free elections in June 1990 Public Against Violence wanted greater powers for Slovakia, but backed continuing the union between the Czechs and Slovaks. However they called for the emphasis to be on the economy and environment, rather than Slovak nationalism.

Candidates for Public Against Violence at the 1990 election included the prime minister of Czechoslovakia Marián Čalfa and Alexander Dubček, the ex-leader of the Communist Party during the Prague Spring.

In the lead up to the 1990 elections opinion polls showed Public Against Violence with between 18 and 25% support in Slovakia, behind the Christian Democratic Movement on 25 to 30%. Public Against Violence was reported to be suffering from an increase in Slovak nationalism and many rural voters saw intellectuals from Public Against Violence as alien to them. However Public Against Violence gained during the campaign on their anti-communist credentials with Václav Havel being well received when he campaigned in Slovakia. A poll on 1 June 1990 showed Public Against Violence ahead of the Christian Democratic Movement in Slovakia for the first time.

The election results saw Public Against Violence finish first in Slovakia, both in the federal and Slovak elections. In the federal election together the combination of Civic Forum and Public Against Violence won a majority, while in the Slovak election Public Against Violence came first but short of a majority. However, on election night one of the founders of Public Against Violence, deputy chairman Ján Budaj, announced his withdrawal from politics as he had been pressed to co-operate with the secret police in the 1970s.

Following the election Marián Čalfa of Public Against Violence continued to lead a coalition government nationally as Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia, while Vladimír Mečiar of Public Against Violence led a coalition government in Slovakia together with the Christian Democratic Movement.

==Split==

As time passed from the Velvet Revolution, the approval rating for both Civic Forum and Public Against Violence dropped from 60% in February 1990 to 38% in October 1990. In local elections held in November 1990 Public Against Violence came second to the Christian Democratic Movement in Slovakia. Public Against Violence was reported to have won 20.4% of the vote in Slovakia, compared to 27.4% for the Christian Democratic Movement. An opinion poll in November 1990 also showed support for Public Against Violence had fallen to 17%.

Public Against Violence faced tensions over the amount of power that should be held centrally in Czechoslovakia and how much should be held in Slovakia. This led to a split in March 1991 when the prime minister of Slovakia Vladimír Mečiar walked out of a leadership meeting of Public Against Violence and formed a rival wing of the party called PAV-Platform for Democratic Slovakia. Mečiar and his supporters had accused the leadership, including the leader Fedor Gál of being too close to Prague and Mečiar called for economic reforms to be less vigorous due to fears that Slovakia would lose the most economically. However the leadership of Public Against Violence accused Mečiar of wanting an independent Slovakia and of joining with Communists.

On the 23 April 1991 Vladimír Mečiar was replaced as Prime Minister of Slovakia by the leader of the Christian Democratic Movement Ján Čarnogurský. This came after the majority of Public Against Violence joined with the Christian Democratic Movement to replace Mečiar.

At an extraordinary party congress held on 27 April 1991, a new party called Movement for a Democratic Slovakia split off from Public Against Violence.

==Decline and dissolution==
Following the split the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia quickly became the most popular party in Slovakia and consistently led in the opinion polls in 1991 and 1992, while Mečiar was the most popular politician. Public Against Violence meanwhile dropped further in the polls to just 3% in July 1991, compared to 38% for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.

Also in July 1991 Alexander Dubček quit the Public Against Violence movement, accusing Public Against Violence of having moved too far to the right. Public Against Violence finally became a political party in October 1991 and renamed itself as Civic Democratic Union (Občianska demokratická únia, ODÚ) in March 1992.

The Civic Democratic Union contested the 1992 elections, but failed to win any seats. It won 4.0% of the Slovak vote for the House of the People, 4.0% for the House of Nations and 4.0% in the election for the Slovak National Council. The Civic Democratic Union finally dissolved in November 1992 and many former members of Civic Democratic Union would go on to join the Democratic Party in 1994.

Public Against Violence has been seen to have failed due to an inability to establish a popular constituency; instead concentrating on government and parliamentary activities. More nationalist politicians were able to exploit this and played on public distrust of a Public Against Violence, that was perceived to be composed of the elite.

<text>Alien vs. Predator (エイリアンVSプレデター) is a 1994 beat &#x27;em up video game developed and released by Capcom for the CPS-2 arcade game system. It is based on the science fiction franchise of the same name. Introducing an original fighter to the game: &quot;Lt. Kurosawa&quot;, the players take control of up to three from the selection of four cyborgs and Predator characters in a battle against the Xenomorph hordes and rogue human soldiers.

The game was very well received by the public and media publications, but was never ported to any home systems.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; uses a control setup with an eight-directional joystick and three buttons: one to attack, one to jump, and one to shoot. The default cabinet for the game allows as many as three players to play simultaneously, although some smaller cabinets only accommodate two players. Four characters are available for the players&#x27; use: two cyborg soldiers, Major Dutch Schaefer and Lieutenant Linn Kurosawa; and two Predators, a Hunter and a Warrior.

Three of the four characters are equipped with a melee weapon: a katana for Linn, a bladed naginata staff for the Hunter, and an extendable-retractable spear/staff for the Warrior. Dutch has no such weapon, but can hit enemies with his cybernetic arm; in addition, he can hold and swing any melee weapon dropped by another character, instead of throwing it as the other playable characters do.

Each character is also equipped with a projectile weapon for ranged attacks. Linn uses a rapid-firing handgun, Dutch has a smart gun in his cybernetic arm, and the Predators both use shoulder-mounted energy weapons. Ammunition is represented by a meter near the bottom of the screen; when the meter is depleted, the character is unable to fire until it refills. Linn&#x27;s ammunition refills the fastest and allows the most shots, but she is completely defenseless while she reloads. Dutch and the Predators can move and fight while waiting for their ammunition to refill, and unlike Linn&#x27;s automatic pistol, their meters will gradually refill when not firing.

Assorted weapons such as grenade launchers and flamethrowers can be found or taken from fallen enemies, but these have a limited ammunition supply. The player can also find jewels for bonus points, or food and medicine to restore lost health.

==Plot==
San Drad (Japanized English: &quot;San Dorado&quot;, サン・ドラド), California, has been overrun by the Xenomorphs, and the cybernetically enhanced Major Dutch Schaefer and Lieutenant Linn Kurosawa of the United States Colonial Marine Corps have been abandoned by their superiors and are cornered by a swarm of the Alien drones. Before they can be killed, a pair of the Predators appear and destroy the Aliens. The Predators offer an alliance with the two cyborgs in order to stop the Alien infestation.

The players take control of up to three of four characters: Dutch, Linn, a Predator hunter, and a Predator warrior, and battle the Aliens through seven stages. After destroying the Aliens&#x27; hive, the characters discover that the Alien presence on Earth is the result of a bio-war project headed by the renegade General Bush working for the Weyland-Yutani corporation. They board Bush&#x27;s military ship as it lifts off, aiming to stop him from carrying out his breeding program any further. While Bush curses the protagonists for foiling his plans, the Alien Queen, having survived the previous encounter, kills him. After defeating the queen, the group programs the ship to crash into San Drad, triggering a huge explosion that eliminates all Alien life on Earth. The Predator Warrior then gives his wrist blades to Dutch and Linn in recognition of their skills as warriors, before the Predators depart back into space. Linn asks the Predators why they chose to help them, and the Predators&#x27; vague reply makes her and Dutch wonder whether they will have to fight them the next time they return to Earth.

==Characters==

The game features four characters: two U.S. Colonial Marines that ally with a pair of Predators. Each character has varying levels of speed, strength and agility, and different attacks.
* Predator Warrior (プレデター・ウォリアー)—The older of the two Predators, the Warrior is a well-balanced and powerful character with no weaknesses; he boasts excellent reach, damage, and priority in all of his attacks.
* Predator Hunter (プレデター・ハンター)—The Hunter is the younger of the two Predators. He plays similarly to the Warrior, but lacks the quick recovery and high priority in many of his attacks. However, he compensates with having a more damaging jumping dive attack.
*Major Dutch Schaefer (ダッチ・シェーファー)—Dutch is named after and roughly based on Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s character in the original &quot;Predator&quot; film. He is a human cyborg and has a cybernetic arm with a smart gun mounted on it. His attacks are powerful but slow, and he dashes forward instead of jumping. Dutch is able to powerbomb enemies for massive damage.
* Lieutenant Linn Kurosawa (リン・クロサワ)—Linn is a human cyborg who uses a handgun and katana as weapons and can execute several martial arts attacks. She is faster and more agile than Dutch, but is less powerful and has a shorter reach with her regular combo.

==Development and release==
The game was based on an early draft of a script for a film adaptation of the &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; comic book series following Machiko Noguchi, and was intended to have been a tie-in to the movie. Although the draft was later rejected in favor of a different script which entered development hell, later releasing in 2004 with a different story, Capcom had already completed the game intending for the film to be released around the time of the game&#x27;s completion, and so the arcade game was released in 1994 with its own stand-alone storyline, the Machiko Noguchi character renamed Linn Kurosawa due to a lack of licensing from Dark Horse Comics, and Dutch Schaefer from the 1987 &quot;Predator&quot; film included as another playable character, alongside two Predators.

A 32X version of the game was planned, but never released. An unrelated &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; beat &#x27;em up game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was developed by Jorudan and published by Activision. In 2019, Capcom announced that the game would be included on its Capcom Home Arcade dedicated console.

==Reception==
&quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; has been very well received by critics. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the game on their July 15, 1994 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the month, outperforming titles like &quot;Fantastic Journey&quot; and &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot;. In North America, &quot;RePlay&quot; reported &quot;AVP&quot; to be the most-popular arcade game at the time. &quot;Play Meter&quot; also listed the game to be the sixth most-popular arcade game at the time. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a maximum score of 5.0 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and fun factor). &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; hailed it as &quot;everything you&#x27;d expect from the makers of games like &quot;Street Fighter 2&quot; and &quot;The Punisher&quot;.&quot; According to a GameSpot retrospective, &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; featured &quot;gorgeous graphics and special effects&quot; and &quot;was quite an adventure and one hell of a coin cruncher.&quot;

In 2013, it was ranked as the 12th top beat &#x27;em up video game of all time by Heavy.com and included among the best looking beat &#x27;em up games from the 16-bit era by Kotaku. That same year, Arcade Sushi ranked it as the second best retro game in the genre, stating that &quot;without a doubt, this is one of the greatest looking (and greatest playing), arcade beat &#x27;em ups of all time.&quot;

According to Destructoid in 2009, &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; is an &quot;arcade classic still fondly remembered by many today.&quot; &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; called it an &quot;excellent game&quot; and &quot;an unconverted classic, which, in our opinion, stands tall as one of the very best examples of licence mash-up ever seen in a video game.&quot; In 2013, Capcom stated that more fans have been asking for it to receive an HD remake than for any other of their &quot;retro&quot; games. In 2015, Hardcore Gamer included it among the 200 best games of all time. In 2023, Time Extension included the game on their top 25 &quot;Best Beat &#x27;Em Ups of All Time&quot; list.

==Legacy==
Lt. Linn Kurosawa (described by &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; as &quot;a Taki-resembling [although Taki came after] heroine with ninja reflexes and attacks&quot;) has made cameo appearances in some later Capcom games, namely &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact&quot;, and &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot; (where Sylphie, the shopkeeper from &quot;Forgotten Worlds&quot;, transforms into Kurosawa as part of her super attack). Much of her design has been re-used for the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series&#x27; popular character Ibuki, introduced in 1997 (who, incidentally, has a fellow ninja classmate and friend named Sarai Kurosawa), and she also resembles Simone from Capcom&#x27;s and Psikyo&#x27;s 2000 shooter &quot;Cannon Spike&quot;.

According to former Treasure designer Tetsuhiko &quot;Han&quot; Kikuchi, &quot;Mad Stalker: Full Metal Forth&quot; and the arcade &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; were the main inspirations for his 1996 beat &#x27;em up &quot;Guardian Heroes&quot;. It was also one of the inspirations for the makers of &quot;River City Ransom: Underground&quot;.

In 2017, toy company NECA announced that they had gained the license to the video game, and would be producing figures based on its characters, starting with the Aliens and Predators. The figures came complete with retro packaging inspired by the game&#x27;s arcade cabinet art. The following year, NECA revealed that they would also be releasing action figures of Linn and Dutch.

<text>Fendalton is a suburb of Christchurch, in the South Island of New Zealand.

==History==
Fendalton was originally known as Fendall Town, named after the original settler of the land, Walpole Chesshyre Fendall (1830–1913). Fendall emigrated from Yorkshire in 1850 and took up land north of the Waimairi Stream. The name Fendall Town was soon applied to the area northwest of Hagley Park, extending as far as the modern location of Christchurch International Airport and including portions of Burnside, Bryndwr, and Harewood, among others. Early spelling also included Fendall&#x27;s Town and Fendaltown, but by the 1880s Fendalton had become the most common form.
Fendalton was the site for many early buildings in the settlement of Christchurch, including an early flour mill along what is now Fendalton Road. This flour mill was constructed by Daniel Inwood, who came to New Zealand aboard the &quot;Sir George Seymour&quot; in 1850, and used machinery which Inwood brought with him from England.

The suburb is also home to multiple significant historical buildings, especially as examples of various styles of homestead. These include St Barnabas Church, Daresbury, and Los Angeles, one of the first examples of a California bungalow to be built in New Zealand.

<doc id="1314405" wikidata="Q1436430" url="?curid=1314405" title="Don Doko Don">
<text>is a platform arcade game developed and released by Taito in 1989. In the game, the player(s) control two lumberjacks, Bob and Jim, with the objective being to clear the screen of all the enemies. Bob and Jim use their mallets to stun the enemies, pick up the enemies, then throw them at a wall, or other enemies to kill them off, resulting in bonus points. Bonus items also appear during stages that will have varying effects on the players.

Taito and ITL ported the game to both the Family Computer and PC-Engine in 1990, both of which remained exclusive to Japan. A sequel game, aptly named &quot;Don Doko Don 2&quot;, was released in 1992 for the Family Computer in Japan, developed by Natsume. The gameplay has been often compared to Taito&#x27;s earlier platform games, specifically &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; and &quot;The NewZealand Story&quot;. The original arcade version of the game was included in both &quot;Taito Memories Joukan&quot; and &quot;Taito Legends 2&quot; in 2005, the &quot;Egret II Mini&quot; in 2022 and the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series in 2023.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Don Doko Don&quot; is a platform arcade game. The player(s) control two lumberjacks, Bob and Jim, on their quest to save the princess and king of Marry Land. They go through a series of single-screen stages, with the objective of killing all the enemies on the stage. Bob and Jim defeat enemies by using a mallet to stun them. They can then pick stunned enemies up and throw them at other enemies to destroy them, which gives bonus points, depending on how many enemies are in the path of the thrown enemy. Destroyed enemies leave behind fruit which can be collected for points. Once all enemies are destroyed play proceeds to the next level which is generally more difficult. Throughout the game, various power-ups can be collected, which represent potions, hammers, or books, help the players&#x27; character speed up, receive more power, or kill in different ways.

If the player(s) take too long to complete a level, a flying devil (much like the ones featured in &quot;The Fairyland Story&quot; and &quot;The NewZealand Story&quot;) will come into the level to kill the player(s).

Beating the game normally will result in a bad ending in which only the princess will be saved, but by unlocking a secret set of levels via a shortcut on the first stage, the player(s) will be able to access the good ending in which the king is saved as well.

== Release ==
&quot;Don Doko Don&quot; was released by Taito in Japan in July 1989.

=== Conversions ===
The game was later ported over to the Family Computer by IPL, and published by Taito on March 9, 1990. A PC Engine version, also ported by IPL, was published by Taito later that same year on May 31. The original arcade version is also featured on the &quot;Taito Memories Joukan&quot; and &quot;Taito Legends 2&quot; arcade game compilations via emulation. The Family Computer version was later re-released on a handheld made by My Arcade, along with &quot;Don Doko Don 2&quot; and the Family Computer version of &quot;Chack&#x27;n Pop&quot;.

== Reception and legacy ==

&quot;Don Doko Don&quot; enjoyed some success in Japanese arcades. &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed it as the twelfth most-successful table arcade unit of the month in their August 15, 1989 issue. The later home ports received a rather mixed reception by &quot;Famitsu&quot;. However, Robert Swan of &quot;Computer + Video Games&quot; gave the PC Engine port a highly positive review, stating that while &quot;there&#x27;s nothing new or original about it&quot;, it was &quot;playable to the max&quot;.

Retrospective views on the game have been mostly positive. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; has given the game three positive retrospectives, two for the arcade version, and one for the PC Engine version, due to its inclusion on their &quot;PC Engine GT: Ten Perfect Games&quot; list, all of which praised the game for its basic, yet captivating gameplay, a trait they attributed to most other platform games made by Taito. &quot;GamesTM&quot; were similarly positive for their two retrospectives (due to the game&#x27;s inclusion on both &quot;Taito Memories Joukan&quot; and &quot;Taito Legends 2)&quot; on the game, although gave it criticism for not being as complex as &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;, and other games like it. &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; gave similar criticism, but argued that while &quot;doesn&#x27;t do much to be original compared to the million other &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;-like games at the time&quot;, they concluded that it&#x27;s still worth playing due to the fact that it is &quot;another example of a good platformer game from Taito&quot;. &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot;, however, was more critical of the game when criticizing the fact that &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; was a locked game in &quot;Taito Memories Jokan&quot;, claiming that while one could &quot;make do&quot; with it and &quot;The Fairyland Story&quot;, ultimately stated that it was &quot;decaf when you want espresso&quot;.

A sequel developed by Natsume, called &quot;Don Doko Don 2&quot;, was made for the Family Computer as well, but is more of a standard side-scrolling platformer instead.

<text>Unity was a video game being developed by Jeff Minter and Lionhead Studios for the GameCube. It was in development from the beginning of 2003 until its cancellation at the end of 2004. It was to feature Jeff Minter&#x27;s trademark psychedelic graphical style, meshed with an interactive music component. The music was to be provided by someone who was well-known and appropriate for the game&#x27;s style, but the participant was never revealed.

&quot;Unity&quot; was so highly anticipated that the UK games magazine &quot;Edge&quot; featured it on its February 2003 issue cover, with a full 8 page preview in the same issue. However, the project slipped off the release schedules soon after.

&quot;Unity&quot;&#x27;s cancellation was officially announced on Lionhead&#x27;s website on 10 December 2004. Minter and Lionhead both cited the &quot;ambitious and experimental&quot; nature of the project as reason for the mutual decision to cease development. Peter Molyneux was quoted as saying &quot;...it was becoming increasingly apparent to us that we would not be able to finish Unity in an acceptable time frame.&quot;

<text>Active vibration control is the active application of force in an equal and opposite fashion to the forces imposed by external vibration. With this application, a precision industrial process can be maintained on a platform essentially vibration-free.

Many precision industrial processes cannot take place if the machinery is being affected by vibration. For example, the production of semiconductor wafers requires that the machines used for the photolithography steps be used in an essentially vibration-free environment or the sub-micrometre features will be blurred. Active vibration control is now also commercially available for reducing vibration in helicopters, offering better comfort with less weight than traditional passive technologies.

In the past, passive techniques were used. These include traditional vibration dampers, shock absorbers, and base isolation.

The typical active vibration control system uses several components:
* A massive platform suspended by several active drivers (that may use voice coils, hydraulics, pneumatics, piezo-electric or other techniques)
* Three accelerometers that measure acceleration in the three degrees of freedom
* An electronic amplifier system that amplifies and inverts the signals from the accelerometers. A PID controller can be used to get better performance than a simple inverting amplifier.
* For very large systems, pneumatic or hydraulic components that provide the high drive power required.

If the vibration is periodic, then the control system may adapt to the ongoing vibration, thereby providing better cancellation than would have been provided simply by reacting to each new acceleration without referring to past accelerations.

Active vibration control has been successfully implemented for vibration attenuation of beam, plate and shell structures by numerous researchers.
For effective active vibration control, the structure should be smart enough to sense external disturbances and react accordingly. In order to develop an active structure (also known as smart structure), smart materials must be integrated or embedded with the structure. The smart structure involves sensors (strain, acceleration, velocity, force etc.), actuators (force, inertial, strain etc.) and a control algorithm (feedback or feed forward). The number of smart materials have been investigated and fabricated over the years; some of them are shape memory alloys, piezoelectric materials, optical fibers, electro-rheological fluids, magneto-strictive materials.

<doc id="1314439" wikidata="Q1753059" url="?curid=1314439" title="Death Cult Armageddon">
<text>Death Cult Armageddon is the sixth studio album by Norwegian symphonic black metal band Dimmu Borgir, released on 9 September 2003. It has since sold over 100,000 copies in the United States; the first album under Nuclear Blast to do so; and debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 169. The song &quot;Progenies of the Great Apocalypse&quot; was released as a single with an accompanying music video. This would also be the last album to have Nick Barker on drums.

The artwork within the album, done by Swiss artist Joachim Luetke, displays what appears to be an industrial factory, inside of which the band members are living out their fantasies, some of which are similar to scenes seen in the music video for &quot;Progenies of the Great Apocalypse&quot;. Most of the songs have a common apocalyptic theme.

==Release history==
&quot;Death Cult Armageddon&quot; saw initial release on CD, vinyl and DVD-Audio on 9 September 2003 under Nuclear Blast, the DVD-Audio edition featuring all three bonus tracks, the &quot;Progenies of the Great Apocalypse&quot; music video and photo galleries, which later featured on the Ozzfest edition bonus disc, and the Digipack editions featured the Bathory cover &quot;Satan My Master&quot;. The Chinese edition was later released on 3 November 2003 and the Japanese edition was released the following month on 23 December 2003 with the orchestral bonus tracks.

<text>Henri-Bourassa station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ahuntsic-Cartierville in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line. It is located in the Ahuntsic district. The station opened October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro. It was the eastern terminal of the Orange Line until 2007, when the line expanded to Montmorency station in Laval.

== Overview ==

The original part of the station, designed by Janusz Warunkiewicz, is a normal side platform station, connected by a transept and a long tunnel to a mezzanine some distance away. This in turn gives access to the station&#x27;s entrance on 575 Henri Bourassa Boulevard, integrated into a government building, the STM&#x27;s Terminus Henri-Bourassa Sud and the STL&#x27;s Terminus Henri-Bourassa Nord.

A second access, closer to the station&#x27;s platforms on Berri Street, was added later. It was designed by André Léonard and Claude Leclerc.

On April 26, 2010, Henri-Bourassa became the 6th station on the network to become accessible, following the installation of elevators.

=== Extension to Laval ===
In the mid 2000s, the station was upgraded as part of the extension to Laval. A diversion from the main tunnel and a third platform have been added. This allows a number of trains to end their run at Henri-Bourassa (using the existing platform, where passengers board on the same platform before the train goes backwards using the crossover switch located in the tunnel connecting Henri-Bourassa to Sauvé), while others continue to Laval (using the new platform). Trains coming from Laval always arrive on the first platform. The extension opened to the public on April 28, 2007.

== Artwork ==
The station includes several artworks. A collective work by 330 Montreal children, titled &quot;Les enfants dans la ville&quot; (&quot;children in the city&quot;), is found in the mezzanine; composed of moulded concrete blocks, it depicts scenes of parks, houses, play, and transportation. In the Henri Bourassa Blvd. North entrance, a mural relief by Jacques Huet titled &quot;Réveil de la conscience par la solitude&quot; (&quot;awakening of consciousness by solitude&quot;) forms a firewall between the entrance and the adjacent government office. In the new Berri St. entrance, the architect André Léonard created two terra cotta reliefs titled &quot;Le potager&quot; (&quot;the vegetable garden&quot;) and &quot;Le vent&quot; (&quot;the wind&quot;). The addition of the Laval platform saw the addition of a new artwork, a light sculpture by Axel Morgenthaler titled &quot;.98&quot;.

==Origin of the name==

This station is named for Henri Bourassa Blvd. which in turn is named for Henri Bourassa (1868–1952), a journalist and politician, who served in municipal, provincial, and federal governments, but is best known for founding the newspaper &quot;Le Devoir&quot; in 1910.

<text>Jarry station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line. The station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro.

== Overview ==
The station, designed by Lemoyne, Bland, Edwards, &amp; Shine, is a normal side platform station, built in tunnel.

<text>Mont-Royal () is a station on the Orange Line of the Montreal Metro rapid transit system, operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM). It is located in the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro.

== Overview ==
The station, designed by Victor Prus, is a normal side platform station, built in tunnel. It has a single mezzanine at transept level, giving access to one entrance.

== Artwork ==
The station has several pieces of artwork. &quot;Vertical bands&quot; by noted Quebec artist Charles Daudelin consists of 32 narrow vertical aluminum seams at platform level, with extruded square and rectangular forms in high relief. These were some of the first artworks installed in the Metro, present at the opening of the station in 1966. In 2000, the redevelopment of the place Gérald-Godin surrounding the station included the addition of a work of art, a poem by Gérald Godin bricked into the façade of a building, by the art collective Les Industries perdues. In 2022, &quot;Je reviens chez nous&quot; by artist Simon Bilodeau was installed in the newly rebuilt east entrance. This concrete work represents the limestone strata of the Plateau-Mont-Royal and the various streets &amp; avenues.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for Mount Royal Avenue (av. Mont-Royal), so called because it leads to the foot of Mount Royal.

== Accessibility ==
In October 2018, work began to install two elevators, add two staircases connecting the platforms to the street and build a second walkway above the tracks linking the two platforms. The work also involved construction of a replacement entrance building, with a glass façade and new artwork. A walkway provides access between the two elevators, and the fare booth and ticket machines have been relocated to the street level. 

In July 2022, the station became the 20th accessible station on the Metro. Escalators at the station reopened in fall 2022, completing the project.

<text>Sherbrooke station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Le Plateau-Mont-Royal in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line. This station, near downtown, opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro.

== Overview ==

The station, designed by Jean Dumontier and Crevier, Lemieux, Mercier et Caron, is a normal side-platform station, built in open cut due to the difficulty of construction under Berri Street near the Sherbrooke Street overpass. It has a single mezzanine giving access to two entrances, one on either side of Berri Street, both integrated into buildings. There is an access tunnel that connects the integrated exit to the metro station as well as an exit to Sherbrooke street, the only one in the station. The walls are decorated in straw-yellow brick, purple ceiling louvres and bulkhead walls, and orange highlights.
== Architecture and art ==

The station&#x27;s main artwork is a mosaic, the only one in the Metro, on the Côte-Vertu platform. Designed by Gabriel Bastien and Andrea Vau, it depicts the achievements of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society, whose headquarters are nearby. There are also two mural works by Mario Merola in the accesses.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for Sherbrooke Street. Sir John Coape Sherbrooke (1764–1830) served as governor general of British North America 1816–1818. The street was named for him in 1817.

<doc id="1314459" wikidata="Q1061011" url="?curid=1314459" title="Champ-de-Mars station (Montreal Metro)">
<text>Champ-de-Mars station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line. It is located in Old Montreal by the Champ de Mars park. It opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original Metro network.

== Overview ==
Designed by Adalbert Niklewicz, it is a normal side platform station, built in open cut due to the presence of weak Utica shale in the surrounding rock. Its entrance is located near a series of tunnels that cross the Autoroute Ville-Marie, giving access to Old Montreal.

==Station improvements==
In December 2014, the station became fully accessible with the installation of three elevators. The $12m project also involved the renovation of the main entrance building (including installation of a new green roof) and underground city access to Centre hospitalier de l&#x27;Université de Montréal (CHUM).

== Architecture and art ==

One of the most important artworks in the Metro, a set of stained glass windows by noted Quebec artist Marcelle Ferron, illuminates the mezzanine of this station. These windows, one of the artist&#x27;s masterpieces and her most famous work, were given by the Government of Quebec in 1968. They were the first work of non-figurative art to be commissioned for the Metro, representing the first official entrance of Automatist art in the system.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for Champ-de-Mars, a public park facing Montreal City Hall. The name is the French term for a military parade ground. It was formerly crossed by the city&#x27;s fortifications, demolished in the 19th century, the foundations of which can still be seen. It was later turned into a parking lot, which was replaced by a park in 1980s.

<doc id="1314464" wikidata="Q1495111" url="?curid=1314464" title="Place-d'Armes station">
<text>Place-d&#x27;Armes station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line. It is located in Old Montreal.

The station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro. It was briefly the terminus of the Orange Line until Square-Victoria-OACI station opened four months later, quickly followed by Bonaventure station, the planned terminus.

==Overview==
The station, designed by Janusz Warunkiewicz, is a normal side platform station, built in open cut due to the presence of weak Utica shale in the surrounding rock. Its mezzanine, with fare barriers at either side, is located directly under the Palais des congrès de Montréal; one end gives direct access to the Palais, while the other opens outside, near Chinatown.

==Station improvements==
In March 2017, the station was made accessible with the installation of elevators. The station is equipped with the MétroVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the time until the next train arrives.

==Origin of the name==

This station is named for the Place d&#x27;Armes, a short distance to the south. It is the third square in Montreal to have this name, which is the common French name for the rallying place for a fort&#x27;s defenders. It contains a statue of Paul Chomedey, sieur de Maisonneuve.

==Connecting bus routes==


==Station closure==
Place d’Armes station was closed from December 1 to December 21, 2022, due to the COP15 conference; the authorities requested a complete closure of the station. The 55, 129, 361, 363 and 365 bus lines were rerouted to not stop at the station.

<text>Square-Victoria–OACI station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line. It is located in Victoria Square near the Quartier international de Montréal district. The station opened on February 6, 1967, four months after most of the initial network, and was briefly the terminus of the Orange Line until Bonaventure station was opened a week later.

== Overview ==
The station is a normal side platform station; its central mezzanine is connected to a very long tunnel running along Beaver Hall Hill and under Victoria Square, giving access to its various exits.

Each of the station&#x27;s exits is connected to another building or buildings via the underground city. The Belmont exit is connected to and located in the 1080 Beaver Hall Hill building; the Viger exit is likewise connected to and located in the Bell Tower/National Bank complex. The Saint Antoine exit is a link in the main part of the underground city, linking the ICAO building with the Centre CDP Capital, while the rotunda at the south end of the tunnel, leading to the Saint Jacques exit, links the Tour de la Bourse with the Centre de commerce mondial.

The station was designed by Irving Sager. Two steel murals by Robert Savoie, entitled &quot;Kawari Kabuto&quot;, grace the walls of the great volume over the tunnel vaults, and a mural in the pedestrian tunnel to the northern entrances is by Jean-Paul Mousseau. The southern rotunda formerly contained a multimedia installation entitled &quot;Ars Natura&quot;, promoting Montreal&#x27;s science museums.

The most famous artwork, however, is one of Hector Guimard&#x27;s Art Nouveau entrance porticos from the Paris Métro. One of the few authentic installations on a rapid transit station outside Paris, it was given in 1967 by the RATP (Régie autonome des transports parisiens) to commemorate the collaboration of French and Canadian engineers in building the Metro. It is located within Victoria Square on the Saint Antoine entrance, one of only four open-air entrances on the network (the others are located at Place-Saint-Henri and Bonaventure stations). In 2003, the entrance was removed, completely restored, and reinstalled.

The station is equipped with the MétroVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the time till the next train.

The station has 4 entrances:
: 605, Belmont Street (Montreal)
: 601, Viger Avenue
: 601 Saint Antoine Street W
: 605, Saint Jacques Street W

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for Victoria Square, which has existed since 1813; it was renamed for Queen Victoria on the occasion of the visit of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) to Montreal in 1860.

Until the spring of 2014, the station was named Square-Victoria. In June 2014, the station was renamed Square-Victoria–OACI, referring to the nearby headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization (). This was done to celebrate the 70th anniversary of ICAO&#x27;s presence in Montreal.

<text>Manuel Maria Barbosa l&#x27;Hedois du Bocage (15 September 1765 – 21 December 1805), most often referred to simply as Bocage, was a Portuguese Neoclassic poet, writing at the beginning of his career under the pen name &quot;Elmano Sadino&quot;.

==Biography==

Bocage was born in the Portuguese city of Setúbal, in 1765, to José Luís Soares de Barbosa and Mariana Joaquina Xavier l&#x27;Hedois Lustoff du Bocage, of French family.

Bocage began to make verses in infancy, and being somewhat of a prodigy grew up to be flattered, self-conscious and unstable. At the age of fourteen, he suddenly left school and joined the 7th Infantry Regiment; but tiring of garrison life at Setúbal after two years, he decided to enter the Portuguese navy. He proceeded to the Royal Marine Academy in Lisbon but instead of studying he pursued romantic adventures. For the next five years he had numerous love affairs, and his retentive memory and extraordinary talent for improvisation gained him a host of admirers and turned his head.

Brazilian modinhas, short rhyming poems sung accompanied by a guitar at family parties, were very popular at the time, and Bocage added to his fame by writing a number of these, by his skill in extemporizing verses on a given theme, and by allegorical idyllic pieces, the subjects of which are similar to those of Watteau&#x27;s and Boucher&#x27;s pictures. In 1786 he was appointed &quot;guarda-marinha&quot; in the Portuguese India navy, and he reached Goa by way of the colony of Brazil in October. There he came into an ignorant society full of petty intrigue, where his particular talents found no scope to display themselves; the glamour of the East left him unmoved and the climate brought on a serious illness. In these circumstances he compared the heroic traditions of Portugal in Asia, which had induced him to leave home, with the reality, and wrote his satirical sonnets on &quot;The Decadence of the Portuguese Empire in Asia&quot;, and those addressed to Afonso de Albuquerque and D. João de Castro. The irritation caused by these satires, together with rivalries in love affairs, made it advisable for him to leave Goa, and early in 1789 he obtained the post of lieutenant of the infantry company at Damão, India; but he promptly deserted and made his way to Macau, where he arrived in July–August. According to a contemporary tradition, much of &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; had been written there, and Bocage probably travelled to China following in the footsteps of another classic Portuguese poet, Luís de Camões, to whose life and misfortunes he loved to compare his own. Though he escaped the penalty of his desertion, he had no resources and lived on the charity of friends, whose help enabled him to return to Lisbon in the middle of the following year.
Once back in Portugal he regained his old popularity, and resumed his vagabond existence. The age was one of reaction against the Marquis of Pombal&#x27;s reforms, and his superintendent of police, Pina Manique, in his determination to keep out French revolutionary and atheistic propaganda, forbade the importation of foreign classics and the discussion of all liberal ideas. Hence the only vehicle of expression left was satire, which Bocage employed with an unsparing hand. His poverty compelled him to live with friends like the turbulent friar José Agostinho de Macedo, and he soon fell under suspicion from Manique. He became a member of the New Arcadia, a literary society founded in 1790, under the name of Elmano Sadino, but left it three years later. Though including in its ranks most of the poets of the time, the New Arcadia produced little of real merit, and before long its adherents became mutual enemies and descended to an angry war of words. But Bocage&#x27;s reputation among the general public and with foreign travellers grew year by year. William Beckford, the author of &quot;Vathek&quot;, for instance, describes him as a &quot;pale, limber, odd-looking young man, the queerest but perhaps the most original of God&#x27;s poetical creatures. This strange and versatile character may be said to possess the true wand of enchantment which at the will of its master either animates or petrifies.&quot;

In 1797 enemies of Bocage belonging to New Arcadia denounced him to Manique, who on the pretext afforded by some anti-religious verses, the &quot;Epistola a Marilia&quot;, along with accusations of immorality, arrested him when he was about to flee the country and flung him in the Limoeiro jail, where he spent his thirty-second birthday. His sufferings induced him to a speedy recantation, and after much importuning of friends, he obtained his transfer in November from the state prison to that of the Portuguese Inquisition, by then a lenient institution, and shortly afterwards recovered his liberty. He returned to his bohemian life and subsisted by writing empty &quot;Elogios Dramáticos&quot; for the theatres, printing volumes of verses and translating the didactic poems of Delille, Castel and others, along with some second-rate French plays. These resources and the help of brother Freemasons enabled him to survive, and a purifying influence came into his life in the shape of a real affection for the two beautiful daughters of D. António Bersane Leite, which drew from him verses of true feeling mixed with regrets for the past. He would have married the younger lady, D. Anna Perpétua (Analia), but his earlier excesses had ruined his health.

In 1801 his poetical rivalry with Macedo became more acute and personal, and ended by drawing from Bocage a stinging extempore poem, &quot;Pena de Talião&quot;, which remains a monument to his powers of invective. In 1804 the illness (syphilis) from which he suffered worsened, and the approach of death inspired some beautiful sonnets, including one directed to D. Maria, elder sister of Analia, who visited and consoled him. He became reconciled to his enemies, and died on 21 December 1805 of an aneurysm. He died in poverty on the eve of the French invasion, in a similar way to how Camões&#x27; death came just before the occupation of Portugal by the Duke of Alva&#x27;s army. The gulf that divides the life and achievements of these two poets is accounted for less by difference of talent and temperament than by their environment, and illustrates the decline of Portugal in the two centuries that separate 1580 from 1805.

To Beckford, Bocage was a powerful genius, and Link was struck by his nervous expression, harmonious versification and the fire of his poetry. He employed every variety of lyric and made his mark in all of them. His roundels are good, his epigrams witty, his satires rigorous and searching, his odes often full of nobility, but his fame must rest on his sonnets, which almost rival those of Camões in power, elevation of thought and tender melancholy, though they lack the latter&#x27;s scholarly refinement of phrasing. So dazzled were contemporary critics by his brilliant and inspired extemporizations that they ignored Bocage&#x27;s licentiousness, and overlooked both the superficiality of his creative output and the artificial character of most of his poetry. In 1871 a monument was erected to the poet in the main square in Setúbal, and the centenary of his death was observed there with great ceremony in 1905.

Perhaps because of the sheer rudeness of some of his verse Bocage is still a genuinely popular figure today, and not only in Setúbal. The subversiveness of his poems has meant that for much of the last 200 years they have not been (officially) available in Portugal: his erotic poetry was first published anonymously towards the end of the 19th century.

Free translation of a poem where Bocage draws his self-portrait.

Free translation in English:

:Thin, blue eyes, tanned face,
:His fair share of feet, middling height,
:Sad of face, the same of figure,
:High nose in the middle, and not small;

:Incapable of staying in just one place,
:More prone to furor than to tenderness;
:Drinking in his pale hands, out of a dark cup,
:From hellish zeal lethal poison;

:Devote incense burner to a thousand deities
:(I mean, a thousand girls) in a single moment,
:Loving the friars only at the altar,

:This is Bocage, in whom some talent shines;
:From himself these truths have come,
:On a day that he felt more dull.
Original in Portuguese:

: &quot;Magro, de olhos azuis, carão moreno, &quot;
: &quot;Bem servido de pés, meão na altura, &quot;
: &quot;Triste de facha, o mesmo de figura, &quot;
: &quot;Nariz alto no meio, e não pequeno; &quot;

: &quot;Incapaz de assistir num só terreno, &quot;
: &quot;Mais propenso ao furor do que à ternura; &quot;
: &quot;Bebendo em níveas mãos, por taça escura, &quot;
: &quot;De zelos infernais letal veneno; &quot;

: &quot;Devoto incensador de mil deidades &quot;
: &quot;(Digo, de moças mil) num só memento, &quot;
: &quot;E somente no altar amando os frades, &quot;

: &quot;Eis Bocage, em quem luz algum talento; &quot;
: &quot;Saíram dele mesmo estas verdades, &quot;
: &quot;Num dia em que se achou mais pachorrento.&quot;

<text>Matter organizes into various phases or states of matter depending on its constituents and external factors like pressure and temperature. Except at extreme temperatures and pressures, atoms form the three classical states of matter: solid, liquid and gas. Complex molecules can also form various mesophases such as liquid crystals, which are intermediate between the liquid and solid phases. At high temperatures or strong electromagnetic fields, atoms become ionized, forming plasma.

At low temperatures, the electrons of solid materials can also organize into various electronic phases of matter, such as the superconducting state, with vanishing resistivity. Magnetic states such as ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism can also be regarded as phases of matter in which the electronic and nuclear spins organize into different patterns. Such states of matter are studied in condensed matter physics.

In extreme conditions found in some stars and in the early universe, atoms break into their constituents and matter exists as some form of degenerate matter or quark matter. Such states of matter are studied in high-energy physics.

In the 20th century, increased understanding of the properties of matter resulted in the identification of many states of matter. This list includes some notable examples.

==Low-energy states of matter==

=== Classical states ===
* Solid: A solid holds a definite shape and volume without the need of a container. The particles are held very close to each other. 
**Amorphous solid: A solid in which there is no far-range order of the positions of the atoms.
** Crystalline solid: A solid in which atoms, molecules, or ions are packed in regular order.
** Quasicrystal: A solid in which the positions of the atoms have long-range order, but this is not in a repeating pattern.
** Semicrystalline: A solid state in complex organic chemistry where molecules are packed in a regular order but have substantial local disorder.
** Different structural phases of polymorphic materials are considered to be different states of matter in the Landau theory. For an example, see .
* Liquid: A mostly non-compressible fluid. Able to conform to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure.
* Gas: A compressible fluid. Not only will a gas take the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container.
* Mesomorphic states: States of matter intermediate between solid and liquid.
** Plastic crystal: A molecular solid with long-range positional order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom.
**Liquid crystal: Properties intermediate between liquids and crystals. Generally, able to flow like a liquid but exhibiting long-range orientational order.
* Supercritical fluid: A fluid with properties intermediate of liquids and gasses. At sufficiently high temperatures and pressures, the distinction between liquid and gas disappears, resulting in supercritical fluids.
* Plasma: Unlike gases, which are composed of neutral atoms, plasma contains a significant number of free electrons and ionized atoms. It may self-generate magnetic fields and electric currents and responds strongly and collectively to electromagnetic forces.

=== Condensates, superfluids and superconductors ===
* Bose–Einstein condensate: A phase in which a large number of bosons all inhabit the same quantum state, in effect becoming one single wave/particle. This is a low-energy phase that can only be formed in laboratory conditions and at very low temperatures. It must be close to absolute zero. Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein predicted the existence of such a state in the 1920s, but it was not observed until 1995 by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman.
* Fermionic condensate: Similar to the Bose-Einstein condensate but composed of fermions, also known as Fermi-Dirac condensate. The Pauli exclusion principle prevents fermions from entering the same quantum state, but a pair of fermions can be bound to each other and behave like a boson, and two or more such pairs can occupy quantum states of a given total momentum without restriction.
* Superconductor: Material produced from a phenomenon of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields occurring in certain substances when cooled below a characteristic critical temperature. Superconductivity is the ground state of many elemental metals. Superconductors come in multiple varieties:
** Conventional superconductor: A superconductor described by the BCS theory with a singlet order parameter.
** Unconventional superconductor: A superconductor which breaks additional symmetries. For example, &quot;d&quot;-wave or triplet superconductor, or a Fulde–Ferrell–Larkin–Ovchinnikov superconductor.
** Ferromagnetic superconductor: Materials that display intrinsic coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity.
** Charge-4e superconductor: A proposed state in which electrons are not bound as Cooper pairs but as quadruplets of electrons.
* Superfluid: A phase achieved by a few cryogenic liquids at extreme temperature at which they become able to flow without friction. A superfluid can flow up the side of an open container and down the outside. Placing a superfluid in a spinning container will result in quantized vortices.
* Supersolid: similar to a superfluid, a supersolid can move without friction but retains a rigid shape.

=== Magnetic states ===
* Ferromagnetism: A state of matter with spontaneous magnetization.
* Antiferromagnetism: A state of matter in which the neighboring spin are antiparallel with each other, and there is no net magnetization. 
* Ferrimagnetism: A state in which local moments partially cancel.
* Altermagnetism: A state with zero net magnetization and spin-split electronic bands.
* Spin-density wave: An ordered state in which spin density is periodically modulated.
* Helimagnetism: A state with spatially rotating magnetic order.
* Spin glass: A magnetic state characterized by randomness.
* Quantum spin liquid: A disordered state in a system of interacting quantum spins which preserves its disorder to very low temperatures, unlike other disordered states. 

=== Electronically ordered states ===
* Ferroelectricity: A state of matter with spontaneous electric polarization.
* Antiferroelectricity: A state of matter in which the adjacent electric dipoles point in opposite directions.
* Charge ordering: Charge ordering (CO) is a (first- or second-order) phase transition occurring mostly in strongly correlated materials such as transition metal oxides or organic conductors. Due to the strong interaction between electrons, charges are localized on different sites leading to a disproportionation and an ordered superlattice. It appears in different patterns ranging from vertical to horizontal stripes to a checkerboard–like pattern [1][2] , and it is not limited to the two-dimensional case. The charge order transition is accompanied by symmetry breaking and may lead to ferroelectricity. It is often found in close proximity to superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance.
* Charge density wave: An ordered state in which charge density is periodically modulated.

=== Topological states of matter ===
*Quantum Hall state: A topological state of matter with quantized Hall resistance.
**Fractional quantum Hall state: A state with fractionally charged quasiparticles. Hall resistance is quantized to fractional multiples of resistance quantum.
**Quantum spin Hall state: a theoretical phase that may pave the way for the development of electronic devices that dissipate less energy and generate less heat. This is a derivative of the quantum Hall state of matter.
**Quantum anomalous Hall state: A state which has a quantized Hall resistance even in the absence of external magnetic field. 
* Topological insulator: a material whose interior behaves as an electrical insulator while its surface behaves as an electrical conductor.
* Fractional Chern insulator: A generalization of fractional quantum Hall state to electrons on a lattice.
* Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless state: A 2D state with unbound vortex-antivortex pairs.
* String-net liquid: Atoms in this state have unstable arrangements, like a liquid, but are still consistent in the overall pattern, like a solid.
* Topological semimetals:
** Weyl semimetal
** Dirac semimetal
* Topological superconductor

=== Classification by conductivity ===

Metallic and insulating states of materials can be considered as different quantum phases of matter connected by a metal-insulator transition. Materials can be classified by the structure of their Fermi surface and zero-temperature dc conductivity as follows:
* Metal:
** Fermi liquid: a metal with well-defined quasiparticle states at the Fermi surface.
** Non-Fermi liquid: Various metallic states with unconventional properties. 
* Insulator
** Band insulator: A material that is insulating due to a band gap in its electronic spectrum
** Mott insulator: A material that is insulating due to interactions between electrons. 
** Anderson insulator: A material that is insulating due to disorder-induced interference effects.
** Charge-transfer insulators

=== Miscellaneous states ===
* Time crystals: A state of matter where an object can have movement even at its lowest energy state.
* Hidden states of matter: Phases that are unattainable or do not exist in thermal equilibrium, but can be induced e.g. by photoexcitation.
* Microphase separation: Constituent units forming diverse phases while also keeping united.
* Chain-melted state: Metals, such as potassium, at high temperature and pressure, present properties of both a solid and liquid.
* Wigner crystal: a crystalline phase of low-density electrons.
* Hexatic state, a state of matter that is between the solid and the isotropic liquid phases in two dimensional systems of particles.
*Ferroics
:*Ferroelastic state, a phenomenon in which a material may exhibit a spontaneous strain.
* Photon molecule: Photons which are connected with each other, attracted by apparent mass while mediating energy transfer.

==High energy states==
* Degenerate matter: Matter under very high pressure, supported by the Pauli exclusion principle.
** Electron-degenerate matter: Found inside white dwarf stars. Electrons remain bound to atoms but can transfer to adjacent atoms.
** Neutron-degenerate matter: Found in neutron stars. Vast gravitational pressure compresses atoms so strongly that the electrons are forced to combine with protons via inverse beta decay, resulting in a super dense conglomeration of neutrons. (Normally free neutrons outside an atomic nucleus will decay with a half-life of just under fifteen minutes, but in a neutron star, as in the nucleus of an atom, other effects stabilize the neutrons.)
** Strange matter: A type of quark matter that may exist inside some neutron stars close to the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (approximately 2–3 solar masses). May be stable at lower energy states once formed.
* Quark matter: Hypothetical phases of matter whose degrees of freedom include quarks and gluons
** Color-glass condensate
** Color superconductivity
** Quark–gluon plasma: A phase in which quarks become free and able to move independently (rather than being perpetually bound into particles, or bound to each other in a quantum lock where exerting force adds energy and eventually solidifies into another quark) in an ocean of gluons (subatomic particles that transmit the strong force that binds quarks together). May be briefly attainable in particle accelerators, or possibly inside neutron stars.
* For up to 10−35 seconds after the Big Bang, the energy density of the universe was so high that the four forces of nature – strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational – are thought to have been unified into one single force. The state of matter at this time is unknown. As the universe expanded, the temperature and density dropped and the gravitational force separated, a process called symmetry breaking.

<text>Bonaventure station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line. It opened on February 13, 1967, four months after most of the initial network. It served as the western terminus of the Orange Line for 14 years until the extension to Place-Saint-Henri station opened in 1980.

== Overview ==

Designed by Victor Prus, the station is a normal side platform station, built by cut-and-cover in order to provide a large space for the heavily trafficked mezzanine. As a key part of the underground city, the mezzanine has ticket barriers on either side to allow pedestrians to pass from one end of the station to the other side. Footbridges over the tracks below the mezzanine level allow passengers to cross from one platform to the other.

Until 1992, the station had only one outdoor entrance, in front of Windsor Station, and two additional accesses led directly to Place Bonaventure and Montreal Central Station (Gare Centrale) on one end and to the Château Champlain and Place du Canada on the other. When 1000 de La Gauchetière was built almost directly above the station, additional accesses were added to the office tower and to the Downtown Terminus (metropolitan bus terminal for Réseau de transport de Longueuil and South Shore buses) within it, as well as a street entrance on the western side of the building on Cathédrale Street and improved access to Central Station and Place Bonaventure.

The station is intermodal with the Réseau de transport métropolitain (RTM)&#x27;s commuter train lines through its underground access to Montreal Central Station, the terminus for Mascouche and Mont-Saint-Hilaire lines. Eventually, it connected to the Réseau express métropolitain network as well. There is also underground access to the Lucien-L&#x27;Allier train station and to the Lucien-L&#x27;Allier Metro station.

Elevators were added between the mezzanine and the platforms in November 2009, which mader the station more accessible to people with reduced mobility. However, no step-free access to the surface was possible until 2019, when elevators were added connecting the mezzanine level to Terminus Centre-Ville and to the lobby of 1000 De La Gauchetière. This was criticised in the media. The elevators do not allow passengers to change platforms unless they exit the ticket barriers. Another elevator connecting the station to Place du Canada and the Château Champlain was once the only elevator in the system; it is separated from the mezzanine level by steps.

The station is equipped with the MétroVision information screens, which display news, commercials, and the time until the next train.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named after Place Bonaventure, a major commercial complex containing businesses, the Hôtel Bonaventure (formerly a Hilton Hotel), and the Société de transport de Montréal&#x27;s headquarters. This was named after Bonaventure Station, a former station on the Grand Trunk Railway, which in turn was named for its location on Saint Bonaventure Street, now Saint Jacques Street. All derive their name from St. Bonaventure, a 13th-century Italian philosopher and mystic.

<text>Lucien-L&#x27;Allier station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line.

==Overview==

The station, planned under the name &quot;Aqueduc&quot;, was designed by the firm of David, Boulva &amp; Cleve. A sculptural grille by Jean-Jacques Besner covering a ventilation shaft is the only artwork. The station is a normal side platform station, with a mezzanine on its eastern end, which is connected to the exit by an extremely deep open shaft. Passengers have to descend the greatest distance to reach the platforms of any station in Montreal (only Charlevoix and Berri-UQAM have deeper platforms, but those stations also have additional platforms that are shallower).

The station is intermodal with the Exo commuter rail lines; the entrance is connected by an enclosed walkway to Lucien-L&#x27;Allier station, a station that serves as the Downtown terminus for the Vaudreuil-Hudson, Saint-Jérôme, and Candiac lines. That train station was built as part of the Bell Centre and replaced the former Gare Windsor. It was initially called Terminus Windsor but was renamed for the Metro station to reduce confusion with the still-extant former station. It is also connected to Montreal&#x27;s underground city.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for Lucien L&#x27;Allier Street, whose name was changed from &quot;rue de l&#x27;Aqueduc&quot; in order to commemorate Lucien L&#x27;Allier, chief engineer for the initial network of the Metro, as well as for the construction of Saint Helen&#x27;s Island and Notre Dame Island for Expo 67. He had died while the station was under construction. A plaque in the station commemorates him.

<doc id="1314479" wikidata="Q1508769" url="?curid=1314479" title="Georges-Vanier station">
<text>Georges-Vanier station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Le Sud-Ouest in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line. It is located in the Little Burgundy area.

== Overview ==

The station, designed by architect Pierre-W. Major, is a normal side platform station, and has one access. The huge underground volume of the station mezzanine is lighted by a single, round skylight, and is decorated with a sculpture, &quot;Un arbre dans le parc&quot;, by Michel Dernuet, is situated on the Côte-Vertu platform; it is a large concrete pillar with illuminated branches, representing a tree. The wall facing the easternmost stairs for the Montmorency platform is faced with blue ceramic symbolizing a fresh spring in the woods.

In most years, this station is the least used in the network since it is the only one with no connecting bus route; it was 68th of 68 in traffic in 2011, with 773,078 passengers embarking here.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for the boul. Georges-Vanier, named for the Rt. Hon. Georges-Philias Vanier. Born a few steps from the street that now bears his name, Major-General Vanier was a distinguished soldier in World War I and Canada&#x27;s ambassador to all Allied governments in World War II. He served as the 19th Governor General of Canada, the first French-Canadian to occupy that position, from 1959 until his death.

<doc id="1314481" wikidata="Q1632321" url="?curid=1314481" title="Place-Saint-Henri station">
<text>Place-Saint-Henri station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Le Sud-Ouest in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line. It is located in the Saint-Henri neighbourhood.

The station opened on April 28, 1980, as the western terminus of the first extension of the Orange Line, replacing Bonaventure station as the terminus until the extension to Snowdon station opened in 1981.

== Overview ==
The station was designed by Julien Hébert and Jean-Louis Lalonde. The station is a normal side platform station that is connected by long stairwells to a large mezzanine. The station has three accesses; one is a conventional access within a bus loop, and the other two are glass walled entrances linking to staircases and elevators linked to an underground gallery connected to the mezzanine.

==Station improvements==
In November 2020, work began at the station to make it universally accessible. As part of this project, the Saint-Jacques North and South exits were closed, new entrance buildings with elevators were built, and a new piece of artwork was commissioned. Place Saint-Henri was also refurbished. During construction, the main entrance on Saint-Ferdinand remained open. The two entrances and elevators were completed in December of 2024.

== Artwork ==
The station originally contained two artworks: a mural by Hébert in the mezzanine, entitled &quot;Bonheur d&#x27;occasion&quot;, featuring the title of the famous book by Gabrielle Roy (in English called &quot;The Tin Flute&quot;), set in the neighbourhood; and a motorized mobile sculpture by Jacques de Tonnancour suspended in the mezzanine and over the platforms.

In 2001, a statue of Jacques Cartier by Joseph-Arthur Vincent (originally created in 1896), was moved to the station and placed in a light shaft over the Côte-Vertu bound platform. It had formerly crowned a fountain in a nearby park, but was removed, moved to the station, and replaced with a copy after it crumbled due to exposure.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for place Saint-Henri, a short street and public square between rue Saint-Jacques and rue Notre-Dame. The place and the district took their name from a chapel built in 1810 and placed under the protection of Saint Henry, possibly to commemorate Henri-Auguste Roux (1798–1831), superior of Saint-Sulpice Seminary.

<doc id="1314483" wikidata="Q1593502" url="?curid=1314483" title="Vendôme station">
<text>Vendôme station () is an intermodal transit station in the borough of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, near the town of Westmount in the Westmount Adjacent area of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce that adjoins the Décarie Expressway. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line of the Montreal Metro.

The Metro station connects to Exo&#x27;s commuter rail network by a pedestrian tunnel, permitting access to platforms providing service on the Vaudreuil-Hudson, Saint-Jérôme and Candiac lines.

== Overview ==
Originally, two stations were supposed to be built between Place-Saint-Henri and Villa-Maria: Northcliffe and Westmount. However, opposition from Westmount residents as well as instability in the underlying rock formation forced their consolidation into one station, with the result that the tunnel between Vendôme and Place-Saint-Henri is the longest on the Island of Montreal.

The station is a normal side platform station with an entrance near the midpoint of the platforms. The main entrance is located on De Maisonneuve Boulevard and another entrance is located in the bus loop. The structure sits directly above the platforms and includes and surrounds the sunken mezzanine. It is the network&#x27;s deepest station without escalators or moving sidewalks.

The station was designed by the firm of Desnoyers, Mercure, Leziy, Gagnon, Sheppard et Gélinas. It contains a plaque commemorating Jean Descaris, a 17th-century pioneer, and his descendant Alphonse Décarie, on whose land Vendôme and Villa-Maria Metro stations were built. The adjacent train station is in Fare Zone 1.

== Accessibility and MUHC Hospital connection ==
A short tunnel under the railway tracks links this Metro station to the McGill University Health Centre, which opened in 2015. Initially, the tunnel provided access only to a secondary entrance building on the hospital campus, with a door between the tunnel and the underground parking garage kept locked; however, the access to the underground parking was later opened to the public and pedestrian paths through the garage provided, offering indoor access from the metro to the hospital. Although the secondary entrance building has an elevator, the new tunnel was not wheelchair accessible, with only stair access to the metro and commuter trains. This lack of provision was criticised by advocates.

In fall 2017, construction began on another entrance to the station, located east of the bus loop. This was designed to offer a wheelchair-accessible direct connection between the metro station, the commuter train platforms, and the hospital via a pedestrian tunnel. The choice to construct a second access was made because retrofitting the existing access was deemed prohibitively expensive. The new entrance pavilion also includes new public art. The new entrance was opened on May 31, 2021, making the station fully accessible. 

== Artwork ==
The station features two artworks. The first artwork is by Quebec artist Marcelle Ferron, and consists of a stained-glass window and a stainless steel sculpture over the tracks. It was installed when the station first opened. The second artwork was installed as part of the work to make the station accessible in the mid 2010s. It comprises a set of three ceramic mosaics, by artist Patrick Bernatchez. It is located in the east entrance of the station.

==Origin of the name==

This station is named for avenue de Vendôme, in turn possibly named for the French Dukes of Vendôme.

==Exo station==
Vendôme station is a commuter rail station operated by Exo in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is located in the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce area of the Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough, and is served by the Vaudreuil-Hudson, Saint-Jérôme and Candiac Lines. The station is connected by a pedestrian tunnel to the Montreal Metro&#x27;s Vendôme station.

The station originally had two tracks (and two side platforms), but in 2015, a third track running between Montreal West and Downtown Montreal&#x27;s Lucien-L&#x27;Allier station was added for improved service, and platform 2 was rebuilt as a wider island platform so trains running on the new track could call at the station as well.

The station is in the ARTM&#x27;s Fare Zone A. Prior to the reform of the ARTM&#x27;s fare system in July 2022, it was in zone 1.

<text>Villa-Maria is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line. It is located in the Westmount Adjacent area of the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce neighbourhood, beside the Décarie Expressway trench.

== Overview ==
The station is a normal side platform station and has an entrance at its south end. The entrance is located in a bus loop located on the Décarie Autoroute.

==Station improvements==
In 2019, work began to make the station fully accessible at a cost of $24.6m. The work included the installation of three elevators, station renovation works and the installation of new artwork. The project was completed in November 2022, making Villa-Maria the 23rd accessible station in the Metro.

==Architecture and artwork==
The station was designed by André Léonard. The architect also designed mural sculptures for the station of large moulded dials in a variety of colours. Floor and wall tiling also make use of colours throughout the station.

As part of work to make the station accessible, &quot;La correspondance des strates&quot;, by the artist Marianne Chevalier, was unveiled in September 2022. Using colorful geometric &amp; organic shapes cut of aluminium, the work contrasts with the 1980s sculptures designed by station architect André Léonard.

==Origin of name==
Villa-Maria station takes its name from the nearby Villa Maria school, which in turn takes its name from the Latin House of Mary.

The surrounding lands were once owned by the Decarie family. The land was sold in 1795 to Sir James Monk. The Monk residence was built in 1804 in the central section of the present-day school. In 1844, the building was leased to the Crown as a residence for the Governor General of Canada. (Lord Metcalfe, Earl Cathcart, and Lord Elgin resided on the Monklands.

The property became a country hotel for five years. In 1854, it was purchased by the nuns of Congregation of Notre Dame, who turned it into a private girls&#x27; school, which they named Villa Maria. The metro station was built at the foot of the Villa Maria property.

<text>Namur station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line. It is located in the Côte-des-Neiges area. This station has a total of 428 parking spaces in two nearby parking lots.

==Overview==

The station is a normal side platform station with an entrance at the north end. It was planned in such a way as to allow an additional entrance to be built on the other side of the Décarie Autoroute, but this has not yet happened.

A redevelopment plan for the area is under discussion.

The station was designed by the firm of Labelle, Marchand et Geoffroy. The station&#x27;s mezzanine contains a giant suspended illuminated aluminum sculpture, entitled &quot;Système&quot;, by noted Quebec artist Pierre Granche.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for Rue Namur, the former name for a portion of Rue Jean-Talon; the road had been renamed by the time the station was opened, so a nearby road (Rue Arnoldi) was renamed Namur in 1980 to allow the station to keep its name. Namur is a city and province in Belgium, which also lent its name to the town of Namur, Quebec.

The station was designed by Guy de Varennes and Almas Mathieu. Its artworks include mural treatments in the entrance, mezzanine, and platforms by the architects, as well as a large metal sculpture by Maurice Lemieux, entitled &quot;Calcite&quot;, affixed to the wall of the mezzanine and illuminated by a light shaft.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for the nearby rue de la Savane, a connector street between the Decarie expressway and Jean Talon Street.

==Connecting bus routes==

With the reopening of Côte-Vertu station on August 23, 2021, the 64, 470 and 968 went back to the regular route at Côte-Vertu station. On the same day, the 76 McArthur is discontinued and the 100 Crémazie and the 460 Express Métropolitaine serve Du Collège station on the westbound and De la Savane station on the eastbound.

It opened on January 9, 1984, and replaced Plamondon station as the western terminus of the line until Côte-Vertu station opened in 1986.

== Overview ==
The station is a normal side platform station with an entrance at either end. The southern entrance is located in a bus loop.

The station was designed by Gilles S. Bonnetto and Jacques Garand, and contains several artworks. The northern entrance contains four stained-glass windows, one by Lyse Charland Favretti on the theme of education and three by Pierre Osterrath on the borough of Saint-Laurent, its agricultural past, and its future. The southern entrance contains another stained-glass window by Favretti representing the borough&#x27;s aeronautics industry, as well as an abstract relief in brick by Aurelio Sandonato. The station&#x27;s best-known architectural feature, however, is an Ionic column in the northern mezzanine.

In May 2018, elevators were inaugurated at the station, making it fully accessible.

Côte-Vertu metro station was closed for 12 weeks from May 29 to August 22, 2021, and Du Collège temporarily served as northwestern terminus of the Orange line.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for the rue du Collège, whose name commemorates the nearby Cégep de Saint-Laurent, inaugurated as a college in 1847 and turned into a Cégep in 1968.

==Connecting bus routes==
With the reopening of Côte-Vertu station on August 23, 2021, the 64, 470 and 968 went back to the regular route at Côte-Vertu station. On the same day, the 76 McArthur is discontinued and the 100 Crémazie and the 460 Express Métropolitaine serve Du Collège station on the westbound and De la Savane station on the eastbound.

<text>Côte-Vertu station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Saint-Laurent in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line. It opened on November 3, 1986 and has been the western terminus of the Orange Line since that date, having taken over from Du Collège station.

== Overview ==
The station is a normal side platform station with one transept, a mezzanine and three entrances.

The station was designed by the architectural firms of Jodoin, Lamarre, Pratte, &amp; Co and Cayouette &amp; Saia. It contains two artworks: a set of two mural sculptures by Yves Trudeau in the transept, entitled &quot;Relief, négatif positif&quot;, and a mural by Éric Lamontagne in the new bus terminus, entitled &quot;L&#x27;Homo urbanus&quot;.

It was originally intended as a temporary terminus, to be followed by a two to three station extension to a point somewhat beyond the current Bois-Franc commuter train station; however, this never took place. Because this station was intended to be a temporary terminus, the passenger accesses are much too small. During rush hour it can take several minutes for the platform to clear while trains arrive only 2 minutes apart.

As this station is the terminus for several bus routes, including three Société de transport de Laval (STL) buses, a new bus terminal around the northern entrance was completed in 2005. Three new bus shelters at the southern entrance on Edouard-Laurin Boulevard, serving the metropolitan routes, were finished at about the same time. One of these three has since been eliminated. 

The station is equipped with the MétroVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the time till the next train. In November 2010, Côte-Vertu became the 7th station to be wheelchair accessible as elevators were added.

The entrance from rue Gohier at the corner of boulevard Côte-Vertu has been eliminated.

In 2019, Côte-Vertu was closed for 3 weekends between March 29 and April 15 for electrical work
related to the Côte-Vertu garage.

The station underwent construction to build a new garage to increase frequency during rush hours and it was closed from May 29 to August 22, 2021 to install a track switch just south of the station to allow trains to turn back more quickly.

==Origin of name==
This station is named for the Boulevard de la Côte-Vertu. The area through which the street runs has been known as Notre-Dame-de-Vertu, Notre-Dame-de-la-Vertu, or Notre-Dame-des-Vertus (Our Lady of Virtue) since at least 1700.

<doc id="1314502" wikidata="Q7493547" url="?curid=1314502" title="Sheldon School">
<text>Sheldon School (formerly Chippenham Boys&#x27; High School) is a large mixed secondary school and sixth form in Chippenham, Wiltshire for students aged 11 to 18 and is the largest school in Wiltshire. Since April 2011, it has been an Academy. It is one of three secondary schools in Chippenham, the others being Abbeyfield and Hardenhuish. The school is headed by Peter Lynch, former Headteacher of Bradley Stoke Community School, who was appointed in September 2023. The school is off the Hardenhuish Lane in the southern region of Hardenhuish Park, which is all that separates it from Hardenhuish School to the north.

==History==

===Earliest records===
In AD 854, documents record the settlement known as Hardenhuish on the north-west side of Chippenham. The name probably derives from the family holding of one Herejeard, who occupied the land.

In 1066, the Domesday survey establishes the owner as Arnulf who held it before this date. The medieval manor house and church were situated on the flat land which now forms Sheldon School&#x27;s playing fields.

===18th century===
In 1707, the Colborne family purchased the estate and selected a new site for a fine Georgian house, Hardenhuish House, on higher ground to the north, built from 1773 to 1774.

In 1777, Joseph Colborne of Hardenhuish became Sheriff of Wiltshire.

In 1779, Colborne decided that a new church should be erected on higher ground to the west of his new house. Dedicated to Saint Nicholas, it was designed by the famous Bath architect John Wood and is supposed to contain recycled material from the earlier church.

===19th century===
In 1822, the Clutterbuck family bought the Hardenhuish estate.

In 1826, Thomas Clutterbuck of Hardenhuish became Sheriff of Wiltshire.

In 1854, Edmund Lewis Clutterbuck of Hardenhuish became Sheriff of Wiltshire.

From 1875 a private venture grammar school existed in Chippenham, conducted in St. Mary Street by a Mr. Wilson and from 1883 by Mr. Cruikshank.

In 1891, the Technical Instruction Act 1889 (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c. 76) and the Technical Instruction Act 1891 (54 &amp; 55 Vict. c. 4) provided financial assistance for evening classes in various science and arts subjects. Earlier voluntary classes were now coordinated, and this became the beginning of a national system of technical education. Subjects included Shorthand, Animal Physiology, Chemistry, Physics, Hygiene, Carpentry and Dressmaking.

In 1893, Edward Newall Tuck was appointed by the Education Committee of the Borough of Chippenham to organise technical classes in Chippenham and district. Classes were held in rented premises at No. 21 London Road and at the Jubilee Institute, as well as villages including Grittleton and Yatton Keynell. Teachers from elementary schools attended classes in a School of Art on Saturdays at the Jubilee Institute. Tuck, in addition, gave talks on Wiltshire history and nature study; he also served as town councillor and was Mayor of Chippenham from 1931 to 1932.

In 1894, pupils were not admitted to classes until they reached the age of 11. Pupils from day schools were admitted free from aged 11 to 16. The fees at this time were fixed at 6d per month, the whole expenses of the school being met by fees and grants from the Science and Art Department and the County Council. Higher grade classes for boys, including Woodwork and Chemistry, were held at No. 21 London Road.

===John Coles===
In 1896, under the provisions of the Technical and Industrial Institutions Act 1892 (55 &amp; 56 Vict. c. 29), the Borough of Chippenham established the Chippenham and District County School, subsequently known as the Chippenham County Secondary School for Boys and Girls, with Tuck as the first headmaster (he would remain in this post until 1939). The first Chair of Governors was former mayor Alderman John Coles.

The premises were still No. 21 London Road and the Jubilee Institute. As the tenancy of the private venture school was to end on 25 March 1896, the Town Council paid Cruikshank £10 for the desks, books and goodwill of his school. Boys were drawn from three elementary schools in Chippenham: the British, National and St. Paul&#x27;s Schools. In addition, twelve boys had previously attended the private grammar school. Others were from other private schools in Chippenham, Corsham, Devizes, Calne and surrounding villages. 39 boys aged 11 to 16 were on the admission register from 13 April 1896. The curriculum included Latin, French, Science, History, Geography, Grammar, Book-keeping, Shorthand, Arithmetic, Writing, Geometry and Freehand Drawing.

In September 1898, a girls&#x27; school was established, against some opposition, in the Temperance Hall, Foghamshire. 22 girls were admitted at opening, from the schools of Mrs Parry (Market Place), Miss Alexander (Monkton Hill), Mrs White (Marshfield Road), from private tuition and from local National and British schools.

===20th century===
On 24 September 1900, the Chippenham District County School opened in Cocklebury Lane, now part of Wiltshire College, (built on an acre of land purchased in 1896 by the County, Urban and Rural District Councils). The ceremony was attended by the Mayor and Aldermen of Chippenham. In addition to Mr Edward Newall Tuck the headmaster, the staff included three masters and one mistress; there were 99 pupils. The cost of the project was £6,000. In addition to the buildings and playground, four acres of adjoining land were rented for playing fields. All day classes were consolidated here and pupil numbers increased rapidly.

On 1 May 1901, the decision was taken by the Governors for the school to become a Science School. Scholarships were granted to three female and one male student. In July it was decided to establish a centre for pupil-teachers at the school.

In 1902, local education authorities were established and Wiltshire County Council became responsible for education in Chippenham.

Latin was omitted from the curriculum.

By 1904 there were 101 pupils, 50 from urban and 51 from rural areas. In addition, 49 pupil teachers were attending, 9 from urban and the remainder from rural schools, and the evening classes had 139 pupils.

From 1905, girls from elementary schools attended Cookery classes at the Cocklebury Road site.

In 1906, Sir Gabriel Goldney, 2nd Baronet, of Hardenhuish Park became Sheriff of Wiltshire.

By October 1907 the school had 128 pupils, 64 boys and 64 girls. The age of admission was 9, and the leaving age 17 to 18. In addition to the yearly fees paid by pupils, the school was financed by County and Government grants.

In 1908 the fees were £5 5s. 0d. a year, including books. However, there were a number of scholarships available and figures for the year show that of 115 pupils – 66 girls and 49 boys – 57 held scholarships, one a free place, thus only 57 were fee-payers.

===The interwar years===
In 1922, the school received further County and Government grants.

In the interwar years, the number of pupils on roll increased steadily, and by 1929 there were 262. The Junior department was reorganised as a kindergarten and preparatory form, catering for 61 children aged 8 to 10. However, the number of pupils over the age of 16 was proportionally small in comparison with the average for Wiltshire grammar schools, consequently, there was no discrete sixth form, although a small number of pupils did progress to university, some with the aid of County Scholarships.

By the early 1930s, the buildings were presenting difficulties of overcrowding.

By 1935, pupil numbers had reached 288. Hardenhuish Park was purchased from the Clutterbuck family by Wiltshire County Council in order to implement the educational requirements of the growing town.

===Grammar school===
In 1938, the Secondary Grammar School moved from Cocklebury Road to new buildings (since demolished), erected on the east side of Hardenhuish House. The old Manor House became the headmaster&#x27;s room, the school library and some classrooms. The new school extended over 40 acres of Hardenhuish Park. New buildings contained a hall, gymnasium, laboratories, classrooms, and cloakrooms.

In 1939, the Preparatory department closed.

By 1940 there were 414 pupils, of whom 25 were evacuees, 10 per cent were under the age of 11 and, still, only 2 per cent over 16. The Cocklebury Road premises became Chippenham County Secondary Modern School, a senior mixed school taking children aged 11 and over from the primary schools of Chippenham and district.

In late 1940 and early 1941 the school took in a large number of evacuees from Wanstead, East London, who had already spent a year in Gloucester. A field next to the school housed a camp occupied by soldiers of the 4th Armored Division and 11th Armored Division, whose headquarters were at Lackham House and Manor. Close relations developed between these troops and the school.

===Post WWII===
In 1946, Eric Minter was appointed the headmaster at Chippenham County Secondary Modern School.

Following the war, there was a steady increase in the numbers of pupils and additional buildings were constructed. The catchment area of the school covered the triangle between Chippenham, Corsham and Melksham.

In 1956, with pupil numbers at 547 (102 of these in the sixth form), constant growth of the area saw the major development of a new secondary modern school for girls to the south of Hardenhuish Church. On 28 September, the new Girls&#x27; High School opened. These buildings now form part of Hardenhuish School.

In 1958, a field was purchased at the Folly to enable an approach road to be made to serve the new secondary schools.

===Chippenham Boys&#x27; High School===
In 1959, a secondary modern, Chippenham Boys&#x27; High School, was constructed lower down Hardenhuish Park. These buildings now form part of Sheldon School. The school was officially opened on 8 July 1959 by the Minister of Education, Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd.

In 1960, more Grammar School buildings were erected behind Hardenhuish House due to the continual growth of Chippenham. The school began to admit 120 instead of 90 each year. The three schools occupied some 40 acres of Hardenhuish Park and some 2,000 boys and girls attended from the Borough and from the district within a radius of about eight miles.

In 1966, the Grammar School and the Girls&#x27; High School integrated with the Chippenham secondary modern schools in a semi-comprehensive system with all 11 to 13-year-old boys and girls being educated on the Hardenhuish site. Minter retired as headmaster and was awarded the OBE.

In 1967, George Morgan was appointed the headmaster.

===Comprehensive===
In 1975, the three schools were merged into two comprehensive schools, under the names Hardenhuish and Sheldon. Hardenhuish was made up of the old Grammar School and Girls&#x27; High School buildings, spread across the old Hardenhuish estate and comprising seven blocks. Sheldon would take pupils from the southern and eastern areas of the town and villages to the west of the Malmesbury road, while Hardenhuish would serve the northern and western areas of Chippenham and villages to the east.

The headmaster George Morgan chose the name &quot;Sheldon&quot; (once a medieval village, then a manor), to reflect the school&#x27;s having become coeducational.

In 1979, Anita Higham became headteacher and was replaced by Caroline Cox in 1985.

In 1991, admissions procedure changed to allow pupils living in the designated area of Chippenham urban primary schools to state a preference for either comprehensive school.

The Science block was added in 1996, followed by the Design &amp; Technology block in 1998.

In 1997, Tony Cleaver was appointed headteacher. The school was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot;’s Top 100 State Schools. Sheldon became the first school in Wiltshire to gain the national Investors in People Award, recognising the quality of staff training and development. It also achieved the new Sportsmark award for the &quot;outstanding quality of physical education and sporting provision&quot;, one of only 400 schools nationally to receive the accolade. Work on the new AstroTurf pitch was completed.

In 1999, Sheldon became a Foundation School. The school&#x27;s intake increased to 10 tutor groups. It also had its second &quot;outstanding&quot; Ofsted report.

===21st century===
In 2000, Sheldon was identified as &quot;excellent&quot; by Ofsted (Her Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Schools In England). It was the first school in Wiltshire to be awarded Beacon Status, awarded to schools identified as the best performing in the country. The Arts block was added.

In 2001, Sheldon was awarded Sportsmark Gold, the first Wiltshire school to achieve this award.

In 2002, the school was awarded Specialist School Status and was designated as one of England&#x27;s first Science Colleges. Sheldon was awarded FA Charter Standard from The Football Association.

In 2003, the Learning Support Centre opened. On its Olympic Day Fun Run, Sheldon set a new world record for a biggest single school run, with in excess of 900 runners.

In 2004, Gerard MacMahon was appointed headteacher. Sheldon was again awarded Sportsmark Gold. It was also awarded the Artsmark Award, for the quality of performing arts. The school also achieved The Healthy Schools Award.

In 2005, Sheldon was named in Ofsted&#x27;s roll of honour as one of &quot;the best of the best&quot; with two &quot;outstanding&quot; inspections. It had its third &quot;outstanding&quot; Ofsted report, the only comprehensive school in the south west to have achieved this accolade. The school was also elected to the Specialist Schools Trust &quot;Value Added&quot; club for schools with the most pupil progress between key stages.

In 2006, Sheldon was re-designated Specialist School Status which helped to enrich and transform the scientific aspects of numerous subject areas.

In 2007, the school was again identified as a high performing Specialist School and designated a second specialism as a Sports College with the Performing Arts. It was also awarded Artsmark Silver.
In 2008, in its fourth Ofsted inspection Sheldon was judged to be &quot;outstanding&quot; in all 38 categories that made up the new inspection framework. The Sixth Form Centre was opened.

In 2009, the school was designated a third specialism as a Language College.

In 2011, Matt Dawson opened The Refectory, an award-winning hot &amp; cold dining area.

===Academy===
On 1 April 2011, Sheldon School became an Academy.

In 2012, Neil Spurdell was appointed headteacher.

In 2023, Peter Lynch was appointed headteacher.

==2011 Chippenham Vision survey==
In June 2011, 40 sixth formers contributed to a survey carried out by The Chippenham Vision for the Spatial Planning Team at Wiltshire County Council, to assess opinions. Voting was on a range of key local issues in a questionnaire produced by The Chippenham Stakeholder Workshop, in September 2010. The Council said, &quot;The responses gathered through the consultation will be used to help draft the Wiltshire Core Strategy – a plan which sets out long-term planning and development aims and principles. This will ensure local people continue to have an integral role in shaping plans which will affect them and their communities&quot;.

==Ofsted and academic performance==
In its March 2008 inspection, Sheldon was judged to be &quot;outstanding&quot; in all 38 inspection categories, an exceptional achievement matched by only six comprehensive schools in 1,500 Ofsted inspections. In the January 2011 Interim Assessment statement, parents were informed that indications were that &quot;performance has been sustained&quot;.

At the most recent full inspection in October 2012, Sheldon was judged to be &quot;good&quot; overall. Despite standards having dropped, the school was praised for its pupils&#x27; behaviour, stating that it was &quot;outstanding&quot;. It also mentioned that &quot;To improve further, the inspectors highlighted the need for the very good teaching observed in the classroom to be taken to an even higher level&quot;.

A short inspection in June 2017 repeated the &quot;good&quot; assessment, stating &quot;The leadership team has maintained the good quality of education in the school since the last inspection&quot;. Concerns were raised over the difference in achievement between disadvantaged pupils and others, and the attendance record of some disadvantaged pupils.

<doc id="1314506" wikidata="Q2761628" url="?curid=1314506" title="Gift (Taproot album)">
<text>Gift is the third studio album and major label debut by American alternative metal band Taproot. It was released on June 27, 2000. The singles &quot;Again &amp; Again&quot; and &quot;I&quot; reached No. 39 and No. 34 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The album has sold over 250,000 copies.

==Background, writing and recording==

Taproot singer Stephen Richards told &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; that the songs on &quot;Gift&quot; were written in 1997, playing the songs for a few years. He claimed that &quot;Dragged Down&quot; and &quot;Now&quot; were the only songs written specifically for &quot;Gift&quot;. Taproot spent six weeks working on &quot;Gift&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
Described as a nu metal album, the album&#x27;s lyrical themes are primarily about topics such as depression and disliking life. Taproot&#x27;s vocalist Stephen Richards&#x27; vocals on the album &quot;Gift&quot; have been compared to vocalists such as Chino Moreno, Trent Reznor, Jonathan Davis and Mike Patton. The album consists of vocal styles such as singing, rapping, growling and screaming.

==Reception==

AllMusic&#x27;s Brian Musich stated &quot;dropping in a time when rap-rock is all the rage, as it sells albums like mad, garners instant publicity from MTV, and packs stadiums in a new generation of concert festivals, Taproot is guaranteed media exposure and a large built-in fan base.&quot; He added, &quot;If they had dropped &quot;Gift&quot; two years earlier, Taproot would be pioneers. Instead, they are adequate followers.&quot; In June 2000, &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; called the music &quot;blistering melodic metal&quot; and compared the vocals to Incubus and Faith No More. In her July 2000 review, &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot;&#x27;s Amy Sciarretto wrote that it &quot;sounds like Faith No More engorged with programming or Incubus spiked with more guitar grit.&quot; In October 2000, Ben Raynor of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; gave the album a positive review, and praised the vocals of Stephen Richards, writing that, &quot;Taproot are the perfect antidote to rap metal at a time when music needs them.&quot;

==Track listing==

==Notes==
*Tracks 2, 6, 7, 9 and 11 are re-recordings of early songs the appeared on the demos, &quot;...Something More Than Nothing&quot; and &quot;Upon Us&quot;. Both were released in 1998 and 1999.

<text>Cartier station () is a Montreal Metro station in Laval, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line. Located in the Pont-Viau district, it is part of an extension into Laval, and opened on April 28, 2007.

== Architecture ==
It is a normal side platform station. The station&#x27;s main entrance, adjoining the bus terminal, takes the form of a right triangle, with the legs parallel to the streets and the hypotenuse parallel to the tracks, thereby bringing the aboveground and underground world into relation. There is an entrance at each of the two points of the triangle, while the centre is sunken to provide access to the escalators to the ticket hall and to the tunnel to the secondary entrance. The sunken area looks out onto a sunken garden.

A second entrance on the opposite corner of Boul. des Laurentides and Boul. Cartier, to spare pedestrians from crossing the busy boulevard, was opened on May 22, 2009.

The station features two artworks. The first, &quot;L&#x27;Homme est un roseau pensant III&quot; by Jacek Jarnuszkiewicz, is a pair of tall, slender metal spires on the edge of the garden. The second, &quot;Dessins suspendus&quot; by Yvon Proulx, is installed in the secondary entrance.

==Origin of name==

<text>De la Concorde station () is an intermodal transit station in Laval, Quebec, Canada. It serves the Montreal Metro&#x27;s Orange Line and connects to Exo&#x27;s Saint-Jérôme commuter rail line. It is located in the Laval-des-Rapides district and opened April 28, 2007, as part of Montreal Metro&#x27;s extension into Laval.

==Description==
The station is named after boulevard de la Concorde, which in turn is named for the Place de la Concorde in Paris. The entrance building is split-level, the lower providing access to the Metro station and the upper level to the train station, with the platforms continuing towards the walkway that goes under the rail bridge that crosses Boul. de la Concorde. This walkway is higher than the sidewalk. On the west side of the station, opposite the Metro station, stairs connect the sidewalk with the walkway.

==Montreal Metro==

The station is a side platform station, built in tunnel with an open-pit central section in the shape of a cube. The upper surface of the cube protrudes out of the earth and is rimmed with skylights, producing a sundial-like effect as the progress of the sun changes the light within the cube. The station&#x27;s decor is primarily bare concrete, metal, and steel, with the platform&#x27;s ultramarine tiles and enlarged photographs of grass providing colour.

The escalator shaft from the entrance building to the ticket hall also protrudes out of the earth as a glazed cylinder reminiscent of Norman Foster&#x27;s &quot;fosterito&quot; metro entrances in the Bilbao metro. The entrance building is split-level, one level providing access to the station and the other to the train station; its glazed front is decorated with a large Metro logo.

The train station is located at an upper level and the platforms continue onto a viaduct over Boul. de la Concorde. Also at this level is a park and ride loop and bicycle trail access.

The area to the east of the station entrance is landscaped, with benches and a terrace provided on top of the station cube. The footpath leading to the station is the site of the station&#x27;s artwork, &quot;Nos allers-retours&quot; (translation: &quot;our departures and returns&quot;) by Yves Gendreau. The sculpture is a series of tangled metal tubes, in the colours of the Metro lines plus purple for the commuter trains, atop a series of poles, representing the paths taken by the users of public transit.

==Commuter rail==

De La Concorde station is a commuter rail station operated by Exo in Laval, Quebec, Canada. It is served by the Saint-Jérôme line.

The station replaced Saint-Martin station, a commuter rail station that had been to the north, in order to be intermodal with the new Montreal Metro station, operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM).

==Connecting bus routes==
Although the station is intermodal with the Orange Line of the Montreal Metro, local bus services do not enter the station. The Société de transport de Laval (STL) bus routes 2, 33, 37 and 42 operate along the adjoining main thoroughfares of de la Concorde Boulevard West and Ampere Avenue.

<text>Montmorency station () is a Montreal Metro station in Laval, Quebec, Canada, operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM). It is located in the Laval-des-Rapides borough. The station is part of an extension to Laval and opened on April 28, 2007, becoming the northern terminus of the Orange Line. After two years of opening, the Metro had generated an extra 60,000 daily passengers, around twice as originally estimated.

== Overview == 

It is a normal side platform station. This station has the highest ceilings of any station in the network. The wall panels are decorated with tiling in diagonal stripes of retro shades of cyan, navy, straw yellow and brick red.

The station is equipped with the MétroVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the waiting time until the arrival of the next train.

This station has underground city access to the Université de Montréal’s Laval campus.

==Origin of name==
The station is located across the street from Cégep Montmorency. The CEGEP got its name from François de Montmorency-Laval (1623–1703), the first bishop of Quebec and New France from 1674 to 1688.

==Terminus Montmorency==

A large bus terminus with 10 platforms and an indoor waiting area adjoins the station. The building, which is operated by the RTM features an RTM ticket counter as well as a convenience store and a coffee shop. In addition, the station has parking for 1342 cars – 644 free outdoor park and ride spaces and 698 paying spaces (54 outdoor, 644 indoor). The indoor spaces cost $7 a day or $80 per month (if a user purchases a monthly parking pass). All bus traffic enters and leaves on boulevard de l&#x27;Avenir, while all parking spaces are accessed via rue Lucien Paiement.

<text>Bogusław Leszczyński, count of Leszno (1614–1659) from the Leszczyński Family of Holy Roman Empire counts, was a Polish noble (&quot;szlachcic&quot;) and politician from Wielkopolska region.

== Biography ==
Traveled abroad from 1632-1636 with his tutor John Jonston, studied under Comenius.

Bogusław held the following official positions:
*General Starost of Greater Poland in 1642
*Grand Treasurer of the Crown 1650–1658
*Deputy Chancellor of the Crown in 1658–1660
*Starost of Bydgoszcz, Sambor, Międzyrzecz, Ostrów, Człuchów and Osiek.

He was the son of Rafał Leszczyński, count of Leszno, and Anna Radzimińska. After the death of his father in 1636 he inherited Leszno, Radzymin and part of Warsawian Praga. Bogusław married twice, first to Countess Anna Dönhoff, from a prominent Pomeranian family, in 1629 and later to the daughter of Court and Grand Marshal Prince Aleksander Ludwik Radziwiłł, princess Joanna Katarzyna Radziwiłł, in 1658.

Bogusław Leszczyński was a Czech brethren. Converted to Catholicism in 1642 but always supported Protestants. He was a frequent deputy and known orator of the Sejm, the lower house of the Polish parliament. He was a political rival of Krzysztof Opaliński. Also, he was often in opposition to plans of king Władysław IV Waza.

During the Swedish invasion of 1655 (&quot;The Deluge&quot;), he was committed by a chapter of the Sejm to defend the province of Greater Poland, but instead Bogusław began to negotiate with the Swedes and the Prussian elector.

Although considered a great speaker, he was also criticised by many for being selfish and dishonorable. He was suspected of of money and royal jewels. A telling story is that when he was offered a Chancellor&#x27;s post, he bribed the members of the parliament to grant him &quot;absolution&quot;, and when one of them later opposed him, he asked, curious: &quot;Who&#x27;s this son of a bitch that I failed to pay off?&quot; After his death in 1659, deputies of the Sejm in 1662 were appointed to take matters up with his beneficiaries.

Bogusław held the following Sejm positions in Warsaw:
* Marshal of the ordinary Sejm on 20 July – 4 October 1641,
* Convocation sejm on 16 July – 1 August 1648
* Member of ordinary Sejm of 22 November 1649 – 13 January 1650

Bogusław&#x27;s grandson Stanisław Leszczyński was King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the father-in-law of Louis XV of France.

<text>Strato I Dikaios (Greek: &quot;Strátо̄n Díkaios,&quot; “Strato the Just”) also known as Stratha in Sanskrit, was a Yavana King (reigned 125/120-110 BCE), the son and successor of Menander, Strato’s mother, Agathoclea ruled as Queen Mother and regnant for Strato until 120 BCE, when he was of age to succeed his father. He was dynastically succeeded by his son, Menander II.

==Date and genealogy==

Until recently, consensus was that he ruled between c. 130–110 BCE in Northern India and that his father was the great king Menander I. Menander ruled the entire Indo-Greek empire, but in this scenario, the western parts including Paropamisade and Arachosia gained independence after the death of Menander I, pushing Strato and Agathokleia eastwards to Gandhara and Punjab. This view was introduced by Tarn and defended as recently as 1998 by Bopearachchi.

The modern view, embraced by R. C. Senior and probably more solid since it is founded on numismatical analyses, suggests that Strato I was a later king, perhaps ruling from 110–85 BCE, though perhaps still a descendant of Agathokleia. In this case, Agathokleia was the widow of another king, possibly Nicias or Theophilus.

A third hypothesis was presented in 2007 by J. Jakobsson: according to this, the coins of Strato in fact belong to two kings who both may have ruled around 105–80 BCE, though in different territories: 
* Strato Soter and Dikaios (Greek: &quot;ΣΤΡΑΤΩΝ Ο ΣΩΤΗΡ ΚΑΙ ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣ&quot; &quot;Strato the saviour and just/righteous&quot;), was Agathokleia&#x27;s son.
* Strato Epiphanes Soter (Greek: &quot;ΣΤΡΑΤΩΝ Ο ΕΠΙΦΑΝΗΣ ΣΩΤΗΡ&quot; &quot;Strato the illustrious, saviour&quot;), was a middle-aged king who may have been Agathokleia&#x27;s brother and ruled in western Punjab.
This theory was based on difference in titles, in monograms and coin types between the two.

==Events during his reign==

Agathocleia&#x27;s importance was gradually downplayed on the coins, so presumably her guardianship ended when Strato came of age. Strato I was also the only Indo-Greek king to appear bearded, probably to indicate that he was no longer an infant. Strato I, or the two Stratos, fought for hegemony in Punjab with the king Heliokles II, who overstruck several of their coins. There were very likely wars with other kings as well. The middle-aged Strato, according to the third theory, was succeeded by his son Polyxenios, who ruled only for a short time. 
A hoard of Strato&#x27;s coins was found in Mathura outside New Delhi, which may have been the easternmost outpost of the Indo-Greek territory.

<doc id="1314868" wikidata="Q2121595" url="?curid=1314868" title="Robert Kuok">
<text>Robert Kuok Hock Nien, better known as Robert Kuok, (born 6 October 1923) is a Malaysian business magnate, investor and philanthropist based in Hong Kong since 1973. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, his net worth is estimated at $11.8 billion as of April 2023, making him the wealthiest Malaysian citizen and 96th wealthiest person in the world. As of April 2023, according to the &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index 2023&quot;, Kuok has an estimated net worth of $17.7 billion, making him the 97th richest person in the world.

Although Kuok is a major figure in business circles in East and Southeast Asia, he has remained media shy and maintains a low public profile despite his massive business success and immense wealth, with most of his companies being privately held by him or his family members. Apart from presiding the ownership over a multitude of businesses spread across numerous industries in the Malaysian economic landscape, his companies have investments in many countries throughout Continental Asia.

His business interests (collectively known as the Kuok Group of Companies) range from sugarcane plantations (Perlis Plantations Bhd), sugar refineries, flour milling, animal feed, oil, mining, financial services, hotel (Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts), real estate (Kerry Properties), trading, freight shipping (Kerry Logistics) and publishing. The biggest source of wealth that has contributed to his private fortune is a stake in the Singaporean company Wilmar International, the world&#x27;s largest listed palm oil trader company. For three months in 2018, Kuok was appointed to the Council of Eminent Persons as an advisor during Mahathir Mohamad&#x27;s second stint as prime minister.

==Early life and education==
Kuok was born on 6 October 1923 in Johor Bahru during British colonial rule to a wealthy Malaysian Chinese family. He was named after Robert the Bruce, and was enrolled at an English-medium primary school by his father&#x27;s English-speaking clerk. Kuok&#x27;s father Kuok Keng Kang arrived in British Malaya from Fuzhou (Hokchew), Fujian (Hokkien), China, at the beginning of the 20th century, and Robert was the youngest of three brothers born to Kuok Keng Kang and Robert&#x27;s mother Zheng Ge Ru. He grew up speaking his parents&#x27; Fuzhou dialect, English and later Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Malaya in World War II. He also studied at English College Johore Bahru for his secondary education and later at Raffles Institution in Singapore where he was classmates with Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore and the country&#x27;s first prime minister. 

==Business career==
===Early 20th century===
According to Kuok himself, he began his business career as an office boy, and later started a business from scratch with financial backing coming from his relatives. Upon graduation, he became a collaborator and worked as a clerk in the rice-trading department of Japanese industrial conglomerate Mitsubishi Shoji Kaisha during the Japanese occupation period between 1942 and 1945, in Singapore, a conglomerate that with the help of Japanese military unit monopolized the rice trade in Malaya during the occupation period. He was soon promoted to head the rice-trading department. After the war, he took the skills he learned from the occupying force to the family&#x27;s business in Johor.

After the senior Kuok died in 1948, Kuok and his two brothers and a cousin, Kuok Hock Chin founded &quot;Kuok Brothers Sdn Bhd&quot; in 1949, trading agricultural commodities. Kuok&#x27;s relationship with the Japanese continued after Malaya gained independence. In 1959, Kuok formed Malayan Sugar Manufacturing Co. Bhd. together with two prominent Japanese partners. He also brought many influential Malay elites into his company as directors and shareholders, including politicians and royalty. In 1961, he bought cheap sugar from India before the prices shot up, and continued to invest heavily in sugar refineries, at one time controlling 80% of the Malaysian sugar market with production of 1.5 million tonnes, equivalent to 10% of world production, earning himself the nickname &quot;Sugar King of Asia&quot; in the process.

===Late 20th century===
In 1971, he built the first Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore; with land acquired through Petaling Garden Berhad, a Malaysian based developer. His first foray into Hong Kong property was in 1977, when he acquired a plot of land on the newly reclaimed Tsim Sha Tsui East waterfront, where he built his second hotel, the Kowloon Shangri-La. In 1993, his Kerry Group acquired a 34.9% stake in the South China Morning Post from Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation. Kuok officially retired from the Kerry Group on 1 April 1993.

His companies have investments in many countries, including Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, Mainland China, Indonesia, Fiji, and Australia. Businesses in China include 10 bottling companies for Coca-Cola and the ownership of the Beijing World Trade Centre. His company&#x27;s freight shipping interests include Malaysian Bulk Carriers Berhad and Transmile Group.

===21st century===
In 2007, Kuok merged his plantations, edible oil, and grain businesses with Wilmar International, making it the world&#x27;s biggest palm-oil processor.

On 31 October 2009, the PPB Group under the flagship of Robert Kuok issued a statement to the Bursa Malaysia that it had decided to dispose of its sugar units along with land used to cultivate sugar cane for RM 1.29 billion to FELDA. The sales resulted in a one-off gain for the company.

In February 2014, PACC Offshore Services Holdings (POSH), a Singaporean-based oil services operator owned by Kuok started pre-IPO talks with investors to list on the Singapore Stock Exchange to raise $400 million.

==Politics==
His political influence is attested by his selection as one of the Hong Kong Affairs Advisors in the run-up to the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and his minority stake in CITIC Pacific. He was also instrumental in conveying information and setting up the meetings between Malaysian and Chinese governments leading to full diplomatic cross recognition of the two countries.

On 12 May 2018, in the aftermath of the Malaysian general election that year where Mahathir Mohamad returned as prime minister of Malaysia, Kuok was appointed to the five-member Council of Eminent Persons along with Tun Daim Zainuddin, Tan Sri Datuk Seri Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Tan Sri Hassan Marican and Jomo Kwame Sundaram to advise the Pakatan Harapan (PH) federal government. The council was dissolved on 17 August 2018.

==Personal life==
Kuok has been married twice. His first wife was Joyce Cheah and his second wife is Pauline Ho Poh Lin. He has eight children from the marriages. His son, Kuok Khoon Ean born in 1955 married Kuok Cheng Sui and holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from the University of Nottingham, England. His other son, Kuok Khoon Ho is the chairman of Kuok Brothers, born in 1951 and holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree from McGill University, Canada. Kuok Hui Kwong, his daughter, is the managing director and chief executive of SCMP Group and chairperson of Shangri-La Asia. One of his sons, Kuok Khoon Ean, handles most of the day-to-day operations of his businesses. He resides in Kuala Lumpur. During the reign of Iskandar of Johor as the King of Malaysia, Kuok was offered a &quot;Yang Berbahagia Tan Sri&quot; title (comparable to Sir), but rejected the offer.

Kuok&#x27;s brother, Philip Kuok Hock Khee was a former Malaysian Ambassador to Germany, Yugoslavia, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark. Philip married Eileen Kuok and had two sons and two daughters. Philip Kuok died in 2003. Another brother, William Kuok Hock Ling, was a member of the Malayan Communist Party and was killed during the Malayan Emergency in 1952. According to his memoir, Kuok described that of all the brothers, his mother Zheng Ge Ru doted on and adored William the most, and was heartbroken when she received news of his death.

His nephew, Kuok Khoon Hong is the chairman of Wilmar International, and one of the richest people in Singapore. Kuok Khoon Hong&#x27;s father, Kuok Hock Swee, was an older cousin of Robert Kuok. His grand-nephew, Kuok Meng Ru, is in the music retail industry, owning Swee Lee music company.

Kuok is a follower of Buddhism. He lives in the Deep Water Bay neighbourhood on Hong Kong Island. In 2023, Kuok became a centenarian.

==Bibliography==
In March 2018, Kuok published a book about his life entitled, &quot;Robert Kuok: A Memoir.&quot; It won Best Book of the Year at the Singapore Book Publishers Association awards 2018.

<doc id="1314873" wikidata="Q438275" url="?curid=1314873" title="Theodore F. Green">
<text>Theodore Francis Green (October 2, 1867May 19, 1966) was an American politician from Rhode Island. A Democrat, Green served as the 57th Governor of Rhode Island (1933–1937) and in the United States Senate (1937–1961). Green was a strong supporter of Wilsonian internationalism during the administrations of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. He served as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 1957 to 1959. At the time of his retirement in 1961, he set the record at age 93 of the oldest person to serve in the Senate; the record was subsequently broken by Strom Thurmond.

==Early years==
Born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Arnold Green, a lawyer, and Cornelia Abby Burges, he graduated from Providence High School in 1883 and Brown University in 1887, receiving a Master of Arts degree from Brown in 1888. He attended Harvard Law School from 1888 to 1890 and studied at the University of Bonn and University of Berlin from 1890 to 1892. A lifelong bachelor, Green devoted himself to the law, politics, and civic, business, and cultural activities. Admitted to the Rhode Island Bar in 1892, he long practiced law, taking time during the Spanish–American War to serve in the Rhode Island Militia as a first lieutenant in command of a provisional infantry company. He served as president of J. P. Coats Company from 1912 to 1923 and Morris Plan Banker&#x27;s Association from 1900 to 1929.

==Public service==
Green began his career in public life in 1907 as a member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives. Active in Democratic Party politics as chairman of state committees and a delegate to Democratic National Conventions, he was an unsuccessful candidate for governor (1912, 1928, 1930) and the U.S. House of Representatives (1920). Party loyalty, perseverance, and the Great Depression won him election as governor in 1932. He served two terms (1933–1937).

===&quot;Bloodless Revolution&quot;===
Until the 1934 United States elections, the Republican Party dominated the Rhode Island Senate. This resulted in part from the unequal nature of senatorial districts; every municipality in the state was represented by a senator, despite significant imbalances in population between different towns. For example, both the 485 residents of West Greenwich and the 275,000 residents of Providence were represented by one senator each. Republicans won small towns with majority Protestant populations, while Democrats won larger cities with significant immigrant Catholic populations; as a consequence, even when Democrats won the statewide vote, Republicans would win more senatorial districts. The Senate additionally held much of the executive and appointment power in the state, such as the power to name judges. This left the state governor oftentimes a figurehead, especially if they were a Democrat. Democrats called this system &quot;feudal&quot; and analogized it to the United Kingdom&#x27;s rotten boroughs, even though unequally-sized state legislative upper houses were common in the United States prior to the 1964 Supreme Court decision in &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;.

The 1934 elections were a national Democratic landslide, with Green winning re-election as governor, and Democrats winning control of the Rhode Island House of Representatives. However, they fell just short of controlling the Rhode Island Senate, winning 20 seats to Republicans&#x27; 22. Democrats claimed fraud in two races where Republicans had won. On January 1, 1935, Lt. Gov. Robert E. Quinn refused to allow two Republican senators who were certified as elected to take office. A committee of three senators (two Democrats and one Republican) was appointed to recount the ballots for these two races. Behind closed doors, the committee reviewed the ballots and then unanimously proclaimed the Democrats as the winners. With the Senate in Democratic control, the General Assembly quickly reorganized state government, vacated the Supreme Court, and purged many Republican-dominated boards and commissions. A &quot;Providence Journal&quot; editorial likened this incident to a Central American &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot;. However, state Democrats celebrated the incident as overturning a long period of minority rule, and would later refer to it as the &quot;Bloodless Revolution.&quot;

===Senator===
At the age of 69, Green was elected to the United States Senate in the Democratic landslide of 1936 and served four terms, retiring in 1961. Described as &quot;the president&#x27;s man&quot;, he was loyal to the Democratic presidents with whom he served and, to a larger extent than many other northern Democrats, to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican. Green vigorously supported domestic New Deal measures, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s controversial &quot;Court packing&quot; bill in 1937, but that failed. He voted for the wages and hours and low-cost housing bills in 1937, and advocating farm and work relief, he sustained continuing appropriations for New Deal relief measures.

As a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Green took a strong internationalist position in world affairs, especially regarding opposition to Nazi expansion in Europe. Green advocated expansion of the Navy and the Army, revision of the neutrality laws despite isolationist opposition, and passage of the Lend-Lease Bill, which in one of his many radio talks he called &quot;Aid to America&quot;.

During World War II, Green vigorously objected to a proposal to exempt farm workers from the draft as a means to increase agricultural production and secured passage of a law releasing government-owned silver for war purposes. He supported a law providing for absentee voting for servicemen stationed in the United States and headed a Senate committee investigating violations of the Hatch Act.

Throughout his senatorial career, Green supported civil rights legislation. He struggled to enact laws to ban the poll tax, to make lynching a federal crime, and to change Senate rules to make it easier to end filibusters. Consistently working closely with Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, he helped secure eastern liberal support for the Civil Rights Act of 1957. As the nation moved to the right at mid-century, Green retained his liberal faith, voting to uphold President Harry Truman&#x27;s vetoes of the restrictive McCarran-Walter Immigration Bill of 1952 and the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950. During the McCarthy controversy, he voted for censure of his Republican colleague Senator Joseph McCarthy.

For 20 of his 24 years in the Senate, Green served on the Foreign Relations Committee, beginning in 1938 and interrupted from 1947 to 1949. An early and steadfast internationalist committed to the United Nations, he stoutly sustained President Truman&#x27;s Cold War initiatives, including the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and intervention in Korea. At the 1952 meeting of the UN General Assembly, to which Truman appointed him as a delegate, Green expressed his faith in the world organization as the &quot;last great hope of mankind.&quot; He stood with the minority of 31 senators who by one vote prevented the two-thirds majority necessary to pass an amendment initiated by Senator John W. Bricker to limit the president&#x27;s powers in foreign policy.

In April 1943, a confidential analysis by British scholar Isaiah Berlin of the Foreign Relations Committee for the British Foreign Office succinctly characterized Green as:

Though wary of reductions in foreign aid programs with the coming of the Eisenhower administration, Green was one of the few northern Democrats to support administration measures in the Republican-dominated Senate of the Eighty-third Congress. In the Eighty-fifth Congress (1957–1958), Green served as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He was a loyal ally of Democratic Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson.

==Death==
In 1959, with his health failing, the 92-year-old Green resigned his chairmanship; he left the Senate at the conclusion of his term in 1961. Green died in Providence, Rhode Island on May 19, 1966, at the age of 98. He was interred at Swan Point Cemetery in Providence.

==Legacy==

* Rhode Island&#x27;s main airport, Rhode Island T. F. Green International Airport (formerly Hillsgrove Airport) in Warwick, is named after him.
* In 2010, activists in the Rhode Island Labor Movement began a drive to change the name of the airport to &quot;Workers Memorial Airport&quot; due to Green&#x27;s involvement in the violent suppression of a textile workers&#x27; strike in Saylesville, Rhode Island in 1934.
* Two bronze busts of Green (sculpted by Margaret Chambers Gould) are on public display in Rhode Island. One is at Green Airport in Warwick and the other is at the Rhode Island State House in Providence.

Following the death of Fenimore Chatterton of Wyoming on May 9, 1958, Green became the oldest living former US Governor, and the oldest living former US Senator following the death of George Pepper in 1961.

<text>The 1942 United States Senate elections were held November 3, 1942, midway through Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s third term as president. The 32 seats of Class 2 were contested in regular elections, and two special elections were held to fill vacancies.

Although this election took place during World War II, the opposition Republican party made major gains, taking eight seats from the Democrats and one from an independent. The Democrats nonetheless retained a significant majority, though the smallest since Roosevelt was first elected in 1932. However, for the first time since 1932, Democrats did not have a supermajority.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; ascribed the results to &quot;voters&#x27; dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war, both at home and abroad&quot; but not evidence of a lack of enthusiasm for the war effort. It found that a candidate&#x27;s stance as isolationist or interventionist before Pearl Harbor had little impact on his success at the polls. The paper&#x27;s editorial board welcomed a return to normal political alignments after the unbalanced majorities of the previous decade. The election not only changed the numbers of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, but also accomplished an ideological shift, as several longtime enthusiastic supporters of the New Deal were replaced by Republicans of the most conservative sort.

The Republicans gained enough seats to end the Democrats&#x27; supermajority control. Democrats later gained a seat in New Jersey through an appointment, bringing their seat total up to 58.

There were 2 elections to the same seat due to the January 12, 1941 resignation of Democrat Matthew M. Neely who was elected Governor of West Virginia. Democrat Joseph Rosier was appointed January 13, 1941 to continue the term, pending the special election. Primaries for both races were held August 4, 1942.

=== West Virginia (special) ===

Interim Democrat Joseph Rosier easily won the primary, but lost the special election to finish the term that would end in January 1943 to former congressman and 1936 Senate nominee Hugh Ike Shott.




=== West Virginia (regular) ===
Neither Shott nor Rosier were candidates in the regular election. Instead, governor (and former senator) Neely ran to reclaim his seat, having regretted leaving the Senate.

Neely won the Democratic primary but lost the regular election.




At the end of the term, Revercomb would lose re-election to Neely in 1948. He then won a special election to the other seat in 1956.

<text>The 1940 United States Senate elections coincided with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt to his third term as president. The 32 seats of Class 1 were contested in regular elections, and special elections were held to fill vacancies.

Although Roosevelt was re-elected, support for his administration had dropped somewhat after eight years, and the Republican opposition gained three seats from the Democrats. However, the New Deal Democrats regained firm control of both the House and Senate because Progressives dominated the election. The Minnesota Farmer–Labor Party also disappeared from the Senate, as Henrik Shipstead joined the Republican party and Ernest Lundeen had died during the preceding term. Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri was elected to his final term in the Senate in 1940. Truman resigned in 1945 to serve as President Roosevelt&#x27;s third Vice President.

Republicans later gained an additional seat through an appointment in Colorado.

Pittman suffered a severe heart attack just before the election on November 5, and two doctors told his aides before the election that death was imminent.

Pittman died on November 10 at the Washoe General Hospital in Reno, Nevada. Governor Edward Carville would go on to appoint Berkeley L. Bunker as his replacement.

In later years, a myth spread that Pittman had in fact died before the election, and his body had been kept on ice in the Mizpah Hotel in Tonopah so that Carville could appoint his replacement.

<text>The 1938 United States Senate elections occurred in the middle of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s second term. The 32 seats of Class 3 were contested in regular elections, and special elections were held to fill vacancies. The Republicans gained eight seats from the Democrats, though this occurred after multiple Democratic gains since the 1932 election, leading to the Democrats retaining a commanding lead over the Republicans with more than two-thirds of the legislative chamber.

A contemporary account cited a number of reasons for the losses suffered by the Democrats. The Recession of 1937 had continued into the first half of 1938, and had arguably weakened public confidence in the administration&#x27;s New Deal economic policies, along with controversy over the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 (Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;court-packing&quot; plan).

There were, in addition, strains between the more liberal New Deal supporters and the conservative wing of the Democratic party centered in the Southern states, which were exacerbated by an effort led by President Roosevelt to target certain conservative senators for defeat in Democratic primaries, including Walter George of Georgia, Millard Tydings of Maryland, Robert Rice Reynolds of North Carolina, and Ellison Smith of South Carolina. While a number of New Deal supporters won primary elections, such as Alben Barkley in Kentucky, who defeated Governor Happy Chandler, James P. Pope of Idaho, a prominent New Deal supporter, lost his bid for re-nomination, as did California&#x27;s William McAdoo — though McAdoo&#x27;s Democratic opponent, Sheridan Downey, had campaigned as a liberal New Dealer on many issues who would also do more to improve pension plans.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt had faced opposition from conservative Democrats and the Republicans in Congress since the beginning of his presidency. Josiah Bailey, Edward R. Burke, Harry F. Byrd, James F. Byrnes, Walter F. George, Peter G. Gerry, Carter Glass, Pat Harrison, Rush Holt Sr., Kenneth McKellar, and Ellison D. Smith were the conservative Democratic senators that opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s policies although Harrison, Burke, Byrnes, and McKellar had initially supported the First New Deal. Vice President John Nance Garner pushed for Roosevelt to support more conservative policies. The Republicans gained eight seats in the Senate while the Democrats maintained their majority. However, there were around twenty unreliable Democratic votes for Roosevelt which allowed conservatives to block some of his policies.

== Gains, losses, and holds ==
===Retirements===
One Democrat retired instead of seeking re-election, one Democrat retired instead of seeking election to finish the unexpired term and one Democrat retired instead of seeking election to finish the unexpired term and election to a full term.

===Defeats===
Seven Democrats sought re-election but lost in the primary or general election. One Democrat sought election to a full term but lost in the primary election and one Democrat sought election to finish the unexpired term but lost in the primary election.

===Death===
One Democrat died on June 17, 1938, and his seat remained vacant until the election.

<text>Tsumeb (; ) is a city of around 35,000 inhabitants and the largest town in the Oshikoto region in northern Namibia. 

Tsumeb, since its founding in 1905, has been primarily a mining town. The town is the site of a deep mine (the lower workings now closed) whose ore deposits with respect to variety, rarity and aesthetics of minerals have been listed among 100 geological heritage sites around the world by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS).

==History==
The town was founded in 1905 by German colonial power and celebrated its 100th year of existence in 2005.

The name Tsumeb is generally pronounced &quot;SOO-meb&quot;. The name is not a derivative of German, Afrikaans, or English. It has been suggested that it comes from Nama and means either &quot;Place of the moss&quot; or &quot;Place of the frog&quot;. Perhaps this old name had something to do with the huge natural hill of green, oxidized copper ore that existed there before it was mined out.

==Geography==
Tsumeb is known as the &quot;gateway to the north&quot; of Namibia. It is the closest town to the Etosha National Park. The largest meteorite in the world, called Hoba, lies in a field about forty minutes&#x27; drive to the southeast of Tsumeb, at Hoba West. It is a nickel-iron meteorite of about 60 tonnes.

=== Minerals ===
Tsumeb is notable for the huge mineralized pipe that led to its foundation. The origin of the pipe has been hotly debated. The pipe penetrates more or less vertically through the Precambrian Otavi dolomite for at least 1,300 m. One possibility is that the pipe was actually a gigantic ancient cave system and that the rock filling it is sand that seeped in from above. If the pipe is volcanic, as some have suggested, then the rock filling it (the &quot;pseudo-aplite&quot;) is peculiar in the extreme. The pipe was mined in prehistoric times but those ancient workers barely scratched the surface. Most of the ore was removed in the 20th century by cut-and-fill methods. The ore was polymetallic and from it copper, lead, silver, gold, arsenic and germanium were won. There was also a fair amount of zinc present but the recovery of this metal was always difficult for technical reasons. Many millions of tonnes of ore of spectacular grade were removed. A good percentage of the ore (called &quot;direct smelting ore&quot;) was so rich that it was sent straight to the smelter situated near the town without having to be processed through the mineral enrichment plant. The Tsumeb mine is also renowned amongst mineral collectors. Tsumeb belongs to the world&#x27;s most prolific mineralogical sites. The minerals from Tsumeb are unsurpassed in variety and quality of form.

At least 170 mineral species have been cataloged and 20 of these are found nowhere else. The concentration of ingredients for Tsumeb&#x27;s mineral formations originates in a sulfide deposit rich in many metals. A non-arid environment plentiful in oxygen-rich groundwater contributed to leaching and re-deposition of these elements as new minerals, sometimes in crystalline formations. There are rare secondary minerals of Pb, Cu, Zn, As, Sb and, reflecting the ore deposit chemistry, Ge, Ga and Cd as well. Minerals first described from Tsumeb include, according to Mindat.org:
* rare (but also a few common) arsenates: andyrobertsite, arsenbrackebuschite, arsendescloizite, arsentsumebite, biehlite, calcioandyrobertsite, chudobaite, duftite, ekatite, fahleite, feinglosite, ferrilotharmeyerite, gaitite, gebhardite, gerdtremmelite, helmutwinklerite, jamesite, johillerite, keyite, koritnigite, leiteite, ludlockite, lukrahnite, molybdofornacite, o&#x27;danielite, prosperite, reinerite, schneiderhöhnite, schultenite, sewardite, stranskiite, thometzekite, tsumcorite, warikahnite, wilhelmkleinite, zincgartrellite and zincroselite
* unique germanium (bartelkeite, calvertite, eyselite, fleischerite, germanite, itoite, krieselite (germanate topaz), mathewrogersite, otjisumeite, ovamboite, schaurteite and stottite) and gallium (gallobeudantite, söhngeite, tsumgallite) minerals
* others are: kegelite, minrecordite, otavite, plumbotsumite, queitite, sidpietersite (unique thiosulphate), stibioclaudetite, tsumebite and zincrosasite.

&lt;br&gt;
In respect of it being &#x27;one of the richest ore deposits with respect to variety, rarity and aesthetics of minerals in the world&#x27;, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included the &#x27;Tsumeb Ore Deposit&#x27; in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &#x27;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&#x27;

===Sinkhole lakes===

Near the town are two large sinkhole lakes, Lake Otjikoto and Lake Guinas (&quot;Gwee-nus&quot;). Guinas, at about 500 m in diameter, is somewhat larger in area than Otjikoto. A pioneering documentary movie about scuba diving in these lakes was made by Graham Ferreira in the early 1970s. The depths of the lakes are unknown, because towards the bottom both lakes disappear into lateral cave systems, so it is not possible to use a weight to sound them. Otjikoto, which has poor visibility (owing to pollution from agricultural fertilizers used nearby), is at least 60 m deep. The water in Guinas is completely clear and well over 100 m deep. Divers who have performed bounce-dives in Guinas to 80 m (strictly speaking, beyond the safe depth for such dives, especially given the altitude of the lake above sea level) have reported that there was nothing but powdery-blue water below them. Guinas has been in existence for so long that a unique species of fish, &quot;Tilapia guinasana&quot;, has evolved in its waters.

When South Africa invaded German Southwest Africa, today&#x27;s Namibia, in 1914, the retreating German forces eventually threw all of their weaponry and supplies into the deep waters of Otjikoto. Some of the material has been recovered for display in museums.

One of the largest and deepest underground lakes in the world lies a little to the east of Tsumeb, on farm called &quot;Harasib&quot;. To reach the water in the cave one has either to abseil or to descend an ancient, hand-forged ladder that hangs free of the vertical dolomite walls of the cave for over 50 m. Here, too, scuba divers have descended as deep as they have dared (80 m) in the crystal-clear waters and have reported nothing but deep blue below them from one ledge of dolomite to the next with nothing discernible in the depths.

===Climate===
Tsumeb has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;), with hot summers and mild winters (with warm days and chilly nights). The average annual precipitation is .

== Economy and infrastructure ==
There are 105 commercial farms around Tsumeb. The area consists largely of rolling hills covered in thorn bush. Tsumeb falls under the dry woodland, savanna vegetation zone. Much of farmland is affected by woody plant encroachment. The soil around Tsumeb varies in quality from very fertile red loam through black turf to chalky clay and loam. The district is thus suitable for intensified farming and crop production. There is an abundance of ground water and regular rainfall in the summer months. Irrigation makes the area even more productive. Farmers in the area grow citrus fruits with much success. The main crops grown are maize, sorghum and sunflowers. Cattle farming is also widespread.

Ohorongo Cement was established in 2007. The plant is situated between Tsumeb and Otavi on Farm Sargberg approximately 45 km south of Tsumeb. The plant has a production capacity of 650000 tonnes per annum, almost double the demand of the Namibian domestic market. It is owned by Schwenk KG. Limestone reserves appear to be adequate for approximately 300 years. Tsumeb has a concrete sleeper factory.

Just a few kilometres North of Tsumeb, the construction of the 40 MW Otjikoto Biomass Power Station began in 2024, with an expected completion in 2027.

Every year the Tsumeb Municipality organises the Tsumeb Copper Festival. More than 200 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and bigger exhibitors showcase their products and services at the annual fair. The festival takes place annually during the last weekend of October at the United Nations Park. The four-day event, which is aimed at boosting the economic competitiveness of the town, draws crowds from all corners of the country and beyond. It also facilitates indirect investments in the hospitality sector.

The Evaristus Shikongo Correctional Facility in Tsumeb is one of Namibia&#x27;s seven major prisons. Tsumeb&#x27;s stadium, the Oscar Norich Stadium, has a capacity of 1,500.

===Tsumeb mine===

Tsumeb, since its founding, has been primarily a mining town. The mine was originally owned by the OMEG (Otavi Minen- und Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) and later by TCL (Tsumeb Corporation Limited) before its closure a few years ago, when the ore at depth ran out. The main shafts became flooded by ground water over a kilometre deep and the water was collected and pumped as far as the capital, Windhoek. The mine has since been opened up again by a group of local entrepreneurs trading as Ongopolo Mining. A fair amount of oxidized ore remains to be recovered in the old upper levels of the mine. It is highly unlikely, though, that the deepest levels will ever be reopened.

Between 1905 and 1996, Tsumeb mine produced about 30 million tons of ore yielding 1.7 Mt copper, 2.8 Mt lead 0.9 Mt zinc, as well as 80 t germanium. The average ore grade was 10% Pb, 4.3% Cu, 3.5% Zn, 100 ppm Ag, 50 ppm Ge.

It is noted for 243 valid minerals and is the type location for 56 types of mineral. Some of the germanium minerals are only found in this mine.

From 1971 to 1972, the Tsumeb mine had its operations temporarily stopped during the 1971–72 Namibian contract workers strike over the contract labor system and apartheid.

The other notable feature of the town is the metal smelter, for a long time the biggest employer in town. Previously owned by Namibia Custom Smelters, it was sold by Weatherly International mining company to Dundee Corporation in 2010. Dundee mainly smelted copper ores from Bulgaria here. The right of the smelter is currently owned by IXM. 

The smelter operation has led to widespread soil contamination with arsenic and other heavy metals. Hair samples from the local population show &quot;that the population of Tsumeb is massively exposed to arsenic&quot;. It also impacted air quality negatively. The stockpile of arsenic waste has been deposited in a landfill. Its exact size is unknown but it is speculated to amount to 300,000t, one of the largest such accumulations in the world.

===Transport===
The main road leads north, to Ondangwa and onwards to Oshakati and Angola. To the north-east a newly constructed Bituminous Road towards Tsintsabis leads to Katwitwi Border Post and Angola. To the east, through Grootfontein, the road leads towards Rundu and Katima Mulilo and to the south, through Otavi to Otjiwarongo and Windhoek.

Tsumeb is connected to the national railway network operated by TransNamib. Tsumeb was for most of the 20th century the terminus of the line but in recent times the track has been extended a further 260 km to reach Ondangwa. There have been talks of extending the line to Oshikango and having the Government of Angola build a railroad from the north to connect the two countries together. The junction for the Ondangwa line is located at the &quot;wrong end&quot; of Tsumeb railway station, leaving it a dead end, though a second triangle is provided for through trains to bypass the station.

Tsumeb Airport is an airstrip east of town.

==Politics==
Tsumeb used to be the regional capital of Oshikoto until 2008, when Omuthiya was proclaimed a town and the new capital. The area around Tsumeb forms its own electoral constituency that has a population of 44,113.

The city of Tsumeb is governed by a municipal council that has seven seats. Nico Kaiyamo is one of the well-known and established local politicians.

In the 2010 local authority election, a total of 3,120 votes were cast in the city. SWAPO won with approximately 75% of the vote. Of the four other parties seeking seats, Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) received approximately 15% of the vote, followed by United Democratic Front (UDF, 5%), All People&#x27;s Party (APP, 2%), and the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, 2%) Despite being on the ballot, the Congress of Democrats (CoD) did not receive a vote. The 2015 local authority election was again won by SWAPO which gained six seats and 3,149 votes. The remaining seat went to the DTA which gained 291 votes.

The 2020 local authority election was also won by SWAPO which obtained 2,518 votes and gained four seats. The Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020, obtained 1,472 votes and gained two seats. The remaining seat went to the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM, the new name of the DTA) with 199 votes.

<doc id="1314921" wikidata="Q3569940" url="?curid=1314921" title="World's Biggest Bookstore">
<text>The World&#x27;s Biggest Bookstore was a bookstore in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, at 20 Edward St, just north of the Toronto Eaton Centre and the Atrium on Bay. Operating from 1980 until 2014, the three-storey store covered 64,000 square feet and was noted for its bright lights and over 20 kilometres of bookshelves.

==History==
The store was founded by Jack Cole and Carl Cole, the former owners of Coles Bookstore.

At the time of its opening in November 1980, in a converted building that had housed the Olympia bowling alley, it was unchallenged in its claim as the biggest bookstore in the world. Although it retained the name, the Guinness Book of World Records listed the Barnes &amp; Noble College Booksellers location on Fifth Avenue in New York City as the largest bookstore in the world based on floor space, although Powell&#x27;s Books of Portland, Oregon, is usually considered the largest based on shelf-space. Nevertheless, World&#x27;s Biggest Bookstore claimed the title on the basis that it carried the most titles. The Barnes &amp; Noble location closed in early 2014. On December 22, 2010, Maruzen and Junkodou Shoten opened a 73,000 square foot (6804 m2) bookstore in the Umeda district of Osaka, Japan, overtaking these other three in terms of floor space.
The store made a brief appearance in the movie &quot;Short Circuit 2&quot; when the main character, a robot named Johnny 5, enters the store and creates chaos as he reads through the books.

On June 20, 2012, it was reported that the lease on the store&#x27;s building, set to expire at the end of 2013, would not be renewed, and the store would close.

In November 2013 it was announced that the property at 20 Edward Street had been sold to Lifetime Developments, and the store would close in mid-February and vacate the building by April. In February 2014, a press release by Paracom Realty Corporation stated that the site would be redeveloped and leased to four restaurants designed by Turner Fleisher Architects. The closure date was revised to the end of March 2014. The bookstore closed for the last time on March 30, 2014. The structure was demolished in November 2014. The site was developed as Panda Condominiums with leasing for retail and office spaces. As of October, 2020 it was still under construction.

==Advertising==
In the late 1990s, with customers&#x27; book shopping habits radically changing after the launch of Chapters and Indigo, the store chose to play up its &quot;no frills&quot; image with an advertising campaign that included the following slogans:

* &quot;We occasionally have soft mood lighting. But then we replaced the burnt out fluorescent tubes.&quot;
* &quot;Like other bookstores, we have places to sit. But why aggravate your hemorrhoids?&quot;
* &quot;Books priced so low even people who don&#x27;t read too good is buying them.&quot;

These self-deprecating slogans are in the style of Toronto&#x27;s landmark bargain store, Honest Ed&#x27;s.

<doc id="1314925" wikidata="Q5104600" url="?curid=1314925" title="Chong Hing Bank">
<text>Chong Hing Bank is a bank founded in Hong Kong in 1948. It is headquartered in Central, while the back offices are located in Western District and Mong Kok. It was owned by the Liu family of Hong Kong until it was acquired by the Chinese state-owned Yue Xiu Group in 2014.

==History==
The bank was founded as Liu Chong Hing Bank in Hong Kong in 1948 by Liu Po-shan (廖寶珊), who migrated to Hong Kong from Chiuchow shortly before the Japanese occupation of the territory began in 1942. He entered the property business and subsequently banking in 1948, working from an office on Wing Lok Street in Western. In 1955 the company became a savings bank with branches.

It suffered a bank run for several days from 14 June 1961, which managing director Liu Po-sang blamed on &quot;malicious rumours by rivals&quot;. The rumours said that the bank was under police investigation. The panic partially subsided by 17 June 1961 after the Hong Kong Police affirmed that there was no such investigation and after the Chartered Bank and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation released a joint statement attesting to the bank&#x27;s integrity. Some of Liu&#x27;s sons – including Liu Lit-mo, Liu Lit-man, and Liu Lit-for – helped the bank weather the crisis. The elder Liu died on 23 July 1961 at the age of 61.

In 1972, the bank had nine branches and assets of HK$372 million. It had grown to 19 branches by 1978. Liu Chong Hing Bank was spun off from its parent Liu Chong Hing Investment in 1994. The Liu family is split up into three groups, each group under the main figures in the company.

From 1997 to 2007, COSCO Pacific was a minority shareholder (20%) of the bank. From 2007, the stake was owned by COSCO Pacific&#x27;s parent company, COSCO HK.

On 29 November 2006, the shareholders of the Liu Chong Hing Bank agreed to change the name of the bank to Chong Hing Bank Limited effective 23 December 2006, to decrease the family business image of the bank.

In 2013, it was announced that Chong Hing Bank would be acquired by the Chinese state-owned Yue Xiu Group, the investment arm of the Guangzhou municipal government. 

The acquisition was completed on 14 February 2014. Yue Xiu Financial Holdings Limited (wholly owned by Guangzhou Yue Xiu Holdings Limited) now owns 75 per cent of the Chong Hing Bank. The bank dropped its previous logo, a stylised red &quot;CH&quot;, which stood for Chong Hing. In its place it adopted the logo of Yue Xiu, a golden ligature of the letters &quot;YE&quot;, which stand for Yue Xiu Group and the word &quot;excellent&quot;, respectively.

Margaret Leung was replaced as CEO by Zong Jianxin (宗建新) on 19 April 2017.

In 2021, Chong Hing Bank was privatized and delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

==Branches==
The main branch is located on Des Voeux Road Central in Central, Hong Kong. As of March 2018, the bank has nine branches on Hong Kong Island, 16 in Kowloon, and 14 branches in the New Territories – bringing the total number of branches in Hong Kong to 39. It also has a small number of locations in China as well as an office in San Francisco.

<text>Schuyler ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Nelson County, Virginia, (Eastern United States), close to Scottsville and Charlottesville, Virginia. The population as of the 2010 U.S. D inecennial Census was 298.

In 1882, the community—originally called &quot;Walker&#x27;s Mill&quot;—was renamed for Schuyler George Walker, local mill operator, and the area&#x27;s first postmaster for the local post office branch of the old United States Post Office Department (today&#x27;s United States Postal Service after 1971).

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the community became a small industrial center with the establishment of a stone cutting plant for the area quarries of the Alberene Stone Company, which took the native and acid-resistant soapstone and cut, then milled the rock into flat slab table tops for medical labs, hospitals and high school science classrooms. The economic hardships of the Great Depression of the 1930s essentially destroyed this industry and the area never fully recovered.
Schuyler was also the birthplace and early home of screenwriter Earl Hamner Jr. (1923-2016). He is best known for the long-running Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS-TV) network&#x27;s television series &quot;The Waltons&quot;, which stories and scripts were based on his experiences of growing up the eldest child of a large rural family in Great Depression-era America of the 1930s and subsequent Second World War era of the early 1940s. The TV series during the 1970s was followed by six made-for-TV reunion films aired during the following 1980s and 1990s. Earl and his mother and siblings attended the local Schuyler Baptist Church near their homestead. In 2014, a special service was held there to honor Hamner on his last visit to the Appalachian Mountains / Allegheny Mountains / Blue Ridge Mountains chain of the Western Virginia region; Hamner died two years later. Famous Country music singer Jimmy Fortune (born 1955) of nearby Nelson County, Virginia, participated in the event.

The region suffered greatly from the remnants of Hurricane Camille, which dumped to of rain, flooding the upper mountain creeks and streams devastating the area in August 1969.

The Schuyler Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (lists maintained by the National Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior) in 2007.

<text>Myles Falls Horton (July 9, 1905– January 19, 1990) was an American educator, socialist, and co-founder of the Highlander Folk School, famous for its role in the Civil Rights Movement (Movement leader James Bevel called Horton &quot;The Father of the Civil Rights Movement&quot;). Horton taught and heavily influenced most of the era&#x27;s leaders. They included Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks (who studied with Horton shortly before her decision to keep her seat on the Montgomery, Alabama, bus in 1955), John Lewis, James Bevel, Bernard Lafayette, and others who would create the Nashville Student Movement, Ralph Abernathy, John B. Thompson, and many others.

==Highlander co-founder==

A poor white man from Savannah in West Tennessee, Horton&#x27;s social and political views were strongly influenced by theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, under whom he studied at the Union Theological Seminary in New York City. Along with educator Don West and Methodist minister James A. Dombrowski of New Orleans, Horton founded the Highlander Folk School (now Highlander Research and Education Center) in Monteagle in his native Tennessee in 1932. He remained its director until 1973, traveling with it to reorganize in Knoxville after the state of Tennessee shut it down in 1961.

Horton and West had both traveled to Denmark to study its folk schools, centers for adult education and community empowerment. The resulting school in Monteagle, Tennessee was based on a concept originating in Denmark: &quot;that an oppressed people collectively hold strategies for liberation that are lost to its individuals . . . The Highlander School had been a haven for the South&#x27;s handful of functional radicals during the thirties and the essential alma mater for the leaders of the CIO&#x27;s fledgling southern organizing drives.&quot; (McWhorter) The school was created to educate and empower adults for social change.

The term “communist” was applied to Horton&#x27;s teachings and the Highlander School because of the school&#x27;s philosophy of bringing whites and blacks together, in violation of segregation laws. The school advocated for the working class and the poor and the school&#x27;s teachings focused on heightening activism. Rosa Parks was heavily influenced by Myles Horton and the Highlander School. Just prior to her famous refusal to give up her seat on a bus, Parks visited the Highlander School where she found the “courage to feel we were alone.”(Highlander School 1).

Horton was influenced early on by his work with poor mountain people in Ozone, Tennessee. From them, he learned that a free discussion of problems, without indoctrination to any preconceived ideas, generated vitality and brought out ideas from within the group. He wanted blacks and whites to meet and improve their lives. Horton envisioned a place for liberals and Southern radicals to come together. He applied this concept to the Highlander School in order to create an atmosphere for social change (Ayers 1091).

Horton&#x27;s quest to create and maintain the Highlander School was opposed by Southern law enforcement. In 1959, the school was accused of violating segregation and selling alcohol. Adults at the school were allowed to leave coins when they took beer out of the refrigerator at the school. The school was convicted and shut down. Horton immediately applied for a new charter and reopened the school (Highlander School 2).

Today the Highlander focuses on the social consequences related to environmental problems.
Horton was also heavily influenced by his religious background. He believed in a society where there was justice for all. He attended the radical Union Theological Seminary and joined the Social Gospel Movement. The Social Gospel movement believed that if Christianity&#x27;s principles were applied to social problems, there could be a heaven on earth (Braden 26).

In their 1985 documentary &quot;You Got to Move&quot;, Lucy Massie Phenix and Veronica Selver prominently featured Horton and the Highlander School. Horton also inspired the founding of the Myles Horton Organization at the University of Tennessee in 1986. The group organized numerous protests and events in the Chattanooga, Tennessee area, including demonstrations to counter the Ku Klux Klan, and the construction of a shantytown on campus to encourage the university to divest from South Africa.

==Personal life and education==

Myles Horton was born in 1905 in Savannah, Tennessee to a poor family. He had two brothers, Daniel and Demas, and one sister, Elsie Pearl. He grew up near Savannah, Tennessee. His parents were Elsie Falls Horton and Perry Horton (Hale 1).

His parents were former school teachers and Presbyterians. His father was a Workers’ Alliance member and his mother served as a respected and socially active community member. Before the birth of their children, Elsie and Perry Horton worked as educators. When standards for being an educator changed (they now required at least one year of high school), they both lost their jobs because neither of them had the required education. After that, they worked several odd jobs, one of which was working in factories as sharecroppers. Myles’ parents were good, peace-loving people who tried to raise their kids as respectful, affectionate and devoted people. They grew up in poverty, but never thought of themselves as lower class. Elsie Falls Horton helped to organize classes for less fortunate people, and tried to have them become more educated people of the community (Brooks 405).

Horton sought to continue his education. He left home at the young age of fifteen to attend high school and supported himself through working in a sawmill and then a box factory. Horton learned the value of hard work through working these jobs. He attended many colleges, including Cumberland University (graduating with his undergraduate degree in 1928), the University of Chicago and the Union Theological Seminary (Brooks 407).

During his teenage years, Horton experienced union organization by holding jobs at a sawmill and as a packer at factories. As a teenager, he demonstrated his activism by holding a strike for higher wages at the tomato factory. Horton attended Cumberland University in Tennessee in 1924 and continued his work with local unions. After college, Horton went to work as a state Student YMCA secretary.[2] In 1929, Horton became familiar with social gospel philosophy while studying in New York City at the Union Theological Seminary. He wanted to find a way in which the social condition could be challenged and changed and education became his nonviolent instrument. At the University of Chicago, Horton learned about the Danish folk high schools. Inspired after his visit to these schools, Horton helped established his own education center, Highlander Folk School, in Monteagle, Tennessee in 1932.[3] He later married Zilphia Mae Johnson in 1935. Zilphia Horton was a constant collaborator with Horton until her death in 1956. Zilphia and Myles Horton had two children. In 1962, Myles Horton married Aimee Isgrig. In January 1990, Myles Horton died at the age of 84 (Ayers 1091).

<doc id="1314942" wikidata="Q358792" url="?curid=1314942" title="Administrative distance">
<text>Administrative distance (AD) or route preference is a number of arbitrary unit assigned to dynamic routes, static routes and directly-connected routes. The value is used in routers to rank routes from most preferred (low AD value) to least preferred (high AD value). When multiple paths to the same destination are available in its routing table, the router uses the route with the lowest administrative distance.

Router vendors typically design their routers to assign a default administrative distance to each kind of route. For example, on Cisco routers, routes issued by the Open Shortest Path First routing protocol have a lower default administrative distance than routes issued by the Routing Information Protocol. This is because, by default on Cisco routers, OSPF has a default administrative distance of 110 and RIP has a default administrative distance of 120. Administrative distance values can, however, usually be adjusted manually by a network administrator.

== Overview ==
The administrative distance (AD) value is assigned by the router on a per-protocol basis. Routers, by design, should not install multiple routes into the routing table as this has the potential to cause routing loops. While a router may run multiple routing protocols on the same device, it is necessary for the router to implement a process to ensure that multiple routes, pointing to the same destination do not simultaneously exist in the routing table. Each process running on a router advertises its administrative distance value to the local router. The router uses this value to determine which route should be used. Once a route has been selected, the routing information database is updated. If two routes have the same administrative distance, the router uses its vendor-specific algorithm to determine which route should be installed. Cisco routers simply ignore the values and fall back to the default values, which are never the same.

The router will usually compare administrative distances to determine which protocol has the lowest value. The router prefers protocols that have a lower assigned administrative distance. For example, OSPF has a default distance of 110, so it is preferred by the router process, over RIP, which has a default distance of 120. The administrator can arbitrarily reconfigure the administrative distances, which affects the ranking of the preferred routes by the routing process. On Cisco routers, static routes have an administrative distance of 1, making them preferred over routes issued by a dynamic routing protocol. The administrative distance is a value that is always only referenced by the local router itself. The administrative distance is not advertised on the network.

== Default administrative distances ==

=== Cisco ===
The following table lists the default administrative distances for various routing protocols used on Cisco routers.

=== Juniper ===
The following table lists the default administrative distances for various routing protocols used on Juniper routers.

=== Extreme Networks ===

The following table lists the default administrative distances used on ExtremeXOS / Switch-Engine.

The following table lists the default administrative distances used on Extreme VOSS / Fabric-Engine.

=== FortiGate ===
The following table lists the default administrative distances for various routing protocols used on Fortinet FortiGate routers.

== Configuration ==

=== Cisco IOS ===
The network administrator may modify the administrative distance to change the desired ranking of router protocols. This may be necessary in cases where routing redistribution has to be used, otherwise, routing loops could occur. The Cisco Internetwork Operating System enables network administrators to modify the distance by changing the distance value in sub-router configuration mode. In the example below, RIP&#x27;s administrative distance is changed to 89 so that it used in preference to OSPF.
R1#enable

R1#configure terminal

R1(config)#router rip

R1(config-router)#distance 89
Manually configuring the administrative distance is also required when configuring a floating static route. Floating static routes are used to provide an alternate path when a primary link fails. In order for static routes to be configured as a backup, the static route&#x27;s administrative distance would need to be adjusted. Otherwise, it will take precedence over all routing protocols and routes issued from a routing protocol will not be inserted into the routing table. The example below shows how to configure the administrative distance to 254 to specify that it should only be used as a last resort.

codice_1

In the event that two routing protocols are configured with the same administrative distance, the Cisco router will ignore the configured values and instead use the default values.

Verifying the configuration of the administrative distance is done on Cisco equipment using the &quot;show ip route&quot; command in privileged exec mode on the console of the Cisco router. In the example shown below, the administrative distance is 1. The letter &quot;S&quot; indicates that the route is a static route that has, for all intents and purposes, been added manually to the router process by the administrator and installed into the routing table.
Router#enable

Router#configure terminal

Router(config)#ip route 1.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 fastEthernet 0/0

Router(config)#do show ip route
The &quot;do show ip route&quot; command will display the following, confirming that a static route has an administrative distance of 1.

codice_2
