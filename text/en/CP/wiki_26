<text>Subvocalization, or silent speech, is the internal speech typically made when reading; it provides the sound of the word as it is read. This is a natural process when reading, and it helps the mind to access meanings to comprehend and remember what is read, potentially reducing cognitive load.

This inner speech is characterized by minuscule movements in the larynx and other muscles involved in the articulation of speech. Most of these movements are undetectable (without the aid of machines) by the person who is reading. It is one of the components of Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch&#x27;s phonological loop proposal which accounts for the storage of these types of information into short-term memory.

==History of subvocalization research==
Subvocalization has been considered as far back as 1868. Only in 1899 did an experiment take place to record movement of the larynx through silent reading by a researcher named H.S. Curtis, who concluded that silent reading was the only mental activity that created considerable movement of the larynx.
In 1950 Edfelt reached a breakthrough when he created an electrically powered instrument that can record movement. He concluded that newer techniques are needed to accurately record information and that efforts should be made to understand this phenomenon instead of eliminating it. After failed attempts trying to reduce silent speech in study participants, in 1952, it came to the conclusion that silent speech is a developmental activity which reinforces learning and should not be disrupted during development. In 1960, Edfelt seconded this opinion.

==Techniques for studying subvocalization==
Subvocalization is commonly studied using electromyography (EMG) recordings, concurrent speaking tasks, shadowing, and other techniques.

EMG can be used to show the degree to which one is subvocalizing or to train subvocalization suppression. EMG is used to record the electrical activity produced by the articulatory muscles involved in subvocalization. Greater electrical activity suggests a stronger use of subvocalization. In the case of suppression training, the trainee is shown their own EMG recordings while attempting to decrease the movement of the articulatory muscles. The EMG recordings allows one to monitor and ideally reduce subvocalization.

In concurrent speaking tasks, participants of a study are asked to complete an activity specific to the experiment while simultaneously repeating an irrelevant word. For example, one may be asked to read a paragraph while reciting the word &quot;cola&quot; over and over again. Speaking the repeated irrelevant word is thought to preoccupy the articulators used in subvocalization. Subvocalization, therefore, cannot be used in the mental processing of the activity being studied. Participants who had undergone the concurrent speaking task are often compared to other participants of the study who had completed the same activity without subvocalization interference. If performance on the activity is significantly less for those in the concurrent speaking task group than for those in the non-interference group, subvocalization is believed to play a role in the mental processing of that activity. The participants in the non-interference comparison group usually also complete a different, yet equally distracting task that does not involve the articulator muscles (i.e. tapping). This ensures that the difference in performance between the two groups is in fact due to subvocalization disturbances and not due to considerations such as task difficulty or a divide in attention.

Shadowing is conceptually similar to concurrent speaking tasks. Instead of repeating an irrelevant word, shadowing requires participants to listen to a list of words and to repeat those words as fast as possible while completing a separate task being studied by experimenters.

Techniques for subvocalization interference may also include counting, chewing or locking one&#x27;s jaw while placing the tongue on the roof of one&#x27;s mouth.

Subvocal recognition involves monitoring actual movements of the tongue and vocal cords that can be interpreted by electromagnetic sensors. Through the use of electrodes and nanocircuitry, synthetic telepathy could be achieved allowing people to communicate silently.

==Evolutionary background==
The exploration into the evolutionary background of subvocalization is currently very limited. The little known is predominantly about language acquisition and memory. Evolutionary psychologists suggest that the development of subvocalization is related to modular aspects of the brain. There has been a great amount of exploration on the evolutionary basis of universal grammar. The idea is that although the specific language one initially learns is dependent on one&#x27;s culture, all languages are learned through the activation of universal &quot;language modules&quot; that are present in each of us. This concept of a modular mind is a prevalent idea that will help explore memory and its relation to language more clearly, and possibly illuminate the evolutionary basis of subvocalization. Evidence for the mind having modules for superior function is the example that hours may be spent toiling over a car engine in an attempt to flexibly formulate a solution, but, in contrast, extremely long and complex sentences can be comprehended, understood, related and responded to in seconds. The specific inquiry into subvocalization may be minimal right now but there remains much to investigate in regard to the modular mind.

==Associated brain structures and processes==
The brain mechanics of subvocalization are still not well understood. It is safe to say that more than one part of the brain is used, and that no single test can reveal all the relevant processes. Studies often use event-related potentials; brief changes in an EEG (electroencephalography) to show brain activation, or fMRIs.

Subvocalization is related to inner speech; when inner speech is used, there is bilateral activation in predominantly the left frontal lobe. This activation could suggest that the frontal lobes may be involved in motor planning for speech output.

Subvocal rehearsal is controlled by top-down processing; conceptually driven, it relies on information already in memory. There is evidence for significant left hemisphere activation in the inferior and middle frontal gyri and inferior parietal gyrus during subvocal rehearsal. Broca&#x27;s area has also been found to have activation in other studies exploring subvocal rehearsal.

Silent speech-reading and silent counting are also examined when experimenters look at subvocalization. These tasks show activation in the frontal cortices, hippocampus and the thalamus for silent counting. Silent-reading activates similar areas of the auditory cortex that are involved in listening.
Finally, the phonological loop; proposed by Baddeley and Hitch as &quot;being responsible for temporary storage of speech-like information&quot; is an active subvocal rehearsal mechanism, activation originating mostly in the left hemispheric speech areas: Broca&#x27;s, lateral and medial premotor cortices and the cerebellum.

==Role of subvocalization in memory processes==
===The phonological loop and rehearsal===
The ability to store verbal material in working memory, and the storage of verbal material in short-term memory relies on a phonological loop. This loop, proposed by Baddeley and Hitch, represents a system that is composed of a short-term store in which memory is represented phonologically, and a rehearsal process. This rehearsal preserves and refreshes the material by re-enacting it and re-presenting it to short-term storage, and subvocalization is a major component of this rehearsal. The phonological loop system features an interaction between subvocal rehearsal and specific storage for phonological material. The phonological loop contributes to the study of the role of subvocalization and the inner voice in auditory imagery. Subvocalization and the phonological loop interact in a non-dependent manner demonstrated by their differential requirements on different tasks. The role of subvocalization within the workings of memory processes is heavily reliant on its involvement with Baddeley&#x27;s proposed phonological loop.

===Working memory===
There have been findings that support a role of subvocalization in the mechanisms underlying working memory and the holding of information in an accessible and malleable state. Some forms of internal speech-like processing may function as a holding mechanism in immediate memory tasks. The working memory span is a behavioural measure of &quot;exceptional consistency&quot; and is a positive function of the rate of subvocalization. Experimental data has shown that this span size increases as the rate of subvocalization increases, and the time needed to subvocalize the number of items comprising a span is generally constant. fMRI data suggests that a sequence of five letters approaches the individual capacity for immediate recall that relies on subvocal rehearsal alone.

===Short-term memory===
The role of subvocal rehearsal is also seen in short-term memory. Research has confirmed that this form of rehearsal benefits some cognitive functioning. Subvocal movements that occur when people listen to or rehearse a series of speech sounds will help the subject to maintain the phonemic representation of these sounds in their short-term memory, and this finding is supported by the fact that interfering with the overt production of speech sound did not disrupt the encoding of the sound&#x27;s features in short-term memory. This suggests a strong role played by subvocalization in the encoding of speech sounds into short-term memory. It has also been found that language differences in short-term memory performance in bilingual people is mediated, but not exclusively, by subvocal rehearsal.

The production of acoustic errors in short-term memory is also thought to be, in part, due to subvocalization. Individuals who stutter and therefore have a slower rate of subvocal articulation also demonstrate a short-term reproduction of serial material that is slower as compared to people who do not stutter.

===Encoding===
Subvocalization plays a large role in memory encoding. Subvocalization appears to facilitate the translating of visual linguistic information into acoustic information and vice versa. For example, subvocalization occurs when one sees a word and is asked to say it (see-say condition), or when one hears a word and is asked to write it (hear-write condition), but not when one is asked to see a word and then write it (see-write condition) or hear a word and then say it (hear-say condition). The see-say condition converts visual information into acoustic information. The hear-write condition converts acoustic information into visual information. The see-write and hear-say conditions, however, remain in the same sensory domain and do not require translation into a different type of code.

This is also supported by findings that suggest that subvocalization is not required for the encoding of speech, as words being heard are already in acoustic form and therefore enter short-term memory directly without use of subvocal articulation. Furthermore, subvocalization interference impedes reading comprehension but not listening comprehension.

==Role in reading comprehension==
Subvocalization&#x27;s role in reading comprehension can be viewed as a function of task complexity. Subvocalization is involved minimally or not at all in immediate comprehension. For example, subvocalization is not used in the making of homophone judgements but is used more for the comprehension of sentences and even more still for the comprehension of paragraphs. Subvocalization which translates visual reading information into a more durable and flexible acoustic code is thought to allow for the integration of past concepts with those currently being processed.

==Comparison to speed reading==
Advocates of speed reading generally claim that subvocalization places extra burden on the cognitive resources, thus slowing the reading down. Speedreading courses often prescribe lengthy practices to eliminate subvocalizing when reading. Normal reading instructors often simply apply remedial teaching to a reader who subvocalizes to the degree that they make visible movements on the lips, jaw, or throat.

Furthermore, fMRI studies comparing fast and slow readers (during a reading task) indicate that between the two groups there are significant differences in the brain areas being activated. In particular, it was found that rapid readers show lower activation in the brain regions associated with speech, which indicates that the higher speeds were attained, in part, by the reduction in subvocalization.

At the slower rates (memorizing, learning, and reading for comprehension), subvocalizing by the reader is very detectable. At the faster rates of reading (skimming and scanning), subvocalization is less detectable. For competent readers, subvocalizing to some extent even at scanning rates is normal.

Typically, subvocalizing is an inherent part of reading and understanding a word. Micro-muscle tests suggest that full and permanent elimination of subvocalizing is impossible. This may originate in the way people learn to read by associating the sight of words with their spoken sounds. Sound associations for words are indelibly imprinted on the nervous system—even of deaf people, since they will have associated the word with the mechanism for causing the sound or a sign in a particular sign language.

At the slower reading rates (100–300 words per minute), subvocalizing may improve comprehension. Subvocalizing or actual vocalizing can indeed be of great help when one wants to learn a passage verbatim. This is because the person is repeating the information in an auditory way, as well as seeing the piece on the paper.

==Auditory imagery==
The definition of auditory imagery is analogous to definitions used in other modalities of imagery (such as visual, auditory and olfactory imagery) in that it is, according to Intons-Peterson (1992), &quot;the introspective persistence of an auditory experience, including one constructed from components drawn from long-term memory, in the absence of direct sensory instigation of that experience.&quot;. Auditory imagery is often but not necessarily influenced by subvocalization, and has ties to the rehearsal process of working memory. The conception of working memory relies on a relationship between the &quot;inner ear&quot; and the &quot;inner voice&quot; (subvocalization), and this memory system is posited to be at the basis of auditory imagery. Subvocalization and the phonological store work in partnership in many auditory imagery tasks.

The extent to which an auditory image can influence detection, encoding and recall of a stimulus through its relationships to perception and memory has been documented. It has been suggested that auditory imagery may slow the decay of memory for pitch, as demonstrated by T. A. Keller, Cowan, and Saults (1995) who demonstrated that the prevention of rehearsal resulted in decreased memory performance for pitch comparison tasks through the introduction of distracting and competing stimuli. It has also been reported that auditory imagery for verbal material is impaired when subvocalization is blocked. These findings suggest that subvocalization is common to both auditory imagery and rehearsal.

In objection to a subvocalization mechanism basis for auditory imagery is in the fact that a significant amount of auditory imagery does not involve speech or stimuli similar to speech, such as music and environmental sounds. However, to combat this point, it has been suggested that rehearsal of non-speech sounds can indeed be carried out by the phonological mechanisms previously mentioned, even if the creation of nonspeech sounds within this mechanism is not possible.

==Role in speech==
There are two general types of individuals when it comes to subvocalization. There are Low-Vocalizers and High-Vocalizers. Using electromyography to record the muscle action potential of the larynx (i.e. muscle movement of the larynx), an individual is categorized under a high or low vocalizer depending on how much muscle movement the muscles in the larynx undergo during silent reading.

===Regulation of speech intensity===
Often in both high and low vocalizers, the rate of speech is constantly regulated depending on intensity/volume of words (said to be affected by long delays between readings) and increasing the delay of speech and hearing ones&#x27; voice is an effect called “delayed auditory feedback”. Increasing the voice intensity while reading was found to be higher in low-vocalizers than high-vocalizers. It is believed that because high-vocalizers have greater muscle movement of the larynx during silent reading, low-vocalizers read louder to compensate for this lack of movement so they can understand the material. When individuals undergo “feedback training”, where they are conscious of these muscle movements, this difference diminishes.

===Role in articulation===
Articulation during silent speech is important, though speech is not solely dependent on articulation alone. Impairing articulation can reduce sensory input from the muscle movements of the larynx to the brain to understand information being read and it also impairs ongoing speech production during reading to direct thinking. Words that are of high similarity minimize articulation, causing interference, and may reduce subvocal rehearsal. As articulation of similar words is affecting subvocalization, there is an increase in acoustic errors for short-term memory and recall.

Impairing or suppressing articulation causes a greater impact on performance. An example of articulation suppression is repeating the same word over many times such as &quot;&#x27;the&quot;&#x27; and attempting to memorise other words into short-term memory. Even though primary cues may be given for these words in attempt to retrieve them, words will either be recalled for the incorrect cue or will not be recalled at all.

==Schizophrenia and subvocalization==
People with schizophrenia known to experience auditory hallucinations could show the result of over-activation of the muscles in the larynx. Using an electromyography to record muscle movement, individuals experiencing hallucinations showed greater muscle activation before these hallucinations occurred. However, this muscle activation is not easily detected which means the muscle movement must be measured on a wider range. Though a wider range is needed to detect the muscle movement, it is still considered as subvocalization. Much more research is needed to link subvocalization with hallucination but many schizophrenics report &quot;hearing voices&quot; (as hallucinations) coming from their throat. This small fact could be a clue to finding if there is a true link between subvocalization and hallucinations, but it is very difficult to see this connection because not many patients experience hallucinations.

<text>Main Source was a Canadian-American East Coast hip hop group based in New York City/Toronto, composed of Toronto-born DJs and producers, K-Cut and Sir Scratch, as well as the New York City natives, DJ J.O.D and record producer Large Professor. Later, another Queens MC, Mikey D (Michael Deering), replaced Large Professor.

==History==
Main Source was founded in 1989. The group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Breaking Atoms&quot;, released in July 1991, featured tracks such as &quot;Looking at the Front Door&quot;, &quot;Just a Friendly Game of Baseball&quot;, and &quot;Watch Roger Do His Thing&quot;, as well as the first on-record appearance of Nas on &quot;Live at the Barbeque,&quot; which also featured Joe Fatal and Akinyele. Because of business differences, the group broke up before its second album, tentatively titled &quot;The Science&quot; could be released. However, Sir Scratch and K-Cut released a second album under the Main Source name titled &quot;Fuck What You Think&quot;, with new recruit Michael Deering aka Mikey D on vocals &amp; featured another first on-record appearance for The Dog Pack which would later become the Yonkers rap group The LOX on &quot;Set It Off&quot;; however, the album was shelved due to inner conflicts between Wild Pitch Records and group management., The singer Madonna sampled the bassline from &quot;What You Need&quot; on &quot;Fuck What You Think&quot; in her song &quot;Human Nature,&quot; which appeared on her 1994 album, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;.

Prior to Main Source, Mikey D was also one third of the Laurelton, Queens-based hip hop group Mikey D &amp; The L.A. Posse. The group also consisted of DJ Johnnie Quest and engineer/producer Paul C (who was also the mentor of Large Professor). In 1988, Mikey D was also the winner of the New Music Seminar battle for world supremacy. 

Large Professor went on to be an instrumental producer for hip hop stars such as Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Pete Rock &amp; CL Smooth, Nas, and Diamond D. He references his falling-out with Sir Scratch and K-Cut on A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s third album &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot;. On the track &quot;Keep It Rollin&#x27;&quot; he says, &quot;I&#x27;m Uptown chillin&#x27;, takin in this Grandmaster Vic blend/from the projects, the PJ&#x27;s, fuck them two DJ&#x27;s; Self mission.&quot;

K-Cut also produced for a wide range of hip hop artists including Big Pun, Maestro Fresh-Wes, Fu-Schnickens, Queen Latifah, and even NBA star Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. He also mentored another Toronto-based producer named Watts.

On December 22, 2002, at a concert in Toronto, the original members of Main Source performed together for the first time in nearly 10 years.

&quot;Breaking Atoms&quot; was named as one of two jury vote winners, alongside Buffy Sainte-Marie&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s My Way!&quot;, of the Polaris Heritage Prize at the 2020 Polaris Music Prize.

<doc id="1324749" wikidata="Q413152" url="?curid=1324749" title="Shaving cream">
<text>Shaving cream or shave cream is a category of cream cosmetics used for shaving preparation. The purpose of shaving cream is to soften the hair by providing lubrication. 

Different types of shaving creams include aerosol shaving cream (also known as shaving foam), latherless shaving cream (also called brushless shaving cream and non-aerosol shaving cream), and lather shaving cream or lathering shaving cream. The term &quot;shaving cream&quot; can also refer to the lather produced with a shaving brush from shaving soap or a lather shaving cream.

Shaving creams commonly consist of an emulsion of oils, soaps or surfactants, and water. In addition to soap, lather shaving creams include a humectant for softer consistency and keeping the lather moisturised. Brushless shaving creams, on the other hand, don&#x27;t contain soap and so don&#x27;t produce lather. They are an oil-in-water mixture to which humectants, wetting agents, and other ingredients are added. Aerosol shaving creams are basically lather shaving cream in liquid form with propellants, vegetable waxes, and various oils added.

== History ==

A rudimentary form of shaving cream was documented in Sumer around . This substance combined wood alkali and animal fat and was applied to a beard as a shaving preparation.

Until the early 20th century, bars or sticks of hard shaving soap were used. Later, tubes containing compounds of oils and soft soap were sold. 

In 1919 Frank Shields, a former MIT professor developed the first shaving cream. The innovative product appeared on the American market under the name Barbasol and offered men an alternative to using a brush to work soap into lather. When it was first produced, Barbasol was filled and packaged entirely by hand in Indianapolis. The brand still exists and is currently available worldwide.

The first can of pressurized shaving cream was Rise shaving cream, introduced in 1949. By the following decade this format attained two-thirds of the American market. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were used as propellants until they were banned in the late 1990s for destroying the ozone layer. Gaseous hydrocarbons such as mixtures of pentane, propane, butane and isobutane took their place.

In the 1970s, shaving gel was developed. In 1993, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company patented a post-foaming gel composition, which turns the gel into a foam after application to the skin, combining properties of both foams and gels.

Shaving creams and soaps are available as solids (bars); creams, generally in tubes; or aerosols. All forms may be applied with a shaving brush.

Shaving creams contain 20–30% soap [potassium or triethanolamine (TEA)], up to about 10% glycerine, emollients, emulsifiers, and foaming agents. Aerosols are diluted creams dispensed from pressurized cans with the aid of hydrocarbon propellants (up to about 10%). The flammability of the hydrocarbons is offset by the large amounts of water in cream formulations.

Beard-softening is due to hair hydration, which also depends on pH. In electric or dry shaving, swelling of the hairs is not desired, and such preparations use high amounts of alcohol (50–80%) to dry the skin and stiffen the hairs.

<doc id="1324761" wikidata="Q6928447" url="?curid=1324761" title="Mr. Bingle">
<text>Mr. Bingle is a fictional character marketed and sold by department store Dillard&#x27;s during the holiday season. Originating as a mascot of the Maison Blanche department store in New Orleans, Louisiana, Mr. Bingle has become an important part of the popular culture of the Greater New Orleans area, and across the United States.

==History==
Mr. Bingle was originally conceived by Emile Alline, a window display manager of Maison Blanche, in 1947. Though conceived in 1947, Mr. Bingle was not introduced to the public until the Christmas season of 1948. Alline became aware that other department stores had mascots around Christmastime, particularly Marshall Field&#x27;s Uncle Mistletoe, and pitched the concept of a similar mascot to Maison Blanche executives Lewis and Herbert Schuartz as an advertising strategy. Originally referred to as &quot;Snow Doll&quot;, his name would quickly be changed to Mr. Bingle following a naming contest held among the employees of Maison Blanche, with the name being chosen by Lewis as it shared the initials of the store. Mr. Bingle and his home could both be abbreviated as &quot;M.B.&quot;, and Maison Blanche was often referred to by its initials long before the creation of Mr. Bingle. This naming similarity was used heavily in marketing the character, even being referenced in his iconic theme song. Before his formal introduction to the public, his design was revised to include his iconic hat and candy cane.

The rights to the character would shift along with its parent company, with the majority of the locations being bought out by Goudchaux&#x27;s, Inc. of Baton Rouge, owned by Hans and Josef Sternberg, and the company then operating as Goudchaux/Maison Blanche. Most of the Maison Blanche locations would be bought out by Dillard&#x27;s in 1998, and the rights to the character would shift to them as a result. As of 2024, Dillard&#x27;s continues to promote and sell merchandise of Mr. Bingle.

==Appearance==
The design of Mr. Bingle is that of an anthropomorphic snowman, meaning that, while he is a snowman, he possesses human-like limbs and similar body structure. His facial features are traditionally represented by small blue dots for his eyes and red for his nose, with a small black line for a mouth assuming he is depicted with one, constantly smiling. On his back are a pair of holly wings that allow him to fly, and the year of sale usually stitched on his left foot (a doll sold in 2020, for example, will have 2020 stitched on his foot). He also wears a sugar ice cream cone on his head as a hat, as well holding a peppermint candy cane in his right hand. Traditionally, he is not depicted wearing clothing, aside from a red ribbon with bells at the tips tied around his neck, but much of his merchandise features him wearing different shirts, differing in design based on the year he is sold. A tag featuring his story is usually attached to his wings or his opposite hand.

==Story==
Mr. Bingle was originally a regular snowman sitting near Santa&#x27;s sleigh, when Santa used his magical powers to make him his helper. He gained the ability to walk and talk, was given holly wings and eyes soon after, as well as his iconic hat and candy cane. Santa gave him the name &quot;Mr. Bingle&quot;, and he would help Santa from that day forward.

==Puppet shows==
Mr. Bingle became best known in puppet (or marionette) form at the Canal Street Maison Blanche, puppeteered by New York puppeteer Edwin &quot;Oscar&quot; Isentrout (who also played the voice of Mr. Bingle). He had previously done puppetry not far from the store, on Bourbon Street, where he would do shows with vaudeville marionettes performing striptease in-between performances from exotic dancers. Isentrout often travelled around the United States with a marionette troop before buying a bus ticket to New Orleans, although he maintained his nightclub engagement, making it hard to perform the puppet shows at Maison Blanche. He would seek the assistance of two teenagers named Ray Frederick and Harry J. Ory, who had achieved some local success with their own marionette act. The three created many characters that would accompany Mr. Bingle and Santa Claus, such as a bear aptly named &quot;Bingle Bear&quot; and a rabbit named &quot;Bingle Bunny&quot;, but neither would achieve the same level of success as the snowman. Isentrout portrayed Bingle as a childlike character, making him get into all sorts of hijinks and forcing Santa Claus to help him get out of whatever situation he was in. These puppet shows occurred each day for the few weeks leading up to Christmas for about 15 minutes at a time, and were a favorite of local children, with adults even coming by to watch the shows. Mr. Bingle would sometimes be forced to break the fourth wall and tell the adults to move so that the children could get a good look at the show. Mr. Bingle also appeared in musical radio and television commercials, many of which were fully animated. The puppet shows ended in 1985 when Isentrout died, and the character has remained silent ever since.

==Television show==
The character would appear on television on the New Orleans channel WDSU and Memphis channel WMCTV Channel 5, where he would be accompanied by real actors in his puppet form, similar to Sesame Street. This show would air from Thanksgiving to the night before Christmas. These shows were also broadcast on the radio and done live in the store windows.

==Merchandise==

=== Stuffed dolls ===

Mr. Bingle-related merchandise, especially plush toys, were sold by Maison Blanche and manufactured in the United States, by Character Novelty Co., starting in 1949. The character has undergone many design changes, with the earlier dolls having chrome eyes and red mittens, and later dolls switching to the traditional blue eyes with red and white mittens. Some dolls even have a black nose and eyes, although these were manufacturers defects and were ordered to be destroyed, with the remaining dolls becoming rare. Other manufacturers defects among the dolls include hats that veer too far in either direction and oddly placed facial features. With the rise of social media platforms such as Facebook, communities have been formed dedicated to the buying and reselling of the dolls, and many listings have appeared on sites such as eBay.

=== Papier-mâché figure ===
Mr. Bingle was also displayed as a large papier-mâché figure on the front of the flagship Maison Blanche store on Canal Street, first standing next to Santa Claus and later in a flying form. The flying figure was displayed at the Metairie, Louisiana Maison Blanche Store and later at a Dillard&#x27;s Metairie location when the Canal Street store was closed. By 2004 the Mr. Bingle figure was in such poor condition that it could not be displayed, although Dillard&#x27;s continued to market small replicas. This figure has since become the most iconic of all Mr. Bingles, with most of the non-plush toy merchandise featuring the character in the exact same pose as the papier-mâché figure. By 2011 the Mr. Bingle figure was again reported to be in need of repairs.

=== Novels ===
A 2004 novel entitled &quot;Saving Mr. Bingle&quot; became a local success in New Orleans and Memphis; proceeds from the book were later used to buy a gravestone for Isentrout&#x27;s unmarked grave at Hebrew Rest No. 3 Cemetery in New Orleans. When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in August 2005, a levee collapsed near the warehouse where Mr. Bingle was stored, and the neighboring buildings were destroyed but Mr. Bingle survived. Spurred by this discovery, funds were raised to refurbish the display and it became a centerpiece of the Christmas 2005 &quot;Celebration in the Oaks&quot; light display at New Orleans City Park.

==Outside of New Orleans==
Mr. Bingle also appeared in Memphis, Tennessee, at the department store Lowenstein&#x27;s, which was also owned by Mercantile Stores Mercantile acquired MB a few years before itself being acquired by Dillard&#x27;s. The Mercantile chain used Mr. Bingle in Christmas advertising nationwide at various regional department stores owned by Mercantile. As of November 2014, Mr. Bingle merchandise was still widely available.

==Legacy==
Mr. Bingle continues to be popular in New Orleans and across Louisiana, even outside of the Christmas period, with a dedicated community of followers who buy and resell merchandise of the character. The character of Mr. Bingle would also make appearances outside of the commercial setting for charitable purposes, visiting sick children at the Children&#x27;s Hospital of New Orleans.

<doc id="1324767" wikidata="Q508227" url="?curid=1324767" title="Royal Rife">
<text>Royal Raymond Rife (May 16, 1888 – August 5, 1971) was an American inventor and early exponent of high-magnification time-lapse cine-micrography.

Rife is known for his microscopes, which he claimed could observe live microorganisms with a magnification considered impossible for his time, and for an &quot;oscillating beam ray&quot; invention, which he thought could treat various ailments by &quot;devitalizing disease organisms&quot; using radio waves. Although he came to collaborate with scientists, doctors and inventors of the epoch, and his findings were published in newspapers and scientific journals like the Smithsonian Institution annual report of 1944, they were later rejected by the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Cancer Society (ACS) and mainstream science.

Rife&#x27;s supporters continue to claim that impulses of electromagnetic frequencies can disable cancerous cells and other microorganisms responsible for diseases. Most of these claims have no scientific research to back them up, and Rife machines are not approved for treatment by any health regulator. Multiple promoters have been convicted of health fraud and sent to prison.

== Life and work ==
Little reliable published information exists describing Rife&#x27;s life and work. In the 1930s, he made several optical compound microscopes and, using a movie camera, took time-lapse microscopy movies of microbes. He also built microscopes that included polarizers. Rife claimed magnifications of 17,000× or more for some of these microscopes.

A report published by the Smithsonian Institution described one of these microscopes as equipped for &quot;transmitted and monochromatic beam dark-field, polarized, and slit-ultra illumination, including also a special device for crystallography&quot;. It added that several doctors had attended a demonstration of another of Rife&#x27;s microscopes and had been impressed by its clarity and high magnification.

A distinctive feature of the microscopes, according to Rife and to other scientists who examined them, was a false-colour effect by which, when a microbe was illuminated by a particular wavelength of polarised monochromatic light, different for each type of microbe, the microbe and only the microbe would emit a distinctive colour of light (turquoise for typhoid bacteria, ruby red for &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot;, etc.), thus taking the place of staining and allowing otherwise difficult organisms to be plainly seen.

Some of the observations Rife claimed to have made with his microscopes are, however, contradicted by modern findings. For instance, he reported that under certain conditions typhoid bacteria changed into a much smaller form, and claimed that most cancerous tumours contained a microbe that had no less than five forms, one of which was indistinguishable from E. coli while another resembled a fungus.

Rife also reported that a &#x27;beam ray&#x27; device of his invention could destroy microbial pathogens. Rife claimed to have documented a &quot;Mortal Oscillatory Rate&quot; for various pathogenic organisms, and to be able to destroy the organisms by vibrating them using radio waves of this particular frequency. According to the &quot;San Diego Evening Tribune&quot; in 1938, Rife stopped short of claiming that he could cure cancer, but did argue that he could &quot;devitalize disease organisms&quot; in living tissue, &quot;with certain exceptions&quot;. In a 1931 profile, Rife warned against &quot;medical fakers&quot; who claim to cure disease using &quot;electrical &#x27;vibrations, stating that his work did not uphold such claims.

An obituary in the &quot;Daily Californian&quot; described his death at the age of 83 on August 5, 1971, stating that he died penniless and embittered by the failure of his devices to garner scientific acceptance. Rife blamed the scientific rejection of his claims on a conspiracy involving the American Medical Association (AMA), the Department of Public Health, and other elements of &quot;organized medicine&quot;, which had &quot;brainwashed and intimidated&quot; his colleagues.

== Health fraud after his death ==

Interest in Rife&#x27;s claims was revived in some alternative medical circles by the 1987 book by Barry Lynes, &quot;The Cancer Cure That Worked&quot;, which claimed that Rife had succeeded in curing cancer, but that his work was suppressed by a powerful conspiracy headed by the American Medical Association. 
The American Cancer Society (ACS) describes Lynes&#x27; claims as implausible, noting that the book was written &quot;in a style typical of conspiratorial theorists&quot;, and that Lynes &quot;... cites names, dates, events and places, giving the appearance of authenticity to a mixture of historical documents and speculations selectively spun into a web far too complex to permit verification by any thing short of an army of investigators with unlimited resources.&quot; 

After this book&#x27;s publication, a variety of devices bearing Rife&#x27;s name were marketed as cures for diverse diseases such as cancer and AIDS. Some used radio waves as in the original experiments, some used other methods such as a pulsed electric current or pulsed electromagnetic fields at the correct frequencies, or what the manufacturers believed to be the correct frequencies. An analysis by &quot;Electronics Australia&quot; found that one typical &#x27;Rife device&#x27; cost AU$105 for a rudimentary circuit that simply produced a tiny pulsed electrical current (at a single fixed frequency of about 40kHz). It consisted of a nine-volt battery, wiring, a switch, a standard 555 timer chip and two short lengths of copper tubing meant to act as handheld electrodes, delivering a current which the author estimated at 1 milliamp at most. Its design was, in fact, almost identical to the &quot;zapper&quot; device promoted by Hulda Clark, rather than having much in common with Rife&#x27;s original devices. He described this as &quot;the tip of an enormous iceberg&quot;, with a wide range of more elaborate devices also on sale from different suppliers, varying widely in design and ranging in price from AU$1,500 to AU$34,000. 

Such &#x27;Rife devices&#x27; have figured prominently in several cases of health fraud in the U.S., typically centered around the uselessness of the devices and the grandiose claims with which they are marketed. In a 1996 case, the marketers of a &#x27;Rife device&#x27; claiming to cure numerous diseases including cancer and AIDS were convicted of felony health fraud. The sentencing judge described them as &quot;target[ing] the most vulnerable people, including those suffering from terminal disease&quot; and providing false hope. In some cases cancer patients who ceased chemotherapy and instead used these devices have died. A Washington State couple Donald and Sharon Brandt, who operated a clandestine health-care clinic from their home in Mount Vernon based on Rife&#x27;s inventions were convicted for a short imprisonment period. Rife devices are currently classified as a subset of radionics devices, which are generally viewed as pseudomedicine by mainstream experts. In Australia, the use of Rife machines has been blamed for the deaths of cancer patients who might have been cured with conventional therapy. In 2002 John Bryon Krueger, who operated the Royal Rife Research Society, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for his role in a murder and also received a concurrent 30-month sentence for illegally selling Rife devices. In 2009 a U.S. court convicted James Folsom of 26 felony counts for sale of the Rife devices sold as &#x27;NatureTronics&#x27;, &#x27;AstroPulse&#x27;, &#x27;BioSolutions&#x27;, &#x27;Energy Wellness&#x27;, and &#x27;Global Wellness&#x27;.

== Legacy ==

In 1994, the American Cancer Society&#x27;s journal &quot;CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians&quot; criticized Rife&#x27;s methods and devices in an article titled &quot;Questionable Methods of Cancer Management: Electronic Devices&quot;. The ACS reported that Rife machines were being sold in a &quot;pyramid-like, multilevel marketing scheme&quot;. A key component in the marketing of Rife devices has been the claim, initially put forward by Rife himself, that the devices were being suppressed by an establishment conspiracy against cancer &quot;cures&quot;. Although &#x27;Rife devices&#x27; are not registered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and have been linked to deaths among cancer sufferers, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; reported that over 300 people attended the 2006 Rife International Health Conference in Seattle, where dozens of unregistered devices were sold.

Cancer Research UK, the world&#x27;s largest independent cancer research charity, has stated:

<doc id="1324768" wikidata="Q902988" url="?curid=1324768" title="Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy">
<text>The Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy is a Canadian Hockey League (CHL) trophy, awarded to the most valuable player in the annual Memorial Cup tournament. The trophy was first awarded in 1972 and won by Richard Brodeur of the Cornwall Royals. Taylor Hall won the award in 2009 and 2010 with the Windsor Spitfires making him the first repeat winner in the trophy&#x27;s history. Through the 2024 season, it has been won 22 times by players on a team representing the Western Hockey League (WHL), 15 by those from the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and 14 by players from the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL).

The Kamloops Blazers franchise has had the most MVPs at six: three as members of the Blazers, and three when the franchise was known as the New Westminster Bruins. The Cornwall Royals had three MVPs. Eight players have won the Smythe Trophy despite their team failing to win the Memorial Cup: Sam Steel (2018), Leon Draisaitl (2015), Danny Groulx (2002), Chris Madden (1998), Cameron Mann (1996), Sean McKenna (1982), Bart Hunter (1979), and Barry Smith (1975).

The trophy is named in honour of Stafford Smythe, the son of Conn Smythe. Stafford was part of a group that purchased controlling interest in the National Hockey League&#x27;s (NHL) Toronto Maple Leafs in 1961, and served as the president of the Toronto franchise and Maple Leaf Gardens for many years. The Smythe family donated the trophy to the CHL in 1972, shortly after his death.

<doc id="1324769" wikidata="Q481402" url="?curid=1324769" title="Charles Chanoine">
<text>Charles Sulpice Jules Chanoine (; 18 December 1835, Dijon, Côte-d&#x27;Or – 9 January 1915) was a French military officer who led the first French mission sent to Japan, between 1867 and 1868, and later served as Minister of War under the Third Republic.

== Life and career ==

Early in his career, he served as chief of the French troops in China during the Second Opium War (1856–1860). Later, from 1867 to 1868, he was posted to Japan as the commander of the First French Military Mission to Japan, sent to that country by Napoleon III at the request of the 14th &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Iemochi. Among the officers under his command in Japan was Jules Brunet, who would play a key role in the conflict between the Shogun and the restoration forces of the Meiji Emperor during the Boshin War.

Due to the involvement of the Mission in supporting the Shogun, Chanoine had to leave Japan with the majority of the other French advisors in October 1868, per orders of the new emperor Meiji. Those who chose to remain, led by Jules Brunet, sent letters of resignation from the French army before joining the forces of the Shogun. This was done apparently with Chanoine&#x27;s tacit agreement, as he covered up their departure for a period of several days. 

As Henri Brisson&#x27;s third Minister of War from September to October 1898, Chanoine, like his predecessors, Generals Cavaignac and Zurlinden, attempted to prevent a review of the Dreyfus case, against the wishes of the cabinet, which had already decided to support review. The indecision within the government caused by Chanoine&#x27;s actions, as well as the chaos on the streets caused by the anti-Dreyfusards, led to the fall of the government. 

During his Ministry, Chanoine named Jules Brunet, his former aide in Japan thirty years earlier, to the position of Chief of Staff of the French army (&quot;Chef d&#x27;Etat Major&quot;).

Chanoine had a son, Lt. Julien Chanoine, who played a role in the French conquest of Chad, in the Voulet–Chanoine Mission.

<doc id="1324771" wikidata="Q112130704" url="?curid=1324771" title="The Sound of Jazz">
<text>&quot;The Sound of Jazz&quot; is a 1957 edition of the CBS television series &quot;The Seven Lively Arts&quot; and was one of the first major programs featuring jazz to air on American network television.

==Overview==
The one-hour program aired on Sunday, December 8, 1957, live from CBS Studio 58, the Town Theater at 851 Ninth Avenue in New York City. The show was hosted by &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; media critic John Crosby, directed by Jack Smight, and produced by Robert Herridge. Jazz writers Nat Hentoff and Whitney Balliett were consultants.

&quot;The Sound of Jazz&quot; features performances by musicians from the swing era, including Count Basie, Lester Young, Ben Webster, Billie Holiday, Jo Jones, and Coleman Hawkins; Chicago-style players of the same era, such as Henry &quot;Red&quot; Allen, Vic Dickenson, and Pee Wee Russell; and modern jazz musicians such as Gerry Mulligan, Thelonious Monk, and Jimmy Giuffre. These players played separately but also joined to combine styles in one group, such as Red Allen&#x27;s group and the group backing Billie Holiday on &quot;Fine and Mellow&quot;. The show&#x27;s performance of &quot;Fine and Mellow&quot; reunited Holiday with her friend Lester Young for the final time. Jazz critic Nat Hentoff recalled that during rehearsals Holiday and Young kept to opposite sides of the room. Young was very weak, and Hentoff told him to skip the big band section of the show and that he could sit while performing in the group with Holiday.

During the performance of &quot;Fine and Mellow&quot;, Webster played the first solo. &quot;Then&quot;, Hentoff remembered:Lester got up, and he played the purest blues I have ever heard, and [he and Holiday] were looking at each other, their eyes were sort of interlocked, and she was sort of nodding and half–smiling. It was as if they were both remembering what had been—whatever that was. And in the control room we were all crying. When the show was over, they went their separate ways.Within two years, both Young and Holiday had died.

Noting that the cameras were employed as &quot;straight reportorial tools&quot;, Jack Gould observed in a review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;It was the art of video improvisation wedded to the art of musical improvisation; the effect was an hour of enormously creative and fresh TV.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes-Gould-1957/12/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The album version of &quot;The Sound of Jazz&quot; telecast is derived from a rehearsal (recorded on December 4) that preceded the telecast held at Columbia&#x27;s 30th Street studios) and is not the soundtrack. The album was released by Columbia in 1958. The recording does not include all of the performers present on the telecast (Mulligan refused to participate because no additional payment was involved) and includes several who were not on the show. Bassist Walter Page rehearsed and is featured on the album, but he collapsed on the way to the studio for the telecast.

<doc id="1324774" wikidata="Q120536" url="?curid=1324774" title="Technocracy movement">
<text>The Technocracy movement was a social movement active in the United States and Canada in the 1930s which favored technocracy as a system of government over representative democracy and concomitant partisan politics. Historians associate the movement with engineer Howard Scott&#x27;s Technical Alliance and Technocracy Incorporated prior to the internal factionalism that dissolved the latter organization during the Second World War. Technocracy was ultimately overshadowed by other proposals for dealing with the crisis of the Great Depression. The technocracy movement proposed replacing partisan politicians and business people with scientists and engineers who had the technical expertise to manage the economy. But the movement did not fully aspire to scientocracy.

The movement was committed to abstaining from all partisan politics and communist revolution. It gained strength in the 1930s, but in 1940, due to opposition to the Second World War, it was banned in Canada. The ban was lifted in 1943 when it was apparent that &quot;Technocracy Inc. was committed to the war effort, proposing a program of total conscription.&quot; The movement continued to expand during the remainder of the war and new sections were formed in Ontario and the Maritime Provinces.

The Technocracy movement survived into the 21st century and was continuing to publish a newsletter, maintain a website, and hold member meetings. The Technocracy, Inc. web site was later stating that it was under renovation, under new ownership, announcing a &quot;Transition Plan 2016&quot;, and an online meeting in April 2021. Smaller groups included the Technical Alliance, The New Machine, and the Utopian Society of America.

==Overview==
Technocracy advocates contended that price system-based forms of government and economy are structurally incapable of effective action, and promoted a society headed by technical experts, which they argued would be more rational and productive.

The coming of the Great Depression ushered in radically different ideas of social engineering, culminating in reforms introduced by the New Deal. By late 1932, various groups across the United States were calling themselves &quot;technocrats&quot; and proposing reforms.

By the mid-1930s, interest in the technocracy movement was declining. Some historians have attributed the decline of the technocracy movement to the rise of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. Historian William E. Akin rejects that thesis arguing instead that the movement declined in the mid-1930s as a result of the failure of its proponents to devise a &#x27;viable political theory for achieving change&#x27; (p. 111 &quot;Technocracy and the American Dream: The Technocrat Movement, 1900–1941&quot; by William E. Akin), although many technocrats in the United States were sympathetic to the electoral efforts of anti-New Deal third parties. One of the most widely circulated images in Technocracy Inc.’s promotional materials used the example of a streetcar to argue that engineering solutions will always succeed where legislation or fines fail to adequately deal with social problems. If passengers insist on riding on the car’s dangerous outer platform, the solution consists in designing cars without platforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost/outlook/2018/Wythoff&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The technocratic movement has its origins with the progressive engineers of the early twentieth century and the writings of Edward Bellamy, along with some of the later works of Thorstein Veblen such as &quot;The&quot; &quot;Engineers And The Price System&quot; written in 1921. William H. Smyth, a California engineer, invented the word &quot;technocracy&quot; in 1919 to describe &quot;the rule of the people made effective through the agency of their servants, the scientists and engineers&quot;, and in the 1920s it was used to describe the works of Thorstein Veblen.

Early technocratic organizations formed after the First World War. These included Henry Gantt’s &quot;The New Machine&quot; and Veblen’s &quot;Soviet of Technicians&quot;. These organizations folded after a short time. Writers such as Henry Gantt, Thorstein Veblen, and Howard Scott suggested that businesspeople were incapable of reforming their industries in the public interest and that control of industry should thus be given to engineers.

==United States and Canada==

Howard Scott has been called the &quot;founder of the technocracy movement&quot; and he started the Technical Alliance in New York near the end of 1919. Members of the Alliance were mostly scientists and engineers. The Technical Alliance started an &quot;Energy Survey of North America&quot;, which aimed to provide a scientific background from which ideas about a new social structure could be developed. However the group broke up in 1921 before the survey was completed.

In 1932, Scott and others interested in the problems of technological growth and economic change began meeting in New York City. Their ideas gained national attention and the &quot;Committee on Technocracy&quot; was formed at Columbia University, by Howard Scott and Walter Rautenstrauch. However, the group was short-lived and in January 1933 splintered into two other groups, the &quot;Continental Committee on Technocracy&quot; (led by Harold Loeb) and &quot;Technocracy Incorporated&quot; (led by Scott). Smaller groups included the Technical Alliance, The New Machine and the Utopian Society of America, though Bellamy had the most success due to his nationalistic stances, and Veblen&#x27;s rhetoric, removing the current pricing system and his blueprint for a national directorate to reorganize all produced goods and supply, and ultimately to radically increase all industrial output.
At the core of Scott&#x27;s vision was &quot;an energy theory of value&quot;. Since the basic measure common to the production of all goods and services was energy, he reasoned &quot;that the sole scientific foundation for the monetary system was also energy&quot;, and that society could be designed more efficiently by using an energy metric instead of a monetary metric (energy certificates or &#x27;energy accounting&#x27;). Technocracy Inc. officials wore a uniform, consisting of a &quot;well-tailored double-breasted suit, gray shirt, and blue necktie, with a monad insignia on the lapel&quot;, and its members saluted Scott in public.

Public interest in technocracy peaked in the early 1930s:

Technocracy&#x27;s heyday lasted only from June 16, 1932, when the &quot;New York Times&quot; became the first influential press organ to report its activities, until January 13, 1933, when Scott, attempting to silence his critics, delivered what some critics called a confusing, and uninspiring address on a well-publicized nationwide radio hookup. 
Following Scott&#x27;s radio address (Hotel Pierre Address), the condemnation of both him and technocracy in general reached a peak. The press and businesspeople reacted with ridicule and almost unanimous hostility. The American Engineering Council charged the technocrats with &quot;unprofessional activity, questionable data, and drawing unwarranted conclusions&quot;. 

The technocrats made a believable case for a kind of technological utopia, but their asking price was too high. The idea of political democracy still represented a stronger ideal than technological elitism. In the end, critics believed that the socially desirable goals that technology made possible could be achieved without the sacrifice of existing institutions and values and without incurring the apocalypse that technocracy predicted.

The faction-ridden Continental Committee on Technocracy collapsed in October 1936. However, Technocracy Incorporated continued.

On October 7, 1940, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested members of Technocracy Incorporated, charging them with belonging to an illegal organization. One of the arrested was Joshua Norman Haldeman, a Regina chiropractor, former director of Technocracy Incorporated, and the maternal grandfather of Elon Musk.

There were some speaking tours of the US and Canada in 1946 and 1947, and a motorcade from Los Angeles to Vancouver:

Hundreds of cars, trucks, and trailers, all regulation grey, from all over the Pacific Northwest, participated. An old school bus, repainted and retrofitted with sleeping and office facilities, a two-way radio, and a public address system, impressed observers. A huge war surplus searchlight mounted on a truck bed was included, and grey-painted motorcycles acted as parade marshals. A small grey aircraft, with a Monad symbol on its wings, flew overhead. All this was recorded by the Technocrats on 16-mm 900-foot colour film.

In 1948 activity declined while dissent increased within the movement. One central factor contributing to dissent was that &quot;the Price System had not collapsed, and predictions about the expected demise were becoming more and more vague&quot;. Some quite specific predictions about the price system collapse were made during the Great Depression, the first giving 1937 as the date, and the second forecasting the collapse as occurring &quot;prior to 1940&quot;.

Membership and activity declined steadily in the years after 1948, but some activity persisted, mostly around Vancouver in Canada and on the West Coast of the United States. Technocracy Incorporated currently maintains a website and distributes a monthly newsletter and holds membership meetings.

An extensive archive of Technocracy&#x27;s materials is held at the University of Alberta.

==Technocrats plan==
In a publication from 1938 Technocracy Inc. the main organization made the following statement in defining their proposal:
Technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population of this continent. For the first time in human history it will be done as a scientific, technical, engineering problem. There will be no place for Politics or Politicians, Finance or Financiers, Rackets or Racketeers. Technocracy states that this method of operating the social mechanism of the North American Continent is now mandatory because we have passed from a state of actual scarcity into the present status of potential abundance in which we are now held to an artificial scarcity forced upon us in order to continue a Price System which can distribute goods only by means of a medium of exchange. Technocracy states that price and abundance are incompatible; the greater the abundance the smaller the price. In a real abundance there can be no price at all. Only by abandoning the interfering price control and substituting a scientific method of production and distribution can an abundance be achieved. Technocracy will distribute by means of a certificate of distribution available to every citizen from birth to death. The Technate will encompass the entire American Continent from Panama to the North Pole because the natural resources and the natural boundary of this area make it an independent, self-sustaining geographical unit.
===Calendar===
The Technocratic movement planned to reform the work schedule, to achieve the goal of uninterrupted production, maximizing the efficiency and profitability of resources, transport and entertainment facilities, avoiding the &quot;weekend effect&quot;.

According to the movement&#x27;s calculations, it would be enough that every citizen worked a cycle of four consecutive days, four hours a day, followed by three days off. By &quot;tiling&quot; the days and working hours of seven groups, industry and services could be operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This system would include holiday periods allocated to each citizen.

=== Continental Accounting System ===
From the previous research of The Technical Alliance&#x27;s Energy Survey of North America, Technocracy Inc. states that a few key points need to be realized in order for a healthy distribution of resources can be efficiently made.

# Register on a continuous 24-hour time period basis the total net conversion of energy, which would determine
## the availability of energy for Continental plant construction and maintenance,
## the amount of physical wealth available in the form of consumable goods and services for consumption by the total population during the balanced load period
# By means of the registration of energy converted and consumed, make possible a balanced load
# Provide a continuous 24-hour inventory of all production and consumption
# Provide a specific registration of the type, kind, size, etc., of all goods and services, where produced, and where used
# Provide specific registration of the consumption of each individual, plus a record and description of the individual
# Allow the citizen the widest latitude of choice in consuming his individual share of Continental physical wealth
# Distribute goods and services to every member of the population

==== The Energy Certificate &amp; The Energy Distribution Card ====
Replacing the price system meant figuring out a new means of measuring distribution that also needed to be based on science. This lead to the technocrats concluding that measurements by units of energy was the most logical thing to do. Although Thorstein Veblen&#x27;s The Engineers and the Price System did not talk about price by energy. Nor did William Henry Smyth&#x27;s Technocracy Social Universals.

Technocrats rationalized that the flow of energy can be what determines a price by energy. With the usage of all forms of energy units, especially having emphasis on the erg and joules. They came up with The Energy Certificates. It would have a table with the information of a citizen&#x27;s identification, age, sex, occupation/location, energy allotment, purchases made, the issued date and expiration date of the certificates, formatted in a Dewey Decimal System. Each individual would be issued a booklet of the certificates. In modern times it would be as if we blended our ID with a bank card; Technocracy Inc. updated the certificates to be more like a debit card as they called it &quot;The Energy Distribution Card.&quot;
Differences between Energy Accounting and Monetary Systems are:
* Equal allotments of energy
** It was suggested that citizens under the workforce age(25) would still have an allowance of energy totally independent from parents or guardians
** Retired citizens(45) would still get their allotments
** Citizens out of work would still receive their allotments
* Citizens cannot trade or giveaway certificates. They can only spend energy at verified vendors
* Once a purchase is made at a vendor. The used energy is made void, the vendor does not gain the used energy. Therefor there is no circulation of energy or hording of energy
* The certificates have an expiration date. Any energy not used will become void, and on a given date the citizen will receive their new allotment of energy. Once again no citizen can horde energy
* Certificates are directly tied to an individual&#x27;s ID. Therefor it cannot be stolen or used by someone else

The term &quot;computer&quot; wasn&#x27;t used much by Howard Scott. But when it was, he used it with great optimism. Scott said technocracy&#x27;s C.A.S, energy certificates, and Dewey decimal system&#x27;s were a more paper based way of tracking computation; the IBM computers were exactly the kind of devices a C.A.S would want to deploy. Scott insisted that — &quot;One of the big troubles with all of this is that your computers is going to do away with your accountants and your engineers, and it is also going to do away with your executives, as well as the blue collar and the white collar, so more power to all of the computer control mechanisms.&quot;

A year after Scott&#x27;s passing, Chile started Project Cybersyn; a computerized system that tracks the economy. Philosophies of computerized government also popped up; see Cyberocracy. Engineers are the center profession of technocracy&#x27;s foundation, so claiming that they too will be replaced by automation is a big deal coming from a technocrat. Over the years, software for computer-aided design (CAD) and the 2022 revolution of large language models brought hysteria that engineers and software developers would be replaced by artificial intelligence.

==== Growth curves ====
Justification for such a radical economy was heavily demonstrated through Technocracy&#x27;s growth curves of economic equilibrium.

Their chart of &quot;Irreversible Physical Trends Shape America&#x27;s Destiny,&quot; was a continuation of The Technical Alliance&#x27;s Energy Survey of North America. With the graph being created by the Committee of Technocracy. Upon completion, the energy survey was approximately going to have 3,000 charts finished; with every field of industry being analyzed. 

According to Dr. Rautenstrauch the committee found that the formulas Technocracy worked out from business enterprise, greatly resembled the biological growth curves charted by Raymond Pearl&#x27;s &quot;Studies in Human Biology.&quot; The committee compared the Pearl-Reed equation to several major growth charts from U.S. industries; fitting similarly.

A foundation of technocracy&#x27;s arguments was made with said chart. What it shows is that pre-industrial revolution civilization primarily generated its consumer goods from human energy—human labor. And after the industrial revolution happened, a flip in dynamic changed. Resulting in greater energy output with less human toil. Machinery enable for more efficient work without human muscle. To the technocrats, this shift of equilibrium was going to lead to rapid technological unemployment with no plan for the price system to navigate distribution of wealth to the unemployed population.

=== The Technate ===
Technocracy looked for large areas with bountiful resources to enable self sufficiency. A Technate is practically a large body of land governed by a technocracy that only needs minimal trade.

Technocrats had a strong belief in continentalism. Scott mentioned that in the case of forming a North American Technate would be like forming a federation or union under the guidance of technocracy. Areas engaging in continentalism are the U.S.S.R and the European Union.





==== Continental Hydrology ====
A radical plan to transform the Technate&#x27;s mode of transportation was to have total control over all rivers and lakes across the continent. Travel by ship was faster than car or train at the time. The continental hydrology would end up linking several rivers. It also aimed to help monitor erosion of the country, generate power, and be educational for students.

This plan faced criticism for being a project that would destroy several habitats.
==== Technocracy: The design ====
Technocracy laid out a grand scheme to organize a new government. There are a few distinct layers; the Continental Director, Continental Board, Special Sequences, Functional Sequences, and Area Board.

All Directors are appointed from top down. With the only acceptation being for the Continental Director, because no position is above it; the Continental Director is chosen from Area Control by the Continental Board.

The Continental Director&#x27;s help oversee the Continent. Additionally, the Continental Director can be thrown out should two-thirds of the Continental Board say so.

The Continental Board consists of the Area Control.

Technocrats wanted to divide the Technate into Regional Divisions for administration areas. And decided to use the Earth&#x27;s latitude and longitude as a basis for calculating a &quot;quadrangle&quot; setup.

Functional Sequences are filled based on what the requirements of the Regional Division needs are. And can be added or removed as such.

It is in this effort that the technocrats aimed to totally organize both the economic system and the government as a blend of each other. This functional government would then work towards making the Continental Accounting System a reality.

=== Practicable Soviet of Technicians ===

Thorstein Veblen outlined what it would take for engineers to manage a country&#x27;s economy. Praising the idea that technicians in places of trust is an excellent idea. Veblen concluded that engineers in all fields would need to work together in accounting for all aspects of the industrial system.

Veblen loosely proposed a trilateral administration; three large councils of engineers that would lead into a central council.

* Central Directorate
** Executive Council of Resource Engineers
** Executive Council of Production Engineers
** Advisory Council of Production Economists
Veblen also argued that people educated in business would need to be banned from positions of trust. Believing that those who understand traditional economics thought too much like a businessperson and in doing so, bring the inefficient ideals that technocracy is trying to solve.

In point: &quot;By force of habit, men trained to a businesslike view of what is right and real will be irretrievably biased against any plan of production and distribution that is not drawn in terms of commercial profit and loss and does not provide a margin of free income to go to absentee owners. The personal exceptions to the rule are apparently few.&quot;

== Art representations of technocracy ==
The Technocracy Movement has made way for various pieces of artwork, from illustrations, and photography, to video games, and music.

=== Technocracy Inc.&#x27;s general aesthetics ===
Card carrying members were issued a Monad lapel pin or Monad patch and would wear gray suits during events and meetings. They have been encouraged to paint their cars gray as well. A few published technocracy books are mainly gray. The chosen color of technocracy, is gray. Howard Scott viewed a repetition of an official uniform would help spread a national identity for technocrats, and pique onlookers curiosity into the movement.

A common theme with technocracy&#x27;s publications are images of industrial equipment&#x27;s and factories.

Technocracy also had other items with propaganda slogans on them. Such as the case with the following technocracy match covers.
=== Technocrat robots ===
Notable illustrations are robots that represent a being of technocrats.

One of The Technocrats Magazines features a humanoid robot. With the cover showing the robot as a destructive force. Inside the magazine it shows the same robot overseer of civilization. And a robot is also representative of a technocrat from a cartoon artwork for a birthday card, although the artist seems to be confused as to what a technocrat is.

A small article that explains technocracy as being pro-machine. But debates that even if machinery could help humanity, we aren&#x27;t wise enough to use them in a benevolent manner. Hence the robot dinosaur destroying a city.

=== Influence in literature ===
Some Sci-Fi literature written by big industry names has featured the term technocracy or a society governed by technical experts. Which has resulted in both modern popularity in favor of a technically run society, and fear of a technically run society.

==== Isaac Asimov ====
After Howard Scott&#x27;s passing, Technocracy Inc. was failing to keep their relevancy. In efforts to gain popular attention they tried to interact with any writers expressing techno-utopian ideas with the hope that gaining them as members would also convince their audience to investigate technocracy. This included writing to Isaac Asimov. Although there does not appear to be information as to whether or not Asimov responded to Technocracy Inc.&#x27;s letters.

For some time Asimov was a member of the Futurians, a science fiction club based in New York. A few of its members were interested in technocracy, though this interest was short lived as once the interested members got a copy of the Technocracy Study Course, they changed their opinions. Viewing the Technocracy Movement as no different than progressive Stalinists. However there is no current information confirming if Isaac Asimov took part in reading the study course.

==== Aldous Huxley ====
Brave New World was intended to be a mockery of the ideals expressed by H. G. Wells. But turned into something more serious, a criticism of technocracy. Though dystopian the main civilization is highly advanced and has a rather happy populous; in essence the dystopian novel blurs the lines between what Utopians such as the technocrats strive for. Much like an argument of horseshoe theory.

A interesting line from the book — &quot;Alpha children wear gray. They work much harder than we do, because they&#x27;re so frightfully clever.&quot; The alphas are at the top of society&#x27;s hierarchy, becoming the scientists and engineers that govern civilization. But a possibly coincidental part is the mentioning of alphas wearing gray, just as the Technocracy Movement&#x27;s gray uniforms.

==== H. G. Wells ====
Well&#x27;s book The Shape of Things To Come was written in response to Aldous Huxley&#x27;s Brave New World. There have been a few mentions of Huxley in the book as Wells called him a reactionary.

The book follows alternative history of society rebuilding after WW2, with a technocratic faction rising from the rubble to rebuild the planet. Unlike B.N.W, The Shape of Things To Come was an argument in favor of a rational and engineered society.

In the book Wells explained technocracy — &quot;In America an interesting movement known as &#x27;Technocracy&#x27; was attracting attention. Essentially that was a soundly scientific effort to restate economics on a purely physical basis. But it was exploited in a journalistic fashion and presented to a remarkably receptive public as a cut-and-dried scheme for a new social order in which social and economic life was to be repudiation of democratic control by the Technologists at that date is very notable. The unit of energy was to be the basis of a new currency. So every power station became a mint and every waterfall a potential &#x27;goldmine&#x27;, and the money and the energy in human affairs remained practically in step.&quot;

=== Influence in video games ===
The Technocracy Movement has made its way into video games. With many mentions from big AAA companies.

==== Paradox Interactive ====
In video games, technocracy possibly gets its most representation from Paradox Interactive, a high budget game development company that primarily focuses around history strategy games.

===== Stellaris =====
Upon its 2016 release this space strategy game allows for players to become a technocracy government type. As of the 2.0 update the technocracy government type brings special research bonuses and &quot;capital buildings replace some Politician jobs with Science Director jobs.&quot;

The early 1.0 version the game had a particular loading screen image that had a humanoid alien looking out to a clean looking sci-fi city. And once the humanoid expansion came out the developers made the humanoid alien from the loading image into its own portrait and pre-made build called &quot;Voor Technocracy.&quot;

The economics in 1.0 Stellaris mainly relied on the &quot;mineral&quot; resource for purchasing buildings, and ships. But since 2.0 the developers intended that the energy resource would act more like the &quot;main currency&quot;. &quot;Energy Credits&quot; is the name of the energy resource, closely resembling the concept of technocracy&#x27;s Energy Certificates.

===== Hearts of Iron 4 =====
A large mod known as the &quot;Red Flood&quot; mod extends the base game&#x27;s ideologies. Most relevantly it loosely brought the events of the North American Technocracy Movement. The main storyline is Howard Scott&#x27;s Technocracy Inc. The player can now play as the United Technates of America.

Kaiserredux has Technocracy Inc. with Howard Scott. As well as Harold Loeb with his own competing faction. In this mod, Ernest Hemingway is also a leader for technocracy, due to Loeb and Hemingway being acquaintances.

Land of the Free mod has The Technical Alliance as a faction in California with Howard Scott as the leader.

All of the mentioned factions have unique national focus trees that represent the ideas advocated by the base movement.

===== Frostpunk 2 =====
One of the factions in Frostpunk 2 are the Technocrats. This faction has ideas based around machinery and population control. They also get research bonuses.

==== Victoria 3 ====

Distribution of Power has a technocracy civic defined as &quot;the nation is governed by an unelected council of men of reason and ability,&quot; giving multiple bonuses based around engineering, science, and authority. To adopt this distribution, the Central Archives need&#x27;s to be researched.

In the base game; for the United States the player can form into the &quot;Unified Scientific Associations,&quot; and adopting technocracy while being a Republic will change the flag into a technocracy flag; gray background with the Monad in the middle.

== Technocracy vs. socialism ==
Many comparisons between technocracy and socialist body of thought have been made by various readers. So much so that people often argue that countries such as the U.S.S.R, China, Singapore, and the European Union are technocracies. By definition of what the technocrat theorists argued; technocracy hasn&#x27;t truly been implemented. And there is a distinction between technocrats and socialists.

In Paul Blanshard&#x27;s publication of &quot;Technocracy and Socialism,&quot; he argued that because socialists don&#x27;t want liberal democracy, that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;d want a technocracy. Because socialists still very much want voting. From the socialists perspective all workers should have a say in organization, including the technocrats valued technician. Blanshard also believed that replacing the price system is not yet worth the risk, because technocracy has not fully detailed out how energy accounting would work.

Paul Temple&#x27;s &quot;A Totalitarian Fantasy-Technocracy, Fascism, and the war,&quot; made personal attacks on Howard Scott as he believed that Scott acted like a dictator. And that Scott&#x27;s propaganda was too close to a typical fascist to be taken seriously. Temple points out that technocrats don&#x27;t make the distinction of representative democracy under capitalism from a direct democracy under socialism.

&quot;Technocracy and Marxism&quot; by William Z. Foster and Earl Browder asserts that communists (as taught from Lenin and Stalin) have already realized all the issues technocrats have pointed out, years before. Howard Scott makes a bold claim that pre-industrial revolution philosophies have become totally irrelevant due to technology making a new need for a new philosophy; Foster &amp; Browder disagree. They also point out that basing price by energy rejects the socialists measurements labor theory of value, claiming that this action is using an arbitrary unit (the erg) and was just switching one unit for another.

H. G. Wells seemed to argue for both socialism and technocracy. When Wells had a conversation with Joseph Stalin he insisted that the technical intelligentsia have begun to realize that capitalistic society has created lots of problems in all social classes. Which would bring a scientific perspective to a revolution. Stalin was not so convinced, as during previous revolutionary action those in fields of science and engineering have been more complacent than willing to help a working class movement.

Howard Scott believed that there was distinction between technocracy and socialism. He&#x27;s made the provocative statement — &quot;As far as technocracy&#x27;s ideas are concerned. We&#x27;re so far left that we make communism look bourgeois.&quot; In this single sentence Scott asserts that technocrats are further left-wing than communists. And used the socialists jargon of bourgeois against them; making it known that technocrats believe themselves to be more egalitarian than socialists. Scott also criticized communism as &quot;not being radical enough,&quot; as every socialist country still used the price system. Howard Scott has also said &quot;the Red Technocrats&quot; during a meeting; further solidifying that technocracy while not socialism was on the left.

==Europe==
In Germany before the Second World War, a technocratic movement based on the American model introduced by Technocracy Incorporated existed but ran afoul of the political system there.

There was also a Soviet movement whose early history resembled the North American one during the interwar period. One of its leading members was engineer Peter Palchinsky. Technocratic ideology was also promoted by the Engineer&#x27;s Herald journal. The Soviet technocrats advanced the scientization of the economic development, management as well as industrial and organizational psychology under the slogan &quot;The future belongs to the managing-engineers and the engineering-managers.&quot;. Those viewpoints were supported by leading Right Opposition members Nikolai Bukharin and Alexei Rykov. The promotion of an alternative view on the country&#x27;s industrialization and the engineer&#x27;s role in society incurred Joseph Stalin&#x27;s wrath. Palchinsky was executed in 1929, and a year later leading Soviet engineers were accused of an anti-government conspiracy in the Industrial Party Trial. A large scale persecution of engineers followed, forcing them to focus on narrow technical issues assigned to them by communist party leaders. The concept of Tectology developed by Alexander Bogdanov, perhaps the most important of the non-Leninist Bolsheviks, bears some semblance to technocratic ideas. Both Bogdanov&#x27;s fiction and his political writings as presented by Zenovia Sochor, imply that he expected a coming revolution against capitalism to lead to a technocratic society.

<doc id="1324777" wikidata="Q330531" url="?curid=1324777" title="Kota, Rajasthan">
<text>Kota (), previously known as &quot;Kotah&quot;, is the third-largest city of the north-western Indian state of Rajasthan. It is located about south of the state capital, Jaipur, on the banks of Chambal River. As of 2024, with a population of over 1.5 million, it is the third most populous city in Rajasthan, after Jaipur and Jodhpur. It serves as the administrative headquarters for Kota district and Kota division. It was founded as a walled city in the 14th century in the erstwhile Bundi state and became the capital of the princely state of Kota in 1625, following the separation of the Bundi and the Kota state. Kota is known for its coaching institutes for engineering and medical entrance exams, such as JEE and NEET. Each year, over 200,000 students move to Kota to prepare for these competitive exams, earning it the nickname &quot;Coaching Capital of India&quot;.

In addition to several monuments, Kota is known for its palaces and gardens. The city was included among 98 Indian cities for Smart Cities Mission initiated by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015 and was listed at 67th place after results of first round were released following which top 20 cities were further selected for funding in the immediate financial year.

==History==

The history of the city dates back to the 12th century CE when Rao Deva, a Chauhan Rajput chieftain belonging to the Hada clan conquered the territory and founded Bundi and Hadoti. Later, in the early 17th century, during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, the ruler of Bundi – Rao Ratan Singh, gave the smaller principality of Kota to his son, Madho Singh. Since then Kota became a hallmark of the Rajput gallantry and culture.


Kota became an independent state in 1631 when Rao Madho Singh, the second son of Rao Ratan of [Bundi] was made the ruler, by the Mughal Emperor Jahangir. Soon Kota outgrew its parent state to become bigger in area, richer in revenue and more powerful. Maharao Bhim Singh played a pivotal role in Kota&#x27;s history, having held a &#x27;Mansab&#x27; of five thousand and being the first in his dynasty to have the title of Maharao. Zalim Singh, a diplomat, and statesman, emerged as another prominent figure of the state in the 18th century. Although initially being a general of Kota&#x27;s army, he rose to the regent of the kingdom after the king died leaving a minor on the throne. He remained a direct administrator of the state. In 1817, a treaty of friendship was signed between him and the British on his condition of carving out part from the existing state for his descendants resulting in Jhalawar coming into existence in 1838. Kota was not involved in the earlier events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. However, when in October 1857 rebels murdered the local British resident and his two sons, British forces responded by storming the city and, after some resistance, capturing it in March 1858.

In the 1940s, social activist Guru Radha Kishan organised trade union activities and campaigned against the colonial government. He left Kota after the local administration learned of the arrest warrant issued against him for his participation in Indian Independence activities.

==Geography==

Kota is located along the banks of the Chambal River in the southern part of Rajasthan. It is the 3rd largest city of Rajasthan after Jaipur and Jodhpur. The cartographic coordinates are . It covers an area of . It has an average elevation of 271 metres (889 ft). The district is bound on the north and northwest by Sawai Madhopur, Tonk and Bundi districts. The Chambal River separates these districts from Kota district, forming the natural boundary.

The city of Kota is situated at the centre of the southeastern region of Rajasthan a region very widely known as Hadoti, the land of the Hadas. Kota lies along the banks of the Chambal river on a high sloping tableland forming a part of the Malwa Plateau. The general slope of the city is towards the north. The comparatively rocky, barren, and elevated land in the southern part of the city descends towards a plain agricultural land in the north. The Mukundara hills run from southeast to northwest axis of the town.

Kota has fertile land and greenery with irrigation facilities through canals. The two main canals; called as left main canal (towards Bundi) and right main canal (towards Baran) originate from the reservoir created by Kota Barrage. The tributaries of these canals make up a network in the city and surrounding areas of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and supplements the irrigation of these areas.

===Climate===
Kota has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;), bordering on a tropical savanna climate (Koppen: Aw), with high temperatures throughout the year. Summers are long, hot, and dry, starting in late March and lasting till the end of June. The temperatures average above 40 °C in May and June, frequently exceed 45 °C with temperatures as high as 48.5 °C also been recorded. The monsoon season follows with comparatively lower temperatures, but higher humidity and frequent, torrential downpours. The monsoons subside in October and temperatures rise again. The brief, mild winter starts in late November and lasts until the last week of February. Temperatures hover between 26.7 °C (max) to 12.0 °C (min). This can be considered the best time to visit Kota because of intense heat in the summer.

The average annual rainfall in the Kota district is 800.6 mm. Most of the rainfall can be attributed to the southwest monsoon which has its beginning around the last week of June and may last till mid-September. Pre-monsoon showers begin towards the middle of June with post-monsoon rains occasionally occurring in October. The winter is largely dry, although some rainfall does occur as a result of the Western Disturbance passing over the region.

Kota also has an extensive industry of stone-polishing (tiles) of a stone called Kota Stone, used for the floor and walls of residential and business buildings. Since last 15 years Kota has emerged as an Education hub of the country as producing excellent results in IIT-JEE and medical entrance exams.

=== Kota educational industry ===
Kota is known as a major center for competitive test preparation, attracting around 150,000 students each year, as reported in 2023. These students come from across the country to enroll in coaching institutes that prepare them for national entrance exams for engineering and medical colleges.

<doc id="1324786" wikidata="Q2494341" url="?curid=1324786" title="Dissent!">
<text>Dissent! was the name adopted by an international network of local groups, which came together to organise opposition to the G8 summit held at Gleneagles Hotel, Perthshire, Scotland, in July 2005. Most groups shared an anti-capitalist orientation and anti-authoritarian organizing methods and the network declares itself to be open to anyone prepared to work within the Hallmarks of Peoples&#x27; Global Action, an international co-ordination of radical social movements and grassroots campaigns. Dissent acted as a networking tool and created infrastructure which was used by groups with methods of protest ranging from anti-border city tours and street parties to road blockades, graffiti and confrontations with the police.

The network was formed in the autumn of 2003 by a group of people who have previously been involved in radical ecological direct action, Peoples&#x27; Global Action, the anti-war movement and the global anti-capitalist movement which has emerged around meetings of those that rule over us.

In the run-up to the summit itself, groups associated with Dissent! organised actions targeting a number of the preparatory meetings which brought together ministers from the G8 countries. Among these were the Environment and Development Ministerial in Derbyshire (March 17–18) and the Justice and Interior Ministerial in Sheffield (June 15–18).

The network set-up an &quot;eco-camp&quot; known as HoriZone in the town of Stirling to host protesters. This was organised along non-hierarchical lines conforming with the principles of direct democracy and broken down into largely autonomous &quot;barrios&quot;. The camp was also run in such a way as to minimise its environmental impact; recycling, conserving water and utilising biodiesel in its vehicles.

The Dissent! Network in Germany was one of the networks mobilising against the 33rd G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Germany, since 2005. Since that time other Dissent! Networks were started in Sweden, Netherlands, Spain, Belgium and France.

==Career==
During his life he had been attached to TBS broadcast theater company and then Aoni Production, Production Baobab, he became a director of his own agency 21st century FOX; he was attached to 81 Produce at the time of his death.

He was known to voice many characters in anime series for 62 years. He appeared in children&#x27;s anime and educational programmes.

In addition to &quot;Doraemon&quot;, he had prominent roles in &quot;Cyborg 009&quot; (as 007/Great Britain), Dracula (Kaibutsu-kun), Kemumaki Kemuzou (Ninja Hattori-kun), Pāyan (Perman), Iyami (Osomatsu-kun), Quackerjack (Darkwing Duck), Tom (Tom and Jerry), Benzou Karino (Kiteretsu Daihyakka), Horrorman (Soreike! Anpanman), Conductor (Galaxy Express 999) and Jiminy Cricket (Japanese dub of Pinocchio and all other appearances).

He was the mentor of Kappei Yamaguchi.

===Gian===
In 1973, he was cast in the Nippon TeleMovie Productions adaptation of Fujiko F. Fujio&#x27;s &quot;Doraemon&quot; series as Takeshi Goda (Gian or Jaian), a strong and quick-tempered local bully who can fight at any time and with any kid he sees, especially Nobita.

Alongside co-stars Yoshiko Ota (Nobita Nobi), Masako Ebisu (Shizuka Minamoto), Shun Yashiro (Suneo Honekawa), Kōsei Tomita/Masako Nozawa (Doraemon), he voiced the character before the series was cancelled after 26 episodes.

In 1978, Kimotsuki was cast in Leiji Matsumoto&#x27;s &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; as the Conductor, the main crew member of the Galaxy Express 999. He is an alien being with an invisible body; only his eyes can be seen while he is wearing his conductor uniform, alongside his co-stars Masako Nozawa (Tetsuro Hoshino) and Masako Ikeda (Maetel). When it came time for the 1990s film the cast reprised the roles yet again.

In 2006, he reunited with Nozawa and Ikeda to reprise their respective roles for the OVA and TV series.

===Horrorman===
In 1991, he was cast in the children&#x27;s anime &quot;Soreike! Anpanman&quot; as the character Horrorman, a living skeleton who often works with Baikinman and Dokin-chan, often for Dokin-chan&#x27;s affections or for the heck of it. Alongside co-stars Ryūsei Nakao (Baikinman) and Hiromi Tsuru (Dokinchan), they voiced the terrible trio together for 25 years until 2016.

<text>Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) is a public utility agency of the city of Seattle, Washington, which provides water, sewer, drainage and garbage services for 1.3 million people in King County, Washington. The agency was established in 1997, consolidating the city&#x27;s Water Department with other city functions.

==Water supply==

SPU owns two water collection facilities in the Cascade Mountains that supply drinking water used by 1.6 million people in Seattle and surrounding suburbs in 2023. The Cedar River watershed comprises 60 percent of the normal supply, and the Tolt River watershed supplies the remaining 40 percent (primarily north of Green Lake). The Cedar River supply is unfiltered, while the Tolt River is filtered and relied upon more heavily during dry years.

From the city&#x27;s founding through the 1880s, Seattle&#x27;s water was provided by several private companies. In a July 8, 1889, election, barely a month after the Great Seattle Fire (June 6, 1889) gave a dramatic illustration of the limitations of the city&#x27;s water supply, Seattle&#x27;s citizens voted 1,875 to 51 to acquire and operate their own water system. In accordance with this vote, the city Water Department acquired the Lake Union and Spring Hill plants for $400,000.

This was understood from the first to be only a temporary expedient, inadequate to the expected growth of the city. Attention soon focused on the Cedar River, an idea first proposed in the 1870s; the question was how to bring that water to the city. From 1892, the responsibility for doing so fell to newly hired City Engineer Reginald H. Thomson and his assistant George F. Cotterill. Besides the technical challenges, they and a series of Seattle mayors had to keep the citizenry on board to move forward with this expensive project through the Panic of 1893.

The Klondike Gold Rush put Seattle on a sound economic footing. The 1901 completion of Cedar River Supply System No. 1 (active from February 21, 1901) gave the city a steady supply of clean water with an intake from the city itself; this was supplemented by Cedar River Supply System No. 2 in 1909. Together, these systems gave the city a supply of more than of water a day.

The original Cedar River pipeline was made of reinforced wooden pipe &quot;big enough so a small boy could stand upright in it&quot; and carried of water a day. By 1950, three big mains carried up to of water a day.

To guard against contamination at the source, the city purchased or otherwise gained control of of land and placed it under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Sanitation. The city also established an extensive system of reservoirs within city limits. By 1919, six reservoirs had a combined capacity of . In 1950, the city owned &quot;about two-thirds&quot; of the watershed, the federal government &quot;about one-fourth&quot;; the remainder, &quot;around eleven square miles,&quot; was owned by private lumber companies.

Seattle has at times contracted to provide water for entities outside of city limits. By 2007, it provided water to 19 municipalities and water districts in King County.

In recent decades, the Seattle Regional Water System has significantly improved conservation. 2008 usage was roughly equal to usage in 1960, despite roughly a 35% increase in population over that period. From 1990 to 2012 total water usage declined 29%, despite a population increase of 17%.

==Garbage management==

SPU operates two waste sorting facilities: the North Transfer Station in Wallingford and the South Transfer Station in South Park. Both facilities were opened in the 1960s and rebuilt in the 2010s to handle greater volumes and include environmentally friendly features. Garbage from Seattle is shipped out via train to the Columbia Ridge Landfill near Arlington, Oregon.

<text>Carl Jularbo, better known as Calle Jularbo and born Karl Karlsson (6 June 1893, in Jularbo, Avesta Municipality, Dalarna County, Sweden – 13 February 1966, in Nacka Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden) was the most famous Swedish accordionist of his time. He had a very distinct personal style, that has played a significant part in forming the Swedish accordion tradition. He was extremely productive, recording 1577 tunes and he won 158 accordion competitions. He maintained a large repertoire without being able to read music. His best known tune is &quot;Livet i Finnskogarna&quot; (roughly &quot;Life in the Finn forests&quot;), recorded in 1915. This song was the basis for the Les Paul and Mary Ford hit of 1951, &quot;Mockin&#x27; Bird Hill&quot;.

Jularbo is the name of his birthplace, which he later adopted as his name. Both his parents were of predominantly Romani descent, which was not revealed until after his death.

<doc id="1324810" wikidata="Q7996164" url="?curid=1324810" title="Whitemarsh Hall">
<text>Whitemarsh Hall was an estate owned by banking executive Edward T. Stotesbury and his wife, Eva, on of land in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, United States. Designed by the Gilded Age architect Horace Trumbauer, it was built in 1921 and demolished in 1980. Before its destruction, the mansion was the third-largest private residence in the United States.

Despite the name, Whitemarsh Hall was located in Springfield Township, not in Whitemarsh Township which borders Springfield to the west.

== History ==

=== Construction and appointments ===
Designed by the Beaux-Arts architect Horace Trumbauer between 1916 and 1921, Whitemarsh Hall included six stories (three of which were partly or fully underground). There were 147 rooms across , which included 45 bathrooms, in addition to specialty rooms such as a ballroom, gymnasium, movie theatre, and a refrigerating plant. The neo-Georgian mansion had been a wedding present from Stotesbury to his second wife, Eva (the former Lucretia Cromwell, née Roberts). Completion was delayed by World War I; while the exterior was mostly completed by the end of the war, the interior decorations and furnishings, many of which had to come from war-ravaged Europe, took much longer to arrive.

The mansion was lavishly decorated with statues, paintings, and tapestry that Stotesbury had collected over the years, a collection later bequeathed to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The French 18th-century furniture was purchased through Lord Duveen, who had guided Stotesbury in assembling the second of America&#x27;s great collections of English portraits, and the floor was lined with exquisite Oriental rugs, also purchased under the guidance of Duveen. Stotesbury was also advised by Duveen in the purchasing of French sculpture to decorate the huge mansion.

The gardens and landscaping were designed by the urbanist and architect Jacques Gréber, whose designs in the grand manner of André Le Nôtre for the Philadelphian P.A.B. Widener at Lynnewood Hall had recommended him to Trumbauer and to Eva Stotesbury, who moved into a house next to the estate to follow the progress of construction at close hand.

=== Life at Whitemarsh Hall ===
The estate also included several lesser houses and utility buildings spread over the , as well as four large greenhouses for growing trees and ferns. Smaller greenhouses were used for growing the many flowers needed to decorate the house for the lavish parties the Stotesburys liked to host. More than 70 gardeners worked at maintaining the grounds. The inside staff usually numbered 40, but many of them would follow the Stotesburys as they made their yearly pilgrimages to their Florida mansion, El Mirasol, for the winter and to Wingwood House, their mansion in Bar Harbor, Maine, for the summer.

In addition to E. T., Eva and their servants, Whitemarsh Hall was also designed with Eva&#x27;s two children in mind (adults by the time it opened), who were given their own rooms in the house. Her son Jimmy frequently resided within, as did (to a lesser extent) her daughter Louise.

For about nine years the mansion was the site of lavish balls and receptions. The intensity of the party life dropped a bit after the Great Depression in 1929, and fell even more after 1933 when the Stotesburys were openly criticized for enjoying a life of splendor while most of the country suffered the hardships of the depression. The death of one of E. T. Stotesbury&#x27;s own daughters in 1935 continued to dampen the Stotesburys&#x27; enthusiasm for festivities.

Whitemarsh Hall had often been called the &quot;American Versailles&quot;, because of the level of attention to detail in the gardens and in the main building.

=== After Stotesbury ===
Eva Stotesbury discovered, after the death of her husband in 1938, that she was relatively broke. Stotesbury had once declared that it cost him over a million dollars a year to maintain the house and the extensive property surrounding it. As a result of the Great Depression, the value of Whitemarsh Hall and its opulent furnishings was significantly lowered. Eva closed the mansion and moved to one of her other mansions, El Mirasol in Palm Beach, Florida. She donated the , steel fence to the War Department to be turned into metal for 18,000 guns.

During much of World War II, the property was used for warehousing the bulk of New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum of Art art treasures as it was feared that the Germans would bombard Manhattan from U-boats or warships. Eva Stotesbury had already put the property on the market after her husband&#x27;s death, but there were no buyers. The property did not sell until 1943.

=== Transformation, then abandonment ===
Whitemarsh Hall was finally sold for $167,000 to the Pennsalt Chemical Corporation (today part of Total Petrochemicals USA), which transformed the building into a research laboratory. Much of the grounds surrounding the mansion were sold for real estate development, which was quickly realized after the war ended. Pennsalt kept the mansion and its remaining grounds maintained and modernized, and constructed some new facilities on the property as well.

In 1963, Pennsalt (later renamed Pennwalt) built a new research center in the King of Prussia area, and moved out of Whitemarsh Hall, which was sold to a property investment group. Efforts to preserve or sell the mansion intact by this and successive owners were unsuccessful, and as the property became neglected and vandalized over the following years, demolition was decided upon. Disputes over the form of residential redevelopment to be undertaken (especially plans which envisioned luxury apartment towers) delayed demolition for a number of years.

== The site today ==
The mansion, which was larger than the White House in Washington, D.C. was demolished in 1980, and a development of modern townhouses called Stotesbury Estates was built on the property. The massive limestone pillars which were part of the mansion&#x27;s front portico were left in situ as a tribute, along with the large belvedere at the back of the home. No homes occupy the footprint of the mansion itself, whose basements and foundations were simply backfilled. Small remnants of the huge gardens still exist today, including a fountain, several statues, stairs, and pieces of low stone fence and walls. The twin pillars of the estate&#x27;s main gate, which was one mile (1.6 km) from the back of Whitemarsh Hall, are still standing on Douglas Road off Willow Grove Avenue, minus the steel gates. The gatehouse on Douglas Road, behind the main entrance pillars, also remains, converted to a private residence.

<text>The Seven Lively Arts is an American anthology series that aired on Sunday afternoons on CBS television from November 3, 1957, until February 16, 1958. The series was executive produced by John Houseman, and hosted by &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; critic John Crosby. Alfredo Antonini served as the musical director for several episodes. The title was taken from the influential book of the same name written by the cultural critic Gilbert Seldes, in which he argued that the low arts (comics, vaudeville) deserved as much critical attention as the high arts (opera, literature). 
The eleven programs produced were—not in order: 
* &quot;The Revivalists&quot; – a profile of contemporary evangelism
* &quot;Hollywood around the World&quot; – a profile of overseas film productions directed by Mel Ferrer
* &quot;The Blast in Centralia #5&quot; – about a 1947 mine blast in Centralia, Illinois
* &quot;Here is New York&quot; – an essay about the city written by E. B. White and narrated by E. G. Marshall.
* &quot;A Few Folks And Their Songs&quot; – a program on folk music, hosted by Theodore Bikel
* &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; – the first television production of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet (heavily abridged)
* &quot;The World of Nick Adams&quot; – an adaptation combining five early Ernest Hemingway stories
* &quot;Profile of a Composer&quot; – a profile of American composer and choralist Norman Dello Joio
* &quot;Gold Rush&quot; – a ballet choreographed by Agnes de Mille
* &quot;The Sound of Jazz&quot; – The top jazz musicians of the day performing live.
* &quot;The Changing Ways of Love&quot; – the opening program, starring Piper Laurie and Jason Robards, written by S.J. Perelman

==Critical response==
In a review in the periodical &quot;Film and TV Music&quot; Thomas Talbert praised the episode &quot;The Sound of Jazz&quot;, writing that it had an element that had been &quot;lacking in TV music presentation&quot;. Talbert called the episode &quot;Truly a brilliant program, artistically photographed without stiffness and easily the best that television has offered on modern music.&quot;

<text>Archibald Fairly Carr Jr. (June 16, 1909 – May 21, 1987) was an American herpetologist, ecologist, and conservationist. He was a Professor of Zoology at the University of Florida and a writer on science and nature. He brought attention to the world&#x27;s declining sea turtle populations due to over-exploitation and habitat loss. Wildlife refuges in Florida and Costa Rica have been named in his honor.

==Biography==

Born in Mobile, Alabama, to a Presbyterian pastor, Carr grew up in Mobile, Fort Worth, Texas, and Savannah, Georgia. He studied zoology at the University of Florida (UF), eventually specializing in herpetology. He further refined that interest to the study of turtles and eventually became one of the world&#x27;s foremost authorities on sea turtles. He married Marjorie Harris Carr, a conservationist herself.

While a student at UF, he became a member of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. From UF, he received bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1932, M.S. in 1934, and Ph.D. in 1937.

He was a high school science teacher before becoming a college professor. He published numerous books and articles, including &quot;Ulendo: Travels of a Naturalist in and out of Africa&quot;, &quot;High Jungles and Low&quot;, &quot;So Excellent a Fishe&quot; (about his green turtles), &quot;The Windward Road&quot; and several Time-Life books such as &quot;The Everglades&quot; and &quot;The Reptiles&quot;. He also authored the &quot;Handbook of Turtles&quot;, and with Coleman Jett Goin, &quot;Guide to the Reptiles, Amphibians and Freshwater Fishes of Florida&quot;. While a serious scientific and nature writer, he also published a parody of scientific taxonomic keys – his &quot;A Subjective Key to the Fishes of Alachua County, Florida&quot;, affectionately known as the &quot;Carr Key&quot;.

Carr became a bit of a legend at UF, and students vied with one another to take his Community Ecology course in which they were involved in several major and minor field trips around northern Florida and southern Georgia. Listening to Carr talk about the Sand Pine scrub near Ocala or his comments as he guided students through the Okefenokee Swamp in canoes was considered a great privilege.

Carr was also known for his efforts in conservation, especially for sea turtles, helping convince Costa Rica to establish Tortuguero National Park in 1975. He was a co-founder of the Caribbean Conservation Corporation, which helps to save and monitor sea turtles in Tortuguero, Costa Rica. He often joined his wife Marjorie Carr in conservation work, as she was a major advocate for conservation in her own right. In 1952 the National Academy of Sciences awarded Carr the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal.

<text>Venera 2 ( meaning &quot;Venus 2&quot;), also known as 3MV-4 No.4 was a Soviet spacecraft intended to explore Venus. A 3MV-4 spacecraft launched as part of the Venera programme, it failed to return data after flying past Venus.

Venera 2 was launched by a Molniya carrier rocket, flying from Site 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The launch occurred at 05:02 UTC on 12 November 1965, with the first three stages placing the spacecraft and Blok-L upper stage into a low Earth parking orbit before the Blok-L fired to propel Venera 2 into heliocentric orbit bound for Venus, with perihelion of 0.716 AU, aphelion of 1.197 AU, eccentricity of 0.252, inclination of 4.29 degrees and orbital period of 341 days.

The Venera 2 spacecraft was equipped with cameras, as well as a magnetometer, solar and cosmic x-ray detectors, piezoelectric detectors, ion traps, a Geiger counter and receivers to measure cosmic radio emissions. The spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus at 02:52 UTC on 27 February 1966, at a distance of .

During the flyby, all of Venera 2&#x27;s instruments were activated, requiring that radio contact with the spacecraft be suspended. The probe was to have stored data using onboard recorders, and then transmitted it to Earth once contact was restored. Following the flyby the spacecraft failed to reestablish communications with the ground. It was declared lost on 4 March 1966. An investigation into the failure determined that the spacecraft had overheated due to a radiator malfunction.

<text>Daniele Sepe (born 17 April 1960 in Naples) is an Italian musician, known internationally for interpreting protest songs from around the world.

His first instrument was the flute, which he played at the San Pietro a Majella conservatoire. After graduating, he began performing with the Gruppo operaio &#x27;E Zezi di Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco, playing at numerous festivals and recording a few albums.

Sepe soon, however, became more interested in jazz and learned to play the saxophone. He continued recording and began performing with many prominent musicians, like Nino D&#x27;Angelo, Gino Paoli, Eduardo de Crescenzo, Mia Martini, Teresa de Sio, Roberto de Simone, Peppino Gagliardi, Nino Bonocore and Roberto Murolo. His band, which played under several names, varied widely, from purely wind instruments to big bands. He also composed music for the theatre, cinema and ballet.

In 1994, Sepe recorded &quot;Vite Perdite&quot;, which was much more successful than any of his previous niche recordings. It was dubbed album of year by &quot;Rockerilla&quot;, one of the one hundred greatest albums of the 1990s by &quot;Rockstar&quot;, and received a rave review from &quot;Folk-Roots&quot;, an English magazine.

<doc id="1324823" wikidata="Q5303114" url="?curid=1324823" title="Downer Group">
<text>Downer Group is an integrated services company active in Australia and New Zealand.

Listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and New Zealand Stock Exchange as Downer EDI (DOW), Downer is an ASX 200 company.

Downer Group employs approximately 33,000 people across more than 300 sites, primarily in Australia and New Zealand, but also in the Asia-Pacific region, South America and southern Africa.

==History==
Downer&#x27;s foundations were laid in the 19th century, when Walkers Limited and Clyde Engineering were founded in Australia, and the Public Works Department and Electrical Telegraph Department were founded in New Zealand. They merged in the 20th century to form parts of the Downer Group. The 20th century also saw the purchase of companies that now make up Downer&#x27;s core divisions: railway manufacturer Evans Deakin &amp; Company (EDI) and mining contractor Roche Brothers.

In 1933, the Downer Group was founded in New Zealand by Arnold Fielder Downer, as Downer &amp; Co, focusing on providing engineering and construction services to the public and private infrastructure sectors in New Zealand, including the New Zealand Public Works Department. In 1954, Downer &amp; Co merged with William Cable Holdings and, in 1964, with A &amp; G Price, to form Cable Price Downer.

In 1994, Downer merged with Hong Kong-based Paul YITC. In 1996, the company purchased Works Corporation, the state-owned enterprise civil construction arm of the New Zealand Ministry of Works &amp; Development. In 1997, mining contractor Roche Brothers was acquired. In 1998, Downer purchased major roads contractor Technic Group, and was first listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.

In 2000, road-sealing business Bitumix was acquired from BP. In 2001, Downer merged with Evans Deakin Industries to form Downer EDI. Between 2003 and 2008, Downer also acquired Stork, QCC, Snowden, Emoleum and Excell Corporation. In October 2014, the construction assets of Tenix were acquired.

In March 2017, Downer acquired Hawkins, one of New Zealand&#x27;s largest builders, and in June 2017, took majority ownership of Spotless Group Holdings through a hostile takeover. It took full ownership of Spotless for $1.27 billion in October 2020. The Spotless acquisition was the largest in Downer&#x27;s history.

==Operations==
Downer reports its financial results under five service lines: Transport; Utilities; Facilities; Engineering, Construction and Maintenance (EC&amp;M); and Mining.

===Rail/Bus===

Downer Rail was formed in March 2001 as EDI Rail following the purchase of Evans Deakin Industries by Downer Group. Evans Deakin operated the former Clyde Engineering plants at Kelso and Somerton and Walkers Limited, Maryborough plant. It reopened the former Cardiff Locomotive Workshops to build CityRail M sets. In July 2007 it was renamed Downer Rail.

In 2008 Locomotive Demand Power was established as a subsidiary to lease locomotives. In November 2009 Downer Rail became a tram operator through its 49% shareholding in Keolis Downer that operates the Yarra Trams franchise in Melbourne. In July 2014, Keolis Downer commenced operating the light rail line on the Gold Coast.

In March 2015, Keolis Downer purchased bus operator Australian Transit Enterprises which operates the Hornibrook Bus Lines, LinkSA, Path Transit and SouthLink operations with 930 buses. In July 2017, Keolis Downer commenced operating bus and ferry services in Newcastle under the Newcastle Transport brand.

===Transport===
Transport comprises Downer&#x27;s road services, infrastructure projects, and rail &amp; transit systems businesses. It conducts transport infrastructure services that include earthworks, civil construction, asset management, maintenance, surfacing and stabilisation, supply of bituminous products and logistics, open space and facilities management and rail track signalling and electrification works. In June 2023, Downer Group sold the transport projects business to Gamuda Berhad who rebranded it DT Infrastructure.

==Use of pseudoscience==

In 2019 Downer admitted to using dowsing, in an attempt to find water pipes while contracting to the Wellington City Council. Dowsing is considered a pseudoscience and there is no scientific evidence that it is any more effective than random chance. Downer told New Zealand Skeptic&#x27;s chair Craig Shearer that Downer has no concern about the public perception that ratepayer money is being spent on a technique considered pseudoscience. Downer&#x27;s general manager of business excellence and reputation Brooke Dahlberg said &quot;the method is safe, and it has no plan to ban staff from using it – the choice to use it was up to individual employees.&quot;

In December 2019, at the New Zealand Skeptics annual conference, the Downer Group was co-awarded the Bent Spoon by NZ Skeptics for &quot;showing the most egregious gullibility in 2019&quot; for the contractor&#x27;s use of water divining to find underground pipes.

<text>The Japan Golf Tour () is a prominent professional golf tour. It was founded in 1973 and as of 2006 it offered the third-highest annual prize fund out of the regular (that is not for seniors) men&#x27;s professional tours after the PGA Tour and the European Tour. However, since the early 1990s, the growth in prize money has not kept pace with that on the two larger tours. Official events on the Japan Golf Tour count for Official World Golf Ranking points and success on the tour can also qualify members to play in the majors.

Most of the leading players on the tour are Japanese, but players from many other countries also participate. The tour is currently run by the Japan Golf Tour Organization (JGTO), which was established in 1999 to separate the tour from the PGA of Japan. The JGTO also organises a developmental tour called the Japan Challenge Tour.

Masashi Ozaki has been the dominant player on tour, leading the career wins list with 94, the career money list with over ¥2 billion and winning the money title twelve times between 1973 and 1998.

Entry to The Open Championship is given to Order of Merit winner and runner-up, Japan Open Golf Championship winner, two players not already exempt from the money list up to the Japan Golf Tour Championship and the top four non-exempt players from the Mizuno Open.

In 2000, the tour signed a title sponsorship agreement with Iiyama, being renamed as the iiyama Tour. The agreement was reported to be worth over three years.

In 2008, the tour ventured outside of Japan for the first time, co-sanctioning the Pine Valley Beijing Open in China, alongside the Asian Tour. In 2013, the tour also co-sanctioned two events at the beginning of the year in Thailand and Indonesia with the OneAsia Tour.

In December 2022, a new agreement involving the JGTO, PGA Tour and European Tour was announced. As part of the deal, from 2023 onwards the top three on the Japan Golf Tour&#x27;s season-ending money list earned status to play on the European Tour for the following season.

<text>Mujhse Dosti Karoge! () is a 2002 Indian Hindi-language romantic comedy film directed by Kunal Kohli and produced by Yash Chopra for his banner, Yash Raj Films. The film stars Hrithik Roshan, Rani Mukerji and Kareena Kapoor in the lead roles, with Uday Chopra in a supporting role. The film follows the love triangle of 3 childhood friends: Pooja (Mukerji), Raj (Roshan) and Tina (Kapoor).

&quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot; marked the directorial debut of Kohli, who also wrote the dialogue and co-wrote the screenplay and story with Aditya Chopra. The film&#x27;s cinematography was jointly handled by Ravi K. Chandran and Gopal Shah, while Rahul Sharma served as the soundtrack composer.

Made on a budget of , &quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot; was released on 9 August 2002. Despite much hype due to its A-list star-cast, it failed to attract an audience, grossing , and received mixed reviews from critics upon release. It became the sixth highest-grossing film of the year.

For her performance, Kapoor was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the 4th IIFA Awards. &quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot; marked the only film collaboration between Roshan and Mukherji.

== Plot ==
Pooja Sahani, Raj Khanna, and Tina Kapoor are childhood friends. While Raj has always been attracted to Tina, he is unaware that Pooja is secretly in love with him. Raj&#x27;s father decides to move to London with his family because of his work. Before leaving, Raj makes Tina promise to keep in touch with him via e-mail. Tina, who is fun-loving and distracted, does not want the responsibility, so instead of her, Pooja writes to Raj, signing the emails as &quot;Tina&quot; instead of her own name so that Tina can keep her promise to Raj. Over the years, they become close while exchanging e-mails to each other.

15 years later, Raj returns to India for vacation. By now, he is in love with the girl he has been writing to and believes he will recognise her at first sight. So they both decide not to exchange their photographs before his arrival. When the three meet, Raj walks past Pooja, not recognising her as he said he would, but recognises Tina, becoming smitten with her and thinking she wrote him the emails all these years. He does not notice that the real Tina is completely different from the Tina he knew from the emails. Tina later introduces Pooja, and they become friends again. Tina, despite being aware of the fact that she is not the one who Raj has been talking to for years and is also not the one he really loves, gives into his flirting and courting and falls in love with him. Their parents gladly announce their engagement. Heartbroken by this, Pooja decides to never disclose her feelings to anyone.

Raj returns to London, where Pooja travels for an interview. Raj takes Pooja to his favorite church, and she accidentally hums the tune of a song he wrote for her many years ago. Hearing this, Raj instantly realises that Pooja is the one who had been writing to him all those years and remembers all the little things he had shared in the e-mails that she knows about. He tells her she is the one he truly loves, and the two decide to get married. Back in India, Tina&#x27;s father dies, leaving her all alone. His last wish was that Tina would marry Raj, and Pooja&#x27;s parents said that they would perform all the rituals in the absence of Tina&#x27;s parents. Seeing that Tina is alone now, Pooja refuses to marry Raj. Raj is against this and insists on telling his parents the truth, but Pooja stops him. He angrily vows that he will only marry Tina if Pooja marries someone else on the same day.

The families travel to London for Raj and Tina&#x27;s marriage. Rohan Verma, a friend of Raj, meets Pooja during the engagement party of Raj and Tina and is instantly attracted to her. Pooja agrees to marry Rohan to satisfy Raj&#x27;s ultimatum and ensure Tina&#x27;s happiness. On the day of the marriage, Tina realises that Raj is in love with Pooja, as she sees that Raj&#x27;s ancestral family bracelets were a better fit for Pooja&#x27;s wrist than hers. At the altar, Tina confronts Raj and Pooja, saying that she is not alone and is glad to have such great friends who are willing to sacrifice their love for her. The film ends with Pooja and Raj getting married.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
&quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot; marked Kunal Kohli&#x27;s directorial debut in Hindi Cinema. The media reported that the film was based on the 1996 American romantic comedy &quot;The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs&quot;, but Kohli explained that &quot;not one scene from it is the same. There is a track dealing with mistaken identity, but it isn&#x27;t a rip-off.&quot; It was produced by Yash Chopra under the banner of Yash Raj Films, and Aditya Chopra co-wrote the story and screenplay with Kohli. The dialogue was written by Kohli. Neil Nitin Mukesh served as the assistant director.

=== Casting ===
Rani Mukerji, Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor were cast as the leads; it marked the latter two&#x27;s third collaboration, after &quot;Yaadein&quot; (2001) and &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; (2001). Uday Chopra was cast as Rohan opposite Mukerji, in an extended cameo. Barkha Singh played the role of young Tina.

Mukherji, who features as Pooja Sahani, said that she &quot;loved every moment of working&quot; on &quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot;, and described the film as a &quot;privilege&quot; for her. On her equation with Roshan, Mukerji added, &quot;We got along really well. Besides having a similar pattern of working, it is important to establish a comfort level between coactors. &quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge&quot; was one big picnic.&quot;

Roshan portrays Raj Khanna, a part that he compared with his role in &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot; (2000). He spoke of his rapport with Mukherji, claiming that it &quot;was a pleasure working with her. She is very professional, very friendly and easygoing. She leaves all negativity behind when she comes on the sets.&quot; Interviewed by &quot;Rediff.com&quot;, he said that &quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot; was &quot;a very, very intense film&quot;, adding, &quot;The second half is propelled forward by the intensity of my character.&quot; He further stated that the film &quot;more [...] about 3 friends than a love triangle&quot;.

Meanwhile, Kapoor stars as the fun-loving girl Tina Kapoor. She was initially reluctant to star in the film, because she was to play the second lead after Mukherji. However, according to &quot;The Times of India&quot;, Kohli and Chopra convinced her to accept it. She found the role to be &quot;very glamorous, typical of what people would expect of me&quot;, and believed that her fans, especially male, would like it. She noted, &quot;I play a loser, yet emerge the winner. This is not a goody-goody heroine who gets the hero. My role has better scope. I am the life of the film. The other characters are sad most of the time.&quot; To prepare for her introductory scene, the actress did not eat for 3–4 days (this was inconsistently reported) as she wanted to &quot;look great as it involved exposing my midriff&quot;. Moreover, Kapoor confessed that her looks were the main priority while preparing for her role in the film.

=== Filming ===
Made on a budget of , principal photography was handled by Ravi K. Chandran and Gopal Shah. The filming took place in Shimla, Manali, Film City, London and other places in both Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Ahmed Khan was the choreographer, while Manish Malhotra and Rocky Star were the costume designers. While Anuj Mathur designed the sound, Sharmishta Roy served as the art director. After the filming ended, the film was edited by Ritesh Soni and V. Karnik.

The soundtrack for &quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot; was composed by the debutant Rahul Sharma; he accepted the offer in April 2001 when he was on a concert tour with his father Shivkumar Sharma. Rahul Sharma described its soundtrack as &quot;young and fresh&quot;, adding, &quot;[It] is about urban young people, so the music had to be romantic and soft.&quot; He used santoor, flute and an orchestra contains 60 violinists for the background score. In later years, he told &quot;The Hindu&quot; that composing the film&#x27;s soundtrack was a &quot;great&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; experience. The lyrics were written by Anand Bakshi, with vocals performed by Alisha Chinai, Alka Yagnik, Asha Bhosle, Lata Mangeshkar, Udit Narayan, and Sonu Nigam. The soundtrack album was released on 12 June 2002 by Saregama.

=== Critical reception ===
The soundtrack received mixed reviews from music critics; Narendra Kusnur of &quot;Mid-Day&quot; called it &quot;hummable&quot;, and wrote, &quot;Rahul&#x27;s orchestration style is youthful, and the use of guitars is interesting and innovative.&quot; Kusnur, however, felt that &quot;some songs have that typical [Yash] Chopra[&#x27;s] banner flavour that has become very predictable and hackneyed of late&quot;. In a review published in the entertainment portal &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot;, Joginder Tuteja believed that Sharma &quot;does a superb job in churning out a number of melodies in one single package&quot;. &quot;The Hindu&quot; elaborated, &quot;The title song ... is quite hummable. With quite a bit of Western tunes synthesized with Indian, this song is likely to hit the charts. A rather lengthy medley of various Hindi songs from old and new films is inserted.&quot;

=== Charts and sales ===
According to the film-trade website &quot;Box Office India&quot;, with around 1.2 million units sold, the soundtrack became the eleventh highest-selling music album of the year.

== Release ==
Expectations for &quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot; (one of the most-anticipated films of the year) were high, as the film was Kohli&#x27;s debut as a film director, and due to its A-list star cast. It opened on 9 August 2002 and, conversely, emerged as a commercial failure. The film was released on 290 screens across India and grossed on its opening day. It collected in India and $2.6 million overseas. &quot;Box Office India&quot; estimated the film&#x27;s total gross to be and concluded its final commercial performance with the verdict of &quot;flop&quot;. The film&#x27;s world television premiere took place on 7 November 2002 on Zee Cinema, while its DVD version was released on 11 November 2003 in a single-disc pack. It was available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video on 8 March 2017.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
The film opened to mixed reviews; critics were appreciative of the leads&#x27; performances, but harshly criticized its &quot;predictable&quot; plot and &quot;unremarkable&quot; soundtrack.

Writing for Bollywood Hungama, Taran Adarsh gave the film a rating of 1 star, noting that it &quot;clearly belongs to Mukherji, who has the meatiest role comparatively&quot;. He believed that Mukherji was &quot;superb in a role that fits her like a glove&quot;, but thought that Kapoor was &quot;relegated to the background completely&quot;. In a 2.5 star review, Subhash K. Jha saw that &quot;Kohli tries hard to bring in his own touch to the [Yash] Chopra-esque ambience&quot;. Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; said that Kapoor &quot;largely reprises her pampered bimbo&quot; from &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot;, and praised Roshan for &quot;proves a smart mover and good dance talent&quot;. Manish Gajjar of the BBC shared similar thoughts of Kapoor: &quot;[She] as Tina looks ravishingly beautiful and shows great flair for comedy in this film. Although the audience will be reminded of her character of Poo from &quot;Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Outlook&quot; magazine&#x27;s Namrata Joshi, who rated the film 1 star, declared it as &quot;avoidable&quot;; she was highly critical of Roshan, who she deemed &quot;makes a poor parody of himself&quot;. Sukanya Verma opined, &quot;First-time director Kohli is impressive. He keeps a tight grip of the plot and displays a keen attention to screenplay. Every character in the film is well-defined and sound. The film moves at a brisk pace and the audience is not left to pinpoint loopholes.&quot; Madhureeta Mukherjee of &quot;The Times of India&quot; claimed that Mukherji &quot;scores almost full marks for her heart-rending performance&quot;, with &quot;Empire&quot; Omar Ahmed appreciated her for &quot;saving&quot; the film. Khalid Mohammed observed of Kapoor: &quot;Of the cast, [She] is reliably spry and saucy but should take care not to repeat her hoity-toity act if she is to escape typecasting.&quot; S. Ramachandran from &quot;Mid-Day&quot; wrote that &quot;Despite its numerous flaws, a fabulous performance by Roshan, an emotionally-powered role from Mukherji and a sporadically-intense act from Kapoor drive the film&quot;. &quot;Stardust&quot; hailed, &quot;Though Kohli has handled some scenes with sensitivity and maturity he fails in many others, which gives the feeling of &quot;déjà vu&quot;.&quot;

=== Box office ===
&quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot; failed to attract an audience, grossing ₹336.1 million (US$4.2 million), and received mixed reviews from critics upon release. Despite this, It became the sixth highest-grossing film of the year. It is also one of the top earners of the decade in India and at the foreign box office.

==Accolades==
==Legacy==
&quot;Time Out&quot; placed &quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot; at 93rd position in its &quot;The 100 best Bollywood movies&quot; list. &quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot;&#x27;s song &quot;Andekhi Anjaani&quot; was used in a sequence of the 2004 Hindi film &quot;Hum Tum&quot;, a film by Kunal Kohli starring Mukerji and Saif Ali Khan. In 2023, the film was part of the docu-series &quot;The Romantics&quot;, through the segment &quot;The New Guard&quot;.

<doc id="1324835" wikidata="Q719613" url="?curid=1324835" title="Venera 4">
<text>Venera 4 (), also designated 4V-1 No.310, was a probe in the Soviet Venera program for the exploration of Venus. The probe comprised a lander, designed to enter the Venusian atmosphere and parachute to the surface, and a carrier/flyby spacecraft, which carried the lander to Venus and served as a communications relay for it.

In 1967, it was the first successful probe to perform in-place analysis of the environment of another planet. Venera 4 provided the first chemical analysis of the Venusian atmosphere, showing it to be primarily carbon dioxide with a few percents of nitrogen and below one percent of oxygen and water vapors. While entering the atmosphere it became the first spacecraft to survive entry into another planet&#x27;s atmosphere. The station detected a weak magnetic field and no radiation field. The outer atmospheric layer contained very little hydrogen and no atomic oxygen. The probe sent the first direct measurements proving that Venus was extremely hot, that its atmosphere was far denser than expected, and that it had lost most of its water long ago.

==Spacecraft==
The main carrier spacecraft 4 stood high, its solar panels spanned and had an area of . The carrier spacecraft included a long magnetometer, an ion detector, a cosmic ray detector and an ultraviolet spectrometer capable of detecting hydrogen and oxygen gases. The devices were intended to operate until entry into the Venusian atmosphere. At that juncture, the station was designed to release the probe capsule and disintegrate. The rear part of the carrier spacecraft contained a liquid-fuel thruster capable of correcting the flight course. The flight program was planned to include two significant course corrections, for which purpose the station could receive and execute up to 127 different commands sent from the Earth.

The front part of the carrier spacecraft contained a nearly spherical landing capsule in diameter and weighing . Compared to previous (failed) Venera probes, the capsule contained an improved heat shield that could withstand temperatures up to . Instead of the previous liquid-based cooling design, a simpler and more reliable gas system was installed. The durability of the capsule was checked by exposing it to high temperatures, pressures, and accelerations using three unique testing installations. The heat resistance was checked in a high-temperature vacuum system emulating the upper layers of the atmosphere. The capsule was pressurized up to 25 atmospheres. (The surface pressure on Venus was unknown at the time. Estimates ranged from a few to hundreds of atmospheres). Finally, it was subjected to accelerations of up to 450 g in a centrifuge. The centrifuge test caused cracking of electronic components and cable brackets, which were replaced shortly before launch. The timing for the launch was rather tight, so as not to miss the launch window — the days of the year when the path to the destination planet from Earth is energetically least demanding.

The capsule could float in case of a water landing. Considering the possibility of such a landing, its designers made the lock of the capsule using sugar; it was meant to dissolve in liquid water, releasing the transmitter antennas. The capsule contained a newly developed vibration-damping system, and its parachute could resist temperatures up to .

The capsule contained an altimeter, thermal control, a parachute and equipment for making atmospheric measurements. The latter included a thermometer, barometer, hydrometer, altimeter and a set of gas analysis instruments. The data were sent by two transmitters at a frequency of 922 MHz and a rate of 1 bit/s; the measurements were sent every 48 seconds. The transmitters were activated by the parachute deployment as soon as the outside pressure reached , which was thought to occur at the altitude about above the surface of the planet. The signals were received by several stations, including the Jodrell Bank Observatory.

The capsule was equipped with a rechargeable battery with a capacity sufficient for 100 minutes of powering the measurement and transmitter systems. To avoid becoming discharged during the flight to Venus, the battery was kept charged using the solar panels of the carrier spacecraft. Before the launch, the entire Venera 4 station was sterilized to prevent possible biological contamination of Venus.

==Mission==
Two nominally identical 4V-1 probes were launched in June 1967. The first probe, Venera 4, was launched on 12 June by a Molniya-M carrier rocket flying from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. A course correction was performed on 29 July when it was away from Earth; otherwise, the probe would have missed Venus. Although two such corrections had been planned, the first one was accurate enough and therefore the second correction was canceled. On 18 October 1967, the spacecraft entered the Venusian atmosphere with an estimated landing place near . The second probe, Kosmos 167, was launched on 17 June but failed to depart low Earth orbit.

During entry into the Venusian atmosphere, the heat shield temperature rose to and at one point the cabin deceleration reached 300 G. The descent lasted 93 minutes. The capsule deployed its parachute at an altitude of about , and started sending data on pressure, temperature and gas composition back to Earth. The temperature control kept the inside of the capsule at . The temperature at was recorded as , and the pressure as less than . At the end of the descent, the temperature reached and pressure increased to , and the signal transmission terminated. The atmospheric composition was measured as 90–93% carbon dioxide, 0.4–0.8% oxygen, 7% nitrogen and 0.1–1.6% water vapor.

===Radar altimeter===
The altitude of the Venera probe relative to the surface was measured using a radar altimeter operating at 770 MHz. The altimeter had an integer ambiguity of : that is, the same radar signal would be given at an altitude of X, X plus , X plus , etc. (an effect known as &quot;aliasing&quot;). At the time the distance of the cloud tops above the surface was not known, and due to this ambiguity, the first radar return, now believed to be at an actual altitude of about , was initially misinterpreted as . Therefore, based on the misinterpreted radar results, the Soviet team initially announced the probe descended to the surface. This result was quickly dismissed as inconsistent with the planetary diameter measured by radar, and the pressure readings by the capsule were much lower than predicted by the recently developed models of the Venus atmosphere.

===Analysis===
The &quot;Venera 4&quot; data was analyzed together with the data of the &quot;Mariner 5&quot; probe, under a combined Soviet–American working group of COSPAR in 1969, an organization of early space cooperation, allowing a more complete drawing of the profile of the atmosphere of Venus.

==Achievements==
For the first time, &quot;in situ&quot; analysis of the atmosphere of another planet was performed and the data sent back to Earth; the analysis included chemical composition, temperature, and pressure. The measured ratio of carbon dioxide to nitrogen of about 13 corrected the previous estimates so much (an inverse ratio was expected in some quarters) that some scientists contested the observations. The main station detected no radiation belts; relative to Earth, the measured magnetic field was 3000 times weaker, and the hydrogen corona was 1000 times less dense. No atomic oxygen was detected. All the data suggested that water, if it had been present, had leaked from the planet long before. This conclusion was unexpected considering the thick Venusian clouds. Because of the negligible humidity, the sugar lock system, employed on Venera 4 in case of a water landing, was abandoned in subsequent Venus probes.

The mission was considered a complete success, especially given several previous failures of Venera probes. Although the Venera 4 design did allow for data transmission after landing, the Venera 3–6 probes were not built to withstand the pressures at the Venusian surface. The first successful soft landing on Venus was achieved by Venera 7 in 1970.

<text>Venera 5 ( meaning &quot;Venus 5&quot;) was a space probe in the Soviet space program &quot;Venera&quot; for the exploration of Venus.

Venera 5 was launched towards Venus to obtain atmospheric data. The spacecraft was very similar to Venera 4 although it was of a stronger design. The launch was conducted using a Molniya-M rocket, flying from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.

When the atmosphere of Venus was approached, a capsule weighing and containing scientific instruments was jettisoned from the main spacecraft. During satellite descent towards the surface of Venus, a parachute opened to slow the rate of descent. For 53 minutes on 16 May 1969, while the capsule was suspended from the parachute, data from the Venusian atmosphere were returned. It landed at . The spacecraft also carried a medallion bearing the State Coat of Arms of the Soviet Union and a bas-relief of Lenin to the night side of Venus.

Given the results from Venera 4, the Venera 5 and Venera 6 landers contained new chemical analysis experiments tuned to provide more precise measurements of the atmosphere&#x27;s components. Knowing the atmosphere was extremely dense, the parachutes were also made smaller so the capsule would reach its full crush depth before running out of power (as Venera 4 had done).

== Instruments ==
=== Spaceship ===
* Instrument KS-18-3M to study the flows of cosmic particles;
* Instrument LA-2U to determine the distribution of oxygen and hydrogen in the planet&#x27;s atmosphere.

=== Lander ===
* Pressure sensors MDDA A to measure atmospheric pressure in the range of ;
* G-8 gas analyzers to determine the chemical composition of the atmosphere;
* TTI unit to determine the density of the atmosphere at an altitude; 
* FD-69 for atmospheric lighting measurements;
* CE-164D to determine the temperature at the height of the atmosphere.

== Mission ==
Venera 5 was launched into an Earth parking orbit on 5 January 1969 at 06:28:08 UTC and then from a Tyazheliy Sputnik (69-001C) towards Venus. After a mid-course maneuver on 14 March 1969, the probe was released from the bus on 16 May 1969 at a distance of from Venus. The probe entered the nightside atmosphere at 06:01 UTC and when the velocity slowed to 210 m/s the parachute deployed and transmissions to Earth began. The probe sent read-outs every 45 seconds for 53 minutes before finally succumbing to the temperature and pressure at roughly and .

The photometer detected a light level of 250 watts per square meter and confirmed the high temperatures, pressures, and carbon dioxide composition of the atmosphere found by Venera 4.

<text>Venera 8 ( meaning &quot;Venus 8&quot;) was a probe in the Soviet Venera program for the exploration of Venus and was the second robotic space probe to conduct a successful landing on the surface of Venus.

Venera 8 was a Venus atmospheric probe and lander. Its instrumentation included temperature, pressure, and light sensors as well as an altimeter, gamma ray spectrometer, gas analyzer, and radio transmitters.

==Journey to Venus==
The spacecraft took 118 days to reach Venus with one mid-course correction on 6 April 1972, separating from the bus (which contained a cosmic ray detector, solar wind detector, and ultraviolet spectrometer) and entering the atmosphere on 22 July 1972 at 08:37 UT. A refrigeration system attached to the bus was used to pre-chill the descent capsule&#x27;s interior prior to atmospheric entry in order to prolong its life on the surface. Descent speed was reduced from 41,696 km/h to about 900 km/h by aerobraking. The 2.5 meter diameter parachute opened at an altitude of 60 km.

==Descent==
Venera 8 transmitted data during the descent. A sharp decrease in illumination was noted at 35 to 30 km altitude and wind speeds of less than 1 m/s were measured below 10 km. Venera 8 landed at 09:32 UT in what is now called Vasilisa Regio, within 150 km radius of , in sunlight, about 500 km from the morning terminator. The lander mass was 495 kg.

==Lander==
The lander continued to send back data for 50 minutes, 11 seconds after landing before failing due to the harsh surface conditions. The probe confirmed the earlier data on the high Venus surface temperature and pressure (470 degrees Celsius, 90 atmospheres) returned by Venera 7, and also measured the light level as being suitable for surface photography, finding it to be similar to the amount of light on Earth on an overcast day with roughly 1 km visibility.

Venera 8&#x27;s photometer measurements showed for the first time that the Venusian clouds end at a high altitude, and the atmosphere was relatively clear from there down to the surface. The on-board gamma ray spectrometer measured the uranium/thorium/potassium ratio of the surface rock, indicating it was similar to Alkali basalt.

==Payload experiments==

* Temperature and pressure sensors - ITD
* Accelerometer - DOU-1M
* Cadmium sulfide Photometers - IOV-72
* Ammonia analyser – IAV-72
* Gamma ray spectrometer – GS-4
* Radar altimeter Auxiliary thruster
* Radio Doppler experiment

<text>Cloak &amp; Dagger is a 1984 American spy adventure film directed by Richard Franklin, and starring Henry Thomas, Dabney Coleman, and Michael Murphy. It was written by Tom Holland and based on a Cornell Woolrich short story, &quot;The Boy Cried Murder&quot;, which had been filmed as &quot;The Window&quot; (1949). It was originally released in a double feature with &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; on July 13, 1984, and was released separately on August 10, 1984. The film grossed $9.7 million in the United States. Thomas was nominated for the Young Artist Award for Best Actor.

==Plot==
11-year-old Davey Osborne lives in San Antonio, Texas. His father, Hal, is a military air traffic controller who has problems relating to Davey, moreso in the wake of the death of Davey&#x27;s mom/Hal&#x27;s wife. Davey befriends Kim Gardener, a girl living nearby. Davey reveres Jack Flack, who is the main character of &quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot;, an espionage role-playing video game. Davey imagines Jack as a more dashing version of Hal. He wants to live an action-packed life like Jack, carrying around a water pistol as his &quot;gun&quot; and a softball as his &quot;grenade&quot;. Davey spends much time playing the game and spending time with Jack as an imaginary friend.

One day, Davey&#x27;s friend, Morris, who owns a game shop, sends Davey and Kim on an errand, where Davey witnesses a murder. Before dying, the victim gives Davey a &quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot; video game cartridge containing important military secrets that must be given to the FBI. Davey seeks help from the authorities, who do not believe him.

Spies murder Morris and then chase Davey across the city. Along the way, Jack helps Davey evade the pursuers. However, Davey&#x27;s sense of morality and concern for Kim (whom the spies have kidnapped to try and blackmail Davey into handing over the cartridge) collide with Jack&#x27;s harsh methods. Davey is cornered by the spies along the River Walk. During the ensuing fight, Jack urges Davey to lure two spies into the &quot;Crossfire Gambit,&quot; causing one to kill the other. Jack convinces Davey to pick up the gun of a dead spy, but rather than shoot Dr. Rice, the spies&#x27; leader, Davey panics and runs away down a dead-end path. Rice corners Davey, taunting him. When Davey proves unwilling to shoot first, Jack tries to get Rice&#x27;s attention. Standing in front of a blank wall (and holding his Agent-X bulletproof beret for protection), Jack dares Rice to shoot him. Davey looks to Jack, warning him not to do anything, and Rice turns and fires at the wall, thinking &quot;Jack&quot; is a hidden ally. Enraged, Davey fires his pistol, killing Rice.

Realizing that Jack had tricked him into shooting the spy, Davey discards the pistol, pulls the miniature of Jack out of his pocket and breaks it on the concrete. Blood begins to pour from the bullet holes that now riddle Jack&#x27;s body, and he collapses. While regretting the rule, &quot;...leaving when they stop believing&quot;, Jack confesses Davey was always his favorite playmate. Distracting Davey by asking for a smoke, Jack fades and vanishes. When Davey calls to Jack, saying he cannot do it alone, Jack&#x27;s voice reassures him that he always could and tells him to save Kim.

Earlier, Davey had been befriended by an elderly couple who turn out to be enforcers allied with the spies. Davey escapes them, but without the cartridge, and chases the couple to the airport where they attempt to flee the country. At the airport, Davey pretends that they are his parents who are abandoning him. When security intervenes, Davey tells the guard the proof is the cartridge he knows they have. Cornered, the couple kidnap Davey and commandeer a plane, unaware that Davey has brought the bomb which the spies had planned to use to kill Kim. The spies request a pilot, and Hal, who has arrived at the airport with Kim&#x27;s mother, volunteers to be the pilot. As the plane moves to the runway, Davey tries to summon Jack for help; his father hears him and identifies himself as &quot;Jack Flack&quot; and calls Davey to the cockpit. While preparing to escort him, the female enforcer discovers the bomb and panics, calling for her husband. Hal gets Davey out of the plane through the cockpit window. Davey runs after the plane down the runway, calling for his father, until the plane explodes, destroying the cartridge and the enforcers in the process. Then a figure appears and approaches him, looking like the silhouette of Jack Flack before revealing that it is his father. As the two embrace, Davey asks how he managed to escape. Hal replies, &quot;Jack Flack always escapes&quot;.

Davey, joyful that his father is alive, realizes that his father is his true hero and has moved on from Jack. He declares, &quot;I don&#x27;t need him anymore. I got you, Dad&quot;.

==Cast==

==Production==
Henry Thomas said the film was &quot;pretty exciting ... It&#x27;s got some violence in it. I get to fire a gun&quot;.

Principal photography went from August 8 to October 7, 1983. Filming took place in San Antonio, Texas, chosen because it was Thomas&#x27;s hometown. The Alamo exterior was filmed on location, but they were not allowed to film inside, so they recreated the interior.

The film was written specifically for Henry Thomas as a follow-up to his success in &quot;E.T.&quot; Universal felt it was key to utilize Thomas&#x27; exceptional talent while he was young.

In a 2012 interview, Coleman recalled:
==Video game==
Critical to the movie&#x27;s plot is an Atari video game called &quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot; made for the Atari 5200. However, in reality &quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot; is an arcade-only game; no at-home consumer version existed prior to 2022, when the game was included in the compilation &quot;Atari 50&quot;. The illusion of Davey playing an Atari 5200 version was accomplished by outputting the signal from the arcade version into a television set. An Atari 5200 version was planned, but development on it never even started, due to Atari selling its consumer division to Jack Tramiel. The arcade game was under development with the title &quot;Agent X&quot; when the movie producers and Atari learned of each other&#x27;s projects and decided to cooperate. This collaboration was part of a larger phenomenon of films featuring video games as critical plot elements (as with &quot;Tron&quot; and &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot;) and of video game tie-ins to the same films (as with the &quot;Tron&quot; games for the Intellivision and other platforms).

The arcade version was released in a limited run with 139 different machines.

==Reception==
The film was released during the 1984 Summer Olympics. Universal said that the target audience of younger children would not be as interested in Olympics and the film would have less competition. The film grossed $9.7 million in the United States, $2.8 million of which came from its opening weekend.

&quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot; received a 67% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. On her review, Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Franklin&#x27;s direction, as well as the performances of Thomas and Coleman. Metacritic gave the film a score of 64 based on 7 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Neil Gaiman reviewed &quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;director Richard Franklin&#x27;s fascination with Alfred Hitchcock continues; and echoes, lines and themes of Hitchcock films crop up all through this engaging and enjoyable film&quot;.

In the 1996 movie guide &quot;Seen That, Now What?&quot;, the film was given the rating of &quot;B+&quot;, stating &quot;Tight script, quick pace and light but not moronic tone makes this the rare entry that can be responsibly called family fare&quot;.

==Other adaptations==
The Woolrich&#x27;s story has been adapted three more times:
* &quot;The Window&quot; (1949)
* &quot;The Boy Cried Murder&quot; (1966)
* &quot;Eyewitness&quot; (1970)

<text>Venera 13 ( &#x27;Venus 13&#x27;) was part of the Soviet Venera program meant to explore Venus.

Venera 13 and 14 were identical spacecraft built to take advantage of the 1981 Venus launch opportunity. The probes were launched five days apart, with Venera 13 launching on 30 October 1981 at 06:04 UTC and Venera 14 launching on 4 November 1981 at 05:31 UTC. Both had an on-orbit dry mass of 760 kg.

Venera 13 transmitted the first recording of sounds from another planet, including sounds of Venusian wind, the lander hitting the ground, pyrotechnic lens cap removal and its impact on regolith, and action of the regolith drilling apparatus.

The descent lasted for about an hour. Venera 13 landed at 03:57:21 UT at 7.5 S, 303 E, just east of the eastern extension of an elevated region known as Phoebe Regio. The area is composed of bedrock outcrops surrounded by dark, fine-grained soil.

==Design==
===Cruise stage===

As the cruise stage flew by Venus, the bus acted as a data relay for the lander before continuing on to a heliocentric orbit. The probe was equipped with a gamma-ray spectrometer, UV grating monochromator, electron and proton spectrometers, gamma-ray burst detectors, solar wind plasma detectors, and two-frequency transmitters which made measurements before, during, and after the Venus flyby. &quot;The bus continued to provide data until at least 25 April 1983.&quot;

===Descent lander===

The lander was a hermetically-sealed pressure vessel and contained most of the instrumentation and electronics. Mounted on a ring-shaped landing platform and topped by an antenna, the lander was designed similar to earlier Venera 9–12 landers. It carried instruments to take chemical and isotopic measurements, monitor the spectrum of scattered sunlight, and record electric discharges during its descent phase through the Venusian atmosphere. The spacecraft utilized a camera system, an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer, a screw drill and surface sampler, a dynamic penetrometer, and a seismometer to conduct investigations on the surface.

The list of lander experiments and instruments include:
* accelerometer, impact analysis – &quot;Bison-M&quot;
* thermometers, barometers – &quot;ITD&quot;
* spectrometer / directional photometer – &quot;IOAV-2&quot;
* ultraviolet photometer 
* mass spectrometer – &quot;MKh-6411&quot;
* penetrometer / regolith ohmmeter – &quot;PrOP-V&quot;
* chemical redox indicator – &quot;Kontrast&quot;
* 2 color telephotometer cameras – &quot;TFZL-077&quot;
* gas chromatograph – &quot;Sigma-2&quot;
* radio / seismometer – &quot;Groza-2&quot;
* nephelometer – &quot;MNV-78-2&quot;
* hydrometer – &quot;VM-3R&quot;
* x-ray fluorescence spectrometer (aerosol) – &quot;BDRA-1V&quot;
* x-ray fluorescence spectrometer (regolith) – &quot;Arakhis-2&quot;
* regolith drilling apparatus – &quot;GZU VB-02&quot;stabilized oscillator / Doppler radio
* small solar batteries – &quot;MSB&quot;

==Landing==
On 1 March 1982, after launch and a four-month cruise to Venus, the descent vehicle separated from the cruise stage and plunged into the Venusian atmosphere. A parachute deployed once the lander entered the Venusian atmosphere. The parachute detached at about above the surface; simple air braking was used for the final descent.

Venera 13 landed at around at , just east of the eastern extension of an elevated region known as Phoebe Regio, and about northeast of where Venera 14 would land several days later.

The Venera 13 lander was equipped with cameras to photograph the surface and spring-loaded arms to measure the compressibility of regolith. The quartz camera windows were covered by lens caps that popped off after descent.

The landing area was composed of bedrock outcrops surrounded by dark, fine-grained regolith. After landing, the lander began to take a panoramic photograph while a mechanical drilling arm obtained surface samples. The samples were deposited in a hermetically sealed chamber, maintained at and a pressure of about 0.05 atmosphere (5 kPa). Sample composition was determined by the X-ray fluorescence spectrometer to be in the class of weakly-differentiated melanocratic alkaline gabbroids.

Although the lander was designed to function for about 32 minutes, it continued to operate for at least 127 minutes in an environment where the temperature was 457 °C (855 °F) and the pressure was 9.0 MPa (89 standard atmospheres). Data was transmitted by the lander to the satellite, which functioned as a data relay as it flew by Venus.

In order to measure surface wind speed, microphones on the probe recorded atmospheric wind noises (the probe also recorded noises associated with the probe&#x27;s equipment). This was the first recording of sound on another planet. Venera 14 would also make similar recordings.

==Suggested photographic evidence of life==

Leonid Ksanfomaliti[:ru] of Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (a contributor to the Venera mission) and Stan Karaszewski of Karas, suggested signs of life in the Venera images in an article published in &quot;Solar System Research&quot;. According to Ksanfomaliti, certain objects resembled a &quot;disk&quot;, a &quot;black flap&quot; and a &quot;scorpion&quot; which &quot;emerge, fluctuate and disappear&quot;, referring to their changing location on photographs and traces on the ground.

Engineers familiar with the probe have identified the moving &quot;disk&quot; as actually being the two lens caps ejected from the lander. Rather than a single object that had moved between two places, they are simply two inanimate similar-looking objects in different places. The other &quot;objects&quot; are ascribed to image processing artifacts and do not appear in the original photography.

The editors of &quot;Solar System Research&quot; published an editorial comment and a number of commentary articles from other scientists in their September 2012 publication of Issue 5, Volume 46 of the journal. That issue also includes a second article from Ksanfomaliti, in which he claims to identify several other life forms and speculates regarding the apparent rich diversity of life around the landing site.

These claims have been refuted by the Live Science website.

==Post encounter==

The spacecraft bus ended up in a heliocentric orbit where it continued to make observations in the X-ray and gamma ray spectrum. To provide data for the later Vega mission the bus activated its engine on 10 June 1982. The last data published for the probe is from 12 April 1983.

==In fiction==
* The Venera 13 lander appears in the short film &quot;Horses on Mars&quot; (2001) with a message to the main character who is a microbe lost on Venus.
* The &quot;Venera&quot; lander appears in the book &quot;Contact&quot; (Sagan, 1985).

<text>Space Transport Corporation, or STC, was a company based in Forks, Washington whose goal was to commercialize space. The company was founded in 2002 by Eric Meier and Philip Storm. The company planned to provide small payload launch and space tourism services. The company liquidated its assets in February 2005 and was completely defunct by late 2006.

==STC vehicles==

===Spartan===
The Spartan Three Stage Rocket was a vehicle intended to carry payloads of 1 to 5 kg into suborbit. The rocket was tested to 80 km, and commercial launches were planned for 2005.

===Nano-Satellite Orbital Launch Vehicle===
The Nano-Satellite Orbital Launch Vehicle, or N-SOLV, was a vehicle designed to carry a 10 kg payload to orbit. The corporation planned to sell the launch service for under a million United States dollars. The vehicle&#x27;s intended payload was nano-satellites.

===Rubicon I===
Rubicon I was a test vehicle designed to carry 270 kg (or three people) to 100 km for under $200,000. The vehicle was destroyed in August 2004 during a launch test due to a propellant formulation error. Rubicon I, launched by Space Transport Corporation of Forks, Washington, was the only other Ansari X Prize entrant to launch during the entire duration of the prize with the exception of Paul Allen and Burt Rutan&#x27;s winning SpaceShipOne. ABC Nightline featured both the Rubicon I developers and SpaceShipOne&#x27;s winning team in its 2004 presentation of the Ansari X Prize.

===Rubicon II===
The Rubicon II was the replacement to Rubicon I. The design was identical to the Rubicon I, except for a few error fixes. As of November 22, 2004, work on the Rubicon II had ceased in favor of the Spartan.

<doc id="1324867" wikidata="Q1859284" url="?curid=1324867" title="Message passing">
<text>In computer science, message passing is a technique for invoking behavior (i.e., running a program) on a computer. The invoking program sends a message to a process (which may be an actor or object) and relies on that process and its supporting infrastructure to then select and run some appropriate code. Message passing differs from conventional programming where a process, subroutine, or function is directly invoked by name. Message passing is key to some models of concurrency and object-oriented programming.

Message passing is ubiquitous in modern computer software. It is used as a way for the objects that make up a program to work with each other and as a means for objects and systems running on different computers (e.g., the Internet) to interact. Message passing may be implemented by various mechanisms, including channels.

==Overview==
Message passing is a technique for invoking behavior (i.e., running a program) on a computer. In contrast to the traditional technique of calling a program by name, message passing uses an object model to distinguish the general function from the specific implementations. The invoking program sends a message and relies on the object to select and execute the appropriate code. The justifications for using an intermediate layer essentially falls into two categories: encapsulation and distribution.

Encapsulation is the idea that software objects should be able to invoke services on other objects without knowing or caring about how those services are implemented. Encapsulation can reduce the amount of coding logic and make systems more maintainable. E.g., rather than having IF-THEN statements that determine which subroutine or function to call, a developer can just send a message to the object and the object will select the appropriate code based on its type.

One of the first examples of how this can be used was in the domain of computer graphics. There are various complexities involved in manipulating graphic objects. For example, simply using the right formula to compute the area of an enclosed shape will vary depending on if the shape is a triangle, rectangle, ellipse, or circle. In traditional computer programming, this would result in long IF-THEN statements testing what sort of object the shape was and calling the appropriate code. The object-oriented way to handle this is to define a class called codice_1 with subclasses such as codice_2 and codice_3 (which, in turn, have subclasses codice_4 and codice_5) and then to simply send a message to any codice_1 asking it to compute its area. Each codice_1 object will then invoke the subclass&#x27;s method with the formula appropriate for that kind of object.

Distributed message passing provides developers with a layer of the architecture that provides common services to build systems made up of sub-systems that run on disparate computers in different locations and at different times. When a distributed object is sending a message, the messaging layer can take care of issues such as:
* Finding the process using different operating systems and programming languages, at different locations from where the message originated.
* Saving the message on a queue if the appropriate object to handle the message is not currently running and then invoking the message when the object is available. Also, storing the result if needed until the sending object is ready to receive it.
* Controlling various transactional requirements for distributed transactions, e.g. atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) testing the data.

==Synchronous versus asynchronous message passing==
===Synchronous message passing===
Synchronous message passing occurs between objects that are running at the same time. It is used by object-oriented programming languages such as Java and Smalltalk.

Synchronous messaging is analogous to a synchronous function call; just as the function caller waits until the function completes, the sending process waits until the receiving process completes. This can make synchronous communication unworkable for some applications. For example, large, distributed systems may not perform well enough to be usable. Such large, distributed systems may need to operate while some of their subsystems are down for maintenance, etc.

Imagine a busy business office having 100 desktop computers that send emails to each other using synchronous message passing exclusively. One worker turning off their computer can cause the other 99 computers to freeze until the worker turns their computer back on to process a single email.

===Asynchronous message passing===
With asynchronous message passing the receiving object can be down or busy when the requesting object sends the message. Continuing the function call analogy, it is like a function call that returns immediately, without waiting for the called function to complete. Messages are sent to a queue where they are stored until the receiving process requests them. The receiving process processes its messages and sends results to a queue for pickup by the original process (or some designated next process).

Asynchronous messaging requires additional capabilities for storing and retransmitting data for systems that may not run concurrently, and are generally handled by an intermediary level of software (often called middleware); a common type being Message-oriented middleware (MOM).

The buffer required in asynchronous communication can cause problems when it is full. A decision has to be made whether to block the sender or whether to discard future messages. A blocked sender may lead to deadlock. If messages are dropped, communication is no longer reliable.

===Hybrids===
Synchronous communication can be built on top of asynchronous communication by using a Synchronizer. For example, the α-Synchronizer works by ensuring that the sender always waits for an acknowledgement message from the receiver. The sender only sends the next message after the acknowledgement has been received. On the other hand, asynchronous communication can also be built on top of synchronous communication. For example, modern microkernels generally only provide a synchronous messaging primitive and asynchronous messaging can be implemented on top by using helper threads.

==Distributed objects==

Message-passing systems use either distributed or local objects. With distributed objects the sender and receiver may be on different computers, running different operating systems, using different programming languages, etc. In this case the bus layer takes care of details about converting data from one system to another, sending and receiving data across the network, etc. The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol in Unix was an early example of this. With this type of message passing it is not a requirement that sender nor receiver use object-oriented programming. Procedural language systems can be wrapped and treated as large grained objects capable of sending and receiving messages.

Examples of systems that support distributed objects are: Emerald, ONC RPC, CORBA, Java RMI, DCOM, SOAP, .NET Remoting, CTOS, QNX Neutrino RTOS, OpenBinder and D-Bus. Distributed object systems have been called &quot;shared nothing&quot; systems because the message passing abstraction hides underlying state changes that may be used in the implementation of sending messages.


Distributed, or asynchronous, message-passing has additional overhead compared to calling a procedure. In message-passing, arguments must be copied to the new message. Some arguments can contain megabytes of data, all of which must be copied and transmitted to the receiving object.

Traditional procedure calls differ from message-passing in terms of memory usage, transfer time and locality. Arguments are passed to the receiver typically by general-purpose registers requiring no additional storage nor transfer time, or in a parameter list containing the arguments&#x27; addresses (a few bits). Address-passing is not possible for distributed systems since the systems use separate address spaces.

Web browsers and web servers are examples of processes that communicate by message-passing. A URL is an example of referencing a resource without exposing process internals.

A subroutine call or method invocation will not exit until the invoked computation has terminated. Asynchronous message-passing, by contrast, can result in a response arriving a significant time after the request message was sent.

A message-handler will, in general, process messages from more than one sender. This means its state can change for reasons unrelated to the behavior of a single sender or client process. This is in contrast to the typical behavior of an object upon which methods are being invoked: the latter is expected to remain in the same state between method invocations. In other words, the message-handler behaves analogously to a volatile object.

==Mathematical models==
The prominent mathematical models of message passing are the Actor model and Pi calculus. In mathematical terms a message is the single means to pass control to an object. If the object responds to the message, it has a method for that message.

Alan Kay has argued that message passing is more important than objects in OOP, and that objects themselves are often over-emphasized. The live distributed objects programming model builds upon this observation; it uses the concept of a distributed data flow to characterize the behavior of a complex distributed system in terms of message patterns, using high-level, functional-style specifications.

<doc id="1324873" wikidata="Q6666145" url="?curid=1324873" title="Locust Point, Baltimore">
<text>Locust Point is a peninsular neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland. Located in South Baltimore, the neighborhood is entirely surrounded by the Locust Point Industrial Area; the traditional boundaries are Lawrence street to the west and the Patapsco River to the north, south, and east. It once served as a center of Baltimore&#x27;s Polish-American, Irish-American and Italian-American communities; in more recent years Locust Point has seen gradual gentrification with the rehabilitation of Tide Point and Silo Point. The neighborhood is also noted as being the home of Fort McHenry and the western end of its namesake tunnel that carries eight lanes of Interstate 95 under the river.

Locust Point has been called &quot;Baltimore&#x27;s Ellis Island&quot; because the neighborhood was once the third largest point of entry for immigrants to the United States after Ellis Island and the Port of Philadelphia. From 1868 until the closure of the Locust Point piers in 1914, 1.2 million European immigrants entered Baltimore through Locust Point.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

== History ==

In 1776, with the outbreak of the American Revolution, the citizens of the City of Baltimore, assisted by the State of Maryland, dug fortifications at the end of the &quot;Whetstone Point&quot; peninsula that juts into Baltimore Harbor between the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River on the north and the Middle Branch and the Ferry Branch (now the Southern Branche) to the south. This fort was named &quot;Fort Whetstone&quot;. This fort escaped British attack, although it was nearly attacked in August 1777 when a British fleet from New York City sailed up the Chesapeake Bay to the Head of Elk in Cecil County in the northeastern corner of the state. There the ships disembarked troops heading for the new American capital city in Philadelphia, and thus engaged in the Battle of Brandywine and the Battle of Germantown. However, Baltimore was considered safe enough for the Continental Congress to meet in when Philadelphia was overrun.

Later near the war&#x27;s end, French troops under Comte de Rochambeau and the American Continental troops under George Washington marched through the area and they camped for several weeks during their southward movement to trap the army of British General Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781. Hence, Fort Whetstone&#x27;s batteries of cannon never yet had to fire in anger.

In 1789, there was the reorganization of the Federal Government of the United States in 1789 under the new U.S. Constitution, and the establishment of a new U.S. Army and U.S. Department of War. Then starting in 1793 the Fort was rebuilt from scratch. By 1798, a new star-shaped fortification with additional buildings, barracks, storehouses, and bunkers was constructed under the design of French military engineer Jean Foncin, and it was renamed Fort McHenry for James McHenry of Maryland, third U.S. Secretary of War.

When Fort McHenry blocked the attempted invasion of Baltimore&#x27;s inner harbor by British warships in September 1814, it was located on a grassy peninsula that was used for pasture. The grassy but jaggedly shaped peninsula point had been known as Whetstone Point, also the name of a park in London, since it was established as a port of entry by the Maryland Colonial Assembly in 1706, twenty-three years before the establishment of the town. Whetstone Point and the future South Baltimore peninsula was annexed by the City of Baltimore in 1816. The peninsula was renamed Locust Point in 1846, for the locust trees growing on the peninsula.

Many of the streets built here during the later half of the 19th century bear the names of local heroes from the War of 1812. The oldest buildings are from circa 1840-1850, two-story houses on Cuba, Clement, and Towson Streets. Portions of the neighborhood were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

The area of Locust Point was featured in the second season of the HBO cable TV series &quot;The Wire&quot;.

On June 10, 2013, a tornado hit the Locust Point area as a part of a severe storm system sprawling across the East Coast. The tornado caused damage to a warehouse nearby.

== Industry ==
Procter &amp; Gamble chose the Locust Point neighborhood as the location its second East Coast soap manufacturing plant in the late 1920s, reflecting the strengths of Baltimore&#x27;s industrial infrastructure in the early 20th century. By 1990, the Procter and Gamble Baltimore Plant was producing only soaps like Ivory and Camay, and synthetic liquid detergents like Joy, Dawn, and liquid Cascade.

In 1993, Procter &amp; Gamble set aside reserves to fund a major restructuring of the corporation, including plant consolidation. On January 13, 1994, they announced that the Baltimore Plant was one of four that would be closed. The Baltimore Plant ceased production in 1995.

In 1996, A&amp;E International, a Korean firm, purchased the property with the intent to manufacture a specialty liquor for shipping to the Far East. Forced to abandon their plans because of the Asian financial crisis, A&amp;E sold the plant to Struever Bros. Eccles &amp; Rouse, Inc. in 1999.

Struever Brothers Eccles &amp; Rouse rehabilitated the historic waterfront located at the end of Hull Street, calling it Tide Point. It was the first major redevelopment in the neighborhood in decades. When the project was completed in 2002, the former soap factory was turned into Class A office space. It is currently occupied by the sportswear firm Under Armour. Three silos next to the company&#x27;s campus now display murals of Michael Phelps, Ray Lewis and Cal Ripken Jr.

There are two marine terminals of the Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore located within the neighborhood, as well as the massive Domino sugar factory, a reminder that the industrial use of Baltimore Harbor is still a very important component of the local economy.

== Community ==
Locust Point is located in Baltimore City&#x27;s 11th District, with the current district representative Eric Costello. Locust Point is part of Maryland&#x27;s 46th Legislative and State Senate District, with the current state senator Bill Ferguson and current delegates Mark Edelson, Robbyn Lewis, and Luke Clippinger. Locust Point is located in Maryland&#x27;s 3rd congressional district.

Locust Point is home to the Baltimore Museum of Industry, Fort McHenry, and Latrobe Park.. Also located in Locust Point are the Locust Point Recreation Center, a Baltimore Water Taxi stop, South Locust Point Cruise Terminal, and Francis Scott Key Elementary and Middle Grades School.

<text>Jacob Aall (27 July 1773 – 4 August 1844) was a Norwegian politician, historian, landowner and government economist.

He was born the son of Nicolai Benjamin Aall (1739-1798), who was a merchant in Porsgrunn, Norway and owner of Ulefos Manor. He was also the nephew of merchant Jacob Aall (1754-1826).

==Career==
In 1791, Aall began attending a school in Copenhagen, Denmark where he earned a degree in theology in 1795. After graduating, he returned to Norway where he tried working as a cleric, but he felt that his abilities were not well at use and decided to take up other studies. In 1796, he returned to Copenhagen, where he began studying natural science. In 1797, he journeyed to Germany, touring the scientific schools of Leipzig, Kiel and Göttingen. In Germany he became acquainted with the geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner.

In 1799, after spending the winter at the academy of mines in Freiberg, Aall returned to Norway. Following his father&#x27;s death, he invested his patrimony in the purchase of the immense Nes Iron-works in the Arendal ore region. After purchasing the iron-works, the operation became more efficient, but was placed in a difficult position at the outbreak of the English Wars in 1801. However, the business persevered.

In 1814 he took a prominent part in the framing of the free Constitution of Norway, and for fourteen years (1816-1830), he was a leading member of the Storting, the Norwegian National Assembly.

As a writer, he translated and published Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. His &quot;Reminisciences&quot; (1844-1845) is a repository of data concerning the contemporaneous history of the Scandinavian peninsula.

In his later years, Aall increasingly withdrew from public life, and left most of the work at the iron-works to his son.

==Personal life==
In 1799 he married Louise Andrea Stephansen (1779-1825), with whom he had at least one son.

==Legacy==
Aall lent his name to Jacob Aall Street in Oslo.

He was one of the 41 Norwegian citizens who helped make the creation of the University of Oslo (previously named Royal Frederick University) possible through donations.

Aall was bestowed upon the Medal for Bogerdåd, the Order of Vasa and the Order of the Polar Star.

He was a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and the Royal Danish Science Ernes Society.

<text>The Challenge Tour, currently titled as the HotelPlanner Tour for sponsorship reasons and also sometimes referred to as the European Challenge Tour, is the second-tier men&#x27;s professional golf tour in Europe. It is operated by the PGA European Tour and similarly with the main European Tour and the European Senior Tour, some of the events are played outside Europe.

==History==
The tour was introduced in 1986, when the national tours of Sweden, France and Italy became open to foreign players, and was initially called the Satellite Tour. The Order of Merit was introduced in 1989, with the top five players on it winning membership of the European Tour for the following season. The following year the tour was renamed the Challenge Tour, a name already used in 1989. Up to 1993 the Challenge Tour rankings were based on each player&#x27;s best several results, but since 1994 it has been a straightforward money list, with all results counting.

Players who are successful on the Challenge Tour qualify for membership of the European Tour the following year. Twenty players earn direct promotion to the European Tour. Players finishing 21–45 may also gain qualification for occasional low-prize-money European Tour events, but can improve their status through European Tour Qualifying School. Players who win three Challenge Tour events in a season are fast-tracked onto the main tour immediately and are fully exempt the following season, similar to that of the US-based Korn Ferry Tour.

==World ranking points==
Official World Golf Ranking points are awarded for high finishes in Challenge Tour events. Formerly, most events awarded 12 points to the winner, with European Tour dual-ranking events awarding 18 points. The Challenge Tour Grand Final gave 17 points to the winner. 

In 2014, a number of events received slightly higher points totals, with three events earning a minimum of 13 points and the Challenge Tour Grand Final winner receiving 17 points, up from 16.

In January 2025, it was announced that the tour had signed a title sponsorship agreement with HotelPlanner, being renamed as the HotelPlanner Tour.

==Satellite tours==
One competitive level down from the Challenge Tour are five third-level developmental tours, the Alps Tour, the Pro Golf Tour, the PGA EuroPro Tour (ceased in 2022; replaced by the Clutch Pro Tour and the Tartan Pro Tour) and the Nordic Golf League, each of which is based in a different part of Europe. These circuits are known as the satellite tours. The top players not otherwise exempt (five each from the Alps, Pro Golf, and Nordic Golf League, three from the Clutch Tour, two from the Tartan Pro Tour) from the Order of Merit of each of these tours earn status on the Challenge Tour for the following season. The Challenge Tour also offers status to players competing in the European Tour Qualifying School, giving privileges to those who make the 72-hole cut at the final stage but fail to place in the top 20.

In December 2022, it was announced that the Clutch Pro Tour and the Tartan Pro Tour would become official feeder tours to the Challenge Tour; in place of the now defunct PGA EuroPro Tour. The Tartan Pro Tour would offer Challenge Tour status to the leading player on the Order of Merit, whereas the Clutch Pro Tour would offer Challenge Tour status to the top two players on the Order of Merit. In 2024, with inclusion into the OWGR, the Clutch Pro Tour increased the number of Challenge Tour cards to three, with the Tartan Pro Tour increasing the number of cards to two. In 2024, the China Tour offered a Challenge Tour card to the player second in the rankings.

==Schedules==
Originally, the Challenge Tour events were held in Western Europe. In 1991, the five Safari Circuit events in Africa were added. Only the Kenya Open (until 2018) remained a regular event on the tour for more than a few years, although the Zambia Open returned to the tour between 2001 and 2004 as the first Sunshine Tour co-sanctioned event. In 2020, the tour re-entered into South Africa, again co-sanctioning events with the Sunshine Tour. Another African tournament, the Moroccan Golf Classic, was held from 2002 to 2010. The Challenge Tour featured tournaments co-sanctioned with the Tour de las Américas in Latin America from 2003 to 2011.

In 2011, the tour added its first events in Asia, the Gujarat Kensville Challenge in India and the Kazakhstan Open. In 2023, the tour re-expanded their schedule into India, playing two events co-sanctioned alongside the Professional Golf Tour of India. This came after the European Tour had entered into a partnership with the PGTI.

<doc id="1324884" wikidata="Q348741" url="?curid=1324884" title="Cable layer">
<text>A cable layer or cable ship is a deep-sea vessel designed and used to lay underwater cables for telecommunications, for electric power transmission, military, or other purposes. Cable ships are distinguished by large cable sheaves for guiding cable over bow or stern or both. Bow sheaves, some very large, were characteristic of all cable ships in the past, but newer ships are tending toward having stern sheaves only, as seen in the photo of CS &quot;Cable Innovator&quot; at the Port of Astoria on this page. The names of cable ships are often preceded by &quot;C.S.&quot; as in CS &quot;Long Lines&quot;.

The first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid by cable layers in 1857 to 1858. It briefly enabled telecommunication between Europe and North America before misuse resulted in failure of the line. In 1866 the successfully laid two transatlantic cables, securing future communication between the continents.

== Modern cable ships ==
Cable ships have unique requirements related to having long idle periods in port between cable laying or repairs, operation at low speeds or stopped at sea during cable operations, long periods running astern (less frequent as stern layers are now common), high maneuverability, and a fair speed to reach operation areas.

Modern cable ships differ greatly from their predecessors. There are two main types of cable ships: cable repair ships and cable-laying ships. Cable repair ships, like the Japanese &quot;Tsugaru Maru&quot;, tend to be smaller and more maneuverable; they are capable of laying cable, but their primary job is fixing or repairing broken sections of cable. A cable-laying ship, like &quot;Long Lines&quot;, is designed to lay new cables. Such ships are bigger than repair ships and less maneuverable; their cable storage drums are also larger and are set in parallel so one drum can feed into another, allowing them to lay cable much faster. These ships are also generally equipped with a linear cable engine (LCE) that helps them lay cable quickly. By locating the manufacturing plant near a harbor, cable can be loaded into the ship&#x27;s hold as it is being manufactured.

The newest design of cable layers, though, is a combination of cable-laying and repair ships. An example is the only U.S. naval cable layer-repair ship. &quot;Zeus&quot; uses two diesel-electric engines that produce each and can carry her up to . She can lay about of telecommunications cable to a depth of . The purpose of &quot;Zeus&quot; was to be a cable ship that could do anything required of it, so the ship was built to be able to lay and retrieve cable from either the bow or the stern with ease. This design was similar to that of the first cable ship, &quot;Great Eastern&quot;. &quot;Zeus&quot; was built to be as maneuverable as possible so that it could fulfill both roles: as a cable layer or a cable repair ship.

== Equipment ==

To ensure that cable is laid and retrieved properly, specially designed equipment must be used. Different equipment is used on cable-laying ships depending on what their job requires. In order to retrieve damaged or mislaid cable, a grapple system is used to gather cable from the ocean floor. There are several types of grapples, each with certain advantages or disadvantages. These grapples are attached to the vessel via a grapple rope, originally a mix of steel and manila lines, but now made from synthetic materials. This ensures that the line is strong, yet can flex and strain under the weight of the grapple. The line is pulled up by reversing the Linear Cable Engine used to lay the cable.
The most common laying engine in use is the Linear Cable Engine (LCE). The LCE is used to feed the cable down to the ocean floor, but this device can also be reversed and used to bring back up cable needing repair. These engines can feed of cable a minute. Ships are limited to a speed of while laying cable to ensure the cable lies on the sea floor properly and to compensate for any small adjustments in course that might affect the cables&#x27; position, which must be carefully mapped so that they can be found again if they need to be repaired. Linear Cable Engines are also equipped with a brake system that allows the flow of cable to be controlled or stopped if a problem arises. A common system used is a fleeting drum, a mechanical drum fitted with eoduldes (raised surfaces on the drum face) that help slow and guide the cable into the LCE. 
Cable ships also use “plows” that are suspended under the vessel. These plows use jets of high-pressure water to bury cable under the sea floor, which prevents fishing vessels from snagging cables as thrall their nets.

HMTS &quot;Monarch&quot; (renamed CS &quot;Sentinel&quot; 13 October 1970) completed the first transatlantic telephone cable, TAT-1, in 1956 from Scotland to Nova Scotia for Britain&#x27;s General Post Office (GPO).
The Ocean Marine System Group used a cable laying software designed by Makai Ocean Engineering Inc., in five of their cable installation and repair vessels. The MakaiLay software has been used by 90% of the worlds&#x27; global fleet of cable ships. These five OMS vessels were installed with this software on August 23, 2023, to reduce failures during installation and increase reliability, safety, speed, and accuracy:
* CS &quot;Cable Vigilance&quot;
* CS &quot;Île de Ré&quot; (Formerly Alcatel/Alcatel-Lucent/Nokia ship)
* CS &quot;Lodbrog&quot; (Formerly Alcatel/Alcatel-Lucent ship)
* CS &quot;Teneo&quot;
* &quot;Peter Faber&quot; (Formerly Alcatel-Lucent/Nokia ship)
=== Repeaters ===
When coaxial cables were introduced as submarine cables, a new issue with cable-laying was encountered. These cables had periodic repeaters inline with the cable and powered through it. Repeaters overcame significant transmission problems on submarine cables. The difficulty with laying repeaters is that there is a bulge where they are spliced in to the cable and this causes problems passing through the sheave. British ships, such as HMTS &quot;Monarch&quot; and HMTS &quot;Alert&quot; solved the problem by providing a trough for the repeater to bypass the sheave. A rope connected in parallel to the repeater went through the sheave which pulled the cable back in to the sheave after the repeater had passed. It was normally necessary for the ship to slow down while the repeater was being laid. American ships, for a time, tried using flexible repeaters which passed through the sheave. However, by the 1960s they were also using rigid repeaters similar to the British system.

Another issue with coaxial repeaters is that they are much heavier than the cable. To ensure that they sink at the same rate as the cable (which can take some time to reach the bottom) and keep the cable straight, the repeaters are fitted with parachutes.

==List of cable ships==


* &quot;Princess Clementine&quot; was a passenger ferry, in 1849, installed of cable from the coast of Folkestone to the shoreline of railway telegraph lines. Charles Vincent Walker of the South Eastern Railway Company conceived this cable for to have ship to shore telegraph messages communications.
* &quot;Goliath&quot;, the first ship to lay an ocean cable in 1850. Done for the Submarine Telegraph Company across the English Channel.
* &quot;Blazer&quot;, the hulk vessel laid the South Foreland and Sangatte cable by Submarine Telegraph Company in 1851.
* &quot;Red Rover&quot; in 1851, a steam tug, worked on the South Foreland and Sangatte replacement cable with new section of armored cable.
* HMS &quot;Widgeon&quot; in 1851, the vessel provided a slice at sea on the new section cable of South Foreland and Sangatte with the failed rendezvous with Red Rover.
* (1830–1883), first ship to be permanently fitted out as a cable ship
* (1852–1870) a converted British warship, involved in the first Ireland and US cabling of 1857. Cable laying began off Ireland&#x27;s Ballycarbery Castle in County Kerry. During this operation, of cable were stored on each ship, but of cable was lost over a region known as Telegraph Plateau in the North Atlantic with depths nearly . Attempts with USS &quot;Niagara&quot; failed twice that year and work was abandoned, until next year, both ships met in the mid-Atlantic for spicing of their cables and HMS &quot;Agamemnon&quot; traveled east towards Valentia Island.

<text>Lynda Bird Johnson Robb (born March 19, 1944) is the elder daughter of the 36th U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson. She served as chairwoman of the Board of Reading is Fundamental, the nation&#x27;s largest children&#x27;s literacy organization, as well as chairwoman of the President&#x27;s Advisory Committee for Women. She is a magazine editor who served as First Lady of Virginia from 1982 to 1986, and as Second Lady of Virginia from 1978 to 1982. She is the oldest living child of a U.S. president, following the death of John Eisenhower on December 21, 2013.

==Biography==

When Lynda Bird Johnson was born, her mother Lady Bird had suffered three miscarriages and her doctor spoke pessimistically of her chances of having any more children, so her father suggested that she be named for both her parents. Thus, the name &quot;Lynda Bird&quot;.

Johnson was engaged to Bernard Rosenbach before she met the actor George Hamilton, who himself had been engaged to Susan Kohner. In 1966, Johnson and Hamilton began dating. Because of an increase in Secret Service protection of Presidential relatives resulting from the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Hamilton-Johnson couple was one of the first to be protected by Secret Service agents.

Johnson later married U.S. Marine Corps Captain Charles S. Robb, son of Frances Howard (Woolley) and James Spittal Robb, in the East Room of the White House in 1967 in a service celebrated by the Right Reverend Gerald Nicholas McAllister. Her husband served with distinction in Vietnam. Charles Robb was later elected Lieutenant Governor of Virginia (1978–1982), Governor of Virginia (1982–1986), and US Senator from Virginia (1989–2001).

On May 9, 1979, President Jimmy Carter appointed Lynda Bird Johnson Robb to chair the President&#x27;s Advisory Committee for Women. The committee of 30 worked to carry out Carter&#x27;s mandate to promote equality for women in the cultural, social, economic, and political life of the United States.

Robb served as chairwoman of the board of Reading is Fundamental (1996–2001), the nation&#x27;s largest children&#x27;s literacy organization. She continues to serve the organization as Chairwoman &quot;Emerita&quot;. She was a contributing editor to &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot; magazine (1969–81). She serves on the board of directors of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation and the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center.

Robb was educated at the National Cathedral School for Girls, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, and was a member of Zeta Tau Alpha sorority. She also briefly attended Mercy College. She holds an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Washington and Lee University and Norwich University and has been honored with a plethora of civic awards for her public service.

She has three daughters, Lucinda Desha Robb (born 1968), Catherine Lewis Robb (born 1970) and Jennifer Wickliffe Robb (born 1978), and five grandchildren.

In 2004, Robb attended the state funeral of President Ronald Reagan, on behalf of her mother, who was unable to attend because of poor health. She again represented her mother at the state funeral of President Gerald Ford, who died December 26, 2006. In 2018, Robb attended the state funeral of George H. W. Bush alongside her husband Charles Robb, her sister Luci Baines Johnson and her brother-in-law Ian Turpin.

<doc id="1324893" wikidata="Q7959093" url="?curid=1324893" title="Wade Miller">
<text>Wade Thomas Miller (born September 13, 1976) is an American former professional baseball starting pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros (–), Boston Red Sox (), and Chicago Cubs (–). He batted and threw right-handed. Miller attended Brandywine Heights High School in Topton, Pennsylvania. He is currently Alvernia University&#x27;s pitching coach, a position he assumed in 2012.

==Career==
Miller was drafted out of Alvernia University (Reading, PA) by the Houston Astros, in 1996. He won 45 games in a three-year period for the Astros. Miller was one of the best young pitchers in the National League (NL) before injuring the rotator cuff in his pitching shoulder in 2004.

Miller went 16–8 with 183 strikeouts and a 3.40 earned run average (ERA) in . A year later, he was close behind at 15–4, 144, 3.35, and tied the club record with a 12-game winning streak over the summer. Miller then pitched through right forearm pain in , but still was 14–13, 161, 4.13, and led his team in starts (33) and innings (187.1).

In 2004, Miller was 7–7 with 74 strikeouts and a 3.35 ERA in 15 starts before going on the disabled list in June with a season-ending rotator cuff injury. The Astros believed he was playing hurt with shoulder and elbow injuries much of the year before, but Miller never complained about them.

A free agent before the 2005 season, Miller was signed by the Boston Red Sox. He started the year on the disabled list. The acquisition paid off well when Miller was activated on May 8, while starters Curt Schilling and David Wells spent time on the DL. Miller finished the 2005 campaign with a record of 4–4 and a 4.95 ERA.

On January 23, , the Chicago Cubs signed Miller to a one-year, $1 million contract, with $1 million more in incentives. He made his first start of the 2006 season on September 9. Overall, Miller made five starts in 2006, finishing with a record of 0–2 with a 4.57 ERA. He filed for free agency after the season.

On November 9, 2006, Miller signed an incentive-laden, $1.5 million one-year extension to stay with the Cubs under new manager Lou Piniella. However, after three unsuccessful starts where he compiled a 10-plus ERA, Miller was once again placed on the DL in July 2007. He was placed on waivers granting his unconditional release from the Cubs in August .

On March 7, 2009, Miller agreed to a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. He retired from baseball, following that season.

In a nine-year MLB career, Miller compiled a 62–46 record with 749 strikeouts and a 4.10 ERA in innings pitched.

==After baseball==
Miller was inducted into the Reading Baseball Hall of Fame on July 21, 2011.

<doc id="1324895" wikidata="Q15276" url="?curid=1324895" title="Bulk carrier">
<text>A bulk carrier or bulker is a merchant ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo—such as grain, coal, ore, steel coils, and cement—in its cargo holds. Since the first specialized bulk carrier was built in 1852, economic forces have led to increased size and sophistication of these ships. Today&#x27;s bulk carriers are specially designed to maximize capacity, safety, efficiency, and durability.

Today, bulk carriers make up 21 percent of the world&#x27;s merchant fleets, and they range in size from single-hold mini-bulk carriers to mammoth ore ships able to carry 400,000 metric tons of deadweight (DWT). A number of specialized designs exist: some can unload their own cargo, some depend on port facilities for unloading, and some even package the cargo as it is loaded. Over half of all bulk carriers have Greek, Japanese, or Chinese owners, and more than a quarter are registered in Panama. South Korea is the largest single builder of bulk carriers, and 82 percent of these ships were built in Asia.

On bulk carriers, crews are involved in operation, management, and maintenance of the vessel, taking care of safety, navigation, maintenance, and cargo care, in accordance with international maritime legislation. Crews can range in size from three people on the smallest ships to over 30 on the largest.

Cargo loading operations vary in complexity, and loading and discharging of cargo can take several days. Bulk carriers can be gearless (dependent upon terminal equipment) or geared (having cranes integral to the vessel). 

Bulk cargo can be very dense, corrosive, or abrasive. This can present safety problems that can threaten a ship: problems such as cargo shifting, spontaneous combustion, and cargo saturation. The use of old ships that have corrosion problems—as well as the bulk carriers&#x27; large hatchways—have been linked to a spate of bulk carrier sinkings in the 1990s. These large hatchways, important for efficient cargo handling, can allow the entry of large volumes of water in storms and accelerate sinking once a vessel has listed or heeled. New international regulations have since been introduced to improve ship design and inspection and to streamline the process for crews to abandon ship.

== Definition ==

The term bulk carrier has been defined in varying ways. As of 1999, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea defines a bulk carrier as &quot;a ship constructed with a single deck, top side tanks and hopper side tanks in cargo spaces and intended to primarily carry dry cargo in bulk; an ore carrier; or a combination carrier.&quot; Most classification societies use a broader definition, by which a bulk carrier is any ship that carries dry unpackaged goods. Multipurpose cargo ships can carry bulk cargo, but can also carry other cargoes and are not specifically designed for bulk carriage. The term &quot;dry bulk carrier&quot; is used to distinguish bulk carriers from bulk liquid carriers such as oil, chemical, or liquefied petroleum gas carriers. Very small bulk carriers are almost indistinguishable from general cargo ships, and they are often classified based more on the ship&#x27;s use than its design.

A number of abbreviations are used to describe bulk carriers. &quot;OBO&quot; describes a bulk carrier that carries a combination of ore, bulk, and oil, and &quot;O/O&quot; is used for combination oil and ore carriers. The terms &quot;VLOC&quot;, &quot;VLBC&quot;, &quot;ULOC&quot;, and &quot;ULBC&quot; for very large and ultra-large ore and bulk carriers were adapted from the supertanker designations very large crude carrier and ultra-large crude carrier.

== History ==
Before specialized bulk carriers were developed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, and put the pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend time and money to build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.

Specialized bulk carriers began to appear as steam-powered ships became more popular. The first steam ship recognized as a bulk carrier was the British collier &quot;John Bowes&quot;, built in 1852. She featured a metal hull, a steam engine, and a ballasting system which used seawater instead of sandbags. These features helped her succeed in the competitive British coal market. The first self-unloader was the lake freighter &quot;Hennepin&quot; in 1902 on the Great Lakes. This greatly decreased the unloading time of bulk carriers by using conveyor belt to move the cargo. The first bulk carriers with diesel propulsion began to appear in 1911.

Before World War II, the international shipping demand for bulk products was low—about 25 million tons for metal ores—and most of this trade was coastal. However, on the Great Lakes, bulk carriers hauled vast amounts of iron ore from Minnesota and Michigan&#x27;s northern mines to the steel mills. In 1929, 73 million tons of iron ore was transported on the Lakes, and an almost equal amount of coal, limestone, and other products were also moved. Two defining characteristics of bulk carriers were already emerging: the double bottom, which was adopted in 1890, and the triangular structure of the ballast tanks, which was introduced in 1905. After World War II, an international bulk trade began to develop among industrialized nations, particularly between the European countries, the United States and Japan. Due to the economics of this trade, ocean bulk carriers became larger and more specialized. In this period, Great Lakes freighters increased in size, to maximize economies of scale, and self-unloaders became more common to cut turnaround time. The thousand-footers of the Great Lakes fleets, built in the 1970s, were among the longest ships afloat, and, in 1979, a record 214 million tons of bulk cargo were moved on the Great Lakes.

== Categories ==

=== Size categories ===

Bulk carriers are segregated into six major size categories: small, handysize, handymax, panamax, capesize, and very large. Very large bulk and ore carriers fall into the capesize category but are often considered separately.

====Categories as per regions====
Categories occur in regional trade, such as Kamsarmax, Seawaymax, Setouchmax, Dunkirkmax, and Newcastlemax also appear in regional trade.
* &quot;Kamsarmax&quot;: Maximum length overall 229 meters refers to a new type of ship, larger than panamax, that is suitable for berthing at the Port of Kamsar (Republic of Guinea), where the major loading terminal of bauxite is restricted to vessels not more than 229 meters.
* &quot;Newcastlemax&quot;: Maximum beam 50 meters, and maximum length overall of 300 meters Refers to the largest vessel able to enter the port of Newcastle, Australia at about 185,000 DWT
* &quot;Setouchmax&quot;: About 203,000 DWT, being the largest vessels able to navigate the Setouchi Sea, Japan
* &quot;Seawaymax&quot;: LOA 226 m max / 7.92 m draft. Refers to the largest vessel that can pass through the canal locks of the St. Lawrence Seaway (Great Lakes, Canada)
* &quot;Malaccamax&quot;: LOA 330 m / 20 m draft / 300,000 DWT, Refers to the largest vessel that can pass through the Straits of Malacca.
* &quot;Dunkirkmax&quot;: Maximum allowable beam = 45 m / LOA 289 m. max (175,000 DWT approx) for the eastern harbour lock in the Port of Dunkirk (France)

Mini-bulk carriers are prevalent in the category of small vessels with a capacity of under . Mini-bulk carriers carry from 500 to 2,500 tons, have a single hold, and are designed for river transport. They are often built to be able to pass under bridges and have small crews of three to eight people.

Handysize and Handymax ships are general purpose in nature. These two segments represent 71% of all bulk carriers over and also have the highest rate of growth. This is partly due to new regulations coming into effect which put greater constraints on the building of larger vessels. Handymax ships are typically 150–200 m in length and 52,000 with five cargo holds and four cranes. These ships are also general purpose in nature.

The size of a Panamax vessel is limited by the Panama canal&#x27;s lock chambers, which can accommodate ships with a beam of up to 32.31 m, a length overall of up to 294.13 m, and a draft of up to 12.04 m.

Capesize ships are too large to traverse the Panama canal and must round Cape Horn to travel between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Earlier, Capesize ships could not traverse the Suez and needed to go around the Cape of Good Hope. Recent deepening of the Suez canal to 66 ft (20 m) permits most Capesize ships to pass through it.

Capesize bulk carriers are specialized: 93% of their cargo is iron ore and coal. Some ships on the Great Lakes Waterway exceed Panamax dimensions but they are limited to use on the Great Lakes as they cannot pass through the smaller St. Lawrence Seaway to the ocean. Very large ore carriers and very large bulk carriers are a subset of the capesize category reserved for vessels over . Carriers of this size are almost always designed to carry iron ore.

In October 2022, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL)&#x27;s bulk carrier &quot;Shofu Maru&quot; arrived in Newcastle on its maiden voyage, becoming the first bulk carrier to be partially powered by hard sail wind power propulsion technology. A five percent fuel savings was anticipated.

=== General types ===
== Fleet characteristics ==

The world&#x27;s bulk transport has reached immense proportions: in 2005, 1.7 billion metric tons of coal, iron ore, grain, bauxite, and phosphate was transported by ship. Today, the world&#x27;s bulk carrier fleet includes 6,225 ships of over 10,000 DWT, and represent 40% of all ships in terms of tonnage and 39.4% in terms of vessels. Including smaller ships, bulk carriers have a total combined capacity of almost 346 million DWT. Combined carriers are a very small portion of the fleet, representing less than 3% of this capacity. The lake freighters of the Great Lakes, with 98 ships of 3.2 million total DWT, despite forming a small fraction of the total fleet by tonnage and only operating 10 months a year, carried a tenth of the world&#x27;s bulk cargo because of the short trip distance and fast turnarounds.

As of 2005, the average bulk carrier was just over 13 years old. About 41% of all bulk carriers were less than ten years old, 33% were over twenty years old, and the remaining 26% were between ten and twenty years of age. All of the 98 bulk carriers registered in the Great Lakes trade are over 20 years old and the oldest still sailing in 2009, the St. Mary&#x27;s Challenger, was 106 years old.

=== Flag states ===
As of 2005, the United States Maritime Administration counted 6,225 bulk carriers of or greater worldwide. More bulk carriers are registered in Panama, with 1,703 ships, more than any four other flag states combined. In terms of the number of bulk carriers registered, the top five flag states also include Hong Kong with 492 ships, Malta (435), Cyprus (373), and China (371). Panama also dominates bulk carrier registration in terms of deadweight tonnage. Positions two through five are held by Hong Kong, Greece, Malta, and Cyprus.

=== Largest fleets ===
Greece, Japan, and China are the top three owners of bulk carriers, with 1,326, 1,041, and 979 vessels respectively. These three nations account for over 53% of the world&#x27;s fleet.

Several companies have large private bulk carrier fleets. The multinational company Gearbulk Holding Ltd. has over 70 bulk carriers. The Fednav Group in Canada operates a fleet of over 80 bulk carriers, including two designed to work in Arctic ice. Croatia&#x27;s Atlantska Plovidba d.d. has a fleet of 14 bulk carriers. The H. Vogemann Group in Hamburg, Germany operates a fleet of 19 bulk carriers. Portline in Portugal, owns 10 bulk carriers. Dampskibsselskabet Torm in Denmark and Elcano in Spain also own notable bulk carrier fleets. Other companies specialize in mini-bulk carrier operations: England&#x27;s Stephenson Clarke Shipping Limited owns a fleet of eight mini-bulk carriers and five small Handysize bulk carriers, and Cornships Management and Agency Inc. in Turkey owns a fleet of seven mini-bulk carriers.

=== Builders ===
Asian companies dominate the construction of bulk carriers. Of the world&#x27;s 6,225 bulk carriers, almost 62% were built in Japan by shipyards such as Oshima Shipbuilding and Sanoyas Hishino Meisho. South Korea, with notable shipyards Daewoo and Hyundai Heavy Industries, ranked second among builders, with 643 ships. The People&#x27;s Republic of China, with large shipyards such as Dalian, Chengxi, and Shanghai Waigaoqiao, ranked third, with 509 ships. Taiwan, with shipyards such as China Shipbuilding Corporation, ranked fourth, accounting for 129 ships. Shipyards in these top four countries built over 82% of the bulk carriers afloat.

=== Freight charges ===

Several factors affect the cost to move a bulk cargo by ship. The bulk freight market is very volatile, with the type of cargo, size of the vessel, and the route traveled all affecting the final price. Moving a capesize load of coal from South America to Europe cost anywhere from $15 to $25 per ton in 2005. Hauling a panamax-sized load of aggregate materials from the Gulf of Mexico to Japan that year could cost as little as $40 per ton to as much as $70 per ton.

Some shippers choose instead to charter a ship, paying a daily rate instead of a set price per ton. In 2005, the average daily rate for a Handymax ship varied between $18,000$30,000. A Panamax ship could be chartered for $20,000$50,000 per day, and a Capesize for $40,000$70,000 per day.

=== Ship breaking ===
Generally, ships are removed from the fleet by going through a process known as ship breaking or scrapping. Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship&#x27;s empty weight (called light ton displacement or LDT) and prices in the scrap metal market. In 1998, almost 700 ships were scrapped in places like Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh. This is often done by &#x27;beaching&#x27; the ship on open sand, then cutting it apart by hand with gas torches, a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities, as well as exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and various chemicals. Half a million deadweight tons worth of bulk carriers were scrapped in 2004, accounting for 4.7% of the year&#x27;s scrapping. That year, bulk carriers fetched particularly high scrap prices, between $340 and $350 per LDT.
== Operation ==

=== Crew ===

The crew on a bulk carrier typically consists of 20 to 30 people, though smaller ships can be handled by 8. The crew includes the captain or master, the deck department, the engine department, and the steward&#x27;s department. The practice of taking passengers aboard cargo ships, once almost universal, is very rare today and almost non-existent on bulk carriers.

During the 1990s, bulk carriers were involved in an alarming number of shipwrecks. This led ship-owners to commission a study seeking to explain the effect of various factors on the crew&#x27;s effectiveness and competence. The study showed that crew performance aboard bulk carriers was the lowest of all groups studied. Among bulk carrier crews, the best performance was found aboard younger and larger ships. Crews on better-maintained ships performed better, as did crews on ships where fewer languages were spoken.

Fewer deck officers are employed on bulk carriers than on similarly sized ships of other types. A mini-bulk carrier carries two to three deck officers, while larger Handysize and Capesize bulk carriers carry four. Liquid natural gas tankers of the same size have an additional deck officer and unlicensed mariner.

=== Voyages ===
A bulk carrier&#x27;s voyages are determined by market forces; routes and cargoes often vary. A ship may engage in the grain trade during the harvest season and later move on to carry other cargoes or work on a different route. Aboard a coastal carrier in the tramp trade, the crew will often not know the next port of call until the cargo is fully loaded.

Because bulk cargo is so difficult to discharge, bulk carriers spend more time in port than other ships. A study of mini-bulk carriers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulk carrier spends 55 hours at a time in port, compared to 35 hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74 hours for Handymax and 120 hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulk carrier crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.
=== Loading and unloading ===
Loading and unloading a bulk carrier is time-consuming and dangerous. The process is planned by the ship&#x27;s chief mate under the direct and continued supervision of ship&#x27;s captain. International regulations require that the captain and terminal master agree on a detailed plan before operations begin. Deck officers and stevedores oversee the operations. Occasionally loading errors are made that cause a ship to capsize or break in half at the pier.

The loading method used depends on both the cargo and the equipment available on the ship and on the dock. In the least advanced ports, cargo can be loaded with shovels or bags poured from the hatch cover. This system is being replaced with faster, less labor-intensive methods. Double-articulation cranes, which can load at a rate of 1,000 tons per hour, represent a widely used method, and the use of shore-based gantry cranes, reaching 2,000 tons per hour, is growing. A crane&#x27;s discharge rate is limited by the bucket&#x27;s capacity (from 6 to 40 tons) and by the speed at which the crane can take a load, deposit it at the terminal and return to take the next. For modern gantry cranes, the total time of the grab-deposit-return cycle is about 50 seconds.

Conveyor belts offer a very efficient method of loading, with standard loading rates varying between 100 and 700 tons per hour, although the most advanced ports can offer rates of 16,000 tons per hour. Start-up and shutdown procedures with conveyor belts, though, are complicated and require time to carry out. Self-discharging ships use conveyor belts with load rates of around 1,000 tons per hour.

Once the cargo is discharged, the crew begins to clean the holds. This is particularly important if the next cargo is of a different type. The immense size of cargo holds and the tendency of cargoes to be physically irritating add to the difficulty of cleaning the holds. When the holds are clean, the process of loading begins.

It is crucial to keep the cargo level during loading in order to maintain stability. As the hold is filled, machines such as excavators and bulldozers are often used to keep the cargo in check. Leveling is particularly important when the hold is only partly full, since cargo is more likely to shift. Extra precautions are taken, such as adding longitudinal divisions and securing wood atop the cargo. If a hold is full, a technique called tomming is used, which involves digging out a hole below the hatch cover and filling it with bagged cargo or weights.

== Architecture ==
A bulk carrier&#x27;s design is largely defined by the cargo it will carry. The cargo&#x27;s density, also known as its stowage factor, is the key factor. Densities for common bulk cargoes vary from 0.6 tons per cubic meter for light grains to 3 tons per cubic meter for iron ore.

The overall cargo weight is the limiting factor in the design of an ore carrier, since the cargo is so dense. Coal carriers, on the other hand, are limited by overall volume, since most bulk carriers can be completely filled with coal before reaching their maximum draft.

For a given tonnage, the second factor which governs the ship&#x27;s dimensions is the size of the ports and waterways it will travel to. For example, a vessel that will pass the Panama Canal will be limited in its beam and draft. For most designs, the ratio of length-to-width ranges between 5 and 7, with an average of 6.2. The ratio of length-to-height will be between 11 and 12.

=== Machinery ===

The engine room on a bulk carrier is usually near the stern, under the superstructure. Larger bulk carriers, from Handymax up, usually have a single two-stroke low-speed crosshead diesel engine directly coupled to a fixed-pitch propeller. Electricity is produced by auxiliary generators and/or an alternator coupled to the propeller shaft. On the smaller bulk carriers, one or two four-stroke diesels are used to turn either a fixed or controllable-pitch propeller via a reduction gearbox, which may also incorporate an output for an alternator. The average design ship speed for bulk carriers of Handysize and above is . The propeller speed is relatively low, at about 90 revolutions per minute, although it depends on the size of the propeller.

As a result of the 1973 oil crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, and the resulting rise in oil prices, experimental designs using coal to fuel ships were tested in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Australian National Lines (ANL) constructed two 74,700-ton coal-burner ships called &quot;River Boyne&quot; and &quot;River Embely&quot;. along with two constructed by TNT called &quot;TNT Capricornia&quot; and &quot;TNT Capentaria&quot; and renamed &quot;Fitzroy River&quot; and &quot;Endeavor River&quot;. These ships were financially effective for the duration of their lives, and their steam engines were able to generate a shaft-power of . This strategy gave an interesting advantage to carriers of bauxite and similar fuel cargoes, but suffered from poor engine yield compared to higher maintenance cost and efficient modern diesels, maintenance problems due to the supply of ungraded coal, and high initial costs.

=== Hatches ===
A hatch or hatchway is the opening at the top of a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship&#x27;s breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.

As recently as the 1950s, hatches had wooden covers that would be broken apart and rebuilt by hand, rather than opened and closed. Newer vessels have hydraulic-operated metal hatch covers that can often be operated by one person. Hatch covers can slide forwards, backwards, or to the side, lift up or fold up. It is essential that the hatch covers be watertight: unsealed hatches lead to accidental cargo hold flooding, which has caused many bulk carriers to sink.

Regulations regarding hatch covers have evolved since the investigation following the loss of the . The Load Line Conference of 1966 imposed a requirement that hatch covers be able to withstand load of 1.74 tons/m2 due to sea water, and a minimum scantling of 6 mm for the tops of the hatch covers. The International Association of Classification Societies then increased this strength standard by creating its &quot;Unified Requirement S21&quot; in 1998. This standard requires that the pressure due to sea water be calculated as a function of freeboard and speed, especially for hatch covers located on the forward portion of the ship.

=== Hull ===

Bulk carriers are designed to be easy to build and to store cargo efficiently. To facilitate construction, bulk carriers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulk carriers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship&#x27;s carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty is one way to measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.

Bulk carriers have a cross-section typical of most merchant ships. The upper and lower corners of the hold are used as ballast tanks, as is the double bottom area. The corner tanks are reinforced and serve another purpose besides controlling the ship&#x27;s trim. Designers choose the angle of the corner tanks to be less than that of the angle of repose of the anticipated cargoes. This greatly reduces side-to-side movement, or &quot;shifting,&quot; of cargo which can endanger the ship.

The double bottoms are also subject to design constraints. The primary concern is that they be high enough to allow the passage of pipes and cables. These areas must also be roomy enough to allow people safe access to perform surveys and maintenance. On the other hand, concerns of excess weight and wasted volume keep the double bottoms very tight spaces.

Bulk carrier hulls are made of steel, usually mild steel. Some manufacturers have preferred high-tensile steel recently in order to reduce the tare weight. However, the use of high-tensile steel for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull&#x27;s rigidity and resistance to corrosion. Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions are made of corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of bulk carrier hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.

Double hulls have become popular in the past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds primarily to its breadth, since bulk carriers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship&#x27;s capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.

A recent design, called Hy-Con, seeks to combine the strengths of single-hull and double-hull construction. Short for Hybrid Configuration, this design doubles the forward-most and rear-most holds and leaves the others single-hulled. This approach increases the ship&#x27;s solidity at key points, while reducing the overall tare weight.

Since the adoption of double hull has been more of an economic than a purely architectural decision, some argue that double-sided ships receive fewer comprehensive surveys and suffer more from hidden corrosion. In spite of opposition, double hulls became a requirement for Panamax and Capesize vessels in 2005.

Freighters are in continual danger of &quot;breaking their backs&quot; and thus longitudinal strength is a primary architectural concern. A naval architect uses the correlation between longitudinal strength and a set of hull thicknesses called scantlings to manage problems of longitudinal strength and stresses. A ship&#x27;s hull is composed of individual parts called &quot;members.&quot; The set of dimensions of these members is called the ship&#x27;s scantlings. Naval architects calculate the stresses a ship can be expected to be subjected to, add in safety factors, and then can calculate the required scantlings.

These analyses are conducted when traveling empty, loading and unloading, when partially and fully loaded, and under conditions of temporary overloading. Places subject to the largest stresses are studied carefully, such as hold-bottoms, hatch-covers, bulkheads between holds, and the bottoms of ballast tanks. Great Lakes bulk carriers also must be designed to withstand springing, or developing resonance with the waves, which can cause fatigue fractures.

Since 1 April 2006, the International Association of Classification Societies has adopted the &quot;Common Structural Rules.&quot; The rules apply to bulk carriers more than 90 meters in length and require that scantlings&#x27; calculations take into account items such as the effect of corrosion, the harsh conditions often found in the North Atlantic, and dynamic stresses during loading. The rules also establish margins for corrosion, from 0.5 to 0.9 mm.

== Safety ==
The 1980s and 1990s were a very unsafe time for bulk carriers. Many bulk carriers sank during this time; 99 were lost between 1990 and 1997 alone. Most of these sinkings were sudden and quick, making it impossible for the crew to escape: more than 650 sailors were lost during this same period. Due partly to the sinking of , a series of international safety resolutions regarding bulk carriers were adopted during the 1990s.

=== Stability problems ===
Cargo shifting poses a great danger for bulk carriers. The problem is even more pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between the top of the cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then free to move from one side of the ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulk carrier very quickly.

The 1960 SOLAS Convention sought to control this sort of problem. These regulations required the upper ballast tanks designed in a manner to prevent shifting. They also required cargoes to be leveled, or trimmed, using excavators in the holds. The practice of trimming reduces the amount of the cargo&#x27;s surface area in contact with air which has a useful side-effect: reducing the chances of spontaneous combustion in cargoes such as coal, iron, and metal shavings.

Another sort of risk that can affect dry cargoes is absorption of ambient moisture. When very fine concretes and aggregates mix with water, the mud created at the bottom of the hold shifts easily and can produce a free surface effect. The only way to control these risks is by good ventilation practices and careful monitoring for the presence of water.

The International Maritime Organization sets out international standards and codes for the safe stowage and transportation of bulk carrier cargoes. These include the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes Code, the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Grain in Bulk and the Code of Safe Practice for Ships Carrying Timber Deck Cargoes.

=== Structural problems ===
In 1990 alone, 20 bulk carriers sank, taking with them 94 crewmen. In 1991, 24 bulk carriers sank, killing 154. This level of loss focused attention on the safety aspects of bulk carriers, and a great deal was learned. The American Bureau of Shipping concluded that the losses were &quot;directly traceable to failure of the cargo hold structure&quot; and Lloyd&#x27;s Register of Shipping added that the hull sides could not withstand &quot;the combination of local corrosion, fatigue cracking and operational damage.&quot;

The accident studies showed a clear pattern:
# Sea water enters the forward hatch, due to a large wave, a poor seal, corrosion, etc.
# The extra water weight in hold number one compromises the partition to hold number two,
# Water enters hold number two and alters the trim so much that more water enters the holds
# With two holds rapidly filling with water, the bow submerges, and the ship quickly sinks, leaving little time for the crew to react.

Previous practices had required ships to withstand the flooding of a single forward hold but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds in the middle of the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two.

Other contributing factors were identified:
* Most shipwrecks involved ships over 20 years in age. A glut of ships of this age occurred in the 1980s, caused by an overestimate of the growth of international trade. Rather than replace them prematurely, shipping companies were compelled on cost grounds to keep their aging vessels in service.
* Corrosion, due to a lack of maintenance, affected the seals of the hatch covers and the strength of the bulkheads which separate holds. The corrosion is difficult to detect due to the immense size of the surfaces involved.
* Advanced methods of loading were not foreseen when the ships were designed. While the new processes are more efficient, loading is more difficult to control (it can take over an hour just to halt the operation), occasionally resulting in overloading the ship. These unexpected shocks, over time, can damage the hull&#x27;s structural integrity.
* Recent use of high-tensile steel allows building a structure with less material and weight while retaining similar strength. However, because it is thinner than regular steel, HT steel can corrode more easily, plus it can develop metal fatigue in choppy seas.
* According to Lloyd&#x27;s Register, a principal cause of sinkings was the attitude of ship-owners, who sent ships with known problems to sea.

The new rules adopted in the 1997 annexes to the SOLAS convention focused on problems such as reinforcing bulkheads and the longitudinal frame, more stringent inspections (with a particular focus on corrosion) and routine in-port inspections. The 1997 additions also required bulk carriers with restrictions (for instance, forbidden from carrying certain types of cargoes) to mark their hulls with large, easy-to-see triangles.

=== Crew safety ===

Since December 2004, Panamax and Capesize bulk carriers have been required to carry free-fall lifeboats located on the stern, behind the deckhouse. This arrangement allows the crew to abandon ship quickly in case of a catastrophic emergency. One argument against the use of free-fall lifeboats is that the evacuees require &quot;some degree of physical mobility, even fitness&quot; to enter and launch the boat. Also, injuries have occurred during launches, for example, in the case of incorrectly secured safety belts.

In December 2002, Chapter XII of the SOLAS convention was amended to require the installation of high-level water alarms and monitoring systems on all bulk carriers. This safety measure quickly alerts watch standers on the bridge and in the engine room in case of flooding in the holds. In cases of catastrophic flooding, these detectors could speed the process of abandoning ship.

<text>A residential community is a community, usually a small town or city, that is composed mostly of residents, as opposed to commercial businesses and/or industrial facilities, all three of which are considered to be the three main types of occupants of the typical community.

Residential communities are typically communities that help support more commercial or industrial communities with consumers and workers. That phenomenon is probably because some people prefer not to live in an urban or industrial area, but rather a suburban or rural setting. For that reason, they are also called dormitory towns, bedroom communities, or commuter towns.

An example of residential community would include a small town or city outside a larger city or a large town located near a smaller but more commercially- or industrially-centered town or city, for instance Taitou in Gaocun, Wuqing, and Tianjin, China.

== China ==

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, a community (), also called residential unit or residential quarter () or neighbourhood () or residential community (), is an urban residential area and its residents administrated by a subdistrict (). Communities are generally organized around a territory consisting of 100 to 700 households.

===History===
The reform that created residential communities as local government in their current form was called &quot;shèqū&quot; (社区). Originally, these organizations consisted of participating citizens and chiefs, the latter ones being installed by the central governance. Shequ represented an attempt to restructure the relationship between state and urban community in China.

The social anthropologist Fei Xiaotong is considered the first to have proposed the introduction of the idea of shequ in China. The introduction of shequ started after the collapse of the previously existing social institutions (&quot;danwei&quot;) during the mid-1990s. Shequ were supposed to relieve the state of certain duties and responsibilities by transferring them to citizens participating in the shequ. They take over responsibilities which in democratic states are assumed by organisations of the civil community.

===Local government===
Each community has a community committee, neighborhood committee or residents&#x27; committee (). The creation, adjustment or dissolution of a community committee is decided by the subdistrict government. A community committee is directly elected and consists of 5 to 9 members; it is responsible to the residents assembly, which consists of all residents in the community who are at or above the age of 18.

<text>A food addiction or eating addiction is any behavioral addiction characterized primarily by the compulsive consumption of palatable and hyperpalatable food items. Such foods often have high sugar, fat, and salt contents (HFSS), and markedly activate the reward system in humans and other animals. Those with eating addictions often overconsume such foods despite the adverse consequences (such as excess weight gain, diabetes, and heart disease) associated with their overconsumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;Food/eating addiction review&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological dependence has also been observed, with the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms when substituting foods low in sugar and fat. A person cannot develop a trait that codes for an eating disorder. Professionals address psychological dependence by providing behavior therapy and through administering the YFAS (Yale Food Addiction Scale) questionnaire, a diagnostic criteria of substance dependence.

High-sugar and high-fat foods have been shown to increase the expression of ΔFosB, an addiction biomarker, in the D1-type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens; however, there is very little research on the synaptic plasticity from compulsive food consumption, a phenomenon which is known to be caused by ΔFosB overexpression.

==Description==
&quot;Food addiction&quot; often refers to compulsive overeating; some who suffer from the condition engage in frequent episodes of uncontrollable eating (binge eating). The word was first used in a research-based publication the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol&quot; by American doctor Theron Randolph in 1956. It was continued to use throughout the late 1900s with more cases reported of the condition. In the 21st century, food addiction are often associated with eating disorders. The term &quot;binge eating&quot; is defined as eating an unhealthy amount of food while feeling that one&#x27;s sense of control has been lost. Food addiction initially presents in the form of cravings, which cause a feeling that one cannot cope without the food in question. As the disorder progresses, behavior is modified in order to satisfy the urge for the food. These behavioral changes can result in binge eating disorder, obesity, and bulimia nervosa. A study in Physiology &amp; Behavior by Parylak et al. suggests that animal models given free access to food become more emotionally withdrawn once the food is unavailable due to the anxiogenic stimulus for more food that results. This behavior may suggest that food addiction is not only a problem of self-control, but that it is furthermore the body providing a stimulus so powerful as to numb the individual to the negative consequences of overeating.

People who engage in binge eating may feel frenzied, and consume a large number of calories before stopping. Food binges may be followed by feelings of guilt and depression; for example, one might cancel their plans for the next day because one &quot;feels fat.&quot; Binge eating also has implications on physical health, due to excessive intake of fats and sugars, which can cause numerous health problems.

Unlike individuals with bulimia nervosa, persons with compulsive overeating do not attempt to compensate for their bingeing with purging behaviors, such as fasting, laxative use, or vomiting. When a person suffering from compulsive overeating through binge eating experiences feelings of guilt after their binges, that person can be said to have binge eating disorder (BED).

In addition to binge eating, compulsive overeaters may also engage in &quot;grazing&quot; behavior, during which they continuously eat throughout the day. These actions result in an excessive overall number of calories consumed, even if the quantities eaten at any one time may be small.

During binges, compulsive overeaters may consume between 5,000 and 15,000 food calories daily (far more than is healthy), resulting in a temporary release from psychological stress through an addictive high not unlike that experienced through drug abuse. Compulsive overeaters tend to show brain changes similar to those of drug addicts, a result of excessive consumption of highly processed food (most likely consisting of high amounts of saturated fat, which is more energy-rich). Unlike smoking, drugs, or alcoholism, people with food cravings are not under a type of substance use disorder. Food addiction is more commonly associated with a behavioral addiction to a form of processed food that is not generally healthy.

==Signs and symptoms==
A food addiction features compulsive overeating, such as binge eating behavior, as its core and only defining feature. There are several potential signs that a person may be experiencing compulsive overeating. Common behaviors of compulsive overeaters include eating alone, consuming food quickly, gaining weight rapidly, and eating to the point of stomach discomfort. Other signs include significantly decreased mobility and withdrawal from activities due to weight gain. Emotional indicators can include feelings of guilt, a sense of loss of control, depression and mood swings.

Hiding consumption is an emotional indicator of other symptoms that could be a result of having a food addiction. Hiding consumption of food includes behaviors such as eating in secret, eating late at night, eating in a vehicle, and hiding certain foods until ready to consume in private. Other signs of hiding consumption are avoiding social interactions to eat the specific foods that are craved. Other emotional indicators are inner guilt, which may consist of rationalizing why the food would be beneficial to consume, as well as feeling guilty shortly after consuming the food.

Sense of loss of control may be indicated in many ways, such as expending more effort than usual to obtain specific foods, or spending unnecessary amounts of money on foods to satisfy cravings. This sense of loss of control may impede function during work due to disorganized thoughts, leading to a decrease in efficiency. Another indication is craving food despite being full. One may set rules to try to eat healthy, but find themselves frustrated when they are overruled by their cravings. A large indicator of loss of control due to food addiction is knowing one has a medical problem caused by their behaviors, but not being able to stop consuming the foods, further compromising one&#x27;s health.

Food addiction has some physical signs and symptoms, including decreased energy; decreased ability for activity compared to the past or compared to others; decreased mental efficiency due to the lack of nutritive energy; fatigue; hypersomnia; and insomnia. Other physical signs and symptoms are restlessness, irritability, digestive disorders, and headaches.

In extreme cases food addiction can result in suicidal thoughts.

== Effects ==
Obesity has been attributed to eating behavior or fast food, personality issues, depression, genetics, and also social and environmental conditions such as walkability and access to diverse foods. A lack of access to diverse foods could be caused by food deserts. Other effects of obesity could be an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers. Food addiction might be one supplementary explanation for the epidemic of obesity overall.

==Management==

Compulsive overeating is treatable with nutritional assistance and medication. Psychotherapy may also be required, but recent research has shown this to be useful only as a complementary resource, with short-term effectiveness in moderate to severe cases.

Lisdexamfetamine is an FDA-approved appetite suppressant drug that is indicated (i.e., used clinically) for the treatment of binge eating disorder. The antidepressant fluoxetine is a medication that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of an eating disorder, specifically bulimia nervosa. This medication has been prescribed off-label for the treatment of binge eating disorder. Off-label medications, such as other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have shown some efficacy, as have several atypical antidepressants, such as mianserin, trazodone and bupropion. Anti-obesity medications have also proven very effective. Studies suggest that anti-obesity drugs, or moderate appetite suppressants, may be key to controlling binge eating.

Many eating disorders are thought to be behavioral patterns that stem from emotional struggles; for the individual to develop lasting improvement and a healthy relationship with food, these behavioral obstacles need to be resolved.

Treatment can include talk therapy and medical and nutritional counseling.

The American Dental Association has sanctioned these suggestions, stating: 
Moreover, dental appliances such as conventional jaw wiring and orthodontic wiring have been shown to be efficient methods of weight control in obese patients, with a low incidence of serious complications.

Several twelve-step programs exist to help members recover from compulsive overeating and food addiction, such as Overeaters Anonymous.

The Ontario Health Insurance Plan has announced a new program designed to assist individuals struggling with food addiction.

==Prognosis==
Left untreated, food addiction can lead to chronic conditions and eventually death.

In an individual diagnosed with an eating disorder such as BED, the chances for relapse are high. Those with a food addiction were most likely overweight in childhood, which may lead to treatment resistance depending on the amount of time gone untreated. Due to poor mental health and lack of control and environmental factors, overeaters may relapse into their old habits even after completing various treatments. BED patients often report and acknowledge using substances daily as a coping mechanism.

However, with treatment and follow-ups, there is a 50% chance of recovery. Success in overcoming this disorder rests on following treatment directions and a properly supportive environment in which to recover.

There is a higher chance of successful treatment in teenage populations, in which denial is less ingrained than adults.

==Epidemiology==
A review on behavioral addictions estimated the lifetime prevalence (i.e., the proportion of individuals in the population that developed the disorder during their lifetime) for food addiction in the United States as 2.8%.

As obesity continues to grow into a worldwide problem, solutions such as a sugar tax have been suggested. A sugar tax is set to be introduced in Ireland to minimise the consumption of harmful foods and drinks.

<doc id="1324900" wikidata="Q6407222" url="?curid=1324900" title="Kill the Moonlight">
<text>Kill the Moonlight is the fourth album by American rock band Spoon released on August 20, 2002, through Merge Records. The album features a stripped-down, minimal sound that incorporates various different instruments such as tambourines and pianos along with an idiosyncratic production style. The album has gone on to receive critical acclaim with its lead single &quot;The Way We Get By&quot; being used in various television shows, and is regarded as Spoon&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;.

==Composition==
The album has been noted for its minimal and rhythm-driven sound. Eric Carr of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described it as &quot;an adventure in starkness&quot;, going on to write: &quot;Like some of the best minimalists in music, Spoon use the null and void to create tension which bolsters and sets apart every nuance of the music-- every handclap, every reverberating crash, every beep from the synthesizer.&quot; Heather Phares of &quot;AllMusic&quot; wrote that the group &quot;follow(ed up) such a cathartic album as &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot; with a collection of tougher, leaner, and meaner songs like &quot;All the Pretty Girls Go to the City,&quot; which sounds like the inverse of Girls&#x27; &quot;Everything Hits at Once&quot;&quot;. Daniel Pike of BBC found the album to be &quot;terribly, terribly British&quot; in sound, characterizing it as a &quot;distinctly lo-fi post-punk offering&quot; and noting &quot;an air of tenderness and sincerity about&quot; it. Tom Breihan of &quot;Stereogum&quot; noted elements of &quot;toothy Wire minimalism, mid-period Motown strut, Kinks-y melodic twinkle&quot; in the album&#x27;s sound, even going on to suggest the influence of Timbaland &quot;since (his music) brought the same sense that empty space was a virtue, that a perfectly-placed sound-effect could be the most memorable part of a song&quot;.
The opener &quot;Small Stakes&quot; features &quot;Steve Nieve-style keyboards and (a) shoutout to Har Mar Superstar&quot; with lyrics &quot;alluding to class concerns&quot;. &quot;The Way We Get By&quot;, the lead single from the album, is &quot;built on a rollicking piano line and handclaps&quot; with lyrics that &quot;had its roots in the (Daniel)’s more recent memories of scraping together enough cash to go to shows, alter his mind and find salvation in Iggy Pop&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Daniel revealed that the song initially started out as &quot;off-the-cuff&quot; before turning into &quot;a glorified, fucked-up-relationship song about a scrappy couple getting high in the backseat, making love with the song ‘Some Weird Sin,’ seeking out people that don’t speak very much [...]&quot;. The aforementioned &quot;BBC&quot; article noted &quot;shades of Tim Burgess falsetto on &quot;Something To Look Forward To&quot; and &quot;Stay Don&#x27;t Go&quot;&quot;. The former has been described by the &quot;Stereogum&quot; article as a &quot;nicely knotty, a too-short spurt of sass&quot; whilst the latter track &quot;sports a human beatbox rhythm&quot; or &quot;just a guy breathing funny&quot;, the music on top of it described as being &quot;made up of Depeche Mode type flourishes and Prince meets Bowie vocals&quot; The song &quot;Jonathan Fisk&quot; is based on a bullying middle school classmate of the songwriter Britt Daniel. According to Daniel, &quot;Fisk&quot; is now a fan of the band, and &quot;came to all of [Spoon&#x27;s] shows for about two or three years&quot;. It has been musically described as being &quot;more punk-ish but still relatively spare, even when a saxophone surfaces&quot;. &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; has been singled out by many critics as being the album&#x27;s best track, &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; describing it as &quot;a minimalist ditty [...] With orchestral swells, reversed effects, rim clicks, piano chords, and a haunting vocal melody&quot;. Doug Wallen of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote that the song breathed &quot;sweet new life into classic love-song fodder -- &quot;I&#x27;m not dumb / Just want to hold your hand&quot; and &quot;I will be there with you when you turn out the light&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Someone Something&quot; features a heavy Elvis Costello influence (of whom Daniel is an &quot;ardent admirer&quot;), &quot;Delusions of Adequacy&quot; describing it as &quot; jump(ing) and hop(ping) along [...] a neat piano and nicely placed drum fills&quot;. The following track &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Get You Down&quot; too has piano &quot;but also with newfound bluesy twang&quot;, the intro described as &quot;part Stones and part Elvis Costello&quot;. &quot;All The Pretty Girls Go To The City&quot; has been described as &quot;another fun song highlighted by good piano work that mimics the vocal lines&quot;. The &quot;PopMatters&quot; article writes that the song is &quot;haunted by brooding keys and, finally, lush instrumentation, like a Motown 45 transmitted from the wrong side of the tracks. &quot;You Gotta Feel It&quot; has been described as &quot;eternally bluesy&quot; and features &quot;distant backing vocals and baritone saxes&quot;. &quot;Back To The Life&quot; features a tambourine and handclaps that &quot;come in at the exact right moments&quot;. The song &quot;opens with a demented cackle, then laying on heavy rhythmic sampling and melodic trickery&quot;. The closing track &quot;Vittorio E&quot; has been described as &quot;an undulating, vaguely psychedelic ballad&quot; and an &quot;anti-ballad&quot;, the aforementioned &quot;Pitchfork&quot; article describing it as &quot;a 3-minute synopsis of the album&#x27;s emotional heft&quot;.

==Release==
Released on August 20, 2002 through Merge Records, &quot;Kill the Moonlight&quot; was one of the record label&#x27;s biggest records, behind Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; and Magnetic Fields&#x27; &quot;69 Love Songs&quot;, with 75,000 copies sold by July 2004 and roughly 153,000 by December 2009.

==Reception==
The album received &quot;universal critical acclaim&quot; upon release, with many critics and fans alike later on considering it to be one of Spoon&#x27;s best albums.

==Accolades==
The album received end-of-year accolades from a variety of publications in both the US and the UK, continuing to receive end-of-decade ones as well after it came to an end. The majority of the latter, as shown below, came from US publications.

==Use in other media==
&quot;The Way We Get By&quot; was used on the television shows &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;Shameless&quot; and &quot;Hustle&quot; as well as in the films &quot;Mean Creek&quot;, &quot;The Puffy Chair&quot; and &quot;Stranger Than Fiction.&quot; It is also played in a 2020 YouTube commercial. &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Get You Down&quot; can be heard in the 2005 comedy &quot;Waiting...&quot;.

<text>Porsgrund Porcelain Factory (&quot;Porsgrunds Porselænsfabrik&quot;, abbreviated PP) is a porcelain flatware company located at Porsgrunn in Telemark county, Norway.

==History==
The company&#x27;s production plant is a popular tourist attraction. The company was founded by Johan Jeremiassen in 1885 and has produced designs by Norwegian artists such as Ferdinand Finne, Theodor Kittelsen, Frans Widerberg and Odd Nerdrum.

Since 1996 the factory has been owned by the Atle Brynestad company CG Holding AS. In contrast to its prosperous history, Porsgrund has since experienced a financial decline. After years of uncertain future, adjustments have been made to increase cost efficiency, by considerable restructuring to the production and sales processes. Brynestad has restructured his group several times, and CG Holding has gradually become the privately owned group company 3 Norske, which was founded on 2 July 2007. It also includes the sister companies Hadeland Lys and Tinnstøperi (established in 1991) and the cruise ship company SeaDream Yacht Club (established in 2001).

<text>Alice Mary Strike (31 August 1896 – 22 December 2004) was the last surviving female Canadian military First World War veteran. She was so designated as she lived in Canada after the war, but had actually served in the British armed forces. Canada did not allow females to serve in the military until the Second World War.

Strike was born in Godalming, Surrey, England. In 1914, she enlisted in the RFC as a pay clerk. She married her first husband, a Canadian man named James Stobie Sr., whom she met in Woking, England, during World War I, and later relocated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, where she had four children with him over forty years.

After Stobie retired, they moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and, after her husband had died, she met George Strike on Haida Gwaii in British Columbia. At the age of 90, when she was single again, she moved to Nova Scotia, where her daughter Buzza would care for her. She also had a son, James Stobie Jr., of Victoria, British Columbia, four grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren at the time of her death.

Strike died, aged 108, at Camp Hill Veterans Hospital, Halifax, Nova Scotia.

She was one among 46,000 people to receive the Jubilee medal in February 2003. Queen Elizabeth had also sent congratulations every year since Strike turned 100.

Strike was a member of the Royal Canadian Legion as well.

<doc id="1324906" wikidata="Q546506" url="?curid=1324906" title="Vicki Vale">
<text>Victoria Vale (usually called &quot;Vicki&quot;) is a fictional journalist appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. Her character often serves as a potential love interest, character in peril, and source for information about crimes being committed, often drawing parallels to Lois Lane from the Superman comics.

Vicki Vale has appeared in several DC Comics-related media, such as the films &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; (1949) (portrayed by Jane Adams), &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) (portrayed by Kim Basinger) and &quot;The Batman vs. Dracula&quot; (voiced by Tara Strong) as well as the &quot;&quot; video game franchise (voiced by Grey DeLisle).

==Origins==
While Batman co-creator Bob Kane was at Columbia Pictures for a development meeting concerning the upcoming &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; (1949) serial he by chance met a young starlet in the studio commissary who inspired the Vicki Vale character, a young Marilyn Monroe who was at the studio at that time filming the movie &quot;Ladies of the Chorus&quot; (1948). Vicki Vale, Lois Lane, and Marilyn Monroe each have first and last names beginning with the same letter. The character was then fleshed out and developed for the serial by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. To prepare the public for her serial appearance in advance, the character was first debuted in &quot;Batman&quot; #49 (October 1948). Vicki Vale is a journalist, usually based in Gotham City, who has worked for a number of publications across various iterations of the character and the surrounding DC universe. She is frequently depicted as a romantic interest of Bruce Wayne, the alter-ego of Batman.

==Publication history==
Vicki Vale first appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; #49 (Oct. 1948), written by Bill Finger with art by Bob Kane and Lew Schwartz.

==Fictional character biography==
===1940s–1960s===
Vicki Vale&#x27;s early appearances revolved around her suspicions that Batman and Bruce Wayne were the same person. Batman would usually manage to fool her by the end of each story into concluding that he was not really Bruce Wayne, but her suspicions would re-emerge in a later story.
Vicki Vale remained a prominent character in Batman stories from &quot;Batman&quot; #49, in 1948, until &quot;Detective&quot; #320 in October 1963. In 1964, Julius Schwartz became the editor of the Batman-related comics. Schwartz dropped a number of Batman&#x27;s Silver Age backing characters, including Vicki Vale, Batwoman, Bat-Girl, Bat-Mite, and Ace the Bat-Hound.

===1970s–1980s===
Vicki Vale surfaced 13 years later, in &quot;Batman Family&quot; #11 (June 1977). She was now married and known as Vicki Vale Powers. She was also mentioned in &quot;Batman Family&quot; #16. After that, she vanished for another five years.

She returned in February 1982 in &quot;Batman&quot; #344. The editor and writer were apparently unaware of her 1970s appearances, so there was no mention of her marriage, and it was stated in a footnote that she had not appeared since &quot;Detective&quot; #320. She had supposedly been in Europe for years, but now had returned to Gotham City. She became Bruce Wayne&#x27;s romantic interest again, earning the wrath of Catwoman in &quot;Batman&quot; #355 (January 1983). She also had a rivalry for Bruce&#x27;s affections with Julia Remarque, the daughter of Alfred Pennyworth and Mademoiselle Marie (Julia Remarque was wiped from continuity after &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;).

===1980s–2010===
Vicki disappeared from the comics soon after &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, but in Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, she is a gossip reporter who flirts with the judge during a shoplifting trial. Vicki returned in 1989 and 1990 in the Grant/Breyfogle era to coincide with release of Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot;. She once again began a romantic relationship with Bruce Wayne, but became upset over his frequent absences. At one point, she was partnered with photojournalist Horten Spence to investigate the Fever phenomenon. This led to the two of them having an encounter with the Street Demonz as Horten fought them off. When hospitalized after an attack by the Ventriloquist, Bruce struggles over whether or not to tell her he is Batman, but decides not to, which leads to the end of their relationship. Bruce later regrets this when he descends into a brief depression following his defeat at the hands of Bane.

Vale appeared again in the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; title as one of the hosts of the television program &quot;The Scene&quot; (similar to &quot;The View&quot;). Her co-hosts included Lia Briggs, Tawny Young, and Linda Park. Two episodes are shown in which they interview Wonder Woman on her career. In the &quot;Black Glove&quot; book, she brusquely offers best wishes to Bruce and his new lady Jezebel Jet on the air.

Vicki appears (with blonde hair) in the 2008 two-part story &quot;Two-Face: Year One&quot;. She interviews a corrupt mob lawyer named Weinstein, who is running for Gotham district attorney against Harvey Dent. She is present when Dent, now the disfigured gangster Two-Face, confronts Weinstein and Bruce Wayne at a party in Wayne Manor.

In the 2009 &quot;&quot; storyline, the crossover miniseries &quot;Gotham Gazette&quot; has Vicki claiming to have discovered Batman&#x27;s identity. Vicki has returned to the &quot;Gotham Gazette&quot; after her TV career failed. While the general public is more interested in what happened to Batman, Vale wants to know what happened to Bruce Wayne, who was last &quot;seen&quot; in Vietnam (which was actually Hush masquerading as Wayne). Vicki speaks with Lucius Fox, but still cannot get a proper answer about Bruce&#x27;s whereabouts. Feeling like &quot;a real reporter&quot; again, she is thrilled when she receives an invitation to join Bruce as his date at the Robinson Ball. In &quot;Battle for the Cowl&quot; #3, Vicki reports on the chaos that has been caused by Two-Face in the wake of Batman&#x27;s disappearance.

In the next issue of &quot;Gotham Gazette&quot; titled &quot;Batman Alive&quot;, Vicki sees that Bruce is not present at the gala. While there, she observes the tension between Dick Grayson and Barbara Gordon, as well as the scarring on Tim Drake, allowing her to discover the double lives they and Bruce have been leading. At the end of the story she is seen arranging pictures on her wall, connecting various members of the Batman Family to their secret identities, and declaring that she will prove her suspicions.

Vicki becomes an important supporting player in Issue 6 in the &quot;Red Robin&quot; series. In that issue she begins asking questions and is met by Bruce Wayne (actually Hush/Thomas Elliot in disguise). He agrees to an interview/date with her. This happens in Issue 9 of Red Robin where Wayne/Elliot avoids questions. Vicki finally gets her proof in &quot;Batman&quot; #703.

In &quot;Bruce Wayne: The Road Home&quot;, before she publishes Bruce&#x27;s secret, Vicki wants to know how and why he is Batman. She calls Wayne Manor and threatens to publish the article if Bruce does not meet with her to discuss it. Alfred sends the still-masquerading Thomas Elliot to meet with her. He tells Vicki before kissing her that he is not Batman. When she gets home, she realizes that he was not Bruce Wayne, and knowing that Dick Grayson is now in the role of Batman leads her to ask the question, &quot;Where is Bruce Wayne?&quot; Holding the story until she uncovers the truth behind that, Vicki goes to Wayne Manor and tells Alfred that she knows the truth. Alfred tells her that Bruce, who was feared dead, has returned, but has not told everyone yet. While holding the story, she encounters Barbara Gordon and tells her she knows the truth. She asks her ex-boyfriend, Jack Ryder, if she should publish the article and turn her career around. Vicki sets up a sting with Commissioner Gordon but things do not go as planned, which leads to Catwoman&#x27;s finding out that she knows not just about the Bat-family, but also the Gotham Underground, especially Catwoman. Vicki is eventually hunted by the League of Assassins, after Ra&#x27;s al Ghul realizes that she knew Batman&#x27;s secret. However, Bruce eventually rescues her. She promises him that she will never reveals his secrets. Vicki realizes that Bruce&#x27;s mission is bigger than the truth she&#x27;s seeking, and decides not to expose his secrets, and becomes his ally. During the conflict, Ra&#x27;s realizes that Vicki is a descendant of Marcel &quot;The Hammer&quot; du Valliere, a French soldier and one of the few who challenged Ra&#x27;s and his warriors centuries before Batman. Ra&#x27;s claims that du Valliere stole the woman (who was also Vicki&#x27;s ancestor) he attempted to court. Despite having killed du Valliere after their final battle a long time ago, it is implied that al Ghul&#x27;s business with Vicki is not complete as he vows to track down anything that related to his enemies.

In &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; #18, another ex-Wayne Girl, now a villain called The Absence, comes looking to rip out Vicki&#x27;s eyes. In the following issue, Batman and Robin rush to her apartment only for Absence to reveal that Vicki is bound and gagged inside of a cabinet. Absence then explains that she never intended to kill Vicki, but that she used her as bait to lure Batman into a trap.

===The New 52===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. Vale greets Bruce at a party and introduces him to mayoral candidate Lincoln March. In &quot;Batman&quot; #22, part of the &quot;&quot; storyline, she is present during Wayne Enterprises&#x27; announcement that Bruce Wayne will take part in the family business.

After the Crime Syndicate of America&#x27;s invasion of Earth, she begins investigating organized crime in Gotham. She is rescued by Harper Row when thugs attack her and her assistant in the Gotham Narrows. Harper berates Vicki for not knowing the type of territory she is venturing into. Vicki further investigates the Crime Syndicate&#x27;s connection to police corruption with the assistance of Jason Bard, Harvey Bullock and Maggie Sawyer. Vale later begins dating Bard, until her research reveals that Bard has a vendetta against vigilantes ever since an amateur Batman wannabe in Detroit led to the death of Jodie Hawkins, his partner/lover, this event leaving Bard with a hatred of Jim Gordon as he felt that a decent cop would not need Batman to help his city. When Vicki calls him in disgust at this revelation, Bard attempts to tell her that he has just &#x27;taken down&#x27; Batman (Having hired Lucius Fox after the bankruptcy of Wayne Enterprises to develop a remote-control for the Batmobile that allowed Bard to crash it into a building with Batman inside), but Vicki informs him that he is pathetic, and that she is going to hang up before Batman (who she correctly assumes survived Bard&#x27;s attack) shows up to give him the punch to the face he so richly deserves. Forced to acknowledge how far he has fallen, Bard resigns his police position due to his own connections to organized crime, then voluntarily tells Vicki the details.

<text>Dil Maange More!!! () is a 2004 Indian Hindi-language romantic comedy film directed by Anant Mahadevan and produced by Fourth Wall Productions. It features Shahid Kapoor, Ayesha Takia, Tulip Joshi, Soha Ali Khan (in her film debut), Gulshan Grover, and Zarina Wahab. It was released on 31 December 2004, and it was a box office failure, though it boosted the careers of both Shahid Kapoor and Ayesha Takia.

==Plot==
&quot;Dil Maange More!!!&quot; is the story of Nikhil Mathur&#x27;s quest for true love. His passions are his town, Samarpur, a small hill station in Uttarakhand, and football. He is desperate to fall in love with one woman but ends up with three women in his arms, ready to swear undying love for him.

He is first shown in love with Neha Chopra, his girlfriend of four years. Neha, an ambitious girl, leaves their town to go to Mumbai to become a flight attendant. Nikhil follows her to bring her back. In a railway station in Mumbai, Nikhil bumps into Shagun Shah, a dominant, combative girl. She instantly shows her dislike towards him. Though the two part ways, fate has something else in store for them as he starts living above Shagun&#x27;s house. Shagun always argues with him whenever they meet. On the other hand, he is on good terms with her mother, Kavita. He also gets to know that Shagun&#x27;s father left them when she was 12, because of this she doesn&#x27;t trust anyone and puts on a strong facade, though she is really soft on the inside. Nikhil continuously tries to convince Neha to return; he does not succeed. He lands a job in a music store, which is run by A.R. Rahman (a parody of A.R. Rahman), exactly opposite the institute where Neha is training. There, he meets coworker Sarah. Nikhil keeps trying to convince Neha but only gets rejection. In the end, on her first flight day, she breaks up with him. Dejected, he decides to return to Samarpur. Sarah, having heard about Samarpur from Nikhil, requests to accompany him. He agrees.

At Samarpur, Nikhil finds Sarah to be totally opposite of Neha. His mother likes her too, and he is relieved to know that Sarah is in love with Samarpur and won&#x27;t have any problem settling there. Convinced that she also has some feelings for him, he decides to talk to Sarah about it. But suddenly, Sarah demands to leave Samarpur for some reason and promises to call him once she reaches Mumbai. But Nikhil never receives the call.

He comes back to Mumbai to find Sarah. However, he gets to know that Sarah already has a boyfriend, and she did everything to make him jealous, thinking that he is cheating on her, which disheartens Nikhil. He decides to finally leave Mumbai for good this time. He goes to say goodbye to Shagun&#x27;s mother. There, he reads Shagun&#x27;s computer diary and learns that she is actually in love with him. He couldn&#x27;t take another heartache and decided to leave. Learning that Nikhil is leaving for ever, Shagun runs to the railway station and finds Nikhil sitting on a bench. Fate seems to be playing again; Nikhil&#x27;s train didn&#x27;t arrive that day. He decides to take one more chance and proposes to Shagun, which she accepts, but things turn as Neha returns, wanting him back. When Shagun sees Neha hugging Nikhil, she leaves fuming in anger, believing him to be a cheater just like her father. Nikhil tells Neha to leave him alone as he is in love with Shagun. Kavita (Shagun&#x27;s mother) requests Shagun to talk to Nikhil for one last time and listen to his side of the story as well. A.R. Rahman, believing Sarah to be the reason for Nikhil&#x27;s agony, tries to fix him up with Sarah, who has apparently returned after realizing that her boyfriend was a fraud. She hugs him, and again, Shagun, who has come to talk to Nikhil, sees them and goes berserk.

After hearing the whole story from Nikhil, A.R. Rahman arranges a party at a yacht; all the girls attend. They argue, and all three fall in the water. Nikhil quickly goes to help but only saves Shagun, who doesn&#x27;t know how to swim. Meanwhile, Nikhil, thinking that he has lost Shagun forever, returns to Samarpur. Shagun finally realizes that Nikhil really loves her and follows him to Samarpur, where the two decide to live there happily ever after. As Shagun is confessing her love, we see Neha, Sarah, and A.R. Rahman saying that their plan was successful, implying that everything was just an act to get Nikhil and Shagun together.

== Critical reception ==
Ron Ahluwalia of PlanetBollywood.com gave the film 6/10, writing ″This movie is time pass material and ends 2004 the same way it started: pathetically. Watch it for Shahid and Ayesha ONLY, but there&#x27;s a lot more to be looking forward to in 2005.″ Anupama Chopra of India Today wrote ″The tragedy is that the film&#x27;s love lite formula works convincingly till the interval. Kapur has the charisma to carry the film; the girls range from above average to bad.″ Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM gave the film 2 out of 5, writing ″On the whole, DIL MAANGE MORE is an ordinary product that has its share of limitations.″ Manish Gajjar of BBC.com wrote ″One last word about the film - Dil Maange More is your average flick which you have all seen before. minor faults will not help the film in the long run as word of mouth goes around.″

<text>PGA Tour Canada, commonly referred to as the Canadian Tour, was a men&#x27;s professional golf tour headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. The United States–based PGA Tour took over operation of the tour on November 1, 2012, at which time it was renamed PGA Tour Canada. In 2015, Mackenzie Investments became the umbrella sponsor of the tour, branding it as the Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada.

PGA Tour Canada used to be one of three international PGA Tour-sanctioned tours, along with PGA Tour Latinoamérica and PGA Tour China (all now defunct). These tours provided access to the Korn Ferry Tour and are part of the path to the PGA Tour.

In April 2023, the PGA Tour announced that the 2023 PGA Tour Canada season would be the last, as from 2024 the tour would merge with PGA Tour Latinoamérica, creating PGA Tour Americas.

==History==
The origins of the Canadian Tour can be traced back to the Carling of Canada Golf Tour, which ran for four years from 1966 to 1969. In 1970 Carling Brewery reduced their sponsorship commitments to just a handful of the main tournaments and the tour became less coordinated. Later in the year Imperial Tobacco Canada, under the Peter Jackson brand, signed on as title sponsor and brought scattered Canadian professional events back under one umbrella. The Peter Jackson Tour started in 1971 bringing together seven provincial opens, with each purse reaching C$15–20,000 by 1977. The Tour developed predominantly Canadian touring pros but also welcomed players from around the world. Canadian Golf Hall of Fame members Dave Barr and Dan Halldorson – both two-time PGA Tour winners – competed on the circuit in the 1970s and made several appearances once they were established on the big tour. Fellow Canadians and PGA Tour winners Al Balding and George Knudson also returned home several times in their career to play the circuit.

As the 1970s continued, government legislation began restricting the amount of advertising and sponsorship that tobacco companies were allowed to participate in. In 1978, anticipating future legislation that would ban tobacco advertising and sponsorship in Canada, Imperial Tobacco withdrew its title sponsorship of the circuit. Several tournaments disappeared and although a few carried on, there was no longer any cohesion to the circuit. In 1982, Canadian touring professionals formed the Tournament Players Division (TPD) within the Canadian Professional Golfers Association (CPGA) and proposed a reorganized circuit under the guidance of Ken Tarling.

In 1985, TPD members selected Bob Beauchemin as president with the mandate to &quot;build, promote and conduct tournaments of the Canadian Tour to develop Canadian professional golfers to a world-class level.&quot; The reborn Canadian Professional Golf Tour began play in 1985 and had six events. Nevertheless, the Tour was still linked with the CPGA (PGA of Canada). In January 1986, Beauchemin convinced the CPGA&#x27;s Board of Directors to grant the TPD autonomous status within the CPGA and to be responsible for its own funding.

The next step involved organizing tournaments in such a way as to maximize the benefit for the players. At the time, most tournaments were 36- or 54-hole events and several were pro-am formats. To prepare players for the PGA Tour, they set a goal for all tournaments to be 72 holes with no pro-ams during the actual competition. Prize money, exemptions and draws would need to mimic the format used on the PGA Tour and European Tour. Although it took until 1989 for all tournaments to play 72 holes, the Canadian Tour began attracting players from not only the United States, but from around the world in the mid-1980s.

The Canadian Tour has sent many players on to PGA Tour success. Canadian Mike Weir, the winner of eight PGA Tour titles – including the 2003 Masters - earned Rookie of the Year honours on the Canadian Tour in 1993. In 1997, Weir captured the 1997 Canadian Masters and BC Tel Pacific Open as well as the Order of Merit. He first qualified for the PGA Tour in 1998. Other PGA Tour winners who played the Canadian Tour include 2005 U.S. Open winner Michael Campbell, 2004 Open Championship winner Todd Hamilton, Steve Stricker, Stuart Appleby, Peter Lonard, Scott McCarron, Tim Herron, Chris DiMarco, Nick Watney, Stephen Ames, Paul Casey, Arron Oberholser, D. A. Points, Ken Duke, Mackenzie Hughes, and 2008 RBC Canadian Open winner Chez Reavie.

The former Canadian Tour became an associate member of what was at the time the trade body of the world&#x27;s main men&#x27;s tours, the International Federation of PGA Tours, in 2000. In 2009, it became a full member when the Federation expanded to include all of the main women&#x27;s tours. It is one of a number of lower-level tours at which Official World Golf Ranking points are available, with a minimum of six given to the winner and points to the top six plus ties.

The Canadian Open, which is the richest golf event in Canada, is a PGA Tour event. The top three from the PGA Tour Canada Order of Merit the week before the Canadian Open are given entry. The prize money does not count toward Order of Merit earnings.

PGA Tour Canada offices are at Golf House in Oakville, Ontario, on the grounds of the Glen Abbey Golf Course. The Jack Nicklaus-designed course has hosted more than 20 Canadian Opens since 1977.

In 2011, the Canadian Tour made history when Isabelle Beisiegel became the first woman to earn a Tour card on a men&#x27;s professional golf tour.

In October 2012, the PGA Tour acquired the Canadian Tour, renaming it PGA Tour Canada effective November 1, 2012, for first use in the 2013 season. Under the new system, the top five players on the PGA Tour Canada Order of Merit earn Web.com Tour cards, with the money leader fully exempt and those 2nd-5th conditionally exempt. Players ranked 2nd through 10th are exempt through to the finals of qualifying school and those who finish 11th–20th are admitted to the second stage. The re-tooled tour offered at least eight tournaments per season, with total purses of about $150,000 apiece. For 2015, the purses were increased to $175,000 for the first eleven events. Those who finish in the Top 60 earn entry into season-ending Freedom 55 Financial Championship, with a $200,000 purse and are guaranteed at minimum full PGA Tour Canada status for the next season. In 2018, the purses were increased to $200,000 and $225,000 respectively.

Like many smaller tours, PGA Tour Canada has its own series of qualifying schools at various sites. The medalist at each of the six sites is fully exempt for the season. Those in the top 14 (not including ties) are exempt through the first six events, when a reshuffle occurs. In the event of a tie, a playoff determines the final exempt position. Those in the top 40 including ties are conditionally exempt.

In 2015, Mackenzie Investments became the tour&#x27;s umbrella sponsor. For the next six years, the tour was named Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada. Through various PGA Tour Canada&#x27;s initiatives, over $4.1 million has been raised for charities throughout Canada since 2013. 

In 2020, PGA Tour Canada originally planned an expansion into border states with the United States. On January 16, 2020, officials announced a six-year deal with the Cragun&#x27;s Golf Resort in Brainerd, Minnesota for the Cuyuna Regional Medical Center Championship. In March, the tour was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and replaced by two series – the LocaliQ Series in the United States, an eight-tournament series from August to November, and the Canada Life Series for Canadian-based players, a four-tournament series from August and September to provide Canadian-based players some playing opportunities. In response to travel restrictions, the LocaliQ Series became the Forme Tour in 2021 to allow non-Canadian members to earn Korn Ferry Tour privileges.

In 2022, PGA Tour Canada rebranded the Order of Merit as the Fortinet Cup, which was modelled after the FedEx Cup points system used by the main PGA Tour, and was sponsored by network security company Fortinet.

<doc id="1324915" wikidata="Q891991" url="?curid=1324915" title="Venera 14">
<text>Venera 14 (called Venus 14 in English) was a probe in the Soviet Venera program for the exploration of Venus.

Venera 14 was identical to the Venera 13 spacecraft, built to take advantage of the 1981 Venus launch opportunity. Venera 14 was launched on 4 November 1981 at 05:31:00 UTC, five days after Venera 13 launched on 30 October 1981 at 06:04:00 UTC. Both had an on-orbit dry mass of .

==Design==
Each mission consisted of a cruise stage and an attached descent craft.

===Cruise stage===
As the cruise stage flew by Venus, the bus acted as a data relay for the lander before continuing on to a heliocentric orbit. Venera 14 was equipped with a gamma-ray spectrometer, UV grating monochromator, electron and proton spectrometers, gamma-ray burst detectors, solar wind plasma detectors, and two-frequency transmitters which made measurements before, during, and after the Venus flyby.

===Descent lander===
The descent lander was a hermetically sealed pressure vessel that contained most of the instrumentation and electronics. The lander was mounted on a ring-shaped landing platform and topped by an antenna. Designed similar to the earlier Venera 9–12 landers, the Venera 14 lander carried instruments to take chemical and isotopic measurements, monitor the spectrum of scattered sunlight, and record electric discharges during its descent phase through the Venusian atmosphere. The spacecraft used a camera system, an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, a screw drill and surface sampler, a dynamic penetrometer, and a seismometer to conduct investigations on the surface.

The list of lander experiments and instruments include: 
* Accelerometer, Impact analysis – Bison-M
* Thermometers, Barometers – ITD
* Spectrometer / Directional Photometer – IOAV-2
* Ultraviolet Photometer 
* Mass spectrometer – MKh-6411
* Penetrometer / Soil ohmmeter – PrOP-V
* Chemical Redox indicator – Kontrast
* 2 color telephotometer cameras – TFZL-077
* Gas chromatograph – Sigma-2
* Radio / Microphone / Seismometer – Groza-2
* Nephelometer – MNV-78-2
* Hydrometer – VM-3R
* X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (Aerosol) – BDRA-1V
* X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (Soil) – Arakhis-2
* Soil Drilling Apparatus – GZU VB-02
* Stabilized Oscillator / Doppler Radio
* Small solar batteries – MSB

==Landing==

Venera 14 landed at , about southwest of Venera 13, near the eastern flank of Phoebe Regio on a basaltic plain.

After launch and following a four-month cruise to Venus, the descent vehicle separated from the bus and plunged into the Venusian atmosphere on 5 March 1982. A parachute deployed after the lander entered the atmosphere. The parachute released once the lander reached an altitude of about ; simple air braking was used in the final descent.

Like its predecessors, Venera 14 was equipped with several systems with which to observe and analyse the Venusian surface and atmosphere.

The quartz camera windows were protected by lens covers that popped off after descent, allowing Venera 14 to capture images of the surface.

The Venera 14 lander was also equipped with a surface soil probe designed to measure the compressibility of the Venusian soil. By unfortunate chance, the lens caps came to rest at the exact point the probe was due to enter and analyse the soil. Thus, instead of the soil, the probe measured the compressibility of the Venera 14 lens cap.

The surface soil composition samples were determined by the X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, and were shown to be similar to oceanic tholeiitic basalts.

Additionally, Venera 14 was equipped with acoustic microphones designed to record atmospheric noise. The recordings were later used to calculate the average wind speed on the Venusian surface. Subsequent analysis determined the average surface wind speed to be between .

The Venera 14 lander functioned for at least 57 minutes (the lander&#x27;s planned lifespan was 32 minutes) in an environment with a temperature of 465 °C (869 °F) and a pressure of 94 Earth atmospheres (9.5 MPa). Telemetry was maintained by means of the Venera 14 bus in orbit, which carried signals from the lander&#x27;s uplink antenna and then on to Earth.

==Post encounter==

The spacecraft bus ended up in a heliocentric orbit where it continued to make observations in the X-ray and gamma ray spectrum. The bus activated its engine on the 14th November 1982 to provide data for later Vega program missions. The last published data for the probe is dated 16 March 1983.

<text>Sid Torin (born Sidney Tarnopol; December 14, 1909 – September 14, 1984), known professionally as &quot;Symphony Sid&quot;, was a long-time jazz disc jockey in the United States. Many critics have credited him with introducing bebop to a mass audience.

==Early life==
Sidney Tarnopol was born in New York City into a Jewish family. According to the 1920 U.S. Census, his parents were Isidore (a printer) and Caroline, both Yiddish-speaking immigrants; his father was from Russia and his mother from Romania. Sidney was the oldest of three siblings — he had a brother Martin and a sister Mildred. Born on New York&#x27;s Lower East Side, Sid grew up in Brooklyn, in a poor neighborhood. Not much is known about his youth, although he seems to have become a jazz fan as a teenager, and at one point tried to become a trumpet player. One source says he started college and then dropped out as a result of the Great Depression. By 1930, the census showed him working at a record store. He first got into radio in 1937, at a radio station in the Bronx at WBNX, where he began as an afternoon disc jockey, doing a show called the &quot;Afternoon Swing Session&quot;. His show featured the biggest hits by black performers such as Count Basie, Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald. He became extremely popular with young people, many of whom would come to the station hoping to meet him or make a request. In an era when black music was still not frequently heard on the air, Symphony Sid was among the few white announcers who played what was then called &quot;race&quot; or &quot;sepia&quot; recordings on a regular basis. In addition to being an announcer — in 1937, the word &quot;disc jockey&quot; was not yet in common use — Sid sold airtime for his own program and produced the commercials for his sponsors.

==Early radio career==

The story of how he gained the nickname &quot;Symphony&quot; Sid has been told in multiple contradictory accounts. According to one source, it came from working at the Symphony record store where he introduced R&amp;B records. The predominantly black customers told their friends that they bought the records from Symphony Sid. But another source says it came from a sponsor—a men&#x27;s clothing store, and when announcer Walter Tolmes opened Sid&#x27;s show, he rhymed &quot;Here comes the kid with the fancy pants and the fancy lid... Symphony Sid.&quot; And yet another source says he got the name from playing &quot;good music&quot; (classical recordings) at his first radio job, before he became known for jazz. This source says the name came from his playing symphonic music every day.

By 1941, Symphony Sid had left WBNX and was working at WHOM in Jersey City, New Jersey, where he became identified with doing the late night shift. His show was called the &quot;After-Hours Swing Session&quot;. At WHOM, he began to give emerging black performers exposure. He also began to co-produce and promote jazz concerts, in association with Monte Kay. One of their first collaborations was in 1945 (some sources say 1942) at New York&#x27;s Town Hall; it featured Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. After WHOM, his career took him briefly to WWRL in New York and then to WMCA. By 1947, he was one of the best known jazz disc jockeys, and airplay on his show could give a major boost to any musician. Some grateful performers even wrote songs that they dedicated to him: for example, in 1947, Arnett Cobb recorded &quot;Walkin&#x27; With Sid&quot; for the Apollo label. And also in 1947, Sid began to use a song by Erskine Hawkins, &quot;After Hours&quot;, as the theme of his nightly program.

Sid left WMCA in early June 1949, but he didn&#x27;t have to wait long for his next job. On 20 June 1949, he received his biggest opportunity: a network program on what was then called WJZ—later known as WABC. Thanks to his work on the fledgling ABC Radio Network, he could now be heard in more than 30 states. And as a result of his network show, jazz, especially the music of artists like Miles Davis and Charlie Parker, gained wider exposure with a national audience. Later, critics would refer to him as &quot;the dean of jazz radio&quot;.

In his 1957 novel &quot;On the Road&quot;, based on his travels across the United States in the late 1940&#x27;s, Jack Kerouac wrote that as he approached New York City in his car he listened to the Symphony Sid show on the radio with the latest jazz.

==Controversy and change==

Although Sid was white, he was known for his hipster lingo, his love of bebop, and his knowledge of the black music scene. While modern critics later accused white jazz disc jockeys like Symphony Sid and Alan Freed of profiting from black radio and taking jobs away from black announcers (see Sinclair, 1989 for example), this did not seem to be a concern during the years when Sid broadcast. He won several awards from black organizations, including an award for Disc Jockey of the Year presented to him in 1949 by the Global News Syndicate, for his &quot;continuous promotion of negro artists&quot;. Among the entertainers he had helped were such jazz performers as Nat King Cole, Sarah Vaughan, Charlie Parker, and Billy Eckstine. As his popularity grew, songs were written about him. For example, there was a reference to &quot;the dial is all set right close to twelve eighty&quot; in the song &quot;Jumpin&#x27; With Symphony Sid&quot;, which was written by Lester Young with lyrics by King Pleasure; the song mentioned the location on the radio dial where Symphony Sid&#x27;s Friday night show could be found. &quot;Jumpin&#x27; With Symphony Sid&quot; was a hit for the George Shearing Quintet in 1950. Louis Jordan&#x27;s &quot;After School Swing Session (Swinging With Symphony Sid)&quot; suggests his show&#x27;s widespread popularity among young listeners (&quot;Everyday we meet on just any old street, listening to Symphony Sid&quot;). In addition, another song, &quot;Symphony in Sid&quot; by Illinois Jacquet was written in tribute to him. However, jazz trumpeter Miles Davis, in &quot;&quot;, made numerous complaints about Torin, accusing him of self-aggrandizement and trying to short-change musicians (e.g. J. J. Johnson) who performed in bands and performance dates managed by Torin.

For a while during the mid to late 1940s, Sid broadcast live from the Royal Roost night club in New York. In 1950, he moved the show to Birdland. Sid also did some shows from other New York clubs such as the Three Deuces and Bop City. He also continued to work with concert promoters, serving as MC for jazz concerts at venues like Carnegie Hall.

It seems to have been an open secret that Sid was a regular user of marijuana. While the slang expression was &quot;reefer&quot;, a home where marijuana was used and sold was known as &quot;tea pad&quot;, and the police raided Sid&#x27;s apartment in the summer of 1948, and arrested him. He remained on the air while the case was pending, and it finally came to trial in late January 1949. The case was declared a mistrial, but there was some residual damage to Sid&#x27;s reputation. Some sources say he was fired from WJZ, while others indicate he continued to work as an MC in the clubs. But he evidently decided it was time for a change of scenery, and went with his friend Norman Furman to Boston about 1952. Furman had become general manager of WBMS, which had been doing classical music (the call letters reportedly stood for &quot;World&#x27;s Best Music Station&quot;). He changed the format and hired Sid, who did a gospel show and a jazz show. But Sid had a unique arrangement with Furman—he worked at WBMS in the daytime, and at night, he worked for WCOP, where he did live jazz shows, just as he had done in New York. During the mid-1950s, Sid could be heard live from the Hi-Hat, a night club owned by Julian Rhodes, in a part of Boston known for live jazz—the area near the intersection of Massachusetts and Columbus Avenues. In the mid-fifties, Sid was instrumental in the growth of the Rhythm &amp; Blues radio in Boston, giving out plastic key chain fobs that said &quot;I Dig You the Most&quot;, but he never really embraced the music, and tried to interest his audience in Jazz.

==Back to New York==

By 1957, Sid had left Boston and returned to New York, this time working on WEVD AM &amp; FM. The station in the 1920s and &#x27;30s had been known for ethnic music (Yiddish, Italian, etc.) as well as for a very liberal and pro-labor stance on politics (WEVD had been named for socialist Eugene V. Debs). Sid&#x27;s show featured Latin music, Afro-Cuban jazz featuring artist such as Mongo Santamaría, Mario Bauzá and Machito for which, as Donald Fagen recalled in a letter to Countermoon Zine, his choice of music proved controversial, and he was dubbed by some the &quot;Jazz Traitor&quot;. On the other hand, some critics found his Latin music show both interesting and important, and praised the concept as &quot;an extraordinary meeting of cultures&quot;. Then in the late 1970s, encouraged by his engineer, Marty Wilson, Sid again started to play jazz in the last hour of his show. When he retired, he gave Wilson his record collection and the jazz show continued on the weekends. Throughout his time in New York, Sid also continued to be involved with promoting and serving as MC at jazz concerts.

==Final years==

Sid Torin married three times, all ending in divorce (two of his wives were Eva Peña and Betty Ansley). He had two sons, one born in 1948 and the other in 1951.
He retired to Islamorada in Florida in 1973, where he enjoyed fishing and had his own boat. He also did a full-time airshift on a Miami Beach jazz radio station, WBUS. By all accounts, he was a heavy smoker, and he died of emphysema and heart disease in mid-September 1984. While modern media critics acknowledge his importance and praise him for introducing certain jazz artists to a national audience, surviving recordings where he was the announcer do not fare so well. Many modern critics have referred negatively to his on-air work. For example, his announcing at a 1945 Charlie Parker concert is called &quot;annoying&quot;; another critic who reviewed that same release calls Symphony Sid &quot;odious&quot; and says he &quot;gives a painful imitation of a hipster&quot;. However, a few critics place Symphony Sid&#x27;s style in the context of its time and understand that in his day, his style of announcing was appreciated.

Because of his importance in that pre-rock music era, the staff of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland has included him in a display about the most influential disc jockeys in history.

<doc id="1324920" wikidata="Q1767521" url="?curid=1324920" title="Lewis B. Schwellenbach">
<text>Lewis Baxter Schwellenbach (September 20, 1894 – June 10, 1948) was a United States senator from Washington, a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington and the 5th United States Secretary of Labor.

==Background==

Born on September 20, 1894, in Superior, Douglas County, Wisconsin, Schwellenbach moved to Spokane, Washington with his parents in 1902, attending the Spokane elementary and high schools. He received a Bachelor of Laws in 1917 from the University of Washington School of Law. He was an assistant instructor at the University of Washington from 1916 to 1917.

==Career==

Schwellenbach entered service during World War I as a Private in the 12th Infantry Regiment of the United States Army in 1918 until his discharge as a corporal in 1919. He was admitted to the bar and practiced in Seattle, Washington from 1919 to 1935. Schwellenbach served as state commander of the American Legion and president of the University of Washington&#x27;s alumni association, and was a delegate to numerous county and state conventions. His prominence as a result of these leadership roles caused the Democratic Party to consider him for state offices including attorney general and governor. He was an unsuccessful candidate for nomination for Governor of Washington in 1932.

===Congressional service===

Schwellenbach was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate and served from January 3, 1935, to December 16, 1940, when he resigned. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1940, having been appointed to the federal bench. He was a delegate to the Inter-Parliamentary Union at The Hague, Netherlands in 1938.

===Federal judicial service===

Schwellenbach was nominated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on May 6, 1940, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington vacated by Judge J. Stanley Webster. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 6, 1940, and received his commission on November 20, 1940. His service terminated on June 30, 1945, due to his resignation to become Secretary of Labor.

===Secretary of Labor===
Schwellenbach was appointed United States Secretary of Labor by President Harry S. Truman and served from July 1, 1945, until his death in Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., on June 10, 1948. He was interred in Washelli Cemetery in Seattle.

During Schwellenbach&#x27;s tenure as Secretary, fear of post-war unemployment brought the United States Congress to pass the Employment Act of 1946, which made promotion of maximum employment the Nation&#x27;s top priority. Schwellenbach promoted abolition of wartime wage and price controls. He had to deal with a post-war wave of strikes. The Republican 80th United States Congress passed the Taft–Hartley Act. Staff cuts were made at the United States Department of Labor. The U.S. Conciliation Service was removed from the Department of Labor and established as the independent Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). During his term, the Department&#x27;s international work was institutionalized; the Office of International Labor Affairs (now the Bureau of International Labor Affairs) was established as a unit in the Office of the Secretary.

==Personal life and death==
Schwellenbach&#x27;s brother, Edgar W. Schwellenbach, served as a Justice of the Washington Supreme Court.

He married Anne Duffy in 1935 and they remained together until his death in 1948.

Schwellenbach died on June 10, 1948. He was buried at Washelli Cemetery in Seattle.

<doc id="1324925" wikidata="Q3249789" url="?curid=1324925" title="List of Amtrak stations">
<text>This is a list of train stations and Amtrak Thruway stops used by Amtrak (the National Railroad Passenger Corporation in the United States). This list is in alphabetical order by station or stop name, which mostly corresponds to the city in which it is located. If an English Wikipedia page exists for the actual station or stop, a link is included. Some Thruway Motorcoach stops include train stations that are not served by Amtrak trains (and occasionally any trains at all).

All current (and most former) Amtrak train stops (stations) and Thruway Motorcoach stops have a three-letter station code (sometimes also referred to as a city code). These codes do not necessarily correspond with the list of IATA-indexed train stations or the three-character IATA airport codes, although many are the same. Amtrak began using station codes in 1992. If a station code was used by more than one train station, each station is listed. However, if a station code was used for a Thruway Motorcoach stop that has changed locations, only information for the current location (or most recent location, if the stop is no longer in service) is included in the notes, unless one of the locations was an actual train station.

Ridership data and station ownership is from Amtrak&#x27;s Great American Stations website. The ownership of many stations is shared, with one entity owning one or more of the following: the facility itself, the parking lot, the passenger platform, and the train tracks. In some instances, the owner of the bus station used for a Thruway Motorcoach stop is not the same as the connection service provider.

Many stations do not offer full services (ticketing, baggage, etc.). Some stations and Thruway Motorcoach stops are conditional or flag stops, with trains only stopping at the station if reservations for a pickup or drop off are made in advance. Some stations are seasonal with trains or buses stopping only during certain times of the year.

Although Amtrak primarily serves the United States, three routes also serve Canada. The &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; is jointly operated with Via Rail Canada, while the &quot;Adirondack&quot; and &quot;Cascades&quot; are exclusively operated by Amtrak. There are also eight Thruway Motorcoach stops in British Columbia.

Among the Amtrak stations are several &quot;tour only&quot; stations which require special reservations with Amtrak for a group (usually twenty or more persons) for the train to stop at that station (such stations include and Marceline stations). There are also several &quot;stations&quot; (many of which are not actually train stations at all) which only operate in conjunction with regular special events (such &quot;stations&quot;/events include the Lexington Barbecue Festival, the New York State Fair, and the North Carolina State Fair).

<doc id="1324926" wikidata="Q5532000" url="?curid=1324926" title="General Laws of Massachusetts">
<text>The Massachusetts General Laws is a codification of many of the statutes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Commonwealth&#x27;s laws are promulgated by an elected bicameral (&quot;two-chamber&quot;) legislative body, the Massachusetts General Court. The resulting laws—both Session Laws and General Laws—together make up the statutory law of the Commonwealth.

Each bill that becomes law is given a chapter number, assigned sequentially in the chronological order of its adoption – these are the &quot;Session Laws&quot;. The official publication of Session Laws for any given year is called the &quot;Acts and Resolves of Massachusetts&quot;, and is compiled and published annually by the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The vast majority of Session Laws are &quot;Acts&quot;. A &quot;Resolve&quot; is most typically used to establish a special commission to investigate a certain issue.

&quot;General Laws&quot; are Session Laws (or sections of Session Laws) that are permanent in nature and of general application. They are codified according to subject matter into a multi-volume publication entitled the General Laws of Massachusetts. The General Court amends the General Laws by enacting Session Laws which may effect modifications and additions to the General Laws.

Not all Session Laws, which apply equally to codified law, are entered into the General Laws. Session Laws that are not codified into the General Laws are called &quot;Special Acts&quot;, and might include matters affecting an individual or a particular city or town.

In legal citations, Massachusetts General Laws are abbreviated as M.G.L. or G.L. Provisions in the General Laws are identified by chapter and section, e.g., . Chapters are grouped topically by &quot;part&quot; and &quot;title&quot;.

The &quot;parts&quot; of the General Laws are as follows:

The unannotated official version of the &quot;General Laws&quot; is published every two years. Two widely used annotated collections are &quot;Massachusetts General Laws Annotated&quot; (M.G.L.A.) from West Publishing, and &quot;Annotated Laws of Massachusetts&quot; (A.L.M.) published by LexisNexis. Both are available as bound collections and by subscription online.

The General Laws replaced the General Statutes, which are abbreviated as G.S. when cited in lists of local-option statutes accepted by cities and towns.

The Massachusetts Constitution expressly grants to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court the power to review and interpret these laws.

<doc id="1324937" wikidata="Q6705754" url="?curid=1324937" title="Lutheran World Relief">
<text>Lutheran World Relief (LWR) is an international non-governmental organization that focuses on sustainable development projects and disaster relief and recovery. The organization was founded in 1945 to collect and send aid to people living in post-World War II Europe. Today, LWR helps communities living in extreme poverty adapt to the challenges that threaten their livelihoods and well-being, and responds to emergencies with a long-term view. It is a member of the Corus International family of faith-based international development organizations, which include IMA World Health, CGA Technologies, Ground Up Investing, and LWR Farmers Market Coffee.

One of LWR&#x27;s flagship programs – started in 1945 and continuing today – is its Quilt and Kit Ministry. Each year Lutherans across the United States assemble and donate LWR Mission Quilts, as well as several kinds of care kits to assist people living in poverty in times of emergency or great need.

, LWR did not meet the standards set by the Better Business Bureau&#x27;s BBB Wise Giving Alliance. In 2023, CharityWatch provided a combined score for Lutheran World Relief &amp; IMA World Health, giving them an A, signifying top-rated. , LWR held a 4-star rating with Charity Navigator, having rebounded from a 3-star rating on that organisation&#x27;s previous two reports. , the crowd-sourced charity reviewer GreatNonprofits shows that LWR last received its 5-star top rating in 2016.

LWR is a member of the ACT Alliance, a global alliance of churches and related agencies working on development that are committed to working together.

== History ==
Lutheran World Relief was officially founded in 1945, as Lutherans in the United States began responding to the refugee crisis in post-World War II Europe by sending food, clothing and quilts. By the end of the decade, LWR was also sending relief aid to those affected by conflicts in Palestine, Hong Kong, Korea, and Bangladesh. In the 1960s and 1970s, LWR began forming methodologies of working in agriculture and with farming cooperatives to increase rural incomes and food security in the developing world, eventually changing its articles of incorporation to reflect its work in international development. In 1979, LWR opened it first regional office in Peru.

In the 1980s, famine in Africa made international headlines, especially the plight of people in Ethiopia. In response, LWR shipped 5,000 tons of wheat to northern Ethiopia and also opened a regional office in West Africa. For its work in responding to the Ethiopian Civil War and famine, LWR became the first faith-based development agency to receive the Presidential End Hunger award. In 1999, LWR moved its headquarters from New York City to the newly built Lutheran Center in Baltimore, Maryland.

Since 2000, LWR has increased its emphasis on sustainable agriculture and climate adaptation while continuing to respond to major natural disasters and humanitarian crises around the world. , in addition to responding to emerging crises as needed, LWR maintains ongoing operations in 29 countries in Central and South America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Oceania.

== Organizational structure ==
In its founding structure, Lutheran World Relief was originally led by a secretary. In 1953, the organization changed its top leadership position to an executive director. In 1996, LWR transitioned to being led by a President and CEO, the structure that remains in place today. LWR&#x27;s President and CEO reports to a 15-member board of directors, including representatives from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS), the two largest Lutheran church bodies in the United States.

LWR is divided into four departments:
* The President&#x27;s Office, which oversees strategic leadership of the organization, manages relationships with church bodies and other major stakeholders and acts as a liaison between the organization and its board of directors
* International Programs Department, which designs and implements international development programs, conducts project monitoring and evaluation and coordinates emergency responses
* External Relations &amp; Strategic Partnerships, responsible for LWR&#x27;s marketing and communications, as well as building and maintaining relationships with individual, congregational and institutional donors and funders
* Finance &amp; Administration, which manages the finances for LWR&#x27;s domestic operations and international projects

== Core program areas ==
LWR&#x27;s projects are structured to address three core program areas:

=== Agriculture ===
LWR&#x27;s programs in agriculture focus on improving the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers and their families by through sustainable agricultural practices that build food security and increase rural incomes. Some approaches LWR uses to carry out this work are:
*Through agricultural value chains: This refers to all the steps involved in producing an agricultural product, from planting to the final product. Farmers involved in many steps of the agriculture value chain have the ability to earn more income from their crops. LWR projects help farmers learn how to take part in various roles in the agriculture value chain.
*Strengthening farmers&#x27; organizations: LWR works with farmer and producer organizations to increase their capacity to deliver services to their farmer-members, such as training, the communal use of equipment, and relationships with credit institutions to help farmers secure seeds, fertilizer, and other tools necessary to plant crops. LWR projects help farmers&#x27; and producers&#x27; organizations improve their governance, build relationships with credit institutions, and implement support for their farmer-members.
*Climate-Smart Agriculture: LWR works with farmers to cope with and overcome the effects of changing climate conditions through conservation agriculture, sustainable land management and the improvement of water access, management, and protection.

=== Climate ===
LWR&#x27;s programs in climate change focus on helping rural communities adapt to changing climates by:
*promoting Climate-Smart Agriculture practices 
*working with communities to develop disaster preparedness and disaster risk management plans
*promoting sustainable and renewable energy sources in rural communities; and 
*protecting communities&#x27; natural assets – such as water and soil – from degradation through reforestation.

=== Emergency operations ===
LWR&#x27;s emergency operations focus on helping rural communities prepare for disasters before they happen and cope with and recover from emergencies in ways that promote lasting improvements in living conditions by: 
*expediting aid on the ground through the use of cash transfer programs 
*meeting short-term material needs with non-food items, such as blankets and cooking utensils 
*supporting local partners to conduct programs that meet international quality and accountability standards; 
*transitioning work to support early recovery and helping communities recover their livelihoods in ways intended to better prepare them to cope with future disasters; and 
*working with communities to become better prepared and equipped to withstand and recover from emergencies.
LWR has implemented significant response programs to natural disasters, including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Super-Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, and the 2015 Nepal earthquakes, as well as crises caused by conflict in South Sudan, Iraq, and Syria.

==Quilts and kits==
Every year Lutherans across the U.S. sew quilts and assemble kits of supplies that LWR sends to partners around the world that request them to meet the needs of people affected by poverty and disaster.

Mission Quilts were one of the earliest forms of aid that Lutherans sent through LWR to reach out to people in other parts of the world. In 2016, LWR sent $14 million worth of quilts and kits to more than 576,000 people in 21 different countries.

There are four kinds of LWR Kits. LWR Personal Care Kits contain items like toothbrushes, wash cloths, and soap, intended to help a person or family maintain hygiene practices. LWR School Kits contain notebooks, pencils, erasers, a backpack, and other items to use for students to attend school. LWR Baby Care Kits contain T-shirts, cloth diapers, and other items to care for a baby. LWR Fabric Kits contain fabric, thread, and needles so that people can learn to sew, potentially to earn an income.

In 2013, LWR joined the United Nations Humanitarian Resource Depot, which allowed it to pre-position quilts and kits in depots across the world for rapid deployment after an emergency.

== LWR Farmers Market Coffee ==
The LWR Farmers Market Coffee program began in 2017 in partnership with THRIVE Farmers. Using a direct trade model, coffee is sourced from farmers participating in LWR projects; the farmers receive an initial, up-front price for their coffee beans as well as a portion of the sales profit. THRIVE Farmers also directs 80 cents per pound of coffee sold back to LWR&#x27;s international programs. LWR Farmers Market Coffee currently offers medium, dark and decaf roasts.

LWR has also partnered with Fair trade organizations Equal Exchange (1998–2016), Divine Chocolate (2007–2014), and SERRV (1999–2014).

==Eco-Palms==
In 2005, LWR began to partner with the University of Minnesota Center for Integrated Natural Resources and Agricultural Management to offer Eco-Palms to congregations throughout the United States. Eco-Palms is a program that engages palm harvesters in Mexico and Guatemala and provides training on sustainable palm harvesting and trains members of harvesting communities to sort and package palms in order to retain more of the income from the palm industry. Through Eco-Palms, congregations order palms through Lutheran World Relief for their Palm Sunday celebrations.

<text>Lake Attitash is a lake located on the border of Merrimac, Massachusetts and Amesbury, Massachusetts, and constitutes at least a portion of Amesbury&#x27;s water supply.

There are beaches on both the Amesbury and Merrimac shores. Merrimac&#x27;s beach is known as Indian Head Park. The lake was formerly known as &quot;Kimball&#x27;s Pond.&quot; Its name was changed to reflect its reputed indigenous name of Attitash, meaning huckleberry.

The lake is popular with seasonal tourists, as well as residents. It is normally safe for swimming. Boats are allowed on the lake.

This shallow, enlarged natural great pond has a maximum depth of and an average depth of . The shoreline is extensively developed; roads and cottages, two or three rows deep in places, virtually ring the entire lake, as well as a summer boys&#x27; camp, and at least two boat docks. There are literally hundreds of boats of all types and sizes. The only significant weed beds are located in the inlet and outlet coves.

Public access for boating has been created by the Massachusetts Office of Fishing and Boating Access (formerly known as the Public Access Board) by constructing a parking lot and launching ramp. The parking lot can accommodate nearly two dozen vehicles.

The last fisheries survey – conducted in 1978 – located nine of the 11 species known to be present in this water. Largemouth bass and chain pickerel are common and appear at least moderately fished. Pumpkinseeds dominate the fishery, although white perch and brown bullhead are very common.

Northern pike were stocked here in 1979, 1985, 1986 and 1988, and will continue to be stocked in the future.

Although Attitash is a good largemouth bass and chain pickerel water, it is primarily known as one of the best northern pike waters in the Northeast District. Pike in excess of 20 pounds have been reported here.

The heavy recreational use this lake supports during the summer months largely precludes fishing. Bass and panfish anglers enjoy good action during the spring and fall months, and ice fishermen avidly pursue the pike resource in winter. Fishing pressure is particularly high during the winter. Various local tournaments often bring out crowds of ice fishermen on weekends.

<text>Raphael J. Sonenshein (born November 10, 1949, in Nutley, New Jersey) is Executive Director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles and was previously a professor of political science at California State University, Fullerton, where he also served as chairman of the department. An instructor at California State University, Fullerton from 1982 to 2012, Sonenshein holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in public policy from Princeton University and a doctorate in political science from Yale University. His books, &quot;Politics in Black and White: Race and Power in Los Angeles&quot; and &quot;The City at Stake: Secession, Reform, and the Battle for Los Angeles&quot; detail the political history of Los Angeles in the last fifty years. He is currently working on a third book. Sonenshein recently returned to the United States after completing a semester teaching in Paris on a Fulbright Scholarship. Sonenshein recently transferred to California State University, Los Angeles, where he was appointed Executive Director of the Edmund G. &quot;Pat&quot; Brown Institute of Public Affairs.

He was executive director of the Los Angeles Appointed Charter Reform Commission, which, along with the Los Angeles Elected Charter Reform Commission that operated simultaneously and with the same mandate, created a &quot;unified charter&quot; proposal for the ballot that provided the first successful and comprehensive update to the city&#x27;s 1925 charter. The charter measure achieved a 60 percent approval at the polls in June 1999. It boosted the mayor&#x27;s power and led to the creation of neighborhood councils and area planning commissions.

He is a nephew of retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Nathan Sonenshein. He currently resides in Santa Monica. Sonenshein is also a frequent editor and writer for the Jewish Journal.

<text>A training field is a type of outdoor training facility typically used by a military, paramilitary, or militia to train or organize soldiers and recruits. Training fields were common until after World War II, when the need for mass training of troops was reduced, and military training and organization moved to dedicated, permanent training facilities.

The term &quot;training field&quot; may also refer to outdoor training facilities used for sports that are often played in fields, such as track and field and association football, though these are more specifically called training camps and training grounds.

== Historical value ==
In the American region of New England, many towns and cities have kept and maintained the training fields that served as the training grounds for soldiers, militia, and townspeople during former wars, including the American War of Independence, the War of 1812, and the American Civil War.

Today, these areas are normally designated as, or part of, historical sites. They may include war memorials dedicated to veterans or statues of important figures in past wars, such as George Washington or the Marquis de Lafayette. They may also include preexisting or rebuilt structures, or restored weaponry on static display, such as centuries-old cannons or outdated armored fighting vehicles.

Oftentimes, training fields are still used for public gatherings or as parks. Other times, they may still be part of existing military installations.</text><links>

<doc id="1324953" wikidata="Q300155" url="?curid=1324953" title="Atomic vapor laser isotope separation">
<text>Atomic vapor laser isotope separation, or AVLIS, is a method by which specially tuned lasers are used to separate isotopes of uranium using selective ionization of hyperfine transitions. A similar technology, using molecules instead of atoms, is molecular laser isotope separation (MLIS).

Natural uranium consists of a large mass of 238U and a much smaller mass of fissile 235U. Traditionally, the 235U is separated from the mass by dissolving it in acid to produce uranium hexafluoride and then using gas centrifuges to separate the isotopes. Each trip through the centrifuge &quot;enriches&quot; the amount of 235U and leaves behind depleted uranium. In contrast, AVLIS produces much higher enrichment in a single step without the need to mix it with acid. The technology could, in principle, also be used for isotope separation of other elements, which is uneconomic outside specialist applications with current non-laser-based technologies for most elements.

As the process does not require the feedstock to be chemically processed before enrichment, it is also suitable for use with used nuclear fuel from light water reactors and other nuclear waste. At present, extracting from those sources is only economical up to a degree, leaving tons of still contained in waste products. AVLIS may offer an economic way to reprocess even the fuel that has undergone one cycle of reprocessing using existing methods.

Due to the possibility of achieving much higher enrichment with much lower energy needs than conventional centrifuge based methods of uranium enrichment, AVLIS is a concern for nuclear proliferation. To date, no commercial-scale AVLIS production line is known to be in use.

==Principle==
The basic concept behind the AVLIS system is to selectively ionize the desired atoms in a vaporized source material. As the energy levels of the electrons are affected by the nuclear structure, causing the hyperfine structure, different isotopes have different energy levels. The designers pick a particular electron energy where the difference between isotopes is maximized and the energy level can be practically produced with a laser. The laser light causes the chosen electron to be photoexcited and thus ionize the atom, leaving it electrically charged. The ion can then be manipulated with electrostatic or magnetic fields. Other isotopes, which subtly different energy levels, will not be ionized and remain in the original mix.

The choice of target electron has changed during the development of AVLIS as newer laser technologies have been developed. Early work generally focused on electrons in the 16 micron band, which could be efficiently produced using CO2 lasers which were emerging in the late 1960s. However, the transitions in this area were closely spaced which made it difficult to select due to Doppler broadening, requiring the vapor to be cooled with a complex expansion system. The introduction of lasers working at tunable frequencies, typically dye lasers, allowed the selection of more convenient excitations. Modern systems typically use the 238U absorption peak of 502.74 nanometers which shifts to 502.73 nm in 235U.

The AVLIS system consists of a vaporizer and a collector, forming the separation system, and the laser system. The vaporizer produces a stream of pure gaseous uranium.

==Laser excitation==

The laser commonly used is a two-stage tunable pulsed dye laser usually pumped by a copper vapor laser; the master oscillator is tunable, narrow-linewidth, low noise, and highly precise. Its power is significantly increased by a dye laser amplifier acting as optical amplifier. Three frequencies (&quot;colors&quot;) of lasers are used for full ionization of uranium-235.

For AVLIS in other elements, such as lithium, tunable narrow-linewidth diode lasers are used.

==Commercialization and international significance==

In the largest technology transfer in U.S. government history, in 1994 the AVLIS process was transferred to the United States Enrichment Corporation for commercialization. However, on 9 June 1999 after a $100 million investment, USEC cancelled its AVLIS program.

AVLIS continues to be developed by some countries and it presents some specific challenges to international monitoring. Iran is now known to have had a secret AVLIS program. However, since it was uncovered in 2003, Iran has claimed to have dismantled it.

==Brief history==

The history of AVLIS, as recorded in the open refereed literature, began in the early-mid 1970s in the former Soviet Union and the United States. In the US, AVLIS research was mainly carried out at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory although some industrial laboratories were early players. Tunable laser development for AVLIS, applicable to uranium, has also been reported from several countries including Pakistan (1974), Australia (1982-1984), France (1984), India (1994), and Japan (1996).

<text>&quot;Hyperfine&quot; is a song by Australian indie pop singer G Flip. It was released on 8 May 2020.

The song was voted number 7 in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2020 and peaked at number 88 on the ARIA charts in February 2021. It was certified platinum in February 2024. 

G Flip said &quot;I wrote this song after having silly little bickering fights with my partner. In relationships it&#x27;s so common to say &#x27;it&#x27;s fine&#x27; when it’s really not fine. If you care about someone, talk to them. In the context of what&#x27;s going on, I thought it would be a good chance to drop a bit of a bop to sing along to and feel alive again in this time.&quot;

<text>Zhou Guangzhao (; May 15, 1929 – August 17, 2024) was a Chinese theoretical physicist who served as President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences from 1987 to 1997.

==Early life and education==
Zhou Guangzhao was born on May 15, 1929, in Changsha, the capital of Hunan province. He was the 5th child of the civil engineer Zhou Fengjiu, and the younger brother of biochemist/geneticist Zhou Guangyu. He graduated from Tsinghua University in 1951, and then did graduate work in theoretical physics for three years at Beijing University. He stayed at Beijing Univ. on the faculty after completing his PhD. In 1957 he was sent to the USSR by the Chinese Atomic Energy Research Institute to work at the Dubna Joint Institute for Nuclear Research.

==Professional career==
Zhou returned to China in 1960, where he worked on the Chinese nuclear weapons program, ultimately becoming director of the Chinese Nuclear Weapons Research Institute, now the China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP). He was elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and later became the Vice President (1984–1987) and President (1987–1997) of the CAS.

Zhou&#x27;s theoretical work focuses on particle physics.

He first visited the US in 1979. In the 1980s he spent time as a visiting researcher at the University of California and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and at the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland.

==Death==
Zhou died on August 17, 2024, at the age of 95.

==Honors==
The asteroid 3462 Zhouguangzhao is named after him.

Zhou was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences in 1987.

<text>John McComb Jr. (1763–1853) was an American architect who designed many landmarks in the 18th and 19th centuries. Between 1790 and 1825, McComb was New York city&#x27;s leading architect.

== Early life and education ==
McComb Jr. was born on October 17, 1763, in New York City and was of Scottish ancestry. In 1783, McComb began working with his father, John McComb Sr., a well known architect and surveyor. In 1790, he began working independently and John Jay spoke highly of his work to Alexander Hamilton. McComb would later design Hamilton&#x27;s home, The Grange. In general, McComb worked in the Federal style.

McComb died in 1853, and is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

<doc id="1324992" wikidata="Q35388" url="?curid=1324992" title="Halkomelem">
<text>Halkomelem (; in the Upriver dialect, in the Island dialect, and in the Downriver dialect) is a language of various First Nations peoples of the British Columbia Coast. It is spoken in what is now British Columbia, ranging from southeastern Vancouver Island from the west shore of Saanich Inlet northward beyond Gabriola Island and Nanaimo to Nanoose Bay and including the Lower Mainland from the Fraser River Delta upriver to Harrison Lake and the lower boundary of the Fraser Canyon.

In the classification of Salishan languages, Halkomelem is a member of the Central Salish branch. There are four other branches of the family: Tsamosan, Interior Salish, Bella Coola, and Tillamook. Speakers of the Central and Tsamosan languages are often identified in ethnographic literature as &quot;Coast Salish&quot;.

The word &quot;Halkomelem&quot; is an anglicization of the name &quot;Halq̓eméylem&quot;. The language has three distinct dialect groups:

# Hulquminum / Hulʻqʻumiʻnumʻ (Island dialect) or &quot;Cowichan&quot; (spoken by separate but closely related First Nations on Vancouver Island and adjoining islands on the west side of the Strait of Georgia: the Snuneymuxw (Nanaimo), Snaw-naw-as (Nanoose) – the former &quot;Saalequun tribe&quot; is part of both First Nations, Stzꞌuminus (Chemainus), Cowichan Tribes, Lake Cowichan (Tsꞌuubaa-asatx), an originally Southern Wakashan-speaking people), Halalt, Lyackson, Penelakut, and Lamalchi.
# Hunquminum (hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓) (Downriver dialect) or &quot;Musqueam&quot; (spoken by seven First Nations in the Lower Mainland in and around Vancouver, as well as in the Fraser River Delta and the lower reaches of the Fraser River; which consider themselves linguistically and culturally related ethnicities – but do &quot;not&quot; identify as Stó꞉lō (although in the literature mostly attributed to these), but today often refer to themselves as &quot;Musqueam&quot;, the Musqueam, Tsawwassen, Kwantlen, Tsleil-Waututh, New Westminster Indian Band, Kwikwetlem (Coquitlam), Katzie, and the now extinct Snokomish (Derby people).)
# Halqemeylem / Halqʼeméylem (Upriver dialect) or &quot;Stó꞉lō&quot; (spoken by today 24 Sto꞉lo First Nations upstream along the Fraser River from Matsqui on to Yale; the historic &quot;Tsꞌelxwéyeqw (Chilliwack)&quot; (today&#x27;s First Nations Aitchelitz, Shxwhá꞉y Village, Skowkale, Soowahlie, Squiala, Tzeachten, and Yakweakwioose), &quot;Pelóxwlh Mestiyexw (Pilalt/Pilʼalt)&quot; (today&#x27;s First Nations Cheam, Kwaw-kwaw-Apil, and Skwah), &quot;Tiyt (Tait)&quot; or &quot;Upper Stó꞉lō&quot; (today&#x27;s First Nations Popkum, Skawahlook, Chawathil, Seabird Island, Shxwꞌowꞌhamel, Union Bar, Peters, and Yale), &quot;Pepa꞉thxetel&quot; or &quot;Semà꞉th (Sumas)&quot;, and the &quot;Sqʼéwlets/Sqwōwich (Scowlitz)&quot; (Sqꞌewlets First Nation) tribes.

The language differences (namely, in phonology and lexicon) are greatest between the Island and Upriver dialects, with the Downriver dialect (especially the Tsawwassen First Nation) providing a central link between the other two. The diversity of the Halkomelem dialects is noted to be the result of complex social and economic forces and linguistic change, as many Island people crossed the Georgia Strait to camp along the Fraser River (in both the Downriver and Upriver areas) for the summer runs of salmon. Arranged marriages between children in different language areas was also common, helping to establish a regional social network in the Strait of Georgia–Puget Sound Basin.

==Use and revitalization efforts==
The Halkomelem language is near extinction. In 2000, it was estimated that the number of fluent Halkomelem speakers was fewer than twenty-five. Most are middle-aged or older, and few are monolingual, as there was a flood of English-speaking settlers in the region in the mid-19th century. Among these, towards the end of the century, the distinguished scientist Maud Menten, spent part of her childhood in Harrison Mills. She learned Halkomelem from a schoolfriend, and was possibly the only biochemist in history to speak it. Language programs at the Stó꞉lō Nation, Seabird Island First Nation, and Cowichan First Nation have been developed to save the language. A program aimed at adults at Musqueam is a collaboration between the band and the University of British Columbia First Nations and endangered languages program.

In September 2009, the University of California Press published American linguist Brent Galloway&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Upriver Halkomelem&quot;.

A Halkomelem iPhone app was released in 2011. This was followed by an Android version was released in 2016. The app was developed by the FirstVoices website. There are 1754 words archived and 690 phrases archived on the FirstVoices website.

As of 2014, 263 fluent speakers had been reported. In 2014, the number of Head Start Programs was 21, and this included a language-nest immersion preschool.

==Phonology==
Note: All examples are drawn from the Downriver dialect of Halkomelem spoken by the Musqueam band. Relevant differences in the phonology of the Island and Upriver dialects are noted at the foot of the phoneme charts.

===Vowels===
Halkomelem has five vowel phonemes. Long and short vowels (but not schwa) contrast. Vowel length is written in the native orthography as .

: Upriver Halkomelem dialects also have a mid back vowel .

All five vowel phonemes vary considerably phonetically. The phoneme /i/ has three distinct allophones. It is realized as following unrounded uvulars. It is realized as with a central off-glide preceding both unrounded and rounded uvulars. Elsewhere, it is realized as low or high . The /e/ is realized as a low to mid-front vowel, usually between or high . The /a/ is low and central to back, often close to . The /u/ is high, back, and rounded, realized somewhere between low or high .

When stressed, the schwa /ə/ appears in most environments as a mid-central, but it is fronted and raised before /x/, approaching ; before /j/ it is also fronted, approaching ; before /w/ it is lower and back, approaching ; and before rounded velars it is mid-back, close to . Unstressed /ə/ can be as high as before /x/ and /j/, and before labialized velars it is realized as or . This phoneme can also be assimilated to a stressed /e/ or a stressed /a/ in an adjacent syllable, by vowel harmony.

===Consonants===
: The stops and affricates are grouped together for simplification purposes.
: Of recent and/or peripheral phonemic status.
: /b d d͡ʒ f ʀ/ occur only in a few borrowed and imitative words.
: The five glottalized resonants pose a problem in phonemic analysis, but occur frequently.
: Occurs in the Upriver dialect.

The plain plosives are less aspirate before vowels than in English, but they are more aspirate finally. Although the glottalized plosives are ejectives, they are not usually strongly released.

Suttles (2004) makes several interesting notes on the Musqueam obstruents. The labiodental fricative /f/ occurs in recent loans from English and their derivatives such as in &quot;káfi&quot; &quot;coffee&quot; and in &quot;číf&quot; &quot;chief.&quot; The stops /t/ and /tʼ/ are articulated at a point slightly forward of that of the usual English /t d/, while the affricates &quot;c&quot; /ts/ and &quot;cʼ&quot; /tsʼ/ are somewhat more retracted than these same English /t d/. The affricate has only been recorded in &quot;English people&quot; and &quot;English (language).&quot; The glottalized lateral affricate /ƛʼ/ is produced when the apex of the tongue at the onset is in the position for the lateral release rather than for a /t/, and there is less friction produced than with other affricates. The phonemes /k/ and /kʼ/ occur in &quot;baby talk&quot; as substitutes for /q/ and /qʼ/. The uvular fricative &quot;x̌&quot; is produced with a great deal of friction and/or uvular vibration, and it contrasts strongly with the velar fricative /x/.

There is variation in the extent to which Musqueam speakers glottalize resonants. Phonetically, there are glottalized resonants (e.g. ) and resonants preceded or followed by glottal stops (e.g. ), however, Suttles (2004) finds no instances of contrastive distribution among any of the three. He puts forth two explanations for these facts: that there are two sequences of phonemes, /Rʔ/ and /ʔR/, with overlapping allophones, or that there is a single phoneme that is realized in three distinct ways. In preferring the latter explanation, Suttles holds that there may be five glottalized resonant phonemes in the dialect, although Downriver speakers glottalize resonants very lightly, making them difficult to detect.

In most Upriver dialects, glottalized resonants do not exist, while in Island dialects, they are more sharply articulated (tenseness is a key feature of Island speech). As is the case with many other phonological features, Downriver Halkomelem stands as a link between the other dialect areas, and it is possible that its speakers vary depending on Island or Upriver influence. Other differences between dialects include: Island and Downriver have both /n/ and /l/, while Upriver has merged these as /l/. Upriver Halkomelem lacks the post-vocalic glottal stops of the other two dialects, and shows compensatory lengthening in that environment. Additionally, Upriver dialects have greater pitch differences, and some words are differentiated by pitch alone.

===Stress and pitch===
Based on Suttles&#x27; (2004) recordings of several speakers of the Downriver (Musqueam) dialect, stress in Halkomelem consists of an increase in intensity and an accompanying rise in pitch. The three levels of stress are primary (marked /׳/), secondary (marked /`/), and weak (unmarked). There is one vowel with primary stress in every full word, however, its occurrence is not completely predictable.

In uninflected words with more than one vowel, the primary stress usually falls on the first vowel (e.g. as in &#x27; &quot;hand&quot; and &#x27; &quot;house&quot;). There are exceptions to this general pattern (e.g. as in &#x27; &quot;enemy&quot;). As shown by the preceding example, if the word contains both a full vowel and one or more schwas, the stress is placed on the full vowel. Again, there are exceptions to this pattern, such as in words with a final glottal stop that cannot be preceded by schwa (e.g. as in &#x27; &quot;one&quot;).

Although minimal pairs contrasting stress are rare, they do exist in the language. The primary stress of a verb root consisting of a resonant, a schwa, and an obstruent followed by the suffix /-t/ &quot;transitive&quot; can fall on either the root or the suffix, allowing for minimal pairs such as &#x27; &quot;salvage it&quot; and &#x27; &quot;finish it all.&quot;

The secondary stress appears most often in words that are composed of a root that has retained its stress and a stressed suffix (e.g. as in &#x27; &quot;help me&quot;). It may be the case, however, that the secondary stress recorded by Suttles (2004) in words like &#x27; is actually a falling pitch; this seems to be characteristic of the last stressed syllable of a phrase in the language. Additional analyses of the sentential intonation patterns are needed.

===Phonotactics===
All obstruents (except the glottals) typically follow one another in sequences of up to four, although a sequence of five is also possible (e.g. as in &quot;&quot; &quot;just standing in shock&quot;). There are no specific restrictions on the types of obstruent sequences that can occur. Plosives appearing in sequences are rearticulated, and sequences of /ss/ are common in the language.

Resonants only appear adjacent to vowels. When these sounds occur in the middle of words, they are found in sequences of resonant-obstruent, resonant-resonant, and obstruent-resonant. An initial resonant is always followed by a vowel, and a final resonant must be preceded by one.

The laryngeals are more restricted than members of the other natural classes in Halkomelem. The glottal stop occurs only adjacent to a vowel, and, within words, it does not follow any obstruent except (the prefix) /s/. It can never occur in final position following a schwa. /h/ occurs only before vowels, following a resonant or one of the fricatives at morpheme boundaries, but never following other obstruents. It can appear between an unstressed and a stressed vowel, but it cannot occur between a stressed and an unstressed vowel.

===Morphophonemics===
Certain processes affect the realization of underlying sounds in Halkomelem. Alternations that occur fairly commonly are discussed in this section, rather than in the following section on morphology.
*In rapid speech, there is optional loss of some instances of schwa, glottal stop, glottalization of resonants, and /h/.
**An unstressed schwa following an initial nasal stop may be lost, if there is a vowel preceding; the nasal is sometimes heard as part of that syllable (e.g. as in &#x27; ~ &#x27; &quot;my father&quot;).
**/nə/ with no preceding vowel sometimes appears as syllabic (e.g. as in &#x27; ~ &#x27; &quot;one kind&quot;).
**A glottal stop after an unstressed final vowel may be lost, in which case the vowel will be reduced to a schwa (e.g. as in &quot;méqeʔ&quot; ~ &quot;méqə&quot;).
**The glottalization of resonants following unstressed vowels is often inaudible (e.g. as in &quot;smənʼéꞏm&quot; ~ &quot;smənéꞏm&quot; &quot;descendants&quot;).
**/h/ before a stressed vowel may be lost when preceded by a spirant (e.g. as in &quot;sháꞏyʼ&quot; ~ &quot;sáꞏyʼ&quot; &quot;finished&quot;).
*An unstressed schwa may take on the quality of an adjacent full vowel, or one that is separated from it by a glottal stop (e.g. as in &quot;spéʔəθ&quot; ~ &quot;spéʔeθ&quot; &quot;black bear&quot;).
*When a root with the shape of /CARˀ/ (C is any consonant, A is a full vowel, Rˀ is a glottalized resonant), takes the suffix /-ət/ &quot;transitive,&quot; the resulting form is /CAʔəRt/. It appears that the resonant and schwa have switched positions (a form of metathesis), but the glottal stop protects the schwa from assimilating to the full vowel (e.g. as in &quot;wílʼ&quot; &quot;appear&quot; and &quot;wíʔəlt&quot; &quot;make it appear&quot;).
*Several roots appear alone, without having undergone affixation (e.g. as in &quot;ʔí&quot; &quot;big&quot; and &quot;pá&quot; &quot;get blown on&quot;). When this type of root is followed by a suffix that begins with a stressed vowel, (e.g. as in /-ínəs/ &quot;chest&quot;), an /h/ appears (e.g. as in &quot;θəhínəs&quot; &quot;barrel-chested&quot;). A final /h/ is never realized after a stressed vowel.
*A number of suffixes beginning with /n/ have forms with initial /l/ when they are added to a root or stem ending in /l/ (i.e. there is alternation of /n/ and /l/ in certain morphological cases in this language) (e.g. as in /-nəxʷ/ ~ /-ləxʷ/ &quot;limited control&quot; in &quot;ɬə́qʼəlləxʷ&quot; &quot;know it&quot; and &quot;cə́llexʷ&quot; &quot;catch up with him&quot;).
*In the progressive and resultative forms of few verbs with initial /c/ or /x/ followed by /a/, the /c/ is reduplicated as /kʷ/ and the /x/ as /xʷ/ (e.g. as in &quot;cám&quot; &quot;go/come inland&quot; and its progressive &quot;cákʷəm&quot; &quot;be going/coming inland&quot;).
*Vowel gradation often occurs between a full vowel, schwa, and zero, depending on the type of root or stem, type of suffix, and placement of stress.
*When some suffixes are joined with stems, a change in the quality of the stressed vowel, from one full vowel to another, in the stem, or (rarely) in the suffix results. The vowel mutations are the product of the assimilation of one vowel to that of an adjacent syllable at an earlier stage in the language&#x27;s history. Three kinds of these mutations exist (although only the first example is common). In the first two examples, the vowel mutation is similar to the umlauting effect of a suffix on stems in Germanic languages.
**Stem /e/ changes to /a/ (e.g. as in &quot;xʷƛʼáqtəs&quot; &quot;long-faced&quot; [&quot;ƛʼéqt&quot; &quot;long&quot;]).
**Stem /a/ to /e/ (e.g. as in &quot;péꞏltʼθeʔ&quot; &quot;buzzard (turkey vulture),&quot; which is composed of &quot;spáꞏl&quot; &quot;raven&quot; and the suffix /-itθeʔ/ &quot;clothing, blanket&quot; [with metathesis]).
**Suffix /e/ to /a/ (e.g. as in &quot;sqʼəqʼəxán&quot; &quot;partner,&quot; which is composed of &quot;sqʼəqʼáʔ&quot; &quot;accompanying&quot; and the suffix /-xən/ ~ /-xén/ &quot;foot&quot;).

==Writing system==
In 1997, the Musqueam First Nation officially adopted the Americanist phonetic alphabet. This alphabet does not use upper-case letters.

The Stó꞉lō use a cased Latin alphabet with modifier apostrophes, letter colon for both vowel length and geminate consonants, and the special letters &quot;Ō&quot; and &quot;X̱&quot;. The vowel letters are &quot;a&quot; for , &quot;e&quot; for , &quot;o&quot; for , and &quot;ō&quot; for . &quot;Sh&quot; is before &quot;xw&quot;, and is found in a few English and French loans.

Using the letter &quot;a&quot; as a carrier, &quot;á&quot; marks high tone, &quot;à&quot; mid tone, and &quot;a&quot; low tone. 

The Cowichan use a cased Latin alphabet with modifier apostrophes and doubled letters for vowel length. &quot;Ou&quot; is used for the long [u] sound in French loanwords, and &quot;u&quot; is used for schwa. The alphabet includes the tetragraph &quot;tthʼ&quot;.

=== Typography ===
The Musqueam Band language department collaborated with the University of British Columbia to create a typeface called Whitney Salishan that displays all the characters correctly.

=== Comparison ===
==Morphology==
Like the majority of Salishan languages, Halkomelem is polysynthetic. A word in Halkomelem may consist of a root standing alone and unaltered, or of a root altered by one or more processes of internal modification and/or accompanied by one or more affixes. Since all words (with the exception of a few adverbs) can function as predicate heads, there is no basis for distinguishing verbs, nouns, and adjectives. There are other bases, however, for distinguishing these classes. Verbs have progressive forms and do not take possessive affixes, while nouns do not have progressive forms and do take possessive affixes. Adjectives have neither progressive forms, nor do they take possessive affixes. Compounding is non-existent in the language, although some scholars believe to have found a few possible examples.

The majority of verb roots have the shapes CAC, CəC, CəCC, while noun roots typically have the shape CVCVC (V is any vowel). The most common shapes of adjective roots are CəC and CAC. There is a prefix that nominalizes verbs and adjectives, and there are several prefixes that make verbs out of nouns. Additionally, there are several ways to make adjective-like words from nouns. Processes of internal modification of the root include reduplication (of initial CV and CVC), shift in stress and vowel grade, and glottalization of resonants (which also affects suffixes). Roots of different shapes often undergo different processes to produce forms that are grammatically identical.

===Verbs===
Verbs roots are identified as perfective, as opposed to progressive, aspect.
* Perfective &quot;split, tear&quot;
* Progressive &quot;be splitting, be tearing&quot;
Several verbs also have a durative aspect, which can occur in both forms.
* Perfective &quot;bite it&quot;
* Progressive &quot;be biting it&quot;
A number also have an iterative-dispositional aspect. For a few of these verb roots, this aspect can appear in both a progressive and in a perfective form.
* &quot;easy to split&quot;
The majority of verbs have a resultative form which is adjective-like and does not carry a progressive-perfective distinction.
* &quot;split, torn&quot;
* &quot;spilled, capsized&quot;
The plural can be optionally marked in all of these forms. The diminutive is also marked, optionally, in only the progressive and resultative aspects.

===Nouns===
It is possible to internally modify noun roots in Halkomelem for the plural, the diminutive, and the diminutive plural. Compare:
* &quot;hand&quot;
* &quot;hands&quot;
* &quot;little hand&quot;
* &quot;little hands&quot;
A few nouns may have resultative forms. They do not have progressive forms, but they may be made into a verb with a verbalizing affix and then express this form.

===Adjectives===
Similar to noun roots, adjective roots can be internally modified for plural, diminutive, and diminutive plural. They can only have progressive forms if made into verbs by means of a verbalizing affix.
* &quot;white&quot;
* &quot;white&quot; (PL)
Complex adjectives are formed from adjective roots and lexical suffixes.
* &quot;large bird&quot;

===Affixes===
Halkomelem contains prefixes, suffixes, and infixes. All infixes of the language have been described in the preceding sections. Affixes are typically divisible into inflectional or derivational and grammatical or lexical categories, depending on their involvement in paradigms and meaning, however, a number of Halkomelem affixes mix these categories. Suttles (2004) identifies the following classes of suffixes and prefixes; a sampling of these affixes follow.

*Non-personal affixes
**Suffixes of the voice system
***Transitive: /-t/ /-nəxʷ/ /-x/ &quot;transitive&quot;
***Intransitive: /-əm/ &quot;intransitive,&quot; /-éls/ &quot;activity&quot; (compare &quot;get buried,&quot; &quot;bury it,&quot; &quot;plant,&quot; and &quot;bury something&quot;)
***Causative: /-stəxʷ/ &quot;causative&quot;
***Permissive: /-s/ &quot;let,&quot; as in &quot;let him go&quot; or &quot;let it be&quot;
***Applicative: /-nəs/ &quot;goal&quot; (e.g. as in &quot;go after him&quot;), /-ném/ &quot;go&quot;
***Reflexive: /-θət/ &quot;oneself,&quot; /-námət/ &quot;oneself (limited control)&quot;
***Reciprocal: /-təlʼ/ &quot;each other&quot;
***Subordinate passive: /-ət/ &quot;subordinate passive&quot;
**Aspectual and modal affixes
***Aspectual prefixes: /wə-/ &quot;established,&quot; &quot;wəɬ-&quot; &quot;already&quot;
***Modal suffixes: /-ə́lmən/ &quot;want to, intend to, seem about to&quot;
**Derivational affixes
***Affixes with purely grammatical meaning
****Nominalizing prefix: /s-/ &quot;nominalize (verbs and adjectives)&quot;
***Verbalizing affixes (combine grammatical and lexical meaning): /c-/ &quot;get, make, do, go to,&quot; &quot;ɬ-&quot; &quot;partake of,&quot; /txʷ-/ &quot;buy,&quot; /-àꞏl/ &quot;travel by&quot;
***Lexical prefixes: /mə-/ &quot;come,&quot; /tən-/ &quot;from&quot;
***Lexical suffixes
****Body parts: /-aqʷ/ &quot;head&quot;
****Common artifacts: /-wət/ &quot;canoe&quot;
****Natural phenomena: /-ətp/ &quot;plant, tree&quot;
*Personal affixes

===Possessive affixes===
The following table lists the possessive affixes which appear in attributive possessive structures in Halkomelem.

Possession is marked either on the possessed noun (the head) or the word preceding it through these affixes. Together with the appearance of affixes, possession also requires a structural component, in that the possessor of the head is found to the right of the head. The possessor is always preceded by a determiner, although depending on the noun class, it can also appear with an oblique case marker. If the possessor is a common noun, it will be introduced by a determiner, but without an oblique case marker. If, however, the possessor is a proper noun, it must appear in the oblique case. Thus, it will be preceded by an oblique case marker, and the possessed noun will appear without a possessive affix. For proper nouns, the determiner and the oblique case marker are fused into a single particle. Marking common nouns with an oblique case marker results in an ungrammatical construction:

Most verbs roots are semantically patient-oriented (e.g. they have glosses like &quot;get hit&quot; or &quot;get washed&quot;), while few verbs are semantically agent-oriented (e.g. &quot;look&quot; or &quot;see&quot;). All are grammatically intransitive. These relations are different with the suffixes of the voice system. A verb that is made up of an inactive root and an intransitive suffix is grammatically intransitive, but semantically active. An inactive or active root that takes on a transitive suffix is grammatically transitive and takes an object. The transitive suffix is the base for an object or passive person suffix. Two of the most commonly used transitive suffixes distinguish actions performed with limited control or accidentally from those performed with full control or purposely.

Aspectual prefixes, which precede predicate heads, have adverbial meaning and express temporal distinctions. Modal suffixes follow the suffixes of the voice system and indicate desire or intention and search or arrangement.

Lexical suffixes can be related to verb roots as objects, locus, or instruments; to adjective roots as noun heads; and to noun roots as noun possessors or the noun heads of modifiers.

The personal affixes distinguish first, second, and third person in singular and plural. There are neither dual forms nor inclusive/exclusive distinctions in this language. There is also a set of possessive affixes (prefixes for first and second person singular, suffixes for first-person plural and third person, and a combination of prefix and suffix for second-person plural). This system will be covered, in detail, in the &quot;Syntax&quot; section.

===Ordering of affixes===
Derivational prefixes and suffixes form an inner layer around the word root, while inflectional affixes form an outer layer around the root. Among derivational affixes, those with lexical meaning stand closer to the root than those with purely grammatical meaning. Among inflectional affixes, those of the voice and person systems stand closer to the root than the aspectual prefixes and modal suffixes.
*. &quot;[She] punches holes in the bottom of it.&quot;

==Syntax==
In Musqueam, a sentence minimally consists of a predicate. Predicate heads can be bare roots (e.g. &quot;far&quot;), derived forms (e.g. &quot;black bear&quot;), inflected forms (e.g. &quot;help him/her/them&quot;), and forms including both derivational and inflectional affixes (e.g. &quot;name-base-transitive,&quot; as in &quot;name a price&quot;). Predicate heads can also be words that are definable morphologically. This includes verbs (e.g. &quot;go&quot;), adjectives (e.g. &quot;big&quot;), nouns (e.g. &quot;man&quot;), members of the closed sets of personal words (see the following section), and interrogative words (e.g. &quot;what&quot;).

A verbal predicate may be expanded with the addition of one or two auxiliary verbs before the head and/or one or more adverbs preceding or following the head.
*&quot;ʔi&quot;(AUX) &quot;&quot;. &quot;I am helping him.&quot;
**Two pairs of verbs function as auxiliaries, setting the predicate within a spatial context. The choice between the locative pair, /ʔi/ &quot;be here&quot; and /niʔ/ &quot;be there,&quot; depends on the location of the speaker relative to whatever the predicate refers to. The directional auxiliaries, /ʔəmí/ &quot;come&quot; and /ném/ &quot;go,&quot; identify motions toward or away from the speaker.
*&quot;ƛʼ&quot;(ADV) &quot;&quot;. &quot;I did it again.&quot;
Verb heads are also found with verb complements and compound verbs.
*&#x27;(&quot;try&quot;) &#x27;. &quot;He tried to fly.&quot;

Like verbal predicates, adjectival and nominal predicates can be expanded with other elements. Nominal predicate heads can appear alone, followed by particles and adverbs.
*&quot;swə́yʼqeʔ cən&quot;. &quot;I am a man.&quot;
*&quot;swə́yʼqeʔ čxʷ ƛʼe&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;re a man too.&quot;
Syntactically, adjectival and nominal predicate heads appear with auxiliaries less often than verbs. Adjectives and nouns can appear together in nominal predicates expanded with adjectives. A nominal predicate head can be preceded by a modifying adjective or numeral.
*&quot;ʔə́yʼ&quot;(&quot;good&quot;) &quot;čxʷ&quot;(&quot;you&quot;) &quot;swə́yʼqeʔ&quot;(&quot;man&quot;). &quot;You&#x27;re a good man.&quot;
Adjectives usually appear as predicate heads accompanied by particles only, but they can be preceded by auxiliaries and adverbs acting as intensifiers.
*&quot;kʼʷámʼkʼʷəmʼ cən&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m strong.&quot;
*&quot;ni&quot;(AUX) &quot;ʔukʼʷámʼkʼʷəmʼ&quot;. &quot;He [absent] is strong all right.&quot;
*&quot;x̌ə́ɬ&quot;(ADV) &quot;qʼáqʼəyʼ&quot;. &quot;He was very sick.&quot;

===Person markers===
The Halkomelem person markers (forms that correspond in meaning to English personal pronouns) include a set of affixes, one set of particles, and two sets of words (personal and possessive). As mentioned in the &quot;Morphology&quot; section, there is no dual number or inclusive/exclusive distinction in the language, however, some scholars believe that the forms identified here as second-person &quot;singular&quot; were once used in addressing a married couple, a pair of brothers, or even a family, while the &quot;plural&quot; forms were used for a larger or less integrated group.

====First- and second-person argument particles====
The first- and second-person particles pattern like a nominative–accusative case marking system. In other words, the same particles mark first- and second-person arguments in both intransitive and transitive predicates in main clauses (coordinate constructions).

Suttles (2004) classified the first- and second-person argument particles as second-position predicate particles, along with about twenty other particles that can appear within the predicate. Most of the second-position predicate particles are mobile, appearing after the first word of the predicate (whatever that may be). If the only word in the predicate is the head, the first- and second-person argument particles will follow it; if the head is preceded by an auxiliary verb, they will follow the auxiliary; if the head is preceded by an adverb, they will follow the adverb.
*&quot;cʼéw-ət cən ceʔ&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ll help him/her/them.&quot;
*&quot;ʔi cən cʼécʼəw-ət&quot;. &quot;I am helping him/her/them.&quot;
*&quot;lə́qʼ cən wəmʼi técəl&quot;. &quot;I generally get here.&quot;

====Object person markers====
An object person marker can only be suffixed to a transitive verb (i.e. a verb stem that has a transitive suffix). The four forms appear to be composed of identifiable elements: /-S/ and /-am/ &quot;non-third-person singular,&quot; /-al-/ &quot;non-third-person plural,&quot; /-x/ and /-xʷ/ &quot;first person,&quot; and /-ə/ second person. Third-person objects are unmarked.

The element /-S/ occurs with the transitivizer /-t/, and they coalesce as /θ/. With the root &quot;cʼéw-&quot; &quot;help&quot; and /-t/ &quot;transitive,&quot; we find:
*&quot;cʼéwəθàmx&quot; &quot;help me&quot;
*&quot;cʼéwəθàlʼxʷ&quot; &quot;help us&quot;
These forms are normally accompanied by person markers.

====Third-person arguments====
The third-person arguments follow an ergative–absolutive system. With an intransitive predicate head, a third-person argument is like a third-person object in being marked by zero. Plurality is optionally indicated by the particle &quot;.
*&quot;. &quot;He/she/it/they will go.&quot;
*&quot;&quot;. &quot;They will go.&quot;

With a transitive predicate head in a main clause, on the other hand, a third-person agent must be marked by the suffix /-əs/. It always follows the transitivizer and object person marker, if any. Unlike the first- and second-person particles, the suffix does not move to follow an auxiliary or adverb. Again, the plurality of the third-person may be indicated by the particle &quot;.
*&quot;. &quot;He/she will help him/her.&quot;
*&quot;&quot;. &quot;He/she helped him/her.&quot;
*&quot;&quot;. &quot;They will see me.&quot;

====Constraints====
In the active paradigm, a third person cannot be the agent with a second person as the object. Instead, we find passive forms.
*&quot;&quot;. &quot;You folks will be helped.&quot;
Only third persons can be agents in the passive. Other relations (e.g. the forms &quot;*I am seen by you&quot; or &quot;*he is seen by me&quot;) can be expressed only in the active (e.g. &quot;you see me&quot; and &quot;I see him&quot;).

====Subordinate clauses====
A subordinate clause is produced by prefixing one of the two subordinating particles, /wə-/ &quot;if, when, that&quot; and /ʔəl/ &quot;whenever, whatever,&quot; to the first word in a predicate and replacing its coordinate agent marker with a subordinate agent marker. Subordinate agent markers are the same in both intransitive and transitive active predicates.

Subordinate clauses usually follow main clauses, but there are a few exceptions.
*&quot;kʼʷəcnámə cən ceʔ, wənémʼèꞏn&quot;. &quot;I will see you, if/when/that I go.&quot;

<doc id="1325005" wikidata="Q732876" url="?curid=1325005" title="Professional golf tours">
<text>Professional golf tours are the means by which otherwise unconnected professional golf tournaments are organized into a regular schedule. There are separate tours for men and women; most are based in a specific geographical region, although some tours may hold tournaments in other parts of the world.

At least 95% of professional golfers make their primary income as club or teaching professionals rather than from competition. A small elite in the profession who obtain income from prize money and endorsements are called &quot;touring professionals&quot;, &quot;tournament golfers&quot;, or &quot;pro golfers&quot;. The best golfers can make up to 8-figure incomes in U.S. dollars from tournament play. Including endorsement income, pro golfer Tiger Woods was the highest earning sportsman for much of the first decade of the 21st century, according to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine.

But making a living from tournament golf can be difficult. Tournaments have entry fees and the associated costs of travel and lodging, plus the hire of a caddie. Moreover, most tournaments have a &quot;cut&quot; after the second of four rounds, meaning that only the top half or so continue play. Only those who make the cut receive any prize money, and only the top players take home significant winnings.

==History==
The golf tour system evolved more by trial and error than by design. In the early days of professional golf, in each region of the world each professional tournament was established by a separate golf club, golf organisation or commercial sponsor. As the number of tournaments increased, the most talented professional golfers concentrated mainly on playing in tournaments rather than on club professional and golf instruction work. Once a good number of tournaments were being played in a region each year, they were formalised into a &quot;tour&quot;, which was supervised by a single organisation, although many tournaments continue to be run by separate bodies.

The PGA Tour was the pioneer of the tour system, and its establishment date is not very clearly defined. The PGA of America was established in 1916. Lists of players with the most wins in each season are available from that year, and career win totals are based on results from 1916 onwards. However, the idea of a &quot;tour&quot; had not firmly crystallised at that time and several important developments came much later. Bob Harlow was named manager of the PGA Tournament Bureau in 1930, the first &quot;playing pros&quot; organisation was formed in 1932, and money lists are available from 1934. However the PGA Tour itself dates the formal establishment of the Tour to 1968, when the &quot;Tournament Players Division&quot; split from the PGA of America. Similarly, the European Tour officially began in 1972, although it evolved from the British PGA circuit which merged with the Continental European circuit in 1977 before fully separating from the PGA in 1984. The dates of establishment of the other key tours include: LPGA Tour (1950); Sunshine Tour (1971), Japan Golf Tour (1973); PGA Tour of Australasia (1973), Asian Tour (1995). The Asian Tour was preceded by the Asia Golf Circuit, which operated from 1962 until 1999. The term &quot;circuit&quot; is often used to describe groups of professional golf tournaments, either organised tours, which may or may not include &quot;unofficial&quot; events, or simply to broadly categorize events in a local area or wider region.

As professional golf has continued to expand developmental tours such as the Challenge Tour (1986) and the Web.com Tour (1990; originally called the Ben Hogan Tour and later the Korn Ferry Tour) and senior tours such as PGA Tour Champions (1980; originally the Senior PGA Tour and later the Champions Tour) and the Legends Tour (1992; originally the European Senior Tour) have been established to give more golfers the opportunity to play on a tour, and to take advantage of the willingness of sponsors and broadcasters to fund an ever-increasing number of tournaments.

==Structure of tour golf==
There are more than twenty professional golf tours, each run by a Professional Golfers Association or an independent tour organisation which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. Most of the major tours are player controlled organisations whose commercial objective is to maximise the income of their members by maximising prize money. The larger tours have a tournament almost every week through most of the year.

Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who have earned their &quot;tour cards&quot;, meaning they are entitled to play in most of the tour&#x27;s events. A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a Qualifying School (&quot;Q-School&quot;); or, by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or, much rarer, by having enough notable achievements on other tours to make them a desirable member. Membership of some of the lesser tours is open to any registered professional who pays an entry fee.

There are enormous differences in the financial rewards offered by the various golf tours, so players on all but the top few tours always aspire to move up if they can. For example, the PGA Tour, which is the first-tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third-tier NGA Pro Golf Tour. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms, as of 2024, is as follows:

*Clear 1st: PGA Tour
*Clear 2nd: European Tour
*Clear 3rd: LPGA Tour
*Clear 4th: PGA Tour Champions
*Fifth to eighth (in alphabetical order): Asian Tour; Japan Golf Tour; LIV Golf; LPGA of Japan Tour
In the 1990s the Japan Golf Tour was the third richest tour, but in recent years its number of tournaments has been steadily contracting from a peak of 44 in 1990 to 24 in 2007, and tournament purses have risen only slowly. The (U.S.) LPGA saw a substantial decline in financial rewards in the late 2000s; when its commissioner Carolyn Bivens was forced to resign by a player revolt in 2009, it had only 14 events locked in for 2010. Its 2010 schedule was ultimately unveiled with 24 events, down from 34 as recently as 2008. The tour saw signs of recovery in 2012, with the addition of three new events, the sanctioning of a tournament in Australia, and the return of one tournament that had been off the schedule for a year. By 2014, the LPGA had largely recovered from its 2010 trough, with that year&#x27;s schedule consisting of 33 events.

The late-2000s economic crisis did not have an immediate impact on the PGA Tour, mainly because most of its tournament sponsors were locked in through 2010; there was media speculation that the expiration of those sponsorship contracts in 2011 would see substantial changes in the landscape of that tour. However, this speculation proved misplaced or at least premature, as the 2011 season was announced with only one less official money event than in 2010, with virtually identical prize money. The Asian Tour and the LPGA of Japan Tour enjoyed rapid growth in prize money in the early 2000s, and were less affected by the economic crisis than the U.S. LPGA.

==Men&#x27;s tours==

===International Federation of PGA Tours===
The International Federation of PGA Tours is an organization founded in 1996 to enable the world&#x27;s leading tours to discuss common and global issues in professional golf. The founding members were 
*the United States–based PGA Tour
*the PGA European Tour
*the Japan Golf Tour
*PGA Tour of Australasia
*the Southern Africa–based Sunshine Tour

In 1999 they were joined by the Asian Tour and a year later the Canadian Tour became an associate member. The South and Central America based Tour de las Américas became the federation&#x27;s second associate member in 2007.

In 2009 the federation announced a major expansion, as the Tour de las Américas and the Canadian Tour became full members alongside nine new members. They were 
*the PGA Tour China
*the Korean Tour
*the Professional Golf Tour of India 
*organizers of the six major Ladies tours (see below) 
In 2011, the Tour de las Américas was effectively taken over by the PGA Tour, then, after the Tour de las Américas held its 2012 season, it was folded into the new PGA Tour Latinoamérica. In October 2012, the Canadian Tour agreed to be taken over by the PGA Tour, with a name change to PGA Tour Canada taking effect that November.

The International Federation of PGA Tours founded the World Golf Championships in 1999 and sanction the Official World Golf Ranking.

===Other men&#x27;s tours===
World ranking points are also awarded for good placings in events on three developmental tours:
*Challenge Tour (second-tier tour to the European Tour)
*Korn Ferry Tour (second-tier tour to the PGA Tour)
*Asian Development Tour (second-tier tour to the Asian Tour), since 2013

In addition, until 2017 the OneAsia Tour, founded in 2009 as a joint venture between the PGA Tour of Australasia, the China Golf Association, the Japan Golf Tour, the Korean Golf Association and the Korean PGA, used to offer world ranking points. 

The richest tour not offering ranking points was until 2011 the Korean Tour.

The official development tour in Japan is the Japan Challenge Tour. Other regional tours include the Professional Golf Tour of India, PGA Tour China and All Thailand Golf Tour.

The United States and Europe have additional tours for players who haven&#x27;t made it onto the Korn Ferry Tour or the Challenge Tour. At this level the prize money is partly funded by entrance fees and only the most successful players will win enough to do more than cover their expenses: the emphasis is very much on moving up to a higher tour. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to, and others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part-time.

In Europe there is a well-defined third tier of tours which are independently operated but offer promotion to the Challenge Tour for the most successful players. The four third level tours, known as the Satellite Tours, are the PGA EuroPro Tour, the Alps Tour, the Pro Golf Tour and the Nordic Golf League. Starting July 2015, the four Europe-based third-tier tours was accepted into the OWGR rankings. Below this level there are various minor professional tournaments, some of which are organised into series by national golf associations.

In 2016, the Dubai-based MENA Golf Tour announced an affiliation with the Sunshine Tour and was included into the world ranking system. Starting in 2018, the Sunshine Tour-affiliated Big Easy Tour was added to the world rankings.

Three lower-level tours offer world ranking points and direct promotion to the Korn Ferry Tour for a top five finish on their Orders of Merit, but they are based outside the United States: PGA Tour Canada, PGA Tour China, and PGA Tour Latinoamérica. There is not a well defined US-based third tier. The larger regional tours include the Swing Thought Tour, Gateway Tour, and the APT Tour there is a constantly changing roster of small &quot;mini-tours&quot;.

The term mini-tour is colloquial and not easy to define, with the larger regional tours carefully avoiding applying the term to themselves. Some of the smaller and lower cost tours prefer the term &quot;developmental tour&quot; asserting that real pro golf with large audiences and great financial opportunities for its players starts at the Korn Ferry Tour level.

Either way, below Korn Ferry Tour level there is little possibility of earning a living from the prize money alone and players compete to gain competitive experience. Some are employed as club or teaching professionals and play tournaments part-time, while some may have sponsors or family backing. After the new Korn Ferry Tour Finals was established in 2013, mini-tour purses have decreased and players have moved to the Canada and Latin American tours.

There have also been some well known sportsmen from other sports who, after retiring as wealthy men while still at an age when elite golfers are in their prime, have tried their luck as tournament golfers on the developmental tours, but none of them have made it into golf&#x27;s elite so far. Examples include Ivan Lendl and Roy Wegerle. Two prominent professional athletes from other sports, however, have had modest success on the tour now known as PGA Tour Champions for golfers 50 and over. Former National Football League quarterback John Brodie won one tournament and had 12 top-10 finishes on that tour, and former Major League Baseball pitcher Rick Rhoden had three top-10 finishes.

===Men&#x27;s senior tours===
Upon reaching age 50, male golfers are eligible to compete in senior tournaments. Golf is unique among sports in having high profile and lucrative competitions for players of this age group. Nearly all of the famous golfers who are eligible to compete in these events choose to do so, unless they are unable to for health reasons. A number of players win more than a million dollars in prize money each season, and once endorsements and other business activities are taken into account, a few of the &quot;legends of golf&quot; in this age group earn as much as any of the younger PGA Tour pros. The two main senior tours are:

*PGA Tour Champions (based in the United States)
*Legends Tour (formerly known as the European Senior Tour, and sponsored as the Staysure Tour)

==Women&#x27;s tours==
Women&#x27;s professional golf is also organized by independent regional tours. Leading female golfers make incomes well over US$1 million per year, more than most other women athletes other than top tennis players. There are currently seven first tier regional tours:

*LPGA Tour (based in the United States)
*Ladies European Tour
*LPGA of Japan Tour
*LPGA of Korea Tour
*Ladies Asian Golf Tour, for Asia outside Japan and Korea
*WPGA Tour of Australasia, based in Australia
*Sunshine Ladies Tour, based in South Africa

The LPGA Tour is the dominant tour, and is the main playing base of almost all the world&#x27;s leading players. It also has tournaments in Canada, Mexico, France, England, Australia, China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and other Asian countries. The LPGA of Japan Tour is the second richest tour, and retains many of its leading players. The best players from the other tours usually move to the LPGA Tour at the earliest opportunity.

The second tier women&#x27;s professional tour in the United States is the Epson Tour (formerly the Futures and then the Symetra). Although there is little opportunity for women&#x27;s developmental play on the professional level in the United States besides the Epson Tour, women are welcome to compete against men on some mini-tours. At a lower level is the Cactus Tour, founded in 2005, which plays in the American Southwest. It expanded to hold 38 events in 2020, while the LPGA and Epson suspended play from April to August.

Sweden, which is the European country where women&#x27;s golf is most popular, had its own Swedish Golf Tour, established in 1986, since 2021 transformed to the Nordic Golf Tour, operated in cooperation by the golf federations in Denmark and Norway and Sweden.

The LET Access Series, launched in 2010, is the developmental tour of Ladies European Tour. The LPGA of Japan operates the Step Up Tour as a feeder for its main tour, and the LPGA of Korea operates two mini-tours (Dream Tour and Jump Tour) that effectively serve as feeders for its main tour.

The Moonlightgolf.com Tour in central Florida since 1992, offers women the opportunity to develop through frequent low cost pro/scratch events.

===Women&#x27;s senior tours===
In 2001, the U.S.-based Women&#x27;s Senior Golf Tour was founded, featuring golfers 45 and over. In 2006, it was rebranded as the Legends Tour and in 2021 The Legends of the LPGA. The LPGA of Korea now operates the Akia Tour, a four-event mini-tour for the same age group.

<text>Peter Dolving (born 24 October 1969) is a Swedish vocalist now living in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. He is best known as the former frontman of the metal band The Haunted.

== Career ==
Dolving began as a singer-songwriter playing in cafes in Sweden. He joined the band Mary Beats Jane and organized raves to support himself. He then opened the highly successful rock club called &quot;Underground&quot; in the basement of the restaurant Kompaniet in Gothenburg. Mary Beats Jane released their first album in 1994 and toured through 1997. Dolving has said Mary Beats Jane will never re-form.

Dolving then joined Swedish heavy metal band The Haunted in 1997 with former members of At The Gates (at the time they were experimenting with the name Death &amp; 1/2 Prod.), supporting himself by drawing fetish art and working as a carpenter. He left The Haunted after the first album, then returned in 2004 on the album &quot;rEVOLVEr&quot;. He eventually formed The Peter Dolving Band to perform his own songs and wrote spoken-word material for the short film &quot;No Justice No Peace&quot; by Jonas Olsen. The Peter Dolving Band no longer exists, with that style of music taken up by his BringTheWarHome project. Dolving incited the wrath of some metal fans with his unique soul-searching and frequent ranting in the Blog section of his official MySpace page. A candid interview with him appears in the documentary Working Class Rock Star. In 2011 Dolving joined the Swedish hardcore band Rosvo.

Dolving has resumed work on musical project entitled &quot;O&quot; with Scott Reeder.

== Personal life ==

Dolving has in several interviews stated that he considers himself an anarchist.

<text>The GMC Motorhome is a recreational vehicle that was manufactured by the GMC Truck &amp; Coach Division of General Motors for model years 1973–1978 in Pontiac, Michigan, USA — as the only complete motorhome built by a major auto/truck manufacturer. Manufactured in lengths, the design was noted for its front-wheel drive and its low profile, fully integrated body.

In contrast to most motorhomes which were manufactured on drivetrain-equipped frames supplied by a chassis manufacturer; GMC designed, engineered, and built the entire vehicle, and in most cases the interiors, completely in-house. Empty shells were also supplied to other RV manufacturers for interior outfitting and to specialty manufacturers for custom outfitting, ranging from mail delivery and mobile training facilities to people movers and ambulances.

==Design and specifications==

Industry rumors had been circulating for some time that GM was going to build a motorhome. On February 7, 1972, it was made official. About this time the new vehicle was known as the TVS-4, Travel Vehicle Streamlined. The motorhome design continued to evolve in the two main areas of styling and chassis. The Design Center was continuing with both the external and interior designs. There were twelve designers working with sketches and 1/8 scale (A-scale) clay models. Three or four of these 1/8 scale clay models were made, each with unique design characteristics, each refining their shapes closer to the final form. Once these models were completed, evaluated, and approved, full-sized drawings were made using 1/4 inch tape to outline the front, rear and side design. These drawings would guide the designers in the next stage: a full-size clay model.

The clay full scale motorhome was created. Once the shape was completed, the clay surface was &quot;polished&quot; with a sponge and cold water and finished with a silver-blue film of DI-NOC, replicating the painted surface of a vehicle. Upon completion of the full-scale clay, plaster cast segments were made of it. Dimensional drawings were made of this final design for tooling and early fiberglass prototype parts for the first prototype bodies.

The motorhome had a front-wheel-drive transaxle, which GM called the Unitized Power Package, originally used in the Oldsmobile Toronado and Cadillac Eldorado with an Oldsmobile V8 from the Toronado. In mid-1977 the engine was downsized to a V8. (At the time, the Buick Riviera, which shared most of the same components, and used the same E-body platform, as the Toronado and Eldorado until its 1977 downsizing, was still using the conventional rear-wheel-drive layout.) Both used the GM-designated Turbo-Hydramatic 425 automatic transmission, with a wide roller chain drive to connect the output of the longitudinally-oriented engine to the transmission. The final drive was connected directly to the transmission, and power was fed to the front wheels using half-shafts, one of which ran under the front portion of the engine. The engine was fueled with regular gasoline stored in two tanks. 

The GMC was equipped with front disc brakes and drums on all four rear wheels. The front-drive configuration eliminated the driveshaft and rear differential and the solid axle found on most front-engined motorhomes. As a result, the floor could be built with about clearance above the roadway. The floor was too low for a rear cross axle, and GM designed the rear suspension as a tandem pair of wheels, mounted on bogies that rode on pins attached to the sides of the low-profile frame. With the exception of the wheel wells, the rear suspension does not intrude into the living space. The rear bogies are suspended using a double-ended reversible sleeve airbag that is pressurized by an automatic leveling system to maintain the designed ride height. The leveling system can also be manually controlled to level the coach at a campsite. The overall chassis design, from the use of an existing GM E platform powertrain and a modified rear suspension, has been considered an early ancestor of the crossover.

The motorhomes were built in either or length, with about 90% of the total production being the latter. The wheelbase from the front wheels to the centerline of the rear tandem pairs is for the coach and for the coach. All GMC Motorhomes are wide and about tall including the usually-installed roof air conditioner. Interior head room is .

Gross vehicle weight rating for the coach was and for the coach. Most GMCs with factory interiors have a freshwater tank and a holding tank.

Body construction consisted of a rigid frame made of welded aluminum extrusions. The body frame was mounted on the chassis steel ladder frame using body isolators. The floor was marine plywood, except where it sloped up at the extremities, where they were plate aluminum. The body panels are fiber-reinforced plastic (fiberglass) below the waistline frame extrusion and at the ends. The upper side body and roof panels between the ends are sheet aluminum. All of the body panels are bonded to the frame using adhesive. GMCs are notable for their large expanse of windows, which redefined the RV industry at the time. They often had luxury features common on upper models of GM brands, such as cruise control, air conditioning, AM/FM/8-track sound systems, an aluminum/fiberglass body, as well as air suspension.

Rear lower compartments provide space for generators and propane tanks. GMCs were optionally supplied with generators from Onan in 4,000 Watts and 6,000 Watts, many of which are still in service. There were no driver&#x27;s or passenger&#x27;s doors at the front of the vehicle. A single door amidships on the passenger side provided access to the main passenger compartment. At the back of the vehicle, the entire rear body panel could be removed by loosening the bolts around its edges. This allowed beds, appliances, and other bulky items to be installed or removed.

==Cancellation==
A total of 12,921 GMC Motorhomes were produced from model years 1973 to 1978. The interior of the motorhome was constructed at the Gemini Corporation plant in Mt. Clemens, Michigan in 1973 and 1974 before being brought in house at GM for the remainder of production. Peter R. Fink, the owner of Travco motor homes, was the CEO of Gemini. The Gemini operation featured a progressive team concept with teams of workers constructing rooms of the motor homes in full, rather than performing repetitive tasks on an assembly line. Beginning operation in 1972, the plant featured state-of-the-art equipment including one of the first programmable routers. Gemini closed a few years after General Motors discontinued production of its motor homes. Over 8,000 are currently listed in an international registry. Estimates suggest that 3,000 to 4,000 of the original production may still be in running condition.

A press release datelined Pontiac, November 11, 1977, read as follows: “GMC Truck &amp; Coach Division of General Motors plans to discontinue producing luxury MotorHomes and similar TransMode multi-purpose vehicles and convert those plant facilities to expand truck operations, a GM vice president said today. Robert W. Truxell, general manager of GMC Truck &amp; Coach said, “As a result of this action, GMC will be able to utilize production facilities more effectively for servicing growing truck demands.” Another factor is that the driveline for the new 1979 E platform which was in the process of being downsized (and on which Buick would debut its first-ever front-wheel-drive Riviera) was lighter duty and incompatible with the GVW of the GMC motorhome where the existing Oldsmobile-sourced driveline was being phased out of production (the 403 and THM425 transaxle were phased out and replaced with the Oldsmobile 350 and THM325 when the downsized E platform was under development.)

==Influences==

Prior to the introduction of the GMC Motor home, a handful of other manufacturers made use of a similar front-wheel drive configuration and inspired the GMC configuration. These included the Cortez Motor Home from the Clark Equipment Corporation which initially offered a four-speed manual transmission with front-wheel drive, available from 1963 to 1970 until the division was sold to Kent Industries. From 1972 to 1977, a redesigned Cortez-SD was manufactured, initially by Kent and later a group of investors, using the same Oldsmobile 455 and three-speed automatic transmission that the GMC motorhome adopted in 1973.

Another parallel design was the Revcon motor home, which, starting in 1971, was an all-aluminum body front-wheel drive coach, initially with the same Toronado drive train as the later GMC. Beginning in 1978, the Revcon took on a more aerodynamic design similar to the just-canceled GMC Motor home, which included a slant nose and dual rear axle, while adopting a Chevrolet 454 engine and Turbo-Hydramatic 475 transmission. These were in production through 1990, with one coach built in 1991 using remaining components before the factory closed.

<doc id="1325018" wikidata="Q3489636" url="?curid=1325018" title="Punjabi Market, Vancouver">
<text>The Punjabi Market, also known as [[Little India#British Columbia|Little India]], is a commercial district and ethnic enclave in Vancouver, British Columbia. Officially recognized by the city as being primarily a major South Asian, Indo-Canadian and Punjabi population business community and cultural area, the &quot;Punjabi District&quot; is roughly a six block section of Main Street around 49th Avenue in the Sunset neighbourhood.

The Market marked its 50th anniversary on May 31, 2020, virtually due to the COVID pandemic.

==History==
=== Early immigration ===
The first South Asian immigrants from Punjab landed in Vancouver in the 1890s. The first Indian settlement is said to have come by the name of Paldi after a village near Hoshiarpur in Punjab. They settled down in Kitsilano near First Avenue and Burrard Street, where many worked in lumber mills and at construction sites throughout the Lower Mainland.

Indians who later immigrated to Vancouver are believed to have suffered the same treatment given to the Chinese (Chinatown) and Japanese (Japantown). They were subject to the bias and animosities of the predominantly Anglo-Saxon majority and occupied distinct and discrete quarters of the city. Most of the new residents sought established homes and to earn reasonably secure incomes. They settled in the area near 49th Avenue and Main Street and many established restaurants and businesses there and throughout the city to make a living. The settlers brought with them distinctive habits and attitudes that influenced the choice of food, work and recreational activity.

=== Establishment ===
Over time, the neighbourhood had become predominantly Indo-Canadian and on May 31, 1970, Sucha Singh and Harbans Kaur Claire opened the first shop on Main St, which would be joined by dozens more, between 48th and 50th avenues. The Claire&#x27;s owned and ran Shan Sharees and Drapery.

In recognition of the cultural and business importance of the market, the first bilingual street-signs in Punjabi and English were installed in 1993 at the corner of 49th avenue and Main Street.

=== Present day ===
Presently, the Punjabi Market is in a period of transformation. Gradually beginning in the 1980s, the suburbanization of the South Asian community in Vancouver caused many to relocate from South Vancouver east towards Surrey and Delta due to high rents and housing prices on relatively small properties. Enticed by cheaper housing for larger properties, new waves of South Asian immigrants in the 1990s and 2000s also preferred to settle in Surrey and Delta. Coupled with high retail rents and the geographical shift in the consumer base, the decline of the Punjabi Market in South Vancouver as a prominent South Asian inner-city district has occurred over the past two decades, with reports in 2013 citing growing retail vacancies. The market has evolved from the traditional food, clothing and jewellery stores to a more diverse offering, which now includes a licensed cannabis shop. Small businesses have been a hallmark of the market throughout the years, but are facing headwinds. Recent development of commercial space has brought chain stores such as a Tim Hortons into the heart of the market.

In 2016, the City of Vancouver first engaged a study and a community planning process to review neighbourhood policies impacting arts, culture, retail and public spaces. In October 2019 six community engagement events were held taking feedback about priorities for residents and business owners. The City of Vancouver staff produced a summary, which included public priorities and 8 recommended actions for Council to consider for the near term. The recommended actions included: Historic Context Statement, Cultural Grants, Vancouver Plan Activities, Near Term Public Realm Improvements, 50th Anniversary Proclamation, Community Art in Public Realm-Call for Artists, Commercial Area Capacity Building Work and Business to Business Support, and Long Term Community Stewardship Partnership.

==Punjabi District==

Over the years, the neighbourhood became increasingly popular among the nearly 300,000 South Asian residents in the city as a focal point for culture and commerce. There are a number of Indian restaurants, sweet shops, and grocers representing cuisine from varying parts of the subcontinent; as well as other businesses that cater to an Indo-Canadian community and tourists alike.

The market has become a shopping destination for many weddings because of the numerous Indian ethnic clothing and bridal goods that are available. There is also a significant number of jewelry stores lining the strip, said to be the highest concentration of jewellers in the nation.

==Events==
Beginning in 1979, the Khalsa Diwan society at the Ross Street Gurdwara has celebrated Vaisakhi each year in April with a public celebration. Festivities include Vancouver&#x27;s largest annual one-day parade, where up to 300,000 people come together from to celebrate the birth of the Sikh religion. Many restaurants and households near the strip offer local food tasting and other goods during the event.. The City of Vancouver has granted the Vaisakhi Parade Civic Parades Category in 2013, which is reserved for events with &gt;100,000 attendees.

<doc id="1325028" wikidata="Q5503421" url="?curid=1325028" title="Friction (band)">
<text>is a Japanese rock band formed in 1978. They originally began in 1971 under the name , and are considered to be one of the pioneers of Japan&#x27;s alternative rock scene. The group ended activities in 1996, but original member Reck reformed Friction in 2006 as a duo with drummer Tatsuya Nakamura.

In September 2007, &quot;Rolling Stone Japan&quot; rated their debut album &quot;Atsureki&quot; at #21 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time&quot;.

==History==
Originally formed in 1971 as an avant-garde music group by bassist Reck, saxophonist Chico Hige, and drummer Sakuro Watanabe in Tokyo, Japan. They changed the band&#x27;s name to 3/3 in the mid 70s, and Reck and Chico later moved to the United States, where they would form the band Teenage Jesus and the Jerks with Lydia Lunch and James Chance, and later became the original founding members of James Chance and the Contortions before returning to Japan.

Renaming 3/3 to form Friction, they recruited guitarist Tsunematsu Masatoshi, who had studied art at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts &amp; Music. They released a live album and single in 1979, and their first studio album, &quot;Atsureki&quot; (軋轢, meaning &#x27;friction&#x27; in Japanese) in 1980, produced by Ryuichi Sakamoto. Tsunematsu left the band in December 1980 to become a solo and visual artist. From then on, Friction has had numerous guest instrumentalists for lives and studio releases, all revolving around frontman Reck. The live video titled &quot;Dumb Numb&quot; was directed by Sogo Ishii. Friction went on hiatus in 1999 when Reck started producing for other musicians. In 2006, the group was reformed as a duo featuring Reck and drummer Tatsuya Nakamura.

<doc id="1325032" wikidata="Q1172415" url="?curid=1325032" title="Dataflow architecture">
<text>Dataflow architecture is a dataflow-based computer architecture that directly contrasts the traditional von Neumann architecture or control flow architecture. Dataflow architectures have no program counter, in concept: the executability and execution of instructions is solely determined based on the availability of input arguments to the instructions, so that the order of instruction execution may be hard to predict. 

Although no commercially successful general-purpose computer hardware has used a dataflow architecture, it has been successfully implemented in specialized hardware such as in digital signal processing, network routing, graphics processing, telemetry, and more recently in data warehousing, and artificial intelligence (as: polymorphic dataflow Convolution Engine, structure-driven, dataflow scheduling). It is also very relevant in many software architectures today including database engine designs and parallel computing frameworks.

Synchronous dataflow architectures tune to match the workload presented by real-time data path applications such as wire speed packet forwarding. Dataflow architectures that are deterministic in nature enable programmers to manage complex tasks such as processor load balancing, synchronization and accesses to common resources. 

Meanwhile, there is a clash of terminology, since the term &quot;dataflow&quot; is used for a subarea of parallel programming: for dataflow programming. 

== History ==
Hardware architectures for dataflow was a major topic in computer architecture research in the 1970s and early 1980s. Jack Dennis of MIT pioneered the field of static dataflow architectures while the Manchester Dataflow Machine and MIT Tagged Token architecture were major projects in dynamic dataflow.

The research, however, never overcame the problems related to:

* Efficiently broadcasting data tokens in a massively parallel system.
* Efficiently dispatching instruction tokens in a massively parallel system.
* Building content-addressable memory (CAM) large enough to hold all of the dependencies of a real program.
Instructions and their data dependencies proved to be too fine-grained to be effectively distributed in a large network. That is, the time for the instructions and tagged results to travel through a large connection network was longer than the time to do many computations.

Maurice Wilkes wrote in 1995 that &quot;Data flow stands apart as being the most radical of all approaches to parallelism and the one that has been least successful. ... If any practical machine based on data flow ideas and offering real power ever emerges, it will be very different from what the originators of the concept had in mind.&quot;

Out-of-order execution (OOE) has become the dominant computing paradigm since the 1990s. It is a form of restricted dataflow. This paradigm introduced the idea of an &quot;execution window&quot;. The &quot;execution window&quot; follows the sequential order of the von Neumann architecture, however within the window, instructions are allowed to be completed in data dependency order. This is accomplished in CPUs that dynamically tag the data dependencies of the code in the execution window. The logical complexity of dynamically keeping track of the data dependencies, restricts &quot;OOE&quot; CPUs to a small number of execution units (2-6) and limits the execution window sizes to the range of 32 to 200 instructions, much smaller than envisioned for full dataflow machines.

== Dataflow architecture topics ==
=== Static and dynamic dataflow machines ===
Designs that use conventional memory addresses as data dependency tags are called static dataflow machines. These machines did not allow multiple instances of the same routines to be executed simultaneously because the simple tags could not differentiate between them. 

Designs that use content-addressable memory (CAM) are called dynamic dataflow machines. They use tags in memory to facilitate parallelism.

=== Compiler ===
Normally, in the control flow architecture, compilers analyze program source code for data dependencies between instructions in order to better organize the instruction sequences in the binary output files. The instructions are organized sequentially but the dependency information itself is not recorded in the binaries. Binaries compiled for a dataflow machine contain this dependency information. 

A dataflow compiler records these dependencies by creating unique tags for each dependency instead of using variable names. By giving each dependency a unique tag, it allows the non-dependent code segments in the binary to be executed &quot;out of order&quot; and in parallel. Compiler detects the loops, break statements and various programming control syntax for data flow.

=== Programs ===
Programs are loaded into the CAM of a dynamic dataflow computer. When all of the tagged operands of an instruction become available (that is, output from previous instructions and/or user input), the instruction is marked as ready for execution by an execution unit. 

This is known as &quot;activating&quot; or &quot;firing&quot; the instruction. Once an instruction is completed by an execution unit, its output data is sent (with its tag) to the CAM. Any instructions that are dependent upon this particular datum (identified by its tag value) are then marked as ready for execution. In this way, subsequent instructions are executed in proper order, avoiding race conditions. This order may differ from the sequential order envisioned by the human programmer, the programmed order.

=== Instructions ===
An instruction, along with its required data operands, is transmitted to an execution unit as a packet, also called an &quot;instruction token&quot;. Similarly, output data is transmitted back to the CAM as a &quot;data token&quot;. The packetization of instructions and results allows for parallel execution of ready instructions on a large scale. 

Dataflow networks deliver the instruction tokens to the execution units and return the data tokens to the CAM. In contrast to the conventional von Neumann architecture, data tokens are not permanently stored in memory, rather they are transient messages that only exist when in transit to the instruction storage.

<doc id="1325038" wikidata="Q290171" url="?curid=1325038" title="Giuseppe Prina">
<text>Count Giuseppe Prina (20 July 1766 in Novara – 20 April 1814) was an Italian statesman killed in the Milan riots of 1814.

== Biography ==
Prina gave early evidence of his rare talent. After studying at the University of Pavia, he became a doctor of law in 1789. He worked in his native town, Novara, for some years as a lawyer.

From 1791 he was appointed with different charges in the Piedmontese administration of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In the first years of the French invasion of Piedmont, Prina refused any collaboration with the French, but after the battle of Marengo, he returned to public life. Napoleon Bonaparte appointed Prina Minister of Finance first in 1802 for the Italian Republic and then in 1805 for the new Kingdom of Italy.

Genial in private life, he was harsh and unyielding in his official capacity. His singular skill in devising fresh taxes to meet the enormous demands of Napoleon&#x27;s government made him the most-hated man in Lombardy. This was further intensified because he was a Piedmontese and he was regarded as a foreigner.

=== Murder ===

The news of the emperor&#x27;s forced abdication on 11 April 1814 reached Milan on the 16th, and raised hopes of Italian independence. The Senate assembled on 19 April and Prina&#x27;s party suggested that delegates should be despatched to Vienna to request that Eugene Beauharnais be raised to the throne of a free Italian kingdom. Despite precautions, the suggestion became public and provoked the formidable riot called the &quot;battle of the umbrellas&quot;. A furious mob burst into the senate on 20 April 1814, pillaged its halls and searched for Prina. Not finding him there, the rioters rushed to his house, which they wrecked, and seized the doomed minister, who was discovered in a remote chamber donning a disguise. Over the course of four hours, the angry rioters dragged him about the town, until wounded, mutilated, almost torn to pieces, Prina received his death blow.

The mob then insulted his miserable remains, stuffing stamped paper into his mouth. These indignities were enacted by day, in a thoroughfare crowded with citizens sheltered from the rain by umbrellas. The authorities were passive, and although some courageous persons actually rescued the victim at an early stage and concealed him in a friendly house, the mob soon discovered his refuge and were about to force an entrance, when the dying man surrendered to save his saviours&#x27; property. The riots and murder directly contributed to the re-establishment of Austrian rule in Milan.

The story of the murder of Prina is the subject of a play by G. Rovetta, entitled &quot;Principio di secolo&quot;.

<text>The Horizon () is a mechanical swing-lens panoramic camera. It is manufactured by Krasnogorsky Mechanicheskiy Zavod (KMZ) in Krasnogorsk, Russia, better-known for their range of Zenit cameras. The main characteristic of this camera is its rotating lens that takes in a 120° panorama as the shutter button is pressed. The current (2015) models are designated &quot;Horizon Perfekt&quot; and &quot;Horizon Kompakt&quot;.

==History==
The history of this camera dates back to the Soviet Union in the year 1948 when KMZ manufactured a very limited series of prototypes called &quot;FT-1&quot;, a small, boxy panoramic camera for 35 mm film. The first public edition was presented years later on the Brussels World Fair in 1958 under the name &quot;FT-2&quot;. Off the chronological order, an additional number of cameras labeled &quot;FT-3&quot; with prototype characteristics had already been produced in 1952 and 1953. &quot;FT&quot; stood for &quot;Fotoapparat Tokareva&quot; (&quot;Фотоаппарат Токарева&quot;), meaning Tokarev&#x27;s camera. Tokarev is said to have come up with the initial design. The film had to be loaded into special cassettes that then would be inserted into the camera. Until 1968 16,662 FT-2 were made and sold also abroad under the names &quot;Spiratone&quot;, &quot;Panorama&quot; and &quot;Spaceview&quot;. In 1967 it was succeeded by the &quot;Horizont&quot;. This camera already shared the basic looks with the present models and had similar technical specs: it had a f2.8/28 mm Industar lens and four shutter speeds, ranging from 1/30 s to 1/250 s. First introduced at Photokina in 1966, the Horizont created a picture using 24×58 mm frames on 35 mm film. It had an OF-28P (28 mm, f/2.8) fixed-focus lens and offers shutter speeds of 1/30 s, 1/60 s, and 1/125 s. Its body is 142 mm wide, 100 mm high, and 67 mm deep, and weighs 910 g (grip not included). After 49,849 units, this model was discontinued in 1973.

In 1989, the camera was picked up again by KMZ and reworked, especially on the exterior. This time KMZ called the camera &quot;Horizon 202&quot;. Instead of a metal case, the outside was now made of ABS plastic. The interior workings, however, did not change much. The biggest change was the addition of a second gear, resulting in an additional set of shutter speeds. This left the photographer with 8 speeds to choose from: 1/2 s, 1/4 s, 1/8 s, 1/15 s, 1/30 s, 1/60 s, 1/125 s, and 1/250 s. In latter models the speeds 1/15 s and 1/30 s were dropped in favor of a more evenly running mechanism. Since 2006 it is sold in a stripped down version with only two shutter speeds (1/2 s and 1/60 s) as &quot;Horizon Kompakt.&quot;

In 2003 an again reworked edition was presented, initially released as &quot;Horizon 203&quot; but then called &quot;Horizon S3Pro&quot;. This upgrade focused on design and performance, leaving the technical specs as they were. In 2005 the Lomographic Society International and KMZ partnered to sell the camera together under the name &quot;Horizon Perfekt&quot;.

From about 2000 to 2005 a medium format edition called &quot;Horizon 205 PC&quot; was produced in small numbers. This model, however, did not make it to mass production and was discontinued.

==Technical design==

Throughout all its history, the basic technical design remained unchanged: when the shutter button is pressed, a drum carrying the lens is rotating from left to right. Inside the camera through a small slit on the back of the drum, the captured image is projected on the film, which in turn also sits on a curved carrier. By varying the width of the slit, the time each segment of film is exposed to light is changed. With this trick, different shutter speeds can be achieved without changing the rotating speed of the drum. The entire mechanism is powered by a spring. The focus of the lens is fixed to the hyperfocal distance for the 28mm lens at f2.8 (approximately 13m which allows a depth of field from 5.5m to infinity). As the lens is stopped down the near focus limit increase by approximately 1m per stop to f8. F11 and f16 add about 0.5 m each so that by f16 all objects from about 1 meter onwards will be pictured sharp. On 35 mm film, the camera produces frames of a size of 24x58 mm.

<doc id="1325054" wikidata="Q720747" url="?curid=1325054" title="Tony Galento">
<text>Dominick Anthony Galento (March 12, 1910 – July 22, 1979) was an American heavyweight boxer. He is best remembered for scoring a third-round knockdown against Joe Louis in a world title stoppage loss in June 1939. Active from the late 1920s to the early 1940s, he compiled a record of 79 wins, 26 losses, and 6 draws. Besides Louis, Galento fought against several other prominent heavyweights of his era—including Al Ettore, Arturo Godoy, Lou Nova, and Max and Buddy Baer. Though assumed by some sportswriters to have been a reference to his &quot;pulchritude&quot; or physical appearance, Galento&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Two Ton&quot;, was apparently derived from his work as an iceman: a job he pursued in tandem with his pugilistic career. On one occasion, as a result of his ice-lugging commitments, Galento was reportedly upbraided by his cornerman for being late for a bout. &quot;Take it easy&quot;, the New Jersey-born slugger reputedly replied to his colleague&#x27;s complaint, &quot;I had two tons of ice to deliver on my way here. I&#x27;ll be right up.&quot; In addition to &quot;Two Ton&quot;, Galento was also known as the &quot;Jersey Nightstick&quot;, the &quot;TNT Kid&quot;, the &quot;One-Man Riot&quot;, the &quot;Orange Orangutan&quot;, and the &quot;beer barrel that walks like a man&quot;. The boxing historian Bert Sugar called him a &quot;human butcher block&quot;.

Galento is widely regarded as having been one of boxing&#x27;s most colorful characters. According to Chris Mead, a biographer of Joe Louis, he &quot;was a press agent&#x27;s dream.&quot; Anecdotes, some of which may be apocryphal, pertaining to his outlandish behavior and unschooled wit are common. On learning about Gene Tunney&#x27;s predilection for reading George Bernard Shaw, Samuel Butler, and William Shakespeare while in training camp, Galento is said to have remarked, in characteristic fashion, &quot;Shakespeare? I ain&#x27;t never hearda him. He must be one of dem European bums[.] Sure as hell I&#x27;ll moider dat bum.&quot; An alternative rendering of Galento&#x27;s commentary on Shakespeare runs as follows: &quot;Never hoid of him... What&#x27;s he, one of those foreign heavyweights? I&#x27;ll moida da bum.&quot; To Galento, all his potential opponents and competitors, even Joe Louis and the Bard of Avon, were &quot;bums&quot;. In fact, to Galento, nearly everyone was a &quot;bum&quot;.

== Early life ==

Galento&#x27;s parents hailed from near Naples in southern Italy. His father was a quarry worker. After immigrating to the United States, Galento&#x27;s father got a job in the Edison factory in West Orange, New Jersey. Galento was born in Orange, New Jersey on March 12, 1910. He grew up in an Irish neighborhood and attended the Park Avenue school in Orange until the fifth or sixth grade. At school, he was involved in various violent incidents. &quot;The kids used to call me to lick other kids&quot;, Galento reminisced, &quot;and if I couldn&#x27;t beat &#x27;em I&#x27;d use a club. The kids would bring me apples and oranges.&quot; On one occasion, in revenge for a kick to the stomach, Galento assaulted an older youth with a homemade pick handle: busting their head and their shoulder. On another occasion, Galento broke the ribs of a &quot;guy named Moe&quot; with a &quot;house brick&quot;. Robert F. Fernandez Sr., a &quot;highly recognized&quot; collector of boxing memorabilia, states that Galento &quot;quit school early for the simple reason that he hated it.&quot;

After leaving school, Galento worked for Mike Cirrillo, a local iceman. He also shone shoes on Sunday mornings. When he was fifteen, Galento had his own ice wagon and horse. At age sixteen, encouraged by his friend and future trainer Jimmy Frain, Galento started boxing at the Orange YMCA. When he was twenty, during prohibition and the Great Depression, Galento was involved in the running of a speakeasy. Later on, from the mid-1930s onwards, Galento owned and ran a saloon on Day Street in Orange.

Discussing his early years in 1969, Galento elaborated on the role of violence in his childhood and adolescence:

I was rotten when I was 12 and I was drinking when I was 15... The foist time I fought pro was in the schoolyard in Joisey. See, I come from a big family and all I ever got to eat at home was eggs and onions. So I started selling protection. S&#x27;pose some kid swiped your marbles, or kicked ya kid sister. Ya come to me and we make a deal. For a piece of pie, I beat the guy up. For a nickle, I bust him up. I was pretty mean then, at 12. If I couldn&#x27;t beat a guy up one day, I&#x27;d come back the next day with a baseball bat. When I was 15, I chased a guy named Eddie Ryan for four months. I finally caught him in a diner at 4 a.m. and knocked him through a window. Took &#x27;em an hour an&#x27; a half to bring him around.

==Style==

Galento was a &quot;slow and undisciplined fighter&quot; with a short reach. &quot;Time&quot; magazine described him as a &quot;throwback to Stone-Age man&quot; and disparaged his defence, which, it declared, took &quot;care of itself.&quot; According to the boxing writer Bob Mee, he had &quot;all the finesse of a charging rhino&quot;. The journalist Lew Freedman has written that if boxing as practiced by Joe Louis was indeed the &quot;Sweet Science&quot;, as &quot;practiced by Galento it might as well have been a different sport.&quot; Despite his reputation for stylistic crudity, Galento had several quality attributes. He could fight out of a crouch and had a formidable, and unpredictable, leaping left hook. He was also physically strong, durable, and fearless. The licensed boxing judge and combat sports commentator David L. Hudson Jr. writes that Galento &quot;had two characteristics that made him a tough opponent: He could absorb massive amounts of punishment, and he could punch.&quot; In a preview of his fight with Max Baer, the sportswriter Grantland Rice wrote that Galento &quot;expects to take his share of punches as part of the game. He absorbs them like open buds absorb the dew.&quot; In 1933, the promoter James J. Johnston and the matchmaker Sam McQuade named Galento, alongside Salvatore Ruggirello and Otto von Porat, as one of the hardest &quot;one-punch hitters&quot; in heavyweight boxing.

Regarding his allegedly unsportsmanlike conduct in the ring, Galento is reported to have said: &quot;Y’know, they usta call me a dirty fighter. Heck, I trained hard, maybe drank a little beer, took three showers a day and dose newspaper bums said I was a dirty fighter, da bums.&quot; Lou Nova, whom Galento defeated in a poorly officiated and bloody encounter in September 1939, called him a &quot;worm&quot; and intimated that the &quot;New Jersey jellyroll&quot; made illicit use of his thumbs. &quot;Baer may get rough, but he doesn&#x27;t deliberately try to maim a guy&quot;, Nova declared. &quot;I don&#x27;t mind saying that there is one fighter I don&#x27;t like. That&#x27;s Galento. He is... a worm!&quot;

In the first of a series of four articles written for &quot;The People&quot;, &quot;a populist Sunday paper&quot; with a wide circulation, the journalist A. W. Helliwell argued that, &quot;despite his lack of skill and ringcraft&quot;, Galento&#x27;s “tremendous strength and crushing punch&quot; made &quot;his rough-house tactics dangerous.&quot; Introducing Galento to a British audience prior to his title clash with Louis, Helliwell portrayed Galento as a pugilistic anachronism, a fighter out of time:

‘Two-Ton’ Tony was born more than a century too late. He and his antics belong to the roystering bare-knuckle era, to the picturesque days of Bold Bendigo, Deaf Burke and the Game Chicken. His eccentricities, queer methods of training and grotesque physique would have made him a worthy challenger to those colourful hammer-fisted champions of the past. 

==Training==

=== Physique ===
Sources differ regarding Galento&#x27;s height. He may have been 5&#x27;8&quot; or he may have been 5&#x27;9&quot;. One early news feature, in which Galento is described as a &quot;fistic curio&quot; and a &quot;low-chassised New Jersey youth&quot;, claims that he was only 5&#x27;6&quot;. Surveying his bodily dimensions, the Hall of Fame boxing referee Arthur Mercante Sr. drolly remarked that &quot;Galento stood maybe five foot eight inches tall; but he seemed five foot eight whichever way you looked at him.&quot; Whatever Galento would have measured, what seems certain is that he was on the shorter side for a heavyweight. As to weight, however, he was on the heavier side. Contrasting his physique with that of Joe Louis, who was a &quot;trim six-footer at 200 pounds&quot;, Joseph Monninger records that Galento &quot;stood a mere 5&#x27;8&quot; and weighed a flabby 240 pounds.&quot; A contemporary news item concerning their title fight states that Galento weighed in at 2331⁄4 lb versus Louis&#x27;s 2001⁄4 lb. Fernandez attributes Galento&#x27;s weight to &quot;his love of pasta and beer.&quot; According to Fernandez, the teenage Galento, at the start of his professional career in 1928, weighed in at around 165 lb—under the limit of the modern super middleweight division. By 1929, however, he tipped the scales at 200 lb. During his stint as a wrestler, Galento weighed as much as 275 lb.

Prior to his scheduled bout with John Henry Lewis in 1938 (which was cancelled), sportswriter John Lardner gave the following comic description of Galento&#x27;s physical shape:

The training grind has put Tony into a new kind of shape, unknown to science. Mathematicians are thinking of calling it the Galentoid. It is somewhere between a sphere and an ellipsis [&quot;sic&quot;], with overtones of parabola. It is covered with hair, and holds two gallons of Budweiser. The difference between Tony standing up and Tony lying on his right side is hard to detect with the naked eye, but, when he has a cigar in his mouth, you can tell which is north, and the rest is easy.

=== Preparation ===
Various accounts of Galento&#x27;s approach to training and preparation suggest that it was anything but orthodox. Monninger relates that Galento once wagered ten dollars that he could eat fifty hot dogs before taking part in a bout. Though he apparently consumed two hot dogs in excess of his bet (for a total of fifty-two), and consequently was so bloated as to be unable to fit comfortably into his trunks, Galento dispatched his &quot;hapless&quot; nemesis, the 6&#x27;4&quot; &quot;country puncher&quot; Arthur De Kuh, in the third or fourth round: bloodying his nose and sending him crashing to the canvas. As told by Mee, Galento&#x27;s conception of exercise was highly unusual: &quot;his idea of roadwork was to sit in a car smoking a fat cigar while his sparring partners got themselves in shape by plodding alongside.&quot; Mead concurs. Galento, he avows, &quot;did no roadwork and let his considerable appetite run free.&quot; In 1937, Eddie Brietz, a sportswriter with the Associated Press, noted that &quot;[u]sually reliable sources&quot; swore that the night before he &quot;kayoed Al Ettore in Philly&quot; Galento &quot;made away with 24 hot dogs, six shots of booze and... a dozen beers&quot;. A &quot;Sunday Star&quot; photograph of Galento in the run-up to his April 1941 &quot;10-round tiff&quot; with Buddy Baer portrays him scoffing a hot dog beside a plate of dozens more. &quot;Beer makes a guy strong&quot;, Helliwell quoted Galento as saying.

The legendary boxing trainer Ray Arcel, whose charges over a long and distinguished career included Roberto Durán and Larry Holmes, was not a fan of Galento. Tasked with training him by Jack Dempsey in 1933, Arcel believed that &quot;[t]rying to get Galento fit was a farce&quot;, that he &quot;was just bone lazy&quot;, and that working with him was a &quot;waste of time and money&quot;. Dempsey himself, though he had seen great potential in the young Galento—potential enough to become his manager—came to agree. As Donald Dewey relays in his 2012 biography of Arcel (drawing on a &quot;floridly ghosted&quot; column that appeared under Arcel&#x27;s byline in the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; in 1948), Dempsey&#x27;s disillusionment with Galento culminated in the &#x27;Manassa Mauler&#x27; humiliating the &quot;New Jersey Fat Boy&quot; in the ring at Stillman&#x27;s Gym in New York City:

Dempsey strolled quietly into the gymnasium and walked up to the balcony while Galento was going through the motions of &#x27;working out.&#x27; He was fatter than ever, hopelessly out of condition, and quite obviously doing nothing about it... He didn&#x27;t see Dempsey and continued waddling around the ring, clowning and wisecracking as he fooled with his sparring partners. After watching a couple of rounds, Dempsey came down to ringside. He was wearing a beautifully cut light gray suit, tan and white shoes, and white silk shirt. When Tony caught sight of him, he gave him a big hello. &#x27;You look like a million bucks dis afternoon,&#x27; he says to him. &#x27;Never mind how I look, you big bum,&#x27; Dempsey answers. &#x27;Let&#x27;s see you do some work.&#x27;

He [Dempsey] took off his coat and stripped right down to his white silk monogrammed underpants and vaulted into the ring: &#x27;Now, Tony,&#x27; he told him. &#x27;It&#x27;s you and me. I&#x27;ll show you how we used to do it.&#x27; He began humming a little tune—an old Dempsey mannerism—and then, as Galento backed away, he flashed into action. Jack was turned forty but his body was as lean and hard and tanned as ever, and for three memorable minutes we saw the old Dempsey, the murderous, tear-away Manassa Mauler... What he did to Galento in those three minutes was nobody&#x27;s business. He ripped punches into the pudgy torso from all angles, split his lips with a terrific left, and sent the blood squirting from his nose with a right.

[Dempsey chased after Galento], throwing punches until I [Arcel] called time. Still breathing easily, Dempsey ducked under the ropes and began to dress while Galento stood shaking his head in a semi-daze and trying to wipe the blood from his face with the backs of his gloves. When he [Dempsey] was dressed, he threw Galento a contemptuous look. &#x27;That&#x27;s how we used to fight, Galento,&#x27; he said. &#x27;Now I&#x27;m through with you. You can find yourself another manager.&#x27; Then he turned to me and said, &#x27;You were right, Ray. It&#x27;s a waste of time trying to make a champ out of that chump.&#x27;

Comparing Galento to Joe Louis in terms of their professionalism, the sportswriter Henry McLemore wrote that whereas Louis &quot;shuns alcohol, tobacco, [and] late hours&quot;, &quot;Galento drinks, smokes, and stays up later than an owl with insomnia.&quot; &quot;Louis believes in the outdoor life and healthful exercises&quot;, McLemore continued, but &quot;Galento likes to train in a nice dark, smoke-filled poolhall, where the terrific racket made by songbirds, bees and rippling brooks doesn&#x27;t interfere with his concentration.&quot;

=== Retrospect ===
In an interview with Hubert &#x27;Hu&#x27; Blonk of the &quot;Wenatchee World&quot; in 1969, the aging Galento cast a retrospectively critical eye on the nature of his training. Galento told Blonk that he &quot;used to work out two or three hours every day for a fight and run six miles&quot;, and then, after his exercise, decamp &quot;across the street&quot; and drink ten or so bottles of beer. &quot;You can&#x27;t&quot;, Galento informed Blonk, &quot;be an athlete and drink.&quot;

=== Insult ===
On account of his relative corpulence, Galento&#x27;s name, inclusive of &quot;Two Ton&quot;, was at times used as a childish insult or taunt. The prominent American literary critic Henry Louis Gates Jr. recounts in his memoir &quot;Colored People&quot; that during his childhood his father and brother would call him &quot;Two-Ton Tony Galento&quot; due to his being overweight.

==Heavyweight championship fight==

=== Build-up and event ===
On June 28, 1939 in Yankee Stadium in the Bronx in New York City, Galento fought for the heavyweight championship of the world against the &#x27;Brown Bomber&#x27; Joe Louis. Louis was a heavy favorite and &quot;1 to 8 in the betting&quot;. In a prefight poll conducted by the Associated Press, only three sportswriters picked Galento to win. 34,852 attended and the gate amounted to $333,308. Famous and otherwise notable attendees included Tyrone Power, Gene Tunney, Jack Benny, Mary Livingstone, Andy Devine, New York Governor Herbert H. Lehman, and &quot;head G-Man&quot; John Edgar Hoover. NBC broadcast the bout and crowds gathered around radios all across the United States. Galento secured his title shot via a run of good form—a string of eleven straight victories—and the promotional skills of his manager Joe Jacobs: a &quot;ballyhoo wizard.&quot; Fernandez writes that Galento &quot;looked and sounded like a Damon Runyon character&quot;, and Jacobs—who had Galento pose for the press &quot;smoking cigars while punching the bag&quot;, &quot;downing full pitchers of beer&quot;, and &quot;carrying kegs of beer to &#x27;enhance his training&#x27;&quot;, all the while repeating &quot;I&#x27;ll moider da bum&quot; in his &quot;thick New Joicey accent&quot;—&quot;made him even more so.&quot; With his &quot;carefully built picture of a fat, lazy man who never trained except on endless cigars and gallons of beer&quot;, the &quot;Derry Journal&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Roundabout in Sport&quot; recollected in 1963, &quot;Galento climbed the contenders&#x27; ladder more because he was the best publicity man in the business than because he was the best fighter.&quot; In light of Galento&#x27;s well-publicized antics, the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, though it regarded prize fighting as &quot;anti-social&quot;, indicated its preference for the &quot;clean-living Louis creed as opposed to the self indulgence of Galento and his beer kegs.&quot;

In the weeks leading up to the fight, in order to gain a competitive advantage and arouse still further interest, Galento and Jacobs attempted to unsettle and &quot;psych&quot; Louis. Jacobs accused Louis of having &quot;held a metal bar inside his right glove the night he knocked out Max Schmeling&quot;, and Galento, without warning or invitation, took to &quot;call[ing] the champion on the phone, insult[ing] him, and predict[ing] a knockout victory.&quot; Donald Dewey alleges that Galento, during his &quot;late night calls&quot; to Louis, would &quot;whisper threats and shriek racial epithets&quot;. Monninger writes that Galento &quot;embraced the racist stereotypes of his day&quot;, and, in his telephone calls to Louis, &quot;questioned his manhood, talked about his race, [and] made sexual references about Marva, Louis&#x27;s wife.&quot; Looking back on his fight with Galento on the PBS sports nostalgia show &quot;The Way It Was&quot; on January 29, 1976, an episode on which Galento was also a guest, Louis alluded to Galento&#x27;s prefight behavior. In response to a question from the veteran broadcaster Don Dunphy about whether he was ever &quot;really mad&quot; at an opponent, Louis curtly dismissed the suggestion of Schmeling, laughed, and said:

That&#x27;s not so. I wasn&#x27;t mad at Schmeling. That was all newspaper stuff. Schmeling and I were good friends... But that little fellow [Galento]... he really got me mad. All those mean things he said about me while training for our fight. He got me mad, all right. So I decided to carry him for a while in the fight and punish him for those nasty things. But when he knocked me down in the third round, I decided I better not fool around. He hit too hard. So I knocked him out as quickly as I could.In later years, Galento apologized for his conduct. Louis entertained no hard feelings. He concluded that Galento, despite his gruff exterior and exuberant—even sometimes bigoted—braggadocio, had &quot;no harm in him&quot; and was &quot;just full of wind, like the barber&#x27;s cat.&quot;

In the first round, Galento—&quot;his body crouched, his hands at the sides of his head as if prepared to lock his thumbs in his ears like a pretend bull&quot;—started brightly. He opened with his left: twice swatting at Louis, who, stepping to the side, evaded his attack. Galento persisted and swatted again: stunning Louis with a &quot;full-bore left hook&quot; that drove the champion to the ropes. Galento tried to capitalize on Louis&#x27;s discomfort with a &quot;hacking&quot; right cross. Louis, however, calmly took it on his gloves. Louis returned to the center of the ring, fended off Galento&#x27;s &quot;galumphing&quot; advances, and started to land his jab almost at will: &quot;jar[ring] Galento&#x27;s head back onto his shoulders&quot;. Expert opinion granted Galento the first round. He had landed the biggest blow.

In the second round, Louis began to settle into his rhythm. He worked off of his jab and hit Galento with multiple combinations. Galento&#x27;s face reddened and blood started to flow from his nose and his brow. Lacking other options, given his lackadaisical training and &quot;inattention to technique&quot;, Galento continued to trundle forward, looking to land his left. With seconds to go in the round, Louis, following up a successful straight right, caught Galento with a &quot;crisp left on the point of the chin&quot; that put &#x27;Two Ton&#x27; down on the seat of his pants. Galento quickly jumped to his feet. He had never been dropped before in his professional career.

In the third round, Louis circled and angled, while Galento, &quot;frog-hopping&quot;, followed. Louis landed jabs and crosses. Still in a crouch, &quot;Galento bobbed and moved and took Louis&#x27;s fists.&quot; In the middle of the round, Galento beat Louis to the punch: sending the champion to the canvas with a sharp left hook. Galento&#x27;s moment of glory, the highpoint of his career, didn&#x27;t last long. &quot;Louis stayed down only a moment&quot; and Galento failed to press his advantage. Louis closed the round on the front foot. &quot;In the last seconds of round three, Louis connected with a right, a left to the body, another right. Galento waded through the punches, trying to ignore them, trying to find the punch that had lifted Louis, but the cumulative weight of the Bomber&#x27;s blows began to sag him.&quot; Louis&#x27;s clouts had an enervating effect.

In the fourth round, Louis went on as he had finished the third: &quot;pelting Galento, hitting him with solid punches while Galento&#x27;s hooks scraped air.&quot; Galento was running out of gas. A minute, &quot;or thirty punches&quot;, into the round, a round in which the &#x27;Nightstick&#x27; landed little of significance, Louis knocked Galento sideways with a &quot;perfect right to the chin&quot;. &quot;Louis followed up smoothly&quot; and encountered no resistance. Galento&#x27;s defence, such as it was, was absent without leave. Louis continued to attack: Galento slumped towards the ropes and fell to his knees. At 2 minutes, 29 seconds of the fourth round, referee Arthur Donovan stopped the fight. Louis retained his heavyweight crown. By the lights of the sports columnist John A. Cluney, the fourth round, on account of its one-sidedness, &quot;was nothing short of modified murder.&quot;

=== Post-fight opinions ===
In the wake of the fight, sportswriters expressed a variety of opinions. In his &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; column, Francis E. Stan averred that Galento &quot;did more damage and produced more thrills than more illustrious opponents of Louis such as Primo Carnera, King Levinsky, Max Baer, Paulino Uzcudun, Jack Sharkey and Nathan Mann.&quot; John Lardner surmised that &quot;Tony had the chance to consummate the weirdest and wildest upset of this generation of cauliflowers. But he couldn&#x27;t.&quot; The Washingtonian Elliott Metcalf was singularly unimpressed with the bout and offhandedly referred to it as a &quot;disgusting heavyweight thing&quot;. Grantland Rice praised Galento as a &quot;game, stout-hearted opponent&quot;, but was under no illusions as to the doughty and vociferous Jerseyan&#x27;s fistic inferiority. Riffing on a quote from Lord Byron, Rice wrote that &quot;[a]ll that happened to brave Tony in the Yankee Stadium last night was a violent and bloody mixture of lashing, laceration, mayhem, face-lifting assault with two dangerous weapons and a touch of TNT.&quot; Alongside depreciating Louis&#x27;s ability to take a punch and Galento&#x27;s ability to give one, the &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot;&#x27;s Dan Parker approvingly characterized the fight as a &quot;glorious throwback to Stone Age brawling&quot; and a &quot;spine-tingling brawl&quot;. Holding forth on what provided his &quot;greatest thrill in sports&quot;, United Press newsman Jack Cuddy wrote in 1943 that &quot;[a]mid the electrifying incidents and heroic performances that have stood out like sharply-etched mountain peaks through the years, the Louis-Galento fight to me was the most prominent of all.&quot;

Though in the end he was soundly beaten, Galento maintained that victory could have been his if those around him had allowed him to fight his own fight: that is, if they had allowed him to foul and roughhouse Louis. &quot;If I had the right manager&quot;, Galento divulged to the journalist W. C. Heinz, &quot;he woulda said: &#x27;Go out and hit him low.&#x27; I woulda butted and thumbed him. I coulda been champion of the world.&quot; The celebrated Whitey Bimstein, Galento&#x27;s cutman for the fight, distinctly disagreed. If Galento had simply kept to his instructions, Bimstein believed, he could very well have won:

I still think Tony Galento would have licked him if he obeyed orders. We had Tony bobbing and weaving in the first two rounds, and he had Louis dizzy. He even knocked Louis down. Then he thought he was John L. Sullivan and came up straight to slug, and you can&#x27;t just do that with Louis. If Tony had fought the way he was told, he might have got in another shot that would have kept Louis down for keeps—and I don&#x27;t think Tony was the greatest fighter in the world, either.As for the champion&#x27;s evaluation of the fight, Louis purportedly described it as one of the toughest he ever had. &quot;Dat white boy hits like hell&quot;, he supposedly exclaimed. &quot;Joe said he had to hit him [Galento] a dozen times as hard as he ever hit a man&quot;, the Associated Press sportswriter Gayle Talbot informed his readers, &quot;before Tony finally fell into the referee&#x27;s arms, groping for the ropes in a desperate effort to keep his feet.&quot; Asked by Bob Cahn of the &quot;Tacoma Times&quot; if Galento could hit hard, Louis replied: &quot;Hard enough to knock me down.&quot; In 1948, 59 fights into his professional career, Louis ranked Galento as his tenth toughest foe: behind Conn, Braddock, Baer, Farr, Schmeling, Walcott, Godoy, Pastor, and Sharkey.

Commenting on the fight in a letter to his son, Patrick, Ernest Hemingway amusedly mused that &quot;Galento certainly came very close to knocking Louis out and if he can do that on beer I wonder what he could do on Frozen Daiquiris?&quot;

==Other fights==

=== Lou Nova ===
Among Galento&#x27;s other notable fights were his contests with the former champion Max Baer and the contender Lou Nova. The Nova fight—held in Philadelphia on September 15, 1939—enjoys a reputation as one of the dirtiest and bloodiest ever fought: earning its &quot;venue the name of Filthydelphia among sportswriters&quot;. Galento &quot;used his head as a battering ram, his thumbs to gouge Nova&#x27;s eyes, and the laces of his gloves to rake Nova&#x27;s face.&quot; &quot;Rabbit punches, kidney punches, and low blows were followed by verbal abuse.&quot; The clean-cut Nova, albeit with limited success, attempted to respond in kind. &quot;The only thing that &#x27;Two-Ton&#x27; Tony didn&#x27;t do to Nova, when he had him temporarily on his heels&quot;, the Connecticut journalist Jim Morcaldi alleged, &quot;was... bite him.&quot; Lewis Atchison, a staff correspondent at the Washington &quot;Evening Star&quot;, wrote that &quot;Tony used everything but a blunt instrument on his dazed and bloody opponent&quot;. The newspaperman and author Sid Feder reckoned the fight to have been as &quot;gory and bloody a spectacle as any slaughterhouse ever witnessed&quot;—Galento and Nova &quot;slugged and mauled, rushed in and clinched, but mostly they just fired left hands and watched the blood spurt.&quot; Referee George Blake stopped the bout at 2 minutes, 44 seconds of the 14th round. Nova suffered four knockdowns and Galento won by technical knockout. Gayle Talbot, who characterized Galento&#x27;s performance as a &quot;surprising and amazing exhibition of hard punching and endurance&quot;, proclaimed that &quot;[b]oth fighters appeared as if they had been hit by trucks at the finish&quot;. After the fight, Nova said that if Galento wanted to win dirty &quot;it&#x27;s all right, but he won&#x27;t go to heaven.&quot; Galento, for his part, paid tribute to Nova&#x27;s toughness, but claimed to have been unbothered by the Californian&#x27;s power: &quot;Naw, he didn&#x27;t hurt me. Here, gimme my pants, I wanna go home.&quot; Both men were hospitalized and sustained detached retinas. Nova received eleven stitches: five above and six below his right eye. In a retrospective account of Galento versus Nova published in 1951, the Australian boxing writer John Murphy christened the bout the &quot;grisliest knock-em-down and drag-em-out since the days of the last century bully boys.&quot;

=== Max Baer ===
Derisively referred to by some newsmen as the &quot;Battle of the Bums&quot;, Galento&#x27;s fight with Max Baer was hosted in Jersey City on July 2, 1940. The bout was originally scheduled for May 28, but was postponed following the death of Joe Jacobs, Galento&#x27;s manager, on April 24. Though he ended up the bookies&#x27; favorite, Fernandez writes that Galento &quot;wanted no part of Max&quot; as he knew Baer &quot;could really bang and could box well if he so desired.&quot; Odds on Galento to best Baer shortened further when it came to light that Galento had &quot;thought up an eleventh-hour epithet&quot;—a &quot;mystery adjective&quot;—which he intended to hurl at Baer, and thereby presumably discomfit him, just prior to the fight&#x27;s commencement. During the build-up to the match various choice words were swapped between the opposing camps. Galento &quot;scornfully&quot; called Baer &quot;Peanut Heart&quot; and Baer called Galento &quot;pig eye&quot;. According to Ray Arcel, Galento was perhaps the only fighter whom Baer &quot;couldn&#x27;t stomach&quot;. The attendance was 22,711 and Baer won by technical knockout. Galento failed to answer the bell for the start of the eighth round. Reflecting on the nature of Galento&#x27;s defeat, Henry McLemore likened the &#x27;Jersey Nightstick&#x27; to the ill-fated &#x27;Little Caesar&#x27;: &quot;Watching Galento grope towards his helpers at the close of the seventh round I could not help but remember the finish of the book &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, in which the gangster, after years of high rolling, found himself in the gutter, dying of bullets. &#x27;Is this the end?&#x27; he cried. &#x27;Is this the end of Little Caesar?.&#x27; Tony must have felt like crying &#x27;Is this the end of the Great Galento?.&#x27;&quot; Much more so than &#x27;Madcap Maxie&#x27;, Galento shipped a lot of punishment over the course of their encounter. Bill Fitzgerald, a Transradio sportswriter, opined that Baer had given Galento &quot;one of the most merciless beatings in the history of boxing&quot;. &quot;For seven rounds Baer made faces at Galento&quot;, Fitzgerald quipped, &quot;and made Galento&#x27;s face look like a comic strip version of the man from Mars.&quot; Gayle Talbot shared similar thoughts. Baer &quot;took his time, dodged Galento&#x27;s mighty lunges, and steadily punched the fat man into a state bordering on helplessness.&quot; Though the effect it had on the bout&#x27;s outcome may not have been decisive, Galento&#x27;s preparation for the fight was far from ideal. As Whitey Bimstein recalled:

What a guy... The first time I was called upon to take charge of him [Galento], I watched him work out, then we went back to his tavern for dinner. And what do you think he ate? A big platter of meatballs and spaghetti! Two days before he fought Max Baer. And two days before the fight they called me and told me he had a fight with his brother and that his brother shoved a broken glass in Tony&#x27;s face and split his lip. We fixed that up and the day of the fight, at three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, he ate more meatballs and spaghetti and drank a dozen bottles of beer. Baer walked right out, smacked him with a right in the mouth and dug a left hook into his stomach. After that was repeated a few times, Tony was through.

=== Ernie Schaaf ===
A lesser known Galento contest—his June 7, 1932 battle with Ernie Schaaf in Newark—may have been a particularly consequential one. As recorded by Joseph G. Donovan in his 1939 &quot;Galento the Great&quot;, a terse and laudatory biographical tome that was published to coincide with Galento&#x27;s shot at fame and fortune (his world title fight with Joe Louis), certain Newark &quot;fight writers&quot; attributed Schaaf&#x27;s death following his fight with Primo Carnera in 1933 to damage inflicted in his tussle with Galento. Whatever truth, if any, there may be to the idea, at least one contemporary press account pronounced that Schaaf had &quot;won an easy ten round decision&quot;. Though Galento very occasionally managed to land a hard right to Schaaf&#x27;s head, and, in the second and third rounds, shook Schaaf with &quot;left hooks to the jaw&quot;, Schaaf was apparently the superior infighter and &quot;administered a terrific battering to Galento in the fifth round, opening cuts on his cheek, mouth and left eyebrow.&quot; &quot;The fair-haired Boston boxer had an easy time with his opponent&quot;, it was reported, &quot;but was unable to knock out the rugged ice man.&quot;

Following a post-mortem examination, performed in the aftermath of his fight with Carnera, Dr Charles Norris, the chief medical examiner of New York City, determined that &quot;[i]nflammation of the brain, probably due to an attack of influenza, was the primary cause&quot; of Schaaf&#x27;s death. Nevertheless, the possibility that Galento was in part responsible for Schaaf&#x27;s demise was again rehearsed in &quot;Ring&quot; magazine in 1972.

== Life after boxing ==

=== Wrestling and acting ===

After retiring as a boxer, Galento turned his hand to professional wrestling. He squared off against fellow ex-heavyweight contender Primo Carnera, grappled an octopus in a giant fish tank in Seattle, fought a 550 lb bear in a cage in Newark, and boxed a kangaroo in Atlantic City. Among Galento&#x27;s human adversaries in the wrestling ring, other than Carnera, were Man Mountain Dean, Kola Kwariani, and &quot;Nature Boy&quot; Buddy Rogers. The boxing and wrestling promoter Babe Culnan told W. C. Heinz that Kwariani—who had shared a ring with such wrestling luminaries as Strangler Lewis, Gus Sonnenberg, and Stanislaus Zbyszko—called Galento the &quot;strongest man I&#x27;ve ever been in with.&quot; As well as tangling in the squared circle himself, Galento refereed numerous matches. In 1963, for example, he officiated a meeting between Bobo Brazil and Gorilla Monsoon at an &quot;all-star&quot; show in the Washington Coliseum that was promoted by Vince McMahon.

In retirement, Galento also took to acting. On the silver screen, he appeared in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1955), &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot; (1956), and &quot;Wind Across the Everglades&quot; (1958). On the boards, he played the role of &#x27;Big Jule&#x27;—a part most associated with the nightclub comedian B. S. Pully—in a 1955 production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; that was staged in a tent near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Regarding his transition from sportsperson to thespian, Galento said that, in light of his wrestling experience, acting wasn&#x27;t really new to him as he had been &quot;hammin&#x27; all over the joint for the last 12 years.&quot;

In a conversation with the academic William Baer, the screenwriter and producer Budd Schulberg said of Galento that he was a &quot;natural actor, and I think he was terrific, except he couldn&#x27;t remember his lines.&quot;

=== Legal difficulties ===
Post-boxing, Galento experienced various legal difficulties. In 1943, following an altercation with a motorcycle patrolman named James Meehan, he faced charges of &quot;assault and battery, disorderly conduct and refusal to put a nickel in a parking meter.&quot; &quot;Police Judge Philip Singer found Galento [guilty] on assault and battery charges and fined him $65.&quot; In 1946, Galento was arrested on a gambling charge. In 1954, James J. Venere of Newark, a former tenant in an apartment owned by Galento, brought a suit against the &quot;rotund former prize fighter&quot; that alleged that Galento had illegally impounded &quot;$1,400 worth&quot; of his possessions in lieu of the payment of rent. In court, Galento grimaced and affected incredulity: &quot;I&#x27;m no lawyer... All I know is this guy owes me $200 rent and HE&#x27;S suing ME!&quot; In 1959, Galento and his wife, Mary, were convicted of gambling offences. Galento was fined $25, and Mary, for &quot;maintaining a gambling house&quot;, was fined $125.

In 1957, it was reported in certain African American newspapers that &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Joe Louis filed a $250,000 slander suit&quot; against Galento, &quot;charging defamation of character.&quot; The suit resulted from remarks Galento allegedly made about Louis on an episode of Mike Wallace&#x27;s &quot;Night Beat&quot; television program. Galento reportedly claimed that Louis was a &quot;pushover&quot; whom he would have handily &quot;licked&quot; if he, Galento, who had a battle with pneumonia in the summer of 1938, hadn&#x27;t been pressured into taking the fight earlier than scheduled. Galento was reported to have impugned Louis&#x27;s integrity by asserting that he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Louis himself didn&#x27;t have something to do with arranging that premature fight.&quot; In the African American news and entertainment magazine &quot;Jet&quot;, it was reported that Louis&#x27;s second wife, the businesswoman and beautician Rose Morgan, had initiated legal proceedings against Galento, Mike Wallace, and the American Broadcasting Company. &quot;Jet&quot; didn&#x27;t indicate whether Louis himself was involved in the action. Writing in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, John Lardner assured &quot;Mrs. Louis&quot; that she needn&#x27;t be worried about the &quot;kind of history dispensed by Tony Galento&quot;. Young people, if they cared, need only look at the record book to see that, whatever Galento had to say, Joe Louis was no &#x27;bum&#x27;.

=== Later heavyweights ===

Commenting on the heavyweight scene of the 1970s, a decade that some fight fans remember as a &#x27;golden age&#x27;, Galento sounded a disapproving note. &quot;They&#x27;re all a bunch of bums&quot;, he unsurprisingly declared. George Foreman, he said, was a &quot;strong fella, but if he don&#x27;t hit&#x27;cha, he&#x27;s lost&quot;. Muhammad Ali, Galento believed, &quot;should have a clothes-pin on his mouth.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;da knocked the bum out in three&quot;, Galento later said of Ali. &quot;Rope-a-dope with me? If I hit him on the arms he&#x27;d have his arms in splints&quot;. In 1972, the sixty-two-year-old Galento offered advice to the heavyweight contender Ron Stander, the &#x27;Bluffs Butcher&#x27;, on how to beat Joe Frazier. &quot;When Joe sticks a thumb in your eye, stick two thumbs in his eye&quot;, Galento suggested. &quot;When Joe comes in with his head low, get your head lower and then suddenly bring your head to an upright position. Of course, with his head in the way, you knock out a few teeth. Step back politely and say, &#x27;I&#x27;m sorry&#x27;.&quot; Despite Galento&#x27;s instruction in the dark arts of rule bending and rule breaking, Frazier stopped Stander in the fifth round of their heavyweight title contest on May 25. A few years prior to Frazier&#x27;s victory over Stander, Galento stated that &#x27;Smokin&#x27; Joe&#x27;, of the &quot;current crop of heavyweights&quot;, was the &quot;best of &#x27;em&quot;. Incidentally, Frazier later recalled Stander as a &quot;beer-guzzling knockabout character—a kind of midwestern Tony Galento.&quot;

The Canadian heavyweight George Chuvalo, who twice went the distance against Muhammad Ali, details in his autobiography that Galento taught him &quot;how to follow a [head]butt with a short right hand, making it look like the punch caused the damage.&quot;

Galento reportedly offered to coach his fellow Jerseyan Chuck Wepner in the run-up to the latter&#x27;s 1975 fight against Ali.

=== Charitable causes ===
In his later years, Galento was a representative of the Max Baer Heart Fund, the Eagle Cancer Fund, and the Jimmy Durante Children&#x27;s Fund. All three funds were run by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a fraternal organization of which Galento was a member and a &quot;travelling ambassador&quot;. In honor of Galento, the Eagles started a Tony Galento Diabetes Fund.

=== Encounters ===
A wall in Galento&#x27;s home was reportedly decorated with blown-up photographs depicting his knockdown of Joe Louis. According to the &quot;New York Post&quot; gossip columnist and anecdotalist Leonard Lyons, the Manhattan restaurateur Toots Shor on seeing the wall inquired: &quot;Where&#x27;s the real picture—the one showing Joe Louis standing over you after the knockout?&quot; &quot;That picture&#x27;s on Joe Louis&#x27;[s] wall&quot;, a shrugging Galento supposedly replied. In his unofficial role as a go-between between celebrities, Lyons introduced Galento to the playwright Noël Coward.

Galento, when an &quot;old man&quot;, was once encountered by the palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould in a bar in upstate New York. For Gould, Galento was not a figure of fun, but of pity—the perfect picture of an also-ran: &quot;still cadging drinks in exchange for the true story of his moment of glory: when he knocked Joe Louis down before losing their fight for the heavyweight championship.&quot;

== Death ==
Following complications caused by diabetes, Galento died of a heart attack in July 1979. In the period immediately prior to his death, he underwent two significant surgeries. The week before he died, his right leg was amputated. Two years earlier, in 1977, his left leg was &quot;amputated at mid-calf at Beth Israel Hospital.&quot; Galento was buried from the Roman Catholic Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Orange, New Jersey—the church in which he was married in 1935. Galento&#x27;s funeral mass was attended by Jersey Joe Walcott and Tippy Larkin. Though he had become friends with Galento, Joe Louis, owing to his &quot;ailing&quot; state, was unable to attend his funeral. Louis did, however, attend a &quot;Galento testimonial&quot; in Newark in 1978.

Galento&#x27;s death was adverted to by the Democratic Party politician Joseph Minish in the United States House of Representatives.

<text>The Widelux is a fully mechanical swing-lens panoramic camera first developed in Japan in 1958, by Panon Camera Shoko. There are both 35mm and medium-format models. Instead of a shutter, the camera has a slit that exposes the film as the lens pivots on a horizontal arc. This pivot allows for some distortion effects not available with traditional cameras. The last Widelux model F8 ended production in 2000.

==Models==

===Widelux F series 35mm===
* Widelux FI (1959) with Vistar f/2.8 26mm 
* Widelux FV (1959) with Panon f/2.8 26mm
* Widelux FVI (~1964)
* Widelux F6 (~1970)
* Widelux F6B (~1970s)
* Widelux F7 (1979–1988)
* Widelux F8 (1988–2000) 

=== Medium format model 1500===
The medium format Widelux model 1500 make 50x122 mm frames on 120 film, and cover a 150-degree horizontal angle across the long side. It was described as newly introduced in 1988 and cost &quot;about US$4,500&quot; at the time.

=== Differences ===
The core difference between the F models is improvements in the gearing. The only other noteable difference is, up to the F6 model, the camera&#x27;s three shutter speeds were 1/5, 1/200 and 1/50, whilst from the F6B model onwards, the cameras used the more modern speeds of 1/15, 1/125 and 1/250.

There are important differences between the F and 1500 series cameras. The 35mm cameras have a set focus (5 ft to infinity), whereas the 1500 Widelux can focus from a bit less than 1m to infinity with seven markers. The 1500 Widelux also used different shutter speeds of 1/8, 1/60 and 1/250 of a second. The F series cover a 140 degree view, whereas the 1500 series covers a slightly wider area (150 degree view-diagonally-140 degr.horizontally). Finally, the 1500 Widelux, like most manual film cameras, has a shutter that must be cocked before the camera will fire. When setting focus below 5m on Widelux 1500 the resolution will be reduced due to optical limitations.

==Notable users==
Actor/photographer Jeff Bridges started photographing movie sets with the camera in 1984. In 2003, he published a book of his panoramic pictures called simply &quot;Pictures&quot;. Bridges was recognized for his Widelux photography by the International Center of Photography&#x27;s Infinity Award in 2013.

A few of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s Widelux photos appear in the book &quot;Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures&quot; by his wife Christiane.

NASA used the Widelux in the 1960s for its 140° coverage, most notably on the Gemini 5 mission.

== WideluxX revival ==
During a podcast interview with photography magazine Silvergrain Classics in 2020, actor Jeff Bridges first brought up the idea of reviving the Widelux back into production. This discussion eventually evolved into Silvergrain and Bridges forming a company with the sole purpose of bringing back the camera. To separate the new model they have rebranded it to &quot;WideluxX&quot;.

Little is known about the new model. Though Silvergrain originally intended to duplicate the old model, most of the new design had to be built from the ground up as the camera&#x27;s first manufacturer lost all the original designs in 2005 due to a fire at its headquarters. Silvergrain has just stated that is will be based on the F8 model, but with small &quot;upgrades&quot;. They also plan to use no plastic components and only manufacture in German facilities that use green electricity sources. Due to this, it is suspected the pricing will be similar to the Leica brand (whos factory is also located in Germany), at around $2000 - $6000 USD.

<text>Nathanael Pringsheim (30 November 1823 – 6 October 1894) was a German botanist.

==Biography==
Nathanael Pringsheim was born at Landsberg, Prussian Silesia, and studied at the universities of Breslau, Leipzig, and Berlin successively. He graduated in 1848 as doctor of philosophy with the thesis &quot;De forma et incremento stratorum crassiorum in plantarum cellula&quot;, and rapidly became a leader in the great botanical renaissance of the 19th century.

His contributions to scientific phycology were of striking interest. Pringsheim was among the first to demonstrate the occurrence of a sexual process in this class of plants, and he drew from his observations weighty conclusions as to the nature of sexuality.

Together with the French investigators Gustave Adolphe Thuret (1817–1875) and Jean-Baptiste Édouard Bornet (1828–1911), Pringsheim ranks as the founder of our scientific knowledge of the algae. Among his researches in this field may be mentioned those on &quot;Vaucheria&quot; (1855), the Oedogoniaceae (1855–1858), the Coleochaeteae (1860), &quot;Hydrodictyon&quot; (1861), and &quot;Pandorina&quot; (1869); the last-mentioned memoir bore the title &quot;Beobachtungen über die Paarung de Zoosporen&quot;. This was a discovery of fundamental importance; the conjugation of zoospores was regarded by Pringsheim, with good reason, as the primitive form of sexual reproduction.

A work on the course of morphological differentiation in the Sphacelariaceae (1873), a family of marine algae, is of great interest, inasmuch as it treats of evolutionary questions; the authors point of view is that of Carl Nägeli (1817–1891) rather than Darwin. Closely connected with Pringsheim&#x27;s algological work was his long-continued investigation of the Saprolegniaceae, a family of algoid fungi, some of which have become notorious as the causes of disease in fish.

Among his contributions to our knowledge of the higher plants, his exhaustive monograph on the curious genus of water-ferns, &quot;Salvinia&quot;, deserves special mention. His career as a morphologist culminated in 1876 with the publication of a memoir on the alternation of generations in thallophytes and mosses. From 1874 to the close of his life Pringsheim&#x27;s activity was chiefly directed to physiological questions: he published, in a long series of memoirs, a theory of the carbon-assimilation of green plants, the central point of which is the conception of the chlorophyll-pigment as a screen, with the main function of protecting the protoplasm from light-rays which would neutralize its assimilative activity by stimulating too active respiration. This view has not been accepted as offering an adequate explanation of the phenomena. Pringsheim founded in 1858, and edited until his death, the classical &quot;Jahrbücher für wissenschaftliche Botanik&quot;, which still bears his name. He was also founder, in 1882, and first president, of the German Botanical Society.

His work was for the most part carried on in his private laboratory in Berlin; he only held a teaching post of importance for four years, 1864–1868, when he was professor at Jena. In early life he was a keen politician on the Liberal side. He died in Berlin.

A fuller account of Pringsheim&#x27;s career will be found in &quot;Nature&quot;, (1895) vol. Ii., and in the &quot;Berichte der deutschen botanischen Gesellschaft&quot;, (1895) vol. xiii. The latter is by his friend and colleague, Ferdinand Cohn.

In 1866 botanist Stephan Schulzer von Müggenburg published &quot;Pringsheimia&quot; (a genus of fungi, in Saccotheciaceae family) and named in Pringsheim&#x27;s honour. Then in 1920 Franz Xaver Rudolf von Höhnel published in Ann. Mykol. vol.18 &quot;Pringsheimiella&quot;, which is a genus of green algae, in the family Ulvellaceae. In 1939, John Nathaniel Couch published &quot;Pringsheimiella&quot; (a genus of fungi).

The standard botanical author abbreviation Pringsh. is applied to species he described.

<text>Chori Chori Chupke Chupke () is a 2001 Indian Hindi-language romantic drama film directed by Abbas–Mustan, with screenplay and story from Javed Siddiqui and Neeraj Vora respectively. Starring Salman Khan, Rani Mukerji and Preity Zinta in lead roles, the film&#x27;s music is composed by Anu Malik and lyrics are penned by Sameer. Telling the story of a married couple hiring a young prostitute as a surrogate mother, the film generated controversy during its release for dealing with the taboo issue of surrogate childbirth in India.

Initially set to release on 22 December 2000, &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot;&#x27;s release was delayed for several months when producer Nazim Rizvi and financier Bharat Shah were arrested and the Central Bureau of Investigation seized the film&#x27;s prints on the suspicion that the production had been funded by Chhota Shakeel of the Mumbai underworld. The film was released in March 2001 to a wide audience and emerged as a commercial success, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2001 in India.

Critical praise was majorly directed towards Zinta&#x27;s performance as a prostitute-turned-surrogate mother, earning her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the 47th Filmfare Awards, the only nomination for the film. The film has often been associated with surrogacy in Indian popular culture. This film was remade as an Indian Drama Series named Dil Se Dil Tak In which Sidharth Shukla portrayed as Raj, Rashami Desai as Priya and Jasmin Bhasin as Madhubala. This film is remade from Tamil movie Avan Aval Adhu acted by Shivakumar, Sri Priya and Lakshmi

== Plot ==
Raj and Priya, who come from well-to-do Indian families, meet at a wedding and fall in love. Soon after they marry, Priya becomes pregnant. Early in the pregnancy, Priya miscarries and becomes permanently infertile. On Dr. Balraj Chopra&#x27;s advice, they decide to look for a surrogate mother to bear Raj&#x27;s child and hide Priya&#x27;s infertility from his conservative family. Since the process of artificial insemination could be revealed in the Indian media due to the family&#x27;s renown and position in society, the couple agree that pregnancy should be achieved by means of sexual relations between Raj and the surrogate mother. Raj meets Madhubala &quot;Madhu&quot;, a prostitute, who agrees to carry Raj&#x27;s baby in exchange for money. After some much-needed behavioral grooming and a makeover, Madhu meets Priya—who is unaware of Madhu&#x27;s background—and the three depart for Switzerland in order to carry out their plan secretly.

Soon Madhu is pregnant with Raj&#x27;s child, and he happily tells his family that Priya is expecting. Meanwhile, Raj&#x27;s business partner Ajay Sharma begins to sexually harass Madhu and she decides to leave Switzerland, mistakenly believing that Raj told his friend that she is a prostitute. Eventually, Priya finds out about Madhu&#x27;s past, but still believes that Madhu should carry their child and begs her to stay. When Madhu is at home by herself, Raj&#x27;s friend assaults her but Raj arrives in time to save her. Overwhelmed by Raj&#x27;s kindness, Madhu falls in love with him.

Raj&#x27;s family suddenly arrives in Switzerland. While Priya reaches for pregnancy-simulating pillows, the family meets the heavily pregnant Madhu who is introduced to them as a friend staying with them while her husband is travelling for business. Raj&#x27;s grandfather Kailashnath and father Ranjit arrange a Godbharaai, a religious baby shower ceremony. They ask Raj, Priya, and Madhu to return with them to India, where the ritual must be held as formally required by tradition.

The ceremony is very important so Priya sends Madhu as herself. An emotional Madhu becomes conflicted about giving up her child. Finding Madhu&#x27;s room empty and the money dumped on the bed, a frantic Priya pursues her to the train station and slaps Madhu when she confesses that she loves Raj. By the time Raj arrives, Madhu has gone into premature labour. The doctor announces that either Madhu or the child can be saved, and Priya asks him to save Madhu. However, both mother and baby survive. Madhu gives the baby to Priya, who quickly settles into a hospital bed with &quot;her&quot; baby. Dr. Balraj Chopra lies to Raj&#x27;s family that while Priya gave birth, Madhu&#x27;s child was stillborn.

When Madhu is ready to leave, she promises Raj that she will not go back to prostitution. When he takes her to the airport, he realizes that she loves him and kisses her forehead. Madhu leaves happily.

==Production==
Director duo Abbas–Mustan had almost completed &quot;Ajnabee&quot; by October 1999 when they declared &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; as their next project. The three leads, Salman Khan, Rani Mukerji, and Preity Zinta, previously starred together in the romantic comedy &quot;Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega&quot; (2000). Producer Nazim Rizvi clarified that the casting of the three actors happened before they signed for the latter film. Khan, Mukerji and Zinta were paid , , and for their roles, respectively (all sums unadjusted for inflation). Zinta was initially reluctant to play her role, as she was unsure she was suited to play a prostitute, but she eventually accepted it at the directors&#x27; persuasion. To prepare for it, she visited several bars and nightclubs in Mumbai&#x27;s red-light areas to study the lingo and mannerisms of sex-workers.

&quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; was made on a budget of . Principal photography started in early 2000 and lasted two months. Location filming, performed by Thomas A. Xavier, took place in both Mahabaleshwar and Switzerland. The film was edited by Hussain A. Burmawala, and Surendra Sodhi composed the background score.

Initially, Shah Rukh Khan was offered the lead role as Raj Malhotra, who had previously worked in the directors&#x27; two films &quot;Baazigar&quot;, and &quot;Baadshah (1999 film)&quot;. However, he declined due to lack of dates, and then Salman Khan was approached and has accepted the offer.

==Themes and influence==
The film generated some controversy before and during its release for being one of the only Hindi-language films dealing with the taboo issue of surrogate childbirth in India, in addition to prostitution in India. Surrogacy in the film is not achieved through artificial insemination but sexual intercourse, and author Aditya Bharadwaj argued that the film draws an analogy between surrogacy and prostitution. Anindita Majumdar, author of the book &quot;Surrogacy&quot; (2018), wrote, &quot;In popular Indian culture, surrogacy has come to be associated with the 2001 Hindi language film &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot;&quot;. According to author Daniel Grey, that Madhubala was a prostitute before becoming a surrogate &quot;reinforces a stereotyped and erroneous popular association between the two roles that has contributed to considerable prejudice on the Subcontinent against women who act as surrogates&quot;.

According to &quot;The Hindu&quot;, some of film&#x27;s scenes were said to have been borrowed from &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990) and the storyline inspired by &quot;Doosri Dulhan&quot; (1983). According to Krämer, the similarities between &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; and &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; are limited to replicated scenes in &quot;merely one plot strand among many&quot;, in an otherwise different story. In another book by Majumdar, &quot;Transnational Commercial Surrogacy and the (Un)Making of Kin in India&quot; (2017), she discusses the similarity between &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; and &quot;Doosri Dulhan&quot;. Majumdar describes the surrogate mothers as &quot;fallen women&quot; who are first portrayed as aberrant women with no interest in motherhood, who gradually develop a sense of maternal instinct during the process of pregnancy.

Anupama Chopra of &quot;India Today&quot; described Zinta&#x27;s character of Madhubala as hooker with a heart of gold, as did academic Lucia Krämer. Sociologist Steve Derné wrote in his book &quot;Globalization on the Ground: New Media and the Transformation of Culture, Class, and Gender in India&quot; that through the character of Madhubala, &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; becomes one of the films which portray &quot;excessively sexual, greedy women who are redeemed by being remade as consumers&quot;. Derné further credited the film with melding the stereotypical &quot;heroine&quot; and &quot;vamp&quot; roles of Hindi heroines in contrast to how they were portrayed in previous decades, describing Zinta as a &quot;legitimate heroine&quot; in the film. S. Banaji spoke of a &quot;transformation in the &#x27;moral&#x27; consciousness of the prostitute&quot;. Bhawana Somaaya, while critical of the film&#x27;s &quot;regular packaging of commercial clichés&quot;, commended it for the unique portrayal of the wife, played by Mukerji, who is the sole decision-maker in the family throughout the entire process of surrogacy.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack for &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; was composed by Anu Malik and the lyrics were written by Sameer. It was released in 2000 by Universal Music India. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around two million units sold, the soundtrack became the sixth highest-selling music album of the year.

==Release==

The film&#x27;s initial release date of 22 December 2000 was delayed when producer Nazim Rizvi was arrested in December and film financier Bharat Shah was arrested in January; both were charged with receiving funding from Chhota Shakeel of the Mumbai underworld and pressuring leading Bollywood actors—specifically, Khan—to appear in the film and for the profits to be shared with Shakeel. Rizvi had reportedly been under telephone surveillance by the Mumbai Police for a number of months. The Central Bureau of Investigation seized the film&#x27;s prints and delivered them to the court receiver. The negatives were released on 12 February 2001 on a judicial order. In its ruling, the court ordered all profits from the film to go to the Maharashtra state government. Rivzi and Shah were still incarcerated when &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; opened to the public on 9 March 2001. The film was released with an opening credit thanking the Special Court, MCOCA, the Crime Branch, the Mumbai Police, and the court receiver, &quot;without whose untiring efforts and good office this picture would never have been made&quot;.

The film&#x27;s release took place amid protests due to its alleged funding by the underworld. Due to the controversy surrounding its delayed release—and the recurrent publicity around it—the film was expected to be a big success, with 325 prints sold before release. The director duo held a special screening of the film two days prior to its release for the senior brass of the Mumbai Police, to fulfill a promise made earlier in order to prove that no objectionable content appeared in the film, as could have been projected.

Certified U (suitable for all age groups) by the Central Board of Film Certification, &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; opened to a wide audience and emerged a commercial success and one of the highest-grossing films of 2001. Still, despite a strong opening, the film gradually lost public interest; it eventually grossed against its budget, with additional $1.4 million earned overseas, leaving its worldwide gross in 2001 at . &quot;Box Office India&quot; concluded the film&#x27;s final commercial performance with the verdict &quot;semi hit&quot;.

== Reception ==

Critics praised the uniqueness of the film for dealing with the rarely-touched subject of surrogacy, but disliked the execution. Preity Zinta&#x27;s performance, in what was seen as an unconventional role, was especially noted by a number of critics, with high praise for her portrayal of the gradual change her character goes through over the course of the story. Film critic Sukanya Verma, who was left with &quot;mixed emotions&quot; after seeing the film, noted Zinta&#x27;s role as &quot;the meatiest part of all&quot;, finding her transformation throughout the film &quot;amazingly believable&quot;. Padmaraj Nair of &quot;Screen&quot; called Zinta the film&#x27;s &quot;real scene-stealer&quot; for having delivered &quot;a stunning performance&quot;. Vinayak Chakravorty of &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; hailed Zinta&#x27;s &quot;admirable zest&quot; as the &quot;trumpcard of the film&quot;. Dinesh Raheja of &quot;India Today&quot; credited Zinta with giving the film &quot;its electric charge&quot;. Likewise, Nikhat Kazmi of &quot;The Times of India&quot; noted Zinta for keeping &quot;the adrenalin gushing&quot; and wrote of &quot;riveting moments&quot; where she &quot;shows flashes of a fine performance&quot;. Ziya Us Salam of &quot;The Hindu&quot;, though similarly fond of Zinta for putting &quot;life into her character of Madhubala&quot;, found the actress less convincing in &quot;mouthing the inanities used by the women of the street&quot;. M. Shamim, writing for the same publication, believed Zinta had &quot;put her body and soul into the streetwalker&#x27;s flaming-red dress&quot;.

The duo of Salman Khan and Rani Mukerji faced some criticism from Sukanya Verma, who lamented their underdeveloped roles. She considered Mukerji to be &quot;handicapped with a role that doesn&#x27;t give her much scope besides weeping and sobbing&quot; and stated that Khan&#x27;s performance lacked substance. Raheja described Khan as &quot;overtly subdued&quot; as opposed to his recent comic roles, but wrote of Mukerji, &quot;The emotions that drive Rani Mukherji&#x27;s character are not given either a layered detailing or an adequate exposition so she comes across as pale as the pastel-coloured dresses she favours&quot;. Chakravorty similarly noted Khan for playing against type. Kazmi similarly disliked their characters in contrast to Zinta&#x27;s: &quot;From a street-walker to sensitive young girl and then a jealous lover - stray vignettes of flesh and blood form from Preity which come as a respite in a terrain dominated by an ever-say-cheese and forever understanding Rani and an unruffled, mumbling Salman who plays the perfect gentleman with the zeal of a zombie.&quot; Padmaraj Nair, however, praised the actors in addition to Zinta, noting Khan for his &quot;understated&quot; performance, and arguing that Mukerji is &quot;at her best&quot;.

&quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; was reviewed positively by a number of critics. Taran Adarsh from the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama was positive of the film, concluding it &quot;lives up to the towering expectations thanks to the solid drama&quot;. Several reviewers appreciated the film for its portrayal of the big family and its overall positive atmosphere, including Kazmi, who found it to be a &quot;modern ode to the ancient Indian family&quot; and admired its &quot;overwhelming feel-goodness&quot;. Likewise, Us Salam noted the film&#x27;s &quot;loads of good music, beautiful locales, sweet smiles and lovely feel&quot;, and Shamim shared similar sentiments, appreciating the directors for not allowing &quot;any moral issue to cloud the narrative&quot; and filling &quot;the screen with mesmerising charm and beauty of the lifestyle of a well-knit family&quot;.

Less positive views were expressed in relation to the film&#x27;s stereotypical approach and poor execution of the story. Verma found the presentation of the story to be &quot;absurd&quot;. Nair was ambivalent towards the film in this regard: &quot;On the one hand, the film stands by family values and desi culture while, on the other, it goes in for cheap gimmicks like hiring a cabaret dancer as a solution for bearing a child just to lure the front benchers and the masses&quot;. Still, he ultimately noted an &quot;engrossing&quot; second half and commended the directors for having &quot;done their best to bring a fair amount of conviction while putting it across on the screen&quot;.

Vinayak Chakravorty, who gave the film a three-star rating, noted its resemblance to &quot;Doosri Dulhan&quot; and criticised it for occasionally coming across as &quot;a veritable rerun of the stereotypes&quot;. Raheja was critical of the film&#x27;s lack of subtlety but believed the directors are &quot;masters of pace and don&#x27;t allow your attention to wander&quot;. Suman Tarafdar of &quot;Filmfare&quot; was particularly critical of the film, calling it &quot;saccarine&quot; and &quot;a film for anyone gullible enough to believe in fairy lands&quot;, and noting that Zinta gave &quot;the only slightly noteworthy performance&quot;.

==Accolades==
Khan was named the Most Sensational Actor at the Bollywood Movie Awards. At the 47th Filmfare Awards, Zinta was nominated in the Best Supporting Actress category, the only nomination for the film.

==Legacy==
&quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; has often been associated with surrogacy in Indian popular culture. It has been screened at a number of events since its release. In 2002, it was one of 30 films screened at a three-month-long Bollywood event organised by the Swiss Government in Zürich. It was later screened at the 2005 Independent South Asian Film Festival and the 2012 Fiji Film Festival.

Zinta&#x27;s role has been noted as one of her notable works. In a column about Zinta, published in an August 2001 issue of &quot;Screen&quot; magazine, Roshmila Bhattacharya asserted, &quot;If &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; found a following in conventional circles, it&#x27;s thanks to Preity’s handling of yet another &#x27;brave&#x27; role&quot;. In a 2003 column for Sify about the portrayal of sex-workers in Hindi films, Subhash K. Jha wrote of Zinta that in spite of being &quot;uncomfortable about using all the foul language ... Once she entered the zone of the rented womb Preity had a ball. This remains her best performance yet&quot;. Published in the same year, a column analysing Zinta&#x27;s career by &quot;Stardust&quot; found her to be &quot;manifested [her]self most prominently ... in [the film]&quot;, adding, &quot;Here was Preity essaying a character with tremendous scope for performance, but the scenes in which she excelled was when she did her bubbly act in the initial stages of the film&quot;.

The concept of playing a match under handicap against the number of shots a hypothetical golfer playing perfect golf at every hole was conceived by Hugh Rotherham, a member at Coventry Golf Club. Rotherham called this a &quot;Ground Score.&quot; This idea was suggested to Dr. Thomas Browne, honorary secretary of the Great Yarmouth Club, and it was introduced on a match play basis at the club. During one such competition, one golfer was playing incredibly well and was hailed a Bogey Man to Dr Browne. The phrase &#x27;a bogey&#x27; was invented and the ground score became known as a &#x27;bogey. henceforth.&#x27; At the time, &quot;Hush, here comes the Bogey man&quot; was a popular music hall song of the day.

<text>The Bureya () is a south-flowing, left tributary of the Amur river in Russia. It is long, and has a drainage basin of . Its name comes from the Evenk word &quot;birija&quot;, meaning river.

==Course==
The Bureya is formed from the junction of the Pravaya (right) Bureya and the Levaya (left) Bureya.

==Geography==
Its basin is bounded in the west by the Turan Range and the river Zeya, to the south by the Amur, to the east by the Bureya Range, the rivers Urmi and Amgun, and to the north by the Ezop Range and several rivers that flow northeastwards into the Sea of Okhotsk.

There are no cities on the river, the largest settlements on the river are Novy Urgal on the Baikal Amur Mainline and, Novobureysky and Bureya, both on the Trans-Siberian Railway. The Tyrma is a left tributary that crosses the railway south from Novy Urgal at the town of Tyrma. The Chegdomyn coal fields are north of Novy Urgal. The Bureya hydro power plant holds back middle stream of the river and mitigates extremal surge events during summer rainy seasons. The counter-regulating Nizhne-Bureiskaya HPP was built in 2017 and is located downstream of the Bureiskaya HPP. M58 highway (Russia) crosses it on a bridge.

==Landslide in December 2018==
The river was blocked by a landslide in December 2018 on a width of about 600 to 800 meters and a height of 80 to 160 meters. Initial reports have speculated that the landslide was caused by a meteor impact. Meanwhile, however, an earthquake is considered as the most likely cause for the landslide. The blockade of the river might be removed by explosions or air raids of the Russian army. This, however, involves the risk of a torrent.
