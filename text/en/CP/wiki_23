<text>Evans Chan (陳耀成) is a Hong Kong Second Wave film director. His work usually focuses on exploring identities of Hong Kong people, such as &quot;To Liv(e)&quot; (1992), &quot;Crossings&quot; (1994), and &quot;The Map of Sex and Love&quot; (2001).

&quot;To Liv(e)&quot; is the most famous films among his works. In it the protagonist writes letter to famous Norwegian Liv Ullmann to express discontent about her criticisms of the Hong Kong Government&#x27;s policies dealing with Vietnamese boat people. The film is a metaphor concerning the identity crisis of Hong Kong people in facing the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre and 1997 handover.

&quot;To Liv(e)&quot; is widely acclaimed by academic scholars and film critics. The film received Best Actress (Lindzay Chan) and Best Supporting Actress (Josephine Koo) in Golden Horse Film Festival 1992.

<text>Sydney Bertram Carter (6 May 1915 – 13 March 2004) was an English poet, songwriter, and folk musician who was born in Camden Town, London. He is best known for the song &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; (1963), whose music is based on the Shaker song &quot;Simple Gifts&quot;, and for the song &quot;The Crow on the Cradle&quot;, which was recorded by Jackson Browne and used on the soundtrack to the film &quot;In the King of Prussia&quot; (1983) and &quot;No Nukes&quot; (1980). His other notable songs include &quot;Julian of Norwich&quot; (sometimes called &quot;The Bells of Norwich&quot;), based on words of Julian of Norwich, &quot;One More Step Along the World I Go&quot;, &quot;When I Needed a Neighbour&quot;, &quot;Friday Morning&quot;, &quot;Every Star Shall Sing a Carol&quot;, &quot;The Youth of the Heart&quot;, &quot;Down Below&quot; and &quot;Sing John Ball&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Camden Town, Carter was educated at Montem Street Primary School in Finsbury Park, before winning a scholarship to Christ&#x27;s Hospital school in Horsham, West Sussex. He read Modern History at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1936.

He taught at Frensham Heights School in Surrey. A committed pacifist, he registered as a conscientious objector in the Second World War and joined the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit. He served in Egypt, Palestine and Greece alongside Donald Swann, who became a friend and collaborator.

In 1964 he married his second wife Leela Nair, with whom he had a son, the neurosurgeon Michael Carter.

==Career==

Carter worked as a lyricist for Donald Swann&#x27;s revues and musicals in the 1950s and in 1962 produced an album, &quot;Putting out the Dustbin&quot;, with Sheila Hancock. &quot;Last Cigarette&quot;, a song from the album about failing to give up smoking became a minor hit. In 1968, rock band Reflection released &quot;The Present Tense (Songs of Sydney Carter)&quot;, incorporating his poetry and songs.

In 1972, a collection of his poems, &quot;Love More or Less&quot;, was described in a review by Michael Grosvenor Myer in the EFDSS magazine &quot;English Dance and Song&quot; as the work of &quot;an impressive spokesman for the believer in an age of general unbelief&quot;.

He continued to work with Donald Swann, writing six songs for the 1964 Swann EP, &quot;Songs of Faith and Doubt&quot;. In the 1960s he also worked as a critic for &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine. In 1965 Carter wrote the six-song EP album &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; with Martin Carthy on guitar, the Johnny Scott Trio and the Mike Sammes singers. He also worked with Nadia Cattouse and Jeremy Taylor.

In 1972 Carter presented a series of concerts in Australia. Franciscus Henri who accompanied him recorded an anthology of Carter&#x27;s songs and poems (&quot;Nothing Fixed or Final&quot;) in 2005. Also in 1972, Bob and Carole Pegg recorded a collection of his songs with him, &quot;And Now It Is So Early.&quot;

In 1981, an all-star collection of English folk musicians released &quot;Lovely in the Dances&quot;, a compilation of his songs. Performers included Shusha, Maddy Prior, and John Kirkpatrick.

<doc id="1323387" wikidata="Q11673882" url="?curid=1323387" title="Maximo vs. Army of Zin">
<text>is an action-adventure game developed and published by Capcom and developed by their US-based Production Studio 8 in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 video game console. It is a sequel to &quot;&quot; and part of the &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; franchise. It was re-released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 in Europe on February 15, 2012.

==Plot==
The story of the game follows on from &quot;Maximo: Ghosts to Glory&quot;, with Maximo still searching for his lost love, Sophia. He is again accompanied by Grim (a Grim Reaper). However, their search is interrupted as a series of mechanical creatures start to attack villages and slaughter the village folk. These creatures are the Army of Zin, an ancient army powered by lost souls, who were supposedly locked in the vault of Castle Hawkmoor after the last battle with them 500 years ago. However, they are now free, due to the actions of the mysterious warlord, Lord Bane.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Maximo&quot;&#x27;s gameplay is characterized by hack and slash combat and platforming, as well as an armour system where damage is reflected by loss of armour. Maximo begins the game with two levels of armour (full armour sans helmet), and can upgrade to three and four (with helmet and golden armour, respectively). Level one has Maximo reduced to boxer shorts.

Another element of gameplay is the Grim transformation, allowing the player to turn into a Grim Reaper for short periods of time, with the souls gathered from the Army of Zin. Grim is invulnerable, powerful, and a touch faster than Maximo. However, the time spent in this form is limited but can be extended through upgrades.

Maximo also receives bonuses from villagers that he saves from enemies in the game, and these rewards are anything from new armour to a word of advice.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Maximo&quot; the best PlayStation 2 game of January 2004. 

&quot;The Times&quot; gave it a score of four stars out of five, saying that it &quot;has pace, style and replayability; and if it is not quite as inventive as &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot;, what is?&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; similarly gave it a score of eight out of ten, saying, &quot;It always helps to have a sense of humor when collapsing paradoxes, and this &quot;Maximo&quot; does not miss.&quot; Likewise, &quot;Maxim&quot; gave it eight out of ten, saying, &quot;It ain&#x27;t groundbreaking, but who cares? Drop trou and have some fun!&quot;

<doc id="1323388" wikidata="Q1974818" url="?curid=1323388" title="Tewa">
<text>The Tewa are a linguistic group of Pueblo Native Americans who speak the Tewa language and share the Pueblo culture. Their homelands are on or near the Rio Grande in New Mexico north of Santa Fe. They comprise the following communities:
* Nambé Pueblo
* Pojoaque Pueblo
* San Ildefonso Pueblo
* Ohkay Owingeh 
* Santa Clara Pueblo
* Tesuque Pueblo

The Hopi Tewa, descendants of those who fled the Second Pueblo Revolt of 1680–1692, live on the Hopi Reservation in Arizona, mostly in Tewa Village and Polacca on the First Mesa. Other Hopi clans are known to be descendants of Tewa people.

Tewa is one of five Tanoan languages spoken by the Pueblo people of New Mexico. Though these five languages are closely related, speakers of one cannot fully understand speakers of another (similar to German and Dutch speakers). The six Tewa-speaking pueblos are Nambe, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso, Ohkay Owingeh, Santa Clara, and Tesuque.

== Demographics (Population) ==
In 1630, Fray Alonso de Benavides reported eight Tewa pueblos with a total population as high as six thousand. But, in other reports, about 2,200 Tewa were living in the six New Mexico pueblos, which might not include the other two pueblos mentioned by Fray Alonso.

In 1988, the U.S. took a demographic census concerning Native American populations in New Mexico, and the number of Native Americans on New Mexico&#x27;s Tewa reservations was 4,546. In sections of pueblos:

* San Juan Pueblo - 1,936
* Santa Clara Pueblo - 1,253
* San Ildefonso Pueblo - 556
* Nambé Pueblo - 396
* Tesuque Pueblo - 329
* Pojoaque Pueblo - 76

Compared to the 1975 population of 625 Hopi-Tewa at Hano, Native American development over time had increased. In retrospect, most Tewa lives on or near their home pueblo, but they slowly moved towards more urban communities.

In a 1991 census, a new record of the population of Tewa and even the number of speakers of the Tewa language was documented. In terms of the Pueblo population:

* Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo - 1,438
* Santa Clara Pueblo - 1,057
* Nambé Pueblo - 558
* San Ildefonso Pueblo - 539
* Tesuque Pueblo - 511
* Pojoaque Pueblo - 209

The demographic of how many people speak the Tewa language raises shocking results.

* Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo - 495
* Santa Clara Pueblo - 207
* Nambé Pueblo - 50
* San Ildefonso Pueblo - 349
* Tesuque Pueblo - 172
* Pojoaque Pueblo - 25

Today, hundreds of these Pueblo ruins in New Mexico have been identified and marked as ancestral sites for the complementary Rio Grande Pueblos; in historical times, at least sixty of them were abandoned. Since most of these sites weren’t investigated, they can&#x27;t be directly traced to early Tewa origins. But through DNA analysis, scientists were recently able to trace the early DNA of domesticated turkeys that lived inside the Tewa settlements. They discovered that DNA samples taken from the Tewa&#x27;s site in Colorado&#x27;s Mesa Verde are similar to those from the Northern Rio Grande region, where the tribe is settled today. The Mesa Verde region was a hub for Southwestern Puebloan society in the 13th century, but following a severe drought in 1277, the tribe&#x27;s economy and social relations crashed. This devastating event corroborates why the Tewa had early traces in the Mesa Verde region but was discovered by the Spanish in the northern Rio Grande region.

== Demographics (Population Density) ==
Between the arrival of the Spanish and the early 1900s, population densities within the pueblos fluctuated but also included times of decline. This could be because of diseases introduced by the Spanish, warfare, or even the abandonment of villages because of the Tewa&#x27;s desire to escape European expansion and oppression.

But, population density for the Tewa Pueblos began to slowly rise in the 1900s following the establishment of the Pueblo Lands Board. Between 1950 and 1964, the population in all six main Tewa pueblos almost doubled. Maternal and infant mortality rates were reduced through better health care inside the communities and improved nutrition (due to increased job opportunities), also contributing to lower mortality rates.

== History of the Tribes and Pueblos ==
In 1598, a Spanish conquistador named Juan de Oñate established the Spanish capital of New Mexico at Yungue, a Tewa village located across the river from San Juan Pueblo. Later, the capital was moved to San Juan Pueblo, another Tewa Pueblo native to the region. From then on, Oñate and his other men subjected the Tewa and other native peoples to harsh conditions and rule. They forced the religion of Catholicism onto them, which was the predominant religion in Spain during these early years of colonization.

In the early years of Spanish colonization, the Spanish established missions in all the pueblos. Subsequently, the capital was moved again in 1609, from San Juan Pueblo to Santa Fe, which has remained the capital of New Mexico since then. The previous colonizer, Juan de Oñate, stepped down and was replaced by Pedro de Peralta.

By 1680, the Pueblo people had a plan to remove colonial oppression. This plan succeeded when they forced the Spanish south of the Rio Grande in the 1680 Pueblo Revolt. In 1692, Diego de Vargas resumed the conquest of the Pueblos, which secured Santa Fe as the Spanish capital again in 1694. But in 1696, a second pueblo revolt happened, but instead of the Indians reestablishing freedom again, Spanish officials and the military were able to put it down. Later on, Apache and Navajo raids for food and captives, which were steadily increasing during this period, escalated, which led the Pueblos to take advantage of the Spanish military in terms of protection.

When Mexico gained Independence from Spain in 1821, Christianized Indians were given citizenship. In 1858, when the United States gained New Mexico and other Southwestern regions, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (which gave the U.S. the previously mentioned territories) promised citizenship to all Mexican citizens who wanted it, including the Pueblos and the Tewa.

In 1912, the Pueblo of San Juan was determined to sue the U.S. government to secure the status of American Indians, which would subsequently secure the native land and water rights and protect their religious and individual rights. Later, Hispanic and Anglo-Americans moved into these Pueblo lands where Tewa Pueblos lost many agricultural areas due to urban expansion to account for the new population size. In 1920, the United States established the Pueblo Lands Board to settle disputed claims between the government and the Tewa. Eventually, the Tewa gained full citizenship status while retaining their previous rights to land, water, and religious expression, secured only through litigation in federal courts.

== Economy ==

=== Commercial Economy ===
The Tewa were primarily cultivators, using irrigation to sustain and grow maize, beans, and squash. While they could be considered nomadic, as they followed herds of deer, bison, and elk to hunt while gathering berries and nuts, they were mostly not nomadic and preferred to settle in an area and farm. They were also proficient at crushing plants and other natural flora to make herbal teas and sometimes even &quot;potions,&quot; as their tribe believed in the shaman or works of witchcraft.

Through the early colonization of Spain in their settlements, they were introduced to a variety of new animals, including cows, pigs, and chickens, while also being introduced to new crops like wheat, tomatoes, apples, pears, peaches, and spices like chili. While they knew how to use fire to create pottery, the innovation of iron kettles and pots was readily accepted as a means of cooking, but the tribe stuck with pottery as means of storage and dishes.

Before Spanish colonization, like most other indigenous people in the U.S., they mostly sold pottery, which accounted for most of their income but also included jewelry and woven goods as alternative ways to make money. But following the development of the Pueblo Lands Board, most of these people depend on wage labor, Social Security, or other pensions for their income.

=== Arts ===
The primary forms of art in the tribe were shown through pottery, weaving, and wood carving, but the most influential was pottery, as the tribe used it for storage, eating, cooking, and trading. Also, cotton and hides from the animals hunted by the tribe (which included deer, rabbits, and others) were made into clothing and shoes for the tribe. After a decline in the development of pottery in the economy, the rise of the commercial revolution, especially during the 18th and 19th centuries, revived this craft, and even today, needlework, pottery, jewelry, and woven garments make up the tribe&#x27;s modern-day economy.

=== Trade ===
Surrounding the Mesa Verde and Rio Grande region, the Tewa had developed an extensive trade network. Areas as far as California, central Mexico, the Mississippi Valley, the eastern Great Planes, and the Great Basin to the north made up this trade network and were observed to have remnants of Pueblo ruins. This trade network continued through the twentieth century, including Basketry from the Apache and Papago and feathers, shells, and beads from Mexico. Through markets like the Santa Fe Indian Market and shows like the Northern Indian Pueblos Arts and Crafts Show, trade continued to increase.

== Gender roles ==
Like the European notion or the cult of domesticity, women were in charge of the household and held responsible for building and maintaining them until the mid-1970s. They also gathered different types of flora, processing and producing a variety of meals. Following this idea of the cult of domesticity, men were in charge of the farm. They were expected to plant, tend, and harvest crops grown on the farm while hunting in the surrounding forests and meadows.

== Land ==
Pueblo and Tribe members are assigned a piece of land, but the land technically belongs to the tribe. Once one person might pass away, like an elder, the children can be given the land as an “inheritance.” While land trade is allowed or permitted inside the tribe, tribal members aren’t allowed to trade land with non-tribal members.

== Customs ==

=== Marriage ===
Marriage inside the tribe was primarily arranged through negotiation between the families and was usually accompanied by the exchange of gifts. The marriage ceremony included a variety of expectations. Usually, it included a native (but might have also included) a nonnative ritual. Inside the community, marriage is monogamous and sexual fidelity is an expectation between the two, although divorce and infidelity have been observed. After marriage, the families would usher the couple to stay in the husband’s mother’s home, where, after the first year, the couple would establish a permanent home inside the community.

=== Childhood ===
From a very young age, the Tewa tribe would create or introduce individuals to progress through stages, the last regarding becoming a “Tewa.” From birth, children are tribal members and are raised rather tolerantly. When the children are ten, the boys and girls are split into two groups to learn about their roles in the community. If the children’s families are primarily Catholic, the children will also attend their First Communion.

==== Modern Day ====
Instead of splitting into these two groups and learning in kivas, tribal leaders encourage youths to strive for higher education. This idea is promoted through educational grants and subsidies to private or public colleges via the Eight Northern Indian Pueblos Council. Parents are still held accountable for their children, and all reside in their respective communities.

=== Religion ===
In the Pueblo community, religion is a crucial aspect of their lives. It is a way by which the people aspire to live and encompasses mythology, cosmology, philosophy, and a worldview for the Tewa. Religious sodality leaders know more details of their respective systems of belief, and, to the general population, this is a sensitive aspect of Tewa life. Some sodality environments or of worship could include:

* Respect and Revenance to the Earth (where everyone is born)
* The Mountains (where spirits of the &quot;Towa’e&quot; are found)
* The Hills
* The Water
* Certain Animals, Birds, and Plants

In contrast to many other tribes, the Tewa possesses a polytheist belief regarding supernatural spiritual force and entities. Because of this distinction, Catholicism has been seamlessly applied to the tribe.

==== Deities ====

* &#x27;Agojo so&#x27;jo (Tewa: &#x27;Big star&#x27;), a god that represents the Morning star, associated with warfare.
* Ponu&#x27;chona, a deity of Hopi-Tewa, identified with the morning star, associated with animals and hunting.

==Language==

=== Origins ===
As with speakers of Tiwa, Towa and Keres, there is some disagreement among the Tewa people as to whether Tewa should be a written language or not. Some Pueblo elders feel that Tewa languages should be preserved by oral traditions alone. However, many Tewa speakers have decided that Tewa literacy is important for passing the language on to the children.

The Tewa pueblos developed their own orthography (spelling system) for their language, Ohkay Owingeh has published a dictionary of Tewa, and today most of the Tewa-speaking pueblos have established Tewa-language programs to teach children to read and write in this language.

=== Modern-Day Conservation Efforts ===
With a decline in the Tewa population, many questions were raised regarding the Tewa language. People, including the Tewa, were worried about the practicality and learning of the Tewa language. Students and professors at Worcester Polytechnic Institute recognized this issue and designed TewaTalk. TewaTalk would allow many people to learn the language.

Virgie Bigbee, one of the many “voices” of TewaTalk, spent countless hours recording and uploading his talking in the Tewa Language. In addition to simple learning, to entice or appeal to the younger generation, the app also features learning games where one can apply their knowledge.

<text>The Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, or simply SIECUS, is a national, nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., dedicated to advancing sex education through advocacy, policy, and coalition building. SIECUS develops, collects, and disseminates information, promotes comprehensive education about sexuality, and advocates the right of individuals to make responsible sexual choices. It is widely regarded as the institutional voice of these concerns and a pioneer of the comprehensive sex education program.

==History==

The organization was founded in 1964 by Dr. Mary Calderone, then medical director at Planned Parenthood. With the conviction that sex education was sorely lacking in American society and simply &quot;handing out contraceptives was not enough,&quot; Dr. Calderone quit her position at Planned Parenthood and established the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States (later renamed as &quot;Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States&quot;), the first and only single-issue, national advocacy group dedicated to promoting sex education. Driven by Dr. Calderone&#x27;s dynamic talks across the nation and its mission statement, &quot;to establish man&#x27;s sexuality as a health entity,&quot; the organization became an essential umbrella group for school administrators, sex educators, physicians, social activists, and parents seeking to access information about teaching sexuality education.

During her tenure at SIECUS, Dr. Calderone lectured extensively across the United States, addressing high school and college students, parents, educators, religious leaders, and professional groups on sex education. Known as the &quot;mother of sex education&quot; as well as the &quot;grande dame of sex education&quot;, Dr. Calderone was an instrumental figure in the advancement of sex education in the United States, and credited with transforming sex education from &quot;a series of vague moral lessons focused on disease and reproduction&quot; to a scientifically informed, comprehensive framework.

Her popularity eventually made her a target for right-wing politicians, and conservative religious groups like the Christian Crusade, the John Birch Society, and the Moral Majority, who spent an estimated $40 million on a vicious smear campaign to discredit her. In 1968, Billy James Hargis and Gordon V. Drake targeted SIECUS, and in particular, Dr. Calderone, in the famous &quot;Is the School House the Proper Place to Teach Raw Sex?&quot; pamphlet, as well as other similar publications, claiming that the organization sought to undermine Christian morality, promote promiscuity, and corrupt children. The pamphlet also argued that sex education is part of a &quot;giant Communist conspiracy.&quot; After years of vitriolic attacks and death threats from extremist groups, Dr. Calderone retired from SIECUS in 1982, at the age of 78.

==Recent work==
===Comprehensive sex education===
As an early advocate of scientifically-informed sex education, SIECUS is a pioneer in comprehensive sex education. According to the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), the guidelines for comprehensive sex education are as follows:

* appropriate to the age, developmental level, and cultural background of students;
* respects the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community;
* complements and augments the sexuality education children receive from their families, religious and community groups, and healthcare professionals;
* teaches not only about abstinence, but also contraception, including emergency contraception and reproductive choice;
* teaches about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) issues and questions issues;
* teaches anatomy, development, puberty, and relationships;
* teaches all of the other issues one would expect to be covered in a traditional sexuality education class; and
* should be science-based and medically accurate

===&quot;SIECUS State Profiles&quot;===
SIECUS also disseminates the &quot;SIECUS State Profiles&quot;, which provide an in-depth and up-to-date look at the state of sex education in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the other U.S. territories. Each profile includes an overview of each state’s current sex education laws, policies, and guidelines, newly introduced legislation, and relevant action that advocates have taken to advance or defend sex education in their communities.

===The Future of Sex Education===
In collaboration with two other organizations, Advocates for Youth and &quot;Answer&quot;, a national organization based at Rutgers University, SIECUS funds and manages the Future of Sex Education (FoSE) project, which seeks to create a national dialogue about the future of sex education and to promote the institutionalization of comprehensive sexuality education in public schools. The FoSE&#x27;s National Sexuality Education Standards and National Teacher Preparation Standards influence policy-makers and educators alike.

===Other===
SIECUS is currently a member of the National Coalition Against Censorship.

<doc id="1323399" wikidata="Q722750" url="?curid=1323399" title="Justin Rose">
<text>Justin Peter Rose, (born 30 July 1980) is an English professional golfer. Rose first achieved significant media attention when he finished fourth place at the 1998 Open Championship as an amateur. He turned pro the next day but struggled during his first few years as a professional, making few cuts. In the early 2000s, however, he had success, winning his first European Tour title in 2002 and ultimately leading the tour&#x27;s Order of Merit in 2007. In the ensuing years, Rose focused primarily on the United States, winning a number of notable tournaments, culminating with a victory at the 2013 U.S. Open. Rose has continued with success since then, earning a gold medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics, finishing runner-up at the 2017 Masters, and reaching number one in the world for the first time in 2018.

==Early life==
Rose was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to English parents, Annie, and Ken (who died of cancer in 2003). The family moved to England when Rose was five, and he started to play golf at Tylney Park Golf Club. He then moved on to Southwood Golf Club, Hartley Wintney Golf Club, and finally North Hants Golf Club. All of these clubs were near his then home in Hook, Hampshire.

Rose broke 70 for the first time at the age of 11 and was a plus three handicap by 14.

== Amateur career ==
Rose played in the Walker Cup in 1997 as a 17-year-old. Later in the year, Rose burst to worldwide prominence at the 1998 Open Championship held at Royal Birkdale Golf Club. He holed a dramatic shot from the rough from about 50 yards for birdie on the 18th hole to finish in a tie for fourth. He won the silver medal for the low amateur.

==Professional career==

The day after his success at the 1998 Open Championship, Rose turned professional. Rose struggled badly in his early career. He missed the cut in his first 21 consecutive events, including the European Tour qualifying school in 1998. He earned his first European Tour card when he finished 4th at the qualifying school in 1999. The following season he failed to retain his card and had to revisit the qualifying school, where he finished 9th.

Despite his early career struggles, Rose&#x27;s career soon began to take off and he became established on the European Tour. In 2001, he opened the season with consecutive second-place finishes in South Africa. He went on to finish the year in top-40 on the Order of Merit. He won his first professional event, the Dunhill Championship in South Africa, in 2002, and followed this up with three further victories in that year. They included another win in South Africa at the Nashua Masters, a win on the Japan Golf Tour at The Crowns Tournament, and then he won his second European Tour title at the Victor Chandler British Masters, edging out Ian Poulter in the final round.

In 2003, Rose reached number 33 in the Official World Golf Ranking. He earned enough money to claim his PGA Tour card as a non-member for 2004 after finishing with more money than the 125th ranked player on the money list. In 2004, he played mostly in America on the PGA Tour while also maintaining his membership on the European Tour. He did not have a great year and slipped out of the top 50 in the world rankings; however, he kept his tour card after earning in excess of a million dollars.

His ranking continued to fall in early 2005, and in March he announced that he was quitting the European Tour and concentrating on playing on the PGA Tour. This had no apparent effect on his poor form, and by the middle of the year, he had fallen out of the World&#x27;s top 100. In August of that year, he made an about-face by announcing his intention to return to the European Tour. Later the same week he had his best result of the year, leading the Buick Championship in Connecticut after three rounds before slipping to a third-place finish. A couple of further good results followed late in the 2005 season, and he maintained his status on the PGA Tour after all.

In September 2006 at the Canadian Open, Rose led a PGA Tour tournament going into the final round for the first time. But he slipped up with a final round 74 which moved him down the field. He went on to finish 2nd at the Valero Texas Open and finished 47th on the money list with US$1.629 million in prize money. In November 2006 he won the Australian Masters, to claim his first title for four years. His renewed consistency, including a top 5 finish at the 2007 Masters, saw him surpass his previous best world ranking, by reaching number 26 on 8 April 2007.
Rose lost in a playoff at the 2007 BMW PGA Championship but moved into the top twenty of the World Rankings for the first time. By October he had reached a new career high of 12 and became the top-ranked British golfer. Rose won the European Tour Order of Merit title for 2007 in a thrilling climax to the season at the Volvo Masters, which he won in a playoff on 4 November. His new world ranking of number 7 made him the top-ranked European golfer for the first time, and he subsequently moved up to sixth in the rankings. Since the end of 2009, Canadian golf instructor Sean Foley coaches Rose.

=== PGA Tour ===
In 2010, Rose had a third place at the Honda Classic in Florida, and then he broke through with a victory at the Memorial Tournament in Ohio with a final round 66 to win by three strokes over Rickie Fowler. This was his first win on American soil. The next day, Rose had to try to qualify for the U.S. Open, along with runner-up Rickie Fowler. Neither qualified, which raised questions about the qualification process of the U.S. Open. In his first tournament start since the Memorial, at the Travelers Championship (Connecticut) two weeks later, Rose led by three shots entering the final round but fell away to a tie for ninth. His good form continued the following week at the AT&amp;T National where he shot a final-round even par 70 to win the tournament.

In 2011, Rose continued with success. He entered the final round of the Transitions Championship (Florida) with a one-stroke lead. However, he shot a three-over-par 74, including four consecutive bogeys, in the middle of the round to finish five shots behind champion Gary Woodland. In September 2011, Rose played the BMW Championship at Cog Hill Golf &amp; Country Club (Illinois), the third of the four FedEx Cup playoff events. A flawless round of 63 on the opening day helped Rose to build a four stroke advantage going into the final round. Even though there was a late wobble with a bogey at the par-5 15th hole, Rose recovered and won by two strokes from John Senden.

In 2012, Rose played World Golf Championship event at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral Golf Resort &amp; Spa. He entered the final round three strokes behind Bubba Watson. However, Rose played well in the final round and took a two-stroke lead entering the par-4 18th hole. He found the right rough with his tee shot and could not get up and down from the back of the green, making bogey. This left Watson requiring a birdie to tie Rose. Watson hit an iron shot from the right hand rough to within ten feet but could not make the birdie putt giving Rose the biggest win of his career. At the 2012 PGA Championship, Rose recorded his best ever performance in a major championship with a T-3. At the 2012 Ryder Cup, Rose played a major part in Team Europe&#x27;s comeback against the United States. Rose holed putts of 10, 35, and 12 feet on the final three holes to defeat Phil Mickelson 1 up. On 12 October 2012, Rose won the 8-man Turkish Airlines World Golf Final defeating Lee Westwood by a single stroke in the final. He also beat Tiger Woods by a stroke in the semi-final after progressing from his group with a 100% record. On 25 March 2013, Rose finished second to Tiger Woods at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and rose to a career-high of third in the world rankings.

In June 2013, Rose played the U.S. Open. Rose entered the final round two strokes behind leader Phil Mickelson at one-over-par. In the final round, Rose birdied the 6th and the 7th holes to tie the lead. Rose three-putted the 11th for bogey to fall back to one-over-par for the tournament. Around the same time, Mickelson holed his second shot from the fairway at the par-4 10th for eagle to regain the lead. However, Rose responded with birdies at the 12th and 13th holes to move back into the solo lead. Rose could not get up and down from a bunker on the 14th hole, however, and a bogey on the 16th hole dropped him to level for the day. However, Mickelson recorded bogeys at the 13th and 15th holes to remain one shot behind Rose. At the par-4 18th hole, Rose hit a 4-iron approach to the back of green to ensure par. He had the clubhouse lead. Mickelson, needing a birdie at the last to tie Rose, blocked his drive and could not reach the green in two. He hit his pitch shot near the pin but could not hole it. Rose won the tournament by two over Mickelson and Jason Day. He became the first Englishman to win the U.S. Open since Tony Jacklin in 1970.

In June 2014, Rose won the Quicken Loans National defeating Shawn Stefani on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff. Two weeks later, Rose won the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open. At the 2014 Ryder Cup, Rose emerged as the leading points-getter, amassing four points in a 3-0-2 performance, as Europe won. At the 2015 Masters Tournament, Rose finished in a tie for second with Phil Mickelson behind winner Jordan Spieth. Two weeks later he won his seventh PGA Tour tournament at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. In October, he won the UBS Hong Kong Open on the European Tour defeating Lucas Bjerregaard by one stroke.Rose earned rights to represent the United Kingdom at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. On the opening day, he became the first ever player to make a hole-in-one in Olympic play after recording it on the 189-yard par-3 4th hole of Gil Hanse&#x27;s new Olympic Course in Barra da Tijuca using a 7-iron. Described as having an inspiring effect on the rest of the Great Britain team, Rose later gave the golf ball from that hole-in-one to gymnast Nile Wilson, who would go on to win a bronze medal in the horizontal bar. Rose went to the 18th hole on Sunday tied at −15 with playing partner Henrik Stenson of Sweden. Rose then produced a backspin pitch that left him with a short birdie putt which he converted while Stenson underhit his approach and eventually three-putted for bogey. Rose won the gold medal. Shortly thereafter, Rose brought his Olympic gold medal to The Barclays at Bethpage Black and wore it around his neck, on the suggestion of playing partner Phil Mickelson&#x27;s caddy Jim &quot;Bones&quot; McKay and to cheers from the gallery, during his final putt.

In April 2017, Rose shot opening rounds of 71-72 at the Masters to enter the weekend as one of only a handful of players under par. In the third round, he fired a five-under round of 67 to co-lead through 54 holes with Sergio García. His round consisted of seven birdies, which resulted in a 31 on the back nine to move into contention for his second major championship. Rose ultimately lost to García in a sudden-death playoff. In October, Rose played the WGC-HSBC Champions. He was tied for fourth place, eight strokes behind leader Dustin Johnson after the third round. However, in the final round Rose shot a 67 to Johnson&#x27;s 77 to win by two strokes. Late in the year, Rose won the Turkish Airlines Open, a Rolex Series event, on the European Tour and the Indonesian Masters, an Asian Tour event. In December 2017, it was announced that Rose would be the host of the 2018 British Masters. He opted to take the event to Walton Heath Golf Club.
In May 2018, Rose won the Fort Worth Invitational on the PGA Tour. Two months later, in July, Rose tied for second with a score of six-under-par at the 2018 Open Championship. His cumulative score of twelve-under-par across all four 2018 major championships was the best amongst everyone who made the cut in all four tournaments. In September 2018, he placed high in two FedEx Cup Playoffs events, finishing second at the Dell Technologies Championship and losing a playoff to Keegan Bradley at the BMW Championship. Those finishes moved Rose to World Number One in the Official World Golf Ranking. The next week, Rose finished T4 at the Tour Championship to win the season-long FedEx Cup and $10,000,000. Rose was part of the winning European team at the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National outside of Paris, France. On 4 November 2018, Rose successfully defended his title at the Turkish Airlines Open with a playoff victory over Li Haotong. This victory returned Rose to World Number One and earned him $1,166,660.

In January 2019, Rose won the Farmers Insurance Open on the PGA Tour. Around this time, he announced new sponsors. He transitioned from TaylorMade Golf to Honma in a 10-club deal. He also switched from Adidas to Bonobos for his clothing. In May 2020, the deal with Honma was cancelled by Rose, however, after he fell from #1 to #14 in the world rankings. In June, Rose finished tied for 3rd at the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, California.

In February 2023, Rose ended a four-year winless streak when he won the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. He shot a final-round 66 to win by three shots over Brendon Todd and Brandon Wu.

In September 2023, Rose played on the European team in the 2023 Ryder Cup at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Guidonia, Rome, Italy. The European team won 16.5–11.5 and Rose went 1–1–1 including a loss in his Sunday singles match against Patrick Cantlay.

In July 2024, Rose tied for runner-up in the 2024 Open Championship for the second time at Royal Troon.

In January 2012, they had a daughter.

<text>The SR Z class was an 0-8-0T 3-cylinder tank engine designed by Richard Maunsell and intended for heavy shunting on the Southern Railway, the first eight entering into service in 1929. It was a successful design and would have been built in greater numbers, but an order for a further ten was cancelled in 1930 due to the reduction in freight traffic as a result of the Great Depression.

==Background==
The newly amalgamated Southern Railway needed a group of powerful shunting tank locomotives to work in its marshalling yards around London and on freight transfers between them. Robert Urie&#x27;s G16 class 4-8-0 performed this task well, and further examples were on order in 1922, but Richard Maunsell considered the firebox to be too large and the superheater an unnecessary expense on such locomotives. He therefore cancelled the order in favour of a new design.

Due to the requirement for heavy shunting, the design was provided with an 0-8-0 wheel arrangement to increase traction, whilst enabling the locomotives to negotiate tight curves prevalent in goods yards. Another requirement was for the locomotive to be able to maintain power after long periods of standing idle, as freight marshalling was an intermittent duty. A water capacity was also required to reduce the need for regular watering.

== Construction history ==
The new class was largely designed at Ashford railway works but, as a result of the unexpected need to redesign and rebuild the SECR K class locomotives at Ashford, Maunsell decided to construct the Z class at Brighton. One result of this change was that the boiler used was of an existing Brighton design, that of the D.E. Marsh C3 class. The resultant design was a three-cylinder locomotive that incorporated Walschaerts outside valve gear, controlling the outside cylinders, and custom-built inside gear controlling the central cylinder. The first of the class emerged from Brighton in March 1929 followed by the remainder over the next six months.

Steam and vacuum brakes, as well as steam heating were provided. This was to enable the locomotive to undertake the shunting of passenger stock should such a role be called for. A second batch of ten locomotives was planned to be constructed at Eastleigh, but the economic climate in 1931 meant that the order was scrapped. By the time trade recovered in the mid 1930s, Maunsell had begun experimenting in the use of diesel-electric shunting locomotives for these duties, and no further examples were built.

== Operational details ==
Throughout their working lives, the Z class locomotives remained in their role as heavy shunters in the larger marshalling yards at Feltham, Hither Green, Norwood Junction, Exmouth Junction and Eastleigh, and proved to be very popular with the locomotive crews until they were replaced by diesel shunters of the D3/13 class (later Class 12) in the early 1950s. They were less successful at Nine Elms yard as the buffer beams overhung the ends of the locomotives by in total, which could be a disadvantage when negotiating tight curves in a confined space during shunting.

In December 1942 three of the class were loaned to the War Department, and saw service in Scotland where their abilities to move heavy freight were needed to move troop trains and war materials over winding routes. These were considered a rarity amongst locomotive crews, and due to the customised inside valve gear, the regulators worked in a different fashion to the norm, therefore causing problems amongst those unfamiliar with the design. They returned to the Southern Railway in May 1943.

As more diesel-electric shunters were delivered during the 1950s the class was gradually transferred to less demanding work at Brighton and Tonbridge freight yards. Towards the end of their working lives, the entire class was moved to the Western section of the BR Southern Region (BR(SR)), where their traction was put to good use in banking trains up the steep bank between Exeter St. David&#x27;s and Exeter Central stations. However, with the reorganisation of the BR regions in 1962, the Western section of the BR(SR) came under the control of the BR Western Region (BR(WR)). As the Z class was not of a standard design under BR(WR) control, they were withdrawn throughout 1962, and banking duties were taken over by ex-GWR Pannier Tanks.

==Livery and numbering==

=== Southern===
Livery was black, with yellow numbering and &#x27;Southern&#x27; on the tank sides. As the class were built at Brighton the locomotives should logically have been allocated numbers in the ‘B’ (Brighton) series but they rather entered traffic as A950–A957 reflecting their Ashford origins. However, by the time of the 1931 renumbering scheme when Ashford locomotives had 1000 added to their numbers, the numbers 1950–1957 had already been allocated. The class were therefore numbered in the western section sequence 950–957.

===Post-1948 (nationalisation)===
Livery remained black in the guise of BR Freight Black, and the locomotives were provided with the BR crest on the tanks, whilst the numbering was located on the sides of the coal bunker. The Z class were given the numbers 30950–30957 under the BR standard numbering system.

== Preservation attempt ==
A private attempt was made in the 1960s to preserve a Z class, BR no 30952 with the intention to locate it on the Bluebell Railway in Sussex. The locomotive was withdrawn from service in November 1962 and stored in working order at Exmouth Junction locomotive shed until the Spring of 1963. It was then moved to Fratton MPD where it was stored for the remainder of 1963 and most of 1964. Eventually the preservation attempt failed, and the locomotive was on the scrap line at Eastleigh Works, with coupling rods removed and tied to one side, by October 1964. It was at Bristol (Barrow Road) MPD for a short period early in 1965 while on its way to South Wales for scrapping. It was cut up at Cashmores of Newport in May 1965.

<doc id="1323427" wikidata="Q3475344" url="?curid=1323427" title="Disruption of 1843">
<text>The Disruption of 1843, also known as the Great Disruption, was a schism in 1843 in which 450 evangelical ministers broke away from the Church of Scotland to form the Free Church of Scotland.
The main conflict was over whether the Church of Scotland or the British Government had the power to control clerical positions and benefits. The Disruption came at the end of a bitter conflict within the Church of Scotland, and had major effects in the church and upon Scottish civic life.

==The patronage issue==
&quot;The Church of Scotland was recognised by Acts of the Parliament as the national church of the Scottish people&quot;. Particularly under John Knox and later Andrew Melville, the Church of Scotland had always claimed an inherent right to exercise independent spiritual jurisdiction over its own affairs. To some extent, this right was recognised by the Claim of Right of 1689, which ended royal and parliamentary interference in the order and worship of the church. It was ratified by the Act of Union in 1707.

On the other hand, the right of patronage, in which the patron of a parish had the right to install a minister of his choice, became a point of contention. Many church members believed that this right infringed on the spiritual independence of the church. Others felt that this right was a property of the state. As early as 1712 the right of patronage had been restored in Scotland, amid remonstrances from the church. For many years afterwards, the church&#x27;s General Assembly tried to reform this practice. However the dominant Moderate Party in the church blocked reform out of fear of conflict with the British Government.

==The &quot;Ten Years&#x27; Conflict&quot;==

=== Veto Act ===

In 1834, the evangelical party attained a majority in the General Assembly for the first time in 100 years. One of their actions was to pass the Veto Act, which gave parishioners the right to reject a minister nominated by their patron. The Veto Act was to prevent the intrusion of ministers on unwilling parishioners, and to restore the importance of the congregational &quot;call&quot;. However, it served to polarise positions in the church, and set it on a collision course with the government.

The first test of the Veto Act came with the &quot;Auchterarder&quot; case of 1834. The parish of Auchterarder unanimously rejected the patron&#x27;s nominee – and the Presbytery refused to proceed with his ordination and induction. The nominee, Robert Young, appealed to the Court of Session. In 1838, by an 8–5 majority, the court held that in passing the Veto Act, the church had acted &quot;ultra vires&quot;, and had infringed the statutory rights of patrons. It also ruled Church of Scotland was a creation of the state and derived its legitimacy from act of Parliament.

The&quot; Auchterarder&quot; ruling contradicted the Scottish church&#x27;s Confession of Faith. As Burleigh puts it: &quot;The notion of the Church as an independent community governed by its own officers and capable of entering into a compact with the state was repudiated&quot; (p. 342). An appeal to the House of Lords was rejected.

=== Further conflicts ===

In a second case, the Court of Session summoned the Presbytery of Dunkeld for proceeding with an ordination despite a court interdict. In 1839, the General Assembly suspended seven ministers from Strathbogie for proceeding with an induction in Marnoch in defiance of its orders. In 1841, the seven Strathbogie ministers were deposed for acknowledging the superiority of the secular court in spiritual matters.

The evangelical party later presented to parliament a &quot;Claim, Declaration and Protest Anent the Encroachments of the Court of Session&quot;. The claim recognised the jurisdiction of the civil courts over the endowments that the government gave to the Scottish church. This &quot;The Claim of Right&quot; was drawn up by Alexander Murray Dunlop. However, the claim resolved that the church give up these endowments rather than see the &#x27;Crown Rights of the Redeemer&#x27; (i.e. the spiritual independence of the church) compromised. This claim was rejected by parliament in January 1843, leading to the Disruption in May.

==The Disruption==
On 18 May 1843, 121 ministers and 73 elders led by David Welsh met at the Church of St Andrew in George Street, Edinburgh. After Welsh read a Protest, the group left St. Andrews and walked down the hill to the Tanfield Hall at Canonmills. There they held the first meeting of the Free Church of Scotland, the Disruption Assembly. Thomas Chalmers was appointed the first Moderator. On 23 May, a second meeting was held for the signing of the Act of Separation by the ministers. Eventually, 474 of about 1,200 ministers left the Church of Scotland for the Free Church.

In leaving the established church, however, they did not reject the principle of establishment. As Chalmers declared: &quot;Though we quit the Establishment, we go out on the Establishment principle; we quit a vitiated Establishment but would rejoice in returning to a pure one. We are advocates for a national recognition of religion – and we are not voluntaries.&quot;

Perhaps a third of the evangelicals, the &quot;middle party&quot;, remained within the established church – wishing to preserve its unity. However, for those who left, the issue was clear. It was not the democratising of the church (although concern with power for ordinary people was a movement sweeping Europe at the time), but whether the Church was sovereign within its own domain. The body of the church reflecting Jesus Christ, not the monarch nor Parliament, was to be its head. The Disruption was basically a spiritual phenomenon – and for its proponents it stood in a direct line with the Reformation and the National Covenants.

Splitting the church had major implications. Those who left forfeited livings, manses and pulpits, and had, without the aid of the establishment, to found and finance a national church from scratch. This was done with remarkable energy, zeal and sacrifice. Another implication was that the church they left was more tolerant of a wider range of doctrinal views.

There was also the issue of needing to train its clergy, resulting in the establishment of New College, with Chalmers appointed as its first principal. It was founded as an institution to educate future ministers and the Scottish leadership, who would in turn guide the moral and religious lives of the Scottish people. New College opened its doors to 168 students in November 1843, including about 100 students who had begun their theological studies before the Disruption.

Most of the principles on which the protestors went out were conceded by Parliament by 1929, clearing the way for the re-union of that year, but the Church of Scotland never fully regained its position after the division.

===Photographic portraiture===
The painter David Octavius Hill was present at the Disruption Assembly and decided to record the scene. He received encouragement from another spectator, the physicist Sir David Brewster who suggested using the new invention, photography, to get likenesses of all the ministers present, and introduced Hill to the photographer Robert Adamson. Subsequently, a series of photographs were taken of those who had been present, and the 5-foot x 11-foot 4 inches (1.53 m x 3.45 m) painting was eventually completed in 1866. The partnership that developed between Hill and Adamson pioneered the art of photography in Scotland. The painting predominantly features the ministers involved in the Disruption but Hill also included many other men – and some women – who were involved in the establishment of the Free Church. The painting depicts 457 people of the 1500 or so who were present at the assembly on 23 May 1843.

==In literature and the arts==
The social tensions underlying the Disruption are the subject of William Alexander&#x27;s novel, &quot;Johnny Gibb of Gushetneuk&quot; (1870). David Octavius Hill&#x27;s use of photography to record the ministers who participated in the schism of 1843 features in Ali Bacon&#x27;s novel &quot;In the Blink of an Eye&quot; (2018).

<text>&quot;A Short Drink from a Certain Fountain&quot; is an episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. In this episode, a scientist gives his brother an experimental youth serum in order to save his marriage to a much younger woman. The episode&#x27;s title refers to the mythical Fountain of Youth.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Harmon Gordon, a wealthy old man married to a much younger woman named Flora, is exhausted by his wife&#x27;s youthful and selfish lifestyle. Seeking to keep up the pace, he asks his scientist brother Raymond to inject him with an experimental youth serum. Raymond firmly refuses at first, saying that the serum has had mixed results with laboratory animals and will not be ready for human trials without decades of refinement. Moreover, he abhors Flora for her callous treatment of his brother and is not enthusiastic about any step to strengthen their marriage. When Harmon suggests he will commit suicide rather than lose Flora, Raymond reluctantly agrees to administer the serum.

Per his instructions, Harmon rests after taking the serum. He later wakens to find himself a young man, to Flora&#x27;s surprised delight. Before Harmon can enjoy his new youth however, the regression continues until he eventually becomes a toddler hours later. Flora tries to leave, but Raymond insists she must stay and raise the infant Harmon or be cut off from Harmon&#x27;s fortune, threatening legal action against her should she disobey. Finding a stroke of poetic justice in what has happened, Raymond points out that by the time Harmon has regained adulthood, his position with Flora will be reversed, with her being old.

==Closing narration==
==Production==
Initially, the Raymond Gordon character was to be a typical family physician. Disturbed by the character&#x27;s willingness to experiment on a fellow human (Harmon, his brother), CBS asked that his occupation be changed to that of a research scientist. Serling complied.

The opening narration uses an allusion to the poet Henry Thoreau, a poet, essayist, and philosopher who spoke extensively on aging, maturity, and romantic themes—all of which feature extensively in the narrative.

This episode (because of a lawsuit filed by someone claiming they had the idea for the story first) was not included in the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; syndication package until 1984. When this and other long unseen episodes became available (including &quot;Miniature&quot;), a series of short introductions were shot featuring commentary from the cast and crew of the original episodes. In the segment with Patrick O&#x27;Neal for this episode, O&#x27;Neal remarked on how accurately the show&#x27;s makeup effects artists had aged him, as he now very closely resembled his older appearance in this episode. O&#x27;Neal was only eight years older than Ruta Lee, who played the much younger Flora.

<text>Stevia rebaudiana is a plant species in the genus &quot;Stevia&quot; of the family Asteraceae. It is commonly known as candyleaf, sweetleaf or sugarleaf.

It is a small seasonal plant which grows to a height of . It has elongated leaves that grow along the stems and are lined up against each other. The flowers are typically trimmed to improve the taste of the leaves. Stevia is a tender perennial native to parts of Brazil and Paraguay having humid, wet environments.

Stevia is widely grown for its leaves, from which extracts can be manufactured as sweetener products known generically as stevia and sold under various trade names. The chemical compounds that produce its sweetness are various steviol glycosides (mainly stevioside and rebaudioside), which have 200–300 times the sweetness of sugar. Stevia leaves contain 9.1% stevioside and 3.8% rebaudioside A.

==Description==
&quot;Stevia rebaudiana&quot; is a perennial herb growing up to tall. The flowers are white with light purple accents and no fragrance. Plants produce fruit which is ribbed spindle-shaped. Stevia prefers sandy-like soil.

=== Chemistry ===
In 1931, chemists M. Bridel and R. Lavielle isolated the glycosides stevioside and rebaudioside that give the leaves their sweet taste. The exact structures of the aglycone steviol and its glycoside were published in 1955.

==Cultivation==
Beginning in the 1960s, commercial cultivation had spread to Japan, Southeast Asia and the US, but also in mildly tropical climates in hilly areas of Nepal or India (Assam region). The plant prefers warm, moist and sunny conditions. The plant cannot survive frost during the winter and therefore greenhouses are used to grow stevia in Europe.

&quot;Stevia rebaudiana&quot; is found in the wild in semiarid habitats ranging from grassland to mountain terrain, do produce seeds, but only a small percentage of the seeds germinate.

&quot;Stevia rebaudiana&quot; has been grown on an experimental basis in Ontario, Canada, since 1987 to determine the feasibility of commercial cultivation. Duke University researchers developed a strategic plan to assist farmers and exporters in Paraguay to compete in the global market for stevia.

==Uses==
&quot;Stevia rebaudiana&quot; has been used over centuries by the Guaraní people of Brazil and Paraguay, who called it &quot;ka&#x27;a he&#x27;ẽ&quot; (&quot;sweet herb&quot;), to sweeten the local yerba mate tea, as medicine, and as a &quot;sweet treat&quot;.

In 1899, botanist Moisés Santiago Bertoni first described the plant as growing in eastern Paraguay, and observed its sweet taste.

When extracts of its leaves are processed into a powder, stevia is used as a sugar substitute in most of the developed world.

Based on the JECFA (Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives) declaration, safe consumption of steviol glycosides for humans is determined to be 4 mg/kg body weight per day. It was also agreed by the European Commission in 2011 for use in food in European countries. Steviol glycosides have also been accepted in the US as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Stevia leaf and raw extracts are not treated as GRAS and their import into the US is not allowed for usage as sweeteners.

<doc id="1323442" wikidata="Q1578573" url="?curid=1323442" title="The Flying Pickets">
<text>The Flying Pickets are a British &quot;a cappella&quot; vocal group which had a Christmas number one hit in 1983 on the UK Singles Chart with their cover version of Yazoo&#x27;s track &quot;Only You&quot;.

==History==
The band of six was founded by Brian Hibbard in 1982 from a group of actors who had been active with him in John McGrath&#x27;s 7:84 theatre group, a fringe theatre organisation who had sung &quot;a cappella&quot; in their production of the 1981 play &quot;One Big Blow&quot;. The group chose the name the Flying Pickets as band members had played a part in the UK miners&#x27; strikes of 1972 and 1974.

Performing in clubs and pubs in London, the Flying Pickets came up with a concept of transferring the art of &quot;a cappella&quot; to the pop music scene. Joining Hibbard in the group were Rick Lloyd (who also wrote the music to &quot;One Big Blow&quot;), Gareth Williams, David Brett, Ken Gregson (real name Kenneth Gregory) and Red Stripe (real name David Gittins). The members of the group were internationally renowned for their flamboyant appearance: Hibbard&#x27;s huge sideburns, Stripe&#x27;s thick eye-liner, and the others showing off gaudy suits and large hats. Two of the other original members, Ron Donachie and Christopher Ryan left the band before &quot;Only You&quot;.

&quot;Only You&quot;, their first single, was the UK Christmas number one in 1983 spending a total of five weeks at the top, and also doing well around Europe and in Canada, where it reached number 17 in spring 1984. It emulated the success of the original Yazoo version. The video was shot in the Red Duster public house in South Shields Tyne and Wear.

The name &quot;Flying Pickets&quot; refers to mobile strikers who travel in order to join a picket, reflecting the group&#x27;s radical socialist political views. The height of the group&#x27;s fame coincided with the 1984 miners strike, when the National Union of Mineworkers called strike action following the National Coal Board&#x27;s decision to close 20 pits – a move which would claim some 20,000 jobs. The Flying Pickets were vocal in their support of the miners during the dispute and came to blows with the record label Virgin after they picketed Drax Power Station in Yorkshire. They also performed benefit gigs for the miners. Hibbard himself claimed that their political beliefs probably had a detrimental effect on the group&#x27;s mainstream image but it was a sacrifice they were willing to make; according to the group, one well-known record store refused to sell the group&#x27;s albums due to their support of strike action.

Despite the group&#x27;s socialist views, the Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher proclaimed, to much amusement and skepticism, that &quot;Only You&quot; was her favourite record. A second single, a cover version of Van McCoy&#x27;s &quot;(When You&#x27;re) Young and in Love&quot; (originally written for Ruby and the Romantics) reached number 7 in the UK, but their third, a cover of the Eurythmics&#x27; &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; barely charted.

In 1986, Hibbard and Stripe left the band and were replaced by Gary Howard and Hereward Kaye. Hibbard and Stripe tried to stay in the music industry, forming their own act called Brian and Stripe, but their first and only single, a cover version of Yazoo&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Blue&quot;, failed to chart, and they returned to their separate acting careers.

In 1987, the Flying Pickets sang the title song (in Latin, &quot;Dives in Omnia&quot;) and endtitles reprise to &quot;Porterhouse Blue&quot;, in the style of a medieval university drinking-song.

The group sang two songs on the Eric Woolfson/Alan Parsons 1990 album &quot;Freudiana&quot;.

The Flying Pickets&#x27; line-up has changed throughout the years, but the band never died; since the Pickets began, there have been around 27 members. The last member of the original line-up, David Brett, left the band in 1990. However, in 1994, the original line-up (minus Lloyd) reformed to record one more album.

Although none of the founding members have been part of the group since 1990, the Flying Pickets continue to record albums and tour all over Europe and abroad.

==Post-Picket activities==
Hibbard, the group&#x27;s founder and lead singer, pursued a career as a television actor, making a guest appearance in the 1987 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Delta and the Bannermen&quot;. His first regular TV role came in 1989, playing petty criminal &quot;Chunky&quot; in three series of Manchester-based comedy drama &quot;Making Out&quot; (1989-1991), followed by a two-year stint in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as garage mechanic Doug Murray. Other appearances include &quot;Minder&quot;, &quot;The Armando Iannucci Shows&quot;, &quot;Satellite City&quot;, Welsh language soap &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot; as well as the youth drama &quot;Pam Fi, Duw?&quot; and in the 1997 film &quot;Twin Town&quot; as the self-styled &quot;Karaoke King&quot; Dai Rees.

In 2006, Hibbard won the BAFTA Cymru Award for Best Actor for his role as Tony in the film &quot;Little White Lies&quot;. He died on 17 June 2012.

Brett toured with the English Shakespeare Company and appeared as Mad Mike the Mechanic in the BBC children&#x27;s TV programme &quot;Marlene Marlowe Investigates&quot;. In 2000, Brett played the part of Dedalus Diggle in the film &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;.

Williams toured in a production of &quot;South Pacific&quot; and also with The English Shakespeare Company; he played Nathan Detroit in a production of &quot;Guys &amp; Dolls&quot;. He also worked with Jonathan Miller on a TV adaptation of Henry Mayhew&#x27;s &quot;London Labour, London Poor&quot;. In 2009, he understudied and went on for Patrick Stewart in the Theatre Royal Haymarket production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;.

Gittins worked in bread delivery after leaving the band, then decided to move to Australia where he took a job as a stage mechanist at The Victorian State Theatre. He also co-developed the techno act Poets of the Machine.

Gregson also emigrated to Australia and has made an appearance in the soap &quot;Neighbours&quot;.

Lloyd was a joint winner of a BAFTA TV Award for his work on the 1987 TV series &quot;Porterhouse Blue&quot;, and was musical director for the 1999 film &quot;Julie and the Cadillacs&quot;.

<text>The Tancredo Neves Bridge, better known as Fraternity Bridge (Portuguese: Ponte da Fraternidade, Spanish: Puente de la Fraternidad) connects the Brazilian city of Foz do Iguaçu with the Argentine Puerto Iguazú, crossing over the Iguassu River.

The idea of building the bridge had begun after the construction of the Friendship Bridge 1965, between Brazil and Paraguay. The Fraternity Bridge&#x27;s construction started on January 13, 1982, and was officially inaugurated on November 29, 1985, and named after Brazilian politician Tancredo Neves.

The bridge is long, wide and high at its highest point.

<text>Fort Clinton was an American Revolutionary War fort erected by the Continental Army on the west bank of the Hudson River in 1776. 

==Protecting the chain==
It was one of a pair of fortifications which straddled the confluence of Popolopen Creek, standing on the south side of Popolopen Gorge, with Fort Montgomery to the north. The forts defended a huge wrought iron chain that spanned the Hudson from Fort Montgomery to Anthony&#x27;s Nose on the river&#x27;s east side. The sites of both forts are in present-day Highlands, Orange County, New York.

Fort Clinton&#x27;s garrison of 300 soldiers was smaller than Fort Montgomery&#x27;s, but it was built on higher ground, and its defenses were more complete. It was commanded by General James Clinton, for whom it was named (and not his brother, General George Clinton, or Sir Henry Clinton, the British Commander-in-Chief in North America and opposing general in the struggle over control of the strategically critical river).

==Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery==
On October 6, 1777, Forts Clinton and Montgomery were attacked by the British 63rd Regiment led by Sir Henry Clinton (a distant relative of James Clinton, according to information at the Fort Montgomery state historic site museum). The Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery was intense but brief, with both forts being overrun within an hour and the wounded General James Clinton retreating with his men through Popolopen Gorge. The forts were razed by the British, and the iron chain they sought to defend was dismantled. The Rebels installed another Hudson River Chain farther upriver.

Although the ruins of Fort Montgomery survive and the site is a National Historic Landmark, the Fort Clinton site was destroyed in the 1920s during the construction of U.S. Route 9W and the Bear Mountain Bridge. Today, the Fort Clinton site lies within Bear Mountain State Park and is used for the Trailside Museum and Zoo.

<doc id="1323446" wikidata="Q1412507" url="?curid=1323446" title="Jeremiad">
<text>A jeremiad is a long literary work, usually in prose, but sometimes in verse, in which the author bitterly laments the state of society and its morals in a serious tone of sustained invective, and always contains a prophecy of society&#x27;s imminent downfall.

Generally, the term &quot;jeremiad&quot; is applied to moralistic texts that denounce a society for its wickedness, and prophesies its downfall. Over time, the impact of the term has faded and has become a general expression for lament. It is often perceived with derogatory overtones.

The jeremiad has a unique presence in American culture and in the history of the United States, having roots in Colonial-era settlers in New England. In American culture, jeremiads are closely associated with historical American Puritans and the concept of American exceptionalism.

==Origins and usage==
The word is named after the biblical prophet Jeremiah, and comes from biblical works attributed to him, the &quot;Book of Jeremiah&quot; and the &quot;Book of Lamentations&quot;. The Book of Jeremiah prophesies the coming downfall of the Kingdom of Judah, and asserts that this is because its rulers have broken the covenant with the Lord.

The &quot;Lamentations&quot;, similarly, lament the fall of the kingdom of Judah after the conquest prophesied by Jeremiah has occurred:

How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!

She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.

Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.

The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines Jeremiad as: &quot;a literary work or speech expressing a bitter lament or a righteous prophecy of doom&quot;. As well as being form of Lamentation; an utterance of grief or sorrow; a complaining tirade: used with a spice of ridicule or mockery, implying either that the grief itself is unnecessarily great, or that the utterance of it is tediously drawn out and attended with a certain satisfaction to the utterer. Third definition is &quot;a tale of sorrow, disappointment, or complaint; a doleful story; a dolorous tirade; - generally used satirically.&quot; Merriam-Webster dictionary defines Jeremiad as &quot;a prolonged lamentation or complaint also : a cautionary or angry .

== Use in American culture ==

The jeremiad was a favorite literary device of the Puritans, and was used in prominent early evangelical sermons like &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God&quot; by Jonathan Edwards. Besides Jonathan Edwards, such jeremiads can be found in every era of American history, including John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and James Fenimore Cooper.

The term has also found use in American literature. Works by Norman Mailer (&quot;The Armies of the Night&quot;), Thomas Pynchon (&quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;), Nathanael West (&quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;) and Hubert Selby (&quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;) were interpreted as jeremiads, as were older works of American literature such as Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;The Confidence-Man&quot; or William Faulkner&#x27;s Southern literature.

The works of Gildas and Robert Bork have also been described as jeremiads. Extending that tradition in a reflective vein is the autobiographical work of freed American slave Frederick Douglass, who lamented the moral corruption that slavery wrought on America – from both a Jeffersonian and Christian tradition.

===Role in American politics===

According to the Canadian literary scholar Sacvan Bercovitch, in a typical American jeremiad, the biblical promise of a perfect society contradicts the actual mistakes of American society. The jeremiad thus has the function of a social corrective in that it links salvation to the righteous behavior of Americans. Bercovitch found this pattern in many political speeches.

The role of America as a myth and concept of salvation is an important part of the political rhetoric of the United States and is described, among other things, in inaugural speeches. America is described as a world and salvation history experiment with a role model character, as a vision and also cited self-accusatory and apocalyptic tones. It corresponds to a civil religious tradition of rhetorical millennialism.

<text>The Niagara Falls Thunder were a junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League from 1988 to 1996. The team was based in Niagara Falls, Ontario.

==History==
Niagara Falls became home to its third OHL franchise in 1988 upon the relocation of the Hamilton Steelhawks. The new team was named the Niagara Falls Thunder. The team filled the void left behind when the Niagara Falls Flyers departed for North Bay in 1982. 
The Thunder picked up on the winning note of the Steelhawks&#x27; last season in Hamilton. Coach Bill LaForge returned with a strong core of players that lead the team to a second-place finish in 1988–89. Niagara Falls reached the OHL finals the first year in their new home city, losing to the Peterborough Petes.

Many players graduated from the OHL after that season and the Thunder began to rebuild for 1989–90. Shortly into the season, growing tensions between team owner Rick Gay and coach Bill LaForge led to the coach being fired. LaForge was never forgiven by the fans for perhaps costing the team a chance of the Memorial Cup in 1989.

The Thunder hired the younger and up-and-coming Oshawa Generals&#x27; assistant coach George Burnett to take over. The team rallied from out of the playoffs to 6th place. Niagara Falls continued its momentum into the third round of the playoffs knocking off the first place London Knights before losing to the Kitchener Rangers.

The Thunder finished the next two seasons in second place, and made it to the third round of the playoffs both years, a feat they managed four years in a row. Coach Burnett was voted Coach of the Year for 1990–91 and 1991–92. Both years their playoff nemesis, the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, eliminated them in the semi-finals.

Many players graduated in 1992 for professional careers, and Coach Burnett was promoted to the Cape Breton Oilers of the AHL. He won the Calder Cup with the team in 1992–93.

The team never regained its strength of the first four seasons. After three poor seasons on the ice from 1992–93 to 1994–95, game attendance was dropping. This, combined with rescheduling of Sunday games to Saturday nights, and an aging arena with no new arena deal in sight, resulted in the Thunder moving to Erie, Pennsylvania, to play as the Otters.

==Coaches==
George Burnett was voted the OHL Coach of the Year in the 1990–91 and 1991–92 seasons, winning the Matt Leyden Trophy in only his first and second full seasons as a head coach in the OHL.

<text>Borðoy (, ) is an island in the north-east of the Faroe Islands. Its name means &#x27;headland island&#x27;. There are eight settlements: Klaksvík (the second largest town in the Faroes), Norðoyri, Ánir, Árnafjørður, Strond, Norðtoftir, Depil and Norðdepil.

==History==

There are also three abandoned settlements: Skálatoftir, Múli and Fossá, all in the north. Múli was one of the remotest settlements in the Faroes – there was no road link until 1989, before which goods had to be brought in via helicopter or boat. The last people left in 1994.

A Klaksvík museum bought the Fossá area in 1969 with the plan of turning it into a typical Faroese Medieval village, though the plan never came to fruition.

==Important Bird Area==
The northern and south-eastern headlands of the island have been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of their significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially European storm petrels (250 pairs) and black guillemots (200 pairs).

==Mountains==
The island has five mountains: Lokki (755 m), Háfjall (647 m), Borðoyarnes (392 m), Depilsknúkur (680 m), and Hálgafelli (503 m).

<doc id="1323454" wikidata="Q165948" url="?curid=1323454" title="Sapa Inca">
<text>The Sapa Inca (from Quechua &quot;sapa inka&quot;; ) was the monarch of the Inca Empire (&quot;Tawantinsuyu&quot; &quot;the region of the four [provinces]&quot;), as well as ruler of the earlier Kingdom of Cuzco and the later Neo-Inca State. While the origins of the position are mythical and originate from the legendary foundation of the city of Cuzco, it seems to have come into being historically around 1100 AD. Although the Inca believed the sapa Inca to be the son of Inti (the Sun god) and often referred to him as &quot;Inti churi&quot; &quot;solar son&quot; or &quot;Intip churin&quot; &quot;son of the Sun&quot;, the position eventually became hereditary, with son succeeding father. The principal wife of the Inca was known as the coya or &quot;quya&quot;. The Sapa Inca was at the top of the social hierarchy, and played a dominant role in the political and spiritual realm.

Manco Capac, the first Inca monarch, adopted the title &quot;capac&quot; or &quot;qhapaq&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;king&quot;). Inca Roca, the sixth Inca monarch, was evidently the first to bear the title &quot;sapa Inca&quot; (&quot;emperor&quot;) officially.

There were two known dynasties, led by the Hurin and Hanan moieties respectively. The latter was in power at the time of Spanish conquest. The last effective Sapa Inca of Inca Empire was Atahualpa, who was executed by Francisco Pizarro and his conquistadors in 1533, but several successors later claimed the title.

Other terms for &quot;sapa Inca&quot; include apu (&quot;lord&quot;), qhapaqInka (&quot;mighty Inca&quot;) or simply sapa (&quot;the only one&quot;).

==Choosing the Inca==
Chronicles identify the Inca as the highest ruler equivalent to European kings of the Middle Ages. However, the original access to that position was not linked to the inheritance of the eldest son, as is for a monarchy, but to the perceived selection of the gods by means of rigorous challenges, to which the physical and moral aptitudes of the pretender were tested. These trials were accompanied by a complex spiritual ritual through which the Sun god, Inti nominated the one who should assume the Inca position. Eventually, with the passage of time, Incas named their favorite son as co-governor with the intention of securing his succession, for example, Huiracocha Inca associated Inca Urco to the throne. The coya, or sapa Inca&#x27;s primary wife, had significant influence upon making this decision of which son is apt to succeed his father.

==Functions==
The Sapa Inca was the absolute ruler of the empire and accumulated in his power the political, social, military, and economic direction of the state. He ordered and directed the construction of great engineering works, such as Sacsayhuamán, a fortress that took 50 years to complete; or the urban plan of the cities. However, among their most notable works, was the network of roads that crossed the entire empire and allowed a rapid journey for the administrators, messengers, and armies provided with hanging bridges and tambos. They made sure to always be supplied and well cared for, as is reflected in the construction of storehouses scattered throughout the empire and vast food and resource redistribution systems. The commander and chief of the standing army founded military colonies to expand the culture and control, while simultaneously ensuring the preservation of that network.

At the religious level, they were symbolic of the sun and promoted the worship of Inti, who was regarded as their ancestral father, and organized the calendar. At the political level, they sent inspectors to oversee the loyalty and efficiency of civil servants and collect tribute from the subjugated peoples. The emperors promoted a unified and decentralized government in which Cuzco acted as the articulating axis of the different regions or &quot;suyu&quot;. They appointed highly trusted governors. At the economic level, they decided how much each province should pay according to its resources. They knew how to win over the kuraka to ensure control of the communities. These were the intermediaries through whom they collected taxes.

Traditionally, every time an emperor died or resigned, his successor was disinherited from his father&#x27;s inheritance and formed his own lineage royal clan or panaka, his father&#x27;s lands, houses and servants were passed to his other children remaining on the previous panaka. The new Sapa Inca had to obtain land and spoils to bequeath to his own descendants. Each time they subdued a people, they demanded that the defeated leader surrender part of their land to continue in command, and whose people pay tribute in the form of labor (mit&#x27;a) and taxes.

The Sapa Inca also played a major role in caring for the poor and hungry, hence his other title &quot;huacchacoya&quot; or &quot;waqcha khuyaq&quot; &quot;lover and benefactor of the poor&quot;. The Sapa was responsible for organizing food redistribution in times of environmental disaster, allocated work via state-sponsored projects, and most notably promoted major state-sponsored religious feasts that followed each successful harvest season.

==Distinction symbols==
The Inca was divinized both in their actions and their emblems. In public he carried the &quot;topayauri&quot; (&quot;scepter&quot;), &quot;ushno&quot; (golden throne), &quot;suntur páucar&quot; (feathered pike), and the &quot;mascapaicha&quot; (royal insignia) commonly carried in a &quot;llauto&quot; (headband), otherwise, the &quot;mascapaicha&quot; could also be carried on an &quot;amachana chuku&quot; (military helmet). In religious ceremonies he was accompanied by the sacred white flame, the napa, covered with a red blanket and adorned with gold earrings. With textiles representing a form of status and wealth, it has been speculated that the Sapa Inca never wore the same clothes twice. The community even revered the Sapa after his death, mummifying him and frequently visiting his tomb to &quot;consult&quot; him on pressing affairs.

==Pre-Conquest Sapa Incas==

===First dynasty===
Little is known of the rulers of the first dynasty of Sapa Incas. Evidently, they were affiliated with the Hurin moiety and their rule did not extend beyond the Kingdom of Cusco. Their origins are tied to the mythical establishment of Cusco and are shrouded in the later foundation myth. The dynasty was supposedly founded by Manco Cápac, who is considered the son of the Sun god Inti in Inca mythology.

As a rough guide to the later reputation of the early Sapa Incas, in later years &quot;capac&quot; meant warlord and &quot;sinchi&quot; meant leader.

===Second dynasty===
The second dynasty was affiliated with the Hanan moiety and was founded under Inca Roca, the son of the last Hurin Sapa Inca, Cápac Yupanqui. After Cápac Yupanqui&#x27;s death, another of his sons, Inca Roca&#x27;s half-brother Quispe Yupanqui, was intended to succeed him. However, the Hanan revolted and installed Inca Roca instead.

Ninan Cuyochi, who was Inca for only a few days in 1527, is sometimes left off the list of Sapa Incas because news of his death from smallpox arrived in Cusco very shortly after he was declared Sapa Inca. He had witnessed the death of his father Huayna Cápac. The death of Ninan, the presumed heir, led to the Inca Civil War between Huáscar and Atahualpa, a weakness that the conquistadors exploited when they conquered the Inca Empire.

==Post-Conquest Sapa Incas==
This last Sapa Inca must not be confused with Túpac Amaru II, who was leader of an 18th-century Peruvian uprising.

<text>Tsongkhapa (Tibetan: ཙོང་ཁ་པ་, &quot;,&quot; meaning: &quot;the man from Tsongkha&quot; or &quot;the Man from Onion Valley&quot;, c. 1357–1419) was an influential Tibetan Buddhist monk, philosopher and tantric yogi, whose activities led to the formation of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. 

His philosophical works are a grand synthesis of the Buddhist epistemological tradition of Dignāga and Dharmakīrti, the Cittamatra philosophy of the mind, and the madhyamaka philosophy of Nāgārjuna and Candrakīrti.

Central to his philosophical and soteriological teachings is &quot;a radical view of emptiness&quot; which sees all phenomena as devoid of intrinsic nature. This view of emptiness is not a kind of nihilism or a total denial of existence. Instead, it sees phenomena as existing &quot;interdependently, relationally, non-essentially, conventionally&quot; (which Tsongkhapa terms &quot;mere existence&quot;).

Tsongkhapa emphasized the importance of philosophical reasoning in the path to liberation. According to Tsongkhapa, meditation must be paired with rigorous reasoning in order &quot;to push the mind and precipitate a breakthrough in cognitive fluency and insight.&quot;

==Names==
He is also known by his ordained name Losang Drakpa (, Skt. Sumatikīrti) or simply as &quot;Je Rinpoche&quot; (, &quot;Precious Lord&quot;). He is also known by Chinese as Zongkapa Lobsang Zhaba or just Zōngkābā (宗喀巴).

==Biography==
=== Early years and studies ===
With a Mongolian father and a Tibetan mother, Tsongkhapa was born into a nomadic family in the walled city of Tsongkha in Amdo, Tibet (present-day Haidong and Xining, Qinghai) in 1357. Tsongkhapa was educated in Buddhism from an early age by his first teacher, the Kadam monk Choje Dondrub Rinchen. Tsongkhapa became a novice monk at the age of six.

When he was sixteen, Tsongkhapa traveled to Central Tibet (Ü-Tsang), where he studied at the scholastic institutions of the Sangphu monastery, the Drikung Kagyu and the Sakya tradition of Sakya paṇḍita (1182–1251). At the Drikung Thil Monastery he studied under Chenga Chokyi Gyalpo, the great patriarch of Drikung Kagyu, and received teachings on numerous topics like Mahamudra and the Six Dharmas of Naropa. Tsongkhapa also studied Tibetan medicine, followed by all major Buddhist scholastic subjects including abhidharma, ethics, epistemology (Sk. &quot;pramāṇa&quot;), Vajrayana and various lineages of Buddhist tantra.

Tsongkhapa studied widely under numerous teachers from various Tibetan Buddhist traditions. His main teachers include: the Sakya masters Rendawa and Rinchen Dorje, the Kagyu master Chenga Rinpoche and the Jonang masters Bodong Chakleh Namgyal, Khyungpo Hlehpa and Chokyi Pelpa. Tsongkhapa also received the three main Kadampa lineages. He received the Lam-Rim lineage, the oral guideline lineage from the Nyingma Lama, Lhodrag Namka-gyeltsen, and lineage of textual transmission from Lama Umapa.

Rendawa Zhönnu Lodrö was Tsongkhapa&#x27;s most important teacher. Under Rendawa, Tsongkhapa studied various classic works, including the &quot;Pramanavarttika&quot;, the &quot;Abhidharmakosha&quot;, the &quot;Abhidharmasamuccaya&quot; and the &quot;Madhyamakavatara&quot;. Tsongkhapa also studied with a Nyingma teacher, Drupchen Lekyi Dorje (), also known as Namkha Gyaltsen (, 1326–1401).

During his early years, Tsongkhapa also composed a few original works, including the &quot;Golden Garland&quot; (), a commentary on the &quot;Abhisamayālaṃkāra&quot; from the perspective of the Yogācāra-svātantrika-madhyamaka tradition of Śāntarakṣita which also attempts to refute the shentong views of Dolpopa (1292–1361).

=== Retreats and visions of Mañjuśrī ===

From 1390 to 1398, Tsongkhapa engaged in extended meditation retreats with a small group of attendants in various locations, the most well known of which is in the Wölkha Valley. He also developed a close relationship with a mystic and hermit named Umapa Pawo Dorje, known for his connection to Mañjuśrī bodhisattva and his frequent visions of black Mañjuśrī, with whom he would communicate. Umapa acted as a medium for Tsongkhapa, who eventually began having his own visions of Mañjuśrī.

During this period of extensive meditation retreat, Tsongkhapa had numerous visions of guru Mañjuśrī (&quot;Jamyang Lama&quot;). During these visions he would receive teachings from the bodhisattva and ask questions about the right view of emptiness and Buddhist practice. An important instruction Tsongkhapa is said to have received about the view from Mañjuśrī is: &quot;It is inappropriate to be partial either to emptiness or to appearance. In particular, you need to take the appearance aspect seriously.&quot; Tsongkhapa would also discuss these visions and instructions with his teacher Rendawa (and some record of this correspondence has survived). During this period, Tsongkhapa is also said to have received a series of oral transmissions from Mañjuśrī. These later came to be called the Mañjuśrī cycle of teachings.

In 1397, while in intensive meditation retreat at Wölkha Valley, Tsongkhapa writes that he had a “major insight” (&quot;ngeshé chenpo&quot;) into the view of emptiness. Initially, Tsongkhapa had a dream of the great madhyamaka masters: Nagarjuna, Buddhapalita, Aryadeva, and Candrakirti. In this dream, Buddhapālita placed a wrapped text on the top of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s head. After waking from this dream, Tsongkhapa began to study Buddhapālita&#x27;s commentary to Nagarjuna&#x27;s Middle Way Verses. As he was reading chapter 18, his understanding became crystal clear and all his doubts vanished. According to Thupten Jinpa, &quot;at the heart of Tsongkhapa’s breakthrough experience was a profound realization of the equation of emptiness and dependent origination.&quot; He then spent the next spring and summer in deep meditation, experiencing great bliss, devotion, and gratitude to the Buddha.

=== Mature Period ===

In the later period of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s life, he composed a series of works on Buddhist philosophy and practice. His most famous work is the &quot;Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path&quot; (&quot;Lam rim chen mo,&quot; c. 1402). This &quot;lamrim&quot; (&#x27;stages of the path&#x27;) text outlines the Mahayana path to enlightenment and also presents Tsongkhapa&#x27;s view of emptiness and the middle way view (Madhyamaka). In 1405, he finished his &quot;Great Exposition of Tantra&quot; (&quot;Sngags rim chen mo&quot;).

Tsongkhapa also wrote other major works during this period, including &quot;Essence of Eloquence&quot; (&quot;Legs bshad snying po&quot;), &quot;Ocean of Reasoning&quot; (&quot;Rigs pa&#x27;i rgya mtsho,&quot; a commentary on Nagarjuna&#x27;s classic &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;), the &quot;Medium-Length Lamrim&quot;, and &quot;Elucidation of the Intent&quot; (&quot;dGongs pa rab gsal&quot;), his last major writing.

According to Garfield:the major philosophical texts composed in the remaining twenty years of his life develop with great precision and sophistication the view he developed during this long retreat period and reflect his realization that while Madhyamaka philosophy involves a relentlessly negative dialectic — a sustained critique both of reification and of nihilism and a rejection of all concepts of essence—the other side of that dialectic is an affirmation of conventional reality, of dependent origination, and of the identity of the two truths, suggesting a positive view of the nature of reality as well.

In 1409, Tsongkhapa worked on a project to renovate the Jokhang Temple, the main temple in Lhasa. He also established a 15-day prayer festival, known as the Great Prayer Festival, at Jokhang to celebrate Sakyamuni Buddha. In 1409, Tsongkhapa also worked to found Ganden monastery, located 25 miles north of Lhasa. Two of his students, Tashi Palden (1379–1449) and Shakya Yeshey (1354–1435) respectively founded Drepung monastery (1416), and Sera Monastery (1419). Together with Ganden, these three would later become the most influential &quot;Gelug&quot; monasteries in Tibet and also the largest monasteries in the world. These institutions became the center of a new growing school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Ganden or Gelug sect.

=== Death and legacy ===

In 1419, Tsongkhapa died at the age of 62 in Ganden Monastery. At the time of his death, he was a well-known figure in Tibet with a large following. Jinpa notes that various sources from other Tibetan Buddhist schools, like Pawo Tsuklak Trengwa and Shākya Chokden, both write about how large numbers of Tibetans flocked to Tsongkhapa&#x27;s new Gelug tradition during the 15th century. Tsongkhapa&#x27;s three principal disciples were Khedrup Gelek Palsang, Gyaltsap Darma Rinchen, and Dülzin Drakpa Gyaltsen. According to Jinpa, other important students of Tsongkhapa were &quot;Tokden Jampel Gyatso; Jamyang Chöjé and Jamchen Chöjé, the founders of Drepung and Sera monasteries, respectively; and the First Dalai Lama, Gendün Drup.&quot;

After Tsongkhapa&#x27;s death, his disciples worked to spread his teachings and the Gelug school grew rapidly across the Tibetan plateau, founding or converting numerous monasteries. The new Gelug tradition saw itself as a descendant of the Kadam school and emphasized monastic discipline and rigorous study of the Buddhist classics. According to Jinpa, by the end of the fifteenth century, the &quot;new Ganden tradition had spread through the entire Tibetan cultural area, with monasteries upholding the tradition located in western Tibet, in Tsang, in central and southern Tibet, and in Kham and Amdo in the east.&quot;

After his death, Tsongkhapa&#x27;s works were also published in woodblock prints, making them much more accessible. Several biographies and hagiographies of Tsongkhapa were also written by Lamas of different traditions. Tsongkhapa was also held in high regard by key figures of other Tibetan Buddhist traditions. Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa, in a poem called &quot;In Praise of the Incomparable Tsong Khapa,&quot; calls Tsongkhapa &quot;the reformer of Buddha’s doctrine&quot;, &quot;the great charioteer of Madhyamaka philosophy in Tibet&quot;, &quot;supreme among those who propound emptiness&quot;, and &quot;one who had helped spread robe-wearing monastics across Tibet and from China to Kashmir&quot;. Wangchuk Dorje, 9th Karmapa Lama, praised Tsongkhapa as one &quot;who swept away wrong views with the correct and perfect ones&quot;.

Tsongkhapa&#x27;s works and teachings became central for the Ganden or Gelug school, where he is seen as a major authoritative figure. Their interpretation and exegesis became a major focus of Gelug scholasticism. They were also very influential on later Tibetan philosophers, who would either defend or criticize Tsongkhapa&#x27;s views on numerous points.

Tsongkhapa&#x27;s madhyamaka thought has become widely influential in the western scholarly understanding of madhyamaka, with the majority of books and articles (beginning in the 1980s) initially being based on Gelug explanations.

=== Hagiography ===
After his death, Tsongkhapa came to be seen as a second Buddha in the Gelug tradition. Numerous hagiographies were written by Gelug figures such as Khedrup Je and Tokden Jampel Gyatso. These texts developed the great myths of Tsongkhapa, included stories of his previous births. Over time, an extensive collection of myths and stories about Tsongkhapa accumulated.

According to these myths, Tsongkhapa had been a student of Mañjuśrī for numerous past lives. In a former life, he aspired to spread Vajrayāna and the perfect view of emptiness in front of the Buddha Indraketu. Tsongkhapa then received a prophecy from numerous Buddhas which said that he would become the tathāgata Siṁhasvara (Lion&#x27;s Roar). Another story recounts that during Śākyamuni&#x27;s life, Tsongkhapa, in the form of a Brahmin boy, offered the Buddha a crystal rosary and generated bodhicitta. The Buddha prophesied that the boy would one day be the reviver of the Buddha&#x27;s doctrine. Hagiographies such as Khedrup Je&#x27;s also depict how Tsongkhapa achieved full Buddhahood after his death. Some hagiographical sources also claim that Tsongkhapa was an emanation of Mañjuśrī as well as a reincarnation of Nāgārjuna, Atiśa and Padmasambhava.

==Philosophy==

Tsongkhapa&#x27;s philosophy is mainly based on that of Indian madhyamaka philosophers like Nagarjuna, Buddhapalita and Chandrakirti. Tsongkhapa also draws on the epistemological tradition of Dharmakirti in his explanation of conventional truth. According to Jay Garfield, Tsongkhapa&#x27;s philosophy is based on the idea that &quot;a complete understanding of Buddhist philosophy requires a synthesis of the epistemology and logic of Dharmakirti with the metaphysics of Nagarjuna.&quot; According to Thomas Doctor, Tsongkhapa&#x27;s madhyamaka views were also influenced by the 12th-century Kadam school madhyamaka Mabja Changchub Tsöndrü (d. 1185).

Tsongkhapa is also known for his emphasis on the importance of philosophical reasoning on the path to liberation. According to Tsongkhapa, meditation must be paired with rigorous reasoning in order &quot;to push the mind and precipitate a breakthrough in cognitive fluency and insight.&quot;

According to Thupten Jinpa, Tsongkhapa&#x27;s thought was concerned with three main misinterpretations of madhyamaka philosophy in Tibet:

* a nihilistic or overly skeptical reading of the prasangika-madhyamaka which denigrates or undermines the everyday world of experience and the validity of epistemology (Patsab is one figure who Tsongkhapa sees as associated with this view).
* the so-called &quot;shentong madhyamaka&quot; view of the Jonang school and its founder Dolpopa, which Tsongkhapa sees as absolutist and essentialist.
* a view which held that conceptual analysis and correct views were unnecessary and that what mattered was to get rid of all thought or to get rid of all concepts or to just remain in single pointed concentration (as thoughts arise and pass). Tsongkhapa saw these ideas as being associated with the Chinese Chan figure of Heshang and some Tibetan Buddhists. He held that these quietist views (which reject study and conceptual analysis) were soteriological dead-ends and could have negative ethical consequences.

According to Thupten Jinpa, one of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s main concerns was &quot;to delineate the parameters of Madhyamaka reasoning in such a way that Madhyamaka dialectics cannot be seen to negate the objects of everyday experience and, more importantly, ethics and religious activity&quot; or as Tsongkhapa put it, one must &quot;correctly identify the object of negation&quot; (which is &quot;svabhava&quot;). Tsongkhapa held that if one did not properly understand what is to be negated in madhyamaka, one was at risk of either negating too much (nihilism) or negating too little (essentialism), and thus one would &quot;miss the mark&quot; of madhyamaka. According to Jinpa, the correct object of negation for Tsongkhapa is &quot;our innate apprehension of self-existence&quot; which refers to how even our normal ways of perceiving the world &quot;are effected by a belief in some kind of intrinsic existence of things and events&quot;. Jinpa also writes that the second major aspect of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s philosophical project &quot;entails developing a systematic theory of reality in the aftermath of an absolute rejection of intrinsic existence&quot;.

=== View of ultimate truth and emptiness ===
Tsongkhapa follows Nagarjuna and Candrakirti in asserting that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence or essence (&quot;svabhava&quot;) because they are dependently originated. For Tsongkhapa, all phenomena lack inherent existence and come into existence relative to a designating consciousness which co-arises with that phenomenon.

Tsongkhapa saw emptiness (&quot;shūnyatā&quot;) of intrinsic nature as a consequence of &quot;pratītyasamutpāda&quot; (dependent arising), the teaching that no &quot;dharma&quot; (&quot;thing&quot;, &quot;phenomena&quot;) has an existence of its own, but always comes into existence in dependence on other &quot;dharmas&quot;. According to Tsongkhapa, dependent-arising and emptiness are inseparable. Tsongkhapa&#x27;s view on &quot;ultimate reality&quot; is condensed in the short text &quot;In Praise of Dependent Arising&quot;, which states that phenomena &quot;do&quot; exist conventionally, but that, ultimately, everything is dependently arisen, and therefore void of inherent existence or intrinsic nature (&quot;svabhava&quot;), which is &quot;the object of negation&quot; or that which is to be disproved by madhyamaka reasoning. Tsongkhapa writes that &quot;since objects do not exist through their own nature, they are established as existing through the force of convention.&quot;

Furthermore, according to Tsongkhapa, emptiness is itself empty of inherent existence and thus only exists nominally and conventionally as dependent arising. There is thus no &quot;transcendental ground,&quot; and &quot;ultimate reality&quot; that has an existence of its own. Instead, emptiness is the negation of such a transcendental independent reality and an affirmation that all things exist interdependently (even emptiness itself). Emptiness is the ultimate truth (which applies to all possible phenomena, in all possible worlds), but it is not an ultimate phenomenon, thing or a primordial substance (which has always existed, is self-created, and is self-sustaining etc.) like Brahman. As such, the ultimate truth of emptiness for Tsongkhapa is a negational truth, a non-affirming negation. This ultimate reality is the mere absence of intrinsic nature in all things.

A non-affirming or non-implicative (&quot;prasajya&quot;) negation is a negation which does not leave something in the place of what has been negated. For instance, when one says that a Buddhist should not drink alcohol, they are not affirming that a Buddhist should, in fact, drink something else. According to Tsongkhapa, in negating inherent nature, a madhyamika is not affirming any thing or quality in its place (such as some ultimate void, absolute, or ground of being).

In his works, Tsongkhapa takes pains to refute an alternative interpretation of emptiness which was promoted by the Tibetan philosopher Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (1292–1361). This view (called &quot;shentong&quot;, &quot;empty of other&quot;) held that ultimate reality is not a non-affirming negation, and that it is only empty of conventional things and is not empty of itself. This view thus holds that ultimate reality has a kind of true existence as the ultimate and absolute ground of reality. According to Tsongkhapa, this view is absurd and is not found in the Buddhist scriptures.

=== The existence of the conventional ===
Tsongkhapa&#x27;s prāsaṅgika madhyamaka affirms the &quot;mere existence&quot; of dependent phenomena on the conventional level. As such, Tsongkhapa argues that conventional truths are true because there is a sense in which they &quot;exist&quot; (Tib. &quot;yod pa&quot;) in some real sense. For Tsongkhapa, this conventional existence means that phenomena (i.e. dharmas) &quot;only&quot; come into existence in a dependent and contingent way, which includes the fact that they arise co-dependently with the minds that perceive them and conceptually impute their existence. In this view, things &quot;do exist&quot; in a conventional and nominal sense as conceptual imputations (&quot;rtog pas btags tsam&quot;) which are dependent upon a relationship with a knowing and designating mind. However, all phenomena still lack existence in an independent, self-arising, or self-sustaining manner. That is to say, when one searches for the ultimate nature of any thing, &quot;what the thing really is&quot;, nothing can be found under this &quot;ultimate analysis&quot; and thus nothing can withstand ultimate analysis. Unlike other Tibetan madhyamikas, Tsongkhapa argues that this does not mean things do not exist at all or that ultimate analysis undermines conventional existence. Thus for Tsongkhapa, the conventional really is a kind of &quot;truth&quot;, a way of being real.

Tsongkhapa cites numerous passages from Nagarjuna which show that emptiness (the lack of intrinsic nature) and dependent origination (the fact that all dharmas arise based on causes and conditions) ultimately have the same intent and meaning and thus they are two ways of discussing one single reality. Tsongkhapa also cites various passages from Chandrakirti to show that even though phenomena do not arise intrinsically, they do arise conventionally. Chandrakirti is quoted by Tsongkhapa as stating &quot;even though all things are empty, from those empty things effects are definitely produced&quot;, &quot;because things are not produced causelessly, or from causes such as a divine creator, or from themselves, or from both self and other, they are produced dependently&quot;, and &quot;we contend that dependently produced things are, like reflections, not produced intrinsically.&quot;

He also cites a passage from Chandrakirti&#x27;s commentary to Aryadeva&#x27;s &quot;Four Hundred&quot; which states: &quot;Our analysis focuses only on those who search for the intrinsically real referent. What we are refuting here is that things [and events] are established by means of their own-being. We do not [however] negate [the existence of] eyes and so on, which are [causally] conditioned and are dependently originated in that they are the fruits of karma.&quot; In this way, Tsongkhapa argues that the madhyamaka idea that dharmas do not arise or are not found is to be qualified as meaning that they do not arise intrinsically or essentially. He also cites the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; where the Buddha says, &quot;Mahamati, thinking that they are not produced intrinsically, I said that all phenomena are not produced&quot;.

Because of this, Tsongkhapa holds that while conventional phenomena cannot withstand ultimate analysis (which searches for the true or ultimate nature of anything and is unable to find anything intrinsically), this does not mean that conventional phenomena are invalidated, undermined or negated by this ultimate analysis, since they still exist as dependent arisings. Indeed, for Tsongkhapa, it is &quot;because&quot; things are ultimately empty that they can be said to arise and exist at all. Some Tibetan madhyamikas hold that conventional truths are merely the relative conventions of simple everyday people, but that these conventions do not exist for advanced meditators or madhyamika philosophers. Tsongkhapa rejects this as &quot;a great philosophical error&quot; and affirms the pragmatic importance of conventional truths. For Tsongkhapa, the rejection of the dependent reality of the conventional undermines the very possibility of truth and falsehood, and of any epistemic authority and thus, it undermines all Buddhist teachings regarding bondage and liberation as well as undermining itself as a cogent argument. However, like Candrakīrti, Tsonkghapa also accepts that while conventional truths are truths, they also can obscure or veil the ultimate (since for most people, these truths appear as intrinsically true). This is like how a mirage is a real phenomenon, but can also be deceptive (since it appears to be what it is not)

Tsongkhapa also argues that ultimate analysis is not merely a philosophical or intellectual matter, instead it is supposed to negate a deep internal habit that sentient beings have which experiences the world in a false and distorted way. This superimposition is a &quot;pervasive sense that things are real and solid and exist just as they appear&quot; which we have become habituated and addicted to for countless lifetimes. This addiction is what is to be refuted and abandoned. It is &quot;not&quot; the idea of &quot;intrinsic existence&quot; as a philosophical concept (equivalent to a non-existent rabbit&#x27;s horn and thus trivial). Another way of saying this is that for Tsongkhapa, the most subtle object of negation is the perception that phenomena have &quot;their own way of existing without being posited through the force of consciousness&quot;. It is an ongoing mental process of imputing objectively independent reality and intrinsic existence to what is perceived.

Tsongkhapa&#x27;s view that a dependent and conventional reality is not negated by madhyamaka (and that it is just intrinsic nature that is negated) was a subject of much debate among Tibetan madhyamaka philosophers and became a subject of critique for Sakya school figures like Gorampa Sonam Senge (1429-1489). Sakya philosophers like Gorampa and his supporters held that madhyamaka analysis rejects &quot;all&quot; conventional phenomena (which he calls &quot;false appearances&quot; and sees as conceptually produced) and so, tables and persons are no more real than dreams or Santa Claus. Thus, for Gorampa (contra Tsongkhapa), conventional truth is &quot;entirely false&quot;, &quot;unreal&quot;, &quot;a kind of nonexistence&quot; and &quot;truth only from the perspective of fools.&quot; But for Tsongkhapa, the two truths (conventional and ultimate) are two facts about the same reality, or &quot;two aspects of one and the same world&quot; according to Thupten Jinpa. Thus for Tsongkhapa, to totally negate conventional truth (at the level of ultimate truth) would be to negate dependent origination (and so, it is to negate emptiness, the ultimate truth itself). Tsongkhapa sees this as a kind of nihilism.

=== Epistemology ===
Tsongkhapa held that a proper defense of madhyamaka required an understanding of pramāṇa (epistemology) on the conventional level and that furthermore, one could make epistemic distinctions about the conventional and know what is conventionally true and what is a falsehood. For example, one can know that a rope on the ground is not a snake (even if one has initially been fooled by it). For Tsongkhapa, it was not enough to just argue for the emptiness of all phenomena (the ultimate truth), madhyamaka also needed proper epistemic instruments or sources of knowledge (Tib. &quot;tshad ma&quot;, Skt. &quot;pramāṇa&quot;) to defend Buddhist views about conventional truths (such as Buddhist ethics) and to have a coherent sense of why something is true or false. As Jay Garfield notes, for Tsongkhapa &quot;without an antecedent account of these instruments and their authority, there is no way to distinguish conventional truth from conventional falsity.&quot; Furthermore, Thupten Jinpa writes that Tsongkhapa &quot;does not agree with those who claim that the use of the tetralemma in Madhyamaka implies a denial of fundamental logical principles such as the law of the excluded middle and the principle of contradiction&quot;.

In order to explain how conventional reality is perceived in a valid way, Tsongkhapa draw on Buddhist pramāṇa philosophy in order to develop his own Buddhist epistemological theory. From Tsongkhapa&#x27;s perspective, in order for something to exist (conventionally, since nothing exists ultimately), it must be validly designated by a non-impaired functioning consciousness. To talk about an object that does not exist in relation to a subject is incoherent. According to Tsongkhapa, something is validly designated (i.e. it exists conventionally and dependently) if it meets all of the following three conditions:
# The thing known (&quot;prameya&quot;) is known to a conventional unimpaired consciousness (whether this consciousness is analytical or not);
# No other conventional cognition contradicts that which is known from being known in that way;
# Reason that accurately analyzes whether something intrinsically exists does not contradict that which is known.

Whatever fails to meet those criteria does not exist at all (like a flat earth), and relationships between objects cannot exist without being validly designated into existence.

Thus, according to Tsongkhapa, when Candrakīrti states that “the world is not valid in any way”, he is referring to how ordinary worldly consciousnesses are not valid sources of knowledge with regard to ultimate reality. However, Tsongkhapa argues that Candrakīrti does accept pramāṇas conventionally, since he also states &quot;the world knows objects with four valid cognitions.&quot; As such, while Tsongkhapa reads Candrakīrti as not accepting that conventional sources of knowledge know the intrinsic nature of things (since there are none), he also argues that Candrakīrti affirms that pramāṇas can give us knowledge about conventional reality (even while our sense faculties are also deceptive, in that they also superimpose intrinsic nature).

For Tsongkhapa, there are two valid ways of understanding the world, two levels of explanation: one way which understands conventional phenomena (which are real but also deceptive, like a magic trick) and another way which sees the profound ultimate truth of things, which is the sheer fact that they lack intrinsic nature. As Newland explains, each one of these epistemic points of view provides a different lens or perspective on reality, which Tsongkhapa illustrates by discussing how &quot;we do not see sounds no matter how carefully we look.&quot; In the same way, while conventional truths are not found by an ultimate analysis that searches for their intrinsic nature, they are still functional conventionally and this is not discredited by the ultimate truth of emptiness. Tsongkhapa thinks that if we only relied on the ultimate epistemological point of view, we would not be able to distinguish between virtue from non-virtue, or enlightenment from samsara (since ultimate analysis only tells us that they are equally empty). Instead, Tsongkhapa holds that the emptiness must complement, rather than undermine, conventional Buddhist truths.

This is a different interpretation of Candrakīrti&#x27;s epistemic theory than that adopted by Tibetan figures like Gorampa and Taktsang Lotsawa, who argue that Candrakīrti&#x27;s prāsaṅgika mādhyamika rejects all epistemic sources of knowledge since all conventional cognitions are flawed.

=== The prāsaṅgika–svātantrika distinction ===

Like his teacher Rendawa, Tsongkhapa was a proponent of Candrakīrti&#x27;s interpretation of the madhyamaka philosophy (which he termed prāsaṅgika, &quot;consequentialist&quot;). According to Tsongkhapa, the prāsaṅgika-approach (which is based mainly on using reductio ad absurdum arguments) is the superior approach to madhyamaka. This is a position which, according to José Cabezón, may be traced back to 11th century figures like the Kashmiri scholar Jayananda and the Tibetan Patsab.

Tsongkhapa held that the alternative svātantrika approach to madhyamaka (defended by figures like Śāntarakṣita or Bhāviveka) was inferior. Tsongkhapa argued that the svātantrika approach holds that one had to posit autonomous syllogisms (&quot;svatantrānumāna&quot;) in order to defend madhyamaka and that this insistence implies that phenomena (&quot;dharmas&quot;) or at least logic itself, has intrinsic nature (&quot;svabhava&quot;) conventionally. Bhāviveka (the main target of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s critique) does not actually affirm the existence of intrinsic natures conventionally or that conventional reality is &quot;established with its own identity,&quot; in any of his texts, and Tsongkhapa&#x27;s interpretation of the implications of Bhāviveka&#x27;s thought is a topic of much debate among Tibetan and modern western authors on madhyamaka.

Regarding autonomous syllogistic arguments, Tsongkhapa (like Candrakirti) argues that they are not always necessary and that &quot;prāsaṅga&quot; arguments (i.e. reductios) are often enough to prove the madhyamaka view of emptiness by &quot;demonstrating the unwelcome consequences (in any given position that presupposes intrinsic existence).&quot; Tsongkhapa does not reject that madhyamikas can make use of autonomous syllogisms, but he disagrees with Bhāviveka&#x27;s insistence that they &quot;must&quot; use them. According to Jinpa, Tsongkhapa here is critiquing what contemporary philosophy would call &quot;the autonomy of reason&quot;, &quot;that is, that reason, or logic, possesses its own ontological status as an independent, ultimate reality&quot;.

For Tsongkhapa, these key differences reveal that the understanding of emptiness of the svātantrika philosophers is inferior to the prāsaṅgikas, since the svātantrika insistence on the use of autonomous syllogisms implies that they accept intrinsic nature conventionally (and since they think their syllogisms are established on this basis, they hold that their conclusions are certain). Tsongkhapa strongly rejects that either phenomenon or reasoning have intrinsic natures or characteristics in any way. Instead, Tsongkhapa holds that all phenomena are dependent and &quot;simply labeled by thought construction&quot; (Tib. &quot;rtog pas btags tsam&quot;) and thus they are empty of intrinsic nature &quot;even conventionally&quot;. While Tsongkhapa holds that the insistence on the use of syllogisms (and the idea that they provide certainty) reveals a shortcoming in the thought of svātantrika, nevertheless, he thinks that prāsaṅgikas may make use of syllogistic arguments, as long as they do not rely on (conventional) intrinsic characteristics when making use of these syllogisms.

=== Prāsaṅgikas have a thesis ===
Tsongkhapa also argues that prāsaṅgikas do not just reject all theses or views. Instead, Tsongkhapa holds that while prāsaṅgikas focus on refuting those views which presuppose or posit intrinsic natures (&quot;svabhava&quot;), they &quot;do&quot; have a thesis (Skt. &quot;darśana,&quot; Tib. &quot;lta ba&quot;) of their own. This is the view that all phenomena lack intrinsic nature (&quot;niḥsvabhāvavāda&quot;), which is not a dogmatic or false view (&quot;dṛṣṭi&quot;) to be rejected, but is the rare and correct understanding of emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;-&quot;darśana&quot;) and dependent origination which allows us to be liberated. Tsongkhapa thus affirms that prāsaṅgikas may use syllogisms, make positive assertions, hold positions (which they consider to be true) and argue for them. Tsongkhapa also distinguishes between two closely related (and overlapping) but also distinct senses of the term &quot;ultimate&quot; (Skt. &quot;paramārtha&quot;): (1) a &quot;substantially real mode of being&quot; (i.e. intrinsic nature) and (2) the ultimate truth or fact about the world (as opposed to the conventional truths), which is emptiness. It is due to this distinction that Tsongkhapa is able to state that even though nothing is ultimate in the first sense, madhyamakas do hold a thesis, mainly that emptiness (in the second sense) is a true fact about reality.

While some Tibetan thinkers argued that Nagarjuna&#x27;s refutation of existence, non-existence, both or neither (called the &quot;catuṣkoṭi,&quot; &quot;four corners&quot;) meant that he rejected all philosophical views (and all existence) completely, Tsongkhapa disagrees with this interpretation. Instead, Tsongkhapa understands Nagarjuna&#x27;s negation of the &quot;catuṣkoṭi&quot; to refer to the lack of intrinsic existence, intrinsic non-existence etc. Thus, as Guy Newland explains, Tsongkhapa interprets the negation of the &quot;catuṣkoṭi&quot; to mean that &quot;we refute the reifying view that things exist ultimately; we refute the nihilistic view that things do not exist even conventionally; we refute that there is any single sense in which things both exist and do not exist; we refute that there is any single sense in which things neither exist nor do not exist.&quot; As Thupten Jinpa notes, this interpretation of the negative &quot;catuṣkoṭi&quot; is based on Tsongkhapa&#x27;s view that the Sanskrit term &quot;bhāva&quot; (existence) has a dual meaning in madhyamaka: one refers to a reified sense of intrinsic existence (which is to be negated) and a conventionally existent actuality, functional thing or event (which is not negated). Jinpa notes that Tsongkhapa interprets the madhyamaka argument called &#x27;diamond splinters&#x27; (&quot;rdo rje gzegs ma&quot;), which refutes the intrinsic arising of dharmas, in a similar manner.

This is also why Tsongkhapa holds that reasoning about means of knowledge or epistemological tools (Skt. &quot;pramāṇa&quot;) is central to the madhyamaka project, since he thinks that prāsaṅgika-madhyamikas make use of reasoning in order to establish their view of the lack of intrinsic nature conventionally. However, this reasoning derives its efficacy through dependent origination, not through some intrinsic nature or power (whether conventional or otherwise).

===Eight difficult points of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s madhyamaka===
The unique aspects of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s prāsaṅgika madhyamaka philosophy are also often outlined through the &quot;eight difficult points&quot; (&quot;dka&#x27; gnad brgyad&quot;), which were set by Tsongkhapa in a series of lecture notes which were later edited by his disciple Gyaltsap Je.

According to Tsongkhapa and Gyaltsap, three of these main ideas relate to ontology and are:

* prāsaṅgika rejects intrinsic characteristics (&quot;sva-lakṣaṇa&quot;) or intrinsic nature (&quot;svabhāva&quot;), ultimately and conventionally.
* the rejection the storehouse consciousness (&quot;ālāyavijñāna&quot;), ultimately and conventionally.
* the conventional acceptance of external objects (outside the mind), contra Yogacara idealism.
Four other key points of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s madhyamaka concern the path to enlightenment and are:
* the nonacceptance of autonomous syllogisms or independent proofs (&quot;rang rgyud&quot;, &quot;svatantra&quot;) as being a means for developing arguments or establishing the truth. Instead, Tsongkhapa&#x27;s madhyamaka uses a &quot;presupposition or reason which is well known by opponents&quot; (&quot;gzhan grags&quot;, &quot;paraprasiddha&quot;) in order to illustrate the errors in the views of one&#x27;s opponents.
* the rejection of self-awareness (Sk. &quot;sva-saṃvitti&quot;, &quot;sva-saṃvedana&quot;), even conventionally. Tsongkhapa thinks that to posit a consciousness that can operate on itself introduces a kind of essentialism. Like Shantideva, he also argues that this idea is logically incoherent. Following Shantideva, Tsongkhapa cites the &quot;Lankavatara&quot; which says &quot;just as the blade of a sword cannot cut itself, and just as a fingernail cannot touch itself, so too is it true of one&#x27;s mind.&quot;
* the way in which the two obscurations exist.
* the acceptance that the disciples and solitary Buddhas realize the emptiness of phenomena. This means that for Tsongkhapa, hīnayāna arhats also realize the same emptiness that Mahayanists realize, since both the emptiness of persons and the emptiness of phenomena are intertwined and one logically entails the other.

One final point concerns the result or fruit (of the path) i.e. Buddhahood. For Tsongkhapa, fully awakened Buddhas &quot;do&quot; perceive all of conventional reality in their fullest extent (even impure things).

Regarding the storehouse consciousness (&quot;ālāyavijñāna&quot;), Tsongkhapa holds that this theory is rejected by the ultimate view of prāsaṅgika madhyamaka. However, he agrees that this teaching may be of provisional use for some individuals (since it was taught by the Buddha in some sutras) who hold to a lower view, are not able to fully understand emptiness and have a &quot;fear of annihilation&quot;. Tsongkhapa relies on Chandrakirti&#x27;s refutation of the storehouse consciousness, particularly in &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra&quot; VI, 39.

Tsongkhapa also presents an alternative view of explaining personal identity, rebirth and karma. These are explained through a &quot;mere I&quot; (&quot;nga tsam&quot;) that is dependently designated on the basis of the five aggregates. Tsongkhapa states that &quot;we should maintain that the object of our innate I-consciousness is the mere person – i.e., the mere I - which is the focus of our natural sense of self&quot;. This conventional and dependent sense of self or I-consciousness is a pre-linguistic and pre-conceptual instinctive process. When rebirth occurs, an individual&#x27;s mental continuum (&quot;rgyun&quot;) moves from one life to another, just like a river or stream moves along. The continuum&#x27;s &quot;mere I&quot; carries the past life karmic imprints to the next life and there is thus no need to posit a separate kind of &quot;storehouse&quot; consciousness for karmic imprints.

Tsongkhapa also rejects Buddhist idealism (which was associated with the Yogācāra school and various Tibetan madhyamaka authors) and thus affirms the conventional existence of an external world (like Bhaviveka). As Newland writes, Tsongkhapa&#x27;s madhyamaka &quot;does assert that there is a fully functioning external world, a world that exists outside of our minds. However, in the same breath it emphasizes that this external world is utterly dependent upon consciousness.&quot; In his rejection of Yogācāra idealism, Tsongkhapa follows Chandrakirti&#x27;s refutation of Yogacara in the &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra&quot;.

=== Hermeneutics ===
Tsongkhapa also wrote on Buddhist hermeneutics, which is a major subject of his &quot;Essence of Eloquence.&quot; Tsongkhapa held that it was important to have a proper understanding of hermeneutics in order to properly interpret the many seemingly contradictory statements found in the Buddhist sutras and scholastic treatises. According to Tsongkhapa, the main criteria for interpreting the various statements attributed to the Buddha is human reason (Sk. &quot;yukti&quot;, Tib. &quot;rigs pa&quot;), particularly the kind of reasoning which analyzes phenomena to find their ultimate nature (which is emptiness, the lack of intrinsic nature itself). Furthermore, Tsongkhapa relies on the &quot;Teachings of Akshayamati Sutra&quot; (Skt. &quot;Akṣayamatinirdeśa&quot;; Wyl. &quot;blo gros mi zad pas bstan pa&quot;) which states that the sutras of definitive meaning are those sutras which teach emptiness (such as the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot; sutras).

Because of this, for Tsongkhapa, all statements and passages in the various sutras or treatises which do not express this lack of intrinsic nature are not definitive or ultimate statements (Skt. &quot;nitartha&quot;) and are thus statements which &quot;require further interpretation&quot; or &quot;need to be fully drawn out&quot; (&quot;neyartha&quot;). This includes all texts belonging to the &quot;Śrāvaka&quot; schools, all Yogācāra works as well as non-prāsaṅgika madhyamaka philosophy (like Bhāviveka and Śāntarakṣita). This also includes all sutras and statements regarding the important concept of &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; (i.e. Buddha-nature) or the luminous mind, which for Tsongkhapa, are just an expedient way of describing the emptiness of the mind and its defilements, as well as the potential for Buddhahood which all beings have. In this he follows Indian madhyamikas like Bhaviveka and Candrakirti as well as Kadam scholars such as Ngog Loden Sherab and Chaba Chokyi Senge.

For Tsongkhapa, only the madhyamaka view of Nagarjuna (as understood by prāsaṅgikas like Aryadeva, Buddhapalita, Candrakīrti and Shantideva) is a definitive interpretation of the final intent of the Buddha. However, because of the Buddha&#x27;s bodhicitta, he explains the teaching in a wide variety of (&quot;neyartha&quot;) ways, all of which are ultimately based in and lead to the final insight into emptiness.

=== Critiques against Tsongkhapa ===
According to Thupten Jinpa, the main critics of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s thought were Sakya scholars. The first Sakya scholar to openly critique Tsongkhapa was Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen (1367-1449) and his critiques were met by responses written by Khedrup Je. The philosophical critique of Tsongkhapa was later continued by a trio of Sakya school thinkers: Taktsang Lotsawa, Gorampa, and Shākya Chokden, all followers of Rongton.

According to Jinpa, Taktsang&#x27;s critique focuses on &quot;Tsongkhapa&#x27;s insistence on the need to maintain a robust notion of conventional truth grounded in some verifiable criteria of validity&quot;. For Taktsang, epistemology is faulty and thus Tsongkhapa&#x27;s attempt at a synthesis of madhyamaka and pramana leads to serious problems. Gorampa meanwhile argued that Tsongkhapa&#x27;s definition of emptiness as an absolute negation of intrinsic existence was a form of nihilism. He also took issue with Tsongkhapa&#x27;s characterization of conventional truth as a kind of existence.

Later Kagyu figures also penned critiques of some of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s views, such as Mikyö Dorje. Gelug scholars like Lekpa Chöjor (a.k.a. Jamyang Galo, 1429–1503), the first Panchen Lama, Lozang Chökyi Gyaltsen (1507–1662), Jetsun Chökyi Gyaltsen (1469–1544/46), Sera Jetsun Chökyi Gyaltsen, Panchen Delek Nyima and Jamyang Zhepa (1648–1751) penned various responses to these various critiques in defense of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s views.

== Teachings on Buddhist practice ==
=== Mahayana Sutra Teachings ===
Tsongkhapa was acquainted with all Tibetan Buddhist traditions of his time, and received teachings and transmission in all major Sarma schools of Tibetan Buddhism. His main source of inspiration was the Kadam school of Atiśa (982–1054), especially the Kadampa Lamrim (&quot;Stages of the Path&quot;) teachings. Another important source for Tsongkhapa are the works of Asanga, including the &quot;Yogacarabhumi&quot; and &quot;Abhidharma-samuccaya&quot;. He also draws on Kamalashila&#x27;s &quot;Stages of Meditation&quot; and on Shantideva&#x27;s works.

The most popular source for Tsongkhapa&#x27;s teachings on the Mahayana sutra path is his &quot;Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment&quot; (&quot;Lamrim Chenmo&quot;). He also wrote a Middle Length Lamrim Treatise and a Small Lamrim Treatise. Tsongkhapa&#x27;s presentation generally follows the classic Kadam Lamrim system, which is divided into three main scopes or motivations (modest, medium and higher i.e. Mahayana).

Tsongkhapa&#x27;s presentation of the Mahayana bodhisattva path focuses on the six perfections. Regarding the perfection of wisdom (&quot;prajñāpāramitā&quot;), Tsongkhapa emphasizes the importance of reasoning, analytical investigation as well as the close study and contemplation of the Buddhist scriptures. Indeed, according to Tsongkhapa, the broad study of the Buddhist texts is the “sacred life force of the path,” which is a necessary complement to the practice of meditation.

==== Insight meditation and the object of negation ====
For Tsongkhapa, all Buddhist forms of meditation can fall into two broad categories which must be balanced and fully developed together: calming meditation (&quot;śamatha&quot;), which are &quot;meditations that engage and strengthen our capacity to focus and to stabilize the mind without distraction—culminating in perfect serenity&quot; and insight meditations which &quot;use and develop the capacity to discern and to analyze the qualities of an object—culminating in meditative wisdom&quot;.

In his Lamrim works, Tsongkhapa presents a unique way of mediation for the development of insight (Skt. &quot;vipaśyanā&quot;, Tib. &quot;lhag mthong&quot;). As Newland explains, for Tsongkhapa, the root of suffering and samsara is an &quot;innate tendency to hold a distorted, reifying view of ourselves&quot; (as well as of other phenomena). To develop the wisdom to see through this habit requires using reasoned analysis or analytical investigation (&quot;so sor rtog pa&quot;) to arrive at the right view of emptiness (the lack of intrinsic nature). Establishing the correct view of emptiness initially requires us to &#x27;identify the object of negation&#x27;, which according to Tsongkhapa (quoting Chandrakirti) is &quot;a consciousness that superimposes an essence of things&quot;. If we do not do this correctly, we may end up either negating too much (which could lead nihilism, with negative consequences for our ethics) or negating too little (and thus leaving some subtle sense of reification untouched). Thus, for Tsongkhapa, we first need to properly identify and understand our own inner sense of reification. It is only after we have identified this in ourselves that we can refute and eliminate this error through introspective analysis, contemplation and meditation.

At the same time, we also must avoid the trap of a nihilistic view that invalidates the dependently arisen nature of things (i.e. mere existence or seeming reality) and confuses the lack of intrinsic nature with totally negating the existence of a relative and conventional self. This is because, for Tsongkhapa, the &quot;I&quot; or self is accepted as nominally existing in a dependent and conventional way, while the object to be negated is the inner fiction of intrinsic nature which is &quot;erroneously reified&quot; by our cognition. Tsongkhapa explains this mistaken inner reification which is to be negated as &quot;a natural belief [a naive, normal, pre-philosophical way of seeing the world], which leads us to perceive things and events as possessing some kind of intrinsic existence and identity&quot;.

The process of refuting the intrinsic existence of the self is described in chapter 23 of &quot;Lamrim Chenmo&quot; vol. 3, and entails four steps: 
* The refutation of the position that the self is one with the aggregates;
* The refutation of the position that the self is different from the aggregates;
* How those arguments also refute each of the remaining positions;
* How the person appears like an illusion based on that refutation.

According to Tsongkhapa, Buddhist essentialists (like Vaibhasikas) and non-Buddhist essentialists (atmavadins) are not negating the correct object, but are only negating &quot;imaginary constructs&quot; and &quot;acquired ignorance&quot; and thus they only realize a coarse selflessness which only suppresses, but not removes, the obstructions to liberation from samsara. According to Tsongkhapa, only a negation which undercuts the innate perception of an inherently existing self is truly liberating.

Tsongkhapa rejects the idea that meditation is only about throwing away all concepts, instead, we need to gradually refine our understanding until it becomes non-conceptual wisdom. While Tsongkhapa emphasizes the importance of attaining the correct conceptual understanding of emptiness through this analytical contemplation, he also understands that this knowledge is not the actual realization of emptiness itself (which is non-conceptual and non-dualistic). As such, according to Tsongkhapa, after one has attained the correct conceptual understanding of emptiness, this insight needs to be refined through repeated calming meditation practice (and the samadhi which it produces) and continued familiarization with insight meditation. Over time, one&#x27;s insight is transformed into a nondualistic and non-conceptual experience of emptiness.

=== Vajrayana (Secret Mantra) ===
Tsongkhapa also practised and taught extensively on Vajrayana (i.e. Secret Mantra) Buddhism. He wrote commentaries on some of the main Sarma tantras, including the &quot;Vajrabhairava&quot;, &quot;Cakrasaṃvara&quot;, &quot;Kālacakra&quot; and &quot;Guhyasamāja&quot; tantras. He also wrote a grand summary of tantric thought and practice, &quot;The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra&quot;. Tsongkhapa&#x27;s tantric theory draws extensively on the two main commentarial traditions of the&quot; Guhyasamāja Tantra&quot;. Tsongkhapa also heavily relies on the works of Marpa Lotsawa (1012–1097) and Butön Rinchendrub (1290–1364), both of whom passed down lineages of the &quot;Guhyasamāja tantra&quot;, a text which Tsongkhapa considered to be the &quot;king of tantras&quot;. His close connection to the &quot;Guhyasamāja&quot; tradition was such that he referred to himself as a &quot;&quot;Guhyasamāja&quot; yogi&quot; and saw himself as a reviver and reformer of the tradition (and thus he composed various works on this tantric tradition).

For Tsongkhapa, Buddhist tantra is based on the same madhyamaka view of emptiness as sutra (non-tantric) Mahāyāna and that they both also share the same goal (Buddhahood). As such, Tsongkhapa sees Secret Mantra as being a subset of Mahāyāna Buddhism, and thus it also requires bodhicitta and insight into emptiness (through &quot;vipaśyanā&quot; meditation) as a foundation. Secret Mantra is only differentiated from sutra by its special method, the esoteric practice of deity yoga (Tib. &quot;lha&#x27;i rnal &#x27;byor&quot;), which is a much faster method than the practice of the six perfections alone. Tsongkhapa also argues that complete Buddhahood can ultimately only be attained through the practice of Highest Yoga Tantra (while the lower practices of the perfections and the other tantras aid one in advancing on the path). However, Tsongkhapa also holds that non-tantric Mahāyāna practices are indispensable the practice of Secret Mantra and that bodhicitta is the basis for the practice of both sutra Mahāyāna and Secret Mantra.

Thus, for Tsongkhapa, the sutra bodhisattva path (and its three principal aspects of renunciation, bodhicitta and insight into emptiness) must precede the practice of Secret Mantra. Indeed, according to Tsongkhapa, without having ascertained emptiness, one cannot practice the tantric yogas of Vajrayana. As Tsongkhapa states in &quot;A Lamp to Illuminate the Five Stages:&quot;for those who enter the Vajra Vehicle, it is necessary to search for an understanding of the view that has insight into the no-self emptiness and then to meditate upon its significance in order to abandon holding to reality, the root of samsara.

==Works==

Tsongkhapa promoted the study of pramana (epistemology), encouraged formal debates as part of Dharma studies, and instructed disciples in the Guhyasamāja, Kalacakra, and Hevajra Tantras. Tsongkhapa&#x27;s writings comprise eighteen volumes, with the largest amount being on &quot;Guhyasamāja tantra&quot;. These 18 volumes contain hundreds of titles relating to all aspects of Buddhist teachings and clarify some of the most difficult topics of Sutrayana and Vajrayana teachings. Tsongkhapa&#x27;s main treatises and commentaries on Madhyamaka are based on the tradition descended from Nagarjuna as elucidated by Buddhapālita and Candrakīrti.

<text>CutUP (also known as CutUP Collective) is a group of London-based artists, whose work mainly revolves around the manipulation of billboard advertisements. Their first works consisted of removing a billboard, painstakingly cutting it up into roughly 4000 small rectangles, each one in essence a pixel, and then reassembling the billboard.

More recently, CutUP have started other projects, such as replacing small bus-shelter advertisements with a drilled sheet of wood. The illuminating back lights that turn on at dusk reveal an image, as the many holes light up against the dark background.

Although they mainly deal with art on the street, the group have also created installations, including setting 96 different alarm clocks one a minute apart and sound installations, made up of 94 speakers, mini disks and circuit boards.

==Shows and exhibitions==
Cutup have held shows in London, New York and Barcelona, including two shows at London&#x27;s Seventeen Gallery, including a recent show which exhibited a full size billboard and a bus shelter, brought inside especially for the show, as well as related video and film pieces.

Other shows have included &quot;La Vida Te Espera&quot; at NIU Gallery, Barcelona in June 2006, &quot;Satellites&quot;, at Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, New York and a show at the Kemistry Gallery in Shoreditch.

==Members==
Vicky Thornton and Jim Woodall were among the founding members of CutUP.

<doc id="1323466" wikidata="Q175074" url="?curid=1323466" title="Official World Golf Ranking">
<text>The Official World Golf Ranking is a system for rating the performance level of professional golfers. It was started in 1986. The rankings are based on a player&#x27;s position in individual tournaments (i.e. not pairs or team events) over a &quot;rolling&quot; two-year period. New rankings are calculated each week. During 2018, nearly 400 tournaments on 20 tours were covered by the ranking system. All players competing in these tournaments are included in the rankings. In 2024, 23 tours factored into the world rankings. As well as being of general interest, the rankings have an additional importance, in that they are used as one of the qualifying criteria for entry into a number of leading tournaments.

==History==
The initiative for the creation of the Official World Golf Ranking came from the Championship Committee of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, which found in the 1980s that its system of issuing invitations to The Open Championship on a tour by tour basis was omitting an increasing number of top players because more of them were dividing their time between tours, and from preeminent sports agent Mark McCormack, who was the first chairman of the International Advisory Committee which oversees the rankings. The system used to calculate the rankings was developed from McCormack&#x27;s World Golf Rankings, which were published in his &quot;World of Professional Golf Annual&quot; from 1968 to 1985, although these were purely unofficial and not used for any wider purpose (such as inviting players to major tournaments).

The first ranking list was published prior to the 1986 Masters Tournament. The top six ranked golfers were: Bernhard Langer, Seve Ballesteros, Sandy Lyle, Tom Watson, Mark O&#x27;Meara and Greg Norman. Thus, the top three were all European, but there were 31 Americans in the top 50 (compared with 17 at the end of 2010).

The method of calculation of the rankings has changed considerably over the years. Initially, the rankings were calculated over a three-year period, with the current year&#x27;s points multiplied by four (three in 1986), the previous year&#x27;s points by two and the third year&#x27;s points by one. Rankings were based on the total points and points awarded were restricted to integer values. All tournaments recognised by the world&#x27;s professional tours, and some leading invitational events, were graded into categories ranging from major championship (whose winners would receive 50 points) to &quot;other tournaments&quot; (whose winners would receive a minimum of 8). In all events, other finishers received points on a diminishing scale that began with runners-up receiving 60% of the winners&#x27; points, and the number of players in the field receiving points would be the same as the points awarded to the winner. In a major, for example, all players finishing 30th to 40th would receive 2 points, and all players finishing 50th or higher, 1 point.

Beginning in April 1989, the rankings were changed to be based on the average points per event played instead of simply total points earned, subject to a minimum divisor of 60 (20 events per year). This was in order to more accurately reflect the status of some (particularly older) players, who played in far fewer events than their younger contemporaries but demonstrated in major championships that their ranking was artificially low. Tom Watson, for example, finished in the top 15 of eight major championships between 1987 and 1989, yet had a &quot;total points&quot; ranking of just 40th; his ranking became a more realistic 20th when based on &quot;average points&quot;. A new system for determining the &quot;weight&quot; of each tournament was also introduced, based on the strength of the tournament&#x27;s field in terms of their pre-tournament world rankings. Major championships were guaranteed to remain at 50 points for the winners, and all other events could attain a maximum of 40 points for the winner if all of the world&#x27;s top 100 were present. In practice most PGA Tour events awarded around 25 points to the winner, European Tour events around 18 and JPGA Tour events around 12.

In 1996, the three-year period was reduced to two years, with the current year now counting double and the minimum number of events reduced from 60 to 40. Points were extended to more of the field, beginning in 2000, and were no longer restricted to integer values. Beginning in September 2001, the tapering system was changed so that instead of the points for each result being doubled if they occurred in the most recent 12 months, one eighth of the initial &quot;multiplied up&quot; value was deducted every 13 weeks. This change effectively meant that players could now be more simply described as being awarded 100 points (not 50) for winning a major. Beginning in 2007, the system holds the points from each event at full value for 13 weeks and then reduces them in equal weekly increments over the remainder of the two-year period.

In 2010, a maximum number of tournaments was introduced as well as the minimum of 40. The maximum number was initially set to 60 from January 2010 and was reduced by 2 every six months until it reached 52 in January 2012. This means that since 2012 only the player&#x27;s 52 most recent tournaments (within the two-year period) are used to calculate his ranking average.

At first only the Championship Committee of the Royal and Ancient used the rankings for official purposes, but the PGA Tour recognized them in 1990, and in 1997 during the Open Championship, all five of the then principal men&#x27;s golf tours and the four major championships endorsed the ranking. The rankings, which had previously been called the Sony Ranking, were renamed the Official World Golf Ranking at that time.

==Organization==
Since 2004 the rankings have been produced by a company called &quot;Official World Golf Ranking&quot; which took over the ranking system from IMG. The company is a company limited by guarantee incorporated in the United Kingdom with its registered office at the European Tour Building at Wentworth. The company has seven members: The PGA of America, the International Federation of PGA Tours, the USGA, the PGA Tour, Augusta National, the R&amp;A and the PGA European Tour, who each contribute to the running of the company; £50,000 each in 2020. There is a chairman and seven directors, one appointed by each member, who make up the Governing board. There is also a Technical committee.
One of the objects of the company is &quot;to devise, maintain, review, update, administer and promote the recognition of a system that fairly ranks the relative performances of male professional golfers participating in the leading golf tournaments throughout the world, taking into account all relevant factors including, amongst other matters, the date of the tournament, the prestige of the tournament, the standard of the other participants and the value of the tournament prize fund.&quot;

==Tours included in the rankings==
The ranking system is endorsed by the four major championships and six major professional tours, five of which are charter members of the International Federation of PGA Tours:
* PGA Tour
* European Tour (currently titled as the DP World Tour for sponsorship reasons)

Points are also awarded for high finishes on other tours:
* Korn Ferry Tour, the official developmental tour for the PGA Tour
* Challenge Tour, the official developmental tour for the European Tour
* PGA Tour Americas, a newly combined tertiary development tour as of 2024 that is a merger of:
** PGA Tour Canada, originally the Canadian Professional Golf Tour when it became a full member of the Federation in 2009 and two one-off tours caused by 2020-21 pandemic restrictions:
*** LocaliQ Series, in 2020, replaced both the PGA Tour Canada and Latinoamérica.
*** Forme Tour, in 2021, was for PGA Tour Canada members unable to travel because of geographic restrictions.

Previous tours:
* Asia Golf Circuit, from 1986 until 1997. 
* OneAsia Tour, added in 2009 but was dropped in 2018.
* PGA EuroPro Tour, from July 2015 through 2022
* PGA Tour China, from 2014 through 2019

In July 2022, Official World Golf Ranking announced that it had received an application from LIV Golf for it to be included in the ranking system. LIV Golf&#x27;s application for OWGR status was denied October 2023. Other ranking systems do include LIV Golf.

==Calculation of the rankings==
Source:

Simply put, a golfer&#x27;s World Ranking is obtained by dividing their &quot;points total&quot; by the &quot;number of events&quot; they have played, which gives their &quot;average&quot;. Players are then ranked according to their average, highest first.

===Event ranking===

The first stage in the calculation is the ranking of each event. For most events the ranking depends on the current world rankings of the participating golfers and the participation of the leading golfers from the &quot;home tour&quot;.

A &quot;world rating value&quot; is calculated. Any golfer currently ranked in the world top 200 is given a rating value. The world No. 1 is allocated 45, the No. 2 is allocated 37, the No. 3 is allocated 32, down to those ranked between 101 and 200 who are allocated a rating value of 1 each. The maximum possible world rating value is 925 but this would only happen if all the top 200 golfers were playing.

A &quot;home tour rating value&quot; is calculated. The leading 30 golfers from the previous year&#x27;s &quot;home tour&quot; are given rating values. Most tours use earnings lists for their top 30, but the PGA Tour currently uses the FedEx points list calculated after the playoffs. Major championships and WGC events use the current world top 30 list. The home tour No. 1 is allocated 8 down to those from 16 to 30 who are allocated a rating value of 1 each. The maximum home tour rating value is 75 if all the top 30 players from the home tour are competing. The total home tour rating value is limited to 75% of the world rating value.

The world rating value and home tour rating value are added together to give a &quot;Strength of Field&quot; value. This is then converted into an event ranking using a table. As examples, a strength of field value of 10 converts to an event ranking of 8, a strength of field value of 100 converts to an event ranking of 24, while a strength of field value of 500 converts to an event ranking of 62.

Major championships have a fixed event ranking of 100 points. For each tour, there is a minimum ranking for each event. In addition, some tours have a &quot;flagship event&quot; that is guaranteed a higher ranking.


72-hole tournaments which are reduced to 54 holes retain full points, but if a tournament is reduced to 36 holes, its points allocation is reduced by 25%. 54-hole tournaments reduced to 36 holes retain full points.

===Player rankings===
Having calculated the ranking of the event, the ranking points of the players for that event can be calculated. The winner&#x27;s ranking points are the same as the ranking of the event, so that major winners get 100 ranking points. The second place golfer gets 60% of this amount, 40% for 3rd, 30% for 4th, 24% for 5th, down to 14% for 10th, 7% for 20th, 3.5% for 40th to 1.5% for 60th. Players tied for a position share the points for those positions so that if, for example, two players tie for second place they would each receive 50%, the average of 60% and 40%.

A player&#x27;s ranking points for an event must be at least 1.2. Players who would get less than this using the above formula get no ranking points. For example, if an event has a ranking of 10 only the leading 12 players (and ties) receive any ranking points since the player in 12th place gets 12% of the event ranking (i.e. 1.2). The player in 13th position gets no points. Where there is a tie for the final scoring place, those players are guaranteed to receive at least 1.2 points. Using the above example, if there were two or more players tied for 12th place, each would receive 1.2 points. The only exceptions to this system are in the major championships where all players who make the cut get a minimum of 1.5 ranking points.

Since 2019, the PGA Tour has used its season-ending Tour Championship strictly to determine the final distribution of its FedEx Cup bonus pool. The 30 players are seeded according to their ranking in the FedEx Cup standings, with all players starting at a specified score with respect to par and the player leading the field after four rounds winning the FedEx Cup and receiving credit for an official PGA Tour win. The person with the lowest score over the event&#x27;s four rounds receives no recognition from the tour. The OWGR ignores the PGA Tour&#x27;s treatment of this event, awarding ranking points based solely on each player&#x27;s performance during the Tour Championship itself.

===Adjusted rankings===
For the first 13 weeks after an event the player receives the full ranking points earned in that event. However, from then onwards they are reduced in equal weekly increments over the remainder of a two-year period. This gives priority to recent form. Each week the ranking points are reduced by a factor of 1/92 (approximately 1.09%) so that in week 14 only 98.91% of the ranking points are credited, continuing until week 104 when only 1.09% is credited. From week 105 the ranking points are completely lost.

===Ranking average===
The player&#x27;s adjusted points for all events in the two-year period are then added together, and this total is divided by the number of events to give the average ranking. However, players are subject to both a minimum and maximum number of events over the two-year period. If a player competes in fewer than 40 tournaments over the two-year period his adjusted points total is divided by 40 and not the actual number of events he has played in. There is also a maximum of 52 tournaments, which means that only the player&#x27;s 52 most recent tournaments (within the two-year period) are used.

The resulting averages for all players are put into descending order to produce the ranking table. This means that the player who has obtained most cumulative success does not necessarily come top of the rankings: it is &quot;average&quot; performance levels that are important, and some golfers play substantially more tournaments than others. New rankings are released every Monday.

==Importance of the rankings==
A professional golfer&#x27;s ranking is of considerable significance to his career. Currently a ranking in the World Top 50 grants automatic entry to all the majors and World Golf Championships; see table below. In addition, rankings are the main criterion for selection for the International Team in the Presidents Cup, while ranking points are one of the qualification criteria for the European Ryder Cup team. The rankings are also used to help select the field for various other tournaments.


==Timeline of the &quot;number one&quot; ranking==
The first official ranking list, the Sony Ranking, was published prior to the Masters in April 1986, with Bernhard Langer the first world No. 1 ranked player, ahead of Seve Ballesteros, who had topped the unofficial McCormack&#x27;s World Golf Rankings at the end of the previous year. Ballesteros briefly held the No. 1 spot after Langer, before Greg Norman&#x27;s worldwide success over the rest of that season made him the first year-end No. 1. Ballesteros took the No. 1 position back from Norman in 1987, and the pair exchanged the No. 1 position several times over the next two years. During 1990, Nick Faldo remained ranked just behind Norman despite winning three majors in two years (and more world ranking points in total than his rival, albeit having entered more events). As detailed in Mark McCormack&#x27;s &quot;World of Professional Golf 1991&quot; annual, it was also the case (but less immediately apparent) that Norman had won a total of 14 events during the ranking period to Faldo&#x27;s 10, and when the two had competed in the same tournament, had finished ahead of his rival 19 times to 11, so Norman&#x27;s No. 1 position (on the new &quot;average points&quot; system) had some justification. Faldo did inherit the No. 1 ranking for the first time early in 1991.

In April 1991, a quirk in the way the rankings treated results from previous years meant that Ian Woosnam, who had never won a major, took the No. 1 spot from Faldo on the eve of the latter&#x27;s attempt to win the Masters for a third year in succession; as if to justify his new ranking, Woosnam — and not Faldo — won the tournament. Twelve months later, Fred Couples similarly took over the No. 1 ranking shortly before the 1992 Masters, then also went on to make that tournament his first major victory. Faldo&#x27;s Open victory in 1992 lifted him back to the No. 1 position, and he held that spot until replaced by Nick Price, who in 1994 became the first African ranked No. 1 after his back-to-back major victories that summer.

By 1996, Greg Norman had regained the top spot and ended 1996 and 1997 narrowly ahead of first Tom Lehman, and then Tiger Woods and Ernie Els in the rankings, despite his rivals enjoying major victories in those years while he won none. Lehman, Els and Woods would all briefly become No. 1 during 1997, Lehman for a week – to date, the only player to hold the No. 1 ranking for just one week. In 1996, Colin Montgomerie also led the rankings in total points earned over the two-year period (but never on average points per event); in 1997 Els was top of a similar &quot;total points&quot; list. Those were the last occasions on which a player led on &quot;total&quot; points but not average points until 2016, when Dustin Johnson similarly had more points in total than the world number one Jason Day. Woods then finished 1998 narrowly ahead of Mark O&#x27;Meara even though the latter won two major titles that year while Woods won just once on the PGA Tour. In March 1999, David Duval became world No. 1 after winning The Players Championship, his sixth victory in a twelve-month period that came before his first major victory (which would follow two years later at the Open Championship).

In 2000, Tiger Woods had an unprecedented season of success that saw him earn 948 world ranking points in a single calendar year, so many points that even had his 1999 points (which represented the previous single-season record) been totally discounted from the calculation, Woods would still have had a points average easily high enough to lead the rankings – and Woods would still have led at the end of 2001 even had he earned no further points that year. Tiger Woods dominated the No. 1 spot for the following five years, but when Vijay Singh won the PGA Championship in 2004 and with it took the No. 1 ranking, that change highlighted the fact that Woods had not won a major for over two years, and also the extraordinary success Singh had recently on tour had that had allowed him to overtake the American. Woods responded by winning the very next major, the 2005 Masters, and with it regained the No. 1 spot, which he would then retain for a further five years. Following knee surgery in the summer of 2008, Woods missed the entire second half of the year, while Pádraig Harrington won two major championships, to add to the Open Championship he won in 2007. Despite earning no further ranking points during his absence, Woods remained No. 1 on the ranking system in December 2008.

During 2010, there was much debate as to whether Woods&#x27; continued retention of the No. 1 ranking (which he held up until the end of October) was justified given his relatively poor form—Woods finished fourth in two major championships in 2010, but failed to finish in the top ten of any other events he entered. During the 2010 season, several of his rivals for the No. 1 spot - including Masters champion Phil Mickelson (who had won four majors since 2004 but had yet to reach No. 1 in the rankings), Lee Westwood (who had yet to win a major but had finished second in both the Masters and Open Championships in 2010), and then Martin Kaymer (who had won the PGA Championship among four worldwide wins)— each missed opportunities to win particular events that would have taken them above Woods, before Westwood finally became world No. 1 on October 31.

During 2011, the possession of the No. 1 ranking would be the subject of much discussion among European golf commentators as it passed from Westwood to Kaymer, back to Westwood and then in May to Luke Donald, who took No. 1 spot by defeating Westwood in a playoff for the BMW PGA Championship. Donald, in becoming the fifteenth world No. 1, also became the first ever to reach No. 1 before having won or finished runner-up in a major championship in his career. Donald&#x27;s position at the top of the rankings was justified by his consistency through the rest of the 2011 season – becoming the first golfer ever to win the money title on both the European and PGA Tours in the same season.

In March 2012, Donald lost the No. 1 position to Rory McIlroy; the pair then exchanged the No. 1 position a further four times in the following two months, so the volatility of the No. 1 ranking again became a source of comment. At the end of 2012, McIlroy had opened up a clear lead at the top of the rankings, following his second major victory at the PGA Championship and emulating Donald in leading the money lists on both sides of the Atlantic. However, by the end of March 2013, a resurgent Tiger Woods had returned to the top of the rankings, after adding three PGA Tour wins in 2013 to his three victories from 2012 while McIlroy struggled with his form following equipment changes. Woods then suffered a back injury that sidelined him for the early part of 2014, and in his absence, Adam Scott, winner of the 2013 Masters, became the 17th world No. 1 on May 18, despite not winning an event in 2014 to that date; he would win the following week to secure his No. 1 position and avoid following Tom Lehman as a one-week No. 1. He held the No. 1 position until August 3, when McIlroy regained the top spot by following his Open Championship victory with another at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.

On August 16, 2015, following Jordan Spieth&#x27;s second-place finish at the 2015 PGA Championship (that followed earlier wins at the Masters and the U.S. Open), Spieth became the 18th world No. 1. Over the following three weeks, the No. 1 spot passed back and forth between McIlroy and Spieth, due to the way each player&#x27;s average points (which were almost identical) fluctuated (as their point weightings and events played divisors changed), until, on September 20, both were overtaken by Jason Day, the 2015 PGA Championship winner, who became the 19th world No. 1 with victory in the BMW Championship, his fifth of the season. A week later, Spieth regained the No. 1 spot from Day after winning the Tour Championship (and with it, the FedEx Cup), and concluded 2015 as world No. 1, but Day&#x27;s continued good form took him back to number one after winning the WGC Matchplay in March 2016.

On February 19, 2017, Dustin Johnson became the 20th player to reach number one in the rankings following his victory at the Genesis Open. He would remain number one for over a year before being overtaken in May 2018 by Justin Thomas, who had won the PGA championship and four other events in 2017. Johnson regained top spot but was overtaken again in September 2018 by Justin Rose, who had finished second at the Open and again in two FedEx Cup playoff events. Rose became the 22nd player to reach number one, and the fourth Englishman. Johnson regained the number one position from Rose but was replaced by a new number one for a third time in 2018 on October 21, when Brooks Koepka added victory in the CJ Cup to his two 2018 major titles. Koepka remained number one on the ranking at the end of 2018, even though Rose had amassed a higher total of ranking points (from more events entered). Dustin Johnson regained the number one position early in 2019 with victory at the WGC-Mexico Championship, but Koepka returned to number one when he retained his PGA Championship title in May 2019. Koepka remained number one at the end of 2019, although FedEx Cup winner Rory McIlroy had (like Rose the year before) amassed more ranking points in total than him. 

On February 9, 2020, McIlroy regained the number one position as his higher 2019 points total became reflected in the weighted average. Following the resumption of golf on the PGA Tour after suspension due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Jon Rahm became the 24th player to top the world rankings, and the second Spaniard, on July 19 after his victory at the Memorial Tournament, his fourth worldwide win in twelve months. Rahm became the second player after Luke Donald to become world number one before having won or been runner-up in a major championship. The following month Dustin Johnson regained the number one position following his victory in the Northern Trust event and remained number one at the end of 2020, strengthening his hold on the position by winning his first Masters Tournament in November. Rahm regained the number one position following his victory in the U.S. Open in June 2021.

In March 2022, Scottie Scheffler became the 25th player to reach number one after winning the WGC Match Play, his third victory of the 2022 season. Scheffler became the third player to become world number one before winning or finishing runner-up in a major. Emulating Ian Woosnam in 1991, Scheffler then promptly won his first major in his very first start as world number one, the 2022 Masters Tournament.

<text>&quot;The Brain Center at Whipple&#x27;s&quot; is episode 153 of the American television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on May 15, 1964 on CBS.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
In the future of 1967, Wallace V. Whipple, owner of a vast Midwestern manufacturing corporation, decides to upgrade his plant to increase profits by installing a machine named the &quot;X109B14 modified transistorized totally automatic assembly machine,&quot; which leads to tens of thousands of layoffs. Some former employees try to convince him that the value of a man outweighs that of a machine, but their protests fall on deaf ears. His plant manager, Mr. Hanley, reminds him that Whipple&#x27;s father, who ran the factory for 40 years, while profit-driven, had a sense of responsibility to his factory workers, and their pride in their work. Whipple coldly responds that while his father only &quot;doubled&quot; his factory production, his competitors quadrupled theirs. Dickerson, an angry veteran foreman, tries to smash a machine but is shot and injured by Whipple. While Hanley visits Dickerson in the hospital, Whipple is only concerned about his equipment. Hanley confronts Whipple about it and is summarily fired after being shown the machine replacing him. Whipple proceeds to replace secretaries with automated dictation machines, thinking that powder room breaks and maternity leave are inconveniences.

Whipple eventually fires all his human employees after replacing them with machines, which then turn on him by spitting out the harsh demeaning recorded parting words of his former employees back at him over and over, driving Whipple to insanity.

Eventually, the board of directors find him neurotically obsessed with machines and retire him. Whipple joins Hanley at the bar opposite his factory and expresses deep sorrow at his misfortune as he rambles about how it is not fair that machines are replacing men, his poetic justice for caring more about machines in the first place. He also admits that he is lonely because he is not married and has no family and that he feels cast aside like a used part.

The last scene reveals Whipple&#x27;s replacement to be a robot (Robby the Robot), which swings Whipple&#x27;s key on a chain the same way he used to.

==Closing narration==

* Paul Newlan as Walter Hanley

==Production notes==
The robot that ultimately replaces Mr. Whipple is &quot;Robby the Robot&quot; from the 1956 Sci-Fi film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;. &quot;Robby&quot; appeared in two other episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;: &quot;One for the Angels&quot;, the second episode of the series (as a miniature toy), and &quot;Uncle Simon.&quot;

==In popular culture==
*Sludge metal band Melvins named a song on their album &quot;Hostile Ambient Takeover&quot; after the episode.
*The episode was parodied in the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Benderama&quot;.
* The name Whipple can be seen in various episodes of the third revival series.

<doc id="1323475" wikidata="Q602601" url="?curid=1323475" title="Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus">
<text>Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus is the fourth album by the American rock band Spirit. It was produced by David Briggs, who is best known for his work with Neil Young. The original LP was released in November 1970 by Epic. The band&#x27;s lowest charting album to that point, it peaked at #63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in February 1971, spending only fourteen weeks on the chart. However, it sold well as a catalog item and became the band&#x27;s only album to ultimately attain a RIAA gold certification in the U.S., achieving that status in 1976.
On the Canadian RPM Magazine Top 100 charts, the album reached #49 and was in the top 100 for 10 weeks.

&quot;Nature&#x27;s Way&quot; became one of Spirit&#x27;s signature songs, but was not a big hit at the time, peaking at #111 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop charts in 1971. To capitalize on the album&#x27;s enduring appeal, &quot;Mr. Skin&quot; (the B-side of &quot;Nature&#x27;s Way&quot;) was released as an A-side in 1973 and also charted, peaking at #92. It was voted number 332 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).
Despite these commercial limitations, &quot;Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus&quot; enjoyed significant airing on college FM radio. The album was re-issued on CD in 1988 by MFSL, without bonus tracks, and in 1996 by Sony in remastered form, with bonus tracks. A 2022 two-CD release by Cherry Red Records also included several bonus tracks and a 1970 performance at the Fillmore West.

==Reception==
Writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Nick Tosches opined that the album was a &quot;blockbuster&quot; despite some shortcomings.

<text>Nazar Muhammad Rashed (), (1 August 1910 – 9 October 1975) commonly known as Noon Meem Rashed () or N.M. Rashed, was a Pakistani poet of modern Urdu poetry.

==Early life and education==
Rashed was born Raja Nazar Muhmmad Janjua into a Punjabi family of the Rajput-Janjua clan in the village of Kot Bhaaga, Akaal Garh (now Alipur Chatha), Wazirabad, Gujranwala District, Punjab, and earned a master&#x27;s degree in economics from the Government College Lahore.

==Career==
He served for a short time in the Royal Indian Army during the Second World War, attaining the rank of captain. Before independence of Pakistan in 1947, he worked with All India Radio in New Delhi and Lucknow starting in 1942. He was transferred to Peshawar in 1947 where he worked until 1953. Later he was hired by Voice of America and had to move to New York City for this job. Then, for a short while, he lived in Iran. Later on, he worked for the United Nations in New York.

Rashed served the UN and worked in many countries. He is considered to be the &#x27;father of Modernism&#x27; in Urdu Literature. Along with Faiz Ahmed Faiz, he is one of the great progressive poets in Pakistani literature.

His readership is limited and recent social changes have further hurt his stature and there seems to be a concerted effort not to promote his poetry. His first book of free verse, &quot;Mavra&quot;, was published in 1940 and established him as a pioneering figure in &#x27;free form&#x27; Urdu poetry.

He retired to England in 1973 and died in a London hospital in 1975.

==Bollywood==
His poem &quot;&quot;Zindagi sey dartey ho&quot; was set to music in the 2010 Bollywood movie, Peepli Live. It was performed by the Indian music band, Indian Ocean, and received critical appreciation as &quot;hard-hitting&quot; and &quot;a gem of a track&quot; that &quot;everyone is meant to sing, and mean, at some point in life&quot;&quot;.

==Bibliography==
* &quot;Mavraa&quot; (Beyond) 1940
* &quot;Iran Main Ajnabi&quot; (A stranger in Iran)
* &quot;La = Insaan&quot; (Nothingness = Man) 1969
* &quot;Gumaan ka Mumkin&quot; (Speculations) published posthumously in 1976 
* &quot;Maqalat&quot; (Essays)- Ed. Shima Majeed, 2002.

==College hall named after him==
At Government College Lahore., a hall is named after him as &quot;Noon Meem Rashid Hall&quot; at Postgraduate Block Basement.

<doc id="1323481" wikidata="Q7662763" url="?curid=1323481" title="Synthetic instrument">
<text>In metrology (test and measurement science), a synthetic instrument is software that performs a specific , analysis, or measurement function. A Synthetic Measurement System (SMS) is a common, general purpose, physical hardware platform that is intended to perform many kinds of synthesis, analysis, or measurement functions using synthetic instruments.

Typically the generic SMS hardware is dual cascade of three subsystems: digital processing and control, analog-to-digital or digital-to-analog conversion (codec), and signal conditioning. One cascade is for stimulus, one for response. Sandwiched between them is the device under test (DUT) that is being measured.

A synthetic instrument is the opposite of the retronym natural instrument. Although the word “synthetic” in the phrase synthetic instrument might seem to imply that synthetic instruments are synthesizers: that they only do synthesis; this is incorrect. The instrument itself is being synthesized; nothing is implied about what the instrument does. A synthetic instrument might indeed be a synthesizer, but it could just as easily be an analyzer, or some hybrid of the two.

Synthetic instruments are implemented on generic hardware, i.e., generic meaning that the underlying hardware is not explicitly designed to perform the particular measurement. This is probably the most salient characteristic of a synthetic instrument. Measurement specificity is encapsulated totally in software. The hardware does not define the measurement. 

An analogy to this relationship between specific measurement hardware versus generic hardware with its function totally defined in software is the relationship between specific digital circuits and a general purpose CPU. A specific digital circuit can be designed and hardwired with digital logic parts to perform a specific calculation. Alternatively, a microprocessor (or, better yet, a gate array) could be used to perform the same calculation using appropriate software. One case is specific, the other generic, with the specificity encapsulated in software.

At the software level, portability of measurement description is the key attribute that distinguishes a synthetic instrument from the more commonly found instrumentation software—software that is limited to hardware scripting and data flow processing. Not all measurement related software systems inherently provide for the abstract, portable synthesis of measurements. Even if they do have such provisions, they may not typically be applied that way by users, especially if the system encourages non-abstracted access to hardware. Application software packages such as Measure Foundry and LabVIEW are typically used with explicit structural links to the natural measurements made by specific hardware and therefore usually are not synthesizing measurements from an abstract description. On the other hand, should a software system be used to synthesize measurement functions as descriptive behavioral constructs, rather than hardware referenced structural data flow descriptions, this is true measurement synthesis. An analogy here is the distinction between a non portable structural
description and an abstract behavioral description of digital logic that we see in HDL systems like Verilog.

Synthetic instruments in test and measurement are conceptually related to the software synthesizer in audio or music. A musical instrument synthesizer synthesizes the sound of specific instruments from generic
hardware. Of course, a significant difference in these concepts is that musical instrument synthesizers typically only
generate musical sound, whereas a synthetic instrument in test and measurement may be equally likely to 
generate or to measure some signal or parameter. 

A similar term commonly used in test and measurement, Virtual instrumentation, is a superset of synthetic instrumentation. All synthetic instruments are virtual instruments; however, the two terms are different when virtual instrument software mirrors and augments non-generic instrument hardware, providing a soft front panel, or managing the data flow to and from a natural instrument. In this case, the PC and accompanying software is supplementing the analysis and presentation capabilities of the natural instrument.

The essential point is this: synthetic instruments are synthesized. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. To use Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s word, synthetic instruments are &quot;synergistic instruments&quot;. Like a triangle is more than three lines, synthetic instruments are more than the triangle of hardware (Control, Codec, Conditioning) they are implemented on. 

Therefore, one way to tell if you have a true synthetic instrument is to examine the hardware design alone and to try to figure out what sort of instrument it might be. If all you can determine are basic category facts, like the fact that it can be categorized as a stimulus or response instrument, but not anything about what it&#x27;s particularly designed to create or measure—if the measurement specificity is all hidden in software—then you likely have a true synthetic instrument.

The DoD has created a standards body called the Synthetic Instrument Working Group (SIWG) whose role is to define standards for interoperability of synthetic instrument systems. The SIWG defines a synthetic instruments (SI) as:

A reconfigurable system that links a series of elemental hardware and software components with standardized interfaces to generate signals or make measurements using numeric processing techniques.

<doc id="1323485" wikidata="Q3914844" url="?curid=1323485" title="Uncle Simon">
<text>&quot;Uncle Simon&quot; is an episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The episode explores people&#x27;s willingness to wallow in misery and hate, through the example of a woman who submits herself to serving first her mean-spirited uncle, and later the robot he malevolently designed.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Barbara Polk has lived with her elderly, sadistic uncle Simon Polk for 25 years — even though she hates him — as she is the only heir to his fortune. Simon constantly harangues his niece, calling her various unflattering names and insulting her in creative ways. He uses a laboratory in the basement of his house to develop inventions, and has forbidden her from going down there to see his latest project, about which he drops malevolent hints. When she sneaks into the basement to peek at it, the two have a verbal altercation. Simon catches her and raises his cane to strike. Barbara blocks with her arm, causing him to fall down the stairs and break his back. Frustrated with his abuse, nagging, and constant demands for hot chocolate, Barbara declines to assist and purposefully lets him die.

Following Simon’s death, his lawyer Mr. Schwimmer reads the will to Barbara: to inherit his estate, she must live in the house and look after his last invention, a robot also named Simon. Although its behavior and speech are very mechanical at first, it engages in AI learning as time goes on. It eventually acts and sounds just like him — right down to the old man’s limp, which it develops as a result of damage from Barbara’s attempt to destroy it by pushing it over backward. The robot repeats insults that Uncle Simon had programmed, berating Barbara as a “bovine crab” and “peanut-headed sample of nature’s carelessness.” Since Mr. Schwimmer makes regular visits to ensure that Barbara is taking proper care of the robot, as per the stipulations of the will, she has no choice but to submit to its continuing verbal abuse and demands — including bringing it hot chocolate as she did for Simon — or risk being disinherited.

<doc id="1323487" wikidata="Q4570842" url="?curid=1323487" title="Kerista">
<text>Kerista was a utopian community that was started in New York City in 1956 by John Peltz &quot;Bro Jud&quot; Presmont. Throughout much of its history, Kerista was centered on the ideals of polyfidelity, as well as the creation of intentional communities. Kerista underwent several incarnations that later became known as the &quot;Old Tribe&quot;, which was associated with a fairly large but fluid membership.

==Founding==
Kerista was founded by John Presmont after an auditory hallucination telling him that he was the founder of the next great religion of the world. After time spent in New York in the 1950s, and several island experiments in Dominica, Honduras, and Belize in the 1960s, Jud settled in San Francisco at the end of the 1960s.

==Old Tribe==
Kerista-inspired storefronts and communal houses existed in New York, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area throughout the 1960s, and were moderately popular. The ideology shared by the Old Tribe was remarkably simple: &#x27;Wash your own dish&#x27;, &#x27;No one belongs to anyone else&#x27;, &#x27;Kerista is freedom and love&#x27;. The main tenets of the Old Tribe embody the hippie ideals of &#x27;good vibes&#x27; and the &#x27;righteous high&#x27;, racial and sexual liberation, and a strong tendency toward dropping out of the default/mainstream world and living a non-conformist life of idealism, spontaneity, and fun. In addition, Old Tribers began the use of a Ouija board for wisdom and guidance, and use of the &quot;alphabet-board&quot; continued in the New Tribe.

One division occurred in the Old Tribe over the Vietnam War. Jud was a patriotic WWII ex-soldier, and he supported US military intervention. However, the vast majority of the Old Tribe were anti-war. Jud&#x27;s pro-military beliefs were unpopular in leftist circles, and regularly surprised visitors who expected Jud to be left-of-center.

==New Tribe==
From 1971 until 1991, the community was centered at the Kerista Commune (not a single physical building), founded in the Haight Ashbury district of San Francisco, California. The Keristans maintained a very high profile that included publication of a popular free newspaper and several national media appearances.

When it was active, Kerista was a focal point for those interested in alternative and non-monogamous lifestyles. The terms polyfidelity and compersion were coined at the Kerista Commune. The commune developed an entire vocabulary around alternative lifestyles; for example, the term &quot;polyintimacy&quot; in their literature was similar to the term &quot;polyamory&quot; popularized years later. Entrance to the commune was extremely selective. Potential members were expected to attend the Growth Coop for several months, interact with other Keristans at potluck volleyball and during newspaper distribution, and socialize with various BFIC families. This intense mutual-selection process included months of transitional celibacy. Starting in Fall 1986, it included screening for AIDS/HIV before joining a sleeping schedule. By 1987 there was no celibacy period, but three months of transitional safer sex and quarterly HIV testing for the duration. A more controversial policy was men being required to undergo a vasectomy in order to join. That policy was overturned a year before the New Tribe ended.

===Social contract standards===
Kerista accumulated a codified social contract over its history with which all members were expected to agree and comply, at all times. Starting with a few unwritten rules in 1971 to 26 standards in 1979, the social contract evolved to 84 standards by 1983. There were over 100 standards in 1991, examples of which included:
* Total rationality at all times
* Search for truth through the elimination of contradictions
* No jealousy, no anger, no rivalry, no sexism, no ageism, no racism, no classism, no duplicity, no alienation, no profanity, no flippancy
* Social tolerance, equality, verbality, participatory democracy, accountability, conviviality, graceful distancing
* Positive attitude toward the &#x27;toggle-switch&#x27; mode of decision-making
* There is one and only one objective reality

===Gestalt-O-Rama / Utopian Psychology===

Kerista used a group process called Gestalt-O-Rama, loosely taken from Fritz Perls&#x27; concept of gestalt (&quot;enhanced awareness of sensation, perception, bodily feelings, emotion, and behavior, in the present moment.&quot;) For Keristans, gestalt consisted of a lot of conversation in groups. Maintaining personal &#x27;resolve-on-the-lifestyle&#x27;, a euphemism for being aligned with the social contract, was a daily task for many Keristans. Being &#x27;unresolved-on-the-lifestyle&#x27;, even momentarily or temporarily, warranted immediate gestalt and possible expulsion from the family or commune. Practically, a member could be &quot;called out&quot; on any standards violation or non-utopian thought or action by anyone at any time.

===Publications===

Kerista produced zines that included drawings and comics. Some concerned day-to-day life. Others presented a lighthearted polytheistic mythology that revolved around a pantheon of benevolent and technologically adept goddesses and gods. The comic Far Out West, written by one of the founders Eve &quot;Even Eve&quot; Furchgott, claimed to be &quot;The First Utopian Comic Strip.&quot; Features presented in the zine included articles and essays concerning life within the community and their proposed World Plan to establish a functional Utopian society on a larger scale. The volume of publications and art work produced by Kerista Commune was quite a bit greater than other groups that were active in the Haight Ashbury during this period. Kerista claimed singer Joan Jett as the &quot;Matron Saint&quot; of their community.

===Work Life / Abacus===

The Keristans shared income and could choose whether to have outside paying jobs or work within the community (which operated several businesses, a legally incorporated church, and an educational non-profit organization).

The most successful of the businesses was Abacus, Inc., an early Macintosh computer vendor in San Francisco, which eventually offered a variety of computer hardware, training, and services. At its height, Abacus had over 250 employees, offices in five cities, and revenues in excess of $25 million a year. It was voted the 33rd and 42nd fastest-growing privately held company in America by &quot;Inc. Magazine&quot; in 1990 and 1991 respectively, and was the top reseller of Macintosh computers in the Bay Area in 1991.

===Membership===

A website run by a long-term former member, Kerista Commune website, lists 44 people as having joined Kerista at various times during the community&#x27;s history, though at least 75 passed through briefly. The commune population numbered 5 at founding in 1971, and 26 at dissolution in 1991. Before dissolution, there were closer to 30 Keristans in residence.

The commune maintained a very active program of social events and Gestalt-o-rama rap groups, which were open to the public 3-4 nights a week, and were mandatory for Keristans to regularly attend. The commune functioned much like a religious order and was an important focal point for a larger community of people in San Francisco interested in alternative lifestyles. The events sponsored by Kerista were almost always free and non-commercial.

In 1979 and 1980, two children were born in the community. Beginning in 1983, the adult male Keristans underwent vasectomies to deal with birth control and address global population issues. All male members subsequently had the requirement of having a vasectomy within a set period of time after joining the community.

===Family life / polyfidelity / sleeping schedule===
The family structure of Kerista was composed of fidelitous groups called B-FICs (Best-Friend Identity Clusters). Keristans practiced non-preferential polyfidelity, which required consensus to accept a new person into the group.

Non-preferentiality was an important concept of Keristan polyfidelity, and had lofty goals but was more intended to keep people from coupling up. Keristans had a transitional celibacy period after joining a group of three months, sometimes waived.

A single B-FIC was composed of men and women who rotated sleeping with all of the opposite-sex members on a balanced rotational sleeping schedule. The sleeping schedule assigned each family member to sleep with a different opposite-sex partner each night. Since the BFICs were rarely balanced between men and women (typically more women than men), on any given night several family-members would have no partner to sleep with and were assigned a &#x27;Zero-Night&#x27; when they slept alone. In addition to the programmed sleeping schedule, it was permitted to sleep with any opposite-sex family member at any time, which was termed a &#x27;freebie&#x27;.

===Jud as leader===

Jud exerted clear leadership and unparalleled influence over the daily life and direction of the commune and its members. He was highly verbal and charismatic, and had boundless confidence in his own opinion. As the oldest Keristan with many marriages and communal experiments behind him, he often dominated commune discussions. Jud typically got into fights with famous people who came to visit or study Kerista, like Stephen Gaskin from The Farm, Mario Savio from the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, and the researcher Robert Weiss.

===Criticism===
After an arranged visit to Kerista by three professors, the New Tribe was criticized for not being egalitarian, notably in Bro Jud&#x27;s dominance of many commune matters. The same professors questioned whether Kerista was feminist, and whether Kerista made only token contributions to philanthropy. A separate dissertation, written by an ex-Keristan, argued that Jud was not the primary problem, and instead criticized Kerista for institutionalizing &#x27;...a fetish for purity&#x27;, describing &#x27;the core psychological process in Kerista [to be] anxiety-producing and ultimately destructive because it centered around the toxic value of purity, which made the commune a bad place to live.&#x27;

==Dissolution==

In November 1991, Bro Jud left the Purple Submarine and the Kerista Commune after sharp divisions were exposed within the membership. Conflicts between Abacus and Kerista had grown more acute, as Abacus became more successful and difficult to manage. Other issues discussed during dissolution include allowing less-religious people into the commune and the loosening of superfluous rules.
After many incidents with members beginning to confront Jud&#x27;s behavior, Jud left Purple and Kerista. Within a few months, the community was dissolved by vote. Bro Jud went on to create &quot;The World Academy of Keristan Education&quot;. Several former members of the commune still live in the San Francisco Bay Area, while a number moved to Hawaii and purchased a block of adjoining parcels of land.

John (Bro Jud) Presmont died on December 13, 2009, in San Francisco. In his last years, Jud had been seen regularly on &#x27;The Bro Jud Show&#x27; on San Francisco public-access television cable TV. The show featured Judd set behind a desk in a chroma-keyed background featuring pre-recorded psychedelic visuals. After Jud&#x27;s opening invitations to global thought leaders to collaborate in his utopian vision. Associate member Jennifer Glee would make a reading, which was then interspersed by songs the &#x27;Bargain Basement Band&#x27; a mix of followers and local San Francisco musicians. Glee briefly took over the show after Jud suffered a hip injury in 2007 and has since started her own Youtube channel.

==Kerista, Robert A. Heinlein, and &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;==
Science-fiction author Robert A. Heinlein, in a 1966 letter to his agent Lurton Blassingame, mentioned Kerista in connection with his 1961 novel &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;:

The person who invited Heinlein to speak may have been Kerry Thornley, co-founder of Discordianism, who at the time lived in Watts. Thornley had joined Kerista in 1966 and was a lifelong science-fiction fan.

<text>David Breyer Singmaster (14 December 1938 – 13 February 2023) was an American-British mathematician who was emeritus professor of mathematics at London South Bank University, England. He had a huge personal collection of mechanical puzzles and books of brain teasers. He was most famous for being an early adopter and enthusiastic promoter of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube. His &quot;Notes on Rubik&#x27;s &quot;Magic Cube&quot;&quot; which he began compiling in 1979 provided the first mathematical analysis of the Cube as well as providing one of the first published solutions. The book contained his cube notation which allowed the recording of Rubik&#x27;s Cube moves, and which quickly became the standard.

Singmaster was both a puzzle historian and a composer of puzzles, and many of his puzzles were published in newspapers and magazines. In combinatorial number theory, Singmaster&#x27;s conjecture states that there is an upper bound on the number of times a number other than 1 can appear in Pascal&#x27;s triangle.

==Career==
David Singmaster was a student at the California Institute of Technology in the late 1950s. His intention was to become a civil engineer, but he became interested in chemistry and then physics. However he was thrown out of college in his third year for &quot;lack of academic ability&quot;. After a year working, he switched to the University of California, Berkeley. He only became really interested in mathematics in his final year when he took some courses in algebra and number theory. In the autumn semester, his number theory teacher Dick Lehmer posed a prize problem which Singmaster won. In his last semester, his algebra teacher posed a question the teacher didn&#x27;t know the answer to and Singmaster solved it, eventually leading to two papers. He gained his PhD from Berkeley, in 1966. He taught at the American University of Beirut, and then lived for a while in Cyprus.

Singmaster moved to London in 1970. The &quot;Polytechnic of the South Bank&quot; had been created from a merger of institutions in 1970, and Singmaster became a lecturer in the Department of Mathematical Sciences. His academic interests were in combinatorics and number theory.

In August 1971 he joined an archaeological expedition off the coast of Sicily, acting as photographer. He went off course one day and noticed a timber sticking up out of the sand. This led to the discovery of the Marsala Punic Ship.

Around 1972, he attended the Istituto di Matematica in Pisa for a year having won a research scholarship. He was promoted to a Readership (a Research Professorship) at the South Bank Polytechnic in September 1984. The polytechnic college became London South Bank University in 1992, and Singmaster was the professor of mathematics at the &quot;School of Computing, Information Systems and Mathematics&quot;. He retired in 1996. He became an honorary research fellow at University College London. He was designated emeritus at London South Bank University in 2020.

==Rubik&#x27;s Cubes==

Singmaster&#x27;s association with Rubik&#x27;s Cubes dates from August 1978, when he saw a Cube (at that time a rarity) at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki. Some other mathematicians at the conference, including John Conway and Roger Penrose, already had one.

Singmaster quickly acquired a Cube (in exchange for a copy of an M. C. Escher book) and was able to solve it by early September 1978. He said that it took him &quot;two weeks, on and off&quot; to find a general solution for the Cube. He devised his notation for recording moves (now known as the Singmaster notation) in December 1978. In June 1979 he wrote one of the first articles about the Cube in &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper.

In October 1979, he self-published his &quot;Notes on the &quot;Magic Cube&quot;&quot;. The booklet contained his mathematical analysis of Rubik&#x27;s Cube, allowing a solution to be constructed using basic group theory. In August 1980 he published an expanded 5th edition of the book retitled as &quot;Notes on Rubik&#x27;s &quot;Magic Cube&quot;&quot;. It included the results of his correspondence with other &quot;cubologists&quot;, and included details on monotwists, U-flips, Cayley graphs, and wreath products. The book contained his own &quot;step by step solution&quot; for the Cube, and it is accepted that he was a pioneer of the general Layer by Layer approach for solving the Cube. The book also contained a catalogue of pretty patterns including his &quot;cube in a cube in a cube&quot; pattern which he had discovered himself &quot;and was very pleased with&quot;. In 1981, at the height of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube craze, the book was republished by Penguin Books, with a US edition by Enslow Publishers. There were also Dutch and Spanish translations. He estimated that he sold around 50 to 60 000 copies of his book. Much of the mathematical content of the book was later reworked by Alexander H. Frey in collaboration with Singmaster to create their &quot;Handbook of Cubik Math&quot; published in 1982.

Singmaster was described as &quot;one of the most enthusiastic and prolific promoters of the Cube&quot;. In September 1981 he was said to be devoting &quot;almost 100%&quot; of his time to promoting, reporting, marketing and analysing the Cube. He soon began publishing a quarterly newsletter called the &quot;Cubic Circular&quot; which was published between 1981 and 1985.

==Puzzles==
Singmaster had one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of books on recreational mathematics which he had accumulated starting in the late 1970s. In 1996 he reported that the collection contained over 4700 works. He also collected books on cartoons, humour, and language. In 2013 his book collection was reported to be &quot;nearly 10000 items&quot;. Many of the books were housed in a library added as an extension to Singmaster&#x27;s study. He had a huge collection of mechanical puzzles, which he started in 2002 containing &quot;perhaps 3000 puzzles, of which about 400 are about Rubik&#x27;s Cube and its variants&quot;.

From around 1980 to 1982, he ran his own puzzle company, David Singmaster Ltd, which stocked &quot;over 100 puzzles and books&quot;. However the venture lost him &quot;a fair amount of money&quot; and led to prolonged tax negotiations. He referred to this period of his life as &quot;a massive overdose of cubism&quot;.

Singmaster was both a puzzle historian and a composer of puzzles, and he described himself as a &quot;metagrobologist&quot;. Many of his puzzles appeared in publications such as &quot;BBC Focus&quot;, &quot;Games &amp; Puzzles&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and the &quot;Weekend Telegraph&quot;. He published a collection of his puzzles in his 2016 book &quot;Problems for Metagrobologists&quot;. From around 2006 Singmaster was a director at the New York-based Conjuring Arts Research Center, retiring from the position (becoming Director Emeritus) in 2013. He was instrumental in the re-discovery of one of the world&#x27;s oldest books on puzzles and magic illusions when he came across a reference to the work in a 19th-century manuscript. The recovered text, &quot;De viribus quantitatis&quot; (&quot;&quot;) was penned by Luca Pacioli, a Franciscan friar who lived around 1500.

==Singmaster&#x27;s conjecture==

In combinatorial number theory, Singmaster&#x27;s conjecture states that there is a finite upper bound on the number of times a number other than 1 can appear in Pascal&#x27;s triangle. Paul Erdős suspected that the conjecture is true, but thought it would probably be very difficult to prove. The empirical evidence is consistent with the proposition that the smallest upper bound is 8.

==Media appearances==
In November 1981, Singmaster appeared on the scifi-themed BBC puzzle show &quot;The Adventure Game&quot;. From 1998 to 1999 he was a frequent panelist on the BBC Radio 4 show &quot;Puzzle Panel&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Singmaster was married twice, the second time to Deborah in 1972. They had one daughter, Jessica, adopted in 1976.

Singmaster died on 13 February 2023, at the age of 84.

<text>Koltur is an island in the Faroe Islands, located to the west of Streymoy and to the north-west of Hestur. The name &#x27;Koltur&#x27; means &#x27;colt&#x27;, in contrast with the name of the larger island to the south-east, &#x27;Hestur&#x27;, which means &#x27;horse&#x27;. The island has just one settlement, Koltur. It was abandoned in the 1980s by the sheep-farmers whose flocks grazed on the southern part of the island. Since then only two people have returned (in 1994). Koltur has two mountains, Kolturshamar (478 m) and Fjallið (101m) which strictly speaking is not a mountain, the name however translates directly as &quot;The Mountain&quot; and is considered by many as the smallest mountain in the country.

The island supports 160 adult sheep.

== History ==
Archaeological excavations have found that barley has been cultivated on the island as far back as 800–900AD, in the early Viking age. It continued to be cultivated up to near modern times, as straw from Koltur was considered the best for thatching, because there are no mice in the island to diminish the quality of the straw. All peat for fuel had to be cut at Syðradal and Fossdal on Streymoy or later in Skopun, Sandoy, and then transported by boat back to Koltur where it was stored in houses at Gróthústanga.

There have been two settlements on the islands, Heima í Húsi and Norðuri í Gerði. There is a story that the two families who lived there couldn&#x27;t agree about anything and never helped each other with anything, this went on for generations and in the end, it was forgotten what the original argument was about. Though the place-name &quot;Trætumørkin&quot;&quot;,&quot; hints at the argument being about a parcel of land.

Heima í Húsi is the older settlement and it is thought it is the original settlement on the island. It contains two farms: Niðri í Húsi and Uppi í Búð, The buildings are remarkably well preserved, and although they have had running repairs through the centuries there has been very little modernization compared to the rest of the country, and thus give a great insight into how people have lived in the past.

Norðuri í Gerði is newer than Heima í Húsi, but its old buildings are in much worse condition. Though in the &quot;Jarðarbókini&quot; from 1584 it is confirmed that this settlement already had been built by then. This is the location of the only inhabited house today.

In 1890 there were 42 people living on the island, spread over 6 families. 1954 was the last time anyone was buried in the cemetery. The cemetery lies some 600 metres to the north-east of the settlement of Norðuri í Gerði; the isolation from the settlement is said to be due to its being haunted, as it could often go long stretches of time before a priest came to the island to throw earth on the grave, and put the dead properly to rest according to custom.

=== Conservation ===
In 1987, Føroya Forngripafelag called for a plan to be made to preserve the island&#x27;s historically important locations. A formal plan for its conservation and continued habitation was put forward in 1990, and on 11 June 1992, it was formally adopted. As a result, some buildings between the two settlements had been repaired by 1996. In 1996, Fornminninevndin proposed to expand the conservation of the settlements, and their proposal was approved in 2000. Between 2000 and 2012, conservation efforts were undertaken in stages, with funding coming from various sources. In 2008 the Mc-Kinney Møllers Fond donated 5 million DKK to the restoration project. The project was deemed complete in 2012, and is now open as a museum. Efforts are ongoing to have the island listed as a national park, as it is the only island which is run as an organic farm.

== Transport ==
Up until 2024, there was a regular helicopter connection throughout the year, but this was scrapped in June 2024 by Atlantic Airways after the last residents left the island, despite the continued demand for a cost-effect method of reaching Koltur by tourists during the summer season. In summertime, local boat companies offer day trips from Gamlarætt and Tórshavn, but at over-inflated prices which far exceed the costs of visiting by helicopter. 

==Important Bird Area==
Most of the coastline of the island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially European storm petrels (5000 pairs), Atlantic puffins (20,000 pairs) and black guillemots (50 pairs). It was once a breeding ground for the extinct great auk.

<doc id="1323493" wikidata="Q526771" url="?curid=1323493" title="Both Sides">
<text>Both Sides is the fifth solo studio album by English singer-songwriter Phil Collins. Featuring an adult-oriented soft rock-based sound, released on 8 November 1993 by Virgin in the UK and Atlantic in the US. Collins created the album entirely by himself, without any collaborations from outside songwriters and performers. The record received generally positive critical reviews, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stating that the album&#x27;s &quot;artistically satisfying&quot; songs feature &quot;troubled, haunting tales&quot;.

The album achieved commercial success, reaching in the United Kingdom, in Australia, and in the United States. Collins also went on the highly successful Both Sides of the World Tour upon its release. That effort involved over a hundred performances in a tour that went over a year.

A special two-disc edition of the album, featuring the &quot;Live from the Board – Official Bootleg&quot; EP, as a second disc, titled &quot;Far Side... of the World: Gold Souvenir Tour Edition&quot;, was released in Southeast Asia and Australia in 1995. It peaked at in Australia. A newly remastered, two-disc deluxe edition of the album was released on 29 January 2016, as part of the &quot;Take a Look at Me Now&quot; series of Collins&#x27;s studio album reissues.

In a 2016 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Collins named &quot;Both Sides&quot; as his &quot;favourite album from a songwriting and creative perspective&quot;. Collins also said: &quot;It was very much a solo album. I played everything, the songs just streamed out of me, and as a writer, that&#x27;s the kind of thing that you dream of. It was the second divorce! Personal relationships at that time were tangled, is a better way of saying it, and it all came very spontaneously.&quot;

==Development==
&quot;Both Sides&quot; was made by Collins entirely on his own, without usual collaborators producer Hugh Padgham, guitarist Daryl Stuermer, bassist Leland Sklar and the Phenix Horns. After recording demos at home, the album was finished in six weeks at the Farm with the help of producer/engineer Paul Gomersall. It is mistakenly thought that Phil physically played all the instruments on this album but the guitars were computer generated sounds played through a keyboard. As a result, it is seen as his most personal album. &quot;In the end I had 17 songs, and kicked out all those that did not fit that mood. As far as performance is concerned this has more heart and soul than anything I have done before.&quot;

In addition, Collins wrote sleeve notes explaining the meaning of each song, another first. Collins expresses both his feelings and personal problems and addresses political issues over the course of the album. He touches on politics and &quot;the daily cloud of terrorism Britain seems to live under&quot; on &quot;We Wait and We Wonder&quot;, as well as a maturing disenchantment with the youth culture on &quot;We&#x27;re Sons of Our Fathers&quot;. The overall sound of &quot;Both Sides&quot; marked a return to the dark and melancholy style of his early albums &quot;Face Value&quot; and &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going!&quot;, which were largely grounded on the themes of relationship breakdown and loss. Mirroring the circumstances in which those albums were conceived, Collins&#x27; marriage to Jill Tavelman was also failing around the time that &quot;Both Sides&quot; was written. About the influence of his emotions on his songs, he adds: &quot;I have reached this point. Very intimate, very private songs seem to flow easily. I suddenly felt I had a lot to say.&quot;

==Critical response==
&quot;Both Sides&quot; was initially met with lukewarm reviews, particularly on adult contemporary radio, being criticised for its over-reliance on slow, dark and downbeat songs. The album was preceded by the title track as the first single, reaching no. 7 in the UK and no. 25 in the US (in a disappointing chart performance considering the lead singles from his two previous albums were no. 1 hits in America). The album itself was released weeks later, reaching to no. 13 in the US, though it still went platinum there. &quot;Both Sides&quot; was a hit in other European countries such as the UK (where it was the 8th biggest-selling album of 1993, despite only being available for the final eight weeks of the year), Germany &amp; Switzerland, reaching no. 1 all over Europe, but with a limited success, due to the lack of hit singles. The ballad &quot;Everyday&quot;, released in early 1994, was another Top 20 hit in the UK, peaking at no. 15, and became the biggest hit single from the album in the US, reaching no. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and no. 2 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The third and last single, &quot;We Wait and We Wonder&quot; — a political anthem — reached no. 45 in the UK.

However, over time the album&#x27;s reputation gradually improved, and reviews for the 2016 reissue were considerably more positive, AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated it 4 out of 5 stars and commended Collins&#x27; stepping out of big pop hooks and embracing an introspective art rock style for this album, which he saw as &quot;quietly compelling&quot;. On &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine&#x27;s review, Patrick Prince gave the album 3.5 stars, praising the melancholic style of the album as a welcome return to material similar to &quot;Face Value&quot;, although he criticized the ballads &quot;Everyday&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s a Place for Us&quot;, saying they are &quot;as bad as any sappy movie soundtrack cut ready to be forgotten&quot;.

==Track listing==


==Unreleased tracks==
Several instrumental tracks were recorded and subsequently released as extra tracks on both singles for &quot;Everyday&quot; and &quot;We Wait and We Wonder&quot;. These instrumental tracks include &quot;Rad Dudeski&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Ashley&quot;. In addition, there were other various B-sides that were released from the &quot;Both Sides&quot; sessions (&quot;Take Me with You&quot;, &quot;For a Friend&quot;) and a few cover songs that made it on other various albums.
&quot;For a Friend&quot; was written as a tribute to Collins&#x27;s longtime friend, saxophonist Don Myrick, who was wrongfully killed by a policeman in Los Angeles while Collins was composing the album. Myrick had played sax solos on Collins&#x27;s songs &quot;If Leaving Me Is Easy&quot;, &quot;The West Side&quot;, &quot;One More Night&quot; and &quot;All of My Life&quot;.

There has been discussion about a song called &quot;Deep Water Town&quot;. It is from the &quot;Both Sides&quot; sessions and did not make the cut, was never released nor widely circulated amongst collectors. A very early &quot;demo&quot; of it was released on the official fanclub website in 2011. It is more of an improvisation from which only a part of the chorus made it to the completed track. This completed track features an atmospheric drum machine, keyboard sounds (no piano) and vocals by Collins telling a story about a disaster at sea and families left behind.

In November 2004, Collins himself commented on the song on the forum of his old official website:
&quot;DEEP WATER TOWN...again I scratch my head and ask how did someone get it... I don&#x27;t think it was ever released, or am I going slowly senile. It was a pretty song about a disaster at sea, and the families left behind. Obviously one of my more cheerful pre-divorce moments. Circa Both Sides...&quot;

<text>Naumburg () is a town in (and the administrative capital of) the district Burgenlandkreis, in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, Central Germany. It has a population of around 33,000. The Naumburg Cathedral became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018. This UNESCO designation recognizes the processes that shaped the European continent during the High Middle Ages between 1000 and 1300: Christianization, the so-called &quot;Landesausbau&quot; and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.

==History==
The first written record of Naumburg dates from 1012, when it was mentioned as the &quot;new castle&quot; of the Ekkehardinger, the Margrave of Meissen. It was founded at the crossing of two trade-routes, Via Regia and the Regensburg Road. The successful foundation not long beforehand of a &quot;Propstei&quot; Church on the site of the later Naumburg Cathedral was mentioned in the Merseburg Bishops&#x27; Chronicles in 1021. In 1028 Pope John XIX gave his approval for the transfer of the bishopric from Zeitz to Naumburg. Until 1568, during the Reformation, Naumburg was the seat of the bishops. The last Catholic bishop was Julius von Pflug. The foundation of the cathedral school is dated to 1030. Naumburg has been known as a town since 1144.

Naumburg was a significant trading centre on the Via Regia in the Middle Ages, especially because of the Naumburg Trade Fairs, first known to have taken place in 1278. The emergence of Leipzig as a trade-fair centre from 1500 and the Thirty Years&#x27; War adversely affected the Naumburg economy.

In 1561, the Naumburg Diet recognized the unaltered Augsburg Confession and is recognized as part of the pre-history of the Book of Concord. The ecclesiastical domain was secularised in middle of the 16th century and transferred to the Dukes of Saxony, who administered the district through a government endowment (&quot;Stiftsregierung&quot;) and later provided administrators. After the fraternal agreement between the four brothers of John George I, Elector of Saxony, in 1657 the Naumburg district came into the possession of the secondogeniture of Saxe-Zeitz, which was inherited by Moritz, the youngest of the brothers.

Before the Moritzburg castle was built in nearby Zeitz, the city castle in Naumburg served as the residence of this line. This period came to an end with the death of the last Protestant representative of the Saxe-Zeitz line in the year 1718. The Naumburg district reverted to the Dukes of Saxony in Dresden and became fully integrated into Albertine Saxony. However, it remained until 1815 the seat of its own administrative authority (Consistory of the district of Naumburg-Zeitz). After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Naumburg was ceded to the Kingdom of Prussia, becoming part of the Province of Saxony. It gained control over the cathedral and its close in 1832.

In 1846 the city was connected to the rail line from Halle to Erfurt, in 1889 to Artern and eventually in 1900 to Teuchern. On 15 September 1892 a steam tramway opened in Naumburg. From 2 January 1907 the Naumburg tramway was electrified.

Although industry was only weakly developed, a socialist club was founded in 1848. During the 1920 Kapp Putsch five workers were killed. The establishment of the local Communist Party followed in December 1920. From 1933-1945, Jewish residents of Naumberg were systematically rounded up and killed. There is a memorial plaques displaying their names. 
Under the German Democratic Republic Naumburg was a centre of mechanical engineering, pharmaceuticals, metal-working and footwear manufacture. It was also a garrison town for the Soviet Air Force. Unofficial estimates are that the number of Soviet military personnel approximately equalled that of the local population. The fall of communism in 1989 was accompanied by demonstrations and gatherings in the churches of the city.

=== Naumburg Cathedral ===
Naumburg Cathedral is a UNESCO world heritage site. The cathedral is composed of a Romanesque core structure flanked by two Gothic choirs in the east and in the west. Naumburg Cathedral was one of the large double-choir cathedrals built in the transitional style between Late Romanesque and Early Gothic. The four towers form part of the Romanesque structure of the cathedral, even though parts of the upper floors and domes date from more recent style periods. The cathedral is a vaulted, cruciform basilica in a bound system with a segregated crossing.
The Late Romanesque structure of Naumburg Cathedral replaced the first, Early Romanesque cathedral, which had been consecrated around 1042. The new construction was initiated in 1242 under the patronage of the Princes of the Apostles – Peter and Paul.

Naumburg Masters 

The workshop organization of sculptors and stonemasons, the Naumburg Master innovated architecture and sculpture of the Hohenstaufen period of the 13th century that were particularly developed at the cathedral in Reims.

No written sources about the chief sculptor-architect of this workshop who was named after his main work in Naumburg. However, there is a general consensus with regard to the itinerary of the building workshop from Mainz via Naumburg to Meissen. An assumption relying on the analysis of historic sources is based on the idea that the milestones of his creative work are marked by the completion of the choir screen in Mainz in 1239, the west choir in Naumburg in 1249/50 and the work of the building workshop in Meissen from 1250 up until prior to 1268.

Next to the plant ornaments, based on the thorough observation of nature and found in all three places, and next to the many matching architectural details, identical stonemason&#x27;s marks recently found in Iben, Naumburg and Meissen support the evidence. The migration of the building workshop of the Naumburg Master, from Northern France over the Middle Rhine area up to the eastern boundaries of the German Empire and further on to southwestern Europe, reflects the extensive European cultural exchange during the High Middle Ages.

Choir screens

This mural choir screen type combines high artistic architecture, ornamentation and figural sculptures. The plant décor of the west choir, due to its exceptional accuracy and the great variety of shapes to be seen on the capitals, friezes and corbels (corydalis, mugwort, hazel and vine), softens the sharpness and blocky features of the partition architecture and emphasises the organic character of the architecture.

The relief frieze is one of the most sophisticated and formally most perfected arrangement of the Passion of Christ among the preserved sculptural ensembles from the 13th century throughout Europe. It shows the last supper, the payment of the pieces of silver, the capture, Peter&#x27;s denial, two guards, the reading of Christ&#x27;s sentence, the flagellation and the carrying of the cross. An important theme of the cycle is the juxtaposition of Judas and Peter; Judas, the sinner who was desperate and damned; Peter, the sinner who believed in forgiveness and became a saint.

The Naumburg Master achieved a high degree of dramatic expressiveness and natural vibrancy. The Jews, for example, wear the typical hats, while Pilatus appears in a splendorous courtly garment, washing his hands off responsibility. The artist mastered a remarkable challenge concerning the usage of the limited space. In the representation of the last supper, he limited the number of disciples beside Christ in the middle and the clearly isolated betrayer Judas to four. The monumental multi-coloured crucifixion group in the central portal of the choir screen shows in an impressive manner the immeasurable suffering of Christ and the deep and obvious grief of Mary and John.

Gothic west choir

The Early Gothic west choir is a hall choir and was built with an elevated gallery. On the level of the gallery, the ten pillars supporting the vault merge with the life-sized sculptures of the founders. The twelve statues of the founders of Naumburg Cathedral rank among the most outstanding creations of European medieval sculpting.

The nearly portrait-like representation of aristocratic men and women of the Thuringian-Saxon nobility is an unparalleled appreciation of the first founders of the church. Even though the people honoured with the sculptures had already been dead for 150 to 200 years at the time of creation, they are shown wearing contemporary courtly garments from the middle of the 13th century. The faces are individual and express inner emotions. The figures interact with the beholder and apparently with each other through looks and gestures.

The attempt to relate the sculptures of the founders to the first founders of the church that were mentioned in the call for donations from 1249 has proven to be an unsolvable undertaking, even after the meticulous examinations of the colouration of the statues during the restoration work. The prevalent opinion in art science is that the statues on the south side are Countess Gerburg and Count Conrad and those on the north side are Countess Berchta and Count Theodoric.

Two founder couples are standing across from each other in clearly prominent positions: Ekkehard II, Margrave of Meissen, with his wife Uta in the north and his older brother, Margrave Hermann, with his wife Reglindis in the south. Only the sculpture of Uta has experienced an unparalleled cult, fostered considerably by the photographs of Walter Hege in the early 20th century.

=== Old Town of Naumburg === 

The layout of both the bishop&#x27;s district and the old town, still intact to this day, were both created between the 11th and 13th centuries. They feature a number of high medieval monuments like the cathedral itself, the romanic residential tower next to the cathedral, the early gothic residential tower at the market square as well as the city wall.

Naumburg, a bishop&#x27;s seat and an important market place, was founded at the beginning of the 11th century. It was first mentioned in the records in the year 1012.

Some settlements already existed in the immediate neighbourhood of the newly founded town, as evidenced by pottery found at Domberg Hill, in the Othmarsviertel and in the western part of today&#x27;s town. There are no traces of the former Slav fortress of Wethau, which only survives in the name of the municipality of Wethau, where it is assumed to have been located.
The early development of the town of Naumburg is closely connected with the Ekkehardine dynasty, Emperor Conrad II and Bishop Hildeward of Zeitz, who transferred the family seat from Kleinjena to their own estate at the new castle in Naumburg (Nuenburch) around 1028.

In 1030, Naumburg appears in the sources with the addition ″civitas″. Encouraged by a privilege granted by Emperor Conrad II in 1033 the merchants of Kleinjena also moved to Naumburg, being guaranteed free trade and the heritable, interest-free ownership of their enclosed domicile. Ekkehard II and Hermann also established two monasteries: The Benedictine Monastery of St George and the St Moritz Monastery of the Augustinian Canons.

When the Ekkehardine dynasty died out by 1046, the bishops became the rulers of the town. By that time, Naumburg had already developed into a political, economic and religious centre. The foundation of Naumburg with its merchant settlement had also caused the trade routes in the region to relocate, concentrating on Naumburg located at the crossing of the Via Regia and the Regensburg Road.
The cathedral district (cathedral precincts, cathedral town) and the civil district as well as the immunities of the two monasteries coexisted for centuries and were visibly separated from each other by means of fortifications, forming districts subject to special rights. The relevant areas, subject to special rights held by the bishop and his cathedral chapter, included castles, towns, church institutions, villages, forums, but also fields, meadows and forests, and were enclosed by trenches, ramparts, walls, or fences.

The oldest residential tower of Naumburg was built probably in the mid-12th century at the cathedral precincts, at the curia episcopalis, Domplatz 1. It exhibits the same dimensions as the residential tower of the Haus zur Hohen Lilie and has two Romanesque floors. Another residential tower used to be located on the south side of the west choir of Naumburg Cathedral. It had to give way to the new west choir built in the second quarter of the 13th century. The Haus zur Hohen Lilie (Markt 19) is a Romanesque secular building including a tower visible from the market square, the kitchen building to the west of the tower, the northern building bordering the tower and the Baroque building north of the northern building.
Some parts of the medieval city fortifications survive, including one of the old city gates, the &quot;Marientor&quot;. The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche spent his childhood and his later years in Naumburg in the home of his mother&#x27;s family. The house, known as the &quot;Nietzsche-Haus&quot;, is now a museum.

==Politics==
The office of &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot; (Lord Mayor) was held by Bernward Küper (CDU) between 2007 and 2021. In April 2021, Armin Müller (CDU) was elected Lord Mayor.

==Economy==
Local industries include the manufacture of foodstuffs, textiles, machinery and toys. Naumburg is in a wine-growing region, with numerous vineyards in the surrounding area.

==Sports==
SC Naumburg was a former football club in the city from September 1899 to 1908.

==Arts and culture==
===Hussite Cherry Festival===
Every year on the last weekend in June, when the cherries are ripe, the city of Naumburg celebrates the Hussite Cherry Festival. This festival has a long tradition and dates back to at least the 16th century. Since the 17th century the celebrations have been connected with the legendary siege of Naumburg by the Hussites in 1432. A teacher is said to have led his pupils outside the gates of the beleaguered city to beg the Hussite commander Andreas Prokop for mercy. The latter granted their request and gave the children cherries. The legend is commemorated in the song &quot;Die Hussiten zogen vor Naumburg&quot; (The Hussites marched on Naumburg) written by Karl Friedrich Seyferth in 1832.

===Central German St. James Way===

Naumburg is located on the central German route of the St. James pilgrims way to Santiago de Compostela, the so-called Camino de Santiago. It follows the old Via Regia which has been designated a Cultural Route of the Council of Europe in 2005.

===Transromanica===
Another recognised cultural route is the German section of the international
Transromanica (a Cultural Route of the Council of Europe since 2007).

== Education ==

Naumburg had two grammar schools, the Domgymnasium and the Lepsiusgymnasium. After the fusion of both and the migration from the school site Seminarstraße in the year 2007, the Domgymnasium is now housed in the buildings of the former Lepsiusgymnasium. Since the incorporation of Bad Kösen, the town has a second gymnasium again, Pforta.

Between 1948 and 1993 Naumburg possessed an ecclesiastical university with the name &quot;Katechistisches Oberseminar&quot; (&quot;Catechetical advanced seminar&quot;), where theology, philosophy, religious education and for a while religious law was taught. At the same time there was an ecclesiastical proseminar. Here pupils, who were refused the Abitur at public schools during the SED regime, were able to attain an ecclesiastical qualification.

<doc id="1323496" wikidata="Q22920493" url="?curid=1323496" title="Endonym and exonym">
<text>An endonym (also known as autonym ) is a common, name for a group of people, individual person, geographical place, language, or dialect, meaning that it is used inside a particular group or linguistic community to identify or designate themselves, their place of origin, or their language.

An exonym (also known as xenonym ) is an established, &quot;non-native&quot; name for a group of people, individual person, geographical place, language, or dialect, meaning that it is used primarily outside the particular place inhabited by the group or linguistic community. Exonyms exist not only for historico-geographical reasons but also in consideration of difficulties when pronouncing foreign words, or from non-systematic attempts at transcribing into a different writing system.

For instance, is the endonym for the country that is also known by the exonyms &quot;Germany&quot; and in English and Italian, respectively, and in Spanish and French, respectively, in Polish, and in Finnish and Estonian.

==Naming and etymology ==
The terms &quot;autonym&quot;, &quot;endonym&quot;, &quot;exonym&quot; and &quot;xenonym&quot; are formed by adding specific prefixes to the Greek root word () , from Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot;.

The prefixes added to these terms are also derived from Greek:
*endonym: () ;
*exonym: () ;
*autonym: () ; and
*xenonym: () .

The terms &quot;autonym&quot; and &quot;xenonym&quot; also have different applications, thus leaving &quot;endonym&quot; and &quot;exonym&quot; as the preferred forms.

Marcel Aurousseau, an Australian geographer, first used the term &quot;exonym&quot; in his work &quot;The Rendering of Geographical Names&quot; (1957).

== Typology ==
s and s can be divided in three main categories:

* endonyms and exonyms of place names (toponyms),
* endonyms and exonyms of human names (anthroponyms), including names of ethnic groups (ethnonyms), localised populations (demonyms), and individuals (personal names),
* endonyms and exonyms of language names (glossonyms).

=== Endonyms and exonyms of toponyms ===
As it pertains to geographical features, the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names defines:

*Endonym: &quot;Name of a geographical feature in an official or well-established language occurring in that area where the feature is located.&quot;
* Exonym: &quot;Name used in a specific language for a geographical feature situated outside the area where that language is spoken, and differing in its form from the name used in an official or well-established language of that area where the geographical feature is located.&quot;

For example, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;China&quot;, &quot;Egypt&quot;, and &quot;Germany&quot; are the English-language exonyms corresponding to the endonyms (), (), (), and &quot;&quot;, respectively. There are also typonyms of specific features, for example hydronyms for bodies of water.

=== Endonyms and exonyms of glossonyms ===
In the case of endonyms and exonyms of language names (glossonyms), &quot;Chinese,&quot; &quot;German&quot;, and &quot;Dutch&quot;, for example, are English-language exonyms for the languages that are endonymously known as (), , and &quot;Nederlands&quot;, respectively.

== Exonyms in relation to endonyms ==

By their relation to endonyms, all exonyms can be divided into three main categories:

* those that are cognate words, diverged only in pronunciation or orthography;
* those that are fully or partially translated (a calque) from the native language;
* those derived from different roots, as in the case of Germany for .

Sometimes, a place name may be unable to use many of the letters when transliterated into an exonym because of the corresponding language&#x27;s lack of common sounds. Māori, having only one liquid consonant, is an example of this here.

=== Cognate exonyms ===
London (originally ), for example, is known by the cognate exonyms:

* in Catalan, Filipino, French, Galician, Portuguese, and Spanish;
* () in Greek;
* in Dutch and Afrikaans;
* in Italian, Maltese, Romanian, Romansh, Sardinian and Turkish;
* in Albanian;
* in Czech and Slovak;
* in Polish;
* in Māori;
* in Icelandic;
* in Irish;
* in Scottish Gaelic;
* in Welsh;
* in Finnish;
* in Vietnamese;
* () in Persian, and Urdu;
* () in Armenian;
* () in Chinese.

=== Translated exonyms ===
An example of a translated exonym is the name for the Netherlands ( in Dutch) used, respectively, in German (), French (), Italian (), Spanish (), Irish (), Portuguese () and Romanian (), all of which mean &quot;Low Countries&quot;. However, the endonym is singular, while all the aforementioned translations except Irish are plural.

=== Native and borrowed exonyms ===
Exonyms can also be divided into native and borrowed, e.g., from a third language. For example, the Slovene exonyms (Vienna) and (Venice) are native, but the Avar name of Paris, (&quot;Parizh&quot;) is borrowed from Russian (&quot;Parizh&quot;), which comes from Polish , which comes from Italian .

A substantial proportion of English-language exonyms for places in continental Europe are borrowed (or adapted) from French; for example:

* Belgrade ();
* Bucharest ();
* Cologne ( / );
* Florence ();
* Milan ();
* Munich ( / );
* Naples ( / );
* Navarre ( / );
* Prague ();
* Rome (); and
* Seville ().

== Typical development of exonyms ==
Many exonyms result from adaptations of an endonym into another language, mediated by differences in phonetics, while others may result from translation of the endonym, or as a reflection of the specific relationship an outsider group has with a local place or geographical feature.

According to James Matisoff, who introduced the term &quot;autonym&quot; into linguistics, exonyms can also arise from the &quot;egocentric&quot; tendency of in-groups to identify themselves with &quot;mankind in general&quot;, producing an endonym that out groups would not use, while another source is the human tendency towards neighbours to &quot;be pejorative rather than complimentary, especially where there is a real or fancied difference in cultural level between the ingroup and the outgroup.&quot; For example, Matisoff notes, &quot;an opprobrious term indicating mixed race or parentage&quot; is the Palaung name for Jingpo people and the Jingpo name for Chin people; both the Jingpo and Burmese use the Chinese word (&quot;&quot;) as the name for Lisu people.

As exonyms develop for places of significance for speakers of the language of the exonym, consequently, many European capitals have English exonyms, for example:

* Athens ();
* Belgrade ();
* Bucharest ();
* Brussels (, );
* Copenhagen ();
* Lisbon ();
* Moscow ();
* Prague ();
* Rome ();
* Vienna (); and
* Warsaw ().

In contrast, historically less-prominent capitals such as Ljubljana and Zagreb do not have English exonyms, but do have exonyms in languages spoken nearby, e.g. German: and (the latter being obsolete); Italian: &quot;Lubiana&quot; and &quot;Zagabria&quot;. Madrid, Berlin, Oslo, and Amsterdam, with identical names in most major European languages, are exceptions.

Some European cities might be considered partial exceptions, in that whilst the spelling is the same across languages, the pronunciation can differ. For example, the city of Paris is spelled the same way in French and English, but the French pronunciation [] is different from the English pronunciation [].

For places considered to be of lesser significance, attempts to reproduce local names have been made in English since the time of the Crusades. Livorno, for instance, was &quot;Leghorn&quot; because it was an Italian port essential to English merchants and, by the 18th century, to the British Navy; not far away, Rapallo, a minor port on the same sea, never received an exonym.

In earlier times, the name of the first tribe or village encountered became the exonym for the whole people beyond. Thus, the Romans used the tribal names (Greek) and (Germanic), the Russians used the village name of &quot;Chechen&quot;, medieval Europeans took the tribal name &quot;Tatar&quot; as emblematic for the whole Mongolic confederation (and then confused it with &quot;Tartarus&quot;, a word for Hell, to produce &quot;Tartar&quot;), and the Magyar invaders were equated with the 500-years-earlier Hunnish invaders in the same territory, and were called &quot;Hungarians&quot;.

The Germanic invaders of the Roman Empire applied the word &quot;Walha&quot; to foreigners they encountered and this evolved in West Germanic languages as a generic name for speakers of Celtic and later (as Celts became increasingly romanised) Romance languages; thence:
* Wallachia, the historic name of Romania inhabited by the Vlachs
* the Slavic term Vlah for &quot;Romanian&quot;, dialectally &quot;Italian, Latin&quot;
* Wallonia, the french-speaking region of Belgium
* Cornwall and Wales, the Celtic-speaking regions located West of the Anglo-Saxon-dominated England
* Wallis, a mostly French-speaking canton in Switzerland
* Welschland, the German name for the french-speaking Switzerland
* the Polish and Hungarian names for Italy, and respectively

== Usage ==
=== In avoiding exonyms ===
During the late 20th century, the use of exonyms often became controversial. Groups often prefer that outsiders avoid exonyms where they have come to be used in a pejorative way. For example, Romani people often prefer that term to exonyms such as &quot;Gypsy&quot; (from the name of Egypt), and the French term (from the name of Bohemia). People may also avoid exonyms for reasons of historical sensitivity, as in the case of German names for Polish and Czech places that, at one time, had been ethnically or politically German (e.g. Danzig/Gdańsk, Auschwitz/Oświęcim and Karlsbad/Karlovy Vary); and Russian names for non-Russian locations that were subsequently renamed or had their spelling changed (e.g. Kiev/Kyiv).

In recent years, geographers have sought to reduce the use of exonyms to avoid this kind of problem. For example, it is now common for Spanish speakers to refer to the Turkish capital as Ankara rather than use the Spanish exonym . Another example, it is now common for Italian speakers to refer to some African states as Mauritius and Seychelles rather than use the Italian exonyms &quot;Maurizio&quot; and &quot;Seicelle&quot;. According to the United Nations Statistics Division:

Time has, however, shown that initial ambitious attempts to rapidly decrease the number of exonyms were over-optimistic and not possible to realise in an intended way. The reason would appear to be that many exonyms have become common words in a language and can be seen as part of the language&#x27;s cultural heritage.

=== In preference of exonyms ===

In some situations, the use of exonyms can be preferred. For instance, in multilingual cities such as Brussels, which is known for its linguistic tensions between Dutch- and French-speakers, a neutral name may be preferred so as to not offend anyone. Thus, an exonym such as Brussels in English could be used instead of favoring either one of the local names (Dutch/Flemish: ; French: ).

Other difficulties with endonyms have to do with pronunciation, spelling, and word category. The endonym may include sounds and spellings that are highly unfamiliar to speakers of other languages, making appropriate usage difficult if not impossible for an outsider. Over the years, the endonym may have undergone phonetic changes, either in the original language or the borrowing language, thus changing an endonym into an exonym, as in the case of &quot;Paris&quot;, where the &quot;s&quot; was formerly pronounced in French. Another example is the endonym for the German city of Cologne, where the Latin original of has evolved into in German, while the Italian and Spanish exonym or the Portuguese closely reflects the Latin original.

In some cases, no standardised spelling is available, either because the language itself is unwritten (even unanalysed) or because there are competing non-standard spellings. Use of a misspelled endonym is perhaps more problematic than the respectful use of an existing exonym. Finally, an endonym may be a plural noun and may not naturally extend itself to adjectival usage in another language like English, which has the propensity to use the adjectives for describing culture and language.

=== Official preferences ===
Sometimes the government of a country tries to endorse the use of an endonym instead of traditional exonyms outside the country:
* In 1782, King Yotfa Chulalok of Siam moved the government seat from Thon Buri Province to Phra Nakhon Province. In 1972 the Thai government merged Thon Buri and Phra Nakhon, forming the new capital, Krungthep Mahanakhon. However, outside of Thailand, the capital retained the old name and is still called Bangkok.
* In 1935, Reza Shah requested that foreign nations use the name Iran rather than Persia in official correspondence. The name of the country had internally been Iran since the time of the Sassanid Empire (224–651), whereas the name Persia is descended from Greek (&quot;&quot;), referring to a single province which is officially known as Fars province.
* In 1949, the government of Siam changed the name to Thailand, although the former name&#x27;s adjective in English (&quot;Siamese&quot;) was retained as the name for the fish, cat and conjoined twins.
* In 1972, the government of Ceylon (the word is the anglicized form of Portuguese ) changed the name to Sri Lanka, although the name Ceylon was retained as the name for that type of tea.
* In 1985, the government of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire requested that the country&#x27;s French name be used in all languages instead of exonyms such as &quot;Ivory Coast&quot;, so that Côte d&#x27;Ivoire is now the official English name of that country in the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee (see name of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire). In most non-Francophone countries, however, the French version has not entered common parlance. For example, in German, the country is known as , in Spanish as and in Italian as .
* In 1989, the government of Burma requested that the English name of the country be Myanmar, with &quot;Myanma&quot; as the adjective of the country and &quot;Bamar&quot; as the name of the inhabitants (see names of Burma).
* The Government of India officially changed the English name of Bombay to Mumbai in November 1995, following a trend of renaming of cities and states in India that has occurred since independence.
* The Ukrainian government maintains that the capital of Ukraine should be spelled &quot;Kyiv&quot; in English because the traditional English exonym &quot;Kiev&quot; was derived from the Russian name (&quot;&quot;) (see Name of Kyiv).
* The Belarusian government argues that the endonym &quot;Belarus&quot; should be used in all languages. The result has been rather successful in English, where the former exonym &quot;Byelorussia&quot;/&quot;Belorussia&quot;, still used with reference to the Soviet Republic, has virtually died out; in other languages, exonyms are still much more common than &quot;Belarus&quot;, for instance in Danish , Dutch , Estonian , Faroese , Finnish , German , Greek (), Hungarian , Icelandic , Swedish , Turkish , Chinese (&quot;&quot;), Arabic () (all literally &#x27;White Russia&#x27;), or French , Italian , Portuguese , Spanish , and Serbian ().
* The government of Georgia has been working to have the country renamed from the Russian-derived exonym of in foreign languages to &quot;Georgia&quot;. Most countries have adopted this change, except for Lithuania, which adopted (a Lithuanianised version of the country&#x27;s endonym). As a response, Georgia changed the name of Lithuania in Georgian from the Russian-derived (&#x27;) to the endonym (&#x27;). Ukrainian politicians have also suggested that Ukraine change the Ukrainian name of Georgia from (&#x27;) to (&#x27;).
* In 2006, the South Korean national government officially changed the Chinese name of its capital, Seoul, from the exonym &#x27; () derived from the Joseon era Hanja name () to (&#x27;). This use has now been made official within China.
* In December 2021, a circular was issued by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey ordering the use of Türkiye (also rendered Turkiye in English) instead of exonyms in official communications, no matter the language.

=== Hanyu Pinyin ===

Following the 1979 declaration of Hanyu Pinyin spelling as the standard romanisation of Chinese, many Chinese endonyms have successfully replaced English exonyms, especially city and most provincial names in mainland China, for example: Beijing (), Qingdao (&#x27;), and the province of Guangdong (&#x27;). However, older English exonyms are sometimes used in certain contexts, for example: Peking (Beijing; duck, opera, etc.), Tsingtao (Qingdao), and Canton (Guangdong). In some cases the traditional English exonym is based on a local Chinese variety instead of Mandarin, in the case of Xiamen, where the name Amoy is closer to the Hokkien pronunciation.

In the case of &quot;Beijing&quot;, the adoption of the exonym by media outlets quickly gave rise to a hyperforeignised pronunciation, with the result that many English speakers actualize the &quot;j&quot; in &quot;Beijing&quot; as . One exception of Pinyin standardization in mainland China is the spelling of the province Shaanxi, which is the mixed Gwoyeu Romatzyh–Pinyin spelling of the province. That is because if Pinyin were used to spell the province, it would be indistinguishable from its neighboring province Shanxi, where the pronunciations of the two provinces only differ by tones, which are usually not written down when used in English.

In Taiwan, however, the standardization of Hanyu Pinyin has only seen mixed results. In Taipei, most (but not all) street and district names shifted to Hanyu Pinyin. For example, the Sinyi District is now spelled Xinyi. However, districts like Tamsui and even Taipei itself are not spelled according to Hanyu Pinyin spelling rules. As a matter of fact, most names of Taiwanese cities are still spelled using Chinese postal romanization, including Taipei, Taichung, Taitung, Keelung, and Kaohsiung.

During the 1980s, the Singapore Government encouraged the use of Hanyu Pinyin spelling for place names, especially those with Teochew, Hokkien or Cantonese names, as part of the Speak Mandarin Campaign to promote Mandarin and discourage the use of dialects. For example, the area of Nee Soon, named after Teochew-Peranakan businessman Lim Nee Soon (Hanyu Pinyin: Lín Yìshùn) became Yishun and the neighbourhood schools and places established following the change used the Hanyu Pinyin spelling. In contrast, Hougang is the Hanyu Pinyin spelling but the Hokkien pronunciation &quot;au-kang&quot; is most commonly used. The changes to Hanyu Pinyin were not only financially costly but were unpopular with the locals, who opined that the Hanyu Pinyin versions were too difficult for non-Chinese or non-Mandarin speakers to pronounce. The government eventually stopped the changes by the 1990s, which has led to some place names within a locality having differing spellings. For example, Nee Soon Road and the Singapore Armed Forces base Nee Soon Camp are both located in Yishun but retained the old spelling.

== Exonyms as pejoratives ==
Matisoff wrote, &quot;A group&#x27;s autonym is often egocentric, equating the name of the people with &#x27;mankind in general,&#x27; or the name of the language with &#x27;human speech&#x27;.&quot;

In Basque, the term &quot;&quot; is used for speakers of any language other than Basque (usually Spanish or French).

Many millennia earlier, the Greeks thought that all non-Greeks were uncultured and so called them &quot;barbarians&quot;, which eventually gave rise to the exonym &quot;Berber&quot;.

=== Slavic people ===
Exonyms often describe others as &quot;foreign-speaking&quot;, &quot;non-speaking&quot;, or &quot;nonsense-speaking&quot;. One example is the Slavic term for the Germans, , possibly deriving from plural of (&quot;mute&quot;); standard etymology has it that the Slavic peoples referred to their Germanic neighbors as &quot;mutes&quot; because they could not speak the &quot;language&quot;. The term survives to this day in the Slavic languages (e.g. Ukrainian німці (nimtsi); Russian немцы (nemtsy), Slovene Nemčija), and was borrowed into Hungarian, Romanian, and Ottoman Turkish (in which case it referred specifically to Austria).

One of the more prominent theories regarding the origin of the term &quot;Slav&quot; suggests that it comes from the Slavic root (hence &quot;Slovakia&quot; and &quot;Slovenia&quot; for example), meaning &#x27;word&#x27; or &#x27;speech&#x27;. In this context, the Slavs are describing Germanic people as &quot;mutes&quot;—in contrast to themselves, &quot;the speaking ones&quot;.

=== Native Americans ===
The most common names of several Indigenous American tribes derive from pejorative exonyms. The name &quot;Apache&quot; most likely derives from a Zuni word meaning &quot;enemy&quot;. The name &quot;Sioux&quot;, an abbreviated form of , most likely derived from a Proto-Algonquian term, (&#x27;foreign-speaking). The name &quot;Comanche&quot; comes from the Ute word meaning &quot;enemy, stranger&quot;. The Ancestral Puebloans are also known as the &quot;Anasazi&quot;, a Navajo word meaning &quot;ancient enemies&quot;, and contemporary Puebloans discourage the use of the exonym.

Various Native-American autonyms are sometimes explained to English readers as having literal translations of &quot;original people&quot; or &quot;normal people&quot;, with implicit contrast to other first nations as not original or not normal.

== Confusion with renaming ==
=== In East Asia ===

Although the pronunciation for several names of Chinese cities such as Beijing and Nanjing has not changed for quite some time while in Mandarin Chinese (although the prestige dialect shifted from Nanjing dialect to Beijing dialect during the 19th century), they were called Peking and Nanking in English due to the older Chinese postal romanization convention, based largely on the Nanjing dialect. Pinyin, based largely on the Beijing dialect, became the official romanization method for Mandarin in the 1970s.

As the Mandarin pronunciation does not perfectly map to an English phoneme, English speakers using either romanization will not pronounce the names correctly if standard English pronunciation is used. Nonetheless, many older English speakers still refer to the cities by their older English names, and even today they are often used in their traditional associations, such as Peking duck, Peking opera, and Peking University. As for Nanjing, the historical event called the Nanking Massacre (1937) uses the city&#x27;s older name because that was the name of the city at the time of occurrence.

Likewise, many Korean cities like Busan and Incheon (formerly Pusan and Inchǒn respectively) also underwent changes in spelling due to changes in romanization, even though the Korean pronunciations have largely stayed the same.

=== In Eurasia ===
Exonyms and endonyms must not be confused with the results of geographical renaming as in the case of Saint Petersburg, which became Petrograd (&#x27;) in 1914, Leningrad (&#x27;) in 1924, and again Saint Petersburg (&quot;&quot;, ) in 1991. In this case, although &quot;Saint Petersburg&quot; has a Dutch etymology, it was never a Dutch exonym for the city between 1914 and 1991, just as Nieuw Amsterdam, the Dutch name of New York City until 1664, is not its Dutch exonym.

Old place names that have become outdated after renaming may afterward still be used as historicisms. For example, even today one would talk about the Siege of Leningrad, not the Siege of St. Petersburg because at that time (1941–1944) the city was called Leningrad. Likewise, one would say that Immanuel Kant was born in Königsberg in 1724, not in Kaliningrad (&quot;), as it has been called since 1946.

Likewise, Istanbul (Turkish: ) is still called (&quot;) in Greek, although the name was changed in Turkish to dissociate the city from its Greek past between 1923 and 1930 (the name Istanbul itself derives from a Medieval Greek phrase). Prior to , the city was known in Greek as (, ), named after its mythical founder, Byzas.

=== In India ===
Following independence from the UK in 1947, many regions and cities have been renamed in accordance with local languages, or to change the English spelling to more closely match the indigenous local name. The name Madras, now Chennai, may be a special case. When the city was first settled by English people, in the early 17th century, both names were in use. They possibly referred to different villages which were fused into the new settlement. In any case, Madras became the exonym, while more recently, Chennai became the endonym. Madrasi, a term for a native of the city, has often been used derogatorily to refer to the people of Dravidian origin from the southern states of India.

<text>Marquess (July 18, 1889 – April 6, 1977) was a Japanese statesman who served as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan from 1940 to 1945, and was the closest advisor to Emperor Hirohito throughout World War II. He was convicted of war crimes and sentenced to life imprisonment, of which he served 6 years before being released in 1953.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Kōichi Kido was born on July 18, 1889, in Akasaka, Tokyo to Marquess Takamasa Kido and Sueko Yamao. He was the grand-nephew of Kido Takayoshi, one of the leaders of the Meiji Restoration. After graduating from the Gakushuin Peer&#x27;s School in Tokyo, he went to the law school of Kyoto University, where Marxist economist Hajime Kawakami was one of his professors. After graduation in 1915, he held numerous minor bureaucratic posts in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, followed by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Together with Shinji Yoshino and Nobusuke Kishi, he was one of the architects of the Strategic Industries Control Act on 1931, which set the stage for state control of numerous industries during the increasing militarization of Japan in the 1930s. Kido became chief secretary of the Home Ministry in 1930.

===Political career===
When his long-time friend Fumimaro Konoe became Prime Minister of Japan in 1937, Kido was named Minister of Education. From January 1938, he concurrently held the post of Minister of Health and Welfare. In January 1939, Kido was appointed Home Minister in the Hiranuma Cabinet.
As Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan from 1940, Kido became one of the most influential advisors to Emperor Hirohito following the death of Saionji Kinmochi. He recommended to Hirohito that Konoe succeed Mitsumasa Yonai for a second term as Prime Minister of Japan and was active with Konoe in the movement to replace the existing political parties with the &quot;Taisei Yokusankai&quot; (Imperial Rule Assistance Association) to form a single party state.

In 1941, Kido recommended that Hideki Tōjō become Prime Minister after Konoe&#x27;s third term in office, as being one of the few people eligible who might be able to maintain control over more radical elements within the Imperial Japanese Army. However, Kido remained one of the more cautious advisors to Hirohito at the beginning of World War II, and is known to have advised the emperor against attacking the Dutch East Indies in 1941, explaining that such an attack might provoke the United States into war, and that any oil obtained by taking the East Indies would still have to be transported, and would be subject to blockades and attacks by plane and submarine. Kido also claimed after the war that Hirohito was never aware of the plans to attack Pearl Harbor until after the attack occurred. As the war situation deteriorated for Japan, Kido was one of the chief advocates of a negotiated peace, and Kido is generally credited with convincing the government to accept the Potsdam Declaration and surrender. He also convinced the emperor that it would be necessary to deliver a personal speech in order to ensure that all civilians and soldiers would cease fighting. He was one of the principal targets for assassination during the Kyūjō Incident in the final days of the war.

===Post-war period===

Kido was not only the chief advisor to the emperor; he was a major liaison between the emperor and the government, and a representative of the Japanese government to the Allied Occupation Forces. He advised General MacArthur on many aspects of the logistics surrounding the surrender, the end of the war, and the Occupation of Japan. One of his chief motives was consistently to protect the honor of the emperor.

In the International Military Tribunal for the Far East held in Tokyo after the war, Kido was charged as a Class A War Criminal. He initially attempted to plead guilty in order to protect the emperor by taking all responsibility for imperial decisions advocating war unto himself. His personal diary, kept in detail since 1930, was voluntarily turned over to the prosecution, and became an important document in determining the internal workings of the Japanese government during the war and was often cited by the prosecution as evidence against the defendants, including Kido himself. Kido was found guilty of Counts 1, 27, 29, 31, and 32, and was sentenced to life imprisonment in Sugamo Prison, Tokyo.

In 1951, as the Occupation of Japan was ending, Kido sent a message to the emperor, advising him as he had advised three years earlier, to accept responsibility for the defeat and abdicate, at the end of the American Occupation. In addition, Kido opposed the idea of continuing to punish war criminals under Japanese law after the end of the American Occupation. According to his diary, &quot;those called war criminals by the enemy&#x27;s standards, especially those in responsible positions, were all performing loyal duties, and to punish them in the name of the emperor would be unbearable&quot;.

In 1953, due to health problems, Kido was released from prison. He lived the rest of his life in Oiso, Kanagawa Prefecture and had a flat in Tokyo&#x27;s Aoyama. He died at age 87 of cirrhosis of the liver at the Imperial Household Agency hospital in Tokyo in 1977. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Tokyo. Kido was married to Kodama Tsuruko, the daughter of General Kodama Gentaro. He had two sons and one daughter.

<doc id="1323505" wikidata="Q6460075" url="?curid=1323505" title="LSWR H15 class">
<text>The LSWR/SR H15 class was a class of 2-cylinder 4-6-0 steam locomotives designed by Robert Urie for mixed-traffic duties on the LSWR. Further batches were constructed by Richard Maunsell for the Southern Railway after 1923. They were given the nickname of &quot;Junior King Arthur&quot; due to the size of their driving wheels, with those on the S15 and their N15 counterparts being and diameters respectively.

== Construction history ==

The H15 class represented Robert Urie&#x27;s first design for the LSWR. It was created in response to a desperate lack of adequate locomotives in service on the LSWR that could be utilised for heavy freight duties. Reliability was also an issue, with ageing locomotive designs taking their toll on the LSWR&#x27;s resources.

The resultant design was an outside 2-cylinder locomotive fitted with outside Walschaerts valve gear for ease of maintenance, with all the working parts relatively accessible when compared to previous designs operating on the LSWR system.

Ten locomotives (numbers 482–491) were built new by Eastleigh Works with boilers. They appeared in January to July 1914. Urie was a proponent of superheating, so in order to gain experience and data on performance and fuel economy, four of the locomotives (482–485) were fitted with Schmidt superheaters, four (486–489) with Robinson superheaters, and two (490–491) were built as saturated locomotives. The last two had a lower weight than the first eight.

While the data gained from this small experiment showed the benefits of superheating, neither design of superheater was deemed suitable by Urie, so he designed and patented his own: the &quot;Eastleigh&quot; superheater, which was subsequently fitted to all members of the H15 class.

An additional locomotive was a rebuild of the 1905 E14 class No. 335 undertaken in December 1914. The locomotive had been scheduled for major modifications by Urie&#x27;s predecessor Dugald Drummond in the light of poor operational performance. Urie, instead of modifying it, rebuilt it as the eleventh member of the H15 class. It was the first locomotive to be fitted with an Eastleigh superheater, but it retained its original boiler pressure of .

However, improvements were made to the overall design whilst the locomotive was under production at Eastleigh Works. The earlier class members mounted a lower running plate that was raised above the cylinders for clearance. These locomotives also sported a single, straight splasher above the driving wheels, an embellishment that would feature on Urie&#x27;s later N15 class. The later production locomotives did not feature this design, with a higher-mounted straight running plate above the driving wheels, a feature that was perpetuated on the later S15 class design by Urie.

A total of 26 locomotives were completed in six batches, including number 335, over a period of twelve years. The first two batches of five in each were constructed in 1914. A further fifteen locomotives were constructed in three consecutive batches during 1924, the final one appearing in January 1925, and these were constructed under the auspices of Richard Maunsell, Urie&#x27;s successor. Amongst the final batches of the class was another rebuild project concerning five members of the Drummond F13 Class. Maunsell&#x27;s own batch of ten locomotives were a continuation of the design set out by Urie with number 491.

The class was provided with a 5,000 gallon Drummond &#x27;watercart&#x27; eight-wheeled tender design that enabled them to travel on the long distances of the LSWR network which never had water troughs. Further modifications to the class were made by Maunsell during the mid-1930s with the provision of smoke deflectors.

== Operational details ==

With their 21 × 28 inch cylinders allied with 6 ft 0 in driving wheels and a free-steaming boiler, they proved to be very capable of handling heavy trains. General overhauls revealed that they were very well built. When 30487 was stripped down for general repairs in 1954, it was found that the frames showed little sign of forty years of regular use. During their careers they were used on fast, heavy freights, and were particularly familiar around Okehampton hauling stone trains.

The Drummond F13 rebuild were notable for having very tall cabs, requiring footplate staff shorter than 6 foot in height to stand on improvised stools to reach some controls. This resulted in those class members with this feature being nicknamed &#x27;Cathedrals&#x27;. This nickname does not seem to have been applied to the rest of the class, although crews from Guildford depot referred to the others as the &#x27;City Breed&#x27;. All members of the class had been withdrawn by 1961 as a result of the BR 1955 Modernisation Plan, and no locomotives survived into preservation.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 22 January 1955, locomotive No. 30485 was in collision with N15 No. 30783 &quot;Sir Gillemere&quot; at Bournemouth Central station after the driver of the latter had misread signals. The locomotive was consequently withdrawn and scrapped.
*On 8 February 1956, locomotive No. 30477 was derailed in an accident near .

== Livery and numbering ==

=== LSWR and Southern ===

Livery was initially LSWR Drummond Lined Passenger Green livery, this being complemented by purple-brown edging and double yellow lining. The initials &#x27;LSWR&#x27; were located on the tender, and the number was placed on the cabside.

The first Southern livery, as displayed by the 1924 batch, continued that of the LSWR, though with the number displayed on the tender. However, from 1925, a darker Olive-type green was substituted, and the entire class was so outshopped. Wheels were green with black tyres. Primrose Yellow &#x27;Southern&#x27; and locomotive number transfers were placed on the tender tank.

By 1939, after Oliver Bulleid&#x27;s appointment as Chief Mechanical Engineer, the locomotives had been outshopped in an unlined black livery to denote their freight status subject to livery experimentation. &#x27;Southern&#x27; remained on the tender, though the number transfer was moved to the cabside, both in &#x27;Sunshine Yellow&#x27; lettering. During wartime service, a further modification to the livery was made with a green shading on the &#x27;Sunshine&#x27; lettering. The final Southern livery reverted to &#x27;Sunshine Yellow&#x27; lettering and numbering.

The first two batches of five were numbered 482–491. The later batches received the numbers 521–524, 330–334 (F13 rebuilds) and 473–478, and the final member was number E14 rebuild 335, which provided the basis for the entire class.

===Post-1948 (nationalisation)===

The class was given the BR Power Classification of 4P5F.
Livery immediately after Nationalisation was transitional, with &#x27;British Railways&#x27; on the tender in Southern Yellow. Numbers were initially given an &#x27;S&#x27; prefix. From the early 1950s the class was given the new BR mixed traffic Black with red/white lining.

The class was numbered according to the BR Standard Numbering System, given the series 30482–30491; 30521–30524; 30330–30334 (F13 rebuilds) and finally 30473–30478.

<doc id="1323516" wikidata="Q2585717" url="?curid=1323516" title="Military history of Australia">
<text>The military history of Australia spans the nation&#x27;s 230-year modern history, from the early Australian frontier wars between Aboriginal people and Europeans to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the early 21st century. Although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations, Australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars, and war and military service have been significant influences on Australian society and national identity, including the Anzac spirit. The relationship between war and Australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of Australian strategic culture and the unique security challenges it faces.

The six British colonies in Australia participated in some of Britain&#x27;s wars of the 19th century. In the early 20th century, as a federated dominion and later as an independent nation, Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War, as well as in the wars in Korea, Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam during the Cold War. In the Post-Vietnam era Australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions, through the United Nations and other agencies, including in the Sinai, Persian Gulf, Rwanda, Somalia, East Timor and the Solomon Islands, as well as many overseas humanitarian relief operations, while more recently they have also fought as part of multi-lateral forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In total, nearly 103,000 Australians died during these conflicts.

==War and Australian society==

For most of the last century military service has been one of the single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males, and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century, it continues to influence Australian society to this day. War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history, while a major part of the national identity has been built on an idealised conception of the Australian experience of war and of soldiering, known as the Anzac spirit. These ideals include notions of endurance, courage, ingenuity, humour, larrikinism, egalitarianism and mateship; traits which, according to popular thought, defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War. The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity.

The relationship between war and Australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture: bandwagoning with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare. Indeed, Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942, while since then an alliance with the United States has underwritten its security. Arguably, this pattern of bandwagoning—both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs, as well as for more pragmatic security concerns—has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies. Regardless, a tendency towards strategic complacency has also been evident, with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to allocate resources until a crisis arises; a trait which has historically resulted in unpreparedness for major military challenges.

Reflecting both the realist and liberal paradigms of international relations and the conception of national interests, a number of other important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious. Such themes include: an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics, the centrality of notions of Westphalian sovereignty, a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a guarantor of security, and the proposition that the status quo in international affairs should only be changed peacefully. Likewise, multilateralism, collective security and defence self-reliance have also been important themes. Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history, being the product of Australian society&#x27;s democratic political tradition and Judaeo-Christian Anglo-European heritage, as well its associated values, beliefs and economic, political and religious ideology. These behaviours are also reflective of its unique situation as a largely European island on the edge of the Asia-Pacific, and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power. To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers—known colloquially as Diggers—have often been noted, somewhat paradoxically, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities.

==History and services==

===Colonial era===
====British Forces in Australia, 1788–1870====
From 1788 until 1870 the defence of the Australian colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces. Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island, however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service, known as the New South Wales Corps. The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804. Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion, a coup mounted by its officers in 1808. As a result, in January 1810 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia. By 1870, 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia, as had a small number of artillery and engineer units.

Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack, no actual threat ever materialised. The British Army was instead used in policing, guarding convicts at penal institutions, combating bushranging, putting down convict rebellions—as occurred at Bathurst in 1830—and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement. Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 on the Victorian goldfields. Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India, Afghanistan, New Zealand and the Sudan.

During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by units detached by the Royal Navy&#x27;s Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, based in Sydney. However, in 1859 Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a commodore, marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia. The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until 1913, when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy; the Royal Navy&#x27;s depots, dockyards and structures were given to the Australian people.

====Frontier warfare, 1788–1934====
The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied, but were inevitably hostile when the settlers&#x27; presence led to competition over resources, and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants&#x27; lands. European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation. By and large neither the British nor the Aborigines approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare. At times, however, the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units. Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands, while many Aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes.

Fighting between Aboriginal people and Europeans was localised as the Aboriginal people did not form confederations capable of sustained resistance. As a result, there was not a single war, but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent. Organised or disorganised however, a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century. This warfare contradicts the popular and at times academic &quot;myth&quot; of peaceful settlement in Australia. Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence, resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres. Among the most famous is the Battle of Pinjarra in Western Australia in 1834. Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however, and after the Myall Creek massacre in New South Wales in 1838 seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings. However, in Tasmania the so-called Black War was fought between 1828 and 1832, and aimed at driving most of the island&#x27;s native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas. Although it began in failure for the British, it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population.

It may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly perpetrated by Europeans on Aboriginal people. Although many more Aboriginal people died than British, this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans. Aboriginal tactics varied, but were mainly based on pre-existing hunting and fighting practices—using spears, clubs and other primitive weapons. Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America, on the main Aboriginal people failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans. Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms, this was not widespread. The Aboriginal people were never a serious military threat to European settlers, regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them. On occasions large groups of Aboriginal people attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued, during which the Aboriginal people would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage. This could sometimes be effective, with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents, waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded. However, such open warfare usually proved more costly for the Aboriginal people than the Europeans.

Central to the success of the Europeans was the use of firearms. However, the advantages afforded by firearms have often been overstated. Prior to the late 19th century, firearms were often cumbersome muzzle-loading, smooth-bore, single shot muskets with flint-lock mechanisms. Such weapons produced a low rate of fire, while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within . These deficiencies may have initially given the Aboriginal people an advantage, allowing them to move in close and engage with spears or clubs. Yet by 1850 significant advances in firearms gave the Europeans a distinct advantage, with the six-shot Colt revolver, the Snider single shot breech-loading rifle and later the Martini-Henry rifle, as well as rapid-fire rifles such as the Winchester rifle, becoming available. These weapons, when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of Aboriginal people, often proved successful. The Europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast-moving, often hidden enemies. Tactics employed included night-time surprise attacks, and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks.

The conflict lasted for over 150 years and followed the pattern of British settlement in Australia. Beginning in New South Wales with the arrival of the first Europeans in May 1788, it continued in Sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s. As the frontier moved west so did the conflict, pushing into outback New South Wales in the 1840s. In Tasmania, fighting can be traced from 1804 to the 1830s, while in Victoria and the southern parts of South Australia, the majority of the violence occurred during the 1830s and 1840s. The south-west of Western Australia experienced warfare from 1829 to 1850. The war in Queensland began in the area around Brisbane in the 1840s and continued until 1860, moving to central Queensland in the 1850s and 1860s, and then to northern Queensland from the 1860s to 1900. In Western Australia, the violence moved north with European settlement, reaching the Kimberley region by 1880, with violent clashes continuing until the 1920s. In the Northern Territory conflict lasted even later still, especially in central Australia, continuing from the 1880s to the 1930s. One estimate of casualties places European deaths at 2,500, while at least 20,000 Aboriginal people are believed to have perished. Far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the Aboriginal population by the beginning of the 20th century; a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist.

====New Zealand Wars, 1861–64====
=====Taranaki War=====
In 1861, the Victorian ship HMCSS &quot;Victoria&quot; was dispatched to help the New Zealand colonial government in its war against Māori in Taranaki. &quot;Victoria&quot; was subsequently used for patrol duties and logistic support, although a number of personnel were involved in actions against Māori fortifications. One sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment.

=====Invasion of the Waikato=====

In late 1863, the New Zealand government requested troops to assist in the invasion of the Waikato province against the Māori. Promised settlement on confiscated land, more than 2,500 Australians (over half of whom were from Victoria) were recruited to form four Waikato Regiments. Other Australians became scouts in the Company of Forest Rangers. Despite experiencing arduous conditions the Australians were not heavily involved in battle, and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties. Australians were involved in actions at Matarikoriko, Pukekohe East, Titi Hill, Ōrākau and Te Ranga. Fewer than 20 were believed to have been killed in action. The conflict was over by 1864, and the Waikato Regiments disbanded in 1867. However, many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade, while many others had returned to Australia.

====Colonial military forces, 1870–1901====
From 1870 until 1901, each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence. The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890, and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs, the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia. To do this, they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces. Initially these were militias in support of British regulars, but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870, the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities. The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia, paid citizen soldiers, and a small permanent component. They were mainly infantry, cavalry and mounted infantry, and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline. Even after significant reforms in the 1870s—including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units—they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense. By 1885, the forces numbered 21,000 men. Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century, with the colonies raising contingents to serve in Sudan, South Africa and China.

Despite a reputation of colonial inferiority, many of the locally raised units were highly organised, disciplined, professional, and well trained. During this period, defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery, based on garrisoned coastal forts. However, by the 1890s, improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards—who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces—to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid mobilisation of brigades of infantry. As a consequence he called for a restructure of defences, and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies. Edwards argued for the colonial forces to be federated and for professional units—obliged to serve anywhere in the South Pacific—to replace the volunteer forces. These views found support in the influential New South Wales Commandant, Major General Edward Hutton, however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards New South Wales and Victoria stifled the proposal. These reforms remaining unresolved however, and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies.

With the exception of Western Australia, the colonies also operated their own navies. In 1856, Victoria received its own naval vessel, HMCSS &quot;Victoria&quot;, and its deployment to New Zealand in 1860 during the First Taranaki War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas. The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid-1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo-boats for the defence of harbours and rivers, as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts. Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies, with the ironclad HMVS &quot;Cerberus&quot; in service from 1870, as well as the steam-sail warship on loan from the Royal Navy, three small gunboats and five torpedo-boats. New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo-boats and a corvette. The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established in 1885, while South Australia operated a single ship, HMCS &quot;Protector&quot;. Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps, while Western Australia&#x27;s only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery. Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900, while HMCS &quot;Protector&quot; was sent by South Australia but saw no action. The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in 1901, when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia.

====Sudan, 1885====
During the early years of the 1880s, an Egyptian regime in the Sudan, backed by the British, came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad (or Ahmed), known as Mahdi to his followers. In 1883, as part of the Mahdist War, the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt, but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of extracting their forces. The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan, and sent General Charles Gordon to co-ordinate the evacuation, but he was killed in January 1885. When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885, the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent&#x27;s expenses. The New South Wales Contingent consisted of an infantry battalion of 522 men and 24 officers, and an artillery battery of 212 men and sailed from Sydney on 3 March 1885.

The contingent arrived in Suakin on 29 March and were attached to a brigade that consisted of Scots, Grenadier and Coldstream Guards. They subsequently marched for Tamai in a large &quot;square&quot; formation made up of 10,000 men. Reaching the village, they burned huts and returned to Suakin: three Australians were wounded in minor fighting. Most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards Berber, on the Nile. The Australians were then assigned to guard duties, but soon a camel corps was raised and 50 men volunteered. They rode on a reconnaissance to Takdul on 6 May and were heavily involved in a skirmish during which more than 100 Arabs were killed or captured. On 15 May, they made one last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting of the previous March. Meanwhile, the artillery were posted at Handoub and drilled for a month, but they soon rejoined the camp at Suakin.

Eventually the British government decided that the campaign in Sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in Suakin. The New South Wales Contingent sailed for home on 17 May, arriving in Sydney on 19 June 1885. Approximately 770 Australians served in Sudan; nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign.

====Second Boer War, 1899–1902====
British encroachment into areas of South Africa already settled by the Afrikaner Boers and the competition for resources and land that developed between them as a result, led to the Second Boer War in 1899. Pre-empting the deployment of British forces, the Afrikaner Republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic under President Paul Kruger declared war on 11 October 1899, striking deep into the British territories of Natal and the Cape Colony. After the outbreak of war, plans for the dispatch of a combined Australian force were subsequently set aside by the British War Office and each of the six colonial governments sent separate contingents to serve with British formations, with two squadrons each of 125 men from New South Wales and Victoria, and one each from the other colonies. The first troops arrived three weeks later, with the New South Wales Lancers—who had been training in England before the war, hurriedly diverted to South Africa. On 22 November, the Lancers came under fire for the first time near Belmont, and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them.

Following a series of minor victories, the British suffered a major setback during Black Week between 10 and 17 December 1899, although no Australian units were involved. The first contingents of infantry from Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania arrived in Cape Town on 26 November and were designated the &quot;Australian Regiment&quot; under the command of Colonel John Charles Hoad. With a need for increased mobility, they were soon converted into mounted infantry. Further units from Queensland and New South Wales arrived in December and were soon committed to the front. The first casualties occurred soon after at Sunnyside on 1 January 1900, after 250 Queensland Mounted Infantry and a column of Canadians, British and artillery attacked a Boer laager at Belmont. Troopers David McLeod and Victor Jones were killed when their patrol clashed with the Boer forward sentries. Regardless, the Boers were surprised and during two hours of heavy fighting, more than 50 were killed and another 40 taken prisoner. Five hundred Queenslanders and the New South Wales Lancers subsequently took part in the Siege of Kimberley in February 1900.

Despite serious set-backs at Colenso, Stormberg, Magersfontein, and Spion Kop in January—and with Ladysmith still under siege—the British mounted a five division counter-invasion of the Orange Free State in February. The attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General John French with the New South Wales Lancers, Queensland Mounted Infantry and New South Wales Army Medical Corps attached. First, Kimberley was relieved following the battles of Modder River and Magersfontein, and the retreating Boers defeated at Paardeberg, with the New South Wales Mounted Rifles locating the Boer general, Piet Cronjé. The British entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900, while Ladysmith was relieved. Disease began to take its toll and scores of men died. Still the advance continued, with the drive to Pretoria in May including more than 3,000 Australians. Johannesburg fell on 30 May, and the Boers withdrew from Pretoria on 3 June. The New South Wales Mounted Rifles and Western Australians saw action again at Diamond Hill on 12 June. Mafeking was relieved on 17 May.

Following the defeat of the Afrikaner republics still the Boers held out, forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt British troop movements and lines of supply. This new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the Australian colonies and the raising of the Bushmen&#x27;s Contingents, with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse-riding and shooting skills, but little military experience. After Federation in 1901, eight Australian Commonwealth Horse battalions of the newly created Australian Army were also sent to South Africa, although they saw little fighting before the war ended. Some Australians later joined local South African irregular units, instead of returning home after discharge. These soldiers were part of the British Army, and were subject to British military discipline. Such units included the Bushveldt Carbineers which gained notoriety as the unit in which Harry &quot;Breaker&quot; Morant and Peter Handcock served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes.

With the guerrillas requiring supplies, Koos de la Rey lead a force of 3,000 Boers against Brakfontein, on the Elands River in Western Transvaal. The post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by 300 Australians and 200 Rhodesians. The attack began on 4 August 1900 with heavy shelling causing 32 casualties. During the night the defenders dug in, enduring shelling and rifle fire. A relief force was stopped by the Boers, while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved. The siege lasted 11 days, during which more than 1,800 shells were fired into the post. After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders, and not prepared to risk a frontal attack, the Boers eventually retired. The Siege of Elands River was one of the major achievements of the Australians during the war, with the post finally relieved on 16 August.

In response the British adopted counter-insurgency tactics, including a scorched earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops, the establishment of concentration camps for Boer women and children, and a system of blockhouses and field obstacles to limit Boer mobility and to protect railway communications. Such measures required considerable expenditure, and caused much bitterness towards the British, however they soon yielded results. By mid-1901, the bulk of the fighting was over, and British mounted units would ride at night to attack Boer farmhouses or encampments, overwhelming them with superior numbers. Indicative of warfare in last months of 1901, the New South Wales Mounted Rifles travelled and were involved in 13 skirmishes, killing 27 Boers, wounding 15, and capturing 196 for the loss of five dead and 19 wounded. Other notable Australian actions included Slingersfontein, Pink Hill, Rhenosterkop and Haartebeestefontein.

Australians were not always successful however, suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war. On 12 June 1901, the 5th Victorian Mounted Rifles lost 19 killed and 42 wounded at Wilmansrust, near Middleburg after poor security allowed a force of 150 Boers to surprise them. On 30 October 1901, Victorians of the Scottish Horse Regiment also suffered heavy casualties at Gun Hill, although 60 Boers were also killed in the engagement. Meanwhile, at Onverwacht on 4 January 1902, the 5th Queensland Imperial Bushmen lost 13 killed and 17 wounded. Ultimately the Boers were defeated, and the war ended on 31 May 1902. In all 16,175 Australians served in South Africa, and perhaps another 10,000 enlisted as individuals in Imperial units; casualties included 251 killed in action, 267 died of disease and 43 missing in action, while a further 735 were wounded. Six Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross.

====Boxer Rebellion, 1900–01====

The Boxer Rebellion in China began in 1900, and a number of western nations—including many European powers, the United States, and Japan—soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests. In June, the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China. The colonies also offered to assist further, but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa, they had to rely on naval forces for manpower. The force dispatched was a modest one, with Britain accepting 200 men from Victoria, 260 from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS &quot;Protector&quot;, under the command of Captain William Creswell. Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade reservists, who had been trained in both ship handling and soldiering to fulfil their coastal defence role. Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at Victoria Barracks, Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War. The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors, while the New South Wales Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks. The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the NSW Marine Light Infantry.

The contingents from New South Wales and Victoria sailed for China on 8 August 1900. Arriving in Tientsin, the Australians provided 300 men to an 8,000-strong multinational force tasked with capturing the Chinese forts at Pei Tang, which dominated a key railway. They arrived too late to take part in the battle, but were involved in the attack on the fortress at Pao-ting Fu, where the Chinese government was believed to have found asylum after Peking was captured by western forces. The Victorians joined a force of 7,500 men on a ten-day march to the fort, once again only to find that it had already surrendered. The Victorians then garrisoned Tientsin and the New South Wales contingent undertook garrison duties in Peking. HMCS &quot;Protector&quot; was mostly used for survey, transport, and courier duties in the Bohai Sea, before departing in November. The naval brigades remained during the winter, unhappily performing policing and guard duties, as well as working as railwaymen and fire-fighters. They left China in March 1901, having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order. Six Australians died from sickness and injury, but none were killed as a result of enemy action.

===Australian military forces at Federation, 1901===

The Commonwealth of Australia came into existence on 1 January 1901 as a result of the federation of the Australian colonies. Under the Constitution of Australia, defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government. The co-ordination of Australia-wide defensive efforts in the face of Imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean was one of driving forces behind federalism, and the Department of Defence immediately came into being as a result, while the Commonwealth Military Forces (early forerunner of the Australian Army) and Commonwealth Naval Force were also soon established.

The Australian Commonwealth Military Forces came into being on 1 March 1901 and all the colonial forces—including those still in South Africa—became part of the new force. 28,923 colonial soldiers, including 1,457 professional soldiers, 18,603 paid militia and 8,863 unpaid volunteers, were subsequently transferred. The individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts until the &quot;Defence Act 1903&quot; brought all the units under one piece of legislation. This Act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside Australia. However, the majority of soldiers remained in militia units, known as the Citizen Military Forces (CMF). Major General Sir Edward Hutton—a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces—subsequently became the first commander of the Commonwealth Military Forces on 26 December and set to work devising an integrated structure for the new army. In 1911, following a report by Lord Kitchener the Royal Military College, Duntroon was established, as was a system of universal National Service.

Prior to federation each self-governing colony had operated its own naval force. These navies were small and lacked capabilities, forcing the separate colonies to subsidise the cost of a British naval squadron in their waters for decades. The colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 March 1901, when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created. This new force also lacked blue water capable ships, and ultimately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy. In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and Creswell, while attending the Imperial Conference in London, sought the British Government&#x27;s agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy. The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge, but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient. Deakin was unimpressed, and in 1908 invited the American Great White Fleet to visit Australia. This visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two 700-ton destroyers. The surge in German naval construction prompted the Admiralty to change their position however and the Royal Australian Navy was subsequently formed in 1911, absorbing the Commonwealth Naval Force. On 4 October 1913, the new fleet steamed through Sydney Heads, consisting of the battlecruiser , three light cruisers, and three destroyers, while several other ships were still under construction. And as a consequence the navy entered the First World War as a formidable force.

The Australian Flying Corps (AFC) was established as part of the Commonwealth Military Forces in 1912, prior to the formation of the Australian Military Forces in 1916 and was later separated in 1921 to form the Royal Australian Air Force, making it the second oldest air force in the world. Regardless, the service branches were not linked by a single chain of command however, and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments.

===First World War, 1914–18===
====Outbreak of hostilities====

When Britain declared war on Germany at the start of the First World War, the Australian government rapidly followed suit, with Prime Minister Joseph Cook declaring on 5 August 1914 that &quot;...when the Empire is at war, so also is Australia&quot; and reflecting the sentiment of many Australians that any declaration of war by Britain automatically included Australia. This was itself in part due to the large number of British-born citizens and first generation Anglo-Australians that made up the Australian population at the time. Indeed, by the end of the war almost 20% of those who served in the Australian forces had been born in Britain.

As the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under the provisions of the &quot;Defence Act 1903&quot;, an all-volunteer expeditionary force known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was formed and recruitment began on 10 August 1914. The government pledged 20,000 men, organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units. Enlistment and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under mobilisation plans drawn up in 1912. The first commander was Major General William Bridges, who also assumed command of the 1st Division. Throughout the course of the conflict Australian efforts were predominantly focused upon the ground war, although small air and naval forces were also committed.

====Occupation of German New Guinea====
Following the outbreak of war Australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of Germany&#x27;s Pacific colonies. The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&amp;MEF), a 2000-man volunteer force—separate from the AIF—and consisting of an infantry battalion plus 500 naval reservists and ex-sailors, was rapidly formed under the command of William Holmes. The objectives of the force were the wireless stations on Nauru, and those at Yap in the Caroline Islands, and at Rabaul in German New Guinea. The force reached Rabaul on 11 September 1914 and occupied it the next day, encountering only brief resistance from the German and native defenders during fighting at Bita Paka and Toma. German New Guinea surrendered on 17 September 1914. Australian losses were light, including six killed during the fighting, but were compounded by the mysterious loss offshore of the submarine AE1 with all 35 men aboard.

====Gallipoli====

The AIF departed by ship in a single convoy from Albany on 1 November 1914. During the journey one of the convoy&#x27;s naval escorts——engaged and destroyed the German cruiser at the Battle of Cocos on 8 November, in the first ship-to-ship action involving the Royal Australian Navy. Although originally bound for England to undergo further training and then for employment on the Western Front, the Australians were instead sent to British-controlled Egypt to pre-empt any Turkish attack against the strategically important Suez Canal, and with a view to opening another front against the Central Powers.

Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British, Indian and French forces committed to the campaign. The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC)—commanded by British general William Birdwood—subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915. Although promising to transform the war if successful, the Gallipoli Campaign was ill-conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate, without achieving its objectives. Australian casualties totalled 26,111, including 8,141 killed.

For Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign came to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity. Today, the date of the initial landings, 25 April, is known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations, as well as Turkey, to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original Anzacs, and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war.

====Egypt and Palestine====
After the withdrawal from Gallipoli the Australians returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion. In 1916 the infantry began to move to France while the cavalry units remained in the Middle East to fight the Turks. Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, playing a pivotal role in fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt. The Australians first saw combat during the Senussi uprising in the Libyan Desert and the Nile Valley, during which the combined British forces successfully put down the primitive pro-Turkish Islamic sect with heavy casualties. The Anzac Mounted Division subsequently saw considerable action in the Battle of Romani against the Turkish between 3–5 August 1916, with the Turks eventually pushed back. Following this victory the British forces went on the offensive in the Sinai, although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the Suez Canal. Rafa was captured on 9 January 1917, while the last of the small Turkish garrisons in the Sinai were eliminated in February.

The advance entered Palestine and an initial, unsuccessful attempt was made to capture Gaza on 26 March 1917, while a second and equally unsuccessful attempt was launched on 19 April. A third assault occurred between 31 October and 7 November and this time both the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division took part. The battle was a complete success for the British, over-running the Gaza-Beersheba line and capturing 12,000 Turkish soldiers. The critical moment was the capture of Beersheba on the first day, after the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade charged more than . The Turkish trenches were overrun, with the Australians capturing the wells at Beersheeba and securing the valuable water they contained along with over 700 prisoners for the loss of 31 killed and 36 wounded. Later, Australian troops assisted in pushing the Turkish forces out of Palestine and took part in actions at Mughar Ridge, Jerusalem and the Megiddo. The Turkish government surrendered on 30 October 1918. Units of the Light Horse were subsequently used to help put down a nationalist revolt in Egypt in 1919 and did so with efficiency and brutality, although they suffered a number of fatalities in the process.

Meanwhile, the AFC had undergone remarkable development, and its independence as a separate national force was unique among the Dominions. Deploying just a single aircraft to German New Guinea in 1914, the first operational flight did not occur until 27 May 1915 however, when the Mesopotamian Half Flight was called upon to assist in protecting British oil interests in Iraq. The AFC was soon expanded and four squadrons later saw action in Egypt, Palestine and on the Western Front, where they performed well.

====Western Front====
Five infantry divisions of the AIF saw action in France and Belgium, leaving Egypt in March 1916. I Anzac Corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of Armentières on 7 April 1916 and for the next two and a half years the AIF participated in most of the major battles on the Western Front, earning a formidable reputation. Although spared from the disastrous first day of the Battle of the Somme, within weeks four Australian divisions had been committed. The 5th Division, positioned on the left flank, was the first in action during the Battle of Fromelles on 19 July 1916, suffering 5,533 casualties in a single day. The 1st Division entered the line on 23 July, assaulting Pozieres, and by the time that they were relieved by the 2nd Division on 27 July, they had suffered 5,286 casualties. Mouquet Farm was attacked in August, with casualties totalling 6,300 men. By the time the AIF was withdrawn from the Somme to re-organise, they had suffered 23,000 casualties in just 45 days.

In March 1917, the 2nd and 5th Divisions pursued the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line, capturing the town of Bapaume. On 11 April, the 4th Division assaulted the Hindenburg Line in the disastrous First Battle of Bullecourt, losing over 3,000 casualties and 1,170 captured. On 15 April, the 1st and 2nd Divisions were counter-attacked near Lagnicourt and were forced to abandon the town, before recapturing it again. The 2nd Division then took part in the Second Battle of Bullecourt, beginning on 3 May, and succeeded in taking sections of the Hindenburg Line and holding them until relieved by the 1st Division. Finally, on 7 May the 5th Division relieved the 1st, remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid-May. Combined these efforts cost 7,482 Australian casualties.

On 7 June 1917, the II Anzac Corps—along with two British corps—launched an operation in Flanders to eliminate a salient south of Ypres. The attack commenced with the detonation of a million pounds (454,545 kg) of explosives that had been placed underneath the Messines ridge, destroying the German trenches. The advance was virtually unopposed, and despite strong German counterattacks the next day, it succeeded. Australian casualties during the Battle of Messines included nearly 6,800 men. I Anzac Corps then took part in the Third Battle of Ypres in Belgium as part of the campaign to capture the Gheluvelt Plateau, between September and November 1917. Individual actions took place at Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle and Passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks fighting the Australians suffered 38,000 casualties.

On 21 March 1918 the German Army launched its Spring Offensive in a last-ditched effort to win the war, unleashing sixty-three divisions over a front. As the Allies fell back the 3rd and 4th Divisions were rushed south to Amiens on the Somme. The offensive lasted for the next five months and all five AIF divisions in France were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide. By late May the Germans had pushed to within of Paris. During this time the Australians fought at Dernancourt, Morlancourt, Villers-Bretonneux, Hangard Wood, Hazebrouck, and Hamel. At Hamel the commander of the Australian Corps, Lieutenant General John Monash, successfully used combined arms—including aircraft, artillery and armour—in an attack for the first time.

The German offensive ground to a halt in mid-July and a brief lull followed, during which the Australians undertook a series of raids, known as Peaceful Penetrations. The Allies soon launched their own offensive—the Hundred Days Offensive—ultimately ending the war. Beginning on 8 August 1918 the offensive included four Australian divisions striking at Amiens. Using the combined arms techniques developed earlier at Hamel, significant gains were made on what became known as the &quot;Black Day&quot; of the German Army. The offensive continued for four months, and during Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at Lihons, Etinehem, Proyart, Chuignes, and Mont St Quentin, before their final engagement of the war on 5 October 1918 at Montbrehain. The AIF was subsequently out of the line when the armistice was declared on 11 November 1918.

In all 416,806 Australians enlisted in the AIF during the war and 333,000 served overseas. 61,508 were killed and another 155,000 were wounded (a total casualty rate of 65%). The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £376,993,052. Two referendums on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war, preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force, but stretching the reserves of manpower available, particularly towards the end of the fighting. Consequently, Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war.

The war had a profound effect on Australian society in other ways also. Indeed, for many Australians the nation&#x27;s involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of Australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war. 64 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War.

===Inter-war years===
====Russian Civil War, 1918–19====
The Russian Civil War began after the Russian provisional government collapsed and the Bolshevik party assumed power in October 1917. Following the end of the First World War, the western powers—including Britain—intervened, giving half-hearted support to the pro-tsarist, anti-Bolshevik White Russian forces. Although the Australian government refused to commit forces, many Australians serving with the British Army became involved in the fighting. A small number served as advisors to White Russian units with the North Russian Expeditionary Force (NREF). Awaiting repatriation in England, about 150 Australians subsequently enlisted in the British North Russia Relief Force (NRRF), where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed.

The Royal Australian Navy destroyer was also briefly engaged, carrying out an intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea in late 1918. Other Australians served as advisers with the British Military Mission to the White Russian General, Anton Denikin in South Russia, while several more advised Admiral Alexander Kolchak in Siberia. Later, they also served in Mesopotamia as part of Dunsterforce and the Malleson Mission, although these missions were aimed at preventing Turkish access to the Middle East and India, and did little fighting.

Although the motivations of those Australian&#x27;s that volunteered to fight in Russia can only be guessed at, it seems unlikely to have been political. Regardless, they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home at the time and made little difference to the outcome of the war. Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia.

====Malaita, 1927====
In October 1927, was called to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate as part of a punitive expedition in response to the killing of a district officer and sixteen others by Kwaio natives at Sinalagu on the island of Malaita on 3 October, known as the Malaita massacre. Arriving at Tulagi on 14 October, the ship proceeded to Malaita to protect the landing of three platoons of troops, then remained in the area to provide personnel support for the soldiers as they searched for the killers. The ship&#x27;s personnel took no part in operations ashore, providing only logistic and communications support. &quot;Adelaide&quot; returned to Australia on 23 November.

====Spanish Civil War, 1936–39====
A small number of Australian volunteers fought on both sides of the Spanish Civil War, although they predominantly supported the Spanish Republic through the International Brigades. The Australians were subsequently allocated to the battalions of other nationalities, such as the British Battalion and the Lincoln Battalion, rather than forming their own units. Most were radicals motivated by ideological reasons, while a number were Spanish-born migrants who returned to fight in their country of origin. At least 66 Australians volunteered, with only one—Nugent Bull, a conservative Catholic who was later killed serving in the RAF during the Second World War—known to have fought for General Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalist forces.

While a celebrated cause for the Australian left—particularly the Communist Party of Australia and the trade union movement—the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality. Australian opposition to the Republican cause was marshalled by B. A. Santamaria on an anti-communist basis, rather than a pro-Nationalist basis. Equally, although individual right wing Australians may have served with the Nationalist rebels, they received no public support. Service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time, however as the government received no reports of Australians travelling to Spain to enlist, no action was taken. Consequently, returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL). Although the number of Australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries, at least 14 were killed.

===Second World War, 1939–45===
====Europe and the Middle East====

Australia entered the Second World War on 3 September 1939. At the time of the declaration of war against Germany the Australian military was small and unready for war. Recruiting for a Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) began in mid-September. While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War, a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid-1940. Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940, three of which were dispatched to the Middle East. The RAAF&#x27;s resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), through which almost 28,000 Australians were trained during the war.

The Australian military&#x27;s first major engagements of the war were against Italian forces in the Mediterranean and North Africa. During 1940 the light cruiser and five elderly destroyers (dubbed the &quot;Scrap Iron Flotilla&quot; by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels—a title proudly accepted by the ships) took part in a series of operations as part of the British Mediterranean Fleet, and sank several Italian warships. The Army first saw action in January 1941, when the 6th Division formed part of the Commonwealth forces during Operation Compass. The division assaulted and captured Bardia on 5 January and Tobruk on 22 January, with tens of thousands of Italian troops surrendering at both towns. The 6th Division took part in the pursuit of the Italian Army and captured Benghazi on 4 February. In late February it was withdrawn for service in Greece, and was replaced by the 9th Division.

The Australian forces in the Mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during 1941. During April, the 6th Division, other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece. At the end of this campaign, the 6th Division was evacuated to Egypt and Crete. The force at Crete subsequently fought in the Battle of Crete during May, which also ended in defeat for the Allies. Over 5,000 Australians were captured in these campaigns, and the 6th Division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat. The Germans and Italians also went on the offensive in North Africa at the end of March and drove the Commonwealth force there back to near the border with Egypt. The 9th Division and a brigade of the 7th Division were besieged at Tobruk; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by British units in October. During June, the main body of the 7th Division, a brigade of the 6th Division and the I Corps headquarters took part in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign against the Vichy French. Resistance was stronger than expected; Australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the French capitulated in early July.

The majority of Australian units in the Mediterranean returned to Australia in early 1942, after the outbreak of the Pacific War. The 9th Division was the largest unit to remain in the Middle East, and played a key role in the First Battle of El Alamein during June and the Second Battle of El Alamein in October. The division returned to Australia in early 1943, but several RAAF squadrons and RAN warships took part in the subsequent Tunisia Campaign and the Italian Campaign from 1943 until the end of the war.

The RAAF&#x27;s role in the strategic air offensive in Europe formed Australia&#x27;s main contribution to the defeat of Germany. Approximately 13,000 Australian airmen served in dozens of British and five Australian squadrons in RAF Bomber Command between 1940 and the end of the war. Australians took part in all of Bomber Command&#x27;s major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on German cities and targets in France. Australian aircrew in Bomber Command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the Australian military during the Second World War and sustained almost 20 percent of all Australian deaths in combat; 3,486 were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner. Australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of Western Europe during 1944 and 1945 and two RAAF maritime patrol squadrons served in the Battle of the Atlantic.

====Asia and the Pacific====

From the 1920s Australia&#x27;s defence thinking was dominated by British Imperial defence policy, which was embodied by the &quot;Singapore strategy&quot;. This strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at Singapore from which a large British fleet would respond to Japanese aggression in the region. To this end, a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from Japan increased. However, as a result of the emphasis on co-operation with Britain, relatively few Australian military units had been retained in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. Measures were taken to improve Australia&#x27;s defences as war with Japan loomed in 1941, but these proved inadequate. In December 1941, the Australian Army in the Pacific comprised the 8th Division, most of which was stationed in Malaya, and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia. The RAAF was equipped with 373 aircraft, most of which were obsolete trainers, and the RAN had three cruisers and two destroyers in Australian waters.

The Australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early months of the Pacific War. The 8th Division and RAAF squadrons in Malaya formed a part of the British Commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller Japanese invasion force which landed on 7 December. The British Commonwealth force withdrew to Singapore at the end of January, but was forced to surrender on 15 February after the Japanese captured much of the island. Smaller Australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early 1942 at Rabaul, and in Ambon, Timor, and Java. The Australian town of Darwin was heavily bombed by the Japanese on 19 February, to prevent it from being used as an Allied base. Over 22,000 Australians were taken prisoner in early 1942 and endured harsh conditions in Japanese captivity. The prisoners were subjected to malnutrition, denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards. As a result, 8,296 Australian prisoners died in captivity.

The rapid Allied defeat in the Pacific caused many Australians to fear that the Japanese would invade the Australian mainland. While elements of the Imperial Japanese Navy proposed this in early 1942, it was judged to be impossible by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, which instead adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia. This fact was not known by the Allies at the time, and the Australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion. Large numbers of United States Army and Army Air Forces units arrived in Australia in early 1942, and the Australian military was placed under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur in March.

Australians played a central role in the New Guinea campaign during 1942 and 1943. After an attempt to land troops at Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the Owen Stanley Ranges and Milne Bay. Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the Kokoda Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay with the support of the RAAF and USAAF. Australian and US Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the Japanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard-fought Battle of Buna-Gona. The Australian Army also defeated a Japanese attempt to capture the town of Wau in January 1943 and went onto the offensive in the Salamaua-Lae campaign in April. In late 1943, the 7th and 9th Divisions played an important role in Operation Cartwheel, when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the Huon Peninsula during the Huon Peninsula campaign and Finisterre Range campaign.

The Australian mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943. Japanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and January to June 1943. These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the US and Australia and New Guinea, but were unsuccessful. On 14 May 1943 the hospital ship AHS &quot;Centaur&quot; was sunk by a Japanese submarine off Brisbane with the loss of 268 lives. Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI).

Australia&#x27;s role in the Pacific War declined from 1944. The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur&#x27;s proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late 1944, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there. In May 1945, I Corps, the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign, which continued until the end of the war. These campaigns contributed little to Japan&#x27;s defeat and remain controversial.

Following Japan&#x27;s surrender on 15 August 1945 Australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of Borneo and the eastern Netherlands East Indies until British and Dutch colonial rule was restored. Australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of Japanese personnel. 993,000 Australians enlisted during the war, while 557,000 served overseas. Casualties included 39,767 killed and another 66,553 were wounded. 20 Victoria Crosses were awarded to Australians.

===Post-war period===
====Demobilisation and peace-time defence arrangements====
The demobilisation of the Australian military following the end of the Second World War was completed in 1947. Plans for post-war defence arrangements were predicated on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force. It was envisioned the Royal Australian Navy would maintain a fleet that would include two light fleet carriers, two cruisers, six destroyers, 16 others ships in commission and another 52 in reserve. The Royal Australian Air Force would have a strength of 16 squadrons, including four manned by the Citizen Air Force. Meanwhile, in a significant departure from past Australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces, the Australian Army would include a permanent field force of 19,000 regulars organised into a brigade of three infantry battalions with armoured support, serving alongside a part-time force of 50,000 men in the Citizen Military Forces. The Australian Regular Army was subsequently formed on 30 September 1947, while the CMF was re-raised on 1 July 1948.

====Occupation of Japan, 1946–52====

In the immediate post-war period Australia contributed significant forces to the Allied occupation of Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), which included forces from Australia, Britain, India and New Zealand. At its height in 1946 the Australian component consisted of an infantry brigade, four warships and three fighter squadrons, totalling 13,500 personnel. The Australian Army component initially consisted of the 34th Brigade which arrived in Japan in February 1946 and was based in Hiroshima Prefecture. The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949, and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948, forming the basis of the post-war Regular Army. From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under-strength battalion. Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the BCOF ceased operations, although by that time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean peninsula following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The RAAF component consisted of Nos. 76, 77 and 82 Squadrons as part of No. 81 Wing RAAF flying P-51 Mustangs, initially based at Bofu from March 1946, before transferring to Iwakuni in 1948. However, by 1950 only No. 77 Squadron remained in Japan. A total of ten RAN warships served in Japan during this period, including HMA Ships &quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;Hobart&quot;, &quot;Shropshire&quot;, &quot;Arunta&quot;, &quot;Bataan&quot;, &quot;Culgoa&quot;, &quot;Murchison&quot;, &quot;Shoalhaven&quot;, &quot;Quadrant&quot; and &quot;Quiberon&quot;, while HMAS Ships &quot;Manoora&quot;, &quot;Westralia&quot; and &quot;Kanimbla&quot; also provided support.

===Cold War===
====Early planning and commitments====
During the early years of the Cold War, Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations, or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain. The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces, where they were expected to operate with British forces. Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin Airlift in 1948–49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954. Meanwhile, defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army, RAAF and RAN.

====Korean War, 1950–53====
On 25 June 1950, the North Korean Army (KPA) crossed the border into South Korea and advanced for the capital Seoul, which fell in less than a week. North Korean forces continued toward the port of Pusan and two days later the United States offered its assistance to South Korea. In response the United Nations Security Council requested members to assist in repelling the North Korean attack. Australia initially contributed P-51 Mustang fighter-bomber aircraft from No. 77 Squadron RAAF and infantry from the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), both of which were stationed in Japan as part of the BCOF. In addition, it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the British Commonwealth Forces Korea. The RAN frigate HMAS &quot;Shoalhaven&quot;, and the destroyer HMAS &quot;Bataan&quot;, were also committed. Later, an aircraft carrier strike group aboard was added to the force.

By the time 3 RAR arrived in Pusan on 28 September, the North Koreans were in retreat following the Inchon landings. As a part of the invasion force under the UN Supreme Commander, General Douglas MacArthur, the battalion moved north and was involved in its first major action at Battle of Yongju near Pyongyang on 22 October, before advancing towards the Yalu River. Further successful actions followed at Kujin on 25–26 October 1950 and at Chongju on 29 October 1950. North Korean casualties were heavy, while Australian losses included their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green, who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on 1 November. Meanwhile, during the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved 18 divisions of the People&#x27;s Volunteer Army across the Yalu River to reinforce the remnants of the KPA. Undetected by US and South Korean intelligence, the 13th Army Group crossed the border on 16 October and penetrated up to into North Korea, and were reinforced in early November by 12 divisions from the 9th Army Group; in total 30 divisions composed of 380,000 men. 3 RAR fought its first action against the Chinese at Pakchon on 5 November. The fighting cost the battalion heavily and despite halting a Chinese division the new battalion commander was dismissed in the wake. Following the Chinese intervention, the UN forces were defeated in successive battles and 3 RAR was forced to withdraw to the 38th parallel.

A series of battles followed at Uijeongbu on 1–4 January 1951, as the British and Australians occupied defensive positions in an attempt to secure the northern approaches to the South Korean capital. Further fighting occurred at Chuam-ni on 14–17 February 1951 following another Chinese advance, and later at Maehwa-San between 7–12 March 1951 as the UN resumed the offensive. Australian troops subsequently participated in two more major battles in 1951, with the first taking place during fighting which later became known as the Battle of Kapyong. On 22 April, Chinese forces attacked the Kapyong valley and forced the South Korean defenders to withdraw. Australian and Canadian troops were ordered to halt this Chinese advance. After a night of fighting the Australians recaptured their positions, at the cost of 32 men killed and 59 wounded. In July 1951, the Australian battalion became part of the combined Canadian, British, Australian, New Zealand, and Indian 1st Commonwealth Division. The second major battle took place during Operation Commando and occurred after the Chinese attacked a salient in a bend of the Imjin River. The 1st Commonwealth Division counter-attacked on 3 October, capturing a number of objectives including Hill 355 and Hill 317 during the Battle of Maryang San; after five days the Chinese retreated. Australian casualties included 20 dead and 104 wounded.

The belligerents then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the First World War, in which men lived in tunnels, redoubts, and sandbagged forts behind barbed wire defences. From 1951 until the end of the war, 3 RAR held trenches on the eastern side of the division&#x27;s positions in the hills northeast of the Imjin River. Across from them were heavily fortified Chinese positions. In March 1952, Australia increased its ground commitment to two battalions, sending 1 RAR. This battalion remained in Korea for 12 months, before being replaced by 2 RAR in April 1953. The Australians fought their last battle during 24–26 July 1953, with 2 RAR holding off a concerted Chinese attack along the Samichon River and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of five killed and 24 wounded. Hostilities were suspended on 27 July 1953. 17,808 Australians served during the war, with 341 killed, 1,216 wounded and 30 captured.

====Malayan Emergency, 1950–60====
The Malayan Emergency was declared on 18 June 1948, after three estate managers were murdered by members of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). Australian involvement began in June 1950, when in response to a British request, six Lincolns from No. 1 Squadron and a flight of Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron arrived in Singapore to form part of the British Commonwealth Far East Air Force (FEAF). The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs, troop movement, as well as paratroop and leaflet drops, while the Lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the Communist Terrorist (CT) jungle bases. The RAAF were particularly successful, and in one such mission known as Operation Termite, five Lincoln bombers destroyed 181 communist camps, killed 13 communists and forced one into surrender, in a joint operation with the RAF and ground troops. The Lincolns were withdrawn in 1958, and were replaced by Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron and CAC Sabres from No. 78 Wing. Based at RAAF Base Butterworth they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas.

Australian ground forces were deployed to Malaya in October 1955 as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. In January 1956, the first Australian ground forces were deployed on Malaysian peninsula, consisting of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR). 2 RAR mainly participated in &quot;mopping up&quot; operations over the next 20 months, conducting extensive patrolling in and near the CT jungle bases, as part of 28th British Commonwealth Brigade. Contact with the enemy was infrequent and results small, achieving relatively few kills. 2 RAR left Malaysia October 1957 to be replaced by 3 RAR. 3 RAR underwent six weeks of jungle training and began driving MCP insurgents back into the jungle of Perak and Kedah. The new battalion extensively patrolled and was involved in food denial operations and ambushes. Again contact was limited, although 3 RAR had more success than its predecessor. By late 1959, operations against the MCP were in their final phase, and most communists had been pushed back and across the Thailand border. 3 RAR left Malaysia October 1959 and was replaced by 1 RAR. Though patrolling the border 1 RAR did not make contact with the insurgents, and in October 1960 it was replaced by 2 RAR, which stayed in Malaysia until August 1963. The Malayan Emergency officially ended on 31 July 1960.

Australia also provided artillery and engineer support, along with an air-field construction squadron. The Royal Australian Navy also served in Malayan waters, firing on suspected communist positions between 1956 and 1957. The Emergency was the longest continued commitment in Australian military history; 7,000 Australians served and 51 died in Malaya—although only 15 were on operations—and another 27 were wounded.

====Military and Naval growth during the 1960s====

At the start of the 1960s, Prime Minister Robert Menzies greatly expanded the Australian military so that it could carry out the Government&#x27;s policy of &quot;Forward Defence&quot; in South East Asia. In 1964, Menzies announced a large increase in defence spending. The strength of the Australian Army would be increased by 50% over three years from 22,000 to 33,000; providing a full three-brigade division with nine battalions. The RAAF and RAN would also both be increased by 25%. In 1964, conscription or National Service was re-introduced under the &quot;National Service Act&quot;, for selected 20-year-olds based on date of birth, for a period of two years&#x27; continuous full-time service (the previous scheme having been suspended in 1959).

In 1961, three s were purchased from the United States to replace the ageing Q-class destroyers. Traditionally, the RAN had purchased designs based on those of the Royal Navy and the purchase of American destroyers was significant. and joined the fleet in 1965, followed by in 1967. Other projects included the construction of six frigates, the conversion of the aircraft carrier to an anti-submarine role, the acquisition of ten Wessex helicopters, and the purchase of six s.

The RAAF took delivery of their first Mirage fighters in 1967, equipping No. 3, No. 75 and No. 77 Squadrons with them. The service also received American F-111 strike aircraft, C-130 Hercules transports, P-3 Orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft and Italian Macchi trainers.

====Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, 1962–66====
The Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation was fought from 1962 to 1966 between the British Commonwealth and Indonesia over the creation of the Federation of Malaysia, with the Commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state. The war remained limited, and was fought primarily on the island of Borneo, although a number of Indonesian seaborne and airborne incursions onto the Malay Peninsula did occur. As part of Australia&#x27;s continuing military commitment to the security of Malaysia, army, naval and airforce units were based there as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. Regardless the Australian government was wary of involvement in a war with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the Malayan peninsula only. On two occasions Australian troops from 3 RAR were used to help mop up infiltrators from seaborne and airborne incursions at Labis and Pontian, in September and October 1964.

Following these raids the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo. During the early phases, British and Malaysian troops had attempted only to control the Malaysian/Indonesian border, and to protect population centres. However, by the time the Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action, crossing the border into Kalimantan to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the Indonesians to remain on the defensive, under the codename Operation Claret. The fighting took place in mountainous, jungle-clad terrain, and a debilitating climate, with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border, cross-border operations, the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply, and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions.

3 RAR deployed to Borneo in March 1965, and served in Sarawak until the end of July, operating on both sides of the border. The battalion had four major contacts with Indonesian forces and several smaller ones—including at Sungei Koemba, Kindau and Babang during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the Indonesians—as well as suffering casualties in two mine incidents. 4 RAR served a less-eventful tour between April and August 1966, and also operated over the border, successfully clashing with the Indonesians on a number of occasions. A squadron of the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) was also deployed in 1965 and again in 1966, taking part in cross-border operations and inflicting significant casualties on the Indonesians, even though they were often tasked with covert reconnaissance. Other units included artillery and engineers, while a number of RAN ships were involved in shelling Indonesian positions in Borneo and in repelling infiltrators in the Singapore Strait. The RAAF played a relatively minor role, although it would have been used far more extensively had the war escalated.

Operations in Borneo were extremely sensitive and they received little press coverage in Australia, while official acknowledgement of involvement in cross-border missions only occurred in 1996. Following a military coup in Indonesia in early 1966 which brought General Suharto to power, a peace treaty was signed in August 1966 which ended the conflict. 3,500 Australians served during Confrontation; casualties included 16 dead, with seven killed in action and eight wounded.

====Vietnam War, 1962–73====
Australia&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War was driven largely by the rise of communism in Southeast Asia after the Second World War, and the fear of its spread which developed in Australia during the 1950s and early 1960s. As a consequence, Australia supported South Vietnam throughout the early 1960s. In 1961 and 1962, the leader of the South Vietnamese government, Ngo Dinh Diem, asked for assistance from the US and its allies in response to a growing insurgency supported by communist North Vietnam. Australia offered 30 military advisors from the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam, which became known simply as &quot;The Team&quot;. They arrived in July and August 1962, beginning Australia&#x27;s involvement in the war. Later in August 1964, the RAAF sent a flight of Caribou transport aircraft to the port city of Vung Tau.

However, with the security situation in South Vietnam continuing to deteriorate, the US increased its involvement to 200,000 combat troops by early 1965. Australia also committed ground forces, dispatching the 1 RAR to serve with the US 173rd Airborne Brigade in Bien Hoa province in June 1965 and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions, including Gang Toi, Operation Crimp and Suoi Bong Trang. In March 1966, the Australian government announced the deployment of a brigade-sized unit—the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—to replace 1 RAR. Included were a large number of conscripts, under the increasingly controversial National Service Scheme. Consisting of two infantry battalions as well as armour, aviation, artillery and other support arms, the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at Nui Dat, in Phuoc Tuy Province. Included were the Iroquois helicopters of No. 9 Squadron RAAF. At the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966, D Company, 6 RAR with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a Viet Cong force that was at least six times bigger than itself. 18 Australians were killed and 24 wounded, while 245 communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield. The battle allowed the Australians to gain dominance over Phuoc Tuy Province and 1 ATF was not fundamentally challenged again. Regardless, during February 1967 the Australians suffered their heaviest casualties in the war to that point, losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week, the bulk during Operation Bribie.

Yet with the Phuoc Tuy province coming progressively under control throughout 1967, the Australians increasingly spent a significant period of time conducting operations further afield. 1 ATF was subsequently deployed astride infiltration routes leading to Saigon to interdict communist movement against the capital as part of Operation Coburg during the 1968 Tet Offensive and later during the Battle of Coral–Balmoral in May and June 1968. At Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral the Australians had clashed with regular North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength for the first time in near conventional warfare, ultimately fighting their largest, most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war. During 26 days of fighting Australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded, while communist casualties included 267 killed confirmed by body count, 60 possibly killed, 7 wounded and 11 captured. Other significant Australian actions included Binh Ba in June 1969, Hat Dich in late-December 1968 and early 1969 and Long Khanh in June 1971. At the height of the Australian commitment, 1 ATF numbered 8,500 troops, including three infantry battalions, armour, artillery, engineers, logistics and aviation units in support. A third RAAF unit, No. 2 Squadron RAAF, flying Canberra bombers, was sent in 1967, and four RAN destroyers joined US patrols in the waters off North Vietnam.

The Australian withdrawal effectively commenced in November 1970. As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, 8 RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty. 1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. Australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part of a phased withdrawal, and 1 ATF ceased operations in October. Meanwhile, the advisors remained to train South Vietnamese troops until withdrawn on 18 December 1972 by the newly elected Labor government of Gough Whitlam. The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973. The Vietnam War was Australia&#x27;s longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support, as the nation&#x27;s military involvement increased a vocal anti-war movement developed. More than 50,000 Australians served in Vietnam; 519 were killed and 2,398 were wounded. Four were awarded the Victoria Cross.

===Post-Vietnam era===

====Creation of the Australian Defence Force, 1976====
Although the importance of &#x27;joint&#x27; warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co-ordination between the services in the post-war era, with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine. The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military&#x27;s experiences in the Vietnam War. In 1973, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur Tange, submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff.

The Whitlam Labor Government subsequently amalgamated the five defence ministries (Defence, Navy, Army, Air Force, and Supply) into a single Department of Defence in 1973, while conscription under the National Service scheme was abolished. On 1 January 1976, the three branches of the Australian military were brought together as a unified, all-volunteer, professional force known as the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Today, the ADF is headquartered at Russell Offices in Canberra and is divided into Air, Land, Maritime and Special Operations Commands. In addition, Northern Command is based in Darwin, and is responsible for operations in Northern Australia.

====Defence of Australia, 1980s and 1990s====
Until the 1970s, Australia&#x27;s military strategy centred on the concept of &quot;Forward Defence&quot;, in which the role of Australian military and naval forces were to co-operate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia&#x27;s region. Following the adoption of the Guam Doctrine by the United States in 1969, and the British withdrawal &#x27;east of Suez&#x27; in the early 1970s, Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self-reliance and the defence of the Australian continent. Known as the Defence of Australia Policy, it focused Australian defence planning on protecting the nation&#x27;s northern maritime approaches (the &#x27;air-sea gap&#x27;) against possible attack.

In line with this goal, the ADF was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. This was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the RAN and RAAF, and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia. During this time the ADF had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia. However, in 1987 the ADF made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the 1987 Fijian coups d&#x27;état. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.

During this period Australia continued to retain forces in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) agreed in 1971 to defend it in the event of external attack, with this commitment initially including significant air, ground and naval forces. However, these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in 1973, and the two Mirage fighter squadrons in 1988. Since then a detachment of Orion maritime patrol aircraft, support personnel, and an infantry company known as Rifle Company Butterworth have been maintained, as well as occasional deployments of F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft. Australian submarines reportedly undertook a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout Asian waters in the last decades of the Cold War. Airforce and Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region. Since then the Orions have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of Operation Gateway, conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean, Strait of Malacca and South China Sea. They have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights.

====Gulf War, 1991====
Australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War, deploying a naval task group of two warships, a support ship and a clearance diving team; in total about 750 personnel. The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure. However, the Australian force did not see combat, and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait. Some ADF personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat, and a few were later decorated for their actions. Following the war, the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq. A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with US and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no-fly zones imposed over Iraq between 1991 and 2003.

===Global security, late-1990s===
Since the late 1980s, the Australian government had increasingly called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to Namibia in early 1989, Cambodia between 1992 and 1993, Somalia in 1993, Rwanda between 1994 and 1995 and Bougainville in 1994 and from 1997 onwards. The 1996 election of the Howard Liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the ADF&#x27;s force structure and role, with the new government&#x27;s defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia&#x27;s allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia&#x27;s global security interests. In line with this new focus, the ADF&#x27;s force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the ADF&#x27;s combat effectiveness.

===New Millennium===

====East Timor, 1999–2013====
The former-Portuguese colony of East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975, however, following years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President B.J. Habibie subsequently agreed to allow the East Timorese to vote on autonomy in 1999. The United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) was established to organise and conduct the vote, which was held at the end of August 1999 and resulted with 78.5% of voters deciding in favour of independence. However, following the announcement of the results pro-Indonesian militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military, launched a campaign of violence, looting and arson and many East Timorese were killed, while perhaps more than 500,000 were displaced. Unable to control the violence, Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force. Australia, which had contributed police to UNAMET, organised and led an international military coalition, known as the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET), a non-UN force operating in accordance with UN resolutions. The total size of the Australian force committed numbered 5,500 personnel, and included a significant ground force, supported by air and naval forces, in the largest single deployment of Australian forces since 1945.

Under the overall command of Australian Major General Peter Cosgrove, INTERFET began arriving on 12 September 1999 and was tasked with restoring peace and security, protecting and supporting UNAMET, and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations. With the withdrawal of the Indonesian armed forces, police and government officials from East Timor, UNAMET re-established its headquarters in Dili on 28 September. On 19 October 1999, Indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a UN peacekeeping force, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) was established, becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence. The hand-over of command of military operations from INTERFET to UNTAET was completed on 28 February 2000. Australia continued to support the UN peacekeeping operation with between 1,500 and 2,000 personnel, as well as landing craft and Blackhawk helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission. During these operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro-Indonesian militia and on a number of occasions Indonesian forces as well, especially along the border with West Timor. Significant actions occurred in Suai, Mota&#x27;ain and at Aidabasalala in October 1999. However, with the security situation stabilised the bulk of the Australian and UN forces were withdrawn by 2005. Two Australians died from non-battle related causes, while a number were wounded in action.

The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF&#x27;s ability to conduct operations outside Australia. This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF&#x27;s ability to mount and sustain such operations. In response, the 2000 Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Australian government committed to improve the ADF&#x27;s capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF to 57,000 full-time personnel and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3% per year.

In May 2006, 2,000 ADF personnel were again deployed to East Timor as part of Operation Astute, following unrest between elements of the Timor Leste Defence Force. Australian forces were involved in a number skirmishes during this time, including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by Alfredo Reinado at Same on 4 March 2007. However, by early-2010 the security situation had been stabilised and just 400 Australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force. Following a drawdown, the International Stabilisation Force commenced withdrawing from Timor-Leste in November 2012, a process which was completed in April 2013.

====Afghanistan, 2001–2021====
Shortly after the Islamist inspired terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on 11 September 2001, Australian forces were committed to the American-led international coalition against terrorism. The ADF&#x27;s most visible contribution—codenamed Operation Slipper—has been a special forces task group operating in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2002 and again from mid-2005 to fight against the Taliban. Over time the Australian commitment has grown, with the addition of further ground forces in the form of a Reconstruction Task Force from 2006 to provide security, reconstruction and to mentor and train the Afghan National Army. Australia has also contributed a frigate and two AP-3C Orion surveillance aircraft and three C-130 Hercules transport aircraft to international operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean since 2001, supporting both the operations in Afghanistan and those in Iraq under Operation Catalyst. A detachment of four F/A-18 Hornet fighter-bombers was based at Diego Garcia from late-2001 to mid-2002, while two Boeing 707 air-to-air refuelling aircraft were also based in Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan to provide support to coalition aircraft operating in Afghan airspace but were later withdrawn. A Special Operations Task Group was deployed to support the Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007. In addition to radar crews, logistics and intelligence officers, and security personnel, this brought the number of Australian personnel in Afghanistan to 950 by mid-2007, with further small increases to 1,000 in mid-2008, 1,100 in early 2009 and 1,550 in mid-2009.

A modest force remained in Afghanistan over this time and was involved in counter-insurgency operations in Uruzgan Province in conjunction United States and other coalition forces, including the Dutch prior to their withdrawal. The force consisted of motorised infantry, special forces, engineers, cavalry, artillery and aviation elements. By 2010 it included a combined arms battalion-sized battle group known as the Mentoring Task Force, and the Special Operations Task Group, both based at Forward Operation Base Ripley outside of Tarin Kowt, as well as the Rotary Wing Group flying CH-47D Chinooks, the Force Logistics Asset and an RAAF air surveillance radar unit based in Kandahar. In addition, a further 800 Australian logistic personnel were also based in the Middle East in support, but located outside of Afghanistan. Meanwhile, detachments of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, based out of Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates. Also included was one of the RAN&#x27;s frigates deployed to the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden on counter piracy and maritime interdiction duties.

Australian forces were at times involved in heavy fighting, and significant actions included Operation Anaconda in 2002 and Operation Perth in 2006, as well as actions in Chora in 2007, Kakarak in 2009, the Shah Wali Kot and Derapet in 2010, and Doan in 2011; although others have yet to be publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements. Casualties include 41 killed and 256 wounded, while another Australian also died serving with the British Army. Four Australians have been awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia, the first such decorations in forty years. Following a drawdown in forces, the last combat troops were withdrawn on 15 December 2013; however, approximately 400 personnel remain in Afghanistan as trainers and advisers, and are stationed in Kandahar and Kabul. Over 26,000 Australian personnel have served in Afghanistan.

In November 2020, a report for the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force by Major General Paul Brereton, a New South Wales Court of Appeal judge, found credible information that 25 current or former members of the ADF were involved in, or accessories to, the murder of 39 Afghan prisoners and civilians, and the cruel treatment of two others. None of these matters occurred in the &quot;heat of battle&quot;. Brereton&#x27;s inquiry took four and a half years to complete, and involved the interviewing of 423 witnesses, the examination of more than 20,000 documents and 25,000 images, regarding conduct in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016. It recommended that 36 incidents be referred to the AFP for criminal investigation. The report, released in heavily redacted form on 19 November by the Chief of the Defence Force, General Angus Campbell. Campbell offered an apology for &quot;any wrongdoing by Australian soldiers&quot;, and highlighted that the matters predominantly involved the SASR. He summarised the report by saying that &quot;It is alleged that some patrols took the law into their own hands, rules were broken, stories concocted, lies told and prisoners killed&quot;, and said that practices developed in order to conceal deliberate unlawful killings. On 26 November, it was reported that Defence had commenced administrative action against at least 10 serving members of the SASR, issuing them with &quot;show cause&quot; notices for their dismissal.

====Iraq, 2003–11====

Australian forces later joined British and American forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The initial contribution was also a modest one, consisting of just 2,058 personnel—codenamed Operation Falconer. Major force elements included special forces, rotary and fixed wing aviation and naval units. Army units included elements from the SASR and 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Commando), a CH-47 Chinook detachment and a number of other specialist units. RAN units included the amphibious ship and the frigates and , while the RAAF deployed 14 F/A-18 Hornets from No. 75 Squadron, a number of AP-3C Orions and C-130 Hercules. The Australian Special Forces Task Force was one of the first coalition units forces to cross the border into Iraq, while for a few days, the closest ground troops to Baghdad were from the SASR. During the invasion the RAAF also flew its first combat missions since the Vietnam War, with No. 75 Squadron flying a total of 350 sorties and dropping 122 laser-guided bombs.

The Iraqi military quickly proved no match for coalition military power, and with their defeat the bulk of Australian forces were withdrawn. While Australia did not initially take part in the post-war occupation of Iraq, an Australian Army light armoured battlegroup—designated the Al Muthanna Task Group and including 40 ASLAV light armoured vehicles and infantry—was later deployed to Southern Iraq in April 2005 as part of Operation Catalyst. The role of this force was to protect the Japanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of New Iraqi Army units. The AMTG later became the Overwatch Battle Group (West) (OBG(W)), following the hand back of Al Muthanna province to Iraqi control. Force levels peaked at 1,400 personnel in May 2007 including the OBG(W) in Southern Iraq, the Security Detachment in Baghdad and the Australian Army Training Team—Iraq. A RAN frigate was based in the North Persian Gulf, while RAAF assets included C-130H Hercules and AP-3C elements. Following the election of a new Labor government under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid-2009, while RAAF and RAN operations were redirected to other parts of the Middle East Area of Operations as part of Operation Slipper.

Low-level operations continued, however, with a small Australian force of 80 soldiers remaining in Iraq to protect the Australian Embassy in Baghdad as part of SECDET under Operation Kruger. SECDET was finally withdrawn in August 2011, and was replaced by a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for Australia&#x27;s diplomatic presence in Iraq. Although more than 17,000 personnel served during operations in Iraq, Australian casualties were relatively light, with two soldiers accidentally killed, while a third Australian died serving with the British Royal Air Force. A further 27 personnel were wounded. Two officers remained in Iraq attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq as part of Operation Riverbank. This operation concluded in November 2013.

====Military intervention against ISIL, 2014–present====
In June 2014 a small number of SASR personnel were deployed to Iraq to protect the Australian embassy when the security of Baghdad was threatened by the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive. Later, in August and September a number of RAAF C-17 and C-130J transport aircraft based in the Middle East were used to conduct airdrops of humanitarian aid to trapped civilians and to airlift arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. In late September 2014 an Air Task Group (ATG) and Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) were deployed to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates as part of the coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. Equipped with F/A-18F Super Hornet strike aircraft, a KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport, and an E-7A Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control aircraft, the ATG began operations on 1 October. The SOTG is tasked with operations to advise and assist Iraqi Security Forces, and was deployed to Iraq after a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments. It began moving into Iraq in early November. In April 2015 a 300-strong unit known as Task Group Taji was deployed to Iraq to train the regular Iraqi Security Forces. In September 2015 airstrikes were extended to Syria. Strike missions concluded in December 2017.

==Peacekeeping and humanitarian relief operations==
Australia&#x27;s involvement in international peacekeeping operations has been diverse, and included participation in both United Nations sponsored missions, as well as those as part of ad hoc coalitions. Australians have been involved in more conflicts as peacekeepers than as belligerents; however &quot;in comparative international terms, Australia has only been a moderately energetic peacekeeper.&quot; Although Australia has had peacekeepers in the field continuously for 60 years—being among the first group of UN military observers in Indonesia in 1947—its commitments have generally been limited, consisting mostly of small numbers of high-level and technical support troops such as signallers, engineers, medics, observers, and police. One significant commitment has been Australia&#x27;s ongoing involvement with the long running Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai. The operational tempo started increasing in the mid-1990s, when Australia became involved in a series of high-profile operations, deploying significantly larger combat units in support of a number of missions including Cambodia, Rwanda, Somalia, East Timor, and the Solomon Islands. Australia has been involved in close to 100 separate missions, involving more than 30,000 personnel; 14 Australians have died during these operations. In addition, approximately 7,000 personnel have been involved in 66 different overseas humanitarian relief operations between 1918 and 2006. Eleven personnel lost their lives during these missions.

<doc id="1323520" wikidata="Q4026902" url="?curid=1323520" title="Night Call (The Twilight Zone)">
<text>&quot;Night Call&quot; is a 1964 episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; directed by Jacques Tourneur. The story follows an elderly woman, played by Gladys Cooper, who receives persistent disturbing phone calls from an anonymous caller. The episode is based on Richard Matheson&#x27;s short story &quot;Sorry, Right Number&quot; which appeared in the November 1953 issue of &quot;Beyond Fantasy Fiction&quot;. The title was changed to &quot;Long Distance Call&quot; when the story was anthologized. The story ends differently than the TV episode.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
An elderly paraplegic woman, Elva Keene, receives strange anonymous phone calls in the middle of a stormy night. During the first calls she hears only static. Later she hears a man moaning and she repeatedly demands to know who is calling. The man continues to call and keeps repeating &quot;Hello?&quot; over and over. Finally he says, &quot;Hello? Where are you? I want to talk to you.&quot; Elva, terrified, screams at the man to leave her alone.

Elva calls a phone company, who traces the calls to a telephone line that has fallen in a cemetery. Elva and her housekeeper visit the cemetery where she finds that the line is resting on the grave of her long-deceased fiancé, Brian Douglas. Elva says that she always insisted on having her own way, and Brian always did what she said. Brian died a week before they were to be married. That day, she insisted on driving, lost control of the car and hit a tree. The accident killed Brian and rendered her paraplegic.

Now that she can talk to him again, she realizes won&#x27;t have to be alone. At home, she picks up the phone and calls to Brian&#x27;s ghost, pleading with him to answer. He replies that she told him to leave her alone and that he always does what she says. Then the line goes dead, leaving Elva alone and crying in her bed.

==Closing narration==
==Notes==
The caller is never identified in the original short story. The night after she finds out the voice is coming from the cemetery, she receives a call in which the voice says: &quot;Hello, Mrs. Keene. I&#x27;ll be right over.&quot; The short story creates a heightened level of horror because the unknown speaker on the phone gradually improves in cognition and speech to the point where they seek to interact with her physically, conjuring up images of the walking dead and reanimated corpses.

The original anthologized short story title, &quot;Long Distance Call&quot;, was changed to &quot;Night Call&quot; because there had already been an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; in 1961 with that title.

The premiere of &quot;Night Call&quot; was scheduled for Friday, November 22, 1963. Hours before it was to air, however, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. It was rescheduled, as were all of the other network shows. &quot;Night Call&quot; finally premiered on February 7, 1964.

<doc id="1323527" wikidata="Q337728" url="?curid=1323527" title="Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst">
<text>Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst, (16 November 168416 September 1775), of Bathurst in the County of Sussex, known as The Lord Bathurst from 1712 to 1772, was a British Tory politician. Bathurst sat in the English and British House of Commons from 1705 until 1712 and then in the British House of Lords until his death in 1775, after being raised to the peerage as Baron Bathurst.

== Early life ==
Bathurst was the eldest son and heir of Sir Benjamin Bathurst, and his wife, Frances Apsley, daughter of Sir Allen Apsley, of Apsley, Pulborough, Sussex, and Frances daughter of John Petre of Bowhay, Devon. He belonged to a family which is said to have settled in Sussex before the Norman Conquest. He was born in St James&#x27;s Square, Westminster and christened at St James&#x27;s Church in the precincts of the royal palace. His father was heavily involved in the slave trade through the Royal African Company and the East India Company, and through this accumulated enough wealth to endow all three of his sons with landed estates. Allen Bathurst inherited Cirencester Park from his father, and built the present house between 1714 and 1718.

Bathurst matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 13 May 1700. He succeeded his father on 27 April 1704. In July 1704, he married his first cousin Catherine Apsley, daughter of Sir Peter Apsley and his wife Catherine Fortrey, daughter of Samuel Fortrey and sister of William Fortrey.

== Parliament ==
At the 1705 English general election, Bathurst was elected Member of Parliament for the borough of Cirencester in the Country Tory interest. At the 1708 British general election, he was returned again for Cirencester but the election was declared void on 10 December 1709. He was returned again in the contested re-election on 23 December 1709. At the 1710 British general election, he was returned in a contest without problems. He was highly active under the Tory administration. On 1 January 1712, as one of eleven others he was raised to the peerage by Queen Anne as Baron Bathurst, of Battlesden in the County of Bedford and vacated his seat in the House of Commons to sit in the House of Lords.

As a zealous Tory he defended Francis Atterbury, Bishop of Rochester, and in the House of Lords was an opponent of Sir Robert Walpole. Careful never to engage in Jacobite plots, for example, he condemned Sir John Fenwick&#x27;s conspiracy, Bathurst remained largely remote from politics during Walpole&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister. 

After Walpole left office, Bathurst was made a Privy Councillor on 13 July 1742 and served as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen Pensioners from 1742 to 1744. He was subsequently appointed Treasurer to Frederick, Prince of Wales after the heir to the throne had fallen out with King George II and been banned from Kensington Palace. Bathurst was responsible for managing the Prince&#x27;s chaotic finances until his death in 1751. Upon the accession of George III, Frederick&#x27;s son, as King in 1760, Bathurst secured an annual pension of £2,000 on the heavily taxed Irish establishment.

In August 1772, 60 years after he was elevated to the peerage, Bathurst was created Earl Bathurst, of Bathurst in the County of Sussex, with remainder to the heirs male of his body

== Artistic interests ==
Apart from his political career, Lord Bathurst is also known for his association with the poets and scholars of the time. Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, Matthew Prior, Laurence Sterne, and William Congreve were among his friends.

In 1719 he was one of the original backers of the Royal Academy of Music, establishing a London opera company which commissioned numerous works from Handel, Bononcini and others.

Bathurst&#x27;s name is listed as a founding governor on the royal charter of the Foundling Hospital, granted by King George II in 1739. He is described in Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Letters to Eliza&quot;; was the subject of a graceful reference on the part of Burke speaking in the House of Commons; and the letters which passed between him and Pope are published in &quot;Pope&#x27;s Works&quot;, vol. viii. (London, 1872).

== Later life and legacy ==
Lord Bathurst&#x27;s wife, Catherine, died in 1768. He survived her by seven years and died in September 1775, aged 90. He was buried in Cirencester church. They had four sons and five daughters, including Frances, wife of the future MP William Wodehouse. His son Henry succeeded him in the earldom, having already been created Lord Apsley in 1771 on his appointment as Lord Chancellor.

Bathurst&#x27;s sister was the mother of Admiral Sir Thomas Pye. His brother Henry Bathurst served as Bishop of Norwich and his niece was Caroline de Crespigny, a poet who some claim to be one of Lord Byron&#x27;s many mistresses.

<text>DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution 6thMix is the 6th game in the &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; series of music video games. It was released in the arcades by &quot;Konami&quot; in 2001 and for the PlayStation 2 on May 16, 2002, in Japan. &quot;6thMix&quot; contains a total of 42 songs, all which made their first arcade appearance on this release. 11 of these songs debuted in various console releases prior to &quot;6thMix&quot;. All arcade songs from &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; to &quot;Dance Dance Revolution 5thMix&quot; were removed in &quot;6thMix&quot;, although many of the Konami originals from those games would later be revived in future arcade releases.

==Gameplay==

The interface used is a recoloring and smoothing of the song wheel interface first introduced in &quot;Dance Dance Revolution 5thMix&quot;, with the addition of changeable sort settings and a longer time limit. Core gameplay remained mostly the same on &quot;6thMix&quot; and &quot;7thMix&quot;, with the addition of Freeze Arrows and a new scoring system:

Freeze Arrows appear as green arrows with a long extension. If they are held for the entire length successfully, a &quot;O.K.&quot; is scored. If it is not held down for the entire length, a &quot;N.G.&quot; (no good) is scored. Freezes affect the life bar. Scores are calculated with 2 distinct scoring systems, the long-score system used to determine rankings, and an independent dance point system (known on later games as EX SCORE) now used to determine the grade.

All songs have a long-score ceiling of 50 million points, and a bonus score is tacked onto it based on the difficulty of the song and other factors. Rankings are given for the highest long-score accumulations a round. If a player plays more than three songs, then it only counts the last three played. If a song is played repeatedly among the three songs used for ranking, then the repeated songs carry no bonus score.

The dance-point system uses raw step values to determine the grade. A &#x27;perfect&#x27; step adds two points, a &#x27;great&#x27; step adds one point, a &#x27;good&#x27; step is worth nothing, a &#x27;boo&#x27; step takes away four points, and a &#x27;miss&#x27; step takes away eight points. An &#x27;O.K.&#x27; freeze adds six points, and an &#x27;N.G.&#x27; freeze is worth nothing. The dance points are also tied to the life bar. As always, if a player takes too many bad steps and depletes the life bar, they will fail, and the game will end immediately. If the first song is in Light mode, then the game will allow a player to fail that song and continue, but will fail the player out if they fail a second song. In two-player games, if one player fails, they can continue dancing, but it ceases to accumulate dance points for the failed player, accumulates score points at only 10 points per step, and automatically gives the failed player an &#x27;E&#x27; for the song.

The grade is dependent on the number of dance points accumulated: 100% dance points is &#x27;AAA&#x27;, at least 93% is &#x27;AA&#x27;, at least 80% is &#x27;A&#x27;, at least 65% is &#x27;B&#x27;, at least 45% is &#x27;C&#x27; and anything below 45% is a &#x27;D&#x27;. If a net dance-point total of zero is obtained without depleting the life bar and, thus, failing, an &#x27;E&#x27; is awarded. The final grade for the entire game is an average of the grades from the last three songs and not derived from the actual dance points scored.

This 2-tiered scoring system is still utilized on DDRMax2, though the long-score system is reformed. For the long-score system in DDRMax2, it now has a maximum for each song of 10,000,000 multiplied by the foot rating for the routine. Maximum scores can range from 10 million to 100 million for individual songs. Bonus scores are abolished, though the new long-score system tends to be weighted so that errors early in a routine are not as costly as errors late. The dance point system, which determines grade, remains unchanged. This scoring system would be kept for Dance Dance Revolution Extreme.

&quot;6thMix&quot; was intended to be the Next Generation of Dance Dance Revolution. As such, there are many changes. First, the difficulty levels were renamed. &#x27;Basic&#x27; was renamed &#x27;Light&#x27;, &#x27;Trick&#x27; was named &#x27;Standard&#x27;, and &#x27;Maniac&#x27; was named &#x27;Heavy&#x27;. They are also given Japanese difficulty names in conjunction: 楽 (&quot;raku&quot;), 踊 (&quot;you&quot;), and 激 (&quot;geki&quot;), respectively. Their color codes—orange, fuchsia and green, respectively—remain the same. Also, all songs from previous versions have been removed in 6thMix (although the prototype version of this game had some songs from previous DDR versions), intending the game to start from scratch. Many past songs do return on 7thMix and later releases, however.

===Interface and graphics===
Dancing characters have been removed in 6thMix, 7thMix and Extreme. Instead, the arrows scroll over clips of full motion video, hence the game does not render any polygons. The screen refreshes at a full speed of 60 frames per second. In addition, the arrows themselves have been tweaked too, now having a rounded edge on their outer tip rather than the V-shaped cut used in all previous games.

These games retain the Song Wheel interface introduced in 5thMix, but add an easier method to enter modifiers. In previous versions, modifiers like &quot;Sudden&quot; or &quot;Shuffle&quot; required a combination of dance steps. Beginning in 6thMix, a player only needs to hold the Start button when they select a song to bring up a full menu of available modifiers, including the ability to speed up or slow down the scrolling of arrows, and a final chance to select the song difficulty they wish to play.

===Modifiers===
A new options menu accessed by holding down the Start button when selecting a song debuted on 6thMix, and is retained on future mixes.

Some of the available modifiers include Speed mods, which change the arrow speed. Boost, which causes the arrows to accelerate as they near the step zone, Appearance, which changes the appearance of the arrows. Turn mods modify the stepchart itself, Other affects the difficulty of the steps, Scroll changes the scroll direction of the arrows, and Freeze Arrows can also be turned off.

===Extra Stage===
New to 6thMix is the &quot;Extra Stage&quot;, where players are rewarded for meeting conditions set by the game. If a AA is scored on the final stage on Heavy mode, a message inviting the player to &quot;Try Extra Stage&quot; is shown instead of the Cleared graphic. For the Extra Stage, the song wheel is locked on &quot;MAX 300&quot;, and the song is played with several forced modifiers, including 1.5x speed and Reverse. The song is also played in Pressure mode, where the dance gauge starts filled, and can only go down.

If the player scores a AA or higher on the Extra Stage the game again rewards them with &quot;One More Extra Stage&quot;. This time, the song wheel is locked to &quot;CANDY☆&quot;, an easier song but with more difficult Modifiers. The exact same modifiers are used, but the song is played in Sudden Death mode, where any step judgment which breaks a combo immediately ends the game. If the player clears the song with a full combo (which is the only way to do so in Sudden Death mode), a special credits movie is shown. When this second Boss Song is passed for the first time it too will be unlocked for normal play, also displayed on the Song Wheel in red.

===Link data===
Some machines have the ports to insert PlayStation memory cards. Such memory cards have to be original PlayStation (not PS2) memory cards with Link Data from the home version of DDR 5thMix (the home version of 6thMix cannot create arcade-compatible Link Data). 5thMix can create two different kinds of arcade link data; the Link Data file for 6thMix is known as &quot;New Version&quot; Link Data and is forward-compatible with 7thMix arcade machines as well. Link Data serves two primary purposes: Score-saving and Internet Ranking. The user can save his or her scores from arcade performances, and whenever the game is played in the future, the arcade game will load the scores for each user and show them on the song-selection screen to show the player&#x27;s best performances. These scores can also be viewed at home with 5thMix. 6thMix also provides Internet Ranking codes based on the user&#x27;s performance in a given set of songs. As with all of Konami&#x27;s Internet Ranking events, the website for the game would allow users to enter in a generated password which contains their initials and scores for that session, and the website would display the rankings for those who have submitted codes. Link Data saves these passwords so that they may be entered much more conveniently.

The arcade game can exchange custom stepchart data with 6thMix, as well as any earlier version that has songs that are in 6thMix, though this requires special steps to be taken in 6thMix to write a PlayStation-formatted save file, which must then be copied to the PlayStation memory card by the user.

==Release==

===Home versions===
The home version of &quot;DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution 6thMix&quot; was released in Japan on May 16, 2002, for the Sony PlayStation 2 video game console. It featured all 42 songs from the arcade version as well as two additional console-exclusive songs &quot;Kind Lady&quot; and &quot;So In Love&quot;. 6thMix&#x27;s hidden songs can be unlocked automatically, without additional play, by accessing its save data on home versions of &quot;DDRMAX2 Dance Dance Revolution 7thMix&quot; or &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Extreme&quot;.

DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution, with the mix number omitted, is the home version released in North America for the PlayStation 2 video game console. The North American version is considerably different from the Japanese version. It displays song difficulties using the traditional foot-rating system and the Groove Radar in tandem.

<text>Donkey Kong Land 2 is a platform video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. It is the sequel to the 1995 Game Boy game &quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot; and is part of the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; video game series. It was released worldwide in late 1996. It was enhanced for the Super Game Boy with different shades of color, as well as a 16-bit banana border on the edges of the television screen. Like the original &quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot;, it came packaged in a banana-yellow cartridge. The game was followed by &quot;Donkey Kong Land III&quot;, which was released in 1997.

The game has since been re-released via the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console and Nintendo Switch Online.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; described the game as a conversion of &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot;.

== Plot ==
&quot;Donkey Kong Land 2&quot; stars Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong in their quest to rescue Donkey Kong from Kaptain K. Rool and the Kremling Krew. While its stage names and world themes are borrowed from &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; (except for Castle Crush, which became Dungeon Danger, and Haunted Hall, which became Krazy Koaster), the level designs are different.

&quot;Donkey Kong Land 2&quot; had the same storyline from &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot;. The manual contains a simplified version of the story from its SNES counterpart - K. Rool has kidnapped Donkey Kong and is at Crocodile Isle, and it&#x27;s up to Diddy and Dixie to save him.

== Reception ==
&quot;Donkey Kong Land 2&quot; is rated at 79.00% at GameRankings based on five reviews. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; praised the gameplay and graphics but criticized the similarities between the levels and those of &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; was positive to the game&#x27;s side-scrolling action, hidden areas, music, and graphics.

&quot;Nintendojo&quot; gave the game 8.5 out of 10, but was critical to its save system. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; gave the Virtual Console re-release a 7 out of 10, praising the amount of content Rare managed to cram into the game but criticizing it for being similar to Diddy&#x27;s SNES version.

By 1997, 1.5 million units had been sold worldwide.

<text>Visa for Avalon is a 1965 novel by Bryher. It was re-released by Paris Press in 2004 with a new introduction by Susan McCabe.

==Plot summary==
During a fishing vacation to Trelawney in an unidentified country, Mr. Robinson (his first name is never given) receives word that the &quot;Movement&quot;, a protest group with the tacit approval of the government, is planning a General Strike. Mr. Robinson&#x27;s landlady, Mrs. Blunt, is given notice that the government is claiming her land as eminent domain. The pressures of mass industrialization and scattered reports of Movement activity lead Robinson, Blunt, Alex, Mr. Lawson, and Sheila Willis to seek refuge in the country of &quot;Avalon&quot; before the borders are closed for good. Avalon is not specifically identified in the story; only a glimpse is seen of white sandy beaches there at the book&#x27;s end.

<text>Luton Hoo is an English country house and estate near Luton in Bedfordshire and Harpenden in Hertfordshire. Most of the estate lies within the civil parish of Hyde, Bedfordshire. The Saxon word means the spur of a hill, and is more commonly associated with East Anglia.

==History==
===Pre-1762===
The manor of Luton Hoo is not mentioned in the Domesday Book, but a family called de Hoo occupied a manor house on the site for four centuries, until the death of Thomas Hoo, 1st Baron Hoo and Hastings in 1455. The manor passed into the marital family of his daughter, Anne, married to William Boleyn, great-grandfather of Anne Boleyn, Queen of England. Anne&#x27;s father, Thomas Boleyn, eventually sold the property to Richard Fermour, a wealthy London Merchant.It then passed to the Rotherham family and then the Napier family. Successive houses were built on the site. In 1751, Francis Herne, a member of parliament MP for Bedford, inherited the house from his kinswoman Miss Napier.

===Crichton-Stuart===
In 1763, Francis Herne sold the estate for £94,700 to the 3rd Earl of Bute. Following an unhappy period as Prime Minister from 1762 to 1763, Lord Bute decided to concentrate his energies on his estate at Luton Hoo.

The present house was built by the 3rd Earl of Bute to the designs of the neoclassical architect Robert Adam. Work commenced in 1767. The original plan had been for a grand and magnificent new house, but the plan was never fully executed and much of the work was a remodelling of the older house. Building work was interrupted by a fire in 1771 but by 1774 the house, though incomplete, was inhabited. Dr. Samuel Johnson, who visited the house in 1781, remarked: &quot;This is one of the places I do not regret coming to see... in the house magnificence is not sacrificed to convenience, nor convenience to magnificence&quot;.

Luton Hoo was one of the largest houses for which Adam was wholly responsible. While Adam was working on the mansion, the landscape gardener Capability Brown was enlarging and redesigning the park, which was enlarged from about to . Brown dammed the River Lea to form two lakes, one of which is in size. In the early 20th century, part of the park overlooked by the south-west facade of the house was transformed into formal gardens.

In about 1830, the 2nd Marquess of Bute, grandson of the 3rd Earl, transformed the house, to the designs of the architect Robert Smirke (later Sir Robert, 1781–1867), a leading architect of the era. Smirke redesigned the house (with the exception of the south front) to resemble its present form today, complete with a massive portico, similar to that designed by Adam but never built. His early work and domestic designs, such as that at Eastnor Castle, were often in a medieval style; he seems to have reserved his Greek revival style for public buildings such as the British Museum. Luton Hoo, neither gothic nor strictly Greek revival, is an unusual example of him using a classical style for domestic use, which perhaps he felt would be sympathetic to Adam&#x27;s original conception.

Another addition was the neo-Gothic lodge with Tudor-style windows, and a Norman-style door, imported from an older building. Known as &#x27;Lady Bute&#x27;s Lodge&#x27; it is a Grade II listed building.

In 1843, a devastating fire destroyed much of the house and its contents. The house remained a burnt-out shell until after 1848, when the estate was sold to John Shaw Leigh.

===Leigh===


In 1848, the estate with the burnt-out house was purchased by John Shaw Leigh (d.1871), a Liverpool solicitor and property speculator, Mayor of Liverpool in 1841, whose family originated in Lipton, in Lancashire. He married Hannah Blundell-Hollinshead, a daughter of Henry Blundell (1755–1832), Mayor of Liverpool in 1791–1794 and in 1807, owner of Orrell, Blackrod and Pemberton collieries near Liverpool. His father, John Leigh, senior, was a solicitor and land agent to the Earl of Derby, the major landowner in the Liverpool area, but he also purchased much land in the area for himself on credit. John Leigh was the local agent of the Tory politician Bamber Gascoyne (1758–1824) and secretary of the &quot;True Blue Club&quot;, a Tory political club formed in 1818, to support his election organisation. With the coming of the railways to Liverpool in the 1840s, the value of his holdings increased dramatically. It was remarked of John Leigh, Senior: 
:&quot;That he had a keen foresight beyond most of his contemporaries into the coming greatness of Liverpool there can be no doubt, but the actuality far exceeded his most sanguine expectations. The railway demands formed an element altogether outside of his calculations however shrewd...The Leighs carried a flair for the timely and well sited purchases of property to a remarkably high degree. And although no doubt their dealings with the railway companies on behalf of the great landowners they represented gave them both an unusual measure of inside information and a degree of monopoly control as vendors of land, the skill with which they made capital from these assets in the early railway age is unusual&quot;.

Leigh rebuilt the derelict shell in the style and manner of Smirke, rather than to Adam&#x27;s earlier plan. In about 1863 &quot;there was found a hoard of Roman coins near Luton, on the estate of John Shaw Leigh, Esq., of Luton Hoo. The coins, which must have been nearly a thousand in number, had been deposited in an imperfectly burnt urn composed of clay and pounded shell and consisted of denarii and small brass, ranging from the time of Caracalla to that of Claudius Gothicus&quot;. In 1871 the estate was inherited by his son John Gerard Leigh (1821–1875), who in 1872 married Eleanor Louisa Hawkes (d.1899), a daughter of Thomas Hawkes and widow of Hon. Humble Dudley Ward (1821–1870), a son of William Humble Ward, 10th Baron Ward of Birmingham. She was a close friend of the Prince of Wales. John Gerard Leigh died in 1875, only three years after his marriage, childless. He left his money to his wife Eleanor, together with a life-interest in Luton Hoo, with the remainder to his nephew Henry Leigh.

In 1883 Eleanor remarried to Christian Frederick de Falbe (1828–1896), the Danish ambassador to the United Kingdom, thus becoming known as &quot;Madame de Falbe&quot;. She entertained lavishly and during her tenure Luton Hoo began an association with the British royal family. It was in December 1891 that Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, grandson of Queen Victoria, and second in line of the British throne, proposed to his fiancée, Princess Mary of Teck, at Luton Hoo. Madame de Falbe died in 1899 when the estate reverted to her second husband&#x27;s nephew, Captain Henry Gerard Leigh (1856–1900), 1st Life Guards, who in 1886 had married Marion Lindsay Antrobus, a daughter of Hugh Lindsay Antrobus. He died one year after having inherited Luton Hoo, leaving an 11-year-old son Lt-Col. John Cecil Gerard Leigh (1889–1963), on whose behalf in 1903 Luton Hoo was sold to Sir Julius Wernher, the diamond magnate, who had rented it since 1899. John Leigh later lived at Thorp Satchville Hall, Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.

===Wernher===
In 1903 the house was bought by Sir Julius Wernher, who had made his fortune from the diamond mines of South Africa. Wernher remodelled the interior to the designs of Charles Mewes and Arthur Joseph Davis, the architects of the Ritz Hotel in London. It was at this time that the mansard roof was added, to increase the amount of staff accommodation. This alteration, coupled with the newly installed casement windows was in the Second Empire style of architecture.

The lavish redesigning of the interior in the belle epoque style resulted in a magnificent backdrop for Wernher&#x27;s famous art collection. The marble-walled dining room was designed to display Beauvais tapestries, while the newly installed curving marble staircase enveloped Bergonzoli&#x27;s statue &quot;The Love of Angels&quot;. At the centre of the house the massive Blue Hall displayed further tapestries, Louis XV furniture, and Sèvres porcelain. Sir Julius Wernher&#x27;s widow, later Lady Ludlow, added her collection of English porcelain to the treasures of the house.

The Wernhers&#x27; great art collection, equal to that of the Rothschilds, their near neighbours at Waddesdon Manor
in Buckinghamshire, was later further enhanced by the marriage of Harold Wernher, the son of Julius Wernher, to Anastasia de Torby, the morganatic daughter of a member of the former Russian Imperial family, generally known as &quot;Lady Zia&quot;. She brought to the collection an incomparable assembly of Renaissance enamels and Russian artefacts, including works by Peter Carl Fabergé, the Russian Imperial court jeweller. Many of the Fabergé items were stolen in the 1990s. For many years, the collection and the house were open to the public, with the house having undergone a major and hugely successful rejuvenation under the direction of Mrs Lucy Phillips, Lady Zia&#x27;s granddaughter-in-law, that brought back to life the Russian Chapel and opened up new areas of the house whilst also showcasing more of the Wernher collection.

During World War II the Wernher family allowed the house to serve as Headquarters Eastern Command. Luton Hoo&#x27;s estate was used as a tank testing ground for the Churchill tanks, which were produced in factories in the town of Luton.

The Wernhers, by virtue of Lady Zia&#x27;s sister Nadejda de Torby, were very close to Prince Philip, who along with the Queen, were frequent visitors to Luton Hoo both for public events and private visits. The royal couple spent a number of wedding anniversaries staying at Luton Hoo.

===Phillips===
Following Lady Zia&#x27;s death in 1977, the estate passed to her grandson Nicholas Harold Phillips, after whose death in 1991 the house and 1,059 acres were sold by his wife. The Phillips family, descendants of Sir Julius and Lady Alice Wernher, still retain ownership of a significant part of the historic estate running it successfully as a diversified business that is home to commercial and residential tenants as well as restoring the walled garden (see below) and one of the busiest non-studio filming locations in the country. Part of the collection, including works by Peter Paul Rubens, Titian and Bartolomé Bermejo, was also sold whilst a portion remains together and is now on permanent display at Ranger&#x27;s House in Greenwich, London.

In 1996 and 1997, the grounds were hired out for the Tribal Gathering dance music festival and again in 2005, but the latter event was cancelled due to the 7 July 2005 London bombings.

===Hotel===
The house was converted into a luxury hotel called the Luton Hoo Hotel, Golf, and Spa, which opened in October 2007. It has 228 bedrooms and suites. Part of the restoration project involved rebuilding the second floor of the house, which was included in the plans drawn up by the original architects. The owners, Elite Hotels, say that furnishings have been selected with the aim of restoring the house to its former glory. In December 2021 the hotel was sold to The Arora Group, a UK based hotel and property company.

==Walled garden==
Luton Hoo Estate also possesses a octagonal walled garden which was established by John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, in the late 1760s. Successive owners of the estate adapted the garden to match the changing fashions in gardens over the years. Numerous heated glasshouses were built by the Leigh family in the last quarter of the 19th century for the production of fruit and flowers. The largest of the glasshouses, built by the firm of Mackenzie and Moncur for Sir Julius and Lady Alice Wernher, is evidence of the extravagance of the Edwardian period. The garden underwent extensive restoration in 2001–2021, with the help of over 100 volunteers, and is open to visitors and tours every Wednesday from May to October.

==Film location==
Luton Hoo has appeared in many films including &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, &quot;Princess Caraboo&quot;, &quot;Wilde&quot;, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, &quot;Quills&quot;, &quot;Enigma&quot;, &quot;De-Lovely&quot; and &quot;Bright Young Things&quot;. In 2010 the historic farm buildings were used as a location for the John Landis film &quot;Burke &amp; Hare&quot;, and stood in for Bleeding Heart Yard in the BBC TV series &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; using sets designed originally for the BBC&#x27;s 2005 BAFTA award-winning &quot;Bleak House&quot;. On 13 and 14 October 2010, filming of the Steven Spielberg film &quot;War Horse&quot; took place at the Luton Hoo Estate. Luton Hoo stood in for Chequers, in the film &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot;. Luton Hoo was also used as a location in the 2020 Netflix film &quot;Enola Holmes&quot;. Both the 2017 Joss Whedon and 2021 Zack Snyder release of &quot;Justice League&quot; credit the estate. Luton Hoo Estate is one of the busiest non-studio locations in the country.

<text>The Golden Banana or Sun Belt is an area of higher population density lying between Cartagena in the west and Genoa in the east along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. 

The area runs along the Mediterranean coast, including the French cities of Nice, Marseille, Montpellier, and Perpignan, and the Spanish cities of Figueres, Barcelona and Valencia. It was defined by the &quot;Europe 2000&quot; report from the European Commission in 1995 similarly to the Blue Banana.

== Description ==
The region is characterized by its importance in activities related to information and communication technologies, in terms of quality of life and as a top travel destination. At any rate, the Golden Banana can also be understood as an extension of the Blue Banana over the Mediterranean arc. 

The golden banana has development axes extending into the area of the upper Adriatic around Trieste. This also relates to the trade flows of the maritime Silk Road or the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative and its developments to Central Europe.

<doc id="1323580" wikidata="Q736706" url="?curid=1323580" title="Taira no Tomomori">
<text> (1152–1185) was the son of Taira no Kiyomori, and one of the Taira Clan&#x27;s chief commanders in the Genpei War at the end of the Heian period of Japanese history.

He was victorious at the Battle of Uji in 1180. He also became successful in the Battle of Yahagigawa in 1181.

Tomomori was again victorious in the naval Battle of Mizushima two years later.

At the Battle of Dan-no-ura, when the Taira were decisively beaten by their rivals, Tomomori joined many of his fellow clan members in committing suicide. He tied an anchor to his feet and leapt into the sea.

Tomomori has become a popular subject for kabuki plays.

<doc id="1323590" wikidata="Q937629" url="?curid=1323590" title="National Medal of Technology and Innovation">
<text>The National Medal of Technology and Innovation (formerly the National Medal of Technology) is an honor granted by the President of the United States to American inventors and innovators who have made significant contributions to the development of new and important technology. The award may be granted to a specific person, to a group of people or to an entire organization or corporation. It is the highest honor the United States can confer to a US citizen for achievements related to technological progress.

== History ==
The National Medal of Technology was created in 1980 by the United States Congress under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act. It was a bipartisan effort to foster technological innovation and the technological competitiveness of the United States in the international arena. The first National Medals of Technology were issued in 1985 by then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan to 12 individuals and one company. Among the first recipients were Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, founders of Apple Computer. The medal has been awarded annually until 2015.

On August 9, 2007, President George Bush signed the America COMPETES (Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science) Act of 2007. The Act amended Section 16 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, changing the name of the Medal to the &quot;National Medal of Technology and Innovation&quot;.

== Award process ==

Each year the United States Patent and Trademark Office (previously the Technology Administration) under the U.S. Department of Commerce calls for the nomination of new candidates for the National Medal of Technology and Innovation. Candidates are nominated by their peers who have direct, first-hand knowledge of the candidates achievements. Candidates may be individuals, teams of individuals (up to 4), organizations or corporations. Individuals and all members of teams nominated must be U.S. citizens and organizations and corporations must be U.S.-owned (i.e. 50% of their assets or shares must be currently held by U.S. citizens).

All nominations are referred to the National Medal of Technology and Innovation Evaluation Committee, which issues recommendations to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce. All nominees selected as finalists through the merit review process will be subject to an FBI security check. Information collected through the security check may be considered in the final selection of winners. The Secretary of Commerce is then able to advise the President of the United States as to which candidates ought to receive the National Medal of Technology and Innovation. The new National Medal of Technology and Innovation laureates are then announced by the U.S. president once the final selections have been made.

== Laureates ==
, there have been more than 135 people and 12 companies recognized. Summarized here is a list of notable laureates and a summary of their accomplishments.

<text>Mathieu Michel Berson (born 23 February 1980) is a French former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Berson played for Nantes, Aston Villa, Auxerre, Levante, Toulouse, and Vannes before retiring in 2013. He was a member of the successful Nantes side that won the Coupe de France in 1999 and 2000, followed by the Division 1 title in 2001, and the Trophée des Champions in 2002.

Berson played youth football for France, playing a key role in their run to the final of the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship where they lost on penalties to Czechia&#x27;s U21 side.

==Career==
Berson began his career with Nantes and made his senior debut during the 1999–2000 season, going on to start in the victorious 2000 Coupe de France Final. The following campaign, Nantes were crowned champions of France for the eight time, with Berson making 29 league appearances. He also played as Nantes won the 2001 Trophée des Champions. Having featured for the club consistently over a four-year period, he was transferred to Premier League club Aston Villa in the summer of 2004. In January 2005, Villa signed Eric Djemba-Djemba in an attempt to replicate the successful partnership they had formed at Nantes, where they played 50 games together. However, six months later, Berson was back in France, having joined Auxerre on a season-long loan. In the summer of 2006, he was transferred to La Liga side Levante. He played regularly for the next two seasons before returning to France with Toulouse in 2008. Released by Toulouse in the summer of 2010 due to budget cuts, Berson remained without a club until signing a two-year contract with Vannes in June 2011.

<doc id="1323596" wikidata="Q3487005" url="?curid=1323596" title="Smith &amp; Wesson SW99">
<text>The SW99 rendition of the popular Walther P99 was the product of a joint collaboration between Smith &amp; Wesson and Walther. The modified receiver used in the SW99 is supplied by Walther and is manufactured in Germany. Smith &amp; Wesson manufactures the slide and barrel of the SW99 in the United States. Though there are slight variations in aesthetic design, the function of the SW99 is identical to its German-made counterpart.

==Description==
The Smith &amp; Wesson SW99 is a modern, polymer frame pistol that is nearly identical to the Walther P99. The SW99 features an internal striker, as opposed to the classical external hammer. It is chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum, .40 S&amp;W, and .45 ACP. The pistol lacks a manual safety; instead a de-cocking button is placed on the top rear section of the slide, which when actuated, places the firearm into double-action mode. This mechanism differs with each variation of the action as explained below. The SW99 features several safety features including a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide, a protruding, red-painted cocking indicator, and a drop safety. As with the P99, the cocking indicator does not protrude from the slide of the QA variant unless the weapon is fired, as it is in a constant partially cocked state. The SW99 also features a fully supported chamber design, which leaves no portion of the chambered round exposed. Because of this there is less chance of casing head rupture, reducing risk of injury to the shooter and/or destruction of the pistol.

The unique and ergonomic grip of this pistol was designed by the renowned Swiss match pistol grip designer, Cesare Morini. Much like the P99, the pistol comes with three varying rear grip inserts designed to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearm. Design differences between the P99 and SW99 are most notable on the frame of the pistol; the grip and trigger guard both have a slightly different shape. The slide is somewhat different as well, offering serrations in both the front and rear of the slide, while the P99 only has them on the rear. The most prominent distinction between the two firearms is that the SW99 is available in .45 ACP, while the P99 is not.

==Variants==
===SW99===

This version of the pistol has a double/single action; it shares the same &quot;Anti-Stress&quot; trigger action as the P99 AS.

===SW99O===
The SW99O variant does not incorporate a de-cocking button as the other models do. The firearm is in a constant double-action mode, and the trigger has the same long heavy trigger pull as the SW99 in double action mode, and will reset as such with each cycle. This firearm can be compared to the P99 DAO/P990.

===SW99 QA &amp; SW990L===
The SW99 QA and SW990L feature a shorter and lighter trigger pull. The action can be compared to those of Glock pistols. Unlike the standard SW99, the de-cocking button found on the SW99 QA need only be actuated before take-down, as doing so renders the firearm inoperable. The later production SW990L eliminated the de-cocking button, but otherwise, the trigger pull and trigger reset of the SW99 QA and the SW990L are both the Quick Action type.

===SW99C===
The compact version of the SW99.

<text>Energy accounting is a system used to measure, analyze and report the energy consumption of different activities on a regular basis. This is done to improve energy efficiency, and to monitor the environment impact of energy consumption.

==Energy management==
Energy accounting is a system used in energy management systems to measure and analyze energy consumption to improve energy efficiency within an organization. Organisations such as Intel corporation use these systems to track energy usage. 

Various energy transformations are possible. An energy balance can be used to track energy through a system. This becomes a useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts. How much energy is needed at each point in a system is measured, as well as the form of that energy. An accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus work done, and transformations within a system. Sometimes, non-useful work is what is often responsible for environmental problems.

The newer systems are trying to build predictive models of consumption. Startups are aiming to revolutionize this approach by introducing AI-based predictive models. These models can analyze vast amounts of data to forecast energy usage patterns, identify inefficiencies, and optimize energy distribution in real-time. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, these systems can learn from historical data and continuously improve their accuracy, providing organizations with powerful tools to enhance energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact. This shift towards predictive analytics represents a significant advancement in energy accounting, enabling more proactive and intelligent energy management.

==Energy balance==
Energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) is the ratio of energy delivered by an energy technology to the energy invested to set up the technology.

<doc id="1323608" wikidata="Q215201" url="?curid=1323608" title="Hildegard Hamm-Brücher">
<text>Hildegard Hamm-Brücher (11 May 1921 – 7 December 2016) was a liberal politician in Germany. She held federal state secretary positions from 1969 to 1972 and from 1977 to 1982. She was the Free Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate in the first two rounds of the federal presidency elections in 1994.

==Early life and education==
Hamm-Brücher was born in Essen, Germany and grew up with four siblings in a non-political, bourgeois family. Her father was director of an electric firm; her mother maintained the household. Unexpectedly, her parents died within a year of each other when she was only ten and eleven years old. After the death of her parents, along with her siblings, she was brought up by her widowed grandmother in Dresden. Her grandmother came from an industrial family, whose ancestors had converted from Judaism to Protestantism. Hamm-Brücher received her Abitur in 1939 and studied chemistry in Munich. She received her doctorate in chemistry in 1945 and began working as a science journalist for the &quot;Neue Zeitung&quot;, an American-run newspaper, in what was then still occupied Germany.

==Political career==
Hamm-Brücher joined the Free Democratic Party in 1948. She was elected to the Munich city council from 1948 to 1954, the Landtag of Bavaria from 1950 to 1966 and again from 1970 to 1976, and the Bundestag from 1976 to 1990. Hamm-Brücher focussed much of her work on education policy, and was appointed as secretary of state to the Hessian and federal Ministry for Education in 1967 and 1969, respectively. She also served as a Minister of State in the German Foreign Office from 1977 to 1982, while her party was part of a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party.

In 1982, the Free Democratic Party left that coalition in order to form a new coalition with the Christian Democratic Union. Rather than holding new elections, the Free Democrats supported a constructive vote of no confidence against Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and in favor of Christian Democrat Helmut Kohl. Hamm-Brücher prominently opposed the new coalition itself, as well as the method of switching coalitions without an election. Subsequently she lost her position as Minister of State, but continued to serve as a member of the parliament until 1990.

Her party nominated her as the Free Democrats&#x27; candidate in the German presidential election in 1994. However, the Free Democratic Party, then still in a coalition with the much larger Christian Democratic Union under Chancellor Kohl, ultimately chose to support the Christian Democrat&#x27;s candidate Roman Herzog in the election&#x27;s third round. Herzog went on to win the election with the combined majority of Christian and Free Democrats.

In 2002, Hamm-Brücher left the Free Democratic Party after a controversy with Jürgen Möllemann about his election campaign that harshly criticized Ariel Sharon, then Prime Minister of Israel. She served as a Green Party delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2012.

Hamm-Brücher died on 7 December 2016 at the age of 95.

==Other activities==
Hamm-Brücher authored several books and articles, often focussing on the state of modern democracy and the relationship between politics and ethical questions. She was a member of the Goethe Institute&#x27;s biannual General Meeting.

<doc id="1323610" wikidata="Q3738815" url="?curid=1323610" title="Sustainable yield">
<text>Sustainable yield is the amount of a resource that humans can harvest without over-harvesting or damaging a potentially renewable resource.

In more formal terms, the sustainable yield of natural capital is the ecological yield that can be extracted without reducing the base of capital itself, i.e. the surplus required to maintain ecosystem services at the same or increasing level over time. The term only refers to resources that are renewable in nature as extracting non-renewable resources will always diminish the natural capital. The sustainable yield of a given resource will generally vary over time with the ecosystem&#x27;s needs to maintain itself. For instance, a forest that has suffered from a natural disaster will require more of its own ecological yield to sustain itself and re-establish a mature forest. This results in a decrease of the forest&#x27;s sustainable yield. The definition of sustainable yield has changed throughout history and the term itself has been described as anthropocentric due to limitations in applying ecological complexity. The term sustainable yield is most commonly used in forestry, fisheries, and groundwater applications.

A sustainable yield is calculated by dividing carrying capacity by 2. At half of the carrying capacity, the population is considered harvestable and capable of regrowth. Errors in calculating the maximum sustainable yield can lead to over or under harvesting a resource. 

== Importance ==
Understanding sustainable yield is essential because it indicates how much a population can produce and what humans can glean from it without causing irreversible damage to the species population growth. It is possible that policies implementing maximum sustainable yield in ecosystems can cause the extinction of several species, especially if the population is harvested above its maximum sustainable yield. Improving the application of sustainable yield in ecosystems without damaging them is valuable to research.

== Forestry ==
Sustainable yield is an important component of sustainable forest management. In the forestry context it is the largest amount of harvest activity that can occur without degrading the productivity of the stock. The idea of sustainable yield forestry has shifted focus from only output, to include maintaining production capacity and maintaining the natural renewal capacity of forest vegetation.

In America, the O &amp; C Act of 1937 was one of the first written federal laws to warrant future generations having sufficient wood supply and regulations on wood harvest rate. The Act helped maintain a viable, sustainable yield, by ensuring land management, reforestation, watershed protection, a permanent timber source, and revenue distributed to local counties.

Sweden and Russia are examples of countries that implement sustainable yield forestry. Sweden&#x27;s market economy strives for maximum yield forestry which is obtained through intense forest management. Russia uses a mid-term horizon to distinguish natural growth from accessible timber. Their take on sustainable yield forestry uses natural regeneration and silviculture. Sustainable yield forestry is widely criticized for its singular focus on wood management. This results in a changed natural landscape with a loss in biodiversity of that ecosystem as well as key ecological processes.

== Fishery ==
The issue of over-fishing in the mid-1850s led to a new reference point for fishery management known as the maximum sustainable yield. Sustainable yield in fishery management is defined as the number of fish that can be extracted without reducing the base of fish stock, and the maximum sustainable yield is defined as the number of fish that can be extracted under given environmental conditions. In fisheries, the basic natural capital or virgin population, must decrease with extraction. At the same time productivity increases. Hence, sustainable yield would be within the range in which the natural capital together with its production are able to provide satisfactory yield. It may be very difficult to quantify sustainable yield, because every dynamic ecological conditions and other factors not related to harvesting induce changes and fluctuations in both, the natural capital and its productivity.

== Groundwater Application ==
Groundwater is essential for ecosystems and humans to sustain themselves as it is the largest store of distributed fresh water. In the case of groundwater there is a safe yield of water extraction per unit time, beyond which the aquifer risks the state of over drafting or even depletion. Depletion of an aquifer, or a decline in groundwater levels has the potential to cause land subsidence which can cause sinkholes. In order to calculate a safe yield of water extraction in the area, many factors need to be taken into account. The first is the water budget, figuring out and understanding where water is used by humans, getting recharged, and being lost due to possible maintenance issues and natural phenomena. Another consideration is changing technology. Technology allows for possible gains in supply, for example, desalination technology, turning saltwater into drinking water. The other considerations include temporal, spatial, and monetary aspects, which all cause changes in the water system that change the amount of usable water.

<text>The Clocker was a passenger train service between Philadelphia and New York City on the Northeast Corridor at first by the Pennsylvania Railroad and later by Amtrak. The service was nicknamed the &quot;Clocker&quot; by riders as trains were scheduled to leave each terminal at the top of the hour. The name was eventually adopted into official use by Amtrak in 1981. The service was briefly renamed Acela Commuter in 1999 before the name reverted to &quot;Clocker&quot; in 2003. 

Amtrak discontinued the service on October 28, 2005, and it was partially replaced by additional NJ Transit express trains between Trenton, New Jersey, and New York City at times approximating the &quot;Clocker&quot; schedule.

== History ==
=== Pennsylvania Railroad ===
The &quot;Clocker&quot; was originally a Pennsylvania Railroad express train service between New York and Broad Street Station in Philadelphia; the name was unofficial, and PRR timetables did not use it. Soon after New York Penn Station opened in 1910, the express trains began departing New York and Philadelphia through the day, giving rise to the Clocker name (which the railroad itself seems never to have used). Until the electrification of the Northeast Corridor in 1933, most &quot;Clockers&quot; were scheduled to both leave and arrive on each hour, but faster schedules after electrification eliminated the on the hour arrival.

Pennsylvania Railroad cut back on the schedule, and by the time Amtrak took over the nation&#x27;s passenger rail service on May 1, 1971, the &quot;Clocker&quot; service no longer ran hourly.

=== Amtrak ===

At the launch of Amtrak, the railroad assigned each run an individual name (listed in the table below). Starting with the October 1981 timetable, Amtrak officially adopted the &quot;Clocker&quot; name for the service. The trains were unreserved, coach class only, and Amtrak targeted the &quot;Clocker&quot; service at commuters travelling to local stops bypassed by the high-speed &quot;Metroliner&quot; trains, the &quot;Regional&quot; trains, and other named long-distance trains.

During the 1990s, NJ Transit started contracting with Amtrak to accept their monthly passes on the &quot;Clocker&quot; trains. These two decisions drastically shifted the clientele on the trains. Monthly ticket holders from New Jersey preferred the &quot;Clocker&quot; trains over the NJ Transit trains because they were faster and more comfortable, meanwhile, Amtrak&#x27;s passengers avoided the &quot;Clocker&quot; trains because they were slower and frequently crowded. Also, the monthlies meant that few passengers traveled to or from Philadelphia.

Until 2002, the 7:59 AM &quot;Clocker&quot; from Princeton Junction included a private club car known as Club 200 that members paid up to $1,200 per year to join (). This was the last private club car used in regular commuter service on the Northeast Corridor.

When the &quot;Acela Express&quot; was introduced in 1999, Amtrak launched what it called the Capstone Program, a short-lived plan to re-brand the &quot;NortheastDirect&quot;, &quot;Keystone Service&quot; and &quot;Empire Service&quot; trains as &quot;Acela Regional&quot; and the &quot;Clocker&quot; trains as &quot;Acela Commuter&quot;. Following mass rider confusion between this service and the high-speed Acela Express service, the name reverted to &quot;Clocker&quot; in 2003.

By the early 2000s, NJ Transit was paying $6 million per year to compensate Amtrak for monthly ticket holders riding Clocker trains, and was loaning Amtrak its new ALP-46 locomotives to haul the trains&#x27; Amfleet coaches.

On October 28, 2005, Amtrak discontinued the &quot;Clocker&quot; service altogether and sold the Northeast Corridor operating slots to NJ Transit which used them to partially replace the service with additional Northeast Corridor Line express trains between Trenton and New York City at times approximating the &quot;Clocker&quot; schedule.

<text>Iquique () is a port city and commune in northern Chile, capital of both the Iquique Province and Tarapacá Region. It lies on the Pacific coast, west of the Pampa del Tamarugal, which is part of the Atacama Desert. It has a population of 191,468 according to the 2017 census. It is also the main commune of Greater Iquique. The city developed during the heyday of the saltpetre mining in the Atacama Desert in the 19th century. Once a Peruvian city with a large Chilean population, it was conquered by Chile in the War of the Pacific (1879–1883). Today it is one of only two free ports of Chile, the other one being Punta Arenas, in the country&#x27;s far south.

==History==

Although the city was founded in the 16th century, there is evidence of habitation in the area by the Chango people as early as 7,000 BC. During colonial times, Iquique was part of the Viceroyalty of Peru as much of South America was at the time, and remained part of Peruvian territory until the end of the 19th century. Iquique&#x27;s early development was due in large part to the discovery of mineral riches, particularly the presence of large deposits of sodium nitrate in the Atacama Desert (then part of Peruvian territory) ; and guano.

In July 1835, Charles Darwin, during his voyage on the &quot;Beagle&quot;, traveled to Iquique and described it as a town &quot;very much in want of everyday necessities, such as water and firewood&quot;. These necessities had to be brought in from considerable distances. Darwin also visited the saltpetre works.

The city has been devastated by several earthquakes, including the 1868 Arica earthquake, the 1877 Iquique earthquake, and the 2005 Tarapacá earthquake. The 2014 Iquique earthquake occurred with a moment magnitude of 8.2 on April 1, 2014.
Territorial disputes between Bolivia and Chile triggered the War of the Pacific in 1879. The Battle of Iquique was fought in the harbor of Iquique on May 21, 1879, now commemorated as Navy Day, an annual public holiday in Chile. The outcome of the war gave Chile this portion of the Peruvian territory.

Over the years there was substantial emigration from other parts of Chile to this area which was called the &quot;Norte Grande&quot;. In subsequent years the further exportation of Chilean saltpetre (mainly to European countries) significantly helped in the development of the city, attracting foreigners and rapidly expanding housing projects.

In December 1907, the city was marred by the Santa María de Iquique Massacre when the Chilean Army, under the command of Gen. Roberto Silva Renard, opened fire on thousands of saltpetre miners, and their wives and children, who assembled inside the Santa María School. The workers had marched into town to protest their working conditions and wages. Somewhere between 500 and 2,000 people were killed. The folk group Quilapayún recorded an album in remembrance of the event (Cantata Santa María de Iquique) in 1970. In December 2007 a series of cultural and ceremonial activities were planned, culminating in the week between December 14 to 21, to commemorate the centenary year of the massacre.

Mars 96 was launched by Russia in 1996, but failed to leave the Earth orbit, and re-entered the atmosphere a few hours later. The two RTGs onboard carried 200 g of plutonium in total and are assumed to have survived the re-entry as they were designed to do. They are thought to now lie somewhere in a northeast-southwest running oval long by wide, which is centred east of Iquique, Chile.

Prior to becoming Chilean territory, Iquique was home to some of the greatest Peruvian heroes, namely Alfonso Ugarte (who was elected mayor in 1876), Ramón Zavala, a rich saltpetre entrepreneur; Guillermo Billinghurst, later President of Peru (who after being overthrown in 1914 came to Iquique – then already under Chilean rule – to live out his last years), and Ramón Castilla, thrice president of Peru, who was born in San Lorenzo de Tarapacá and died in the Desert of Tiviliche, Tarapacá, who lived in Iquique during his mandate as Governor of Tarapacá in 1825.

==Governance==
As a commune, Iquique is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2012–2016 alcalde is Jorge Soria.

Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Iquique is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Marta Isasi (Ind.) and Hugo Gutiérrez (PC) as part of the 2nd electoral district, which includes the entire Tarapacá Region. The commune is represented in the Senate by José Miguel Insulza (PS, 2018–2026) and José Durana (UDI, 2018–2026) as part of the 1st senatorial constituency (Arica and Parinacota Region and Tarapacá Region).
==Economy==
Iquique has one of the largest duty-free commercial port centers of South America, the Zona Franca of Iquique (free zone of Iquique) which has been traditionally called &quot;Zofri&quot;. There are around of warehouses, banking branches, and restaurants.

Copper mining, mainly in Quebrada Blanca, Cerro Colorado, and Doña Inés de Collahuasí, is also an important industry in Iquique.

==Demographics==

According to the 2002 census of National Statistics Institute (&quot;INE&quot;), the commune of Iquique had an area of and 216,419 inhabitants (108,897 men and 107,522 women). Of these, 214,586 (99.2%) lived in urban areas and 1,833 (0.9%) in rural areas. The township has an area of and a population of 166,204 inhabitants. The population grew by 42.7% (64,742 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Iquique is home to 56% of the total population of the Tarapacá region. In 2008, the city had 226,204 inhabitants.

Iquique commune is divided into the following districts:


There is a significant percentage of residents from different international ethnic groups. The largest communities are Croatian, Italian, Greek, Chinese, Arabic nationalities, Peruvians and Bolivians, British peoples (i.e. Scots), and the French.

In the 1910s and 1920s, about a thousand East Indian (from India and Pakistani) Chile saltpetre mine workers hired by British mine companies appeared in Iquique and today, their descendants are mixed into the local population. Lately, a wave of North American and Australian immigrants came to retire and enjoy the city&#x27;s beach climate. Immigrants currently make up 9.2% of the total population.

==Climate==
Iquique has an unusually mild to warm desert climate (Köppen: &quot;BWh&quot;) with low extremes of temperatures all year round and almost no rainfall. Due to its abundant cloudiness and coastal location, the climate is often abbreviated to &quot;BWn&quot;, as opposed to the usual &quot;BWh&quot; or &quot;BWk&quot;. It is common for this place to have completely dry years without any precipitation day, making it one of the driest cities in the world, along with Arica.

==Transport==
Iquique is served by Diego Aracena International Airport (Spanish: Aeropuerto Internacional Diego Aracena) (IATA: IQQ, ICAO: SCDA). The airport is on the Pacific coast 48 kilometers (30 mi) south of the city.

==Sport==
Iquique is home to football team Deportes Iquique. It hosted the 2016 FIRS Women&#x27;s Roller Hockey World Cup.

<text>Barosaurus ( ) was a giant, long-tailed, long-necked, plant-eating sauropod dinosaur closely related to the more familiar &quot;Diplodocus&quot;. Remains have been found in the Morrison Formation from the Upper Jurassic Period of Colorado, Utah, South Dakota, and eastern Wyoming at Como Bluff. It is present in stratigraphic zones 2–5.

The composite term &quot;Barosaurus&quot; comes from the Greek words &quot;barys&quot; (βαρυς) meaning &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;sauros&quot; (σαυρος) meaning &quot;lizard&quot;, thus &quot;heavy lizard&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Barosaurus&quot; was an enormous animal, with some adults measuring about in length and weighing about 12–20 metric tons (13–22 short tons). According to Mike Taylor, the long vertebra BYU 9024, previously identified as part of the type individual of &quot;Supersaurus vivianae&quot;, may actually belong to &quot;Barosaurus&quot;. He suggested that, interpreted as belonging to &quot;Barosaurus&quot;, the vertebra suggests an animal that was long and around in weight making it one of the largest known dinosaurs, with a neck length of at least . In 2020 Molina-Perez and Larramendi estimated it to be slightly smaller at and . However, research presented by Brian Curtice at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology conference has supported the previous interpretation of BYU 9024 as a &quot;Supersaurus&quot; vertebra. Despite this, there are other specimens that provide evidence of gigantic &quot;Barosaurus&quot; individuals which may have been among the longest dinosaurs. One of these is a series of three cervical vertebrae (BYU 3GR/BYU 20815) and the third vertebra is 1110 mm to 1220 mm in length. Dr Mike Taylor and Dr Matt Wedel compared the size of this bone to the same bone in smaller &quot;Barosaurus&quot; specimens, such as AMNH 6341, and estimated the neck length of the BYU 3GR/20815 &quot;Barosaurus&quot; at , which would make it one of the longest necks of any dinosaur and indicate a total body length of around . &quot; Barosaurus&quot; was differently proportioned than its close relative &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, with a longer neck and shorter tail, but was about the same length overall. It was longer than &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, but its skeleton was less robust. 

Sauropod skulls are rarely preserved, and scientists have yet to discover a &quot;Barosaurus&quot; skull. Related diplodocids like &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; and &quot;Diplodocus&quot; had long, low skulls with peg-like teeth confined to the front of the jaws.

Most of the distinguishing skeletal features of &quot;Barosaurus&quot; were in the vertebrae, although a complete vertebral column has never been found. &quot;Diplodocus&quot; and &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; both had 15 cervical (neck) and 10 dorsal (trunk) vertebrae, while &quot;Barosaurus&quot; had only 9 dorsals. A dorsal may have been converted into a cervical vertebra, for a total of 16 vertebrae in the neck. &quot;Barosaurus&quot; cervicals were similar to those of &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, but some were up to 50% longer. The neural spines protruding from the top of the vertebrae were neither as tall or as complex in &quot;Barosaurus&quot; as they were in &quot;Diplodocus&quot;. In contrast to its neck vertebrae, &quot;Barosaurus&quot; had shorter caudal (tail) vertebrae than &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, resulting in a shorter tail. The chevron bones lining the underside of the tail were forked and had a prominent forward spike, much like the closely related &quot;Diplodocus&quot;. The tail probably ended in a long whiplash, much like &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, &quot;Diplodocus&quot; and other diplodocids, some of which had up to 80 tail vertebrae.

The limb bones of &quot;Barosaurus&quot; were virtually indistinguishable from those of &quot;Diplodocus&quot;. Both were quadrupedal, with columnar limbs adapted to support the enormous bulk of the animals. &quot;Barosaurus&quot; had proportionately longer forelimbs than other diplodocids, although they were still shorter than most other groups of sauropods. There was a single carpal bone in the wrist, and the metacarpals were more slender than those of &quot;Diplodocus&quot;. &quot;Barosaurus&quot; feet have never been discovered, but like other sauropods, it would have been digitigrade, with all four feet each bearing five small toes. A large claw adorned the inside digit on the manus (forefoot) while smaller claws tipped the inside three digits of the pes (hindfoot).

==Classification and systematics==
&quot;Barosaurus&quot; is a member of the sauropod family Diplodocidae, and sometimes placed with &quot;Diplodocus&quot; in the subfamily Diplodocinae. Diplodocids are characterized by long tails with over 70 vertebrae, shorter forelimbs than other sauropods, and numerous features of the skull. Diplodocines like &quot;Barosaurus&quot; and &quot;Diplodocus&quot; have slenderer builds and longer necks and tails than apatosaurines, the other subfamily of diplodocids.

Below is a cladogram of Diplodocinae after Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson (2015).

The systematics (evolutionary relationships) of Diplodocidae are becoming better established. &quot;Diplodocus&quot; has long been regarded as the closest relative of &quot;Barosaurus&quot;. &quot;Barosaurus&quot; is monospecific, containing only the type species, &quot;B. lentus&quot;, while at least three species belong to the genus &quot;Diplodocus&quot;. Another diplodocid genus, &quot;Seismosaurus&quot;, is considered by many paleontologists to be a junior synonym of &quot;Diplodocus&quot; as a possible fourth species. &quot;Tornieria&quot; (formerly &quot;Barosaurus&quot; &quot;africanus&quot;) and &quot;Australodocus&quot; from the famous Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania in eastern Africa have also been classified as diplodocines. With its elongated neck vertebrae, &quot;Tornieria&quot; may have been particularly closely related to &quot;Barosaurus&quot;. The other subfamily of diplodocids is Apatosaurinae, which includes &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; and &quot;Supersaurus&quot;. The early genus &quot;Suuwassea&quot; is considered by some to be an apatosaurine, while others regard it as a basal member of the superfamily Diplodocoidea. Diplodocid fossils are found in North America, Europe, and Africa. More distantly related within Diplodocoidea are the families Dicraeosauridae and Rebbachisauridae, found only on the southern continents.

==Discovery, naming, and history==

The first &quot;Barosaurus&quot; remains were discovered in the Morrison Formation of South Dakota by Ms. Isabella R. Ellerman, postmistress of Postville, and excavated by Othniel Charles Marsh and John Bell Hatcher of Yale University in 1889. Only six tail vertebrae were recovered at that time, forming the type specimen (YPM 429) of a new species, which Marsh named &quot;Barosaurus lentus&quot;, from the Classical Greek words &#x27; (&#x27;) (&quot;heavy&quot;) and (&#x27;) (&quot;lizard&quot;), and the Latin word &#x27; (&quot;slow&quot;). The rest of the type specimen was left in the ground under the protection of the landowner, Ms Rachel Hatch, until it was collected nine years later, in 1898, by Marsh&#x27;s assistant, George Reber Wieland. These new remains consisted of vertebrae, ribs, and limb bones. In 1896 Marsh had placed &quot;Barosaurus&quot; in the Atlantosauridae; in 1898 it was classified by him as a diplodocid for the first time. In his last published paper before his death, Marsh named two smaller metatarsals found by Wieland as a second species, &quot;Barosaurus affinis&quot;, but this has long been considered a junior synonym of &quot;B. lentus&quot;.

After the turn of the 20th century, Pittsburgh&#x27;s Carnegie Museum of Natural History sent fossil hunter Earl Douglass to Utah to excavate the Carnegie Quarry in the area now known as Dinosaur National Monument. Four neck vertebrae, each 1 meter (3 feet) long, were collected in 1912 near a specimen of &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, but a few years later, William Jacob Holland realized they belonged to a different species. Meanwhile, the type specimen of &quot;Barosaurus&quot; had finally been prepared at Yale in the winter of 1917 and was fully described by Richard Swann Lull in 1919. Based on Lull&#x27;s description, Holland referred the vertebrae (CM 1198), along with a second partial skeleton found by Douglass in 1918 (CM 11984), to &quot;Barosaurus&quot;. This second Carnegie specimen remains in the rock wall at Dinosaur National Monument and was not fully prepared until the 1980s.
The most complete specimen of &quot;Barosaurus lentus&quot; was excavated from the Carnegie Quarry in 1923 by Douglass, now working for the University of Utah after the death of U.S. Steel founder Andrew Carnegie, who had been financing Douglass&#x27; earlier work in Pittsburgh. Material from this specimen was originally spread across three institutions. Most of the back vertebrae, ribs, pelvis, hindlimb and most of the tail stayed at the University of Utah, while the neck vertebrae, some back vertebrae, the shoulder girdle and forelimb were shipped to the National Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C., and a small section of tail vertebrae ended up in the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh. However, in 1929 Barnum Brown arranged for all of the material to be shipped to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where it remains today. A cast of this specimen (AMNH 6341) was controversially mounted in the lobby of the American Museum, rearing up to defend its young (AMNH 7530, now classified as &quot;Kaatedocus siberi&quot;) from an attacking &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot;.

More recently, more vertebrae and a pelvis were recovered in South Dakota. This material (SDSM 25210 and 25331) is stored in the collection of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in Rapid City.

Darren Naish has noted a common error in books of the late 20th century to depict &quot;Barosaurus&quot; as a kind of brachiosaur-like short tailed sauropod with raphes on its neck and body, and often curving the upper half of its neck downwards into a U-shape, citing it as an example of a Palaeoart meme. This originated with a drawing by Robert Bakker in a 1968 article, in which two &quot;Barosaurus&quot; appeared to have short tails due to a mix of foreshortening and one obscuring the other.

In 2007, paleontologist David Evans was flying to the U.S. Badlands when he discovered reference to a &quot;Barosaurus&quot; skeleton (ROM 3670) in the collection of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, where he had recently become a curator. Earl Douglass had excavated this specimen at the Carnegie Quarry in the early 20th century; the ROM acquired it in a 1962 trade with the Carnegie Museum. The specimen was never exhibited and remained in storage until its rediscovery by David Evans 45 years later. He returned to Toronto and searched the storage areas and found many fragments, large and small, of the skeleton. It is now a centrepiece of the ROM&#x27;s dinosaur exhibit, in the James and Louise Temerty Galleries of the Age of Dinosaurs. At almost 27.5 meters (90 feet) long, the specimen is the largest dinosaur ever to be mounted in Canada. The specimen is about 40% complete. As a skull of &quot;Barosaurus&quot; has never been found, the ROM specimen wears the head of a &quot;Diplodocus.&quot; Each bone is mounted on a separate armature so that it can be removed from the skeleton for study and then replaced without disturbing the rest of the skeleton. (See video &quot;Dino Workshop&quot; at reference.) In the rush to put the dinosaur on exhibit within ten weeks of its delivery to Research Casting International in 2500 pieces, not all of the skeletal fragments were mounted. In addition, more bones labeled ROM 3670 are still being found in storage. In future, more may be added to the specimen and it may turn out to be the most complete known.&#x27; (See video &quot;Dino Assembly&quot; at reference.) The ROM specimen is nicknamed &quot;Gordo&quot; after Gordon Edmunds, the museum curator who arranged for the skeleton to be brought to the ROM, and who had hoped to display it fully but was unable to. John McIntosh believes that the ROM&#x27;s skeleton is the same individual represented by four neck vertebrae labeled &quot;CM 1198&quot; in the collection of the Carnegie Museum.

===Discoveries in Africa===
In 1907, German paleontologist Eberhard Fraas discovered the skeletons of two sauropods on an expedition to the Tendaguru Beds in German East Africa (now Tanzania). He classified both specimens in the new genus &quot;Gigantosaurus&quot;, with each skeleton representing a new species (&quot;G. africanus&quot; and &quot;G. robustus&quot;). However, this genus name had already been given to the fragmentary remains of a sauropod from England. Both species were moved to a new genus, &quot;Tornieria&quot;, in 1911. Upon further study of these remains and many other sauropod fossils from the hugely productive Tendaguru Beds, Werner Janensch moved the species once again, this time to the North American genus &quot;Barosaurus&quot;. In 1991, &quot;Gigantosaurus&quot; &quot;robustus&quot; was recognized as a titanosaur and placed in a new genus, &quot;Janenschia&quot;, as &quot;J. robusta&quot;. Meanwhile, many paleontologists suspected &quot;Barosaurus&quot; &quot;africanus&quot; was also distinct from the North American genus, which was confirmed when the material was redescribed in 2006. The African species, although closely related to &quot;Barosaurus lentus&quot; and &quot;Diplodocus&quot; from North America, is now once again known as &quot;Tornieria africana&quot;. A species of &quot;Barosaurus&quot; was also allegedly identified from the Kadsi Formation in Zimbabwe in 1987. However, this material is poorly preserved and fragmentary and was not adequately diagnosed as such, and so its referral to &quot;Barosaurus&quot; is doubtful. It may represent &quot;Tornieria&quot;.

==Paleobiology==

===Feeding===

The structure of the cervical vertebrae of &quot;Barosaurus&quot; allowed for a significant degree of lateral flexibility in the neck, but restricted vertical flexibility. This suggests a different feeding style for this genus when compared to other diplodocids. &quot;Barosaurus&quot; swept its neck in long arcs at ground level when feeding, which resembled the strategy that was first proposed by John Martin in 1987. The restriction in vertical flexibility suggests that &quot;Barosaurus&quot; did not primarily feed on vegetation that was high off the ground.

==Paleoecology==
&quot;Barosaurus&quot; remains are limited to the Morrison Formation, which is widespread in the western United States between the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains. Radiometric dating agrees with biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic studies, indicating that the Morrison was deposited during the Kimmeridgian and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic Period, or approximately 155 to 148 million years ago. &quot;Barosaurus&quot; fossils are found in late Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian sediments, around 150 million years old.

The Morrison Formation was deposited in floodplains along the edge of the ancient Sundance Sea, an arm of the Arctic Ocean which extended southward to cover the middle of North America as far south as the modern state of Colorado. Due to tectonic uplift to the west, the sea was receding to the north, and had retreated into what is now Canada by the time &quot;Barosaurus&quot; evolved. The sediments of the Morrison were washed down out of the western highlands, which had been uplifted during the earlier Nevadan orogeny and were now eroding. Very high atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide in the Late Jurassic led to high temperatures around the globe, due to the greenhouse effect. One study, estimating CO2 concentrations of 1120 parts per million, predicted average winter temperatures in western North America of and summer temperatures averaging . A more recent study suggested even higher CO2 concentrations of up to 3180 parts per million. Warm temperatures that led to significant evaporation year-round, along with possible rain shadow effect from the mountains to the west, led to a semi-arid climate with only seasonal rainfall. This formation is similar in age to the Solnhofen limestone Formation in Germany and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. In 1877 this formation became the center of the Bone Wars, a fossil-collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope.

The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs such as &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; and &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;. Dinosaurs that lived alongside &quot;Barosaurus&quot; included the herbivorous ornithischians &quot;Camptosaurus&quot;, &quot;Dryosaurus&quot;, &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; and &quot;Othnielosaurus&quot;. Predators in this paleoenvironment included the theropods &quot;Saurophaganax&quot;, &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, &quot;Marshosaurus&quot;, &quot;Stokesosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ornitholestes&quot;, and &quot;Allosaurus&quot; accounted for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens and was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. Other vertebrates that shared this paleoenvironment included ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphs, and several species of pterosaur. Early mammals were present such as docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the &quot;Araucaria&quot;-like conifer &quot;Brachyphyllum&quot;.

Assistant Curator David Evans mounted the ROM specimen conservatively, with a relatively low head to give the dinosaur moderate blood pressure. The extremely long neck, 10 meters (30 feet) may have developed to enable &quot;Barosaurus&quot; to feed over a wide area without moving around; it may also have enabled the dinosaurs to radiate excess body heat. Evans suggests that sexual selection might have favored those with longer necks. (See video &quot;Neck Impossible&quot; at reference.)

<text>Hyacinthe Laurent Théophile Aube () (22 November 1826, Toulon, Var – 31 December 1890, Toulon) was a French admiral, who held several important governmental positions during the Third Republic.

Aube served as Governor of Martinique between 1879 and 1881, and as the French Minister of Marine from January 7, 1886 to May 30, 1887. He was an ardent supporter of the &quot;Jeune École&quot; and he temporarily stopped construction work on several battleships during his time in office.

<text>The Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service is the public policy school of New York University in New York City, New York. The school is named after New York City former mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. in 1989.

== History ==
In 1938, NYU offered its first Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree in response to overfilled public service-oriented classes at the university. Fifteen years later, NYU established a stand-alone school—the School for Public Service and Social Work. At around the same time, Robert Ferdinand Wagner Jr., as Mayor of New York City, worked to build public housing and schools, and established the right for city employees to collectively bargain. Wagner also made housing discrimination based on race, creed, or color illegal in New York City. In 1989, NYU renamed the school the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service in honor of the three-term mayor after receiving a major donation from Marshall Manley, Ray Chambers, and Walter Annenberg.

In 2004, NYU Wagner relocated to the Puck Building, a New York City landmark in the city&#x27;s SoHo neighborhood.

== Academics ==
The school offers the following degrees:

* Master of Public Administration (MPA) in public and nonprofit management and policy
* Master of Public Administration in health policy and management
* Master of Healthcare Administration (MHA)
* Master of Urban Planning (MUP)
* Master of Science in Public Policy (MSPP)
* Executive Master of Public Administration (EMPA)
* Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in public administration

NYU Wagner also offers joint degree programs with the NYU School of Law, NYU Stern School of Business, NYU School of Medicine, the Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, the NYU College of Arts and Science, and the NYU College of Global Public Health.

The school operates several research centers, institutes, and initiatives.

=== Programs ===
In addition to offerings in the NYU Wagner course listings, students are eligible to cross-register for many courses at the other graduate and professional schools at NYU.

NYU Wagner offers the following Undergraduate Minors in partnership with several New York University schools:
* Social Entrepreneurship
* Public Policy and Management
* Social and Public Policy
* Multifaith and Spiritual Leadership
Combined Bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree programs at NYU Wagner allow students to complete undergraduate and graduate degrees in five years instead of the traditional six. Combined dual-degree BA-MPA programs include:
* BA-MPA with NYU Abu Dhabi
* BA-MPA with NYU College of Arts and Science
* BA-MPA with NYU Gallatin School of Individualized Study
* BA-MPA with NYU Global Liberal Studies
The BA-MUP with the College of Arts and Science allows New York University undergraduates majoring in Economics, International Relations, Metropolitan Studies, Politics, Sociology, or Urban Design and Architecture who have completed most of their undergraduate degrees to take graduate courses and receive the Master&#x27;s in Urban Planning.

The BA-MUP with the NYU Tandon School of Engineering allows New York University Tandon undergraduates majoring in Sustainable Urban Environments, Construction Management, or Civil Engineering who have earned a GPA of 3.0 or higher to take graduate courses and receive the Master&#x27;s in Urban Planning.

=== Capstone project ===
All MPA and MUP students are required to complete a team-based Capstone project where they turn their classroom learning into practice to help nonprofit, public, and private sector organizations tackle a critical challenge.

<text>Melvin Earl Dummar (August 28, 1944 – December 9, 2018) was a Utah man who gained attention when he claimed to have saved reclusive business tycoon Howard Hughes in the Nevada desert in 1967, and to have been awarded part of Hughes&#x27; vast estate. Dummar&#x27;s claims resulted in a series of court battles that all ended in rulings against Dummar. A Las Vegas jury determined in 1978 that the will, leaving Dummar $156 million, was a forgery. Dummar&#x27;s story was later adapted into Jonathan Demme&#x27;s film &quot;Melvin and Howard&quot; in 1980, in which he was portrayed by actor Paul Le Mat. A 2005 reinvestigation of the circumstances surrounding the so-called Dummar Will yielded new evidence not previously known, which was argued to bolster Dummar&#x27;s claims.

==Dummar&#x27;s purported meeting with Hughes==
While working at a service station in Willard, Utah, Dummar claimed to have discovered a disheveled and lost man lying on the side of a stretch of U.S. Route 95 about north of Las Vegas, Nevada, near Lida Junction. The man asked Dummar to take him to the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. Dummar claimed that only in the final minutes of their encounter did the man reveal his identity as Hughes.

==The &quot;Mormon Will&quot;==
After Hughes&#x27; death in April 1976, a handwritten will was discovered in the Salt Lake City, Utah headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Though purportedly written by Hughes in 1968, the will had many strange discrepancies. It named Noah Dietrich as an executor, despite the fact that Dietrich had left Hughes&#x27; employ on bad terms in the late 1950s. The will left approximately $156 million to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; although Hughes had employed many LDS workers, he had never been a member of that church. The will also left money to his two ex-wives, Ella Rice and Jean Peters, even though both women had alimony settlements that barred claims on Hughes&#x27; estate. The will was rife with misspellings, including misspelling the name of Hughes&#x27; cousin. It called Hughes&#x27; famous flying boat, the Hughes H-4 Hercules, the &quot;spruce goose&quot; — a derisive nickname that Hughes had always despised. Most oddly, the will left one &quot;Melvin DuMar&quot; of Gabbs, Nevada one-sixteenth of Hughes&#x27; estate.

===Text of the &quot;Mormon Will&quot;===
The text of the handwritten document, known as the &quot;Mormon Will&quot;:
:Last Will and Testament
:I, Howard R. Hughes, being of sound mind and disposing mind and memory, not acting under duress, fraud or the undue influence of any person whomever, and being a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada, declare that this is to be my last will and revolt all other wills previously made by me -
:After my death, my estate is to be devided as follows -
:First: one-forth of all my assets to go to Hughes Medical Institute of Miami -
:Second: one-eight of assets to be devided among the University of Texas - Rice Institute of Technology of Houston - the University of Nevada - and the University of California.
:Third: one-sixteenth to Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - David O. McKay - Pre.
:Forth : one-sixteenth to establish a home for Orphan Children -
:Fifth: one-sixteenth of assets to go to Boy Scouts of America.

:Seventh: one-sixteenth of assets to William R. Lommis of Houston, Texas -
:Eighth: one-sixteenth to go to Melvin DuMar of Gabbs, Nevada -
:Ninth: one-sixteenth to be devided among my personal aids at the time of my death -
:Tenth: one-sixteenth to be used as school scholarship fund for entire country - the spruce goose is to be given to the City of Long Beach, Calif.
:The remainder of my estate is to be devided among the key men of the company&#x27;s I own at the time of my death.
:I appoint Noah Dietrich as the executer of this will -
:Signed the 19 day of March 1968
:Howard R. Hughes

===1978 Probate trial of the &quot;Mormon Will&quot;===
Dummar (whose inheritance would have been $156 million) originally claimed that he knew nothing about the will and told his story of picking up Hughes by the side of the road. Afterward, when authorities discovered Dummar&#x27;s fingerprint on the envelope, he said that a well-dressed man had left the will in a sealed envelope at Dummar&#x27;s service station. An enclosed note, Dummar claimed, instructed him to deliver the will to the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which had also been left 1/16 of the estate.

An investigation revealed that Dummar&#x27;s wife Bonnie Dummar had worked for a magazine called &quot;Millionaire&quot; that was distributed to wealthy Americans, and that her job had allowed her access to Hughes&#x27; memos and Hughes&#x27; signature. However, Bonnie denied forging the will.

The document, which became known as the &quot;Mormon Will&quot;, was ruled a forgery by a Nevada jury in June 1978. Dummar received no portion of Hughes&#x27; estate, but no criminal charges were filed against him or his wife.

===2005 investigation by FBI agent Gary Magnesen===
In early 2005, retired FBI agent Gary Magnesen claimed to have found new evidence supporting Dummar&#x27;s story. Magnesen stated that Hughes&#x27; closest employees remembered him entering the Sands Hotel early one morning in December 1967 and stating that he had been picked up by Dummar in the desert. Furthermore, Hughes had purchased interests in mines located near the area where Dummar said he found him, and had frequented a brothel near where Dummar said he&#x27;d first encountered Hughes, which he was allegedly flown out to by pilot Robert Deiro. Magnesen documented his findings in his 2005 book, &quot;The Investigation: A Former FBI Agent Uncovers the Truth Behind Howard Hughes, Melvin Dummar, and the Most Contested Will in American History.&quot; However, some of Magnesen&#x27;s claims were disputed by Hughes&#x27; former bodyguard Gordon Margulis, who asserted that &quot;from 1966 to 1970 [...] [Hughes] never left his room at the Desert Inn&quot;, and that &quot;if Hughes had wanted hookers he did not have to fly to brothels to get them because Las Vegas was not exactly short of them.&quot; George Parnum, one of Dummar&#x27;s former attorneys, stated that &quot;if there was a flight to a brothel at the time leading up to the trial, he couldn&#x27;t find a record of it&quot;.

Dummar was interviewed for one hour on live radio in 2005 about Magnesen&#x27;s book by Steven Rinehart. In this interview, he related again what he claims happened in 1967 and affirmed an intention to seek to reopen the case.

===2006 suit against Lummis and Gay===
On June 12, 2006, Dummar filed suit in the United States district court for Utah against William Lummis, the primary beneficiary of the Hughes estate, and Frank Gay, the former chief operating officer of a number of Hughes entities, claiming that the two had conspired to defraud Dummar out of his rightful share of the Hughes estate by presenting perjured testimony and concealing evidence in the 1978 trial. Dummar&#x27;s complaint demanded the $156 million he would have received from the estate, as well as punitive damages and interest.

On January 9, 2007, U.S. District Judge Bruce Sterling Jenkins dismissed Dummar&#x27;s lawsuit, stating that Dummar&#x27;s claims had been “fully and fairly litigated” in Las Vegas in 1978 when a jury decided the purported will was invalid.

<text>Zaid bin Hussein (; (28 February 1898 – 18 October 1970) was an Iraqi prince who was a member of the Hashemite dynasty and the head of the Royal House of Iraq from 1958 until his death, after the royal line founded by his brother Faisal I of Iraq was killed.

==Biography==
Prince Zaid was the fourth son of Hussein bin Ali, who was the Sharif and Emir of Mecca, and only son of Hussein and his Ottoman-Turkish third wife, Adila Khanum. He was educated at Galatasaray High School in Stamboul (Istanbul), Constantinople College and Balliol College, Oxford.

From 1916 to 1919, Prince Zeid was the Commander of the Arab Northern Army. In 1918, T. E. Lawrence suggested that he be made king of a truncated north-western Syria. The advent of French rule resulted in his assignment in 1923 to the Iraqi Cavalry and he was promoted to Colonel.

Zeid was also Iraqi ambassador in Berlin and in Ankara in the 1930s and in London in the 1950s.

On 14 July 1958 Prince Zeid became Head of the Royal House of Iraq, following the assassination of his grand-nephew King Faisal II by General Muhammad Najib ar-Ruba&#x27;i, who proclaimed Iraq to be a republic. Zeid and his family continued to live in London, where the family resided during the coup, as Zeid was the Iraqi ambassador there.

Prince Zeid died in Paris on 18 October 1970, and was buried in the Royal Mausoleum at Raghdan Palace, Amman, Jordan. His son prince Ra&#x27;ad bin Zeid succeeded him as head of the Royal House of Iraq.

==Marriage and children==
In November 1933, Zeid married Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid in Athens, Greece. Together they had one son:

*Prince Ra&#x27;ad bin Zeid - born 18 February 1936, married to Margaretha Inga Elisabeth Lind (1942-2025).

<text>Mixing studies are tests performed on blood plasma of patients or test subjects to distinguish factor deficiencies from factor inhibitors, such as lupus anticoagulant, or specific factor inhibitors, such as antibodies directed against factor VIII. Mixing studies are screening tests widely performed in coagulation laboratories. The basic purpose of these tests is to determine the cause of prolongation of Prothrombin Time (PT), Partial Thromboplastin Time, or sometimes of thrombin time (TT). Mixing studies take advantage of the fact that factor levels that are 50 percent of normal should give a normal Prothrombin time (PT) or Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) result. 

==Test method==

Fresh normal plasma has all the blood coagulation factors with normal levels. 

If the problem is a simple factor deficiency, mixing the patient plasma 1:1 with plasma that contains 100% of the normal factor level results in a level ≥50% in the mixture (say the patient has an activity of 0%; the average of 100% + 0% = 50%). The PT or PTT will be normal (the mixing study shows correction). Correction with mixing indicates factor deficiency. Failure to correct with mixing indicates an inhibitor. Performing a thrombin time on the test plasma can provide useful additional information for the interpretation of mixing tests, such as by demonstrating the presence of anticoagulants, hypofibrinogenemia or dysfibrinogenemia.

==Adsorbed Plasma and Aged Plasma==

Factor deficient plasmas (Adsorbed Plasma and Aged Plasma, etc.) have been used historically in mixing studies. Plasma with known factor deficiencies are commercially available but are very expensive, so they have been prepared in the laboratory and used for mixing tests. Adsorbed plasma or plasma from patients on oral anticoagulants (Warfarin etc.) for a week or more is deficient in Factor II, Factor VII, Factor IX, and Factor X. Plasma from patients on oral anticoagulants (Warfarin etc.) for 48–72 hours is deficient in Factor VII. Aged plasma is deficient in Factor V &amp; Factor VIIIC. Serum is deficient in factors I, V &amp; VIIIC. 

=== Correction of prothrombin time ===

Prothrombin time (PT) may be corrected as follows:

=== Correction of partial thromboplastin time ===

Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) may be corrected as follows:

==Time-dependent inhibitors==

Some inhibitors are time dependent. In other words, it takes time for the antibody to react with and inactivate the added clotting factor. The clotting test performed immediately after the specimens are mixed may show correction because the antibody has not had time to inactivate its target factor. A test performed after the mixture is incubated for 1 to 2 hours at 37°C will show significant prolongation over the clotting time obtained after immediate mixing. Nonspecific inhibitors like the lupus anticoagulant usually are not time dependent; the immediate mixture will show prolongation. Many specific factor inhibitors are time dependent, and the inhibitor will not be detected unless the test is repeated after incubation (factor VIII inhibitors are notorious for this).

==Abnormal coagulation test results==

A common problem is an unexplained increase in the PT and/or PTT. If this is observed, the test should be repeated with a fresh sample. Another consideration is heparin. It is possible that the blood sample was mistakenly drawn though a running line. Interference by heparin can be detected by absorbing the heparin with a resin (“Heparsorb”) or by using an enzyme to digest the heparin (“Hepzyme”). Also, the patient&#x27;s history should be checked, especially with regard to anticoagulant use or liver disease. Provided that the abnormal result is reproduced on a fresh specimen and there is no obvious explanation from the history, a mixing study should be performed. If the mixing study shows correction and no prolongation with incubation, factor deficiency should be looked for, starting with VIII and IX. Vitamin K-dependent and nonvitamin K–dependent factors should be considered to rule out vitamin K deficiency, or accidental or surreptitious warfarin ingestion.

==Inhibitor==
If the mixing study fails to correct, then an inhibitor should be suspected. The most common inhibitor is a nonspecific inhibitor such as a lupus anticoagulant. Perform a test to demonstrate a phospholipid-dependent antibody, such as a platelet neutralization procedure. Spontaneous specific inhibitors against clotting factors occur (i.e. not in hemophiliacs), most often against factor VIII. This can occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, monoclonal gammopathies, other malignancies, during pregnancy and for no apparent reason (idiopathic). These patients can have devastating bleeding. The thing to do is identify the specific factor involved and find out how high the titer is. If the patient has a low titer inhibitor, try to overwhelm it with high doses of the factor. If the patient has a high titer antibody against factor VIII, try porcine factor VIII, activated prothrombin complex concentrate FEIBA (Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Agent), or NovoSeven to stop the bleeding. Prednisone will often lower the titer over time. Intravenous immunoglobulin has been reported to also help but it does not seem to work for hemophiliacs with an inhibitor. Rituximab, cyclophosphamide or other immunosuppressive therapy may be required.

=== Assessing correction of mixing study ===
In order to provide specific cutoffs to distinguish an inhibitor defect from a factor deficiency, the &quot;Rosner index&quot; (index of circulating anticoagulant) and/or the &quot;Chang percentage&quot; (percent correction method) can be used:

formula_1

Results are: ≤10 is classified as correction, ≥15 indicates presence of an inhibitor, and 11-15 is classified as &quot;indeterminate&quot;.

formula_2

Results are classified as follows: &lt;58% as inhibitor and &gt;70% as correction.&gt;

Alternatively, correction into the reference range can be used to define complete correction.

A fourth method is known as Estimated Factor Correction (EFC). This method involves four steps. First, determine the most likely factor suspected to be deficient, based on PT, aPTT, and clinical history. Next, choose the appropriate curve — single factor deficiency, vitamin K-dependent factor deficient, or all factor-deficient. Use this curve to estimate the factor level in the patient sample. Then, predict the factor level and PT or aPTT that will occur after 1:1 mix in case of deficiency. Finally, compare the actual mix results with the predicted results for deficiency.

<text>Artificial scarcity is scarcity of items despite the technology for production or the sufficient capacity for sharing. The most common causes are monopoly pricing structures, such as those enabled by laws that restrict competition or by high fixed costs in a particular marketplace. The inefficiency associated with artificial scarcity is formally known as a deadweight loss.

== Background ==

In a capitalist system, an enterprise is judged to be successful and efficient if it is profitable. To obtain maximum profits, producers may restrict production rather than ensure the maximum utilisation of resources. This strategy of restricting production by firms in order to obtain profits in a capitalist system or mixed economy is known as creating artificial scarcity.

Artificial scarcity essentially describes situations where the producers or owners of a good restrict its availability to others beyond what is strictly necessary. Ideas and information are prime examples of unnecessarily scarce products given artificial scarcity as illustrated in the following quote: 

Even though ideas as illustrated above can be shared with less constraints than physical goods, they are often treated as unique, scarce, inventions or creative works, and thus allotted protection as intellectual properties in order to allow the original authors to potentially profit from their own work.

== Causes of artificial scarcity ==

Robust competition among suppliers tends to bring the consumer price close to the marginal cost of production, plus a profit that makes entering the market worthwhile compared to other opportunities. Circumstances with insufficient competition can lead to suppliers exercising enough market power to constrict supply. The clearest example is a monopoly, where a single producer has complete control over supply and can extract a monopoly price. An oligopoly - a small number of producers - can also sustain an undersupply if no producers attempt to gain market share with lower prices at higher volume.
Lack of supply competition can arise in many different ways:
* Cartel - a group of suppliers explicitly agree to constrain supply. This is usually illegal under national competition law, but some cartels are government-approved.
* Barriers to entry make it difficult for new producers to enter the market. These may be inherent to the business (such as the cost of building a new factory), related to government regulation, or intentionally created (sometimes illegally) by incumbent suppliers to reduce competition
* Producers uninterested in the market due to low expected profit margins compared to other opportunities
* Monopolies created in law to encourage innovation and make certain businesses worthwhile
** Copyright, when used to disallow copying or disallow access to sources. Proprietary software is an example. Copyleft software is a counterexample where copyleft advocates use copyright licenses to &quot;guarantee&quot; the right to copy, access, view, and change the source code, and allow others to do the same to derivatives of that code. Producers use various means to self-enforce payment and make copyright infringement difficult, including controlling physical access to copies, copy protection and digital rights management technology, paywalls, and disruption of illegal marketplaces (e.g. cease-and-desist letters, torrent poisoning).
** Patents for useful things

Some products (e.g. works of art, non-fungible tokens, expensive cars) are manufactured as one-of-a-kind or in a limited edition, and can extract a monopoly price. This succeeds only to the degree that substitutions are unavailable or less desirable or the identity of the producer is considered important. For example, there is only one original Mona Lisa, which is very expensive, even though the work is out of copyright so that copies and reproductions are available at low cost. A luxury supercar might be manufactured in artificially low quantities to take advantage of the reputation of the brand and the difficulty other suppliers have in replicating the design, even if not protected by intellectual property rights. 

Non-manufacturers can create artificial scarcity and extract monopoly prices (at least temporarily) by hoarding or cornering the market on a particular commodity.

Governments use various types of price supports that create artificial scarcity, including payments for non-production, government purchasing at a guaranteed price, and even deliberate destruction. This is typically done in agricultural markets to aid farmers. Examples:
* The 1933 Agricultural Adjustment Act in the United States during the Great Depression
* Destruction of coffee by the Brazil National Coffee Council
* Conversion by the French government of wine into industrial ethanol, related to the idea of a wine lake
* European Union guaranteed purchases of certain agricultural commodities falling below intervention prices, resulting in occasional butter mountains
* U.S. government Commodity Credit Corporation purchases of dairy products from WWII to the 1990s, resulting in government cheese
* Agricultural production quotas, where overproduction can result in a fine
* Import quotas
Restrictions on immigration artificially reduce the supply of labor.

== Arguments ==

=== Advocacy ===
Artificial scarcity is said to be necessary to promote the development of goods or prevent source depletion. In the example of digital information, it may be inexpensive to copy information almost infinitely, but it may require significant investment to develop the information in the first place. In the example of the pharmaceutical industry, large scale production of most drugs is inexpensive, but developing safe and effective drugs can be extremely expensive. Typically, drug companies have profit margins that extract much more excess profit than necessary to repay their initial investment. It is argued that this high payoff attracts more investment and labour talent, increasing the pace of drug development. The expiry of patents works to limit the period of exclusive rights to sell a new drug. After a time of profiting from legally enforced artificial scarcity, the patent expires, and other companies can make generic versions, and compete on price in a free market. 

=== Opposition ===
==== Right-wing ====

Some classical liberals and libertarians oppose artificial scarcity on the grounds that their lack of physical scarcity means they are not subject to the same rationale behind material forms of private property, and that most instances of artificial scarcity, such as intellectual property, are creations of the state that limit the rights of the individual.

An economic liberal argument against artificial scarcity is that, in the absence of artificial scarcity, businesses and individuals would create tools based on their own need (demand). For example, if a business had a strong need for a voice recognition program, they would pay to have the program developed to suit their needs. The business would profit not on the program, but on the resulting boost in efficiency enabled by the program. The subsequent abundance of the program would lower operating costs for the developer as well as other businesses using the new program. Lower costs for businesses result in lower prices in the competitive free market. Lower prices from suppliers would also raise profits for the original developer. In abundance, businesses would continue to pay to improve the program to best suit their own needs, and increase profits. Over time, the original business makes a return on investment, and the final consumer has access to a program that suits their needs better than any one program developer can predict. This is the common rationale behind open-source software.

==== Left-wing ====

Social liberals, socialists and anarchists argue that artificial scarcity is beneficial for the owner, but unfavourable towards the consumer, as it enables the owner to capitalise off ideas and products that are otherwise not property in the physical sense.

Socialists extend their argument to include &quot;socially wasteful production&quot; such as the production of goods which are seen as &quot;status&quot; goods (e.g. diamonds or expensive cars). This sort of production leads to a situation of artificial scarcity of socially useful goods because a large part of society&#x27;s resources are being diverted to the production of these goods. For example, capitalism has led to the growth of money-based activities like banking-retailing services, remedial measures to deal with trade union issues, and other such activities to protect capitalism such as weapons research and the development of security firms; socialists argue that the allocation of resources to these activities is not socially useful.

Some socialists argue that not only artificial scarcity but even the doctrine of scarcity itself is a creation of the capitalist system because any kind of property was considered a burden for the nomadic lifestyle when civilisation was in the hunter-gatherer stage. Along with some free-market libertarians and anarchists, they will argue for sharing economies and post-scarcity economics, both questioning the scarcity of physical and intellectual goods as currently imposed by artificial cultural, bureaucratic, or economic constraints.

<text>Merlin is a 1998 two-part television miniseries starring Sam Neill as Merlin, recounting the wizard&#x27;s life in the mythic history of Britain. Loosely adapted from the legendary tales of Camelot, the plot adds the antagonistic Queen Mab and expands Merlin&#x27;s backstory before the birth of King Arthur. The sequel &quot;Merlin&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; followed in 2006.

==Plot==

Part 1

Merlin, an elderly man telling his life story, describes a Britain faced with invasions and tyrant kings increasingly cruel to the people. Fairy Queen Mab seeks to reclaim her power by drawing people back to worship The Old Ways. To do so, she creates a wizard named Merlin, whom she intends to champion her crusade. Merlin&#x27;s mother dies giving birth to him, and he is raised by his guardian, Ambrosia.

Years later, a teenage Merlin recounts to Ambrosia how he rescued a nobleman&#x27;s daughter, Nimue, from drowning by magically growing a branch. Ambrosia tells him of his past, and he is sent to Mab to begin training with Frik, Mab&#x27;s gnome servant. Despite great aptitude, however, Merlin has little interest in helping Mab&#x27;s crusade to restore the Old Ways, angering her. Merlin discovers from the Lady of the Lake, Mab&#x27;s sister, that Mab let his birth mother die and that Ambrosia is terminally ill. Mab reaches Ambrosia&#x27;s home before Merlin, but when Ambrosia refuses to convince Merlin to return to Mab, Mab lashes out, mortally injuring Ambrosia. Merlin tries to attack Mab but can&#x27;t defeat her; she coldly dismisses the deaths of his mother and Ambrosia as &quot;casualties of war&quot; and vows that Merlin will help her. Merlin makes a blood oath to use his powers only to defeat Mab.

Many years pass. The tyrant King Vortigern is angered that his new castle keeps collapsing. Mab convinces Vortigern his castle will only stand if Merlin&#x27;s blood is mixed with the mortar. Vortigern orders Merlin killed but relents when Merlin tells Vortigern of his vision: a crimson dragon representing Uther Pendragon defeating the white dragon that represents Vortigern. Mab tells the king that he can vanquish Uther by sacrificing Nimue to a dragon in the hope that Merlin will break his vow not to use magic. Merlin uses magic to save Nimue, and she is sent to Avalon to recover from her burns. Merlin asks the Lady of the Lake for help, and she gives him the magical sword Excalibur.

Merlin warns Uther of Vortigern&#x27;s intention to attack him under cover of winter. Uther heeds Merlin&#x27;s warning, and Merlin uses Excalibur to defeat Vortigern during battle, giving Excalibur to Uther afterward.

Mab uses her magic to make Uther become obsessed with Igraine, the wife of Gorlois, Lord of Cornwall. Seeing his emerging madness, Merlin tricks Uther out of Excalibur and plunges it into the Rock of Ages, who promises to keep it until a good man can withdraw it. Uther&#x27;s mind is plagued by madness and lust for Igraine, and Britain slides back into civil war. Merlin strikes a deal with Uther to let him bed Igraine in exchange for guardianship of the son born from the union and for Gorlois and his men to be spared. Merlin transforms Uther&#x27;s appearance into that of Gorlois, fooling everyone in Tintagel Castle except for Igraine&#x27;s young daughter, Morgan le Fay. After bedding Igraine, Uther has Gorlois and his men slaughtered, deliberately going back on his word to Merlin.

While Igraine is in labor, at Mab&#x27;s behest, Frik convinces Morgan to place a black stone beneath the baby&#x27;s sheets in his crib. Igraine gives birth to Arthur. Mab then confronts Merlin, proclaiming Arthur to be damned, but Merlin vows to raise him in the ways of good and hopes Arthur will help bring about her demise.

Part 2

Merlin begins tutoring Arthur. Meanwhile, Uther sinks further into madness and commits suicide, leaving the kingdom in turmoil. The noblemen in the kingdom try to take Excalibur from the Rock of Ages, but none can until Merlin presents Arthur, who is allowed to take the sword.

After initial hostility, the nobles unite behind Arthur as their rightful king. Merlin leaves, thinking the kingdom is finally at peace. Mab, however, instructs Frik to seek out Morgan and poison her mind by making her beautiful and having her seduce Arthur, who is unaware of their half-sibling relationship. Merlin races back to Camelot to confront Arthur and Morgan gives birth to Mordred, who, conceived through incest, is born evil. Mab helps raise Mordred to become Arthur&#x27;s downfall. Arthur starts construction of his castle of Camelot and marries Guinevere.

Arthur decides to take his knights on a quest for the Holy Grail. He holds a tournament to crown a champion who will defend and complete Camelot in his absence. The Lady of the Lake vows to guide Merlin to a man worthy of being Camelot&#x27;s guardian. Merlin meets a boy, Galahad, and his parents, Lancelot, a skilled rider and swordsman, and Elaine of Corbenic. Merlin brings Lancelot to Camelot, where he wins the tournament.

In Arthur&#x27;s absence, Guinevere and Lancelot embark on a love affair. Mab makes sure Elaine sees his betrayal, and she is found dead at the shores of Camelot not long after. Lancelot flees Camelot in his guilt and shame. Arthur and his knights return, their quest for the Grail a failure.

Mordred introduces himself as Arthur&#x27;s son and heir and reveals Guinevere&#x27;s betrayal to all. Arthur is forced to condemn her to be burned at the stake for treason, but he relents and has Merlin save her before she is harmed, causing him to lose respect among the younger nobles. Lancelot rides back to Camelot to save Guinevere, and they ride away into exile.

Mordred raises an army among those dissatisfied with Arthur and Merlin. Meanwhile, Frik and Morgan have fallen in love. When Morgan refuses to allow Mab to use Mordred further, Mab kills her. Frik vows revenge on Mab but is left powerless when she takes away his magic.

Mab creates an idyllic wilderness home for Nimue and asks her to persuade Merlin to stay with her, hoping to stop him from intervening in the coming battle. Wanting to be with him, Nimue agrees and sends for Merlin.

The armies of Mordred and Arthur begin the Battle of Camlann, where many on both sides are slain. Arthur defeats Mordred and kills him, but Mordred deals Arthur a fatal blow. Sensing his protégé is dying, Merlin leaves Nimue to go to Arthur, but Mab&#x27;s creation seals itself behind him, parting Merlin from Nimue forever. On the battlefield, Mab cannot save Mordred, and Arthur lives long enough to tell Merlin to return Excalibur to where it was found. Merlin gives back the sword to the Lady of the Lake. She tells Merlin she is slowly dying as the Old Ways are forgotten. Merlin accuses her of lying to him about the guardian of Camelot, but she explains that it was Galahad who was the true guardian and could have averted all this, though she assures Merlin that Arthur&#x27;s death is not his fault. Merlin encounters Frik among the survivors of Arthur&#x27;s army, who warns him that although Mab is significantly weakened, she is still dangerous.

Merlin confronts Mab at Camelot, but the ensuing magical duel ends in a stalemate. Mab sneers that she is invulnerable to conventional means of destruction, but Merlin responds that she will be defeated when she is forgotten. Mab slowly fades into nothing as Merlin, Frik, and the entire court of Camelot turn their backs on her and walk away.

Merlin is again shown back in the present, finishing his story. Frik reminds Merlin that he remembers things differently. Merlin admits that what Frik said is true, but he could not tell &quot;that&quot; story to his listeners. Frik leads Merlin to Merlin&#x27;s aged magic horse, who Frik says will take him to Nimue. Frik explains that sometime after Mab disappeared, the spells she had cast lost their effectiveness, and Nimue was set free. Merlin finds the elderly Nimue at Ambrosia&#x27;s old forest home. He manages one last act of magic to restore them both to youth so they can finally live out their lives together.

==Production==
The film was produced by Dyson Lovell and directed by Steve Barron. The story is by Edward Khmara, with the teleplay written by David Stevens and Peter Barnes. Illustrator Alan Lee served as the film&#x27;s conceptual designer.

Despite heavy fantasy elements, the production is partly historically accurate, keeping with the probable origins of the Arthurian legend in Sub-Roman Britain. The costumes and props used in the film include Dark Age or Early Medieval Celtic and Roman-style weapons and armor (such as Iron Age swords, mail, scale, and leather). In contrast, other Arthurian films like &quot;Excalibur&quot;, &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot;, and &quot;First Knight&quot; used High Medieval or Late Medieval-style weapons and armour (such as longswords and full suits of plate). However, some anachronisms are present, like the use of the terms &quot;knight&quot; and &quot;Sir&quot; and the presence of Roman &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; armour years after it was discontinued. During the conflict between Vortigern and Uther, Uther is said to be invading from Normandy, despite the film taking place long before the age of the Vikings and thus of the Norman colonization, which gave Normandy its name.

Nicholas Clay, who plays Guinevere&#x27;s father, Lord Leo, and Robert Addie, who plays Sir Gilbert, both appeared in John Boorman&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Excalibur&quot; as (respectively) Lancelot and Mordred. Paul Curran, who played the adult King Arthur, played Kay alongside Jason Connery as Merlin in &quot;&quot;, an unrelated television film released the same year.

==Reception==
The original television broadcast in the United States achieved record audiences of an estimated 70 million, &quot;ratings that could only be labeled magical&quot;, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated.

==Accolades==
==Sequel==

Hallmark Entertainment filmed the &quot;Merlin&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; miniseries in Vancouver, with Neill and Richardson returning, though Richardson played a somewhat different role. The Hallmark Channel broadcast the sequel miniseries in 2006.

<text>The Bear Mountain Bridge, ceremonially named the Purple Heart Veterans Memorial Bridge, is a toll suspension bridge in New York State. It carries US 6 and US 202 across the Hudson River between Bear Mountain State Park in Orange County and Cortlandt in Westchester County. At completion in 1924 it was the longest suspension bridge in the world until this record was surpassed 19 months later by the Benjamin Franklin Bridge between Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey. Like the Williamsburg Bridge in New York City, the approach spans of the Bear Mountain Bridge are unsuspended; only its main span (between the towers) is suspended by cables.

The span enables connections between the Palisades Interstate Parkway and US 9W on the west bank near Bear Mountain and NY 9D on the east bank as well as US 9 and the Bear Mountain Parkway farther east. It also carries the Appalachian Trail and New York State Bicycle Route 9 across the Hudson.

The bridge has two undivided vehicle lanes flanked by sidewalks. Cyclists may ride with motor vehicle traffic or walk their bikes on the sidewalks.

==History==
===Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge===
Plans for a bridge at the site began with the charter of the Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge Company in 1868 after a bill was passed by the legislature and signed by Governor Fenton. Early investors in the company included Erastus Corning, Isaac Bell, and Addison P. Jones.

The following year, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that a contract had been signed and construction would &quot;speedily commence&quot; on the &quot;Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge&quot; between Fort Clinton and Anthony&#x27;s Nose. The intent was to carry a railroad toward Derby, Connecticut, to supply coal and iron for industry in the lower Naugatuck Valley. The surface of the bridge was to be above high tide. In 1871, a board of engineers had been selected to work on the bridge, including Horatio Allen, George B. McClellan, Edward W. Serrell, and Quincy Adams Gillmore. It was reported that capital of $2.5 million was needed and that much of it had been raised from the railroads who would benefit from the bridge. At this time, construction was expected to begin in June 1871 and to be complete by 1875.

In 1887, reports said the bridge would be finished in two years. By 1889, &quot;work on the anchor pits was progressing rapidly.&quot; On March 5, 1896, the Hudson Highland Bridge and Railway Company filed for incorporation with capital of $84,900. The company was a reorganization of the former Hudson Suspension Bridge and New England Railway Company.

None of these attempts to build the bridge were successful, with only foundation preparations having progress made. Much of this period coincided with the so-called Long Depression, including stock market crashes called the Panic of 1873 and Panic of 1893. A charter for construction of the bridge expired in 1916.

===Bear Mountain Hudson River Bridge Company===
In March 1922 through a bill introduced by C. Ernest Smith, the state legislature authorized creation of the private Bear Mountain Hudson River Bridge Company to complete the project. The bridge was now for automobiles instead of rail, and included a approach road from the Albany Post Road north of Peekskill. The 11-member board of directors included financiers E. Roland Harriman and George W. Perkins. Under the 1922 charter, ownership of the bridge was to revert by 1962 to New York State, which also had the right to acquire the bridge at any time. A $4.5 million bond issue was completed in April of that year through the Harriman banking and brokerage firm.

===Completion===
When the bridge formally opened on November 27, 1924, it was the longest suspension bridge span in the world, and the first of its type to have a concrete deck. It was the first automobile bridge to cross the Hudson south of Albany, and surpassed the 1888 Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge as the southernmost crossing of the river.

Construction methods pioneered on the Bear Mountain Bridge influenced much larger projects to follow, including the George Washington (1931) and Golden Gate (1937) bridges. Completion also inspired the state to extend the Bronx River Parkway from Kensico Dam northward, work which evolved into the Bear Mountain Parkway and the first phase of the Taconic State Parkway.

===New York State Bridge Authority===
Ownership was transferred to the New York State Bridge Authority on September 26, 1940, and the toll was reduced to a flat rate of 50 cents per automobile.

Originally, tolls were collected in both directions. In August 1970, the toll was abolished for westbound drivers, and at the same time, eastbound drivers saw their tolls doubled. The tolls of eleven other New York–New Jersey and Hudson River crossings along a stretch, from the Outerbridge Crossing in the south to the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in the north, were also changed to eastbound-only at that time.

In 1982 the bridge and its then-abandoned original toll house several miles away on the Peekskill approach road, Routes 6 and 202, were added to the National Register of Historic Places. The bridge was also designated as a local historic civil engineering landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1986.

In 2019, the bridge authority announced that tolls on its five Hudson River crossings would increase each year beginning in 2020 and ending in 2023. On May 1, 2021, the toll for passenger cars traveling eastbound on the Mid-Hudson Bridge was $1.75 in cash, $1.45 for E-ZPass users. In May 2022, tolls rose to $1.55 for E-ZPass users and $2 for cash payers. In 2023, the E-ZPass toll was set at $1.65, and the cash toll was set at $2.15. Tolls are collected from eastbound travelers only.

At midnight on October 1, 2021, the bridge was converted to all-electronic tolling and only in the eastbound direction. Motorists can use their E-ZPass to pay the toll. Those without E-ZPass are sent a bill in the mail.

===Maintenance innovation===
The Bridge was used to test several new materials designed to lower the cost and environmental impact of bridge cable maintenance. One of them proved promising.

During routine inspections, bridge cables are unwrapped and wedges are used to separate the individual strands. Inspectors look for signs of moisture and corrosion throughout the cable. For over 100 years, a red lead paste was used to seal the strands against moisture intrusion. In addition to emerging as an environmental hazard during that span, the paste was also prone to drying out and cracking after a few years, creating an ongoing maintenance task.

In the 1990s engineers experimented with several materials on a small section of the cables of the Bear Mountain Bridge. After a year the test areas were reexamined and one polymer-based, non-toxic paste was found to be superior. The bridge cables were then rewrapped in 2000 using the material. Seven years later the cables were found to be free of additional moisture or corrosion. New York State Bridge Authority chief engineer William Moreau expressed hope that the new material may lengthen the life of the cables, and lower the need for inspection and maintenance.

<doc id="1323675" wikidata="Q712590" url="?curid=1323675" title="František Tomášek">
<text>František Tomášek (30 June 1899, in Studénka, Moravia – 4 August 1992, in Prague, Czechoslovakia) was a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church in Bohemia, the 34th Archbishop of Prague, and a Roman Catholic theologian. His &quot;cautious but resolute opposition to the Czechoslovak communist regime helped to bring about its peaceful demise in the 1989 Velvet Revolution&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Born in 1899 in what was then part of the Austrian Empire, Tomášek was one of the six children of a schoolteacher who died when he was still a boy. After completing his schooling and military service, he studied at Saints Cyril and Methodius Faculty of Theology of Olomouc and was ordained on 7 May 1922. He taught religion in schools. Later he also taught at the Cyril and Methodius Faculty of Theology, where he obtained a doctorate in 1938. Soon after, the Nazi occupation led to the closure of Czech universities and Tomášek returned to teaching. After the war, Tomasek again taught in the faculty and also obtained a second doctorate.

===Episcopacy===
In spite of the opposition of the communist government in power in Czechoslovakia since February 1948, which, as well as imposing censorship on sermons and pastoral letters and banning many religious organisations, demanded its own approval for Church appointments, Pope Pius XII appointed Tomášek Auxiliary Bishop of Olomouc on 12 October 1949. Tomášek was secretly consecrated the very next day.

In 1950 Tomášek, with all the other bishops loyal to Rome, and half the priests were arrested and sent to labour camps. Monasteries and all but two of the Catholic seminaries were closed, and the Eastern-rite Catholic Church in Slovakia was banned. In 1953 Tomášek was freed from the Želiv camp, but allowed to function only as parish priest in the village of Moravská Huzová.

To the surprise of many, the government permitted him to attend the Second Vatican Council, the only Czechoslovak bishop able to participate in all the sessions (1962–1965).

In 1965 Cardinal Josef Beran, the Archbishop of Prague, was allowed to leave Czechoslovakia in accordance with an agreement that, in return for concessions to the Church, he would remain in Rome, and Tomášek was appointed on 18 February 1965 to administer the archdiocese, thus finally being permitted to leave Moravská Huzová.

Tomášek speedily pledged support for the reforms of the Prague Spring under Alexander Dubček in 1968. With the greater freedom allowed, he set about applying also the reforms instituted by the Second Vatican Council. The Soviet-led invasion of August 1968 again removed almost all the freedoms won under Dubček, though the state permission for the Eastern-rite Church to exist was not revoked.

===Cardinalate===
On 24 May 1976 Pope Paul VI secretly (&quot;in pectore&quot;) appointed Tomášek to the College of Cardinals. In the following year, the Pope felt the danger of reprisals by the Czechoslovak government was sufficiently diminished for him to publish the appointment on 27 June 1977. He also appointed Tomášek Archbishop of Prague, the see over which it had been considered more prudent to let Tomášek continue to have only the powers of an apostolic administrator even after the death of Cardinal Beran on 17 May 1969.

Tomášek took part in the August and October conclaves of 1978 that elected John Paul I and John Paul II. The latter, an old friend of Tomášek, infused new courage in the leaders of the Catholic Church in east-central Europe, including Tomášek, who proceeded to criticise government policies openly and to back initiatives by lay organisations demanding greater freedom, including Charter 77.

===Late life and death===
The Velvet Revolution of November 1989 was followed by Pope John Paul II&#x27;s April 1990 visit to Czechoslovakia, his first visit to a country, other than his native Poland, under a communist regime. On 27 March 1991, when Tomášek was almost 92 years old (long past the age of 75 at which bishops are to offer their resignation), his resignation from the governance of the Archdiocese of Prague was made effective. He died on 4 August 1992.

==His residence headquarters in Prague==
František Tomášek&#x27;s residence headquarters in Prague were used as the Emperor&#x27;s palace in the filming of &quot;Amadeus&quot;, according to the credits.

<doc id="1323679" wikidata="Q1755898" url="?curid=1323679" title="Mezzanine capital">
<text>Mezzanine capital is a type of financing that sits between senior debt and equity in a company&#x27;s capital structure. It is typically used to fund growth, acquisitions, or buyouts. Technically, mezzanine capital can be either a debt or equity instrument with a repayment priority between senior debt and common stock equity. Mezzanine debt is subordinated debt that represents a claim on a company&#x27;s assets which is senior only to that of the common shares and usually unsecured. Redeemable preferred stock equity, with warrants or conversion rights, is also a type of mezzanine financing.

Mezzanine capital is often a more expensive financing source for a company than secured debt or senior debt. The higher cost of capital associated with mezzanine financings is the result of it being an unsecured, subordinated (or junior) obligation in a company&#x27;s capital structure (i.e., in the event of default, the mezzanine financing is only repaid after all senior obligations have been satisfied). Additionally, mezzanine financings, which are usually private placements, are often used by smaller companies and may involve greater overall levels of leverage than issues in the high-yield market; they thus involve additional risk. In compensation for the increased risk, mezzanine debt holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or more senior lenders.

==Structure==
Mezzanine financings can be completed through a variety of different structures based on the specific objectives of the transaction and the existing capital structure in place at the company. The basic forms used in most mezzanine financings are subordinated notes and preferred stock. Mezzanine lenders, typically specialist mezzanine investment funds, look for a certain rate of return which can come from securities made up of any of the following or a combination thereof:

* Cash interest: A periodic payment of cash based on a percentage of the outstanding balance of the mezzanine financing. The interest rate can be either fixed throughout the term of the loan or can fluctuate (i.e., float) along with LIBOR or other base rates.
* PIK interest: Payable in kind interest is a periodic form of payment in which the interest payment is not paid in cash but rather by increasing the principal amount by the amount of the interest (e.g., a $100 million bond with an 8% PIK interest rate will have a balance of $108 million at the end of the period, but will not pay any cash interest).
* Ownership: Along with the typical interest payment associated with debt, mezzanine capital will often include an equity stake in the form of attached warrants or a conversion feature similar to that of a convertible bond. The ownership component in mezzanine securities is almost always accompanied by either cash interest or PIK interest, and, in many cases, by both.

Mezzanine lenders will also often charge an arrangement fee, payable upfront at the closing of the transaction. Arrangement fees contribute the least return, and their purposes are primarily to cover administrative costs or as an incentive to complete the transaction.

The following are illustrative examples of mezzanine financings:

* $100 million of senior subordinated notes with warrants (10% cash interest, 3% PIK interest and warrants representing 4% of the fully diluted ownership of the company)
* $50 million of redeemable preferred stock with warrants (0% cash interest, 14% PIK interest and warrants representing 6% of the fully diluted ownership of the company)

In structuring a mezzanine security, the company and lender work together to avoid burdening the borrower with the full interest cost of such a loan. Because mezzanine lenders will seek a return of 14% to 20%, this return must be achieved through means other than simple cash interest payments. As a result, by using equity ownership and PIK interest, the mezzanine lender effectively defers its compensation until the due date of the security or a change of control of the company.

Mezzanine financings can be made at either the operating company level or at the level of a holding company (also known as structural subordination). In a holding company structure, as there are no operations and hence no cash flows, the structural subordination of the security and the reliance on cash dividends from the operating company introduces additional risk and typically higher cost.

==Uses==
=== Leveraged buyouts ===
In leveraged buyouts, mezzanine capital is used in conjunction with other securities to fund the purchase price of the company being acquired. Typically, mezzanine capital will be used to fill a financing gap between less expensive forms of financing (e.g., senior loans, second lien loan, high yield financings) and equity. Often, a financial sponsor will exhaust other sources of capital before turning to mezzanine capital.

Financial sponsors will seek to use mezzanine capital in a leveraged buyout in order to reduce the amount of the capital invested by the private equity firm; because mezzanine lenders typically have a lower target cost of capital than the private equity investor, using mezzanine capital can potentially enhance the private equity firm&#x27;s investment returns. Additionally, middle market companies may be unable to access the high yield market due to high minimum size requirements, creating a need for flexible, private mezzanine capital.

===Real estate finance===
In real estate finance, mezzanine loans are often used by developers to secure supplementary financing for development projects (typically in cases where the primary mortgage or construction loan equity requirements are larger than 10%). These sorts of mezzanine loans are often secured by a second ranking real property mortgage (that is, ranking subordinate to the first mortgage lenders). Standard mortgage foreclosure proceedings can take more than a year, depending upon the relationship between the first mortgage lenders and the mezzanine debt lender, governed by an Intercreditor Deed.

<text>Trollkyrka (&quot;Troll&#x27;s church&quot;) is a secluded butte-like rock in the heart of the National Park of Tiveden, Sweden, which served as a pagan sacrificial ground (horgr, see also blót) for centuries after Christianity became the dominant religion in Scandinavia. It may have been used as late as the 19th century, when popular tradition still held the mountain to be off-limits for Christians.

According to Lidman (1972:52) old people used to say: &quot;No Christian can go there. The mountains of the troll church belong to the heathen trolls. If a Christian ventures there, he will come to grief.&quot;

In fact, local tradition relates that the mountain was used not long ago for heathen rites and that anyone who was not initiated and saw it risked either to be buried in a bog in the forest or sworn into the brotherhood. These precautions clearly indicate that the rites took place as late as the period 1604–1735, which was a time when there was a penalty of death on practising such rituals. The rites are described in a folk poem documented by the folklorist Carshult (1941) when he documented the traditions on Skaga stave church. It has later been published in Karlsson (1970:62) and Lidman (1972:52).

<doc id="1323711" wikidata="Q5546752" url="?curid=1323711" title="Georges Bank">
<text>Georges Bank (formerly known as St. Georges Bank) is a large elevated area of the sea floor between Cape Cod, Massachusetts (United States), and Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia (Canada). It separates the Gulf of Maine from the Atlantic Ocean.

The origin of its name is obscure. The 1610 Velasco map, prepared for King James I of England, used the name &quot;S. Georges Banck&quot;, a common practice when the name of the English patron saint, St. George, was sprinkled around the English-colonized world. By the 1850s, it was known simply as Georges Bank.

==Physical environment==
Georges Bank is the most westward of the great Atlantic fishing banks. The now-submerged portions of the North American mainland are comprised in the continental shelf running from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to Georges. Georges Bank was part of the North American mainland as recently as 12,000 years ago.

Roughly oval in shape, Georges Bank measures about in length by in width. Located offshore, Georges Bank is part of the continental shelf. Its depth ranges from several metres to several dozen metres; the entire bank is at least shallower than the Gulf of Maine to the north.

Gulf of Maine shelf waters are the Bank&#x27;s primary source. They enter the northern flank, move clockwise around the eastern end, and then westward along the southern flank, mostly emptying into the Mid-Atlantic Bight (the continental shelf ocean between Cape Hatteras and Georges Bank).

==Commercial fishing==

Georges Bank, while not having the most productive fishery in the world (the Grand Banks takes this claim), has great prominence in that it is probably the most geographically accessible of all the fishing banks in the North Atlantic. Lying adjacent to New England&#x27;s famous seaports, Georges Bank is singlehandedly responsible for the development of coastal fisheries in towns such as Gloucester, Massachusetts, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.

For over 400 years, Georges Bank supported lucrative fisheries for Atlantic cod and halibut. Over time, bottom trawlers became very efficient, some catching as much cod in an hour as traditional boats caught in a season. Bottom trawlers, however, damaged the sea floor coral and sponge habitats, and federal fisheries regulations aim to control this large scale overfishing to establish future sustainability.

From 1976 to 1982, oil companies drilled ten exploratory wells in the U.S. part of the Georges Bank. None were successful, however, and both Canada and the United States have since imposed moratoriums on oil exploration and production on the Georges Bank, to ensure fisheries conservation.

The decision by Canada and the United States to extend fisheries jurisdiction out to 200 miles in 1977 led to overlapping claims on Georges Bank, and resulted in quickly deteriorating relations between fishers from both countries. Both nations agreed in 1979 to refer the question of maritime boundary delimitation to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The ICJ delivered its decision in 1984 dividing Georges Bank fisheries between the two countries in a way that disappointed American fishermen. 
On September 15, 2016, President of the United States Barack Obama proclaimed the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument to protect the area&#x27;s marine biodiversity. This protected a portion of Georges Bank from fishing and mining. Despite the protection, commercial fishing for deep sea red crab and American lobster was allowed to continue within the monument for a grace period of seven years.

<doc id="1323716" wikidata="Q1412872" url="?curid=1323716" title="Vermonter (train)">
<text>The Vermonter is a passenger train operated by Amtrak between St. Albans, Vermont, and Washington, D.C., via New York City. It replaced the overnight &quot;Montrealer&quot;, which terminated in until 1995. Amtrak receives funding from the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont for &quot;Vermonter&quot; operations north of New Haven.

During fiscal year 2023, the &quot;Vermonter&quot; carried 99,974 passengers (not including riders between New Haven and Washington, D.C.), a 14.5% increase from FY22. In FY16, the train earned $5,718,268 in revenue, a decrease of 1.8% from FY15.

==History==
===Montrealer===
The &quot;Vermonter&quot; was preceded by an overnight train between Montreal and Washington that was known as the &quot;Montrealer&quot;, which was inaugurated in 1924 as a joint service of the Pennsylvania Railroad, the New Haven Railroad, the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, the Central Vermont Railway and the Canadian National Railway. Another train, the &quot;Ambassador&quot;, ran the same route during the daytime, but terminated in New York City. Both services used the Boston and Maine&#x27;s Connecticut River Line south of Vernon, Vermont, rather than the route prior to 2014 over the New England Central. Amtrak took over the train in 1971, and continued operating it until 1995 (excepting a brief suspension from 1987 to 1989).

===Vermonter===

The &quot;Vermonter&quot; replaced the &quot;Montrealer&quot; on April 1, 1995, bringing daytime Amtrak service to Vermont.

Business Class was added to replace the sleeping cars that were taken out of service upon the change to the &quot;Vermonter&quot;. The route was changed to allow travelers from Vermont to again stop in Springfield and Hartford. This was made possible by the use of cab cars, or engineer positions on both ends, so that the train could travel east from Springfield to Palmer, Massachusetts, and reverse direction to continue north on the Central Vermont. This detour added an hour of running time, but at the time was judged more practical than seeking to use the direct route over the then-decayed former Boston and Maine Railroad trackage owned by the Guilford Rail System. The train travels from Washington to New Haven on the Northeast Corridor, where electric locomotives are substituted for the diesel locomotives used north of that location.

Vermont declined to pay for continuing the &quot;Vermonter&quot; to Montreal due to high labor and terminal costs in Montreal. For a time, Amtrak offered passengers a connecting Amtrak Thruway bus service, operated by Vermont Transit, which met the train at St. Albans for connections to and from Montreal. Ridership plunged when the train schedule was moved two hours earlier, requiring a southbound departure before 5:00 a.m. The schedule was returned to its previous position, but the service was dropped by Vermont Transit (which had been running it without a subsidy as part of its regular schedule) on October 30, 2005.
On October 30, 2006, the &quot;Vermonter&quot; began stopping at the towns of Wallingford and Windsor Locks (near Bradley International Airport) in Connecticut for the first time.

In the late 2000s, Amtrak and the State of Vermont considered the purchase of diesel multiple unit (DMU) trainsets for use on the New Haven–St. Albans stretch of the line, with Amtrak offering a $2 million grant to help make the switch and market the new service. The new cars would purportedly have saved $4.25 million over three years, being four times more fuel efficient than a locomotive-hauled train. In 2008, the Vermont state legislature approved the purchase of five cars from Colorado Railcar at a cost of $18.2 million, but the company closed while the decision was awaiting approval of Governor Jim Douglas. With no other DMU designs available that were capable of operating in mixed traffic with other trains, the plan was dropped.

On November 9, 2010, the State of Vermont, Amtrak, and New England Central began a $70 million project to increase train speeds along the route in Vermont to between St. Albans and White River Junction, Vermont, and to between White River Junction and Vernon, Vermont.

On October 5, 2012, the Federal Railroad Administration announced the completion of track work within the states of Vermont and New Hampshire for the above-mentioned stimulus plan. Within the states of Vermont and New Hampshire of track were refurbished. The track work included installation of continuous welded rail, road-crossing improvements, ballast replacement, tie replacement, bridge repair and renovation, and embankment improvements. The top speed of the line within Vermont was increased to . The Massachusetts portion of the track work was completed in 2015.

On October 5, 2015, the southbound &quot;Vermonter&quot; derailed in Northfield, Vermont, after striking a rock slide. Five cars and the engine derailed; the engine and an empty car slid down an embankment. Five passengers and two crew members were injured, one seriously.

Starting June 9, 2018, the &quot;Vermonter&quot; no longer serves the and stations in Connecticut. These locations are served by other Amtrak trains and by the new Hartford Line commuter rail service.

In March 2020, the &quot;Vermonter&quot; was truncated to as part of a reduced service plan due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The move was forced after the pandemic prompted Vermont Governor Phil Scott to declare a state of emergency. The &quot;Vermonter&quot; resumed its full route on July 19, 2021, with $1 promotional fares on that date for travel within Vermont.

===2014 route change===

Until 1987, the &quot;Montrealer&quot; traveled on the Connecticut River Line between Springfield and Brattleboro with a stop in Northampton. Due to the deteriorating condition of the tracks in that section, Amtrak ceased service by the train.

When the &quot;Vermonter&quot; service restored train service between Springfield&#x27;s Union Station, Brattleboro and points north in 1995, the &quot;Vermonter&quot; traveled a somewhat-indirect route: east to Palmer, Massachusetts, and then north up the east side of the Connecticut River via Amherst, Massachusetts. It used CSX Transportation&#x27;s Boston Subdivision between Springfield and Palmer. At Palmer, it made a backup move on to the New England Central Railroad (NECR), as no direct track connection existed. Massachusetts later rehabilitated the more-direct Connecticut River Line route with $10 million in state and $73 million in federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds.

During rehabilitation of the Connecticut River Line, &quot;Vermonter&quot; service was restored to it on December 29, 2014. With the re-route, the train ceased stopping at , but a stop was restored to and, for the first time for Amtrak, a stop at was added. The re-route and consequent elimination of the backup move saved about 25 minutes of travel time between Springfield and Brattleboro when the line rehabilitation was completed, in early 2015. 

Although the backup move at Palmer is eliminated by the re-route, a short backup move at Springfield is still required due to the layout of the tracks. The tracks at Springfield Union Station run east-west, so the northbound &quot;Vermonter&quot; needs to curve into the station, back out, and switch back onto the tracks continuing north; the opposite move occurs for southbound trains.

In January 2015, the number of &quot;Vermonter&quot; riders using the two new stations (in Northampton and Greenfield) was up 84 percent compared to the equivalent station in Amherst the previous year. An infill stop in was added on August 27, 2015.

On March 26, 2020, service north of New Haven was temporarily suspended. On November 30, 2020, service was cut back further from New Haven to New York. This was done in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Service to St. Albans resumed on July 19, 2021.

===Planned extension of the &quot;Vermonter&quot; to Montreal===
Efforts have been underway for many years to extend the &quot;Vermonter&quot; to Montreal. In 2012, the Federal Railroad Administration awarded $7.9 million to allow for the upgrade of the existing freight rail line between St. Albans and the Canada–US border. Work on this project was completed in late 2014.

On March 16, 2015, Canada and the United States signed the &quot;Agreement on Land, Rail, Marine, and Air Transport Preclearance Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada&quot;. The agreement would allow for the establishment of a preclearance customs and immigration facility within Central Station in Montreal that could be used by both an extended &quot;Vermonter&quot; and Amtrak&#x27;s existing &quot;Adirondack&quot; train.

Before the &quot;Vermonter&quot; can be extended to Montreal, the United States Congress must pass enabling legislation for the preclearance agreement and the Parliament of Canada must ratify the agreement. Construction of a preclearance facility in Central Station is expected to take about three years: one year for planning and permitting and two years for construction. Construction of the preclearance facility is not expected to start until after the preclearance agreement has been approved by both governments. Enabling legislation was enacted by the United States on December 16, 2016, as the Promoting Travel, Commerce, and National Security Act of 2016. As of late 2018, logistics have delayed the extended route&#x27;s introduction until at least 2023. As of late 2021, according to Vermont transportation officials, while the United States remains active on the project, interest and engagement from regional and federal authorities on the Canadian side has frozen.

In 2021, VTrans looked into potential infrastructure upgrades that would allow the &quot;Vermonter&quot; to reach on sections in Vermont, up from . Saving around 1 hour 30 minutes between New Haven and Montreal, this scenario is forecast to incentivize an additional 31,100 to 40,900 riders per year by 2040. A key component to increasing the speed limit would be the installation of centralized traffic control from Greenfield to Brattleboro and from White River Junction to the border.

== Operation ==
=== Equipment ===
Most &quot;Vermonter&quot; trains consist of five cars hauled by a locomotive.

The passenger cars are the Amfleet I series passenger cars built by the Budd Company in the mid-to-late 1970s. Most trains include an Amfleet club car which has a combination of Business Class seating with a Café (food service/lounge) and four Coach Class cars.

Between St. Albans and New Haven, trains are pulled by a GE Genesis diesel locomotive at speeds up to . Between New Haven and Washington, the service operates over the Northeast Corridor which has overhead electric wires and trains are pulled by Siemens ACS-64 electric locomotives at speeds up to 

In the coming years all equipment will be replaced with Amtrak Airo trainsets, the railroad&#x27;s branding of its combination of Siemens Venture passenger cars and a Siemens Charger diesel-electric locomotive. The trainsets for the &quot;Vermonter&quot; will have six passenger cars, which will include a food service area and a mix of 2x2 Coach Class and 2x1 Business Class seating. The car closest to the locomotive will be a specialized &quot;Auxiliary Power Vehicle&quot; which will include a pantograph to collect power from overhead lines and will feed it to four traction motors in the car, and via a DC link cable, to the four traction motors in the locomotive. The arrangement will offer a near seamless transition between power sources at New Haven, a process that currently requires a time-consuming locomotive change.

=== Classes of service ===
All classes of service include complimentary WiFi, an electric outlet (120 V, 60 Hz AC) at each seat, reading lamps, fold-out tray tables. Reservations are required on all trains, tickets may be purchased online, from an agent at some stations, a ticketing machine at most stations, or, at a higher cost, from the conductor on the train.
*Coach Class: 2x2 seating. Passengers self-select seats on a first-come, first-served basis.
*Business Class: 2x1 seating with more legroom than coach. Passengers receive complimentary soft drinks. Seats assigned in advance.

=== Route ===

The &quot;Vermonter&quot; uses Amtrak and ConnDOT&#x27;s electrified Northeast Corridor line from Washington, D.C., to New Haven, Connecticut. After switching to a diesel locomotive at New Haven, it then uses the Amtrak-owned New Haven–Springfield Line north to Springfield, Massachusetts, and the MassDOT-owned Connecticut River Line between Springfield and Northfield, Massachusetts. From Northfield to St. Albans, Vermont, it traverses New England Central Railroad trackage. Weekend trains have an additional stop at Metropark station in Iselin, New Jersey.

The Vermont Agency of Transportation offers discounted fares for travel between most Vermont stations along the route.
