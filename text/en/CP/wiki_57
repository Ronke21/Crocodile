<text>A coadjutor bishop (or bishop coadjutor) (&quot;co-assister&quot; in Latin) is a bishop in the Latin Catholic, Anglican and (historically) Eastern Orthodox churches whose main role is to assist the diocesan bishop in administering the diocese. 

The coadjutor automatically succeeds the diocesan bishop when he retires, dies or leaves office for another reason. In the Latin Catholic Church, the coadjutor is a priest or bishop appointed by the pope in Rome. He is considered the principal deputy administrator of the diocese. 

In the Eastern Catholic churches, the adjutor may be appointed by the pope or by the church itself. Within the Anglican Communion, a diocesan committee appoints the coadjutor, who can be male or female. 

==Latin Church==
=== Role of coadjutor ===
In the Latin Church, the pope appoints a coadjutor to help the bishop govern the diocese. A bishop himself, the coadjutor can substitute for the diocesan bishop in his absence (Canon 403§3).The coadjutor must be a Catholic priest (all priests are male) and is usually a bishop or auxiliary bishop. 

Under canon law, the coadjutor must served as the vicar general, the principal deputy administrator of the diocese. The diocesan bishop must &quot;entrust to him [coadjutor] before others&quot; in acts that require a special mandate (Canon 406§1) If the episcopal see is an archdiocese, the coadjutor is appointed as an archbishop.

In modern church practice, the pope can appoint a coadjutor to assist a bishop who needs help due to declining health. The coadjutor can also assist a bishop nearing retirement. The objective is to have continuity of leadership in the diocese and avoid an unexpected vacancy in the position of bishop.

Pope Benedict XVI named Bishop Dennis Schnurr as coadjutor archbishop of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati in Ohio in the United States in October 2008 to assist Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk. When Pilarczyk retired in December 2009, Schnurr automatically became the diocesan archbishop without any ceremony.

In some situations, the pope may appoint a coadjutor to override the diocesan bishop in certain matters. These might include a public scandal or financial mismanagement of diocese. The problems are serious, but not bad enough for the pope to remove the diocesan bishop. 

In 2023, Pope Francis appointed Bishop François Touvet as coadjutor of the Diocese of Fréjus-Toulon in France to assist the elderly Bishop Dominique Rey. The pope gave Touvet special powers to oversee the preparation of seminarians and the financial management in the diocese. The Vatican had suspended the ordination of priests in the diocese in 2022.

In one instance, the pope appointed a coadjutor to a church that was not a diocese. In 2002, Pope John Paul II named Reverend Fernando Arêas Rifan as coadjutor of the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney in Brazil The pope took this action as part of the reconciliation agreement with the former Priestly Union of Saint John Mary Vianney that had broken with the Catholic Church.

=== Right of succession ===
The 1983 Code of Canon Law of the Latin Church stipulates that all coadjutors have the right of succession. The code also allows the pope to appoint an auxiliary bishop to a diocese &quot;with special faculties [powers]&quot;, but without the right of succession.

In 1986, Pope John Paul II appointed Reverend Donald Wuerl as an auxiliary bishop in the Archdiocese of Seattle in Washington State in the United States with &quot;special powers&quot; to override Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen. The pope was unhappy with Hunthausen&#x27;s handling of LGBTQ relations and other morality issues.

Under the old 1917 Code of Canon Law, the pope did not have to give an coadjutor &quot;cum jure succesionis&quot; (&quot;with the right of succession&quot;). In practice, the popes sometimes appointed coadjutors without the right of succession. These coadjutors usually served in large archdioceses. They might hold other important posts within the Catholic Church, or might be auxiliary bishops that the pope wanted to honor with the title of coadjutor.

For example, Pope Paul VI in 1965 appointed Auxiliary Bishop John J. Maguire as coadjutor of the Archdiocese of New York, one of the largest archdioceses in the United States, to assist Cardinal Francis Spellman. However, the pope denied Maguire the right of succession for when Spellman was no longer there.

== Eastern Catholic Churches ==
Some &quot;sui juris&quot; Eastern Catholic Churches also appoint coadjutors. However, the selection process differs among the churches.

* The patriarchal or major archiepiscopal synods of the larger &quot;sui juris&quot; ritual churches typically elect their coadjutors, with papal assent. 
* The pope typically appoints the coadjutors in the smaller &quot;sui juris&quot; ritual churches.

The coadjutor of an eparchy, archeparchy, or metropolis has the respective status of an eparch, archeparch, or metropolitan.

==Anglican communion==
In some provinces of the Anglican Communion, a bishop coadjutor (the form usually used) is a bishop elected or appointed to follow the current diocesan bishop upon the incumbent&#x27;s death or retirement.

In the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, when a diocesan bishop announces their intent to retire, they normally call for a special diocesan convention to elect a bishop coadjutor. The bishop coadjutor and diocesan bishop then serve jointly until the diocesan bishop dies or retires. The coadjutor automatically becomes the diocesan bishop.

A &quot;bishop suffragan&quot; is elected to assist the diocesan bishop under his direction, but without the inherent right of succession.

There have been bishops coadjutor in the Anglican Church of Australia without the right of succession to the diocesan see.

==List of Op-Center Novels==
The books in the &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Op-Center&quot; series:

==National Crisis Management Center (Op-Center)==
Although familiarly called &quot;Op-Center&quot;, the actual name of the largely autonomous agency is the &quot;National Crisis Management Center&quot;. The charter of the NCMC, or Op-Center, is unlike any other in the history of the United States. They handle both domestic and international crises. Director Paul Hood reports to the President himself, and what had started as &quot;an information clearinghouse with SWAT capabilities&quot; now has the singular capacity to monitor, initiate, and manage operations worldwide. The organization had its own paramilitary response team, called the Striker team, named by an Op-Center member who was a soccer fan, composed of members of the U.S. military special operations community. The series also mentioned similar organizations from England, whose response team was called Bengal, and Russia, with a team called Hammer. It is headquartered in a nondescript, two-story building located near the Naval Reserve flight line at Andrews Air Force Base that used to be a ready room, a staging area for crack flight crews. In the event of a nuclear attack, it would have been their job to evacuate key officials from Washington, D.C.

According to the 2014 reboot franchise, the NCMC was eventually disbanded after the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence managed to convince the President of the United States to shut the organization down due to the effectiveness of the US Intelligence Community and Special Forces in the War on Terror (much to the disgust of Paul Hood and Mike Rogers). Years later however, terrorists blow up several NFL stadiums across the country and leave thousands dead or mutilated. It is determined in the resulting investigation that the inability of government agencies to prevent the attacks was due to a lack of information, as well as the inability to put the pieces together in time. In response, the President executes an emergency order that reboots Op-Center for the 21st Century. Retired Admiral Chase Williams is eventually named the new director and Op-Center&#x27;s new headquarters is located in the basement of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; as its response team, Op-Center utilizes soldiers from the Joint Special Operations Command for overseas missions and a SWAT team from the FBI&#x27;s Critical Incident Response Group in order to respond to domestic emergencies.

==Net Force==
The third &quot;Op-Center&quot; novel, &quot;Games of State&quot;, briefly alludes to the concept of a &quot;Net Force&quot;. This concept was later expanded into its own &quot;Net Force&quot; series, created by the same men as &quot;Op-Center&quot; but written by Steve Perry (and later cowritten with Larry Segriff). No direct connection has yet been drawn between the two series, however.

==In other media==

&quot;OP Center&quot; was a 1995 made-for-TV movie starring Harry Hamlin as Paul Hood, newly minted director of the &quot;OP Center&quot;.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Sweets and Sour Marge&quot;, it reveals that Moe Szyslak&#x27;s favourite book is &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Op-Center&quot;.

<doc id="1338418" wikidata="Q5216380" url="?curid=1338418" title="Daniel Albright">
<text>Daniel Albright (October 29, 1945 – January 3, 2015) was the Ernest Bernbaum Professor of Literature at Harvard and the editor of &quot;Modernism and Music: An Anthology of Sources&quot;. He was born and grew up in Chicago, Illinois and completed his undergraduate studies on a full scholarship at Rice in 1967. He received his MPhil in 1969 and PhD in 1970, both from Yale. Albright is also the author of the book &quot;Quantum Poetics&quot; which was published by &quot;Cambridge University Press&quot; in 1997. He held an NEH fellowship from 1973 to 1974, was a Guggenheim Fellow from 1976 to 1977, and more recently, he was a 2012 Berlin Prize Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin.

Albright began his undergraduate career as a mathematics major, but changed to English literature. Although trained at Yale as a literary critic, after the publication of his book &quot;Representation and the Imagination: Beckett, Kafka, Nabokov, and Schoenberg&quot;, he was invited by the University of Rochester to come teach there as a kind of liaison between the department of English and the Eastman School of Music. At Rochester, he studied musicology, which forever changed his career. Much of his subsequent work has been on literature and music, culminating with his 2014 book, &quot;Panaesthetics&quot; which addresses many arts and examines to what extent the arts are many or are one. &quot;Putting Modernism Together&quot; was released posthumously, by Johns Hopkins University Press, and &quot;Music&#x27;s Monism&quot; in fall 2021 from the University of Chicago Press. He was hired in 2003 in the Harvard departments of English, but later joined the Comparative Literature department and soon began offering courses in the Music department as well.

==Career==

While Albright&#x27;s interests and writing subjects were wide-ranging, he received acclaim in three principal areas: as a scholarly commenter on poetry, in particular the poems of W. B. Yeats; as a musicologist; and as a theorist of multidisciplinary interpretation he termed &quot;panaesthetics.&quot; The sections below discuss these career phases in more detail.

===Yeats Scholar===

Albright&#x27;s advisor at Yale was Richard Ellmann, author of &quot;Yeats, The Man and the Masks&quot; (1948), a pivotal Yeats biography, and &quot;The Identity of Yeats&quot; (1953), a book-length analysis of the poet&#x27;s style and themes. Albright wrote of Ellman: &quot;A conversation about a poem of Yeats&#x27; with Richard Ellmann was like a stroll through a forest with an agreeable companion who not only knows the names of every bird, bush, lichen, and bug, but also hears sounds usually audible only to bats.&quot; Albright&#x27;s scholarship continues Ellmann&#x27;s biographical reading of Yeats, a complex endeavor, since Yeats reflected on his life indirectly in his poems, mainly through symbols and personae. Only gradually did Yeats allow a real person, with real problems and anxieties, to emerge.

In &quot;The Identity of Yeats,&quot; Ellman notes that beginning in the 1910s, Yeats&#x27; poems became &quot;openly autobiographical, the creation of a man capable of living in the world as well as of contemplating perfection. To make it so, he would have to lead
his life in such a way that it was capable of being converted into a symbol. Moreover, he could depict the speaker of his poems in a wider variety of situations, intellectual as well as emotional.&quot; Rather than speaking through fictional characters such as Michael Robartes and Owen Aherne, Yeats made himself a primary actor, with a somewhat rigid code of self-imposed rules
designed to prevent &quot;poetry where momentary emotions would over-bubble.&quot;

Albright&#x27;s criticism reads Yeats against Yeats, not to reduce the poems to biographical explanations but to understand them as symbolic manifestations of the poet (both real and idealized) at different stages of his career. Albright&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Myth against Myth: A Study of Yeats&#x27;s Imagination in Old Age,&quot; for example,
discusses how Yeats&#x27; later &quot;realist&quot; poems such as &quot;News for the Delphic Oracle&quot; and &quot;The Circus Animals&#x27; Desertion&quot; re-interpret themes and images of earlier, more self-consciously mythic works such as &quot;The Wanderings of Oisin.&quot;

Disagreeing with some of the book&#x27;s readings, Frank Kinahan&#x27;s review in &quot;Modern Philology&quot; concludes with strong praise: &quot;Albright is a close and sensitive reader of poetry, and there are exegeses here leaving you nodding Yes till your neck aches.&quot; Kinahan concludes: &quot;The years to come will show us that Yeats in his twenties and thirties was always on the verge of becoming
the realist that an older Yeats became. And it is work like Albright&#x27;s that is helping to bring that realization about.&quot;

In 1985, Albright published a review in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; of the Richard Finneran-edited &quot;Collected Poems of W. B. Yeats&quot;, a comprehensive 1983 volume based on the Macmillan Publishers edition. Echoing criticisms of Yeats scholar Norman Jeffares, Albright took Finneran to task for preserving Macmillan&#x27;s ordering of the poems, in particular placing that long but seminal early poem &quot;The Wanderings of Oisin&quot; at the end of the book. This was originally done by Macmillan in the 1930s for commercial reasons: the publisher felt that prospective buyers, browsing in bookstores, might be put off by a long poem at the beginning. Albright made the case for a pure chronological ordering of the poems, especially since &quot;Oisin&quot;&#x27;s themes reverberate throughout the later work. Albright also criticized Finneran&#x27;s reluctance to use biographical interpretations in his scholarly glosses:

[T]he chief curiosity of the commentary of the new edition is its omission of biography. I doubt that any annotator on earth besides Professor Finneran would consider it irrelevant that &quot;Upon a Dying Lady&quot; (1912–1914), a poem rich in circumstantial detail, is about a real woman, Mabel Beardsley, the sister of the artist Aubrey; but her name is omitted from the gloss, which instead talks about Petronius Arbiter and a warrior mentioned in the &quot;Rubáiyát&quot;. World history, literature, orthography are real to Professor Finneran; individual lives are not.

From this background eventually emerged Albright&#x27;s own definitive Yeats edition, &quot;The Poems,&quot; published in 1990 in the Everyman&#x27;s Library series. The book restores the chronological ordering of the verse, and contains several hundred pages of critical analysis, including biographical references lacking in the Finneran edition. As noted on Albright&#x27;s website, &quot;The Poems&quot; was &quot;edited with a view to presenting a close approximation to the &#x27;sacred book&#x27; Yeats hoped to bequeath to the world&quot; —that is, more like the essential volume under discussion during Yeats&#x27; lifetime, before those marketing considerations intervened during the Depression and became codified in subsequent editions. Harvard professor Philip Fisher described &quot;The Poems&quot; as &quot;[one] part Yeats, [one] part line-by-line commentary with wonderful mini-essays by Dan Albright on every topic in Yeats.&quot; Fisher laments that the book disappeared from the shelves but that is only true for the paperback edition: J. M. Dent currently publishes it in hardback in the United Kingdom.

===Musicologist===

Albright was a literature professor at the University of Virginia when he published his third book, &quot;Representation and the Imagination: Beckett, Kafka, Nabokov and Schoenberg&quot; (1980). The Schoenberg chapter prompted an invitation to teach at the University of Rochester, with Albright acting as a kind of liaison between the department of English and the Eastman School of Music. At Rochester, Albright published &quot;Untwisting the Serpent: Modernism in Music, Literature, and Other Arts&quot; (2000), recently described by Adam Parkes as &quot;an astoundingly original rewriting of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Laocoön&quot; (1766) in Modernist terms&quot;: 

Lessing famously divided spatial from temporal arts. Albright, however, conjectured that the division of the arts might be restated &quot;not as a tension between the temporal arts and the spatial, but as a tension between arts that try to retain the propriety, the apartness, of their private media, and arts that try to lose themselves in some panaesthetic
whole.&quot; To illustrate the latter, Albright examined the &quot;aesthetic hybrids and chimeras&quot; that resulted from artistic collaborations involving significant musical experiments in different media. While he recognized the value of attempts by various artists and critics to separate the arts, Albright&#x27;s preference for the panaesthetic was clear...

&quot;Untwisting&quot; relied on analysis of specific historical collaborations among artists (Cocteau, Picasso, and Satie in &quot;Parade&quot;; Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thompson in &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot;; Antheil, Léger, and Murphy in &quot;Ballet Mécanique,&quot; and many others) to show how the respective media in those pieces clicked or clashed. Discussing these components required stepping outside the usual province of the literary critic; that is, Albright needed to be just as adept and informed in making judgments about music and art as he was in evaluating writing. As it turned out, his talent for close reading of poems extended to scores and timbres, sufficiently to impress music&#x27;s critical community, despite a few complaints about his assumptions and definitions.

&quot;What the author refers to variously as fixed figures, fixed elements, ostinati, and pattern units -- all musical motives that repeat -- leap to the foreground of almost every analysis in this book,&quot; Ruth Longobardi wrote in &quot;Current Musicology&quot;,
&quot;and yet Albright never explicitly explains how to tell the difference between repeating motives that are dissonant and those that are consonant, or between those that are mimetic and those that are abstract.&quot; Nevertheless, she writes, &quot;his inquiry into different types of artistic collaboration is extremely valuable to musicology, since what it offers that field, frequently insulated from other disciplines, is a new path by which to enter an interdisciplinary consideration of Modernist music dramas.&quot;

In &quot;Kurt Weill Newsletter&quot;, David Drew wrote: &quot;Albright well understands that &#x27;paying attention to the text&#x27; is a discipline whose exactions are multiplied in proportion to the complexity of the interdisciplinary context. And yet: &#x27;this book tries to please by holding up to the light the fugitive but powerful creatures born from particular unions of music and the other arts.&#x27; It does please; or when it doesn&#x27;t, it stirs things up, which is
just as good.&quot;

Several reviewers were intrigued by Albright&#x27;s discussion of surrealism in music, and his identification of Francis Poulenc as a key figure. &quot;Before the recent publication of ... &quot;Untwisting the Serpent&quot;,&quot; writes Jonathan Kramer in his book &quot;Postmodern Music, Postmodern Listening&quot; (2016), &quot;there was little serious discussion of surrealism in music (although informally calling certain music surreal is certainly common enough). Music has been assumed not to have gone through much of a surrealist stage.&quot; Kramer admires Albright&#x27;s cross-disciplinary consideration of surrealism in musical theater, but believes &quot;Untwisting&quot; is &quot;most useful...is in [its] discussions of Poulenc’s specifically musical surrealism.&quot; He quotes these words of Albright&#x27;s from &quot;Untwisting&quot;:

I understand Poulenc’s manner of quotation -- and he was a music thief of amazing flagrancy -- not as a technique for making pointed semantic allusions, but as a technique for disabling the normal semantic procedures of music. … Poulenc is a composer of surrealizing misquotations.

Oliver Charles Edward Smith&#x27;s essay on Poulenc in &quot;Cogent&quot; quotes liberally from &quot;Untwisting&quot; as a &quot;comprehensive study of surrealism in music&quot; (while noting that Theodor W. Adorno was the first to apply the &quot;ism&quot; musically). Both Smith and Kramer favorably cite Albright&#x27;s explanation of the apparent (incongruous) conservatism of surrealism in music, compared to its wilder embodiments in the other arts, noting these passages from &quot;Untwisting&quot; [Kramer&#x27;s ellipses]:

Surrealism is a phenomenon of semantic dislocation and fissure. It is impossible to disorient unless some principle of orientation has been established in the first place. … In other words, you can’t provide music that means wrong unless you provide music that means something. … The surrealism of Poulenc and his fellows didn’t try to create a new language of music -- it simply tilted the semantic planes of the old language of music. Just as surrealist paintings often have a horizon line and a highly developed sense of perspective, in order that the falseness of the space and the errors of scale among the painted entities can register their various outrages to normal decorum, so surrealist music provides an intelligible context of familiar sounds in order to develop a system of meanings that can assault or discredit other systems of meanings.

===Multi-Disciplinarian===

&quot;Untwisting the Serpent&quot; limited its cross-disciplinary analysis to specific examples where musicians, artists, and writers collaborated. In Albright&#x27;s 2014 book &quot;Panaesthetics: On the Unity and Diversity of the Arts,&quot; he &quot;developed a more expansive and philosophical version of his arguments by ranging across the entire history of the arts,&quot; according to Adam Parkes. In his last book, &quot;Putting Modernism Together&quot; (2016), Albright renewed his pursuit of specifically Modernist forms of aesthetic hybridity. But whereas &quot;Untwisting&quot; deliberately cut across what Albright called the &quot;various isms that both organize and perplex the history of twentieth-century art,&quot; the final book &quot;confront[ed] those isms head-on, and recalibrate[d] the earlier account accordingly.&quot;

<doc id="1338427" wikidata="Q1129973" url="?curid=1338427" title="Southern Literary Messenger">
<text>The Southern Literary Messenger was a periodical published in Richmond, Virginia, from August 1834 to June 1864, and from 1939 to 1945. Each issue carried a subtitle of &quot;Devoted to Every Department of Literature and the Fine Arts&quot; or some variation thereof and included poetry, fiction, nonfiction, reviews, and historical notes. It was founded by Thomas Willis White, who served as publisher and occasional editor until his death, in 1843.

White hired Edgar Allan Poe in 1835 as a staff writer and critic. Others involved with the periodical included Matthew Fontaine Maury and Maury&#x27;s kinsman Benjamin Blake Minor. Publication ended in June 1864, in part because of Richmond&#x27;s involvement in the American Civil War, and was revived from 1939–1945.

==History==
The &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; first appeared in August 1834 with Thomas Willis White (1788–1843) as publisher. In the inaugural issue, he stated that his aim was &quot;to stimulate the pride and genius of the south, and awaken from its long slumber the literary exertion of this portion of our country.&quot; That was in reference to the fact that at the time, most magazines were published in Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia.

Edgar Allan Poe served as an editor for a time (see below). After his departure, White resumed editorial duties before he hired Lieutenant Matthew Fontaine Maury USN as editor from 1840 to 1843. Upon White&#x27;s death in 1843, Benjamin Blake Minor served as editor and publisher from August 1843 to October 1847.

The loss of writing and subscriptions led to the journal&#x27;s cancellation in June 1864. As was explained editorially in the last issue, the press in Richmond and the town in general had been thrown into considerable disarray by the American Civil War.

==Content==

The &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; featured poems, fiction, nonfiction, translations, reviews, legal articles, and Virginia historical notes. Each issue carried the subtitle &quot;Devoted to Every Department of Literature and the Fine Arts&quot; or some variation of it. The periodical was published approximately monthly, and it initially had subscribed mostly readers in the North but it picked up readers in the South and writers over time as more Southerners wrote articles to be published, as was stated in an 1840 issue of the &quot;Messenger&quot;. James E. Heath, the first editor of the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; wrote:
From our Northern and Eastern friends we have received more complimentary notices than from any of our Southern brethren without the limits of our own State. We say this not in a reproachful spirit, but in a somewhat sad conviction of mind, that we who live on the sunny side of Mason and Dixon&#x27;s line are not yet sufficiently inspired with a sense of importance of maintaining our just rights, or rather our proper representation in the Republic of Letters.

In February 1861, the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; defended the secession movement by publishing an article by William H. Holcombe, a doctor, entitled &quot;The Alternative: A Separate Nationality, or the Africanization of the South.&quot;

==Involvement of Poe==
Edgar Allan Poe was hired as a staff writer and critic in August 1835, possibly based on a recommendation to White from John Pendleton Kennedy.

Just a month later, White fired Poe, allegedly for his drinking habits, but rehired him in October. By December, Poe was made editor of the journal. While working for the &quot;Messenger&quot;, Poe published 37 reviews of American and foreign books and periodicals, cementing his place as a premier critic in the United States.

Poe was proud of his accomplishments with the journal and may have aided in a large jump in subscribers. In a letter years later, in 1844, Poe wrote that he began working when the &quot;Messenger&quot; had about 700 subscribers and left when it had 5,500 paying subscribers.

Besides criticism, Poe published many first printings of his now famous works in the &quot;Messenger&quot;, including the controversial &quot;Berenice&quot;, &quot;Morella&quot; and, in installments, parts of his only novel &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot;. Poe left the magazine with the January 1837 issue but still contributed works even after White&#x27;s death.

<text>In music, a canzonetta (; pl. canzonette, canzonetti or canzonettas) is a popular Italian secular vocal composition that originated around 1560. Earlier versions were somewhat like a madrigal but lighter in style—but by the 18th century, especially as it moved outside of Italy, the term came to mean a song for voice and accompaniment, usually in a light secular style.

== Origins in Italy ==

In its earliest form, the canzonetta was closely related to a popular Neapolitan form, the villanella. The songs were always secular, and generally involved pastoral, irreverent, or erotic subjects. The rhyme and stanza schemes of the poems varied but always included a final &quot;punch line.&quot; Typically the early canzonetta was for three unaccompanied voices, moved quickly, and shunned contrapuntal complexity, though it often involved animated cross-rhythms. It was fun to sing, hugely popular, and quickly caught on throughout Italy, paralleling the madrigal, with which it later began to interact. The earliest books of canzonettas were published by Giovanni Ferretti in 1567 and Girolamo Conversi in 1572.

By the 1580s some of the major composers of secular music in Italy were writing canzonettas, including Luca Marenzio and Claudio Monteverdi, who published his first set in 1584. Monteverdi was to return to the form with his ninth and final book of madrigals (published posthumously in 1651). Orazio Vecchi was another important composer of canzonettas in the 1580s. His canzonettas varied widely, and included some for dancing and some that parodied the excesses of the contemporary madrigal. Some composers, such as Roman School member Felice Anerio, adapted the form for a sacred purpose. Anerio wrote a set of sacred canzonette.

By the end of the century most canzonettas were for four to six voices, and had become more similar to the madrigal. Some composers who studied in Italy carried the canzonetta back to their home countries, such as Hans Leo Hassler, who brought the form to Germany.

== England ==

When the madrigal was imported into England in the late 16th century, the term canzonetta went along with it, anglicized to canzonet. Many compositions of the English Madrigal School were entitled canzonets, and although Thomas Morley referred to it specifically as a lighter form of madrigal in his writings, canzonets in England are almost indistinguishable from madrigals: they are longer than Italian canzonettas, more complex, and more contrapuntal.

== Later developments ==

During the 17th century, composers continued to produce canzonettas, but the form gradually changed from a madrigalian, &quot;a cappella&quot; genre to something more akin to a monody, or even a cantata. Eventually, the canzonetta became a type of song for solo voice and accompaniment. A late example of the form can be seen in the two sets of six by Joseph Haydn for voice and piano, on English texts (1794-5).

Sometimes the term canzonetta is used by composers to denote a songlike instrumental piece. A famous example is the slow movement of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto. A more modern example is the Canzonetta for Oboe and String Orchestra (1979/1981) by Samuel Barber.

The term has also been applied since the 17th century to mean &quot;little Canzona&quot; and has been used by such composers as Dieterich Buxtehude to apply to smaller Canzona-type keyboard works (often, like the Canzona, in fugue form and style). A good example of this is the Canzonetta in A minor, BuxWV 225.

<doc id="1338432" wikidata="Q1813350" url="?curid=1338432" title="Rebirth of Mothra">
<text>is a 1996 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film directed by Okihiro Yoneda, with special effects by Kōichi Kawakita. Produced and distributed by Toho Co., Ltd, the film serves as a reboot for the fictional giant monster character Mothra, and is the first installment in the &quot;Rebirth of Mothra&quot; trilogy. It was the final kaiju film produced under the supervision of Tomoyuki Tanaka, who produced such films as the original &quot;Mothra&quot;, which was released in 1961, as well as every film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise up to this point. He died of a stroke several months after the film&#x27;s release.

&quot;Rebirth of Mothra&quot; stars Sayaka Yamaguchi, Megumi Kobayashi, Aki Hano, and Kazuki Futami. It was released theatrically in Japan on December 14, 1996.

It was followed in 1997 by &quot;Rebirth of Mothra II&quot;.

==Plot==
Millions of years prior, a giant three-headed space dragon called Desghidorah arrives on Earth and battles a species of enormous and highly advanced moths who serve as protectors of the &quot;Elias&quot;, a race of tiny, humanoid beings. After the battle, Desghidorah is defeated and sealed under the Earth while three Elias, the benevolent Moll and Lora and the vengeful Belvera, and one moth, Mothra, remain.

In the present, as Mothra exhausts energy to lay an egg and preserve her species, a logging company uncovers Desghidorah&#x27;s subterranean prison and inadvertently break the seal containing it. Moll and Lora sensed something was awry and goes to Japan to investigate. One of the workers, Yuichi Goto, takes the seal home and gives it to his young daughter Wakaba as a souvenir. Taking advantage, Belvera, believing humans are the enemy, controls Wakaba, and makes her torture her brother Taiki. Moll, Lora, and a smaller Mothra named Fairy battle Belvera for control of the artifact, though Belvera prevails. Moll and Lora befriend Taiki, Wakaba, and their mom and they all travel to the site containing the seal in hopes of stopping Belvera. But she releases Desghidorah and uses him to help her destroy humanity before they can destroy her race. As the dragon drains the environment&#x27;s lifeforce, Mothra is summoned to fight it despite her condition. Amidst the battle, Mothra&#x27;s larva senses her mother&#x27;s deteriorating strength and hatches prematurely to help her. Though her energized silk seems to turn the tide of battle, Desghidorah bites the larva and drains its energy. Desperate, Mothra airlifts her child to safety and lures the dragon to a dam to distract it. After lowering her child into the sea, Mothra collapses from her age, wounds, and weariness and sinks to her death. The distraught larva attempts to save her mother, but to no avail, and swims away. Moll and Lora are able to take the seal back from Belvera, and give it to Taiki and Wakaba for safekeeping while they search for the larva.

Angered, the young moth creates a cocoon and metamorphoses while Desghidorah goes on a rampage. While Taiki and Wakaba are witnessing the destruction left in the wake of the monster, Moll and Lora encourage them not to lose hope. Soon after, the new Mothra emerges in her imago form and battles Desghidorah. Drawing upon an ancient legacy, Mothra eventually renews the seal that originally bound the dragon, defeating him, and saving Earth. Belvera then escapes, vowing for revenge. After restoring a blasted region he had destroyed, Mothra travels to her ancestral home as Moll and Lora thank the children for helping them and return home to Infant Island with Fairy.

<text>Lawrencine May &quot;Lorrie&quot; Collins (May 7, 1942 – August 4, 2018) was an American country, rockabilly and rock and roll singer. Beginning in the mid-1950s, she and her brother, Larry Collins, performed as the Collins Kids.

==Early life==
Born in Creek County, Oklahoma, near Sapulpa, Collins and her brother Larry were individually musically talented as young children. Their parents relocated them to Southern California to develop their music. They soon became paired as a musical duo.

==Career==
In the late 1950s, Collins was the girlfriend of television star and teen idol Ricky Nelson on both the Nelson family&#x27;s top-rated show &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie &amp; Harriet&quot; and in private life. She made her debut on January 22, 1958, in an episode titled &quot;The Picture in Rick&#x27;s Notebook&quot; in which she played the dual role of sisters (the older one being David Nelson&#x27;s; the younger sister, not yet even in high school, being Ricky&#x27;s potential paramour). In this first episode, Nelson and Lorrie performed a duet of &quot;Just Because&quot;, which had been one of the Collins Kids&#x27; signature songs (Lorrie played her own guitar and covered the name Collins on the neck with her left hand). A month later, her brother made a guest appearance on the show in an episode titled &quot;Who Is Betty?&quot;, which aired on February 19, 1958.

In 1959, when Collins was 17, she married Stu Carnall, who was Johnny Cash&#x27;s manager and twice her age. She continued acting and singing with Nelson on television and recording and touring with her brother until 1961 when she gave birth to her first child. The Collins duo continued to perform into the 1960s, appearing as regulars in the 1963 Canadian music series &quot;Star Route&quot;, and later made appearances on &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; as late as 1967. Many of their performances on &quot;Town Hall Party&quot; were released on DVD by Bear Family Records of Germany; a CD of their work on the show &quot;Rockin&#x27; on T.V.&quot; was released in 1993 on the Krazy Kat label in Europe.

With her brother, Collins is a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.

She and her brother performed together again in 1992 and 1993, mostly at music festivals.

==Death==
Collins died on August 4, 2018, in Reno, Nevada, from complications of a fall at the age of 76.

<doc id="1338443" wikidata="Q2210337" url="?curid=1338443" title="Sakellarios">
<text>A sakellarios () or sacellarius is the title of an official entrusted with administrative and financial duties (cf. &quot;sakellē&quot; or &quot;sakellion&quot;, &quot;purse, treasury&quot;) in a government or institution. The title was used in the Byzantine Empire with varying functions and the title remains in use in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

== Civil administration ==
The first known &quot;sakellarios&quot; was a certain Paul, a freedman appointed by Emperor Zeno (reigned 474–491). Hence, the &quot;sakellarios&quot; usually is presumed to have headed a &quot;sakellion&quot; (or &quot;sakella&quot;, &quot;sakelle&quot;), a term that appears in early Byzantine sources with the apparent sense of &quot;treasury&quot;, more specifically of &quot;cash&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;vestiarion&quot; that was for goods. 

Despite the origin of the term, the &quot;sakellarioi&quot; of the early Byzantine period (fifth–seventh centuries) are not directly associated with financial matters. Rather they appear connected with the imperial bedchamber (&quot;koiton&quot;), bearing court titles such as &quot;spatharios&quot; or &quot;koubikoularios&quot;, while some holders of the office were entrusted with distinctly non-financial tasks: Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641) appointed the &quot;sakellarios&quot; Theodore Trithyrius to command against the Arabs, and yet another &quot;sakellarios&quot; conducted the examination of Maximos the Confessor under Constans II (r. 641–668). 

It is only in the early eighth century that &quot;sakellarioi&quot; are directly mentioned as treasurers. By the time of the &quot;Taktikon Uspensky&quot; of c. 843, the &quot;sakellarios&quot; had become a general comptroller of the fiscal bureaux (the &quot;sekreta&quot;), with notaries reporting to the office holder in each department. The head of the &quot;sakellion&quot; department from this period on became the &quot;chartoularios tou sakelliou&quot;.

From the late eleventh century, the prefix &quot;megas&quot; (&quot;grand&quot;) was added to it.
The post continues in evidence until at least 1196, although for a time, it may have been subsumed into that of the &quot;megas logariastes&quot; under Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118). 

== Ecclesiastical administration ==
Imitating the practice of the imperial court, the Patriarchate of Constantinople had its own &quot;sakellion&quot;. Like the office holder&#x27;s secular counterpart, the patriarchal &quot;sakellarios&quot; lost its function as treasurer. By the late eleventh century the ecclesiastic official took over the supervision of donations to, and the administration of, the monasteries of Constantinople. At the same time, it also acquired the prefix &quot;megas&quot; and replaced the &quot;megas skeuophylax&quot; as the second-most important official of the patriarchate. By the thirteenth century, the institution of &quot;megas sakellarios&quot; had been replicated in the provincial sees as well.

<text>Shibpur is a neighbourhood in Howrah of Howrah district in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is a part of the area covered by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA).

It is well known for being the location of the Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden, the IIEST Shibpur and the Hajar Hath Kali Temple. The famous Bengali linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji was born in Shibpur. During British Raj, its name was written as Seebpore.

==History==

The Haldars were the founders &amp; landowners of Shibpur more than 750 years ago. The Halders were in business, establishing their fortunes in Kolkata, namely started &amp; flourishing under the guidance of Nilmoni Halder, Pulin Behari&#x27;s grandfather. The town of Shibpur was founded during the reign of the Bengal Sultanate.

The area was home to many royal landlords (zamindars) in Bengal. During the era of British rule in India, the landlords sold their possessions to build jute mills. These included the successful jute mills such as the Howrah Jute Mill and the Bengal Jute Mill. The proximity to Kolkata&#x27;s southern district and the central business district which is just across the river brought many middle-class office goers to seek cheaper lodging in Shibpur. Some of the old zamindar house in Shibpur is like Roy Choudhury&#x27;s and Mukherjee bari in Chaterjeehat named as Digambar Mukhopadhyay Attalika. The Roy Chowdhury family stayed in Shibpur for near about 500 years at Sanjher Attchala and Mukhopadhyay family is staying in Chaterjeehat for more than 300 years. Botanical Garden was a British determent area. Then after freedom, the Indian government took a long place from the garden and made the college. Pulin Behari Halder was the founder president of all the girls&#x27; schools &amp; colleges in Shibpur.
The oldest banyan tree is in the Shibpur B. Garden. Its original root has been destroyed many years ago and the tree sprayed a lot through its branches. This tree was taken from Africa by the British government.
Batai Chandi Temple (considered an avatar of Goddess Kali) and Char Mandir are other notable places of Shibpur.

==Recent developments==

Before the Vidyasagar Setu project, a vast tract of land near used to be a marsh and was only dotted by few villages. This is in the distant past now after building the iconic bridge and the Kona expressway easily connecting the place with heart of Kolkata and the national highway and the industrial sector in Dasnagar.

Notably, the Kolkata Port was connected to the rest of India easier than the other existing route through Howrah Bridge and Bally bridge which are famous for their congested rush hour traffic. As a result of that, the place has good attention recently all over again. The town saw an immediate rush for land after the proposal for the bridge. Now various important buildings of the district are located in the town, namely the water purifying plant at Padmapukur, the Dumurjala Indoor Stadium and a good number of women&#x27;s hockey clubs. The first Garment Park of Eastern India, initiated by the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) is coming up at the approach to Vidyasagar Setu.

The secretariat of Mamata Banerjee-run West Bengal Government is shifted permanently to the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners or HRBC made 16 storied with basement and ground floor the &#x27;Garment Park&#x27; building popularly known as &#x27;Nabanna&#x27; at Shibpur from 1 October 2013, as the restoration of 236-year-old Writers&#x27; Buildings is shortly for cost of Rs. 2,000 million.

The hospital provides an aggregate of 41 services along with a cancer support cell, which aims to raise funds for cancer patients, physiotherapy, nutrition, preventive health checks, counselling, emergency services and trauma care.

Shibpur is also geared towards luxury living with some big real estate projects like Ideal Grand, Clubtown Riverdale building up luxury apartments with plenty of open spaces and amenities of mini townships in old Tram Depot area and Shibpur market between G.T. Road and Foreshore Road. That place is currently occupied by dilapidated warehouses. Over the last ten years, Shibpur has developed into a popular residential community. Many multi-storied apartment complexes have been built (e.g. Shree Apartment - being one of the oldest, Vivek Vihar - the complex widely spread, Panchsheel Apartments) attracted by the location near the River Ganges, as well as by the easy connection to South Kolkata through the Vidyasagar Setu. Newly constructed roads have made access to the area very easy. Many parts have turned up as a transportation gateway to Kolkata.

Heavyweight transportation businesses are also growing in the Shalimar area.

<text>A contact list is a collection of screen names. It is a commonplace feature of instant messaging, Email clients, online games and mobile phones. It has various trademarked and proprietary names in different contexts.

Contacts lists&#x27; windows show screen names that represent actual other people. To communicate with someone on the list, the user can select a name and act upon it, for example open a new E-mail editing session, instant message, or telephone call. In some programs, if your contact list shows someone, their list will show yours. Contact lists for mobile operating systems are often shared among several mobile apps.

Some text message clients allow users to change their display name at will, while others only allow them to reformat their screen name (add/remove spaces and capitalize letters). Generally, it makes no difference other than how it is displayed.

With most programs, the contact list can be minimized to keep it from getting in the way, and is accessed again by selecting its icon.

The style of the contact list is different with the different programs, but all contact lists have similar capabilities.

Such lists may be used to form social networks with more specific purposes. The list is not the network: to become a network, a list requires some additional information such as the status or category of the contact. Given this, contact networks for various purposes can be generated from the list. Salespeople have long maintained contact networks using a variety of means of contact including phone logs and notebooks. They do not confuse their list with their network, nor would they confuse a &quot;sales contact&quot; with a &quot;friend&quot; or person they had already worked with.

<doc id="1338461" wikidata="Q700725" url="?curid=1338461" title="Birdy (film)">
<text>Birdy is a 1984 American drama film based on William Wharton&#x27;s 1978 novel of the same name. Directed by Alan Parker, it stars Matthew Modine and Nicolas Cage. Set in 1960s Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the film focuses on the friendship between two teenage boys, Birdy (Modine) and Al Columbato (Cage). The story is presented in flashbacks, with a frame narrative depicting their traumatic experiences upon serving in the Vietnam War.

Parker initially turned down an opportunity to direct, believing that the complex book could not be successfully adapted for a feature film. The project resurfaced in 1982 when A&amp;M Films, a subsidiary of A&amp;M Records, acquired the film rights and commissioned Sandy Kroopf and Jack Behr to write the screenplay. Upon reading the script, Parker returned as director, and the film continued development at Tri-Star Pictures. Principal photography began in May 1984 and concluded in August of that year. Filming took place on locations in Philadelphia and Santa Clara, California. The film is notable for being the first to be partially shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled camera system created by Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown. The score was composed by Peter Gabriel.

&quot;Birdy&quot; opened in limited release on December 12, 1984. It underperformed at the North American box office, grossing only $1.4 million against a budget of $12 million. The film received mostly positive reviews, and has an approval rating of 83% at Rotten Tomatoes. &quot;Birdy&quot; was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the Top Ten Films of 1984, and won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury prize at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
In a 1960s working-class neighborhood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a teenage boy nicknamed &quot;Birdy&quot; befriends his next-door neighbor Al Columbato, and relates to his fascination with birds and their ability to fly. The two begin pursuing Birdy&#x27;s hobby of catching pigeons and caging them in a large, wooden aviary that he has built outside his parents&#x27; home.

One night, the teenagers climb atop a refinery building, where Birdy hangs on the ledge to catch the pigeons roosting on it. Birdy loses his grip and falls several stories, but he lands on a pile of sand. Slightly dazed, he tells Al that during the fall, he flew. After Birdy is hospitalized for minor injuries, his parents dismantle the aviary.

Birdy concedes to Al&#x27;s wishes of pursuing another venture. After they purchase and restore a 1953 Ford automobile, Al&#x27;s father registers the vehicle. Al drives Birdy to an Atlantic City boardwalk, but they are arrested the next day after Mr. Columbato reports the car stolen. After bailing the boys out of jail, Mr. Columbato sells the vehicle. Birdy later confronts him, claiming that the car was not his to sell. Mr. Columbato offers Birdy a sum of money, which Birdy refuses in principle.

Birdy builds a new aviary in his bedroom and purchases two canaries. He names the female Perta and the male Alfonso (after his friend). Upon returning to school, Birdy encounters a classmate, Doris Robinson, and Al encourages him to ask her out on a date. At the prom, Birdy dances unenthusiastically with Doris, leaving her confused and humiliated. Afterwards, Doris drives him to a secluded spot, where Birdy lightly rejects her sexual advances. Birdy returns home to his bedroom and lies down naked in the aviary. In a semi-conscious state, he expresses that he wants to die and be born again as a bird. He then imagines himself flying like a bird around his room, throughout the house and outside in the neighborhood.

Upon graduation, Al enlists and Birdy is drafted into the United States Army. During the Vietnam War, Birdy is placed in a mental hospital after being missing in action for a month. A flashback reveals that he was the sole survivor of a helicopter crash. Al is hospitalized in the same facility. His face is heavily bandaged for injuries that he sustained from an exploding bomb. Major Weiss, a military doctor, informs Al that, although Birdy&#x27;s injuries are relatively minor, Birdy has not spoken since he was found. Al speaks to Birdy at length, but Al grows increasingly frustrated by his lack of response. He is then elated when Birdy smiles at a joke he makes. Weiss dismisses the response as dissociative behavior.

Al suspects Birdy of feigning insanity to hide from the world, and he expresses to Birdy that he too wishes to hide due to his own injuries. Birdy unexpectedly responds by telling Al that he is &quot;full of shit&quot;. Al alerts Weiss to Birdy&#x27;s response, but when the doctor arrives, Birdy remains silent. Not seeing any progress, Weiss orders Al to leave, but Al pushes the doctor aside. After Weiss flees, two orderlies are sent in to subdue Al, who fights them and takes Birdy to the roof of the hospital. Birdy rushes to the ledge, raises his arms and jumps off the side of the roof as if he were about to fly. Thinking Birdy has plunged to severe injury, Al runs over to the ledge but finds Birdy on another level of the roof, perfectly fine. Birdy looks up at Al and says, &quot;What?&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Following publication of William Wharton&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;Birdy&quot;, Alan Parker received galley proofs of the book from his agent, who advised him that the novel was going to be optioned. Upon reading the novel, Parker discussed it with his colleague, producer Alan Marshall, before turning down the opportunity to direct a film adaptation. He explained, &quot;So much of the story happened inside the boy&#x27;s head, and the poetry of the book was literary. To make it cinematic - I didn&#x27;t know if I could make the jump.&quot; In September 1979, Orion Pictures optioned the novel for $150,000.

In October 1982, A&amp;M Films, a newly established subsidiary of A&amp;M Records, acquired the film rights and commissioned Sandy Kroopf and Jack Behr to write the screenplay. Kroopf and Behr made various changes from the novel, opting to focus primarily on the friendship between Birdy and Al Columbato. They also decided to set the story during the Vietnam War, as opposed to the novel, which is set during World War II. &quot;We were in high school in the mid-1960s,&quot; Behr explained, &quot;so growing up then was our experience.&quot; Structuring the film required Kroopf and Behr to create a nonlinear narrative, and manufacture much of its action and dialogue from Al&#x27;s narrative in the novel. They spent one year trying to sell their script to various studios, without success. In 1983, Parker received the script from A&amp;M and, after reading it, signed on as director. He then discussed the adaptation with executives at Tri-Star Pictures. After the studio agreed to produce the film, Parker traveled to Los Angeles, where he met with Kroopf and Behr to work on the script.

===Casting===
Parker and casting director Juliet Taylor held open casting calls in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, New York City and Philadelphia. Matthew Modine originally auditioned for the role of Al Columbato, but Parker decided to cast him as Birdy, believing that the actor possessed an &quot;introverted honest quality&quot; that best suited the character. Modine said, &quot;I was flabbergasted because I hadn&#x27;t auditioned for Birdy. I had never imagined playing the part of Birdy. So, I had to really go through an extraordinary transformation in my mind of trying to bring this remarkable character to life. It was an incredible experience making the film.&quot;

Nicolas Cage was cast as Al Columbato. He reflected, &quot;I was terrified of the role of Al, because it was like nothing I&#x27;d ever done before, and I didn&#x27;t know how to get to the places the role was asking me to go emotionally.&quot; For scenes in which Al&#x27;s face is disfigured and swathed in bandages, Cage lost 15 pounds and had two of his front teeth pulled out. &quot;I wanted to look like I was hit by a bomb,&quot; he said. &quot;It gave me a feeling of something I had lost. I felt this was a once-in-a-lifetime part, and it deserved that much.&quot;

Elizabeth Whitcraft had been working as a waitress in Philadelphia before she was cast as Rosanne, a teenage girl who makes out with Al. The film marked her feature film debut. Maude Winchester secured the role of Doris Robinson, a teenage girl who Birdy encounters, during auditions in San Francisco. Dolores Sage, also making her film debut, plays Birdy&#x27;s mother. Danny Glover secured the role of Mr. Lincoln, a bird owner who befriends Birdy, but Parker had his scene removed from the final film, explaining that it &quot;was rather misplaced within the framework of [the] story&quot;.

===Filming===
====Pre-production====
Parker originally planned to shoot scenes in Oakland, California, before visiting the actual Philadelphia locations described in the novel. Upon arriving in Philadelphia, he and producer Alan Marshall set up production offices at a Holiday Inn hotel. Location scouting began as Parker was holding casting calls in New York City. Location manager Rory Enke and production designer Geoffrey Kirkland visited run-down areas of Philadelphia, and offered suggestions to Parker on his weekend visits from New York. Parker made an arrangement with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) that permitted the British crew members to work alongside members of both the east and west coast union locals. He had to employ no less than four members of the two camera locals in order to allow his past collaboratorsdirector of photography Michael Seresin, camera operator Michael Roberts and editor Gerry Hamblingto work on the film.

====Principal photography====
Filming was scheduled to start in December 1983, but was postponed for six months to accommodate Modine&#x27;s shooting schedule for &quot;Mrs. Soffel&quot; (1984). Principal photography began in Philadelphia on May 15, 1984, with a budget of $12 million. The script required that a total of 24 locations be used for filming in Philadelphia and Santa Clara, California. Animal trainer Gary Gero employed the use of 80 different canaries for various scenes in the film, as well as pigeons, a hornbill, a cat, eighteen dogs and a seagull.

A women&#x27;s prison wing located in the Philadelphia House of Correction doubled for a scene set in an Atlantic City jail. A scene depicting Birdy and Al climbing an elevated railway was filmed at the 46th Street Station above the intersection of Farragut and Market Street in the Mill Creek neighborhood. The cast and crew then moved to Philadelphia City Hall, where Wilson Goode, the city&#x27;s first African American mayor, visited the set and gave the production his blessing.

After four weeks of filming in Philadelphia, the cast and crew moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk. Filming then moved to San Francisco, California. The scene where Birdy and Al climb atop a refinery building was filmed on the rooftop of an abandoned gasworks in Hercules, California. The scene required Modine and Cage to hang off the edge of the roof secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy falls off the roof was performed by a stunt double.

The production next filmed Birdy&#x27;s flight on an ornithopter at the Newby Island landfill in Santa Clara County. The filming of the scene was considered to be a health concern among the cast and crew, due to the exposed garbage and smell of methane gas. The filmmakers originally planned to shoot Birdy landing in a reservoir thirty feet away from the landfill, but a test of the water had shown it to be hazardous. Parker said, &quot;We experimented with a 100-foot wire hanging from a helicopter to allow us to &#x27;fly&#x27; Birdy into a pond we&#x27;d constructed at the bottom of a hill of garbage.&quot; The military hospital scenes were filmed at the Agnews Developmental Center, a psychiatric and medical care facility located in Santa Clara. A corner of the hospital was used to film scenes set in Birdy&#x27;s bedroom.

The production then moved to Stockton, California to depict a scene involving Al aboard a train. The Vietnam War sequences were filmed in Modesto, California, where the art department found difficulty in pinpointing filming locations, as the entire area was flooded. The use of helicopters during filming was the subject of frequent discussions with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), following an accident during the production of &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; (1983). The special effects department used fifteen 20-gallon drums of gasoline rigged with explosive charges to depict a napalm strike. A total of four cameras were used to film the explosions. Principal photography concluded in early August 1984.

====Cinematography====
The film was the first to be partially shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled, cable-suspended camera system created by Garrett Brown, inventor of the Steadicam. The Skycam had 100-foot high posts with four hanging wires controlled by a computer, and a lightweight Panavision camera with 200 feet of film hung at the center of the wires. The filmmakers intended to use the Skycam to fully depict Birdy&#x27;s point of view during a fantasy sequence in which he imagines himself as a bird flying, but they encountered difficulties, as the camera would often malfunction. Although the Skycam proved successful on its first take, Parker insisted that the filmed footage be shot more rapidly, but the camera system malfunctioned during its second take, after capturing 40 seconds of footage. This resulted in the camera operators shooting the remainder of the sequence with a Steadicam mounted on top of an improvised camera dolly.

===Music===


The score was written, co-produced and composed by English singer and songwriter Peter Gabriel, and marked his first work on a feature film. During post-production, Parker had been incorporating the percussive rhythms from Gabriel&#x27;s solo albums into the film. He contacted the musician&#x27;s manager David Geffen, who advised him that producing the soundtrack would be a slow process, as Gabriel was known for working at his own pace. While working on his fifth studio album &quot;So&quot;, Gabriel agreed to score &quot;Birdy&quot; after viewing a rough cut of the film.

Recording sessions took place at the Ashcombe House in Somerset, England, from October to December 1984. Gabriel used tapes of previously recorded material from the past four years, which he and music producer Daniel Lanois remixed for select scenes in the film. The score &quot;Close Up&quot; originated from the song &quot;Family Snapshot&quot; (from Gabriel&#x27;s third album), which was composed on a Yamaha CP-70 Electric Grand Piano. The track &quot;Birdy&#x27;s Flight&quot; is based upon the instrumental outro of &quot;Not One of Us,&quot; also from Gabriel&#x27;s third album. &quot;The Heat&quot;, &quot;Under Lock and Key&quot; and &quot;Powerhouse at the Foot of the Mountain&quot; borrowed musical elements from &quot;The Rhythm of the Heat,&quot; &quot;Wallflower,&quot; and &quot;San Jacinto,&quot; all songs on Gabriel&#x27;s fourth album, which had been composed on a Fairlight CMI IIx, a music workstation with an embedded digital sampling synthesizer.

The soundtrack album, entitled &quot;Birdy: Music from the Film&quot;, was released on March 18, 1985, by Geffen Records and Charisma Records. AllMusic&#x27;s Tom Demalon awarded it four stars out of five, writing, &quot;The fact that &quot;Birdy&quot; is all instrumentals means that listeners whose familiarity with Gabriel is limited to &#x27;Sledgehammer&#x27; and &#x27;In Your Eyes&#x27; will be largely disappointed. However, its meditative nature makes it fine, reflective listening for the more adventurous.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Spin&quot; in 1986, Gabriel said, “&quot;Birdy&quot; was about the struggle of the spirit... It was about the interplay between the traumatized Birdy, the wounded victim, and his best friend, who’s ostensibly the tough one. But in the end, it’s Birdy who’s strong and his friend who’s cracking. When I saw the rough cut of the film, I knew I had to do it. It haunted me.”

Recalling in 2010 his experience of working with Gabriel, Alan Parker told &quot;Prog&quot; magazine, &quot;We got on so well, he’s such a sweet man. It was such a refreshing change from working with megalomaniacs like Roger Waters. Peter’s record company were very difficult to begin with, and so I phoned them to ask if they’d mind if Peter took a little time to do this, and they said as long as it didn’t take more than a couple of months because Peter was already a year late or something. He had strong views and I would never be able to persuade him to do something he didn’t feel comfortable with, but we didn’t have any confrontation as such.&quot;

==Release==
Tri-Star Pictures had planned to release the film using a platform technique which involved opening it in select cities before releasing it nationwide. The studio was confident that the limited theatrical run would generate strong-word-of-mouth interest and awards consideration for the film. &quot;Birdy&quot; opened in limited release on December 21, 1984, in New York City, Los Angeles and Toronto. The film&#x27;s failure to garner any award nominations during the limited run resulted in Tri-Star cancelling a wide release scheduled for late January 1985. In response, A&amp;M Films prompted the studio to refocus the film&#x27;s marketing campaign. Tri-Star adjusted its promotional focus on the friendship between Birdy and Al, while Parker, Modine and Cage heavily promoted the film by personally visiting critics, journalists and radio reporters. &quot;Birdy&quot; underperformed at the North American box office, grossing only $1,455,045 in the United States and Canada, against a budget of $12 million.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS in mid-June 1985 by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video, and on DVD on February 15, 2000, by Columbia TriStar Home Video. The DVD presents the film in optional fullscreen and anamorphic widescreen versions on both sides of the disc. Special features include the film&#x27;s theatrical trailer, as well as trailers for other films starring Cage and directed by Parker, information on the cast and crew, and a booklet featuring production notes.

&quot;Birdy&quot; was first released on the Blu-ray format in the United States on June 25, 2019. It was given a manufacture on demand release, with no extras other than the theatrical trailer. A region-free, limited edition version was released in the United Kingdom by Powerhouse Films on October 28, 2019. Parker oversaw the film&#x27;s 2K digital restoration. Special features include a 48-page booklet, the theatrical trailer, interviews with the cast and crew, an audio commentary by Parker and Justin Johnson of the British Film Institute, and Parker&#x27;s 1976 television film &quot;No Hard Feelings&quot;.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Birdy&quot; received mostly positive reviews from mainstream film critics. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 44 reviews, and gave the film a score of 84%, with an average score of 7.3 out of 10. The consensus summarizes: &quot;Aided by strong work from Matthew Modine and Nicolas Cage, &quot;Birdy&quot; finds director Alan Parker turning a supposedly unfilmable novel into a soaring -- and emotionally searing -- success.&quot; Roger Ebert, in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, awarded the film four stars out of four, writing, &quot;&quot;Birdy&quot; ... tells a story so unlikely ... and yet a story so interesting it is impossible to put this movie out of my mind.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Parker has for the most part directed the film deftly and unobtrusively. Every so often, though, he introduces the kind of overstatement &quot;Birdy&quot; didn&#x27;t need ... Fortunately, the heavy-handedness is in limited supply. Most of &quot;Birdy&quot; is enchanting.&quot; Film critic Emanuel Levy called it &quot;a powerfully dramatic chronicle of postwar trauma.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, felt that the film was &quot;far better as an antiwar film than as a poetic tribute to flight&quot;. Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised Modine and Cage&#x27;s performance, but described that the film as being &quot;morose and unrelieved&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Belying the lightheartedness of its title, &quot;Birdy&quot; is a heavy adult drama about best friends and the after-effects of war, but it takes too long to live up to its ambitious premise.&quot; Jack Zink of the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; wrote that the film &quot;takes a while to hook you into its story. This is one occasion we can afford the wait; Parker keeps us awake by repeatedly slapping us across the face visually.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Birdy&quot; received several awards and honors, with particular recognition for the film itself. The National Board of Review named it one of the Top Ten Films of 1984. Following its release, the film premiered at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival, and on May 20, 1985, it won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury prize. In 1987, the film received an Audience Award at the Warsaw International Film Festival.

<text>Eckhart Tolle ( ; ; born Ulrich Leonard Tölle, 16 February 1948) is a German-born spiritual teacher and self-help author. His books include &quot;The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment&quot; (1997), &quot;A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#x27;s Purpose&quot; (2005) and the picture book &quot;Guardians of Being&quot; (2009).

While working toward his doctorate at the University of Cambridge in 1977, Tolle abandoned his studies after a claimed spiritual awakening and later began working as a spiritual teacher. He came to prominence as a self-help author beginning in the 2000s, aided through promotion by Oprah Winfrey. His teachings draw from traditions such as Zen Buddhism, Christianity, Sufism, and Hinduism, although he remains unaffiliated with any religion.

==Early life==
Ulrich Leonard Tölle was born in Lünen, a small town north of Dortmund in the Ruhr region of Germany in 1948.

In 1961 he moved to Spain to live with his father, where he &quot;refused all forms of formal education between the ages of 13 and 22, preferring instead to pursue his own creative and philosophical interests&quot;. At 15, he was &quot;heavily influenced&quot; by a gift of the five spiritual books by the German mystic Joseph Anton Schneiderfranken.

==Career==
When he was 19, Tolle moved to England and taught German and Spanish for three years at a London language school. After attending the University of London, he enrolled in a postgraduate program at the University of Cambridge in 1977.

===Spiritual experience===
One night in 1977, at the age of 29, after having suffered from long periods of depression, Tolle says he experienced an &quot;inner transformation&quot;. That night he awakened from his sleep, suffering from feelings of depression that were &quot;almost unbearable,&quot; but then experienced a life-changing epiphany. Recounting the experience, he says, Tolle recalls going out for a walk in London the next morning, and finding that &quot;everything was miraculous, deeply peaceful. Even the traffic.&quot; The feeling continued, and he began to feel a strong underlying sense of peace in any situation. 

He stopped studying for his doctorate, and for a period of about two years after this he spent much of his time sitting, &quot;in a state of deep bliss,&quot; on park benches in Russell Square, Central London, &quot;watching the world go by.&quot; He stayed with friends, in a Buddhist monastery, or otherwise slept rough on Hampstead Heath. His family thought him &quot;irresponsible, even insane.&quot; He changed his first name from Ulrich to Eckhart; according to some reports this was in homage to the German philosopher and mystic, Meister Eckhart. A 2012 interview article states that he saw the name Eckhart on one of a pile of books in a dream, and knew he had written the book; soon after in real life he ran into a psychic friend who called him Eckhart out of nowhere, so he changed his name.

===Career as spiritual teacher===
Former Cambridge students and acquaintances began to ask Tolle about his beliefs. He started working as a counselor and spiritual teacher. Students continued to come to him over the next five years. He moved to Glastonbury, a center of alternative living. In 1995 he moved to Vancouver.

&quot;The Power of Now&quot;, Tolle&#x27;s first book, was published in 1997 by Namaste Publishing. The book was republished on a large scale by New World Library in 1999.

In 2000, Oprah Winfrey recommended &quot;The Power of Now&quot; in her magazine &quot;O&quot;. In August 2000, it reached &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller Advice, Miscellaneous and Hardcover list, reaching number one two years later. By 2008, the book had been translated from English into 33 languages. In July 2011, it had appeared on the list of the 10 best selling Paperback Advice &amp; Miscellaneous books for 102 weeks.

His second book, &quot;Stillness Speaks&quot;, appeared in 2003. That year, he stated that he had no intention of creating &quot;a heavy commercial structure&quot;, nor of setting up an ashram or centre. He believed one &quot;could develop organically&quot; and said &quot;one needs to be careful that the organization doesn&#x27;t become self-serving&quot;. Nevertheless, his website sells his books and &quot;a dizzying range&quot; of materials offering spiritual guidance, and a separate website streams video of monthly group meditations and sells photographs and fundraising courses.

In 2005, Tolle published &quot;A New Earth&quot;. In January, Oprah Winfrey selected it for her book club, and high sales followed. In the four weeks following the announcement, 3.5 million copies were shipped. It was ranked number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list 46 times by the end of 2008.

In 2008, Tolle partnered with Winfrey to produce a series of webinars, each one focusing on a chapter from his books, with discussions, silent meditations, and questions from viewers via Skype. The third webinar attracted more than 11 million viewers. By October 2009, the webinars had been accessed 35 million times.

In September 2009, he appeared with the Dalai Lama at the Vancouver Peace Summit. The same year, he published &quot;Guardians of Being&quot;, a picture book illustrated by Patrick McDonnell.

==Reception==

===Popularity===
In 2008 &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Tolle was &quot;the most popular spiritual author&quot; in the United States. By 2009, total sales of &quot;The Power of Now&quot; and &quot;A New Earth&quot; in North America were estimated at 3 million and 5 million copies respectively, and in 2011, the Watkins Review put him at number 1 in a list of &quot;The 100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People&quot;.

===By the press and others===

The books have received a wide range of praise and criticism from reviewers. In 2000, Carter Phipps wrote that &quot;Tolle&#x27;s clear writing and the obvious depth of his experience and insight set it apart&quot;. In 2003, Andrea Sachs characterized &quot;The Power of Now&quot; as &quot;awash in spiritual mumbo-jumbo&quot;, while in 2008, an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Tolle is &quot;not identified with any religion, but uses teachings from Zen Buddhism, Sufism, Hinduism, and the Bible&quot;.

Some have praised his re-working and synthesis of traditions. New Age writer William Bloom wrote that &quot;Tolle is offering a very contemporary synthesis of Eastern spiritual teaching, which is normally so clothed in arcane language that it is incomprehensible&quot;, thereby providing &quot;a valuable perspective on Western culture&quot;. Publisher Judith Kendra says, &quot;The ideas [that Tolle is] talking about have been in existence for thousands of years in both Eastern texts and with the great Western mystics, but he&#x27;s able to make them understandable&quot;.

Some critics have characterized his books as unoriginal or derivative. James Robinson in &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2008 called his writings &quot;a mix of pseudo-science, New Age philosophy, and teaching borrowed from established religions&quot;. A 2009 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that he is &quot;hardly the first writer to tap into the American longing for meaning and success&quot;. Sara Nelson, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, said Tolle&#x27;s writings had been successful due to surging public interest in self-help books.

===By Christian theologians===
In 2008, an article in &quot;The Independent&quot; noted that &quot;Tolle&#x27;s theories are certainly seen by many as profoundly non-Christian, even though Tolle often quotes from the Bible&quot;, but that &quot;Tolle does have fans in academic, even Christian, circles&quot;. It cited Andrew Ryder, a theologian at All Hallows College in Dublin, who wrote &quot;While he may not use the language of traditional Christian spirituality, Tolle is very much concerned that, as we make our way through the ordinary events of the day, we keep in touch with the deepest source of our being.&quot; Stafford Betty, scholar of religion at California State University, Bakersfield, finds common ground between Tolle&#x27;s worldview and that of Christian mystics. He notes that &quot;one of the key elements in Tolle&#x27;s teaching is that deep within the mind is absolute stillness in which one can experience &#x27;the joy of Being&#x27;&quot;. Roman Catholic priest and theologian Richard Rohr credits Tolle for helping to reintroduce ancient Christian mysticism to modern Christians: &quot;Tolle is, in fact, rather brilliantly bringing to our awareness the older tradition...both the ground and the process for breaking through to the theological contemplation of God, and acquired contemplation of Jesus, the Gospels, and all spiritual things.&quot;

Conversely, James Beverley, professor of Christian Thought and Ethics at the evangelical Tyndale Seminary in Toronto, says that Tolle&#x27;s worldview &quot;is at odds with central Christian convictions&quot; and that &quot;Tolle denies the core of Christianity by claiming there is no ultimate distinction between humans and God and Jesus&quot;. John Stackhouse, former professor of theology and culture at evangelical Regent College in Vancouver, says that Tolle &quot;gives a certain segment of the population exactly what they want: a sort of supreme religion that purports to draw from all sorts of lesser, that is, established religions&quot;. Stackhouse has described him as one of several spiritual teachers who &quot;purport to have investigated the world&#x27;s religions (quite a claim) and found them wanting, who routinely subject those religions to withering criticism, and who then champion their own views as superior to all these alternatives&quot;.

===In popular culture===
Tolle and his teachings take a central role in Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s 2022 album &quot;Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers&quot;. Throughout the album, Tolle is positioned as Lamar&#x27;s spiritual teacher, and Tolle narrates some tracks.

==Personal life==
In 1995, after visiting the West Coast of North America several times, Tolle settled in Vancouver, British Columbia. There he met his partner, Kim Eng.

<text>Enteric fever is a medical term encompassing two types of salmonellosis, which, specifically, are typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever. Enteric fever is a potentially life-threatening acute febrile systemic infection and is diagnosed by isolating a pathogen on culture. Typhoid fever is caused by the &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; bacteria, serotype typhi, while paratyphoid fever is caused by the &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; bacteria, serotype paratyphi A, B, or C. These &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; bacteria serovars that cause enteric fever only have human hosts, as opposed to other types of salmonellosis-causing &quot;Salmonella&quot; bacteria which often have animal reservoirs.

<text>The People&#x27;s Party was a political party in Utah Territory during the late 19th century. It was backed by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and its newspaper, the &quot;Deseret News&quot;. It opposed Utah&#x27;s Liberal Party, which was often explicitly anti-Mormon.

== Beginnings ==
The People&#x27;s Party emerged in 1870 in response to the non-&quot;Mormon&quot; Liberal Party. In fact, the initial slate of candidates for the 1870 Salt Lake City election was approved on February 9 by citizens who had swarmed into the first meeting of Liberals in order to hijack and disrupt it. Daniel H. Wells, the incumbent mayor, easily won the first contested Salt Lake election 2301 to 321.

Previously, political candidates ran without party affiliation, and Latter-day Saint candidates usually found themselves unopposed. With organized opposition to Latter-day Saint candidates, the Latter-day Saint leaders found having their own party expedient. Historian Ronald W. Walker states that the party&#x27;s name was selected to combat the notion that Brigham Young, himself not an elected official since 1857, was a tyrant. The People&#x27;s Party, as the name intentionally suggested, claimed to speak for the Latter-day Saints, vast majority of citizens, in Utah Territory.

== History of success ==
With only a handful of defeats, the party was supported by an overwhelming majority in most elections. Championing women&#x27;s suffrage, with the vote extended to women in the territory in 1870, helped the party emphasize its strength. Most non-Latter-day saints in the territory were men, often miners, and so the People&#x27;s Party gained a distinct advantage.

Throughout its history, People&#x27;s Party candidates never lost a statewide election. Local elections were lost to the Liberals under dubious circumstances, such as with the &quot;Tooele Republic,&quot; and after harsh anti-polygamy legislation disqualified many Latter-day Saint voters in the 1880s before the 1890 Manifesto halted further Latter-day Saint plural marriages.

== Dissolution ==

The party disbanded in June 1891 prior to elections for territorial legislature. Members joined the two national parties, with Latter-day Saint leaders striving to direct equal numbers toward each party. With Latter-day Saints Democrats and Republicans competing against Liberal candidates, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; characterized Liberals as a &quot;bastard party&quot;. One political ad asked rhetorically &quot;what is he who votes for a bastard ticket?&quot; Nonetheless, Liberals captured one third of seats in the territorial legislature.

Impetus for dissolving the party came from members of the national parties who believed the territory should follow national political lines before obtaining statehood. The Latter-day Saints Church could not favor either national party because the Latter-day Saints majority in the state would make the preferred party into a new &quot;de facto&quot; People&#x27;s Party. Two years later Liberals, also eager for statehood, followed suit, and Utah became the 45th state in the Union on January 4, 1896.

<text>A Kleagle is an officer of the Ku Klux Klan whose main role is to recruit new members and must maintain the three guiding principles: &quot;recruit, maintain control, and safeguard.&quot;

King Kleagles are appointed as leaders of a region and have authority to manage members and official affairs of that region&#x27;s members. In the 2000s the role was modified, empowering King Kleagles to maintain structural order and ensure the safety and security of members. It was deemed necessary to adapt the role to include the safekeeping of data and online communications within the Ku Klux Klan as the significance of the internet and digital communications became targeted and was known to be intercepted by other groups and government agencies.

King Kleagles are provided the highest level of authority to ensure compliance, security and accountability of members and provide orders and instructions for the Kleagles to carry out.

== Incentives and recruitment strategies ==
Kleagle members were typically paid by commission and received a portion of each new member&#x27;s initiation fee, similar to multilevel marketing schemes in later years.

KKK members were encouraged to recruit others by framing economic, political and social structural changes that were favorable and in-line with KKK goals. These goals promoted &quot;100 percent Americanism&quot; and benefits for white native-born Protestants. Informal ways Klansman recruited members included &quot;with eligible co-workers and personal friends and try to enlist them&quot;. Protestant teachers were also targeted for Klan membership.

=== Bloc recruitment ===
Particularly in the 1920s, the Klan used a technique referred to as bloc recruitment. This term was coined by sociologist Anthony Oberschall. Bloc recruitment refers to &quot;the way in which social-movement organizers often recruit members and participants among groups of individuals already organized for some other purpose.&quot; This strategy was advantageous to the Klan because it allowed them to recruit large groups of members from one source instead of being faced with the difficult task of recruiting individuals one by one. This strategy was also effective because it allowed the Klan to build upon the solidarity already in place from other organizations.

The KKK usually targeted fraternal lodges and Protestant church members for bloc recruitment. Protestant ministers were offered free membership and powerful Chaplain status within the KKK. Recruitment also involved recruitment drives that toured the United States. Members of organizations like churches and fraternal lodges, were easily accessible by Kleagles or Klan recruiters because they were already socially active in public issues through their involvement in these organizations. These recruitment efforts were very successful, so Klan membership soared. A primary recruitment leader during the 1920s, Edward Young Clark, reported that the Klan had gained 48,000 members in just three months. Klan leaders took advantage of this success and used membership fees to finance large purchases such as the Klan Krest, a new home for Imperial Wizard Simmons (founder of the 2nd KKK).

=== Violence ===
In addition to recruitment drives and alliances with fraternal lodges and Protestant churches, the Klan also used controlled instances of violence to attract members. Violence was pronounced in areas of high KKK activity, intimidating opponents of the KKK and impressing future members. Violence was a method to demonstrate commitment to the Klan philosophy; however, its use was monitored closely by Klan Leaders to discourage government intervention and to &quot;avoid a backlash from the general public that could damage recruiting efforts&quot;.

=== Charity work and recruitment ===
To offset violent acts, the KKK participated in charitable activities. In 1922, the Klan &quot;contributed $25 each to the Volunteers of America and to the African Methodist Episcopal Church, an offer which Webster said proved that the Klan was not anti-black&quot;. The charitable activities demonstrated that the KKK was committed to the welfare of the nation and also &quot;served as an effective public relations device by creating a more favorable opinion of the secret order and attracting new members&quot;.

=== Other recruitment factors ===
The allure of the &quot;invisible empire&quot; and its public anonymity were also appeals for potential Klansmen. In addition to the empowerment of membership in an empire that was secretive, Klansmen also enjoyed a kinship bond from membership. The activities and events of Klan members were impressive to future recruits as they included family picnics and other social events that built solidarity.

==Notable Kleagles==
* Edgar Ray Killen, a Mississippi Klansman long suspected of involvement in the 1964 murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner that were the subject of the movie &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; (1988). Killen was found guilty of manslaughter on June 21, 2005.
* Robert Byrd, Democrat, senior senator in the United States Senate from West Virginia. Byrd then moved on and disavowed any continuing connection with the Ku Klux Klan. As part of this disavowal, he confessed that it had been his decision to join the Ku Klux Klan that had started his career in politics.

== King Kleagles ==
The King Kleagle was the head of the Kleagles for a geographic area. There are appointed King Kleagles in each state in the US, Canada, Philippines, Germany, United Kingdom and Australia.

* George W. Apgar of the Ku Klux Klan in New Jersey
* Arthur H. Bell
* F. Eugene Farnsworth, Ku Klux Klan in Maine

<text>Sandston is a census-designated place (CDP) in Henrico County, Virginia, United States, just outside the state capital of Richmond. The population as of the 2010 Census was 7,571. It was designated a Historic District by Henrico County in 2021.

The Battle of Seven Pines took place nearby in 1862. It was second only to the Battle of Shiloh in its number of casualties up to that time. The battle was brutally fought and inconclusive, but had a profound impact on the trajectory of the war. After General Johnston&#x27;s injury, President Jefferson Davis appointed Robert E. Lee as Commander of the Confederate Armies. Lee then initiated the Seven Days Battles, which drove the Northern forces into a retreat in late June. This was the closest the North had come to Richmond, Virginia in this offensive.

During World War I, a number of homes were built in the area for both non-commissioned officers and enlisted men. After the war, an investment group headed by Oliver J. Sands bought the land and buildings as surplus property. The community was named Sandston after Oliver Sands, the president of the Richmond and Fairfield Railway, the electric street railway line which ran through Highland Springs and Fair Oaks to the National Cemetery at Seven Pines.

The community was later served by the Fairfield Transit Company, which operated a bus barn extant at Seven Pines in 2005 and the earlier trolley car barn in Richmond on North 29th Street. The road from Richmond, through Highland Springs, to Seven Pines was named &quot;Nine Mile Road&quot; because of the distance of the streetcar/trolley line.

Richmond International Airport is located in Sandston.

<doc id="1338507" wikidata="Q4690710" url="?curid=1338507" title="Afterdamp">
<text>Afterdamp is the toxic mixture of gases left in a mine following an explosion caused by methane-rich firedamp, which itself can initiate a much larger explosion of coal dust. The term is etymologically and practically related to other terms for underground mine gases—such as firedamp, white damp, and black damp, with afterdamp being composed, rather, primarily by carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen, with highly toxic stinkdamp-constituent hydrogen sulfide possibly also present. However, the high content of carbon monoxide is the component that kills, preferentially combining with haemoglobin in the blood and thus depriving victims of oxygen. Globally, afterdamp has caused many of the casualties in disasters of pit coalfields, including British, such as the Senghenydd colliery disaster. Such disasters continue to afflict working mines, for instance in mainland China.

==Etymology==
The meaning of &quot;damp&quot; in this term, while most commonly understood to imply humidity, presents evidence of having been separated from that newer, irrelevant meaning at least by the first decade of the 18th century, where the original relevant meaning of &quot;vapor&quot; derives from a Proto-Germanic origin, &quot;dampaz&quot;, which gave rise to its immediate English predecessor, the Middle Low German &quot;damp&quot; (with no record of an Old English intermediary). The proto-Germanic &quot;dampaz&quot; gave rise to many other cognates, including the Old High German &quot;damph&quot;, the Old Norse &quot;dampi&quot;, and the modern German &quot;Dampf&quot;, the last of which still translates as &quot;vapor&quot;.

==Detection==

Animal sentinels, such as mice or canaries, are more sensitive to carbon monoxide than humans, so will give a warning to miners. Canaries were introduced into British collieries in the 1890s by John Scott Haldane, the noted physiologist. Gas detectors are available now which detect toxic gases such as carbon monoxide at very low levels. They are widely available to protect domestic premises. The levels of gas detection depend on the methods used.

<text>Mauricie () is a traditional and current administrative region of Quebec. La Mauricie National Park is contained within the region, making tourism in Mauricie popular. The region has a land area of 35,860.05 km2 (13,845.64 sq mi) and a population of 266,112 residents as of the 2016 Census. Its largest cities are Trois-Rivières and Shawinigan.

The word &quot;Mauricie&quot; was coined by local priest and historian Albert Tessier and is based on the Saint-Maurice river which runs through the region on a North-South axis.

Mauricie administrative region was created on August 20, 1997 from the split of Mauricie–Bois-Francs administrative region into Mauricie and Centre-du-Québec. However, the concept of Mauricie as a traditional region long predates this.

<doc id="1338521" wikidata="Q1012502" url="?curid=1338521" title="Wick, Caithness">
<text>Wick ( ; ) is a town and royal burgh in Caithness, in the far north of Scotland. The town straddles the River Wick and extends along both sides of Wick Bay. &quot;Wick Locality&quot; had a population of 6,954 at the time of the 2011 census, a decrease of 3.8% from 2001.

Pulteneytown, which was developed on the south side of the river by the British Fisheries Society during the 19th century, was officially merged into the burgh in 1902.

Elzy was described as on the coast a couple of miles east of Wick in 1836.

The town is on the main road (the A99–A9 road) linking John o&#x27; Groats with southern Britain. The Far North railway line links Wick railway station with southern Scotland and with Thurso, the other burgh of Caithness. Wick Airport is on Wick&#x27;s northern outskirts and serves as a base for private helicopter flights to offshore wind and oil projects, as well as scheduled commercial flights to Aberdeen.

The main offices of &quot;The John O&#x27;Groat Journal&quot; and &quot;The Caithness Courier&quot; are located in Wick, as are Caithness General Hospital (run by NHS Highland), the Wick Carnegie Library and local offices of the Highland Council. Wick Sheriff Court is one of 16 sheriff courts serving the sheriffdom of Grampian, Highland and Islands.

==History==
===Pre-Christian Wick===
Iron Age activity in the parish of Wick is evident in the hill fort at Garrywhin. Evidence of activity around Wick from the Norse pagan period was discovered in 1837 when brooches and bracelets from the Norse were uncovered by archaeologists. The name &quot;Wick&quot; appears to be from a Norse word, &quot;vík&quot;, meaning &quot;bay&quot;, cf. also the word &quot;viking&quot;.

===Conversion to Christianity===
In the eighth century, Saint Fergus, an Irish missionary, lived in Wick or its immediate vicinity during his mission to the people in the area. He is the patron saint of Wick. One of the fairs in Wick, the Fergusmas, is named after this saint. It is believed that the Chapel of St. Tear in Wick Parish near Ackergill was founded in the eighth century by St Drostan, whose ministry was in Aberdeenshire.

===12th and 13th centuries===

Wick belonged to Norway, as did all of Caithness, until the reign of William the Lion (1165–1214), at which time the Norwegian earls held of the king of Scotland.

The Castle of Old Wick, commonly known as &quot;The Old Man of Wick&quot; (or &quot;Aul man o&#x27; Wick&quot;) is thought to have been built in about 1160 by Harald Maddadson, Earl of Caithness and Orkney. Earl Harald, who was half Norse, is thought to have resided there. It was long used by fishermen as an aid to navigation in the North Sea.

The &quot;Origines Parochiales Scotiae&quot; records these events for twelfth-century Wick: 
 Between the years 1142 and 1149 Rognvald Earl of Orkney went into Katanes and was there entertained at Vik by a husbandman named Sveinn the son of Hroald, a very brave man. When Sveinn Asleifson was in the Hebrides, he committed the keeping of Dungulsbae, which he had received from Earl Rognvald, to Margad Grimson, whose oppressions caused many to take refuge with Hroald in Wik. This occasioned a dispute between Hroald and Margad, and the latter soon afterwards went to Wik with nineteen men and slew Hroald. Between the years 1153 and 1156, Harald Maddadson, then joint Earl Katanes and Orkney with Earl Rognvald, passed into Katanes and wintered at Wik.

===14th and 15th centuries===
In about 1330, the parish of Wick was included among the Caithness lands owned by the family of Cheyne. The last male heir, Sir Reginald de Cheyne, died and was succeeded by his two daughters, who, by marriage, carried the lands into the clans Sinclair, Sutherland, and Keith.

Between 1390 and 1406, King Robert III granted the town of Wick in heritage to Neill Sutherland with a burgh of barony.

In 1438, the clans Gunn and Keith joined battle near Wick on the moor of Tannach with both sides suffering heavy losses. However, hostilities between the two clans were not ended at that time.

===16th century===
In 1503, the Parliament of Scotland established a sheriff for Caithness, who &quot;should sit and have a place for administration of his office within the town of Wick&quot;.

In 1538, Ackergill Tower, north of Wick, was granted to William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal and Lady Margaret Keith, his wife. Nine years later, George, Earl of Caithness, and others seized the tower house, taking hostage Alexander Keith, captain of the castle, and John Scarlet, his servitor, who were imprisoned in Girnigoe, Braal Castle, and other places. They were charged with treason but were granted remission by Queen Mary.

In 1583, when George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness, died at Edinburgh, his heart was brought to Wick where it was encased in lead and placed in Sinclair&#x27;s aisle at the church of Wick. However, it entered the story of Wick once again in 1588 when Wick suffered at the hands of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, in his campaign against the 5th Sinclair Earl of Caithness, who had killed his kinsman. While Sinclair and his men concealed themselves in Girnigoe Castle nearby, Sutherland proceeded to burn the town of Wick, &quot;an achievement of no great difficulty, as the place at that time merely consisted of a few mean straggling houses thatched with straw&quot;. All structures in the town except the church were burned. During the chaos of the fire, a Highlander intent on plundering the church broke open the lead case which contained the heart of the late Earl of Caithness, and, disappointed that no treasure was in the casque, flung the heart into the wind.

In 1589, James VI made the town into a royal burgh in favour of the fifth Earl of Caithness.

===17th century===
Wick did not escape the turbulence of the Reformation period when, in 1613, the Anglican archdeacon Richard Merchiston of Bower, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh, was brought into Caithness by Bishop Patrick Forbes. Merchiston, a zealous iconoclast, angered the Catholic townspeople when he broke up the stone sculpture of St. Fergus, the town&#x27;s patron saint. At first yielding to the city authorities who tried to prevent violence, a band of men nevertheless followed the parson as he returned home in the evening, took him by force, and drowned him in the Wick River. When questioned about the murder, they alleged that it had been the work of the saint himself, whom they claimed they had seen astride Merchiston, holding his head below the water.

In 1680, the last clan battle in Scotland took place west of Wick at Altimarlach, involving a dispute between Campbell of Glenorcy and the Sinclairs over the earldom of Caithness. The Sinclairs headquartered in Wick, where they became the victims of a cunning stratagem by an agent of Glenorchy, who ordered that a ship loaded with whisky, &quot;the nectar of Caithness&quot;, come to ground nearby, presuming the Sinclairs would imbibe the drink in quantity. He was not wrong. The next morning, weakened by their revels of the night before, the Sinclairs marched out to meet the Campbells and were ambushed at Altimarlach. Nearly all the Sinclairs were driven into the river and drowned.

===18th century===
In the eighteenth century, the people of Wick were Gaelic-speakers, but according to a presbytery report of 1707, they could understand English.

When Robert Forbes, appointed episcopal Bishop of Caithness in 1762, arrived in the county, he discovered there was no minister at Wick, but he is known to have held services and performed confirmations at the &quot;house of Mr. Campbell&quot; there.

In the year of his arrival, Bishop Forbes reported that every year on the morning of the Feast of Innocents Day (28 December), the people of Wick and its environs would gather for prayer at the ruins of the Chapel of St. Tear near Noss Head. In ruins at the time, the chapel had originally been made of stone and mortar without any lime, leaving little gaps in the wall into which people would press offerings of bread, cheese, and money. He left this description of the event:
 In the afternoon, they get music—a piper and fiddler—and dance on the green where the chapel stands. The roof is off, but the walls are almost entire. One of the late Presbyterian preachers of Wick thought to have abolished this old practice; and for that end appointed a Diet of catechising in that corner of the parish upon the day of the Holy Innocents, but not one attended him; all went, as usual, to St. Tear’s Chapel. I saw the font-stone for baptism lying on the green at the east end of the chapel. Mr. Sutherland, of Wester, observed that no doubt it has been called the Chapel of St. Tear from the tears of the parents and other relations of the murdered innocents.

The Rev. Charles Thomson, a nineteenth-century minister of the Free Church of Wick, stated in the &quot;New Statistical Account of Scotland&quot; that, though the bread and cheese were intended for the souls of the slain children, a dog-keeper in the neighbourhood would take the food out and feed it to the hounds.

===19th century===

In the late eighteenth century, the British Fishery Society had established fishing ports at Tobermory (1787) and Ullapool (1788), but when shoals of herring normally plentiful in the area moved away from the west coast, authorities turned toward Wick as a good prospect for the herring industry. Construction of Wick Harbour began in 1803 and was completed by 1811. It soon became a bustling harbour with ships from the Isles, the coast of Scotland, Wales, Shetland, and the Isle of Man. With the rise in fisheries, the size of the town increased, and Wick replaced Thurso as the centre of both shipping and trade in Caithness.

In 1800 a bridge was built at Wick, before which travellers from the south could only cross over into Wick via a footbridge of eleven pillars connected by planks. (Calder 32) In 1803 the Highland Roads Act allowed that the &quot;Parliamentary&quot; road which ran from Inverness to Thurso be extended from the Ord to Wick and then to Thurso, construction of which was completed in 1811. (C&amp;S 67) In 1818, the mail coach, which was already running between Inverness and Tain, extended its reach by passing Bonar Bridge and the Ord to Wick and Thurso, which offered better communication between Wick and the south of Scotland.

In 1806, Wick Baptist Church was founded, first meeting in a small loft in Kirk Lane, and later moving into a newly built Church in Union Street in 1865. Wick Town Hall was completed in 1828.

Pulteneytown was founded in 1808 to provide space for the many Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances, who poured to the coast in search of work in the fishing industry. By the 1840s it was reported there were over 1,000 herring boats in the harbour alongside a large curing industry which had been developed around the harbour.

The Roman Catholic Church of St Joachim was consecrated in 1836, being the first Catholic church in Caithness since the Reformation, initially serving seasonal Irish labourers working in the herring industry. It was built on land given to Walter Lovi in gratitude for his ministry to the community during an epidemic of cholera.

Two newspapers were established in Wick in the nineteenth century: the &quot;John o&#x27; Groat Journal&quot; in 1836 and the &quot;Northern Ensign&quot; in 1850, both of which are said to have espoused Liberal views in politics.

The brig &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot; was driven onto rocks at Elzy, described as a few miles east of Wick, in April 1836, on her way from Newcastle upon Tyne to Quebec in ballast under the command of Captain Green, during a severe easterly gale.

The population in 1841 was 1,333.

In 1868, Robert Louis Stevenson stayed in Wick while his uncle, Alan Stevenson, a lighthouse engineer, was overseeing the construction of the nearby Noss Head Lighthouse, which opened in 1869. Stevenson was later to write about Wick. (See below under Historic descriptions of Wick.)

===20th century===
Captain Ernest Edmund &quot;Ted&quot; Fresson, OBE, the founder of Highland Airways Limited, established the first air service at Wick, using a grass field north of town. On 8 May 1933 Fresson&#x27;s company began its first scheduled service between Inverness, Wick, and Kirkwall.

In 1939, the field was put under the authority of the Air Ministry and turned into an RAF base. The field was improved with hard runways, hangars, and other buildings, and became one of fourteen airfields ranging from Iceland to North Yorkshire administered by No. 18 Group, RAF Coastal Command, whose headquarters was at Pitreavie, Fife.

Pilots flying from Wick engaged in reconnaissance, anti-submarine patrols, convoy escort, defence of Scapa Flow, and strikes against the Germans in Norway and Norwegian waters. The plane most frequently used was the Lockheed Hudson.

In May 1940, Wick came under frequent air attack after the defeat of the Netherlands and Denmark and the occupation of Norway left Wick more vulnerable, and their defence of Scapa Flow and the harbour area made them a target. It is stated that 222 high explosives were dropped on Caithness, and that Wick proper was attacked six times. The first and most serious bombing was on 1 July 1940, when a bomb fell on Bank Row during daytime hours when children were playing outside, the first daytime bombing in the UK. Fifteen people were killed, eight of them children. Four shops and four houses were completely destroyed in Bank Row, and in Rose Street several houses were damaged.

==Historic descriptions of Wick==
In 1726, a writer described the town of Wick this way: 
The burgh of Wick, a small toun of little trade, lyes on the east end of the church and north side of the water, where it runs into the sea, and before it, is a bay formed more than a mile [1.5 km] in breadth between the Head of Wick on the north and the Head of Old Wick on the south with a harbour at the end of the toun to which ships of between 20 and 30 last burden can come in safely. There is a bridge at the toun of Wick for the convenience of the parish of eleven pillars built with loose stones and only timber laid over them. They are maintained by the south side of the parish for carrying them to the church, the water being broad there by the swelling of the tide.

In 1868, Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson stayed in Wick while his uncle, Alan Stevenson, a lighthouse engineer, was overseeing the construction of Noss Head Lighthouse, which opened in 1869. He wrote a letter to his mother describing the town:
 Wick lies at the end or elbow of an open triangular bay, hemmed on either side by shores, either cliff or steep earth-bank, of no great height. The grey houses of Pulteney extend along the southerly shore almost to the cape; and it is about half-way down this shore – no, six-sevenths way down – that the new breakwater extends athwart the bay.
Certainly Wick in itself possesses no beauty: bare, grey shores, grim grey houses, grim grey sea; not even the gleam of red tiles; not even the greenness of a tree. The southerly heights, when I came here, were black with people, fishers waiting on wind and night. Now all the S.Y.S. (Stornoway boats) have beaten out of the bay, and the Wick men stay indoors or wrangle on the quays with dissatisfied fish-curers, knee-high in brine, mud, and herring refuse. The day when the boats put out to go home to the Hebrides, the girl here told me there was &#x27;a black wind&#x27;; and on going out, I found the epithet as justifiable as it was picturesque. A cold, BLACK southerly wind, with occasional rising showers of rain; it was a fine sight to see the boats beat out a-teeth of it.

In Wick I have never heard any one greet his neighbour with the usual &#x27;Fine day&#x27; or &#x27;Good morning.&#x27; Both come shaking their heads, and both say, &#x27;Breezy, breezy!’ And such is the atrocious quality of the climate, that the remark is almost invariably justified by the fact.
The streets are full of the Highland fishers, lubberly, stupid, inconceivably lazy and heavy to move. You bruise against them, tumble over them, elbow them against the wall – all to no purpose; they will not budge; and you are forced to leave the pavement every step.
To the south, however, is as fine a piece of coast scenery as I ever saw. Great black chasms, huge black cliffs, rugged and over- hung gullies, natural arches, and deep green pools below them, almost too deep to let you see the gleam of sand among the darker weed: there are deep caves too. In one of these lives a tribe of gipsies. The men are ALWAYS drunk, simply and truthfully always. From morning to evening the great villainous-looking fellows are either sleeping off the last debauch, or hulking about the cove &#x27;in the horrors.&#x27; The cave is deep, high, and airy, and might be made comfortable enough. But they just live among heaped boulders, damp with continual droppings from above, with no more furniture than two or three tin pans, a truss of rotten straw, and a few ragged cloaks. In winter the surf bursts into the mouth and often forces them to abandon it.

==Geography==
===Wick River===
The town lies on the estuary of the Wick River, spanned by two road bridges. The Harbour Bridge spans the river at its mouth, to link Wick town centre with Wick Harbour and Pulteneytown. It stands instead of the earlier Service Bridge. Further upstream the Bridge of Wick carries the main road linking John o&#x27; Groats with Latheron and Inverness (the A99-A9).

=== Pulteneytown ===

Pulteney town is now an area of Wick on the south side of the River Wick. Until 1902 Pulteney town was administered separately from the Royal Burgh of Wick.

Pulteney town takes its name from Sir William Pulteney, a governor of the British Fisheries Society, who also commissioned Robert Adam to build the Pulteney Bridge in Bath. In the early years of the 19th century Sir William commissioned Britain&#x27;s leading civil engineer, Thomas Telford, to design and supervise the creation of a major new herring fishing town and harbour at the estuary of the River Wick.

Pulteneytown was so named after the death of Sir William in 1805 and became a major player in the 19th-century herring boom. It was built in order to supply work to the Gaels evicted during the Highland Clearances. During this boom period the harbour was expanded still further by local shipbuilder James Bremner. History of this era is preserved in the collections of Wick Heritage Museum.

As created by the British Fisheries Society, Pulteneytown consisted of Lower Pulteney and Upper Pulteney. Lower Pulteney was primarily a working area, built on a sandbank behind the harbour. Upper Pulteney was primarily a residential area, on higher ground.

Pulteneytown Parish Church (of the Church of Scotland) is located in Argyle Square and was opened in 1842. Additional hall accommodation has been added and the main church completely renovated to a very high standard for the needs of a twenty-first century congregation. Services are held twice every Sunday.

The Old Pulteney whisky distillery is in the Pulteneytown area. The first Caithness Glass factory was also in this area, but Caithness Glass has now left both the town and Caithness, and is based in Crieff.

===Wick Bay===
Wick Bay is an isosceles triangle with the river mouth as its apex, and the points of South Head and North Head, separated by about one kilometre, as the base of the triangle. Beyond the heads lies the North Sea. Pentland Firth line about 11 kilometres north of North Head.

There are three harbours in Wick, the Outer Harbour, the Inner Harbour, and the River Harbour, all of which are formed and protected by breakwaters. The Outer and Inner Harbours are on the south side of the estuary, divided from the River Harbour by a breakwater. The River Harbour straddles the river, with breakwaters on either side of an entrance about wide.

Wick Inner Harbour now has an extensive marina complex, and is fast becoming a base for leisure boating. It is also now a well known stopping point for visiting pleasure craft.

In 2012 a storm battered the harbour, causing extensive damage. In June 2016, another storm smashed a hole in the seawall.

====Map references====
Historical and current maps of Wick are available online.

===Climate===
Wick has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;), encompassing a narrow temperature range, low sunshine levels and high winds. Despite its far north location, close to the path of Atlantic depressions, rainfall averages below due to a rain shadow caused by mountains to the west.

==Governance==
Wick has history as a royal burgh dating from 1589.

In 1975, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, the local government burgh was merged into the Caithness district of the two-tier Highland region. The lowest tier of governance is filled by the Royal Burgh of Wick Community Council which was also formed at that time. 

In 1996, under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994, the district was abolished and the region became a unitary council area.

From 1996 until 2007, the town of Wick was covered by two or three wards, each electing one councillor by the first past the post system of election. This year, a single Wick ward was created to elect three councillors by the single transferable vote system. The new ward is one of three within the Highland Council&#x27;s Caithness ward management area and one of seven within the council&#x27;s Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross corporate management area.

From 2017 onwards, it was part of a new ward called Wick and East Caithness

Wick is within the former civil parish of Wick. The parish has that of Latheron to the south, those of Watten and Bower to the west, and that of Canisbay to the north. The eastern boundary of the parish is Moray Firth coastline.

===Parliamentary representation===
Wick was a parliamentary burgh, combined with Dingwall, Dornoch, Kirkwall and Tain in the Northern Burghs constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918. Cromarty was added to the list in 1832.

The constituency was a district of burghs known also as Tain Burghs until 1832, and then as Wick Burghs. It was represented by one Member of Parliament (MP). In 1918 the constituency was abolished and the Wick component was merged into the then new county constituency of Caithness and Sutherland.

==Economy==
=== Caithness Glass ===

A specialist glass manufacturer was established in Wick in 1961. Production was progressively moved to Perth between 1979 and 2004. Manufacturing in Wick thus ceased and the physical connection with Caithness was severed. Caithness Glass manufactured the trophy for the BBC &quot;Mastermind&quot; television quiz programme.

=== Old Pulteney Distillery ===
The Old Pulteney Distillery is an aging malt whisky production facility in Pulteneytown. The distillery has a visitor centre in Huddart Street, and produces the Old Pulteney Single Malt whisky at a number of ages. Its 21-year-old single malt was named World Whisky of the Year by leading expert Jim Murray in his 2012 Whisky Bible.

Like Pulteneytown the distillery is named after Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet. The distillery was established in 1826 when Pulteneytown was quite newly established as a herring fishing port. The distillery is the most northerly on the Scottish mainland and was quite inaccessible, when established, except by sea. Barley was brought in by sea, and the whisky was shipped out the same way. At that time many of the distillery workers were also fishermen. &quot;Old Pulteney&quot; is promoted as a &quot;Highland single malt Scotch&quot;.

The distillery is now owned by Inver House Distillers Limited, a subsidiary of Thai Beverages. Other Inver House distilleries include the Speyburn-Glenlivet Distillery, Knockdhu Distillery, Balblair Distillery and Balmenach Distillery.

===Ignis Wick Ltd===
Ignis Wick Ltd operates the district heating scheme in Wick, and provides heat and hot water via underground insulated pipes to nearly 200 homes from a central boiler house. Formerly known as Caithness Heat and Power Limited (CHaP) it was owned by the Highland Council. Operations are based at the Old Pulteney distillery in Wick.

The council initiated the scheme, with origins evident in minutes of 16 December 2002 meeting of the council&#x27;s Caithness committee. It was planned, originally, as a biomass-fuelled combined heat and power scheme, producing mains grid electricity as well as heat. The CHaP company was formed on 7 July 2005, as a non-profit company with three directors, representing the council, the Pulteneytown People&#x27;s Project charity, and the distillery owners.

The biomass gasification plant failed to work as intended, however, and what had been planned as temporary use of fossil-oil plant became a longer term arrangement. CHaP incurred significant financial losses of more than £13 million. Therefore, in 2008, the council had no real option except to take full, direct control of the company and, by February 2009, the council had to accept that the original biomass plant did not work economically.

Ignis Biomass Ltd took over the district heating scheme in 2012, and has installed a renewable energy biomass plant to replace the fossil-oil plant. As of 2013, the scheme supplies heat to the distillery and to nearly 200 homes, and Ignis plans to extend the heat supply to more homes.

===Other businesses===
Wick is the home of the Shore Scottish Seaweed Company which makes seaweed crisps. In July 2024 the company announced a major expansion

==Landmarks==
===Castle of Old Wick===
The Castle of Old Wick () was built in the 12th century when the Norwegian Earldom of Orkney included Caithness, and was united under Harald Maddadsson. The castle is thought to have been his stronghold on the mainland of Britain. There is evidence that the site was occupied before the present castle was built.

All that remains today is a tall tower sitting on the very edge of the cliffs, about south of Wick Bay and of the modern town of Wick, but originally the castle had at least 4 stories as well as extra buildings containing workshops and other quarters.

During the 14th century it was owned by Sir Reginald de Cheyne who was a supporter of Edward I during his attempt to establish John Balliol as King of Scotland, although there is no evidence of a battle having taken place there. In July 1569 Lord Oliphant and his servants were attacked by the Master of Caithness, and besieged for 8 days in Old Wick or &quot;Auldwick&quot; castle. It was abandoned in the 18th century.

The castle was built to the same plan as Brough Castle, which is about 29 kilometres to the north/northwest, on the Pentland Firth coast of Caithness.

===Heritage Museum===
Wick Heritage Museum is in Bank Row, Pulteneytown. The museum is run by the Wick Society, with a strong focus on the herring-boom era of Wick&#x27;s history. The herring trade relied on the export of cured herring to the Continent (in particular, Stettin and St Petersburg) and languished after the First World War. The Johnston Collection, which was gathered by the local photographer&#x27;s business between 1863 and 1975 provides a fascinating insight into the history of the town and the industry. The surviving collection contains around 50,000 images.

===Carnegie Library===

The Wick Carnegie Library is now run by the Highland Council. As well as providing a general library service the library preserves valuable books and other documents about Wick and Caithness and their histories. Also it preserves a crocodile (&quot;Gavialis gangeticus&quot;) presented by Sir Arthur Bignold in 1909.

The library building also houses the North Highland Archive and the St. Fergus Gallery exhibitions. The North Highland Archive is part of the Highland Council Archive Service, and holds collections of official and private papers, the earliest dating from 1589, relating to Wick and the county of Caithness.
Construction of the library building, 1897, was part funded by Andrew Carnegie. It is at the junction of Sinclair Terrace and Cliff Road.

The Caithness county archives were transferred from Wick library to Nucleus, the Nuclear and Caithness Archives near Wick Airport in February 2017.
The Library is now a Food Bank.

===HMS &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; memorial===
A memorial was erected in 2006 in honour of nine local merchant seafarers who died in that ship&#x27;s heroic 1940 naval battle with the German heavy cruiser .

===Tourist Information Centre===
The Tourist Information Centre is now located upstairs in the Mcallan&#x27;s store on High Street.

===World&#x27;s shortest street===
In 2006 the BBC reported that the Guinness Book of Records had confirmed the world&#x27;s shortest street, Ebenezer Place measuring 2.06 metres, and containing just one door, was located in Wick (). It had not previously qualified for the record because it did not have a full postal address.

==Education==
There are two primary schools in Wick, both run by the Highland Council. They are Noss Primary School and Newton Park Primary School. There is one secondary school in Wick, Wick High School. There were previously four primary schools in Wick, these being North Primary, Hillhead Primary (both merged to make Noss Primary), South Primary and Pultneytown Academy (both merged to make Newton Park Primary).

==Media==
Television signals are received from either the Rumster Forest or Keelylang Hill TV transmitters. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Scotland on 94.5 FM, BBC Radio Nan Gaidheal (for Gaelic listeners), MFR Radio on 96.7 FM, and Caithness FM, a community based radio station that broadcast on 106.5 FM. 

The town is served by the local newspapers, John O&#x27;Groat Journal and Caithness Courier.

==On film==
There is surviving black and white, and colour, film footage of Wick and the Highlands in the National Library of Scotland. The 1967 children&#x27;s film &quot;The Hunch&quot;, set in Wick, can be watched online for free.

==Twin towns==
For twenty years the town was twinned with Klaksvík, Faroe Islands. In August 2015, Wick councillors threatened to break these ties on account of a Faroese long standing practice which involves hunting and eating migrating pilot whales. As of January 2016 the decision has been deferred.

<text>All In () is a 2003 South Korean television drama series that aired on SBS TV from 15 January to 3 April 2003, on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 (KST) for 24 episodes. Inspired by the life of professional poker player Jimmy Cha, it starred Lee Byung-hun and Song Hye-kyo in a story about one&#x27;s man&#x27;s rise through the fiercely competitive world of casino gambling as he clashes with his rivals over money, success, and love.

The drama was a ratings success in South Korea, with its final episode reaching a peak viewership rating of 47.7%, the 10th highest rated episode of any Korean series aired between 2000 and 2008. It also won several awards, notably the Grand Prize (&quot;Daesang&quot;) for Lee Byung-hun at the 2003 SBS Drama Awards.

==Synopsis==
Orphaned then taken in by his gambler uncle, Kim In-ha (Jin Goo) often hangs out with his friends in the basement of a movie theater. He unexpectedly befriends Choi Jung-won, a model student and the rich son of the theater owner. In-ha and Jung-won both fall for Min Su-yeon (Han Ji-min), the daughter of the projectionist at the theater.

When Su-yeon&#x27;s father was killed by loan sharks, In-ha and Jung-won hatch a plan to avenge Su-yeon by setting fire to a gangster&#x27;s hideout. But the fire spreads, accidentally killing the gang leader. In-ha is sentenced to seven years, while thanks to his family connections, Jung-won avoids jail time. As In-ha serves his sentence, Jung-won goes to the United States to study and Su-yeon decides to become a nun.

Seven years pass, and by pure chance, the three all end up working at the same casino. In-ha (Lee Byung-hun) and Su-yeon (Song Hye-kyo) fall in love, but are later separated when In-ha is forced to illegally immigrate to the U.S. He finds a job as a mafia hitman, and by a stroke of luck, again meets Su-yeon, and the two plan to get married. However, on their supposed wedding day, In-ha suffers a near-fatal gunshot wound and becomes comatose for 8 months. Unaware that In-ha is alive, the grieving Su-yeon returns to Korea.

In-ha eventually recovers, but Jung-won (Ji Sung) intervenes, saying that he is unworthy to love Su-yeon. In-ha decides to turn his life of misery around and becomes a professional gambler. He meets a business partner and, betting everything he has, returns to Korea to win back Su-yeon&#x27;s love.

== Production ==

=== Development and casting ===
&quot;All In&quot; was adapted from the novel of the same name by Noh Seung-il, inspired by the life of poker player Jimmy Cha. The title &quot;All In&quot; comes from a term in poker that refers to betting one&#x27;s entire stake. Though the plot was adapted from the novel, the characters were wholly original to the drama.

In 2000, SBS drama production team director Lee Jong-su first approached Jimmy Cha, whom the original novel was based on, to adapt the novel for a TV series, but Cha rejected the offer due to Korea&#x27;s negative attitude towards gambling. Lee later approached Cha twice, requesting to make a series about Cha&#x27;s mother. Cha turned the offer down both times, but the project was already at the casting stage. A meeting was held, and screenwriter Choi Wan-gyu suggested changing the concept to focus more on Jimmy Cha&#x27;s life as a whole.

Lee Byung-hun had already been cast as the main role, but his female counterpart had not been decided on; actors considered for the role included Lee Young-ae, Song Yoon-ah, Kim Hee-sun, and Shin Eun-kyung. The producers then suggested Song Hye-kyo to Jimmy Cha, and Cha gave SBS the OK to cast her. Additionally, Joo Sang-wook was supposed to play the young version of Lee Byung-hun&#x27;s character, but he was replaced by Jin Goo last minute.

=== Filming ===
Filming began on 9 September 2002 and took place in several locations. An outdoor set was built in Jeju Island, for which the island provided 200 million Korean won. Most scenes filmed in Jeju were shot on the Seopjikoji coast, located in the city Seogwipo. From 28 November to 31 December 2002, location filming took place in the United States, with the casino scenes being filmed in Las Vegas. The kiss scene between Song Hye-kyo and Lee Byung-hun was filmed over two days, moving from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Production costs reached 250 million won per episode to a total budget of over 5 billion won, at that time the highest for a Korean miniseries.

During the drama&#x27;s filming, SBS promised they would stop broadcasting smoking scenes in their TV dramas. &quot;All In&quot;, which started production before the announcement, had scenes where characters smoked – as many of the scenes as possible were removed in editing, and during the scenes that couldn&#x27;t be cut, subtitles were displayed during broadcast asking for understanding.

=== Changes in writing ===
Initially, Ji Sung&#x27;s character Jung-won was planned to die in the story, but as the show&#x27;s scale increased, its plot became uncertain. Actors approached screenwriter Choi Wan-gyu mid-production to explain why their character had to die. Choi said to &quot;Maeil Business Newspaper&quot;, &quot;All of [the actors] are very good at analyzing the drama, and their advice is very helpful. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m more worried about how to end it.&quot; In the end, Choi decided that none of the main characters would die, stating that death was unnecessary for an emotional story.

Additionally, Song Hye-kyo&#x27;s character Su-yeon was meant to marry Jung-won, thinking Lee Byung-hun&#x27;s character In-ha had died. Viewers expressed dissatisfaction with the storyline online, and it was later dropped to create tension within the narrative.

== Music ==

The soundtrack album for &quot;All In&quot; was officially released in January 2003. Produced by Kim Hyeong-seok, the soundtrack sold 53,892 copies in February and was the 18th best-selling Korean album of 2003. &quot;Like the First Day&quot;, the drama&#x27;s theme song, became a popular ringtone, racking up over 900,000 downloads on caller ring services by March. The identity of its singer, formally named Who, drew curiosity as he had not made any public appearances; it was later revealed that actor Park Yong-ha was behind the song.
== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
Though &quot;All In&quot; was a ratings and marketing success, it was also subject to criticisms that it glorified gambling. Journalist Jeon Yeo-ok wrote that while the drama was &quot;worth seeing&quot;, its provocative subject matter and excessive violence was not fit for public TV. This concern was echoed by a writer for the South Korean newspaper &quot;Kukmin Ilbo&quot;, who criticized the series as showing a romanticized portrayal of gambling and asserted that it had &quot;everything that shouldn&#x27;t be seen on TV&quot;.

=== Viewership ===
&quot;All In&quot; achieved a 21.7% rating in its first week of broadcast, and by its 3rd episode, ratings exceeded to over 30%. By its final episode, it had held the top spot in weekly TV ratings for 7 weeks. With an average rating of 39.6%, it was the highest rated Korean program in March 2003, and was the second highest rated Korean TV program in 2003. Its top rating of 47.7% gave it the 10th highest peak of any series aired between 2000 and 2008, and it was the 4th highest rated SBS drama as of 2012. &quot;All In&quot; also set records for video-on-demand, breaking &quot;Successful Story of a Bright Girl&quot; record of 700,000 downloads with over 1.1 million VOD views.

=== Commercial impact ===
Various spots in Jeju, where most of &quot;All In&quot; was filmed, became highly-visited tourist attractions upon the show&#x27;s airing. Over 6,000 visitors came to Seopjikoji during the &quot;samiljeol&quot; holiday of 2003, and in April that year the series&#x27; cast members and staff became PR ambassadors for Jeju Island. Lotte Hotel Jeju, where many of the drama&#x27;s scenes were filmed, also began selling an &quot;All In Package&quot; where tourists could &quot;experience the vivid emotions of the drama&quot;. It was reported in 2006 that the drama had earned Jeju 176.4 billion won due to its &quot;advertising effect&quot;. Products featured in the series, such as music boxes with which the main characters express their love, were sold to commercial success, reportedly selling 1,000 copies per day. Forms of gambling also saw an increase after the drama&#x27;s broadcast; poker games on sites such as Hangame and Hanafos saw an increase in players, and customer traffic to the casino Kangwon Land was said to have increased by 10% since the drama&#x27;s airing.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;All In&quot; won the television grand prize at the 39th Baeksang Arts Awards, as well as a Best Actor award for Lee Byung-hun. It was also named the best drama at the 30th Korea Broadcasting Awards, and was one of the Best Picture winners at the 16th Grimae Awards. At the 2003 SBS Drama Awards, Lee Byung-hun won the Grand Prize for his performance in the series. Song Hye-kyo, Ji Sung, and Heo Joon-ho won the Best Actress, Best Actor in a Drama Special, and Best Supporting award respectively, and Lee Byung-hun and Song Hye-kyo also received the Top 10 Stars award at the ceremony.

==Regional broadcast==
In April 2003, SBS signed a contract with the Taiwanese cable channel Gala Television to broadcast &quot;All In&quot; in Taiwan. Although the export price was not disclosed, it was said to be the highest for a Korean drama until then. At the time, the record export price had stood at over 400 million won for the Japanese export of &quot;Winter Sonata&quot;.

In Japan, it first aired on the cable channel KNTV from 8 March to 25 May 2003. Japanese satellite channel NHK BS2 broadcast &quot;All In&quot; under the title once a week from 1 April 2004, and re-airings followed once a week on terrestrial TV starting 16 April 2005. According to a poll conducted by the TV Asahi variety show &quot;SMAP Station&quot; in May 2007, &quot;All In&quot; ranked as the seventh most popular Korean drama in Japan. It was also broadcast in countries like Macedonia and Turkey on the channel Arirang TV, gaining enough popularity in Macedonia to be rebroadcast.

<doc id="1338528" wikidata="Q875134" url="?curid=1338528" title="European Russia">
<text>European Russia is the western and most populated part of the Russian Federation. It is geographically situated in Europe, as opposed to the country&#x27;s sparsely populated and vastly larger eastern part, Siberia, which is situated in Asia, encompassing the entire northern region of the continent. The two parts of Russia are divided by the Ural Mountains and Ural river, bisecting the Eurasian supercontinent. European Russia covers the vast majority of Eastern Europe, and spans roughly 40% of Europe&#x27;s total landmass, with over 15% of its total population, making Russia the largest and most populous country in Europe. The region is divided into five Federal districts.

== Area and demographics ==
European Russia accounts for about 80% of Russia&#x27;s total population. It covers an area of over , with a population of nearly 110 million—making Russia the largest and most populous country in Europe, surpassing second-place Germany. European Russia is the most densely populated region of Russia, with a population density of 27.5 people per km2 (70 per sq mi). European Russia counts for about 15% of Europe&#x27;s total population.

All three federal cities of Russia lie within European Russia. These cities are Moscow, the nation&#x27;s capital and largest city, which is the second most populous city in Europe; Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital and the second-most populous city in the country; and Sevastopol, located in Crimea, which is internationally recognized as part of Ukraine.

Of the 16 Russian cities with over 1 million inhabitants, 12 lie within European Russia: Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Ufa, Chelyabinsk, Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar, Voronezh, Perm and Volgograd (the remaining four are Yekaterinburg, Omsk, Krasnoyarsk and Novosibirsk).

==History==

The historical population of European Russia was composed of Slavic, Finno-Ugric, Germanic, Turkic, Jewish, Scythian, North Caucasian, Hunnic and Baltic peoples.
Some theories say that some early Eastern Slavs arrived in modern-day western Russia (also in Ukraine and Belarus) sometime during the middle of the first millennium AD. The Eastern Slavic tribe of the Vyatichis was native to the land around the Oka river. Finno-Ugric, Baltic and Turkic tribes were also present in the area (although large parts of the Turkic and Finno-Ugric people were absorbed by the Slavs, there are great minorities in European Russia today). The western region of Central Russia was inhabited by the Eastern Slavic tribe of the Severians.

One of the first Rus&#x27; regions according to the Sofia First Chronicle was Veliky Novgorod in 859. In late 8th and early-to-mid-9th centuries AD the Rus&#x27; Khaganate was formed in modern western Russia. The region was a place of operations for Varangians, eastern Scandinavian adventurers, merchants, and pirates. From the late 9th to the mid-13th century a large section of today&#x27;s European Russia was part of Kievan Rus&#x27;. The lands of Rus&#x27; Khaganate and Kievan Rus&#x27; were important trade routes and connected Scandinavia, Byzantine Empire, Rus&#x27; people and Volga Bulgaria with Khazaria and Persia. According to old Scandinavian sources among the 12 biggest cities of Kievan Rus&#x27; or Ancient Rus&#x27; were Novgorod, Kiev, Polotsk, Smolensk, Murom and Rostov.

Through trade and cultural contact with Byzantine Empire, the Slavic culture of the Rus&#x27; adopted gradually the Eastern Orthodox religion. Many sources say that Ryazan, Kolomna, Moscow, Vladimir and Kiev were destroyed by the Mongol Empire. After the Mongol invasion the Muscovite Rus&#x27; arose, over all this time, western Russia and the various Rus&#x27; regions had strong cultural contacts with the Byzantine Empire, while the Slavic culture was cultivated all the time. The elements of East Slavic paganism and Christianity overlapped each other and sometimes produced even double faith in Muscovite Rus&#x27;.

==Economy==
In 2022 the GRDP of European Russia was around ₽100 trillion (US$1.4 trillion).

==Alignment with administrative divisions==

<text>Sandal Castle is a ruined medieval castle in Sandal Magna, a suburb of the city of Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England, overlooking the River Calder. It was the site of royal intrigue and the setting for a scene in one of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

==History==
===The Warennes===
William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (1081–1138) was granted the Sandal estates in 1107. The 2nd earl built the first Sandal Castle of timber. He supported Robert Curthose against Henry I of England and was banished from the kingdom for two years. Later he was given the Wakefield manor. William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey (1119–1148) spent little time at Sandal, having taken crusading vows and joined the Second Crusade. He had one daughter, Isabel de Warenne (1137–1199), who married William of Blois, son of King Stephen, who became the 4th earl. He died in 1159, leaving no children. Isabel, his widow, next married Hamelin (1129–1202), the 5th earl. He was the son of Geoffrey of Anjou and assumed the Warrene name on his marriage in 1164. Hamelin is thought to have built the early Norman stone fortifications at Conisbrough Castle and also begun to replace the wooden fortifications at Sandal with stone.

William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey (1166–1240) married Maud Marshal in 1225. He was loyal to his cousin, King John and is one of the four nobles whose name appears in the Magna Carta for John. On King John&#x27;s death in 1216 he supported Henry III. Maud de Warenne, William&#x27;s widow, held the Wakefield Manor from 1240 until their son John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey (1231–1304) came of age in 1252. John married Alice de Lusignan in 1247. In 1296 the 6th Earl was appointed warden for Scotland by Edward I and in 1299, the Earl and his royal master were triumphant over the Scots at the Battle of Falkirk.

William de Warrene (1256–1286) was killed at a tournament in Croydon pre-deceasing his father. His son John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey (1286–1347) was born in the year of his death. John married Joan of Bar but lived adulterously with Maud de Nereford from a village near Castle Acre in Norfolk. In 1347, the 7th Earl died. His sons John and Thomas became Knights Hospitaller in the Holy Land, predeceasing their mother. The lands passed to Edward III.

The Warennes had castles at Lewes in Sussex and Reigate in Surrey, Castle Acre Castle in Norfolk and Conisbrough in Yorkshire.

===The Dukes of York===
In 1347, Edward III granted Sandal to his fifth son Edmund of Langley who was six years old at the time. His elder brother John of Gaunt held Pontefract and Knaresborough Castles, Edmund was granted Wark Castle near Coldstream in the Scottish Borders, and in 1377 Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire which was to become his home, and for the next 75 years the family seems to have spent little time at Sandal, leaving it to the management of constables or stewards.

In 1385 Edmund was made Duke of York as a reward for his support for his nephew, Richard II of England. He was succeeded by his son, also Edward who campaigned in Ireland and died at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Edward was succeeded by his nephew, Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York.

===The Battle of Wakefield===
Early in 1460, during the Wars of the Roses, Richard Plantagenet made a bid for the throne. He was initially not well-received, but an Act of Accord made in October 1460 recognised him as heir to the throne and named him Protector of the Realm. In December Richard went to Sandal Castle, either to consolidate his position or to counter Lancastrian dissent. He had an army of 3,000–8,000 men but on 30 December in the Battle of Wakefield, he was outnumbered and outmaneuvered by Queen Margaret&#x27;s army, coming from nearby Pontefract. Richard suffered a crushing defeat and both he and his younger son Edmund, Earl of Rutland were killed (although only two months later Richard&#x27;s eldest son Edward became king).

===Richard III===
The castle&#x27;s last brush with royalty came in 1483 when Richard&#x27;s eighth son (and twelfth child) Richard III chose it as a northern base and ordered significant investments. This hope was short lived however as Richard was killed in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. After this the castle was maintained a little, but gradually declined, with the building of Wakefield Prison in the 1590s leaving it even less useful.

===The English Civil War===
During the English Civil War Sandal Castle was Royalist, although its neglected state left it out of the major conflicts. In 1645 however it was besieged at least three times by Parliamentarian troops. Butler recounts: Having been assured that they would receive a safe passage to Welbeck House in north Nottinghamshire they surrendered the castle at 10 o&#x27;clock on 1 October 1645. The garrison was then 10 officers and 90 men with two of the men called &quot;seniors&quot; implying that they were professional soldiers rather than just non-commissioned officers. They also surrendered 100 muskets, 50 pikes, 20 halberds, 150 swords and two barrels of gunpowder: no pieces of artillery are mentioned.

As a result of this capitulation, only Bolton Castle in Wensleydale and Skipton Castle remained in Royalist hands in Yorkshire, but Sandal &quot;was the most resolute of all the three northern garrisons&quot; and its fall caused great rejoicing among the parliamentarian forces. By the siege&#x27;s end, it was a ruin. The following year, Parliament ordered that it be made untenable.

==The castle==

The castles built by William the Conqueror&#x27;s followers were self-sufficient strongholds, some of which were tax-gathering points, some controlled the larger towns, river crossings or passes through hills. Two castles were built near Wakefield, one at Lowe Hill on the north bank of the Calder and Sandal on the south bank. The first castles were probably started and completed in the early 12th century by William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey after he had been granted the manor of Wakefield by Henry I.

Sandal and Lowe Hill were motte-and-bailey earthwork castles with wooden towers on the mound and baileys with timber palisades and deep ditches. Sandal is built on a natural sandstone ridge, the Oaks Rock. The motte was raised to with the deep moat surrounding it. Only Sandal survived and during the 13th century the keep, curtain wall and other buildings were rebuilt in stone, probably started by either the sixth or seventh Earls Warenne. Timber motte and bailey castles were often converted into stone if they were in use for long periods; Sandal is a particularly good example of this.

The stone keep was circular with four towers each four storeys high; two of them close together formed a gatehouse, and the east tower contained a well, deep. The double-walled keep would have had guardrooms, storerooms and servants&#x27; quarters on the ground floor, the main hall above and private apartments on the second floor. The tower rooms had garderobes, (lavatories) that discharged on the outer walls of the keep. The curtain wall was high with a wall walk along its length, it enclosed the bailey and crossed the moat twice to reach the keep.

The barbican at Sandal was inside the bailey; it was a three-storey tower with a moat opposite two drum towers at the entrance to the keep, all of which were constructed in the early 1270s. The barbican with its own gate and portcullis added an extra line of defence between the main entrance gate and the keep. Attackers entering the barbican had to make a right-angled turn to enter the keep, which was protected by a drawbridge between the drum towers. A stairway from the barbican led to a sally port.

The bailey lay to the south-east of the keep with the main gatehouse on the north-east side. It was crescent shaped, about long and wide. Inside the bailey there was a deep well and two privy shafts, one of which is deep.

==The ruins==
The ruins were a source of stone for local building and became a place for locals to relax. They were depicted in the foreground of a drawing of Wakefield from the south by Samuel Buck in 1719 or 1722, and in 1753 an engraving was published of an Elizabethan survey drawing.

The ruins were first excavated by the Yorkshire Archaeological Society in 1893. A more detailed project began in the summer of 1964 and was a partnership between Wakefield Corporation, Wakefield Historical Society and the University of Leeds. This project started as an experiment in adult education, but with the help of over a hundred local volunteers it grew into a complete and rigorous excavation that continued for nine years. Whilst excavating the bailey, archaeologists found remains of flint tools suggesting a Mesolithic encampment was there in about 5,000 BC.

In 2003, a wooden walkway was provided to allow access to the summit of the motte without causing erosion. A visitor centre was constructed about from the castle. There have been historical re-enactments and &quot;living history&quot; days, including commemoration of the Battle of Wakefield and the deaths of Richard Duke of York and his son Edmund. In February 2015 Wakefield Council announced that due to budget constraints they were considering plans to either close the visitor centre or reduce its opening hours.

The castle is a Scheduled Monument, which means it is a &quot;nationally important&quot; historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change. It is also a Grade II* listed building.

==Literary and folk references==
Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; (Act 1, Scene 2) is set in Sandal Castle. It describes Richard&#x27;s sons urging him to take the crown before news is brought of Margaret&#x27;s approach. Act 1, scene 4 then depicts the death of Richard at the Queen&#x27;s hands. This brief fictionalised account bears little resemblance to the history as we understand it today. The play is sometimes performed on the castle ruins.

Local folklore holds that the nursery rhyme &quot;Grand Old Duke of York&quot; was written about the castle, with the titular Duke referring to Richard III. The song is said to refer to either the frequent movement of soldiers to and from the castle, where the Duke had his treasury, or to the movement of soldiers just prior to the Battle of Wakefield.

==Castle occupants==
Among the notable individuals who lived in the castle were William de Warrene, the Second Earl of Surrey; Elizabeth of Vermandois; William de Warrene, the Third Earl of Surrey, who was also a Knight Crusader; Isabel de Warrene, the Fourth Countess of Surrey; Hamelin Plantagenet (also known as Hamelin de Warrene), the Fifth Earl of Surrey; John de Warrene, the Seventh Earl of Surrey; Joan of Bar; Edmund of Langley, the First Duke of York; Edward of Norwich, the Second Duke of York; and Richard of York, the Third Duke of York.

<text>Delray Beach station is a train station in Delray Beach, Florida, that is served by Tri-Rail and Amtrak. It is located on South Congress Avenue (SR 807), south of West Atlantic Avenue (SR 806) and east of State Road 9. The station has two side platforms, with parking and a bus loop to the west of the southbound platform.

The station opened in 1991 after legal squabbles and poor access led Tri-Rail to abandon the former Seaboard Air Line Railway depot located a few blocks north. Amtrak, which had also been using the old Seaboard depot, moved to the station in 1995. Its &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Floridian&quot; stop at the station, which was remodeled between 2004 and 2006 to accommodate a second track. On November 10, 2024, the &quot;Silver Star&quot;, which had served the station since 1995, was merged with the as the &quot;Floridian&quot;.

<text>Ludwig von Henk (4 March 1820, Anklam – 17 October 1894) was a German naval officer, who distinguished himself in the Prussian Navy and later in the Imperial German Navy of the German Empire. He retired as a Vice-Admiral.

==Naval career==
Henk was born in Anklam, Province of Pomerania. He began his career in merchant ships, making journeys to Brazil, the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea. In 1844, he was promoted to captain. After the establishment of the Prussian Navy in 1849, he entered as an auxiliary officer, becoming a &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; (&quot;KL&quot;—Captain Lieutenant) in 1855 and a &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; (Corvette Captain) in 1859. From August to October 1858, he commanded the aviso .

In 1861 he went to Berlin as the head of the Hydrographic Bureau in the Prussian War Ministry. In 1865, he became captain of the steam corvette , which was sent to the Mediterranean.

During the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Henk was commander of the Prussian North Sea Fleet.

Over the winter of 1866–1867, Henk commanded the steam frigate on a cruise to the Mediterranean, in company with the gunboat . &quot;Gazelle&quot; struck a merchant ship in Constantinople in February 1867; Henk had been asleep at the time of the collision and the investigation placed the blame for it on his executive officer, &quot;KL&quot; Johannes Weickhmann. The Admiralty recalled &quot;Gazelle&quot; in April due to the damage sustained in the accident.

In 1867 was promoted to the rank of &quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; (Captain at Sea).

During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, he commanded the armored frigate , part of the North Sea squadron commanded by &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; (Rear Admiral) Eduard von Jachmann. The Prussian fleet sortied only twice to attack the French blockade fleet in the North Sea, in early August and 11 September 1870, but on both occasions the fleet failed to locate any French vessels. For much of the war, &quot;König Wilhelm&quot; struggled with machinery problems that left her confined to port.

After war&#x27;s end became commander of the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea naval station).

In 1871, he was promoted to flag rank as &quot;Konteradmiral&quot;and was ordered to Berlin as Director of the Admiralty the following year, where he served as the deputy to Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the Admiralty. Henk was chosen in large part to reduce the threat to the position of Stosch, a general of the Prussian Army with no naval experience. Henk was an officer of middle-class background, had initially served in the merchant marine before entering the navy, and though he had been exonerated by the investigation into the &quot;Gazelle&quot; collision, it nevertheless had damaged his reputation. Later in 1872, the idea for establishing a permanent &quot;flying squadron&quot; of cruising warships to respond to crises around the world was raised, but Henk rejected it on the grounds that it was excessively expensive; Stosch sided with Henk and the proposal came to nothing. For the majority of his tenure as Director of the Admiralty, Henk was restricted to technical matters after 1874 in a move by Stosch to further limit the challenge Henk might pose to him. As a result, he had authority only on matters of ship building, ordnance, and supply.

He remained there until July 1879.

During this time he was promoted further (1877) to &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; (Vice Admiral), and the following year was raised to the hereditary peerage. He retired in 1879 and was given a pension.

Between 1890 and 1893, Henk served in the Reichstag as a member of the German Conservative Party, representing the electoral district of Ueckermünde-Wollin. He died in Berlin.

<doc id="1338556" wikidata="Q487365" url="?curid=1338556" title="Gateway (telecommunications)">
<text>A gateway is a piece of networking hardware or software used in telecommunications networks that allows data to flow from one discrete network to another. Gateways are distinct from routers or switches in that they communicate using more than one protocol to connect multiple networks and can operate at any of the seven layers of the OSI model.

The term &quot;gateway&quot; can also loosely refer to a computer or computer program configured to perform the tasks of a gateway, such as a default gateway or router, and in the case of HTTP, gateway is also often used as a synonym for reverse proxy. It can also refer to a device installed in homes that combines router and modem functionality into one device, used by ISPs, also called a residential gateway.

==Network gateway==
A network gateway provides a connection between networks and contains devices, such as protocol translators, impedance matchers, rate converters, fault isolators, or signal translators. A network gateway requires the establishment of mutually acceptable administrative procedures between the networks using the gateway. Network gateways, known as protocol translation gateways or mapping gateways, can perform protocol conversions to connect networks with different network protocol technologies. For example, a network gateway connects an office or home intranet to the Internet. If an office or home computer user wants to load a web page, at least two network gateways are accessed—one to get from the office or home network to the Internet and one to get from the Internet to the computer that serves the web page.

On an Internet Protocol (IP) network, IP packets with a destination outside a given subnetwork are sent to the network gateway. For example, if a private network has a base IPv4 address of 192.168.1.0 and has a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, then any data addressed to an IP address outside of 192.168.1.0–192.168.1.255 is sent to the network gateway. IPv6 networks work in a similar way. While forwarding an IP packet to another network, the gateway may perform network address translation.

In enterprise networks, a network gateway usually also acts as a proxy server and a firewall.

On Microsoft Windows, the Internet Connection Sharing feature allows a computer to act as a gateway by offering a connection between the Internet and an internal network.

==Internet-to-orbit gateway==
An Internet-to-orbit gateway (I2O) connects computers or devices on the Internet to computer systems orbiting Earth, such as satellites or crewed spacecraft. Project HERMES, run by the Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency, was first to implement this kind of gateway on June 6, 2009. Project HERMES has a maximum coverage of 22,000 km and can transmit voice and data. The Global Educational Network for Satellite Operations (GENSO) is another type of I2O gateway.

==Cloud storage gateway==
A cloud storage gateway is a network appliance or server which translates cloud storage APIs such as SOAP or REST to block-based storage protocols such as iSCSI, Fiber Channel or file-based interfaces such as NFS or CIFS. Cloud storage gateways enable companies to integrate private cloud storage into applications without moving the applications into a public cloud, thereby simplifying data protection.

==IoT gateway==
An Internet of things (IoT) gateway provides the bridge (protocol converter) between IoT devices in the field, the cloud, and user equipment such as smartphones. The IoT gateway provides a communication link between the field and the cloud, and may provide offline services and real-time control of devices in the field.

To achieve sustainable interoperability in the Internet of things ecosystem, two dominant architectures for data exchange protocols are used: bus-based (DDS, REST, XMPP) and broker-based (AMQP, CoAP, MQTT, JMI). Protocols that support information exchange between interoperable domains are classified as message-centric (AMQP, MQTT, JMS, REST) or data-centric (DDS, CoAP, XMPP). Interconnected devices communicate using lightweight protocols that don&#x27;t require extensive CPU resources. C, Java, Python and some scripting languages are the preferred choices of IoT application developers. IoT nodes use separate IoT gateways to handle protocol conversion, database storage or decision making (e.g. collision handling), in order to supplement the low intelligence of devices.

<doc id="1338575" wikidata="Q4583646" url="?curid=1338575" title="Raby Castle">
<text>Raby Castle () is a medieval castle located near Staindrop in County Durham, England, among of deer park. It was built by John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby, between approximately 1367 and 1390. Cecily Neville, the mother of the Kings Edward IV and Richard III, was born here. After Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland, led the failed Rising of the North in favour of Mary, Queen of Scots in 1569 Raby Castle was taken into royal custody. 
Sir Henry Vane the Elder purchased Raby Castle in 1626 and neighbouring Barnard Castle from the Crown, and the Earls of Darlington and Dukes of Cleveland added a Gothic-style entrance hall and octagonal drawing room. From 1833 to 1891 they were the Dukes of Cleveland and they retain the title of Lord Barnard. Extensive alterations were carried out in the 17th and 18th centuries. It is famed for both its size and its art, including works by old masters and portraits. After 1733 it was frequented from his young age of eleven by the poet Christopher Smart, who eloped briefly at the age of thirteen with Anne Vane, daughter of Henry Vane, who succeeded to the Barnard title. It is a Grade I listed building and open to the public on a seasonal basis.

The castle is still a private home and remains the seat of the Vane family, the Barons Barnard. The 11th Baron carried out an extensive programme of renovation and restoration after inheriting the barony in 1964.

==History==

The House of Neville held the manor of Raby from the 13th century, and, although the family had no formal title, from 1295 they were summoned to Parliament as Barons of Raby.

Ralph Neville, 1st Baron Neville de Raby, was the first to be summoned to Parliament. His heir, John Neville (1299/1300–1335), became a member of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster&#x27;s household, beginning the family&#x27;s link with the Earls of Lancaster. Raby was the family&#x27;s seat of power, and there may have been a fortified house on the site of the present building from around 1300. In the second half of the 14th century the Nevilles began rebuilding several of their properties in northern England, including Raby Castle between roughly 1367 and 1390. In the closing years of the century the Nevilles were becoming one of the most powerful families in northern England, comparable to the House of Percy, who had been made Earls of Northumberland in 1377.

In 1378 Thomas Hatfield Bishop of Durham granted John de Neville a licence to fortify his property at Raby. John died in 1388 and was succeeded by his son, Ralph. Almost nothing of the family&#x27;s papers survives from this period, so there is little documentary evidence of Raby Castle&#x27;s construction. The dating is based mostly on architectural details. In the words of historian Anthony Emery, the work &quot;converted it from a defendable house into a palace-fortress&quot;.

Ralph was created Earl of Westmorland on 29 September 1397 by Richard II as a reward for his loyalty in the face of political unrest. However his family&#x27;s traditional association with the Earls of Lancaster meant that when Henry Bolingbroke of the House of Lancaster invaded in July 1399 Neville sided with Bolingbroke. Neville helped persuade Richard II to abdicate and Henry was crowned as Henry IV. Neville was made Earl Marshal of England on the day of Henry&#x27;s coronation and a Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1403.

Henry Neville, 5th Earl of Westmorland, died in 1564 and was succeeded by his son, Charles. The Nevilles were Catholics and Charles was one of the leaders of the failed Rising of the North in 1569 against England&#x27;s Protestant Queen Elizabeth I. Owing to the severity of the threat to the Crown, more than 800 rebels were executed and Charles Neville and Thomas Percy (Earl of Northumberland and another leader of the rebellion) fled into exile. In 1571 an attainder was issued against Neville and his lands were forfeited to the Crown.
After the Rising of the North the castle became the property of the Crown for more than forty-three years before being bought by Henry Vane the Elder. He was impressed by the size and lands, contrasting with Barnard Castle, which was hemmed in by the surrounding town. The House of Vane was responsible for much of the modernising of the castle, especially the interior. This included renovation of the medieval chapel and drawing room.

The family drove a carriageway though the castle, causing much damage to its medieval fabric. Architect William Burn carried out alterations to Raby Castle between 1843 and 1848, including adding new roofs to the great hall and the chapel and adding a drawing room to one of the towers in Jacobean style. The present family is responsible for the great collection of art in the castle.

On 17 March 1849, when William the then Prince of Orange succeeded to the throne of the Netherlands, he was at that moment a guest of the Duchess of Cleveland in Raby Castle.

In 1890 the former 4th Duke of Cleveland died, leaving the line of succession to the castle and its vast estates unclear. The case was decided in 1891 when the Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords deemed his relative, Henry Vane, to be the 9th Baron Barnard and inheritor of the vast estates of Raby. He did not, however, inherit the title of Duke of Cleveland, which became extinct.

==Layout==
Raby Castle has an irregular plan, with nine towers along its perimeter. The main entrance was in the west through the four-storey Neville Gateway. Access to the gatehouse was via a drawbridge, since replaced by a flagged causeway. The gatehouse originally contained three portcullises, as is shown by the still-visible grooves used to work them. Two smaller towers beside the gatehouse have no defensive function and were added during the renovations of Henry Vane, 2nd Earl of Darlington.

Access to the gatehouse is via a door through the curtain wall, which rose to a height of thirty feet from the waters of the moat. It is strengthened periodically by buttress towers and formed the second line of defence, the moat being the first. The passage along the parapet was the ancient chemin de ronde (&quot;allure&quot;) on which guards were posted. Similar passages can be found at York Castle and around the city of Oxford. The castle buildings surround a central courtyard. Forming its east side is the great hall, also known as the Baron&#x27;s Hall. The interiors of the medieval kitchen and keep are mostly intact.

In 1988, Raby Castle doubled for various royal houses during the production of the 1998 film &quot;Elizabeth&quot;. The famed Raby Lake stood in for the River Thames during the filming of a night-time party scene.

In 2023, American television drama series &quot;Billions&quot; used the castle as the home of Bobby Axelrod, played by Damian Lewis, as shown in Season 7, Episode 2: &quot;Original Sin&quot;.

==Art==
The castle is famous for its works of art, mostly collected by the Vane Family, including old masters and family portraits. Noted artists whose work is in the castle&#x27;s collection include Giordano, Van Dyck and Sir Joshua Reynolds. The Small Drawing Room has a fine collection of sporting paintings, reflecting the interests of the family, including works by Ben Marshall, Henry Bernard Chalon and Sir Alfred Munnings, among others.

There are some fine paintings in the library, including two architectural capriccios, one by Marco and Sebastiano Ricci and the other by Antonio Joli. A number of portraits include two paintings by Sir Peter Lely of Lady Mary Sackville and Louise de Kerouaille, a portrait of William Bankes by Pompeo Batoni and others of the family, including Sir Henry Vane the Elder and Sir Henry Vane the Younger, the latter at one time Governor of Massachusetts.

The pictures in the ante-library are chiefly of the Dutch and Flemish schools of painting and include works by Pieter de Hooch and David Teniers the Younger. The dining room contains some of the castle&#x27;s most impressive paintings, including works by Sir Joshua Reynolds and Sir Anthony van Dyck. The paintings in this room are mostly portraits of members of the family or associates.

<doc id="1338578" wikidata="Q4043185" url="?curid=1338578" title="Lords of Chaos (video game)">
<text>Lords of Chaos is a turn-based tactics tactical role-playing game published by Blade Software in 1990. It is the sequel to &quot;&quot; and an ancestor of the popular &quot;X-COM&quot; series of games, also written by Julian Gollop. In &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; each player controls a wizard who can cast various magic spells. The spells have various effects, for example summoning other creatures (which the player also controls), or damaging opposing creatures and wizards. The game can be played against a computer-controlled opponent or by up to four human players.

==Gameplay==
Before embarking on the game&#x27;s levels, the player is asked to design a wizard. This is done by splitting experience points amongst mana, action points, stamina, constitution, combat, defense and magic resistance. Remaining experience points are spent on spells. Spells may be offensive in nature (Magic Bolt, Curse), potions (Speed Potion, Healing Potion), utility (Teleport, Magic Eye) or summoning (Goblin, Unicorn, etc.). These spells continue the theme from &quot;&quot; and include some of that game&#x27;s more unusual elements (Gooey Blob, for example). After completing each scenario, the player may spend accumulated experience points to further improve their wizard.

The aim of each level of the game is for a player&#x27;s wizard to reach a portal which appears after a preset number of turns. To do this, the player&#x27;s wizard and creatures move around a map composed of square tiles, each of which represents one of various terrain types (for example, forest or the wall of a building). During a player&#x27;s turn, only the parts of the map which that player&#x27;s wizard or creatures have previously seen are shown, thus leading to other human players having to look away from the screen during each turn to avoid learning information they &quot;shouldn&#x27;t&quot; know. Points are awarded for a player&#x27;s wizard reaching the portal, for holding items of treasure (for example, valuable gems) when the wizard reaches the portal, or for enemy creatures killed during the level. Each level ends when all wizards have reached the portal or been killed, or when the portal disappears after a fixed number of turns (in which case all the remaining wizards lose). During each turn, each creature has a fixed number of action points which it can use to accomplish actions, for example moving, fighting hand-to-hand or shooting ranged weapons. When a creature&#x27;s action points are used up for the turn, it can take no further actions until all the players have had a turn.

The game came shipped with three scenarios: &quot;The Many Coloured Land&quot; provided both indoor and outdoor environments; &quot;Slayer&#x27;s Dungeon&quot; was a traditional monster-inhabited dungeon containing a powerful sword; and &quot;Ragaril&#x27;s Domain&quot; was single-player only, set in a trap-filled palace. An expansion pack was also available if purchased directly from Mythos Games which contained two further scenarios: &quot;Islands of Iris&quot; and &quot;Tombs of the Undead&quot;, the latter being single-player only.

A demonstration scenario called &quot;Escape From Zol&quot; was released on the covers of &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; and &quot;Zero&quot; magazines. It was single-player only and similar in style to &quot;Ragaril&#x27;s Domain&quot; where the player had to escape from a trap-filled building, but even if the player won, their wizard&#x27;s experience could not be used in the other five scenarios.

==Release==
&quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; was released on both 8-bit and 16-bit platforms. The 8-bit versions (for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC) were released in April 1990, with the 16-bit versions (Atari ST and Commodore Amiga) following in August 1991. The prices were £9.95 for the Spectrum/Commodore 64/Amstrad CPC tape, £19.95 for the Atari ST disk and £24.95 for the Commodore Amiga disk. An IBM PC version was scheduled for release but never emerged.

==Reception==
The Spectrum version of &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; was reviewed in 1990 by &quot;Your Sinclair&quot;, awarding 90%, and by &quot;CRASH&quot;, awarding 80%. Both reviews highlighted the game&#x27;s detailed, colourful graphics and the complexity and depth of the strategic gameplay.

The game won the award for best adventure game of the year, as voted by the readers of &quot;Crash&quot;. It was also voted number 21 in the Your Sinclair Readers&#x27; Top 100 Games of All Time.

<text>Arnoro was a charter airline based in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was established in 2004 and started operations in November 2004. It operated services to Scandinavia and Turkey. Its main base was Sarajevo International Airport.

From start Arnoro had many technical problems. Flights to Scandinavia were soon forbidden because there were not installed security door between cockpit and passenger cabin on their MD-81. Flights were canceled and no money was given back to any of passengers. After three months flights started again, but did not last very long. Sarajevo airport did not allowed Arnoro to fly anymore because of their bill. Arnoro continued flights form Mostar&#x27;s airport.

Arnoro moved to charter flights and went to Albania, Spain and Africa. In Gabon Arnoro MD-81 landed to pick passengers but as Gabon&#x27;s government says they have no rights to enter their country and crew on plane was left with no supplement of food for three days. Bosnian and French government made deal to return crew to Sarajevo but for Gabon to keep the plane. Arnoro canceled all his operations and simply gone missing.

<text>Centre of Indian Communists (CIC) was a minor Maoist group in the Indian state of Kerala 1974-1978. CIC was a continuation of the Communist Unity Centre, formed in 1972 and was later supplanted by the Communist Bolshevik Party. CIC was formed by sectors that had broken away from the Communist Party of India (Marxist). CIC represented a moderate trend in the Indian Maoist movement. The organization was banned during the Emergency.

== History ==

=== Communist Unity Centre 1972-1974 ===
The Communist Unity Centre, the forerunner of CIC, was formed in April 1972 through the merger of the groups of A.V. Aryan, K.P.R. Gopalan and Arayakandi Achuthan. A.V. Aryan&#x27;s group was a significant split from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Thrissur. A.V. Aryan had been expelled from CPI(M) due to differences with E.M.S. Namboodiripad. There was significant tensions and conflict between the CUC in Thrissur and the CPI(M) led by Azhikodan Raghavan. Primarily CUC challenged CPI(M) for control over the trade union movement in the area. CUC was denounced as a &#x27;Naxalite&#x27; group by CPI(M), and Azhikodan Raghavan had been tasked by E.M.S. Namboodiripad to break the influence of CUC in the area. To a certain extent the CPI(M) was able to curtail the influence of CUC in Thrissur. Azhikodan Raghavan was murdered on September 23, 1972, and police immediately suspected the CUC. David, a porter and CUC member, was killed by CPI(M) members. A.V. Aryan, who was one of the CUC secretaries, and seven other CUC members were arrested and put on trial for the assassination. A.V. Aryan was released, whilst one of his co-defendants was sentenced to life imprisonment and the six others to one year and a half in prison. After the murder of Azhikodan Raghavan the influence of CUC declined.

=== Founding of CIC and the efforts for unity of Maoist organizations ===
The Centre of Indian Communists was founded at a convention in Cochin in 14-15 December 1974. The convention was attended by 500 delegates, including some prominent former CPI(M) members. Attendees included K.P.R. Gopalan, , J. Abraham and M.T. Thomas. The founding convention elected a 19-member committee with A.V. Aryan as its chairman. Arayakandi Achuthan was one of the committee members. 

The CIC convention pledged to adhere to the ideological line of the Communist Party of China, but adapting it to local conditions. The convention called for the establishment of a &#x27;people&#x27;s government&#x27; through revolutionary armed struggle of workers and peasants. The document adopted by the founding convention identified Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI(ML)) as &#x27;Indian Narodniks&#x27;. CIC denounced the Communist Party of India for &#x27;right-wing opportunism&#x27;, the CPI(M) for &#x27;left-wing opportunism&#x27; and CPI(ML) for &#x27;adventurism&#x27;. &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot; described the CIC as, compared to other splinter-groups of CPI(M), as &#x27;mellow&#x27;.

At the time of its foundation CIC claimed to be in contact with groups outside Kerala, such as the Lenin Banner group in West Bengal, the T. Nagi Reddy group in Andhra Pradesh and the A.K. Roy group in Bihar. However Manoranjan Mohanty noted that later CIC stayed away from participating in the efforts to unify different Maoist groups in India during the latter half of the 1970s.

=== 1975 ban and foundation of the Communist Bolshevik Party ===
CIC was one of ten Maoist groups that were banned by the Central government on 3 July 1975. After the end of the Emergency the Shah Commission noted that one member of the banned CIC was detained. The ban was lifted in March 1977. In May 1978 &quot;The Hindu&quot; reported that members of CIC had participated in the founding of the a new party, Communist (Bolshevik) Party, in at a conference in Cochin, together with former members of CPI, CPI(M), the Communist Unity Centre and the People&#x27;s Democratic Front. The main leaders of the Communist Bolshevik Party were K.P.R. Gopalan and A.V. Aryan. In 1979 the publication &quot;Bolshevik&quot; began to be issued from Thrissur, edited by A.V. Aryan.

<text>Carl Thomas Keifer (born January 26, 1961) is an American musician. He is the lead singer, primary songwriter, and one of the guitarists for the hard rock band Cinderella.

==Early life==
Tom Keifer is a native of Springfield, Pennsylvania. He grew up in a musical family and began playing guitar at a young age. He soon discovered and loved Blues music and was heavily influenced by it.

Keifer joined his first rock band while attending Springfield High School. He soon learned to play the electric guitar. The young musician struggled with drug and alcohol abuse in high school, and considered dropping out of school to pursue a music career. However, his mother Adrienne bribed her son to stay in school by promising him a Gibson Les Paul guitar upon graduation. Keifer graduated and received the coveted instrument.

==Early career==
Soon, Keifer conquered his addictions, and began to focus on a career as a musician. He had started writing original material. He also found financial support by walking race horses at tracks and delivering film to developing outlets, and for a time was a member of a Central Pennsylvania band named Telepath. Keifer came closer to his dream of being a successful artist by forming the hard rock band Cinderella with good friend and bassist Eric Brittingham. Despite being shy, Keifer took on the role of lead singer because they could not find anyone they liked to sing for the band. In articles, Keifer has said, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel comfortable when I&#x27;m up there singing and not playing guitar. I feel naked when it&#x27;s just me and the microphone.&quot;

===Discovery===
Cinderella was discovered initially by Gene Simmons of Kiss who unsuccessfully attempted to get the band signed.

It was then that Jon Bon Jovi in 1985, at the Empire Rock Club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, convinced his Mercury A&amp;R manager Derek Schulman to sign the band. Bon Jovi has been quoted as saying, &quot;I saw Tommy Keifer onstage delivering some pretty nifty, growling vocals. Then he whipped out this Les Paul and proceeded to lay into some astounding sounds. This guy struck me as a star right then and there.&quot;

Keifer and company experienced much success with their albums, &quot;Night Songs&quot;, &quot;Long Cold Winter&quot;, and &quot;Heartbreak Station&quot;. Keifer enjoyed the reputation of being a prolific songwriter with hits such as &quot;Shake Me&quot;, &#x27;&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot;, &quot;Gypsy Road&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Know What You Got (Till It&#x27;s Gone)&quot;, &quot;Coming Home&quot;, &quot;Shelter Me&quot;, and &quot;Heartbreak Station&quot;. He also enjoyed spending time with his wife, Emily, whom he had married in 1987 after years of dating. She also designed the band&#x27;s unique logo and often accompanied her husband on tour.

==Later years==

After the &quot;Heartbreak Station&quot; tour Keifer lost his voice and was diagnosed with paralysis of the left vocal cord. In 1994, Cinderella released their fourth album, &quot;Still Climbing&quot;. It received little attention, and the band broke up in 1995.

Keifer continued to undergo surgeries on his vocal cords. He also battled depression. He was forced to learn how to sing again because of the paralysis of his left cord, but he eventually began working on material for a solo album. He and Emily divorced, and he settled in Nashville, Tennessee, where he continued to work on his solo album. The album was put on hold after Cinderella reunited in 1997 and toured in 1998. They signed with Sony Music, but were dropped a few years later. They released a greatest hits album, &quot;Once upon a…&quot; and a live album, &quot;Live at the Key Club&quot;. Cinderella toured the United States in 2000 and again in 2002.

Keifer has a daily regimen, including warm-ups and exercises, that may last longer than some of his shows; however, Keifer feels that he has his condition &quot;under control.&quot;

===Touring===
Cinderella was the headliner of the 2005 Rock Never Stops Tour. Keifer and Cinderella completed their 20th anniversary tour with fellow rock veterans Poison in 2006, who were also celebrating twenty years in the music business. The tour was a rousing success and swiftly became one of the most successful tours of 2006, averaging about 12,000 people in attendance per night.

Cinderella had planned to tour in 2008 with Warrant, Lynch Mob, and Lynam. Unfortunately the tour had to be postponed after Keifer&#x27;s left vocal cord hemorrhaged again, thereby making it impossible for him to sing in the immediate future. Keifer has recently worked with country artist Andy Griggs. He also appeared on an episode of &quot;Extreme Makeover&quot;, where he helped a fan write a song. Keifer has finished his solo album, which was released on April 30, 2013.

As of May 2, 2013, Keifer has been touring his solo album &quot;The Way Life Goes&quot;, moving from California, across the Midwest, culminating in Chicago. The tour also visited many countries, including Russia.

On Sunday July 22, 2017, Keifer was an act featured in Loud-N-Lima&#x27;s 3-Day Music Festival in Lima, Ohio fеaturing many artists from the hair metal era&#x27;s peak.

==Present-day==
In a November 23, 2009, interview with Metalzone, Keifer said that while Cinderella never disbanded, they were on a hiatus due to his vocal problems and required rehabilitation.

&quot;I thought that I was there in the summer of 2008 for the tour for the States here, and we ended up having to cancel that tour because I re-injured my voice. Since then I&#x27;ve been working on trying to get it strong again, which I am glad to say it&#x27;s very strong now and we&#x27;re looking to be back out on the road in 2010.&quot; When asked about his solo record, (as of April 2010) he said &quot;It’s pretty much finished. I’m booking a mastering date, probably in May sometime, before we hit the road for the summer. Then I will be looking for a label for it&quot;. When asked about the possibility of a new Cinderella record, Tom said it is probable but the band would need to be all in for it, and the record label would need to be for it.

In 2013, Keifer discussed the progress of his solo album, and was quoted saying the following:
&quot;The idea for a solo record started in the Nineties when the band parted ways and we left Universal,&quot; said the frontman. &quot;There was just a changing of the guard in the industry at that time and I started thinking about a solo record. I wrote for it for many years and the songs just kept going on the pile and I never got around to actually making a record... We started cutting tracks for this record in 2003 and I went to the pile of songs that had been building up and picked some that I liked and I&#x27;ve just been working on it ever since. It was produced independently of a label, because the idea from the beginning was to just work and record until I was happy with it. I wrote with a lot of different people – my wife, Savannah, who&#x27;s a great writer, co-wrote a lot of the songs on the record and also co-produced the record with me, and a good friend of ours, Chuck Turner, who&#x27;s a great engineer and producer. So from the beginning, the attitude was, &#x27;Let&#x27;s have fun and just make a great record and it&#x27;ll be done when it&#x27;s done.&#x27; Little did we know it&#x27;d be nine years later... it&#x27;s done and we went through some crazy stuff and mixed and remixed and reworked things over and over and probably made a lot of mistakes along the way, but finally got it where we were all happy with it, so here it is.&quot;

==Personal life==
Keifer is married to singer-songwriter Savannah Snow. In February 2004, their first child was born.

<text>The water industry provides drinking water and wastewater services (including sewage treatment) to residential, commercial, and industrial sectors of the economy. Typically public utilities operate water supply networks. The water industry does not include manufacturers and suppliers of bottled water, which is part of the beverage production and belongs to the food sector.

The water industry includes water engineering, operations, water and wastewater plant construction, equipment supply and specialist water treatment chemicals, among others.

The water industry is at the service of other industries, e.g. of the food sector which produces beverages such as bottled water.

==Organizational structure==
There are a variety of organizational structures for the water industry, with countries usually having one dominant traditional structure, which usually changes only gradually over time.

===Ownership of water infrastructure and operations===
* local government - the most usual structure worldwide, public utility
* national government - in many developing countries, especially smaller ones
* private ownership - more common in the developed world, see for example Water privatisation in England and Wales
* co-operative ownership and related NGO structures, public utility

===Operations===
* local government operating the system through a municipal department, municipal company, or inter-municipal company
* local government outsources operations to private sector, i.e. private water operators
* national government operations
* private water operators owns the system
** BOTs - private sector building parts of a water system (such as a wastewater treatment plant) and operating it for an agreed period before transferring to public sector ownership and operation.
* cooperation and NGO operators

===Functions===
* Integrated water system (water supply, sewerage (sanitation) system, and wastewater treatment) 
* Separation by function (e.g. Dutch system where sewerage run by city, water supply by municipal or provincial companies, and water treatment by water boards), though some Water Supply Companies have merged beyond municipal or provincial borders. 
* Other separation (e.g. Munich, separated into three companies for bulk water supply, water and wastewater network operations, and retail)

==Standards==
Water quality standards and environmental standards relating to wastewater are usually set by national bodies. 
* In England, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and the Environment Agency.
* In the United States, drinking water standards for public water systems are set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA issues water pollution control standards in conjunction with state environmental agencies, pursuant to the Clean Water Act.
* For countries within the European Union, water-related European Union directives are important for water resource management and environmental and water quality standards. Key directives include the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive 1992 requiring most towns and cities to treat their wastewater to specified standards, and the Water Framework Directive 2000, which requires water resource plans based on river basins, including public participation based on Aarhus Convention principles. 
* International Standards (ISO) on water service management and assessment are under preparation within Technical Committee ISO/TC 224.
==Global companies==
Using available data only, and during 2009 - 2010, the ten largest water companies active globally were (largest first) : Veolia Environnement (France), Suez Environnement (France), ITT Corporation (US), United Utilities (UK), Severn Trent (UK), Thames Water (UK), American Water Works Company (US), GE Water (US), Kurita Water Industries (Japan), Nalco Water (US).

<text>The Long Ships or Red Orm (original Swedish: Röde Orm meaning &quot;Red Orm&quot;, lit. &quot;Red Serpent&quot; or &quot;Red Snake&quot;) is an adventure novel by the Swedish writer Frans G. Bengtsson. 
The narrative is set in the late 10th century and follows the adventures of the Viking Röde Orm - called &quot;Red&quot; for his hair and his temper, a native of Scania. The book portrays the political situation of Europe in the later Viking Age, Andalusia under Almansur, Denmark under Harald Bluetooth, followed by the struggle between Eric the Victorious and Sven Forkbeard, Ireland under Brian Boru, England under Ethelred the Unready, and the Battle of Maldon, and then the Byzantine Empire and its Varangian Guard, Kievan Rus and its neighbors the Patzinaks - all before the backdrop of the gradual Christianization of Scandinavia, contrasting the pragmatic Norse pagan outlook with the exclusiveness of Islam and Christianity.

The novel is divided into two parts, published in 1941 and 1945, with two books each. It used to be one of the most widely read books in Sweden. The first part was translated into English by Barrows Mussey as &quot;Red Orm&quot; in 1943, but later editions and newer translations by Michael Meyer use the title &quot;The Long Ships&quot;. The book has been translated into at least 23 languages.

==Plot==

The first book covers the years 982 to 990. While still a youth, Orm is abducted by a Viking party led by Krok and they sail south. They fall captive to Andalusian Muslims and serve as galley slaves for more than two years, later becoming members of Almansur&#x27;s bodyguard for four years, raiding Santiago de Compostela under his command. They return to Denmark to King Harald Bluetooth&#x27;s court where Orm meets Ylva and Father Willibald. Orm later returns to Scania with Rapp. Orm and Rapp join a Viking party raiding England again after a brief period of peace in that area following the reconquest of the Danelaw in the mid-10th century by King Edgar, Ethelred&#x27;s father. Orm joins a party led by Thorkell the High in England and when he learns that Harald&#x27;s daughter Ylva is staying in London, gets baptised and marries her. They move to a neglected farm, his mother&#x27;s inheritance in Göinge, northern Skåne, near the border with Småland. During the following years (992 to 995), Orm prospers, and Ylva gives birth to twin girls (Oddny and Ludmilla), a son, Harald, and later to another son (though possibly from Rainald, a guesting priest), Svarthöfde (Blackhair in the Michael Meyer translation). Meanwhile, Orm also gets busy in converting the heathens in the district, with the help of Father Willibald.

The year 1000 passes without Christ returning. In 1007, with Orm now forty-two, his brother Are returns from the east after serving the Byzantine Empire, bringing the news of a treasure (&quot;the Bulgar gold&quot;) he had hidden. Orm decides to travel to the Dnieper weirs in Kievan Rus for the gold, and together with Toke and the Finnveding chieftain Olof mans a ship. They recover the treasure and return home safely. But on their return they encounter an unexpected crisis at home - Rainald, the rather ridiculous failed German Christian missionary, had become a renegade, turned into a Pagan priest of the old Norse gods and the leader of a formidable band of robbers and outlaws, and causes great havoc before being finally overcome. Following this final crisis and from then on, Orm and Toke live in peace and plenty as good neighbours, and Svarthöfde Ormsson becomes a famous Viking, fighting for Canute the Great. The story ends with the statement that Orm and Toke in their old age &quot;did never tire of telling of the years when they had rowed the Caliph&#x27;s ship and served my lord Al-Mansur.&quot;

==Writing process==

The Swedish writer Sven Stolpe reports that somebody asked author Frans G. Bengtsson &quot;what intentions he had with &quot;The Long Ships&quot;&quot;, to which Bengtsson responded that he had no particular intentions. &quot;I just wanted to write a story that people could enjoy reading, like &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; or the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.&quot;

The research for the book was based largely on Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and other old Icelandic literature, but also on medieval chronicles and contemporary research, and historic names, people and events were woven into the fiction. The language of the novel is modelled on the Icelandic sagas. Early in his career, Bengtsson had held a romantic view on the saga literature, promoting an elevated, almost sacral prose in translations, but when writing &quot;The Long Ships&quot; he instead made use of the saga&#x27;s faculties for wisecracks and comic understatements. The main characters were written as likable anti-heroes, far from the romantic view of Vikings. Like the sagas, the book relies on verbs and nouns to drive the narrative, with only a minimum of adjectives and descriptive passages. In essays, Bengtsson expresses disgust with &quot;psychological realism&quot; in the literature of his day where the thoughts and feelings of the characters are discussed explicitly rather than indicated by actions and outward signs. In the Swedish original of &quot;The Longships&quot;, the grammar is deliberately slightly archaic.

Joan Klein noted that &quot;Within the 10th Century plot, the book&#x27;s Viking protagonists never heard of Jews, and have a completely open mind about them - and when encountering a Jew who allies with the Vikings and leads them to treasure beyond their dreams, they are duly grateful (...). However, one can hardly overlook the fact that the book was actually written in a very specific part of the 20th Century - during the Second World War, a time when Nazi Germany was involved in a horrific persecution and massacre of Jews, while the Nazis claimed the Viking heritage for their monstrous version of German and Germanic Nationalism. Bengtsson in effect throws the Viking heritage back in the Nazis&#x27; face&quot; 

==Adaptations==
The 1964 British-Yugoslav film &quot;The Long Ships&quot; (starring Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier) very loosely based on the book, retaining little more than the title (of the English translation) and the Moorish settings. In the 1980s, there were plans for a large-scale Swedish screen adaptation. The film was supposed to be directed by Hans Alfredson and star Stellan Skarsgård as Orm and Sverre Anker Ousdal as Toke. The project was cancelled for financial reasons, but Alfredson&#x27;s script was reworked into radio theatre which was broadcast in 1990.

A comic adaptation by Charlie Christensen in album format was published in four volumes between 2000 and 2004, covering the first book in the series.

Swedish author Mikael Westlund published his debut novel &quot;Svarthöfde&quot; in 2002, which expands on the brief summary at the end of &quot;The Long Ships&quot;, giving the further adventures of Orm&#x27;s son Svarthöfde (Blackhair) and the sons of Sone. As with Bengtsson&#x27;s novel the language has an archaic flavor, leavened with humor, and several historical figures appear.

In 2011 the Swedish production company Fladen Film announced they had acquired the film rights for the book, and that an adaptation was under development.

In May 2014, during the press conference of Swedish film company Film i Väst at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, Danish film producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen, from the Danish film company Zentropa, founded by Lars von Trier, said that he was going to produce an adaptation of the novel. Aalbæk said that he had Stellan Skarsgård in mind as playing the old Röde Orm and his acting sons Alexander, Gustaf, Bill and Valter playing Röde Orm at various stages in his life. This adaptation is planned to be split into two films and also as a TV-series in four parts. Hans Petter Moland from Norway will be directing. Stellan Skarsgård has expressed interest in acting in the film if the script is good. Filming was expected to start in Västra Götaland in 2016, however Film i Väst decided to end their collaboration with Aalbæk and the film project was cancelled.

In 2017, the Royal Danish Theater made a screenplay based on &quot;The Long Ships&quot;, to be played not in the theater, but atop the recently built Moesgård Museum. The play was held atop a giant constructed wooden stage resembling a crashed Viking ship with a dragon&#x27;s head and was based on the second part of Bengtsson&#x27;s book, after Røde Orm returns to Denmark with the bell. The play was directed by Henrik Szklany with Andreas Jebro playing Röde Orm (Røde Orm in Danish). In 2018 the show was brought to Ulvedalene in Dyrehaven park.

In 2020, Royal Dramatic Theatre presented an adaptation of &quot;Röde Orm&quot; featuring Emma Broomé as Orm, Lennart Jähkel as both Krok and king Harald and Karin Franz Körlof as Ylva. Though awarded with rave reviews, the production was cancelled early due to COVID-19.

<doc id="1338619" wikidata="Q7823086" url="?curid=1338619" title="Tony O'Malley">
<text>Tony O&#x27;Malley (25 September 1913 – 20 January 2003) was an Irish artist known for painting. He was born in Callan, County Kilkenny, Ireland. O&#x27;Malley was a self-taught artist, having drawn and painted for pleasure from childhood. He worked as a bank officìal until contracting tuberculosis in the 1940s. He began painting in earnest while convalescing and, though he did at first return to bank work, he continued to paint and in 1951 he began exhibiting his work.

== Life and career ==
In 1955 O&#x27;Malley holidayed in St Ives, Cornwall, then an important centre of abstract art, and home to the artists Peter Lanyon, Patrick Heron, and Bryan Wynter, who he met and worked with. He returned again in 1957 and in 1958 retired from the bank to paint full-time. In Ireland O&#x27;Malley painted landscapes in Kilkenny, Arklow, Enniscorthy, Kilkenny and New Ross. Prompted by a mixture of frustration at the indifference shown in Ireland to his work, an attraction to the sense of freedom he felt among the artists in Cornwall, and an engagement with the attempt to represent natural forms current in their abstraction, he settled in St Ives in 1960. While he was strongly influenced by the St Ives artistic community, his relationship was one of engagement rather than direct participation. His painting never completely assimilated the rigour and formality of the British abstract painters; it retained a muscular extravagance which is central to his artistic identity. O&#x27;Malley explained:
:&quot;Not so much abstract as essence. I could not paint for the sake of the pigment of whatever, but I like abstract form in the painting which instills it with meaning and power. Abstraction does enable you to get under the surface, to get beyond appearance, and to express the mind. But abstraction for its own sake does not interest me.&quot;

Tony O&#x27;Malley adopted a sombre palette in the second half of the 1960s and many of his paintings are dedicated to the memory of his friend and mentor Peter Lanyon who was killed when the glider he was piloting crashed in 1964.

In 1973 O&#x27;Malley married Jane Harris, and through the mid-70s they spent time in the Bahamas and in O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s native Callan. During this period, his paintings became less sombre and the Bahamas paintings are extremely colourful and vibrant. In 1990 they moved back to Ireland. In 1993 Tony O&#x27;Malley was elected a Saoi of Aosdána. When he died in 2003 he was regarded as one of Ireland&#x27;s leading painters.

== Legacy ==
The Irish Museum of Modern Art displayed a major retrospective of his work in 2005.

In 2010 under the guidance of Jane O&#x27;Malley the RHA established an artist&#x27;s residency in the house where Tony O&#x27;Malley grew up in Callan, County Kilkenny. The studio residency is awarded to artists who work primarily in paint. Previous recipients of the Tony O&#x27;Malley Studio Residency Award include Magnhild Opdøl, Ciaran Murphy, Ramon Kassan, Mollie Douthit, David Quinn and Paraic Leahy.

In 2004, Noonan guest appeared at the &quot;Lord Of The Rings Symphony&quot; performances. The reviewer Murray Black said that &quot;The undoubted highlight of the evening was guest vocalist Katie Noonan. Here is a rare talent with a voice of extraordinary beauty and versatility. In most of her solos, she sounded like a classical soprano as she soared over the orchestra with a spine-tingling, vibrato-less angelic purity. Then, in Gollum&#x27;s Song and the Oscar-winning Into the West, she revealed her pop diva credentials with her strong, clear voice projecting effortlessly out in the audience.&quot;

<doc id="1338654" wikidata="Q7748722" url="?curid=1338654" title="The Lost Saucer">
<text>The Lost Saucer is an ABC television series produced by Sid and Marty Krofft, starring Ruth Buzzi and Jim Nabors as hapless aliens who take a boy and his babysitter with them on their flying saucer. It aired new episodes from September to December 1975, with reruns continuing until December 1976, first under its own banner, then as part of &quot;The Krofft Supershow&quot;. It ran in daily syndication from 1978 to 1985 as part of the &quot;Krofft Superstars&quot; package with six other Krofft series.

==Premise==
&quot;The Lost Saucer&quot; was about two friendly time-travelling androids from the year 2369 named Fi (Ruth Buzzi) and Fum (Jim Nabors) who land their flying saucer on present-day (1975) Earth. They good-naturedly invite a young boy named Jerry (Jarrod Johnson) and his babysitter Alice (Alice Playten) to check out the interior of their craft.

As onlookers begin to gather though, the two androids become nervous about attracting attention and abruptly take off with Jerry and Alice. The flying saucer has the ability to travel through time, but the controls which allow the androids to specify an exact date were damaged, thus preventing the androids from returning Jerry and Alice to their rightful time and place.

The series follows the foursome as the two androids (who bicker and argue incessantly with each other, neither seeming competent with the ship&#x27;s controls) encounter various adventures while trying to get Jerry and Alice back home or return to their own home on planet ZR-3 where they hoped to make repairs with the help of their lookalike creators Doctor Locker (Nabors) and Professor Pringle (Buzzi dressed as her purse-wielding spinster character Gladys from &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;).

The adventures are usually set on Earth (or an Earth colony) either in the distant past or in the distant future hundreds (or even thousands) of years hence. Typically, episodes were blatant social commentaries dealing with extremes such as a world where names (and faces) were replaced with numbers, where machines were outlawed due to a global energy shortage, or a city where the population had grown lazy and obese because robots do all the physical work.

Accompanying them on their adventures was a creature known as the Dorse (played by Larry Larsen) which was a half-dog, half-horse hybrid with the body of a large shaggy dog and the head of a small horse.

There were 16 original episodes produced for the 1975–76 season. The first six episodes were later rerun in the first half of &quot;The Krofft Supershow&quot;&#x27;s first season.

==Themes==
Each episode had a specific theme, usually a social or environmental one. &quot;Fat Is Beautiful&quot;, for example, depicted a future in which people were grotesquely obese due to over-dependence on push-button conveniences, and leanness was in fact outlawed. In &quot;Get a Dorse&quot;, two scientists kidnap the Dorse to use as a power source because the world&#x27;s fuel supplies were finally used up.

<text>May East (also known as Maria Elisa Capparelli Pinheiro) is a British/Brazilian urbanist, educator, singer and songwriter. Over the years she has considered herself an artivist.

==Early musical career==
East comes from an artistic community stretching between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. East&#x27;s art expressed a deep concern for Brazil&#x27;s environment both in the major cities and the country&#x27;s interior, specially the rainforests of the Amazon.

East started her career as a singer in the band Gang 90 &amp; Absurdettes in 1981. Their songs mixed new-wave with beatnik poetry and a female choir, inspired by the new-wave band The B-52s. Gang 90 is considered to be the predecessor of all Brazilian new-wave bands of the 80s.

In 1982 she collaborated with the independent TVDO videoart group and in partnership with the producer Nelson Motta co-produced the TV program Mocidade Independente for TV Bandeirantes.

In 1984 she released her first single, &quot;Fire in the jungle/Índio&quot;, in Brazil, The Netherlands and Japan with EMI. Fire in the Jungle became a soundtrack for the film Areias Escaldantes directed by Francisco de Paula.

Some months later, her first album, &quot;Remota Batucada&quot; was launched. The music was an original brand of electronica, folk music, and new wave pop and was coined as &quot;tribal ie-ie&quot;. East also released the albums &quot;Tabapora&quot; and &quot;Charites&quot;. She moved to England and then to the Scottish community of Findhorn, where she focused on ecological activism and began giving lectures and seminars. In the late 90s she released the albums: Cave of the Heart (with the Findhorn Community Chorus) and Cosmic Breath (with her ex-husband Craig Gibsone); and 1001 Faces (solo album) in 2002.

==Career==
East has played a role in developing relationships between the United Nations and the Findhorn Ecovillage, culminating in the establishment of CIFAL Scotland in 2006. The United Nations Institute for Training and Research affiliated training centre for Northern Europe operated for 10 years as a hub for capacity building, leadership and knowledge sharing between local and regional authorities, international organisations, the private sector and civil society under East&#x27;s leadership.

She is the co-founder and has served as Chief Executive of Gaia Education, an international consortium of sustainability designers and educators from research and development centers for carbon-constrained lifestyles. 

East was included three years in a row (2011, 2012, 2013) in the 100 Global Sustain Ability Leaders list, devised and produced by Ken Hickson, Chairman/CEO of Sustain Ability Showcase Asia and ABC Carbon. The list recognises 100 people around the world who have provided leadership in the field of sustainability.

East received in 2019 the Women of the Decade in Sustainability &amp; Leadership Award presented by the Women Economic Forum and All Ladies League.
A UNITAR Fellow she has an MSc in Spatial Planning with specialisation in integrated approaches for the regeneration of abandoned towns in southern Italy, which makes the case for the reactivation of abandoned settlements, the so-called ghost towns in southern Europe, as an alternative housing solution that comes with embedded collective memory and offers ‘locally adaptable, culturally rooted’ opportunities for communities. She has contributed a chapter of her findings to the book &quot;From Conflict to Inclusion in Housing: Interaction of Communities, Residents and Activists&quot;.

East is one of the co-founders of the Global Ecovillage Network and has lived for 15 years in the Findhorn Ecovillage where she established a new strand of Education for Sustainable Development.

She holds a PhD in Architecture and Urban Planning with the University of Dundee on the topic &quot;What if Women Designed the City?&quot;

Since 2013 East has been contributing articles to &quot;The Scotsman&quot;
&quot;The Guardian&quot;, the Scientific Journal of the European Ecocycles Society
and &quot;Sustainability (journal)&quot; published by &quot;MDPI&quot;

<doc id="1338661" wikidata="Q7934152" url="?curid=1338661" title="Virginia Board of Wildlife Resources">
<text>The Virginia Board of Wildlife Resources (formerly the Commission of Game and Inland Fisheries) oversees the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources.

==Membership==
The Code of Virginia provides that &quot;the Board shall consist of not more than one member from each congressional district&quot;. Following Census 2000, Virginia was allocated 11 Congressional districts; therefore, the Board was limited to a maximum of 11 members.

Members are appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the General Assembly.

==Powers==

The Board has power to:
*Appoint the Director of the Department,
*Acquire lands and waters in the Commonwealth,
*Establish buildings, structures, dams, lakes, ponds, public landings, wharves, or docks,
*Regulate or prohibit drilling, dredging or other operations on VDGIF property,
*Conduct operations for the preservation and propagation of game birds, game animals, fish and other wildlife,
*Introduce new species of game birds, game animals or fish to Virginia,
*Publish and distribute educational matter pertaining to wildlife,
*Collect user fees for admittance, parking, and hunting,
*Delegate power to the Director of Game and Inland Fisheries, and
*Regulate hunting, taking, capture, killing, possession, sale, purchase and transportation of wild birds, wild animals, and inland water fish.

==Rulemaking process==
The Board holds meetings every year to consider amendments to the Virginia Administrative Code. In even-numbered years, fish and aquatic regulations are reviewed. In odd numbered years, game and terrestrial nongame wildlife regulations are reviewed. Procedures for emergency situations had not yet been developed, as of 2004.

==Well-known regulations==
===Snakeheads===
A high-profile regulation issued by the Board is 4VAC15-30-40, which bans the importation of snakehead fish.

===Wild animals===
*4VAC15-30-10 bans possession of wild animals in Virginia.
*4VAC15-20-50 defines a wild animal as &quot;Any member of the animal kingdom, except domestic animals, including without limitation any native, naturalized, or nonnative (exotic) mammal, fish, bird, amphibian, reptile, mollusk, crustacean, arthropod or other invertebrate, and includes any hybrid of them, except as otherwise specified in regulations of the board, or part, product, egg, or offspring of them, or the dead body or parts of them.&quot;

The regulation then lists 26 domestic animals (dogs, cats, horses, etc.) which are exempt from the definition. Some Virginians, such as ferret and skunk enthusiasts, would like to see additional animals added to the list of allowed pets.

<text>Kamal Ramzi Stino (ar: كمال رمزي استينو) (July 10, 1910 – 1987) was born in Mansoura, Egypt. His father, Ramzi Beik Stino Hanna was the first Egyptian irrigation engineer to take over supervision duties for the entire Egyptian irrigation system under the British. At that time, Egypt was under British rule. His mother, Afefa Michael Gad, was the daughter of one of the most prominent Coptic landowners in the country. Kamal was the eldest of his five siblings.

Stino earned a Bachelor of Science degree in agriculture from the University of California, Davis, and a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley. His field of study was plant cytogenetics. He worked for the USDA in Bethesda, Maryland, for one year as a post-doctorate internship. When he returned to Egypt, he joined the College of Agriculture, Cairo University, Department of Agronomy. He taught thousands of students that received their bachelor&#x27;s degree from the College of Agriculture. He also developed a large graduate congregation of his students. More than 120 graduate students received their Master&#x27;s degree and more than 80 graduate students received their Ph.D.’s under his supervision. He published more than 160 scientific papers in reputable scientific journals. He also wrote 4 textbooks on vegetables. He developed more than 12 new varieties of sweet potato, yams, squash, watermelon, melon and eggplants.

In 1956 Gamal Abdel Nasser, the president of Egypt at the time, chose him to be the only Coptic Christian Minister (Secretary) of supply and trade in the Egyptian cabinet. He held over the course of 14 years. He was also the Deputy Prime Minister for the last 6 years of his appointment. During his career, he developed several systems to help the Egyptian poor. He launched a program to sell food staples to the public at subsidized prices through government-owned stores. These stores are still in operation as of 2020. He also developed a system to offer food ration cards to the poor to ensure that they had enough sustenance.

==National Poultry Company==
Stino also initiated the development of the National Poultry Company that introduced broilers for the first time in Egypt; the National Meat Company which tried to produce a larger buffalo veal in Egypt and the National Fishery Company that introduced raising fish commercially and that had the first high sea commercial fishing fleet in Egypt. In 1970 he was chosen to head the Center of Agriculture Research. In 1972, he was elected as the first Director General of the Arab Organization of Agriculture Development.

==Family==
He was married to Lady Farida (Hanem) Shawki Shenouda and had his firstborn son, Farid, with her. When she died due to complications during delivery, he married her sister, Lady Madeline, and had a son, Sherif, and a daughter, Maisie. In addition to being a prominent figure in Egyptian politics himself, Dr Stino&#x27;s brother Moheb was also appointed as minister of tourism and aviation under President Sadat. His other brother, Charles was vice-minister of industry and trade under Nasser.

<text>Portman Road is a football stadium in Ipswich, Suffolk, England, which has been the home ground of Ipswich Town since 1884. The stadium has also hosted many England youth international matches, and one senior England friendly international match, against Croatia in 2003. It staged several other sporting events, including athletics meetings and international hockey matches, musical concerts and Christian events.

Ipswich Town moved to the ground in 1884 and continue to play their home matches there. The stadium recorded its highest attendance in March 1975, when 38,010 fans attended a match against Leeds United. Its four stands were converted to all-seater in the early 1990s following the recommendations of the Taylor Report. The stadium underwent significant redevelopments in the early 2000s, which increased the capacity from 22,600 to 30,311, making it the largest-capacity football ground in East Anglia. Once the Gamechanger 20 Ltd takeover in 2021 was completed, the club invested heavily in the stadium to bring it more up to date after years of neglect from the previous ownership. This included new dugouts, undersoil heating and a new hybrid pitch which slightly reduced the overall attendance to 29,673. After the club&#x27;s promotion back to the Premier League in 2024, the club had to invest heavily again into the stadium to bring it up to the Premier League’s standards. This included over 100 projects ranging from new press and camera areas to increasing the away supporter allocation. Once these upgrades were completed, this increased the overall capacity to the current figure of 30,056.

==History==
Ipswich played their early matches at Broomhill Park, but in 1884, the club moved to Portman Road and have played there ever since. The ground was also used as a cricket pitch during the summer by the East Suffolk Cricket Club, who had played there since 1855. The cricket club had erected a pavilion, the first fixed building at the ground. More substantial elements of ground development did not begin for a further eleven years, though Ipswich became one of the first clubs to implement the use of goal nets in 1890. At this time, Ipswich were an amateur side (the team became professional in 1936) and the first visit of a professional club came in 1892, when Preston North End played a Suffolk County Football Association team. This was followed six years later by a visit from Aston Villa, a game which was so popular that a temporary stand was erected in order to accommodate a crowd of around 5,000. In 1901, a tobacco processing plant was built along the south edge of the ground by the Churchman brothers, a name which would later become synonymous with the south stand located there.

The first permanent stand, a wooden structure known affectionately as the &quot;Chicken Run&quot;, was built on the Portman Road side of the ground in 1906. This structure was sold in 1971 to the local speedway team, the Ipswich Witches, who installed it at Foxhall Stadium. In 1914, the ground was commandeered by the British Army for use as a training camp for the duration of the First World War. Control of Portman Road was not returned to the club until two years after the end of the war and significant work was required to repair damage to the ground caused by heavy machinery.
For a short period during the 1920s, Portman Road was host to a number of whippet races in an attempt to increase revenue, and in 1928 a small stand was built on the west side of the ground. The football club turned professional in 1936 and the cricket club were forced to move out, so work began on the first bank of terracing at the north end of the pitch. The following year, on the back of winning the Southern League, a similar terrace was built at the southern Churchmans End and 650 tip-up seats, bought from Arsenal, were installed. Portman Road was home to Ipswich Town&#x27;s first Football League match on 27 August 1938, a 4–2 victory against Southend United in the Third Division (South) witnessed by more than 19,000 spectators.

The Supporters&#x27; Association funded a number of improvements at Portman Road; in 1952, concrete terracing replaced the wooden terraces at the cost of £3,000 and another £3,000 was used to re-terrace the North Stand in 1954, bringing the capacity of the ground to approximately 29,000. In 1957, the association raised £30,500 towards the building of a new West Stand, increasing ground capacity to around 31,000. Floodlights were installed two years later; the result of £15,000 raised by the association. The floodlights were switched on by club president Lady Blanche Cobbold for the first floodlit match at the ground, a friendly against Arsenal, in February 1960.

Television cameras made their debut at Portman Road in 1962 as Anglia Television arrived for &quot;Match of the Week&quot;; it was another six years before the BBC televised a match at the ground, &quot;Match of the Day&quot; visiting Portman Road for the first time in 1968 to witness Ipswich&#x27;s league fixture against Birmingham City. Meanwhile, ground development continued with roofing enhancements to the North Stand and an increase in capacity to 31,500 by 1963. Dressing rooms were constructed in 1965 and new turnstiles were introduced two years later, including a separate entrance for juveniles at the Churchmans End. In 1968 the club agreed to a new 99-year lease on the ground with owners Ipswich Borough Council.
The two-tier propped cantilever Portman Stand was built along the east side of the ground in place of the existing terraces in 1971, providing 3,500 additional seats and increasing the capacity of the ground to approximately 37,000. Advertising appeared around the perimeter of the ground in the same year, while the following year saw the construction of the &quot;Centre Spot&quot; restaurant underneath the Portman Stand. Additional seating was added to the Portman Stand in 1974 and the ground saw its record attendance of 38,010 the following year in an FA Cup tie against Leeds United. Following success in the 1978 FA Cup, the club invested in 24 executive boxes in front of the Portman Stand and, as a result of the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975, reduced the capacity in front by introducing seats, taking the overall capacity down to 34,600.
Plastic seats replaced wooden benches in the West Stand in 1980 and in the following year, the club announced a deal with electronics company Pioneer Corporation with the stand expanded at a cost of around £1.3m, renamed the Pioneer Stand and re-opened in 1983. However, the cost of building the stand meant the club had to sell players and led to a decline in fortunes on the pitch. Safety barriers were removed from the North Stand in 1989 following the Hillsborough disaster and following the recommendations of the Taylor Report, the terraces in both the North and South stands were also converted to all-seating. The Pioneer Stand was renamed the Britannia Stand following a new sponsorship deal with the building society in 1999, and in the following year a statue of Sir Alf Ramsey was unveiled at the corner of Portman Road and Sir Alf Ramsey Way.

Success for Ipswich Town in promotion to the Premier League in 2000 led to further investment in the infrastructure, with the club spending around £22 million on redeveloping both the North and South stands. The complete renovation of the South Stand into a two-tier stand added 4,000 seats to the stadium. The subsequent demolition and reconstruction of a two-tier North Stand added a further 4,000 seats and brought the total capacity of the ground to more than 30,000. In 2001, local brewery Greene King took on the sponsorship of the updated South Stand and as such, the stand was renamed the Greene King Stand until 2009, when the sponsorship deal ended and the name reverted to the South Stand.

Following the death of former manager Bobby Robson in 2009, the club announced that the North Stand would be renamed the Sir Bobby Robson Stand. The official unveiling took place at half-time during the league match hosting Newcastle United, another of Robson&#x27;s former clubs, on 26 September 2009. On 31 March 2012, the South Stand was renamed the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand in memory of Sir Alf Ramsey, who guided Ipswich Town to the First Division title in 1962. The season was the 50th anniversary of Ipswich Town winning the old First Division title. On 10 July 2012, the Britannia Stand was renamed East of England Co-operative Stand following a sponsorship deal with the East of England Co-operative Society.

Following the club&#x27;s change in ownership in April 2021, it was announced that improvements to Portman Road would begin that summer. These included the prospect of introducing safe standing sections and giant LED screens, improvements to concourse bars, removal of old Marcus Evans branding, as well as general cleanup and restoration work. In July 2021, it was also announced that East of England Co-Op would not be extending their sponsorship of the West Stand, thus the stand&#x27;s name returned to simply the &#x27;West Stand&#x27;. In August 2021, the Magnus Group was announced as the new sponsors of the West Stand, thus the stand became known as the &#x27;Magnus Group West Stand&#x27; until the agreement ended in 2023.

In March 2022, the club applied for planning permission to install a large LED screen at the south-east corner of the pitch as well as improvements to the dug outs and adding a new access on the south-east corner. Both of these additions were completed in time for the start of the 2022–23 season. Additionally, the club has purchased the land behind the Sir Alf Ramsey stand, the use of which is yet to be confirmed. A new hybrid pitch was also installed in the summer of 2023 in time for the start of the 2023–24 football season. Following the club&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League in 2024, further improvements to the stadium were made to bring the stadium up to Premier League standards - these included new floodlight systems, changing rooms, media facilities, and executive boxes.

==Structure and facilities==
The pitch is surrounded by four all-seater stands, the Sir Bobby Robson Stand, the Cobbold Stand, the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand and the West Stand. All stands are covered and are multi-tiered.
===Sir Bobby Robson Stand===
The Sir Bobby Robson Stand was completely rebuilt in 2001 following Portman Road&#x27;s redevelopment and has a capacity of around 7,500. It is a two-tier cantilever stand which is divided into an adults-only lower tier &quot;...traditionally for the &#x27;hard core&#x27; Town fan...&quot; and a mixed upper tier. It was previously known as simply the North Stand but was renamed to its current name in 2009 following the death of former manager Bobby Robson.

===Cobbold Stand===
The Cobbold Stand was constructed in 1971 and was previously known as the Portman Stand. With two tiers and a cantilever roof, it is used to accommodate away fans, with an allocation of up to 3,000 seats per game and for family seating. It also contains a number of executive boxes as well as regular seating for home fans.

===Sir Alf Ramsey Stand===

The Sir Alf Ramsey Stand is a two-tiered stand which has a match-day capacity of approximately 7,000. Previously known as the South Stand, it was renamed to its current name in March 2012 in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the club&#x27;s First Division title win, which Ramsey achieved as manager. Up until 2000, when the stand was completely rebuilt, it was also commonly referred to as the Churchmens Stand after the family who owned the tobacco factory (before John Players Ltd) which stood next to it. It also houses the &quot;Sir Bobby Robson Suite&quot; restaurant and &quot;Legends Bar&quot;. The tunnel, from which the players emerge onto the pitch from their dressing rooms, is unusually located in the corner of the stadium between the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand and the West Stand.

===West Stand===
The West Stand, first constructed in 1957, was updated to an all-seater stand in 1990 and currently has three tiers consisting of home fan seating and an additional family area. It was previously known as the Pioneer Stand from 1981 to 1999, the Britannia Stand from 1999 to 2012, the East of England Co-operative Stand from 2012 to 2021, and the Magnus Group West Stand from 2021 to 2023. It also contains the directors&#x27; box, further executive boxes and the press area. Behind the stand is a full-size AstroTurf pitch which is often used on a casual basis by fans before home games.
There are nine areas throughout the ground designated for disabled supporters, in the lower West Stand, the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand and the Sir Bobby Robson Stand. These provide over 300 spaces to accommodate wheelchair users and ambulant disabled, together with their carers. The ground also provides 12 seats in the West Stand for visually impaired spectators with commentary via individual radio headsets in each seat, provided by local radio station BBC Radio Suffolk.

The former groundsman, Alan Ferguson, received a number of accolades, including both Premiership and Championship Groundsman of the Year, and the pitch was voted the best in the Championship for three consecutive seasons in 2003, 2004 and 2005.

There are statues of Sir Alf Ramsey and Sir Bobby Robson, both former Ipswich Town and England managers, as well a statue of Kevin Beattie, often considered Ipswich Town&#x27;s greatest ever player, outside the ground. Nearby Portman&#x27;s Walk was renamed &quot;Sir Alf Ramsey Way&quot; in 1999.

==Other uses==

On 20 August 2003, Portman Road hosted its first and thus far only senior England fixture, a friendly against Croatia, the match finishing 3–1 to England in front of 28,700 spectators. The stadium has been used by England youth teams on a number of occasions, the first on 24 November 1971, saw the England U23 team draw 1–1 with Switzerland. England U21s drew in a UEFA European U21 Championship qualifying match there on 18 August 2006 against Moldova, in front of 13,556 spectators.

During the years when Ipswich were members of the Amateur Football Alliance (AFA), Portman Road was a regular venue for showpiece matches, staging AFA Senior Cup Finals and matches against the Corinthians. It also hosted two AFA international representative matches in 1909 and 1910, with an England XI beating teams representing Bohemia (10–1) and France (20–0).

In addition, a variety of other sports have been hosted at Portman Road, including athletics in 1927, an American football match in 1953, and several international hockey matches in the 1960s and 1970s.

The stadium has also hosted several music concerts, including performances by Elton John, R.E.M., Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pink, Neil Diamond, Tina Turner, and Rod Stewart, among others.

In March 2005, around 8,000 Christians attended a gathering at the stadium, the largest act of Christian worship in Suffolk since Billy Graham, an American evangelist, used Portman Road on part of his &quot;Mission England Tour&quot; in 1984.

==Records==

The highest attendance recorded at Portman Road is 38,010 for a match against Leeds United in the FA Cup sixth round on 8 March 1975. The record modern (all-seated) attendance is 30,152, set on 21 December 2003 against local rivals Norwich City in Football League Division One. The largest crowd for a non-competitive game at the ground was over 23,000 for Bobby Robson&#x27;s testimonial where Ipswich, including George Best, played against an England XI.

The highest seasonal average at the stadium since Ipswich turned professional was 26,431 in the 1976–77 season while Ipswich were playing in the First Division. The lowest average attendance at Portman Road was 8,741 in the club&#x27;s inaugural league season, the 1936–37 season in the Southern League. The highest total seasonal attendance was recorded during the 1980–81 season when the aggregate was more than 814,000 during a season in which Ipswich won the UEFA Cup Final and finished second in the First Division.

Portman Road hosted Ipswich Town&#x27;s first appearance in European football competition when they defeated Floriana of Malta 10–0, still a club record, in the European Cup in 1962. Since then, Ipswich Town remain undefeated at Portman Road in all European competitions, a total of 31 matches spanning 40 years, a record until it was surpassed by AZ Alkmaar in December 2007.

==Transport==
The stadium is approximately from Ipswich railway station, which lies on the Great Eastern Main Line from London Liverpool Street to Norwich. The stadium has parking nearby for supporters, and the streets around the ground are subject to a residents-only permit parking scheme, but there are several pay and display or park and ride car parks within a short distance of the ground.

<doc id="1338683" wikidata="Q2524691" url="?curid=1338683" title="Corecursion">
<text>In computer science, corecursion is a type of operation that is dual to recursion. Whereas recursion works analytically, starting on data further from a base case and breaking it down into smaller data and repeating until one reaches a base case, corecursion works synthetically, starting from a base case and building it up, iteratively producing data further removed from a base case. Put simply, corecursive algorithms use the data that they themselves produce, bit by bit, as they become available, and needed, to produce further bits of data. A similar but distinct concept is &quot;generative recursion&quot;, which may lack a definite &quot;direction&quot; inherent in corecursion and recursion.

Where recursion allows programs to operate on arbitrarily complex data, so long as they can be reduced to simple data (base cases), corecursion allows programs to produce arbitrarily complex and potentially infinite data structures, such as streams, so long as it can be produced from simple data (base cases) in a sequence of &quot;finite&quot; steps. Where recursion may not terminate, never reaching a base state, corecursion starts from a base state, and thus produces subsequent steps deterministically, though it may proceed indefinitely (and thus not terminate under strict evaluation), or it may consume more than it produces and thus become non-&quot;productive&quot;. Many functions that are traditionally analyzed as recursive can alternatively, and arguably more naturally, be interpreted as corecursive functions that are terminated at a given stage, for example recurrence relations such as the factorial.

Corecursion can produce both finite and infinite data structures as results, and may employ self-referential data structures. Corecursion is often used in conjunction with lazy evaluation, to produce only a finite subset of a potentially infinite structure (rather than trying to produce an entire infinite structure at once). Corecursion is a particularly important concept in functional programming, where corecursion and codata allow total languages to work with infinite data structures.

== Examples ==
Corecursion can be understood by contrast with recursion, which is more familiar. While corecursion is primarily of interest in functional programming, it can be illustrated using imperative programming, which is done below using the generator facility in Python. In these examples local variables are used, and assigned values imperatively (destructively), though these are not necessary in corecursion in pure functional programming. In pure functional programming, rather than assigning to local variables, these computed values form an invariable sequence, and prior values are accessed by self-reference (later values in the sequence reference earlier values in the sequence to be computed). The assignments simply express this in the imperative paradigm and explicitly specify where the computations happen, which serves to clarify the exposition.

=== Factorial ===
A classic example of recursion is computing the factorial, which is defined recursively by &quot;0! := 1&quot; and &quot;n! := n × (n - 1)!&quot;.

To &quot;recursively&quot; compute its result on a given input, a recursive function calls (a copy of) &quot;itself&quot; with a different (&quot;smaller&quot; in some way) input and uses the result of this call to construct its result. The recursive call does the same, unless the &quot;base case&quot; has been reached. Thus a call stack develops in the process. For example, to compute &quot;fac(3)&quot;, this recursively calls in turn &quot;fac(2)&quot;, &quot;fac(1)&quot;, &quot;fac(0)&quot; (&quot;winding up&quot; the stack), at which point recursion terminates with &quot;fac(0) = 1&quot;, and then the stack unwinds in reverse order and the results are calculated on the way back along the call stack to the initial call frame &quot;fac(3)&quot; that uses the result of &quot;fac(2) = 2&quot; to calculate the final result as &quot;3 × 2 = 3 × fac(2) =: fac(3)&quot; and finally return &quot;fac(3) = 6&quot;. In this example a function returns a single value.

This stack unwinding can be explicated, defining the factorial &quot;corecursively&quot;, as an iterator, where one &quot;starts&quot; with the case of formula_1, then from this starting value constructs factorial values for increasing numbers &quot;1, 2, 3...&quot; as in the above recursive definition with &quot;time arrow&quot; reversed, as it were, by reading it &quot;backwards&quot; as The corecursive algorithm thus defined produces a &quot;stream&quot; of &quot;all&quot; factorials. This may be concretely implemented as a generator. Symbolically, noting that computing next factorial value requires keeping track of both &quot;n&quot; and &quot;f&quot; (a previous factorial value), this can be represented as:
:formula_2
or in Haskell, 

 (\(n,f) -&gt; (n+1, f*(n+1))) `iterate` (0,1)

meaning, &quot;starting from formula_3, on each step the next values are calculated as formula_4&quot;. This is mathematically equivalent and almost identical to the recursive definition, but the formula_5 emphasizes that the factorial values are being built &quot;up&quot;, going forwards from the starting case, rather than being computed after first going backwards, &quot;down&quot; to the base case, with a formula_6 decrement. The direct output of the corecursive function does not simply contain the factorial formula_7 values, but also includes for each value the auxiliary data of its index &quot;n&quot; in the sequence, so that any one specific result can be selected among them all, as and when needed.

There is a connection with denotational semantics, where the denotations of recursive programs is built up corecursively in this way.

In Python, a recursive factorial function can be defined as:

def factorial(n: int) -&gt; int:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Recursive factorial function.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 if n == 0:
 return 1
 else:
 return n * factorial(n - 1)

This could then be called for example as codice_1 to compute &quot;5!&quot;.

A corresponding corecursive generator can be defined as:

def factorials():
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Corecursive generator.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 n, f = 0, 1
 while True:
 yield f
 n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1)

This generates an infinite stream of factorials in order; a finite portion of it can be produced by:

def n_factorials(n: int):
 k, f = 0, 1
 while k &lt;= n:
 yield f
 k, f = k + 1, f * (k + 1)

This could then be called to produce the factorials up to &quot;5!&quot; via:

for f in n_factorials(5):
 print(f)

If we&#x27;re only interested in a certain factorial, just the last value can be taken, or we can fuse the production and the access into one function,

def nth_factorial(n: int):
 k, f = 0, 1
 while k &lt; n:
 k, f = k + 1, f * (k + 1)
 return f

As can be readily seen here, this is practically equivalent (just by substituting codice_2 for the only codice_3 there) to the accumulator argument technique for tail recursion, unwound into an explicit loop. Thus it can be said that the concept of corecursion is an explication of the embodiment of iterative computation processes by recursive definitions, where applicable.

=== Fibonacci sequence ===
In the same way, the Fibonacci sequence can be represented as:
:formula_8
Because the Fibonacci sequence is a recurrence relation of order 2, the corecursive relation must track two successive terms, with the formula_9 corresponding to shift forward by one step, and the formula_10 corresponding to computing the next term. This can then be implemented as follows (using parallel assignment):

def fibonacci_sequence():
 a, b = 0, 1
 while True:
 yield a
 a, b = b, a + b

In Haskell, map fst ( (\(a,b) -&gt; (b,a+b)) `iterate` (0,1) )

=== Tree traversal ===
Tree traversal via a depth-first approach is a classic example of recursion. Dually, breadth-first traversal can very naturally be implemented via corecursion.

Iteratively, one may traverse a tree by placing its root node in a data structure, then iterating with that data structure while it is non-empty, on each step removing the first node from it and placing the removed node&#x27;s &quot;child nodes&quot; back into that data structure. If the data structure is a stack (LIFO), this yields depth-first traversal, and if the data structure is a queue (FIFO), this yields breadth-first traversal:
:formula_11

:formula_12

:formula_13

Using recursion, a depth-first traversal of a tree is implemented simply as recursively traversing each of the root node&#x27;s child nodes in turn. Thus the second child subtree is not processed until the first child subtree is finished. The root node&#x27;s value is handled separately, whether before the first child is traversed (resulting in pre-order traversal), after the first is finished and before the second (in-order), or after the second child node is finished (post-order) assuming the tree is binary, for simplicity of exposition. The call stack (of the recursive traversal function invocations) corresponds to the stack that would be iterated over with the explicit LIFO structure manipulation mentioned above. Symbolically,
:formula_14
:formula_15

:formula_16

&quot;Recursion&quot; has two meanings here. First, the recursive invocations of the tree traversal functions formula_17. More pertinently, we need to contend with how the resulting &quot;list of values&quot; is built here. Recursive, bottom-up output creation will result in the right-to-left tree traversal. To have it actually performed in the intended left-to-right order the sequencing would need to be enforced by some extraneous means, or it would be automatically achieved if the output were to be built in the top-down fashion, i.e. &quot;corecursively&quot;.

A breadth-first traversal creating its output in the top-down order, corecursively, can be also implemented by starting at the root node, outputting its value, then breadth-first traversing the subtrees – i.e., passing on the &quot;whole list&quot; of subtrees to the next step (not a single subtree, as in the recursive approach) – at the next step outputting the values of all of their root nodes, then passing on &quot;their&quot; child subtrees, etc. In this case the generator function, indeed the output sequence itself, acts as the queue. As in the factorial example above, where the auxiliary information of the index (which step one was at, &quot;n&quot;) was pushed forward, in addition to the actual output of &quot;n&quot;!, in this case the auxiliary information of the remaining subtrees is pushed forward, in addition to the actual output. Symbolically,
:formula_18
meaning that at each step, one outputs the list of values in this level&#x27;s nodes, then proceeds to the next level&#x27;s nodes. Generating just the node values from this sequence simply requires discarding the auxiliary child tree data, then flattening the list of lists (values are initially grouped by level (depth); flattening (ungrouping) yields a flat linear list). This is extensionally equivalent to the formula_19 specification above. In Haskell, 
 concatMap fst ( (\(v, ts) -&gt; (rootValues ts, childTrees ts)) `iterate` ([], [fullTree]) )

Notably, given an infinite tree, the corecursive breadth-first traversal will traverse all nodes, just as for a finite tree, while the recursive depth-first traversal will go down one branch and not traverse all nodes, and indeed if traversing post-order, as in this example (or in-order), it will visit no nodes at all, because it never reaches a leaf. This shows the usefulness of corecursion rather than recursion for dealing with infinite data structures. One caveat still remains for trees with the infinite branching factor, which need a more attentive interlacing to explore the space better. See dovetailing.

In Python, this can be implemented as follows.
The usual post-order depth-first traversal can be defined as:

def df(node):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Post-order depth-first traversal.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 if node is not None:
 df(node.left)
 df(node.right)
 print(node.value)

This can then be called by codice_4 to print the values of the nodes of the tree in post-order depth-first order.

The breadth-first corecursive generator can be defined as:

def bf(tree):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Breadth-first corecursive generator.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 tree_list = [tree]
 while tree_list:
 new_tree_list = []
 for tree in tree_list:
 if tree is not None:
 yield tree.value
 new_tree_list.append(tree.left)
 new_tree_list.append(tree.right)
 tree_list = new_tree_list

This can then be called to print the values of the nodes of the tree in breadth-first order:

for i in bf(t):
 print(i)
==Definition==

Initial data types can be defined as being the least fixpoint (up to isomorphism) of some type equation; the isomorphism is then given by an initial algebra. Dually, final (or terminal) data types can be defined as being the greatest fixpoint of a type equation; the isomorphism is then given by a final coalgebra.

If the domain of discourse is the category of sets and total functions, then final data types may contain infinite, non-wellfounded values, whereas initial types do not. On the other hand, if the domain of discourse is the category of complete partial orders and continuous functions, which corresponds roughly to the Haskell programming language, then final types coincide with initial types, and the corresponding final coalgebra and initial algebra form an isomorphism.

Corecursion is then a technique for recursively defining functions whose range (codomain) is a final data type, dual to the way that ordinary recursion recursively defines functions whose domain is an initial data type.

The discussion below provides several examples in Haskell that distinguish corecursion. Roughly speaking, if one were to port these definitions to the category of sets, they would still be corecursive. This informal usage is consistent with existing textbooks about Haskell. The examples used in this article predate the attempts to define corecursion and explain what it is.

==Discussion==

The rule for &quot;primitive corecursion&quot; on codata is the dual to that for primitive recursion on data. Instead of descending on the argument by pattern-matching on its constructors (that &quot;were called up before&quot;, somewhere, so we receive a ready-made datum and get at its constituent sub-parts, i.e. &quot;fields&quot;), we ascend on the result by filling-in its &quot;destructors&quot; (or &quot;observers&quot;, that &quot;will be called afterwards&quot;, somewhere - so we&#x27;re actually calling a constructor, creating another bit of the result to be observed later on). Thus corecursion &quot;creates&quot; (potentially infinite) codata, whereas ordinary recursion &quot;analyses&quot; (necessarily finite) data. Ordinary recursion might not be applicable to the codata because it might not terminate. Conversely, corecursion is not strictly necessary if the result type is data, because data must be finite.

In &quot;Programming with streams in Coq: a case study: the Sieve of Eratosthenes&quot; we find

hd (conc a s) = a 
tl (conc a s) = s

(sieve p s) = if div p (hd s) then sieve p (tl s)
 else conc (hd s) (sieve p (tl s))

hd (primes s) = (hd s) 
tl (primes s) = primes (sieve (hd s) (tl s))

where primes &quot;are obtained by applying the primes operation to the stream (Enu 2)&quot;. Following the above notation, the sequence of primes (with a throwaway 0 prefixed to it) and numbers streams being progressively sieved, can be represented as 
:formula_20
or in Haskell, 

(\(p, s@(h:t)) -&gt; (h, sieve h t)) `iterate` (0, [2..])

The authors discuss how the definition of codice_5 is not guaranteed always to be &quot;productive&quot;, and could become stuck e.g. if called with codice_6 as the initial stream.

Here is another example in Haskell. The following definition produces the list of Fibonacci numbers in linear time:

fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
This infinite list depends on lazy evaluation; elements are computed on an as-needed basis, and only finite prefixes are ever explicitly represented in memory. This feature allows algorithms on parts of codata to terminate; such techniques are an important part of Haskell programming.

This can be done in Python as well:

»&gt; from itertools import tee, chain, islice
»&gt; def fibonacci():
... def deferred_output():
... yield from output
... result, c1, c2 = tee(deferred_output(), 3)
... paired = (x + y for x, y in zip(c1, islice(c2, 1, None)))
... output = chain([0, 1], paired)
... return result
»&gt; print(*islice(fibonacci(), 20), sep=&#x27;, &#x27;)
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181
The definition of codice_7 can be inlined, leading to this:
fibs = 0 : 1 : next fibs
 where
 next (a: t@(b:_)) = (a+b):next t
This example employs a self-referential &quot;data structure&quot;. Ordinary recursion makes use of self-referential &quot;functions&quot;, but does not accommodate self-referential data. However, this is not essential to the Fibonacci example. It can be rewritten as follows:
fibs = fibgen (0,1)
fibgen (x,y) = x : fibgen (y,x+y) 
This employs only self-referential &quot;function&quot; to construct the result. If it were used with strict list constructor it would be an example of runaway recursion, but with non-strict list constructor this guarded recursion gradually produces an indefinitely defined list.

Corecursion need not produce an infinite object; a corecursive queue is a particularly good example of this phenomenon. The following definition produces a breadth-first traversal of a binary tree in the &quot;top-down&quot; manner, in linear time (already incorporating the flattening mentioned above):
data Tree a b = Leaf a
 | Branch b (Tree a b) (Tree a b)

bftrav :: Tree a b -&gt; [Tree a b]
bftrav tree = tree : ts
 where
 ts = gen 1 (tree : ts)

 gen 0 p = [] 
 gen len (Leaf _ : p) = gen (len-1) p
 gen len (Branch _ l r : p) = l : r : gen (len+1) p
 -- ----read---- ----write-ahead---

-- bfvalues tree = [v | (Branch v _ _) &lt;- bftrav tree]
This definition takes a tree and produces a list of its sub-trees (nodes and leaves). This list serves dual purpose as both the input queue and the result ( produces its output notches ahead of its input back-pointer, , along the list). It is finite if and only if the initial tree is finite. The length of the queue must be explicitly tracked in order to ensure termination; this can safely be elided if this definition is applied only to infinite trees. 

This Haskell code uses self-referential data structure, but does not &quot;essentially&quot; depend on lazy evaluation. It can be straightforwardly translated into e.g. Prolog which is not a lazy language. What &quot;is&quot; essential is the ability to build a list (used as the queue) in the &quot;top-down&quot; manner. For that, Prolog has tail recursion modulo cons (i.e. open ended lists). Which is also emulatable in Scheme, C, etc. using linked lists with mutable tail sentinel pointer:
bftrav( Tree, [Tree|TS]) :- bfgen( 1, [Tree|TS], TS).

bfgen( 0, _, []) :- !. % 0 entries in the queue -- stop and close the list
bfgen( N, [leaf(_) |P], TS ) :- N2 is N-1, bfgen( N2, P, TS).
bfgen( N, [branch(_,L,R)|P], [L,R|TS]) :- N2 is N+1, bfgen( N2, P, TS).
%% ----read----- --write-ahead--
Another particular example gives a solution to the problem of breadth-first labeling. The function codice_8 visits every node in a binary tree in the breadth first fashion, replacing each label with an integer, each subsequent integer bigger than the last by 1. This solution employs a self-referential data structure, and the binary tree can be finite or infinite.
label :: Tree a b -&gt; Tree Int Int 
label t = tn
 where
 (tn, ns) = go t (1:ns)

 go :: Tree a b -&gt; [Int] -&gt; (Tree Int Int, [Int])
 go (Leaf _ ) (i:a) = (Leaf i , i+1:a)
 go (Branch _ l r) (i:a) = (Branch i ln rn, i+1:c)
 where
 (ln, b) = go l a
 (rn, c) = go r b

Or in Prolog, for comparison,

label( Tree, Tn) :- label( Tree, [1|Ns], Tn, Ns).

label( leaf(_), [I|A], leaf( I), [I+1|A]).
label( branch(_,L,R),[I|A], branch(I,Ln,Rn),[I+1|C]) :-
 label( L, A, Ln, B), 
 label( R, B, Rn, C).
An apomorphism (such as an anamorphism, such as unfold) is a form of corecursion in the same way that a paramorphism (such as a catamorphism, such as fold) is a form of recursion.

The Coq proof assistant supports corecursion and coinduction using the CoFixpoint command.

== History ==
Corecursion, referred to as &quot;circular programming,&quot; dates at least to , who credits John Hughes and Philip Wadler; more general forms were developed in . The original motivations included producing more efficient algorithms (allowing a single pass over data in some cases, instead of requiring multiple passes) and implementing classical data structures, such as doubly linked lists and queues, in functional languages.

<doc id="1338702" wikidata="Q3416096" url="?curid=1338702" title="The Big Fat Quiz of the Year">
<text>The Big Fat Quiz of the Year is an approximately annual British television programme broadcast in the last or first week of the year on Channel 4. The show is a comedy panel game in the style of a pub quiz. Three teams of two celebrities, mostly comedians, are asked questions about the year gone by in various categories, writing answers on an electronic board in front of them. At the end of each round the answers are displayed and points awarded.

The first edition was broadcast in December 2004. There has been another at around the end of each year, as well as a special edition in November 2007 for Channel 4&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebrations and three themed special editions in September 2012, to celebrate Channel 4&#x27;s first three decades. A second set of &#x27;decades&#x27; editions screened in September 2013 as well as a 10th-anniversary special in January 2015; and a &quot;Big Fat Quiz of Everything&quot; in January 2016, followed by a series of three episodes in August 2016. Repeats can usually be found days later on Channel 4&#x27;s sister channel E4 and/or 4seven. Stand-up comedian Jimmy Carr has been the host and quizmaster of each edition to date. Channel 4 has made full episodes of &quot;The Big Fat Quiz of the Year&quot; available to view on All 4.

==&quot;The Big Fat Quiz of the Year&quot;==
===2004===
The first &quot;Big Fat Quiz&quot; was broadcast on 27 December 2004. Louis Walsh, Nadia Almada and Dame Kelly Holmes all made live appearances to read out the answers for the months of March, June and August respectively. Recorded questions from Bono, Derren Brown and The Bear from &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot; were shown too along with films of Richard and Judy discussing events. The children of Mitchell Brook Primary School in Neasden acted out news stories that happened throughout the year, such as Ricky Gervais winning two Golden Globe Awards for &quot;The Office&quot; and the Momart fire.

===2005===

Guest questioners in the studio included Jordan &amp; Peter Andre and David Tennant. There were also recorded questions by several celebrities including Richard and Judy, Charlotte Church, Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette, Derren Brown and Kevin Pietersen. The mystery guests were Walter Wolfgang and a woman genuinely named Sue Doku. This year&#x27;s quiz saw the debut of Jon Snow giving fake news stories based on song lyrics, with &quot;I Predict A Riot&quot; and &quot;Crazy Chick&quot;. The children of Mitchell Brook Primary School acted out the birth of David and Victoria Beckham&#x27;s third child and Jacques Chirac insulting British food on the eve of the G8 Summit.

===2006===
In 2006, the show was broadcast on 27 December. Guest questioners in the studio included Boy George, Myleene Klass and Matt Willis. The mystery guest was Guy Goma, famous for mistakenly appearing as a guest on BBC News 24. Pre-recorded questions were asked by Lily Allen, Carol Vorderman, Courtney Love, Girls Aloud, and Sacha Baron Cohen (in character as Borat). Channel 4 News reporter Jon Snow returned to give fake news reports about songs of the year, reporting on &quot;Patience&quot; and &quot;America&quot;. The children of Mitchell Brook Primary School acted out The Da Vinci Code plagiarism claim and parents rebelling against Jamie Oliver&#x27;s school dinners campaign. Ian McKellen gave dramatized readings from the autobiographies of Jade Goody and Kerry Katona.

Russell Brand and Noel Fielding spent much of the show giving deliberately wrong – and surreal – answers, leaving them trailing far behind the other two teams. This was until towards the end when Jimmy Carr bowed to the pressure of the studio audience and gave them 22 points for answering one question correctly, which was the amount needed to bring them back into contention at the time and ensuring that they subsequently won the quiz. This led Walliams and Brydon, who came last as a result, to exaggerate their chagrin at the turn of events that had seen Brand and Fielding emerge on top.

During a discussion about the Bob Skeleton event at that year&#x27;s Winter Olympics, the suggestion arose that a character with that name could be the star of Brand and Fielding&#x27;s next show together. The pair subsequently became known as the &quot;Goth Detectives&quot; (opposed to their original name, which arose from a joke Jimmy Carr made about their supposed parentage), which was suggested for the show&#x27;s title. Though it began as a joke, the pair eventually performed a &quot;Goth Detectives&quot; sketch for the Teenage Cancer Trust event at the Royal Albert Hall on 28 March 2007.

===2007===
The 2007 show aired on 30 December 2007. Guest questioners in the studio were Christopher Biggins, Cerys Matthews and John Smeaton, a baggage handler at Glasgow Airport who helped foil a terrorist attack. Pre-recorded questions were asked by Take That, Gordon Ramsay and Thom Yorke. Jon Snow returned with a faux news report on &quot;Umbrella&quot;. John Hurt read out extracts from the autobiographies of Peter Andre and 50 Cent. The children of Mitchell Brook Primary School returned to act out David Beckham&#x27;s move to LA Galaxy and when a judge criticised &quot;The Jeremy Kyle Show&quot;. Paul Croft, the man who had a tattoo of Dumbledore done on his back before J.K. Rowling announced that Dumbledore was gay, was the mystery guest.

This was the first time that Rob Brydon had been on the winning team, despite having appeared on the panel every year since the first show in 2004. Also, it was the first time (and, as of the 2018 edition, the only time) that the previous year&#x27;s winning team – the Goth Detectives – had both returned to try to defend their title.

===2008===
&quot;The Big Fat Quiz of the Year 2008&quot; aired on 28 December on Channel 4 at 9:00 pm.

Due to the furore caused by his and Russell Brand&#x27;s infamous phone call to actor Andrew Sachs, which resulted in his three-month suspension from the BBC at the end of the year, this was the first occasion that Jonathan Ross did not appear. He also declined his customary executive producer credit. Despite &quot;Big Fat Quiz&quot; not being a BBC programme, Ross himself had thought it inappropriate to do any broadcasting work during the corporation&#x27;s censure (the same reason that was given for his decision to temporarily concede hosting duties of the British Comedy Awards – broadcast on ITV – around the same time).

This was also the first year that Rob Brydon was absent, leaving host Jimmy Carr as the only regular fixture throughout the &quot;Big Fat Quiz of the Year&quot;″s entire run to date (although neither Brydon nor Ross had been panellists for the special Channel 4 anniversary edition).

In-studio guest questions came from &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; contestants Jodie Kidd and Mark Foster, and 2008 Olympics Team GB gold medalists Christine Ohuruogu and James DeGale. Pre-recorded guest questions came from Katy Perry, the Fonejacker, Alan Carr, Sarah Silverman and Sir Alan Sugar. Jon Snow gave news reports on &quot;That&#x27;s Not My Name&quot; and &quot;I Kissed A Girl&quot;. John Hurt read from the autobiographies of Les Dennis and Christopher Biggins. The children from Mitchell Brook Primary School also returned acting out the divorce of Paul McCartney and Heather Mills and Jay-Z headlining that year&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival.

===2009===
The 2009 show was recorded on 7 December and aired on 1 January 2010.

Peter Andre appeared in-studio as a guest questioner. Newsreader Jon Snow again appeared with news reports on &quot;Poker Face&quot; and &quot;Bonkers&quot; and the children of Mitchell Brook Primary School also reprised their regular slot, acting out the Parliament expenses scandal and Kanye West invading the stage at the MTV Video Music Awards. Pre-recorded guest questions came from Tim Minchin (asking a question in song about Google Street View), Sir David Attenborough, Stuart Broad, David Tennant and 50 Cent. Swansea cagefighters Daniel Lerwell and James Lilley, who successfully fended off a homophobic attack in a nightclub when they were dressed in drag for a stag night, were the mystery guests.

Ross and Brand made a number of references to the Sachsgate scandal of 2008 which occurred last time they appeared together. There was also a discussion about changing Brooker and Mitchell&#x27;s team name to &quot;The Curmudgeons&quot; after they refused to dance to the Lady Gaga song &quot;Poker Face&quot;.

Mitchell and Brooker were the eventual winners and were asked by Jimmy Carr after their victory if they wanted to do a dance. Despite pressure from the audience, they kept up their premise of not dancing.

===2010===
The 2010 show was recorded on 13 December and aired on 3 January 2011.

Guest questions were provided by Nicole Scherzinger, Jack Black, Simon Pegg, Russell Brand, Seth Rogen, the cast of &quot;Misfits&quot; and Will Ferrell. The children of Mitchell Brook Primary School made their annual appearance acting out news stories, which included The Stig scandal and the Icelandic volcano eruption, as did Jon Snow with his fake news report of Lady Gaga and Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Telephone&quot;. Lola, the cat put in a wheelie bin in August by Mary Bale appeared as a mystery guest. Louie Spence posed a question in the form of a dance routine representing the story of the trapped Chilean miners.

Ross and Jones&#x27; team name &quot;Wagner&quot; was in reference to Wagner Fiuza-Carillho, known mononymously as Wagner, who had appeared in series 7 of &quot;The X Factor&quot; that year and had progressed to the quarter final as part of the Over 28s category mentored by Louis Walsh.

===2011===
The 2011 show was recorded on 14 December and aired on 27 December 2011.

Guest questions were provided by Cee Lo Green, Michael Sheen, Tulisa, Lee Evans, Muppet drummer Animal, Rastamouse, &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; star Jim Carter, Lenny Kravitz, and Professor Brian Cox. The children of Mitchell Brook Primary School acted out the arrival of Larry the Cat at 10 Downing Street and Cheryl Cole&#x27;s firing from &quot;The X Factor&quot;, and Jon Snow gave his news reports on Rebecca Black&#x27;s &quot;Friday&quot; and Jessie J&#x27;s &quot;Price Tag&quot;. &quot;Supergran&quot; Ann Timson, who was seen in a February 2011 viral video fending off four burglars with just her handbag, appeared as a mystery guest. &quot;The Only Way Is Essex&quot; cast members Lydia Rose Bright, Lauren Goodger, and Kirk Norcross appeared to present a question about the show.

Hart and Walliams hold the record for first team to not reach double digits and the lowest score of any team in the show&#x27;s run.

David Mitchell and Eddie Izzard were that year&#x27;s winners.

===2012===
The 2012 edition aired on 30 December 2012. The teams did not take team names. 
The in-studio final bonus questions were provided by Team GB and Paralympics GB athletes Nicola Adams, Natasha Baker, Sophie Christiansen, Hannah Cockroft, Helen Glover, Ed McKeever, Etienne Stott, and Peter Wilson. &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot; finalists Brendan Lynch, James Morton, and John Whaite provided a live guest question. Recorded guest questions were provided by PSY, Gerard Butler, Usain Bolt, Jessica Ennis, Felix Baumgartner, Kylie Minogue, Cheryl Cole, Simon Callow, Jenson Button, Tom Daley, Warwick Davis, and Charles Dance (doing a dramatic reading from &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;). The children of Mitchell Brook Primary School once again made an appearance acting out the Diamond Jubilee Concert. Providing the song lyric as news story segment was Jon Snow, reporting on &quot;Call Me Maybe&quot;. The mystery guest was Gary Connery, the stunt-double for the Queen, who skydived out of a helicopter during the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.

During the show, Whitehall and Corden had pizza delivered and ate it with red wine.

===2013===
The 2013 edition was recorded on 10 December and aired on 26 December 2013. The teams did not take team names.

Danny Dyer appeared in the studio to provide a live guest question. Pre-recorded guest questions were provided by Russell Brand, &quot;Anchorman 2&quot; stars Steve Carell, Will Ferrell, and Paul Rudd; Olly Murs, Christine Ohuruogu, Louis Walsh, Richard Osman, The Great Gonzo (promoting &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot;), Harry Hill, and Sophie Ellis-Bextor, &quot;Educating Yorkshire&quot; teachers Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Burton, &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot; series 4 runner-up Ruby Tandoh, Rizzle Kicks, and astronaut Chris Hadfield. The children of Mitchell Brook Primary School returned to act out Edward Snowden&#x27;s spy leaks. Jon Snow reported on &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; and Charles Dance read from the autobiography of Lauren Goodger. The mystery guest was Natalie Holt, who threw eggs at Simon Cowell on the final of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

The show was dedicated to comedy agent and producer Addison Cresswell, who died on 22 December 2013.

Jonathan Ross brought most of a turkey, a loaf of bread and champagne. He ended up making sandwiches for the others.

===2014===
The 2014 edition was recorded on 1 December and aired on 26 December 2014.

Pre-recorded guest questions came from Michael Palin, Tom Daley, the cast of &quot;The Inbetweeners&quot;, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; actress Natalie Dormer, Lily Allen, Rio Ferdinand, Pixie Lott and Status Quo members Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt. Paralympic gold medallists Kelly Gallagher and Charlotte Evans provided the in-studio guest question. Charles Dance read from the autobiography of Joey Essex. The children of Mitchell Brook Primary School acted out the Bernie Ecclestone trial. Jon Snow gave his news report about &quot;All About That Bass&quot;. The mystery guest was Dean Farley, the jogger who ran into David Cameron.

Mel B&#x27;s performance received notable negative attention on social media and in the press as having brought down the show by being perceived as sour and humorless.

===2015===
The 2015 edition was recorded on 14 December 2015 and aired on 26 December 2015. The teams did not take names.

Pre-recorded guest questions came from Quentin Tarantino, Rita Ora, Simon Pegg, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, Josh Groban, Olly Murs, Katie Price and Heston Blumenthal. &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot; winner, Nadiya Hussain, provided the in-studio guest question. The children of Mitchell Brook Primary School acted out Jeremy Clarkson&#x27;s dismissal from &quot;Top Gear&quot;. Jon Snow reported on Drake&#x27;s &quot;Hotline Bling&quot;. Charles Dance read from &quot;List of the Lost&quot;, the debut novel by Morrissey.

<text>Oliver Plunkett (or Oliver Plunket; ; 1 November 1625 – 1 July 1681) was the Catholic Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland and the last victim of the Popish Plot. He was beatified in 1920 and canonised in 1975, thus becoming the first new Irish saint in almost seven hundred years.

==Biography==
Oliver Plunkett was born on 1 November 1625 (earlier biographers gave his date of birth as 1 November 1629, but 1625 has been the consensus since the 1930s) in Loughcrew, County Meath, Ireland, to well-to-do parents with Hiberno-Norman ancestors. A grandson of James Plunkett, 7th Baron Killeen (died 1595), he was related by birth to a number of landed families, such as the recently ennobled Earls of Roscommon, as well as the long-established Earls of Fingall, Lords Louth, and Lords Dunsany. Until his sixteenth year, the boy&#x27;s education was entrusted to his cousin Patrick Plunkett, Abbot of St Mary&#x27;s, Dublin and brother of Luke Plunkett, the first Earl of Fingall, who later became successively Bishop of Ardagh and of Meath. As an aspirant to the priesthood, he set out for Rome in 1647, under the care of Father Pierfrancesco Scarampi of the Roman Oratory. At this time the Irish Confederate Wars were raging in Ireland; these were essentially conflicts between native Irish Catholics, English and Irish Anglicans and Nonconformists. Scarampi was the Papal envoy to the Catholic movement known as the Confederation of Ireland. Many of Plunkett&#x27;s relatives were involved in this organisation.

He was admitted to the Irish College in Rome and proved to be an able pupil. He was ordained a priest in 1654, and deputed by the Irish bishops to act as their representative in Rome. Meanwhile, the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649–53) had defeated the Catholic cause in Ireland; in the aftermath, the public practice of Catholicism was banned and Catholic clergy were executed. As a result, it was impossible for Plunkett to return to Ireland for many years. He petitioned to remain in Rome and, in 1657, became a professor of theology. Throughout the period of the Commonwealth and the first years of Charles II&#x27;s reign, he successfully pleaded the cause of the Irish Catholic Church, and also served as theological professor at the College of Propaganda Fide. At the Congregation of Propaganda Fide on 9 July 1669 he was appointed Archbishop of Armagh, the Irish primatial see, and was consecrated on 30 November at Ghent by the Bishop of Ghent, Eugeen-Albert, count d&#x27;Allamont. He eventually set foot on Irish soil again on 7 March 1670, as the English Restoration of 1660 had begun on a basis of toleration. The pallium was granted him in the Consistory of 28 July 1670.

After arriving back in Ireland, he tackled drunkenness among the clergy, writing: &quot;Let us remove this defect from an Irish priest, and he will be a saint&quot;. The Penal Laws had been relaxed in line with the Declaration of Breda in 1660 and he was able to establish a Jesuit College in Drogheda in 1670. A year later 150 students attended the college, no fewer than 40 of whom were Protestant, making this college the first integrated school in Ireland. His ministry was a successful one and he is said to have confirmed 48,000 Catholics over a four-year period. The government in Dublin, especially under the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Duke of Ormonde (the Protestant son of Catholic parents) extended a generous measure of toleration to the Catholic hierarchy until the mid-1670s.

==Popish Plot==
On the enactment of the Stuart Restoration penal laws known as the Test Act in 1673, to which Plunkett would not agree for doctrinal reasons, the college was closed and demolished. Plunkett went into hiding, travelling only in disguise, and refused a government edict to register at a seaport to await passage into exile. For the next few years he was largely left in peace since the Dublin government, except when put under pressure from the English government in London, preferred to leave the Catholic bishops alone.

In 1678 the so-called Popish Plot, concocted in England by clergyman Titus Oates, led to further anti-Catholic action. Archbishop Peter Talbot of Dublin was arrested, and Plunkett again went into hiding. The Privy Council of England, in Westminster, was told that Plunkett had plotted a French invasion. The moving spirit behind the campaign is said to have been Arthur Capell, the first Earl of Essex, who had been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1672-77 and hoped to resume the office by discrediting the Duke of Ormonde. However Capell was not normally a ruthless or unprincipled man, and his later plea for mercy suggests that he had never intended that Plunkett should actually die.

===Trial===
Despite being on the run and with a price on his head, Plunkett refused to leave his flock. At some point before his final incarceration, he took refuge in a church that once stood in the townland of Killartry, in the parish of Clogherhead in County Louth, seven miles outside Drogheda. He was arrested in Dublin on 6 December 1679 and imprisoned in Dublin Castle, where he gave absolution to the dying Talbot. Plunkett was tried at Dundalk for conspiring against the state by allegedly plotting to bring 20,000 French soldiers into the country, and for levying a tax on his clergy to support 70,000 men for rebellion. Though this was unproven, some in government circles were worried about the possibility that a repetition of the Irish rebellion of 1641 was being planned and in any case, this was a convenient excuse for proceeding against Plunkett. The Duke of Ormonde, aware that Lord Essex was using the crisis to undermine him, did not defend Plunkett in public. In private however, he made clear his belief in Plunkett&#x27;s innocence and his contempt for the informers against him: &quot;silly drunken vagabonds... whom no schoolboy would trust to rob an orchard&quot;.

Plunkett did not object to facing an all-Protestant jury, but the trial soon collapsed as the prosecution witnesses were themselves wanted men and afraid to turn up in court. Lord Shaftesbury knew Plunkett would never be convicted in Ireland, irrespective of the jury&#x27;s composition, and so had Plunkett moved to Newgate Prison in London in order to face trial at Westminster Hall. The first grand jury found no true bill, but he was not released. The second trial has generally been regarded as a serious miscarriage of justice; Plunkett was denied defending counsel (although Hugh Reily acted as his legal advisor) and time to assemble his defence witnesses, and he was also frustrated in his attempts to obtain the criminal records of those who were to give evidence against him. His servant James McKenna, and a relative, John Plunkett, had travelled back to Ireland and failed within the time available to bring back witnesses and evidence for the defence. During the trial, Archbishop Plunkett had disputed the right of the court to try him in England and he also drew attention to the criminal past of the witnesses, but to no avail. Lord Chief Justice Sir Francis Pemberton addressing these complaints said to Plunkett: &quot;Look you, Mr. Plunkett, it is in vain for you to talk and make this discourse here now...&quot; and later on again: &quot;Look you, Mr. Plunkett, don&#x27;t mis-spend your own time; for the more you trifle in these things, the less time you will have for your defence&quot;.

The Scottish clergyman and future Bishop of Salisbury, Gilbert Burnet, an eyewitness to the Plot trials, had no doubt of the innocence of Plunkett, whom he praised as a wise and sober man who wished only to live peacefully and tend to his congregation. Writing in the 19th century, Lord Campbell said of the judge, Pemberton, that the trial was a disgrace to himself and his country. More recently the High Court judge Sir James Comyn called it a grave mistake: while Plunkett, by virtue of his office, was clearly guilty of &quot;promoting the Catholic faith&quot;, and may possibly have had some dealings with the French, there was never the slightest evidence that he had conspired against the King&#x27;s life.

===Execution===

Archbishop Plunkett was found guilty of high treason in June 1681 &quot;for promoting the Roman faith&quot;, and was condemned to death. In passing judgement, the Chief Justice said: &quot;You have done as much as you could to dishonour God in this case; for the bottom of your treason was your setting up your false religion, than which there is not any thing more displeasing to God, or more pernicious to mankind in the world&quot;. The jury returned within fifteen minutes with a guilty verdict and Archbishop Plunkett replied: &quot;Deo Gratias&quot; (Latin for &quot;Thanks be to God&quot;).

Numerous pleas for mercy were made but Charles II, although himself a reputed crypto-Catholic, thought it too politically dangerous to spare Plunkett. The French ambassador to England, Paul Barillon, conveyed a plea for mercy from his king, Louis XIV. Charles told him frankly that he knew Plunkett to be innocent, but that the time was not right to take so bold a step as to pardon him. Lord Essex, apparently realising too late that his intrigues had led to the condemnation of an innocent man, made a similar plea for mercy. The King, normally the most self-controlled of men, turned on Lord Essex in fury, saying: &quot;his blood be on your head – you could have saved him but would not, I would save him and dare not&quot;.

Plunkett was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn on 1 July 1681 (11 July NS), aged 55, the last Catholic martyr to die in England. His body was initially buried in two tin boxes, next to five Jesuits who had died previously, in the courtyard of St Giles in the Fields church. The remains were exhumed in 1683 and moved to the Benedictine monastery at Lamspringe, near Hildesheim in Germany. The head was brought to Rome, and from there to Armagh, and eventually to Drogheda where since 29 June 1921 it has rested in Saint Peter&#x27;s Church. Most of the body was brought to Downside Abbey, England, where the major part is located today, with some parts remaining at Lamspringe. On the occasion of his canonization in 1975 his casket was opened and some parts of his body were given to St Peter&#x27;s Church in Drogheda Ireland and also to the new Worth Abbey Church consecrated 13 July 1975.
==Legacy==

Oliver Plunkett was beatified on 23 May 1920 by Pope Benedict XV. The cause for his canonization was opened on 27 July 1951, and he was canonized in 1975, the first new Irish saint for almost seven hundred years, and the first of the Irish martyrs to be beatified. For the canonisation, the customary second miracle was waived. He has since been followed by 17 other Irish martyrs who were beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1992. Among them were Archbishop Dermot O&#x27;Hurley, Margaret Ball, and the Wexford Martyrs.

In 1920 a mosaic of him at Westminster Cathedral, London, was created by Boris Anrep.

As a spectacle alone, a rally and Mass for St Oliver Plunkett on London&#x27;s Clapham Common was a remarkable triumph. The Common was virtually taken over for a celebration of the 300th anniversary of Plunkett&#x27;s martyrdom. Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiaich, twenty enrobed bishops and a number of abbots mounted a stage beneath a scaffolding shelter on 1 July 1981. Ó Fiaich had flown there in a helicopter with Plunkett&#x27;s head. The occasion attracted thousands of pilgrims to the park.

In 1997 Plunkett was made a patron saint for peace and reconciliation in Ireland, adopted by the prayer group campaigning for peace in Ireland, &quot;St. Oliver Plunkett for Peace and Reconciliation&quot;.

In 2023, a pastoral area of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton was named in honour of Plunkett.

<doc id="1338710" wikidata="Q3078036" url="?curid=1338710" title="Fort Saint-Frédéric">
<text>Fort Saint-Frédéric was a French fort built on Lake Champlain to secure the region against British colonization and control the lake. It was located in modern New York State across the lake from modern Vermont at the town of Crown Point, New York. The fort, whose construction began in 1734, was never attacked, and was destroyed in 1759 before the advance of a large (more than 10,000 man) British army under General Jeffery Amherst.

The British constructed the much larger Fort Crown Point next to the ruins of Saint-Frédéric; the new fort also never came under attack. Its small garrison was captured in 1775 in the early days of the American Revolutionary War, after which Fort Crown Point also fell into ruin. The fort sites at Crown Point were preserved in the Crown Point State Historic Site in 1910, and both ruins are National Historic Landmarks.

== History ==
Construction was started in 1734 by Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry. When complete, Fort Saint-Frédéric walls were twelve feet thick and four stories high, with cannons on each level. It was manned by hundreds of officers and troops, principally from Les Compagnies Franches de la Marine.

The fort gave the French control of the frontier between New France and the British colonies to the south. As the only permanent stronghold in the area until the building of Fort Carillon at Ticonderoga starting in 1755, many French raids originated there and it was a target of British operations in the French and Indian War. Constructed on the tip of a strategic peninsula at a narrows in the lake, the cannons of Fort Saint-Frédéric and the later British Fort Crown Point were capable of halting all north-south travel on the lake.

In 1759 when British forces moved against Fort Saint-Frédéric during the war, the retreating French destroyed it. The British Army and provincial militia then built Fort Crown Point, a vast fortification just southwest of the ruins of the French fort, starting in the fall of 1759. At the same time they built a fleet to gain military control of Lake Champlain and the 77-mile-long Crown Point Road across the Green Mountains to reach the Connecticut River.

Since 1910 the remains of both forts on the Crown Point peninsula are part of the Crown Point State Historic Site. Both are also U.S. National Historic Landmarks. Fort Saint-Frédéric was registered as a National Historic Landmark in 1962.

<text>The European, billed as &quot;Europe&#x27;s first national newspaper&quot;, was a British weekly newspaper founded by Robert Maxwell. It was published from 11 May 1990 until December 1998.

==History==
Maxwell founded the paper in the fervour which immediately followed the destruction of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the Iron Curtain. The name was a reflection of the feelings of pan-European unity which were brought on by the historic changes, an ideal which Maxwell wholeheartedly supported. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Maxwell originally envisaged a daily with a circulation of 650,000, but by the launch date plans had been cut down to a more realistic weekly with a circulation of 225,000. In the event, the circulation peaked at 180,000, over half of which was British.

According to British academic James Dennison, &#x27;Its first issue featured contributions from Margaret Thatcher, Wilfried Martens, Jacques Santer, Mário Soares and the President of the Bundesbank as well as polls showing majority support for a single currency (in the United Kingdom and others, but not Germany or Denmark), soft anti-Americanism, new pan-European Ecu-denominated financial indices and coverage of the disintegration of the eastern bloc.&#x27;

Following Maxwell&#x27;s death, the Barclay brothers bought the newspaper in 1992, investing an estimated $110 million and in 1996 transforming it into a high-end tabloid format oriented at the business community edited by Andrew Neil.

In 1996, &quot;The European&quot; had a staff of 70 in London, 3 in Brussels, 1 in Paris, 1 in Berlin, 1 in Moscow, as well as a network of 100 freelance writers throughout Europe.

Among the newspaper&#x27;s innovations was a weekly short fiction contribution from published and previously unpublished writers.

&quot;The New European&quot; (a pro-EU newspaper founded in 2016 following the Brexit referendum) is partially inspired by &quot;The European&quot; experience.

<doc id="1338721" wikidata="Q1009708" url="?curid=1338721" title="Bunny Lake Is Missing">
<text>Bunny Lake Is Missing is a 1965 psychological mystery film directed and produced by Otto Preminger and starring Carol Lynley, Keir Dullea and Laurence Olivier. Filmed in black-and-white widescreen format in London, it was based on the 1957 novel &quot;Bunny Lake Is Missing&quot; by Merriam Modell. The score is by Paul Glass. The rock band the Zombies also appear in the film.

==Plot==
American single mother Ann Lake, who recently moved to London from New York, arrives at the Little People&#x27;s Garden pre-school to collect her daughter, Bunny. The child has mysteriously disappeared. An administrator recalls meeting Ann but claims never to have seen the missing child. Ann and her brother Steven search the school and find a peculiar old woman living upstairs, who claims she collects children&#x27;s nightmares. In desperation, the Lakes call the police and Superintendent Newhouse arrives on the scene. Everyone becomes a suspect and Superintendent Newhouse is steadfast, diligently following every lead. The police and Newhouse decide to visit the Lakes&#x27; new residence.

They conclude that all of Bunny&#x27;s possessions have been removed from the Lakes&#x27; new home. Ann cannot understand why anyone would do this and reacts emotionally. Superintendent Newhouse begins to suspect that Bunny Lake does not exist, after he learns that &quot;Bunny&quot; was the name of Ann&#x27;s imaginary childhood friend. Ann&#x27;s landlord, an aging actor, attempts to seduce her. Steven argues with Newhouse, angrily tells him that he will hire a private detective to find Bunny, and storms off. Newhouse decides to become better acquainted with Ann to learn more about Bunny. He takes her to a local pub where he plies her with brandy and soda.

On her return home, Ann discovers she still has the claim ticket for Bunny&#x27;s doll, which was taken to a doll hospital for repairs. Regarding the doll as proof of Bunny&#x27;s existence, she frantically rushes to the doll hospital late at night and retrieves the doll. Steven arrives later and when Ann shows him the doll, Steven burns the doll, hoping to destroy it, then knocks Ann unconscious. He takes Ann to a hospital and tells the desk nurse that Ann has been hallucinating about a missing girl who does not exist. Ann is put under observation with instructions for her to be sedated if she awakes.

Ann wakes up in the hospital and escapes. She discovers that Steven is burying Bunny&#x27;s possessions in the garden, and had sedated the little girl, hiding her in the trunk of his Sunbeam Tiger car. Steven implies an incestuous interest with his sister, complaining that Bunny has always come between them. Believing that Ann loves Bunny more than him, the child threatens Steven&#x27;s dream of a future with his sister. Ann, realising her brother is insane, begins playing childhood games with Steven, in order to distract him from killing Bunny. Newhouse, having discovered that Steven lied to the police about the name of the ship that brought the Lakes to England, rushes quickly to the Lakes&#x27; residence, arriving in time to apprehend Steven, successfully rescuing Ann and Bunny.

==Cast==
In addition, Bunny Lake is played by Suky Appleby.

==Production==
===Development===
Preminger had found the novel&#x27;s denouement lacking in credibility, so he changed the identity of the would-be murderer. This prompted many rewrites from his British husband-and-wife scriptwriters John Mortimer and Penelope Mortimer before Preminger was satisfied. 

===Filming===
Adapting the original novel, Preminger moved the story from New York to London, where he liked working. His dark, sinister vision of London made use of many real locations: the Barry Elder Doll Museum in Hammersmith stood in for the dolls&#x27; hospital; the Little People&#x27;s Garden School used school buildings in Hampstead; and the &quot;Frogmore End&quot; house was Cannon Hall, which had belonged to novelist Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s father Sir Gerald du Maurier. The 1965 Sunbeam Tiger sports car (registration EDU 296C) featured in this film still exists as a classic car, and sold at auction for £35,840 (2015).

===Post-production===
The opening title sequences and poster were done by graphic designer Saul Bass.

English rock band the Zombies are featured in the credits and on the film&#x27;s poster for their contribution of three songs to the film&#x27;s soundtrack: &quot;Remember You&quot;, &quot;Just Out of Reach&quot; and &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Changed&quot;. The band is featured performing on a television in the pub where Superintendent Newhouse meets with Ann, and &quot;Just Out of Reach&quot; plays on a janitor&#x27;s radio as Ann escapes from the hospital. With Preminger present in the studio, the band recorded a two-minute radio ad set to the tune of &quot;Just Out of Reach&quot; that promoted the film&#x27;s release and urged audiences to &quot;Come on time!&quot; in keeping with the film&#x27;s no-late-admissions policy. These efforts represent an early instance of what became the common Hollywood practice of promotional tie-ins with popular musical acts.

==Release==
===Promotion===
As with &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960), audiences were not admitted after the film&#x27;s start. This was not common practice at the time and was emphasised in the film&#x27;s promotion, including on the poster, which warned: &quot;No One Admitted While the Clock Is Ticking!&quot;

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;This is Preminger with the fat of the blockbusters pared away. The opening is beautifully organised, getting well into the action before revealing just what it&#x27;s all about, modulating from the hustle of things being done in a hurry (removal men; taxi rides; the return to the school, with the staircase thronged with chattering mothers) into the arrival of police cars, dogs and search parties. Preminger keeps his camera thrusting forward, dodging round corners, pushing through crowds; doors open on to dark interiors, lights are snapped suddenly on.  ...Where &quot;Bunny Lake&quot; falters is in the transition from sharp whodunnit to psychiatric shocker.&quot;

Andrew Sarris wrote in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that the film&#x27;s &quot;plot collapses ... because there is no overriding social interest at stake, but rather an implausibly elaborate caper by a conveniently psychotic character,&quot; and added that although the &quot;movie is a pleasure to watch from beginning to end ...] there are really no characters to consider in Preminger&#x27;s chilling world of doors and dolls and deceits and degeneracies of decor.&quot; 

&quot;Variety&quot; described it as &quot;an entertaining, fast-paced exercise in the exploration of a sick mind,&quot; with Lynley &quot;carrying much of the film on her shoulders.&quot; 

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther reported that &quot;conspicuously absent from this grossly calculated attempt at a psychological mystery thriller is just plain common sense – the kind of simple deductive logic that any reasonably intelligent person would use.&quot;

Leslie Halliwell said: &quot;A nightmarish gimmick story, with more gimmicks superimposed along the way to say nothing of a Psychoish ending; some of the decoration works and makes the unconvincing story compelling, while the cast is alone worth the price of admission.&quot;

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD in 2005 (Region 1) and 2007 (Region 2). In 2014, Twilight Time released a limited Blu-ray edition. In 2019 Powerhouse Films &amp; Indicator released a Blu-ray edition with many special features included.

==In popular culture==
The film was spoofed in &quot;Mad&quot; magazine, in the April 1966 issue (#102), under the title &quot;Bubby Lake Missed by a Mile&quot;.
In the &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; episode &quot;Off Brand&quot;, Chuck McGill walks past a movie theatre playing &quot;Bunny Lake is Missing&quot;. It is reminiscent of the urban legend the &quot;Vanishing Hotel Room&quot;.

<text>&quot;Four O&#x27;Clock&quot; is episode 94 (season 3, number 30) of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Oliver Crangle is a hate-ridden fanatic who lives in an apartment with his parrot, Pete. He maintains records of people he believes to be &quot;evil&quot; and has convinced himself that the so called &quot;evil&quot; people (communists, subversives, thieves, murderers) are engaged in a world wide conspiracy and have taken over Washington. He makes phone calls to them and their employers at all hours, writes letters regarding their actions, demands their prompt firing, and threatens to involve higher authorities if they do not comply. Unsatisfied with the results of his anonymous calls and letters, he searches for a more effective way to eliminate evil from the world; he settles on the idea of shrinking all evil people to two feet tall. Throughout the episode, Crangle&#x27;s parrot Pete periodically calls out &quot;nut,&quot; asking for a nut to eat, which Crangle gives him.

His landlady Mrs. Williams arrives, whom he berates and treats horribly to make her leave. Mrs. Lucas also comes to Crangle&#x27;s apartment and pleads for Crangle to leave her husband, a doctor, alone. Crangle is convinced that because her husband was unable to save the life of a woman in the ER who died from her injuries, that he is a murderer and evil. Due to Crangle&#x27;s letter writing to the hospital, her husband has started to feel extremely guilty for the woman&#x27;s death, and Mrs. Lucas wants Crangle to stop. Crangle simply believes that those people are also evil. Mrs. Lucas leaves, realizing Crangle is insane.

Crangle calls a number of government agencies, and Agent Hall of the FBI is sent to investigate. Crangle tells him of his plan to shrink every evil person at 4 o&#x27;clock that afternoon through sheer force of will, mentioning his belief about a global conspiracy involving the evil people of the world. He also mentions that he has tried such feats before (trying to turn wheels into triangle shapes due to believing that evil uses public transportation to move). He believes that by shrinking all evil people to two feet tall, that they will be unable to carry on their everyday lives and eventually become extinct. Hall asks Crangle if he has ever had any psychiatric help and tells Crangle that they do not need his kind of help because they have the law. Hall says that both support and help in upholding the law are appreciated, but what Crangle is doing is instead interference. Crangle accuses him of being in on the conspiracy. As Hall leaves, Crangle screams at him that he too will be two feet tall in just 20 minutes. When 4 o&#x27;clock rolls around, Crangle gloats on his imminent triumph to Pete, who calls out &quot;nut&quot; but then adds, &quot;Certainly, Oliver. This is kind of a celebration.&quot; Crangle is then horrified to find that he himself has been shrunk to two feet tall. As he struggles in vain to get up to his window sill before collapsing in anguish, Pete calls out the word &quot;nut&quot; one last time, implying that he had been insulting Crangle by calling him a &quot;nut&quot; the entire time.

(In the radio adaptation starring Stan Freberg, the ending was altered to be more gruesome as Pete the parrot mistakes the now-shrunken Crangle for a &quot;nut&quot;.)

<doc id="1338725" wikidata="Q5253593" url="?curid=1338725" title="Delegated Path Validation">
<text>Delegated Path Validation (DPV) is a cryptographic method used to offload the task of validating the certification path of digital certificates from the client to a trusted server. This process is integral to various security protocols that rely on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). DPV aim to enhance the efficiency of certification path validation by leveraging a server dedicated to this task, which provides validation results to the client. This approach is particularly useful in resource-constrained environments where clients may not have the computational power to perform extensive certificate validation themselves.

== Certificate path validation ==
Certificate path validation is a crucial process in PKI that ensures the authenticity and trustworthiness of a digital certificate. This process is standardized in and involves verifying a chain of certificates, starting from the certificate being validated (the end-entity certificate) up to a trusted root certificate authority (CA). The validation process includes several key steps: 
* Building the Path: the client constructs a path from the end-entity certificate to a trusted root certificate by following the chain of issuer and subject fields in each certificate. 
* Checking Signatures: each certificate in the chain is checked to ensure that it is correctly signed by its issuer, verifying the integrity and authenticity of each certificate. 
* Verifying Expiration Dates: the validity period of each certificate is checked to ensure none of the certificates in the path are expired.
* Checking Revocation Status: each certificate is checked against Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or online status protocols (such as OCSP) to ensure it has not been revoked. 
* Applying Policies: any additional policies specified by the relying party are applied to ensure the certificate path complies with required security standards and practices.

If all these checks are successfully passed, the certificate path is considered valid, and the end-entity certificate can be trusted.

== Validation policy ==
DPV allows a server to handle the entire process of path validation based on a set of predefined rules known as a validation policy. This policy may involve multiple trust anchors. A trust anchor is characterized by a public key, a Certificate Authority (CA) name, and a validity period; it may also have additional constraints. A self-signed certificate can be used to designate the public key, issuer name, and the validity period for a trust anchor. Additional constraints for trust anchors can be defined, such as certification policy constraints or naming constraints. These constraints can also be part of self-signed certificates. For successful path validation, a valid certification path must be established between the end-entity certificate and a trust anchor, ensuring that none of the certificates in the path are expired or revoked, and all constraints on the path must be met. A validation policy consists of three main components:

# Certification path requirements: these define the sequence of trust anchors needed to start the certification path processing and the initial conditions for validation;
# Revocation requirements: these specify the checks needed on the end-entity and CA certificates to ensure they have not been revoked;
# End-entity certificate specific requirements: these may require the end-entity certificate to include specific extensions with certain types or values.

== Protocol requirements ==
 specifies several key requirements to ensure effective and secure delegated path validation.

Firstly, if a client requests a specific validation policy that the DPV server does not support, the server must return an error. This ensures that the client is aware that the requested policy cannot be applied. If the client does not specify a validation policy, the server must indicate which validation policy was used in the response. This transparency allows clients to understand the basis on which the validation was performed.

Validation policies can be complex and may include parameters such as root self-signed certificates. The DPV protocol must allow clients to include these policy-dependent parameters in their requests. However, it is expected that most clients will either reference a validation policy suitable for their application or accept the DPV server&#x27;s default validation policy.

Clients can also request that the DPV server determines the certificate&#x27;s validity at a specific time other than the current time. In such cases, the server must obtain revocation status information relevant to the specified validation time. If the necessary revocation status information is unavailable, the server must return a status indicating that the certificate is invalid, possibly providing additional details about the reason for invalidity.

For the validation to proceed, the certificate must be either directly provided in the request or unambiguously referenced by details such as the CA distinguished name, certificate serial number, and certificate hash. This ensures that the correct certificate is validated.

The DPV client must be capable of providing the validation server with useful certificates and revocation information related to each certificate being validated. This includes OCSP responses, CRLs, and delta CRLs, which are critical for checking the current status of certificates.

The DPV server must have access to the certificate that needs validation. If the certificate is not provided in the request, the server must obtain it and verify that it matches the reference provided by the client. In the response, the server must include either the certificate or a clear reference to it, especially in cases involving CA key compromises.

The response from the DPV server must indicate one of the following statuses:

* The certificate is valid according to the validation policy;
* The certificate is not valid according to the validation policy;
* The validity of the certificate is unknown according to the validation policy;
* The validity could not be determined due to an error.

If the certificate is not valid, the server must also provide the reason for this determination. Common reasons include the inability to construct a certification path, the constructed path failing the validation algorithm, or the certificate not being valid at the requested time, such as before its validity period begins or during a suspension.

Additionally, the DPV protocol must allow clients to request that the server includes extra information in its response. This extra information helps relying parties who do not trust the DPV server to be confident that the certificate validation was performed correctly. The DPV response must be bound to the DPV request, which can be achieved by including a one-way hash of the request in the response. This binding ensures that all request parameters were considered in building the response.

To ensure the client trusts the DPV server, the response must be authenticated. For the client to prove to third parties that the certificate validation was handled correctly, the DPV response must be digitally signed, except when reporting an error. The DPV server&#x27;s certificate must authenticate the server, adding another layer of trust and security to the validation process.

=== Relaying, re-direction and multicasting ===

In certain network environments, particularly those with firewalls, a DPV server may encounter difficulties in obtaining all the necessary information to process a validation request. To address this, a DPV server can be configured to leverage the services of other DPV servers. In such scenarios, the client remains unaware that the primary DPV server is utilizing additional servers to fulfill the request. Essentially, the primary DPV server acts as a client to another DPV server, facilitating a more comprehensive validation process. Unlike end clients, DPV servers typically have more substantial computing and memory resources, enabling them to employ relaying, re-direction, or multicasting mechanisms.

The protocols designed to support these operations may include optional fields and extensions to facilitate relaying, re-direction, or multicasting between DPV servers. However, it is not expected that DPV clients will support these features. If a protocol incorporates such functionalities, it must also provide mechanisms to ensure compatibility with DPV clients and servers that do not support these advanced features, ensuring adherence to the basic protocol requirements.

== Security implications ==
The DPV protocol must incorporate mechanisms to prevent replay attacks, ensuring that malicious entities cannot reuse validation requests to gain unauthorized access. Importantly, this replay prevention must not depend on synchronized clocks between the client and server, which can be a vulnerability if clocks are not accurately aligned.

When a certificate is validated successfully according to the specified policy, the DPV server should include this information in the response if requested by the client. However, if the certificate is found to be invalid or if the server cannot determine its validity, the server may choose to omit this information to avoid unnecessary disclosure of potentially sensitive details.

The revocation status information used by the DPV server pertains to the validation time specified in the client&#x27;s request. This validation time might differ from the actual time when the certificate&#x27;s private key was used to sign a document or transaction. Therefore, the DPV client should adjust the validation time to account for several delays:
* The time it takes for the certificate holder (end-entity) to realize that their private key has been or might be compromised;
* The time needed for the end-entity to report the key compromise to the relevant authorities;
* The time required for the revocation authority to process the revocation request submitted by the end-entity;
* The time taken by the revocation authority to update and distribute the new revocation status information.

By considering these factors, the DPV protocol try to ensure that the revocation status information accurately reflects the current validity of the certificate, enhancing the overall security and reliability of the validation process.

<text>Delegated Path Discovery (DPD) is a method for querying a trusted server for information about a public key certificate.

DPD allows clients to obtain collated certificate information from a trusted DPD server. This information may then be used by the client to validate the subject certificate.

The requirements for DPD are described in RFC 3379.

<text>A peculiar galaxy is a galaxy of unusual size, shape, or composition. Between five and ten percent of known galaxies are categorized as peculiar. Astronomers have identified two types of peculiar galaxies: &quot;interacting galaxies&quot; and &quot;active galactic nuclei&quot; (AGN).

When two galaxies come close to each other, their mutual gravitational forces can cause them to acquire highly irregular shapes. The terms &#x27;peculiar galaxy&#x27; and &#x27;interacting galaxy&#x27; have now become synonymous because the majority of peculiar galaxies attribute their forms to such gravitational forces.

== Formation ==
Scientists hypothesize that many peculiar galaxies are formed by the collision of two or more galaxies. As such, peculiar galaxies tend to host more active galactic nuclei than normal galaxies, indicating that they contain supermassive black holes. Many peculiar galaxies experience starbursts, or episodes of rapid star formation, due to the galaxies merging. The periods of elevated star formation and the luminosity resulting from active galactic nuclei cause peculiar galaxies to be slightly bluer in color than other galaxies.

Studying peculiar galaxies can offer insights on other types of galaxies by providing useful information on galactic formation and evolution. Arp mapped peculiar galaxies in his 1966 Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. Arp states that &quot;the peculiarities of the galaxies pictured in this Atlas represent perturbations, deformations, and interactions which should enable us to analyze the nature of the real galaxies which we observe and which are too remote to experiment on directly.&quot;

== Notation ==
Peculiar galaxies are notated by an additional &quot;p&quot; or &quot;pec&quot; (depending on the exact convention) after the  Hubble type of the galaxy.

<text>Frode Thingnæs (20 March 1940 – 15 November 2012) was a Norwegian jazz composer, arranger, conductor and trombone player who formed the Frode Thingnæs Quintet in 1960.

== Career ==
Thingnæs was introduced to music at eight years old, when he started to play in a Sinsen school band. His first instrument was the trumpet, but in 1953 he took up the instrument he would come to be known for: the trombone. Due to his success at a young age, he was able to continue his musical education at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen, where he met other rising musicians. From 1959 onward, Thingnæs met and performed with the bands of Bjørn Jacobsen, Gunnar Brostigen, Mikkel Flagstad and Kjell Karlsen. Starting in 1961, he led his own quartet, which over time included Egil Kapstad, Terje Rypdal, Laila Dalseth, Espen Rud, Bjørn Alterhaug and Per Husby. However, it was the &quot;Frode Thingnæs Quintet&quot; (including Henryk Lysiak, Jan Erik Kongshaug, Pete Knutsen, and Thor Andreassen) that was included on Norway&#x27;s first jazz album, released in 1963. In 1967 Thingnæs was named best trombonist in the magazine &#x27;Jazznytt musician vote&#x27; and in 1969 he led a Norwegian sextet at the prestigious Montreux Jazz Festival.

Although Thingnæs is best known for his role in the jazz community, he also made major contributions to many areas in Norwegian music. In 1960, he took the prestigious role of kapellmeister at Norway&#x27;s most famous revue theater, Chat Noir. While there, he collaborated with entertainers including Einar Schanke, Alfred Næss and actor Yngvar Numme. He also worked with the rock band Popol Ace and conducted the Norwegian Radio Orchestra. Together with Philip Kruse, Thingnæs wrote the music for the Norwegian Eurovision Song Contest entries &quot;Hvor er du?&quot; (1974, English title &quot;The First Day of Love&quot;) and &quot;Mata Hari&quot; (1976), both performed by his former wife, Anne-Karine Strøm. Both Thingnæs and Strøm were members of the jury-member &quot;Finn Eriksen&#x27;s Orchestra&quot; at the time. Other pop music collaborations include Wenche Myhre, Lill Lindfors and Svante Thuresson, as well as production credits for, among others, Bodega Band (1977).

In addition, Thingnæs worked as a conductor at two Oslo theaters, the Forsvarets staff music corps and, for over thirty years, the Kampen Janitsjarorkester. He composed for the Melodi Grand Prix in 1974 &quot;Hvor er du?&quot; and the 1976 &quot;Mata Hari&quot; (both times for Anne-Karine Strøm). His Flåklypaballetten for symphony orchestra was performed at the Norwegian Opera in 1985. In the same year, Thingnæs created his &quot;Sonnets to Sundry Notes&quot; of Music for symphony orchestra, big band and choir, based on texts by Shakespeare. His most renowned original works may be &quot;Wheels&quot; and the &quot;Flåklypa ballet&quot; (1985), performed at the Norwegian National Opera. In his latter years, he led a quintet together with Harald Gundhus.

Frode Thingnæs died in Oslo in November 2012, aged 72.

== Honors ==
*1970: Buddy Prize awarded by the Norwegian Jazz Federation
*1980: Spellemann Prize in the class Jazz for the album &quot;Direct to Dish&quot;
*1983: Gammleng Award as a studio musician
*1999: The Norwegian King&#x27;s Medal of Merit in gold
*1999: Honorary Citizen of New Orleans

== Personal life ==
Thingnæs was married to actress and drama teacher Marianne Mørk (b. 16 May 1953) on 2 June 1979. They had two children together: pianist Magnus Alexander Mørk Thingnæs (b. 1984), and filmmaker Maren Victoria Thingnæs (b. 1991).

<text>Velikiye Luki (; lit. &quot;great meanders&quot; or &quot;longbows&quot;) is a town in Pskov Oblast, Russia, located on the meandering Lovat River. It is the second largest town in Pskov Oblast; population: Velikiye Luki is a City of Military Glory, an honor bestowed on it because of the courage and heroism its citizens displayed during World War II.

==History==

Velikiye Luki is first mentioned in a chronicle under the year of 1166 as Luki. From the 12th century, Luki was a part of the Novgorod Republic. After the construction of a fortress in 1211, Luki gained strategic importance, defending the approaches to Pskov and Novgorod. It was located near the border with Lithuania. The adjective &quot;Velikiye&quot; in the name first appeared in the early 15th century. It was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Moscow by Ivan the Great in 1478. During the Livonian War, it played an important role. It was besieged and captured by Polish-Lithuanian King Stephen Báthory in 1580, and remained under Polish control until 1582.

In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Velikiye Luki was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). It was explicitly mentioned as one of the towns the governorate comprised. In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off, and in 1772, Pskov Governorate (which between 1777 and 1796 existed as Pskov Viceroyalty) was established. After 1777, Velikiye Luki was the seat of Velikolutsky Uyezd (later known as Velikoluksky Uyezd). At the beginning of the 20th century, it evolved into an important railway hub following the construction of the railway connecting Moscow with Riga.
On 1 August 1927, the uyezds were abolished, and Velikoluksky District was established, with the administrative center in Velikiye Luki. Pskov Governorate was abolished as well, Velikiye Luki was the center of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On 17 June 1929 the okrug was transferred to Western Oblast. On 23 July 1930 the okrugs were also abolished. On 29 January 1935 Western Oblast was abolished, and the district was transferred to Kalinin Oblast, and on 5 February that year Velikiye Luki became the center of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Kalinin Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. On 4 May 1938 the okrug was abolished again.

From 19 to 21 July 1941 and again from 25 August 1941 to 17 January 1943, Velikiye Luki was occupied by German troops. During World War II, in 1941 and 1942, fighting took place in the vicinity between German and Soviet forces. In 1942, the Germans established a forced labour camp in the city. During the Battle for Velikiye Luki (in late 1942), a German force of about 20,000 was surrounded in the town which had been turned into a fortress. After months of heavy fighting, the German defenders were finally defeated and Velikiye Luki was liberated by the troops of the 3rd Shock Army of the Kalinin Front of the Red Army on 17 January 1943. 
The town was almost completely destroyed.

A significant portion of the Soviet forces fighting for Velikiye Luki consisted of Estonians conscripted into the Red Army, and approximately 6000 of them died liberating the town. The railroad system in Velikiye Luki was the target of a mass air raid on 19 July 1944 by Heinkel He 177 heavy bomber aircraft, the only documented mass raid utilizing this model of aircraft. Many streets are named after the heroes of the War. One such street is named after Yelizaveta Chaikina.

On 22 August 1944 Velikiye Luki Oblast was established, with the administrative center in Velikiye Luki. On 2 October 1957 Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished, and Velikiye Luki was transferred to Pskov Oblast as the town of oblast significance.

===850th celebration===

In 2016, Velikiye Luki celebrated the 850th anniversary of the town&#x27;s first appearance on historical sources, which is dated to 1166.

The town marked the event with festivals and historical exhibitions, as well as making long-term improvements. In 2013, town planners began the preparations to improve the infrastructure and quality of life for residents. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev offered federal support to the anniversary, and recommended the Ministry of Transport fund a much-needed overpass connecting the two busiest parts of Velikiye Luki. The majority (70%) of the buildings in the town, including the schools, were built in the 1950s and 1960s and needed modernisation. New sports and leisure facilities were needed. Town officials stated the overall aim is to preserve the historical aspects of the city.

Among the improvements planned was the remodel of a large obelisk in Jubilee Square, which was erected on the city&#x27;s 800th anniversary in 1966 but never finished (and had been dubbed a &quot;white elephant&quot;). A contest was held to solicit designs for the remodel of the obelisk, as well as logos and slogans for the festivities. The winning design for the obelisk features elements symbolising the town&#x27;s history, including Viking and Greek features.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it serves as the administrative center of Velikoluksky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the Town of Velikiye Luki—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the Town of Velikiye Luki is incorporated as Velikiye Luki Urban Okrug and serves as the administrative center of Velikoluksky Municipal District.

==Economy==
===Industry===
Velikiye Luki is an industrial city, with several enterprises in machine building industry. They produce machines for timber industry, electrotechnical equipment, and batteries. There is a workshop to repair railway carriages and locomotives. There are also enterprises of timber, textile, and food industries, as well as production of brickstones. Food industry in 2010 was responsible for production of 24.8% of all industrial output, and electrotechnical industry produced 15% of the output.

===Transportation===
Velikiye Luki is an important railway hub. One railway connects Moscow via Velikiye Luki with Riga and runs in the east–west direction. Another railway, running to the northwest, connects Velikiye Luki via Toropets and Ostashkov with Bologoye. One more railway connects Velikiye Luki to Nevel, where it splits into two railway lines, both running southeast into Belarus: One line to Vitebsk, and another one to Grodno via Polotsk and Molodechno.

The M9 highway which connects Moscow and Riga bypasses Velikiye Luki, which has an access to the highway. Other roads connect Velikiye Luki with Novosokolniki, with Nevel, and with Porkhov via Loknya. There are also local roads.

The town is served by the Velikiye Luki Airport.

==Culture and recreation==

The district contains seven objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of federal significance and thirty-three monuments of local significance. The federal monuments include the Kazan Church built in the 19th century, and the ramparts, the oldest of which originate from the 12th century.

The two museums in Velikiye Luki are the Velikiye Luki Local Museum, which exhibits collections of local interest, and Ivan Vinogradov Museum-House, located in the house which belonged to the parents of mathematician Ivan Vinogradov. The house was restored in the 1970s with the help of Vinogradov himself. He lived here before moving to study in Saint Petersburg.

== Education ==
There are several institutions of higher education in the city:
* State Agricultural Academy of Velikie Luki,
* Velikiye Luki State Academy of Physical Education and Sports,
* branch of St. Petersburg State Transport University,
* branch of Pskov State University.

<doc id="1338760" wikidata="Q5570878" url="?curid=1338760" title="Neil">
<text>Neil is a masculine name of Irish origin. The name is an anglicisation of the Irish &quot;Niall&quot; which is of disputed derivation. The Irish name may be derived from words meaning &quot;cloud&quot;, &quot;passionate&quot;, &quot;victory&quot;, &quot;honour&quot; or &quot;champion&quot;. As a surname, Neil is traced back to Niall of the Nine Hostages who was an Irish king and eponymous ancestor of the Uí Néill and MacNeil kindred. Most authorities cite the meaning of Neil in the context of a surname as meaning &quot;champion&quot;.

==Origins==
The Gaelic name was adopted by the Vikings and taken to Iceland as &quot;Njáll&quot; (see Nigel). From Iceland it went via Norway, Denmark, and Normandy to England. The name also entered Northern England and Yorkshire directly from Ireland, and from Norwegian settlers. &quot;Neal&quot; or &quot;Neall&quot; is the Middle English form of &quot;Nigel&quot;.

As a first name, during the Middle Ages, the Gaelic name of Irish origins was popular in Ireland and later Scotland. During the 20th century &quot;Neil&quot; began to be used in England and North America, and grew in popularity throughout the English-speaking world; however, in England, it has recently been eclipsed by the Gaelic form.

The surname &quot;Neil&quot; is a reduced form of the surname &quot;McNeil&quot; (from the Gaelic &quot;Mac Néill&quot;, &quot;son of &quot;Niall&quot;&quot;), or variant form the surname of Neill (from the Irish &quot;Ó Néill&quot; and Mac Néill or the Scottish Gaelic &quot;Mac Néill&quot;, meaning &quot;descendant of &quot;Niall&quot;&quot; and &quot;son of &quot;Niall&quot;&quot;).

The name passed from Ireland to Scotland where it had the &quot;Mc/Mac&quot; prefix a prefix that already existed in the Irish surname such as Lóegaire mac Néill. Some Scottish McNeills returned to Ireland in the 14th century and are associated with &quot;MacNeill&quot;, &quot;MacGreal&quot;, &quot;MacReill&quot;, and &quot;Mag Reil&quot; surnames.

The Manx version of the name is &quot;Kneal&quot; (1598), &quot;Kneale&quot; (1655), or &quot;Kneel&quot; (1636). It evolved from McNelle (1408) and MacNeyll (1430) becoming Kneal by 1598.

<text>Mavic is a France-based bicycle parts manufacturer, its name is an acronym for Manufacture d&#x27;Articles Vélocipédiques Idoux et Chanel.

It was founded by Charles Idoux and Lucien Chanel in Lyon, France in the late 1800s. Mavic produced the first aluminium rim in 1934, and the first disc wheel in 1973. Also in 1973, Mavic introduced &quot;neutral&quot; support for all racing teams during cycle races.

Mavic has developed many products over the years, including a Tour de France winning groupset, but is today focused on wheels.

In 2019, Mavic was sold by Amer Sports to the equity firm Regent, LP. After some ownership turmoil it was sold to Bourrelier Group in 2020.

<text>Ogo is a handheld electronic device that enables communication via instant messaging services, email, MMS and SMS text messages. The device works through GSM cellular networks and allows unlimited usage for a flat monthly fee. It supports AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, and MSN Messenger. It was released in 2004.

==Overview==

Ogo uses the IXI-Connect OS. It features a clamshell design with a 12-bit depth color screen on the top half and a full QWERTY keyboard on the lower half. Navigation through the menus is accomplished primarily through the use of a directional pad located on the lower right hand of the device and alternately through buttons that directly access each of the devices features.

The Ogo is part of a family of devices produced by its overseas manufacturer, IXI, which showcase the &quot;personal mobile gateway&quot; concept, wherein the Ogo acts as a wireless gateway for other Bluetooth enabled devices to access the Internet. Other devices in the family include pens and cameras. With support for AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Instant Messenger, and MSN Windows Messenger, it&#x27;s at least as equipped for IM as any phone you could hope for. The Ogo supports POP3 e-mail, but that&#x27;s about it. The Ogo is not a phone and has no voice features.

AT&amp;T deliberately omitted the wireless gateway capabilities of the Ogo in all domestic advertising, possibly in a bid to keep the device from being used as a flat-rate wireless modem.

After the acquisition of AT&amp;T Wireless by Cingular, the Ogo was no longer offered. Cingular discontinued its Ogo service on October 10, 2006.

The device is also marketed in Germany by 1&amp;1. In Germany, the OGO is called a Pocket Web. The OGO can web surf, email, sync with outlook, IM and all the other things like the US based OGO but can not play MP3s. It is also available in Austria through A1 and in Switzerland through Swisscom carrier.

<text>West Palm Beach station is a train station in West Palm Beach, Florida. It is served by Amtrak passenger rail and Tri-Rail commuter rail service. It is located at 203–209 South Tamarind Avenue, south of First Street/Banyan Boulevard. The former Seaboard Air Line Railway station building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Seaboard Coastline Railroad Passenger Station.

==History==

The station officially opened to passengers in January 1925 as a Seaboard Air Line Railway depot. The building was designed by the Palm Beach architectural firm of Harvey &amp; Clarke. Among other Seaboard trains, the station was served by the &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot; until 1953, and the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; beginning in 1939. Amtrak maintained &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; service to the station when it took over intercity passenger train service in 1971. The station was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 19, 1973. Tri-Rail service to the station began in 1989.

The City of West Palm Beach, following a purchase of the building in 1988, tapped local architecture firm Oliver Glidden &amp; Partners to head a $4.3 million restoration of the structure. The project was completed and the station rededicated in a ceremony attended by the Florida Governor in April 1991. Architect Robert D. Brown directed the restoration of ornamental cast stone elements, exterior masonry, doors, windows, and iron and tile work. The red clay tile roof was replaced, as were the electrical, lighting, plumbing and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Abatement of lead and asbestos was further required to bring the historic structure up to modern building code standards. The restoration effort earned the Florida Trust Award for Historic Preservation in 1994.

In summer 2012, the city finished an improvement project that included the installation of new sidewalks and more than five dozen trees around the building. The improvements were funded with a $750,000 Transportation Enhancement grant from the Federal Highway Administration, to which the city provided a $150,000 local match.

On November 10, 2024, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; was merged with the as the &quot;Floridian&quot;.

==Station layout==
The station has two side platforms, with access to the station on both sides. West of the southbound platform is a long loop of bus bays serving Palm Tran routes. East of the northbound platform is the station house, a small parking lot, and bus stops for Greyhound Lines buses and Tri-Rail shuttles.

<doc id="1338800" wikidata="Q161230" url="?curid=1338800" title="Allium vineale">
<text>Allium vineale (wild garlic, onion grass, crow garlic or stag&#x27;s garlic) is a perennial, bulb-forming species of wild onion, native to Europe, northwestern Africa and the Middle East. The species was introduced in Australia and North America, where it has become an Invasive species.

== Description ==
All parts of the plant have a strong garlic odour. The underground bulb is 1–2 cm diameter, with a fibrous outer layer. The main (flower) stem grows to 30–120 cm tall, bearing 2–4 leaves and an apical inflorescence 2–5 cm diameter comprising a number of small bulbils and none to a few flowers, subtended by a basal bract.

The leaves are slender hollow tubes, 15–60 cm long and 2–4 mm thick, waxy texture, with a groove along the side of the leaf facing the stem. Although very similar with the leaves of &quot;Allium schoenoprasum&quot; (Chives), they tend to be more fibrous, have more vertical grooves, and the grooves are better defined than the leaves of chives.

The inflorescence is a tight umbel surrounded by a membranous bract in bud which withers when the flowers open. Each individual flower is stalked and has a pinkish-green perianth long. There are six tepals, six stamens and a pistil formed from three fused carpels. Mixed with the flowers are several yellowish-brown bulbils.

The fruit is a capsule but the seeds seldom set and propagation usually takes place when the bulbils are knocked off and grow into new plants.

Plants with no flowers, only bulbils, are sometimes distinguished as the variety &quot;Allium vineale&quot; var. &quot;compactum&quot;, but this character is probably not taxonomically significant.

Although crow&#x27;s garlic has an odour similar to true garlic, &quot;A. sativum&quot;, forms flowers full of bulbils just like garlic and dies back during summer, the leaf structure is more similar to those of chives, &quot;A. schoenoprasum&quot;, to which &quot;A. vineale&quot; is more closely related to than true garlic.

== Die back ==
During summer, just like domesticated garlic (&quot;A. sativum&quot;), after it forms the flower, the plant dies back over the course of the last summer months and sprouts back in mid autumn when precipitations grow and temperatures drop enough.

This is one of the reasons why the plants can be quite easily spread and become a weed, because during the most intense agricultural soil mechanical interactions, the weeds are almost impossible to identify, and both the bulbs and newly formed bulbils are dormant and less susceptible to die from mechanical damage.

== Uses and invasiveness ==
The leaves, flowers, and bulbs of &quot;Allium vineale&quot; are edible. While it has been suggested as a substitute for garlic, there is some difference of opinion as to whether there is an unpleasant aftertaste compared to that of common garlic (&quot;Allium sativum&quot;). It imparts a garlic-like flavour and odour on dairy and beef products when grazed by livestock. It is considered a pestilential invasive weed in the US, as grain products may become tainted with a garlic odour or flavour in the presence of aerial bulblets at the time of harvest. Wild garlic is tolerant to herbicides, which cannot cling well to the vertical, smooth and waxy structure of its leaves.

&quot;Allium vineale&quot; &#x27;Hair&#x27;, a cultivated variety, is sold as an ornamental plant in the UK and USA. It has unusual flowerheads which have purple centres and green hair-like extensions.

<text>Miguel Rolando Covian (September 7, 1913 – February 5, 1992), was an Argentine-Brazilian physiologist, medical educator and writer.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Covian was born in Rufino, Santa Fe Province, Argentina, on September 7, 1913. He studied at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Buenos Aires, where, while a student, he worked also as a teaching assistant in the Chair of Physiology. He graduated in 1942 and soon thereafter started a full-time career in research on Physiology, initially in collaboration with Bernardo Houssay, the great Argentine physiologist, who later was awarded with the 1947 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for his investigation on the interaction between the hypophysis and the pancreas in the control of glucose metabolism. From 1945 to 1948, Covian worked at the Institute of Experimental Biology and Medicine of Buenos Aires, a private research institution which Houssay and co-workers had founded in 1944, due to his dismissal from the University due to political persecution by the dictatorial regime of Edelmiro Farrell. There, he worked also with another eminent physiologist, Eduardo Braun-Menéndez, and presented his doctoral dissertation in 1948.

===Fellowship===
After his doctorate Covian went for a post-doctoral fellowship by the Rockefeller Foundation, at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, United States. There he worked on the physiology of hemidecorticated animals and neurovegetative control, with several important physiologists, such as Phillip Bard, Carl Richter and Vernon Mountcastle. He returned three years later to Argentina, to continue his participation at the Institute of Experimental Biology and Medicine, where, in 1952, he established the first experimental laboratory of neurophysiology of Argentina.

===Research===
In 1955 Covian was already well known internationally for his research on the neurophysiology of the limbic system. He accepted an invitation from Dr. Zeferino Vaz to join the faculty of the recently founded School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto of the University of São Paulo, at Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil, as the chairman of the Department of Physiology, a post he held until 1974 and from 1978 to 1982. Under Covian&#x27;s able and humane leadership, the Department would grow to become one of the main excellence centers of research and education in Latin America, with an excellent scientific staff, with prominent researchers such as Eduardo Krieger, Renato Migliorini, César Timo-Iaria, José Antunes Rodrigues, José Venâncio Pereira Leite and fellow Argentines Maria Carmelo Lico, Andrés Negro-Vilar and Ricardo F. Marseillan. Covian was involved in all aspects of scientific and educational progress in the physiological sciences. It was there too that Covian founded the first Brazilian laboratory of neurophysiology.

===Leadership===
Covian was extremely active as a scientific leader. He was one of the founders and a president of the Brazilian Society of Physiology. He also was a strong force behind the graduate programs of the School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto, and an innovator in the use of new approaches to the teaching of physiology. He was active in the editorial boards of several international scientific journals, such as &quot;Physiology &amp; Behavior&quot; and the monograph series of &quot;Progress in Brain Research&quot;, a member to several international committees, the International Brain Research Organization and the Latin American Federation of Physiological Sciences.

===Systematic study===
Covian&#x27;s main achievement in neurophysiology was the systematic study, with a large group of collaborators, of the neural basis of thirst, of neuroendocrine regulation of hydroelectrolytic homeostasis, and of appetitive behavior, i.e., the behavior which permit animals to seek and to ingest particular foodstuffs or diet components, an activity which depends on many external and internal factors. The animal model used by Covian&#x27;s group was the selective ingestion of water versus salt water in albino Norwegian rats, which they investigated with many approaches and tools, such as after lesions and stimulations of the central nervous system, measurement of metabolic activity, manipulation of the activity of the endocrine system, the effect of several kinds of drugs, etc. He also studied the role of the limbic system (particularly the septal area) on many behaviors and functions, such as the control of blood pressure, the neuroendocrine regulation of reproductive behavior, etc.

===Humanist===
Covian was also a humanist, deeply interested in the history and philosophy of science, history of medicine, epistemology, religion, classical music and erudite art. He retired at the mandatory age of 70, as a professor emeritus, but continued to appear regularly his office in the department

===Death===
Honored by his many colleagues, pupils and friends, Covian died on February 5, 1992, following complications of a stroke.

<text>Up at the Villa is a 1941 novella by William Somerset Maugham about a young widow caught among three men: her suitor, her one-night stand, and her confidant. A fast-paced story, &quot;Up at the Villa&quot; incorporates elements of the crime and suspense novel.

== Plot ==
The action takes place in the late 1930s. 30-year-old Mary Panton, whose extraordinary beauty has always been one of her greatest assets, has been a widow for one year. Her late husband Matthew, whom she married at 21 because she loved him, turned out to be an alcoholic, a gambler, a womaniser, and a wife-beater. Mary endures all the hardship and pain inflicted on her by her husband (including his having sex with her while drunk). When he drinks and drives, he has a car accident. A few hours later, he dies in Mary&#x27;s arms. This, she concludes, is a blessing for both of them.

The Leonards (a couple who do not appear in person in the novel) offer Panton their 16th-century villa on a hill above Florence, Italy, for an extended stay. She gladly accepts the offer. The old villa is staffed by Nina, the maid, and her husband Ciro, the manservant—but it is otherwise empty. Mary, whose parents are both dead, enjoys the solitary life up at the villa. Occasionally, she joins other residents of, and visitors to, Florence for a party or luncheon. She enjoys driving round the countryside in her car. So far as a widow she has not taken a lover. She says it has been an easy decision as she has never been tempted.

During dinner at a restaurant with some of her acquaintances—among them the old Princess San Ferdinando, an American who is said to have been a &quot;loose woman&quot; in her day—they listen to a young man playing the violin. He is dressed in folkloric clothes and does not play well. At the end of the evening, the Princess tries to set Mary up with Rowley Flint, a young Englishman of independent means and risky reputation, by asking her to give him a lift back to his hotel. Flint makes a pass at her, but she rejects him, and laughs, even when he proposes to her.

After she has dropped him off, Mary drives back home. On her way, although it is late at night, she stops to have a look at the scenery. She senses someone nearby and learns that it is Karl Richter, the fiddler from the restaurant, who is also admiring the view. They begin to talk, and Mary learns that he is a 23-year-old Austrian art student who has fled his country because of Nazi persecution. Without a passport or documents, he is staying as an illegal immigrant in a rented room near the Leonards&#x27; villa.

Mary takes pity on Richter, and invites him to look at the paintings in the villa. Learning he had gone without dinner, Mary fixes him some bacon and eggs. They have wine with their improvised meal. They end up in bed.

When Mary thinks it is time for Richter to leave and the latter, to her dismay, asks when he will be able to see her again, the idyll quickly deteriorates. Mary remembers the revolver her suitor, 54-year-old Sir Edgar Swift, has forced upon her as a means of protection. When Richter starts threatening her, she pulls it out and aims it at him. She cannot pull the trigger and advises him to try and escape to Switzerland.

After she tells him she slept with him from pity, Richter attacks her verbally. He picks her up and throws her on her bed, before covering her face with kisses. She tries to get away from him but he overpowers her. Seized with remorse over what he sees as the impossibility of life since escaping his homeland, Richter says, &quot;You asked me not to forget you. I shall forget, but you won&#x27;t.&quot; He shoots himself through the breast with Swift&#x27;s gun.

The maid Nina hears the shot and comes to the bedroom door. Mary panics and sends her away. She phones Flint and asks him to help her. Mary is prepared to accept full responsibility for her actions. But Flint suggests they try to dispose of the body.

They put the body in the car and drive out into the country, where he dumps it. A car full of drunk Italians approaches and must slow to try to pass. When the party see Mary and Flint embracing each other as they pretend to be lovers, they start singing &quot;La donna è mobile&quot; and drive on. The next morning, Flint returns and leaves the revolver with Richter&#x27;s body.

Mary sleeps almost until noon. She has an invitation for luncheon, and Flint has urged her not to show any signs of panic or fear, so she attends it. Her guilty conscience is her constant companion.

Sir Edgar Swift, who has known her and her parents since she was a little child, arrives, planning to renew his suit since she was widowed. He had told her of an impending promotion to a high government post in colonial India and his need for a suitable wife. He proposes to Mary before a short trip to Cannes on urgent government business. Mary tells him she will give him an answer when he returns.

Mary confesses everything when Swift returns. He says that he forgives her and that he still wants to marry her. But, he says he must give up the promised post because of the risk of her past being exposed. He suggests that he can retire, they will marry and move to the French Côte d&#x27;Azur. Mary, finally says that she does not love him and could not be around him all the time.

After Swift has left, Flint turns up at the villa. When he mentions owning an estate in Kenya, and having read Dr Johnson, he appears more attractive. Agreeing with him that life is about taking risks, Mary decides to accept his proposal.

==Film version==

The novella was adapted as the 2000 film &quot;Up at the Villa&quot;, directed by Philip Haas. The movie starred Kristin Scott Thomas, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi, and Sean Penn. In the film, subplots were added to expand the material to feature film length, which reviewers and cinemagoers criticised.

== Manuscript == 
Somerset Maugham donated the manuscript of &quot;Up at the Villa&quot; to Rupert Hart-Davis to sell in 1960 to raise money for the London Library; it sold for £1,100.

<text>Kart Fighter (, &quot;Mario Combat,&quot; punning on the Chinese title of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;) is an unlicensed 2D fighting game produced for the Nintendo Famicom by Taiwanese studio Hummer Team. The game features unauthorized appearances by Nintendo&#x27;s mascot Mario and the rest of the cast of &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; in a port of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. &quot;Kart Fighter&quot; has received some media attention, including mostly positive reviews, in part because of its perceived similarity to the later &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Kart Fighter&quot; follows many of the rules and conventions already established for the fighting game genre by the time of its release. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat. The object of each round is to deplete the opponent&#x27;s vitality before the timer runs out. Because it is an adaptation of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, the game controls resemble those of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series. The player uses the D-pad to move the character towards or away from the opponent or to jump. The A and B buttons perform punches and kicks, as well as jump punches and jump kicks when combined with movement. Additionally, each character has a selection of special moves performed by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands. Unlike &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, nearly all characters have some form of projectile attack available as a special move, but the blocking system is more limited.

Five difficulty levels are available for solo play. A second player can also select a character, allowing for two-player matches. However, because no indication of this feature appears in game, it can be easily overlooked.

===Characters===
All eight playable characters from &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; appear in &quot;Kart Fighter&quot;, although several have been renamed or are Japanese versions of names– Mari (Mario), Luigi, Peach (Princess Toadstool), Yossy (Yoshi), Kupa (Bowser), Donkey (Donkey Kong Jr.), Nokonoko (Koopa Troopa), and Kinopio (Toad). Many of the characters&#x27; appearances are closely adapted from &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; sprites, although they are not to scale. However, Donkey Kong Jr. has a substantially different appearance and Princess Peach appears in a miniskirt and boots, similar to Chun-Li of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; fame.

==Development==
During the 1980s and 1990s, production of pirate Famicom games in East Asia was commonplace, aided by the Famicom&#x27;s absence of the 10NES lockout chip included in North American versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System. The commercial success of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; made it a particularly frequent choice for unauthorized ports and adaptations. &quot;Kart Fighter&quot; was a resulting game made from this craze, developed by a team known as Hummer Team or Gouder, and published by Hong Kong–based Ge De Industry, likely in 1993.

&quot;Kart Fighter&quot; emulated the general look of the characters from the 1992 Super Famicom &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;. The limited hardware of the 8-bit Famicom would have forced the characters to look far worse, especially when the source material was on a 16-bit platform, being limited to four colors instead of 16. Hummer Team overcame this by combining two separate sprites to utilize more colors for each character. Material from other games were also stolen, including a stage background taken from &quot;Little Nemo: The Dream Master&quot;.

Hummer Team also created other unauthorized &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; adaptations. One such game was included on the &quot;1998 Super HIK 4 in 1 12M&quot; multicart, in which Mario appeared alongside characters from the Street Fighter franchise. The same engine &quot;Kart Fighter&quot; used was also modded to create the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;-themed &quot;AV Bishoujo Senshi Girl Fighting&quot;.

==Legacy==
Several years after its release, &quot;Kart Fighter&quot; received critical attention for its similarities to the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. Reviews were generally positive, especially in the context of fighting games on the NES or unauthorized NES games, categories viewed as having typically poor quality. Reviews cited its originality, music, and relative lack of bugs, with several considering it one of the best unauthorized games of its era, meeting or exceeding the quality of similar licensed games such as &quot;&quot;.

However, &quot;Complex&quot; considered &quot;Kart Fighter&quot; the worst fighting game ever made. Other reviewers remarked negatively on the screen flicker resulting from the game&#x27;s sprite system, poor AI, missing menu options, and lack of a proper ending.

<text>Ángel Mislan (March 1, 1862 – February 1, 1911) was a composer of Puerto Rican Danzas.

==Early years==
Mislan (birth name: Ángel Mislan Huertas) was born in San Sebastián, Puerto Rico where he was raised and educated. The small town is located in the western part of Puerto Rico. His father was a music teacher who gave private lessons on the use of musical instruments. Mislan learned from his father how to play the clarinet and the euphonium (the latter is essential in the performance of Puerto Rican danzas). When he was very young he went to Spain to further his musical training by learning composition and harmony.

==Musical career==
In 1886, when Mislan was 24 years old, he returned to Puerto Rico and settled down in Arecibo. There he joined the Military Band of the Third Battalion of Volunteers; eventually, he became the director of that band. During this period he wrote his two best known danza compositions, &quot;&quot;Sara&quot; and &quot;Tu y Yo&quot;&quot; (You and I). His style differed from that of Manuel Gregorio Tavárez and Juan Morel Campos in that his danzas were typically shorter and humorous.

In 1898, Mislan returned to his hometown where he became the director of the Municipal Band. This was an important position, held in high regard by the society of the time. In 1906, he met a young musician by the name of Juan F. Acosta and took him under his wing. The older performer taught Acosta music composition and harmony and, when Mislan moved from San Sebastian to the town of Barceloneta, he recommended that Acosta replace him as the new director of the San Sebastian Municipal Band.

==Legacy==
Mislan died in the town of Barceloneta, Puerto Rico on February 1, 1911. Besides writing danzas, Mislan also wrote Puerto Rican folk music, waltzes and marches. Most of his works are safeguarded in the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña (Institute of Puerto Rican Culture). In 1948, Puerto Rican singer Julita Ross recorded the danzas of Ángel Mislan. The City of San Sebastián honored Mislan&#x27;s memory by naming a school after him and by placing a bust of his image in the center of its plaza.

<doc id="1338835" wikidata="Q7242694" url="?curid=1338835" title="Prickly City">
<text>Prickly City is a daily comic strip originally drawn by Scott Stantis, the editorial cartoonist for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and distributed through United Features Syndicate. The cartoon follows the adventures of Carmen, a young girl of color, and a coyote pup named Winslow. The strip is frequently politically oriented with a conservative point-of-view.
It is currently drawn by Eric Allie. 

== Characters ==
Carmen – a &#x27;feisty&#x27; conservative and a Republican. For a brief time, she had a crush on Tucker Carlson. Carmen made her first appearance at least 4 months before the strip began, in one of Stantis&#x27;s editorial cartoons.

Winslow – named for the town of Winslow, Arizona, is a coyote with political aspirations who acts patronizing, condescending and impulsive. His liberal responses are typically the source of the strip&#x27;s jokes. Carmen is continuously frustrated by Winslow&#x27;s assumption that she should be a liberal feminist. Early in the strip&#x27;s run, Winslow had a crush on Condoleezza Rice, even writing a poem about her (which Carmen initially misunderstood as being a poem about herself).

===Minor recurring characters===

* Kevin, the Lost Bunny of the Apocalypse. Depending on the needs of the strip, he&#x27;s alternately meant to evoke Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. He reports on signs of the &quot;end times&quot;. In 2010, he was elected to the U.S. Senate under the banner of Winslow&#x27;s &quot;Lefty Tea Party&quot;.
* Hunny, Kevin&#x27;s wife (also a bunny) and a prominent politician. Her character is a thinly veiled satire of Hillary Clinton.
* Dio, a chameleon named for Diogenes the Cynic. He was a campaign director for Winslow.
* Vaughn, appears to be an armadillo. He served as Winslow&#x27;s campaign finance director.
* Rand, a vulture, possibly named after Rand Paul or Ayn Rand .

== Controversies ==

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; refused to run the February 7, 2005 strip, which inaccurately quoted Ted Kennedy. According to Stantis, the syndicate erroneously added quote marks to the dialogue without his permission. Later that year &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; refused to run a series of strips about the Terri Schiavo case. Later, a series of strips beginning August 25, 2008 accused the attendees of the 2008 Democratic National Convention of being communists.

==Tributes==
&quot;Prickly City&quot; has paid tribute to the passing of famous people during 2006. On July 31, they paid tribute to Hooters president Robert H. Brooks. &quot;Frank and Ernest&quot; cartoonist Bob Thaves was remembered in the September 10, 2006 edition.

On September 16, 2019, the strip paid tribute to comics syndicate editor Lee Salem.

On February 13, 2021, the strip paid tribute to baseball player Hank Aaron.

<text>Aktzin(Totonacan: Ā&#x27;ktzini&quot;,&quot; &quot;He who makes Thunder&quot;) was the god of rain, thunder and lightning for the Totonac people of Mexico. Aktzin corresponds with Tláloc to the Aztecs and Chaac or Cabrakán to the Mayas, and is most commonly syncretised with Saint John the Baptist.

He existed before the Sun and was owner of all the waters, except the rainwater ironically enough. He lived in the &quot;great water&quot; at the end of the sea and skies to the east, where he acted as the eastern pillar holding the world, his abode has also been described as underground where he creates wooden animals to act as his servants. In accordance to mesoamerican duality; Aktzin was both life giving and life taking, keen to drown the world as those who died by drowning became his servants; the men forced to dig the river beds, and women forced marry him. Aktzin is seen as a hunter, drinker and very noisy. It is he who is heard bellowing like a jaguar when rain comes. Stories credit him as the inventor of tubers and friend of animals

A story of him as Saint John tells how he slayed a giant python called &quot;seventeen heads&quot;, who lived in Chicontepec and devastated the population. John tricked the snake and made him fall head first into the sea, where he was chained with the hair of the Virgin, where he remains, only able to move his head and scream.

Aktzin was typically depicted as a male figure wearing some form of headdress and rings over his eyes, similar to spectacles. In one hand he held a hammer or axe which would produce thunder and lightning as it struck the clouds. Water poured from his other hand, either from his palm or from a vessel which he held. These elements represented the life-giving and sometimes destructive forces of the weather.

The Spanish conquerors led by Hernán Cortés encountered the Totonac civilization in 1519, after their initial contact with the Mayas of the Yucatán Peninsula. The Totonac territories were located near the Gulf coast in what is today the state of Veracruz. The city of El Tajín (City of the Thunder God), is an archaeological zone with the remains of the Totonac capital city dating back over 1,000 years.

<text>The Northern Branch is a railroad line that runs from Jersey City to Northvale in northeastern New Jersey, and formerly extended further into New York State. The line was constructed in 1859 by the Northern Railroad of New Jersey to connect the New York and Erie Railroad&#x27;s Piermont Branch terminus in Piermont, New York, directly to Erie&#x27;s primary terminal in Jersey City, initially Exchange Place, later Pavonia Terminal. In 1870 the line was extended to Nyack, New York, and continued to provide passenger service until 1966. After the Erie&#x27;s unsuccessful merger with the Lackawanna Railroad to form the Erie-Lackawanna, ownership of the line passed into the hands of Conrail upon its formation in 1976 from a number of bankrupt railroads (including the E-L).

The line survives as two separate but connected sections. The Northern Running Track is an approximately two-mile-long freight railroad line in Hudson County, New Jersey. It runs from the Passaic and Harsimus Line at Marion Junction in western Jersey City north to the North Bergen Yard and the CSX Transportation&#x27;s River Subdivision. North of the rail yard the Northern Branch diverges from the River Subdivision and continues north to the New York state line as a minor spur.

The Northern Branch Corridor Project is a NJ Transit proposal to restore passenger service on the line as an extension of the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail from the current Tonnelle Avenue terminus in North Bergen to Englewood.

== History ==

=== Northern Railroad of New Jersey ===

The Northern Railroad of New Jersey was chartered in 1854. When it opened on May 28, 1859, it was the second railroad in modern Bergen County (following only the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad) with stage connections to Hackensack and other points. The northern terminal was Piermont, New York, on the New York and Erie Rail Road, which had opened in 1841. After running on the Erie for one mile, trains reached the Northern&#x27;s own line at Sparkill, New York, and ran for 21 miles to another junction with the Erie at Croxton in Jersey City, New Jersey. From there trains ran on the Erie and the New Jersey Railroad for two and a half miles to the terminal later called Exchange Place. Passengers could continue by ferry to Chambers St in Manhattan. Because of its running over the Erie, the Northern was built to the same 6-foot broad gauge. By September 1859, there were three passenger trains in each direction, with one express running from Piermont to Jersey City in 70 minutes. Sometime in the 1860s the Northern began running service westward from Sparkill on the Erie&#x27;s Piermont Branch as far as Monsey, New York.

The southern terminal was moved to the Erie&#x27;s Jersey City Terminal late in 1868, about six months before the Northern Railroad&#x27;s formal lease to the Erie. At that time the company had six locomotives, 21 passenger and baggage cars, and 30 freight cars. Not long after, a nominally separate company, the Nyack and Northern Railroad, built from Nyack south to meet the Northern at Sparkill, and from its opening in May 1870 Nyack became the northern terminal for most Northern Railroad trains. The Northern track was changed to standard gauge along with the rest of the Erie system in 1878.

For five miles in Hudson County, Croxton to Granton, the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway ran parallel to the Northern Railroad. Joint stations were constructed between the railroads with platforms on each side. By the time the Susquehanna was leased by the Erie in 1898, the companies operated the parallel section as one multi-track railroad, with the Northern Railroad&#x27;s tracks used mostly for northbound trains. Although the Erie lease ended in 1940, the track-sharing continued to the late 1950s.

The Northern Railroad was mainly a commuter and local line, with significant freight business only near its southern end. Business dropped off in the 1930s, and in 1942 the company&#x27;s property was sold off to its long-term lessor, the Erie. From that time it was the Northern Branch.

=== Erie and Erie Lackawanna ===

By 1954, the Northern Branch had only three rush hour passenger trains each way. Between 1956 and 1958, the allied Erie and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&amp;W) consolidated their diminishing passenger services at the Lackawanna&#x27;s Hoboken Terminal. During transition Erie trains continued to use the Erie Pavonia Terminal for about an hour in each rush hour, to distribute the heaviest crowds. A Northern Branch train was the very last to leave Pavonia Erie Terminal in 1958. Two years later, the Pavonia Terminal was razed in 1961. The two companies merged in 1960 to form the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad.

The Northern Branch ran from Hoboken for only eight years. Operation was complicated by the lack of a direct connection. Trains leaving Hoboken had to run out over the new connection (1956) from the DL&amp;W Boonton Branch to the Erie Main Line, pass a switch which would be thrown, back up about two miles on the former route toward the Erie terminal to where the Northern Branch joined the Erie Main, wait for another switch, and then proceed forward again into the Northern Branch. The move added 15 to 20 minutes to running time.

Because commuter services cost more to run than they earned in fares, the Erie-Lackawanna ended passenger service on several branches in 1966. On the Northern Branch, the entire railroad north of Sparkill was abandoned in January and passenger service on the rest of the branch was eliminated in October. The last timetable, April 24, 1966, shows three rush hour trains each way taking 60 minutes to run from Hoboken to Sparkill, only 10 minutes longer than 1954 schedules because of some station closings. Although freight service on the line continued, service into New York state stopped in the late 1970s after the Continental Can Company in Piermont closed.

=== Conrail &amp; CSX ===
By the consolidation of Erie Lackawanna and Penn Central (among others) into Conrail in 1976, both the West Shore Railroad and the Northern Branch fell under the control of Conrail. As trains accessing the Northern Branch in Jersey City had to go to Journal Square and reverse direction, and the connection included a grade crossing of Newark Avenue, freight trains typically used the New Jersey Junction Railroad and West Shore Railroad, renamed as Conrail&#x27;s River Line, to go through northern New Jersey.

Around 1994, a short elevated track, known as the Marion Running Track, was built to connect the Passaic and Harsimus Line towards Kearny with the Northern Branch. This provided the Northern Branch with a direct connection to other lines heading west and south at Marion Junction.

After the breakup of Conrail in 1999, the Northern Branch was divided. Conrail Shared Assets Operations retained the tracks from Marion Junction to the CSX yard in North Bergen, known as the Northern Running Track. CSX was given the remaining section north to Northvale, in addition to the West Shore Railroad running through the yard, known as the Bergen Subdivision of the River Line.

With New Jersey Transit&#x27;s 2000 creation of the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail on the River Line east of the CSX North Bergen Yard, freight trains needed an alternate route to get to the CSX Albany Division. Trains were re-routed via the Northern Running Track to access the Bergen Subdivision and this part of the Northern Branch became major CSX rail corridor from Upstate New York. At that time, the Northern Running Track was improved to handle the heavier traffic that had formerly used the River Line on the east side of the New Jersey Palisades. New Jersey Transit paid for the project, which included double-tracking the line, changing Marion Junction and Bergen Junction, and building overpasses on Secaucus Road and Paterson Plank Road. The rest of the Northern Branch continues north to the New York state line, and is a minor spur.

== Route guide ==
The Marion Running Track is a short elevated track connecting the Passaic and Harsimus Line towards Kearny with the Northern Branch. It was built around 1994; prior to its opening, trains accessing the Northern Branch had to go to Journal Square and reverse direction, and the connection included a grade crossing of Newark Avenue (which the new connection overpasses). For these reasons, most freight trains instead used the River Line, passing through the Palisades in tunnels twice.

Another grade crossing still exists at Saint Paul&#x27;s Avenue, under the Pulaski Skyway and Truck US 1-9. This is now the only grade crossing on the Northern Running Track. Just north of this crossing, a second track begins; the line is double-tracked from here to the north end.

North of there, the line passes under the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, now part of New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Hoboken Division in the middle of West End Junction. These bridges were built in 1907, before which the tracks crossed at grade.

Just north of the NJ Transit overpasses, the line enters Bergen Junction, and two tracks split to the west from the main line, which heads northwest to Croxton Yard.

Soon the line passes over County Road on a rather old bridge. It then passes under Secaucus Road, whose bridge opened on May 20, 2002. The New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway begins at the Land Bridge Terminal, just north of Secaucus Road, and parallels the Northern Running Track, just to the west, all the way to its end.

The next three overpasses, over which pass the Northeast Corridor, Route 3, and Route 495, have never been grade crossings. The next overpass, Paterson Plank Road, opened on April 22, 2002.

The Northern Running Track ends at North Bergen Yard, at what has been called Granton Junction, and is now CP 2. From here, it splits into two CSX lines, the Bergen Subdivision (which was part of Conrail&#x27;s River Line until most of Conrail&#x27;s assets were split), and CSX&#x27;s Northern Branch. The Bergen Subdivision soon becomes the River Subdivision, and leads along the west side of the Hudson River towards Albany, New York.

Beginning at CP 2, the CSX-owned Northern Branch is a lightly used freight spur that passes through eastern Bergen County, New Jersey, terminating at the state line in Northvale. The line&#x27;s tracks have been removed beginning at the New York border. However, the right-of-way continues as a rail trail heading north as several names - the Joseph B. Clarke Rail-Trail to Piermont, the Old Erie Path to Grand View, and the Raymond G. Esposito Trail to Nyack. There are proposals to use the right-of-way north of Englewood, New Jersey the state line as a rail trail connecting to the Hudson River Valley Greenway.

== Future passenger use ==

New Jersey Transit plans to restore passenger service over a portion of the CSX line between North Bergen and Englewood as an extension of the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail from Tonnelle Avenue, known as the Northern Branch Corridor Project.

<text>Mangonia Park is a Tri-Rail commuter rail station in Mangonia Park, Florida. This is the system&#x27;s northernmost station. The station is located on 45th Street (CR 702), just west of Australian Avenue (CR 704A). There are 273 parking spaces at the station.

==History==
The Mangonia Park station was opened on October 28, 1996, along a former Seaboard Air Line Railroad line, and was the first station to serve the community.

Every January, Palm Beach County Public School safety patrol boards charter an Amtrak train at the station for their annual trip to Washington, D.C. The train operates with a &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; consist plus several Horizon coaches. On the days this train operates, the northbound or southbound &quot;Silver Meteors&quot; are actually canceled since the train uses the equipment that would normally be used for those runs. This is the only time an Amtrak operated train stops at this station.

==Station layout==
Mangonia Park is served by routes 20, 31, and 33 of Palm Tran, the county bus system. These buses serve The Gardens Mall, Downtown West Palm Beach, the VA Medical Center, and Cross County Plaza. The station has two side platforms, with buses and parking adjacent to the Track 1 platform.

<text>Kita is a town and urban commune in western Mali. The town is the capital of the Kita Cercle in the Kayes Region. It lies on the eastern slope of Mount Kita (Bambara: &quot;Kita-kulu&quot;), known for its caves and rock paintings. Today, the town is known for its music, its annual Roman Catholic pilgrimage and its role as a processing center for the surrounding cotton- and peanut-growing region. Kita lies on the Dakar-Niger Railway and is the largest transit hub between Bamako (112 miles) and Kayes (205 miles). In the 2018 census the urban commune had a population of 463,787.

In November 1955, Kita became a commune of average exercise. On March 2, 1966, Kita became a commune of full exercise. The town grew in the 1990s around the cotton industry, but this has since declined.

A fictionalized version of Kita features as the setting for Malian author Massa Makan Diabaté&#x27;s &quot;Kouta Trilogy&quot; (Le lieutenant de Kouta, Le coiffeur de Kouta, and Le boucher de Kouta).

==History==

=== Name ===
Kita proper has been called with different names throughout history. One of its earliest names was &quot;Guénou Kourou&quot;.

However, a second name &quot;Sediousaba&quot; had been used for the small village, or rather an area in the town.

=== Birth &amp; Settlements ===
Two major settlements have been considered the birth of the town of Kita, however the order of these settlements are still subjects to debate. One of the settlements was attributed to the Tounkara traders from Ouagadou, the Ghana empire. Their chief, Diouna Tounkara, created &quot;Sediousaba&quot;, which means &quot;Three shea trees&quot; as mentioned above. The second settlement was attributed to a Guinea trader, Siema Toloba Kamara, who created a village called &quot;Fatali. Later, Siema Toloba Kamara and Diouna Tounkara allied with each other to form a new village called &quot;Linguékoto&quot;.

== Population ==
In the Health Minister&#x27;s 2018 census, Kita had a population of 463,787, while in 2020, the urban area of Kita counted 65,908.

==Climate==
Kita has a fairly dry tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;) with a hot to sweltering and arid dry season from November to late May and a hot, steamy wet season from late May to October. There is negligible rain and very low humidity in the dry season, whilst in the wet season rainfall totals around with oppressive and uncomfortable humidity.
==Notable residents==
* Sekou Koita, International Soccer player
* Bako Dagnon, female griot
* Cheick Hamala Diabate, griot and Afropop musician

<doc id="1338863" wikidata="Q242722" url="?curid=1338863" title="Kelly LeBrock">
<text>Kelly LeBrock (born March 24, 1960) is an American actress and model. Her acting debut was in &quot;The Woman in Red&quot; (1984), alongside Gene Wilder. She also starred in the John Hughes film &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1985), and in &quot;Hard to Kill&quot; (1990), opposite her then-husband Steven Seagal.

==Early life==
Kelly LeBrock was born in New York City, and was brought up in the Kensington area of London. Her father was French-Canadian, and her mother, Maria, is of Northern Irish descent. LeBrock was named after her grandmother, Mary Helen Kelly, from Keady, County Armagh.

==Career==
===Modelling===
LeBrock began her career as a model at age 16 in her birth city of New York. Her breakthrough came at 19, when she starred in a 24-page spread in &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine. Shortly afterwards, she entered into a contract with Christian Dior to work for that fashion label for 30 days a year. She subsequently appeared on numerous magazine covers and in fashion spreads, and became one of Eileen Ford&#x27;s most sought-after models. She became especially recognisable as the Pantene shampoo commercial spokeswoman whose line, &quot;Don&#x27;t hate me because I&#x27;m beautiful&quot;, became a pop culture catchphrase.

===Film===
LeBrock was cast as the &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;fantasy&quot; woman in the films &quot;The Woman in Red&quot; (1984) and &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1985). As a result, she was considered one of the sexiest women in Hollywood in the 1980s, and was in high demand, but took a hiatus from acting until 1990. Her return to the big screen started in 1990 when she starred opposite her then-husband, Steven Seagal, in &quot;Hard to Kill&quot;. LeBrock also appeared in &quot;Betrayal of the Dove&quot; (1993), &quot;Tracks of a Killer&quot; (1995) and &quot;Hard Bounty&quot; (1995).

She had roles in the films &quot;Wrongfully Accused&quot; (1998), &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (2001), &quot;Zerophilia&quot; (2005) and &quot;&quot; (2006). LeBrock was in a thriller entitled &quot;Hidden Affairs&quot;, released in 2013, and in 2015 she appeared in &quot;A Prince for Christmas&quot; as Queen Ariana.

===Television===
In 2005, LeBrock was the captain of the team &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Bellies&quot; on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot; reality show. She also appeared on the third UK series of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;. She and her daughter Arissa were featured on the Lifetime docuseries &quot;Growing Up Supermodel&quot; which debuted in August 2017.

===In popular culture===
British band Bastille released the song &quot;Good Grief&quot; in 2016, which samples two of LeBrock&#x27;s lines from &quot;Weird Science&quot;: &quot;So what would you little maniacs like to do first?&quot; and &quot;If you want to be a party animal, you have to learn to live in the jungle. Now stop worrying and go and get dressed.&quot;

==Personal life==
Her first marriage was to film producer and restaurateur Victor Drai, in 1984; they divorced in 1986. During this time she met actor and martial artist Steven Seagal. Their daughter Annaliza was born in spring 1987 and the couple married in September of that year. Their son Dominic was born in June 1990 and their daughter Arissa in 1993. The following year, LeBrock filed for divorce.

In July 2007, LeBrock married retired investment banker Fred Steck; they divorced the following year. By 2011, LeBrock lived on a ranch in California&#x27;s Santa Ynez Valley. After the death of her brother Harold in 2008, LeBrock began devoting time to the terminally ill. She has been a spokeswoman for Club Carson, a foundation for children suffering from cancer.

<doc id="1338867" wikidata="Q5599625" url="?curid=1338867" title="Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve">
<text>The Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve encompasses a large part (some 85%) of the island of Great Nicobar, the largest of the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Nicobars lie in the Bay of Bengal, eastern Indian Ocean, to the north of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The reserve has a total core area of approximately 885 km2, surrounded by a 12 km-wide &quot;forest buffer zone&quot;. In year 2013 it was included in the list of Man and Biosphere program of UNESCO to promote sustainable development based on local community effort and sound science.

The reserve was formality created in January 2013. It incorporates two National parks of India, which were gazetted in 1992: the larger Campbell Bay National Park on the northern part of the island, and Galathea National Park in the southern interior. The non-Biosphere portions of the island (set aside for agriculture, forestry and settlements) are confined to the southwestern and southeastern coastal reaches.

The reserve has a total area of 103,870 ha. The core area of 53,623 ha comprises Cambell Bay and Galathea national parks. A buffer area of 34,877 ha includes forested lands adjacent to and between the two parks. There is also a transitional area of 10,070 ha, including 5,300 marine hectares.

<doc id="1338869" wikidata="Q2352936" url="?curid=1338869" title="Replicas (album)">
<text>Replicas is the second and final studio album by the English new wave band Tubeway Army, released on 6 April 1979 by Beggars Banquet Records. It followed their self-titled debut from the previous year. After this, Tubeway Army frontman Gary Numan would continue to release records under his own name, though the musicians in Tubeway Army would continue to work with him for some time. &quot;Replicas&quot; was the first album of what Numan later termed the &quot;machine&quot; phase of his career, preceding &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; (1979) and &quot;Telekon&quot; (1980), a collection linked by common themes of a dystopian science fiction future and transmutation of man/machine, coupled with an androgynous image and a synthetic rock sound.

Fuelled by a surprise No. 1 hit single, &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot;, the album also reached No. 1 in the UK charts in July 1979 and was certified Gold by the BPI for sales in excess of 100,000 copies.

==Background==
A loose concept album, &quot;Replicas&quot; was based on a dystopian book Numan hoped to eventually complete, set in a not-too-distant future metropolis where Machmen (androids with cloned human skin) and other machines keep the general public cowed on orders from the Grey Men (shadowy officials). While the album&#x27;s setting and lyrics were directly inspired by the science fiction of Philip K. Dick, particularly his seminal work &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, the title was not. Although Numan&#x27;s Machmen were similar to replicants, the term used for androids in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (based on Dick&#x27;s book), Scott&#x27;s film came out three years after Tubeway Army&#x27;s album and Dick never used the word &quot;replicant&quot; in his original 1968 novel. The album cover shows Numan as a Machman staring out from his room at a waning crescent moon hovering above &quot;The Park&quot; as a barely visible man stands outside while Numan&#x27;s reflection stares back at himself.

==Recording and music==
&quot;Replicas&quot; was recorded in late 1978 at Gooseberry Studios, London and completed in February 1979 with overdubs and remixing at Marcus Music Studios.

Musically, Numan&#x27;s main influence was the commercially unsuccessful John Foxx-led incarnation of Ultravox. Tracks like &quot;Speed of Life&quot; and &quot;Breaking Glass&quot; from David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Low&quot; were also cited, along with Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; album, in particular the long and wistful track &quot;Neon Lights&quot;.

The recording built upon the sound of the first &quot;Tubeway Army&quot; album. While the tracks &quot;The Machman&quot;, &quot;You Are in My Vision&quot; and &quot;It Must Have Been Years&quot; recalled the earlier album&#x27;s guitar-oriented rock, the rest were built solidly around an analog synthesizer, the Minimoog. Along with &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot;, this included &quot;Me! I Disconnect from You&quot;, the atmospheric &quot;Down in the Park&quot; (released as a single prior to the album and acquiring cult status though not commercial success), the multi-layered title track and the closing instrumentals &quot;When the Machines Rock&quot; and &quot;I Nearly Married a Human&quot;, the latter featuring Numan&#x27;s first use of a primitive drum machine; it appeared the following year in Carl Sagan&#x27;s TV series &quot;&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Smash Hits&quot; reviewer Red Starr found the album to have &quot;Strong futuristic imagery, simple but catchy melodies and riffs, haunting synthesiser work — all strikingly delivered in distinctive fashion. Intriguing and definitely different — a good one.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; deemed the album &quot;weird synthesizer effects and fashionably adenoidal songs and vocals over an accessibly rocking rhythm section.&quot;

==Legacy==

&quot;Replicas&quot;&#x27; synthesizer sound and occasionally nihilistic lyrics greatly impacted the industrial acts that came to prominence in the mid-1990s such as Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails, both of whom covered Numan&#x27;s songs on record. Both Manson and Foo Fighters released versions of &quot;Down in the Park&quot;. &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; was covered by a number of artists, and was most notably the basis for Sugababes&#x27; No. 1 hit &quot;Freak Like Me&quot; in 2002. Numan has continued to play tracks from &quot;Replicas&quot; on his live tours, with &quot;Me! I Disconnect from You&quot;, &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; and &quot;Down in the Park&quot; being mainstays, whilst &quot;Praying to the Aliens&quot; and &quot;Replicas&quot; have also lately become part of his live repertoire.

==Reissue==
The 1999 and 2008 reissue editions included several bonus tracks, including three single B-sides: &quot;We Are So Fragile&quot; (from &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot;), and &quot;Do You Need the Service?&quot; and &quot;I Nearly Married a Human (2)&quot; (from &quot;Down in the Park&quot;). &quot;The Crazies&quot;, &quot;Only a Downstat&quot; and &quot;We Have a Technical&quot; were outtakes from the &quot;Replicas&quot; sessions.

<doc id="1338870" wikidata="Q7362740" url="?curid=1338870" title="Romano cheese">
<text>Romano cheese is a term used in the United States and Canada for a class of hard, salty cheese suitable primarily for grating. It is the American imitation of &quot;pecorino romano&quot;, from which the name is derived; in spite of the &quot;Romano&quot; name, it should not be confused with genuine &quot;pecorino romano&quot;, which is an Italian product recognized and protected by the laws of the European Union, although United States law allows Romano produced entirely from sheep&#x27;s milk to be called &quot;pecorino romano&quot;. 

Per U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, Romano cheese can be made from cow, goat, and/or sheep&#x27;s milk. It must contain less than 34% water and at least 38% milkfat. Cream, skim milk and/or dry milk and water can be added or removed to create the correct level of milkfat. Milk can be bleached with benzoyl peroxide or a mixture of benzoyl peroxide with potassium alum, calcium sulfate, and magnesium carbonate but, in that case, vitamin A must be added after treatment. Safe artificial blue or green coloring may be added only to counter any yellow coloring of the milk. Rennet does not need to be used and any &quot;suitable milk-clotting enzyme that produces equivalent curd formation&quot; may be used. Curd must be broken up to the size of corn kernels, stirred and heated to . The curd is drained, pressed into forms and the cheese is then soaked in brine for 24 hours. After brining, it is rubbed with salt and washed several times. Next it is dry-cured. It is occasionally turned and scraped, and may be coated with vegetable oil. Romano must be aged at least five months.

<text>The Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources is a department of the government of the U.S. state of Virginia that regulates wildlife conservation.

==History==
The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries was created on June 17, 1916, under the Commission of Fisheries with M.D. &quot;Mac&quot; Hart appointed as Secretary of the Department. A Virginia hunting license was established as one of the primary sources of funding as the agency is fully self-sufficient and receiving no financial support from the state treasury. From 1903 until this point the Game Wardens had been administered by each locality. In 1920, the first Virginia State Game Farm of 1200 acres was established at Windsor Shades in New Kent County. In 1923, Mrs B. M. Miller and Mrs. C. E. Sykes are recognized among Virginia&#x27;s first women game wardens. In 1926, the Department was separated from the Commission of Fisheries and reorganized into the Commission of Game and Inland Fisheries chaired by A. Willis Robertson. In 1928 the Commission of Game and Inland Fisheries was given sole authority to shorten hunting seasons, removing the privilege from the localities to adjust their own season. In 1982, Virginia Game Wardens were given full law enforcement authority. In 1987, the commission&#x27;s name returns to become the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries.

On July 1, 2020, the Department&#x27;s name was changed to Department of Wildlife Resources.

==Conservation police officers ==
The law enforcement officers of the department have the title conservation police officer. Conservation police officers enforce Virginia laws relating to hunting, fishing, and boating; conduct patrols in cars, aircraft, all-terrain vehicles, and boats, and on foot; and investigate tips from the public. Virginia conservation police officers are also appointed as deputy U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service special agents, which allows them to investigate (and cross state lines to investigate) suspected violations of federal wildlife laws. Virginia game wardens were first appointed in 1903. The title was changed to &quot;conservation police officer&quot; in 2007.

Since the establishment of the department, eleven officers have died while on duty. In the 1920s and 1930s, five game wardens died from gunfire, and two game wardens died from drowning/pneumonia. Two additional officers were fatally shot in 1952 and 1960. On December 19, 1972, two game wardens died in an aircraft accident.

<doc id="1338876" wikidata="Q4795463" url="?curid=1338876" title="Aro Valley">
<text>The Aro Valley forms a small inner-city suburb of Wellington in New Zealand. It takes its name from the stream which originally flowed where modern Hōniana Te Puni (formerly Epuni) Street is. The stream&#x27;s Māori name was originally Wai-Mapihi, but it was commonly called Te Aro Stream due to it running through the Te Aro flat.

== Geography ==
The Aro Valley is 126 hectares running between the hills of Brooklyn to the south, and Kelburn to the north, with the area of Karori to the west and Te Aro, the city centre to the east.

Much of Wellington consists of the remnants of an old peneplain, a flat expanse that rose from the sea about 20 million years ago. This land was heavily dissected by watercourses from that time and today the tops of the hills around Wellington indicate the general height of that eroded peneplain. During this time massive faults appeared that are still active today.

Aro Valley formed from fault activity. One kilometre to the west of Aro Valley is the Wellington Fault running north-east along the foot of the Tinakori Hills and beyond. A series of splinter faults branch off from the Wellington Fault. Activity along these faults over millions of years caused tilting of the land to create valleys, including Aro Valley, south-east of the main fault.

Aro Valley, and its tributary valleys, are well sheltered from the wind and have soil enriched by past alluvial deposits. The valley walls are steep in places and house sites are correspondingly uneven, in typical Wellington fashion.

The valley comprises part of the bed of the Wai-Mapihi Stream. Aro Street runs through the whole valley, from Willis Street in the east to Raroa Road in the west; major side-streets include Devon Street, Hōniana Te Puni Street, Adams Terrace, Mitchelltown&#x27;s Holloway Road and Taitville&#x27;s Norway Street.

==Parks==

A prominent feature of Aro Valley is Aro Park, which is the site of the former Matauranga School, which was itself on the site of the original Catholic school – St Mary of the Angels. The Park was formerly known as Seed&#x27;s Hill after an early (1864) resident, Mr. Wm. Seed. The Park has been extended and landscaped in recent years and is a focus for community recreation, especially on summer nights and weekends; the Aro Valley Community Centre stands on part of the park.

in 2017 Wellington Council purchased a considerable area of land to the north west border of Aro Park which will form part of the Wellington Town Belt.

Aro Valley is almost surrounded by parkland the Aro Park to the north, Polhill Gully Recreation Reserve to the Northwest and Tanera Reserve &amp; Central Park to the Southeast.

=== Polhill Gully ===
Polhill Reserve (Waimapihi Reserve) – on the western end of Aro Street – was named for the early settler, Baker Polhill. After his arrival in 1841 aboard the &quot;Oriental&quot;, Polhill started a business selling timber harvested from the gully. Although he did not own the land, it became known as Polhill&#x27;s Gully. The area was originally a cultivation for Te Aro Māori.

By the 1960s Victoria University was considering Polhill Gully and Holloway Road as potential sites for its own expansion and began buying houses but by the 1970s the plans were being actively challenged by a new generation of Mitchelltown residents who felt the houses and the neighbourhood were worth saving, and by others who envisaged the restoration of Polhill Gully for wildlife habitat and recreational use. Discussion, disagreement and protest went on for years, and the university finally abandoned its plans in the early 1980s. Polhill Gully became a City Council Recreation Reserve in 1989.

In 2021, Wellington City Council changed the name from Polhill Gully to Waimapihi Reserve.

Today the reserve is an attractive amenity used by more than a thousand cyclists, runners and walkers a week. It is also frequented by birds, including—thanks to the proximity of the Zealandia wildlife sanctuary—many tūī and kākā, and the occasional bellbird, grey warbler, North Island robin and saddleback.

== History ==
The Aro Valley today is a largely untouched remnant of old Wellington, with the majority of its dwellings dating from the first two decades of the twentieth century, and a significant number from the nineteenth. The Wellington City Council notes: &quot;The Valley projects a strong sense of place due to its geographical separation from other parts of the city, the enclosure of the valley walls and the relative consistency of development within.&quot;

=== Nineteenth century ===
Early tribal occupants of the Aro Valley included Ngāti Mutunga, Ngāti Ruanui, Muaūpoko and Ngāti Mamoe. In the 1830s Taranaki iwi Te Āti Awa settled at its western end. The stream itself was an important food source for Māori. It was called Waimapihi – in Maori, &quot;the stream or bathing place&quot; of Mapihi, a local chieftainess of Muaūpoko and Ngāti Mamoe descent. These small communities adapted as best they could to the influx of British settlers that began in 1840, but they took a blow in 1855 when an earthquake raised the low-lying land draining the marshes and cutting off their main source of both food and flax for trading. This misfortune, combined with widespread illness, migration back to Taranaki to settle land disputes, and pressure from settlers for land, gradually saw the Māori population of Te Aro dwindle.

The land was part of the New Zealand Company purchase in 1839. It was first developed by settler Wellingtonians as a working-class residential suburb in around 1860, the Aro Valley featured small, narrow sections with closely built wooden or corrugated-iron houses.

In the 1840 Plan of Wellington, the Aro Valley consisted of Wordsworth, Aro and Hōniana Te Puni Streets, as well as St John Street, which connected Aro Street and what became known as The Terrace. Of the 13 freehold acres available for European settlers, nine were in Hōniana Te Puni Street. European settlement grew as Maori left the area, including Te Āti Awa who returned to Taranaki in the 1850–60s. Also, in 1855, the opening of the Old Bullock Track meant the valley became an access route for Karori settlers. The only other route to Karori followed what is now Glenmore Street from Thorndon.

Devon Street in the north of Aro Valleys principal developer, William Adams and Elizabeth Adams, came from the Southern UK county of Devon. He purchased land here in 1885 and some of the houses built were occupied by his son and daughter in law Maxwell and Lila Adams.

=== Twentieth century ===

A route of the Wellington tramway system was opened in 1904, connecting Aro Street to the Wellington railway station via the city centre; it closed in 1957.

In the 1960s, &quot;The Evening Post&quot; described Holloway Road (a street originally known as Mitchelltown on the western edge of Aro Valley) as &quot;sagging stairways with most of the tread rotted away&quot;, leading to &quot;sagging, open doors and damp, musty rooms where glass from broken windows crunches underfoot&quot;.

Matauranga School was a progressive primary school set up by Marie Bell and parents of Aro Valley in 1963 and was a pioneer for the &#x27;free-play&#x27; method of pre-schooling within New Zealand. In 1967 it became a full primary school. The school closed in 1982 after teachers Marie Bell and Mike Regan left the school. The site became the current Park and Community centre in 1983 after residents fought the City Council that had &quot;promise[d] to create community open space in the old asphalt schoolyard known as Matauranga [school]&quot; 

Gentrification has been ongoing in Aro Valley from the 1970s, boosted by urban-renewal planning (the Comprehensive Urban Renewal Area or CURA) after the rejection of a proposal to turn the valley into a main arterial road route: it became a desirable suburb, seen as close to the centre of Wellington and boasting notable community spirit. The Aro Valley Community Council was established in 1978 and was followed by the building of the Aro Valley Community Centre.

In 1974, the Aro Street public toilets were the scene of a Russian spy drama, when economist, historian and writer Bill Sutch was caught and charged with attempting to pass classified information to the Soviet Union. (Sutch was later acquitted.)

Aro Valley contains the largest collection of unaltered working-class homes in Wellington, some built by local tradesmen for employees, many put up by professional builders and developers as speculative investments. Many of the buildings used as shops along Aro Street and a number of houses on Aro Street and Holloway Road are protected by designation on Wellington City Council Heritage List. 

Many of Aro Valley&#x27;s older houses have serious problems with damp and mould, particularly those on the shadier side of the valley. One study found that as many as 40% of Aro Valley houses were damp. Despite this, Aro Valley remains a popular location for students to live due to its proximity to the University. 

As of 2021, 59% of homes in Aro Valley were non-owner occupied (rentals) and the median rental price was $631. Between 2017 and 2021 the median sale price for a house in Aro Valley increased from $680,000 to $1.15 million.

== Demographics ==
Aro Valley statistical area, which includes Highbury, covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Aro Valley had a population of 3,762 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 141 people (3.9%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 330 people (9.6%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,410 households, comprising 1,890 males and 1,875 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.01 males per female. The median age was 27.9 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 303 people (8.1%) aged under 15 years, 1,764 (46.9%) aged 15 to 29, 1,440 (38.3%) aged 30 to 64, and 258 (6.9%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 84.8% European/Pākehā, 9.3% Māori, 3.1% Pasifika, 10.5% Asian, and 3.8% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 31.8, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 68.8% had no religion, 17.3% were Christian, 0.3% had Māori religious beliefs, 1.8% were Hindu, 1.0% were Muslim, 1.1% were Buddhist and 5.2% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 1,611 (46.6%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 120 (3.5%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $29,600, compared with $31,800 nationally. 723 people (20.9%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,794 (51.9%) people were employed full-time, 684 (19.8%) were part-time, and 258 (7.5%) were unemployed.

== Sociology ==
Aro Valley also adjoins parts of Victoria University (mainly to the north), and a large number of Valley residents study there or at Massey University to the east. Despite the gentrification sometimes known as &quot;yuppification&quot; of the suburb, it keeps its reputation as a home to politico-social radicals. The area has a strong community council campaigning on a variety of issues such as eliminating plastic bag use in local shops. 

Alexandra Hollis writes in &quot;Salient&quot; that &quot;although Aro is this liberal, artsy enclave, it is also very aware of this reputation.&quot; Illustrating this artiness young film-makers based in Wellington in the late 90s and 2000 were dubbed the Aro Valley movement, they made feature-length narrative dramas, which they edited and assembled on computer editing suites.

==Politics==

Politically, Aro Valley has become a stronghold or &quot;spiritual home&quot; of the Green Party. In the 2011 general election, the Aro Valley Community Centre was the polling station with the most number of ballots for the Green Party in the country (619), and also was amongst the top polling stations in terms of percentage support for the Greens (at 44%).

Before every general election the Aro Valley candidates meeting is held in the Aro Valley community hall. The atmosphere of the meetings can make them intimidating for candidates, who often face heckling from the audience.

== Education ==
===School enrollment zone===
Aro Valley is within the enrolment zones for Wellington College, Wellington Girls&#x27; College, Wellington High School, Wellington East Girls&#x27; College, St Oran&#x27;s College and Te Aro School.

=== Aro Valley Pre-School===
Aro Valley Pre-School is a licensed early childhood education centre in a purpose-built building situated next to the Aro Valley Community Centre and Aro Park. The pre-school caters to children aged three and four years old, with some younger children attending accompanied by their parents. Once a week they also facilitate a parent-led playgroup for children under three.

<text>The 2004 Memorial Cup (branded as the 2004 [[Mastercard]] Memorial Cup for sponsorship reasons) occurred May 15–23 at Prospera Place in Kelowna, British Columbia. It was the 86th annual Memorial Cup competition and determined the major junior ice hockey champion of the Canadian Hockey League (CHL). It featured the host team, the Kelowna Rockets as well as the winners of the Ontario Hockey League, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and the Western Hockey League which were the Guelph Storm, Gatineau Olympiques and the Medicine Hat Tigers respectively. The Kelowna Rockets would be the eventual winners, and would become only the fourth host team to win without winning their league as well. (The first time was in 1983, when the Portland Winter Hawks won it, the second was in 1993 when the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds won it, and the third was in 1999 when the Ottawa 67&#x27;s won it.) Kelowna defeated the Olympiques who made their second straight Memorial Cup final, but as with 2003, the &#x27;Piques came up short. Kelowna also participated in the 2003 tournament as WHL champions but did not advance to the final, and would participate as WHL champions in the 2005 Memorial Cup as well.

<text>Kallaroo is one of the four &#x27;Whitfords&#x27; suburbs in Perth that resulted from the Western Australian Government rezoning large areas of coastal land for development in 1969.

Kallaroo was chosen as a suburb name in 1970 and is an Aboriginal word meaning ‘road to the water’. The suburb is home to one primary school, Springfield Primary School, which was named after the original housing estate. The school was established in 1972, with four demountable classrooms and 179 students. A permanent school was built for the 1973 educational year with six classrooms in the main building. Also in the construction was an administrative and library buildings. The new school oval was sand and limestone rocks for the first year and after many student injuries, a new grassed oval was ready for the 1974 educational year.
Street names in the Kallaroo are predominantly after shipwrecks, including famous West Australian shipwrecks, such as the &quot;Batavia&quot;.

The land west of Dampier Avenue was developed during the mid-late 1980s and, although part of Kallaroo, is known as Northshore, in reference to the project name of the housing estate.

<text>The St. Louis Car Company was a major United States manufacturer of railroad passenger cars, streetcars, interurbans, trolleybuses and locomotives. It operated from 1887 to 1974 and was based in St. Louis, Missouri.

==History==
The St. Louis Car Company was formed in April 1887 to manufacture and sell streetcars and other kinds of rolling stock of street and steam railways supporting the traction industry. In succeeding years the company built automobiles, including the American Mors, the Skelton, and the Standard Six. The St. Louis Aircraft Corporation division of the company partnered with the Huttig Sash and Door company in 1917 to produce aircraft. During the two world wars, the company manufactured gliders, trainers, alligators, flying boats, and dirigible gondolas. Among their most successful products were the Birney Safety Car and the PCC streetcar, a design that was very popular at the time.

The firm went on to build some of the vehicles used in the transit systems of New York City and Chicago, as well as the FM OP800 railcars manufactured exclusively for the Southern Railway in 1939.

The St. Louis Car Company was headed by Edwin B. Meissner Sr., who died at age 71 on Sept. 12, 1956. Meissner was president of the company, one of the nation&#x27;s largest manufacturers of railroad and light rail cars, and the St. Louis Aircraft Corporation. He was active for many years on the Jewish Federation Board of Directors, and served for over 20 years as President of Congregation Shaare Emeth.

The St. Louis Car Co., later known as General Steel Industries, manufactured St. Louis streetcars and trolleys and cars for far-flung transit systems such as the Paris Metro in France. Meissner&#x27;s son, Edwin B. Meissner Jr., succeeded his father as head of the company, and continues to be an active member of Congregation Shaare Emeth.

Streetcars held sway in St. Louis and its suburbs from the 1880s until the mid- and late 1940s. Andrew Young records that new state-of-the-art buses began to encroach on the streetcars domain. New streamlined streetcars were brought into service in 1946 to replace older cars, some dating back to 1903.

In 1960, St. Louis Car Company was acquired by General Steel Industries. In 1964, St. Louis Car completed an order of 430 World&#x27;s Fair picture-window cars (R36 WF) for the New York City Subway and was building 162 PA-1s (110 single units, 52 trailers) for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for their use on the Port Authority Trans-Hudson line to New Jersey. Also in the mid-1960s, the company completed building the passenger capsules, designed by Planet Corporation, to ferry visitors to the top of the Gateway Arch at the Gateway Arch National Park (then known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial) in St. Louis, Missouri.

St. Louis Car continued business until 1968 and ceased operations in 1974. The final St. Louis Car products were R44 subway cars for the New York City Subway and Staten Island Rapid Transit, and the USDOT State of the Art Car rapid transit demonstrator set whose design was based on the R44.

The St. Louis Car assembly plant and general office at 8000 Hall Street, St. Louis is now the St. Louis Business Center, a mixed use industrial and commercial complex redeveloped starting in 2005.
