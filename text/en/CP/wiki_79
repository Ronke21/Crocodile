<text>1916 United States House of Representatives elections were elections for the United States House of Representatives to elect members to serve in the 65th United States Congress. They were held for the most part on November 7, 1916, while Maine held theirs on September 11. They coincided with the re-election of President Woodrow Wilson.

Wilson eked out a narrow re-election, but his Democratic Party lost seats to the Republican Party. Wilson&#x27;s hybrid approach, which injected a progressive element into Democratic policies, had proved to be dissatisfying to much of the nation. International affairs also became important in the traditionally non-interventionist United States, as voters attempted to determine which party would be best served to keep the nation from entering the Great War.

Republicans won a plurality of seats in the 1916 election. However, when the 65th Congress convened in April 1917, the Democrats narrowly maintained control of the House, forming an alliance with third-party (Progressive and Socialist) members. Not since the 34th Congress (1855–1857) had the party with the most seats not been part of the ruling government. This Congress is the last example to date of a type of coalition holding power in the House, rather than a single party winning a majority of seats. This was also the last time that no party in the house held an overall majority.

Jeannette Rankin, a Republican from Montana, became the first woman ever elected to congress.

==Election summaries==


The Democrats retained control of the House by forming a coalition with the three Progressive members and the single Socialist member, combining to form a razor-thin majority of 218 Representatives.

==Early election date==
Maine held its election early, on September 11, 1916. There had previously been multiple states with earlier elections, but between 1914 and 1958, Maine was alone in holding early elections.

== Special elections ==
There were special elections in 1916 to the 64th United States Congress.

Special elections are sorted by date then district.

<text>Riesco Island () lies at west of the Brunswick Peninsula, Chile. It is one of the largest islands in Chile, with an area of . Its highest point is Mount Atalaya at . The island is bordered by two large piedmont embayments: Otway Sound and Skyring Sound. The narrow Fitzroy Channel connects both bodies of water and separates the island from mainland Patagonia. The island is separated from the southern part of the Muñoz Gamero Peninsula by another narrow channel, the Geronimo Channel.

Riesco Island hosts Chile&#x27;s largest known coal reserves, with mining activities dating back to 1880. There were the mines &quot;Magdalena&quot;, &quot;Elena&quot; and &quot;Josefina&quot;. In 1940 &quot;Magdalena&quot; and &quot;Josefina&quot; produced 100,000 tons. It is thought to contain more than 300 million tonnes of low-quality coal in three deposits located in the colonized portion of the island: &quot;Río Eduardo&quot;, &quot;Elena&quot; and &quot;Estancia Invierno&quot;.

Numerous glaciers can be found on other parts of the island. In the northwest, an icefield is the source of 7 glaciers and &quot;Cerro Ladrillero&quot; has 12 glaciers on its slopes. In the southwestern portion of the island, &quot;Córdova Peninsula&quot; marks the eastern limit of the Strait of Magellan and is home to several mountain glaciers.

<text>A lap-lap is a waistcloth or loincloth worn in Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific. This item of clothing has three parts: a front flap, a back flap, and a thread to tie them around the waist. The sides are generally open. How much is covered by the front and back flaps varies. 

Related to the lap-lap is the lava-lava, which is an all-round rectangular cloth worn like a kilt or skirt by Polynesians.

This description refers to the traditional, pre-colonial period, costume. The current usage is broader than this:
&#x27;Laplap: a waistcloth, a loincloth, any cloth material or dry goods, a rag&#x27;. It is a Fijian word that is also used in Western Melanesia.{&quot;op. cit.&quot;, p. 120}

<text>1914 United States House of Representatives elections were elections for the United States House of Representatives to elect members to serve in the 64th United States Congress. They were held for the most part on November 3, 1914, while Maine held theirs on September 14. They were held in the middle of President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s first term.

The opposition Republican Party had recovered from the split they underwent during the 1912 presidential election, and the party gained more than 60 seats from the Democratic Party, though not enough to regain control of the body. The burgeoning economy greatly aided Republicans, who pushed for probusiness principles and took credit for the success that had been reached in the industrial sector. Many progressive Republicans rejoined the Republican Party, but six remained under the Progressive Party banner in the new Congress. In addition, William Kent was re-elected in as an independent, and two minor party candidates were elected: Charles H. Randall, a Prohibition Party member, in ; and Meyer London, a Socialist Party member, in .

The election was the first of four times in the 20th century in which either party won the House majority without winning the popular vote, with the subsequent three instances occurring in 1942, 1952, and 1996; Democrats won the House majority without winning the popular vote in the former election, while Republicans did so in the latter two.

==Election summaries==


==Early election date==
Maine held its elections early, on September 14, 1914. There had previously been multiple states with earlier elections, but Maine was the only one remaining by 1914 (after Vermont stopped holding its elections early, after 1912). Maine would continue to hold elections early, in September, until 1958.

<text>Ekaterina &quot;Katia&quot; Alexandrovna Gordeeva (; born 28 May 1971) is a Soviet and Russian figure skater. With her late husband Sergei Grinkov, she is the 1988 and 1994 Olympic Champion, a four-time World Champion (1986, 1987, 1989, 1990), a three-time European Champion (1988, 1990, 1994), the 1990 Goodwill Games champion, 1987 Soviet champion, and 1994 Russian champion in pair skating. After Grinkov&#x27;s death, Gordeeva continued performing as a singles skater.

== Early life ==
Gordeeva was born on 28 May 1971 in Moscow, Russia, then part of the Soviet Union. Her father, Alexander Alexeyevich Gordeev, is a dancer for the Alexandrov Song and Dance Ensemble, while her mother, Elena Lvovna Gordeeva, is a teletype operator for TASS. Gordeeva has a younger sister. Gordeeva has stated, &quot;[My father] worked with me on movement very often when I was little.&quot;

== Pairs career ==
Gordeeva began figure skating at age four, when she entered Children and Youth Sports School of CSKA Moscow. She wore multiple pairs of socks inside skates many sizes too big because skates small enough for her feet were unavailable in the Soviet Union. She was not a particularly strong jumper, and in August 1981, coach Vladimir Zaharov paired the 10-year-old Gordeeva with the 14-year-old Sergei Grinkov. Because Grinkov frequently missed practice, their coach eventually insisted that Gordeeva pair with someone else, but she refused. Instead, the pair changed coaches.

Gordeeva and Grinkov won the 1985 World Junior Figure Skating Championships in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The following year they won the first of their four World Figure Skating Championships. They are one of the few pair teams to win back-to-back junior and senior world championship titles. They successfully defended their world title in 1987. In November 1987, Grinkov caught a blade on the ice during a practice session and dropped Gordeeva on her forehead. She was hospitalized for a time, but they were still able to compete in and win a gold medal at the 1988 Winter Olympics, which began the following February in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. They remain the youngest pairs team ever to win Olympic gold. After a fall in their long program, they took silver at the World Championships in 1988, but reclaimed the title in 1989 and 1990. They turned professional in the fall 1990, winning their first World Professional Championship in 1991. They also won that title in 1992 and 1994.

Gordeeva and Grinkov won almost every competition they entered. In the 31 competitions whose results are known at the senior and professional levels, they finished first 24 times and never lower than second place from the time they won their first senior world title. They are one of the few pair teams in history to successfully complete a quadruple twist lift in international competition. They landed the difficult element with ease at the 1987 World Championships. They also completed the element at the 1987 European Championships, but due to a problem with Grinkov&#x27;s boot strap and a misunderstanding about the rules (the referee signaled them to stop, going so far as to turn off their music, but they continued skating), they were disqualified from that event. They stopped performing the quad twist because it made no significant improvement to their marks, making the added physical stress unnecessary. Katia writes in her book, &quot;My Sergei: A Love Story,&quot; that this element raised her heart rate and blood pressure to levels that alarmed the Soviet team&#x27;s doctors. &quot;That summer we had learned a very difficult move called the quadruple split twist,&quot; she wrote, &quot;in which Sergei threw me in the air, I did a split, then closed my legs and made four turns before he caught me. We were the only pair to do this quadruple element, and it was very exhausting—more exhausting than difficult, really. Soviet doctors had measured my pulse rate as exceeding two hundred beats per minute when I did it.&quot;

By 1989, the skating partnership had grown into a romantic relationship. They shared their first kiss on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1988 and were married in April 1991. Their state wedding was on 20 April and the church wedding was on 28 April. From November 1991 through April 1992, they toured with Stars on Ice for the first time. On 11 September 1992, their daughter, Daria Sergeyevna Grinkova, was born in Morristown, New Jersey. Shortly after Daria&#x27;s birth, Gordeeva resumed training for the new season of Stars on Ice, which premiered in November 1992 and continued through the following April. 

When a new ISU rule allowed professional skaters to regain their Olympic eligibility, Gordeeva and Grinkov decided to return to amateur competition for the 1993–94 season and skate in the Olympics. In 1994, the couple won their second Olympic gold medal in Lillehammer, Oppland, Norway.

After the Olympics, the pair returned to professional skating and moved to Simsbury, Connecticut. During the 1994–95 season, they toured with Stars on Ice, this time as headliners. That year, Gordeeva was named one of the &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; by People Magazine. That summer, Gordeeva and Grinkov were chosen for induction into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame.

They planned to return to Stars on Ice for their fourth season with the tour. On 20 November 1995, while the pair were rehearsing in Lake Placid, New York, for opening night of the upcoming tour, Grinkov collapsed on the ice and died at age 28 from a massive heart attack. Doctors later discovered that he had a congenital heart condition which caused his death.

Arguably the most influential, celebrated and highly decorated pair team in the history of the sport, many consider them to be the greatest pair team ever to take the ice. They are often referred to simply as &quot;G&amp;G&quot;. They were known for the quality of their basic skating technique: &quot;Grinkov and Gordeeva had something special that was more easily appreciated in person. They didn&#x27;t make noise when they skated. They moved so fluidly that their blades whispered over the ice, not scratching at it.&quot;

== Solo career ==
In February 1996, Gordeeva returned to the ice, this time as a solo performer. Her first performance was a tribute to her late husband, skated to the &quot;Adagietto&quot; section of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 5.&quot; The number was publicly performed only twice, first at a preview performance at the Minto Skating Club in Ottawa, Ontario, and then on 27 February 1996, in a televised tribute to Grinkov called &quot;Celebration of a Life,&quot; in which numerous skating luminaries took part. Gordeeva has said that she felt as if she skated with Sergei that night, that she was &quot;double strong&quot; because she felt him with her. The same year, with the aid of author E. M. Swift, she told her story in a book titled &quot;My Sergei: A Love Story&quot;. In February 1998, CBS aired an eponymous docudrama based on the book. She published a second book in April 1998, titled &quot;A Letter for Daria&quot;. In 1998, she told an interviewer that &quot;My life of great skating, and skating with him, is over ... I don&#x27;t try to go now for Olympics. I take skating for a job.&quot;

Gordeeva returned to Stars on Ice as a solo skater in 1996 and toured with the show every year until 2000, when she took time off to give birth to another daughter, Elizaveta Ilinichna Kulik, in June 2001. Gordeeva has returned to the tour as a guest star many times, but has never returned to full-time touring. In addition to tours and shows, Gordeeva competed successfully as a professional solo skater, finishing as high as second place at the World Professional Championships (in 1997). She stopped competing in 2000, but continues to skate in professional skating tours, shows and competitions. While she has never returned to pair skating as a full-time endeavor, she has performed pair elements in many shows through the years with partners including Artur Dmitriev, Anton Sikharulidze, David Pelletier and John Zimmerman. For the 1998–1999 season of Stars on Ice, she and fellow Russians Ilia Kulik, Elena Bechke and Denis Petrov performed a quartet which showcased her pair skills, and in 1999–2000, she and Kulik skated a romantic duet during the tour.

Gordeeva has signed several endorsement contracts, the most notable of which was with Target and led to two perfumes (&quot;Katia&quot; and &quot;Katia Sport&quot;) which were sold through Target stores. Gordeeva and her daughter, Daria, appeared in the 1997 holiday movie &quot;Snowden on Ice&quot; as part of the &quot;CBS Sports Special;&quot; Gordeeva appeared in the 1998 sequel, &quot;Snowden&#x27;s Raggedy Ann and Andy Holiday Show&quot;. She has represented Rolex and also appeared with Daria in a &quot;Got Milk?&quot; ad.

In 2001, she was the subject of a Lenox figurine called &quot;Katia&#x27;s Celebration of Life,&quot; which depicts her performing a layback spin in the tribute she skated for Grinkov. She also appeared in the 2003 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue as a featured athlete. In 2003, she appeared on the ice for the first time with Daria. The pair performed a duet during a Mother&#x27;s Day show and took the ice together several times since 2003, including two different versions of Amy Grant&#x27;s &quot;Children of the World&quot; at Kristi Yamaguchi&#x27;s &quot;Family &amp; Friends&quot; shows in 2005 and 2006. During that show in 2007, the mother-daughter duo became a trio when they were joined by Gordeeva&#x27;s younger daughter, Liza, and all three skated together to &quot;Homesick&quot; performed live by The Cheetah Girls. Since 2007, all three are amateur skaters together.

In 2007, Gordeeva starred in &quot;Skate for the Heart&quot;, a show designed to raise awareness of heart disease. She skated in honor of Grinkov. Gordeeva briefly returned to pairs skating during the 2008–09 season when she participated in the second season of Russian reality television show &quot;Ice Age&quot;. She was paired with Russian actor Egor Beroev and they won the show. During the taping of &quot;Ice Age 2&quot;, she flew to the United States from Russia to headline &quot;Skate for the Heart&quot; a second time. She dedicated a number to the memory of her father, Alexander Gordeev, who died of a heart attack in 2008. In 2010, she was paired with hockey player Valeri Bure in another figure skating reality show, season 2 of &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot;. In the 22 November 2010 finale, she and Bure won the competition. Gordeeva rejoined Stars on Ice in November 2010 for the 25th Anniversary Tour.

In addition to her skating, Gordeeva has ventured into coaching and choreography. She is currently a member of the coaching team at the Ice Palace Figure Skating Club in West Edmonton Mall.

== Personal life ==
Gordeeva and Grinkov had a state wedding on 20 April 1991 and a church wedding on 28 April. Their daughter, Daria Sergeyevna Gordeeva-Grinkova, was born on 11 September 1992, in Morristown, New Jersey. On 20 November 1995, Grinkov died of a heart attack during practice in Lake Placid, New York.

On 15 June 2001, Gordeeva gave birth to her second daughter, Elizaveta (or the diminutive &quot;Liza,&quot; pronounced LEE-za) Ilinichna Kulik. Her father is 1998 Olympic men&#x27;s singles champion Ilia Kulik. Gordeeva and Kulik married in a private ceremony in San Francisco on 10 June 2002.

Gordeeva and her family resided in California for several years before moving to Avon, Connecticut, in 2003. They returned to the Los Angeles area in 2007 and resided in Newport Beach, California. Gordeeva, Kulik, Daria, and Elizaveta made their first televised appearance as a family for Kristi Yamaguchi&#x27;s Friends and Family in 2005 and appeared in the 2006 and 2007 versions of the show. Gordeeva and her family spoke Russian at home and frequently traveled to Russia.

In 2012, Kulik and Gordeeva opened Kulik&#x27;s Skating, an ice rink and figure skating training environment in Lake Forest, California. Gordeeva and Kulik divorced in 2016.

Gordeeva married Canadian figure skater and 2002 Olympic pairs champion David Pelletier on 25 July 2020. They live in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

==Publications==

===&quot;My Sergei: A Love Story&quot;===
&quot;My Sergei: A Love Story&quot; was written by Gordeeva with &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer E. M. Swift and published in 1996. Gordeeva&#x27;s account of her years together with Grinkov topped the New York Times Best Seller list and includes many black-and-white and color photos from Gordeeva and Grinkov&#x27;s personal collection, as well as publicity photos from their various touring groups, such as Stars On Ice. A made-for-television movie version of &quot;My Sergei&quot; was also made, directed by Rob Dustin. 2002 Olympic pairs skating champions Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze starred as Gordeeva and Grinkov respectively. It included interviews with family and friends and archival skating footage.

In 1999, a Russian language edition was published, which included a foreword absent in the English edition. In it, Gordeeva reveals she was approached by an American agency to write the book. This resulted in it being written &quot;for an American reader who needs a sentimental, tragic and romantic story&quot; and, because of Swift&#x27;s preconceived notions of Russia, with a tendency &quot;of praising the West and underlining imperfections of Russia.&quot;

===&quot;A Letter for Daria&quot;===
The children&#x27;s book &quot;A Letter for Daria&quot; was written by Gordeeva for her daughter. It is an autobiographical letter from mother to daughter about childhood memories, skating, differences between Russian and American culture and the importance of family. It includes several pictures from Gordeeva&#x27;s personal collection.

<text>Sergei Mikhailovich Grinkov (; 4 February 1967 – 20 November 1995) was a Soviet and Russian pair skater. Together with his wife Ekaterina Gordeeva, he was the 1988 and 1994 Olympic Champion and a four-time World Champion (1986, 1987, 1989, 1990).

==Personal life==
Sergei Grinkov was born in Moscow to Anna Filipovna Grinkova and Mikhail Kondrateyevich Grinkov and had an older sister, Natalia Mikailovna Grinkova. He married Ekaterina Gordeeva in April 1991. They had two ceremonies because the USSR did not recognize religious ceremonies. The legal, official state-approved wedding was on 20 April, and a religious wedding in the Russian Orthodox Church took place on 28 April. On 11 September 1992, Gordeeva gave birth to their daughter, Daria &quot;Dasha&quot; Sergeyevna Grinkova, in Morristown, New Jersey. After the 1994 Olympics, they settled in Simsbury, Connecticut. Daria took up skating seriously at age 9, appearing with her mother in several skating shows from 2003 to 2007 but quit competitive skating to pursue other interests in 2007. However, Daria still skates with her mother in amateur ranks.

Grinkov&#x27;s father died of heart disease in 1991. His mother died in 2000 in Moscow.

==Career ==
Grinkov first took to the ice at the age of five, entering the Children and Youth Sports School of CSKA in Moscow. As Grinkov was not a strong solo skater, his coach decided to try him in pair skating, and in August 1981, at age fourteen, he was paired with ten-year-old Ekaterina Gordeeva at the Central Red Army Club (CSKA) in Moscow by coach Vladimir Zaharov.

The pair won the 1985 World Junior Championship in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The following year they won the first of their four World Figure Skating Championships. They became repeat world champions the following year and won gold at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta. Grinkov became one of the youngest male figure skating Olympic champions.

After a fall in their long program, they took silver at the World Championships in 1988, but they reclaimed that title in 1989 and successfully defended it again in 1990. They turned professional in the fall of 1990. They won their first World Professional Championship in 1991, and went on to win that title two more times (1992 and 1994).

Gordeeva/Grinkov won virtually every competition they entered. In the 31 competitions they completed at the Senior and professional levels, they finished first 24 times and finished off the podium only once; from the time they won their first World Championships, they never placed lower than silver and took gold in all but four of the competitions they completed. They are one of the few pair teams in history to successfully complete a quadruple twist lift in international competition, at the 1987 World Championships. They also completed the difficult maneuver at the 1987 European Championships, but due to a problem with Grinkov&#x27;s boot strap and a misunderstanding about the rules, they were disqualified from that event (the referee signaled them to stop, going so far as to turn off their music but they continued skating).

The following season was the first year they toured with Stars on Ice. They skated throughout the United States and Canada with the show, which ran from November 1991 through April 1992. Shortly after their daughter&#x27;s birth, the pair was back on the ice training for the new season of Stars on Ice, which debuted that November and ran through April 1993.

In 1994, Gordeeva/Grinkov took advantage of a one-time rule change that allowed professional skaters to regain their Olympic eligibility. They won their second gold medal at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway — the only reinstated skaters to win gold. They then returned to professional skating in the United States. During the 1994–95 season, they toured again with Stars on Ice, this time as headliners. They won the World Professional Championships for the third time in December 1994, earning ten perfect 10s (and nothing lower than a 9.9). Their last competition was at the 1995 Challenge of Champions, which took place on 7 January 1995 in Tokyo, Japan where they skated to Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem Mass&quot;. They won, earning four perfect 10s in their artistic mark. In the fall of 1995, they were preparing new programs and getting ready to return to Stars on Ice for a fourth season. On 12 November 1995, they appeared in an exhibition called Skates of Gold III in Albany, New York. They skated two numbers: Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem Mass&quot; and the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Out of Tears&quot;. It would be their final public performance together.

The pair was known for their quiet glide over the ice: &quot;Grinkov and Gordeeva had something special that was more easily appreciated in person. They didn&#x27;t make noise when they skated. They moved so fluidly that their blades whispered over the ice rather than scratching at it.&quot; Their last public performance, just days before Grinkov&#x27;s sudden death, was in the &quot;Skates for Gold III&quot; television special in Albany, N.Y.

==Death==
On 20 November 1995, Grinkov collapsed and died from a massive heart attack in Lake Placid, New York, while he and Gordeeva were practicing for the upcoming 1995–1996 Stars on Ice tour. Doctors found that Grinkov had severely clogged coronary arteries (to the point where his arterial opening was reportedly the size of a pinhole), which caused the heart attack; later testing revealed that he also had a genetic risk factor linked with premature heart attacks. The risk factor is called the PLA-2 variant and is also known as the &quot;Grinkov Risk Factor&quot;. Grinkov was 28 years old. His wife was 24 and their daughter was 3 years old.

Grinkov is interred in the Vagan&#x27;kovskoye Cemetery in Moscow. Gordeeva, his widow, along with an all-star cast, skated a tribute in his honor titled &quot;Celebration of a Life&quot; in February 1996, which was later televised. Gordeeva also authored a book about their life and partnership titled &quot;My Sergei: A Love Story&quot;, which was later turned into a television movie/docudrama titled &quot;My Sergei&quot; and released on DVD. He was also the subject of a book, geared towards the 9–12 age group, titled &quot;They Died Too Young: Sergei Grinkov&quot; written by Anne E. Hill.

Gordeeva and Grinkov have garnered significant mention in numerous books about the world of figure skating, and Grinkov was featured as one of the athletes in &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s book, &quot;Gone Too Soon&quot;. Fans around the world continue to commemorate Grinkov and G&amp;G and their skating lives in videos available online and commercially. They are frequently mentioned during telecasts of pairs skating competitions and were number 4 on &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Thrill List: Figure Skating&quot;.

In the fall of 2007, Gordeeva was the headliner for &quot;Skate for the Heart&quot; a skating show televised nationally in the United States with the goal of raising awareness of heart disease, skating in honor of Grinkov. She starred in the show a second time in 2008, this time dedicating her performance to her late father who, like Sergei, died of a sudden heart attack in 2008.

<doc id="1346163" wikidata="Q1072057" url="?curid=1346163" title="Interstate 290 (Illinois)">
<text>Interstate 290 (I-290) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway that runs westward from the Jane Byrne Interchange near the Chicago Loop. The portion of I-290 from I-294 to its east end is officially called the Dwight D. Eisenhower Expressway. In short form, it is known as &quot;the Ike&quot; or the Eisenhower. Before being designated the Eisenhower Expressway, the highway was called the Congress Expressway because of the surface street that was located approximately in its path and onto which I-290 runs at its eastern terminus in the Loop.

I-290 connects I-90 (Jane Addams Memorial Tollway) in Rolling Meadows with I-90/I-94 (John F. Kennedy Expressway/Dan Ryan Expressway) near the Loop. North of I-355, the highway is sometimes known locally as Illinois Route 53 (IL 53), or simply Route 53, since IL 53 existed before I-290. However, it now merges with I-290 at Biesterfield Road. In total, I-290 is long.

== Route description ==

=== Jane Addams Memorial Tollway to Veterans Memorial Tollway ===

This section is long and runs from Rolling Meadows to Addison. It is the portion of I-290 more locally known as &quot;Route 53&quot;. Here, I-290 runs largely above-grade through Schaumburg and Elk Grove Village and at- or below-grade through Itasca and Addison.

The northern of this highway were reconstructed in 2003–2004. A left shoulder and an auxiliary lane between ramps were added, as well as improved lighting. The highway is four lanes wide (not counting the auxiliary lane) north of IL 390 (milemarker 5) and five lanes wide with a wide left shoulder south to the exit to I-355.

Between milemarkers 0 and 4, IL 53 overlaps this section of the Eisenhower Expressway.

=== Eisenhower Extension ===

This section is long and runs from Addison to Hillside. It took its name when the Eisenhower was extended northwest from Hillside. The highway runs largely at-grade or above-grade for this length. US Route 20 (US 20) overlaps I-290 around Elmhurst from milemarkers 12 to 13 and runs parallel to the rest of this section between milemarkers 7 and 18.

This section of I-290 varies in width from two lanes at the ramp east from the I-290/I-355 split to three lanes between I-355 and US 20, to three lanes plus two exit lanes at US 20/IL 64 (Lake Street/North Avenue; exit 13B). After exit 13B, the highway reverts to three through traffic lanes. Exit 15 to southbound I-294 is a frequent point of congestion due to ramp traffic backing up onto the mainline highway, often as long as . This is because the ramp is not isolated from the mainline, only one lane in width, is a low-speed ramp (marked as a ramp), and is relatively short () while carrying a high volume of truck traffic south to Indiana from North Avenue. Additionally, the sudden appearance of the exit tends to cause accidents when cars in the center lane try to aggressively turn into the right lane, particularly at the mouth of the I-294 exit. Finally, there is a dangerous high-volume weaving situation at the end of the ramp to I-294 with southbound I-294 traffic exiting to westbound I-88.

In 2020, the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority began construction of an estimated $700–$800 million project intended to address these operational issues at the I-290/I-88 interchange at I-294 as part of the Illinois Tollway&#x27;s Central Tri-State Project. Construction is intended to reduce backups and improve the chokepoint and include: barriers integrated to separate various ramp movements from merging traffic which is intended to alleviate heavy congestion due to traffic weaving from eastbound I-290 to southbound I-294; new ramp designs from northbound I- 294 to westbound I-290; a new fly under ramp to improve travel between westbound I-294 and westbound I-290; and adjustments to the exit travel pattern for drivers traveling between westbound I-290 and St. Charles Road. Work is scheduled to be complete by the end of 2026.

The western of this section are blacktop, while east of IL 83 (exit 10) the original concrete is still in place.

=== Tri-State Tollway to Austin Boulevard ===

This section of I-290 is long, and it runs from Hillside to the western border of Chicago. This section is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Avenues&quot;. , it is the third-most-congested stretch of highway in the Chicago metropolitan area, behind the Jane Byrne Interchange area and the intersection of the Dan Ryan Expressway and Chicago Skyway. It is known for having a high volume of traffic on ramps through the Avenues, and high volumes of traffic on left-side ramps in Forest Park and Oak Park. I-290 runs above-grade west of Mannheim Road and at- or below-grade east of Mannheim Road.

Eastbound at Mannheim Road (exit 17), the highway splits into two express and one local lane; they are joined by two onramps from I-88 and form express lanes three lanes wide and local lanes to Mannheim Road two lanes wide. After Mannheim Road, the highway immediately narrows to three lanes in width, causing mile-long () backups. It remains three lanes to Austin Boulevard. Westbound, I-290 merely is three lanes wide to Mannheim Road and then four lanes wide to the I-88/I-290 split. Exits at Harlem Avenue (exit 21B) and Austin Boulevard (exit 23) are inverted single-point urban interchanges (inverted SPUIs), with left offramps and onramps. These cause backups as trucks switch lanes to exit and a large volume of traffic enters on the left side of the highway.

In 2001–2002, this section between milemarkers 15 and 18 was reconstructed in the first phase of an attempt to untangle the &quot;Hillside Strangler&quot;, adding the local lanes and extra onramp to I-290. The second phase, reconstruction of the highway between milemarkers 18 and 23 (Mannheim Road to Austin Boulevard), is still in the preliminary engineering phase of construction .

=== Austin Boulevard to Chicago Loop ===

The easternmost section of I-290 is long and runs entirely through the city of Chicago to the terminus at I-90/I-94. It runs below grade for its entire length.

This highway is four lanes wide in both directions for its entire length, and most onramps and offramps are located just two blocks apart. Therefore, an exit in one direction may be marked one street (e.g., Laramie Avenue), while the same exit in the other direction may be marked another (e.g., Cicero Avenue), even though the streets are only a block apart. This configuration results in most exits on this portion of the road being marked as A/B exits.

Eastbound congestion is lighter here than through the &quot;Avenues&quot;, generally limited to congestion on the tight onramps to the Kennedy and Dan Ryan expressways (Jane Byrne Interchange) at the eastern terminus or blind onramps at Kostner and Homan avenues. Westbound, congestion is heavy starting at Laramie due to the left-hand exit at Austin (which combines a &quot;perfect storm&quot; of a four-down-to-three lane reduction, an unfamiliar left-hand exit, and entrance and in-merging traffic of the central onramp). Most afternoons, this bottleneck can skyrocket the &quot;Post Office to Wolf (Road)&quot; commute time to over an hour (up from 16 minutes with no traffic).

The Eisenhower Expressway runs along blacktop pavement for the length of the section, except between Kostner Avenue and Independence Boulevard, where it runs on concrete pavement.

The eastern terminus of I-290 is the Jane Byrne Interchange with I-90/I-94. After this junction, the route becomes elevated and continues as a highway until LaSalle Street, at which point it passes under LaSalle Street Station and comes out the other side as a city street (Ida B. Wells Drive). The Ida B. Wells Drive route continues east until the street is stopped by Buckingham Fountain.

The Blue Line operates in the median of the Eisenhower from Halsted Street to Cicero Avenue. After Cicero, the line leaves the median and runs on the south side of the Eisenhower for the remainder of its route to Des Plaines Avenue, Forest Park.

== History ==

Rapid transit had existed in the vicinity of the future expressway&#x27;s right of way since 1895, when the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad opened its main line east of Marshfield Avenue on May 6 and its Garfield Park branch west to 48th Avenue (modern-day Cicero Avenue) on June 19. The Metropolitan&#x27;s lines, alongside the rest of Chicago&#x27;s rapid transit network, were assumed by the Chicago Rapid Transit Company (CRT) in 1924.

An expressway along the alignment of the Eisenhower Expressway was foreshadowed by Daniel Burnham&#x27;s plan of 1909, which described a west side boulevard. Use of the automobile boomed in the 1920s, leading to extreme traffic on Chicago&#x27;s west side and the first serious plans of an expressway by Congress Street in the early 1930s. The passageway under the Old Post Office was designed to preserve the right of way for this future road.

The expressway is named for the former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 and came up with the original concept for the Interstate Highway System; it originally was called the Congress Expressway because it partially follows the route of Congress Parkway (portions now called Ida B. Wells Drive) in Chicago. The first segment, in length, opened from Mannheim Road to 1st Avenue in December 1955. On December 15, an additional was opened, from Ashland Avenue (1600 West) to Laramie Avenue (5200 West).

During the 1960s and 1970s, the Eisenhower Expressway was extended to Lake Street and North Avenue in Elmhurst. In 1963, the first working example of ramp metering took place on the Eisenhower Expressway, based on successful metering through New York City tunnels and data from ramp closures in Detroit, Michigan. The first implementation utilized a police officer at the top of an entrance ramp, stopping and releasing vehicles onto the highway at a predetermined rate. Another section opened in 1972, to a north–south expressway in Addison, Illinois. At the time, this expressway was a short spur from the Eisenhower Expressway, and it was referred to as IL 53, which continued north to Schaumburg. Construction on IL 53 had finished in 1970.

Until 1977, the Eisenhower Expressway was marked as a part of I-90. In 1978, I-90 was rerouted over the Kennedy Expressway and the Northwest Tollway, replacing IL 194. The Eisenhower Expressway was then renumbered as I-290 and signage was updated in 1979.

Because the segment from I-294 to IL 53 was built last, that portion of the highway is referred to as the Eisenhower Extension. The Eisenhower Expressway, extension included, is long. If the IL 53 portion of I-290 is added to that, the highway is long.

In 2003–2004, the first of I-290 out of Schaumburg were rebuilt, replacing pavement that had well-exceeded its estimated 20-year lifetime. (The original pavement was built in stages from 1963 through 1970 as part of IL 53.) A fifth auxiliary lane was added between the entrance and exit ramps of exits 1, 4, and 5. The most important safety upgrade was the demolition of the raised grassy median between the westbound and eastbound lanes, and its replacement with a permanent concrete median and wide shoulders.

* Hillside Strangler: Named after the Chicago suburb of Hillside, it refers to a major merge with I-88, and almost always is used when referring to inbound (eastbound) traffic. It is at this point that I-88 terminates eastbound. It was called the Strangler because, before its reconstruction in the early 2000s, seven throughlanes were forced to merge to three, creating large backups. Reconstruction widened part of this area to nine lanes (five inbound; three through; two local; and four through outbound). This allowed direct exits to Mannheim Road (US 12/US 20/US 45) from I-88, the ramp also serving for an I-88 truck access to eastbound I-290; created an inbound collector–distributor ramp for Mannheim Road; and added a timed gate that closed a ramp from Roosevelt Road (IL 38) to inbound I-290 during the afternoon rush hours. These improvements helped congestion at the site, but they also pushed preexisting congestion further east to the six-lane portion of the highway. The Hillside Strangler is located at about milemarker 18.
* The Avenues: The portion of the highway between Mannheim Road at milemarker 17 and First Avenue in Maywood, a stretch of . Named because all of the crossroads between these two exits are named numerically, in ascending order traveling outbound (westbound). 1st Avenue (IL 171) is exit 20. There are exits to 9th, 17th, and 25th avenues to the west. These exits are spaced about apart. This stretch is notorious for being very congested.
* Eisenhower Extension or 290 Extension: The of road between current-day milemarker 7 (I-355 south to US 20/Lake Street) and North Avenue (IL 64), milemarker 15. This section was built in the late 1970s.
* Jane Byrne Interchange: The eastern terminus of I-290 where it meets I-90/I-94, which overlap through Chicago. North of this interchange I-90/I- 94 is called the Kennedy Expressway, while south of it I-90/I-94 is called the Dan Ryan Expressway. The interchange itself consists of eight heavily used, very tight ramps that wind around each other, giving the interchange a distinct circle shape when looked at from above. This design, adequate when first built in the 1950s, forces drivers to slow down to speeds of about due to its tightly wound curves. Not only does this led to the worst congestion in the Chicago area, a 2010 study of freight congestion (truck speed and travel time) by the Federal Highway Administration ranked this section of the I-290 as having the worst congestion in the US; the average truck speed just . The interchange was completely rebuilt and reconfigured from 2013 to 2022.

=== Old Post Office ===

Just east of the I-290–I-90/I-94 junction in downtown Chicago, the Old Chicago Main Post Office is a building that stretches over Ida B. Wells Drive. If one drives eastbound on I-290 and continues past I-90/I-94, the highway ends and becomes Ida B. Wells Drive. The Old Post Office was a landmark that was sometimes used in referring to the end of I-290 in downtown Chicago. For example, a traffic reporter might say &quot;forty minutes from Mannheim to the Old Post Office&quot;.

This large building was used by the US Postal Service (USPS) until 1996. The building itself was built from 1921 to 1933 in the Art-Deco style, and it is in size. The building, built several decades before the expressway that passes through it, was originally designed to accommodate a roadway—requiring only minimal work to remove walls in the base for the freeway to pass through. In spite of its unused state, the building is still known to visitors and commuters alike as the unofficial gateway into the Loop area. In late August 2009, the USPS announced an auction was to be held to sell the facility to the highest bidder. The winning bid ($40 million [equivalent to $ in ]) was from an English real-estate developer, Bill Davies.

===Impact===
Within Chicago alone, the Eisenhower Expressway displaced 13,000 people and destroyed 400 businesses, leading to a decline on Chicago&#x27;s West Side. In Oak Park, about 100 buildings were demolished. Further along in Forest Park, approximately 3,500 graves had to be moved from cemeteries to make way for the expressway. The Eisenhower was the first expressway in the heart of Chicago, yet for its $183 million cost, the thousands of people displaced, and the neighborhoods torn up, traffic congestion did not improve.

Residents at the time described the demolition of neighborhoods as looking like the aftermath of a World War II bombing. The historian Beryl Satter stated about the expressway,

Not only did the aftermath of construction lead to the decline of west side neighborhoods, but the construction process itself brought crime to the area. A local newspaper, the &quot;Garfieldian&quot;, wrote in 1951,

<doc id="1346164" wikidata="Q234041" url="?curid=1346164" title="Nadezhda von Meck">
<text>Nadezhda Filaretovna von Meck (; 13 January 1894) was a Russian businesswoman who became an influential patron of the arts, especially music. She is best known today for her artistic relationship with Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, supporting him financially for thirteen years, so that he could devote himself full-time to composition, while stipulating that they were never to meet. Tchaikovsky dedicated his Symphony No. 4 in F minor to her. She also gave financial support to several other musicians, including Nikolai Rubinstein and Claude Debussy.

== Life ==

=== Childhood ===
Nadezhda von Meck was born Nadezhda Filaretovna Frolovskaya, in a family which owned large landed estates. Her father, Filaret Frolovsky, embraced her love of music from an early age, while from her mother, Anastasia Dimitryevna Potemkina, she learned energy, determination, and business acumen.

A serious student of music in her youth, Nadezhda became a capable pianist with a good knowledge of the classical repertoire. She also mastered some foreign languages, learned to appreciate the visual arts, and read widely in literature, history, and philosophy, especially the work of Arthur Schopenhauer and the Russian idealist Vladimir Solovyov.

=== Marriage ===
At seventeen, Nadezhda was married to Karl Otto Georg von Meck, a 27-year-old engineer and the son of Major Otto Adam von Meck by his marriage to Wilhelmine Hafferberg – Baltic Germans from Riga. Together they had thirteen children, of whom eleven survived to adulthood.

As a government official, Karl von Meck&#x27;s life was uneventful, and his work was poorly paid. With several children quickly added to his responsibilities, however, he was reluctant to make a break with a steady post.

Nadezhda von Meck saw things very differently. To her, filling the roles of mother, nurse, governess, dressmaker, housekeeper, and valet was far easier to bear than the humiliation of seeing her husband as a cog in the machine of a government organization. Neither did fulfilling all those domestic duties lower her resolve or weaken her energy in urging him to make a break. Russia, desperately short of railways, was expanding its communications network rapidly, and Nadezhda was far-sighted enough to see that a future for her husband lay there. She continually exerted pressure on him to find a partner with capital and to join the boom in Russian railway construction.

Meck finally gave in to his wife&#x27;s urgings and resigned from the civil service, at which point they had an income of only twenty kopecks a day on which to live. Nadezhda was right, though, to trust her husband&#x27;s talent as an engineer. In 1860, there were only 100 miles of railroad track laid in Russia. Twenty years later, there were over 15,000 miles of lines. Much of this explosion was due to Karl von Meck, and his investments made him a multi-millionaire. The railway lines for which he was responsible included that from Kursk to Kiev and the highly profitable Moscow to Ryazan line, with its effective monopoly of grain transportation from the Black Earth Region of Central Russia.

In 1876, Karl von Meck died suddenly, leaving a will which gave Nadezhda control of his vast financial holdings. This included two railway networks, large landed estates, and several million rubles in investments. With seven of their eleven children still at home, von Meck concentrated on her business affairs and on the education of the children still dependent on her. She sold one of Meck&#x27;s railway companies and ran the other one with the help of her brother and her eldest son, Vladimir.

=== Withdrawal from society ===
After the death of her husband, von Meck took no part in social life, withdrawing into almost complete seclusion. She even refused to meet the relatives of those whom her children were going to marry, and she never attended any of their weddings.

By all accounts, von Meck was imperious by nature, presiding over her household despotically. She expected to have her own way, so surrounded herself only with people who would give it to her, and she ruled her children&#x27;s lives in every detail. As they grew into adulthood, she arranged their marriages, bought houses for them, and even chose furniture for their houses. When she wanted to see her married children, she summoned rather than invited them. Understandably, her children were not always grateful for the extreme degree of their mother&#x27;s care (or meddling, depending on the viewpoint of the person concerned).

Von Meck was always compulsively busy. She took her more senior servants on periodic inspection tours of her house from cellar to roof, and the house never remained quite the same after such tours. String was saved for her to untangle and wind. Books were bought so that she might cut the pages. She purchased quantities of wool, which she then wound into balls and sent to her daughter, Countess Bennigsen. While engaging in this business, she would summon her daughter Julia to come and read to her. Julia did not mind. Of all the Meck children, she was the one most eager to please her mother, who demanded everything from her—and got it.

Meck was probably well aware that she was hard to tolerate. She wrote to Tchaikovsky, I am very unsympathetic in my personal relations because I do not possess any femininity whatever; second, I do not know how to be tender, and this characteristic has passed on to my entire family. All of us are afraid to be affected or sentimental, and therefore the general nature of our family relationships is comradely, or masculine, so to speak.

===Personal views===
Von Meck was a professed atheist, which was not unusual in aristocratic Russia in the 1870s. Her fierce need for independence, on the other hand, was very unusual for a woman of the time. Her division between that and concern for her family resulted in contradictions between her beliefs and actions. Her views on affairs of the heart were strictly moral, but she did not believe in marriage as a social institution and regularly professed her hatred of it to Tchaikovsky. &quot;You may think, my dear Pyotr Ilyich, that I am a great admirer of marriage,&quot; she wrote on 31 March 1878, &quot;but in order that you not be mistaken in anything referring to myself, I shall tell you that I am, on the contrary, an irreconcilable enemy of marriages, yet when I discuss another person&#x27;s situation, I consider it necessary to do so from his point of view.&quot; On another occasion, she stated more genially but no less forcefully, &quot;The distribution of rights and obligations as determined by social laws I find speculative and immoral.&quot;

Even with her views on matrimony, von Meck was resigned to it as a means of social stability and procreation, and her own marital experience may have forced her to recognize its benefits. This realization may have also been why she strove to marry off her children as soon as possible—to ensure their stability in the event of her demise. Even in marriage, though, she considered sexual relations between men and women to be mutual exploitation. Russian radical thinkers of the period, such as Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Dmitry Pisarev, espoused views not far removed from hers. Both men considered marriage to be a pillar of bourgeois society and called for its abolition. Meck especially respected Pisarev&#x27;s work, as well as 19th-century positivism in general.

== Support of the performing arts ==
With her great wealth and her passion for music, von Meck became a major mover in the Russian performing arts. The sole exception to her general reclusiveness was the series of Russian Musical Society concerts given in Moscow, which she attended &quot;incognito&quot;, sitting alone in the balcony. Through these concerts she made the acquaintance of Nikolai Rubinstein, with whom she maintained a complex relationship. While she respected Rubinstein&#x27;s talents and energy, that did not stop her from disagreeing strongly with him at times.

While her husband was still alive, von Meck began actively supporting and promoting young musicians, several of whom she continually employed, living in her household and playing her favorite works. She hired Claude Debussy as a music tutor for her daughters, and he wanted to marry one of them. She would not give her permission, preferring her daughters to marry men of her own choosing.

In February 1880, Meck came to the assistance of the Polish violinist Henryk Wieniawski, who had been taken ill in Odessa while on a concert tour. She moved him into her house and arranged medical treatment for him, but he died a few weeks later in Moscow.

==Relationship with Tchaikovsky==
 In 1877, one of the musicians she supported was violinist Iosif Kotek, with whom she played chamber music. Kotek was a former student and friend of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, recommended to Meck by Nikolai Rubinstein. She had already been impressed with Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music such as his symphonic poem &quot;The Tempest&quot;, and she asked Rubinstein at length about him. She wrote to the composer. Introducing herself as a &quot;fervent admirer&quot;, she commissioned some pieces for violin and piano to be played at her house. Tchaikovsky quickly obliged. One of her first commissions was for a funeral march, which was never published and is now considered lost.

They continued writing even as his marriage followed its brief though tortuous course. As their relationship developed, she subsequently provided him with an allowance of 6,000 rubles a year, large enough that he could leave his professorship at the Moscow Conservatory to focus on creative work full-time. This was a substantial income. A minor government official in those days had to support his family on 300–400 rubles a year.

Tchaikovsky was grateful for von Meck&#x27;s financial support. Nevertheless, it created some emotional discomfort and an underlying tension, but they both eventually handled this awkwardness with considerable delicacy. Still, Tchaikovsky could not help feeling vaguely uncomfortable about the favors with which Meck showered him. He wrote to her frankly about this: &quot;... in my relations with you there is the ticklish circumstance that every time we write to one another, money appears on the scene.&quot;

===Epistolary friendship===
They carried on a significant correspondence, exchanging over 1,200 letters between 1877 and 1890. The details they shared were extraordinary for two people who never met. He was more open to her about much of his life and his creative processes than to any other person. Her feedback became so important to him that, after the critics lambasted his Fifth Symphony, she provided him with the support to persevere with his composing. Meck died believing these letters had all been destroyed. However, when Tchaikovsky received her request to do so, he assured her that he had destroyed them, but then filed that letter with all the rest for posterity to find.

Von Meck remained a devoted supporter of Tchaikovsky and all his works, but her bond with him depended on not meeting him. This was not simply because he would not live up to her expectations. She desired to think of Tchaikovsky as her ideal of a composer-cum-philosopher, much like the &quot;Übermensch&quot; or Superman about whom Friedrich Nietzsche would write. Tchaikovsky understood this, writing to Meck, &quot;You are quite right, Nadezhda Filaretovna, to suppose that I am of a disposition sympathetic to your own unusual spiritual feelings, which I understand completely.&quot;

The two did meet on one occasion, purely by chance, in August 1879, while Tchaikovsky was staying at the Meck estate at Simaki. He had gone for his daily walk in the forest somewhat earlier than usual, unaware that she was late for her daily drive through that same area with the rest of her family. As a result, they came face to face for a few moments; he tipped his hat politely, she was nonplussed, but no words were spoken. He wrote to her the same evening to apologise for the inadvertent breach of their arrangement. She responded, saying there was nothing to apologise for, and she even invited him to visit her home to see her new paintings, but at a time when she would be away.

The previous year, while staying at her villa in Florence, Tchaikovsky had seen her and her entourage pass by every morning; and they also glimpsed each other once at the opera, but only from a distance. Alexander Poznansky says of this last encounter: &quot;It is not clear whether their both being at the theater was wholly accidental or arranged by Mrs. von Meck in order to see him, as seems not unlikely.&quot;

===Dedication of Fourth Symphony===
Tchaikovsky, as a sign of appreciation, dedicated his Symphony No. 4 to her. This was important because, due to the nature of artistic patronage in Russian society, patron and artist were considered equals. Dedications of works to patrons were expressions of artistic partnership. By dedicating the Fourth Symphony to von Meck, he was affirming her as an equal partner in its creation.

===Symbolic—and strained—union===
 In 1883, von Meck&#x27;s son Nikolai married Tchaikovsky&#x27;s niece Anna Davydova, after five years of matchmaking efforts by Meck and Tchaikovsky. Meck, who was in Cannes at the time, did not attend the wedding, thus staying true to her custom of avoiding all contact with the families of her children&#x27;s spouses. However, Tchaikovsky did attend, meeting the rest of the Meck clan.

At first both Meck and Tchaikovsky rejoiced in this event, seeing in it a symbolic consummation of their own relationship, but later events would make them question their intentions. Anna, extremely strong-willed herself, dominated her husband. She also opposed her mother-in-law regarding family matters—most tellingly in a feud between her eldest son and business partner, Vladimir, and the rest of the family. Rather than bringing von Meck and Tchaikovsky closer together, Anna and Nikolai&#x27;s union may have helped drive a wedge between them. Tchaikovsky virtually disowned his niece in an effort to avert a falling-out, while Meck hid from him her true feelings about what was taking place.

===The break===
In October 1890, von Meck sent Tchaikovsky a year&#x27;s allowance in advance, along with a letter ending her patronage. She claimed bankruptcy. Most surprising about the break was its extreme suddenness. Barely a week beforehand, she had sent him a typically intimate, loving and confessional letter. The letter dealt in large part with how her children were squandering their future inheritance.

This was a persistent irritation for Meck and not necessarily a reason for her ending patronage of Tchaikovsky. Nevertheless, one logical explanation of giving him a year&#x27;s allowance at once would be that she feared not having the funds to send later, in their usual arrangement of monthly installments. Others discount this idea. Most tellingly, Meck asked Tchaikovsky, in her final letter, not to forget her.

Two facts contributed to von Meck&#x27;s decision to make the break:
#By 1890, she was gravely ill. She was in the latter stages of tuberculosis and would succumb two months after Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death. An atrophy of her arm made writing nearly impossible. Dictating letters via a third party would have been awkward—especially messages as frank, informal and personal as the ones she and Tchaikovsky had exchanged.
#She was under intense family pressure to end the relationship. Her children were embarrassed by her closeness with Tchaikovsky. There was society gossip about the composer and &quot;La Meck&quot;. Increasingly, at least in the eyes of hostile relatives, the situation seemed scandalous. Worse, to them, he continued to take Meck&#x27;s money freely even after he had received a generous pension from Tsar Alexander III. As the children&#x27;s own financial situations worsened, they grew more resolved to end the arrangement between their mother and Tchaikovsky. By mid- to late 1890, over a two-month period, she had been visited by all but one of her elder children and may even have been given a final ultimatum. The final letter and payment from Meck to Tchaikovsky were delivered by a trusted servant of hers, Ivan Vasilyev, for whom he held warm feelings. She had never sent anything to him this way before and had always sent letters and checks by post.
Von Meck also knew that Tchaikovsky was often in need of cash, despite the large sums she gave him. Tchaikovsky was a poor manager of money and would ask her for the next year&#x27;s allowance several months in advance. Knowing of this habit, she might have anticipated his needing the money.

===Brotherly jealousy===

One person who may have welcomed the break was Tchaikovsky&#x27;s brother Modest. When the two brothers discussed Meck&#x27;s action, Modest did not try to explain her behaviour. Instead, he stated his opinion that what had been to Tchaikovsky the unique and mutual relationship of two friends had been for Meck merely the passing fancy of a wealthy woman.

===Possible reconciliation===
Galina von Meck—daughter of Nadezhda von Meck&#x27;s son Nikolay and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s niece Anna—maintained that the rift was secretly healed. In September 1893, only weeks before Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death, Anna was about to leave for Nice, where Nadezhda von Meck was dying, and Anna was travelling there to nurse her. Tchaikovsky asked her to beg his former friend for forgiveness for his own silence. This apology was reportedly accepted wholeheartedly by Meck and reciprocated. The Tchaikovsky biographer David Brown maintains that Galina&#x27;s account &quot;contains much hearsay and a good deal that is romantically heightened.&quot; Regardless of this, he concedes some plausibility in her account, especially since Galina received the story directly from her mother.

== Financial problems ==
Von Meck&#x27;s claim of bankruptcy was not entirely untrue. Along with his fortune, Karl von Meck had left a sizable amount of debt upon his death, and this debt proved to be far more extensive than his wife had previously known. Rumours of this debt started circulating publicly in the early 1880s. Tchaikovsky had questioned her about it in his letters.

The problem of the debts was compounded by the financial mismanagement of Nadezhda von Meck&#x27;s business affairs by her son Vladimir. While he was as gifted in public relations as his father had been in engineering, Vladimir proved as extravagant as his mother in spending. He was the favorite among the Meck children, which may have been why his mother tolerated his ways as long as she did. Unfortunately, it was also largely what pitted her and Vladimir against his siblings and sister-in-law, Anna (Tchaikovsky&#x27;s niece). They claimed, among other things, that he was pocketing company funds for his own use. Regardless of the truth of these charges, the Meck estate was in serious financial peril.

In 1890, Vladimir von Meck suffered a nervous breakdown, and that summer his mother relieved him of his position. His replacement was his mother&#x27;s personal assistant Władysław Pachulski. Originally employed as a musician, Pachulski became a member of the family by marrying Julia von Meck. He was also far more experienced in financial management than Vladimir had been, and was able to save the Meck estates from bankruptcy. Meanwhile, Vladimir was found to have an advanced case of tuberculosis, the same disease from which his mother suffered, and he would die from it in 1892.

== Death ==
Von Meck died from tuberculosis on January 13, 1894 in Nice, in the south of France, two months after Tchaikovsky&#x27;s demise.

After her mother-in-law&#x27;s death, Anna von Meck was asked how the late patroness had endured Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death. She replied, &quot;She did not endure it.&quot;

== Donation by Galina Nikolayevna von Meck ==
In 1985 Galina von Meck donated to Columbia University a collection including her translation of 681 letters written by Tchaikovsky to his family. The collection covered the period from March 1861 to September 1893.

<text>The 1912 United States House of Representatives elections were elections for the United States House of Representatives to elect members to serve in the 63rd United States Congress. They were held for the most part on November 5, 1912, while Maine and Vermont held theirs in September. They coincided with the election of President Woodrow Wilson.

Wilson&#x27;s victory was partly due to the division of the opposition Republican Party into conservative and progressive factions. While many progressives stayed within the party framework, they maintained lukewarm relationships with Republican leadership. Others formed a third party known as the Progressives and several switched allegiance to the Democrats. A message of unity was portrayed by the Democrats, allowing this group to present themselves as above the bickering and corruption that had become associated with the Republican internal feud. Many of the new seats that were added after the prior census ended up in Democratic hands. In addition, William Kent, who had been elected to the House as a Republican in 1908, was elected to California&#x27;s 1st congressional district as an Independent.

This was the first election after the congressional reapportionment based on the 1910 Census. The Apportionment Act of 1911 also guaranteed that Arizona and New Mexico would have one seat each after those states joined the union in early 1912. Under this reapportionment, the number of representatives was increased to 435, where it currently stands (the 435 seat cap was later made permanent after the passage of the Reapportionment Act of 1929, with the exception of 1959 when Alaska and Hawaii were admitted as states).

==Election summaries==
In reapportionment following the 1910 census, 41 new seats were added, bringing the House to its modern size. This would be the last time the size of the House changed, except for a temporary addition of two seats in 1959 after the admission of Alaska and Hawaii and subsequent return to 435 in 1963. In the reapportionment, 1 state lost 1 seat, 22 states had no change in apportionment, 16 states gained 1 seat each, 5 states gained 2 seats each, 2 states gained 3 seats, 1 state gained 4 seats, and 1 state gained 6 seats. Twelve states used at-large seats in addition to districts to elect new seats.

<text>Mariel of Redwall is a fantasy novel by Brian Jacques, published in 1991. It is the fourth book published and sixth chronologically in the &quot;Redwall&quot; series.

==Plot summary==
=== Book 1: The Maid from the Sea ===

The story opens with the Gabool the Wild, the nefarious King of Searats, standing at the top of a cliff, watching a small mousemaid struggling to stay afloat in the rough seas below. The pirate king returned to his fortress, Fort Bladegirt, where one of his captains named Bludrigg demanded a share of their most recent plunder. Gabool feigned an air of compliance, but swiftly beheaded Bludrigg. After this incident, he interrogated Joseph the Bellmaker and attempted to force him to build a tower for the enormous bell he captured. This fails, but Gabool was able to successfully persuade the Bellmaker to interpret the mysterious symbols on the bell in exchange for promises of a reunion with the latter&#x27;s daughter. Gabool, technically upholding this promise, proceeds to shove the old mouse off of the cliff he had been watching the mousemaid being battered by the sea from before.

In the meantime, the mousemaid was rendered unconscious when a piece of flotsam struck her on the head. But miraculously, she survived, waking up after being washed ashore with a rope looped around her neck. Overwhelmed by thirst, the dazed mousemaid eventually found a small pool of fresh water. After successfully fending off a gull with her trusty rope and unsuccessful attempts to retrieve her forgotten identity, the amnesiac mouse named herself Storm Gullwhacker.

When weary Storm next awoke, she found herself surrounded by trident-wielding toads, led by their disgruntled leader, Oykamon. The mousemaid launched an attack, but was readily overwhelmed and stabbed. She was rescued by Colonel Clary, Brigadier Thyme, and Hon Rosie, hares of the Long Patrol. They decided to bring Storm to Redwall, led by a reclusive, paranoid Eurasian red squirrel, Pakatugg.

At Terramort Isle, Saltar the corsair, brother of Bludrigg, arrived with the &quot;Darkqueen&quot;. Saltar dueled Gabool, but was treacherously killed in a trap. Immediately afterward, a report came in that Captain Greypatch had stolen the &quot;Darkqueen&quot;, Gabool&#x27;s flagship. Gabool told his captains that whoever kills Greypatch will be made second-in-command of all searats. The power-hungry vermin scrambled to amass crew and ships in a bid to claim the reward.

==== Redwall ====
Storm and Pakatugg quickly found themselves at odds with their disharmonious personalities and they soon parted way. Storm attempted to find the way to Redwall by herself, meeting an eccentric hare named Tarquin L. Woodsorrel.

The two reached Redwall without further incident. Tarquin conversed with the badger mother Mellus while Storm got acquainted with Dandin and Saxtus, two resident mice. Despite the mousemaid&#x27;s aversion to baths, Storm eventually grew accustomed to life at Redwall. One night, Dandin, Saxtus, and Storm were enjoying themselves at the Abbot&#x27;s Jubilee Feast when Saxtus recited a strange, prophetic poem. The mousemaid let out a sudden cry and fell unconscious. Unbeknownst to the Redwallers, the story in the poem paralleled the events of Storm&#x27;s life and triggered the return of her memory.

The blind herbalist, Simeon, convinced Storm to tell them her newly recovered identity. Storm revealed that her real name was Mariel, and recounted her journey aboard the &quot;Periwinkle&quot; with her father, Joseph the Bellmaker. The &quot;Periwinkle&quot; was bound on a course for Salamandastron to deliver a massive bell to the current badger lord, Rawnblade Widestripe. Unfortunately, they were overtaken and boarded by a pirate ship under Saltar, who killed the &quot;Periwinkle&quot; crew after a brief struggle. Joseph and Mariel were taken to Terramort, and she was forced to serve at Gabool&#x27;s table.

Things went from bad to worse for the mousemaid when she unwittingly collided with Gabool in the midst of a fight the pirate king had picked with another pirate named Skullgor. Gabool finished off Skullgor, then turned his attention to the hapless mousemaid. Mariel snatched up Skullgor&#x27;s sword from the ground and managed to stun Gabool, but was knocked out by the pirate king&#x27;s henchmen before she could deal the killing blow. Embarrassed by his unexpected loss to a mere mousemaid, Gabool tied a heavy rock to Mariel&#x27;s leg and threw her into the sea. Luckily, her would be ball-and-chain was dashed to pieces during her fall and she managed to survive. Eventually waking up with nothing but her trusty rope after having been washed ashore.

==== The Quest Begins ====
Northwest of Redwall, Greypatch landed in Mossflower Woods aboard the &quot;Darkqueen&quot;, hotly pursued by Garrtail aboard the &quot;Greenfang&quot;. Greypatch easily massacred the crew of the &quot;Greenfang&quot; and burned the ship. Pakatugg, spotting the ship, followed the searat scouts, but was captured. When interrogated, the squirrel cracked and revealed the location of Redwall.

Back at Redwall, Mariel attempted to leave immediately in her quest to slay Gabool. Dandin, Mother Mellus, Tarquin, and Simeon were able to convince her to search for information on the whereabouts of Terramort first. All the inhabitants of Redwall searched the gatehouse for clues, unearthing a scroll by Fieldroan the Traveler. Information in hand, Mariel resolved to leave the next day alone. However, Martin the Warrior had other plans. During the night, his spirit visited Simeon and prompted the herbalist to give Dandin his deadly sword.

Early the next morning, Mariel set off as intended, alone, but ran into Tarquin L. Woodsorrel along the path. She insisted that she must make the trip alone, but the hare accompanied her anyway. Not long after, the duo encountered Dandin who had been waiting for them with a full picnic ready. Much to Mariel&#x27;s chagrin, the party gained yet another member, with the addition of Durry Quill, a Redwall hedgehog. Though furious initially, Mariel finally resigned herself to the fact that the trio was dead-set on accompanying her. The travellers came to a river and were abruptly confronted by a murderous heron named Iraktaan. The travellers&#x27; combined efforts were sufficient to subdue the vicious bird. Durry nearly lost his life crossing the pike-infested ford. After a nerve-wracking encounter with an adder and long hours of walking, the four found the &quot;otter and his wife,&quot; monolithic sculptures that were mentioned in the Terramort poem.

=== Book 2: The Strange Forest ===

==== The Flitchaye ====
After making their report to Lord Rawnblade, Clary, Thyme, and Rosie investigated the wreck of the &quot;Greenfang&quot; and traced its destruction to the &quot;Darkqueen&quot;, which has been left unguarded by Greypatch. Greypatch arrived at Redwall and parleyed with the Abbot in a bid to have the Abbey&#x27;s gates opened, but was injured by a rock-hard turnip. Fed up with the unpleasantness of their experiences on land since leaving the ship, a crew member named Bigfang inveigles the rest of the crew to abandon Greypatch and return to the &#x27;’Darkqueen&#x27;’. However, the &quot;Darkqueen&quot; had been commandeered by the three hares, who loosed a volley of arrows at the searats upon their return. After a long standoff, Kybo the searat convinces the crew to abandon the &quot;Darkqueen&quot; and return to Greypatch.

Mariel and her companions followed the path and entered a dense forest. In this forest, they detected a strange, cloying smell that induced drowsiness. The party fell asleep, and awoke to find themselves trussed to a tree, surrounded by creatures shrouded in barkcloth and weeds. They had been captured by a tribe of weasels called the Flitchaye and their leader Snidjer. Mariel broke them free of their bonds and beat furiously on the oak until help arrived in the form of a massive barn owl, Stonehead McGurney. The aptly named owl used his head as a battering ram, flinging the hapless weasels over the treetops. After introducing Mariel and company to his savage wife Thunderbeak and their four ravenous chicks, Stonehead offered to take them to the next location, the &quot;swampdark&quot;, mentioned in the poem the next morning.

Down south in Salamandastron, Lord Rawnblade was missing. The &quot;Waveblade&quot;, under Captain Orgeye, was grounded near Salamandastron and the badger lord came out of his mountain to do battle. Full of the Bloodwrath, Rawnblade slayed the entire corsair crew singlehandedly and set the ship on a course for Terramort.

==== Swampdark and the Sea ====
Near Redwall, the ship&#x27;s crew returned to Greypatch, who had formulated a fail-proof plan to take Redwall. Greypatch sent Bigfang to burn the gates with a shield of oarslaves. The pirate Kybo went to the east wall with grappling hooks to mount a surprise attack, while Greypatch&#x27;s company fired a barrage of projectiles as a distraction. At first, he feint attack appeared to be working and Kybo&#x27;s crew nearly scaled the east wall unnoticed. Unfortunately for the searats, three naughty Dibbuns equipped with knives appeared and gleefully sliced through the searats&#x27; ropes. It was a long drop to the forest floor below...

The Terramort questers were guided to swampdark, where Stonehead left them. The dimly-lit swamp proved treacherous, and Dandin almost lost his life in a bog. Nevertheless, the party finally reached the edge of the swamp, but became aware that they had been followed by a group of silent lizards. Mariel attempted to challenge and intimidate them, but the lizards made no move. The party left the swamp and traversed some hills to reach the coastline. There, they met a kindly old dormouse named Bobbo, who brought them home for tea. After introducing them to his pet newt Firl, Bobbo told them his life story— he was captured by Gabool the Wild and became a galley slave, but was left for dead.

As the rest turned in for the night, Mariel asked Bobbo for directions to Terramort, who told her about a swallow ornament that &quot;cannot fly south&quot;, a primitive compass. The next day, Bobbo led them to a deep pool. At the bottom was the swallow, trapped between two rocks and guarded by an enormous lobster. The five animals threw food into the water to satiate the crustacean&#x27;s appetite, and Mariel and Dandin descended into the murky, forbidding depths to retrieve the swallow.

=== Book 3: The Sound of a Bell! ===

==== The Search for the Swallow ====
After suffering an ignominious defeat, Greypatch hatched a new plan to attack the Abbey: fire-swingers! Greypatch convinced his sceptical crew to create scores of miniature boulders wrapped in flammable substances. Tied to vines and swung like oversized bolas, they made formidable incendiary weapons. Since none of their weapons could match the range of a fire-swinger, the Redwallers were defenceless against the onslaught of missiles. However, Colonel Clary, Brigadier Thyme, and Hon Rosie made their way to the Abbey and constructed special arrows out of yew staves. The well-trained hares stood on the Abbey ramparts and fired their far-reaching longbows, felling several of Greypatch&#x27;s rats. Pandemonium broke out among the searats, and they retreated out of range of the Abbey.

As the creatures of the Abbey put up a valiant defence, Dandin and Mariel encountered unexpected difficulties in their pursuit of the swallow. Dandin, with sword in paw, protected Mariel as she tried to dislodge the swallow. Mariel found that the metal swallow was wedged firmly between two rocks, and her vigorous motions to free it attracted the attention of the lobster. During the frenzied melee, Dandin dropped the Sword of Martin and was immobilized, with the creature&#x27;s claws at his back.

Mariel caught the sword and dealt the lobster a terrible blow, allowing Dandin to be rescued, hauled up on the rope around his waist. Unfortunately, the lobster wheeled around and locked onto the Sword of Martin. A tug-of-war ensued as Mariel was pulled up by her rope and the lobster clutched doggedly onto the opposite end of the sword. However, it releases its grip after being pelted by several rocks from the surface. Mariel and Dandin gasped for air on the shore, thankful to be alive but despondent at their failure to retrieve the swallow. With a twinkle in his eye, Bobbo handed them the swallow, explaining that Firl retrieved the swallow during the confusion. Bobbo then directed them to the burned out hulk of &quot;Greenfang&quot;, which remained seaworthy despite the damage. After a tearful farewell, the four questers set sail for Terramort, directed by the magnetic swallow.

In the aftermath of Greypatch&#x27;s attack, the hares and Mother Mellus discussed strategy. Though Redwall was secure from any pirate assault, Mother Mellus voiced her concern about the mistreated oarslaves held captive by Greypatch. In a commendable show of bravery, Clary readily agrees to do whatever he can to free them.

In the twilight, the three hares embarked on a covert mission to the pirate camp. As the tension mounted, Hon Rosie could not contain her mirth and let off a tremendous “Whoohahahahooh,” her signature, high-decibel laugh. All activity in the searat camp ceased and the hares were forced to flee. However, they managed to rescue two shrews during the turmoil.

Greypatch, infuriated by the incident and ordered tripwires and other traps to be set around the camp perimeter. Upon discovering these devices, Clary had Foremole dig a tunnel to the oarslaves. In the middle of the night, sleepy rats were surprised to see pairs of slaves vanishing straight into the ground. The internal conflict among the searats escalated into a duel for leadership between Bigfang and Greypatch. Greypatch overwhelmed Bigfang, forcing him into a campfire and killed him with a swift spear throw.

==== Diverging Roads to Terramort ====
Meanwhile, the travellers to Terramort were having problems of their own. In the thick fog wreathing the ocean, Mariel and Tarquin were unable to see a large ship bearing down on them. One of Gabool&#x27;s ships named the &quot;Seatalon&quot; rammed the &quot;Greenfang&quot; and all four travellers were thrown into the sea. Dandin and Durry were captured by the pirate ship. Mariel and Tarquin treaded water, using the hare&#x27;s harolina as a float.

The &quot;Seatalon&quot;’s captain, Catseyes, took Dandin’s sword for himself and consigned Dandin and Durry to the galleys as oarslaves. The two were treated cruelly by slavemaster Blodge and his puny assistant Clatt, who forced the slaves to row for Terramort. At night, however, a hooded mouse with silvery fur came aboard and handed out files to the slaves. He approached Captain Catseyes, claiming to be a courier from Gabool. The enigmatic mouse slayed Catseyes with a thrust from a dagger, and led a revolt to take over the &quot;Seatalon&quot;. Only then did he reveal his identity: Joseph the Bellmaker!

As for Mariel and Tarquin, they struggled to stay afloat and held an animated conversation until they are lifted aboard the &quot;Waveblade&quot; by Lord Rawnblade. They arrayed themselves in the searat regalia and landed at Terramort without being identified, despite a harrowing encounter with two pirate ships.

==== Last Stand of the Long Patrol ====
In the meantime, Colonel Clary, Brigadier Thyme, and the Honorable Rosie had run out of options. With Greypatch reaffirmed as leader, the remaining captive oarslaves and Pakatugg were secured in a cage made of branches. The hares decided that the only way to free the oarslaves would be at the cost of their lives. Heavily armed, they approached Greypatch’s camp and ordered Oak Tom, Treerose, and Rufe Brush to spirit away the oarslaves at their signal.

Upon entering the camp, the hares loosed shaft after shaft into the charging corsairs from their deadly longbows. Clary tossed Pakatugg a knife, and the lean squirrel bravely volunteers to die with the hares. When the hares finally exhausted their supply of arrows, the hares and Pakatugg brandished their lances and charged straight into the middle of the pirate crew with one last cry of “Eulaliaaaa!”

Weeping, the three squirrels made their way to Redwall with the last of the oarslaves. Upon hearing the news of the long patrol&#x27;s last stand, Mother Mellus and Flagg set out in the direction of the searat camp. They stumbled upon two searats preparing to deal the killing blow to Hon Rosie, but killed them before they had a chance. With the aid of Oak Tom and Rufe Brush, they carried the gravely wounded Hon Rosie to Redwall. Left with eighteen corsairs out of his former hundred, Greypatch finally decided to pack up and return to the &quot;Darkqueen&quot;.

At Terramort, Gabool and his captains saw the large form of Lord Rawnblade from afar. Three searat crews were dispatched to slay the badger. Once ashore, Rawnblade, Mariel, and Tarquin spotted Dandin and Durry. They met up, with the hordes of searats just behind them, and ran among some large rocks. Durry pushed aside a massive boulder, revealing the tunnel to Joseph&#x27;s secret hideout.

==== The Final Battle ====
As Durry broke the news to Mariel that her father was alive, the exuberant mousemaid, thrilled beyond measure, snatched the party&#x27;s sole torch and rushed down the tunnel only to be met with the hundreds of Terramort Resistance Against Gabool fighters. Joseph related his story and the two organised a large army of oarslaves dedicated to the destruction of Terramort.

After an argument over who would be the one to kill Gabool, Joseph uncovered his plan for a three-pronged assault on Fort Bladegirt through several tunnels. Mariel and Joseph would attack the fort from opposite sides as Tarquin battered down the main gates with a ram. Lord Rawnblade planned to break through the walls with a massive boulder and charge in. At first, the plan worked perfectly and the searats were completely caught off guard.

Mariel and Joseph&#x27;s slingers were cut down by arrow fire, Tarquin provided a loud distraction by ramming the gates. As Gabool fearfully watched the onslaught, Rawnblade entered the battle. Assailed by three searats at once, Joseph would have lost his life were it not for the timely intervention of Mariel&#x27;s Gullwhacker.

==== Into Gabool&#x27;s Lair ====
When the path was clear, Dandin, Mariel, Joseph, Durry, and Tarquin rushed into the fort after Rawnblade, who had gone in before them. Rawnblade, full of the bloodwrath, fearlessly banged on Gabool&#x27;s bell, challenging the pirate king. Gabool thrust a dagger into the badger&#x27;s chest and quickly retreated further into his lair. Fortunately, Rawnblade&#x27;s breastplate absorbed the impact. Mariel and the rest arrived as Rawnblade split the door into two halves and set off, hard on the heels of Gabool.

In the meantime, Gabool had set a trap. As his pursuers confronted him, he taunted Rawnblade, who furiously charged toward him. When the badger stepped on a carpet between him and Gabool, he plummeted down into a dark pit. A scorpion, Skrabblag, residing in the pit, quickly moved to attack. The spirit of Martin, however, took control of Rawnblade and prompted the badger to fling the poisonous creature out of the pit and onto the face of Gabool. The scorpion gripping, the searat with its pincers, struck Gabool&#x27;s head with its lethal stinger. Skrabblag detached himself from Gabool as the former pirate king convulsed and died. Dandin quickly killed the creature before it could do further harm, and the party left Terramort forever.

Durry, Tarquin, Dandin, and Joseph each commandeered one of the abandoned pirate ships, and set sail for Redwall with the Trag warriors and the bell. When they reached their destination, all Redwall came to greet them. An enormous feast was prepared, thereafter known as the Feast of the Bell Rising, so named for Rawnblade&#x27;s generous gift to the Abbey. Dandin&#x27;s friend Saxtus became Abbot, and Rufe Brush tied Martin&#x27;s sword to the roof of the Abbey, where it was later found by Samkim in the book &quot;Salamandastron&quot;. The famed Gullwhacker became the bellpull for the new Joseph Bell, and its owner accompanied Dandin as they sought out new adventures.

=== Translations ===
The Dutch translation by Annemarie Hormann does not include the final two chapters. Also, due to some alterations to the ending, the heroes never capture the &quot;Nightwake&quot;, the book ends with three ships sailing away as opposed to the four in the original version.

<text>The Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation(ZBC) is the state-owned broadcaster in Zimbabwe. It was established as the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation (RBC), taking its current name in 1980. Like the RBC before it, the ZBC has been accused of being a government mouthpiece with no editorial independence.

==History==

===Introduction of radio===
Radio was first introduced in the then Southern Rhodesia in 1933, in Belvedere in Salisbury by Imperial Airways, which was used to provide radio guidance and weather reports. However, it was not until 1941 that the first professional broadcaster was established. This was known as the Southern Rhodesia Broadcasting Service (SRBS), and was established to meet the needs of the colony&#x27;s white population. The same year, a second broadcaster, the Central African Broadcasting Station (CABS), was established, which had responsibility for broadcasting to African audiences in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and Nyasaland (now Malawi) as well as Southern Rhodesia.

Following the creation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953, the SRBS was renamed the Federal Broadcasting Service (FBS). The CABS, still based in Lusaka, continued to use African languages as well as English. In 1955, a Federal Commission of Enquiry into the organisation of broadcasting in the Federation proposed the creation of a new broadcasting organisation, to be called the &quot;Rhodesia and Nyasaland Broadcasting Corporation&quot;, which was to be established in 1956. However, it was not until 1958 that the FBS and CABS would be merged into the Federal Broadcasting Corporation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (FBC).

When the Federation was dissolved in 1963, the FBC was disbanded, and each territory acquired its own broadcasting service, which in Southern Rhodesia was initially known as the Southern Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation (SRBC). This later became known as the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation (RBC).

===Introduction of television===
Television was introduced on 14 November 1960, first in Salisbury, with transmissions in Bulawayo beginning seven months later. It was only the second such service in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria, and the first such service in Southern Africa, as South Africa did not introduce television until 1976.

It was initially operated by a private company, Rhodesia Television (RTV) on behalf of the then FBC, with its major shareholder being South African companies, including the Argus Group of newspapers, through its subsidiary, the Rhodesian Printing and Publishing Company, and also served Northern Rhodesia until its independence as Zambia. Other companies included Davenport and Meyer, the latter of which operated LM Radio, based in Mozambique, then under Portuguese rule.

Following the dissolution of the FBC in 1964, the Government of Southern Rhodesia attempted to take control of RTV through the RBC, whose chairman, J.M. Helliwell, announced that the RBC would acquire all shares in RTV, &quot;at a price agreed upon by both parties&quot;. This prompted criticism by MPs, one of whom, Vernon Brelsford, moved a motion in the Legislative Assembly deploring the proposed acquisition. He asked: &quot;Does it actually run the programmes to make sure that only its point of view is put over and no one else&#x27;s is?&quot;. Prime Minister Ian Smith argued that control of television was necessary for &quot;winning the war for the minds of men&quot;, and would save it from falling into the hands of &quot;communist sympathisers&quot;.

However, the government&#x27;s move was rejected by RTV&#x27;s directors. Instead, the RBC initially acquired a 51 per cent stake in the service, which became part of the RBC in 1976. RBC TV was funded by advertising and a television licence fee. Television reception was confined mainly to the cities and largest towns, and most viewers were whites. Umtali (now Mutare) only received television in 1972, by which time it was estimated that more than 90 per cent of the white population had access to the service. By 1973, RTV was broadcasting 42 hours a week from three transmitters, and 61 716 combined radio and television licences had been issued.

===Unilateral Declaration of Independence===
In November 1965, the white minority government of Ian Smith issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence, under which censorship of broadcasting and the press was imposed, and key posts at the RBC were gradually filled by supporters of the ruling Rhodesian Front party. The previous year, the Deputy Minister of Information, P. K. van der Byl, described the aims of his Ministry as &quot;not merely to disseminate information from an interesting point of view but to play its part in fighting the propaganda battle on behalf of the country&quot;. In response, the RBC Director General, James Neill, resigned, citing political interference.

On 1 January 1965, the RBC had ceased to relay the morning world news bulletin from the BBC, and replaced it with a bulletin from the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). However, afternoon and evening news relays of the BBC remained unchanged.

The British Government, which had denounced UDI as illegal, began broadcasting BBC programmes into Rhodesia by building a radio relay station in Francistown, in the then Bechuanaland Protectorate, now Botswana. The Rhodesian Government retaliated by clandestinely building a 400 000 watt transmitter nicknamed &quot;Big Bertha&quot;, in order to jam the signal from the smaller BBC transmitter. Programmes about Rhodesia were subjected to jamming, but other programmes were not affected. In 1968, the BBC ceased broadcasting from Francistown, and the relay station was transferred to the Government of Botswana.

Speaking at the opening of the new RBC Centre in Pocket Hill in 1970, President Clifford Dupont said that few other countries had been subject &quot;to such a barrage of hostile propaganda over the air&quot;, and that the new centre would contribute to the RBC&#x27;s very successful role &quot;in combatting this insidious offensive&quot;.

The RBC operated two main services, the English-language General Service (or National Network), aimed at the white audience, and the African Service, broadcasting in English, Shona and Ndebele, aimed at black listeners. The RBC also established three community stations with a multi-racial audience, Radio Jacaranda (Salisbury), Radio Matopos (Bulawayo) and Radio Manica (Umtali). In 1975, an Ndebele language service operating out of Bulawayo, known as Radio Mthwakazi, was established, using the &quot;Big Bertha&quot; transmitter previously used to jam the BBC&#x27;s broadcasts from Francistown. 
As armed opposition to white minority rule mounted in the 1970s, Africans in Rhodesia increasingly began to turn to short wave radio broadcasts from neighbouring countries, which carried programmes from exiled nationalist movements, with the Zimbabwe African National Union&#x27;s Voice of Zimbabwe operating from Mozambique, and the rival Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union&#x27;s Voice of the Revolution operating from Zambia.

In order to counter this, the RBC installed an FM network, while the government distributed FM-only receivers to chiefs and village headmen in the Tribal Trust Lands. It also ran campaigns promoting FM-only receivers, pointing out that they were exempt from the annual licence fee, and how short wave broadcasts were affected by static noise and required retuning between frequencies throughout the day.

===Transition to independence===
In 1979, following the adoption of a new constitution, Rhodesia was renamed Zimbabwe Rhodesia, and in common with other state institutions which were renamed, the state broadcaster was renamed the Zimbabwe Rhodesia Broadcasting Corporation (ZRBC) under an amendment to the Broadcasting Act. It also used the name &quot;Voice of Zimbabwe Rhodesia&quot; (VZR) on air. In addition, the change of name saw the debut of Mandy Mundawarara, the country&#x27;s first black television newsreader, whose father, Silas Mundawarara, had become Deputy Prime Minister in the government of Abel Muzorewa.

However, the Muzorewa government did not gain international recognition, and under the terms of the Lancaster House Agreement, the country officially reverted to British rule in December 1979 as Southern Rhodesia, with Lord Soames as governor. Despite this, the ZRBC&#x27;s name remained unchanged. It was only on 28 March 1980, three weeks before independence, that the word &quot;Rhodesia&quot; was finally dropped from the corporation&#x27;s title, and it adopted its present name, &quot;Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation&quot;.

A number of other senior BBC staff were sent to the country to advise Lord Soames on election broadcasting, and also help the ZRBC with their preparations for independence. In the run-up to elections being held in February 1980, the Governor&#x27;s Information Adviser held discussions with the ZRBC, leading the Election Commissioner agreed to a scheme to ensure that all parties standing in the elections should have equal free time on the public media.

==Post-independence==

===Reorganisation of services===
Following independence, radio services were reorganised, with three distinct networks being established: Radio One, the main English-language network, run by Africans but with some whites in key positions, Radio Two, combining the Harare and Radio Mthwakazi services and broadcasting in Shona and Ndebele, and Radio Three a completely new concept broadcasting to the under 45&#x27;s across all races, headed by Jill Baker and with all races disc jockeys presenting news updates, interviews and music from top of the pops to all genres of African music. It was enormously popular threatening to steal listenership from the other stations. Well loved disc jockeys included Josh Makawa, Mandy Mundawarara, Mike Mills, Busi Mhlanga, Keith Lindsay, Roy Brassington, John Matinde, Wellington Mbofana and Trish Johns. Radio Four was established in 1982, as an educational channel.

The legacy of economic sanctions meant that ZBC inherited antiquated equipment with spares difficult to obtain, as manufacturers no longer produced black and white television transmission equipment. In addition, the television service, now known as ZTV, only reached only 32 percent of the country&#x27;s territory.

The conversion to colour television began in late 1982, using the PAL B system. By this time, those with colour receivers could already watch imported programmes produced in colour. Colour transmissions were finally introduced in 1984. As much of the machinery had been in used for over two decades, and was now obsolete, it proved more economical to buy entirely new equipment than to replace it. A second television channel, available only in Harare, was introduced in 1986.

By the end of the 1990s, ZBC&#x27;s shortwave transmitters bought from Technology for Communications International in 1994 worth $40 million were now considered obsolete, triggering a parliamentary investigation that would culminate in the prosecution of a senior politician and ZBC officials responsible for sanctioning the purchase.

ZBC planned to introduce a subscription television service as early as 1993, but due to government and funding issues, the project was scrapped in 2000.

ZBC relaunched on 30 November 2001 following the signing of a new Broadcasting Act in April of the same year. The corporation was now divided into six strategic business units: Newsnet, Kidznet, Sportsnet, Radio Services, Production Services and Television Services.

===Local programming===
At independence, 30 per cent of television programming was locally produced. By late 1982, local programmes accounted for 40 per cent of output. While some programming was in Shona and Ndebele, 80 per cent of programming was in English, of which most was imported, mainly from the US, Britain and Australia. Despite this reliance on foreign content, in the 1980s, the locally produced drama &quot;The Mukadota Family&quot; became the most popular programme in the country. Other locally produced programmes included the Shona language drama &quot;Gringo Ndiani?&quot;, the video music show &quot;Mutinhimira weMimhanzi&quot;, later known as &quot;Ezomgido&quot;, the talk show &quot;Madzinza e Zimbabwe&quot;, dealing with traditional culture, and &quot;Psalmody&quot;, a Sunday morning gospel music programme.

===Accusations of pro-government bias===
As the 1957 Broadcasting Act remained in force, ZBC inherited RBC&#x27;s state monopoly on broadcasting, remaining accountable to the country&#x27;s Minister of Information. In a reflection of the new ZANU PF government&#x27;s political leanings, Robert Mugabe, previously described only as &quot;a terrorist leader&quot;, was now described as &quot;Comrade Prime Minister&quot;. In addition, most of the white staff left ZBC after independence, and many of the black staff who replaced them had previously worked in for radio services operated by the nationalist movements from exile in Zambia and Mozambique.

Those white journalists remaining came under pressure not to give coverage to certain topics that detracted from the new state&#x27;s socialist outlook, including unrest in Poland, then under communist rule, the British royal family and the late Chinese communist leader Mao Tse-tung, with those objecting being dismissed, including Derek Sones, who in 1981 was denounced by his editor, Grey Tichatonga as a &quot;good desk-man for a colonialist capitalist news organisation&quot; and an &#x27;unregenerated and unrehabilitated colonialist who was unable to change his ideas to fit in with socialist and revolutionary ZBC&quot;. However, black ZBC journalists also faced government interference in their work; in 1989, two were suspended after interviewing an academic, Kempton Makamure, who was critical of the government&#x27;s investment policies.

The ZBC was also accused of giving more emphasis to the role of Mugabe&#x27;s Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) in the fight for independence, and ignoring the role of Joshua Nkomo&#x27;s rival Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). In 1997, it was revealed that the ZBC had destroyed archive film of ZIPRA taken during the war. Expressing his dislike of independent broadcasting in 1995, Mugabe remarked &quot;you do not know what propaganda a non-state radio station might broadcast&quot;. Despite this, the government announced that the ZBC monopoly on broadcasting would be abolished by the end of 1997. Consequently, the ZBC&#x27;s second TV channel was discontinued and replaced by Joy TV, the country&#x27;s first independent channel, which operated on a lease agreement with the ZBC. This channel lasted until 2002, when it was controversially taken off the air for allegedly violating the Broadcasting Services Act.

During the 2002 presidential elections, the nightly news bulletin &quot;Newshour&quot; gave extensive coverage to the rallies of the ruling party, amounting to a quarter of airtime. In 2003, a study conducted by the Media Monitoring Project of Zimbabwe (MMPZ) in 2003 showed that one of the propaganda jingles, &quot;Rambai Makashinga&quot; or &quot;Continue Persevering&quot;, was being played 288 times a day on the four ZBC radio stations, and 72 times a day on ZBC television. In 2008, it found that 90 percent of the ZBC&#x27;s bulletins during the March elections were devoted to positive coverage of ZANU-PF, while in both the March and June elections, it dedicated 200 hours of coverage to ZANU-PF but just over 16 to the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), most of which was negative.

In 2015, Freedom House described ZBC coverage as overwhelmingly favouring ZANU-PF.

==Radio==
ZBC has six radio networks, which are;
*National FM - broadcasting news and current affairs in various indigenous languages,
*Radio Zimbabwe - broadcasts only in Shona and Ndebele,
*Power Fm (formerly Radio 3 / 3FM) - broadcasting pop music,
*Classic 263 (formerly Spot FM or SFM) - carrying sports, news and current affairs
*Khulumani FM - station designed for the metropolitan province of Bulawayo and Matabeleland region
*95.8 Central Radio - broadcasting for Gweru.

Local radio stations run hourly news bulletins which range from two minutes to the longest being a ten-minute bulletin on weekends and holidays. Presenters include, Admire Mhungu, Innocent Manyenga, Memory Chamisa and Keith Mawoyo.

On the national languages desk readers include Nqobile Malinga, Patience Machokoto, Taboka Ncube, Faith Nare, Lucy Ngosolo and Caroline Sithole. Bulletins come out live on Classic 263 at 7 am, 8 am, 1 pm, 6 pm and 8 pm and running from Monday to Friday. The anchors are Nomalanga Vuma, Theophilus Chuma, Ian Zvoma, Butler Nhepure and Jonathan Marerwa.

==Television==
ZBC&#x27;s television service now consists of a single channel, known as ZBC TV. The ZBC re-established a second TV channel of its own, Channel 2, in April 2010, but this station was decommissioned in August 2015. On 28 April 2022, ZBC launched Zimbabwe&#x27;s first youth-oriented television channel, Jive TV.

News bulletins include the morning &quot;Good Morning Zimbabwe&quot;, produced by Admire Mhungu, lunchtime news, &quot;Nhau Indaba&quot; and &quot;News Hour&quot;. Rumbidzai Takawira, the anchor, is usually the host of &quot;News Hour&quot;.

&quot;Battle of the Chefs&quot; is one of the first food-related reality TV shows to air on ZBC.

<doc id="1346180" wikidata="Q1756839" url="?curid=1346180" title="Lavalava">
<text>A lavalava, sometimes written as lava-lava, also known as an ″ie, short for &#x27;ie lavalava, is an article of daily clothing traditionally worn by Polynesians and other Oceanic peoples. It consists of a single rectangular cloth worn similarly to a wraparound skirt or kilt. The term &quot;lavalava&quot; is both singular and plural in the Samoan language.

==Customary use==
Today the fashion remains common in Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga and parts of Melanesia and Micronesia. It is worn by men and women in uses from school uniforms to business attire with a suit jacket and tie. Many people of Oceanic ethnicity wear the &quot;lavalava&quot; as an expression of cultural identity and for comfort within expatriate communities, especially in the United States (notably Hawaii, Alaska, California, Washington, and Utah), Australia and New Zealand.

==Attire==
The &quot;lavalava&quot; is secured around the waist by an overhand knotting of the upper corners of the cloth; women often tuck the loose ends into the waistband, while men usually allow them to hang in front. Women generally wear ankle-length &quot;lavalava&quot; while men&#x27;s wraps often extend to the knee or mid-calf depending on the activity or occasion.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the Pacific Ocean, the most prestigious &quot;lavalava&quot; were made by wrapping the body in a &quot;&#x27;ie toga&quot; with fine mats (finely woven textiles of pandanus leaves) or &quot;siapo&quot; (tapa cloth) pounded from paper mulberry or wild hibiscus bark. The Samoans also created &quot;lavalava&quot; from traditional materials such as flower petals, leaves, feathers and seashells tied to a wrap-around backing of plaited plant fibers.

Calico and loomed cotton cloth had largely replaced woven or barkcloth &quot;lavalava&quot; as articles of daily use (though &quot;″ie toga&quot; and &quot;siapo&quot; wraps are still used today for ceremonial and festive occasions and dance performances). Samoan men who bear the &quot;pe&#x27;a&quot; body tattoo, as well as Samoan women who bear the &quot;malu&quot; leg tattoos often roll the waistband of the &quot;lavalava&quot; or tuck in the sides and rear portion(s) of the &quot;lavalava&quot; to expose their tattoo during dance performances or ceremonial functions (such as &#x27;ava ceremonies), a style referred to as &quot;agini&quot;.

Within Micronesia, the introduced term “lavalava” is used to describe loom-woven skirts in the Outer Islands of Yap, though weaving and wearing of these textiles once extended further east into present-day Chuuk State. Worn around a woman&#x27;s hips, the fringed ends &quot;meet together at the front and are then wrapped to one side and secured by a belt.&quot; Among these Western Caroline Islanders, traditional loom weaving has been described as “highly developed” and weavers have long demonstrated “singular ingenuity and resourcefulness” in their work. The skirts’ cultural significance “far exceeds their function simply as items of daily wear.” The lava-lava is nothing less than a “highly condensed visual expression of social and economic relations, ritual affairs, and the aesthetic ideals of Micronesian society.” In addition to being worn daily by all females who have reached womanhood in the atolls of the Western Caroline Island, the skirts are also used for investiture, initiation and the burial of local leaders. While back-strap tension weaving of skirts remains a common practice in the Outer Islands of Yap in Micronesia, among migrants the practice is diminishing.

==Current forms==
Specially tailored linen &quot;lavalava&quot; which extend mid-calf, often with pockets and ties / buckles, are worn by men at special occasions or to church; these are always solid colors (in contrast to the bright patterns of everyday &quot;lava-lava&quot;) and are known as &quot;sulu&quot; (Fijian), &quot;″ie faitaga&quot; (Samoan), or &quot;tupenu&quot; (Tongan). Similar ankle-length skirts form the lower half of the two-piece formal dress worn by Samoan and Tongan women (called &quot;puletasi&quot; and &quot;puletaha&quot;, respectively). On special occasions the Tongan &quot;tupenu&quot; and &quot;puletaha&quot; are usually associated with a tapa cloth or waist-mat called &quot;ta&#x27;ovala&quot; and some Samoans still wear a tapa cloth &quot;vala&quot; sash in similar fashion (though the &quot;vala&quot; is generally restricted to ceremonial / festive regalia of orators or people acting / dressing as &quot;taupou&quot; maidens and &quot;manaia&quot; beaus). The formal, tailored linen &quot;lavalava&quot; styles of Tonga, Samoa, and Fiji originated with the Fijian noble Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna who introduced the buckled &quot;sulu&quot; to Fiji in 1920 following his military service and university education in Europe.
Loudly colored &quot;lavalava&quot; made from materials such as satin, velvet, polyester, and sequins have recently been popularized among performance dance groups and village, church, or school-based choirs.

==Related names and garments==
In English, such garments are generically called sarong, but that word is actually Malay, whereas &quot;lavalava&quot; is Samoan, being short for &quot;ʻie lavalava&quot; (cloth that wraps around). Another common name for the Polynesian variety is &quot;pāreu&quot; (usually spelled &quot;pareo&quot;), which is the Tahitian name. In Tonga, the garment is called tupenu. In New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna, lavalava are called &quot;manou&quot;. A similar simple kind of clothing is the &quot;lap-lap&quot; worn in Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific, which is completely open at both sides.

<doc id="1346182" wikidata="Q223488" url="?curid=1346182" title="Isochron dating">
<text>Isochron dating is a common technique of radiometric dating and is applied to date certain events, such as crystallization, metamorphism, shock events, and differentiation of precursor melts, in the history of rocks. Isochron dating can be further separated into &quot;mineral isochron dating&quot; and &quot;whole rock isochron dating&quot;; both techniques are applied frequently to date terrestrial and extraterrestrial rocks (meteorites and Moon rocks). The advantage of isochron dating as compared to simple radiometric dating techniques is that no assumptions are needed about the initial amount of the daughter nuclide in the radioactive decay sequence. Indeed, the initial amount of the daughter product can be determined using isochron dating. This technique can be applied if the daughter element has at least one stable isotope other than the daughter isotope into which the parent nuclide decays.

==Basis for method==

All forms of isochron dating assume that the source of the rock or rocks contained unknown amounts of both radiogenic and non-radiogenic isotopes of the daughter element, along with some amount of the parent nuclide. Thus, at the moment of crystallization, the ratio of the concentration of the radiogenic isotope of the daughter element to that of the non-radiogenic isotope is some value independent of the concentration of the parent. As time goes on, some amount of the parent decays into the radiogenic isotope of the daughter, increasing the ratio of the concentration of the radiogenic isotope to that of the non-radiogenic isotope of the daughter element. The greater the initial concentration of the parent, the greater the concentration of the radiogenic daughter isotope will be at some particular time. Thus, the ratio of the radiogenic to non-radiogenic isotopes of the daughter element will become larger with time, while the ratio of parent to daughter will become smaller. For rocks that start out with a small concentration of the parent, the radiogenic/non-radiogenic ratio of the daughter element will not change as quickly as it will with rocks that start out with a large concentration of the parent.

== Assumptions ==
An isochron diagram will only give a valid age if all samples are &quot;cogenetic&quot;, which means they have &quot;the same initial isotopic composition&quot; (that is, the rocks are from the same unit, the minerals are from the same rock, etc.), all samples have the same initial isotopic composition (at t0), and the system has remained closed.

==Isochron plots==

The mathematical expression from which the isochron is derived is

formula_1

where

: &quot;t&quot; is age of the sample,
: &quot;D&quot;* is number of atoms of the radiogenic daughter isotope in the sample,
: &quot;D&quot;0 is number of atoms of the daughter isotope in the original or initial composition,
: n is number of atoms of the parent isotope in the sample at the present, 
: &quot;λ&quot; is the decay constant of the parent isotope, equal to the inverse of the radioactive half-life of the parent isotope times the natural logarithm of 2, and
: (&quot;e&quot;λ&quot;t&quot;-1) is the slope of the isochron which defines the age of the system.
Because the isotopes are measured by mass spectrometry, ratios are used instead of absolute concentrations since mass spectrometers usually measure the former rather than the latter. (See the section on isotope ratio mass spectrometry.) As such, isochrons are typically defined by the following equation, which normalizes the concentration of parent and radiogenic daughter isotopes to the concentration of a non-radiogenic isotope of the daughter element that is assumed to be constant:

formula_2

where

:formula_3 is the concentration of the non-radiogenic isotope of the daughter element (assumed constant),
:formula_4 is the present concentration of the radiogenic daughter isotope, 
:formula_5 is the initial concentration of the radiogenic daughter isotope, and

:formula_6 is the present concentration of the parent isotope that has decayed over time formula_7.
To perform dating, a rock is crushed to a fine powder, and minerals are separated by various physical and magnetic means. Each mineral has different ratios between parent and daughter concentrations. For each mineral, the ratios are related by the following equation:

:formula_8          (1)

where

:formula_9 is the initial concentration of the parent isotope, and
:formula_10 is the total amount of the parent isotope which has decayed by time formula_7.

The proof of (1) amounts to simple algebraic manipulation. It is useful in this form because it exhibits the relationship between quantities that actually exist at present. To wit, formula_12, formula_13 and formula_3 respectively correspond to the concentrations of parent, daughter and non-radiogenic isotopes found in the rock at the time of measurement.

The ratios formula_15or formula_16 (relative concentration of present daughter and non-radiogenic isotopes) and formula_17 or formula_18 (relative concentration of present parent and non-radiogenic isotope) are measured by mass spectrometry and plotted against each other in a three-isotope plot known as an &quot;isochron plot&quot;. 

If all data points lie on a straight line, this line is called an isochron. The better the fit of the data points to a line, the more reliable the resulting age estimate. Since the ratio of the daughter and non-radiogenic isotopes is proportional to the ratio of the parent and non-radiogenic isotopes, the slope of the isochron gets steeper with time. The change in slope from initial conditions—assuming an initial isochron slope of zero (a horizontal isochron) at the point of intersection (intercept) of the isochron with the y-axis—to the current computed slope gives the age of the rock. The slope of the isochron, formula_19 or formula_20, represents the ratio of daughter to parent as used in standard radiometric dating and can be derived to calculate the age of the sample at time &quot;t&quot;. The y-intercept of the isochron line yields the initial radiogenic daughter ratio, formula_21.

Whole rock isochron dating uses the same ideas but instead of different minerals obtained from one rock uses different types of rocks that are derived from a common reservoir; e.g. the same precursor melt. It is possible to date the differentiation of the precursor melt which then cooled and crystallized into the different types of rocks.

One of the best known isotopic systems for isochron dating is the rubidium–strontium system. Other systems that are used for isochron dating include samarium–neodymium, and uranium–lead. Some isotopic systems based on short-living extinct radionuclides such as 53Mn, 26Al, 129I, 60Fe and others are used for isochron dating of events in the early history of the Solar System. However, methods using extinct radionuclides give only relative ages and have to be calibrated with radiometric dating techniques based on long-living radionuclides like Pb-Pb dating to give absolute ages.

==Application==
Isochron dating is useful in the determination of the age of igneous rocks, which have their initial origin in the cooling of liquid magma. It is also useful to determine the time of metamorphism, shock events (such as the consequence of an asteroid impact) and other events depending on the behaviour of the particular isotopic systems under such events. It can be used to determine the age of grains in sedimentary rocks and understand their origin by a method known as a provenance study.

<doc id="1346197" wikidata="Q5182934" url="?curid=1346197" title="Crawford v. Washington">
<text>Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), is a landmark United States Supreme Court decision that reformulated the standard for determining when the admission of hearsay statements in criminal cases is permitted under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The Court held that prior testimonial statements of witnesses who have since become unavailable may not be admitted without cross-examination.

== Background==
Michael Crawford and his wife Sylvia Crawford confronted Kenneth Lee over an allegation that Lee had attempted to rape Mrs. Crawford. Michael Crawford stabbed Lee in the torso. Crawford claimed he had acted in self-defense when he believed Lee had picked up a weapon. Lee denied doing anything that might make Crawford believe he was trying to attack him.

Both Mr. and Mrs. Crawford were questioned by police after receiving a Miranda warning. Mr. Crawford said to the police that he was not sure if Mr. Lee had a weapon, but that Crawford believed at the time that Lee did. Mrs. Crawford, being interrogated separately, at first said that she had not seen the attack, but under further questioning said that she had seen the attack and that Lee was not holding a weapon.

=== Trial proceeding ===
At trial, Mrs. Crawford could not be compelled to testify by the state, since Washington&#x27;s spousal privilege law states that a spouse cannot testify in court without the accused spouse&#x27;s consent (except when a spouse is a complainant). The deputy prosecutor, Robert Lund, sought to introduce Mrs. Crawford&#x27;s statement to the police as evidence that Mr. Crawford had no reasonable belief that he was in danger from Mr. Lee. Generally, out-of-court statements by persons other than the accused are excluded as hearsay. But Washington invoked a hearsay exception for statements against penal interest.

The defense counsel objected to the admission of the wife&#x27;s statement, on the ground that Mr. Crawford would be unable to confront (i.e., cross-examine) Mrs. Crawford on her statement without waiving spousal privilege, and that this would be a violation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The court allowed the statement to be admitted on the basis that the statement was reliable, as it was partially corroborated by Mr. Crawford&#x27;s statement to police, amongst other things.

The statement was allowed into evidence at the trial, and the prosecution relied on it heavily in its closing argument, stating that it completely refuted the defendant&#x27;s claim of self defense.

=== Procedural history ===

Michael Crawford was convicted at the trial level. However, the Washington Court of Appeals reversed that decision. After applying a nine-factor test to determine whether Sylvia&#x27;s statement was reliable, and therefore admissible under the doctrine of &quot;Ohio v. Roberts&quot;, the court determined it was not, and gave several reasons why. Nonetheless, the Washington Supreme Court reinstated the conviction, ruling that the witness&#x27;s statement was reliable under &quot;Roberts&quot;. In particular, the court noted that Michael and Sylvia Crawford&#x27;s statements interlocked, and therefore concluded that Sylvia&#x27;s statements were admissible.

=== Discussion ===
The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment (applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment) provides: &quot;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right… to be confronted with the witnesses against him.&quot; This right has a very specific purpose. The focus of the Clause is on getting the truth out of a witness, and allowing a trier of fact to determine whether the witness indeed told the truth. Even given these important goals, this right is not absolute.

Admission of out-of-court statements, therefore, is and has been possible. For over 20 years prior to &quot;Crawford,&quot; the controlling standard for admitting statements that unavailable witnesses made to other persons was that of &quot;Ohio v. Roberts.&quot; According to the Court in &quot;Roberts,&quot; if a witness is unavailable, that witness&#x27;s testimony can be admitted through a third person if it bears &quot;adequate indicia of reliability.&quot; This was true if a statement fell within a &quot;firmly rooted hearsay exception&quot; or had &quot;particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.&quot;

When Michael Crawford was accused of stabbing Kenneth Lee on August 5, 1999, the &quot;Roberts&quot; standard was still controlling law. Crawford and his wife, Sylvia, were questioned separately by police regarding a stabbing incident that had taken place at Lee&#x27;s home. The statements of the two were generally corroborating, but while Michael had claimed self-defense, Sylvia implied that Michael was not protecting himself when he stabbed Lee. At trial, the state moved to admit Sylvia&#x27;s statement under &quot;Roberts.&quot; The trial court admitted the evidence, &quot;noting several reasons why it was trustworthy.&quot;

== Supreme Court decision and rationale ==

The United States Supreme Court held that the use of the spouse&#x27;s recorded statement made during police interrogation violated the defendant&#x27;s Sixth Amendment right to be confronted with the witnesses against the defendant where the spouse, because of the state law marital privilege, did not testify at the trial and so was unavailable.

Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, expressed concern over the inconsistent results reached by courts under &quot;Ohio v. Roberts&quot;, the standard used by the Washington state courts. He thought the Crawford decisions of the various levels of Washington state courts epitomized this problem. Justice Scalia gave a thorough history of the Confrontation Clause, explaining how the Clause became part of the Constitution using famous English cases, such as that of Sir Walter Raleigh. He then described the context in which the Constitutional Framers drafted the clause, and displayed how early American courts interpreted the clause.

This history, Scalia concluded, clearly shows that the Confrontation Clause was directed at keeping &quot;ex parte&quot; examinations out of the evidentiary record. Specifically, the Confrontation Clause applies to &quot;witnesses&quot; against the accused, meaning those who &quot;bear testimony.&quot; Relying on this and the historical record, Scalia stated, &quot;the Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.&quot; Scalia determined that a prior opportunity for cross-examination was mandatory, and dispositive of whether or not testimonial statements of an unavailable witness are admissible. Testimonial statements are formal declarations, i.e., those made to law enforcement or government personnel. &quot;Dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty.&quot;

The &quot;Crawford&quot; Court determined that where non-testimonial statements are involved, the Confrontation Clause allows a court to use its discretion to determine the reliability of the statements. &quot;Where testimonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination. . . . [T]he only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.&quot;

==Concurrence==

Chief Justice William Rehnquist concurred in the result, but would have decided the case on narrower grounds, within the older &quot;Roberts&quot; framework. Rehnquist, joined by O&#x27;Connor, stated he would not have expanded the right of defendants to exclude out-of-court statements on the basis that they could not confront the witness.

== Subsequent developments ==

This decision had an immediate, profound effect upon the ability of prosecutors to prove their cases through the use of evidence that had previously been admissible via various exceptions to the hearsay rule. Justice Scalia&#x27;s opinion explicitly states that any out-of-court statement that is &quot;testimonial&quot; in nature is not admissible, unless the declarant is unavailable to testify in court, &quot;and&quot; the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him or her. However, the opinion does not define &quot;testimonial,&quot; which has allowed courts across the country to determine that issue for themselves.

Legal scholars&#x27; main criticism of the decision was the courts&#x27; failure to define &quot;testimonial.&quot; One of the main areas in which lower courts struggled to resolve this issue was the use of 911 calls during the course of trial where the caller is not available to testify. This was the factual situation in &quot;Davis v. Washington,&quot; in which the Court laid out a definition of &quot;testimonial.&quot; Other cases have dealt with the issue of the previously common practice of admitting certain types of certified documents under the business records or public records exception to the hearsay rule.

&quot;Crawford,&quot; and the decisions following it, also radically changed the handling of domestic violence cases by curtailing evidence-based prosecution, a common practice, which allows the accused to be prosecuted without the participation of their accusers in the criminal court process. Evidence-based prosecution relies heavily on admission of statements under hearsay exceptions to reproduce the evidentiary effect of a victim testifying in court. The &quot;Crawford&quot; Court&#x27;s decision renders most of these statements inadmissible without the accuser coming to court and testifying against the person he or she is accusing.

<text>Tenley Emma Albright (born July 18, 1935) is an American former figure skater and surgeon. She is the 1956 Olympic champion, the 1952 Olympic silver medalist, the 1953 and 1955 World Champion, the 1953 and 1955 North American champion, and the 1952–1956 U.S. national champion. Albright is also a graduate of Harvard Medical School. In 2015, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Albright was born in Newton, Massachusetts. Her father Hollis was a prominent surgeon and her mother Elin was an artist. She has a younger brother, Nile.

== Career ==

=== Figure skating ===
She began skating at age 8, on a homemade rink in the backyard of her family home.

In 1946, Albright contracted polio, which was deemed to be pre-paralytic. As figure skating historian James R. Hines put it: &quot;Skating provided much needed physical therapy.&quot; Since her illness left her muscles “weak and withered”, she started training at the Skating Club of Boston as part of her rehabilitation. She found her rehabilitation &quot;exhilarating&quot;. She would later say: &quot;Did you ever notice how many athletes my age once had polio? I think it&#x27;s because being paralyzed makes you aware of your muscles and you never want to let them go unused again.&quot;

Albright had two coaches in her career: Willie Frick and Maribel Vinson. She won the silver medal at the 1952 Olympics. She won her first World title in 1953, silver in 1954, a second gold medal in 1955, and her fourth medal, another silver, in 1956. She was the first American female skater to win a world title. In 1955, she recorded a triple: winning the US, North American, and World Championships that year. She managed to do this while enrolled as a full-time pre-med student at Radcliffe College.

Albright won the US Nationals Novice Championships at the age of 13 and the US Junior Championships at the age of 14, and then won five consecutive national titles starting at age 16. In 1956, while training for the Olympics, Albright fell due to a rut in the ice and cut her right ankle joint to the bone with her left skate. The cut was stitched by her father, a surgeon. At the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy, she became the first American female skater to win an Olympic gold medal.

Albright retired from competitive skating after 1956 but remained attached to figure skating as a sports functionary.

In 1982, Albright became a vice president of the U.S. Olympic Committee.

=== Medicine ===
A graduate of The Winsor School in Boston, Albright entered Radcliffe College in 1953 as a pre-med student, and focused on completing her education after the 1956 Olympics. She graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1961 at the age of 25, went on to become a surgeon. She practiced for 23 years, continuing as a faculty member and lecturer at Harvard Medical School. 

She chaired the Board of Regents of the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. She has served as director for non-profits such as the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and companies such as West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., and State Street Bank and Trust Company.

In 1976 she served as the chief physician for the US Winter Olympic team. The American Academy of Achievement presented her with a Golden Plate Award in 1976. Her accomplishments earned her an induction into the International Women&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1983.

==Personal life==

Albright married to Tudor Gardiner, a lawyer and son of William Tudor Gardiner, in 1962. Together they had three daughters. The couple divorced and in 1981, she married former Ritz-Carlton hotel owner Gerald Blakeley. He shared her association with Woods Hole and was chair of the Morehouse School of Medicine. Blakeley died on July 2, 2021.

<doc id="1346227" wikidata="Q826041" url="?curid=1346227" title="Siberut">
<text>Siberut is the largest and northernmost of the Mentawai Islands, located 150 kilometres west of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean. It covers an area of 3,838.25 km2 including smaller offshore islands, and had a population of 35,091 at the 2010 Census and 40,220 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 41,899. A part of Indonesia, the island is the most important home for the Mentawai people. The western half of the island was set aside as the Siberut National Park in 1993. Much of the island is covered with rainforest, but is subject to commercial logging.

Smaller islands adjacent to Siberut include Karamajet and Masokut which lie in the Bungalaut Strait to the south of the island.

The island is known for its range of primates, including the Kloss gibbon (&quot;Hylobates klossii&quot;), pig-tailed langur (&quot;Simias concolor&quot;), Siberut langur (&quot;Presbytis siberu&quot;) and Mentawai macaque (&quot;Macaca pagensis&quot;).

Siberut was affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake tsunami, but without any known loss of human life. One report stated that the island may have been raised up to two metres by the earthquake.

==Geography==
Siberut Island has a hot and humid tropical rainforest climate, with an annual rainfall of . Temperatures range from , and humidity averages 81–85%. The east coast has many islets, bays and coral reefs, and is covered with mangrove forest extending up to wide before giving way to nipah forest. The west coast features mainly &quot;Barringtonia&quot; forests and is difficult to get to because of rough seas and steep cliffs. The hilly interior elevates to , with many streams eventually forming rivers in the sago-grove lowlands and swamp forests. There are also areas of dipterocarp primary forest.

===Biodiversity===
Siberut has been isolated from the mainland Sunda shelf since the Middle Pleistocene. This isolation has led to a much biodiversity, with about 900 species of vascular plants and 31 mammal species. Sixty-five percent of mammals and fifteen percent of other animals are endemic at some taxonomic level, making Siberut unique. Of the 134 bird species found on Siberut, 19 are endemic at some taxonomic level.
There are four endemic primates: the bokkoi (&quot;Macaca pagensis&quot;), lutung Mentawai/joja (&quot;Presbytis potenziani siberu&quot;), bilou (&quot;Hylobates klossii&quot;) and simakobu (&quot;Simias concolor siberu&quot;).

===Environment===
Siberut was recognized as a biosphere reserve in 1981. In 1993, the western part of the island was designated as a national park, covering an area of .

About 70% of the remaining forest outside the reserve is subject to logging concessions, some operative and others pending.

In 2001, UNESCO brought in a new phase of its Siberut Programme, with the intention of protecting the ecosystem through local development. This phase involves creating a partnership of local communities, conservation groups and local government, an approach which appears to be popular locally. However, poor governance and corruption has led to substantial illegal logging.

==Culture==
Some anthropologists believe that several thousand years ago, the Bataks of North Sumatra may have been the first to settle here. However, there are now substantial differences in culture and language among the inhabitants. The Swiss anthropologist, Reimar Schefold spent years among the Siberut groups, the Sakuddei.

On the western parts of the island, there is a tradition of communal long houses known as &quot;uma&quot;.

<text>The Society of Cogers () is a free speech society, established in 1755 in the City of London. It is the oldest debating society in the world and one of the oldest speaking gatherings of any kind.

==History and concept==

The name &quot;Cogers&quot; comes from Descartes&#x27; famous assertion, &quot;Cogito ergo sum&quot; (I think, therefore I am). As a &quot;Society of Thinkers&quot;, the Cogers is dedicated to the philosophy of letting everyone express their thoughts. The aims of the Cogers were the promotion of the liberty of the subject and the freedom of the Press, the maintenance of loyalty to the laws, the rights and claims of humanity and the practice of public and private virtue.

The first meeting in 1755 was at the White Bear Inn (now St Brides Tavern), Fleet Street. Meetings were held on Saturday evenings.

In around 1850 it moved to Discussion Hall, Shoe Lane, and in 1871 migrated to the Barley Mow Inn, Salisbury Square, E.C.1, where it remained until the 1960s. Attendances went into decline during the 1970s and 80s. By the mid-90s, the original society had split into two rival factions.

In July 1997 Magnus Nielsen opened a third meeting in Cornhill on the 2nd Monday of each month. This meeting has now moved location to the Old Bank of England in the Strand. The two Saturday night societies have since closed.

Previous members and visitors to the society include founding member John Wilkes, Charles Dickens, William Ewart Gladstone, Benjamin Disraeli, Daniel O&#x27;Connell, and many others throughout its 250-year history.

==Format==
Members meet monthly at pubs in the centre and outside London and begin the evening by having an impartial host rounding up the current affairs of the last month. Then all participants may take turns to have their own five minutes on the podium expressing their views as to what, what&#x27;s not, and what not on any subjects they feel they would like to bring to the evening. It may be reactions to the previous speakers or their own topics.

The meetings are chaired by the &quot;Grand&quot;, who maintains order and also regulates the timing of speeches. The meeting starts with an &quot;Opener&quot;, who gives a 15-minute résumé, inviting topics for discussion.

At the end of the evening the traditional &quot;Apple of Discord&quot; is presented by the &quot;Evaluator&quot; to the best speaker of the evening to the speaker who throughout the evening brought the greatest contribution, whether that be thoughtful, entertaining, controversial or outstanding. Participants also have the opportunity to get tips from the evaluator on what their strengths and potentials are.

<doc id="1346240" wikidata="Q63314" url="?curid=1346240" title="Elizabeth Manley">
<text>Elizabeth Ann Manley, CM (born August 7, 1965) is a Canadian former competitive figure skater. She is the 1988 Olympic silver medallist, the 1988 World silver medalist and a three-time Canadian national champion.

==Early life and training==
Manley was born in 1965 in Belleville, Ontario, and raised in Trenton. She is the fourth child and only daughter in her family. Her father&#x27;s military career necessitated occasionally moving, and when Manley was eight years old, her family moved from Trenton to Ottawa. After her parents&#x27; divorce in the 1970s, she was raised by her mother, Joan.

== Competitive career ==
Manley began skating at an early age. Her mother invested time and money in her daughter&#x27;s figure skating career.

Manley won the bronze medal at the 1982 World Junior Championships in Oberstdorf, Germany. Later that season, she competed at her first senior World Championships and finished 13th in Copenhagen, Denmark.

In the 1982–83 season, Manley relocated from Ottawa to Lake Placid, New York, to receive more intensive training but became depressed and homesick, which resulted in her hair falling out and weight gain. She finished off the podium at the Canadian Championships and briefly dropped out of the sport, but resumed her skating career after Peter Dunfield and Sonya Dunfield agreed to coach her in Ontario. They worked with her at the Gloucester Skating Club in Orleans, Ontario.

Manley competed at the 1984 Winter Olympics, placing 13th, and the World Championships between 1984 and 1987. At the 1987 Worlds, she was in a position to vie for the world title after compulsory figures and the short program, but a poor result in the long program left her in fourth place overall in the competition.

Entering the 1988 Winter Olympics, few skating know-hows and media analysts considered Manley to be a contender for an Olympic medal. Battling illness, she nevertheless did well in compulsory figures and the short program. Heading into the long program, she was in third place behind the East German skater Katarina Witt and the American skater Debi Thomas. Witt and Thomas were both favourites for the gold medal, and the media had dubbed their rivalry as the &quot;Battle of the Carmens&quot;, as both women chose to skate to music from the opera &quot;Carmen&quot;. Witt skated her long program cleanly but conservatively, and Thomas fell apart in her long program. Elizabeth Manley, however, gave the performance of her career, one so widely recognized as a very special performance that announcer Jim McKay said, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if every human being could have a moment like this once in their lives?&quot; Manley won the long program and came within a fraction of a point of beating Witt for the Olympic title. Figure skating writer and historian Ellyn Kestnbaum calls Manley&#x27;s Olympic free skating program &quot;athletic&quot;, with a triple loop, a triple lutz, a Salchow jump, and a toe loop jump. Kestnbaum also states that Manley skated with &quot;a cheerful and outgoing style that...[was] pleasing to the audience&quot;. Her come-from-behind placement made her a national celebrity in Canada.

After winning the silver medal at the 1988 World Championships, Manley retired from amateur skating.

== Later career ==
Manley performed in ice shows and television specials, and competed in professional events, for a number of years afterwards, being notable for her unusually imaginative programs. She now works as a figure skating coach and occasional media commentator. In 1988, she was made a Member of the Order of Canada.

In 1990, Manley published an autobiography: &quot;Thumbs Up!&quot;; a second volume of autobiography, &quot;As I Am: My Life After the Olympics&quot;, followed in 1999.

In September 1990, radio personality The Real Darren Stevens launched a radio stunt, admitting that he suffered from a rare affliction: he was a Canadian who couldn&#x27;t skate. While on the air, he openly &quot;stalked&quot; fellow Ottawa native Manley and begged her to teach him how to skate. Finally, after several months, Manley replied in January 1991, put skates on Stevens, and taught him how to skate.

Manley starred as Red Riding Hood in CBC&#x27;s 1992 television film &quot;The Trial of Red Riding Hood&quot; which premiered on the Disney Channel two years later.

In 2014, she was inducted into the Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.
== Personal life ==
Manley married television producer David N. Rosen in June 2019.

Manley is a spokesperson for mental health issues due to her own battle with depression, which began before the 1984 Olympics. As of 2009, she is also an official spokesperson for Ovarian Cancer Canada&#x27;s Winners Walk of Hope. Her mother died from ovarian cancer in July 2008 and her father died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2010.

She is also spokesperson for Herbal Magic weight loss.

<text>Todd James Eldredge (born August 28, 1971) is an American former competitive figure skater. He is the 1996 World champion, a six-time U.S. national champion (1990, 1991, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2002), a three-time Olympian (1992, 1998, 2002), and a six-time World medalist.

== Career ==
Eldredge began skating when he was five years old and moved from Chatham, Massachusetts, to Philadelphia at age ten to train with Richard Callaghan. He later trained at the Detroit Skating Club in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan and at the Onyx in Rochester Hills, Michigan. He won silver at the 1987 World Junior Championships and then gold in 1988. He took bronze at the 1988 Skate America.

In the 1989–90 season, Eldredge won his first senior national title and was sent to the 1990 World Championships, where he finished fifth. The following season, he repeated as the national champion and then took the bronze medal at the 1991 World Championships. Although Eldredge missed the 1992 U.S. Championships, he was nominated to represent the U.S. at the 1992 Winter Olympics. He placed tenth in Albertville and then seventh at the 1992 World Championships.

Eldredge struggled during the next two seasons, coming sixth at the 1993 U.S. Championships and fourth in 1994, and was not selected for the 1994 Olympics. He regained momentum in the 1994–95 season, taking silver at the 1994 Goodwill Games and gold at the 1994 Skate America and 1994 NHK Trophy. He then won his third national title and silver at the 1995 World Championships. In 1996, he came away with silver at the U.S. Championships but won gold at the 1996 World Championships.

In the 1996-1997 season Eldredge started off on fire, easily beating Alexei Urmanov (who also skated cleanly) to win Skate America. He controversially lost the Grand Prix final to Elvis Stojko who landed the first ever quadruple-triple combination, but had other errors, including a fall on his 2nd triple axel. Eldredge skated a clean and more complete program, but suffered from the home country scoring of the event in Canada. He regained his U.S title easily, in the absence of defending Champion Rudy Galindo, who was now professional. At the World Championships Eldredge skated a spectacular short program, but due to the very early draw he finished 2nd to Alexei Urmanov who skated near the very end. The top 6 were all clean with triple axel-triple toe combinations. Elvis Stojko though came from 4th to win the gold after a flawless long program with a quadruple-triple combination. Eldredge first singled, then later fell on his 2nd triple axel try, sealing his fate when combined with that he also didn&#x27;t have a quadruple jump to begin with.

In the pivotal year of his career in 1997-1998, Eldredge suffered through a sluggish grand prix circuit. First winning Skate America with an uninspiring skate, after injuring himself in warm up. Then placing only 4th at Trophee Lalique, won by rising start Alexei Yagudin. He controversially finished 3rd at the Grand Prix final where most believed he deserved at least 2nd place above Elvis Stojko. He skated cleanly, apart from a doubled triple loop, and strangely lost to Stojko who fell on his quadruple attempt. He then finished fourth at his second Olympics, in Nagano, after a crushing long program performance, managing only 5 of 8 planned triples, when a clean skate would have garnered him at least silver comfortably. He rebounded to win silver at a watered down World Championships in his home country, an event missing all 3 Olympic medalists. A fall in the short program cost him the gold to rising star Alexei Yagudin, despite comfortably winning the long program with a strong skate.

Eldredge continued to compete in pro ams and leave the door open for a return to amateur figure skating. In 2000, he landed his first quadruple jump in competition at the Masters of Figure Skating. He competed in various events through the 1999-2000 season, yet oddly did not skate at the World Championships. Eldredge withdrew from the 2001 Four Continents Championships due to an ankle injury. He returned to the U.S Championships for the first time since 1998, and took silver behind Tim Goebel, but then edged Goebel for the bronze at the World Championships where most felt he deserved silver over an injured and flawed Alexei Yagudin. In 2002, he won his sixth U.S. title and placed sixth in his third Olympic appearance. After retiring from competition, he toured with Stars on Ice.

Eldredge was inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame during the 2008 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. On January 31, 2011, the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame announced Eldredge as a nominee for an outstanding competitor in the men&#x27;s category.

Eldredge formerly coached at the Germain Arena in Estero, Florida. In April 2012, he underwent left hip replacement surgery. Beginning in 2014, he coached at the Dr Pepper StarCenter in Frisco, Texas.

In 2018, Eldredge relocated to Irvine, California, and he now coaches at Great Park Ice. His students have included Emmi Peltonen and Yaroslav Paniot.

== Personal life ==
Eldredge was born in Chatham, Massachusetts. He married Megan McCrea on September 3, 2005, in St. Petersburg, Florida. In 2008, he moved to Florida. In March 2009, Todd said he was divorced. Eldredge married Sabrina Corbaci on September 28, 2012, in San Diego, California. Corbaci is a graphic designer and two-time (1991, 1992) U.S. novice pairs medalist with Eddy Zeidler.

<text>Viktor Vasyliovych Petrenko (; born 27 June 1969) is a Ukrainian former competitive figure skater who represented the Soviet Union, the Unified Team, and Ukraine during his career. He is the 1992 Olympic Champion for the Unified Team. Petrenko became the first flagbearer for Ukraine.

Petrenko moved to the United States in 1994 with his family and associates, living first in Simbury, Connecticut, the site of an international skating center. He works as an International Skating Union (ISU) Technical Specialist, tours professionally, and coaches figure skating.

== Early life ==
Viktor Petrenko was born in Odesa, Ukrainian SSR, the first of two sons born to engineers Tamara and Vasyl Petrenko. They both got involved in ice skating, training and competing from a young age. His younger brother Vladimir Petrenko also became a competitive skater and the 1986 World Junior champion.

The Petrenko family spoke Russian, which had become dominant in Odesa. It was also a means of inter-ethnic communication throughout the USSR. Viktor Petrenko attended a Russian-speaking school where he chose to study English as a foreign language. Because Ukrainian was not used in his family or his school, he never learned to speak the native language of his country fluently.

Petrenko was often sick as a young child, and doctors suggested to his parents that they put him in a sport in order to improve his strength and stamina. When he was five years old, they took him to the local ice rink and started him in figure skating. At the age of nine, his talent was noticed by Ukrainian figure skating coach Galina Zmievskaya and she took him on as a pupil at Spartak in Odesa.

== Career ==
=== Rising star 1984-1988 ===
Representing the Soviet Union, Petrenko was the 1984 World Junior Champion. He won the bronze medal at the 1988 Olympic Games, and became one of the youngest male figure skating Olympic medalists.

He also won the bronze medal at the 1988 World Figure Skating Championships. His podium finish came as a surprise, because three former World Champions Brian Orser, Brian Boitano, and Alexander Fadeev were competing in this event. Capitalizing on disastrous short and long programs by Fadeev, Petrenko skated well enough at the championships to earn the bronze.

=== Disappointment 1989 ===

Expected to succeed to the position of top skater with the retirement of the Brians, Petrenko lost the Soviet Nationals to a resurgent Fadeev. At Worlds, a fall in the short program combined with a subpar long program cost him a medal. Upstart and eventual career rival Kurt Browning won a surprising victory at this event.

=== Road to Albertville 1990-1991 ===

Petrenko won his first two European Championships in 1990 and 1991. He was frustrated in trying to win a World title. He won the short program at both the 1990 and 1991 World Figure Skating Championships, but his mistakes in the long program dropped him to silver both times.

The 1991 decision was particularly close. Petrenko skated a strong program, only stepping out of a triple loop, and omitting a planned triple axel-triple toe which he turned into a triple-double. He lost in a controversial 6-3 split by the judges. Browning completed 3 triple-triples, and edged Petrenko out of the gold because of the superior technical difficulty of his program.

=== Olympic and World Champion 1992 ===

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, athletes from former Soviet states went to the Olympics together for the last time in 1992 on a Unified Team. Petrenko competed for this Unified Team. With a free skate that was ranked above American Paul Wylie&#x27;s by seven of the nine judges, he won the gold medal. It was the first ever for a singles skater from the former Soviet Union. His skate was not his best, and some contested his win. His triple axel-triple toe in both programs gained him scores over both Wylie and European Champion Petr Barna, in spite of the mistakes.

A month later Petrenko went to the 1992 World Championships and won the gold medal there, as well, earning two 6.0&#x27;s for presentation in his free program and receiving first-place ranking from all nine judges. In doing so he finally defeated his arch nemesis Kurt Browning, who took silver (after placing a disappointing 6th in Albertville). Petrenko used the same free program for the 3rd straight year, with his polish and familiarity gaining high marks for the artistic strength of the program.

=== Professional career and reinstatement ===

Petrenko turned professional following his Olympic win, moving to Las Vegas, Nevada. Ukraine was still struggling economically and he thought he had more opportunity in the US. When the International Skating Union ruled in 1993 that professionals could return to competitive status, Petrenko returned to Odesa, Ukraine and began training for another Olympics.

He defeated another returning competitor, Brian Boitano, to win Skate America with a commanding 8-triple long program. He won his third European Championships in January 1994, competing for the first time for the independent nation of Ukraine. He represented his homeland at the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics. It was widely expected that he, 1988 Olympic gold medalist Brian Boitano and World Champion Kurt Browning would be the main challengers for medals. After the short program, Petrenko was in ninth place after stepping out of his triple axel and not completing the rotation on his triple lutz, and Boitano and Browning were in eighth and twelfth, respectively. His strong performance in the free skate pulled him up to a fourth-place finish, and might well have been enough to defend his title had he delivered a clean short program.

==Later life ==
After 1994, Petrenko competed as a professional. He had many successes, including winning the prestigious Challenge of Champions event three times. It is considered the top professional event. He failed to win the other major professional event, the Landover World Professional Skating Championships, and never placed higher than 3rd.

In 1992, Petrenko had convinced his coach Galina Zmievskaya to take in Oksana Baiul, a 14-year-old Ukrainian orphan who was talented in skating. The coach became both her guardian and coach, having Baiul live with her. Petrenko covered Baiul&#x27;s expenses. With their guidance, Baiul won the 1993 World Figure Skating Championship and the gold medal at the 1994 Olympic Games.

That year Petrenko married Zmievskaya&#x27;s oldest daughter, Nina Milken, on 19 June 1992. Their daughter Victoria was born on 21 July 1997.

After the 1994 Winter Olympics, Petrenko and Nina, Zmievskaya, Baiul and Viktor&#x27;s brother Vladimir all left Ukraine and moved to Simsbury, Connecticut, United States. Petrenko and Baiul were invited to train for competition. Zmievskaya and Vladimir Petrenko joined the coaching staff at the new International Skating Center of Connecticut.

In 1996, Petrenko performed as the Scarecrow for the CBS television special &quot;The Wizard of Oz on Ice&quot;. 
In March 2001, Petrenko organized the &quot;Viktory for Kids&quot; ice show in Simsbury, Connecticut. He invited celebrity friends from the international figure skating community to perform in order to raise public awareness and funds for the thousands of children still being affected by elevated radiation levels from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster that had occurred in his Ukrainian homeland fifteen years earlier. $108,000 was raised, and later that year was used to open &quot;The Viktor Petrenko Neonatal Intensive Care Unit&quot; in Odesa, with state-of-the-art medical technology.

In October 2003, Petrenko organized a second &quot;Viktory for Kids&quot; show, this time in Danbury, Connecticut. In addition to Petrenko, the show included Olympic champions Ekaterina Gordeeva (with her daughter, Daria Grinkova [Petrenko&#x27;s goddaughter]), Ilia Kulik, Evgeni Plushenko, Brian Boitano, and Oksana Kazakova / Artur Dimitriev.

In January 2004, Petrenko was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI) after crashing his car into a utility pole in Connecticut and refusing to take a breathalyzer test. His record was cleared after he completed an adult alcohol education program.

Petrenko, wife Nina and mother-in-law Zmievskaya left the International Skating Center of Connecticut in 2005 and moved to New Jersey, where they began coaching together at the Ice Vault Arena in Wayne. They have coached American men&#x27;s figure skater Johnny Weir since the summer of 2007.

Petrenko toured as a performing skater with the US company of Champions on Ice for a record twenty seasons, until COI went out of business after the 2007 season. He is an ISU Technical Specialist for Ukraine and was the Assistant Technical Specialist for the men&#x27;s event at the 2006 Winter Olympics. In June 2008, he was elected to the Presidium of the Ukrainian Figure Skating Federation.

In 2022, amidst Russia&#x27;s ongoing full scale invasion of Ukraine, Petrenko was fired from his post as vice president of the Ukrainian Figure Skating Federation (UFFK) and expelled from the organization for taking part in an event in Russia that was organized by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov&#x27;s wife, Tatyana Navka.

<text>Amerika Samoa Bank (ASB) was a financial institution established in 1979 in American Samoa and the second-largest bank in the territory with a 44 percent market share. At one point, it had one overseas branch in Honolulu that it opened in 1997 to serve Samoans in Hawaii.

In 1999, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) acquired ASB and renamed it ANZ Amerika Samoa Bank (ANZ ASB). The process was completed by 2001. ANZ ASB had two branches in Samoa and 10 ATMs. In 2007 the bank acquired Citizens Security Bank for $25 million. In 2010, it launched an internet banking service.

On 31 March 2022 ANZ announced it would exit US community banking in Samoa. This resulted in the closure of all bank accounts in October 2022 and loans were transferred to MWW Financial Services LLC. Before closure, the Governor of American Samoa criticised the bank for failing to make loans or invest in the community for a &quot;very long time&quot;.

<doc id="1346296" wikidata="Q1018014" url="?curid=1346296" title="Buton">
<text>Buton (also Butung, Boeton or Button) is an island in Indonesia located off the southeast peninsula of Sulawesi. It covers roughly 4,727 square kilometers in area, or about the size of Madura; it is the 129th largest island in the world and Indonesia&#x27;s 19th largest in area.

==History==

In the precolonial era, the island, then usually known as Butung, was within the sphere of influence of Ternate. Especially in the sixteenth century, Buton served as an important secondary regional center within the Ternaten empire, controlling regional trade and collecting tribute to be sent to Ternate.

The Sultanate of Buton ruled over the island from the 14th until the 20th century.

Sultan Murhum, the first Islamic monarch on the island, is remembered in the name of the island&#x27;s major harbor, Murhum Harbor, in Baubau.

==Geography==
Its largest town is Baubau, where the Wolio and Cia-Cia languages are spoken. Major nearby islands include Wawonii (to the north), Muna and Kabaena (to the west) and Siumpu (to the southwest). The Tukangbesi Islands lie just to the east where Tukang Besi is spoken, and is separated by the Gulf of Kolowana Watabo (&quot;Teluk Kolowana Watabo&quot;).

Batuatas Island is to the south. Also the &quot;Bouton Passage&quot; (as it was known in the pre-Independence era) was an important inter-island navigational location of the northern Flores Sea.

==Ecology==
The island is largely covered by rainforest and is known for its wildlife. It is one of only two habitats of the anoa, a type of buffalo.

== People ==

The languages spoken on Buton include Wolio, Cia-Cia, various dialects of Muna, Tukang Besi, Kumbewaha, Lasalimu, Kamaru, Pancana, Busoa, Taloki, Kulisusu and Kioko. The Indonesian language, the national language of Indonesia, is also widely used and taught in schools.

In 2009, the Cia-Cia tribe in Baubau city began to use the Korean Hangul alphabet for their language, based on textbooks created by the Hunminjeongeum Society, a linguistic society in Seoul., but in 2012 it was reported that adoption ultimately failed and has been abandoned.

==Economy==
The island has a massive reserve of natural asphalt and several other minerals. Asphalt from Buton can be utilized as bitumen modifiers as well as a substitute for petroleum asphalt. As a result, natural asphalt can be used to reduce dependency on conventional fossil based resources.

==Administration==
Buton Island is administratively divided into five second level administrative divisions (&quot;Daerah Tingkat II&quot;): Baubau City, Buton Regency, (part of) South Buton Regency (which includes several smaller islands to the west and south of Buton), North Buton Regency and (part of) Muna Regency.

However, the eponymous archipelago is administered under an additional four regencies: the rest of Muna Regency and South Buton Regency, together with West Muna Regency, Wakatobi Regency, Central Buton Regency (which does not include any portion of Buton Island), and (part of) Bombana Regency.

<doc id="1346312" wikidata="Q5910887" url="?curid=1346312" title="Hot water reset">
<text>Hot water reset, also called outdoor reset (ODR), is an energy-saving automatic control algorithm for heating boilers that are typically fired with fuel oil or natural gas. A hot water reset control loop measures the outside air temperature; this information is used to estimate demand or heating load as the outdoor temperature varies. The supply hot water temperature is modulated up and down range in an inverse linear ratio to outside air temperature. The typical range for conventional boilers is to vary the supply water temperature from as the outside temperature varies from .

Buildings cool down slowly when the outdoor temperature is moderate, and cool more rapidly when the outdoor temperature is colder. Hot water reset reduces the energy output by the heating system to approximately balance it against the energy lost as the building cools. This makes it easier to maintain the temperature within the desired range (as the radiant heating systems that boilers usually power respond slowly and are subject to overshoot) and can allow boilers to operate more efficiently.

==Implementation==
The control system can be made to modulate the supply water temperature in two different ways:
#By acting as an operating control on the boiler burners, either modulated on/off, high/low fire, or fully modulating fire, depending on the burner construction. When modulating the actual boiler temperature lower, water temperature needs to have a low limit and be maintained above the flue gas condensation temperature for non-condensing boilers, typically above . Condensing boilers can be made to operate at temperatures below the flue gas condensation limit, typically below and raise stated efficiencies from 70-80% to around 90-95%.
#By acting as an operating control on a three-way powered mixing valve or proportional injection pump system that modulates the supply distribution hot water temperature. The mixing valve or mixing pump system recirculates the return water temperature and adds proportionally supply hot water from the boiler for tempering to achieve the desired supply water temperature. Another method is to adjust boiler temperature from thermostat activity. This is indoor reset control. It is more responsive to real needs inside the building.</text><links>

<text>Brazil has a high level of urbanization with 87.8% of the population residing in urban and metropolitan areas. The criteria used by the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) in determining whether households are urban or rural, however, are based on political divisions, not on the developed environment.

Nowadays, the country has 5,571 cities, with 5,569 municipalities plus the capital (Brasília) and the Island of Fernando de Noronha.

With two exceptions, the state capitals are all the largest cities in their respective states: Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina is its second-largest city after Joinville, while Vitória is only the fourth-largest city in Espírito Santo, although it is located in that state&#x27;s largest metropolitan area.

==Most populous cities in Brazil==
This is a list of the most populous cities based on the population of the municipality where the city is located, rather than its metropolitan area. As IBGE considers the entire Federal District synonymous to Brasília, the population of the Federal District is shown for Brasília.

<text>Santa Inés Island () is an island in southern Chile, part of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago and of Punta Arenas municipality, lying south west of the Brunswick Peninsula, from which is separated by the Strait of Magellan and minor islands. It is the largest island of Punta Arenas municipality and the third largest of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago, after Isla Grande and Hoste Island. Its shoreline in this area is part of the Francisco Coloane Marine and Coastal Protected Area. The rest of the island is a part of the Alacalufes National Reserve, equalling that Desolación Island and the &quot;Córdova Peninsula&quot;. This latter is located in front of the island on the other side of the Strait of Magellan and is a peninsula of Riesco Island. The island belongs to the Tierra del Fuego archipelago.

The island hosts a small ice field named Grandes Ventisqueros. It has a deeply indented coastline with several fjords, one of which hid the German light cruiser Dresden following the battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914.

First explorer of Santa Inés Island inland was the French writer and mountaineer Marc Augier in 1951, as he related in his work &quot;Monts Pacifique&quot;.

<text>Edwin Lester Linden Arnold (14 May 1857 – 1 March 1935) was an English writer. His best-known work is &quot;Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation&quot; which is one of the earliest examples of the planetary romance sub-genre.

==Life and literary career==
Arnold was born in Swanscombe, Kent, as son of Sir Edwin Arnold. Most of his childhood was spent in India, but he returned to England to study agriculture and ornithology. He became a journalist in 1883, and published his first books &quot;A Holiday in Scandinavia&quot; (1877) and &quot;Bird Life in England&quot; (1887) before writing his first novel &quot;The Wonderful Adventures of Phra the Phoenician&quot;, the adventures of a warrior who goes in and out of an unexplained state of suspended animation in order to be a witness to invasions or attempted invasions of England. &quot;Phra&quot; was first published in 24 parts in the prestigious &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, and later published in book form in the United States and the United Kingdom.

He wrote several pieces of shorter fiction, including the novelettes &quot;The Story of Ulla&quot;, which was published in &quot;Short Stories&quot; magazine in March 1892, and &quot;Rutherford the Twice-Born&quot;, which was published in the &quot;Idler&quot; magazine in May of the same year. These and eight other stories were collected in &quot;The Story of Ulla and Other Tales&quot; in 1895.

Arnold later wrote two other novels. The first was &quot;Lepidus the Centurion: A Roman of Today&quot; (1901), which flopped commercially. In 1905 Arnold published his best known novel, &quot;Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation&quot;, also known as &quot;Gulliver of Mars&quot;, (1905). Its initial reception was lukewarm, and he published only a few short stories in later years. However, it was later seen as an important precursor of the planetary romance sub-genre.

==Legacy==
Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation&quot; is considered important to 20th century science fiction literature, in that it may have inspired the Edgar Rice Burroughs &quot;Barsoom&quot; series, which was written six years later. Indeed, both Gullivar and Burroughs&#x27;s character John Carter, first seen in &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; (1917), are military men from the Southern United States who arrive on Mars and have numerous adventures, including falling in love with a Martian princess. 

Ace Books reprinted Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation&quot; in 1964, retitling it &quot;Gulliver of Mars&quot; . A more recent Bison Books edition was issued as &quot;Gullivar of Mars&quot;, adapting the Ace title to Arnold&#x27;s spelling.

Marvel Comics did a brief comic version of &quot;Gullivar of Mars&quot; during the early 1970s, possibly as a reaction to DC gaining the rights to publish Burroughs&#x27; &quot;John Carter&quot; during this time. With art by Gil Kane, it ran in several issues of &quot;Creatures on the Loose&quot;. Marvel&#x27;s Gullivar was a Viet Nam vet, and the series started in modern times. Though the series used many of Arnold&#x27;s characters and concepts, the series was not a strict adaptation of the original book.

Both Gullivar and John Carter make an appearance at the beginning of volume two in Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; comic book series.

<doc id="1346339" wikidata="Q437312" url="?curid=1346339" title="Yuka Sato">
<text>is a Japanese former competitive figure skater and choreographer. She is the 1994 World champion, the 1990 World Junior champion and the 1993 &amp; 1994 Japanese national champion. She placed 7th at the 1992 Winter Olympics and 5th at the 1994 Winter Olympics. 
==Personal life==
Yuka Sato was born in Tokyo to figure skating parents. Her father, Nobuo Sato, competed at the 1960 Winter Olympics and 1964 Winter Olympics while her mother, Kumiko Okawa, competed in the 1964 Winter Olympics and 1968 Winter Olympics. Her parents, as of 2011, live near Yokohama.

Sato is a graduate of Hosei University. She was married to fellow figure skater Jason Dungjen.

==Career==

===Eligible career===
In the 1988–89 season, Yuka Sato won the Japanese junior title to qualify for the 1989 World Junior Championships, where she placed 10th. She also qualified for Japan&#x27;s senior championships, where she won the bronze medal behind Midori Ito and Junko Yaginuma. Sato was taught by her parents in Japan until she was 16. Around 1989, she moved to Canada and joined Peter Dunfield, who coached her for the next five years.

In the 1989–90 season, Sato was the Japanese junior champion for the second year in a row and the silver medalist on the senior level. She assigned to the World Junior Championships, where she won gold, and to the 1990 World Championships, where she placed 14th.

In the 1990–91 season, Sato placed fifth at the 1990 NHK Trophy and at the 1990 Nations Cup.

In the 1991–92 season, Sato won the bronze medal at the 1992 Skate America and her second silver medal at the Japanese Championships. She was sent to the 1992 Winter Olympics, where she placed seventh, and the 1992 World Championships, where she finished eighth.

In the 1992–93 season, Sato defeated Nancy Kerrigan and Chen Lu to win the 1992 Skate America. She won the silver medal at the 1992 NHK Trophy, gold at the Prague Skate, and gold at the Japanese Championships. She placed fourth at the 1993 World Championships.

In the 1993–94 season, Sato won the bronze medal at the 1993 NHK Trophy and placed sixth at the pre-Olympic Piruetten competition in Norway. She won her second Japanese national title that season to qualify for the 1994 Winter Olympics and the 1994 World Championships. At the Olympics, she popped an intended triple Lutz in the short program and placed seventh in that segment of the competition. She completed six triple jumps in the free skate and finished fifth overall.

All of the Olympic medalists withdrew from the 1994 World Championships, which were held in Japan. She placed first after the technical program, with Surya Bonaly and Josee Chouinard in second and third, respectively. In the free skate, she was beaten by Bonaly 8–1 in the technical mark but won the presentation mark 8–1, and became the World champion by a 5–4 vote between the judges.

===Later career===
Following her win at the 1994 World Championships, Sato retired from amateur skating and began performing professionally in ice shows, including Stars on Ice. She won the 1995, 2000, 2001 and 2002 World Professional Championships and placed second at that competition in 1996 and 1998. Sato also performed as a pair skater with Jason Dungjen. She is credited as a stunt performer in the 2007 figure skating comedy motion picture &quot;Blades of Glory.&quot;

Sato has worked as a sports commentator for Japanese television. She commentated for NHK during the 2006 Winter Olympics, including the broadcast of Shizuka Arakawa&#x27;s winning performance.

<doc id="1346366" wikidata="Q8053516" url="?curid=1346366" title="Yick Wo v. Hopkins">
<text>Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that a &quot;prima facie&quot; race-neutral law administered in a prejudicial manner infringed upon the right to equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

==Background==

Yick Wo () was a laundry facility owned by Lee Yick, an immigrant from China who moved to San Francisco in 1861. Yick ran the laundry for 22 years and held a license from the Board of Fire Wardens and a certificate of inspection from the city health officer without issue. In 1880, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance making it illegal to operate a laundry in a wooden building without a permit from the Board. Under the new ordinance, Yick was granted a license in 1884 to operate his laundry facility in the wooden building where he was located.

Yick&#x27;s application for renewal of his permit in June 1885 was denied, not allowing him to continue operating his laundry in a wooden building. When his original permit expired in October 1885 he was required by law to shut down. However, he refused to close down his business and was convicted for violating the ordinance. He was fined ten dollars and imprisoned for refusing to pay the fine. After he was imprisoned, on August 24, 1885, he petitioned the California Supreme Court for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;.

Of 320 laundries operated in wooden buildings, in San Francisco at the time, over 200 were owned by Chinese. When the 200 Chinese owned laundry owners tried to renew their permits, only one permit was granted. Whereas, the non-Chinese applicants with the exception of one, all were granted.

==San Francisco ordinance==
Order No. 156, passed May 26, 1880

==Issue==
The central issue of the case was whether the enforcement of the new requirements for laundries operated in wooden buildings violated Yick Wo&#x27;s protections found in the United States Constitution. The Equal Protection Clause can be found in the 14th amendment of the United States Constitution. It requires that &quot;no state...deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot; There is also the issue around whether a law can be written in a neutral way but enforced discriminately.

==Arguments==
The state argued that the ordinance was strictly one out of concern for safety. Laundries of the day often needed very hot stoves to boil water for laundry, and laundry fires were not unknown and often resulted in the destruction of adjoining buildings as well.

The argument on the side of the petitioner was about the administration of the new ordinance. The counsel strove to show that while Chinese applicants were denied permits to continue running their laundries in wooden buildings, non-Chinese individuals were nearly all granted permits under the same ordinance. The petitioner pointed out that prior to the new ordinance, the inspection and approval of laundries in wooden buildings had been left up to fire wardens. Wo&#x27;s laundry had never failed an inspection for fire safety. Moreover, the application of the prior law focused only on laundries in crowded areas of the city, while the new law was being enforced on isolated wooden buildings as well. The law also ignored other wooden buildings where fires were common—even cooking stoves posed the same risk as those used for laundries.

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Matthews, found that the Chinese laundry owners were protected from discriminatory state action by the equal protection clause even if they were not American citizens:

The Court struck down the ordinance. While the ordinance was not discriminatory against a racial or ethnic group in its text, the discriminatory enforcement and intent to close down Chinese-owned laundries infringed upon their &quot;fundamental rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness&quot; by destroying &quot;their harmless and useful occupation, on which they depend for a livelihood.&quot; The Court said the deprivation of property was arbitrary and unconstitutional because the 14th amendments guarantee of equal protection applies to &quot;all persons within the territorial jurisdiction&quot;, including non-citizens. As Justice Anthony Kennedy has explained, the holding of &quot;Yick Wo&quot; is about purposeful discrimination:

==Legacy==

Even after the &quot;Yick Wo&quot; decision Supreme Court case law continued to apply a Dred Scott-like standard excluding Chinese from the protections of the constitution in immigration cases. The Chinese Exclusion Act, passed in 1882, restricted the entry of Chinese immigrant laborers and subsequent legislation prevented Chinese who left the United States from re-entering. The &quot;Chinese Exclusion Case&quot; upheld the revocation of previously issued certificates of return.

The Court in &quot;Fong Yue&quot; wrote that &quot;Yick Wo&quot; was a case about &quot;the power of a State over aliens continuing to reside within its jurisdiction&quot;. The &quot;Fong Yue Ting&quot; decision did not go as far as overturning &quot;Yick Wo&quot;, but &quot;Yick Wo&quot; did not limit the federal power to deport or remove that were at issue in the later &quot;Chinese Exclusion Case&quot; and &quot;Fong Yue&quot;.

In &quot;Wong Kim Ark v. United States&quot; the Court recognized that the 14th amendment right to &quot;jus soli&quot; citizenship applied for Chinese born in the United States based on &quot;Yick Wo&quot;. The federal government&#x27;s argument was about the text of the 14th amendment: &quot;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, &quot;and subject to the jurisdiction thereof&quot;, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&quot; The government argued that the jurisdiction requirement was not merely territorial, but required citizens be politically subject to the laws of the United States. Writing for the majority Justice Horace Gray relied heavily on the &quot;Yick Wo&quot; precedent to reaffirm the principle that 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection does not have a heightened subjecthood requirement for Chinese people:

&quot;Yick Wo&quot; is cited in &quot;Hirabayashi v. United States&quot; to recognize that: &quot;Distinctions between citizens solely based because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality. For that reason, legislative classification or discrimination based on race alone has often been held to be a denial of equal protection.&quot; However, the US Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Gordon Hirabayashi, the Japanese American who tested the curfew law and refused to register for the forced internment of people of Japanese descent during World War II.

In San Francisco there is a public school named Yick Wo Alternative Elementary School in honor of Yick Wo.

During his confirmation hearing Anthony Kennedy&#x27;s written answers to Senator Joseph Biden included a quote from &quot;Flores v. Pierce&quot;, a 9th Circuit decision he wrote applying &quot;Yick Wo&quot; to uphold a judgment against municipal officials who had a &quot;history of racially motivated activity&quot; against Hispanics:

<text>Alexei Yevgenyevich Urmanov (; born 17 November 1973) is a Russian figure skating coach and former competitor. He is the 1994 Olympic champion, the 1993 World bronze medalist, the 1997 European champion, the 1995–96 Champions Series Final champion, a four-time Russian national champion, and the 1992 Soviet national champion.

== Personal life ==
Urmanov was born on 17 November 1973 in Leningrad, Soviet Union. In 2001, his partner, Viktoria, gave birth to twins, Ivan and Andrei. The couple married in 2004.

== Career ==
Urmanov started skating in 1977. Early in his career, he was coached by N. Monakhova and Natalia Golubeva.

Competing for the Soviet Union, Urmanov won the silver medal at the 1990 World Junior Championships. After the end of the Soviet Union, he chose to compete for Russia. In 1991, at age 17, he landed a quadruple jump at the European Championships.

Urmanov competed at the 1992 Winter Olympics, where he placed 5th. He won the bronze medal at the 1993 World Championships. At the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, he won the gold medal, becoming one of the youngest male figure skating Olympic champions.

Urmanov chose to remain in the competitive ranks. He became the 1997 European champion, but an injury forced him out of the 1997 World Championships after the short program and kept him from competing for a berth to the 1998 Olympics. He retired from Olympic-eligible skating in 1999 and won the World Professional Championships the same year. Urmanov was coached by Alexei Mishin at the Yubileyny Sports Palace in Saint Petersburg. During the 1990s, the rink often had poor-quality ice and other problems, resulting in limited training time.

== Coaching career ==

Urmanov is an Honoured Masters of Sports of the Russian Federation. He works as a skating coach and an International Skating Union technical specialist. He was based in Saint Petersburg until 2014, when he moved to Sochi, to coach at the Iceberg Skating Palace. He sometimes holds summer camps or clinics in other locations such as Luleå, Sweden, and Paris, France.

His current and former students include: 
* Sergei Voronov
* Nodari Maisuradze
* Zhan Bush
* Gordei Gorshkov
* Nikol Gosviani

<text>Deadweight tonnage (also known as deadweight; abbreviated to DWT, D.W.T., d.w.t., or dwt) or tons deadweight (DWT) is a measure of how much weight a ship can carry. It is the sum of the weights of cargo, fuel, fresh water, ballast water, provisions, passengers, and crew.

DWT is often used to specify a ship&#x27;s maximum permissible deadweight (i.e. when it is fully loaded so that its Plimsoll line is at water level), although it may also denote the actual DWT of a ship not loaded to capacity.

==Definition==
Deadweight tonnage is a measure of a vessel&#x27;s weight carrying capacity, not including the empty weight of the ship. It is distinct from the displacement (weight of water displaced), which includes the ship&#x27;s own weight, or the volumetric measures of gross tonnage or net tonnage (and the legacy measures gross register tonnage and net register tonnage).

Deadweight tonnage was historically expressed in long tons, but is now usually given internationally in tonnes (metric tons). In modern international shipping conventions such as the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships, deadweight is explicitly defined as the difference in tonnes between the displacement of a ship in water of a specific gravity of 1.025 (corresponding to average density of sea water of ) at the draft corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard and the light displacement (lightweight) of the ship.

<doc id="1346398" wikidata="Q268172" url="?curid=1346398" title="Trixi Schuba">
<text>Beatrix &quot;Trixi&quot; Schuba (born 15 April 1951) is an Austrian former competitive figure skater who competed in ladies&#x27; singles. She is a six-time Austrian national champion (1967–1972), a two-time European champion (1971 and 1972), a two-time World champion (1971 and 1972), and 1972 Olympic champion.

She is considered to be one of the best compulsory figure skaters ever.

== Early life ==
Schuba was born in Vienna. After her father died when she was thirteen, she went to trade school and eventually took over the bookkeeping of her family&#x27;s lumber business in Vienna; mornings were given to skating and afternoons to work.

==Competitive career==
Schuba&#x27;s interest in figure skating began as a young child in 1955 when she happened to see an American competition on the television bought by her parents to watch performances of the Vienna State Opera and the Burgtheater. She was coached by Helmut Seibt from 1955 to 1962, and then by Leopold Linhart.

Her first major success was winning the ladies&#x27; singles portion of the Austrian Championships at the age of sixteen in 1967; she would go on to defend her title five straight times. Schuba steadily improved throughout the end of the 1960s and the early 1970s, placing in the top five several times and eventually taking first twice each at the European Championships and the World Championships in 1971 and 1972.

Schuba&#x27;s greatest success came in 1972 at the Winter Olympics at Sapporo when she won the gold medal. She is the first Austrian lady since Herma Szabo in 1924 to win gold and is the most recent. Schuba, the dominant compulsory figures skater, placed first in the figures and Janet Lynn of the United States, the top free skater, placed first after the free skate. As the scoring system used at the time placed more weight on figures, Schuba won the gold medal and Lynn won the bronze behind silver medalist Karen Magnussen of Canada.

The International Skating Union, the governing body of the sport, would over the ensuing years decrease the weight given the figures portion before finally eliminating it in 1990.

After winning gold at Sapporo, Schuba did the same the next month at the World Championships, successfully defending against silver medalist Magnussen and bronze medalist Lynn. At the end of the year, sportswriters named her Athlete of the Year for 1972.

== Later career ==
Retiring from amateur skating, Schuba appeared over the succeeding six years in the professional shows Ice Follies and Holiday on Ice, after which she began a career in the insurance industry which she continues to the present.

In addition to her career in insurance, Schuba is involved in various sports organizations in Austria. She is a former president of the Austrian Ice Skating Association, the first woman to hold that position, and she sat on the board of the Austrian Olympic Committee from 2004 to 2009. Schuba has served as president of the International Panathlon Club Wien since 2007, on the board of the Austrian Paralympic Committee since 2009, and as vice president of the Graz Skating Association since 2010.

<text>Odds &amp; Sods is an album of studio outtakes by British rock band the Who. It was released by Track Records in the UK on September 28, 1974, and by Track/MCA in the US on October 12, 1974. Ten of the recordings on the original eleven-song album were previously unreleased. The album reached No. 10 on the UK charts and No. 15 in the US.

The recordings were compiled by Who bassist John Entwistle. Two LPs of songs were considered in 1974, but only one LP was released at the time. &quot;It could have been a double album, there was that much material,&quot; Entwistle said. It was one of the first examples of artists compiling such unreleased recordings. The Who, as well as many other artists, later released similar albums, such as &quot;Who&#x27;s Missing&quot;.

==Background==
In the autumn of 1973, while Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend and Keith Moon were preparing for the &quot;Tommy&quot; film, Entwistle was put in charge of completing an album to counter the rampant bootlegging that arose from the Who&#x27;s concerts. &quot;If John Entwistle had never seen &quot;Who&#x27;s Zoo&quot;&quot;, observed that bootleg&#x27;s cover artist William Stout, &quot;we might not have had the legitimate Who release of &quot;Odds &amp; Sods&quot;&quot;.

&quot;I tried to arrange it like a parallel sort of Who career – what singles we might have released and what album tracks we might have released,&quot; Entwistle explained. He and the producer of his solo albums, John Alcock, compiled &quot;Odds &amp; Sods&quot; from various unreleased Who tapes. 

Townshend wrote liner notes in 1974 that included frank opinions of the quality of the songs. The notes were omitted from some copies of the original LP but included on the 1998 remastered CD. The latter featured material from the unreleased second LP.

==Songs==
&quot;Postcard&quot;, the only song on the original album written by Entwistle, was also released as a single. This track had new overdubs and a remix for the 1974 release. This track as well as &quot;Now I&#x27;m a Farmer&quot; and &quot;Naked Eye&quot; had been planned for an EP release in 1970, which was cancelled. 

&quot;Put the Money Down&quot;, &quot;Too Much of Anything&quot; and &quot;Pure and Easy&quot; were from the aborted &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project which the band worked on during 1971 and 1972.

&quot;Little Billy&quot; was written in 1968 by Townshend for the American Cancer Society, but it never saw the light of day because it never left the office of the executive Townshend submitted it to. &quot;Glow Girl&quot; and &quot;Faith in Something Bigger&quot; were also recorded in 1968 for an unfinished studio album. 

&quot;I&#x27;m the Face&quot; (which is a reworking of the Slim Harpo classic &quot;Got Love If You Want It&quot;) was The Who&#x27;s first record, when they were still performing as the High Numbers. It was recorded and first released in 1964. Only a few hundred copies of the original single were pressed. The song was remixed in stereo for the 1974 album. 

&quot;Long Live Rock&quot; comes from a 1972 Who recording session. This track was later featured in the Who film &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;, and released as a single in 1979. 

===Additional material===
The mix of &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; on the 1998 remastered CD is a special stereo remix produced but not used for the &quot;Thirty Years of Maximum R&amp;B&quot; box set that omits the original fuzzbox guitar part.

The studio version of &quot;Young Man Blues&quot; on the re-issue is not the sampler version of &quot;The House that Track Built&quot;, but a slower out-take (seemingly due to the tape playing at the wrong speed) from the same sessions as the Sampler Version, which was finally released in an alternate mix on the 2013 deluxe version of &quot;Tommy&quot;. The iTunes American Store lists this version of &quot;Young Man Blues&quot; as an &quot;Alternate Studio Version&quot; and at the end Kit Lambert is heard to remark: &quot;No, that one didn&#x27;t really work&quot;.

The 2011 reissue featuring the original analog mixes has some different takes than the 1998 version. For example, &quot;Young Man Blues&quot; is a different take than the 1998 remix.

==Release history==
On 29 August 2020, the album was re-released as a limited edition coloured double vinyl LP. The first disc consists of the 1974 release. The second consists of various tracks, many of which were included in the expanded 1998 CD reissue, some of which were included on other releases, and others available for the first time on the 2020 release.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Pete Townshend except where noted.

=== Original album ===


=== 1998 remaster ===
=== CD Reissue 2011 (SHM-CD) ===
In December 2011, Universal Japan issued the original analogue mix for the album on CD with the songs reflecting the order of the original vinyl. The bonus tracks that were issued previously on the 1998 CD remix reissue were added after the original running order of the album. These bonus tracks used the original analogue mixes where possible rather than the remixes prepared for the 1998 expanded CD reissue. The reissue was remastered by Jon Astley.

<doc id="1346405" wikidata="Q470054" url="?curid=1346405" title="Karen Magnussen">
<text>Karen Diane Magnussen, OC (born April 4, 1952) is a Canadian former competitive figure skater. She is the 1972 Olympic silver medallist and 1973 World champion. She was Canada&#x27;s Female Athlete of the Year in 1971 and 1972, and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1973.

== Personal life ==
Magnussen was born into a middle-class family with a Swedish mother and Norwegian father in Vancouver, British Columbia. She has two sisters, Lori, three years younger, and Judy, six years younger.

Magnussen studied kinesiology at Simon Fraser University. In 1978, she married Tony Cella, the lead singer of a band. They lived in his hometown, Boston, for eleven years and then moved to Vancouver. They have two sons and a daughter.

==Competitive career==
After being introduced to the ice at age six and a half when her mother, a recreational skater, brought her to a general skating session, Karen Magnussen then kept asking for more opportunities to skate. Recalling lessons on pebbly curling ice at the Kerrisdale Arena, she commented, &quot;The ice was anything but perfect, but I think that made you tough.&quot; Her first coach was Hellmut May. Linda Brauckmann became her coach in 1965.

Magnussen&#x27;s career at the elite level of skating began when she won the Canadian national junior title in 1965. Moving up to the senior level the next year, she became known for her strong free skating ability, and was even compared to then-reigning world champion Petra Burka. Her march upwards in the rankings continued as she qualified to compete at the World Championships for the first time in 1967 and won her first Canadian title in 1968. She was sent to the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France, and placed seventh.

In 1969, Magnussen lost her Canadian title to Linda Carbonetto. She was diagnosed with stress fractures in both legs in February 1969, spent three months in a wheelchair, and returned to the ice in mid-May. Though she watched the 1969 World Championships from a wheelchair, she said, &quot;I was planning for next year&#x27;s competition. I never considered giving up; I always knew that I&#x27;d be back.&quot; She won the Canadian Championships four more times, from 1970 to 1973. At the World Championships, she won a bronze medal in 1971 and then silver in 1972.

Magnussen was granted free early morning ice time at Vancouver&#x27;s Pacific Coliseum before the hockey players arrived.

Like her American contemporary Janet Lynn, Magnussen was stronger in free skating than compulsory figures. In the early 1970s, both were competing against the Austrian skater Trixi Schuba, who excelled at figures and often built a huge early lead under a scoring system which heavily valued those skills. Schuba&#x27;s strength in figures allowed her to win the gold at the 1972 Winter Olympics despite placing seventh in the free skating segment, while Lynn and Magnussen (first and second in the free skating) took bronze and silver, respectively. Since most audiences found compulsory figures unexciting, the International Skating Union reduced their value and introduced the short program in the 1972–73 season. Combined with Schuba&#x27;s retirement after the Olympic season, this development encouraged both Magnussen and Lynn to stay in competition another year. At the first World Championships under this system, in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia in 1973, Magnussen produced a strong short program (which included a double Axel), while Lynn fell twice in that portion of the competition. Although Lynn came back to win the free skating segment, her problems in the short cost her the title. Canadian sports broadcaster Johnny Esaw, concerned that the satellite feed would end before Magnussen&#x27;s free skate, paid the Zamboni driver to work faster. In the final year in which solid gold medals were awarded in figure skating, Magnussen added a gold to complete her World medal collection.

== Later life ==
Magnussen retired from competition and turned professional, saying in October 1973, &quot;I&#x27;m glad my folks don&#x27;t have to worry now about paying my bills. They gave up so much for my lessons, and they never said one thing about it, for which I love them so much. I can help them out now, and help my two younger sisters.&quot; She performed with Ice Capades for four years.

Magnussen coached for eleven years in Boston before returning to the North Shore Winter Club in North Vancouver, British Columbia. In addition to teaching figure skaters, she has also worked with hockey players to improve edges, power, balance, and stops and starts.

Despite the elimination of figures by the ISU, Magnussen considers it beneficial to learn them in some form, saying in 2009, &quot;Instead of doing figures on a patch of ice we do it in a more free form, but we still have to get skaters back to basics.&quot; The &quot;Karen Magnussen Community Recreation Centre&quot; in North Vancouver is named after her. To assist young skaters, Magnussen established the &quot;Karen Magnussen Foundation&quot;. Magnussen was the last Canadian woman to win the World title until Kaetlyn Osmond in 2018, 45 years later.

On November 28, 2011, an ammonia leak occurred at the North Shore Winter Club where Magnussen was working; she said it caused her breathing problems, hampered her ability to speak, impaired her vision, and left her chronically fatigued. Following the incident and treatment with the powerful steroid prednisone, she gained 60 pounds and developed rheumatoid arthritis, temporal arteritis (swelling of blood vessels to the head), and central sensitivity syndrome (affecting the interaction between the brain and vocal cords). WorkSafeBC inspectors cited the club for twelve health and safety violations. Interviewed by the CBC in December 2013, Magnussen said compensation benefits ceased when WorkSafeBC realized her disability was permanent. As of 2015, she continues to suffer serious health problems and may not enter a rink due to the risk from fumes. The Connaught Skating Club decided to organize a benefit show for Magnussen in March 2015.

<doc id="1346406" wikidata="Q367878" url="?curid=1346406" title="Mark Coleman">
<text>Mark Coleman (born December 20, 1964) is an American retired mixed martial artist, professional wrestler and amateur wrestler. Coleman was the UFC 10 and UFC 11 tournament champion, the first UFC Heavyweight Champion, and the Pride Fighting Championships 2000 Open Weight Grand Prix champion. At UFC 82 Coleman was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame.

Coleman is credited with proving the ability of wrestlers to dominate in the developing sport of mixed martial arts, and with being one of the first in American MMA to use the strategy that he coined &quot;ground-and-pound&quot; successfully, earning him the moniker, &quot;The Godfather of Ground &amp; Pound&quot;. In the sport of wrestling, Coleman was a World Championship runner-up and Pan American Games Gold medalist in 1991, won three Pan American Championships, competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics and was an NCAA Division I National Champion for the Ohio State Buckeyes.

==Background==
Coleman was born in Fremont, Ohio in 1964. He began freestyle wrestling as a teenager and in 1981 was the first state champion wrestler for Saint Joseph Central Catholic High School (Fremont, Ohio). He then finished second in his sophomore year before claiming his second state championship in 1983.

He continued to wrestle for Miami University, in Ohio, where he was a two-time Mid-American Conference wrestling champion and earned his first All-American honors in 1986. In his senior year, he transferred to The Ohio State University and won an NCAA championship in 1988. Out of college, he started as an assistant coach at his alma mater. Additionally, he was awarded a spot on the US Wrestling team, placing second (100 kg) at the 1991 FILA Wrestling World Championships in Varna, Bulgaria, and placing seventh overall in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. He participated 1996 Olympic Trials, but self-claimed lack of focus on wrestling hindered his performance, resulting in a loss in the semifinals.

Coleman&#x27;s collegiate wrestling record totaled 101 wins and 12 losses. He had 50 wins and 2 losses in his final season, in which he won the NCAA D1 national title at 189 pounds.

==Mixed martial arts career==
Facing the twilight of his amateur wrestling career, Coleman transitioned to the then-new sport of mixed martial arts after accidentally turning on a TV channel where the UFC 1 was ongoing.

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===
Coleman won his first two tournaments in dominating fashion, including a win over UFC 8 champion Don Frye at UFC 10 in 1996, and becoming the first UFC Heavyweight Champion after submitting UFC Superfight Champion Dan Severn via neck crank submission at UFC 12.

Coleman made his first UFC Heavyweight Championship title defense at UFC 14, facing kickboxer (and heavy underdog) Maurice Smith. In the pre-fight interview with Joe Rogan, Coleman stated &quot;I&#x27;m going to ground him and pound the goddamn shit out of him&quot; thus coining the name &quot;ground-and-pound&quot;. In what turned out to be a long battle, Coleman lost a decision after 21:00 (regulation plus two overtimes). This was considered to be one of the largest upsets in UFC history at that time, largely because of the way Coleman had dominated his opponents in his previous fights.

Coleman took nearly a year off after having to get ACL surgery and returned at UFC 17. Coleman was originally scheduled to face Randy Couture in a title match for the UFC Heavyweight Championship, but Couture was injured during training and was forced to pull out of the fight. Coleman instead faced a relatively unknown (at that time) last-minute replacement fighter, up and coming Lion&#x27;s Den product Pete Williams. In what turned out to be another long and strenuous battle, Coleman appeared to be completely exhausted after 10 minutes; he was fatigued to the point of resting his hands on his knees during the fight. Williams took advantage of Coleman&#x27;s fatigue and landed a heavy kick to the face, knocking &#x27;The Hammer&#x27; out for the first time in his career.

After his loss to Pete Williams, Coleman went to train with former UFC champion Ken Shamrock and his Lion&#x27;s Den training camp for his upcoming bout with feared Brazilian striker Pedro Rizzo at UFC 18. The fight with Rizzo was part of the &quot;Road to the Heavyweight Title&quot;, which was a four-man tournament between Coleman, Rizzo, Bas Rutten and Tsuyoshi Kosaka that would crown the next UFC Heavyweight Champion. After 15:00 the fight went to the judges, and they awarded a split decision win to Rizzo. The decision was controversial, with many and Coleman himself believing he did enough to win. In a recent interview, Coleman said he still feels the effects of the controversial decision loss to Rizzo.

===Pride Fighting Championships===
From 1999 through 2006, The Hammer continued his career with Japanese promotion, Pride Fighting Championships while also making appearances with the professional wrestling promotion HUSTLE.

At Pride 5, Coleman fought Nobuhiko Takada, who would become HUSTLE&#x27;s owner and booker. Though thought to be the much better fighter, Coleman was caught by a heel hook from Takada and submitted. The validity of this fight has been questioned, with many believing the fight was fixed. In response to questions about the fight&#x27;s legitimacy, Coleman said, &quot;It was what it was. I needed to support my family. They guaranteed me another fight after that and I needed that security. It was what it was. I&#x27;m going to leave it at that.&quot;

Coleman won the Pride 2000 Open Weight Grand Prix tournament defeating Masaaki Satake, Akira Shoji, Kazuyuki Fujita, and Igor Vovchanchyn. The final was scheduled to be fought with a 20-minute time limit but according to Coleman, the day before the fight the rules were changed to no time limit. The change forced him to modify his game plan to attempt a quick finish as he did not believe he could put Vovchanchyn away with his ground and pound in a long match. The Hammer&#x27;s training and 2000 tournament victory are depicted in the documentary The Smashing Machine: The Life and Times of Extreme Fighter Mark Kerr.

After a quick TKO victory over Allan Goes at Pride 13 - Collision Course, Coleman faced possibly his toughest challenge ever in Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira at Pride 16. &quot;Minotauro&quot; was able to catch the Hammer in a triangle/armbar at 6:10 of the first round, breaking Coleman&#x27;s six-fight winning streak.

Coleman would take nearly two years off following the fight with Nogueira, spending time with his wife and children, and focusing on developing his martial arts training facility and stable of fighters at Team Hammer House. Training such notable fighters as Kevin Randleman, Wes Sims and Phil Baroni, Team Hammer House quickly gained a reputation of turning out world-class fighters.

Mark Coleman returned to MMA competition at Pride 26 to face Don Frye in a rematch of their meeting at UFC 10; this proved to be a much tougher battle. Coming back from a career-threatening neck injury, Coleman ultimately won a unanimous decision victory after 20 minutes. Following the fight, Coleman apologized to the fans for the lack of action during the fight, in which he had spent the majority of the time taking down and maintaining positional dominance of Frye with his superior wrestling ability.

Between training fighters and spending time with his family, the Hammer was now fighting roughly once a year. He returned to competition to take place in the Pride 2004 Heavyweight Grand Prix, as the returning Grand Prix champion in the Open Weight Division. His first-round match at Pride Total Elimination 2004 was against Pride heavyweight champion Fedor Emelianenko. In what turned out to be a short bout, Coleman was submitted by armbar at 2:11 of the first round, eliminating him from the tournament.

Coleman returned to the Pride ring in February 2005, this time facing Mirko Cro Cop at &quot;Pride 29: Fists of Fire&quot;. Suffering the second knockout of his career, the Hammer fell to strikes by Cro Cop in the first round. In November 2005, Mark Coleman appeared in &quot;Bushido Europe-Rotterdam Rumble&quot;, Europe&#x27;s first Bushido event, and choked out Milco Voorn at 0:56 of the first round.

The Hammer returned to action at Pride 31 with a victory over Chute Boxe team member Maurício &quot;Shogun&quot; Rua after the fight was stopped when Shogun suffered a dislocated elbow during a Coleman takedown. With Team Hammer House member Phil Baroni in his corner, Coleman began the match by taking Shogun to the ground. At 0:49 of the first round, Rua got up and as he took the first step Coleman grabbed his feet. Rua fell and broke his arm. Coleman then started peppering Rua with strikes before the referee stopped the fight.

Backstage in his post-fight interview, Coleman stated that the whole melee happened in the heat of the moment and that he did not blame the Chute Boxe team for coming in and backing their fighter. He then added that similar to Chute Boxe, Hammer House is also like a family, and thanked Baroni for coming in and watching his back. An outraged Chute Boxe refused to accept Coleman&#x27;s backstage apology. The Chute Boxe team was assigned a yellow card for instigating this infraction. Coleman&#x27;s contract was fought out at this point, and he subsequently re-signed with the organization.

On October 21, 2006, Mark Coleman again faced Pride heavyweight champion Fedor Emelianenko at Pride&#x27;s first American show, Pride 32: The Real Deal, and lost via submission (armbar) at 1:17 of round two.

Mark Coleman appeared with teammate, Kevin Randleman, on the US pay-per-view broadcast of the final Pride event, &quot;Pride 34: Kamikaze&quot;, stating that he intended to keep fighting.

===Return to UFC (2008–2010)===
At UFC 82, Mark Coleman was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame, making him the 5th inductee. Coleman announced that he was not retiring and would return to the octagon to fight Brock Lesnar on August 9 in Minneapolis at UFC 87. However, Coleman injured his knee while training, and was forced to pull out of the event. Heath Herring replaced Coleman for the fight.

Coleman faced Maurício Rua in a rematch in their first bout in the UFC at UFC 93 and lost by technical knockout as a result of punches late in the third round. This fight earned him a $40,000 &quot;Fight of the Night&quot; award.

At UFC 109, Coleman faced fellow UFC Hall of Famer Randy Couture, after originally being scheduled to meet at UFC 17 in 1998 twelve years prior, in which an injury forced Couture to drop out of the fight. Coleman went on record, multiple times during the build-up for the fight, in which he claimed this was his dream bout. After being outboxed on the feet, Coleman was taken down and defeated shortly after by (Rear Naked Choke) at 1:09 in round 2. The bout marked the first time two UFC Hall of Fame inductees had fought.

Following Coleman&#x27;s loss to Couture in the main event of UFC 109, his sixth loss in his last 10 fights, he was released by the promotion.

===Retirement from MMA===
After going over three years without competing Coleman announced via Facebook that he has officially retired from MMA competition at 48 years of age.

===UFC 300===
After Coleman saved his parents from a burning house in March 2024, fighter Max Holloway suggested that Coleman be the one to present the symbolic &quot;BMF&quot; (&quot;baddest motherfucker&quot;) belt to the winner of the title fight at UFC 300 on April 13, 2024. This request was granted and Coleman ended up wrapping the belt around Holloway, who was victorious in his bout against Justin Gaethje.

===Fight Circus===
On January 12, 2025, Coleman returned to the ring and competed at Fight Circus 12 in Phuket, Thailand in a &quot;wheelchair boxing match&quot; against the CEO of the promotion Jon Nutt. Both fighters were strapped into a wheelchair and were pushed around the ring by their cornermen with Coleman&#x27;s cornerman being former UFC fighter Matt Brown. At the end of the fight, both men stood up from their wheelchairs and Coleman knocked out Nutt at the last second.

==Professional wrestling career==
===New Japan Pro-Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling (2000–2002)===
In December 2000, Coleman had his first professional wrestling match when he was invited to the event Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye 2000, teaming up with Mark Kerr to defeat Takashi Iizuka and Yuji Nagata. He would also appear for New Japan Pro-Wrestling, defeating Nagata in a singles match. In 2002, Coleman would appear in All Japan Pro Wrestling&#x27;s Wrestle-1 project, teaming up with Kevin Randleman to face Hiroshi Hase and Satoshi Kojima in a losing effort, and later Jan the Giant Convict and Singh the Giant Convict in a victory, with Coleman himself pinning Singh with a hurricanrana.

===Hustle (2004–2007)===
In 2004, Coleman started wrestling for Hustle and its partner promotion Pro Wrestling Zero-One. He debuted in the first as part of Generalissimo Takada&#x27;s villainous faction Monster Army, going against babyface Toshiaki Kawada in a singles match which Mark lost by TKO. Coleman continued teaming up with other Monster Army wrestlers, including Dan Bobish, Commander An Jo and Giant Silva, but he was kicked out of the stable after failing to defeat top face Naoya Ogawa, thus becoming a babyface himself. Coleman then went free and ended up joining Wataru Sakata&#x27;s team after losing a bout to him. Coleman and Sakata were successful as a tag team, but it was dissolved after Coleman left the promotion in 2005.

Two years later, Coleman returned to Hustle under the masked persona &quot;Coleman&quot;, teaming up with the superhero-like team of Randleman, Kintaman and Kurodaman. Their biggest victory was when Coleman and Randleman faced the trio of Giant Vabo, Kohei Sato and Tajiri and won the match despite the numeric disadvantage. Mark&#x27;s last match in Hustle was in July 2007, leaving the promotion again afterwards.

From 2008 to 2010, Coleman was a usual member of Inoki Genome Federation, wrestling names like Naoya Ogawa, Tadao Yasuda and Shinichi Suzukawa.

==Personal life==
Coleman has two daughters, Mackenzie and Morgan, from his previous marriage. Coleman has a third daughter, Skylar, with his current partner Tina.

He appeared in the documentary &quot;The Smashing Machine: The Life and Times of Mark Kerr&quot; alongside fellow fighter and former friend Mark Kerr.

In June 2006, it was announced that Coleman was one of the new coaches in the International Fight League. However his team, the Columbus Razorclaws, were unable to get off the ground, and he was replaced as a coach by Frank Shamrock the following month.

In 2018, Coleman revealed that he was one of the victims of Richard Strauss regarding the Ohio State University abuse scandal.

In late 2020, Coleman reported that he suffered a heart attack due to a complete artery blockage, and underwent a surgery to have a stent installed.

In an interview with Ariel Helwani in September 2021, Coleman revealed that Wes Sims persuaded him to participate in rehab due to a drinking problem. In the interview Coleman stated that multiple personal life issues contributed to the situation and also that he&#x27;s been sober since the rehab.

In March 2024, a house fire began at Coleman&#x27;s parents&#x27; home in Toledo, Ohio. Coleman retrieved his parents, but his dog did not survive the fire. Coleman was hospitalized and put in critical condition due to smoke inhalation.

<text>Coats Island (Inuktitut: ᐊᑉᐸᑑᕐᔪᐊᖅ, Appatuurjuaq) lies at the northern end of Hudson Bay in the Kivalliq Region of Nunavut. At in size, it is the 107th largest island in the world, and Canada&#x27;s 24th largest island.

The island has areas of federal crown land and areas of private land owned by Inuit, however, the last permanent residents left in the 1970s. With no permanent settlements, the island is also the largest uninhabited island in the northern hemisphere fully south of the Arctic Circle. It was the last home of the Sadlermiut people who are widely believed to represent the Dorset culture.

==Geography==
Coats Island is long. It reaches a maximum elevation of above sea level. This high point occurs along the rocky northern perimeter between Cape Pembroke and Cape Prefontaine. The underlying rocks in this area are Precambrian metamorphics. Less than 5 per cent of the island is more than above sea level. The southern half of the island is primarily low-lying muskeg and made up of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, such as limestone and sandstone.

==Fauna==
Since 1920, Coats Island has been designated a caribou reserve. After caribou were extirpated from nearby Southampton Island, the Coats herd was used to re-establish the Southampton herd. It is also known for its population of thick-billed murre. Two colonies of 30,000 birds occur along the cliffs at the rocky northern end. There are also significant concentrations of walrus at walrus haulouts at the base of cliffs or on offshore islands at the northern end of the island (one each at Cape Pembroke and Cape Prefontaine). These are visited regularly by Inuit from the hamlet at Coral Harbour, on Southampton Island, for harvesting.

Cape Pembroke is an Important Bird Area.

==History==
The first recorded sighting of Coats Island by Europeans was in 1612 by Thomas Button; he explored it further the following year. It received its name from William Coats, a sea captain for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. He visited the area periodically between 1727 and 1751.

In 1824, HMS &quot;Griper&quot;, under Captain George Francis Lyon, anchored off Cape Pembroke on Coats Island. The whalers then discovered a band of &quot;Eskimos&quot; who were said to have spoken a &quot;strange dialect&quot; and were called &quot;Sadlermiut&quot;. Since then, the Sadlermiut continued to establish contact with Westerners. However, as with many North American Indigenous peoples, the Sadlermiut were often susceptible to Western diseases.

The area was confirmed to be an island by American whalers, who began visiting the area in the 1860s. By 1896, there were only 70 of Sadlermiut remaining. Then, in the fall of 1902, the British trading and whaling vessel named the &quot;Active&quot; had made a stop at Cape Low, Southampton Island. It is said that some of the Sadlermiut caught a disease, possibly influenza, typhoid or typhus, from a sick sailor aboard the &quot;Active&quot;, which then spread to the entire community. By winter 1902–03, the entire Sadlermiut population had died as a result.

A trading post operated by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was maintained on the island from August 1920 to August 1924, and a number of Inuit families lived on the island during that period, some of whom had been brought from Baffin Island on boats. In 1921, an overturned fisherman&#x27;s dory covering two skeletons was found by Captain George Cleveland on Coats Island which were alleged to be the remains of Captain Arthur Gibbons and one of his officers, survivors of the wreck of the American whaling schooner &quot;A. T. Gifford&quot;. The Canadian Government held a criminal investigation.

<text>Janet Lynn Nowicki (born April 6, 1953) is an American figure skater. She is the 1972 Olympic bronze medalist, a two-time world championships medalist, and a five-time senior Ladies U.S. national champion.

==Amateur career==

Lynn began to skate almost as soon as she could walk, and took part in her first exhibition performance at the age of four at Chicago Stadium. By age seven, she was living away from home part of the year, staying with the slightly older skater Kathleen Kranich to be close to her coach Slavka Kohout, who worked out of Rockton, Illinois, but her close-knit family was never far away. Eventually her family moved from the Chicago suburb of Evergreen Park to Rockford, Illinois, some fifteen miles from Rockton and the rink. Janet attended Lincoln Junior High in Rockford. She used her middle name Lynn instead of Nowicki, which was constantly being misspelled and mispronounced. Janet was always forthright about the name change; in her own mind her name was still Nowicki.

In 1964, at 11, she became the youngest skater to pass the rigorous eighth and final test administered by the United States Figure Skating Association, and two years later she won the U.S. Junior Ladies Championship at Berkeley, California. At that competition she landed a triple salchow jump, which at the time was rarely performed by female skaters. In later years she was also one of the first female skaters to include a triple toe loop in her programs.

Moving up to the senior level, Lynn won bronze at the 1968 U.S. Championships, which qualified her to compete at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France, where she placed 9th. At the time she was 14 years old and it was her first major international competition. She also placed 9th at her first World Championships in 1968.

Lynn won her first senior national title at the 1969 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. That year she beat Canada&#x27;s Karen Magnussen for the North American Championship. She then finished 5th at the World Championships despite the absence of both Magnussen and Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Hana Mašková due to injuries. She fell behind Julie Lynn Holmes, whom she had beaten for the national title, while Gabriele Seyfert of East Germany took the gold medal. At the 1970 World Championships, Seyfert and Austria&#x27;s Trixi Schuba were again in 1st and 2nd place, while Holmes moved up to 3rd and Lynn finished in 6th. Part of the problem was an inconsistency in compulsory figures, which meant that she always had to make up ground in the free skating. Lynn made an effort to remedy this weakness by working with the great New York-based coach Pierre Brunet, who had previously had World Champions Carol Heiss and Donald Jackson under his tutelage. At the 1971 World Championships, she placed 5th in figures and skated well in the free skating to place 4th overall, while Schuba took the gold, Holmes the silver and Magnussen the bronze.

In 1972, Lynn beat Holmes for the national title for the fourth year in a row, and there were widespread predictions that she would take World and Olympic gold, especially because of Schuba&#x27;s weakness in free skating. Schuba&#x27;s lackluster performance at Lyon, France the previous year had even drawn boos, but she won the championship based on her enormous lead in the compulsory figures. At the 1972 Winter Olympics at Sapporo, Hokkaidō, Japan, Lynn placed 4th in the compulsory figures while Schuba established a large lead in the segment. Although Schuba placed 7th in the free skating, her lead in figures enabled her to take the gold medal, while Magnussen won the silver and Lynn took the bronze, an order of finish repeated at the 1972 World Championships in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

By this time, Lynn&#x27;s motivation was decreasing and she also struggled with her weight, leading her to consider leaving competition. She decided to continue competing and took her fifth National title in 1973. With Schuba&#x27;s retirement and the devaluation of compulsory figures caused by the addition of the short program to competitions, only Magnussen seemed to stand in her way. At the 1973 World Championships, Lynn skated her best figures ever, taking 2nd in that discipline, but in the newly introduced short program of required jumps and spins, which she had been expected to win, two falls landed her in 12th position. She won the free skate and moved up to take the silver medal in the final event of her amateur career.

==Professional career==
Lynn&#x27;s popularity was such that the Ice Follies offered her a three-year contract for $1,455,000, which made her the highest-paid female professional athlete of the time. Ice Follies with Lynn as its star positioned itself on a firmer basis in its rivalry with the Ice Capades. In 1974, Janet Lynn became the World Professional Champion in an event created by promoter Dick Button to showcase her.

Lynn&#x27;s professional career was cut short after only two years by problems with allergy-related asthma exacerbated by the cold, damp air in skating rinks. In 1975, she retired from skating and started a family. In the early 1980s, with her asthma under control, she returned to skate professionally for a few years. She again appeared in Button&#x27;s professional competitions and co-starred with John Curry in his made-for-TV ice ballet, &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;.

==Legacy==
The contrast between Lynn and Trixi Schuba was one of the reasons why the International Skating Union devalued the weight of compulsory figures in competition by introducing the short program. Since compulsory figures were rarely televised and were not well understood by the general public, television audiences were confused and angry when skaters such as Lynn, who excelled in the free skate, consistently lost competitions to skaters such as Schuba, who were not as strong in the free skate.

Lynn was known as one of figure skating&#x27;s early pioneers of women&#x27;s triple jumps, but she was also well known for her &quot;musical expressiveness, graceful movement, and the almost ethereal quality of her skating&quot;. She has also been credited with the introduction of the short program in singles skating, the increase in the value of the free skating program, and the eventual devaluing of compulsive figures. According to figure skating writing and historian Ellyn Kestnbaum, Lynn, along with her contemporary Dorothy Hamill, &quot;evoked associations with natural, outdoorsy wholesomeness&quot; due to their athleticism, speed, freedom of movement, and appearance, which Kestnbaum states were &quot;images that resonated with both conservative and feminist ideologies during the 1970s&quot; Lynn was called &quot;a peerless artist&quot;, a skater known for both her artistry and athleticism, although as Kestnbaum states, Lynn&#x27;s performances seemed to be more of an expression of who she was as a person than a carefully crafted work of art.

<doc id="1346425" wikidata="Q4642697" url="?curid=1346425" title="6th Infantry Regiment (United States)">
<text>The 6th Infantry Regiment (&quot;Regulars&quot;) was formed 11 January 1812. Zachary Taylor, later the twelfth President of the United States, was a commander of the unit. The motto, &quot;Regulars, By God!&quot; derives from the Battle of Chippawa, in which British Major General Phineas Riall noticed that the approaching regiment wore militia uniforms. Having defeated militia troops in the Battle of Queenston Heights, Riall assumed another easy victory. Instead, the American regiment pressed the attack. According to the memoirs of regimental commander Winfield Scott, later commanding general of the United States Army, when Riall realized his error, he remarked &quot;Why, these are regulars!.&quot;

== History ==
The regiment participated in the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War, the American Civil War, the Indian Wars (1823–1879), the Spanish–American War, Philippine–American War (1899–1913), the Pancho Villa Expedition (1916–1917), World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War. Elements of the 6th Infantry were also part of IFOR, Task Force Eagle, which was charged with implementing the military aspects of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In September 1989, the 4th Battalion 6th Infantry deployed to Panama, playing a key role in Operation Just Cause. In January 1994, the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry deployed to Macedonia for Operation Able Sentry as part of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force. In May 1998, Company B was deployed again to Bosnia-Herzegovina in support of Operation Joint Endeavor, Operation Joint Forge (OJE/OJF). In 1999, elements were deployed to Albania for the initial launch of support and liberation of Kosovo. In March 2003, Company C, 2nd Battalion deployed with HQ V Corps to Kuwait and participated in the initial invasion of Iraq. The rest of the 2nd Battalion and 1st Battalion deployed to Iraq in late April 2003 as part of 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division. The &quot;Regulars&quot; arrived in Baghdad in May 2003 and were the first to relieve elements of the 3rd Infantry Division in Baghdad. The 1st and 2nd Battalions deployed again in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in November 2005 and April 2008. The 4th Battalion, 6th Infantry deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom/New Dawn from May 2009 to May 2010. In August 2011, the 4th Battalion deployed to Al-Asad and FOB Hammer in Iraq in support of Operation New Dawn. They returned in December of that year when the U.S. and Iraqi government failed to come to an agreement concerning soldiers diplomatic immunity, making the Regulars one of the last units to withdraw from the Iraq.

Two battalions of the 6th Infantry Regiment are currently assigned to the 1st Armored Division; the 1st Battalion with the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, and the 4th Battalion with the 3rd Brigade Combat Team.

==Lineage==

===Pre-World War I===

;Lineage

Constituted 11 January 1812 in the Regular Army as the 11th Infantry Regiment.

Organized March–May 1812 in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Connecticut.

Consolidated May–October 1815 with the 25th Infantry (constituted 26 June 1812) and the 27th, 29th, and 37th Infantry (all constituted 29 January 1813) to form the 6th Infantry Regiment. The lineages of the units that made up the 6th Infantry give the regiment campaign credit for the War of 1812.

Consolidated 1 May 1869 with the 42d Infantry Regiment, Veteran Reserve Corps (constituted 21 September 1866), and consolidated unit designated as the 6th Infantry Regiment.

;Narrative

The present 6th United States Infantry traces its lineage back to 11 January 1812, when the Congress authorized a strengthening of the regular Army in preparation for the conflict that became known as the War of 1812. The unit was first known as the 11th Infantry Regiment and served as such on the Upper Canada–US border throughout the War of 1812.

In 1831 and 1832, the regiment entered the series of actions to be known as the Black Hawk War, against the Sac and Fox Indians. On 2 August 1832, the 6th Infantry caught the Indians at the junction of the Bad Axe River with the Mississippi River (in present-day Wisconsin), and killed most of Black Hawk&#x27;s band (records say that 950 Sac were massacred), earning the campaign streamer BLACK HAWK. In 1837, the units of the regiment left Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, for Florida via Louisiana. As part of a force commanded by Colonel Zachary Taylor, the regiment entered the Second Seminole War in eastern Florida in 1837. It was the first &quot;guerrilla-style&quot; war fought by US troops.

*1848 A Company was sent from Fort Snelling to construct Fort Ripley. 
*In 1850 E Company was sent from Fort Snelling to build and garrison Fort Dodge. 
*In 1853 E Co. deactivated Fort Dodge and went north to assist Companies C and K build Fort Ridgely. C
*The 6th Infantry Regiment served in the Mexican–American War, participating in Scott&#x27;s campaign to Mexico City. They fought in the Siege of Veracruz, at Cerro Gordo, Churubusco, Molino del Rey and at Chapultepec.

From late 1860 to mid-1861 detachments of Company B from Fort Humboldt were involved in the Bald Hills War, patrolling and in 1861, skirmishing with the local Indians on Mad and Eel Rivers and their tributaries.

At the outset of the Civil War in April 1861, the regiment was directed to hurry eastward from Oregon and California and join the Federal forces. According to one biographer of the time, &quot;Several of the Regiment&#x27;s best and bravest officers, honest in the mistaken construction of the Constitution and true to their convictions as to their duty, had tendered their resignations and given themselves to the Confederate cause.&quot; One of those officers was the regimental commander, Major Lewis Armistead. During the Civil War, the 6th U.S. Infantry Regiment lost 75 men during service; two officers and 29 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, and one officer and 43 enlisted men by disease.

For six years after the Civil War, the regiment served at various stations in Georgia and South Carolina.
*Company G would be at Fort Buford, North Dakota 1n 1870. 
*It moved to Fort Hays, Kansas, in October 1871. The regiment saw duty on the frontier in Kansas, Colorado, Iowa, Wyoming, Idaho and Utah. 
*In 1872 under Col. William B. Hazen, the regiment was transferred to the Department of Dakota and based out of Fort Buford Dakota Territory, fighting many engagements against hostile Indian forces. 
*In 1872 B &amp; C Companies built Fort McKeen, North Dakota which was renamed Fort Abraham Lincoln. 
*In 1872 and 1873, the regiment earned campaign streamers NORTH DAKOTA 1872 and NORTH DAKOTA 1873. The next several years saw much action for the regiment during the Indian Wars many of which in Montana Territory, and they were awarded campaign streamers MONTANA 1879, LITTLE BIG HORN, CHEYENNES, and UTES.
*In 1880, the regiment moved to Fort Thomas, Kentucky, where it remained until called to action again in June 1898, in the Spanish–American War. On 1 July 1898, the 6th Regiment took the brunt of the fighting during the charge up San Juan Hill.

The regiment returned to the United States, serving at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, from the end of 1898 until late July 1899, when it sailed to the Philippines aboard USAT &quot;Sherman&quot; to help quell the insurgents in the Philippine–American War. The Moro tribe was one of the toughest enemies the 6th had ever faced—every one of them fought to the death, and preferred to do it in hand-to-hand style. The regiment fought over fifty engagements, and it left with campaign streamers for JOLO, NEGROS in 1899, and PANAY in 1900. In March 1905, the regiment returned to the Philippines to fight the Moros again. For three days in 1906, elements of the regiment fought in the First Battle of Bud Dajo, one of the fiercest conflicts of the entire island campaign. The successful ending to the battle broke the Moro strength and ended the fighting in that part of the island.

One 6th Infantry soldier received the Medal of Honor for service in the Philippines: Captain Bernard A. Byrne, 19 July 1899, Bobong, Negros

Following service in the Philippines, the 6th returned to the Presidio of San Francisco, California. In May 1914, it entered into service on the Mexican border. In March 1916, it proceeded to San Antonio, Chihuahua, as part of the Punitive Expedition under Brigadier General John J. Pershing. In February 1917, Pershing&#x27;s force withdrew from Mexico and the regiment moved to Fort Bliss. Because of their action, the regiment was awarded another campaign streamer – MEXICO 1916–1917.

===World War I===

;Lineage
Assigned 18 November 1917 to the 5th Division

;Narrative

In December 1917, the 6th Regiment was assigned to the 10th Infantry Brigade, 5th Division, and began training stateside. In the latter part of May 1918, the 6th Infantry Regiment was declared ready for introduction to combat and was placed at the disposal of the French for service at the front. In July 1918, a strategic offensive plan was agreed upon by the Allied commanders, the immediate purpose of which was to reduce the salients which interfered with further offensive operations. One of these was the Saint-Mihiel salient. The First U.S. Army was organized on 10 August and directed to launch an offensive on 12 September to reduce this salient. The 6th Regiment was destined to play an important role in this operation. On 1 December 1918 the 6th Regiment conducted a march from Luxembourg to the city of Trier, Germany, becoming the first American troops to enter that ancient city.

===Inter-war period===

The 6th Infantry Regiment arrived at the port of New York on 13 July 1919 on the troopship USS America, and emergency period personnel were discharged from the service. The regiment was transferred on 28 July 1919 to Camp Gordon, Georgia, and subsequently to Camp Jackson, South Carolina. on 29 December 1920. It was relieved in August 1921 from the 5th Division and ordered on 2 September 1921 to transfer to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. It conducted a 1,200-mile foot march from Camp Jackson, and arrived 3 November 1921 at Jefferson Barracks. The regiment was reviewed on 3 November 1921 by General John J. Pershing, the former commander of the American Expeditionary Force, and Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France upon its arrival in St. Louis, Missouri. It was assigned to the 6th Division on 24 March 1923. It participated in tornado relief duties at St. Louis from 3–7 October 1927. The 3rd Battalion was inactivated on 31 October 1929, and was subsequently reorganized as a &quot;Regular Army Inactive&quot; (RAI) unit with Organized Reserve personnel; assigned Reserve officers conducted summer training with the regiment at Jefferson Barracks. 

In April 1933, the regiment assumed command and control of the Jefferson Barracks Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) District (later redesignated the Missouri CCC District). Elements participated in the “Century of Progress” exposition in Chicago, Illinois, from May–November 1933. When the 6th Division was converted to a &quot;triangular&quot; division in 1939, the regiment was temporarily assigned to the 7th Division&#x27;s 14th Infantry Brigade on 16 October 1939. The 3rd Battalion, less Reserve personnel, was activated in early 1940 at Jefferson Barracks. The entire regiment was transferred on 2 March 1940 to Fort Knox, Kentucky, and was relieved on 1 June 1940 from the 14th Infantry Brigade. The regiment returned to Jefferson Barracks on 1 July 1940, was reorganized and redesignated the 6th Infantry Regiment (Armored) on 15 July 1940, and assigned to the 1st Armored Division. It transferred 7 August 1940 back to Fort Knox. In April, the regiment supplied a cadre for the 51st Infantry Regiment of the 4th Armored Division. In August, the regiment moved to Louisiana to conduct maneuvers, then returned to Fort Knox in November. 

===World War II===
The 1st Armored Division was one of the first American units to sail across the Atlantic to do battle with the Axis. Leaving from Fort Dix, New Jersey on 11 April 1942, the Old Ironsides patch set foot on European soil in Northern Ireland on 16 May 1942. Here, they trained with a new intensity as they prepared to go into battle for the first time.

====Algeria-French Morocco====

On 8 November 1942, almost a full year after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Allied American, Free French, and British armies launched Operation Torch, the seaborne invasion of French North Africa. The 6th Armored Infantry Regiment was commanded by COL Claud E. Stadtman at this time, and his force was divided into different Combat Commands and Task Forces. 3rd Battalion-6th Infantry (3-6 IN), under the command of LTC George F. Marshall, was assigned to Operation Reservist with the mission of sailing directly into the Oran harbor and capturing valuable facilities and ships before the Vichy French could mount an effective resistance. The amphibious assault began shortly after 0200, but one landing craft&#x27;s engine caught fire, alerting the defenders to their presence. They were met with a devastating volley from the French shore defenses which also managed to destroy their Royal Navy escort ships, HMS &quot;Hartland&quot; and HMS &quot;Walney&quot;. Out of 393, 9 officers were killed (including LTC Marshall), 180 enlisted men were killed, and 5 officers and 152 enlisted men were wounded. Only 47 men survived unscathed. For their outstanding courage under fire in their first action of WWII, 3-6 IN was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation, but ceased to exist as a fighting unit for the time being.

Despite this disaster, the other landings of Operation Torch were still scheduled to be underway in the morning, and the vehicles and men of General Lunsford E. Oliver&#x27;s Task Force Red (TF Red) began landing at Z Beach to the east of Oran in the Gulf of Arzew with the mission of seizing the Tafaraoui airfield. Attached to this TF was E Company, 2nd Battalion-6th Armored Infantry (2-6 IN) under CPT Donald A. Kersting. 1LT R. H. Leed&#x27;s 1st Platoon, E/2-6 IN was the advance guard for the Task Force, and they managed to reach the airfield by 1100. Attacking alongside elements of the 1st Battalion-1st Armored Regiment, LT Leeb&#x27;s Platoon rolled onto the airfield from the east while 2nd and 3rd PLTs (under LTs J. F. Sullivan and Jesse E. Frank respectively) blocked off approaches from Oran and managed to capture an enemy ammunition train. TF Red&#x27;s initial objective had been accomplished.

To the west of Oran, 1st Battalion-6th Armored Infantry (1-6 IN), under the command of LTC William B. Kern, was assigned to TF Green, and they quickly assaulted and captured Y Beach without opposition. B Company was detached from 1-6 IN and joined 1st Battalion-13th Armored Regiment in their push to secure La Senia airfield, but the flying column was delayed by French anti-tank guns, forcing TF Green to halt for the day. A platoon from E Co to the east was brought to help secure the airfield on 9 November. On 10 November, TF Red and TF Green converged on Oran. In the initial push into Oran, A Company (under CPT Thomas Hoban), as well as the Battalion cannon platoon for 1-6 IN supported TF Green&#x27;s attack. Oran was secured by 1215 after French hold-outs and snipers were cleared from the city. At this point, many of the Vichy French soldiers joined the Free French and the Allied cause, and the Vichy government was dissolved by the Germans. The Vichy soldiers fought halfheartedly against an erstwhile enemy they didn&#x27;t hate, but the 6th Armored Infantry Regiment&#x27;s next enemy would not be so easy.

====Tunisia====
After the Vichy French forces were defeated in Algeria, Allied efforts moved east, toward Tunisia. In a series of rapid thrusts beginning on 24 November, elements of the 1st Armored Division and other Allied units began advancing on Tunis. Despite early American success, a German-Italian force under General Wolfgang Fischer counterattacked on 1 December, driving Allied units back. LTC McGinness&#x27; 2-6 Infantry arrived in the area that afternoon and began staging for an Allied counterattack. The next day, 2 December, Axis units began harassing Allied lines of communication along the Medjez-el-Bab-Tebourba road, so LTC Kern&#x27;s 1-6 Infantry was sent to destroy them, which they did with the help of C Bty, 27th Armored Field Artillery Battalion. By 4 December, the enemy had retaken the town of Tebourba, and the Allied forces rushed to get into defensive positions after plans for a counterattack were abandoned. 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 6th Armored Infantry formed the main body of this defensive line, supported by elements of the 1st Armored Regiment, 13th Armored Regiment, 27th Field Artillery, and 701st Tank Destroyer Battalion.

LTC Kern&#x27;s 1-6 Infantry, supported by B and C Bty, 27th Artillery, occupied the most exposed position of the Allied line at Djebel el Guessa and Djebel bou Aoukaz. Between these two hill masses, there lies an east–west pass that enemy forces would need to seize if they were to pierce the Allied line. The Battalion was strung out over five miles and the platoons were separated by deep ravines and would have difficulty supporting each other. On the morning of 5 December, a clear cool day, 1-6 IN came under enemy observation and endured heavy mortar and artillery fire, a sign that the enemy was soon to attack. A Co, under CPT Hoban, spotted enemy digging in to the north of Djebel el Guessa, so LTC Kern moved B Co, under CPT Walter Geyer, onto the ridge behind A Co to gain depth in his defense. After a night of continual illumination from flares, the Germans attacked on the morning of 6 December at roughly 0800. A combined attack from Stuka dive-bombers, infantry, and tanks hit A Co. Seven &quot;Panzers&quot; attacked through a gap in the ridgeline, isolating 3rd Platoon and allowing German infantry to advance up the sheltered ravines. At 0900, another German armored attack twice the size of the first one attacked C Co, under CPT George Miller, from multiple directions. This attack left C Co disorganized and the Germans seemed likely to cut off 1-6 IN&#x27;s route of escape. Allied armored elements began massing to counterattack on other parts of the line. For hours, 1-6 IN held on to their positions. A Co was temporarily relieved when it pulled in its left flank by using the Battalion machine-gun platoon to pin down enemy infantry. After a counterattack by B Co&#x27;s halftracks, A Co successfully withdrew to the ridge held by B Co. To the south, C Bty, 27th Artillery fired support missions for C Co, 1-6 IN temporarily checking the German advance and allowing CPT Miller&#x27;s company to reorganize, but at the cost of the destruction of the Battery from German counterfire. Meanwhile, the Battalion Reconnaissance Platoon began seeking a ford in the Medjerda River to bring in armored reinforcements. 1-6 IN&#x27;s one remaining assault gun fired and maneuvered against the German vehicles, and despite not destroying any of them, the crew delayed their advance long enough to allow arriving reinforcements to cross the river without being fired upon.

Finally, E Co, 2-6 IN arrived at 1117 and forded the Medjerda River but were forced to leave all their vehicles behind. The rest of LTC McGinness&#x27; Battalion arrived and forced the river at 1228. With the arrival of these fresh infantrymen and some tanks from 2-13 Armor, the Germans temporarily withdrew, allowing LTC Kern to reorganize his exhausted Battalion on the flat terrain behind the armor. The Americans then counterattacked but were severely defeated by German defensive positions and anti-tank guns, leaving many destroyed M3 Lee tanks behind, burning under the desert sky. The losses of the day had been severe. A Co and B Co had suffered heavily, and CPT Geyer had been wounded. C Co&#x27;s Commander, CPT Miller, had been killed, and the company had lost many men and much of its equipment. Despite this, 1st Battalion-6th Armored Infantry Regiment had performed bravely in their defense against superior enemy armored units, and their exploits would go down in 1st Armored Division history.

====Italy====
They landed in Italy on 28 October 1943. The regiment remained there until it was reorganized on 20 July 1944 and its elements were redesignated as elements of the 1st Armored Division as follows:
* 6th Armored Infantry Regiment (less 2d and 3d Battalions) as the 6th Armored Infantry Battalion

* 3d Battalion as the 14th Armored Infantry Battalion

One soldier of the 6th Armored Infantry Regiment and its successor battalions received the Medal of Honor for service during World War II; Private Nicholas Minue, Company A, 6th Armored Infantry Regiment, 28 April 1943, near Medjez el Bab, Tunisia (posthumous)

After the war, the above units underwent changes as follows:
* 6th Armored Infantry Battalion converted and redesignated 1 May 1946 as the 12th Constabulary Squadron; concurrently relieved from assignment to the 1st Armored Division and assigned to the 1st Constabulary Regiment.

===Post World War II===

;Lineage

6th Infantry activated 16 October 1950 in Germany.

Reorganized 1 June 1958 as a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System.

Withdrawn 16 June 1989 from the Combat Arms Regimental System and reorganized under the United States Army Regimental System.

;Narrative

In October 1950 the 6th Infantry was reconstituted as a regular infantry regiment forming the U.S. garrison in West Berlin, designated as Berlin Command. The existing garrison units, the 16th Constabulary Squadron and the 3rd Battalion, 16th Infantry, were reflagged as the 1st and 3rd Battalions, 6th Infantry. The 2nd Battalion was assembled from troops in West Germany.

In 1958 Berlin Command was reorganized as a Pentomic unit. The 6th Regiment was reorganized as the 2nd and 3rd Battle Groups, 6th Infantry. The 1st Battalion (1st Battle Group) was changed to 1st Armored Rifle Battalion. On 1 December 1961 the occupation forces were designated Berlin Brigade. In 1964, Berlin Brigade was reorganized again. 2nd and 3rd Battle Groups were redesignated 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 6th Infantry, and 4th Battalion was also formed from cadre of the two battle groups.

===Vietnam War===
On 17 May 1967, the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry was reorganized as a standard Infantry Battalion and was assigned to the 198th Light Infantry Brigade, in the Americal (23rd Infantry) Division. The 1–6th Infantry was the division&#x27;s first element ashore, arriving at Chu Lai in October to participate in its thirty-fifth campaign and ninth war. After a brief initial operation south of Đức Phổ, the battalion was assigned the mission of securing the installation at Chu Lai.

1–6th Infantry participated in Task Force Oregon, Task Force Miracle, Operation Wheeler/Wallowa, Operation Burlington Trail, and had the mission of protecting Americal Division Headquarters and Chu Lai Defense Command from enemy ground mortar and rocket attacks. The 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry was awarded the Valorous Unit Citation for its victory at the Battle of Lo Giang, 7–11 February 1968. &quot;Task Force Miracle&quot; was formed in February 1968 during the enemy&#x27;s Tet Offensive when the city of Da Nang was threatened by the 60th Main Force Viet Cong Battalion. The 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry and 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry assisted the Marines in the fighting. After four days of fierce fighting, the threat to Da Nang was obliterated and the task force was deactivated and returned to the Americal area of operation. During the Vietnam War, the Sixth was awarded streamers – COUNTEROFFENSIVE PHASE III, TET COUNTEROFFENSIVE, COUNTEROFFENSIVE PHASE IV, COUNTEROFFENSIVE PHASE V, COUNTEROFFENSIVE PHASE VI, TET 69 / COUNTEROFFENSIVE, SUMMER-FALL 1969, WINTER-SPRING 1970, SANCTUARY COUNTEROFFENSIVE, COUNTEROFFENSIVE PHASE VII, and CONSOLIDATION I.

On 15 February 1969, the battalion was released from the 198th Light Infantry Brigade and assigned to the 23rd Infantry Division, Americal Division.

===Cold War===
On 13 September 1972 was reassigned to the 1st Armored Division, and was posted at Stork Barracks in Illesheim, West Germany.

During 1st Armored Division&#x27;s closing months at Ft. Hood, Texas in 1970-71 prior to the division&#x27;s assignment to Germany, 5th Battalion, 6th Infantry was the 1st Brigade&#x27;s mechanized infantry battalion.

In 1974, the regiment was split again, this time between Germany and the United States. The 1st Battalion was assigned to the 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division in Illesheim, Germany. The 2nd Battalion was assigned to the 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division in Erlangen, Germany, a three tank battalion brigade with 2nd Battalion, 6th Infantry as the brigade&#x27;s mechanized infantry. The three Berlin Brigade battalions were reflagged as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions, 502nd Infantry. The 3rd and 4th Battalions were assigned to the 2nd Brigade, 5th Infantry Division at Fort Polk, Louisiana, where elements participated in Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989, earning campaign streamer – PANAMA, and the Valorous Unit Award for Panama. In 1989, the unit also received the Army Superior Unit Award. The 5th Battalion was assigned to the 3rd Brigade of the 5th Infantry Division. The 6th Battalion and 7th Battalion were assigned to 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division, Bamberg, Germany.

===Post-Cold War===
In 1990, the 6th and 7th Battalions were called on to participate in the regiment&#x27;s tenth war, Operation Desert Shield / Desert Storm. During that war in the Persian Gulf, the regiment earned campaign streamers – DEFENSE OF SAUDI ARABIA, LIBERATION AND DEFENSE OF KUWAIT, and CEASE-FIRE, as well as Valorous Unit Citations for Iraq and Iraq-Kuwait.

In 1993, the 5th Infantry Division was deactivated, and the 3rd, 4th and 5th Battalions were re-flagged under the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood. In early 1990 the 1st Battalion moved from Illesheim to Vilseck, Germany, as part of 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division. In late 1990, as part of deployments for Desert Storm / Desert Shield, 1st Battalion became a component of the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division; and the 6th and 7th Battalions were deactivated. The 4th Battalion was then reflagged again as 2/7 Cavalry under the 1st Cavalry Division (United States).

===War on Terrorism===
In April 2003, the 1st infantry regiment deployed to Iraq for 17 months.

In November 2005, the 1st and 2nd Battalion&#x27;s 6th Infantry Regiment deployed to Kuwait where they remained assigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1AD, and served as part of the regional quick reaction force (QRF) stationed at Camp Buehring, Kuwait. By Spring 2006 the situation in Iraq deteriorated, leading to the call forward of the regional (QRF) in Kuwait. From there, Bravo Company 2-6 IN &quot;Death Dealers&quot; were sent to Ramadi, Iraq (via TQ Air Base) and operationally assigned to Task Force 1-35 Armor, Commanded by LTC Tony Deane. Bravo, 2-6 IN &#x27;Death Dealers&#x27; or &quot;Team Dealer&quot; were assigned the hotly contested Al Tamim District of Ramadi&#x27;s West side. Nearly a city unto itself, Tamim was 25 Sq Miles of mostly AQI controlled city. The Team Dealer Mission was to destroy enemy forces, and recapture territory seized by the enemy (AQI, a precursor to ISIL), while securing the local population helping to rebuilding relationships with local leaders.

During that time the Regulars operated out of the four main U.S. bases in the area: Camp Ramadi, Blue Diamond, Corregidor, and COP Dealer. These three bases provided the Regulars a triangle-shaped perimeter from which to launch operations into the center of the city of Ramadi. Instead of a Fallujah-style sweep, the combat outpost style of fighting was used where the Regulars created patrol bases deep inside various neighborhoods of the city form which to stage operations, pull security, and draw contact. The soldiers split their time between operating out of the combat outposts and re-fitting and operating from the main bases.

B Company 2-6 IN &quot;Team Dealer&quot; owned and controlled its battlespace, Al-Taʾmīm. The regulars of Team Dealer were never attached to the command of other units. All units planning operations in Al-Taʾmīm, including NSW (SEALs) and other SOF or OGA units always reported to Team Dealer before planning ops in Al-Taʾmīm. And Team Dealer leadership had command and controlled of all operations in Al-Taʾmīm. Team Dealer respectfully and gratefully partnered with many other tactical units in Ramadi—Enablers such as NSW, Navy SEALs, EOD, Marine Anglico and dog teams. At no point was there a question who was in operational control while on patrol. In fact Team Dealer ran its own separate Tactical Operations Center, separate from that of the Battalion Task Force. Al-Taʾmīm belonged to Dealer, because its soldiers patrolled it every day and expertly knew the battlefield and their enemy. It was precisely because Team Dealer brought so much fire power to the fight that they made all final operational decisions.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine called Ramadi the most dangerous place on the planet at that time. The Regulars served alongside the 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry, &quot;Red Currahee,&quot; Seal Team Three, and many other units. One Navy SEAL, Michael Monsoor, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for saving the lives of several of his team members during intense fighting in Ramadi. The Regulars were awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation as part of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Armored Division for their actions in Ramadi.

In 2009 the 4th Battalion, assigned to 4th HBCT, 1st Armored Division deployed in support of Operation Iraq Freedom. Following a deployment to Maysan Province the 4th Battalion was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.

In August, 2011 4th Battalion, again with 4th HBCT 1st Armored deployed to Iraq. Alpha, Delta and Headquarters company were assigned to Al Asad airbase. Bravo and Charlie companies were sent to Forward Operating Base Hammer. The battalion returned home in December 2011, one of the last Army ground forces to leave Iraq at the end of Operation New Dawn.

Shortly after their return to Fort Bliss, Texas, members of 4th Battalion were advised of an imminent deployment as security forces advise and assist teams (SFAAT) to Afghanistan. The first SFAAT teams deployed in June 2012, only 10 months after their deployment to Iraq.

<doc id="1346428" wikidata="Q964779" url="?curid=1346428" title="Heist (2001 film)">
<text>Heist is a 2001 American heist crime drama film written and directed by David Mamet and starring Gene Hackman, Danny DeVito and Delroy Lindo, with Rebecca Pidgeon, Ricky Jay, Patti Lupone and Sam Rockwell in supporting roles.

&quot;Heist&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its characters and script. Although it grossed just around its production budget, the film became the highest-grossing film directed by Mamet in the United States with $23 million, and went on to become a popular hit in the home video market.

==Plot==
Joe Moore runs a ring of professional thieves, which includes Bobby Blane, Donnie &quot;Pinky&quot; Pincus and Joe&#x27;s wife Fran. During a robbery of a New York City jewelry store, Joe takes off his mask in a successful effort to distract the store&#x27;s last remaining employee, allowing his face to be captured by a security camera; he is unable to retrieve the video evidence before they have to flee. As both the picture and a witness can identify him, Joe retires from crime and plans to disappear on his sailboat with Fran.

This does not sit well with Joe&#x27;s fence, Mickey Bergman, who runs a garment business as a front. Having accrued significant expenses in setting up another robbery, Bergman decides to withhold the payment of the jewelry heist from Joe and his crew, so that they go through with the next jobrobbing an airplane carrying a large shipment of gold. Bergman further insists that his nephew, Jimmy Silk, be a part of the crew. Joe accepts, but a series of shifting loyalties changes the complexity of their task, including Jimmy&#x27;s interest in Fran, along with Bergman and Jimmy&#x27;s belief that Joe&#x27;s skills are declining.

While setting up an element needed for the robbery, they are stopped by a passing police officer. While Joe and Bobby talk the officer into leaving, an agitated Jimmy draws his gun but is stopped by Pinky. Joe forces the team out of finishing the job by leading Jimmy to believe that Pinky did not destroy the getaway car, covered in the team&#x27;s fingerprints. The deceit is discovered and Bergman forces them to finish the job.

The plane robbery is a series of misdirects. Pinky poses as a guard while Joe, Bobby and Jimmy pose as airport security personnel. They stop the jet, pretending to be responding to an emergency. They fill a van with what they take from the plane, then move the van to a rented garage on the airport grounds, where they re-brand it and call for a tow truck to have it hauled away.

Jimmy betrays the others to steal the gold and Fran. He knocks out Joe and tells Fran he knows Joe has changed the plan. He and Fran take the van, but Jimmy finds out that the hidden compartments are filled with metal washers. Joe avoids arrest and returns to the plane in disguise. He and Bobby remove a shipment of goods they had booked on board the same Swiss flight, which they insist now must be driven to its destination due to the plane&#x27;s delay. Inside the shipment is the stolen gold, which Joe and Bobby melt into numerous 7-foot-long rods.

Bergman apprehends Pinky, who is walking his niece to school. Pinky discloses the plan in order to save his niece, but he tips off Joe with a code word during a phone call and is killed. Bergman and his crew arrive at Joe&#x27;s sailboat along with Jimmy and Fran, where they hold Joe at gunpoint. They assume that the boat&#x27;s golden railings are the gold. Fran leaves with Jimmy, pleading with Bergman to let Joe go. Just as Bergman discovers that the railings are not the gold, a hidden Bobby opens fire. They kill Bergman&#x27;s men, then Joe kills Bergman. Bobby gives Joe the address to send his share.

Joe waits to meet Fran with a truck filled with black-painted rods, but Fran, having switched sides, holds up Joe with Jimmy, taking that truck. Joe gets into a second truck to leave. A black bar in the truck scrapes the garage door, revealing gold underneath. Joe lifts a tarp in the truck bed, revealing the gold rods. He covers the rods with a tarpaulin and drives away.

==Cast==
* Gene Hackman as Joe Moore
* Danny DeVito as Mickey Bergman
* Delroy Lindo as Bobby Blane
* Rebecca Pidgeon as Fran Moore
* Sam Rockwell as Jimmy Silk
* Ricky Jay as Donnie &quot;Pinky&quot; Pinkus

==Production==
Franchise Pictures agreed to finance the film as long as it starred Gene Hackman and Danny DeVito. David Mamet enjoyed great creative freedom throughout production, because Franchise Pictures did not creatively interfere, only requiring him to finish the film within a certain budget.

The film, set mostly in and around Boston, was shot in Montreal. The opening scene, showcasing a New York jewelry store robbery, was filmed in an Old Montreal building in the process of being renovated into a hotel. The airport scenes, set at Boston&#x27;s Logan Airport, were filmed at Montréal–Mirabel International Airport.

The film made a profit through international pre-sales before it was finished.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, wrote, &quot;&quot;Heist&quot; is the kind of caper movie that was made before special effects replaced wit, construction and intelligence. This movie is made out of fresh ingredients, not cake mix. Despite the twists of its plot, it is about its characters.&quot; He went on to praise Mamet&#x27;s trademark verbal constructions, his restrained approach to on-screen gunplay, and the care that he takes in shaping the relationships between the principals.

===Box office===
&quot;Heist&quot; grossed $23.5 million in U.S. and Canada, and $5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $28.5 million.

In its opening weekend, the film opened at number 5 and grossed $7.8 million from 1,891 theaters in the United States. It became the highest-grossing Mamet-directed film domestically.

===Home video===
The film generated more than $72 million in home video rentals in the United States.

<text>Warren Stanley &quot;Craig&quot; &quot;Rusty&quot; Slocum (November 14, 1934 – September 12, 1978) was an American character actor. He was best known for his roles of Noah Gifford and Harry Johnson on the television series &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, which was broadcast on ABC.

==Early life==

Craig was the son of Dr. Samuel A. Slocum and Rose Gottlieb Slocum, who were immigrants from Poland and/or Russia; census records differ as to who came from which. The family resided in the Bronx, Assembly District 2, of New York City. Craig had an older sister named Marilynn H. Slocum. According to census records, one of the parents had a teenage sister-in-law, Ann Rice, who resided with the Slocums for a time as well in the 1930s.

Craig also went by the name of Rusty from an early age, due to his red hair. He is known to have been friends with James Dean and his group in the early 1950s, according to several biographies, where he is referred to as Rusty Slocum. Craig is quoted speaking about Dean in &quot;The James Dean Story: A Myth-shattering Biography of an Icon&quot; by Ronald Martinetti.

Craig acted in a variety of small and uncredited roles in theatre, television, and film, starting in late 1949 or early 1950. He used a number of different names, Warren Slocum, Rusty Slocum, Craig Slocum. Some of Craig Slocum&#x27;s uncredited appearances were on &quot;Colgate Playhouse, Mr. Peepers, Father Knows Best, Playhouse 90, Climax,&quot; and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.

In October 1977, Craig Slocum wrote that he was starting work in North Carolina as a lead for an army training film as &quot;a captain.&quot; He wrote that it would not do much for his &quot;career,&quot; but that he appreciated the money. It is possible Craig continued to work in other industrial films.

Slocum, who had type 2 diabetes, died from insulin shock at age 43. His social security death index lists his name under Rusty Slocum. His place of burial is not publicly known.

<doc id="1346433" wikidata="Q706417" url="?curid=1346433" title="Little Jimmy Dickens">
<text>James Cecil Dickens (December 19, 1920 – January 2, 2015), better known by his stage name Little Jimmy Dickens, was an American country music singer and songwriter famous for his humorous novelty songs, his small size (4&#x27;10&quot; [150 cm]), and his rhinestone-studded outfits (which he is given credit for introducing into live country music performances). He started as a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1948 and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1983. Before his death he was the oldest living member of the Grand Ole Opry.

==Early life==
Dickens was born in Bolt, West Virginia. He began his musical career in the late 1930s, performing on radio station WJLS in Beckley, West Virginia, while attending West Virginia University. On the radio station, he got his experience with performers like Mel Steele, Molly O&#x27;Day and Johnnie Bailes. In the 1940s, Jimmy hosted his own radio programs in places like West Virginia, Indiana, Cincinnati, Kansas and even Ohio. He soon quit school to pursue a full-time music career, traveling the country performing on local radio stations under the name &quot;Jimmy the Kid&quot;.

==Career==

In 1948, Dickens was heard performing on WKNX, a radio station in Saginaw, Michigan, while on location at Buck Lake Ranch, Angola, Indiana. Roy Acuff introduced him to Art Satherley at Columbia Records and to officials from the Grand Ole Opry. Dickens signed with Columbia in September and joined the Opry in August. Around this time he began using the nickname Little Jimmy Dickens, inspired by his short stature.

Dickens recorded many novelty songs for Columbia, including &quot;Country Boy&quot;, &quot;A-Sleeping at the Foot of the Bed&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Little but I&#x27;m Loud&quot;. His song &quot;Take an Old Cold Tater (And Wait)&quot; inspired Hank Williams to nickname him Tater. Later, telling Dickens he needed a hit, Williams wrote &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot; in only 20 minutes while on a plane with Dickens, Minnie Pearl, and Pearl&#x27;s husband, Henry Cannon. A week later, Williams recorded the song himself, jokingly telling Dickens, &quot;That song&#x27;s too good for you!&quot;, to which Dickens replied, &quot;Much obliged, Hiram.&quot;

In 1950, Dickens formed the Country Boys with musicians Jabbo Arrington, Grady Martin, Bob Moore, and Thumbs Carllile. It was during this time that he discovered future Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Robbins at a Phoenix, Arizona, television station while on tour with the Grand Ole Opry road show. In 1957, Dickens left the Grand Ole Opry to tour with the &quot;Philip Morris Country Music Show&quot;.

In 1962, Dickens had his first top-10 country hit since 1954 with &quot;The Violet and a Rose&quot;.

In 1964, he became the first country artist to circle the globe while on tour. He also made numerous appearances on television, including on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. In 1965, he released his biggest hit, &quot;May the Bird of Paradise Fly Up Your Nose&quot;, which reached number 1 on the country chart and number 15 on the pop chart.

In the late 1960s, Dickens left Columbia for Decca Records before moving again to United Artists in 1971. That same year, he married his wife, Mona, and in 1975 he returned to the Grand Ole Opry. In 1983. Dickens was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

Dickens joined producers Randall Franks and Alan Autry for the &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; cast CD &quot;Christmas Time&#x27;s A Comin’&quot;, performing &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; with the cast. The CD was released by Sonlite and MGM/UA and was one of the most popular Christmas releases of 1991 and 1992 with Southern retailers.

===Later career===

In 1984, Dickens appeared in Hank Williams Jr.&#x27;s music video for the hit single &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight&quot;.
Toward the end of his life, Dickens made appearances in a number of music videos by fellow West Virginia native and country musician Brad Paisley. He was also featured on several of Paisley&#x27;s albums in bonus comedy tracks, along with other Opry mainstays such as George Jones and Bill Anderson. They were collectively referred to as the Kung-Pao Buckaroos.

With the death of Hank Locklin in March 2009, Dickens became the oldest living member of the Grand Ole Opry, at the age of 90. He made regular appearances as a host at the Opry, often with the self-deprecating joke that he was also known as &quot;Willie Nelson after taxes&quot;, playing on his resemblance to Nelson in his later years, Nelson&#x27;s highly publicized problems with the Internal Revenue Service, and Dickens&#x27; own short stature. At the 2011 CMA Awards, Dickens was dressed as Justin Bieber and made fun of Bieber&#x27;s then-current paternity scandal.

==Personal life==
Dickens married Connie Chapman in 1944; the marriage ended in divorce in 1955. Later that year, he married Ernestine Jones; she died in 1968 in an automobile accident while traveling in Texas. He married Mona Evans in 1971. They had two daughters, Pamela Detert and Lisa King.

==Death==
Dickens was hospitalized after a stroke on December 25, 2014, six days after marking his birthday in what would be his last appearance on the Opry. He died of cardiac arrest on January 2, 2015, at the age of 94. After his funeral on January 8, 2015, at the Grand Ole Opry House, Dickens was entombed in the Cross Mausoleum at Woodlawn Memorial Park in Nashville.

<text>ANZ Fiji is the largest bank in Fiji and has about a 40% market share. ANZ Fiji currently operates 13 branches country-wide.

==History==
ANZ Fiji traces its presence in Fiji back to 1873 through an acquisition. Investors from Auckland established the Fiji Banking and Commercial Trading Company Limited in 1873. However, the bank&#x27;s owners sold it in 1876 to the Bank of New Zealand (BNZ); ANZ Group acquired BNZ’s operations in 1990 after 114 years of Bank of New Zealand ownership.

ANZ’s own entry into the Pacific region dates back to 16 December 1880 when the Union Bank of Australia (est.1837) opened a branch in the old capital of Fiji, Levuka. However, the bank closed the branch in 1895. In 1951, Union Bank’s successor, ANZ, returned to Fiji with a representative office that it upgraded to a branch.

In 1985, ANZ acquired Barclays Bank’s operations, which Barclays had established in 1973. In 2001, ANZ bought Bank of Hawaii’s Bankoh subsidiary, which had three branches throughout Fiji. Bankoh had entered the Fijian banking market in 1993.

In February 2017, ANZ Fiji appointed Saud Abdul Minam as CEO of ANZ Fiji. Previously, Saud Abdul Minam served as Head of Commercial, Pacific at Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Limited. During his tenure as Head of Commercial, ANZ has announced free access to its internet banking platform and website for Vodafone Fiji users.
