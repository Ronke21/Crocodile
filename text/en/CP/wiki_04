<doc id="1311995" wikidata="Q202153" url="?curid=1311995" title="Gary Speed">
<text>Gary Andrew Speed (8 September 1969 – 27 November 2011) was a Welsh professional footballer and manager. As manager of Wales, Speed is often credited as being the catalyst for the change in fortunes of the national team and as setting the pathway to future successes.

Having played for the Leeds United youth team, he began his professional career with the club in 1988. With Leeds, he won the English First Division championship in 1991–92, and later played for Everton, Newcastle United, Bolton Wanderers and Sheffield United. He captained the Wales national football team until retiring from international football in 2004. He was the most capped outfield player for Wales and the second overall with 85 caps between 1990 and 2004 until being overtaken by Chris Gunter in 2018, playing mainly as a left-sided attacking midfielder. Speed was appointed manager of Sheffield United in 2010, but left the club after a few months in December 2010 to manage the Wales national team, remaining in this role until his death 11 months later.

Rarely troubled by injury or suspension, he held the record for the most appearances in the Premier League at 535, until it was surpassed by David James. At the time of his death, only James and Ryan Giggs had played in more Premier League matches than Speed. Including appearances in the Football League and cup competitions, he made 840 domestic appearances.

==Early life and career==
Speed was born in Mancot, Flintshire, Wales, although his parents Roger and Carol, sister Lesley and sons Thomas and Edward were all born in Chester. He attended Hawarden High School.

He supported Everton as a youngster. Whilst at school, he was employed as a paperboy and played for Flintshire Schoolboys, a local boys&#x27; team, and for Aston Park Rangers. As a youngster, Speed excelled at cricket and football.

==Club career==
===Leeds United===
Speed began his career with Leeds United as a trainee when he left school in June 1988, and was Peter Swan&#x27;s boot boy, before he signed a professional contract on 13 June 1988. Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson first noticed Speed in a youth team game while the player was playing in a left back position. Under Wilkinson, he made his first team debut aged 19 in a goalless draw against Oldham Athletic in the Football League Second Division. He would go on to play in nine out of the ten outfield positions, although he was predominantly a left-sided player.

He went on to play a key role, playing 41 of a possible 42 games and scoring seven goals, as Leeds won the Football League First Division championship title in 1992, as part of a midfield that also comprised Gordon Strachan, Gary McAllister and David Batty – former Leeds manager Eddie Gray considered it to be one of the greatest midfield line-ups in the modern era. Wilkinson named Speed as the club&#x27;s player of the season.

In September 1992, Speed was pivotal in Leeds&#x27; UEFA Champions League first-round tie against VfB Stuttgart. Stuttgart had won 3–0 at home and looked to be going through already. Speed helped Leeds to a 4–1 victory at Elland Road, scoring one of them with a &quot;superb left-foot volley&quot; which he later described as his best-ever goal. Although Leeds went out of the tie on the away goals rule, the club was later reinstated, for Stuttgart had fielded an ineligible player.

Speed was selected in the PFA Team of the Year for the 1992–93 season.

On 4 October 1995, Speed scored the winning goal as Leeds beat second division side Notts County in the second round of the League Cup. The match had seemed to be going to extra time, but Speed&#x27;s 90th-minute winning goal kept Leeds from needing a replay to overcome their lower-league opponents.

Speed featured in the 1996 Football League Cup final defeat by Aston Villa. Before transferring to Everton, Speed played in 312 games for Leeds United, scoring 57 goals.

===Everton===
A childhood Everton fan, Speed was signed by Joe Royle before the 1996–97 season, for a fee of £3.5 million. He made his debut on 17 August 1996, scoring against Newcastle United. In November of that year, Speed scored a hat-trick – the only one of his career – as Everton beat Southampton 7–1 at Goodison Park. Speed finished the season with 11 goals, joint top-scorer with Duncan Ferguson. Speed was also voted Everton Player of Year for his performances during his first season at the club.

Howard Kendall succeeded Royle as the manager at the start of the 1997–98 season, and nominated Speed as club captain. However, by the turn of the year the relationship between Speed and Kendall had soured. Speed played his last game for the club on 18 January 1998, scoring in a 3–1 win over Chelsea. He did not travel for their next game, away to West Ham United, and was subsequently sold to Newcastle for £5.5 million. The reasons underlying Speed&#x27;s departure were never revealed. He told the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;: &quot;You know why I&#x27;m leaving, but I can&#x27;t explain myself publicly because it would damage the good name of Everton Football Club and I&#x27;m not prepared to do that.&quot;

===Newcastle United===
Speed was signed for Newcastle United on 6 February 1998 by Kenny Dalglish, for a fee of £5.5 million. He made his debut as a starter in a 1–0 home Premier League defeat to West Ham United the next day. His first goal came in his fifth match, the sixth round proper of the 1997–98 FA Cup. At home to Barnsley, he scored the second goal of a 3–1 home win with a 27th-minute strike. His only league goal of the 1997–98 season came in a 3–1 home win over Chelsea in the penultimate league match on 2 May, with Newcastle&#x27;s third in the 59th minute. He finished the season by playing the 1998 FA Cup Final, which Newcastle lost 2–0 to Arsenal on 16 May.

Speed featured in the club&#x27;s FA Cup Final defeat to Manchester United on 22 May 1999. On 19 September 1999, he scored a goal in Newcastle&#x27;s 8–0 Premier League victory over Sheffield Wednesday in which his teammate Alan Shearer scored a joint-record five times. He also played in the UEFA Champions League with Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, scoring the 58th-minute equaliser in a 2–1 home victory over Dynamo Kyiv in the group stage on 29 October 2002.

===Bolton Wanderers===
Speed moved to Bolton Wanderers on a two-year deal in a £750,000 switch from Newcastle United in July 2004. He became the first player to make 500 Premier League appearances when he played in Bolton&#x27;s 4–0 victory over West Ham United in December 2006.

On 1 May 2007, Speed was named as the first-team coach for Bolton after Sam Allardyce stepped down from his job as manager. However, in October he left the coaching job and returned to being just a player with the club. Conflicting reports of the incident claimed that then manager Sammy Lee relieved him of his duties to concentrate on playing, but Speed, in an interview with the &quot;Bolton News&quot;, claimed he chose to step down.

Speed scored a header for Bolton against Reading on 25 August 2007, making him, at the time, the only player to have scored in every Premiership season to date. Ryan Giggs later matched this achievement on 20 October 2007, and passed it on 8 February 2009. It had been reported in December 2007 that Speed was a target for Derby County, but it was confirmed on 24 December 2007 that he would join Sheffield United on loan on 1 January 2008, with a view to a permanent move for a fee of about £250,000.

===Sheffield United===
Speed made his debut on the day of his transfer, being named in the starting eleven for a 0–0 away draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers on New Year&#x27;s Day 2008. He played regularly for the rest of the season and deputised as captain when Chris Morgan was unavailable. Having seen his penalty parried, Speed netted the rebound to score his first goal for United in a victory over Coventry City in March of that year. He went on to finish the season on three goals for United, scoring both goals in a 2–1 home victory over Bristol City in the penultimate game of the 2007–08 season. In an interview with BBC Wales on 10 May 2008, Speed hinted that the 2008–09 season may be his last playing before moving into coaching or management but stated that he had not yet made up his mind.

Speed started the next season as a regular fixture in the United midfield, but succumbed to a back injury in November 2008. Despite undergoing surgery to correct the problem he failed to regain his fitness and missed the rest of the season, concentrating instead on a coaching role at the club. In June 2009, he was approached by Swansea City with regards to taking on the managerial role left vacant by Roberto Martínez. He continued training and completed the 2010 London Marathon in aid of the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, the cancer charity founded by Speed&#x27;s former Newcastle manager, who had died of the illness in 2009. Speed&#x27;s finishing time was 3 hours, 49 minutes and 22 seconds.

Speed finally announced his retirement from playing in his 41st year, but agreed to remain at Sheffield United for at least one more season as a coach. Despite this he was again registered as a player and was named on the bench for the first round League Cup game against Hartlepool United at the outset of the following season.

==International career==
Speed played for Wales at youth level and earned three caps for the under-21 team. He played 85 times for Wales, making him the second highest capped player only behind goalkeeper Neville Southall who made 92 appearances until Speed was surpassed by Chris Gunter in 2018. Speed captained Wales on 44 occasions. His first appearance for the national side had come on 20 May 1990 in a 1–0 friendly win against Costa Rica at Ninian Park as a second-half replacement for Glyn Hodges. He did not score until his 27th cap, a 3–2 away defeat in Moldova in a Euro 1996 qualifier on 12 October 1994. Speed&#x27;s first appearance as captain was during his 46th cap, a 3–0 away win in Malta on 3 June 1998.

Speed broke the record held by Dean Saunders for most caps by a Welsh outfield player when he won his 76th against Finland in a Euro 2004 qualifier on 10 September 2003. He captained the side to a 1–1 draw. Speed retired from international football in 2004 after the side&#x27;s 3–2 defeat to Poland in a 2006 World Cup qualifier.

==Playing style and reputation==
Speed was a versatile player who could play in left midfield, central midfield, and also at left-back, but playing mainly as a left-side attacking midfielder, with a knack for directing powerful headers towards goal. He possessed great tactical awareness, and could both create and score goals. Regularly a captain, he was said by his teammates to have been an &#x27;inspirational figure&#x27; who led by example and demanded the best from those around him.

He was well known as a &#x27;consummate professional&#x27; both on and off the field. Hardworking, honest and self-critical, he was not blessed with exceptional talent at a young age, but instead developed his technique through many hours of hard work on the training field. He had a reputation as an extremely fit footballer who looked after his body. He had a modern approach to diet and fitness, a rare quality amongst players of his generation. His level of fitness allowed him to avoid injury and to continue playing until the age of 39; he rarely missed a game.

He also had a reputation as a friendly and supportive person, who cared for and took an interest in the lives of the people around him; his &#x27;nice guy&#x27; persona made him a popular and well respected figure amongst his peers.

==Managerial career==
===Sheffield United===
With the 2010–11 season only three games old, Sheffield United manager Kevin Blackwell was dismissed with Speed being confirmed as the club&#x27;s new manager on a three-year contract on 17 August 2010. On 21 October 2010, Speed was given a one-game touchline ban and a £22,000 fine by The Football Association for his unsporting behaviour at the home fixture against Watford on 2 October 2010. On 11 December 2010, Speed was linked with the vacant Wales manager job along with John Hartson, Brian Flynn, Chris Coleman and Lars Lagerbäck. Sheffield United confirmed that they had given Speed permission to talk to the Football Association of Wales over the vacant position. With just four months managerial experience, Speed was confirmed as the new Welsh national team manager on 14 December 2010 succeeding John Toshack who had stepped down in September 2010. Sheffield United released Speed from his contract after compensation was paid by the FAW. Former Welsh national team manager Mark Hughes supported the move to appoint Speed, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s got a strong personality, he&#x27;s good with people, (the players) will relate better to Gary than they perhaps did to the previous manager.&quot;

===Wales===
Speed&#x27;s first game as Wales manager was 8 February 2011 in the inaugural Nations Cup, which the Republic of Ireland won 3–0. Speed&#x27;s first competitive match was the Euro 2012 qualifier at home to England 26 March 2011 and Speed appointed twenty-year-old Aaron Ramsey captain, making Ramsey the youngest ever Wales captain. Wales lost to England 2–0, and in August 2011 Wales attained their lowest ever FIFA ranking of 117th. This was followed by a 2–1 home win against Montenegro, a 1–0 away loss to England, a 2–0 home win against Switzerland and a 1–0 away win against Bulgaria. Consequently, in October 2011, Wales were ranked 45th in the world by FIFA. Speed&#x27;s last game as manager of Wales was on 12 November 2011, a 4–1 home win in a friendly match against Norway. On 21 December 2011, the day of the final FIFA rankings of the year, Wales were awarded the title of &#x27;Best Movers&#x27; of the year having gained more ranking points than any other nation in 2011.

==Personal life==
Speed married his fiancée Louise in 1996; the couple had two children, Thomas and Edward.

Outside his football career, Speed was known by friends as a humble and modest person, also echoed by David Moyes. He also took part in charitable works and fighting for footballers&#x27; rights.

Speed was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours for services to football.

In March 2012, Speed&#x27;s elder son, Edward, was selected for the Wales Under-16 squad.

In 2018, seven years after his death, an old letter written by Speed in which he noted being depressed and wishing to sleep and &quot;never wake up&quot; was uncovered by his widow Louise. The letter was addressed to Louise and it was written when Speed was 17 years old.

== Death and legacy ==
On 26 November 2011, Speed appeared as a guest on the BBC One television programme &quot;Football Focus&quot;; presenter Dan Walker later described him as being in &quot;fine form&quot;. After the programme finished at 1 pm, Speed chatted to various other pundits at the MediaCity studios in Salford before joining former Newcastle United teammate Alan Shearer to watch their old club play against Manchester United at Old Trafford, a short walk from the studios across the Manchester Ship Canal. At 5 pm, Speed drove home to Huntington, Cheshire, about an hour&#x27;s drive from Old Trafford.

The following morning, just before 7 am, his wife Louise found his body in the garage of his home. She telephoned the ambulance service at 7:08 a.m. and the police were also informed. They confirmed that he was dead, and announced that they were not treating his death as suspicious. Although the facts were not fully established, it was reported that Speed&#x27;s death had been a suicide. His death was announced to the public by the Football Association of Wales a few hours later. An inquest into Speed&#x27;s death convened on 29 November 2011; it was adjourned until 30 January 2012.

The coroner at the inquest reached a narrative verdict, but that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether it was intentional as he may have intended to make a &quot;dramatic gesture&quot; and then &quot;nodded off to sleep&quot;. The inquest heard that the pressure of management had put some strain on his marriage and that he and Louise had argued the night before his death. However, family friend Alan Shearer had told Speed that such arguments were normal within a long-term relationship, and Louise told the inquest how recent conversations between her and her husband &quot;went on about our future together and how excited he was about our journey together&quot;.

Speed left most of his £1.2 million estate to his wife and the rest to his sons.

As a boy, Speed was coached by Barry Bennell, who was later convicted as a serial child sex offender. In February 2018, after Bennell&#x27;s conviction, an anonymous victim of the coach told Al Jazeera that he had witnessed Speed being abused. However, police twice interviewed Speed during earlier investigations into Bennell&#x27;s behaviour, and he said that he was never harmed by him; the inquest into Speed&#x27;s death found no links to Bennell.

===Tributes===

News of Speed&#x27;s death was first announced by the Football Association of Wales, who extended their sympathies and condolences to Speed&#x27;s family. Throughout the day similar messages were released from many people within football, as well as national figures in Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom. Close friends and former teammates such as Robbie Savage, Ryan Giggs, Simon Grayson, Alan Shearer, Craig Bellamy and John Hartson all expressed their deep sorrow at his death. Many British politicians expressed sadness at Speed&#x27;s death and sent condolences to his family, including Prime Minister David Cameron and Leader of the Opposition Ed Miliband. Among the international figures to pay tribute to Speed was UEFA President Michel Platini. FIFA President Sepp Blatter described Speed as &quot;a model professional and a fantastic ambassador for the game&quot;. Both the FIFA and Welsh flags at FIFA&#x27;s headquarters were at half mast as a mark of respect.

The match between Swansea City and Aston Villa at the Liberty Stadium, held only hours after Speed&#x27;s death was announced, was dedicated to his memory. A minute&#x27;s silence was to be held before the match. However, the fans applauded instead and sang Speed&#x27;s name. Several players who played in the match were severely affected by the news. Four Welsh internationals played in the match; Ashley Williams, Neil Taylor and Joe Allen, of Swansea, all played under Speed for Wales, and Allen in particular was said to be struggling with the news. James Collins was the other Welsh international, and he had also played with Speed at international level. Collins&#x27; Villa teammates Shay Given and Jermaine Jenas had both played with Speed at Newcastle United, and both were badly affected by the news. Given openly wept during and after the minute&#x27;s applause. Both managers, Alex McLeish and Brendan Rodgers, paid tribute to Speed. Rodgers, who had spoken to Speed a lot since he had become Wales manager, said that the game had lost a legend, while Neil Taylor said that he hoped Wales could qualify for the 2014 World Cup to honour him.

Along with this match, several others saw tributes toward Speed. The only other Premier League match played that day was between Liverpool and Manchester City. Craig Bellamy of Liverpool was withdrawn from Liverpool&#x27;s squad by his manager Kenny Dalglish, as he was too affected by the news to play. Bellamy played with Speed for Newcastle United and Wales, where Speed had also been his manager. Dalglish himself had signed Speed for Newcastle, and expressed his sadness at the news, saying that he thought Speed was not only a great footballer but also a great person. Another of Speed&#x27;s former teammates, Hugo Viana, also paid tribute to him. Viana, a Portuguese international played alongside Speed at Newcastle from 2002 to 2004. After his team Braga had lost 3–2 to Porto, Viana displayed a shirt reading &quot;Gary Rest in Peace&quot;.

At Sheffield United there were tributes for the former player, coach and manager before the team&#x27;s home fixture against Torquay United in the FA Cup. Former teammates and colleagues were invited to the match; there was a minute&#x27;s applause before the match; players warmed up in specially designed shirts; players and coaches wore black armbands; the match day programme was dedicated to Speed; Sheffield United captain Chris Morgan and former Sheffield United and Welsh international Rob Page laid wreaths on pitch side just before kick-off. Sheffield United striker Ched Evans, the only player to be managed by Speed at both club and international level, paid tribute to Speed during the match; Evans revealed a message under his shirt after scoring his first goal which read: &quot;Rest in peace Speedo.&quot; Evans stated after the match &quot;I was a man on a mission. I had a message on my top for Gary Speed which I wanted to show. I&#x27;m thankful I got the goal ... The crowd started singing [Speed&#x27;s name], it gave me goose pimples.&quot;

During the following week, tributes were paid to Speed from across the football season. A minute&#x27;s applause was held before the League Cup quarter-final ties, as well as across the Football League midweek matches. Similar events were staged at every Premier League match on the weekend of 4 December, as well as Wales&#x27;s rugby match against Australia at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Speed&#x27;s wife Louise and his two children attended the Football League Championship game at Elland Road between Speed&#x27;s former club Leeds and Millwall, which Leeds won 2–0, and again held a minute&#x27;s applause. Speed&#x27;s fellow midfielders from the 1991–92 title-winning side Gary McAllister, David Batty and Gordon Strachan laid wreaths in his memory. Speed&#x27;s father, Roger, also led a minute&#x27;s tribute at Goodison Park, where Speed&#x27;s former club Everton lost 1–0 to Stoke City. Speed&#x27;s father and sons were again present a week later at the Reebok Stadium, as another of his son&#x27;s former teams Bolton Wanderers lost 2–1 to Aston Villa.

On 4 January, the Football Association of Wales announced that a match in Speed&#x27;s memory would be played on 29 February at Cardiff City Stadium. The friendly international against Costa Rica commemorated Speed&#x27;s debut for Wales, in which Costa Rica were beaten 1–0. The memorial match saw Costa Rica win by the same score.

On 25 September 2012, Everton visited Leeds United in the League Cup. Starting from the 11th minute of the fixture, both sets of supporters chanted Speed&#x27;s name for 11 minutes.

===Funeral===
Speed&#x27;s funeral, attended by around 250 members of his family and close friends, took place in the village of Hawarden on 9 December 2011. In keeping with his wife Louise&#x27;s wishes, only small crowds gathered on the main road outside St Deiniol&#x27;s Church and no members of the press were admitted. Speed was later cremated in Pentre Bychan Crematorium, Wrexham.

===Impact on Welsh football===
Speed&#x27;s work to improve the professional standard of the Football Association of Wales, including improvements to training facilities, team culture, and its national visibility, was credited as a major contributor to the success that Wales would enjoy in the decade after his death, beginning with their qualification for Euro 2016 and culminating in their appearance at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, bringing to an end a 64-year drought at the World Cup. His memory became part of &quot;the sense of collective purpose&quot; of the organization. On the eve of the Qatar World Cup, Speed&#x27;s former teammate Neville Southall wrote that the biggest difference between the Welsh squad that had qualified and those that came before started &quot;with a single word: belief,&quot; and that &quot;for the initial source of the belief, though, you have to go back to my old mate Gary Speed. Gary had a burning ambition to take Wales into a tournament and, in his time as manager, he made players believe in themselves.&quot; Wales captain Gareth Bale paid tribute to Speed on the occasion, saying &quot;Gary Speed&#x27;s vision was to grow the FAW, not just the football, but the infrastructure: building a training base, having a high-performance centre and recovery centre, just like a top club,&quot; adding &quot;I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s looking down on us with a big smile and happy that Welsh football is in a great place.&quot;

<doc id="1312030" wikidata="Q780834" url="?curid=1312030" title="Roy Clarke">
<text>Royston Clarke (born 28 January 1930) is an English comedy writer, best known for creating the sitcoms &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;, &quot;Open All Hours&quot; and its sequel series, &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot;.

==Early life==
Clarke was born in Austerfield, then in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was, in the words of his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry, educated &quot;badly during World War II&quot;. His jobs before becoming a writer included a teacher, a policeman, a taxi driver and a salesman, in addition to being a soldier in the Royal Corps of Signals of the British Army.

==Career==
In the late 1960s, Clarke wrote thrillers for BBC Radio. The first in January 1968, &quot;The 17-Jewelled Shockproof Swiss-Made Bomb&quot;, featured Peter Coke, Ben Kingsley, Bob Grant and Anne Stallybrass. A couple of months later, Clarke wrote &quot;The Events at Black Tor&quot;, which was a police thriller which also featured Bob Grant, along with James Beck.

Clarke was the sole writer of the long-running &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, which at its peak had an audience of over 18 million viewers. It featured Bill Owen, Peter Sallis, Brian Wilde, Kathy Staff and Dame Thora Hird in leading roles. While Clarke was not involved in casting, he wrote the character named Clegg with Sallis specifically in mind.
Clarke also wrote a prequel to the series, &quot;First of the Summer Wine&quot;. 

Other credits are: &quot;The Misfit&quot;, starring Ronald Fraser; &quot;Open All Hours&quot;, starring Ronnie Barker and David Jason; &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;, starring Patricia Routledge; &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;.&quot; He created and wrote the short-lived fantasy drama, &quot;&quot;The Wanderer&quot;&quot; starring Bryan Brown, for Sky One.
In 1974, he created the sitcom &quot;Oh No It&#x27;s Selwyn Froggitt&quot; from an idea by its star Bill Maynard. He wrote the pilot episode, but left to be replaced by Alan Plater when the programme went to series. &quot;Rosie&quot; with Paul Greenwood was broadcast from 1977 to 1981.

Clarke has worked in film, penning the screenplay to &quot;Hawks&quot; (1988). He also wrote the well-received drama &quot;A Foreign Field&quot; (1993).

In 1994, Clarke was granted the Freedom of the Borough of Doncaster; the highest honour the Council can bestow.
In 2002, he received an OBE for his contribution to British comedy.

In 2003, Clarke adapted his &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; chronicle &quot;The Moonbather&quot; for a world premiere performance at the Scunthorpe Little Theatre Club.

He was awarded the lifetime achievement award at the 2010 British Comedy Awards.

In 2013, he resurrected &quot;Open All Hours&quot; for a sequel series, &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot; starring David Jason. Six series were broadcast.

In 2016, he created a prequel to &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; titled &quot;Young Hyacinth&quot;. The one-off episode premiered on 2 September 2016 on BBC One.

==Personal life==

Clarke resided in rural Goole in the East Riding of Yorkshire with his wife, Enid Kitching. For some years he owned Horton Rounds in Northamptonshire, a Grade II listed house designed by the Northamptonshire architect Arthur A. J. Marshman.

<text>&#x27;Isabel&#x27; is a female name of Spanish origin. Isabelle is a name that is similar, but it is of French origin. It originates as the medieval Spanish form of &quot;Elisabeth&quot; (ultimately Hebrew &quot;Elisheba&quot;). Arising in the 12th century, it became popular in England in the 13th century following the marriage of Isabella of Angoulême to the king of England. Today it is sometimes abbreviated to Isa.

==Etymology==
This set of names is a Spanish variant of the Hebrew name Elisheba through Latin and Greek represented in English and other European languages as Elisabeth. These names are derived from the Latin and Greek renderings of the Hebrew name based on both etymological and contextual evidence (the use of Isabel as a translation of the name of the mother of John the Baptist). The variant form originated through the loss of the first syllable through rebracketing and the replacement of final with (as does not appear word-finally in standard Spanish). Elisabeth was understood in Spain as a name with the masculine definite article &quot;el&quot; &quot;the&quot;, that is to say &quot;*El Isabeth&quot;, from it, the short form &quot;*Isabeth&quot; where the final &quot;-el&quot; was substituted to &quot;-eth&quot;, both for aesthetical reasons or feminization, or the entire syllable &quot;-bel&quot; was substituted to &quot;-beth&quot;, by analogy with &quot;bella&quot; &quot;pretty, beautiful&quot;.

<text>Salty liquorice, salmiak liquorice or salmiac liquorice, is a variety of liquorice flavoured with salmiak salt (sal ammoniac; ammonium chloride), and is a common confection found in the Nordic countries, Benelux, and northern Germany. Salmiak salt gives salty liquorice an astringent, salty taste, akin to that of tannins—a characteristic of red wines, which adds bitterness and astringency to the flavour. Consuming salmiak liquorice can stimulate either a savoury or non-savoury palate and response. Anise oil can also be an additional main ingredient in salty liquorice. Extra-salty liquorice is additionally coated with salmiak salt or salmiak powder, or sometimes table salt.

Salty liquorice candy and pastilles are almost always black or very dark brown and can range from soft candy to hard pastille variety, and sometimes hard brittle. The other colours used are white and variants of grey. Salty liquorice or salmiak is also used as a flavouring in other products, such as ice creams, syrups, chewing gum, snus and alcoholic beverages.

==History==
Sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) has a history of being used as a cough medicine, as it works as an expectorant. Finnish author Jukka Annala speculates that salty liquorice has its origins in pharmacy stores that manufactured their own cough medicine. Where and when ammonium chloride and liquorice were first combined to produce salty liquorice is unclear, but by the 1930s it was produced in Finland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands as a pastille.

==Types==
Different languages often refer to salty liquorice as either &quot;salmiak liquorice&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Salmiaklakrits&quot;; Danish: &quot;Salmiaklakrids&quot;), or simply &quot;salt liquorice&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Saltlakrits&quot;; Danish: &quot;Saltlakrids&quot;). The Dutch refer to it as &quot;zoute drop&quot; or &quot;dubbelzoute drop&quot; (double salted liquorice). In Germany, they are commonly known as salt liquorice (&quot;Salzlakritz&quot;) candy and salmiak pastilles (&quot;Salmiakpastillen&quot;) or simply Salmiak, in contrast to sweet liquorice (&quot;Süßlakritz&quot;) candy. A traditional shape for salty liquorice pastilles is a black diamond-shaped lozenge. In Finnish, it is known as &quot;salmiakki&quot;.

The strength of the confectionery depends on the amount of food grade ammonium chloride (salmiak salt) used, which varies by country and what&#x27;s considered a safe amount. In Sweden, for example, the most popular types of salty liquorice contain an average of 7% of ammonium chloride. In 2012, there was a European Union proposal to limit the amount to 0.3%, which was met with wide opposition. Although the European Union now regulates the use of ammonium chloride to 0.3% in most foodstuffs, there is no specific restriction for it in liquorice or ice cream. At a level of up to 7.99% ammonium chloride, salmiak pastilles are considered a &quot;traditionally-applied medicine to assist expectoration in the airways&quot;.

An antibacterial effect can be attributed to the neutralization of the slightly acidic ammonium chloride (pH about 5.5) by the relatively alkaline saliva (pH about 7), whereby ammonia is released, which has a disinfecting effect:

==Health and safety==
===Germany and European Union===
Before implementation of the current European Union community-wide list of permitted flavouring substances used in food, national food legislation in Germany required that a content from above 2% ammonium chloride (salmiak salt) in salty liquorice, was required to carry the label &quot;Adult Liquorice - Not Children&#x27;s Liquorice&quot; (&quot;Erwachsenenlakritz - Kein Kinderlakritz&quot;) on packaging in Germany. When the ingredient content of ammonium chloride (salmiak salt) was between 4.49% and 7.99%, the declaration &quot;extra strong&quot; (&quot;extra stark&quot;) was also required on packaging. More than 7.99% of ammonium chloride (salmiak salt) was not permitted in Germany at that point in time. Since then, the upper limit on ammonium chloride has been lifted.

==Other uses==
In addition to being used in candy, salmiak is also used to flavour vodka, chocolate, distilled rye brandy, ice cream, cola drinks, snus, and meat.

<text>Gerald is a masculine given name derived from the Germanic languages prefix &quot;ger-&quot; (&quot;spear&quot;) and suffix &quot;-wald&quot; (&quot;rule&quot;). Gerald is a Norman French variant of the Germanic name. An Old English equivalent name was Garweald, the likely original name of Gerald of Mayo, a British Roman Catholic monk who established a monastery in Mayo, Ireland  in 670. Nearly two centuries later, Gerald of Aurillac, a French count, took a vow of celibacy and later became known as the Roman Catholic patron saint of bachelors. The name was in regular use during the Middle Ages but declined after 1300 in England. It remained a common name in Ireland, where it was a common name among the powerful FitzGerald dynasty. The name was revived in the Anglosphere in the 19th century by writers of historical novels along with other names that had been popular in the medieval era. British novelist Ann Hatton published a novel called &quot;Gerald Fitzgerald&quot; in 1831. Author Dorothea Grubb published her novel &quot;Gerald Fitzgerald&quot; in 1845, and Irish author Charles Lever published his novel, also entitled &quot;Gerald Fitzgerald&quot;, in 1859. The name had strong associations with Ireland in English-speaking countries. In the United States, it increased in use for boys after 1910 and peaked in use in 1939, when it was the 19th most popular name given to American boys. Jerry is the usual short form of the name. Variants include the English given name Jerrold, the feminine nickname Jeri and the Welsh language Gerallt and Irish language Gearalt. Gerald is less common as a surname. The name is also found in French as Gérald. Geraldine is the feminine equivalent.

<text>Ludvig Immanuel Nobel ( ; ; ; 27 July 1831 – 12 April 1888) was a Swedish-Russian engineer, a noted businessman and a humanitarian. One of the most prominent members of the Nobel family, he was the son of Immanuel Nobel (also an engineering pioneer) and Andriette Nobel, and the older brother of Alfred Nobel (founder of the Nobel Prize). With his brother Robert, he operated Branobel, an oil company in Baku (now in Azerbaijan) which at one point produced 50% of the world&#x27;s oil. 

He is credited with creating the Russian oil industry. Ludvig Nobel built the largest fortune of any of the Nobel brothers and was one of the world&#x27;s richest men. Following the Bolshevik revolution, the communists confiscated the Nobel family&#x27;s vast fortune in Russia.

==Early history==
Nobel was born in Stockholm. At 28 years old, he was given by his father&#x27;s creditors the technical management of the family business, Fonderies et Ateliers Mécaniques Nobel Fils, a factory making war supplies such as mines and steam engines. The company had been facing financial difficulties since the end of the Crimean War in 1856 due to a severe cut in the military budget ordered by the new Tsar Alexander II, and eventually, in 1862, Immanuel&#x27;s firm was sold by his creditors.

With some funds he had managed to save, Ludvig opened a new firm, the Machine-Building Factory Ludvig Nobel. Initially producing chilled cast-iron shells, the factory became in a few years one of the largest producers of gun carriages of Russia.
==Early success in Russia==
While running the factory in St. Petersburg, Ludvig obtained a large contract to manufacture rifles for the Russian government and he needed wood for the rifle stocks. He sent his oldest brother, Robert Nobel in 1873 to procure Russian walnut wood in the Caucasus region of southern Russia. Without consulting his brother, Robert spent the 25,000 rubbles that Ludvig entrusted to him for buying wood – &quot;walnut money&quot; – and instead bought a small refinery in Baku. Ludvig sent additional funds to Robert to invest in modernisation and refinery efficiency. By 1876, the Nobel brothers established themselves as the most competent refiner in Baku and Batumi and sent the first shipment of illuminating oil to St. Petersburg. By 1879, Ludvig turned the initial business into a shareholding company, Branobel, of which he was the major shareholder and had as partners his brothers Robert and Alfred Nobel.

==Inventions==
Ludvig Nobel invented oil tankers, and better refineries, pipelines. Before 1880 the United States was Russia&#x27;s teacher in most aspects of the oil business. The roles were reversed in some respects by Nobel. A Batumi oil refinery plant was constructed 1927-1929, in order to refine the oil brought from Baku]] at the Caspian Sea to Batumi at the Black Sea by pipeline. The oil business lacked technical know-how and scientific methodology. To rectify this, Nobel established technical chemical research labs in Baku. These research centers were very active and when something of commercial interest was found, Nobel was fast in trying the new products out on a large scale. Dozens of scientists were employed, finding ways to treat oil, developing new uses for oil, and developing products derived from oil. 

Nobel was the first to experiment with carrying oil in bulk on single-hulled barges. Turning his attention to self-propelled tankships, a primary concern was to keep the cargo and fumes well away from the engine room to avoid fires. Other challenges included allowing for the cargo to expand and contract due to temperature changes, and providing a method to ventilate the tanks.
The world&#x27;s first successful oil tanker was Nobel&#x27;s &quot;Zoroaster&quot;. He designed this in Lindholmen-Motala in Sweden with Sven Alexander Almqvist. Together they solved the issue of putting oil in the bulk of a ship without it getting unstable, through putting the oil in tanks The contract to build it was signed January 1878, and it made its first run later that year from Baku to Astrakhan. The design was widely studied and copied, with Nobel refusing to patent any part of it. In October 1878, he ordered two more tankers of the same design: the &quot;Buddha&quot; and the &quot;Nordenskjöld&quot;. The first tank steamer of the United States was built after drawings and calculations of Nobel after his 1888 death in Cannes.

==Humanitarian efforts==
Nobel was a strong humanitarian as well as a businessman, full of ideas and visions. He introduced profit sharing and worked actively to improve working conditions in his factories. His humanity and social approach was unique for the time. In 1885 he started a cooperative bank, sparkasse, for the workers. In Baku, social areas were built for the workers like dining rooms, billiard rooms, libraries and conference rooms where speeches and discussions were held. Near his estate, Villa Petrolea, several houses for the workers were built and a shuttle boat was offered between the city and the harbour. The company donated funds to schools and ran a hospital. Ludvig and Robert created a large park, still existent, in the &quot;Black City&quot; section of Baku near Villa Petrolea.

<text>Pathway to Glory is a tactical turn-based game for the Nokia N-Gage, by Nokia and Ubisoft RedLynx, released in late 2004.

==Story==
In the summer of 1943, special forces are urgently needed in the struggle for Europe. The player commands a multinational unit of highly trained men and accomplishes action-packed, historical missions by defending, ambushing, destroying and attacking.

&quot;Pathway to Glory&quot; can be played in single-player and multiplayer mode, using either hotseat, N-Gage Arena or a local Bluetooth connection.

==Reception==
The game received 83/100 reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Gamespot nominated Pathway to Glory as the Best of E3 2004, the best N-Gage Game: &quot;Pathway to Glory is our N-Gage Best of E3 pick because it offers a cohesive, refined, and original take on the strategy genre. The fact that Nokia appears to be pulling it off on a developing, port-laden platform makes the achievement all the more impressive.&quot;

==Sequel==
A sequel for &quot;Pathway to Glory&quot; was announced during E3 2005, titled Pathway to Glory: Ikusa Islands. It was released in 2005.

<doc id="1312086" wikidata="Q1130019" url="?curid=1312086" title="Kremlin Wall Necropolis">
<text>The Kremlin Wall Necropolis is the former national cemetery of the Soviet Union, located in Red Square in Moscow beside the Kremlin Wall. Burials there began in November 1917, when 240 pro-Bolsheviks who died during the Moscow Bolshevik Uprising were buried in mass graves. The improvised burial site gradually transformed into the centerpiece of military and civilian honor during the Second World War. It is centered on Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum, initially built in wood in 1924 and rebuilt in granite in 1929–30. After the last mass burial in Red Square in 1921, funerals there were usually conducted as state ceremonies and reserved as the final honor for highly venerated politicians, military leaders, cosmonauts, and scientists. In 1925–1927, burials in the ground were stopped; funerals were now conducted as burials of cremated ash in the Kremlin wall itself. Burials in the ground resumed with Mikhail Kalinin&#x27;s funeral in 1946.

The Kremlin Wall was the &quot;de facto&quot; resting place of the Soviet Union&#x27;s deceased national icons. Burial there was a status symbol among Soviet citizens. The practice of burying dignitaries at Red Square ended with the funeral of General Secretary Konstantin Chernenko in March 1985. The Kremlin Wall Necropolis was designated a protected landmark in 1974. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, citizens of the Russian Federation and many other former post-Soviet states continue to pay their respects to the national heroes at the Kremlin Wall.

==Site==
The eastern segment of the Kremlin wall, and Red Square behind it, emerged on its present site in the 15th century, during the reign of Ivan III; the wall and the square were separated with a wide defensive moat filled with water diverted from the Neglinnaya River. The moat was lined with a secondary fortress wall, and spanned by three bridges connecting the Kremlin to the posad. From 1707–08 Peter the Great, expecting a Swedish incursion deep into the Russian mainland, restored the moat around the Kremlin, cleared Red Square and built earthen fortifications around Nikolskaya and Spasskaya towers. From 1776 to 1787, Matvey Kazakov built the Kremlin Senate that today provides a backdrop for the present-day Necropolis.

Throughout the 18th century the unused, neglected fortifications deteriorated and were not properly repaired until the 1801 coronation of Alexander I. In one season the moat with bridges and adjacent buildings was replaced with a clean span of paved square. More reconstruction followed in the 19th century. The stretch of Kremlin wall south from Senate Tower was badly damaged in 1812 by the explosion at the Kremlin Arsenal set off by the retreating French troops. Nikolskaya tower lost its gothic crown which was erected in 1807–1808; Arsenalnaya tower developed deep cracks, leading to Joseph Bove proposing in 1813 the outright demolition of the towers to prevent the wall&#x27;s imminent collapse. Eventually, the main structures of the towers were deemed sound enough to be left in place, and were topped with new tented roofs designed by Bove. Peter&#x27;s bastions were razed (creating space for nearby Alexander Garden and Theatre Square), The Kremlin wall facing Red Square was rebuilt shallower than before, and acquired its present shape in the 1820s.

==Burials from 1917 to 1927==

Between the 1917 October Revolution and June 1927, the area outside the Kremlin wall between the Senate and Nikolskaya towers was used for mass and individual burials of people who had to some extent contributed to the socialist revolution or the Bolshevik cause. This included ordinary soldiers killed in battle, victims of the Civil War, militia men fallen while fighting anti-Bolsheviks and noted Bolshevik politicians, as well as individuals associated with creating the new Soviet society. Burial plots of the 1917–1927 period are currently organized into 15 landscaped grave sites with the names of the buried inscribed on black marble tablets.

===Mass graves of 1917===
In July 1917, hundreds of soldiers of the Russian Northern Front were arrested for mutiny and desertion and locked up in Daugavpils (then Dvinsk) fortress. Later, 869 Dvinsk inmates were transported to Moscow. Here, the jailed soldiers launched a hunger strike; public support for them threatened to develop into a citywide riot. On 22 September, 593 inmates were released; the rest were left behind bars until the October Revolution. The released soldiers, collectively called &quot;Dvintsy&quot;, stayed in the city as a cohesive unit, based in Zamoskvorechye District and openly hostile to the ruling Provisional Government. Immediately after the October Revolution in Saint Petersburg, &quot;Dvintsy&quot; became the strike force of the Bolsheviks in Moscow. Late at night on 27–28 October, a detachment of approximately two hundred men marching north to Tverskaya Street confronted the loyalist forces near the State Historical Museum on Red Square. During the fighting, 70 of the &quot;Dvintsy&quot;, including their company commander, Sapunov, were killed at the barricades.

The following day, loyalists led by Colonel Konstantin Ryabtsev succeeded in taking over the Kremlin. They gunned down the surrendered Red soldiers at the Kremlin Arsenal wall. More Red soldiers were killed as the Bolsheviks stormed the Kremlin, finally taking control on the night of 2–3 November. Street fighting tapered off after claiming nearly a thousand lives, and on 4 November the new Bolshevik administration decreed their dead would be buried at Red Square next to the Kremlin Wall, where indeed most of them were killed.
Voices reached us across the immense place, and the sound of picks and shovels. We crossed over. Mountains of dirt and rock were piled high near the base of the wall. Climbing these we looked down into two massive pits, ten or fifteen feet deep and fifty yards long, where hundreds of soldiers and workers were digging in the light of huge fires. A young student spoke to us in German. &quot;The Brotherhood Grave&quot;, he explained.
– John Reed, &quot;Ten Days that Shook the World&quot;.
A total of 238 dead were buried in the mass graves between Senate and Nikolskaya towers in a public funeral on November 10 (John Reed incorrectly mentions 500); two more victims were buried on the 14 and 17 of November. The youngest, Pavel Andreyev, was 14 years old. Of 240 pro-revolution martyrs of the October–November fighting, only 20, including 12 of the Dvintsy, are identified in the official listing of the Moscow Heritage Commission. As of March 2009, three Moscow streets are still named after these individual victims, as well as Dvintsev Street named after the &quot;Dvintsy&quot; force.

The loyalists secured a permit to publicly bury their dead on 13 November. This funeral started at the old Moscow State University building near Kremlin; thirty-seven dead were interred at the Vsekhsvyatskoye Cemetery (now demolished) in the then-suburban Sokol District.

===Burials of 1918–1927===

Mass and individual burials in the ground under the Kremlin wall continued until the funeral of Pyotr Voykov in June 1927. In the first years of the Soviet regime, the honor of being buried on Red Square was extended to ordinary soldiers, Civil War victims, and Moscow militia men killed in clashes with anti-Bolsheviks (March–April 1918). In January 1918, the Red Guards buried the victims of a terrorist bombing in Dorogomilovo. In the same January White Guards fired on a pro-Bolshevik street rally; the eight victims were also buried under the Kremlin wall.

The largest single burial occurred in 1919. On 25 September, anarchists led by former socialist revolutionary Donat Cherepanov set off an explosion in a Communist Party school building in Leontyevsky Lane when Moscow party chief Vladimir Zagorsky was speaking to students. Twelve people, including Zagorsky, were killed and buried in a mass grave on Red Square.

Another unusual incident was the 24 July 1921 crash of the Aerowagon, an experimental (and not fully tested) high-speed railcar fitted with an aircraft engine and propeller traction. On the day of the crash, it delivered a group of Soviet and foreign communists led by Fyodor Sergeyev to the Tula collieries, but on the return trip to Moscow, the &quot;aerowagon&quot; derailed at high speed, killing 7 of the 22 people on board, including its inventor Valerian Abakovsky. This was the last mass burial in the ground of Red Square.

Yakov Sverdlov, who died in 1919, allegedly from the Spanish flu, was buried in an individual grave near the Senate tower. This area would later include eleven more individual graves of top-ranking Soviet leaders (see Individual tombs section). Sverdlov was followed by John Reed, Inessa Armand, Viktor Nogin and other notable Bolsheviks and their foreign allies. Interment in the Kremlin wall, apart from its location next to the seat of government, was also seen as a statement of atheism, while burial in the ground at a traditional cemetery next to a church was deemed inappropriate for a Bolshevik. For the same reason, cremation, then prohibited by the Russian Orthodox Church, was preferred to burial in a coffin and favored by Lenin and Trotsky – though Lenin expressed the wish to be buried next to his mother in St. Petersburg. The new government had sponsored the construction of crematoria since 1919, but the first burial of cremated remains in a niche in the wall did not take place until 1925.

==Mausoleum, 1924–1961==
Vladimir Lenin died of a stroke on 21 January 1924. While his body lay in state in the Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions, the Politburo discussed ways to preserve it, initially for forty days, despite objections from his widow and siblings. Joseph Stalin gave instructions to install a vault for Lenin&#x27;s embalmed remains inside the Kremlin wall, and on 27 January, Lenin&#x27;s casket was deposited in a temporary wooden vault built in a single day. The first proper Mausoleum was built of wood in March–July 1924 and officially opened on August 1 (foreign visitors were allowed inside on August 3). The contest to design and build a new, permanent, Mausoleum was announced in April 1926; construction of Alexey Shchusev&#x27;s winning design began in July 1929 and was completed in sixteen months. The Mausoleum has since functioned as a government reviewing stand during public parades.

The glass sarcophagus of Lenin&#x27;s tomb was twice vandalized by visitors, in 1959 and 1969, leading to installation of a bulletproof glass shell. It was bombed twice, in 1963, when the terrorist was the sole victim, and in 1973, when an explosion killed the terrorist and two bystanders.

The Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia has petitioned Russia to dismantle the cult of personality and bury Lenin&#x27;s body, seeking to &quot;rid Red Square of the remains of the main persecutor and executioner of the 20th century,&quot; although the Russian Orthodox Church demurs.

As of 2022, Lenin&#x27;s body remains in the Mausoleum, excluding the period of evacuation to Tyumen during 1941–1945.

=== Stalin&#x27;s body ===
Two days after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death, the Politburo decreed that his remains would be placed on display in the Mausoleum; it officially reopened in November 1953 with Lenin and Stalin side by side. Another plan decreed in March 1953, but never implemented, called for construction of a Pantheon in which the bodies of Lenin and Stalin would be eventually relocated. Eight years later, following the de-Stalinization of the Khrushchev Thaw, removal of Stalin&#x27;s body from the Mausoleum was unanimously sanctioned by the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party. On 31 October 1961, the Mausoleum was quickly covered with plywood. Red Square itself was closed as a matter of routine, in preparation for the 7 November parade. Stalin&#x27;s remains were quickly re-interred in a deep grave, lined with concrete blocks, behind the Mausoleum; the ceremony was attended only by the state commission led by Nikolay Shvernik. Harold Skilling, who visited the Mausoleum in November of the same year, noted that &quot;everyone was so curious to see the new grave of Stalin... Unlike others, his [grave] was not yet graced by a bust and was marked only by a tablet with the name I.V. Stalin and dates of birth and death&quot;. The existing tomb of Stalin carved by Nikolai Tomsky was installed in June 1970.

==Ashes, 1925–1984==

The first person to be cremated and interred in an urn in the Kremlin wall, 45-year-old former People&#x27;s Commissar of Finance Miron Vladimirov, died in Italy in March 1925. The procedure for dealing with human remains in an urn was still unfamiliar at the time, and Vladimirov&#x27;s urn was carried to his grave in an ordinary coffin.

Between 1925 and the opening of the Donskoye Cemetery crematorium in October 1927, interments in the wall and burials in the ground coexisted together; the former was preferred for foreign dignitaries of the Comintern (Jenő Landler, Bill Haywood, Arthur MacManus, Charles Ruthenberg) while the latter was granted only to top Party executives (Mikhail Frunze, Felix Dzerzhinsky, Nariman Narimanov and Pyotr Voykov).

Initially, the bodies of the deceased were laid in state in the Kremlin&#x27;s halls, but with the tightening of security in the late 1920s, the official farewell station was relocated to the House of the Unions&#x27; &quot;Pillar Hall&quot; on Okhotny Ryad (where Lenin lay in state in 1924) and remained there until the end of the Soviet state. Burials initially took place to the north of the Senate tower, switching to the south side in 1934 and returning to the north side in 1977 (with a few exceptions). Interments in the wall were strictly individual; spouses and children of those interred in the wall had to be buried elsewhere. There were only three instances of group burials: the three-man crew of the Osoaviakhim-1 high-altitude balloon in 1934, the crew of a MiG-15UTI crash in 1968 (Gagarin and Seryogin), and the three-man crew of the Soyuz 11 spacecraft in 1971. In total, the wall accommodates the graves of 107 men and 8 women. No remains interred in the wall were ever removed from it, including those of the people posthumously accused of &quot;fascist conspiracy&quot; (Sergei Kamenev) or political repressions (Andrey Vyshinsky).

Under Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev, the honor of interment in the Kremlin wall was awarded posthumously by the Politburo. When members of the Politburo were not available immediately, Mikhail Suslov had the first call. Brezhnev overruled Suslov&#x27;s decision at least once, voting to bury Semyon Budenny in an individual grave. There were also at least two known cases when groups of professionals pressed the government to extend special honors to their deceased colleagues:
* In June 1962, following the death of Army General Andrey Khrulyov, a group of marshals pressed the Politburo to bury Khrulyov in the Kremlin wall. Normally, generals of his rank were not entitled to this honor; Khrushchev was known to dislike Khrulyov and suggested burying him in Novodevichy Cemetery. The military prevailed, and Khrulyov was buried on Red Square.
* In January 1970 the official decision to bury Pavel Belyayev in Novodevichy Cemetery, already made public through newspapers, was confronted by fellow cosmonauts Valentina Tereshkova, Alexei Leonov, and Vladimir Shatalov who insisted that Belyaev deserved a place in the Kremlin wall like Yuri Gagarin. According to Nikolai Kamanin&#x27;s diaries, the cosmonauts, Shatalov in particular, pressed the issue despite knowing that the decision was made by Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin and that the funeral commission would not dare to challenge it. Belyaev was buried as planned in Novodevichy. According to an alternative version of events, the choice of Novodevichy was decided by his widow&#x27;s will before the official decision was published.
* In September 1971, Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s family requested that the Soviet government bury Khrushchev in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. The Soviet government declined the offer; instead, Khrushchev was given a private state funeral and buried in Novodevichy Cemetery. 
* In December 1971, Andrey Andreyevich Andreyev was buried in Novodevichy Cemetery. According to former Soviet Chairman Anastas Mikoyan, this was because Andrey Andreyev wanted to be buried next to his wife there.
* In July 1989, Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko was offered a grave in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, but at the request of his family he was not buried near the Moscow Kremlin Wall but instead at the Novodevichy Cemetery.
* In September 2022, Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, was buried in Novodevichy Cemetery. Even though Gorbachev was granted approval by Russian presidents Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin to be buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, Gorbachev was buried in Novodevichy Cemetery in the same grave as his wife Raisa, as requested by his will.

On 26 April 1967, cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov, who had died in the crash of his Soyuz 1 space capsule, was given a state funeral in Moscow, and his ashes were interred in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Komarov was posthumously awarded the Order of Lenin (for the second time) and the order of Hero of the Soviet Union.

The last person to be buried in the Kremlin wall was Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov in December 1984.

==Individual tombs, 1919–1985==
The row of individual tombs behind the Mausoleum began to acquire its present shape after the end of World War II. Sergei Merkurov created the first five tombs, for the recently deceased Mikhail Kalinin and Andrey Zhdanov, as well as for Yakov Sverdlov, Mikhail Frunze and Felix Dzerzhinsky who had died decades earlier. Grey granite stands that separate Red Square from the wall were built in the same period. In 1947 Merkurov proposed rebuilding the Mausoleum into a sort of &quot;Pergamon Altar&quot; that would become a foreground to a statue of Stalin placed atop Senatskaya tower. Dmitry Chechulin, Vera Mukhina and others spoke against the proposal and it was soon dropped.

There are, in total, twelve individual tombs; all, including the four burials of the 1980s, are shaped similar to the canonical Merkurov&#x27;s model. All twelve are considered to have died of natural causes, although some, such as Frunze, had unusual circumstances associated with their deaths. Konstantin Chernenko, who died in March 1985, became the last person to be buried on Red Square. Former head of state Andrei Gromyko, who died in July 1989, was offered burial in the Necropolis near his predecessors but was eventually buried at the Novodevichy cemetery at the request of his family.

The Kremlin wall and the stands erected in the 1940s were traditionally separated with a line of &quot;blue spruce&quot; (Picea pungens), a tree not occurring naturally in Russia. In August–September 2007 the aging trees, with few exceptions, were cut down and replaced with young trees. A Federal Protective Service spokesman explained that the previous generation of spruce, planted in the 1970s, suffered from the dryness of the urban landscape; 28 old but sound trees were handpicked for replanting inside the Kremlin. New trees were selected from the nurseries of Altai Mountains, Russian Far East and &quot;some foreign countries&quot;. The FPS spokesman also mentioned that in Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s period there were plans to plant a fruit garden around the Mausoleum, but the proposal was rejected in fear of fruit flies.

==Debate and preservation==

Public discussion on closing the Mausoleum emerged shortly after the breakup of the Soviet Union, with opinions ranging from simply burying Lenin in Saint Petersburg as he had requested, to taking the mummy on a commercial world tour. After the climax of the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, President Boris Yeltsin removed the honor guard from the Mausoleum (former &quot;Post no.1&quot;, see Kremlin Regiment) and voiced his opinion that Lenin should eventually be buried in the ground. The decision was supported by the Public Committee of Democratic Organisations. By 1995, Yeltsin had &quot;moved to the nationalist center&quot;, using the Mausoleum as a government stand like previous state leaders; in 1997, he reiterated the claim to bury Lenin.

Proposals to remove the Necropolis from Red Square altogether met with far more public opposition and did not come to fruition either. Despite the Russian government&#x27;s efforts to relocate Lenin&#x27;s tomb and Soviet monuments from the Kremlin, support of both Lenin and the Soviet Union remained steadfast among the Russian populace. Public opinion on preserving the remains of Lenin in their embalmed state was split but leaned towards burial. A late 2008 VTsIOM poll found that 66% of the respondents supported a funeral in a traditional cemetery, including 28% of those who believed that the funeral should be postponed until the communist generation passes away. 25% of the respondents thought the body should be preserved in the Mausoleum. In October 2005, 51% of respondents had expressed support for a funeral and 40% for preservation.

<doc id="1312106" wikidata="Q158357" url="?curid=1312106" title="Marks, Russia">
<text>Marks (), also spelled Marx, named after Karl Marx, is a town in Saratov Oblast, Russia, located northeast of Saratov, the administrative center of the oblast. Population: 

It was previously known as &quot;Baronsk&quot;, &quot;Katharinenstadt&quot; (until 1920), &quot;Marxstadt&quot; (until 1941).

==History==
It was founded in 1767 as a Volga German community called Baronsk (), named so because the Dutchman Ferdinand Baron Caneau de Beauregard, who was a baron, founded the city. It was soon renamed Katharinenstadt (; Yekaterinenshtadt, Jekaterinenstadt; 1915 - 1920 Yekaterinograd), after Catherine the Great. In 1918, it was granted town status and was the location for the administration of the Labour Commune of Volga Germans. It was renamed Marxstadt in 1919 (; Marksshtadt), after Karl Marx. In 1941, during the resettlement of Germans, the town was given its present name.
==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Marks serves as the administrative center of Marksovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as Marks Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Marks Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated within Marksovsky Municipal District as Marks Urban Settlement.

<text>Floriana Football Club is a Maltese professional football club in the town of Floriana that currently plays in the Maltese Premier League. Considered one of the most supported and successful clubs in Maltese football, Floriana has won 26 national leagues and 21 FA trophies. It is also the only team from Malta to have qualified from the qualifying rounds to the first round proper of the UEFA Champions League, in the 1993–94 season.

==History==
Floriana Football Club was founded in 1894 with the inauguration of the football ground officiated by Queen Alexandra. The site was a cricket ground from 1890 until its conversion project. Together with St. George&#x27;s FC, is one of the two oldest clubs in Malta. During that period, football in Malta was introduced by the British Servicemen who were stationed on the island, which was then a colony of the British Empire.

The club is affiliated to the Malta Football Association which in turn is a member of both UEFA and FIFA. The team&#x27;s colours were green and red but after a friendly match against the Royal Dublin Fusiliers which plays in green and white, Floriana FC changed its colours to green and white. The team&#x27;s nicknames are: Tal-Irish and Greens.

Floriana Football Club has won the major Maltese League championship 26 times and the FA Trophy 20 times.

===Formation===
Football was introduced in Malta at the end of the 19th century by the British troops stationed on the island. At that time Malta formed part of the British Empire and, the Island was the base of British forces in the heart of the Mediterranean. The forces&#x27; barracks, which were strategically located around the island of Malta, enjoyed large areas that were used as parade grounds, training areas and for sporting activities.

The sports practised by the soldiers were mainly cricket, hockey and football. The British forces in Malta were mainly stationed in Floriana, Cospicua, Mtarfa, Marsa and Sliema. The locals who were influenced by the soldiers stationed in the area were introduced to these sporting activities. The most popular sport amongst the residents of Floriana was football, however some also practised cricket and hockey. Floriana still has its hockey club, carrying the name Floriana Young Stars Hockey Club.

===Club colours and mascot===
Between 1894 and 1905 the club&#x27;s colours were green/red quartered shirts, black shorts with green and red socks. The official colours of the club as we know them today, green and white vertical striped shirts, white shorts and green/white horizontal striped socks, were introduced in 1905. At that time the Royal Dublin Fusiliers were stationed in Floriana. During that year, three friendly matches were held between this regiment and FFC. At the end of the final match both teams exchanged their shirts and later the FFC changed their official colours to their green and white shirts. The regiment left the Island for India in that same year. The ties between Floriana and the Royal Dublin Fusiliers were so strong that the people hailing from Floriana were nicknamed after the Irish, &quot;Tal-Irish&quot;.

The club&#x27;s mascot is the lion, which features prominently on the club&#x27;s badge since 1936 together with the Latin motto &quot;Ex Ludis Virtus&quot;, meaning &quot;virtue out of the game&quot;. In this regard the club&#x27;s badge represents the fierceness of the lion together with the virtues of sportsmanship. The lion was chosen as the club&#x27;s mascot for two general reasons attributed to history of Floriana.

First attribution is to the coat-of-arms of the Grandmaster of Order of St. John, Manoel de Vilhena, which has the lion on it. Vilhena was the mastermind behind the construction of a fortification suburg of Floriana (originally known as Borgo Vilhena) to defend the capital city of Valletta from land attacks. He even ordered the construction of a lion statue fountain, with his Grandmaster coat of arms being held by the lions hand, in the centre of Floriana&#x27;s main square, St. Anne Square, which is still there today.

Second attribution to the lion is the statue of St. Publius who is the patron saint of Floriana. The St. Publius&#x27; statue has a lion with it which shows how Publius was killed for his Christian preachings.

The first game won by the team was confirmed on the feast of the patron&#x27;s village St. Publius, on 13 April 1910, which is to some considered a divine confirmation.

=== 2020 Win and COVID-19 national outrage ===
On 25 May 2020 Floriana FC were crowned champions of the BOV Premier League for the 26th title in their history and their first in 27 years, following a shortened season by a legal notice from the health authority in Malta to stop all contact sports on the Island because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020 a vote was taken in the MFA Counsel and declared all those on top of the table in all participating divisions will be declared champions. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the season was ultimately stopped earlier and Floriana was crowned champions of the league.

Celebrations were then hosted in the Fosos in Floriana, where a mass gathering of supporters broke social distancing rules and broke several Maltese laws by not staying in groups of six of less. The event sparked national outrage within the public in Malta and was featured on nearly all Maltese national newspapers.

===Domestic successes===
Since the foundation of the Malta Football Association, in 1909, (fiv)and local competitions the club won a total of 108 honours, which includes 26 league titles and 25 Cup knock out competitions. The club has also achieved a number of impressive feats, such as four consecutive league championships, ten doubles (League plus Cup) and a League title with maximum points.

===UEFA competitions===
Over the years FFC participated in the various competitions organised by the European football body, UEFA, such as the:

*UEFA Champions League
*UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup
*Fairs Cities&#x27; Cup
*UEFA Europa League
*Intertoto Cup

In 1962, the club was the first to represent Malta in UEFA competitions in its Cup Winners&#x27; Cup against the Hungarian side Ujpest Dozsa. Over the years, FFC had the opportunity to meet some renowned European football clubs, including the likes of:

* Ipswich Town
* Inter Milan
* Sparta Rotterdam
* Panathinaikos
* Ferencváros
* Dundee United
* FC Porto
* Borussia Dortmund
* Hajduk Split
* Red Star Belgrade

On two occasions FFC made it to the next round, 1993–94 Champions Cup and Intertoto Cup 1999–00.

===Youth sector===
In 1987 the club founded its youth sector, Floriana FC Nursery (FFCN), which is affiliated to the Malta Youth Football Association. The club&#x27;s youth sector may also be considered one of the most successful organisations of its type on the Island; not only has it produced a number of some of the finest footballers, but it has also won a number of league titles organised by the Association. The following are some of the major honours won by FFCN:

06 / 07 UNDER 14 Knock out competition
*U/14 League Champions – twice
*U/16 League Champions – six times, four of which in a row, 1993 to 1997
*U/18 League Champions – six times, four of which in a row, 1996 to 2000

Today all the major six Premiership clubs in Malta have at least two players forming part of their squad, which have been raised by the Floriana Youth Nursery.

===Rivalries===

During their history Floriana has had three main rivals, these being St. George&#x27;s FC, Sliema Wanderers and neighbors Valletta. The rivalry against St. George&#x27;s started from the beginnings of football in Malta circa 1890, before the rivalry with Sliema Wanderers FC developed (now referred to as the old firm rivalry).This rivalry peaked from 1922 onwards and lasted until the late 1970s, during which time both sides dominated the Maltese football scene. Football hooliganism and direct conflicts between supporters were something usual.

Today the rivalry has declined. Recently Floriana won their 20th FA Trophy against Sliema. This re-ignited the rivalry between both clubs, as Floriana won 9 finals in this cup competition against the Blues. 
The rivalry against Valletta is still alive, and is now considered the biggest fixture in the Maltese Premier League and one of the most classic derbies in Maltese football. The rivalry stems from the close proximity of the two localities they represent, as well as the history and huge domestic success of both clubs. The matches between the two sides always attract big crowds to the stadium and the fans treat these clashes as cup finals.

<doc id="1312117" wikidata="Q851361" url="?curid=1312117" title="Huntsman Corporation">
<text>Huntsman Corporation is an American multinational manufacturer and marketer of chemical products for consumers and industrial customers. Huntsman manufactures assorted polyurethanes, performance products, and adhesives for customers like BMW, GE, Chevron, Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever and Walkaroo. With global headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas, it operates more than 60 manufacturing, R&amp;D and operations facilities in over 25 countries and employ approximately 7,000 associates across three business divisions. Huntsman Corporation had 2023 revenues of approximately $6 billion.

==History==
The Huntsman Corporation was initially founded as the Huntsman Container Corporation in 1970 by Alonzo Blaine Huntsman Jr. and his younger brother Jon Huntsman, Sr. It went public as the Huntsman Corporation on the New York Stock Exchange in February 2005. Huntsman has grown through a series of acquisitions (with some divestitures) and today is a manufacturer and marketer of differentiated and specialty chemical products.

In April 1994, Huntsman acquired the Texaco Chemical company for $1.1 billion. Texaco Inc. agreed to sell its last remaining petrochemicals plant to Huntsman in 1999 for about $600 million.

The Huntsman Corporation became the then third-largest petrochemical business in the United States when in 1999, it acquired Imperial Chemical Industries&#x27; polyurethanes, titanium dioxide, aromatics and petrochemical global businesses for $2.8 billion.

Huntsman also acquired the Performance Additives and Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) businesses of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. on October 1, 2014, to become the largest color and white pigments company in the world. Huntsman paid approximately $1 billion in cash and assumed certain unfunded European pension liabilities.

===Huntsman Building Solutions Created===

Huntsman named its spray polyurethane foam (SPF) business as Huntsman Building Solutions (HBS) in May, 2020. The SPF business was formed when Huntsman acquired leading North American SPF company Icynene-Lapolla in February 2020 and combined it with Demilec, which Huntsman acquired in 2018. Huntsman is now the fifth largest insulation manufacturer in the world.

===Proposed merger with Clariant===

In May 2017, Huntsman and Clariant announced that they would merge, as equals, forming a global leader in specialty chemicals with the deal valued at $20 billion. Clariant shareholders would own 52% of the new entity, with Huntsman shareholders owning the remaining 48% of shares.

The merger agreement was terminated on October 27, 2017.

===IPO of Venator===

Huntsman Corporation spun-off its Pigments and Additives division as Venator Materials in an initial public offering on August 8, 2017.

Venator became the owner of Huntsman&#x27;s Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives businesses, which offers products comprising a broad range of pigments and additives that add performance and color to many everyday items. Venator is a global company with more than 4,300 employees across 27 facilities in more than 10 countries.

On May 14, 2023, Venator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

===Terminated takeover and Apollo suit===
In June 2007, it was announced that Huntsman had agreed to be acquired by Access Industries, owned by the billionaire Len Blavatnik, for $5.88 billion in cash. Huntsman shareholders would receive $25.25 a share from Access Industries&#x27; chemical unit, Basell Holdings, based in Hoofddorp, Netherlands. Access would assume $3.7bn of Huntsman debt.

However, on July 12, 2007, the agreement was terminated as Huntsman agreed to be bought by Apollo Global Management for $6.51bn. Huntsman filed a suit in Texas against Apollo and two partners, co-founders Leon Black and Josh Harris, after the group backed out of the deal to purchase the company in June 2008. The suit alleged fraud against Apollo Management as Huntsman believed that the group never intended to allow its Hexion Specialty Chemicals unit to buy Huntsman Corp. for $6.5 billion. Huntsman also claimed Apollo put forth a higher bid to prevent the Basell AF buyout as it would have threatened Hexion&#x27;s market share. Hexion stated Huntsman&#x27;s declining financial position as the reason the deal was terminated. Upon termination of the Hexion merger agreement, the Huntsman stock value dropped by almost 50%.

In December 2008, Apollo and Hexion agreed to pay Huntsman $1.1 billion in return for Huntsman dropping all charges against them. This includes $500 million in cash, a $250 million investment in Huntsman, and an additional $425 million in cash, repayable by separate suits against Credit Suisse.

===Starboard stake===
Activist hedge fund Starboard disclosed a stake in the company in 2021. The hedge fund owned more than 8% of Huntsman, roughly $500 million worth. Starboard did not succeed in gaining seats on the company&#x27;s board, one of its goals, and decided to completely exit their position within Huntsman. 

==Business segments==
Advanced Materials supplies synthetic and formulated polymer systems. Huntsman’s epoxy, acrylic and polyurethane-based polymer products are used to replace traditional materials in aircraft, automobiles and electrical power transmission. Epoxy-based adhesives are also sold in the B2C segment primarily in India, Brazil &amp; some parts of Europe under the brand name Araldite. The roots date back to 1758, when J.R. Geigy Ltd., the oldest chemicals company in Basel, Switzerland, began trading in chemicals and dyes. Huntsman acquired the Advanced Materials business from Vantico back in 2003.

Polyurethanes supplies MDI-based polyurethane precursors and systems used in an extensive range of applications and market sectors.

Performance Products supplies amines, carbonates, surfactants, and maleic anhydride. End uses include agrochemicals; oil, gas, and alternative energy; home detergents and personal care products; adhesives and coatings; mining; and curing agents for polyurethane and epoxy.

==Controversy==
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Huntsman Corporation refused to withdraw from the Russian market. Research from Yale University updated on April 28, 2022 identifying how companies were reacting to Russia&#x27;s invasion, identified Huntsman in their worst category of &quot;Digging In&quot;, or refusing to withdraw or limit activities in Russia.

Peter Huntsman of Huntsman Corporation responded to the Yale list by condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Peter Huntsman further noted the company was in full compliance with all American and EU laws; asserted none of their products had military applications; stated hundreds of Russian and Ukrainian workers depended on the company to support their families; and he also objected to the implication Yale University has the right to dictate foreign policy for American companies.

<text>Jean-Marie Lehn (born 30 September 1939) is a French chemist who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with Donald Cram and Charles Pedersen in 1987 for his synthesis of cryptands. Lehn was an early innovator in the field of supramolecular chemistry, i.e., the chemistry of host–guest molecular assemblies created by intermolecular interactions, and continues to innovate in this field. He described the process by which molecules recognize each other. Drugs, for example, &quot;know&quot; which cell to destroy and which to let live. According to information provided by Lehn to the Nobel Foundation in January 2006, his group had published 790 peer-reviewed articles in chemistry literature by then.


==Biography==

===Early years===
Lehn was born in Rosheim, Alsace, France to Pierre and Marie Lehn. He is of Alsatian German descent. His father was a baker, but because of his interest in music, he later became the city organist. Lehn also studied music, saying that it became his major interest after science. He has continued to play the organ throughout his professional career as a scientist. His high school studies in Obernai, from 1950 to 1957, included Latin, Greek, German, and English languages, French literature, and he later became very keen of both philosophy and science, particularly chemistry. In July 1957, he obtained the baccalauréat in philosophy, and in September of the same year, the baccalauréat in Natural Sciences.

At the University of Strasbourg, although he considered studying philosophy, he ended up taking courses in physical, chemical and natural sciences, attending the lectures of Guy Ourisson, and realizing that he wanted to pursue a research career in organic chemistry. He joined Ourisson&#x27;s lab, working his way to the Ph.D. There, he was in charge of the lab&#x27;s first NMR spectrometer, and published his first scientific paper, which pointed out an additivity rule for substituent induced shifts of proton NMR signals in steroid derivatives. He obtained his Ph.D., and went to work for a year at Robert Burns Woodward&#x27;s laboratory at Harvard University, working among other things on the synthesis of vitamin B12.

===Career ===
In 1966, he was appointed a position as &quot;maître de conférences&quot; (assistant professor) at the Chemistry Department of the University of Strasbourg. His research focused on the physical properties of molecules, synthesizing compounds specifically designed for exhibiting a given property, in order to better understand how that property was related to structure.

In 1968, he achieved the synthesis of cage-like molecules, comprising a cavity inside which another molecule could be lodged. Organic chemistry enabled him to engineer cages with the desired shape, thus only allowing a certain type of molecule to lodge itself in the cage. This was the premise for an entire new field in chemistry, sensors. Such mechanisms also play a great role in molecular biology.

These cryptands, as Lehn dubbed them, became his main center of interest, and led to his definition of a new type of chemistry, &quot;supramolecular chemistry&quot;, which instead of studying the bonds inside one molecule, looks at intermolecular attractions, and what would be later called &quot;fragile objects&quot;, such as micelles, polymers, or clays.

In 1980, he was elected to become a teacher at the prestigious Collège de France, and in 1987 was awarded the Nobel Prize, alongside Donald Cram and Charles Pedersen for his works on cryptands.

In 1998, he established and directed a research group at the Institute of Nanotechnology at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology

He is currently a member of the Reliance Innovation Council which was formed by Reliance Industries Limited, India.

, Lehn has an h-index of 154 according to Google Scholar and of 137 (946 documents) according to Scopus.

==Legacy==
In 1987, Pierre Boulez dedicated a very short piano work &quot;Fragment d‘une ébauche&quot; to Lehn on the occasion of his Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

==Personal life==
Lehn was married in 1965 to Sylvie Lederer, and together they had two sons, David and Mathias.

Lehn is an atheist.

<text>7 Year Bitch was an American punk rock band from Seattle, Washington. The band was active between 1990 and 1997 and released three albums over that time. The band formed at the same time as the emergence of the riot grrrl sub-genre, which is a subgenre of punk music from the early to mid-1990s that emphasized the role of women in rock music. The Riot Grrrl movement began as a feminist response to the violence and misogyny that became more prominent in punk music in the mid-to-late 1980s, and 7 Year Bitch, an all-female punk band, emerged as part of that sub-genre.

== Biography ==

=== Career ===
7 Year Bitch was formed in 1990 by vocalist Selene Vigil, guitarist Stefanie Sargent, bassist Elizabeth Davis and drummer Valerie Agnew. Vigil, Sargent, and Agnew had been playing together in the Seattle band Barbie&#x27;s Dream Car when their bassist left for Europe. They subsequently recruited Davis and renamed their band after the movie &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;, based on a suggestion by their friend Ben London, a member of the fellow Seattle band Alcohol Funnycar.

At their first concert, the band opened for The Gits, who would prove to have a significant influence on their music. In 1991, the band released their first single &quot;Lorna&quot; and signed with C/Z Records. Their first album, &quot;Sick &#x27;Em&quot;, was released in 1992, but it was overshadowed by Sargent&#x27;s death on June 27, through passing out on her back after returning home from a party where she had drunk alcohol and taken a small amount of heroin. Following a period of grieving and uncertainty, the band decided to continue, recruiting guitarist Roisin Dunne as Sargent&#x27;s replacement later that year.

In July 1993, Gits&#x27; frontwoman and long-time friend of the band Mia Zapata was raped and murdered while walking home late at night. This event, coupled with Sargent&#x27;s death the previous year, had a profound effect on the group. As a reaction, the band recorded and released their second album &quot;¡Viva Zapata!&quot; (1994) in tribute to both of their fallen friends. During this time, Valerie Agnew also became one of the primary organizers and co-founders of the anti-violence and self-defence organisation Home Alive. On April 8, 1994, the band played a benefit show for Rock Against Domestic Violence at the Cameo Theatre on Miami Beach, alongside Babes in Toyland and Jack Off Jill.

In 1995, the band signed with Atlantic Records and in 1996 released their third album, &quot;Gato Negro&quot;. Following the tour supporting &quot;Gato Negro&quot;, guitarist Roisin Dunne left, and was replaced by Lisa Fay Beatty, the band&#x27;s live sound engineer and long-time friend.

=== Break-up ===
In early 1997, the band began recording material for what was to be their fourth album. The band moved from Seattle to California, Elizabeth Davis and Valerie Agnew to San Francisco, and Selene Vigil to Los Angeles. With the recent departure of their guitarist, Roisin Dunne and the geographical separation between bandmates, Seven Year Bitch&#x27;s career came to a close after a final tour with San Francisco&#x27;s Lost Goat. The break-up was, fittingly, seven years after their formation, mirroring the popular belief of the &quot;seven-year itch&quot;.

=== Aftermath ===
Following the break-up of 7 Year Bitch, bassist Elizabeth Davis joined the San Francisco-based band Clone, with whom she performed until 2003. In 2005, she helped to form the band Von Iva. Guitarist Lisa Fay Beatty became involved with filmography, played for the band Smoochknob, and held a solo act called Elfay. She went on to open show for the band Sleepytime Gorilla Museum. Vocalist Selene Vigil formed a gothic/psychedelic-influenced band by the name of Cistine in 2000. She later released the solo album &quot;That Was Then&quot; in 2010, followed by &quot;Tough Dance&quot; in 2017. Roisin Dunne joined the band The Last Goodbye in 2006.

Their songs &quot;The Scratch&quot; and &quot;Icy Blue&quot; were featured in the movie &quot;Mad Love&quot; with Drew Barrymore and Chris O&#x27;Donnell.

<doc id="1312148" wikidata="Q6731237" url="?curid=1312148" title="Magna Carta Island">
<text>Magna Carta Island is an ait in the River Thames in England, on the reach above Bell Weir Lock. It is in Berkshire facing water-meadows forming Runnymede. Its civil and ecclesiastical parish is Wraysbury so it was transferred from Buckinghamshire to Berkshire in 1974.

==History==

The island is a contender for being the place where, in 1215, King John sealed &quot;Magna Carta&quot;. Whilst the charter itself indicates Runnymede by name, it is possible the island may have been considered part of Runnymede at the time. It is known that in 1217 the island was the meeting-place of Henry III and Louis (later Louis VIII) of France.

In the early 1920s it was owned by a stockbroker, J. F. MacGregor, and his wife, the music hall performer Maidie Scott. In August 2014 &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that the island would be sold by Sotheby&#x27;s International Realty.

<text>Thomas Robert Cech (born December 8, 1947) is an American chemist who shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Sidney Altman for their discovery of the catalytic properties of RNA. Cech discovered that RNA could itself cut strands of RNA, suggesting that life might have started as RNA. He found that RNA can not only transmit instructions, but that it can act as a speed up the necessary reactions. 

He also studied telomeres, and his lab discovered an enzyme, TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), which is part of the process of restoring telomeres after they are shortened during cell division. 

As president of Howard Hughes Medical Institute, he promoted science education, and he teaches an undergraduate chemistry course at the University of Colorado.

==Early life and career==
Cech was born to parents of Czech origin (his grandfather was Czech, his other grandparents were first-generation Americans) in Chicago. He grew up in Iowa City, Iowa. In junior high school, he knocked on the doors of geology professors at the University of Iowa, and asked them to discuss crystal structures, meteorites and fossils.

A National Merit Scholar, Cech entered Grinnell College in 1966. There he studied Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, constitutional history and chemistry. He married his organic chemistry lab partner, Carol Lynn Martinson, and graduated with a B.A. in 1970.
In 1975, Cech completed his PhD in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley and in the same year, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he engaged in postdoctoral research. In 1978, he obtained his first faculty position at the University of Colorado where he lectured undergraduate students in chemistry and biochemistry, and where he remains on the faculty, currently as distinguished professor in the department of biochemistry. In 2000, Cech succeeded Purnell Choppin as president of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Maryland. He also continued to head his biochemistry laboratory at the University of Colorado, Boulder. On April 1, 2008, Cech announced that he would step down as the president of HHMI, to return to teaching and research, in spring 2009. Returning to Boulder, Cech became the first executive director of the BioFrontiers Institute, a position he held until 2020. He also taught general chemistry to freshmen.

Cech is the author of &quot;The Catalyst: RNA and the Quest to Unlock Life’s Deepest Secrets&quot;, published in June 2024. 

==Research==
Cech&#x27;s main research area is that of the process of transcription in the nucleus of cells. He studies how the genetic code of DNA is transcribed into RNA. In the 1970s, Cech had been studying the splicing of RNA in the unicellular organism &quot;Tetrahymena thermophila&quot; when he discovered that an unprocessed RNA molecule could splice itself. In 1982, Cech became the first to show that RNA molecules are not restricted to being passive carriers of genetic information – they can have catalytic functions and can participate in cellular reactions. RNA-processing reactions and protein synthesis on ribosomes in particular are catalysed by RNA. RNA enzymes are known as ribozymes and have provided a new tool for gene technology. They also have the potential to provide new therapeutic agents – for example, they have the ability to destroy and cleave invading, viral RNAs.

Cech&#x27;s second area of research is on telomeres, the structure that protects the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres are shortened with every duplication of DNA, and must be lengthened again. He studies telomerase, the enzyme that copies the telomeric sequences and lengthens them. The active site protein subunits of telomerase comprise a new class of reverse transcriptases, enzymes previously thought to be restricted to viruses and transposable elements. Telomerase is activated in 90% of human cancers. Therefore, a drug that would inhibit its activity could be useful in treating cancer.

==Awards==
Cech&#x27;s work has been recognised by many awards and prizes including: lifetime professorship by the American Cancer Society (1987), the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University (1988), the Heineken Prize of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences (1988), the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award (1988), the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1989, shared with Sidney Altman), the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1990 and the National Medal of Science (1995). In 1987, Cech was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences and in 1988 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Cech was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2001. In 2003, Cech gave the University of Colorado&#x27;s George Gamow Memorial Lecture. In 2007, he received the Othmer Gold Medal for outstanding contributions to progress in chemistry and science.

<doc id="1312166" wikidata="Q147789" url="?curid=1312166" title="Dizzy – The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure">
<text>Dizzy – The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure is an adventure-platform game, the first video game featuring the character Dizzy, an anthropomorphic egg. The game was designed by two British brothers, the Oliver Twins. &quot;Dizzy&quot; was published by Codemasters and was released in 1987.

==Gameplay==
The game is a platform adventure where Dizzy must search the fairy tale land of Katmandu for a Leprechaun&#x27;s Wig, a Cloud&#x27;s Silver Lining, a Vampire Dux Feather, and a Troll Brew and deposit them in a cauldron to make a potion to defeat the evil wizard Zaks. The gameplay involves collecting items and moving to other locations where the item is required; for example, at one point a raincoat is needed to protect against damaging rain. This is made more difficult because only one item can be carried at any given time. The game includes several lines from J. Milton Hayes&#x27; poem &quot;The Green Eye of the Yellow God&quot; on banners in certain screens, where they serve as clues on how to solve some puzzles.

Unlike later games in the series, which focus more on the inventory-based puzzles, this game features a very large number of hazards that kill the player on contact. With only three lives initially to complete the game, this made the game challenging to complete.

==Development==
The Oliver Twins said in an interview, on the British television show &quot;When Games Attack&quot;, that the character Dizzy was originally not supposed to be an egg at all but just a face with hands and feet. They then said they accepted everyone thought he was an egg and decided to go with that. They also said they used to plan out levels on the back of spare rolls of wallpaper.

Dizzy gets his name from the character&#x27;s tumbles and somersaults while jumping, a feature inspired by the Oliver Twins&#x27; graphics software &quot;Panda Sprites&quot; which enabled them to rotate an image easily so each frame did not have to be manually drawn. The software distorted complex sprites so the character was required to be simple, hence the choice of an egg.

==Reception==

In 2017, the game was placed on Eurogamer&#x27;s &quot;10 games that defined the ZX Spectrum&quot; list.

<doc id="1312167" wikidata="Q1094434" url="?curid=1312167" title="Junior Johnson">
<text>Robert Glenn Johnson Jr. (June 28, 1931 – December 20, 2019), better known as Junior Johnson, was an American professional stock car racing driver, engineer, and team owner as well as an entrepreneur. He won 50 NASCAR races in his career before retiring in 1966. In the 1970s and 1980s, he became a NASCAR racing team owner, winning the NASCAR championship with Cale Yarborough and Darrell Waltrip three times each; Johnson was the first owner to win multiple championships with multiple drivers. He is credited as the first to use the drafting technique in stock car racing. He was nicknamed &quot;The Last American Hero,&quot; and his autobiography and movie based on his upbringing is of the same name. In May 2007, Johnson teamed with Piedmont Distillers of Madison, North Carolina, to introduce the company&#x27;s second moonshine product, called &quot;Midnight Moon Moonshine&quot;, a nod to the days of his early youth in the 1940s when he made a living as a moonshiner/moonrunner and bootlegger.

==Early life and race career==
Johnson was born in Ronda, North Carolina, the fourth of seven children of Lora Belle (Money) and Robert Glenn Johnson, Sr. His family is of Ulster Scots descent, and settled in the foothills of North Carolina in the eighteenth century. The Johnson family was involved in the whiskey business before he was born. His maternal great-grandfather served as the second-highest-ranking Confederate general in North Carolina.

His father, a lifelong bootlegger, spent nearly twenty of his sixty-three years in prison, as their house was frequently raided by revenue agents. Junior was arrested and spent one year in prison in Ohio in 1956-57 for having an illegal still, although he was never caught in his many years of transporting bootleg liquor at high speed.

In 1955, Johnson began his career as a NASCAR driver. In his first full season, he won five races and finished sixth in the 1955 NASCAR Grand National points standings.

In 1958, Johnson won six races.

In 1959, Johnson won five more NASCAR Grand National races (including a win from the pole position at the 1959 Hickory 250); by this time he was regarded as one of the best short-track racers in the sport.

His first win at a &quot;superspeedway&quot; came at the Daytona 500 in 1960. Johnson and his crew chief, Ray Fox, were practicing for the race, trying to figure out how to increase their speed, which was slower than that of the top cars in the race. During a test run, a faster car passed Johnson. He noticed that, when he moved behind that car, his own car&#x27;s speed increased because of the faster car&#x27;s slipstream. Johnson was then able to stay close behind the other car until the final lap of the test run, when he used the &quot;slipstream&quot; effect to slingshot past it. By using this technique, Johnson went on to win the 1960 Daytona 500, despite that his car was slower than others in the field. Johnson&#x27;s technique was quickly adopted by other drivers, and his practice of &quot;drafting&quot; has become a common tactic in NASCAR races.

In 1963, Johnson had a two-lap lead in the World 600 at Charlotte before a spectator threw a bottle onto the track and caused a crash; Johnson suffered only minor injuries. Johnson also tried but failed to qualify for the 1963 Indianapolis 500.

Johnson retired as a driver in 1966. In his career, Johnson claimed 50 victories, 11 at major speedway races. He retired as the winningest driver never to have a championship.

Johnson was a master of dirt track racing. &quot;The two best drivers I&#x27;ve ever competed against on dirt are Junior Johnson and Dick Hutcherson,&quot; said two-time NASCAR champion Ned Jarrett.

==Career as a NASCAR owner==

As a team owner, he worked with many NASCAR drivers, including Darel Dieringer, LeeRoy Yarbrough, Cale Yarborough, Bobby Allison, Darrell Waltrip, Neil Bonnett, Terry Labonte, Geoffrey Bodine, Sterling Marlin, Jimmy Spencer and Bill Elliott. In all, his drivers won 132 races, which is fifth to Petty Enterprises, Hendrick Motorsports, Joe Gibbs Racing and Roush Fenway Racing on the all-time list. His drivers won six Winston Cup Championships — three with Yarborough (1976–1978) and Waltrip (1981–82, 1985).
In 2011, Johnson announced that he would restart a race team with son Robert as the driver. Junior Johnson Racing will be located in Hamptonville, North Carolina. Robert, the 2010 UARA Rookie of the Year, planned to run a 28–30 race schedule in 2011, which includes the entire K&amp;N East Series schedule and some races in the UARA and Whelen All-American Series.

==Awards==
*He was named one of NASCAR&#x27;s 50 Greatest Drivers in 1998.
*He was inducted in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1991.
*Johnson joined Michael Jordan, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Richard Petty by having a stretch of highway named in his honor in 2004. His daughter Meredith sang the national anthem at the dedication of the highway. An stretch of U.S. Highway 421 from the Yadkin and Wilkes county line to the Windy Gap exit is named Junior Johnson Highway.
*He was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame on May 23, 2010.
*He was named one of NASCAR&#x27;s 75 Greatest Drivers (2023)

==Family==
Johnson was briefly married in 1949 to Mary Gray. His marriage to childhood sweetheart Flossie Clark (1929–2020) ended in divorce in 1992; they were legally married in 1975, although they had been together since the early 1950s. (Racing Legends have them as married in 1958). His marriage to Lisa Day (b.1965) in 1992 resulted in two children: daughter Meredith Suzanne (b.1995) and son Robert Glenn Johnson III (b.1993), both of whom attended Duke University. Johnson built a new home for his family in 1997, ultimately selling in 2012 because of poor health. He resided in Charlotte, North Carolina, at the time of his death in 2019.
Until Flossie&#x27;s death on April 9, 2020, she still resided in the family home, built by Junior in 1964 (next to Johnson&#x27;s old Ingle Hollow race shop), which she kept as part of the divorce settlement.

==Presidential pardon==
On December 26, 1986, President Ronald Reagan granted Johnson a presidential pardon for his 1956 moonshining conviction. In response to the pardon, which restored his right to vote, Johnson said, &quot;I could not have imagined anything better.&quot;

==Film==
In the mid-1960s, writer Tom Wolfe researched and wrote an article about Johnson, published in March 1965 in &quot;Esquire&quot;, and reprinted in Wolfe&#x27;s The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine Flake Streamline Baby. This was eventually reprinted in &quot;The Best American Sports Writing of the Century&quot;, ed. David Halberstam (1999). The article, originally entitled &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;, turned Johnson into a national celebrity and led to fame beyond the circle of NASCAR fans. In turn, the article was made into a 1973 movie based on Johnson&#x27;s career as a driver and moonshiner, &quot;The Last American Hero&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Hard Driver&quot;). Jeff Bridges starred as a fictionalized Johnson, and Johnson himself served as technical advisor for the film. The movie was critically acclaimed and featured the Jim Croce hit song &quot;I Got A Name&quot;.

Follow Your Dreams Productions&#x27; President and CEO, Fred Griffith, has signed a rights deal for a true-life story movie about Junior Johnson (Sports Illustrated Vault, 2006). Griffith, an American actor and producer from South Carolina, is currently adapting a screenplay based largely on the book, &quot;Junior Johnson, Brave In Life&quot;, written by Tom Higgins and Steve Waid (Big West Racing, 2006). Veteran actor and producer Chris Mulkey is a writing producer for the film. According to Griffith, this film—unlike &quot;The Last American Hero&quot;, which was about a fictionalized version of Johnson named Junior &quot;Jackson&quot;—will remain true to the real life of Junior Johnson.(Morris 2006, p. C-1) Johnson had a voice role in the animated film &quot;Cars 3&quot;, as Junior &quot;Midnight&quot; Moon, a reference to his Moonshine Company.

==Midnight Moon==
In May 2007, Johnson teamed with Piedmont Distillers to introduce the company&#x27;s second moonshine product, called Midnight Moon. Johnson became part-owner of Piedmont Distillers, the only legal distiller in North Carolina at the time. Piedmont Distillers is located in Madison, N.C., in the town’s former train station built in 1915. The moonshine is made in small batches in a copper still, authentic to the Johnson family tradition of making moonshine.

==Death==
Johnson died at a hospice care facility in Charlotte on December 20, 2019, at age 88. He had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at the time.

<text>are simple wooden Japanese dolls with no arms or legs that have been crafted for more than 150 years as a toy for children. Originally from the Tohoku region in northern Honshu, &quot;kokeshi&quot; are handmade from wood, having a simple trunk and head with a few thin, painted lines to define the face. The body often has floral and/or ring designs painted in red, black, and sometimes green, purple, blue, or yellow inks, and covered with a layer of wax. One characteristic of &quot;kokeshi&quot; dolls is their lack of arms or legs. Since the 1950s, kokeshi makers have signed their work, usually on the bottom and sometimes on the back.

==History and etymology==
The origin and naming of &quot;kokeshi&quot; is unclear, with historical ateji spellings including 小芥子, 木牌子, 木形子, and 木芥子. The hiragana spelling こけし was agreed on at the All-Japan Kokeshi Exhibition (全国こけし大会) at Naruko Onsen in August 1939.

A popular theory suggests that &quot;kokeshi&quot; may be fetish substitutes for unwanted babies killed after birth and the characters can be understood as 子消し made up of and . While infanticide was commonly practiced in Japan until the 20th century, there is little if any evidence to support the theory that &quot;kokeshi&quot; have anything to do with the practice, with the earliest references in literature dating only from 1965. The word &quot;kokeshi&quot; itself is originally of the Sendai dialect, with the dolls being known as, for example, &quot;deko&quot;, &quot;kideko&quot;, &quot;dekoroko&quot;; in Fukushima as &quot;kibako&quot;, &quot;kihohoko&quot;; in Miyagi as &quot;obokko&quot;; and in Naruko as &quot;hangyo&quot; and &quot;kiningyō&quot;, none of which supports the theory.

Kokeshi were first produced by kijishi (木地師), artisans proficient with a lathe, at the Shinchi Shuraku, near the Tōgatta Onsen in Zaō from where kokeshi-making techniques spread to other spa areas in the Tōhoku region. It is said that these dolls were originally made during the middle of the Edo period (1600–1868) to be sold to people who were visiting the hot springs in the north-east of the country.

One of the earliest doll-focused associations in Japan was the Sendai Kokeshi Association (&quot;Sendai Kokeshi-kai&quot;) established in 1923 by Mihara Ryōkichi (三原良吉) and Amae Tomiya. The two released a 1928 book about kokeshi, &quot;Kokeshi Hōko no Hanashi&quot;, which introduced the local tradition to the entire Japan. Mihara continued his work as a journalist and folklorist to his death in 1982, being responsible for popularization of kokeshi and other elements of Sendai folklore.

==Types==
 dolls&#x27; shapes and patterns are particular to a certain area and are classified under eleven types, shown below. The most dominant type is the Naruko variety originally made in Miyagi Prefecture, which can also be found in Akita, Iwate, and Yamagata Prefectures. The main street of the Naruko Onsen Village is known as Kokeshi Street and has shops which are operated directly by the kokeshi carvers.

 allow the artist complete freedom in terms of shape, design and color and were developed after World War II (1945). They are not particular to a specific region of Japan and generally creative kokeshi artists are found in cities.

The woods used for kokeshi vary, with cherry used for its darkness and dogwood for its softer qualities. Itaya-kaede, a Japanese maple, is also used in the creation of both traditional and creative dolls. The wood is left outdoors to season for one to five years before it can be used.

===Traditional types===
Traditional types often correspond to a single or multiple onsen located within the Tōhoku region.

== Exhibitions and competitions ==
Traditionally, the National Kokeshi Exhibition and Competition in Shiroishi-Zao is held every year, and in 2022 it took place for the 64th time. In 2015, the event organized for the 57th time was attended for the first time by a master kokeshi maker of non-Japanese nationality, in the person of the Hungarian Réka Tóth-Vásárhelyi. In 2016, she won the main prize in the creative category with his work &quot;Dress-up Kokeshi - With a Wardrobe&quot;.

In 2022, the Creative Kokeshi Exhibition in Shibukawa was held for the 28th time. Creative Kokeshi Competition is held regularly in Tokyo, Japan.

== In popular culture ==

&quot;Kokeshi&quot; dolls have been used as an inspiration for the style of Nintendo&#x27;s digital avatars, called &quot;Miis&quot;, which are created and customized by players. Their appearance has become the symbol of the platform&#x27;s overall aesthetic.

Inspiration for the Momiji Doll originates from the kokeshi doll.

Japanese professional wrestler Tomoaki Honma is nicknamed after his finishing move &quot;Kokeshi&quot;, a diving headbutt where Honma falls straight down towards his opponent while keeping his arms at his sides, resembling a &quot;kokeshi&quot; in posture.

Miss Grand Japan 2020, Ruri Saji, wore a kokeshi doll-inspired costume which also transforms into an anime robot, showcasing Japan&#x27;s technological advancement in the robotics field. It has won the Best in National Costume title at the Miss Grand International 2020 held in Bangkok, Thailand.

<doc id="1312175" wikidata="Q4879633" url="?curid=1312175" title="Beecher (band)">
<text>Beecher were a British mathcore band from Manchester. Formed in 2001 by Daniel Plant (guitars), Ed Godby (vocals), Mark Lyons (guitars), Will Shaw (drums) and David Hopkinson (bass), they played a mix of metalcore, noise rock and progressive metal.

==History==
They toured the UK and Europe with Killswitch Engage, Norma Jean and Darkest Hour. The original intent was for the band to be a doom metal experiment, but the recruitment of vocalist Charles Edward Godby, and guitarist Mark Lyons, made a full band line-up.

After the recording of a five-track demo CD, the band released the &quot;Resention Is a Big Word in a Small Town&quot; EP for Nottingham-based In at the Deep End Records in 2002. This was followed by the album &quot;Breaking The Fourth Wall&quot; in 2003 on Calculated Risk Records. Soon after this release, Daniel Plant left the band, temporarily being replaced by Niall Wright of D-Rail but was eventually replaced by Daniel Shaw. Will Shaw left the band later, with Daniel Jones eventually being chosen as his replacement . After much critical acclaim, and a lot of touring, the band signed with Earache Records in 2004. Earache re-released &quot;Breaking The Fourth Wall&quot; in 2005 with six bonus tracks. 2005 also saw the release of Beecher&#x27;s second full-length album &quot;This Elegy, His Autopsy&quot;. This album, as well as being released as a standard CD, was also released as a limited edition vinyl box-set (limited to 1000 copies).

The band&#x27;s breakup was announced in January 2006, and the final show was at the Star and Garter in Manchester on 2 February 2006, playing alongside Narcosis and D-Rail. Beecher played two sets: one with their original drummer made up of earlier songs (including a rare airing of &quot;The Only One I Know&quot;), and one with his replacement where &quot;This Elegy, His Autopsy&quot; was performed in full. David Hopkinson and Ed Godby played in The Freezing Fog. Godby later emigrated to Belgium where he formed the bands Castles and Supergenius. Daniel Shaw currently plays in Wode and his new band Aggressive Perfector.

The band briefly reformed during December 2010-June 2011, for a one-off ten-year anniversary show at Manchester&#x27;s Moho Live with support from Trojan Horse and Nasdaq. Two more shows were announced for Leeds and London. However, after they finished the planned shows in late June 2011 they announced they were no plans to make the reunion permanent.

<text>Ein Herz, ein Sinn! (One Heart, one Mind!), opus 323 is a polka-mazurka composed by Johann Strauss II in 1868 belonging to a period of creativity of the composer. Strauss dedicated this piece to &#x27;the Committee of the Citizen&#x27;s Ball&#x27; which was held at the Imperial Redoutensaal on 11 February 1868 where on occasion he had earlier also dedicated his waltz Bürgersinn (op. 295).

Its themes have been selected as material for the operetta Wiener Blut (1899) of which Strauss himself did not compose any new music, instead relying on Adolf Müller Jr. to arrange from Strauss&#x27; previous compositions.

Strauss&#x27; tranquil polka-mazurka begins in C major with a Trio section in F major. Throughout the piece, the mood is generally happy although these are never outright cheerful nor triumphant and the finale is a gentle affirmation of these. The polka-mazurka has often been transcribed for piano solos.

<doc id="1312188" wikidata="Q6935096" url="?curid=1312188" title="Multistability">
<text>In a dynamical system, multistability is the property of having multiple stable equilibrium points in the vector space spanned by the states in the system. By mathematical necessity, there must also be unstable equilibrium points between the stable points. Points that are stable in some dimensions and unstable in others are termed unstable, as is the case with the first three Lagrangian points.

== Bistability ==

Bistability is the special case with two stable equilibrium points. It is the simplest form of multistability, and can occur in systems with only one state variable, as it only takes a one-dimensional space to separate two points.

== Initial instability ==

Near an unstable equilibrium, any system will be sensitive to noise, initial conditions and system parameters,
which can cause it to develop in one of multiple divergent directions. 
In economics and social sciences, path dependence gives rise to divergent directions of development.
Some path dependent processes are adequately described by multistability,
by being initially sensitive to input, before reaching a stagnant state – 
for example market share instability, which can develop into a stable monopoly for one of multiple possible vendors.

<doc id="1312197" wikidata="Q14182" url="?curid=1312197" title="Banjarmasin">
<text>Banjarmasin is the largest city in South Kalimantan, Indonesia. It was the capital of the province until 15 February 2022. The city is located on a delta island near the junction of the Barito and Martapura rivers. Historically the centre of the Banjarese culture, and the capital of the Sultanate of Banjar, it is the biggest city in South Kalimantan and one of the main cities of Kalimantan. The city covers an area of and had a population of 625,481 as of the 2010 Census and 657,663 as of the 2020 Census; the official estimate as of mid 2023 was 675,915 (comprising 337,819 males and 338,096 females). It is the third most populous city on the island of Borneo. 

Greater Banjarmasin, also known as Banjarbakula (an acronym for Banjarmasin-Barito Kuala-Tanah Laut) or Banjar Raya, is an urban agglomeration of over two million people covering an area of , which includes Banjarbaru city and parts of Banjar Regency (including Martapura town), Barito Kuala Regency, and Tanah Laut Regency, and accounts for almost half of the province&#x27;s population.

Banjarmasin was the &quot;de jure&quot; seat of the South Kalimantan governor and the location of the provincial parliament, although some provincial buildings have been relocated to Banjarbaru. On 15 February 2022, the capital of South Kalimantan province was legally moved to Banjarbaru.

==History==
===Etymology===
&quot;Banjarmasin&quot; is thought to be a corrupted version of &quot;Bandar Masih&quot; (Port Masih), which was named for Patih Masih, who ruled the port and the surrounding villages. Patih Masih&#x27;s name may have been a nickname. &quot;Masih&quot; originates from the Ngaju language. &quot;Oloh Masi&quot; refers to the coastal-dwelling Malay population in the language of the Dayaks, who lived in the interior and visited the port regularly to trade. Some of the Dayaks eventually settled in the port. They eventually contributed to the culture of the Banjar people, along with the Javanese and Malays.

===Early history===

European archeologist H. Kupper discovered several prehistoric sites around the region in 1939 and found implements such as choppers and other stone tools. Most of the artifacts found around the region and the province show signs of Neolithic culture. Migration from mainland Asia to Borneo may have been common while they were connected by the Sunda Shelf. Many stone tools have been found in Awang Bangkal, from the city.

Until the early 15th century, there were few written records found from the region. Outside records indicate it was home to several kingdoms such as Tanjungpuri—theorized to have been founded by Malay people from Srivijaya—and Negara Daha and Dipa, which were founded by Javanese people from Majapahit. Hinduism and Buddhism entered the region between the first and 15th centuries. There are two &quot;candis&quot; (temples) left in the region, Candi Laras and Candi Agung. The Ma&#x27;anyan people may have ruled the oldest kingdom in the archipelago, Nan Sarunai. Its existence is disputed; speculated by archeologists based on several carved stone tombs and a Ma&#x27;anyan folk song called &quot;Usak Jawa&quot;, which is thought to tell the story of the Majapahit conquest of the kingdom.

The history of Banjarmasin itself began during the founding of the Sultanate of Banjar. According to folk stories and the &quot;Hikayat Banjar&quot;, Sukarama, the fourth king of Negara Daha, wanted his grandson, Raden Samudra, to be his successor in the kingdom instead of his direct son Prince Tumenggung. Prince Tumenggung later banished Raden Samudra and tried to reclaim the throne for himself. Raden Samudra fled to the region that would later be known as Banjarmasin. There, he met Patih Masih. Under Samudra&#x27;s leadership, the port grew into the town of Bandar Masih. Tumenggung, who disliked Samudra&#x27;s growing power, wanted to invade the town. Samudra allied with the Demak Sultanate, which agreed to help him. In return he would have to convert to Islam if he won. With the help of expeditionary forces from Demak, Samudra defeated the Tumenggung forces and proclaimed the Banjar Sultanate. He changed his name to Sultan Suriansyah I. The sultanate became more reliant on the Demak to the point that it was considered their protectorate. However, between 1546 and 1550, as conquests and the spice trade enriched the sultanate, it became independent and stopped sending tributes to Java.

===Colonial era===
The first contact between Europeans and the Banjar people in the region came through trade. Starting in 1596, this mostly took place in Banten. European traders, largely Dutch, did not bother visiting the port until Banten&#x27;s rulers banned them. The traders resorted to attacking ships from other countries, including ships under the Banjar Sultanate, to steal nutmeg. The Sultan took revenge against a Dutch ship visiting Banjarmasin on 17 July 1607 by hijacking it and massacring the crew. Similar incidents occurred several times between 1603 and 1636, ending when the sultanate reached a trade agreement that put the Dutch East India Company in control of the nutmeg trade from the sultanate and gave it a monopoly over trade in Banjarmasin. The company was expelled in 1638, however, after the sultan waged a war against the Dutch and burned much of the company&#x27;s possessions around the port.
Similarly, an English company agreed upon a treaty with the sultanate in 1698 but was expelled from the region in 1707. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Banjarmasin was subject to British control, a situation complicated by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814, which was seen to have mandated its transfer to Dutch authority.This directive paradoxically conflicted with a prior 1812 treaty between the British East India Company and the sultanate, which prohibited the region’s transfer to any other European power. This issue was navigated by the then Governor of Java, John Fendall, who argued that the 1812 treaty’s conditions were still valid. Sovereignty was therefore effectively transferred from the British East India Company to the Sultan in late 1816, and not directly to the Dutch. The dispute over sovereignty was finally settled when the Sultan of Banjarmasin settled an agreement with the Netherlands in January 1817, effectively confirming Dutch control over the region. A succession crisis between Sultan Adam and Tamjidillah II and a dispute over resource control of coal mines resulted in a war between the sultanate and the Dutch East Indies Company which led to the end of the sultanate in 1863. The war continued until 1905 under an emergency government set up by the sultanate called Pagustian. The last resistance was put down with the capture of Queen Zaleha in 1906. As a result of the war, many Banjar people from Borneo migrated to Sumatra, Singapore, and Malaysia and formed communities there.

===20th century–present===
When World War II broke out, the city was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army. After the Battle of Banjarmasin, control was transferred to the Imperial Japanese Navy. Locals described Japanese rule under the navy as harsher compared to the army. This led many people to escape to Java, which remained under army rule. The city was liberated by Australian forces in September 1945. The return of Dutch rule, however, was opposed by the people and resulted in the Kalimantan Physical Revolution, four years of war between Indonesian nationalists and the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army. This ended with the Dutch recognition of Indonesia in 1949. The city was briefly assigned as the capital of Great Dayak federal state before being absorbed into a single Kalimantan province. It later became the capital city of the newly formed South Kalimantan province. Frequent flooding led to a plan to relocate the provincial capital city to Banjarbaru. The process continued until 2011, and the provincial parliament remains in Banjarmasin. Banjarmasin was granted city status by the Indonesian government in 1959 under Law Number 27 of 1959.

On 7 December 1996, Dirgantara Air Service Flight 5940 crashed to the gas factory after taking off near Syamsudin Noor International Airport, killing around 18 people. On 23 May 1997, the city witnessed a riot caused by friction between supporters of the United Development Party and Golkar. The riot later developed into looting, which targeted Chinese and Christian minorities and several shopping malls. At least 137 people were killed during the riots. The riot today is known by locals as &quot;Jumat Kelabu&quot; or Grey Friday. 

On 15 February 2022, the capital of South Kalimantan province was legally moved to Banjarbaru.

Being old and overcrowded, the government relocated the main terminal to the newly built Kilometer 17 Bus Terminal in Gambut District, Banjar Regency. However, the new terminal is rarely used and many bus operators resisted the relocation because of the remoteness of the new terminal from the city center.

Being divided by a big navigable river, speed boats on the river are also an important means of transportation within the city. Ride-hailing services such as Gojek and Grab are widespread. The city has three urban bus services, BRT Banjarbakula which connects it to the Greater Banjarmasin area and Trans Banjarmasin, which only serves the city proper. As with other Indonesian cities, the city has &quot;angkots&quot; (shared taxis), which have been declining rapidly because of competition from online ride-hailing services, online taxis, and new public transportation services created by the city government. On 22 December 2021, another urban bus system, Trans Banjarbakula, was launched which also covers the entire metropolitan area.

The city is served by the Port of Trisakti, which is one of main ports in Indonesia and classified as class IA. The port has a passenger terminal for passenger ships to neighbouring islands such as Java and Sulawesi. The closest airport is the Syamsudin Noor Airport, which located inside Banjarbaru city, from Banjarmasin.

==Media==

There are numerous newspapers, television stations, and radio based in Banjarmasin. The city is center of mass media in the province of South Kalimantan. Known established media groups such as Banjarmasin Post, Kalimantan Post, and &quot;Radar Banjarmasin&quot; existed since early New Order period, while numerous smaller independent media were founded mostly after Reformasi. Other example of news media are Barito Post, &quot;Mata Banua&quot;, Metro Banjar, and &quot;Kanal Kalimantan&quot;. In total, there were 47 registered news media including printed and online, 36 tabloids, and 4 magazines in the city.

In television sector, outside of nationwide networks both private and state-owned, there are local television stations focused mostly on local news. State-owned television network TVRI has local branch for South Kalimantan located in Banjarmasin, while Duta TV and Banjar TV, two most prominent local channels, are private.

The city also has a branch of Radio Republik Indonesia, an Indonesian state-owned radio network. According to the government source, there are 21 formally registered radio station.

<doc id="1312201" wikidata="Q327514" url="?curid=1312201" title="Jon Huntsman Sr.">
<text>Jon Meade Huntsman Sr. (June 21, 1937 – February 2, 2018) was an American businessman and philanthropist. He was the founder and executive chairman of Huntsman Corporation, a global manufacturer and marketer of specialty chemicals. Huntsman plastics are used in a wide variety of familiar objects, including (formerly) clamshell containers for McDonald&#x27;s hamburgers. Huntsman Corporation also manufactures a wide variety of organic and inorganic chemicals that include polyurethanes, textiles, and pigments. Huntsman&#x27;s philanthropic giving exceeded $1.5 billion, focusing on areas of cancer research, programs at various universities, and aid to Armenia.

==Early life and education==
Jon Meade Huntsman was born in Blackfoot, Idaho, into a poor family. His mother, Sarah Kathleen (née Robison; 1910–1969), was a homemaker, and his father, Alonzo Blaine Huntsman Sr. (1910–1990), was a teacher. In 1950, the family moved to Palo Alto, California, where Alonzo pursued graduate studies at Stanford University, earning an M.A. and Ed.D. He then became a superintendent of schools in the Los Altos district.

Jon Huntsman attended Palo Alto High School, where he became student body president. He was recruited by Harold Zellerbach, chairman of Crown-Zellerbach Paper Company, to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania on a Zellerbach scholarship. He graduated from Wharton in the spring of 1959, a brother of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

Huntsman married Karen Haight, daughter of David B. Haight, in June 1959, just weeks after he graduated. Both were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In July 1959, Huntsman left to serve for two years in the U.S. Navy as an officer aboard the USS &quot;Calvert&quot;. He subsequently earned an MBA from the University of Southern California&#x27;s Marshall School of Business in 1966.

==Business career==

===Dolco Packaging Corporation===
In 1961, Huntsman was employed by Olson Brothers, Inc., an egg-producing company in Los Angeles. There, he advanced through the ranks to assume the role of vice president of operations. Recognizing that the company sustained substantial losses due to poor packaging, Huntsman became interested in developing a better alternative. His leadership was key in developing the first plastic egg carton. In 1965, he established contact with the polystyrene operations of the Dow Chemical Company. In 1967, he became president of a joint venture between Olson Brothers, Inc., and Dow Chemical, the Dolco Packaging Corporation.

Seeing an opportunity to create packaging for the emerging fast-food industry, Huntsman left Dolco in 1970 to form the Huntsman Container Corporation with his brother, Alonzo Blaine Jr. (1936–2012), and others in Fullerton, California. Plants were constructed in Fullerton, California, in 1971 and in Troy, Ohio, in 1972. Since cash flow was an issue for the new company, Huntsman mortgaged his house and borrowed heavily from banks. In 1973 the company nearly collapsed when an Arab oil embargo cut off supplies of polystyrene, used to make expandable/expanded polystyrene (or EPS).

In 1974, Huntsman Container Corporation created the &quot;clamshell&quot; container for McDonald&#x27;s Big Mac. The company also developed other popular products, including the first plastic plates, bowls, and fast-food containers. In 1976, after completion of its first international plant at Skelmersdale, England, a stock deal was arranged to sell Huntsman Container Corporation to Keyes Fiber Company. Huntsman continued to serve as CEO of the container business for four more years and held a directorship of Keyes Fiber Company.

===Huntsman Chemical Company – Huntsman Corporation===
In 1982, after serving as a mission president for the LDS Church in Washington, DC, for three years, Huntsman continued his plastics and petrochemical pursuits with the formation of a new company, Huntsman Chemical Company, in Salt Lake City, Utah. In his capacity as CEO and Chairman, he grew the business into a multibillion-dollar company, in part by acquiring a number of businesses in the polystyrene, styrene, and polypropylene industry when they were not seen as profitable. Between 1986 and 2000 Huntsman acquired 36 companies, 35 of which turned out to be hugely profitable.

In 1994, the Huntsman Chemical Company was renamed the Huntsman Corporation. In 1996, Peter R. Huntsman became President and COO of Huntsman Corporation. In 2000 he replaced his father as the company&#x27;s CEO. Jon M. Huntsman continued to be involved in the company as Chairman.

During the 2000s, Huntsman continued its pattern of expansion, both in America and around the world, and reorganization. Huntsman Corporation became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005. As of 2014, Huntsman reported that it operated 80 manufacturing and R&amp;D facilities in 30 countries and employed approximately 12,000 associates.

===Huntsman Gay Global Capital===
In 2007 Huntsman co-founded an additional new private equity firm, Huntsman Gay Global Capital (now known as HGGC), with two former Bain Capital executives, Robert C. Gay (1989–2004, managing director) and Greg Benson (executive vice president in London), former Sorenson Capital co-founder and managing director Rich Lawson, and Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young to focus on investments in middle market companies.

== Scientific awards and honors ==
Huntsman has been awarded thirteen honorary doctorate degrees at various universities. In 2004 he received the Othmer Gold Medal, awarded by the Chemical Heritage Foundation in recognition of contributions in research, innovation, legislation or philanthropy. In 2013 he received the Leadership Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Chemical Marketing and Economics (CM&amp;E) group.
In 2015, he received the Bower Award from the Franklin Institute.

==Personal life and death==
Huntsman and his wife, Karen, were married for over 58 years and had nine children: Jon Jr., Peter, Christena, Kathleen ( 2010), David, Paul, James, Jennifer, and Mark. At the time of Huntsman&#x27;s death, they had 56 grandchildren, two of whom were adopted from China and India, and 19 great-grandchildren.

Huntsman&#x27;s eldest son, Jon Jr., also served as a Huntsman Corporation executive. He was elected Governor of Utah in 2004 and was a candidate in the Republican Party presidential primaries in 2012. He has also served in other governmental positions, including as Ambassador of the United States to Singapore, China, and (as of 2017) Russia.

Huntsman&#x27;s second eldest son, Peter, took over as CEO of the Huntsman Corporation in July 2000 and as chairman in January 2018.

On December 8, 1987, Huntsman&#x27;s son, James, then age 16, was kidnapped and held for $1 million ransom by Nicholas Hans Byrd, a former classmate. FBI agents traced the kidnapper and rescued James unharmed, but agent Al Jacobsen was stabbed in the chest during the arrest.

Huntsman has published a book about his life experience, communicating moral lessons. Titled &quot;Winners Never Cheat: Everyday Values We Learned as Children (But May Have Forgotten)&quot;, it was published by Wharton School Publishing in 2005. A second edition, titled &quot;Winners Never Cheat: Even in Difficult Times&quot;, made the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;″s best-sellers list.

Huntsman was a four-time cancer survivor. He died on February 2, 2018, at his home in Salt Lake City.

==Religion==
As a member of the Latter Day Saints (LDS) Church, Huntsman served as an area seventy from 1996 to 2011. He also served as a regional representative, stake president, and as president of the church&#x27;s Washington, D.C. Mission from 1980 to 1983.

==Politics==
In 1977 he was chairman of the Western States Republican Leaders. He was also the Republican Party of Utah national committeeman from 1976 to 1980. He was a friend of conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck and has been interviewed on his show. He was more socially conservative than his son, Jon Huntsman Jr. He was close friends with both Glenn Beck on the right and Harry Reid on the left, who both helped further the mission of Huntsman Cancer Institute.

===Nixon administration===
While the Huntsman Container Corporation&#x27;s first packaging plant was being built in 1970, Huntsman joined the Nixon Administration as Associate Administrator of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and later served as Special Assistant and Staff Secretary to President Nixon. Upon completion of the second Huntsman Container site in Troy, Ohio, in 1972, Huntsman left the White House staff to become President and CEO of Huntsman Container, while still serving – in a non-paid position – as a consultant to the Office of the President.

===Presidential elections===
He served as chairman for Utah in Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1984 and George H. W. Bush&#x27;s campaigns in 1988 and 1992.

===1988 Utah gubernatorial election===
In March 1988, Huntsman announced he would run against incumbent Utah Governor Norm Bangerter in the Republican primary. Huntsman was leading in public opinion polls, sometimes by a double-digit margin. He reportedly raised almost $300,000 in campaign advertising, returning all funds raised back to the donors. A few weeks later, Huntsman went on a 10-day business trip to Asia with his friend, U.S. Senator Jake Garn, who was chairman of Governor Bangerter&#x27;s campaign. In mid-April Huntsman dropped out of the gubernatorial race and endorsed the governor, saying that party unity and his business responsibilities were more important than his political career, and asking political independents to support Bangerter. Later that year, Governor Bangerter appointed Huntsman to be the first Ambassador for Economic Development for the State of Utah.

===Son&#x27;s 2012 Republican presidential campaign===
Huntsman&#x27;s son, Jon Huntsman Jr., served in the administrations of five U.S. Presidents, including Barack Obama (as U.S. Ambassador to China) and most recently Donald Trump (as Ambassador to Russia), and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.

There was considerable speculation that the viability of Jon Huntsman Jr.&#x27;s campaign might depend on Jon Huntsman Sr.&#x27;s willingness to fund advertising for it, via the Superpac &quot;Our Destiny PAC&quot;. Jon Huntsman Jr. reportedly downplayed the possibility of receiving campaign funding from his family before the New Hampshire primary election, telling NPR that &quot;the Huntsman family gives to humanitarian causes and doesn&#x27;t consider a political campaign to be a humanitarian cause&quot;. However, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission later showed that Our Destiny PAC received $2.7 million in contributions, $1.9 million of it from Huntsman Sr. Much of that money was spent on campaign ads, including $914,000 on campaign ads in New Hampshire in the two months before the January primary.

Huntsman Sr. appeared on stage with Jon Huntsman Jr. and his wife and daughters at the third-place finish celebration in Manchester, New Hampshire. Huntsman Jr. announced his intention in Manchester to continue the campaign in South Carolina but dropped out on January 16, in advance of the vote there, throwing his support to Mitt Romney.

==Philanthropy==
Huntsman was widely recognized for his humanitarian giving which, including contributions to the homeless, the ill and the under-privileged, exceeds $1.5 billion and has assisted thousands, both domestically and internationally. &quot;The Chronicle of Philanthropy&quot; placed Jon and Karen Huntsman second on their 2007 list of largest American donors. On January 1, 2000, &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; included him among &quot;The 10 Utahns Who Most Influenced Our State in the 20th Century&quot; for his donations to education and medical research. In 2001 Jon and Karen Huntsman were presented with the Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Principle-Centered Leadership. In 2003 he received the Humanitarian of the Year Award, presented by Larry King of CNN. In November 2008, the American Cancer Society presented him its Medal of Honor for Cancer Philanthropy, and in 2014 he was awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership. In 2015, he was awarded the Philanthropy Roundtable&#x27;s Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy Award.

=== Cancer research ===

One of Huntsman&#x27;s most notable causes is the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, of which he was the founder and principal benefactor. He and his wife Karen established the Huntsman Cancer Institute in 1993 with a gift of $10 million from the Huntsman family. The Huntsmans gave the institute a further $100 million in 1995, an amount roughly equal to a year&#x27;s total distribution to researchers from the American Cancer Society. Their goal was to accelerate the work of curing cancer through human genetics. The institute is now one of America&#x27;s major cancer research centers dedicated to finding a cure for cancer with a state-of-the-art cancer specialty hospital.

The Institute continues to receive substantial gifts from the Huntsman family. Huntsman, a cancer survivor, has stated &quot;Except for my family and faith, there is no cause more important to me than fighting cancer ... I have committed the rest of my life to doing all I can to support clinical and research efforts to eliminate this disease.&quot; To date, the Huntsman family and close associates have donated more than $656 million in support of the mission of HCI.

In November 2013, Huntsman donated or raised $120 million to Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah for the construction of a new research building dedicated to children&#x27;s cancer. The Primary Children&#x27;s and Families&#x27; Cancer Research Center at Huntsman Cancer Institute was dedicated June 21, 2017, Huntsman&#x27;s 80th birthday.

Huntsman also promoted support of the institute through the Sigma Chi fraternity. Sigma Chi chose the Huntsman Cancer Foundation as one of its preferred philanthropic partners in December 2012. As of April 12, 2013, Sigma Chi had raised their first one-million dollars for cancer research. By 2017, Sigma Chi&#x27;s total has reached over five million dollars for cancer research.

===Education===
Huntsman had supported the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in other ways as well. 
The 15,000-seat Jon M. Huntsman Center for special events opened in 1969 and is used for gymnastics, basketball, and volleyball. It has been the site of national championships in both gymnastics and basketball, including NCAA men&#x27;s basketball. As of 2013, the Huntsmans have supported the building of an additional basketball practice facility, to be named the Jon M. and Karen Huntsman Basketball Center.

Huntsman has also given support to other universities. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Overseers of his alma mater, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One of the school&#x27;s signature buildings, Jon Huntsman Hall, was named in his honor. Huntsman made an unrestricted gift of more than $50 million to Wharton, which was critical to development of the $140 million project. As of 1994, the Huntsmans also endowed the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business at the University of Pennsylvania, a four-year undergraduate program that combines business education and liberal arts.

In 1989 Huntsman gave $1 million to Utah State University in Logan, Utah, for the Huntsman Environmental Research Center. At a press conference to announce the gift, Huntsman said the preservation of the environment is the single most important issue in the world. The Huntsmans also donated $500,000 to rebuild the Alumni Center, renamed the David B. Haight Alumni Center in honor of Mrs. Huntsman&#x27;s father. In December 2007, Utah State University announced that its College of Business would be renamed the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business, in recognition of a gift from Huntsman and his wife of $26 million, a major contributor for the new $40 million school of business building referred to as Huntsman Hall—the largest in the university&#x27;s history to that time. In 2017, Huntsman and Charles Koch donated another $50 million to the Huntsman School of Business for student scholarships and a new Center for Growth and Opportunity.

The law library at Brigham Young University, built in 1975, was expanded and renamed for Howard W. Hunter in 1995 with financial support from Jon and Karen Huntsman and other donors. A new library building at Southern Utah University, named in honor of retiring SUU President Gerald R. Sherratt, contains the Jon and Karen Huntsman Reading Room. The Huntsmans also contributed to the Karen H. Huntsman Library in Snow College, Utah. Completed in 2010, it is a &quot;green&quot; building, expected to be the first academic library in the state to achieve gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification.

=== Aid to Armenia ===
Huntsman has also contributed to efforts to rebuild in Armenia, which was devastated by an earthquake in 1988. He and other family members have made 46 trips to Armenia over 25 years. He estimates that he has given at least $50 million to relief efforts in Armenia, including money to build schools and hospitals. One of his earliest projects there involved setting up a plant to make pre-stressed concrete, to supply building materials for reconstruction and to employ Armenians. The Huntsmans have built a tile roofing plant in Yerevan, apartment complexes, and a K-12 school in the city of Gyumri. The Huntsmans also provide scholarships to bring Armenian students to America to study at Utah State University. Huntsman has been granted citizenship in the country and awarded two medals of honor by Armenia, one of them the St. Mesrop Mashtots Order.

Huntsman&#x27;s donations of more than $1.2 billion overall dropped him from the &quot;Forbes 400&quot; list as of 2010. His wealth was not disclosed; however, he was listed as number 937 on the &quot;Forbes World&#x27;s Richest Persons&quot; for 2010. He was one of only 19 of the world&#x27;s 1,200 billionaires to have donated more than $1 billion. He has said that he wants to &quot;die broke&quot; by giving his money away to various charities.

Rocky Anderson, Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City, has said of Huntsman:

==Controversy==
Huntsman contributed to the resignation of the CEO of University of Utah Healthcare (HCI), Vivian Lee, after threatening to withhold $250 million in donations to the Huntsman Cancer Institute and attacking Lee&#x27;s character in the public sphere. Lee resigned after the public backlash she received, particularly from editorials printed in the Salt Lake Tribune, a newspaper owned by the Huntsman family.

In an editorial, Huntsman described Lee as attempting a &quot;power-grab&quot;, while Huntsman was attempting to sever HCI and University of Utah ties. This controversy has raised the question of how much private donors should have a say in publicly funded healthcare.

<doc id="1312205" wikidata="Q7094529" url="?curid=1312205" title="Onrust">
<text>The Onrust (; ) was a Dutch ship built by Adriaen Block and the crew of the &quot;Tyger&quot;, which had been destroyed by fire in the winter of 1613. The &quot;Onrust&quot; was the first ship to be built in what is now New York State, and the first fur trading vessel built in America. The construction took four months in the winter of 1614 somewhere in New York Bay. Help from the local Native population is surmised based on the relationship developed by Jon Rodriquez, left on the island during a previous voyage. The &quot;Onrust&quot; was 44.5 feet long and capable of carrying 16 tons.

In 1614, Block sailed through the whirlpools (Hellegat) on the East River, and into Long Island Sound. There he named Block Island for himself. Block was also the first European to venture up the Connecticut River. He managed to get as far as the Enfield rapids, about 60 miles up the river. Besides finding several inland water routes, creating trading networks and mapping native villages, the two first accurate maps of the east coast were drawn based on the voyages of the &quot;Onrust&quot;. Later in the year, Block rendezvoused with the &quot;Fortuyn&quot;, also under his command, near Cape Cod and sailed back to the Netherlands on 1 October 1614. The &quot;Onrust&quot; was last reported in 1616 as headed to explore the &quot;New River&quot;, now known as the Delaware River under Cornelius Hendrickson.

==Onrust Project==
From 2006 to 2009 the Onrust Project, a non-profit organization, directed by Don Rittner and Greta Wagle, built a replica of the &quot;Onrust&quot; at the Schenectady County Historical Society&#x27;s Mabee Farm Historic Site in Rotterdam Junction, NY. Master shipwright and naval architect Gerald DeWeerdt of the Netherlands, and shipwright Howard Mittleman of North River Restorations in Schenectady, N.Y. led the team of volunteers. 

Construction used both modern power tools and traditional hand tools to build the ship, employing authentic 17th century Dutch ship building techniques rediscovered by ship archeologists in the Netherlands. The material is mostly white oak with pine decking, most of which was sawn nearby by one of the volunteers. The replica is held together by more than 4,000 hand-made black locust tree nails called trunnels and iron rivets. Much of the metal fittings and rivets were hand-made by local blacksmiths of wrought iron; others, as well as cannon, use authentic bronze.

The replica &quot;Onrust&quot; was first launched into the Mohawk River on May 20, 2009, and was able to participate in NY400 that year, commemorating the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson&#x27;s voyage.

<doc id="1312210" wikidata="Q3388866" url="?curid=1312210" title="Rocky Lockridge">
<text>Rick &quot;Rocky&quot; Lockridge (January 10, 1959 – February 7, 2019) was an American professional boxer. He is perhaps best known for having handed Roger Mayweather his first defeat—a first-round knockout in just 98 seconds—earning him the WBA and lineal super featherweight titles. He later won the IBF super featherweight title. He is also known from his 2010 appearance on the A&amp;E television series &quot;Intervention&quot;. He is also known for his crying meme.

==Early life and career==
Rocky Lockridge was born on January 10, 1959, in Tacoma, Washington. After relocating to Paterson, New Jersey, at 19 years old in 1978, he made his debut fight in the professional ring on August 9, defeating Tony Reed by TKO. On September 18, 1979, he defeated Gerald Hayes via unanimous decision to win the New Jersey State Featherweight Championship, and on February 19, 1980, he won by TKO against Fel Clemente to win the USA Featherweight Champion title.

On October 4, 1980, he fought for the WBA World Featherweight title against Eusebio Pedroza, losing by a majority decision; this defeat was Lockridge&#x27;s first in the professional ring. On April 6, 1981, he retained the New Jersey featherweight title by defeating Ernesto Gonzalez by unanimous decision. On August 22, 1981, in a fight for the US featherweight title, he was knocked out by Juan Laporte. On April 24, 1983, he met Pedroza again in the fight for the WBA featherweight title, losing by unanimous decision.

On February 26, 1984, he knocked out the undefeated Roger Mayweather in round one and won the WBA junior-lightweight world championship. After defeating Mayweather, Lockridge and his wife Carolyn moved to Mount Laurel, New Jersey, where they gave birth to twin sons Ricky and Lamar on August 23, 1984. Lockridge made two successful title defenses: on June 12, 1984, he won by TKO in round eleven against Tae Jin Moon, and on January 27, 1985, he won by TKO in round six against Kamel Bou-Ali, a future WBO world junior-lightweight champion himself. However, on May 15 of the same year, he lost the title by majority decision to Wilfredo Gómez.

On August 3, 1986, he lost by majority decision in the fight for the WBC world junior-lightweight title to the undefeated Julio César Chávez. On August 9, 1987, Lockridge defeated Barry Michael after Michael refused to continue the fight after the 8th round and won the IBF world junior-lightweight championship. On October 25, 1987, he defeated Johnny de la Rosa and defended the title, and on April 2, 1988, by unanimous decision, he defeated Harold Knight and again defended his title. On July 23, 1988, he lost by unanimous decision to Tony Lopez and lost his title to the Mexican-American. On March 5, 1989, a rematch took place between Lopez and Lockridge, which ended in the same way as the first fight. After the second defeat to Lopez, Lockridge retired following a victory against Mike Zena in 1989.

==Later years and death==
Lockridge returned with his family to Tacoma in 1991 – 18 months following his retirement from boxing – and he and Carolyn separated shortly thereafter due to financial stress and Rocky&#x27;s drug addiction. 30 months after his original retirement, Lockridge attempted a comeback under new management in Washington, but both his fights in this period ended in losses. In 1993, Lockridge moved to Camden, New Jersey, alone, and he began working as a cleaner and painter for a drum and barrel company in January 1994. Shortly after, he was arrested for burglary and sentenced to five years probation. Three years later, he was arrested on a similar charge and served 27 months in prison before being released in July 1999. Lockridge spent the following years in homelessness, living on a monthly $140 and food stamps provided by the government, as well as pocket change from panhandling. He suffered a stroke in 2006, requiring him to use a cane.

Lockridge was eventually brought by his family onto the A&amp;E television series &quot;Intervention&quot; in 2010. A scene from the episode, in which an emotional Lockridge loudly wails, became an internet meme titled &quot;best cry ever&quot;. Following this appearance, Lockridge spent 90 days in a facility, and had remained sober since. Lockridge died on February 7, 2019, at the age of 60, after being placed on home hospice care following multiple strokes. He was removed from life support about one week prior to his death. In the weeks preceding his death, he was hooked to a feeding tube due to an inability to swallow, and suffered from aspiration pneumonia. His caretaker had set up a GoFundMe to help cover his medical expenses. 
Lockridge is buried at Sunset Memorial Park in Pennsauken, New Jersey.

<text>Hambledon is a small village and civil parish in the county of Hampshire in England, situated about north of Portsmouth within the South Downs National Park.

Hambledon is best known as the &#x27;Cradle of Cricket&#x27;. It is thought that Hambledon Club, one of the oldest cricket clubs known, was formed about 1750. Hambledon was England&#x27;s leading cricket club from about 1765 until the formation of MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club) in 1787.

The famous &quot;Bat and Ball Inn&quot; in Hyden Farm Lane is next to the historic cricket ground at Broadhalfpenny Down where the Hambledon club originally played. The inn was run by Richard Nyren, who was also captain of the club. The modern Hambledon Cricket Club&#x27;s ground is at Ridge Meadow, about 0 away.

Hambledon is a rural village surrounded by fields and woods. There are about 400 households with just under 1,000 residents.
The hamlet of Chidden, north of Hambledon, is in the parish. The nearest villages are Clanfield, Denmead and Soberton.

Due to the climate and location Hambledon also has its very own vineyard, producing its own wine.

==Education==
There is a school, Hambledon Primary School, recently rated as &#x27;Outstanding&#x27; by Ofsted.

==Religious buildings==
The parish church, St Peter&#x27;s and St Paul&#x27;s, has elements that date back to the Saxon period. The church was significantly expanded in the 13th century and a tower was added. The tower was rebuilt at the start of the 17th century and most recently in 1794. The church underwent a restoration in the 1870s. Admiral Sir Erasmus Gower, governor of Newfoundland, is buried in the church. The regimental colours of the Hambledon Volunteers during the Napoleonic Wars hang over the south aisle. The Georgian old Vicarage is Grade II listed and noted for its fine Dutch gables.

==Notable residents==
Hambledon is the place of birth and death of William Lashly (1867–1940), a member of Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s Antarctic expeditions. It is also the home of Sir Guy Salisbury-Jones (1896–1985), an Army general and viticulturalist, who founded the vineyard.

<doc id="1312242" wikidata="Q388471" url="?curid=1312242" title="Doris Ulmann">
<text>Doris Ulmann (May 29, 1882 – August 28, 1934) was an American photographer, best known for her portraits of the people of Appalachia, particularly craftsmen and musicians, made between 1928 and 1934. She collaborated with writer Julia Peterkin on &quot;Roll, Jordan, Roll&quot;.

==Life and career==
Doris Ulmann was a native of New York City, the daughter of Bernhard and Gertrude (Mass) Ulmann. Educated at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, a socially liberal organization that championed individual worth regardless of ethnic background or economic condition and Columbia University, she intended to become a teacher of psychology. Her interest in photography was at first a hobby but after 1918 she devoted herself to the art professionally.
She practiced Pictorialism and was a member of the Pictorial Photographers of America. Ulmann documented the rural people of the South, particularly the mountain peoples of Appalachia and the Gullahs of the Sea Islands, with a profound respect for her sitters and an ethnographer&#x27;s eye for culture. Ulmann was trained as a pictorialist and graduated from the Clarence H. White School of Modern Photography. Other students of the school who went on to become notable photographers include Margaret Bourke-White, Anne Brigman, Dorothea Lange, Paul Outerbridge, and Karl Struss. Her work was exhibited in various New York galleries, and published in &quot;Theatre Arts Monthly&quot;, &quot;Mentor&quot;, &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Survey Graphic&quot;. Ulmann was married for a time to Dr. Charles H. Jaeger, a fellow Pictorialist photographer and an orthopedic surgeon on the staff of Columbia University Medical School and a likely connection for her 1920 Hoeber publication &quot;The Faculty of the College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons, Columbia University in the City of New York: Twenty-Four portraits&quot;. This was followed in 1922 by the publication of her &quot;Book of Portraits of the Medical Faculty of the Johns Hopkins University&quot;; the 1925 &quot;A Portrait Gallery of American Editors&quot;, and in 1933, &quot;Roll, Jordan Roll&quot;, the text by Julia Peterkin. The fine art edition of &quot;Roll, Jordan Roll&quot; is considered to be one of the more beautiful books ever produced.

In an interview with Dale Warren of &quot;Bookman&quot;, Doris Ulmann referred to her particular interest in portraits. &quot;The faces of men and women in the street are probably as interesting as literary faces, but my particular human angle leads me to men and women who write. I am not interested exclusively in literary faces, because I have been more deeply moved by some of my mountaineers than by any literary person. A face that has the marks of having lived intensely, that expresses some phase of life, some dominant quality or intellectual power, constitutes for me an interesting face. For this reason the face of an older person, perhaps not beautiful in the strictest sense, is usually more appealing than the face of a younger person who has scarcely been touched by life.&quot;
Ulmann&#x27;s early work includes a series of portraits of prominent intellectuals, artists and writers: William Butler Yeats, John Dewey, Max Eastman, Sinclair Lewis, Lewis Mumford, Joseph Wood Krutch, Martha Graham, Anna Pavlova, Paul Robeson, and Lillian Gish. From 1927, Ulmann was assisted on her rural travels by John Jacob Niles, a musician and folklorist who collected ballads while Ulmann photographed. In 1932 she was contacted by Orie Latham Hatcher, president of the Southern Woman&#x27;s Educational Alliance, urging her to consider documenting the people of Appalachia for their literature and fundraising, and she accepted the commission. This led to one of her most important images, documenting a racially mixed musical group. Also in 1932 Ulmann began her most important series, assembling documentation of Appalachian folk art and crafts for Allen H. Eaton&#x27;s landmark 1937 book, &quot;Handicrafts of the Southern Highlands&quot;. In failing health, she collapsed in August 1934 while working near Asheville, North Carolina, and returned to New York. Ulmann died August 28, 1934.

Upon Ulmann&#x27;s death, a foundation she had established took custody of her images. Allen Eaton, John Jacob Niles, Olive Dame Campbell (of the John C. Campbell Folk School in Brasstown, North Carolina), Ulmann&#x27;s brother-in-law Henry L. Necarsulmer, and Berea schoolteacher Helen Dingman were named trustees. Samuel H. Lifshey, a New York commercial photographer, developed the negatives Ulmann had exposed during her final trip, and then made proof prints from the vast archive of more than 10,000 glass plate negatives. (Lifshey also developed the 2,000 exposed negatives from Ulmann&#x27;s last expedition, and produced the prints for Eaton&#x27;s book.) The proof prints were mounted into albums, which were annotated by John Jacob Niles and Allen Eaton, chair of the foundation and another noted folklorist, to indicate names of the sitters and dates of capture.

The primary repository of Ulmann&#x27;s work is at the University of Oregon Libraries&#x27; Special Collections. The Doris Ulmann collection, PH038, includes 2,739 silver gelatin glass plate negatives, 304 original matted prints, and 79 albums (containing over 10,000 Lifshey proof prints) assembled by the Doris Ulmann Foundation between 1934 and 1937. The silver gelatin glass plate negatives are the only known remaining Ulmann negatives. Of the 304 matted photographs, approximately half are platinum prints that were mounted and signed by Ulmann; the others are silver gelatin prints developed by Lifshey. Berea College hosts a collection of over 3100 images, primarily of the Appalachian region and the Berea area. Additional collections can be found at The University of Kentucky (consisting of 16 original signed portraits, and 186 original silver nitrate prints), the North Carolina Collection Photographic Archives (consisting of 5 black and white prints focusing on North Carolina), the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, and the New York Historical Society (primarily of prominent New Yorkers). As art objects, her photographs are also part of many museum collections including the Smithsonian and the J. Paul Getty Museum.

The Georgia Museum of Art at the University of Georgia organized a major retrospective of her work in 2018 and published the largest book on her work to date. The Library of Congress Prints &amp; Photographs Division holds more than 150 photographic prints by Ulmann.

<text>Gunnison Beach is a beach within the Sandy Hook unit of the Fort Hancock and the Sandy Hook Proving Ground Historic District which is the Sandy Hook Unit of Gateway National Recreation Area, on the Atlantic coast of New Jersey. It is located in Middletown Township, Monmouth County, but is on federal land managed by the National Park Service. It is New Jersey&#x27;s only legal clothing-optional beach. It takes its name from adjacent Battery Gunnison, which visitors must pass next to in order to get to and from the beach.

==History==
Gunnison Beach takes its name purely out of convenience: Battery Gunnison, a Coastal Artillery fortification built by the U.S. Army in 1904 to protect New York Harbor at Fort Hancock, New Jersey. The Battery, which has been undergoing an extensive restoration to its c. 1943 configuration since 2003, sits directly next to the Gunnison Beach walkway that leads out to the ocean. Beach goers and visitors must pass directly next to the Battery&#x27;s Number 2 Gun Emplacement to walk out to the ocean. Known as Battery Gunnison / New Peck following a weapons conversion in 1943, it is part of Fort Hancock, the largest US Army Coast Artillery fort on the eastern seaboard. The Sandy Hook Proving Ground, the first of its kind in the nation, operated at Fort Hancock / Sandy Hook from 1874 to 1919. The U.S. Army manned Fort Hancock as a Coast Artillery post from 1890 to 1948. It was then armed with conventional anti-aircraft guns from 1950 to 1954, when it became the site of a Nike missile defense installation. The Fort closed in 1974, and was ceded to the National Park Service as a unit of Gateway National Recreation Area. Contrary to popular belief and urban legend, there was no nude bathing en masse on the part of the United States Army garrison that led to the formation of the nude beach. It was the discovery of Gunnison Beach&#x27;s natural seclusion by park visitors in the late 1970s and early 1980s that led to its inception as a nude beach.

In 1999, New Jersey passed a law that allows municipalities and counties to prohibit all types of nudism on state or local beaches in their jurisdiction. Gunnison Beach, however, is on land owned and managed by the federal government and therefore is not subject to state or local regulations. As a result, Gunnison became the only legal nude beach in the state. Gunnison is the largest clothing-optional recreation area on the East Coast. The clothing optional beach, which offers dramatic views of Brooklyn and the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, attracts nearly 5,000 naturists per weekend in the summer months. From May through September, daily ferry service is available from Manhattan to the Sandy Hook Ferry Landing, with a free shuttle service that stops at all the beaches of Sandy Hook. Gunnison Beach is among the most popular choices, especially on weekends. Part of the beach is shared on a seasonal basis with a reserved breeding ground for the endangered piping plover, a native shore bird.

<text>In filmmaking, behind-the-scenes (BTS), also known as the making-of, the set, or on the set, is a type of documentary film that features the production of a film or television program. This is often referred to as the EPK (electronic press kit) video, due to its main usage as a promotional tool, either concurrent with theatrical release or as a bonus feature for the film&#x27;s DVD or Blu-ray release.

==History==
Shorter behind-the-scenes documentaries are often used as a bonus on DVDs, as it offers more insight into the film, how it was made, and to credit the film crew. Occasionally, some films have included a &quot;making of the making-of&quot; as a joke. The making-of is also often released for TV as a part of the promotion of the film.

==Feature-length examples==
*&quot;Burden of Dreams&quot;, the &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; making-of 
*&quot;Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot;, the &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; making-of 
*&quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot;, a making-of documentary of the failed &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot;, which was eventually completed more than 15 years later

<doc id="1312280" wikidata="Q29811838" url="?curid=1312280" title="Double reed">
<text>A double reed is a type of reed used to produce sound in various wind instruments. In contrast with a single reed instrument, where the instrument is played by channeling air against one piece of cane which vibrates against the mouthpiece and creates a sound, a double reed features two pieces of cane vibrating against each other. This means, for instruments with the double reed fully exposed, that the air flow can be controlled by the embouchure from the top, bottom and sides of the reed. The term &quot;double reeds&quot; can also refer collectively to the class of instruments which use double reeds.

==Structure and dimensions==
The size and shape of the reed depend on the type of double-reed instrument which is of two groups, conical and cylindrical. Even within families of instruments, for example, the oboe family, the reed for the oboe is quite different from that for the cor anglais (English horn).

Oboe reeds are usually 7 mm (0.3 in) in width, while bassoon reeds are wider, from 13.5 to 15.9 mm (0.53–0.63 in). Since the width of a reed affects its sound and response, reed makers experiment constantly to achieve the results they desire. Reed length, which broadly affects pitch, is much less consistent globally, as different orchestras tune to different frequencies. Auxiliary double reeds such as English horn and contrabassoon have their own sets of measurements, which are subject to the requirements of the player.

==Materials==
For the reeds of European instruments, cane from &quot;Arundo donax&quot;, a wetland reed species traditionally from southern France, is commonly used. The reeds of non-European instruments can be made from similar wetland grasses, bamboo or young leaves from toddy palm trees. For example, the reed of Japan&#x27;s hichiriki can be made from either mountain bitter bamboo or &quot;Phragmites australis&quot;, the latter is a softer cane than &quot;Arundo donax&quot;. When soft materials are used, adding layers to the reed can increase the stiffness while also maintain suppleness; for example, Myanmar&#x27;s hne reed can have up to six layers of leaves from the palmyra palm tree which technically transform the double reed into a sextuple reed. 

It is also possible to make reeds from synthetic materials such as polypropylene, which tend to last longer because they are less sensitive to temperature and humidity fluctuations. However, since the tone quality is dissimilar to that of a cane reed, synthetic reeds are not favoured by professional musicians.

==Construction==
A variety of tools are used for splitting, chopping, gouging and shaping the cane in the reed-making process. 

===Example: Bassoon===
For bassoon reeds, tubes of cane are first split lengthwise then gouged to a certain thickness using a gouging machine. The chosen piece of cane is then cut to shape using a flat shaper and the centre portion is thinned (profiled) using a profiling machine which could be as simple as a wooden dowel and scraping knife to sophisticated machines with planes on a rod and a barrel to hold the cane that has accuracy down to .001&quot; . The cane is folded end to end to form the two blades of the reed. The unprofiled end of the cane is shaped into a tube with the aid of a mandrel and bound with three (or four in some reed making techniques) strategically placed wires. A turban made out of thread is added on the third wire. It provides a hand hold for the reed that is not a sharp wire. The folded tip is cut off to allow the blades to vibrate and final adjustments to the interior of the reed using a reamer to precisely finish the tube to fit the bocal dimensions, and to the exterior (blade) using a reed-scraping knife or tip profiler, are carried out. The reed is then ready to fit to the bocal of the bassoon. The parts of the bassoon reed starting at the tip are: tip, blade, collar (where the profiled cane ends and throat begins), throat, 1st wire, 2nd wire (where throat ends and tube begins), 3rd wire, and butt (where the tube ends).

===Example: Oboe===
The construction of double reeds for the oboe family of instruments is similar in principle: like the bassoon&#x27;s reeds, they consist of two pieces of cane fastened together with an opening at the tip. However, because the oboe does not have a bocal, the cane must be fastened to a metal tube (the staple), the lower half of which is normally surrounded by a piece of cork. The staple is then inserted into the farrow at the upper end of the oboe.

===Ready-made reeds===
Players can buy reeds either ready-made, or in various stages of formation, such as part-scraped, reed blanks, or buy the staples and cane separately. Cane is sold in several forms: as tubes, gouged, gouged and shaped, or gouged and shaped and profiled. Bassoon cane has the further option of being profiled before purchase. There are also many options with regard to staples and shaping equipment, which all have a subtle effect on the tone quality a reed will produce.

===Reed variability===
Differences in reed construction that may be visually minor can have a substantial impact on the sound produced by the reed, and as a consequence professional double-reed players must exercise meticulous craftsmanship in creating a suitable-sounding reed for whatever repertoire they are playing, with yet further considerations such as whether the player is principal or sectional, or whether the reed will be suitable for every item on the program. Environmental factors such as humidity and temperature also affect the performance of a double reed. Adjustments to reeds are, consequently, very frequent among double-reed musicians.

The reedmaking culture varies between countries, cities, and individuals, and the reedmaker accepts that the life of each reed is extremely short. Among oboists, there are several distinct schools of reedmaking, notatably the American and European schools. American, or &quot;long scrape&quot; reeds feature two visible &quot;windows&quot; of removed cane separated by a central spine, whereas European or &quot;short scrape&quot; reeds typically feature a more homogenous, tapered thickness across the entire reed. The construction of the American reed can help facilitate a &quot;darker&quot; timbre, whereas European reeds may foster a &quot;brighter&quot; sound. 

==Playing==
The orchestral double reeds all employ a similar embouchure. Players pull their lips over their teeth to protect the reed from their teeth, and then vibrate the blades of the reed by blowing, while controlling the timbre and pitch with constant micromuscular pressure adjustments from the muscles of the mouth and jaw. Articulation is achieved by occluding the mouth of the reed with the tongue and then releasing it, with extended techniques such as double tongue, flutter tongue and growl all possible as on the other woodwind families.

The principal difference between double-reed embouchures – both between and within instrument families – is in the positioning of the rolled-in lips, and the musculature employed to control a sound. Oboe reeds, being much longer relative to their width, require concentrated pressure near the tip with more pressure from the sides of the mouth, whereas bassoon reeds are played with lips slightly more pouted and not necessarily aligned vertically. Similarly, the Armenian duduk does not require rolled-in lips and the control of the air flow is distributed toward the lower half of the cheeks.

All double-reed players employ and develop muscles at the back of the mouth to control their intonation via adjustments to the shape and pressure of the oral cavity surrounding the reed.

==Instruments==
===Period===
There are three main groups of instruments based on the methods of playing: blowing directly into the reed, partially blowing into the reed, and not blowing directly into the reed.

<doc id="1312282" wikidata="Q608288" url="?curid=1312282" title="Deadlift">
<text>The deadlift is a strength training exercise in which a weight-loaded barbell is lifted off the ground to the level of the hips, with the torso perpendicular to the floor, before being placed back on the ground. It is one of the three powerlifting movements along with the squat and bench press, as well as a quintessential lift in strongman. The all-time world record deadlift stands at , achieved by Iceland&#x27;s Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson.

Two styles of deadlift are commonly used in competition settings: the conventional deadlift and the sumo deadlift. While both of these styles are permitted under the rules of powerlifting, only the conventional stance is permitted in strongman. 

==Execution==
===Form===
The conventional deadlift can be broken down into three phases: the setup, the initial pull or drive, and the lockout.
Setup: When performing a deadlift, a lifter sets in a position that eccentrically loads the gluteus maximus, gluteus minimus, trapezius, biceps femoris, semitendinosus and semimembranosus while the muscles of the lumbar contract isometrically in an effort to stabilize the spine.
* The lifter sets behind the bar with it nearly touching the legs (roughly 1 inch away from the shin), with feet pointed forward.
* Then he hinges at the hips and bend the knees, maintaining flat feet, allowing the shins move forward to touch the barbell but not push it away.
* The lifter grips the bar outside of the legs, roughly at shoulder width.
* Next he raises the chest to position to maintain a neutral spine throughout the lift.
* Then he pulls the slack out of the barbell

Drive: The next section of the deadlift produces the greatest amount of force. By pushing down through their heels while simultaneously pushing up and forward with their hips and maintaining a depressed scapula and a long tense spine, an individual can remain safe during this motion. This is considered the most difficult part of the entire movement due to the amount of work required to drive the bar off the ground.

* The lifter takes a deep diaphragmatic breath and holds it in during the movement, creating an outward pressure on the core to further stabilize the lumbopelvic hip complex and core throughout the motion.
* He keeps the muscles of the back contracted tightly in order to maintain a neutral spine throughout the motion.
* Then he drives up and forward with the hips and legs to stand erect. 
Lockout: The finish is the most critical aspect of the motion. This requires being totally erect with a neutral spine and forceful hip extension to engage the muscles of the lumbar spine and abdomen in unison with the glutes.

* The lifter drives the hips completely into the bar.
* Then he contracts the glutei and the rectus abdominis to finish the movement with the pelvis in a neutral position. Contracting the glutes as well as the abdominal muscles is critical for lower back health and safety.

Lowering the weight: Simply, performing the above steps in reverse order. As the muscles of the back and core must remain tight throughout the motion, one should simply hinge at the hips and knees to bring the weight down in powerlifting. However in strongman, it is not mandatory to lower the weight in such form.

===Bars and weights===
Deadlifts can be performed using barbells (including standard deadlift bars such as Texas power bar and Ohio power bar, stiff bars such as S-cubed bar and Axle bar, and long bars such as Elephant bar and Kratos bar) loaded with standard plates or other odd implements such as tires. Whenever standard 45 lb or 20 kg plates are used, the bar is situated exactly 9 inches above the floor. Deadlifts can also be performed using dumbbells, or kettlebells either with both arms or occasionally with one arm, and similarly with both or only one leg. Other variations include side handled deadlift or suitcase deadlift, elevated deadlifts or rack pulls, deficit deadlift or deadlift from a platform, paused deadlift and deadlift static hold.

Each of these variations is called for to address specific weaknesses in a lifter&#x27;s overall deadlift. For instance, if the lifter has difficulty breaking contact at max weight, deficit deadlifts are performed to strengthen the gluteus maximus and hamstrings due to the greater range of motion required by standing on a platform. On the other hand, if the lifter has difficulty locking out, rack pulls are performed to strengthen the upper back, posterior deltoids, and trapezius.

Chains and resistance bands can also be attached to either end of the barbell in order to increase or decrease resistance at different phases of the lift, for a &#x27;variable resistance deadlift&#x27;.

===Raw vs. Equipped===
Depending on the sport, the definition of raw deadlifting varies. In Powerlifting, raw allows only the use of a lifting belt while in Strongman, raw means the disallowance of a deadlift suit, or in other words you are allowed to use lifting straps in addition to a belt. In equipped lifting, irrespective of the sport, you are allowed to use a deadlift suit, which is an elastic clothing made from very tight material. The suit tightens on the squat on the way down, storing energy, that gives an extra boost with the stored tension to break the floor. The suits are also of two different types: single ply (one layer) and multi ply (two or more layers). The assistance increase as the number of layers increase.

Straps can help in a deadlift if the grip is the limiting factor. Standard figure 6 straps are allowed in most strongman competitions while figure 8 straps are also allowed in some competitions. The latter allows the lifter to hold the bar in their fingertips and can reduce the distance travelled by over an inch.

===Grips===

Typically, there are three grips used: overhand (pronated) grip, a mixed overhand-underhand (supinated) (sometimes called &quot;alternating&quot;, &quot;mixed&quot;, &quot;offset&quot; or &quot;staggered&quot; ) grip, or a hook grip. Depending on forearm and grip strength, the overhand grip may result in the bar potentially rolling about. Mixed grip is capable of neutralizing this through &#x27;reverse torsion&#x27;. The mixed grip also allows more weight to be held for this reason. In order to prevent the bar from rolling out of the hands, some lifters use a technique called hook grip. This is similar to an overhand grip, but the thumbs are inside, allowing the lifter to &#x27;hook&#x27; onto them with the fingers. It makes it easier to hold heavier weights using less grip strength, and takes much of the stress off the joints which is created by the twisting of a mixed grip, but comes with the disadvantage of being extremely painful for the thumbs.

Some powerlifters adopt the overhand grip for their lower weight sets and move to the mixed grip to lift larger weights so they can achieve their one rep max. Most Strongmen use the overhand grip with the allowed straps. Sometimes, a neutral grip can be achieved by the use of a trap bar; which is a hexagonal shaped bar which the lifter stands inside whilst holding the two side handles. The neutral grip provides the lifter with slightly different posturing which can help reduce the risk of injury.

===Muscles involved===
A barbell deadlift is a compound exercise and works the gluteus maximus with further work on the quadriceps femoris, hamstrings, trapezius, lats, and erector spinae. The quadriceps, hamstrings, adductor magnus, and soleus serve as synergists during the exercise. For the powerlifting deadlift (where lifting straps are not allowed), the grip strength is also a decisive factor.

==Other deadlift variations==
There are also numerous variations of the standard deadlift.

Partial deadlift – This is where the range of movement (ROM) of the lift is reduced in order to train a particular part of it. Usually, this involves lifting from a higher starting position. This may be facilitated through the use of blocks or pins in a power rack. When considered in regard to the ROM of a normal deadlift, this means that the lift begins in a higher and stronger phase, avoids a lower and weaker phase, and thereby allows for more weight to be lifted. This can lead to increased strength gains. A partial repetition deadlift may also only involve working in the lower weaker phase, in order to improve the amount if strength that can be applied there and help to overcome any sticking points.

Single leg deadlift – This is a deadlift where one foot is on the ground and the other is raised. The grounded leg is primarily used to lift the weight and power the movement. The raised leg is roughly parallel with the straight grounded leg when the weight is lifted, and moves behind when the weight is lowered and the person bends over. As a unilateral, single leg exercise, it utilises the hips more so than if it was performed in a bilateral manner. It also means that the balance and core stability requirements are increased and this can lead to improvements in this regard.

Romanian deadlift (RDL) – Unlike conventional deadlifts where the barbell starts on the floor, in RDLs, the barbell is lifted from a standing position, and the movement focuses on hinging at the hips while maintaining a slight bend in the knees. The emphasis is on keeping the back flat and engaging the hamstrings and glutes to lift the weight as the hips are pushed back. RDLs are particularly effective for improving hip hinge mechanics, strengthening the hamstrings and glutes, and enhancing overall posterior chain development. They are often used in strength training and sports performance programs to improve functional movement patterns and athletic performance. RDLs can also be performed with implements like dumbbells and kettlebells.

B Stance Romanian Deadlift (B-Stance RDL) – A b-stance RDL replicates the movement of a standard RDL and a single leg RDL. Using either a dumbbell or barbell the weight starts at a standing position and the movement focuses on the hip hinge movement while maintaining a flat back and slight bent at the knees. Taking your standard RDL form you slide one leg back with the front leg acting as the working leg and taking most of the lead the back leg is for stabilization. While not a complete unilateral movement as the supporting leg provides assistance it still targets glutes, hamstrings and erector spine. 
Trap bar deadlift – This involves the use of a trap bar (a.k.a. hex bar) which is a hexagonal or octagonal bar within which the user stands. The handles are positioned at the side, which means that a neutral grip, with the palms of the hand turned inward, can be used. This alters the ROM of the lift and generally makes it less taxing on the lower back and reduces the risk of injury. Usually, there are two pairs of handles with one pair positioned higher, making the lift relatively easier, and the other lower, making the lift relatively harder. The ROM of the trap bar deadlift means that a greater level of power can be generated in comparison to a traditional deadlift or squat. A similar exercise which also involves enhanced levels of power production is the trap bar jump i.e. a vertical jump while holding a trap bar.

Stiff leg deadlift (SLDL) – This emphasizes hamstring development and lower back resilience. Similar to the conventional deadlift setup, it requires standing with feet shoulder-width apart, hinging at the hips. Contrary to its name, the legs are not fully straightened during the movement. Instead, the emphasis lies on minimizing knee bend while pushing the hips back, creating a parallel alignment of the torso to the ground. SLDL reduces quad engagement, intensifies the demand on the lower back, and challenges the hamstrings from a lengthened position. While it may not accommodate heavy loads like standard deadlifts, it serves as a valuable exercise for individuals seeking targeted hamstring engagement and lower back resilience within their routine.

==Common errors==
There are a few common errors during the performance of the deadlift. Protracting the shoulders disengages the back muscles which stabilize the spine. Slack should be taken from the bar prior to the lift, by squeezing the back muscles first and straightening the arms; the bar should then be lifted in a smooth motion without jerking. As the objective of a deadlift is to hinge the hips, the knees should not be bent so deeply as to form a squat. If the bar is too far from the lifter, the lifter may compensate by rounding the back or shifting the weight to the front of the foot. Both result in shifting which muscles are used and could cause injury. Rounding the back in general is controversial; it is often recommended that during the lift, the back is flat with a spine neutral. Some lifters prefer to slightly round their back; but an excessively rounded back may result in the load being lifted awkwardly and placing too much stress or pressure on the back, which may lead to injury. The knees should be bent more fully on the descent of the bar to preserve a neutral spine.

<text>The Official Language Act of 1974 (), also known as Bill 22, was an act of the National Assembly of Quebec, commissioned by Premier Robert Bourassa, which made French the sole official language of Quebec, Canada. Provincial desire for the &quot;Official Language Act&quot; came after the repeal of Bill 63. It was ultimately supplanted by the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; (also known as Bill 101) in 1977, which imposed French as the only language for advertising and education (with many exceptions).

== Contents ==

The legislation was drafted in an attempt to follow the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry on the Situation of the French Language and Linguistic Rights in Quebec. The act made French the official language in a number of areas:

*Language of services (had to be primarily offered in French)
*Language of commercial signing (the use of French was required)
*Language of labour relations and business (businesses wanting to deal with the state had to apply for francization programs, French had to be included in all labels and communications, and products and services needed French marketing materials).
*Language of instruction (English-language public school was restricted to children who had a &quot;sufficient&quot; knowledge of this language)
*Language of legislation and justice (priority was given to French texts in case of ambiguity).

== Opposition ==
That English was an official language in Quebec as well was declared on July 19, 1974, by McGill University law faculty&#x27;s most expert counsellors, disputing Bill 22. The testifiers were Dean Frank R. Scott; John Peters Humphrey, the chief planner of the United Nations&#x27; Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Irwin Cotler; and four additional legal teachers:

Section 1, which provides that French is &#x27;the official language of the province of Quebec,&#x27; is misleading in that it suggests that English is not also an official language in Quebec, which it is by virtue of Section 133 of the &quot;BNA Act&quot; and the federal &quot;Official Languages Act&quot;. ... No legislation in the National Assembly proclaiming French the sole official language in the province can affect these bilingual areas protected by the &quot;BNA Act&quot;.

John Ciaccia and George Springate were suspended from the Liberal caucus for almost two months in 1974 for voting with the Opposition when the Robert Bourassa government passed Bill 22.

<doc id="1312287" wikidata="Q4284934" url="?curid=1312287" title="Macrocell array">
<text>== Macrocell arrays in PLDs ==

Programmable logic devices, such as programmable array logic and complex programmable logic devices, typically have a macrocell on every output pin.

== Macrocell arrays in ASICs ==

A macrocell array is an approach to the design and manufacture of ASICs. Essentially, it is a small step up from the otherwise similar gate array, but rather than being a prefabricated array of simple logic gates, the macrocell array is a prefabricated array of higher-level logic functions such as flip-flops, ALU functions, registers, and the like. These logic functions are simply placed at regular predefined positions and manufactured on a wafer, usually called master slice. Creation of a circuit with a specified function is accomplished by adding metal interconnects to the chips on the master slice late in the manufacturing process, allowing the function of the chip to be customised as desired.

Macrocell array master slices are usually prefabricated and stockpiled in large quantities regardless of customer orders. The fabrication according to the individual customer specifications may be finished in a shorter time compared with standard cell or full custom design. The macrocell array approach reduces the mask costs since fewer custom masks need to be produced. In addition manufacturing test tooling lead time and costs are reduced since the same test fixtures may be used for all macrocell array products manufactured on the same die size.

Drawbacks are somewhat low density and performance than other approaches to ASIC design. However this style is often a viable approach for low production volumes.

A standard cell library is sometimes called a &quot;macrocell library&quot;.

<doc id="1312292" wikidata="Q959163" url="?curid=1312292" title="Politics of the European Union">
<text>The political structure of the European Union (EU) is similar to a confederation, where many policy areas are federalised into common institutions capable of making law; the competences to control foreign policy, defence policy, or the majority of direct taxation policies are mostly reserved for the twenty-seven state governments (the Union does limit the level of variation allowed for VAT). These areas are primarily under the control of the EU&#x27;s member states although a certain amount of structured co-operation and coordination takes place in these areas. For the EU to take substantial actions in these areas, all Member States must give their consent. Union laws that override State laws are more numerous than in historical confederations; however, the EU is legally restricted from making law outside its remit or where it is no more appropriate to do so at a state or local level (subsidiarity) when acting outside its exclusive competences. The principle of subsidiarity does not apply to areas of exclusive competence.

The common institutions mix the intergovernmental and supranational (similar to federal) aspects of the EU. The EU treaties declare the Union to be based on representative democracy, and direct elections take place in the European Parliament. The Parliament, together with the Council, form the legislative arm of the EU. The council is composed of state governments, thus representing the intergovernmental nature of the EU. Laws are proposed by the European Commission which is appointed by and accountable to the Parliament and Council although it has very few executive powers.

Although direct elections take place every five years, there are no cohesive political parties in the national sense. Instead, there are alliances of ideologically associated parties who sit and vote together in Parliament. The two largest parties are the European People&#x27;s Party (centre-right, mostly Christian Democrat) and the Party of European Socialists (centre-left, mostly Social Democrat) with the former forming the largest group in Parliament since 1999. As well as there being left and right dividing lines in European politics, there are also divides between those for and against European integration (Pro-Europeanism and Euroscepticism) which shapes the continually changing nature of the EU which adopts successive reforming treaties. The latter was a significant political force in the United Kingdom in the decades and years before leaving the Union, and some member states are less integrated than others due to legal opt-outs.

==Legal basis==
The democratic legitimation of the European Union rests on the Treaty System. The move toward unification first arose in the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928, which gained adherent countries during negotiations and took on a theme of integration for the achievement of peace between the Great Powers. After the Second World War, European society sought to end conflict permanently between states, seeing the rivalry between France and Germany as the most worrying example. In the spirit of the Marshall Plan, those two states signed the Treaty of Paris in 1951, establishing the European Coal and Steel Community. Since then, the Treaty of Paris, which focused on price setting and competition for purposes of a common market, has been superseded. The legal basis for the European Community now rests on two treaties: the Treaty of Rome of 1958; and the Treaty of Maastricht of 1992. The various additions and modifications of treaties has led to a patchwork of policy and planning, which contributes to the unwieldiness of the EU. The pastiche of treaties, and not a single actualising charter of government, form the constitutional basis of the European Union. This ambiguity is what critics call a primary cause of &quot;democratic deficit.&quot;

The EU itself is a legal personality and a set of governing institutions empowered by the treaties. However sovereignty is not invested in those institutions, it is &quot;pooled&quot; with ultimate sovereignty resting with the state governments. Yet in those areas where the EU has been granted competences, it does have the power to pass binding and direct laws upon its members.

===Competences===

The competences of the European Union stem from the original Coal and Steel Community, which had as its goal an integrated market. The original competences were regulatory in nature, restricted to matters of maintaining a healthy business environment. Rulings were confined to laws covering trade, currency, and competition. Increases in the number of EU competences result from a process known as functional spillover. Functional spillover resulted in, first, the integration of banking and insurance industries to manage finance and investment. The size of the bureaucracies increased, requiring modifications to the treaty system as the scope of competences integrated more and more functions. While member states hold their sovereignty inviolate, they remain within a system to which they have delegated the tasks of managing the marketplace. These tasks have expanded to include the competences of free movement of persons, employment, transportation, and environmental regulation.

===Law===
====Types of legislation====

The Ordinary Legislative Procedure (OLP) is the formal, main legislative procedure. In OLP, the European Parliament (EP) and the Council act in much the same way as a bicameral congress, such as the British Upper and Lower Houses or the American Congress. The co-decision rule in Maastricht, and the subsequent Lisbon Treaty, ultimately gave the EP and the Council equal weight and formalised OLP as the main legislative procedure. It also gives the EP veto power. The two legislative powers of the OLP are directives and regulations. A directive requires the member states to pass the new law individually, a process called &quot;transposition.&quot; The difference in the timing of completing transposition is the &quot;democratic deficit.&quot; A regulation acts on all the member states at once and is effective immediately.

The other legislation option is the Special Legislative Procedure (SLP). The SLP consists of the passing of laws proposed by member states, the Central Bank or Investment Bank, or the Court of Justice. Judicial activism—the interpretation of the spirit of law rather than the letter of law—is handled by the SLP. The procedure is discussed either in the EP with consultation with the council, or in the council with participation of the EP. In other words, the consultative role stops short of the equal weight given to both the EP and the council. While provided for in the treaties, the SLP is not as formal as the OLP, relying less on the hierarchical structure. This lends more credence to Kleine&#x27;s argument of the contrariness of the EU&#x27;s agenda-setting procedure.

====Mechanics of legislation====

In the OLP, there are four types of rulings: Regulations, Directives, Decisions, and Recommendations. Decision-making is shared by the European Parliament and the council, which are equally weighted. 
Regulations are binding on all member states effective immediately. 
Directives are binding on all member states, but the implementation is left up to the national courts in a process called transposition. However, since member states set their own timelines for transposition, there is a democratic deficit between states. 
Decisions are binding on non-state litigants to whom they are addressed.
Recommendations are intended to guide legal judgments and are non-binding, similar to opinions.

In the SLP, the council is the sole ruling body. The European Parliament is involved strictly in a consultative role and can be ignored.

==Member states==

There are twenty-seven member states who have conferred powers upon the EU institutions (other countries are tied to the EU in other ways). In exchange for conferring competences, EU states are assigned votes in the Council, seats in Parliament and a European Commissioner among other things. The internal government of member states vary between presidential systems, monarchies, federations, and microstates however all members must respect the Copenhagen criteria of being democratic, respecting human rights and having a free market economy. Members joined over time, starting with the original six in 1958 and more members joining in the near future.

Some member states are outside certain areas of the EU, for example the eurozone is composed of only 20 of the 27 members and the Schengen Agreement currently includes only 23 of the EU members. However, the majority of these are in the process of joining these blocs. A number of countries outside the EU are involved in certain EU activities such as the euro, Schengen, single market or defence.

==Institutions==
The primary institutions of the European Union are the European Commission, the Council of the European Union (Council), the European Council and the European Parliament.

The ordinary legislative procedure, applies to nearly all EU policy areas. Under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the council. They then send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a &quot;common position&quot;. That proposal may either be approved or further amendments may be tabled by the Parliament. If the Council does not approve those, then a &quot;Conciliation Committee&quot; is formed. The committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a common position. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament again by an absolute majority. There are other special procedures used in sensitive areas which reduce the power of Parliament.

===Parliament===
The &quot;European Parliament&quot; shares the legislative and budgetary authority of the Union with the council. Its 720 members are elected every five years by universal suffrage and sit according to political allegiance. It represents all European Citizens in the EU&#x27;s legislative process, in contrast to the council, which represents the Member States. Despite forming one of the two legislative chambers of the Union, it has weaker powers than the Council in some limited areas, and does not have legislative initiative. It does, however, have powers over the Commission which the Council does not. The powers of the Parliament have increased substantially over the years, and in nearly all areas it now has equal power to the council.

===European Council===

The &quot;European Council&quot; is the group of heads of state or government of the EU member states. It meets four times a year to define the Union&#x27;s policy agenda and give impetus to integration. The President of the European Council is the person responsible for chairing and driving forward the work of the institution, which has been described as the highest political body of the European Union.

===Council of the European Union===

The &quot;Council of the European Union&quot; (informally known as the Council of Ministers or just the council) is a body holding legislative and some limited executive powers and is thus the main decision-making body of the Union. Its Presidency rotates between the states every six months. The council is composed of twenty-eight national ministers (one per state). However, the Council meets in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture is being discussed, the council will be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represent their governments and are accountable to their national political systems. Votes are taken either by majority or unanimity with votes allocated according to population.

===Commission===

The &quot;European Commission&quot; is composed of one appointee from each state, currently twenty-seven, but is designed to be independent of national interests. The body is responsible for drafting all law of the European Union and has a monopoly over legislative initiative. It also deals with the day-to-day running of the Union and has a duty to uphold the law and treaties (in this role it is known as the &quot;Guardian of the Treaties&quot;).

The commission is led by a President who is nominated by the council (in practice the European Council) and approved by Parliament. The remaining twenty-seven Commissioners are nominated by member-states, in consultation with the President, and has their portfolios assigned by the President. The Council then adopts this list of nominee-Commissioners. The council&#x27;s adoption of the commission is not an area which requires the decision to be unanimous, their acceptance is arrived at according to the rules for qualified majority voting. The European Parliament then interviews and casts its vote upon the Commissioners. The interviews of individual nominees are conducted separately, in contrast to Parliament&#x27;s vote of approval which must be cast on the commission as a whole without the ability to accept or reject individual Commissioners. Once approval has been obtained from the Parliament the Commissioners can take office. The current president is Ursula von der Leyen (EPP); she was elected in 2019.

==Elections==

Direct elections take place to the European Parliament every five years. The Council and European Council is composed of nationally elected or appointed officials and thus are accountable according to national procedures. The commission also is not directly elected although future appointments of the President must take into account of results of Parliament&#x27;s elections.

Parliament&#x27;s elections are held by universal suffrage of EU citizens according to national restrictions (such as age and criminal convictions). Proportional representation is used in all parliamentary constituencies. Members of the European Parliament cannot also be elected nationally and are elected in national or sub-national constituencies. The first such election was in 1979, and the latest election was in 2024. The turnout was steadily falling in every EU election since 1979, until 2019, where it increased 8 pp from 42.6% to 50.7%, and then again in 2024 by 0.39 pp to 51.05%

As of 2024, Bulgaria&#x27;s (GERB, Croatia&#x27;s (HDZ), Cyprus (DISY), Germany&#x27;s (CDU/CSU), Hungary&#x27;s (Fidesz), Malta&#x27;s (Labour Party) and Sweden (Swedish Social Democratic have won every EU election.
===Political parties===

Political parties across member states organise themselves with like-minded parties into European political parties. Most national parties are now members of a European political party. European parties behave and operate to a certain extent like national parties, receive public funding from the European Union, and put forward manifestos during the campaigns for the European elections.

European parties are horizontally present in all the main institutions – Council, Commission, Parliament – but are most active through their political groups of the European Parliament. At the beginning of every parliamentary term, European parties organise themselves, including with non-member national parties or independent candidates, to form a political group. No European party has ever held a majority in the European Parliament, however this does not have a great impact, as European parties or groups do not form a government; however, pro-European political parties usually agree among themselves to elect the President of the European Parliament.

==Foreign affairs==
The EU&#x27;s chief diplomat, sometimes dubbed its foreign minister, is the High Representative, Kaja Kallas.
The foreign policy of the European Union is characterised as being:
* Multi-facet as it is carried out through different venues namely the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP)(Title V, TEU), the external dimension of internal policies and the External Action of the EU (Part Three with Titles I, III, V, VIII, XIX, XX, XXI and Part Five with Titles II, III, IV and V of the TFEU).
* Multi-method as it is materialised through different venues, in practice this means that it happens in two different legal settings, the first two policy field (CFSP and CSDP) are regulated through the TEU and the second group (external dimension and external action) are addressed by the TFEU. Since the TEU represents the &quot;intergovernmental&quot; character of the EU and the TFEU represents the &quot;communitary method&quot; (supranational), in the second we see the presence of actors such as the Commission and the European Parliament playing a rather important role whereas in the intergovernmental method, the decision lies in the hands of the Council under unanimity.
* Multi-level because it is embedded in the international level with different international organisations (UNO, IMF, NATO and WTO). Member States are also members of these organisations adding new actors into the game. The EU itself is a member of some of these and in practice this mean that Member States have other options to &quot;pick from&quot;.

==Issues==
The Financial Perspective for 2007–2013 was defined in 2005 when EU members agreed to fix the common budget to 1.045% of the European GDP. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed to review the British rebate, negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. Former French president Jacques Chirac declared this increase in the budget will permit Europe to &quot;finance common policies&quot; such as the Common Agricultural Policy or the Research and Technological Development Policy. France&#x27;s demand to lower the VAT in catering was refused. Controversial issues during budget debates include the British rebate, France&#x27;s benefits from the Common Agricultural Policy, Germany and the Netherlands&#x27; large contributions to the EU budget, reform of the European Regional Development Funds, and the question of whether the European Parliament should continue to meet both in Brussels and Strasbourg.

The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (TCE), commonly referred to as the European Constitution, is an international treaty intended to create a constitution for the European Union. The constitution was rejected by France and the Netherlands, where referendums were held causing other countries to postpone or halt their ratification procedures. Late in 2009, a new Reform Treaty was ratified by all member states of the European Union, and took effect on 1 December 2009.

Enlargement of the Union&#x27;s membership is a major political issue, with division over how far the bloc should expand. While some see it as a major policy instrument aiding the Union&#x27;s development, some fear over-stretch and dilution of the Union.

&quot;Counter-nationalistic shearing stress&quot; is the term coined by one commentator for the theoretical tendency of certain regions of larger countries of the EU to wish to become fully independent members within the wider context of the European Union&#x27;s &quot;bigger umbrella&quot;. If the Union is to become &quot;ever closer&quot;, it follows that regions with their own distinctive histories and identities within the existing member nations may see little reason to have a layer of &quot;insulation&quot; between themselves and the EU. The surprisingly close vote on Scottish Independence in September 2014 may be seen in this context. Others have suggested that regions of Germany could be candidates for &quot;Euro-Balkanisation&quot;, particularly given Germany&#x27;s commitment to the EU project and to a more nuanced, mature view of the notion of national allegiance.

<text>The Midland Railway experimented with electrification on its Heysham–Morecambe–Lancaster line in Lancashire, England. Electric trains started to run over this route in 1908, using the overhead 6.6 kV, 25 Hz AC electric supply installed and generated at the MR&#x27;s own power station in Heysham.

The electric multiple units consisted of three driving motor coaches and six driving trailer coaches. Since the DM cars had a cab at each end, this allowed trains of one, two, or three cars to be formed.

==Driving motors==
The three DM cars were built by the MR at their Derby Works and were in length. Two had Siemens electrical equipment fitted, while the third had Westinghouse equipment.

*LMS numbers for the motor coaches 28610-28612

==Driving trailers==
Of the six DT cars, four were built new by the MR at their Derby works, while the other two were converted from existing hauled stock compartment coaches.

==Withdrawal==
In February 1951, these venerable units were finally withdrawn from service. Steam locomotive-hauled trains operated passenger services over the Lancaster–Heysham Line from then until August 1953, when electric trains took over again, this time the prototype Class AM1 units following the installation of the appropriate new equipment.

The line voltage remained at 6,600 but the frequency was altered to 50 Hz and this was transformed and rectified on the trains to supply DC traction motors. This experiment led to the introduction of the 25 kV, 50 Hz system as standard for new electrification on British Railways.

Emaar Properties was founded and incorporated in 1997 by chairman Mohamed Alabbar. Emaar has interests in both commercial and residential property development, as well as malls and hospitality. The Dubai government initially owned 100 percent of the company while the founding shareholders held 24.3 percent when operations as a public company commenced after the IPO in 2000. The following year, Emaar announced plans to build Dubai Marina. In 2000, Emaar Properties was listed on the Dubai Financial Market and became the first property company to offer shares to foreign nationals. The first phase of the company&#x27;s developmental projects began in 2001 when Emaar awarded the contract in a joint venture to build three of the six apartment towers.
In 2003, the company revealed its plans for a signature development project, later known as Downtown Dubai. The project consisted of two developments: Burj Khalifa and The Dubai Mall, the world&#x27;s tallest building and world&#x27;s largest mall respectively.

Emaar International LLC was established in 2004 and signified Emaar&#x27;s expansion into foreign markets. The company has undertaken projects in Africa, Asia, North America, and throughout the Middle East. 

===2006–present===
The Dubai Mall officially opened in 2008, and Burj Khalifa in 2010. By 2014, Emaar was holding over $11.4 billion in real estate investments. In 2007, the company was majority-owned by Dubai&#x27;s government.

In 2009, John Laing Homes, a subsidiary of Emaar Properties which was acquired in 2006, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US Court for the District of Delaware.

In July 2010, American businessman Lionel Lombard filed a lawsuit against Emaar Properties and its Chairman Mohamed Alabbar in a California federal court alleging he was wrongfully imprisoned and tortured because he had spoken up on behalf of Emaar foreign workers. The case was dismissed in November 2010 by Lombard.
In September 2012, Emaar launched the Address BLVD, a luxurious 72 storey hotel and hotel serviced apartment project in Downtown Burj Dubai adjacent to the Dubai Mall.

In 2014, Emaar Properties announced plans to sell shares of its malls and retail business to the public. The IPO is one of the largest in the region since the global financial crisis. Emaar Malls Group became a publicly traded company on the Dubai Financial Market in October 2014. Closing at 3.25 dirhams with approximately 535 million shares traded, the IPO was the largest in Dubai since 2007. Also in 2014, Emaar opened the world&#x27;s highest observation deck, At the Top, Burj Khalifa SKY. The highest man-made vantage point sits 555 metres up on the 148th floor of Burj Khalifa.

Emaar marked the new year with the world&#x27;s most watched New Year&#x27;s Eve (NYE) celebration for 2015. According to Guinness World Records, Emaar oversaw the &quot;Largest LED-Illuminated Façade&quot; on the world&#x27;s tallest man made structure&quot; during the NYE celebrations. The record-setting display consisted of 70,000 LED panels that flashed coloured lights and projections of the country&#x27;s leaders and other images on the Burj Khalifa. Emaar reported a 16 percent rise in second-quarter net profit for 2015, and that it has a land bank of over 235 million square metres.

In November 2020, Emaar Properties announced a profit fall of 48% from the beginning of the year until September.

In December 2020, Alabbar stepped down as Emaar chairman but continued to oversee the day-to-day activities as managing director.

The Dubai Mall, developed by Emaar Properties, is the second world&#x27;s largest shopping mall. It marked its soft opening in November 2008 and was inaugurated in May 2009. The mall has over 1,200 stores and 200 restaurants. It is also home to Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo, KidZania, Dubai Ice Rink and the largest cinema complex in the region, Reel Cinemas. In 2014, The Dubai Mall had over 80 million visitors, of which 40 percent were tourists from outside the region. As an extension to Dubai Mall, Emaar began to develop a 55-storey residential building called Downtown Views.

Emaar Properties&#x27;s Dubai Fountain is the tallest performing fountain in the world and began operating in the spring of 2009.

Emaar developed the world&#x27;s tallest building, Burj Khalifa, which opened in 2010. The building is 2,716.5 feet tall with 160 storeys that are primarily for residential purposes. It is named after the Abu Dhabi ruler Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
Emaar Properties has also developed a number of neighbourhoods throughout Dubai including Arabian Ranches, Dubai Marina, The Greens, The Meadows, The Lakes, and The Springs. In 2013, Emaar launched The Address Residence Fountain Views I, II, and III, The Address Residence Sky View, Burj Vista, Boulevard Point and Vida Residence—all in Downtown Dubai. A further addition to Downtown Dubai from Emaar was the Opera District. Key features include the Dubai Opera House, the country&#x27;s first dedicated opera house.
In January 2015, Emaar Hospitality opened a boutique hotel, Manzil Downtown Dubai. The hotel is managed by Vida Hotels and Resorts and includes 200 rooms, suites with Burj Khalifa views, and access to a sports hub and several restaurants. Emaar rolled out the region&#x27;s first hop-on-hop-off transit system with the Dubai Trolley. The trolley is also the world&#x27;s first hydrogen-powered, zero-emission street tram system.

In 2016, Emaar Properties announced plans to build the world&#x27;s tallest structure, which would be taller than Burj Khalifa. It was expected to be completed by 2020.

==International projects==
Through various subsidiaries, Emaar has established property developments and projects in Pakistan, India, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraqi Kurdistan, and Turkey. Some of the projects have included developments such as the Beit Misk in Lebanon, the Jeddah Gate in Saudi Arabia, and the Samarah Dead Sea Resort in Jordan.

===Egypt===
Emaar Misr began working on a $4 billion development project in 2005 on the Moqattam Plateau in Cairo, initially called Cairo Grand Heights that was later renamed Uptown Cairo. The project included building up an area as a residential, commercial, and recreational community.

In 2006, Emaar Misr, an Egyptian subsidiary of Emaar Properties, completed an agreement with the Bibliotheca Alexandrina to redevelop part of its property on the eastern harbor of Alexandria. The new library facility stands almost exactly where the ancient Library of Alexandria existed, however the project has never materialized.

In 2008, Emaar Misr began working on a tourist resort called Marassi in Sidi Abdel Rahman, located along the Mediterranean coast, that includes a hotel with 3,000 rooms, a marina, and a golf course. The project also included the renovation of the well known Al-Alamein Hotel located within the property.

===India===
Emaar India has a portfolio of projects spanning all key segments of the Indian real estate industry, including residential, commercial, retail (malls) and hospitality. The company has a land bank of some 6,000 acres to be used for future development. Its existing assets and ongoing projects, as also its land banks, are spread across India: Delhi NCR (particularly Gurugram), Mohali, Chennai, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Jaipur and Indore.

====Early projects====
Emaar entered India in the early 2000s by winning the bid for the Hyderabad International Convention Centre, A joint venture, the Cyberabad Convention Centre Private Limited (CCCPL), was floated specifically for this project, with the other partner being the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC). The convention center, which has a total seating capacity of 4,000 seats (extendable to 6,500 seats) was completed in December 2005.

====Joint Venture phase====
In 2005, while the Hyderabad project was ongoing, Emaar entered into a joint venture to handle projects in India. Emaar India was founded in 2005 as a joint venture of Emaar Properties PJSC with MGF Developments Limited of India, in which Emaar was by far the larger equity partner and MGF was entrusted the operational responsibilities. The joint venture executed several significant projects, such as the 2010 Commonwealth Games Village in Delhi.

In April 2016, Emaar announced that it would separate from its joint venture partner and divide the company vertically. Shortly after the announcement, Emaar filed the demerger scheme in the Delhi High Court, and Shravan Gupta of MGF resigned from his operational positions. Prashant Gupta is the current CEO of the company.

In pursuance of the intended demerger, the company is presently undergoing a restructuring exercise, wherein Emaar has taken control of all the ongoing projects of the company to ensure their completion at the earliest. The company has committed to deliver 11,000 units by end of 2018, beginning with over 3,000 units in 2017 itself.

====Future plans====
In late 2021, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the governments of Dubai and Jammu &amp; Kashmir to facilitate investment into certain marquee projects. Under the agreement, Emaar is to develop a shopping mall in Srinagar of 500,000 sq.ft. EMAAR is also considering other investments in hospitality and mixed use commercial and residential projects in Jammu city and in Srinagar city.

===Saudi Arabia===
The King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC), developed by Emaar, The Economic City (Emaar E.C.) is listed on Tadawul, the Saudi stock exchange, and is the largest private investment in Saudi Arabia. The project includes the development of a special economic zone along the Red Sea coast 60 miles north of Jeddah. Emaar E.C. also heads the development of the KAEC port. The port is the first privately owned port for Saudi Arabia and was first opened in January 2014, but plans to further expand have been set in place after the generation of new financing. The KAEC development is projected to be about the same size as Washington, D.C. when completed and the zone is estimated to house approximately 2 million people and assist in aiding the Saudi Arabian economy in expanding beyond oil to light and shipping industry.

===Syria===
Emaar Properties first announced its plans for a large-scale development project in Syria in 2006. The development, known as The Eighth Gate, includes three zones: a commercial center, waterfront and residential zone, and tourist area. The project is a joint venture between Emaar Properties and IGO, an offshore investment and property development company.

===Turkey===
The Tuscan Valley development was Emaar&#x27;s first project in Turkey. Emaar completed the first phase of the Tuscan Valley venture by 2007, which included the development of luxury villas and commercial space just outside Istanbul. In 2012, Emaar began developing an Emaar Square project. The project plans include building Turkey&#x27;s largest shopping mall and five-star hotels. In 2013, Emaar Turkey, the wholly owned subsidiary of Emaar Properties, launched The Address Residences Emaar Square in Istanbul.
In 2017 Emaar Square Mall in Turkey was opened to the public.

===Pakistan===
The Crescent Bay, Karachi is a 108-acre (440,000 m2) under-construction upscale mixed-use oceanfront development in Defence, Karachi, Pakistan. It is considered one of the biggest projects in Pakistan, with a cost of $2.4 billion. The development features a series of high and mid-rise towers for residential and commercial use, a shopping centre, a five-star beachfront hotel and a tower located in the heart of the project.

The Canyon Views is a project of Emaar in Islamabad, Pakistan.

===Iraqi Kurdistan===
Downtown Erbil is a project for a large-scale mixed-use complex in Erbil. The project was launched by Emaar Properties in 2013 and covers an area of 541,000 square meters. This area will be used for residential apartments, hotels and a shopping mall.

<text>Sir Philip Bowes Vere Broke, 1st Baronet (; 9 September 1776 – 2 January 1841) was a Royal Navy officer who served in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. During his lifetime, he was often referred to as &quot;Broke of the &quot;Shannon&quot;&quot;, a reference to his notable command of . His most famous military achievement was defeating and capturing the American frigate, USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot;.

== Early life ==
Broke was born at Broke Hall, Nacton, near Ipswich, the eldest son of Philip Bowes Broke, grandson of Philip Broke and descendant of Sir Richard Broke, who served as Chief Baron of the Exchequer. He was educated at Ipswich School, where a house was later named in his honour.

==Naval career==
Broke joined the Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth Dockyard in 1788, and began active service as a midshipman in 1792. It was rather unusual for him to receive formal naval education – most of his contemporaries had only &quot;on the job&quot; training. He served as third lieutenant on the frigate during the battle of Cape St. Vincent in February 1797. He was promoted to commander in 1799 and captain on 14 February 1801.

On 25 November 1802, Broke married Sarah Louisa Middleton, daughter of Sir William Fowle Middleton 1st Baronet of Crowfield, Suffolk. They had 11 children, including Philip Broke, 2nd Baronet, George Broke-Middleton, and Charles Acton Broke.

===Capture of USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot;===

His most notable accomplishment was his victory while commanding , over the on 1 June 1813, during the War of 1812. Broke took command of the &quot;Shannon&quot;, a 38-gun frigate, on 31 August 1806. Broke was ordered to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1811 as the diplomatic position between America and Britain deteriorated. The United States Congress declared war on 18 June 1812.

There were half a dozen naval battles between Royal Navy and United States Navy frigates in 1812 and the early months 1813. The Americans won every one of those six encounters, which came as a surprise to the Royal Navy. The British and American ships were of the same rate, yet they were not of the same size or power. In each case the American ships were larger than the British vessels, had larger crews and had a heavier broadside. The Americans had a main battery of 24-pounder long guns compared with the smaller 18-pounders mounted on the British ships; the weight refers to the size of the cannonballs.

Matters changed when &quot;Shannon&quot; met &quot;Chesapeake&quot; off Boston, Massachusetts in a single ship action. Although &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was a slightly larger craft and had a substantially larger crew, the armament of the two ships was evenly matched. However, gunnery was Broke&#x27;s area of expertise, and the crew of &quot;Shannon&quot; were exceptionally well drilled for the era.

At the time the official rating of a ship did not accurately reflect the number of cannon mounted. Thus HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; (1065 tons burthen) was classed as a 38 gun ship but mounted 48 guns in total. USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; (1135 tons burthen) was variously rated a 36 or 38 gun ship but mounted 49 guns in total. Broke mounted a number of very small carronades in order that ships&#x27; boys and younger midshipmen could have cannon light enough for them to practise on. The force of a ship was usually calculated as &quot;weight of metal.&quot; This was the aggregate of the weight of all the cannonballs capable of being fired in one broadside (i.e., when half of the cannon, all the guns on the same side, were fired). The British weight of metal was 547 pounds, the American weight of metal was 581 pounds. The two ships were very well matched with no preponderance of force on either side.

&quot;Chesapeake&quot; was disabled by gunfire, boarded and captured within 15 minutes of opening fire. Fifty-six sailors on &quot;Chesapeake&quot; were killed and eighty-five wounded including her captain James Lawrence, who died of his wounds on 4 June. Lawrence&#x27;s last command was reported to be, &quot;Don&#x27;t give up the ship&quot;. On the &quot;Shannon&quot;, 24 were killed and 59 wounded, including Broke who sustained a serious head wound while leading the boarding party. The head wound from a cutlass blow, which had exposed the brain, had been very severe accompanied by great blood loss. Therapeutic bleeding, routinely employed at the time, was not performed by &quot;Shannon&quot;″s surgeon Mr Alexander Jack, which was to Broke&#x27;s advantage. The report of the surgeon described the wound as &quot;a deep cut on the parietal bone, extending from the top of the head ... towards the left ear, [the bone] penetrated for at least three inches in length.&quot;

Lieutenant Provo Wallis, a Nova Scotian, took command of &quot;Shannon&quot; as the frigate and her prize returned to Halifax as surgeons worked to save Broke. In Halifax, Broke recovered at the Commissioner&#x27;s residence in the Halifax Naval Yard.

&quot;Shannon&quot;″s victory created a sensation in both the United States and the United Kingdom, especially in the newspapers of the era. In recognition, Broke was created a baronet on 25 September 1813. He became a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 3 January 1815. He was also awarded a Naval Gold Medal, one of only eight awarded for single ship actions between 1794 and 1816. While his wounds precluded further active service, Broke served as a naval gunnery specialist in the Royal Navy. He was promoted to rear admiral of the red on 22 July 1830.

His younger brother, Charles Broke, later Charles Broke Vere, joined the British Army. Charles served under the Duke of Wellington. He ended as a major general and was knighted.

Sir Philip Broke Bt. died on 2 January 1841 and is buried in Nacton in Suffolk with a monument sculpted by Thomas Denman.

<text>The Victoria Centre is a shopping centre and social housing complex in Nottingham, England, constructed by Taylor Woodrow between 1967 and 1972. It contains fashion and high street chain stores as well as cafes, restaurants, an indoor market, and the Nottingham Victoria bus station.

==History==
The Victoria Centre stands on the site of the old Nottingham Victoria railway station, which was demolished in 1967. The clock tower and the former Victoria Station Hotel (now run by Hilton Hotels) were the only parts of the old station to be retained. The complex was designed by Arthur Swift &amp; Partners and constructed between 1967 and 1972 by Taylor Woodrow. The ground and first floor of the complex hold the Victoria Centre shopping centre, which is managed by Savills. The building itself is owned by a limited partnership between Shaftesbury Capital, Corporation Service Company, Global Mutual, and Nottingham City Council. The complex remains the tallest building in Nottingham, with the 26 floor, high Victoria Centre Flats, which run north–south along their length in a number of blocks of different heights. There are 464 flats and of office space.

In 1970, the kinetic sculptor Rowland Emett was commissioned to design and build a &quot;water-powered&quot; clock known as &quot;The Aqua Horological Tintinnabulator&quot;. The clock was installed in late 1972 and chimed on the hour and half-hour, playing &quot;Gigue en Rondeau II&quot; (1724) from Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Pieces de Clavecin&quot; Suite in E minor. This musical animated sculpture was originally located on the lower mall and was a popular meeting place. The clock was later modified to chime and play the music every fifteen minutes. In February 2014, the clock was dismantled and refurbished by engineer Pete Dexter and the Rowland Emett Society. It was reassembled for exhibition in Millennium Point, Birmingham, during the summer of 2014 before being dismantled again and stored until December 2014. The parts were then transported back to Nottingham, where Dexter and Intu Victoria Centre staff carried out further refurbishment work. It was reassembled in its new location, at the north end of the upper mall. Its stature, colour scheme, and most of its original water features were restored. It was officially restarted on 17 June 2015.

In 1985, the Food Court was opened on the lower mall. 
In the late 1980s the centre was refurbished accompanied by significant rebranding. 
During this refurbishment, the lower mall of the centre was organised into different courts, namely;
1) Emett court
2) Palm Court
3) Fountain court
4) Neon court
5) Food court

In 1997, the centre was extended to provide more retail space and allow the addition of a new anchor, House of Fraser. The rest of the centre was refurbished.

In 2010, it was announced that the Victoria Centre would be expanded to compete with Westfield&#x27;s nearby Broadmarsh Centre and new centres in Derby and Leicester. In November 2011, Capital Shopping Centres purchased the Broadmarsh Centre. The purchase prompted an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission, which was concerned the company&#x27;s monopoly over the city&#x27;s shopping centres could negatively impact competition. Following the purchase, the owners wished to begin the planned development of the Victoria Centre, but Nottingham City Council insisted that Broadmarsh must be their &quot;priority&quot; and offered £50 million towards its redevelopment. The deputy leader of Nottingham City Council said the council would withhold planning permission for the development of the Victoria Centre until they &quot;see bulldozers going into the Broadmarsh Centre&quot;.

In February 2013, the parent company, Capital Shopping Centres, changed its name to Intu. The centre was rebranded Intu Victoria Centre as part of the company&#x27;s £25m nationwide rebrand.

In 2013, plans were revealed for the centre to be refurbished. The refurbishment began in February 2014 and was completed in summer 2015. It was undertaken by Laing O&#x27;Rourke and features a new restaurant quarter in the clock tower area and new lighting, flooring, entrances, and toilet facilities. This is the second refurbishment of the centre since the last major refurbishment in 1997. There are plans for an extension to the centre to increase floor space, but these will not be considered until plans for Intu Broadmarsh have been submitted.

Following Intu Properties plc entering administration in June 2020, a subsidiary of the company called Intu SGS received funding to take full control of the centre along with Lakeside, Braehead and Intu Watford. The transfer involved Global Mutual becoming asset manager of the centres and Savills serving as property manager. In November 2020, the centre&#x27;s name reverted from intu Victoria Centre back to Victoria Centre.

==Victoria Centre Market==
On the first floor, opposite John Lewis, is Nottingham&#x27;s largest indoor market, the Victoria Centre Market. It sells a range of goods, including fresh food, meat, and fish. There are also speciality stalls selling items such as books, jewellery, and haberdashery. The market is open from Monday to Saturday from 9:00 to 5:00 p.m.

In 2008 it won the award for the Greenest Market in the Midlands from the National Market Traders Federation.

<doc id="1312311" wikidata="Q877555" url="?curid=1312311" title="Monaco national football team">
<text>The Monaco national football team is a national side that represents Monaco in association football. The team is controlled by the Monégasque Football Federation, the governing body for all football in Monaco. Monaco is not a member of FIFA or UEFA, and therefore cannot enter the FIFA World Cup nor the UEFA European Championship. Monaco was a founding member of the N.F.-Board in 2003, and finished second in the 2006 VIVA World Cup inaugural edition. However, due to political opposition, Monaco severed ties with the organization in 2010.

Although Monaco has a National Olympic Committee and has therefore been eligible for the Summer Olympics and Mediterranean Games, they have never entered either games&#x27; football tournaments.

==History==
===Beginnings===
After the foundation of the Monégasque Football Federation in April 2000, Monaco played its first match in June of the same year against Gibraltar, losing 5–0. After this match, Monaco would return to play a match a year later against Tibet, in Freiburg, in Germany, winning 2–1.

==Overview==
Since 2001, Monaco has participated in twenty-seven games, winning eight, drawing six, and losing thirteen. The team competes against local clubs, nations, unrecognized states, people groups, and territories. Monaco is managed by Martino López, and competes at the Stade Didier Deschamps in Cap-d&#x27;Ail, France. According to Elo Ratings, Monaco is ranked 200th in the world as of November 2020.

The team&#x27;s roster is composed of roughly sixty men; only five offer professional experience, since the team is mainly made up of civil servants and employees of the Société des bains de mer de Monaco.
