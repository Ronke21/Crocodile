<text>Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell II (; 30 October 1572 – 10 September 1602), also known as Red Hugh O&#x27;Donnell, was an Irish clan chief, Lord of Tyrconnell from 1592 until his death, and senior leader of the Irish confederacy during the Nine Years&#x27; War.

He was born into the powerful O&#x27;Donnell clan of Tyrconnell (present-day County Donegal). By the age of fourteen, he was recognised as the O&#x27;Donnell clan&#x27;s tanist and engaged to the daughter of Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone. The English-ruled Irish government feared that an alliance between the O&#x27;Donnell and O&#x27;Neill clans would threaten the Crown&#x27;s control over Ulster, so in 1587 Lord Deputy John Perrot arranged for Hugh Roe&#x27;s kidnapping. The government subsequently backed regime change in Tyrconnell. After four years&#x27; imprisonment in Dublin Castle, Hugh Roe escaped circa January 1592 with the help of Tyrone&#x27;s bribery. He was inaugurated as clan chief at Kilmacrennan on 3 May 1592.

Along with his father-in-law Tyrone, Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell led a confederacy of Irish clans in the Nine Years&#x27; War, motivated to prevent English incursions into their territory and to end Catholic persecution under Elizabeth I. Throughout the war, O&#x27;Donnell expanded his territory into Connacht by launching raids against successive Lord Presidents Richard Bingham and Conyers Clifford. O&#x27;Donnell led the confederacy to victory at the Battle of Curlew Pass. In 1600, he suffered various military and personal losses. His cousin Niall Garve defected to the English, which greatly emboldened commander Henry Docwra&#x27;s troops and forced O&#x27;Donnell out of Tyrconnell.

After a crushing defeat at the Siege of Kinsale, O&#x27;Donnell travelled to Habsburg Spain to seek reinforcements from King Philip III. Whilst on route to an audience with the king, O&#x27;Donnell died of a sudden illness at the Castle of Simancas, aged 29. His body was buried inside the Chapel of Wonders at the Convent of St. Francis in Valladolid. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s premature death disheartened an already withering Irish resistance; Tyrone ended the Nine Years&#x27; War in 1603 with the Treaty of Mellifont.

Fiercely patriotic and militarily aggressive, O&#x27;Donnell is considered a folk hero and a symbol of Irish nationalism. He has drawn comparisons to El Cid and William Wallace. In 2020, an unsuccessful archaeological dig for his remains in Valladolid drew international media attention. Since 2022, the city has annually reenacted his 1602 funeral procession in period costumes.

== Early life ==

=== Family background ===
Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell was born 30 October 1572, the eldest son of Irish lord Hugh MacManus O&#x27;Donnell and his second wife, Scottish aristocrat Fiona &quot;Iníon Dubh&quot; MacDonald. He was born into the ruling branch of the O&#x27;Donnell clan, a Gaelic Irish noble dynasty based in Tyrconnell (a kingdom geographically associated with present-day County Donegal). He had three younger brothers, Rory, Manus and Cathbarr (ordered oldest to youngest), and several sisters, Nuala, Margaret and Mary. He also had older half-siblings from his father&#x27;s previous relationships, including Donal and Siobhán.

Paternally Hugh Roe claimed descent, via the lineage of Conall Gulban of the Cenél Conaill, from the Pre-Christian High King Niall of the Nine Hostages. Through his mother, Hugh Roe was a descendant of the first six Scottish Chiefs of Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg and from Somerled, the first Lord of the Isles. He was also descended from King of Scots Robert the Bruce and his grandson Robert II, the first Stuart king of Scotland.

Hugh Roe&#x27;s father, Hugh MacManus, had ruled as clan chief and Lord of Tyrconnell since 1566. He was a wary politician who alternated between alliances with the O&#x27;Neill clan, his long-established rivals in Ulster, and the English government, which controlled the area around Dublin. In 1569 Hugh MacManus married Iníon Dubh of Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg, as part of a marriage alliance, which gave the O&#x27;Donnell clan access to the formidable Scottish mercenary forces known as Redshanks. Iníon Dubh pushed the O&#x27;Donnell clan further into opposition with the English, and in 1574 the clan established an alliance with ascendant O&#x27;Neill clansman Hugh O&#x27;Neill (future Earl of Tyrone) via his marriage to Siobhán.

=== Education ===
The Franciscan friars at Donegal Abbey were the spiritual counselors of the ruling O&#x27;Donnells, and were also the educators of the dynasty&#x27;s children. Their practice, since the Reformation in Ireland, had been to grant sanctuary to Catholic priests fleeing from religious persecution. In medieval Ireland, the sons of Irish clan chiefs were typically trained from the age of seven in horse-riding and weaponry.

In his biography of Rob Roy MacGregor, W. H. Murray described the Highland code of conduct as follows: &quot;The abiding principle is cast up from the records of detail: that right must be seen to be done, no man left destitute, the given word honoured, the strictest honour observed to all who have given implicit trust, and that a guest&#x27;s confidence in his safety must never be betrayed by his host, or &quot;vice versa&quot;. There was more of like kind, and each held as its kernel the simple ideal of trust honoured... Breaches of it were abhorred and damned... The ideal was applied &#x27;with discretion&#x27;. Its interpretation went deeply into domestic life, but stayed shallow for war and politics.&quot;

=== Fosterage ===
Children of the Gaelic Irish nobility were traditionally fostered to fellow clans, typically in the hopes of developing political alliances. As such, Hugh Roe was fostered by four families of differing political alignments: Clans Sweeney na dTuath and O&#x27;Cahan, as well as two rival O&#x27;Donnell branches led by Hugh McHugh Dubh O&#x27;Donnell and Conn O&#x27;Donnell. Conn had a strong claim to the lordship as his father Calvagh was a prior ruler of Tyrconnell. In 1581 Conn turned hostile towards the ruling O&#x27;Donnells and Hugh Roe was removed from his care. Conn died in 1583 and Hugh Roe&#x27;s succession seemed assured. Nevertheless, Conn&#x27;s sons, particularly Niall Garve, looked to the English government as a means of restoring their branch of the family to power. By 1587, Hugh Roe was in the care of Owen Óg MacSweeney na dTuath, his final foster-father. According to historian Darren McGettigan, MacSweeney na dTuath &quot;appears to have given [Hugh Roe] much freedom&quot;.








Ultimately Hugh Roe&#x27;s fosterage did not engender much loyalty in his foster-families. Hugh Dubh antagonised the ruling O&#x27;Donnells into the 1590s, and the sons of MacSweeney na dTuath and Conn eventually opposed Hugh Roe by defecting to the English.

=== Rise to prominence ===
Hugh Roe saw his first military action in 1584, with his father&#x27;s chief advisor Sir Eoin O&#x27;Gallagher, against Clan O&#x27;Rourke of West Breifne. Even before reaching the age of fifteen, Hugh Roe had become well known across Ireland. Biographer Lughaidh Ó Cléirigh praised the young noble: &quot;He continued to grow and increase in comeliness and urbanity, tact and eloquence, wisdom and knowledge, goodly size and noble deeds&quot;. Hugh Roe began to be associated with Aodh Eangach, a prophesied high king. It was foretold that if two men named Hugh succeeded each other as O&#x27;Donnell chief, the last Hugh shall &quot;be a monarch in Ireland and quite banish thence all foreign nations and conquerors&quot;.

By 1587, Hugh Roe was betrothed to the Earl of Tyrone&#x27;s daughter Rose. In addition to Tyrone&#x27;s marriage to Siobhán, this betrothal would further cement a growing alliance between two clans who had traditionally been mortal enemies for centuries. Hugh Roe had become a focus of authority within Tyrconnell, and Tyrone described him as &quot;the stay that his father had for the quieting of his inhabitance&quot;. As tanist of the O&#x27;Donnell clan, Hugh Roe was widely considered to be his father&#x27;s most likely successor.

== Imprisonment and escape ==

=== Capture at Rathmullan ===
The English government feared that the emergence of a powerful O&#x27;Neill-O&#x27;Donnell alliance, which would be cemented by Hugh Roe&#x27;s marriage to Rose, would threaten English control over Ulster. Though Tyrone professed loyalty to the Crown, he was attracting suspicion from the government due to his growing power. Hugh Roe&#x27;s familial links to various Scottish Highland clans were also a cause for concern; English officials often pejoratively referred to him as &quot;Scottish&quot;. Additionally Hugh Roe&#x27;s father had failed to pay annual rents promised to the government, and at the time the English government kept hostages for policy reasons. Ultimately the government decided that Hugh Roe must not be allowed to succeed as O&#x27;Donnell clan chief, and so the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Welsh statesman John Perrot, hatched a plan to kidnap the young noble. In May 1587, Perrot proposed to Lord Burghley that he could capture &quot;[Hugh MacManus], his wife (who is a great bringer in of Scots), and perhaps his son [Hugh Roe], by sending thither a boat with wines&quot;.
Hugh MacManus was summoned to a conference with Perrot. Meanwhile the ship &quot;Matthew&quot;, captained by Dublin merchant Nicholas Barnes (alias Nicholas Skipper) was dispatched to Rathmullan on Lough Swilly, where fourteen-year-old Hugh Roe was sojourning with his foster-father MacSweeney na dTuath. The ship was anchored and the crew went on shore under the guise of ordinary merchants selling wine. Hugh Roe heard of the merchant ship and arrived with several young companions. Barnes claimed that they had no wine left unsold except for what was left on their ship, and the group were invited aboard. According to 17th-century accounts, Chief Donnell MacSweeney Fanad (Hugh Roe&#x27;s host) was ashamed that the young noble had missed out on the wine and unwittingly encouraged him to take a small boat to the &quot;Matthew&quot;.

Chief MacSweeney Fanad, Chief MacSweeney na dTuath and Eoin O&#x27;Gallagher accompanied Hugh Roe onto the &quot;Matthew&quot;. Once on board, Hugh Roe and his compatriots were conducted into a secured cabin and plied with food and wine. Whilst they were enjoying themselves, the hatches were fastened and their weapons were removed. MacSweeney Fanad was released in exchange for his eldest son Donnell Gorm MacSweeney Fanad. O&#x27;Gallagher likewise gave his nephew Hugh O&#x27;Gallagher. MacSweeney na dTuath was also released upon giving &quot;his eldest son&quot;—actually a young peasant dressed in his son&#x27;s clothes—as a hostage. Hostages were offered in Hugh Roe&#x27;s stead to no avail, and the ship set sail for Dublin.

=== Imprisonment ===
Hugh Roe arrived in Dublin on 6 October O.S. 25 September]; Queen Elizabeth I was informed the next day. Perrot ascertained that the peasant was not MacSweeney na dTuath&#x27;s son and dismissed him. Hugh Roe and his two fellow hostages were imprisoned in Dublin Castle&#x27;s Bermingham Tower.

Within three months, Tyrone was lobbying the queen for Hugh Roe&#x27;s release. In 1588, he offered a bribe of £1000 to William FitzWilliam (Perrot&#x27;s successor as Lord Deputy) plus £300 to newly-appointed officials. Tyrone was later accused of offering a further £1000 to Dublin Castle&#x27;s constable. In spring 1588, Iníon Dubh offered Perrot a bribe of £2000, plus sureties and hostages, for her son&#x27;s release. Hugh MacManus offered thirty Spanish officers, taken from the Spanish Armada&#x27;s September 1588 shipwreck in Inishowen, in exchange for his son. FitzWilliam refused due to &quot;the dangers that might grow unto this miserable realm by letting loose the reins unto so harebrain and ungracious an imp&quot;. In 1590 FitzWilliam indicated a willingness to release Hugh Roe, but this came to naught.

The English attempted to convert Hugh Roe and his fellow Catholic hostages to Protestantism by bringing them to a Protestant service, but the boys shouted over the hymns and music so the service could not be heard. They did not desist even when carried out of the church and sent back to Bermingham Tower, and were never again summoned.

During his time in Dublin Castle, Hugh Roe had little interaction with the outside world beyond conversations with fellow political prisoners. In witnessing first-hand the brutality inflicted by the Dublin government on Irish rebels, he became embittered and resentful of English authority. Captain Thomas Lee warned the government that O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s youth would make him impressionable and radicalised. Ironically, Hugh Roe learnt to speak English during his imprisonment. Ó Cléirigh highlights the young noble&#x27;s growing distress for his kinsmen. Hugh Roe&#x27;s imprisonment is seen as the defining event of his life.

=== Chaos in Tyrconnell ===
Hugh MacManus became prematurely senile, and Hugh Roe&#x27;s imprisonment exacerbated a long-running succession dispute which had consumed Tyrconnell since October 1580. The dispute was bloody; three of Conn&#x27;s sons were violently killed in the conflict. Iníon Dubh effectively took over Tyrconnell and ruled in her husband&#x27;s name. She pushed successfully for Hugh Roe to become her husband&#x27;s successor by spreading the Aodh Eangach prophecy and by directing her Redshanks to kill any challengers. Hugh MacEdegany, an illegitimate son of Calvagh O&#x27;Donnell, was the first major challenger. He was assassinated on Iníon Dubh&#x27;s orders during a visit to her residence, Mongavlin Castle, in May 1588. Niall Garve took over as head of the &quot;MacCalvagh&quot; branch.

Further disruptions developed as the government appointed various administrators in Tyrconnell who ransacked and pillaged the kingdom. Perrot appointed William Mostian as Sheriff of Tyrconnell—he quickly carried out eight cattle raids, ransacking Donegal Abbey and murdering its guardian. Later the same year, FitzWilliam gave Captain John Connill charge of Tyrconnell after being bribed with two Spanish gold chains. Connill assisted the opponents of the ruling O&#x27;Donnells. He was later joined by Captain Humphrey Willis and two hundred soldiers. At one point Connill befriended then captured Hugh MacManus, but he was freed by Niall Garve. Another brutal administrator was Captain Bowen, a notorious torturer who fried the soles of his victims&#x27; feet. This chaos created mass resentment towards the English government.

Hugh Roe&#x27;s elder half-brother Donal became the Crown&#x27;s favored candidate for the chiefdom, and shortly after the Armada&#x27;s shipwreck, FitzWilliam knighted and appointed Donal as Sheriff. FitzWilliam also imprisoned important Tyrconnell nobles Sean O&#x27;Doherty (Lord of Inishowen) and Eoin O&#x27;Gallagher, believing them to possess Spanish treasure from the Armada. O&#x27;Gallagher&#x27;s imprisonment also had political motivations as he was a major adherent of Hugh Roe during the succession dispute. Donal made an effort to depose his father, backed by Connill&#x27;s troops. Iníon Dubh, backed by her Redshanks and the clans of the Cenél Conaill who remained loyal to her husband, crushed Donal at the Battle of Doire Leathan on 14 September O.S. 3 September] 1590.

Willis (who replaced Donal as Sheriff) and Connill exploited the ensuing chaos. They took control of western Tyrconnell and began raiding into the east. Their forces also ransacked southern Tyrconnell and forced many of the population to flee to the mountains.

Iníon Dubh bought off Niall Garve with a political marriage to her daughter Nuala, in an attempt to temper his hostility. By 1592, Niall Garve was in a strong position to claim Tyrconnell&#x27;s lordship. Despite the continual presence of freebooting government troops, Tyrconnell&#x27;s nobility remained obsessed with their succession conflict.

=== First escape attempt ===

After three years and three months in English captivity, Hugh Roe made his first escape attempt in January 1591, in the company of fellow Ulster hostages Donnell Gorm MacSweeney Fanad and Hugh O&#x27;Gallagher. Before Hugh Roe and his companions were put in their cells one night, they escaped through a nearby window and climbed down a rope onto the drawbridge. They jammed a block of timber into the door, preventing the guards from pursuing them. By the time the guards noticed Hugh Roe&#x27;s absence and gave chase, the fugitives had already escaped past the open city gates.

Hugh Roe&#x27;s shoes fell apart and he was left behind by his companions in the thick woods beyond Three Rock Mountain. He sent word to Castlekevin in County Wicklow, the territory of Chief Felim O&#x27;Toole, who had visited him in Dublin Castle. O&#x27;Toole wanted to assist Hugh Roe but faced pressure from his clan, who feared the consequences of aiding a high profile fugitive. O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s sister Rose quickly planned for her husband Fiach McHugh O&#x27;Byrne, of Clan O&#x27;Byrne, to take Hugh Roe to his house in Glenmalure. According to O&#x27;Sullivan Beare, O&#x27;Byrne and his clansmen immediately set out to rescue Hugh Roe, but their inability to cross a flooded river prevented them from reaching Castlekevin in time. English officer George Carew was dispatched to Castlekevin on 25 January O.S. 15 January] and Hugh Roe was surrendered and returned to Dublin Castle in chains. Ó Cléirigh states the Privy Council were pleased with Hugh Roe&#x27;s recapture: &quot;they made little or no account of all the hostages and pledges who escaped from them, and they were thankful for the visit which restored him to them again&quot;. Hugh Roe was returned to Dublin Castle, more heavily shackled, and checked by the chief gaoler twice a day.

=== Second escape attempt ===
Around January 1592, Hugh Roe made a successful escape attempt with his fellow prisoners Henry MacShane O&#x27;Neill and Art MacShane O&#x27;Neill. After years of lobbying and bribery, Tyrone had finally succeeded in bribing officials to help facilitate Hugh Roe&#x27;s escape. FitzWilliam, considered one of Tudor Ireland&#x27;s most corrupt Lord Deputies, was most likely the recipient of this bribe, though this has never been conclusively proven. A 17th-century account by Donegal priests alleged that Tyrone successfully bribed FitzWilliam with £1,000. In summer 1590, Conn MacShane O&#x27;Neill alleged that Tyrone &quot;did lay down a plot and practised the escape of Hugh Roe&quot; from prison—the plot apparently involved a silk rope and prepared horses. This is obviously a reference to some previous attempt, but is an accurate forecast of Hugh Roe&#x27;s eventually successful escape.This escape plan was far more prepared than Hugh Roe&#x27;s prior attempt. The constable of Dublin Castle John Maplesden was on his deathbed which distracted the chief gaoler from his duties, making it the perfect time to mount an escape. A gaoler&#x27;s servant named Edward Eustace promised four horses which would be saddled in a nearby stable for three days prior. Fiach McHugh O&#x27;Byrne promised shelter for the fugitives at Glenmalure. Richard Weston, a servant of Tyrone, managed to supply Hugh Roe with a silk rope, and winter clothes were acquired for the long journey.

When the three prisoners were unshackled to eat, they took advantage of the gaolers. The prisoners made their way to the . They tied one end of the rope there, and fed the other end down the privy hole which led outside the castle. Henry became separated from the others. According to Ó Cléirigh, &quot;the darkness of the night and the hurry of the flight separated [Henry] who was the oldest of the party... [The others] were not pleased at the separation&quot;. According to O&#x27;Sullivan Beare, Henry made his way down the rope first, and without waiting for the others, escaped safely back to Ulster. Hugh Roe followed, but Art MacShane was badly injured by a falling stone whilst sliding down the rope. Although Eustace had promised horses, on that day they had been removed without his knowledge. Once outside the castle, Hugh Roe and Art MacShane met with Eustace who guided them through Dublin. The trio proceeded through the dark streets, mixing with the crowds, and safely escaped the city.

The escape plan went awry. The fugitives had left their winter clothes in prison and Hugh Roe&#x27;s shoes became worn out, exposing him to the elements. Art MacShane had to be carried by the others, either because he had grown fat and unfit in prison, or because of his injury from the falling stone. The trio made it into the Wicklow Mountains at which point they sought shelter in a cave, traditionally said to be along the slopes of Conavalla. Hugh Roe and Art MacShane were too weak to reach Glenmalure, so Eustace left them in the cave and went on ahead to get help. According to O&#x27;Sullivan Beare, Hugh Roe managed to survive by eating leaves and bark, but despite his pleas, Art MacShane could not eat. After three nights, when O&#x27;Byrne&#x27;s men arrived to rescue them, Hugh Roe and Art MacShane were found covered in snow. Art MacShane died of hypothermia. O&#x27;Sullivan Beare claimed that Hugh Roe refused to eat due to his grief over Art MacShane&#x27;s death, but was compelled to do so by O&#x27;Byrne&#x27;s men. He was taken to Glenmalure where he was revived with difficulty, tended to and recovered.

Art MacShane&#x27;s family were rivals to Tyrone, so it was speculated that Tyrone had O&#x27;Byrne&#x27;s party kill him, though it is more likely he died of exposure. He was buried on the mountainside. Since 1954 (and as an official event since 2006), the escape is commemorated each January in the Art O&#x27;Neill Challenge, an ultramarathon endurance event in which participants recreate the same journey from Dublin to Glenmalure on foot.

Unusually, the state papers do not reference Hugh Roe&#x27;s escape until his safe return to Ulster. This could point to corruption or embarrassment on the part of government officials. An outraged Queen Elizabeth I wrote to statesman Thomas Burgh in May 1592 and decreed that &quot;O&#x27;Donnell escaped by the practice of money bestowed on somebody. Call to you the Chancellor, Chief Justice Gardiner, and the Treasurer, and inquire who they are that have been touched by it&quot;. In a letter to Lord Burghley, FitzWilliam attempted to vindicate himself by declaring he had sacked Maplesden (who died mere days after the escape) and imprisoned the chief gaoler.

== Accession as clan chief ==

=== Return to Ulster ===
For a few days after his rescue, Hugh Roe was tended to in a hidden cabin in Glenmalure. Hugh Roe and O&#x27;Byrne swore oaths to mutually assist each other if they came under English attack. Turlough Boye O&#x27;Hagan, a trusted emissary of Tyrone, arrived to escort Hugh Roe back to Ulster; they set out immediately. Hugh Roe&#x27;s feet were frostbitten so he had to be lifted up and off of his horse. He was escorted across the Liffey by a band of horsemen (which included Felim O&#x27;Toole). He proceeded northwards under O&#x27;Hagan&#x27;s guidance and crossed the Boyne on a small ferry kept by a &quot;poor little fisherman&quot;, whilst his attendant led their horses through Drogheda. At Mellifont, he rested one night at the house of English ally Garret Moore, travelled through Dundalk and the Fews, and on the third day reached Armagh. The next day Hugh Roe arrived at Dungannon, Tyrone&#x27;s residence, where the two men presumably discussed their plans to retake Tyrconnell&#x27;s lordship. It is also here that they may have planned their future attack on Turlough Luineach O&#x27;Neill, Tyrone&#x27;s rival in Tír Eoghain. Hugh Roe remained at Tyrone&#x27;s residence for four days, hidden in a secret chamber to avoid corrupting Tyrone&#x27;s loyalist public image. Afterwards, Hugh Roe was received by Chief Hugh Maguire of Fermanagh. Maguire conveyed Hugh Roe across Lough Erne and brought him to the border of Tyrconnell where a party of supporters welcomed him. Hugh Roe then arrived at his father&#x27;s castle in Ballyshannon.

=== Attack on English occupation ===
Hugh Roe arrived in a Tyrconnell which had suffered much repression and turmoil in his absence. A few months before Hugh Roe&#x27;s return, Willis and Connill&#x27;s forces raided Donegal in the dead of night, killed thirty people, and occupied Donegal Abbey as a garrison. Ballyshannon Castle and Donegal Castle were the two major strongholds in Tyrconnell not yet deprived by the Crown. Hugh Roe made expelling the English forces his first order of business, and he summoned and rallied his family&#x27;s followers to Ballyshannon. Even nobles in Tyrconnell who previously favoured the Crown had become resentful by this time.
As soon as Chief Donough MacSweeney Banagh heard of Hugh Roe&#x27;s safe return, he attacked Willis, forcing him and his soldiers into their garrison in Donegal Abbey. Hugh Roe&#x27;s forces killed a number of English troops, forcing them to abandon plunder. Hugh Roe travelled to Donegal to face Willis and forced the English troops to depart Tyrconnell. Sources conflict on the exact circumstances. According to Ó Cléirigh, Hugh Roe informed Willis that if he and his men left, they would not be harmed. According to a 17th-century account written by the clergy of Donegal Abbey, Willis threatened to set the church on fire, but Hugh Roe was &quot;anxious to preserve the sacred edifice&quot; and allowed Willis to depart unharmed. According to Thomas Lee, O&#x27;Donnell intended to slaughter Willis&#x27;s men but was held back by Tyrone.

According to O&#x27;Sullivan Beare, &quot;Being surrounded there [Willis] surrendered to Roe by whom he was dismissed in safety with an injunction to remember his words, that the Queen and her officers were dealing unjustly with the Irish; that the Catholic religion was contaminated by impiety; that holy bishops and priests were inhumanely and barbarously tortured; that Catholic noblemen were cruelly imprisoned and ruined; that wrong was deemed right; that he himself had been treacherously and perfidiously kidnapped; and that for these reasons he would neither give tribute or allegiance to the English.&quot; The peace terms stipulated that Willis and his soldiers were forbidden to take any stolen cattle or other looted property with them as they crossed back into Connacht. Afterwards the clergy returned to the abbey.

=== Inauguration ===
After the expulsion of Willis&#x27;s forces in February, Hugh Roe returned to Ballyshannon where his big toes were amputated due to frostbite. He remained in recovery from February to April. In April, before an assembly of fellow nobles in Kilmacrennan, Hugh MacManus abdicated in favour of Hugh Roe. This was accepted by the nobility present. The abdication, though apparently voluntary, was &quot;stage-managed&quot; by Iníon Dubh, who remained the &quot;head of advice and counsel&quot; in Tyrconnell. Following his abdication, Hugh MacManus spent his final years living in retirement among the Franciscans at Donegal Abbey and doing penance for his sins.

19-year-old Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell was inaugurated as Chief of the O&#x27;Donnell clan on 3 May O.S. 23 April] 1592. The ceremony, which involved the O&#x27;Donnell clan&#x27;s ornamental inauguration stone (the &quot;Rock of Doon&quot;), was held at Kilmacrennan Friary. Hugh Roe was the last ruler of Tyrconnell to be inaugurated with the traditional ceremony, with the exception of Niall Garve&#x27;s controversial inauguration in 1603. Hugh Roe&#x27;s younger brother Rory was appointed as tanist. Hugh Roe&#x27;s great-grandfather, also named Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell, was clan chief from 1461 to 1505; historian Francis Martin O&#x27;Donnell thus distinguishes them using the regnal numbers I and II.

Theologian Timothy T. O&#x27;Donnell described the traditions of the ceremony, which was both civil and religious in nature: &quot;It began with the religious rites in the church of the nearby monastery and holy well singing Psalms and hymns in honor of Christ and St. Columba for the success of the prince&#x27;s sovereignty. Standing on the rock surrounded by nobles and his clansmen, the Prince received an oath in which he promised to preserve the Church and the laws of the land. The Prince also vowed to deliver the succession of the realm peacefully to his &quot;Tanist&quot; (his successor). O&#x27;Ferghil, the hereditary warden and abbot of Kilmacrenan, performed the religious ceremony of the inauguration of the O&#x27;Donnell. O&#x27;Gallagher was the Prince&#x27;s marshal and O&#x27;Clery was the &quot;ollamh&quot;, or scholarly lawyer who presented to him the book containing the laws and customs of the land and the straight, white wand symbolizing the moral rectitude demanded of his judgments and rule.&quot; O&#x27;Donnell would have turned &quot;thrice from left to right and thrice from right to left, in honor of the Holy Trinity&quot;, after which O&#x27;Ferghil would have led the spectators in loudly proclaiming Hugh Roe as The O&#x27;Donnell.

The major surviving opponents to Hugh Roe&#x27;s succession—including Niall Garve, Hugh McHugh Dubh and Sean O&#x27;Doherty—did not attend the inauguration out of protest. At the time, Niall Garve was in Dublin unsuccessfully seeking support from authorities.

=== Rise in power ===

Immediately after his inauguration, Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell and Tyrone mounted raids against Tyrone&#x27;s rival Turlough Luineach. Turlough Luineach had provided assistance to O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s rivals, such as Niall Garve. O&#x27;Donnell would have desired revenge and felt a need to assist his new ally Tyrone. For Tyrone, a key reason for maintaining his alliance with the O&#x27;Donnell clan was to defeat Turlough Luineach and take control of Tír Eoghain.

In June 1592, Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell renewed the O&#x27;Donnell clan&#x27;s interest in north Connacht by supporting a revolt among the lower MacWilliam Bourkes, to the chagrin of Lord President Richard Bingham. O&#x27;Donnell imposed his control over Tyrconnell. He dispelled bandits from Barnesmore Gap, established an execution site at Mullaghnashee beside Ballyshannon Castle, and took pledges from all nobles wealthy enough to maintain four horsemen.

O&#x27;Donnell dispatched letters to the state informing of his inauguration and giving justification for attacking Turlough Luineach. He sarcastically offered to submit to FitzWilliam in person if he was lent £800 or £900. FitzWilliam recognised the necessity of conciliating with O&#x27;Donnell. He reprimanded O&#x27;Donnell for his arrogance but promised, if they could meet at Dundalk by 16 July O.S. 6 July], to pardon his escape and lend him £200. Tyrone was anxious to improve his own standing with the government, and at FitzWilliam&#x27;s request, he travelled to Donegal to confer with O&#x27;Donnell. After some convincing, O&#x27;Donnell accompanied Tyrone to Dundalk to submit to FitzWilliam and gain government recognition. Bribery was probably involved in the meeting, which took place in a church on 12 August O.S. 2 August] 1592. According to Thomas Lee, O&#x27;Donnell bribed FitzWilliam with £500 to ensure favourable negotiations. O&#x27;Donnell made various agreements with FitzWilliam: he pledged his loyalty to Elizabeth I, agreed to receive a Sheriff in Tyrconnell, promised to pay his father&#x27;s covenanted rents, to treat his rivals (O&#x27;Doherty, Niall Garve and Hugh McHugh Dubh) fairly, to banish Catholic clergy from Tyrconnell, and to avoid supporting the MacWilliam Bourkes in Connacht. O&#x27;Donnell successfully negotiated to retain about 100 redshanks in Tyrconnell for use as his mother&#x27;s bodyguards, ostensibly because O&#x27;Donnell was concerned for her safety. After the meeting, the two Hughs feasted at Dungannon where they further discussed their developing alliance. The submission to FitzWilliam put O&#x27;Donnell temporarily in favour with the government, and he took advantage of this to crush his opponents.

In June 1593, Tyrone&#x27;s daughter Rose was escorted to Tyrconnell in expectation of her marriage to O&#x27;Donnell. The couple were formally married during Christmas-time at O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s house. According to McGettigan, the marriage started out as a success with Rose having some measure of influence over O&#x27;Donnell.

Despite his promises to FitzWilliam, O&#x27;Donnell subjugated his rivals. Sean O&#x27;Doherty was captured at a parley and imprisoned; only then did he acknowledge O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s lordship. In early 1593, O&#x27;Donnell obtained Hugh McHugh Dubh&#x27;s submission by taking his last stronghold at Belleek and beheading sixteen of his followers &quot;by train of a feigned treaty of friendship, mediated by Maguire&quot;. This sufficiently intimidated Niall Garve that he submitted to his younger cousin through fear. He was forced to turn over control of Lifford&#x27;s castle, though he did not give up his ambitions to seize the lordship. With the Tyrone-O&#x27;Donnell alliance against him, Turlough Luineach surrendered his lordship in May 1593. Tyrone took control of Tír Eoghain, making both O&#x27;Donnell and his father-in-law the rulers of the two major kingdoms of Gaelic Ulster.

== Initial rebellion ==

=== Conference of bishops ===

By late 1592 the Crown&#x27;s continual advances into Ireland, as well as the recent executions of chieftains Hugh Roe MacMahon (1590) and Brian O&#x27;Rourke (1591) had created a fierce resentment in the Gaelic nobility and Irish clergy. Catholic priests were suffering harassment and imprisonment from English authorities, and Spain had been a refuge to the Irish Catholic clergy since the 1570s. Archbishop Edmund MacGauran returned from Spain having met with King Philip II in September 1592. MacGauran was eager to obtain Spanish military aid to combat English forces in Ireland. Philip II promised support, as he wanted Ireland as an ally in the Anglo-Spanish War, but only if Ireland proved itself by launching prior military action. Thus MacGauran sought powerful Irish lords willing to openly rebel against the Crown. He organised a conference of seven Catholic bishops in Tyrconnell that December. The bishops saw O&#x27;Donnell as their main hope, and declared he was &quot;fittest for the part&quot; and thus to be &quot;their leader or general&quot;. On 8 April 1593, O&#x27;Donnell addressed Irish nobles living in Spain: &quot;I and the other chiefs who have united with me and are striving to defend ourselves, cannot hold out long against the power of the Crown of England without the aid of his Grace the Catholic King... We have thought it well to send the Archbishop of Tuam James O&#x27;Hely] to treat of this matter with his Majesty&quot;.

=== Maguire&#x27;s revolt ===
Captain Willis was appointed by FitzWilliam as Sheriff of Fermanagh against Maguire&#x27;s will. In early April 1593, Willis entered Fermanagh with at least 100 men and began violently pillaging and raiding. This exacerbated resentment towards the Crown, and after Willis&#x27; first offensive, O&#x27;Donnell met with MacGauran, Maguire, Brian Oge O&#x27;Rourke and Theobald, Richard and John Bourke at Enniskillen Castle on 8 May. MacGauran advised that the noblemen sign a letter addressed to Philip II which emphasised their oppression and which requested urgent reinforcements from the Spanish army. Archbishop O&#x27;Hely was tasked with delivering the confederates&#x27; messages: two letters from O&#x27;Donnell, one letter from MacGauran, and the 8 May letter signed by the confederates.Maguire managed to obtain reinforcements from Tyrone&#x27;s brother and foster-brothers, who were likely involved on Tyrone&#x27;s behalf. Similarly to O&#x27;Donnell, Maguire besieged Willis and his men in a church and planned to starve them out, but Tyrone intervened and negotiated their safe rescue. Maguire&#x27;s revolt marked the start of the Nine Years&#x27; War.

Historians have debated on O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s position within the confederacy. Historians Nicholas Canny, Michael Finnegan, John J. Silke and Darren McGettigan credit O&#x27;Donnell as the confederacy&#x27;s driving force until Tyrone&#x27;s break into open rebellion. Historians Hiram Morgan and James O&#x27;Neill have disputed this by emphasising that Tyrone was a more important figure who hid his allegiance to the confederacy for strategic reasons. The Sheriff of Monaghan alleged that Tyrone attended the meeting at Enniskillen Castle, though Tyrone did not sign MacGauran&#x27;s letter. Around August 1593, Maguire stated to a spy that Tyrone had pushed him into rebellion and &quot;promised to assist him &amp; bear him owt in his warre&quot;. O&#x27;Hely reached the Spanish court by September 1593 where he met with Juan de Idiáquez, the royal secretary. In Idiáquez&#x27;s notes to Philip II, he notes that the early confederates wanted Tyrone to join them in open rebellion, though it appears Tyrone refused to publicly defy the Crown without reassurance that Spanish reinforcements would arrive.

=== Secret rebellion ===

Catholic bishops began to spread the Aodh Eangach prophecy to advance the Irish rebellion. Maguire continued to rebel by attacking English forces. He was joined by O&#x27;Rourke who had been fighting Bingham since his late father&#x27;s expulsion from West Breifne in 1590. O&#x27;Donnell aided the growing rebellion by sending MacSweeney gallowglass, but publicly he feigned neutrality. O&#x27;Donnell chose to conceal his rebellion because he lacked sufficient forces; he also faced pressure from his father-in-law to likewise appear publicly loyal to the Crown. Bingham put Maguire and O&#x27;Rourke under heavy pressure, and O&#x27;Donnell used their chiefdoms as a buffer between Bingham&#x27;s forces and Tyrconnell. O&#x27;Donnell had some influence over Maguire, giving him advice and sheltering his creaghts on Tyrconnell&#x27;s borders. MacGauran was killed on 3 July O.S. 23 June] 1593 whilst accompanying Maguire on a raid. In September, O&#x27;Donnell sent his mother to Scotland to secure further Scottish troops.

Maguire&#x27;s rebellious activity provoked a large-scale military expedition led by Marshal Henry Bagenal, which culminated at the Battle of Belleek in October. Tyrone fought on Bagenal&#x27;s side ostensibly to prove his loyalty to the Crown. O&#x27;Donnell was in nearby Ballyshannon when the battle was taking place, but he was ordered by Tyrone not to reinforce Maguire. The battle was a ploy to make the confederacy seem weaker than it actually was, thus diverting English attention away from Ireland. O&#x27;Donnell partially disobeyed Tyrone&#x27;s order and sent 60 horsemen, 60 swordsmen and 100 gallowglass under the command of Niall Garve. Historian James O&#x27;Neill has theorised that O&#x27;Donnell intentionally dispatched Niall Garve to Belleek with the hope that he would die in the slaughter, thus easily eliminating a potential enemy. Bagenal&#x27;s forces won the battle. Despite the successful ploy, the battle was damaging to O&#x27;Donnell. Many of the gallowglass were killed and Niall Garve survived. To placate the Crown&#x27;s victorious army, O&#x27;Donnell sent 115 cattle to the English camp as a gift.

By November 1593, Bingham had received intelligence that O&#x27;Donnell was secretly assisting Maguire and O&#x27;Rourke. The Crown demanded that Tyrone discipline O&#x27;Donnell and bring him under control, and in March 1594, Tyrone and O&#x27;Donnell met with government commissioners near Dundalk. O&#x27;Donnell professed that &quot;his ancestors had always been loyal to her majesty, and so he would continue but stood in danger of his life and feared practices would be used against him&quot;. Tyrone submitted a list of his and O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s grievances, but the talks ended in confusion when O&#x27;Donnell threatened to kill some of Tyrone&#x27;s English friends. Afterwards government commissioners surmised that a confederacy had been established between the Ulster lords. In March 1594, Philip II sent a Spanish ship—containing O&#x27;Hely, Spanish experts and Irish émigrés—to Ireland on a reconnaissance mission, but the crew died when it was shipwrecked off the coast of Santander.

=== Open rebellion ===

O&#x27;Donnell was aware that Tyrconnell would become an easy target if Maguire and O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s territories were occupied by the English. In February 1594, O&#x27;Donnell demolished castles in Belleek and Bundrowes to prevent English forces from taking them, and he concentrated his forces at Ballyshannon on his mother&#x27;s advice. Early that same month, Captain John Dowdall captured Enniskillen Castle, Maguire&#x27;s stronghold, after a nine-day siege. O&#x27;Donnell rushed to Maguire&#x27;s aid, assembling an army and joining Maguire to retake the castle. O&#x27;Donnell stated he &quot;would not leave that siege until he had eaten the last cow in his country&quot;. The castle was blockaded by 11 June (Old Style), and by late July the English soldiers were suffering from food shortages. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s decision to join the siege of Enniskillen brought his rebellion into the open.

O&#x27;Donnell encountered resistance from his family, with both his brother Rory and his father Hugh MacManus opposing his choice to go to war. Frustrated with Tyrone&#x27;s loyalist facade, O&#x27;Donnell warned Tyrone that he &quot;must consider [Tyrone] his enemy, unless he came to his aid in such a pinch&quot;. Tyrone subsequently sent reinforcements under his brother Cormac MacBaron to the Battle of the Ford of the Biscuits. O&#x27;Donnell continued to negotiate through his father-in-law; in August, Tyrone presented the new Lord Deputy, William Russell, with a lengthy document of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s grievances and demands, titled &quot;A note of such oppressions and indirect courses as hath been held in Tirconnell and other places&quot;. O&#x27;Donnell requested a general pardon for himself and his followers, as well as &quot;good security&quot; for Maguire, O&#x27;Rourke and rebels in County Monaghan. Russell ignored these demands and resupplied Enniskillen castle with 1,200 Irish Army soldiers—comprising most of the troops at his disposal. The English relief mission was successful but ominously peaceful—Russell lost communication with his spies as they had all been captured by confederate soldiers. By early 1595, Tyrone had finally joined O&#x27;Donnell in open rebellion with an assault on the Blackwater Fort.

=== Expansion into Connacht ===

In 1595, O&#x27;Donnell began to expand his rebellion into Connacht. His ancestors (particularly his grandfather Manus O&#x27;Donnell) had ruled over Lower Connacht, and Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell increasingly demanded the restoration of these lands. Richard Bingham had persecuted Connacht&#x27;s Gaelic population since the mid-1580s, causing many refugees to flee to Tyrconnell. O&#x27;Donnell aided the refugees and recruited many of them as swordsmen. O&#x27;Donnell resented Bingham and was &quot;easily tempted&quot; by the refugees, who urged him to attack Bingham&#x27;s administration. O&#x27;Donnell invaded Connacht on 3 March (Old Style) 1595 with 400 men. From Rathcroghan, the province&#x27;s ancient royal capital, he launched large raids into Longford and Roscommon. In June 1595, the castle of Sligo, which was key to securing control over the province, was betrayed to O&#x27;Donnell &quot;in a stroke of luck&quot;; Bingham&#x27;s government collapsed. O&#x27;Donnell reestablished brehon law and asserted suzerainty over north Connacht. According to Ó Cléirigh, O&#x27;Donnell &quot;spared no one over fifteen years of age who could not speak Irish&quot;.

By 1595, O&#x27;Donnell and his wife were facing difficulties; Rose had not born him children. In order to increase his influence in southern Connacht, O&#x27;Donnell had hopes of a marriage alliance with Lady Margaret Burke, daughter of the neutral 3rd Earl of Clanricarde. With Tyrone&#x27;s consent, Rose and O&#x27;Donnell separated, purportedly over her &quot;barrenness&quot;. However the government became aware of his plan to reportedly &quot;rob her from her parents by surprise or force&quot;, and in December Margaret was placed in protective custody. Additionally Clanricarde stated that he would &quot;rather see [Margaret&#x27;s] burial than her marriage to [O&#x27;Donnell] were he a good subject&quot;. Tyrone sent his trusted secretary Henry Hovenden to Tyrconnell to advise O&#x27;Donnell, and O&#x27;Donnell eventually took Rose back. His choice to remain in a barren marriage is representative of his dependence on Tyrone.

== Peace talks ==

=== Negotiations with the Crown ===

Tyrone and O&#x27;Donnell sought to delay the war in order to buy time for the arrival of Spanish troops, and in September 1595, Tyrone sent overtures of submission to the Crown. Tyrone convinced O&#x27;Donnell to submit to the authorities and agree to a ceasefire whilst the settlement could be negotiated. He tendered his submission in October, expressing his &quot;inward sorrow and most harty repentance&quot;. A cessation of arms was signed on 27 October 1595 (Old Style). O&#x27;Donnell took advantage of the truce to intervene in Connacht politics. Accompanied by Cormac MacBaron and Tyrone&#x27;s son Conn, he led a large force of troops into Mayo in December. During Christmas-time, O&#x27;Donnell stage-managed the election of Connacht exile Tibbot MacWalter Kittagh as the Lower MacWilliam Bourke. Further elections organised by O&#x27;Donnell, spanning four counties, were indicative of his growing power in Connacht.

In January 1596, O&#x27;Donnell and Tyrone entered into face-to-face negotiations with government commissioners. The two confederates refused to meet the commissioners anywhere except in the open fields, thus negotiations were conducted in the countryside near Dundalk. O&#x27;Donnell demanded his ancestral claims of lands in Sligo, exemption from the jurisdiction of a sheriff, and a pardon for Connacht men including O&#x27;Rourke and MacWilliam Bourke. Similarly to Tyrone he demanded religious liberty of conscience. The queen warily accepted O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s claims to lands in Connacht. On 28 January (Old Style), the commissioners presented O&#x27;Donnell with a list of twelve articles. These urged him to disperse his forces, to shire Tyrconnell, to stop aiding O&#x27;Rourke and Maguire, to re-edify Sligo Castle, to pay annual rents to the Crown as his father had done, and to confess the extent of his dealings with Spain. O&#x27;Donnell agreed to most articles, with some exceptions. He refused to give hostages or make a personal submission. A compromise was created, and O&#x27;Donnell agreed to terms on 30 January (Old Style). A hollow peace was signed on 24 April 1596 (Old Style), and further negotiations to develop a peace treaty were almost complete by May.

=== Relations with Spain ===
In May, three Spanish ships arrived at Tyrconnell with the aim of encouraging the confederates and assessing Ireland&#x27;s military situation. Spanish captain Alonso Cobos arrived in Killybegs and was invited by O&#x27;Donnell to Lifford, where he was staying. O&#x27;Donnell refused to go further into conversation without Tyrone present &quot;because there was one above him naming [Tyrone], which if he would consent unto it he would do the same&quot;. O&#x27;Donnell called the confederates to Lifford and in the meantime, he entertained Cobos and his men for three nights. When the confederates arrived at Lifford, a subsequent dinner took place. The confederates upheld their allegiance to Spain and pleaded for Philip II to re-establish Catholicism across Ireland.

Later on, a secret talk between Cobos and O&#x27;Donnell, Tyrone, and Cormac MacBaron occurred in a small house beside Lifford&#x27;s castle. Hugh Boye MacDavitt of Inishowen, a war veteran who had served in the Low Countries, served as their interpreter. After the meeting, the confederates jointly agreed to abandon the peace treaty and become vassals of Philip II. Tyrone and O&#x27;Donnell also petitioned Philip II to make Albert VII, Archduke of Austria the new monarch of Ireland. O&#x27;Donnell and his father-in-law began to deliberately derail peace negotiations and provoke war in previously peaceful parts of the country. They developed a sophisticated &quot;good cop—bad cop&quot; routine which they used to stall peace talks. Additionally, O&#x27;Donnell was ashamed at the sparse nature of his residence and set about purchasing &quot;linen and pewter and all other necessaries fit to entertain the Spaniards&quot;.

The confederate lords of Connacht refused to discuss peace talks with government commissioners until the arrival of O&#x27;Donnell, who was apparently delayed by dealings with Redshanks. When O&#x27;Donnell arrived that June, he refused to hand over English hostages until his terms were met. Tyrone sent Hovenden to ostensibly aid O&#x27;Donnell in pacifying Connacht, but the government intercepted a letter revealing that Hovenden was intentionally stalling negotiations so that Tyrone would have to be brought in as an arbitrator; this he eventually was. The commissioners were in a weak position with the aging Elizabeth I in poor health. Soon after, O&#x27;Donnell met with Tyrone, O&#x27;Rourke and MacWilliam Bourke at Strabane. Together, they issued a letter to Munster&#x27;s population demanding they adhere to Catholicism and join the confederacy. In October, Cobos was sent back to Ireland to brief the confederates on the impending 2nd Spanish Armada. Cobos&#x27;s briefing motivated O&#x27;Donnell to make extensive preparations for the arrival of Spanish troops in Tyrconnell. After much delay, the Armada sailed from Lisbon in late October 1596, though it ended in disaster when a sudden storm claimed over 3,000 lives.

Elizabeth I reopened negotiations in Dundalk. Ó Cléirigh states that Elizabeth offered to forfeit Ulster to the confederates (with the exception of land from Dundalk to the Boyne). O&#x27;Donnell was apparently instrumental in the confederacy&#x27;s rejection of this offer—he was possibly motivated by Philip II&#x27;s recently renewed interest in Ireland. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s relationships to Spain and England were complicated by the fact that aging monarchs Philip II and Elizabeth I were both in ill health at the time.

== Renewal of hostilities ==

=== Clifford&#x27;s presidency ===
Elizabeth I suspended Bingham from the presidency of Connacht. Conyers Clifford, a distinguished soldier favoured by the Irish, was made Connacht&#x27;s chief commissioner in December 1596. O&#x27;Donnell again raided into Connacht in January 1597, sacking Athenry and plundering the suburbs of Galway city. He was supported by competitors to the Clanricarde title. Clifford responded by forcing MacWilliam Bourke from Mayo. O&#x27;Donnell reinstalled MacWilliam Bourke, but Clifford forced him out again in June.

Thomas Burgh took over as Lord Deputy on 22 May 1597 (Old Style). Burgh refused to entertain the confederates&#x27; excuses and ordered prompt military attacks on both Tyrone and O&#x27;Donnell. In July, the English launched a two-pronged assault in Ulster; Clifford assembled 1,500 men at Boyle and led them into Tyrconnell as the western arm of the assault. Clifford&#x27;s army besieged Ballyshannon castle for five days, but it was successfully defended by O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s garrison of eighty men, which included Spaniards. Once O&#x27;Donnell himself arrived, Clifford&#x27;s army, which had exhausted its supplies, retreated to Sligo, abandoning three pieces of ordnance and losing many men. On 4 September 1597 (Old Style), Clifford was appointed as Connacht&#x27;s new Lord President. Lord Deputy Burgh died from illness in October.

Despite the confederacy&#x27;s advantageous position, Tyrone renewed peace negotiations. He submitted to authorities on 22 December (Old Style) and promised to renounce his Gaelic titles and rebellious activities. O&#x27;Donnell heavily criticised Tyrone for agreeing to a cessation, pointing out that the confederate forces were strong across Leinster, Connacht and Ulster. O&#x27;Donnell declared that he would break the cessation, though he never did.

Clifford changed tactics following the defeat at Ballyshannon. He encouraged confederates to change sides by promising them royal grants. In February 1598, founding confederacy member O&#x27;Rourke submitted at Boyle. By April, Clifford had lured further confederates Conor McDermot, O&#x27;Connor Don and Shane MacManus Oge (O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s cousin). In response, O&#x27;Donnell executed six of McDermot and O&#x27;Connor Don&#x27;s pledges. He detained Shane MacManus Oge upon the latter&#x27;s secret return to Tyrconnell. O&#x27;Donnell also killed sixteen of Mulmurry MacSweeney na dTuath&#x27;s men when MacSweeney na dTuath was linked to Shane MacManus Oge. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s younger brother Rory was also engaged by Clifford, and he resolved to serve against his brother. When this news reached O&#x27;Donnell, he had Rory clamped in chains—the brothers&#x27; relationship eventually improved and by 1600 Rory was once again fighting alongside his older brother. O&#x27;Donnell captured O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s brother Teigue and forced him to marry his sister Mary O&#x27;Donnell, in order to formalise an alliance and antagonise O&#x27;Rourke. By June 1598, O&#x27;Rourke had rejoined the confederacy in fear.

=== Battle of the Yellow Ford ===

Government commissioners abandoned negotiations by spring 1598, recognising that O&#x27;Donnell and Tyrone were intentionally impeding the peace process. Tyrone was granted a pardon in April 1598. However he felt that the Crown would eventually supersede his authority in Ulster. When the truce expired in June, Tyrone besieged the Blackwater fort. Bagenal encouraged for a relief exercise to be sent to the fort.
Tyrone called O&#x27;Donnell and Maguire to assemble their combined forces, numbering 5,000 men. The confederates made extensive plans to obstruct Bagenal&#x27;s army. They prepared deep trenches in the ground outside Armagh. Prior to the attack, the confederates made a speech &quot;to incite their people to acts of valour&quot;. On 14 August (Old Style), whilst crossing the River Callan, Bagenal&#x27;s army was attacked by the combined forces of O&#x27;Donnell, Tyrone and Maguire. O&#x27;Donnell attacked from the left and Tyrone from the right simultaneously. Bagenal was killed and roughly 2,000 men (half his army) were lost. However O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s men ran out of ammunition and the English survivors fled to Armagh. More than 300 English soldiers deserted to the confederacy.

The battle was the greatest victory by Irish forces against England, and it sparked a general revolt throughout the country, particularly the south. News of the battle spread across western Europe, prompting Philip II to send a congratulatory letters to O&#x27;Donnell and Tyrone. Philip II died in September and was succeeded by his son Philip III. Following the battle, O&#x27;Donnell purchased Ballymote Castle from Clan MacDonagh and made it his primary residence. He sent Sean O&#x27;Doherty, Donough MacSweeney Banagh and MacWilliam Bourke to successfully attack the O&#x27;Malleys in County Mayo. In December, O&#x27;Donnell led another successful raid into Clanricarde.

The confederates&#x27; victory unravelled much of Clifford&#x27;s success in Connacht, leaving loyalist Donough O&#x27;Connor Sligo (lord of Lower Connacht) as his only Gaelic Irish ally. The Irish victory at the Yellow Ford was highly distressing to the English Privy Council, and after much hesitation Elizabeth I appointed her royal favourite Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, as the new Lord Deputy. He arrived at Dublin in April 1599. Despite the generous resources afforded to him, Essex&#x27;s campaign was a major failure on account of his poor generalship.

=== Battle of Curlew Pass ===
In July 1599, Essex sent O&#x27;Connor Sligo to confront O&#x27;Donnell. In response, O&#x27;Donnell quickly laid siege to O&#x27;Connor Sligo&#x27;s stronghold, Collooney Castle. Essex then ordered Clifford to relieve O&#x27;Connor Sligo, and Clifford subsequently led an expedition of 1,400 men towards Collooney Castle. O&#x27;Donnell left Niall Garve to continue the siege and he took up a position in the Curlew Mountains, where he remained for two months, deliberately provoking Clifford. In August, Clifford finally gave in and marched his troops into the Curlew Mountains. O&#x27;Donnell made a dramatic speech and prepared his men.

Once O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s brothers had lured Clifford&#x27;s army into a prepared position, O&#x27;Donnell and O&#x27;Rourke (who was camped nearby) ambushed Clifford&#x27;s forces in a swift battle. The English panicked and were routed back to Boyle Abbey. 240 English soldiers were killed, including Clifford who was stabbed by a pike. After the battle, O&#x27;Rourke decapitated Clifford and gave the head to O&#x27;Donnell. When O&#x27;Donnell presented Clifford&#x27;s severed head to O&#x27;Connor Sligo, the latter surrendered Collooney Castle and was subsequently imprisoned. O&#x27;Donnell later carried the head around as a trophy. The queen and her secretary of state Robert Cecil were shocked by the Irish victory. The victory is viewed as a highlight of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s career, though contemporary sources credit O&#x27;Rourke and McDermot with the battle&#x27;s success.

O&#x27;Donnell forced O&#x27;Connor Sligo to join the confederacy, and he gave O&#x27;Connor Sligo &quot;large numbers&quot; of oxen, horses, cattle and corn to re-establish himself in lower Connacht. However he threatened O&#x27;Connor Sligo with imprisonment on an island in Lough Eske if he did not cooperate. By this time Iníon Dubh had been in Scotland for two months gathering redshanks—as Clifford&#x27;s forces had been easily defeated, O&#x27;Donnell notified his mother that the redshanks were unnecessary, and she returned to Tyrconnell in January 1600 with gunpowder instead. O&#x27;Donnell followed the victory at Curlew Pass with a successful battle at the Ballaghboy Pass.

=== Quarrels with Tyrone ===

By the late 1590s, O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s relationship with his father-in-law was coming under strain, not least because of the breakdown of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s marriage. The &quot;Calendar of State Papers&quot; makes reference to &quot;some breach between Tirone and O Donnell about Tirone&#x27;s daughter&quot; on 2 April 1596 (Old Style). It was reported in April 1597 that O&#x27;Donnell had recently renewed his alliance with Tyrone, and that &quot;their league of friendship is more apparently confirmed... by O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s receiving of the earl&#x27;s base daughter&quot; in marriage. By 1598, it was reported O&#x27;Donnell had divorced Rose on account of her &quot;barronness&quot;. The divorce was most likely against Tyrone&#x27;s wishes. Rose remarried to Tyrone&#x27;s principal vassal Donnell Ballagh O&#x27;Cahan in 1599.

The confederacy leaders argued over the division of money and munitions sent from Spain. Tyrone typically demanded the superior portion; when munitions arrived in 1596, Tyrone took twenty firkins of gunpowder compared to O&#x27;Donnell receiving fifteen. This came to a head in mid-1599, when O&#x27;Donnell debated over the division of a delivery brought by Barrionuevo. O&#x27;Donnell felt he was owed more resources in view of his recent victories, as well as his riskier approach to warfare. According to a spy&#x27;s report, &quot;Tyrone and O&#x27;Donnell fell into some contention about receiving of the said munition and treasure, Tyrone challenging the disposal of the whole, as chief and general of the common service, and O&#x27;Donnell claiming as great a right in it as he, as he affirmed, as deeply engaged therein as he. In the end the assembly there (by mediation of an Irish bishop from Rome with them) overruled the disposition of the whole for Tyrone&quot;. A treaty of equality was established between the two men, which decreed that &quot;one had no pre-eminence over the other and that in walking and travelling together whichever was the elder should be on the right hand&quot;.

Tyrone refused to fight Essex&#x27;s dwindling forces; instead the two men parleyed on 7 September (Old Style) 1599 and a six-week truce was organised. O&#x27;Donnell was furious at Tyrone&#x27;s decision to negotiate with Essex, as he wanted to avoid any association with English officials in favour of soliciting aid from the Spanish. He declared that he would travel into Connacht, but Tyrone forbid him on account of the truce. O&#x27;Donnell admitted that he would burn the entire Pale if not for Tyrone preventing him. Essex left Ireland on 24 September (Old Style) and was shortly afterwards removed from his post. Essex&#x27;s downfall briefly put the confederacy in a strong position. In February 1600, Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy, arrived in Ireland as the new Lord Deputy. Mountjoy posed a major threat to the confederacy as he immediately began revitalising and restoring confidence in the royal army.

On 11 March O.S. 1 March] 1600, Hugh Maguire was shot and killed whilst on reconnaissance near Cork. His lordship was contested by rival claimants Cúconnacht Maguire (his younger half-brother) and Connor Roe Maguire (his loyalist-leaning cousin). Tyrone favoured Connor Roe&#x27;s accession, perhaps to ensure Connor Roe&#x27;s loyalism was kept in check. O&#x27;Donnell favoured Cúconnacht, and a debate ensued on how to resolve the succession crisis. At a banquet at Tyrone&#x27;s house in Dungannon, with Tyrone and both claimants present, O&#x27;Donnell addressed Cúconnacht as the new Maguire clan chief. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s fait accompli affronted Tyrone and created further tension between the confederates.

In April 1600, a Spanish ship arrived in Ireland bearing considerable supplies of money and ammunition for the confederacy, as well as letters from Philip III. Tyrone and O&#x27;Donnell stimulated the Irish-Spanish alliance by sending pledges to Spain; Tyrone sent his son Henry, and O&#x27;Donnell sent the sons of O&#x27;Doherty and O&#x27;Gallagher. Despite these actions, the Spanish government failed to send the confederacy the resources they desired. O&#x27;Donnell was reportedly &quot;like a madman when he saw no kind of news, neither of men nor money to come&quot;.

== Forced from Tyrconnell ==

=== Henry Docwra ===
In May 1600, English commander Henry Docwra established an English garrison in Derry. O&#x27;Donnell made a substantial attempt to weaken Docwra&#x27;s forces on 29 July (Old Style). O&#x27;Donnell captured at least 60 horses and Docwra was nearly killed by Hugh McHugh Dubh. The poor conditions at the Derry garrison meant that desertion and disease was rife. O&#x27;Donnell later made a failed night attack on the garrison. The confederates&#x27; failure to drive away Docwra&#x27;s forces led to further tension between O&#x27;Donnell and Tyrone.

=== Defection of Niall Garve ===
Docwra opened up secret communications with dissatisfied confederates. Niall Garve&#x27;s grievances were well-known and Docwra had special instructions to win him over. By August, Niall Garve sent through his list of demands, the principal of which was to rule Tyrconnell. Docwra promised to obtain a royal grant of Tyrconnell if Niall Garve defected and served against his cousin. The government knew about Niall&#x27;s grievances on account of his overtures.

In September 1600, Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell left Ulster for a raid in Clare, leaving Niall Garve in charge of besieging Docwra at Derry. Niall Garve and his followers murdered Niall Garve&#x27;s uncle Neachtan O&#x27;Donnell in a drunken rage. Neachtan was &quot;a man of great authority with [Hugh Roe] and all his country&quot;. Fearing the return and revenge of his cousin Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell, Niall Garve quickly defected to the English. He joined Docwra on 3 October (Old Style).

Even worse for O&#x27;Donnell was a regime change war launched by Niall Garve, based on Sir Henry Docwra&#x27;s agreement to support his claim to the O&#x27;Donnell Chiefdom. Niall Garve&#x27;s brothers and an estimated one thousand Clan O&#x27;Donnell warriors also joined his efforts to wrest the White wand away from Hugh Roe with the support of the Crown.

Niall Garve&#x27;s support, however, allowed the Tudor navy under Docwra and Willis to land a seaborne force at Derry into the heart of Tyrconnell and also capture Clan O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s traditional stronghold, which Hugh Roe had entrusted to Niall Garve, in the Battle of Lifford. O&#x27;Donnell was shocked to hear of Niall Garve&#x27;s betrayal, and was unable to drink or sleep for three days.

In response, Hugh Roe&#x27;s sister Nuala separated from her husband, joined the court of her brother, and brought her children with her. Meanwhile, Hugh Roe was at the head of his army in Thomond when he received word of Niall Garve&#x27;s uprising. O&#x27;Donnell and his followers immediately hurried back to Tyrconnell to retake control of his native district.

According to a report by Docwra, O&#x27;Donnell was so outraged by his brother-in-law&#x27;s defection that he ordered mass hangings of Niall Garve&#x27;s followers, and personally killed Niall Garve&#x27;s four-year-old son (his own nephew) by bashing the child&#x27;s brains out against a post. This accusation is considered contentious among historians. Docwra&#x27;s biographer John McGurk acknowledges the uncertainty of the report&#x27;s truthfulness. He points out that Docwra&#x27;s &quot;blunt&quot; personality would indicate that he reported current affairs accurately, though it is unclear where Docwra received this intelligence. McGurk also acknowledges that infanticide was a feature of warfare in the early modern period. Morgan notes that since this is a contemporary account, it should not be dismissed out of hand.

Allegations about O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s murder of her child, however, do not explain why Nuala did not similarly change her allegiance, as the code of conduct would have demanded. It is very well-documented, in fact, that Nuala remained loyal to her half-brother and his siblings, for which she has been praised in Irish bardic poetry. The Hiberno-Latin historians from Donegal Abbey did not consider Niall Garve&#x27;s efforts to seize the Chiefdom to be justified under the traditional code of conduct and according denounced Niall Garve as, &quot;a traitor&quot; and &quot;a perfidious wretch.&quot; O&#x27;Sullivan Beare, on the other hand, was more nuanced in his assessment, &quot;Garve was a man of great spirit and daring, skilled in military matters and had many of the men of Tyrconnell on his side, fortified by whose aid and valour he did not decline a fight with the Catholics in the open. However, he always retained the Catholic Faith and kept aloof from heretical rites.&quot; Conversely, historian Jerrold Casway claims that Nuala had no children. Subsequently, Nuala resided with her brother Rory.

=== Battle of Lifford ===
According to Philip O&#x27;Sullivan Beare, &quot;There was frequent and sharp fighting between the Catholics and royalists round Derry and Lifford. We may mention a cavalry fight in which the royalists being routed, Manus, brother of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s, would have run through with his spear Garve as he retired, had not the blow been parried Owen O&#x27;Gallagher, surnamed Oge, a comrade of Manus, but actuated by his devotion and affection for Niall&#x27;s family who were their lords. Cornelius O&#x27;Gallagher was differently disposed to this family, and is said to have persuaded Garve to go over to the English, and who wounded Manus at Monin, near Lifford, where a cavalry fight was suddenly sprung on both parties and Manus charging into five Irish royalists was struck in the right side by a spear thrust from Grave and being surrounded was struck by Cornelius under the shoulder. However, the points of the spears did not penetrate the cuirass, but nevertheless reached the body of Manus. Roderick coming to his brother&#x27;s aid aimed his spear at Garve&#x27;s breast. Garve tightening the reins raised his horse&#x27;s head which received Roderick&#x27;s blow by which the horse fell dead under Garve; but he, lifted up by his men, returned to Lifford when O&#x27;Donnell was coming up with the foot. Manus died of his wounds after fifteen days and shortly after Cornelius was captured by O&#x27;Donnell and hanged.&quot;

Manus died on 22 October 1600 and was buried at Donegal Abbey. His father Hugh MacManus died of old age on 7 December 1600 and was also buried at Donegal Abbey, where the O&#x27;Donnell clan chiefs were typically buried.

In November 1600, O&#x27;Donnell schemed to marry Joan FitzGerald, sister of loyalist James FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond. Towards the end of the year Lord President of Munster George Carew blocked this by placing Joan under house arrest.

Docwra was reportedly delighted by Niall Garve&#x27;s role in the slaying of Hugh Roe&#x27;s brother Manus. Niall Garve had previously shown signs of wanting to call off the uprising and make peace with his cousin and brother in law, but Docwra knew that the death of Manus O&#x27;Donnell represented such an insult under the traditional honour code as to make a peaceful solution far more difficult if not outright impossible. Even so, Niall Garve is still said to have tried to arrange one.

=== Siege of Donegal ===

On 10 August 1601, the monks of Donegal Abbey carefully removed all sacred objects and fled by ship from their enclosure shortly before Niall Garve O&#x27;Donnell seized control of the monastery buildings and fortified them with earthenworks, which he built with the assistance of Tudor navy engineers, who also helped him to repair the dilapidated buildings of Donegal Castle for the expected siege by Hugh Roe&#x27;s forces.

According to the history of Donegal Abbey, &quot;Meanwhile, O&#x27;Donnell arrived, pitched his camp at Carrig, within two thousand paces of Donegal, and resolved to give Nial and his followers no rest, night or day, as long as they remained within the desecrated walls. A series of hand to hand conflicts, in which Nial&#x27;s people suffered severely, ensued; and in the course of a fortnight many of the revolted Irish, repenting their treason, deserted in twos and threes to our Prince&#x27;s camp.&quot;

According to the history of Donegal Abbey, &quot;Cooped up in the monasteries, so vigilantly watched by O&#x27;Donnell that they could not come out into the open country to lift preys, Nial&#x27;s people began to mutiny; when on the night of Michaelmas, the powder stored in the monastery of Donegal took fire, whether accidentally or by the special interposition of Heaven I know not, and exploded with a terrible crash, that was heard far out at sea, may, scared the wild deer in the coverts of Barnesmore. Oh, the appalling spectacle! Hundreds of the besieged were blown to atoms; others, among the rest Nial&#x27;s own brother, were crushed to death by masses of the rent masonry; and all that night, while the woodwork blazed like a red volcano, in whose glare friend and foe were distinctly visible to each other, O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s swordsmen pressed the survivors back across the trenches into the flames, where upwards of a thousand of them perished miserably. Nor should it be forgotten that a ship, laden with munitions for the besieged, ran in a rock, and went to pieces that very night, just as she was entering the bay of Donegal. Next morning Nial proceeded unobserved by O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s troops, along the strand to Magherabeg, and returned, under cover of the guns of the English war vessel, with the soldiers he had left in that place, determined to maintain himself to the last among the smoldering ruins. O&#x27;Donnell immediately shifted his camp nearer to Donegal, and continued the siege till October; when, being informed that the Spaniards had landed at Kinsale, he struck his tents and marched to their assistance.&quot;

=== Siege of Kinsale ===

King Philip III of Spain had sent an armed expedition to Ireland to assist the Irish rebels. Under the command of General Don Juan del Águila, the expedition finally landed and was besieged by the English Army inside the walled city of Kinsale – at virtually the opposite end of Ireland from the Northern clans – in September 1601. Seeking to break the siege and rescue their Spanish allies, O&#x27;Donnell led his warriors in a hard march during the extremely bitter winter conditions of 1601, often covering over 40 miles a day, to join Tyrone and his warriors at Kinsale, arriving in early December 1601.En route, true to his family arms and Constantinian motto &quot;In Hoc Signo Vinces&quot; and in anticipation of the battle to come, Red Hugh visited and venerated the relic of the True Cross, the Holy rood, on the Feast of St. Andrew, on 30 November 1601 at Holy Cross Abbey, and removed a portion of it.
From there he dispatched an expedition to Ardfert in County Kerry, to win a quick victory and successfully recover the territory of his ally, James Fitzmaurice, Lord of Kerry, who had lost it and his 9-year-old son, to Sir Charles Wilmot. Red Hugh also left some O&#x27;Donnell clansmen behind in Ardfert to defend Clanmaurice country, notably his first cousin and nephew, Domhnall Óg, son of his late half-brother and rival for the succession, Sir Domhnall O&#x27;Donnell, and who appears in the FitzMaurice pardon of 16 July 1604.
At the Battle of Kinsale on (according to the Julian Calendar then used in Elizabethan era England: 24 December 1601) Gregorian Calendar: 5/6 January 1602, the combined forces of Irish clans were defeated by Baron Mountjoy. O&#x27;Donnell and his clansmen arrived as the defeated Irish clans were withdrawing with heavy losses from the field and he tried in vain to rally them, but in the end, Clan O&#x27;Donnell escaped the battle without serious losses. The defeat at Kinsale, for which O&#x27;Donnell unjustly blamed himself, would prove every bit as devastating for Gaelic Ireland as the Battle of Culloden would be for their fellow Gaels in Scotland in 1746.

Juan del Águila then surrendered Kinsale on terms and departed with his forces for Spain. Based almost certainly upon Jesuit lay brother and future Irish Catholic Martyr Dominic Collins&#x27; tactical assessments, Irish Jesuit priest and Spanish Royal Army military chaplain Fr. James Archer immediately engaged in recrimination. He accused Spanish expeditionary force commander Juan del Águila of cowardice, vacillation, and dereliction of duty for both refusing to heed the advice of the local Irish clans and refusing to sally forth and meet his Ulster allies at the critical point. Archer concluded, &quot;[He] has the reputation in other parts of being a brave soldier, but [in Ireland he was] cowardly and timorous.&quot;

Meanwhile, as the defeated Irish clans gathered in a conference at Innishannon, an outraged and heartbroken Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell announced his plans to travel to Spain to seek further reinforcements from King Philip III. This announcement devastated his supporters, who suspected, despite O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s vow he would return before the next spring with twenty thousand more Spanish Royal Army soldiers, that they would never see him again.

== Death in Spain ==

=== Travel to Spain ===
After the Irish defeat at Kinsale, O&#x27;Donnell left Ireland on 6 January 1602 and sailed to Corunna in Galicia, Spain, where many other Irish clan chiefs were already arriving as refugees with their families. O&#x27;Donnell travelled with Archbishop of Tuam Florence Conroy, Maurice MacDonough Ultach, Redmond Burke and Captain Hugh Mostian. They arrived in Luarca on 13 January after travelling through a stormy passage. On arrival O&#x27;Donnell was received with great honours by the Governor of Galicia and the Lord Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, where an Irish College was founded. He was also taken to &quot;visit the Tower of Brigantiums, where according to bardic legends the sons of Milesius left to the Isle of Destiny&quot;.

O&#x27;Donnell travelled to Valladolid to ask for further assistance from King Philip III. When he arrived in the Royal presence, O&#x27;Donnell knelt before the King and vowed not to rise until three requests were granted, &quot;The first is that you send a Spanish Army with me to Ireland. The second is that once you rule Ireland, I will be the most powerful Irish noble there. The third is that you protect the rights of the O&#x27;Donnells forever.&quot; The King immediately agreed and ordered O&#x27;Donnell to rise.

According to Irish historian John McCavitt, &quot;He made sure to position himself with a recognisable aristocratic rank while he also emphasised the Irish&#x27;s sacrifice for Spain in turning down the chance for peace with England in the hope a further Spanish invasion force would be sent to Ireland.&quot;

Tyrconnell physician Nial O&#x27;Glacan treated O&#x27;Donnell for a bubonic plague sore at the Spanish court. Whilst in Spain, O&#x27;Donnell asked to see Tyrone&#x27;s son Henry who was then studying in Salamanca. Henry was summoned to Zamora. O&#x27;Donnell spent less than a week in Zamora before moving on to La Coruña.

During his time at court, O&#x27;Donnell also spent much of his time assisting the gathering of evidence for the court martial of Juan del Aguila. After two weeks, however, the King granted O&#x27;Donnell a generous pension and reassigned him to supervise naval preparations for another Spanish expeditionary force at Coruña. The Spanish Council of State also reported to the King about O&#x27;Donnell, &quot;His zeal and loyalty should be highly praised... He should be assured that His Majesty regards the Irish Catholics as his subjects.&quot;

Upon his own arrival on 21 March 1602, Juan del Aguila was met at the quay of Coruña by a livid Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell, whom del Águila told in a buoyant, positive tone, &quot;Be of good comfort. We will have one more turn at Ireland.&quot; O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s reply is not recorded. The Venetian Ambassador to Spain reported, &quot;[The Spanish authorities] now insist that Águila made a mistake in coming to terms with the English and surrendering to them two places which he held. Some prophesy ill for him, declaring that he has escaped an honourable death in Ireland to meet with a shameful one in Spain.&quot;

The 31 July 1602 execution of the Duc de Biron, for allegedly plotting with Spanish backing to assassinate King Henry IV of France, brought France to the brink of entering the war as an ally of England and drastically increased the risk that further Spanish intervention in Ireland would result in French troops being dispatched there as well. Despite this fact, O&#x27;Donnell continued being told &quot;anything he wanted to hear&quot; by the Spanish Council of State. At the same time, according to intelligence reports received by George Carew, O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s reputation remained &quot;great in Spain&quot;, while there was widespread &quot;dislike of Don Juan.&quot; Feelings regarding both men remained almost identical in Ireland.

=== Illness and death ===

In the middle of 1602, Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell, suffering from &quot;anguish of heart and sickness of mind&quot;, finally left for Valladolid &quot;to go into the King&#x27;s presence again to learn the cause of the delay.&quot; O&#x27;Donnell unexpectedly fell ill at the Castle of Simancas.

O&#x27;Donnell was aware he was dying, and indicated that he was &quot;fearful of death, as is natural to my creaturely condition&quot;. He received the last rites and was attended by Archbishop Conroy and two Franciscans, Maurice MacDonough Ultach and Maurice MacSean Ultach. Also present were O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s secretary Matthew Tully and a physician named Álvarez. Irish doctor John Noonan attended O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s final illness.

O&#x27;Donnell made his will on 7 September, whilst on his deathbed. He dictated his will in Irish, but Conroy translated it into Castilian Spanish for the notary. O&#x27;Donnell was in an extremely weak physical condition; he could only blot the page when attempting to sign his signature. He warned against news of his death reaching Ireland before Spanish reinforcements arrived, as he believed the news would demotivate the confederacy and lead to a peace treaty with England. O&#x27;Donnell was content to be a vassal of the Spanish king if the Gaelic chiefs could keep their power over Ireland, which would effectively make Ireland a Spanish colony. O&#x27;Donnell bequeathed &quot;all [his] estates, lands, lordships and vassals&quot; to his younger brother Rory.

After over two weeks of bedridden suffering, Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell died at the Castle of Simancas on 10 September 1602. He was 29 years of age, and left no children.

=== Burial ===
In a letter dated 28 September, statesmen Thomas Goold informed the Privy Council of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s death and funeral. Ó Cléirigh described the funeral: &quot;His body was then taken to Valladolid, to the King&#x27;s Court, in a four-wheeled hearse, with great numbers of State officers, of the Council, and of the royal guard all round it, with blazing torches and bright flambeaux of beautiful waxlights blazing all round on each side of it&quot;. Per his will, O&#x27;Donnell was buried in the Convent of St. Francis in nearby Valladolid, specifically in the Chapel of Wonders (&quot;&quot;; also translated as the Chapel of Marvels). The Italian explorer Christopher Columbus was buried in the same convent almost 100 years earlier, and MacWilliam Bourke was buried there in November 1604.

=== Cause of death ===
Fr. Ludovico Mansoni, Papal Nuncio to Ireland, claimed that O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s death &quot;was caused by an extreme melancholia and disgust which took hold of him when buoyed up by hope as a result of the promises and letters he had received and thinking that finally he had secured powerful reinforcements, he saw the whole army suddenly diverted to Africa, without even a mention being made of Ireland&quot;.According to a now-debunked popular legend, O&#x27;Donnell was poisoned by James Blake, a Galway merchant hired as a spy for the English government. Blake approached George Carew, then-Lord President of Munster, with an offer to travel to Spain to assassinate O&#x27;Donnell. In a ciphered letter dated 28 May 1602 (Old Style), George Carew informed Mountjoy that &quot;&quot;James Blake&quot;...took a solemn oath to do service...and is gone into &quot;Spain&quot; with a determination (bound with many oaths) to &quot;kill O&#x27;Donnell&quot;&quot;. O&#x27;Donnell was aware that Blake was a security threat and he warned the king&#x27;s ministers &quot;not to trust this person with any secret information&quot;. Despite Blake&#x27;s oath to Carew, on 29 August at Valladolid he outlined a detailed plan to the Duke of Lerma for a Spanish expedition aimed at retaking Galway from English control. Given Blake&#x27;s apparent pro-Spanish sentiments, historians Frederick M. Jones and Micheline Kerney Walsh have questioned whether he was truly an English spy. Blake was considered unreliable by the English government, and it is now speculated that Blake was a Spanish agent who proposed the mission as a means of securing safe passage to Spain. Another ciphered letter was sent from Carew to Mountjoy on 9 October 1602 (Old Style): &quot;O&#x27;Donnell is dead... he is &quot;poisoned&quot; by &quot;James Blake&quot;, of whom your lordship hath been formerly acquainted... He never told the &quot;President&quot; in what &quot;manner&quot; he would &quot;kill&quot; him, but did assure him it &quot;should&quot; be effected&quot;. There is no evidence that Blake was successful in his promised assassination; when Carew heard of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s death, he would have naturally assumed that Blake was responsible.

Historians dismiss the theory that Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell was poisoned. It is more likely he died of illness. Prior to his death he &quot;vomited a worm fourteen measures long, a thing unheard of by the doctors and regarded by them as extraordinary&quot;. It was also reported that &quot;a kind of snake or serpent was found within him&quot;. This could indicate a tapeworm infection or a cancerous tumour.
=== End of the Nine Years&#x27; War ===

With O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s death, Spanish plans to send further assistance to the confederacy were abandoned. According to Des Ekin, &quot;The Duke of Lerma was in no hurry. He was still playing the long game. He aimed for peace with England, and Kinsale had achieved his aim of strengthening Spain&#x27;s hand. True, Queen Elizabeth had inconsiderately refused to die while del Águila clung on his bridgehead: that was too bad. But still, for the price of a thousand Spanish deaths in Ireland, his Irish expedition had cost the Queen 6,000 to 10,000 of her best soldiers, diverted her from the Low Countries, and almost bankrupted her. It had worked out okay. Now it was time to move on. Soon, the Council of State would recommend a new policy towards the Irish: &#x27;These people should be undeceived, so that they may be able to make the best terms [with the English] they can, bad as the consequences may be.&quot;

Mountjoy sent Rory news of Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s death and stated that &quot;the war was at an end by his death&quot;. Rory convened a council of his advisors. The faction advocating for peace prevailed, though some of Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s supporters still refused to believe he was dead. Rory surrendered to Mountjoy at Athlone in December. Tyrone went into hiding whilst making overtures of peace to Mountjoy. He eventually surrendered by signing the Treaty of Mellifont on 30 March 1603 (Old Style), which ended the Nine Years&#x27; War. McCavitt has stated that &quot;had [O&#x27;Donnell] lived... It could have changed the course of Irish history forever.&quot;

== Legacy ==

=== End of the O&#x27;Donnell clan ===
Following their surrender, Tyrone and Rory were confirmed in their titles and core estates by King James I. Rory was created hereditary Earl of Tyrconnell and granted most of Tyrconnell&#x27;s lands, which greatly incensed Niall Garve, who had himself controversially inaugurated as clan chief in Kilmacrennan. Hostility towards the Gaelic nobility from English politicians gradually increased over time. In September 1607, Rory and Tyrone, accompanied by their families, household staff, followers and fellow Irish nobles, permanently left Ireland for Catholic Europe in what is known as the Flight of the Earls. The earls&#x27; motivations are unclear. They may have been conspiring against the government, and their flight could have been an attempt to evade arrest. Rory and Cathbarr died of fevers shortly after settling in Rome. Tyrone died of illness in 1616 despite his plans to return to Ireland. Discontented with his treatment by the government, Niall Garve instigated the anti-Crown O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s rebellion. He was ultimately arrested and was sent to the Tower of London for life; he died there in 1626.

Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell was the last undisputed chief of the O&#x27;Donnell clan, and the last to not have an English title. Rory had only one son, Hugh Albert, who died without issue. Today, branches of the O&#x27;Donnell clan which can trace their pedigree to the ruling O&#x27;Donnell clan live in Newport, Larkfield and Castlebar, as well as in Spain and Austria.

=== &quot;Beatha Aodh Ruadh Ó Domhnaill&quot; ===
Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell was highly praised by seventeenth-century Irish chroniclers, such as Philip O&#x27;Sullivan Beare and the Four Masters, as well as in Irish bardic poetry. Notably, the Classical Gaelic biography &quot;Beatha Aodh Ruadh Ó Domhnaill&quot; (&quot;&quot;), by Lughaidh Ó Cléirigh, is a highly important source about O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s life and times. It begins with O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s birth and ends with his death and funeral in Spain. Ó Cléirigh was motivated to write the biography when Spanish interest in Ireland was renewed during the Anglo-Spanish War (1625-1630). Ó Cléirigh places O&#x27;Donnell at the forefront of the confederacy with the hope that another O&#x27;Donnell would retake Ireland.

&quot;Beatha&quot; is essentially a eulogy of Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell, placing him as the central figure of the Nine Years&#x27; War and minimising Tyrone&#x27;s involvement. According to Morgan, &quot;In fashioning this bellicose Irish hero, Ó Cléirigh deliberately marginalised the role of [Tyrone] in the war&quot;. According to Paul Walsh, O&#x27;Donnell &quot;occupies the main place in the story, in such a way as, at times, to disfigure the picture of events. O&#x27;Neill, if not eliminated, is certainly reduced in stature... if one were to read only the Life, [one could say] that O&#x27;Donnell and O&#x27;Neill were of equal importance&quot;. Seventeenth-century annalists and eighteenth-century Catholic authors in Ireland typically admired O&#x27;Donnell over Tyrone.

Ó Cléirigh lionises Hugh Roe; he claims that Hugh McHugh Dubh submitted willingly to Hugh Roe, when it reality it took Hugh Roe beheading followers to obtain a submission. Despite O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s alleged murder of his nephew, Ó Cléirigh claims that, during his expansion into Connacht, O&#x27;Donnell &quot;spared no one over fifteen years of age who could not speak Irish&quot;. Ó Cléirigh also uses anachronisms to portray O&#x27;Donnell as a more classical hero.

It is possible that Lughaidh Ó Cléirigh participated in some of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s expeditions, and he may have kept notes. His description of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s last days and funeral is based on the recollections of the two friars named Maurice Ultach. Sections of the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; which pertained to O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s life were adapted from &quot;Beatha&quot;.

=== Gaelic Revival ===
As stated by Philip O&#x27;Sullivan Beare, the loss of their former protectors among the Gaelic nobility of Ireland drove the Catholic Church in Ireland deeper underground in the face of an escalating religious persecution that ended only with Catholic Emancipation in 1829. Historian and folklorist Tony Nugent accordingly lists twelve Mass rocks located throughout County Donegal that were used for illegal religious worship over the following centuries in defiance of the law, the Redcoats and the priest hunters. One is located beside the holy well near the Rock of Doon near both Termon and Kilmacrenan. The grave of Friar Rory O&#x27;Hegarty, who was captured and summarily executed by priest hunters while offering Mass near Buncrana in 1711 and buried where he fell, remains a local site of Christian pilgrimage. Ballyshannon Castle, Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s key residence, was demolished in 1720, though Donegal Castle was restored in the 1990s.

Following the Irish War of Independence, the ascendant Fianna Fail political party began a policy of granted courtesy recognition as Chief of the Name to the senior male descendants of the Gaelic nobility of Ireland. With regard to the O&#x27;Donnell dynasty, the succession came down to a contest between the O&#x27;Donnell family of Newport House and the Duke of Tetuan of the Spanish nobility. The Irish State ultimately ruled in favor of Fr. Hugh O&#x27;Donnell, OFM, a Roman Catholic missionary in Zimbabwe who could document his descent from Manus O&#x27;Donnell, the second son of Niall Garve and Nuala O&#x27;Donnell, who was killed in action while fighting for the Confederation of Kilkenny under the command of Eoghan Ruadh Ó Néill at the Battle of Benburb in 1646.

In September 2002, Eunan O&#x27;Donnell, BL, gave the Simancas Castle Address in honour of Red Hugh, during an O&#x27;Donnell Clan Gathering in Spain. In that same year, a monument upon the battlefield at Kinsale was unveiled by Nuala O&#x27;Donnell, the sister of Fr. Hugh O&#x27;Donnell, OFM. Following the death of Fr. Hugh O&#x27;Donnell, OFM on 11 July 2023, the White Wand of the Chiefdom and his seat in the Standing Council of Irish Chiefs and Chieftains were both inherited by his Tanist and distant relative, don Hugo O&#x27;Donnell, 7th Duke of Tetuan (b.1948).

The O&#x27;Donnell clan was revived in 1954. During an interview with Peter Berresford Ellis, don Leopoldo O&#x27;Donnell y Lara, 6th Duke of Tetuán (1915-2002), don Hugo&#x27;s father and the Irish State&#x27;s then recognized Tanist of Tyrconnell, commented, &quot;Being in my mid-eighties, perhaps I will not inherit the title of my forebears, nor even my son in his lifetimes. But one of my grandsons doubtless will. Our family, forced to flee from our native land to maintain our own existence, has never really abandoned Ireland, our patrimony nor our people of Tirconnell. We would sincerely wish to maintain their interest in the ancient Gaelic culture and civilization that once made Ireland the cradle of civilization during the grim, bleak days of the European Dark Ages.&quot;

According to James Henthorn Todd, &quot;It was unfortunately the custom of Irish scribes to take considerable liberties with the works they transcribed. They did not hesitate to insert poems or other additional matter, with a view to gratify their patrons or chieftains, and to flatter the vanity of their clan. It is to be feared, that for the same reason, they frequently omitted what might be disagreeable to their patrons, or scandalous to the Church; thus they were guilty of anachronisms and various mistakes, which have the effect of throwing discredit upon the works so transmitted to us, as disproving apparently their claim to antiquity.&quot;

Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s short life, which involved his escape from prison and his early overseas death, has &quot;enabled much mythologising of his life and character&quot;. During the nineteenth century Gaelic revival, O&#x27;Donnell was embraced as a Celtic national hero, to the exclusion of Tyrone, who was seen as too English to stand for Irish nationalism.

According to Angus Mitchell, O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s &quot;personal struggle served as an allegory to explain Ireland&#x27;s incarceration and escape from imprisoning and oppressive rule&quot;.

=== Modern reappraisal ===
Twentieth-century historians, such as John Mitchell and Hiram Morgan, restored Tyrone to the status he was formerly afforded by contemporary English commentators. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s reputation has been overshadowed in recent Irish nationalism by that of Tyrone. Tyrone now overshadows O&#x27;Donnell in most modern depictions of the Nine Years&#x27; War.

The Aodh Ruadh Ó Domhnaill Guild was formed in 1977 to seek O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s cause for canonization as a saint of the Catholic Church.

In the early 1980s, O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s will was discovered by a Donegal priest.

In 1991, a plaque was erected at Simancas Castle in commemoration of Red Hugh O&#x27;Donnell. A large cross in honour of Art MacShane O&#x27;Neill stands near the site of his death and secret burial in the Wicklow Mountains. Red Hugh and Art&#x27;s 55 km. escape route from Dublin Castle to Glenmalure is also retraced by long-distance runners (and walkers) every January in the &quot;Art O&#x27;Neill Challenge&quot;.

A sculpture by Maurice Harron, titled &quot;The Gaelic Chieftain&quot;, was unveiled in 1999 near Boyle, County Roscommon. Overlooking the N4, the sculpture depicts O&#x27;Donnell on horseback and commemorates his victory at the battle of Curlew Pass.

O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s birthday has been celebrated in County Donegal. As of 2023, plans are afoot to erect statues of him in both Lifford and Simancas.

=== Search for remains ===
The Chapel of Wonders was sold and destroyed in 1836 during a wave of monastic expropriations, and its exact location was lost. In 2019, Donegal man and retired soldier Brendan Rohan visited Valladolid and persuaded city authorities to conduct a dig for O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s grave. The following year, a week-long excavation of Valladolid&#x27;s Constitution Street revealed the walls of what was believed to be the Chapel of Wonders underneath a four-storey building. On 22 May 2020, archaeologists began a dig inside the chapel&#x27;s remains.

A number of modern descendants of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s kin were &quot;lined up for DNA tests&quot; to confirm O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s identity if his remains were found. There was call for repatriation of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s remains if discovered, though O&#x27;Donnell himself asked to be buried in the Convent of St. Francis in his will. It was hoped his skeleton would be easy to identify due to his two missing big toes. However many of the skeletons discovered were in a state of decay and did not have any existing feet. Eventually twenty skeletons were discovered during the dig, though DNA testing showed they were from an earlier period. The site has been used for burials for hundreds of years, making O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s discovery near-impossible.

In March 2021, archaeologists believed the Chapel of Wonders extended further beneath the dig site, and went into negotiations to resume the excavation. The search ended in October 2021. By September 2022, historian John McCavitt had come across an inscription on an early 17th-century tombstone about O&#x27;Donnell. According to McCavitt, if O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s burial place still exists, it would have been marked by such a gravestone.

As of 2024, O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s grave has not been discovered, though the media attention garnered by the dig has promoted Hispano-Irish relations. The dig was spearheaded by the local Hispanic-Irish Association. As of October 2023, the investigation is not closed.

=== Re-enactment of funeral ===
Valladolid has reenacted O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s funeral procession in 2022, 2023 and 2024, on the instigation of chairman of the Hispano-Irish Society, Carlos Burgos. The reenactors wear period costumes and carry an empty casket draped with an Irish tricolour. It is based on historical records of the real funeral.

== Character ==

=== Personality ===
Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell was a highly charismatic individual. Contemporary sources state that O&#x27;Donnell had &quot;great powers of command, and a look of amiability on his countenance that captivated everyone who beheld him&quot;.

In his youth, a bardic poet claimed that O&#x27;Donnell was arrogant and in need of maturity. Hugh Roe&#x27;s four-year imprisonment radicalised him into having a profound anti-English stance, which he carried through the rest of his life. This contributes towards his aggressive military strategy. Hugh Roe became distrustful of English people, making him wary during peace talks. Particularly because Hugh Roe had not committed any offence, he saw his imprisonment as unjust and villainising. English sources note his antagonism during the war; he was described as the &quot;firebrand of all the rebels&quot;.

O&#x27;Donnell had an aggressive, prideful and arrogant personality, lacking patience and caution. As Edward Alfred D&#x27;Alton put it, &quot;the ordinary Irish chief... boasted much, and talked much, and did little, and... heedlessly rushed into war without estimating his difficulties or his resources&quot;. Historical records show O&#x27;Donnell to be &quot;a wily negotiator, an effective and pragmatic power broker, and a brave soldier&quot;.

=== Military strategy, Relationship with Tyrone ===
O&#x27;Donnell and Tyrone had contrasting temperaments, which often caused disputes over their military tactics. In contrast to Tyrone, who was known for elaborately bluffing his way out of trouble, O&#x27;Donnell preferred force over diplomacy and was uncompromising. This attitude led to military successes as well as failures. Morgan describes O&#x27;Donnell as a &quot;gung-ho leader&quot; whose military successes were &quot;limited&quot;.

The age difference between the two men may have been a source of conflict; Tyrone was O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s senior by 22 years. Unlike Tyrone, who was raised in the Pale, O&#x27;Donnell had a traditional Gaelic upbringing. O&#x27;Donnell probably learned patience from his father-in-law.

O&#x27;Donnell saw his partnership with Tyrone as one of two equals. On his deathbed, O&#x27;Donnell wrote that &quot;the stipulation was that one had no pre-eminence over the other and that in walking or travelling together whichever was the elder should be on the right hand&quot;. The arrangement was confirmed by a treaty signed by both men.

Historian Hiram Morgan believes that O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s choice to remain in a barren marriage with Tyrone&#x27;s daughter is symbolic of his dependence on Tyrone. Many of Tyrone&#x27;s contemporaries who knew Tyrone, such as John Perrot, considered O&#x27;Donnell to be the junior partner in the confederacy. An alliance with Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell was clearly of vital importance to Tyrone.

Tyrone restrained O&#x27;Donnell from openly attacking English forces in the early stages of the war. During the Battle of Beleek, which was secretly planned to result in an Irish failure to divert English attention, Tyrone ordered O&#x27;Donnell not to send reinforcements. O&#x27;Donnell withdrew his most of his forces, suggesting that Tyrone had a level of control over the young noble. Nevertheless, O&#x27;Donnell sent 220 men under Niall Garve to the battle, possibly in the hopes that the insolent Niall Garve would be easily eliminated.

During their negotiations with the government, O&#x27;Donnell played the &quot;bad cop&quot; to Tyrone&#x27;s &quot;good cop&quot;. They used the absence of one of them to delay and stall further negotiations. During the 1596 peace talks, O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s insolence was remarked on by English officials. O&#x27;Donnell criticised Tyrone&#x27;s diplomatic strategy in a letter in December 1597, and declared he would break the cessation, though he never did.

Following the meeting with Alonso Cobos, Spanish emmisaries noted that Tyrone and O&#x27;Donnell &quot;acted like one man and were respected by the rest&quot;.

In 1598, Tyrone was struggling to seize the Blackwater fort using siege warfare. O&#x27;Donnell pushed Tyrone to launch a full frontal assault. The assault was a disaster with over one hundred Irish men lost.

Tyrone continued to restrain O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s aggressive strategy. He forbid O&#x27;Donnell from travelling to Connacht during the 1599 cessation. Tyrone also prevented O&#x27;Donnell from burning the Pale, so as not to provoke an English counter-attack.

Tyrone&#x27;s strategy typically won out, though not always. The Irish failure at the battle of Kinsale has been attributed to O&#x27;Donnell naively urging Tyrone to attack, rather than starving out the English as was the previously agreed-upon strategy. This account by contemporary writers Ó Cléirigh and O&#x27;Sullivan Beare is not unanimously believed by historians. John McGurk, J. J. Silke, Cyril Falls and McGettigan concur; Morgan and Gerard Anthony Hayes-McCoy disagree. O&#x27;Donnell had previously induced Tyrone into a full frontal assault during a campaign in 1598, so this narrative is not out of the question. Morgan claims it was the pressure from the beleaguered Spaniards that wore down Tyrone, and that the Earl also had his reputation on the line. Don Juan del Águila was also in favour of an immediate attack.

In historian Darren McGettigan&#x27;s biography, he praises O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s leadership abilities. However, John McCavitt notes that O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s failure to forsee Niall Garve&#x27;s betrayal displays clear flaws in O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s foresight. Evidence suggests that O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s military capability was quite limited, although his notes on the Battle of Moyry Pass show that he could develop complex battle plans. O&#x27;Donnell stated it was better to attack Mountjoy&#x27;s forces when they were deep in Irish territory, away from reinforcements, and in poor weather.

McGettigan states that the two men&#x27;s differing military strategies complemented each other. Morgan considers O&#x27;Donnell to be &quot;too Catholic and too violent for today&#x27;s Ireland&quot;, and also states that O&#x27;Donnell was &quot;a counter-reformation Irish dynast living in the world of Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;Prince&quot; rather than the cattle-raid of Cooley&quot;.

=== Physical appearance ===
There are no surviving portraits or visual representations of Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell made in his lifetime. Franciscan Donagh O&#x27;Mooney, who knew O&#x27;Donnell personally, described him as of &quot;middle height, ruddy, of comely face, and beautiful to behold... his voice was like the music of a silver trumpet&quot;. He probably had red hair, as adjectives such as &quot;ruadh&quot; (Irish for &quot;red&quot;) were commonly employed in Irish names to refer to hair colour. This epithet would have differentiated him from kinsmen also named &quot;Hugh O&#x27;Donnell&quot;. After losing his big toes to frostbite, Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell would have hobbled around or travelled on horseback for the rest of his life. If discovered intact, O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s skeleton would reveal his stature and height, and technology might allow researchers to recreate his facial features. His remains may also provide insight into his health, nutrition and diet.

Although O&#x27;Donnell was fiercely patriotic, he had no aversion to foreign dress. He was described in 1601 as wearing English clothing and even going to mass in a &quot;fine English gown&quot;. Historian Francis Martin O&#x27;Donnell suggests that Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell dressed in Spanish clothing, as his grandfather Manus was known for preferring continental fashion over traditional Gaelic clothing.

==Family tree==
==In popular culture==
=== Poetry ===
* In his 1861 poem &quot;Eirinn a&#x27; Gul&quot; (&quot;Ireland Weeping&quot;), Scottish Gaelic poet William Livingston recalls the many stories about his fellow Gaels in Inis Fáil (Ireland) he had heard in the Ceilidh houses of Islay, before that island was emptied by the Highland Clearances. He then lamented the destruction wreaked upon the Irish people by both famine and similar mass evictions ordered by Anglo-Irish landlords. He particularly laments the loss of the chiefs of the Irish clans, who led their clansmen in war and provided &quot;leadership of the old and true Gaelic kind&quot;. Mac Dhun Lèibhe comments sadly that the mid-19th century fighters for Irish republicanism had none of the heroic qualities shown by Red Hugh O&#x27;Donnell, Hugh O&#x27;Neill, and Hugh Maguire during the Nine Years War against Queen Elizabeth I. Sadly, but expressing hope for the future of the Irish people, Mac Dhun Lèibhe closes by asking where are the Irish clan warriors who charged out of the mist and slaughtered the armies of the Stranger at the Battle of the Yellow Ford and the Battle of Moyry Pass.
* James Clarence Mangan&#x27;s poem &quot;Ceann Salla&quot; dramatises O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s last words on his deathbed.

=== Music ===
* &quot;Róisín Dubh&quot;, which is one of Ireland&#x27;s most popular political songs, is addressed in O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s voice to his wife Rose. The song is reputed to have originated in the rebel encampments during the Nine Years War, and has also been attributed to a Tyrconnellian poet under O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s reign. Conversely, music scholar Donal O&#x27;Sullivan claims there is no evidence it was composed that early. The most popular version of &quot;Róisín Dubh&quot; was adapted by James Clarence Mangan from a fragmentation of an existing romantic poem to Rose. Although it is superficially a love song, it has been described as a patriotic song that covertly hides its nationalism via allegory.
* In 1843, Michael Joseph MacCann wrote the song &quot;O&#x27;Donnell Abu&quot; in tribute, drawing on the tradition of romantic nationalism which was popular during the era.
* Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell is the subject of the Irish ballad &quot;If These Stones Could Speak&quot;, as featured on the Phil Coulter album &quot;Highland Cathedral&quot;.
* For Seville Expo &#x27;92, composer Bill Whelan composed &quot;The Seville Suite&quot; to commemorate the 390th anniversary of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s arrival in Galicia. The suite was commissioned by the Taoiseach&#x27;s office and was performed by a 50-piece orchestra at the Teatro de la Maestranza on 4 October 1992.

=== Novels ===
Novels based on O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s life include:
* &quot;O&#x27;Donel of Destiny&quot; (1939) by Mary Kiely
* &quot;Red Hugh, Prince of Donegal&quot; (1957) by Robert T Reilly
* &quot;Red Hugh: The Kidnap of Hugh O&#x27;Donnell&quot; (1999) by Deborah Lisson

=== Film ===
* Hugh O&#x27;Donnell was portrayed by English actor Peter McEnery in the 1966 Disney adventure film &quot;The Fighting Prince of Donegal&quot;, which was based on Robert T Reilly&#x27;s 1957 book &quot;Red Hugh, Prince of Donegal&quot;.

=== Theatre ===
* On 15 August 1902 in Kilkenny, Captain Otway Cuffe staged a single performance of a masque (titled &quot;Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell&quot;) recounting O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s kidnapping, escape and inauguration. The masque was authored by Standish James O&#x27;Grady, produced by Francis Joseph Bigger, and performed by the Neophytes, a north Belfast theatre troupe. It was well-received and formed part of the Gaelic revival movement.
* O&#x27;Donnell is a major character in Brian Friel&#x27;s 1989 play &quot;Making History&quot;, which focuses on Tyrone reckoning with his own legacy. According to historian Jane Ohlmeyer, &quot;Friel portrayed the youthful Red Hugh as fiery, headstrong, quick-witted, passionate, committed to Catholicism, and to the preservation of the values, language, and culture of the Gaelic world into which he had been born and reared.&quot; In its original production, O&#x27;Donnell was played by Peter Gowen.

=== Other ===
* Several Gaelic sports clubs in County Donegal are named after Red Hugh O&#x27;Donnell, such as Aodh Ruadh CLG in Ballyshannon and Red Hughs GAA Club in Killygordon.

<doc id="1324429" wikidata="Q2571592" url="?curid=1324429" title="Danish grammar">
<text>Danish grammar is either the study of the grammar of the Danish language, or the grammatical system itself of the Danish language. Danish is often described as having ten word classes: verbs, nouns, pronouns, numerals, adjectives, adverbs, articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections. The grammar is mostly suffixing. This article focuses on Standard Danish.

==Nouns==
===Inflections===
There are two grammatical genders in Danish: &quot;common&quot; and &quot;neuter&quot;. All nouns are mostly arbitrarily divided into these two classes. The singular indefinite article (a/an in English) is &quot;en&quot; for common-gender nouns and &quot;et&quot; for neuter nouns. They are often informally called n-words and t-words.

&quot;En dreng&quot;. A boy.

&quot;Et fængsel&quot;. A jail.

Unlike English, definite nouns in Danish are rendered by adding a suffix (i.e. not an article) to the indefinite form (unless qualified by an adjective; see below). The definite singular ending is &quot;-en&quot; for common-gender nouns and &quot;-et&quot; for neuter nouns.

&quot;Drengen&quot;. The boy.

&quot;Fængslet&quot;. The jail.

The plural noun suffixes are more complex. The following table shows the possible inflections of regular Danish nouns of both grammatical genders.

The most common plural ending is -er. Besides an extremely large number of other nouns, nearly all those that end with unstressed &quot;-e&quot; take it, as does the vast majority of those that end with a monophthong other than &quot;-e&quot;.

The zero plural ending is predominantly used with neuter nouns.

The plural ending -e is used with:
*a large number of monosyllabic nouns that end with a consonant or diphthong (and any compound ending with one of those monosyllabic nouns)
*almost all nouns that end with unstressed &quot;-er&quot;
*eight common-gender nouns that end with unstressed &quot;-el&quot;: &quot;apostel, discipel, djævel, engel, himmel, stimmel, vrimmel, variabel&quot;
*some of the nouns denoting persons that end with &quot;-ing&quot; (all of which are common gender) 
*some other common-gender plurisyllabic nouns

In the singular definite, common-gender nouns always take the ending &quot;-en&quot;, while neuter nouns always take &quot;-et&quot;. Plural definite adds &quot;-ene&quot; to the indefinite if it has no suffix or a borrowed suffix, otherwise &quot;-ne&quot; (exception: &quot;mennesker&quot; &quot;human beings, people&quot; → &quot;menneske&quot;(&quot;r&quot;)&quot;ne&quot;).

Nouns that end in unstressed &quot;-e&quot; lose the &quot;-e&quot; when adding an ending: &quot;kvinde, kvind-en, kvind-er, kvind-erne&quot; &quot;woman&quot;. Nouns that end in unstressed &quot;-er&quot;, &quot;-el&quot;, or &quot;-en&quot; lose or keep the &quot;e&quot; according to the rules below. When the loss of the &quot;e&quot; leads to a double consonant coming immediately before the stem-final &quot;r&quot;, &quot;l,&quot; or &quot;n&quot;, it is simplified (e.g. &quot;fætter, fæt_r-e&quot; &quot;male first cousin&quot;; &quot;seddel, sed_l-en, sed_l-er&quot; &quot;(bank)note&quot;). 

*All nouns ending in unstressed &quot;-er&quot; can keep the &quot;e&quot; before the definite singular ending: &quot;fætter-en, kammer-et, orkest(e)r-et&quot;. The common-gender nouns in this group must keep it, with the sole exception of &quot;baluster&quot;, which can also be neuter: &quot;balust(e)ren/balust(e)ret&quot;.
*Of the nouns ending in unstressed &quot;-er&quot; that take the indefinite plural ending &quot;-e&quot;, those that keep the &quot;e&quot; of the stem before the indefinite plural ending (e.g. &quot;banner-e&quot;) lose the plural ending &quot;-e&quot; before the definite plural ending &quot;-ne&quot; (e.g. &quot;banner-_-ne&quot;) – but see &quot;kælder&quot; below. (Those that lose the &quot;e&quot; of the stem before the indefinite plural ending (e.g. &quot;ced_r-e&quot;) follow the main rule and keep the plural ending &quot;-e&quot; before the definite plural ending &quot;-ne&quot; (e.g. &quot;ced_r-e-ne&quot;).)
*Of the common-gender nouns ending in unstressed &quot;-er&quot;, the vast majority take the plural ending &quot;-e&quot; and keep the &quot;e&quot; of the stem in all forms: &quot;arbejder, arbejder-en, arbejder-e, arbejder-_-ne&quot;. Of the minority, those that take the plural ending &quot;-e&quot; keep the &quot;e&quot; of the stem in the definite singular form (with the sole exception mentioned above) and lose it in the plural forms: &quot;mester, mester-en, mest_r-e, mest_r-e-ne&quot;. Some inflect either like &quot;arbejder&quot; or like &quot;mester&quot;: &quot;salamander, salamander-en, salamand(e)r-e, salamander-_-ne/salamand_r-e-ne&quot;. &quot;Kælder&quot; inflects like &quot;arbejder&quot; or like &quot;mester&quot; in the indefinite plural, but only like &quot;mester&quot; in the definite plural: &quot;kælder, kælder-en, kæld(e)r-e, kæld_r-e-ne&quot;.
*With seven exceptions, all nouns ending in unstressed &quot;-el&quot; can lose the &quot;e&quot; before all endings: &quot;cykel, cyk_l-en, cyk_l-er, cyk_l-er-ne; engel, eng_l-en, eng_l-e, eng_l-e-ne; bibel, bib(e)l-en, bib_l-er, bib_l-er-ne; himmel, him(me)len, him_l-e, him_l-e-ne.&quot; With the seven exceptions already mentioned plus another seven, all nouns in this group must lose the &quot;e&quot; before the plural endings. The word &quot;pixel&quot; can&#x27;t lose the &quot;e&quot; before the plural ending &quot;-s&quot;, but must lose it before the plural ending &quot;-er&quot;: &quot;pix(e)l-en, pixel-s/pix_l-er, pix_l-er(-)ne.&quot;
*All nouns ending in unstressed &quot;-en&quot; can keep the &quot;e&quot; before all endings.

It is common for nouns to change during inflection in ways that aren&#x27;t reflected in spelling. They can lose stød (e.g. &quot;hus&quot; , &quot;huset&quot; , &quot;huse&quot; ), add stød, or lengthen the root vowel (the last two possibilities are exemplified by &quot;bad&quot; , &quot;badet&quot; ).

There are many nouns with irregular plurals. Here are some examples:

Most either have vowel change with or without a suffix, or are foreign words using their native plurals.

If a noun is preceded by a number composed of more than one distinct part, the last part determines the grammatical number. &quot;1001 Nat&quot; (literally &quot;1001 Night&quot;) and &quot;to en halv time&quot; (literally &quot;two and a half hour&quot;) use singular nouns, whereas English would use &quot;nights&quot; and &quot;hours&quot;.

===Possessive===
There are no case declensions in Danish nouns (unlike the pronouns). Nouns are inflected only for possession which is expressed with a possessive enclitic, for example &quot;min fars hus&quot;, &quot;my father&#x27;s house&quot;, where the noun &quot;far&quot; carries the possessive enclitic. As in English, but unlike in case-inflected languages such as German, this enclitic -s is not a marker of a genitive case; a case inflection only modifies a single noun (and any adjectives in agreement with it), but in longer noun phrases the possessive enclitic attaches to the last word in the phrase, which need not be the head-noun or even a noun at all. For example, the phrases &quot;kongen af Danmark&#x27;s bolsjefabrik&quot;, &quot;the king of Denmark&#x27;s candy factory&quot;, or &quot;det er pigen Uffe bor sammen meds datter&quot; &quot;that is the girl Uffe lives with&#x27;s daughter&quot;, where the enclitic attaches to a stranded preposition.

When the noun can be considered part of the possessor noun physically (a part-whole relation), the possessive is often replaced by a prepositional phrase, e.g. &quot;låget på spanden&quot; &quot;the lid on the bucket&quot;, &quot;bagsiden af huset&quot; &quot;the back of the house&quot; rather than &quot;spandens låg&quot;, &quot;husets bagside&quot;, which are not incorrect but more formal, and less informative.

Older case forms exist as like &quot;i live&quot; &quot;alive&quot; (&quot;liv&quot; = &quot;life&quot;), &quot;på tide&quot; &quot;about time&quot; (&quot;tid&quot; = &quot;time&quot;), &quot;på fode&quot; &quot;on his foot&quot; (&quot;fod&quot; = &quot;foot&quot;). Similarly, the genitive is used in certain fossilised prepositional phrases (with &quot;til&quot; &quot;to&quot;): &quot;til fods&quot; &quot;on foot&quot;, &quot;til vands/søs&quot; &quot;by water/sea&quot;, &quot;gå til hånde&quot; &quot;assist&quot; (&quot;hånde&quot; being an old genitive plural of &quot;hånd&quot; &quot;hand&quot;, now replaced by &quot;hænder&quot;). (Compare &quot;thereof&quot; in English, the possessive case of &quot;there&quot;, which survives only in fossilised semi-archaic or legal phrases like &quot;or part thereof&quot;).

===Articles===
Danish has indefinite and definite articles () functioning as determiners. The indefinite article is placed before a noun and takes the forms (common gender) and (neuter) depending on the noun. These forms are identical (in writing) to the numeral meaning &quot;one&quot;. Definiteness is only marked with an article placed before the noun when the noun has other preceding modifiers (e.g. adjectives), and the definite article then has the forms (common), (neuter) and (plural). When lacking preceding modifiers, nouns are marked as definite with the definite suffixes (common), (neuter), (plural).

==Pronouns==
The personal pronouns in Danish has three cases: nominative, oblique (accusative and dative), and possessive (or genitive). The nominative form is used when the pronoun is used as an unmodified subject, while the oblique form is used anywhere else: as direct and indirect object of verbs, prepositional complement, subject predicate, part of coordinated subject, or with following modifiers (such as &#x27;there&#x27; and prepositional phrases).
1) Since the 1970s, the polite form &quot;De&quot; (cf. German &quot;Sie&quot;) is no longer the normal form of addressing adult strangers. It is only used in formal letters or when addressing the royal family. It is sometimes used by shop assistants and waiters to flatter their customers. As a general rule, one can use &quot;du&quot; almost in every situation without offending anyone.

2) The reflexive pronoun is used when the object or possessive is identical to the grammatical subject of the sentence: &quot;Han kyssede sin kone&quot; &quot;He kissed his (own) wife&quot; ~ &quot;Han kyssede hans kone&quot; &quot;he kissed his (somebody else&#x27;s) wife&quot;. It is also used when referring to the subject of an infinite nexus, e.g. an accusative with infinitive: &quot;Rødhætte bad jægeren hilse sin kone&quot; &quot;Little Red Riding Hood asked the hunter to greet his wife&quot;, where &quot;sin&quot; refers to the hunter. This difference is often not observed by Jutlandic speakers.

3) &quot;Vores&quot; is the only form normally used in current spoken language; &quot;vor&quot;, &quot;vort&quot; and &quot;vore&quot; are more archaic, and perceived as formal or solemn.

Danish also has the generic pronoun &#x27;one, you&#x27;; is often used as its oblique form. The second person singular pronoun &#x27;you&#x27; can also be used with generic reference.

==Verbs==
In contemporary Danish, the verb has up to nine distinct forms, as shown in the chart below.

===Person and number===
Verbs do not vary according to person or number: &quot;jeg venter, du venter, han, hun, den, det venter, vi venter, I venter, de venter&quot;. However, until the beginning of the twentieth century, it was normal to inflect the present tense in number in educated prose. There existed also a special plural form in the imperative. These forms are not used anymore, but can be found in older prose:

For example, &quot;Søger, saa skulle I finde&quot; &quot;Seek, and ye shall find&quot; (Matthew 7:7); in the 1992 translation &quot;Søg, så skal I finde&quot;.

===Tenses===
Like in other Germanic languages, the conjugation of verb tenses is divided into two groups: The first group, the so-called weak verbs, indicates the past tense by adding the suffixes &quot;-ede&quot; or &quot;-te&quot;. The second, called strong verbs, forms the past tense with a zero ending and, in most cases, certain vowel changes.

The future tense is formed with the modal verbs &quot;vil&quot; or &quot;skal&quot; and the infinitive, e.g. &quot;tror du, det vil regne&quot;, &quot;do you think it&#x27;s going to rain&quot;, &quot;vi skal nok komme igen i morgen&quot;, &quot;we&#x27;ll come again tomorrow&quot;. Often the present tense is also used as future, only with the addition of a time specification &quot;i morgen køber han en bil&quot;, &quot;tomorrow he&#x27;ll buy a car&quot;.

In the perfect, the word &quot;har&quot; (&quot;have, has&quot;) is placed before the past participle: &quot;han har købt en bil&quot;, &quot;he has bought a car&quot;. In certain words implying a movement, however, &quot;er&quot; (&quot;am, are, is&quot;) is used instead: &quot; han er gået sin vej&quot;, &quot;he has gone&quot; (like German &quot;er ist gegangen&quot; or French &quot;il est allé&quot;). In such cases &quot;har&quot; is used for the activity, while &quot;er&quot; is used if the result is what is interesting. &quot;Han har rejst meget&quot;, &quot;he has traveled a lot&quot;. &quot;Han er rejst&quot;, &quot;he is gone&quot;, he is not here anymore.

Similarly, the pluperfect is formed with &quot;havde&quot; or &quot;var&quot;: &quot;han havde købt en bil&quot;, &quot;han var gået sin vej&quot;. NB?. The perfect is used in many cases where English would have a simple preterite.

===Moods===
In Danish, there are two finite moods, indicative and imperative. Depending on interpretation, there may also be an optative.

# The indicative mood is used everywhere, unless the imperative or optative is required.
# The imperative is used in commands: &quot;Kør langsomt!&quot; (Drive slowly!), &quot;Kom her!&quot; (Come here!). (The imperative is the stem of the verb.)
# The optative is rare and used only in archaic or poetic constructions. It&#x27;s probably more correct to describe these as elliptical constructions leaving out a modal and just retaining an infinitive, e.g. &quot;Gud være lovet!&quot; (God be praised!), &quot;Kongen længe leve!&quot; (Long live the king!) – completely analogous to the English use.

In short, Danish morphology offers very little in moods. Just like English, Danish depends on tense and modals to express moods.

Example: Where a language with an explicit subjunctive mood (such as German, Spanish, or Icelandic) would use that mood in hypothetical statements, Danish uses a strategy similar to that of English. Compare:

a. Real, or at least possibly real, situation in present time: &quot;Hvis Peter køber kage, laver Anne kaffe.&quot; &quot;If Peter buys [some] cake, Anne makes coffee.&quot; Here, the present indicative is used.

b. Real, or at least possibly real, situation in past time: &quot;Hvis Peter købte kage, lavede Anne kaffe.&quot; &quot;If Peter bought [some] cake, Anne made coffee.&quot; Here, the past indicative is used.

c. Unreal situation in present time: &quot;Hvis Peter købte kage, lavede Anne kaffe.&quot; &quot;If Peter bought [some] cake, Anne made coffee.&quot; (Implying: But Peter doesn&#x27;t actually buy any cake, so Anne doesn&#x27;t make coffee—making the whole statement hypothetical.) Here, the past indicative is used.

d1. Unreal situation in past time: &quot;Hvis Peter havde købt kage, havde Anne lavet kaffe.&quot; &quot;If Peter had bought [some] cake, Anne had made coffee.&quot; (Implying that Peter didn&#x27;t actually buy any cake and so Anne didn&#x27;t make coffee—making the whole statement hypothetical.) Here, the pluperfect indicative is used.

A language with a full subjunctive mood, the way it typically works in Indo-European languages, would translate cases a. and b. with indicative forms of the verb, and case c. and d. with subjunctive forms. In the hypothetical cases (c. and d.), Danish and English create distance from reality by &quot;moving the tense one step back&quot;. Although these sentences do work, however, it would be normal in Danish as well as in English, to further stress the irreality by adding a modal. So that, instead of either example c. or d1, Danish and English would add &quot;ville/would&quot; in the main sentence, creating what may be considered a periphrastic subjunctive:

d2. Unreal situation in past time: &quot;Hvis Peter havde købt kage, ville Anne have lavet kaffe.&quot; &quot;If Peter had bought [some] cake, Anne would have made coffee.&quot;

(As will be seen from the examples, Danish, unlike English, switches from the normal subject-auxiliary(or, by default verb) word order to auxiliary(or, by default, verb)-subject when a main clause follows a subordinate clause, but that&#x27;s always the case and has nothing to do with the mood of the sentence. See V2 word order.)

===Voice===
Like the other Scandinavian languages, Danish has a special inflection for the passive voice with the suffix &quot;-s&quot;, which is historically a reduced enclitic form of the reflexive pronoun &quot;sig&quot; (&quot;himself, herself, itself, themselves&quot;), e.g. &quot;han kalder sig&quot; &quot;he calls himself&quot; &gt; &quot;han kaldes&quot; &quot;he is called&quot;.

Danish has a competing periphrastic form of the passive formed with the verb &quot;blive&quot; (&quot;to remain, to become&quot;).

In addition to the proper passive constructions, the passive also denotes:
# a reciprocal form (only with the &quot;s&quot;-passive): &quot;Hans og Jørgen mødtes på gaden&quot; &quot;John and George met on the street&quot;, &quot;vi ses på onsdag&quot; &quot;we&#x27;ll see each other on Wednesday&quot;, &quot;I må ikke slås&quot; &quot;you must not fight&quot; (literally &quot;beat each other&quot;).
# an intransitive form (a lexicalised &quot;s&quot;-passive): &quot;der findes / fandtes mange grunde til at komme&quot; &quot;there are / were many reasons why one should come&quot; (literally: &quot;are / were found&quot;).
# an impersonal form: &quot;der kæmpes / bliver kæmpet om pladserne&quot; &quot;there is a struggle for the seats&quot;.

In the preterite, the periphrastic form is preferred in non-formal speech except in reciprocal and impersonal passives: &quot;de sås ofte&quot; &quot;they often saw each other&quot;, &quot;der fandtes en lov imod det&quot; &quot;there was a law against it&quot; (but real passive: &quot;de blev set af politiet&quot; &quot;they were seen by the police&quot;, &quot;der blev fundet en bombe&quot; &quot;a bomb was found&quot;).

The s-form of the verb can also imply habitual or repetitive action, e.g. &quot;bilen vaskes&quot; &quot;the car is washed&quot; (regularly) vs. &quot;bilen bliver vasket&quot; &quot;the car is (being) washed&quot; (right now, soon, next week, etc.)

The &quot;s&quot;-passive of the perfect participle is regular in Swedish both in the real passive and in other functions, e.g. &quot;vårt företag har funnits sedan 1955&quot; &quot;our company has existed since 1955&quot;, &quot;bilen har setts ute på Stockholms gator&quot; &quot;the car has been seen in the streets of S.&quot; In Danish, the real passive has only periphrastic forms in the perfect: &quot;bilen er blevet set ude på Stockholms gader&quot;. In the lexicalised and reciprocal passives, on the other hand, we find a combination of the verb &quot;have&quot; and the &quot;s&quot;-passive preterite: e.g. &quot;mødtes&quot; &quot;have met&quot;, &quot;har fandtes&quot; &quot;have existed&quot; etc. (but strangely enough, the irregular &quot;har set(e)s&quot; &quot;have seen each other&quot; is much more common than &quot;har sås&quot;, which is considered substandard).

===Present participles===
The present participle is used to a much lesser extent than in English. Where English often uses non-finite clauses, Danish instead uses subordinate or coordinate clauses with a finite verb, e.g. &quot;eftersom han var konge, var det ham, der måtte bestemme&quot;, &quot;Being the king, he had the last word&quot;. The present participle is used in two circumstances:

# as an attributive adjective: &quot;en dræbende tavshed&quot;, &quot;a boring (lit. killing) silence&quot;, &quot;en galoperende inflation&quot;, &quot;a runaway inflation&quot;, &quot;hendes rødmende kinder&quot;, &quot;her blushing cheeks&quot;.
# adverbially with verbs of movement: &quot;han gik syngende ned ad gaden&quot;, &quot;he walked down the street singing&quot;

If the present participle carries an object or an adverb, the two words are normally treated as a compound orthographically and prosodically: &quot;et menneskeædende uhyre&quot;, &quot;a man-eating monster&quot;, &quot;en hurtig(t)løbende bold&quot;, &quot;a fast(-going) ball&quot;, &quot;fodbold- og kvindeelskende mænd&quot;, &quot;men loving football and women&quot;.

===Past participles===
The past participle is used primarily in the periphrastic constructions of the passive (with &quot;blive&quot;) and the perfect (with &quot;være&quot;). It is often used in non-finite constructions in so-called &quot;free predicatives&quot;: &quot;Således oplyst(e) kan vi skride til afstemning&quot;, &quot;Now being informed, we can take a vote&quot;, &quot;han tog, opfyldt af had til tyrannen, ivrig del i forberedelserne til revolutionen&quot;, &quot;filled with hatred of the tyrant, he participated eagerly in the preparations for the revolution&quot;.

The past participle of the weak verbs has the ending &quot;-et&quot; or &quot;-t&quot;. The past participle of the strong verbs originally had the ending &quot;-en&quot;, neuter &quot;-et&quot;, but the common form is now restricted to the use as an adjective (e.g. &quot;en bunden opgave&quot;), and it has not been preserved in all verbs. When it is combined with &quot;er&quot; and &quot;har&quot; to form passive and perfect constructions, the neuter form, which happens to be identical to the ending of the weak verbs, is used. In the Jutlandic dialects, &quot;-en&quot; is frequently used in such constructions.

As to the voice of the past participle, it is passive if the verb is transitive, and active if it is intransitive.

===Infinitive and verbal nouns===
The infinitive may be defined as a verb form that is equivalent to a noun syntactically. The Danish infinitive may be used as the subject or object of a verb like in English: &quot;at rejse er at leve&quot; &quot;to travel is to live&quot;, &quot;jeg elsker at spise kartofler&quot; &quot;I love to eat potatoes&quot;. Furthermore, the Danish infinitive may also be governed by a preposition (where English normally has the gerund): &quot;han tog livet af sig ved at springe ud af et vindue&quot; &quot;he killed himself by jumping out of a window&quot;.

The infinitive normally has the marker &quot;at&quot;, pronounced or in normal speech , thereby being homonymous with the conjunction &quot;og&quot; &quot;and&quot;, with which it is sometimes confused in spelling. The bare infinitive is used after the modal verbs &quot;kunne, ville, skulle, måtte, turde, burde&quot;.

A rarer form is the verbal noun with the ending &quot;-en&quot; (not to be confused with the definite article) which is used when the infinitive carries a pronoun, an indefinite article or an adjective: &quot;hans evindelige skrigen var enerverende&quot;, &quot;his never-ending crying was tedious&quot;, &quot;der var en løben og råben på gangene&quot;, &quot;people ran and cried in the hall&quot;. This use has a connotation of something habitual and is often used in a negative sense. It is used in formal information like &quot;Henstillen af cykler forbudt&quot;, &quot;It is prohibited to leave your bike here.&quot; Whereas the infinitive is accompanied with adjectives in the neuter (&quot;det er svært at flyve&quot;, &quot;it is difficult to fly&quot;), the verbal noun governs the common gender. Due to the rarity of this form, Danes often mistakenly write &quot;Henstilling af cykler forbudt&quot; (lit. &quot;Recommendation of bikes prohibited&quot;) instead, using a more familiar word form.

Verbal nouns like &quot;viden&quot; &quot;knowledge&quot; (literally: &quot;knowing&quot;) or &quot;kunnen&quot; &quot;ability&quot; (literally: &quot;being able&quot;) have become lexicalised due to the influence of German (&quot;Wissen&quot;, &quot;Können&quot;). Like the proper verbal noun, these forms have no plural, and they cannot carry the definite article; so, when English has &quot;the knowledge&quot;, Danish must use a pronoun or a circumlocution: e.g. &quot;hans viden&quot;, &quot;denne viden&quot;, &quot;den viden man havde&quot;.

Danish has various suffixes for turning a verb into a real noun:
* the suffix &quot;-(n)ing&quot;: &quot;hængning&quot; &quot;hanging&quot; (: &quot;hænge&quot;), &quot;samling&quot; &quot;collection&quot; (: &quot;samle&quot;). The suffix, which is still productive, is related to the German &quot;-(n)ung&quot; and the English &quot;-ing&quot;. Words with this suffix belong to the common (originally feminine) gender. The variant without &quot;-n-&quot; is used after stems ending in &quot;n, nd&quot;, &quot;r&quot; and consonant + &quot;l&quot;.
* the suffix &quot;-else&quot;: &quot;bekræftelse&quot; &quot;confirmation&quot; (: &quot;bekræfte&quot;). The suffix, which is still productive, takes the common gender.
* the suffix &quot;-sel&quot;: &quot;fængsel&quot; &quot;jail&quot; (: &quot;fange&quot;), &quot;fødsel&quot; &quot;birth&quot; (: føde&quot;). The suffix is used to form both concrete nouns (in the neuter) and abstract nouns (in the common).
* the verbal stem with no ending: &quot;fald&quot; &quot;fall&quot; (: &quot;falde&quot;), &quot;tab&quot; &quot;loss&quot; (: &quot;tabe&quot;), &quot;kast&quot; &quot;throw&quot; (: &quot;kaste&quot;), &quot;håb&quot; &quot;hope&quot; (: &quot;håbe&quot;), normally as a neuter noun.
* the verbal stem with some change of vowel or consonant: &quot;gang&quot; &quot;walk(ing)&quot; (: &quot;gå&quot;), &quot;stand&quot; &quot;state&quot; (: &quot;stå&quot;), &quot;sang&quot; &quot;song&quot; (: &quot;synge&quot;), &quot;dåb&quot; &quot;baptism&quot; (: &quot;døbe&quot;). They normally have the common gender.
* the suffix &quot;-(e)st&quot;: &quot;fangst&quot; &quot;catching&quot; (: &quot;fange&quot;), &quot;ankomst&quot; &quot;arrival&quot; (: &quot;ankomme&quot;), &quot;hyldest&quot; &quot;ovation&quot; (: &quot;hylde&quot;). The type takes the common gender. 
* the suffix &quot;-tion, -sion&quot;: &quot;funktion&quot; &quot;function&quot; (: &quot;fungere&quot;), &quot;korrektion&quot; &quot;correction&quot; (: &quot;korrigere&quot;), &quot;eksplosion&quot; &quot;explosion&quot; (: &quot;eksplodere&quot;). This type is restricted to stems of Latin origin (which normally have the suffix &quot;-ere&quot; in the verbal forms, cf. German &quot;-ieren&quot;). They take the common gender.
* the suffix &quot;-n&quot;: &quot;råben&quot; &quot;shouting&quot; (: &quot;råbe&quot;), &quot;løben&quot; &quot;running&quot; (: &quot;løbe&quot;). Takes the common gender.

==Numerals==
===Overview===
The Danish numbers are:

===Vigesimal system ===
Counting above forty is in part based on a base 20 number system, called vigesimal: &quot;halvtred-s(inds-tyve)&quot; = 2 x 20, &quot;tre-s(inds-tyve)&quot; = 3 x 20, &quot;halvfjerd-s(inds-tyve)&quot; = 3 x 20, &quot;fir-s(inds-tyve)&quot; = 4 x 20, &quot;halvfem-s(inds-tyve)&quot; = 4 x 20 (&quot;halvtredje&quot;, &quot;halvfjerde&quot; and &quot;halvfemte&quot; (lit. &quot;halfthird&quot;, &quot;halffourth&quot; and halffifth&quot;) being old words for 2, 3 and 4). This is unlike Swedish and Norwegian, both of which use a decimal system.

The word &quot;fyrre&quot; / &quot;fyrretyve&quot; = &quot;40&quot; does not belong to the vigesimal system. The optional second part of the word is not the number &quot;tyve&quot;, &quot;20&quot;, but an old plural of &quot;ti&quot;, &quot;ten&quot; (like in English &quot;forty&quot;, German &quot;vierzig&quot;); the first part is a variant of the number &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;four&quot;. Similarly, &quot;tredive&quot; is a compound of &quot;tre&quot;, &quot;three&quot;, and a weakened form of the old plural of &quot;ti&quot;, &quot;ten&quot;.

Vigesimal systems are known in several European languages: French, Breton, Welsh, Albanian, and Basque. Some scholars speculate that the system belongs to an &quot;Old European&quot; (i.e. pre-Indo-European) substratum, whereas others argue that the system is a recent innovation of the Middle Ages. See Vigesimal.

=== Sequence of numbers ===
The ones are placed before the tens with an intervening &quot;og&quot; (&quot;and&quot;): &quot;toogfyrre&quot; (42), &quot;seksoghalvfjers&quot; (76). The ones and the tens are placed after the hundreds with an optional &quot;og&quot;: &quot;to hundred (og) femoghalvfjers&quot;. This system is similar to that of German and Dutch (&quot;zweiundvierzig&quot;, &quot;zweihundertfünfundsiebzig&quot;), but unlike that of Swedish (&quot;fyrtiotvå&quot;, &quot;tvåhundrasjuttiofem&quot;).

==Adjectives and adverbs==
=== Declension ===
There are three forms of the adjective in Danish:
# basic form or common, used with singular words of the common gender (&quot;n-words&quot;).
#: &quot;en billig bog&quot;, &quot;a cheap book&quot;; &quot;en stor dreng&quot;, &quot;a big boy&quot;
# &quot;t&quot;-form or neuter, used with singular words of the neuter gender (&quot;t-words&quot;) and as an adverb.
#: &quot;et billigt tæppe&quot;, &quot;a cheap carpet&quot;; &quot;et stort hus&quot;, &quot;a big house&quot;
#: &quot;han bor billigt&quot;, &quot;he has a low rent (lit. lives cheaply)&quot; 
# &quot;e&quot;-form or plural / definite, used in the plural and with a definite article, a pronoun or a genitive.
#: &quot;den billige bog&quot;, &quot;the cheap book&quot;; &quot;hans store hus&quot;, &quot;his big house&quot;
#: &quot;billige bøger&quot;, &quot;cheap books&quot;; &quot;store huse&quot;, &quot;big houses&quot;

Only words ending in a consonant take -e. Only words ending in a consonant or the vowels -i or -å take -t. Others are unchanged.

===Agreement===
The adjective must agree with the word that it qualifies in both gender and number. This rule also applies when the adjective is used predicatively: &quot;huset er stort&quot;, &quot;the house is big&quot;, or &quot;bøgerne er billige&quot;, &quot;the books are cheap&quot;.

An exception to the rule of agreement are the superlative and, in regular prose, the past participle when used in the verbal meaning (e.g. &quot;børnene er sluppet løs&quot;, &quot;the children have been let out&quot;, but &quot;børnene er løsslupne&quot;, &quot;the children are unrestrained&quot;).

=== Definite form===
The definite &quot;e&quot;-form is historically identical to the so-called weak declension of the Germanic adjective, cf. German &quot;ein großes Haus&quot;, &quot;a big house&quot; ~ &quot;das große Haus&quot;, &quot;the big house&quot;. But whereas the German definite form is not used after a genitive (&quot;Peters großes Haus&quot;), or following the bare forms of the possessive and indefinite pronouns (&quot;mein, kein großes Haus&quot;) – but conversely is used after the indefinite pronoun in the forms that have an ending (&quot;meinem, keinem großen Haus&quot; = &quot;dem großen Haus&quot;) – the Danish definite form is used in all instances after any determiner save the indefinite article:
===Comparison===
The Danish adjectives and adverbs are inflected according to three degrees of comparison. The comparative has the ending &quot;-ere&quot; (sometimes &quot;-re&quot;) and the superlative has the ending &quot;-st&quot; (sometimes &quot;-est&quot;): e.g. &quot;hurtig, hurtigere, hurtigst&quot;, &quot;quick, -er, -est&quot;; &quot;fræk, frækkere, frækkest&quot;, &quot;impertinent/audacious/kinky, -er, -est&quot;; &quot;lang, længere, længst&quot; (with umlaut), &quot;long, -er, -est&quot;. The choice between &quot;-st&quot; and &quot;-est&quot; is determined by the syllable structure (to avoid uncomfortable consonant clusters), whereas the variant &quot;-re&quot; is used only in a few frequent comparatives.

In many cases, especially in longer words and words of a Latin or Greek origin, the comparative and superlative are formed with the adverbs &quot;mere&quot; and &quot;mest&quot; instead: e.g. &quot;intelligent, mere intelligent, mest intelligent&quot;.

The comparative is inflexible, and it is not used with the definite article (in which case Danish uses the superlative instead). The conjunction of comparison is &quot;end&quot;, &quot;than&quot;.

The superlative is inflected like the positive (the &quot;t&quot;-form being identical to the &quot;n&quot;-form); &quot;længst, længste&quot;. When used as a predicate, the basic form is used instead of the &quot;e&quot;-form: &quot;hans ben er længst&quot; &quot;his legs are the longest&quot;. And since a superlative used attributively must necessarily modify something definite, the &quot;e&quot;-form is always used there: &quot;den vredeste killing er vredest&quot; &quot;the angriest kitty is angriest&quot;.

===Irregularities===
The inflection of some adjectives is irregular:
* Ny (new) and fri (free) take -t and optionally -e, even though they end in vowels.
* Several common adjectives with the suffix &quot;-s&quot; (historically the ending of the genitive) are inflexible, e.g. &quot;fælles&quot;, &quot;common&quot; (: &quot;fælle&quot;, &quot;fellow&quot;); &quot;ens&quot;, &quot;identical&quot; (: &quot;en&quot; &quot;one&quot;); &quot;træls&quot;, &quot;annoying&quot; (: &quot;træl&quot;, &quot;slave&quot;) (one also hears &quot;trælst, trælse&quot;).
* Adjectives with the very common -sk ending are special. If they are polysyllabic or refer to a country, geographic area or ethnic group, they never take -t. Et &quot;klassisk stykke&quot; (a classical piece), &quot;et svensk hus&quot; (a Swedish house). Otherwise the -t is optional. Et &quot;friskt pust&quot;, or &quot;et frisk pust&quot; (a breath of fresh air).
* Some words never take the &quot;t&quot;-ending: stems ending in another &quot;-t&quot; (e.g. &quot;mat&quot;, &quot;weak&quot;; &quot;sort&quot;, &quot;black&quot;) stems ending in &quot;-et (-ed)&quot; (e.g. &quot;tobenet&quot;, &quot;biped&quot;; &quot;elsket&quot;, &quot;loved&quot;; &quot;fremmed&quot;, &quot;foreign&quot;). This is also the case with the word &quot;glad&quot; &quot;happy&quot;.
* The &quot;t&quot;-form sometimes undergoes phonetical changes that are not reflected orthographically, especially shortening of the preceding vowel or assimilation of a preceding consonant: e.g. &quot;god&quot; : &quot;godt&quot; ; &quot;ny&quot; : &quot;nyt&quot; ; &quot;syg&quot; : &quot;sygt&quot; (alternatively ). The adjectives ending in &quot;-en&quot; (originally past participles of the strong verbs) have either &quot;-ent&quot; or &quot;-et&quot; in the &quot;t&quot;-form: e.g. &quot;et sunke(n)t skib&quot;, &quot;a sunken ship&quot;; &quot;et give(n)t antal&quot;, &quot;a given number&quot; (the choice is often a matter of style or tradition).
* Adjectives in &quot;-vis&quot; have an optional &quot;-t&quot; in the &quot;t&quot;-form: &quot;et gradvis(t) salg&quot;, &quot;a phased sale&quot;.
* Some adverbs may be formed with the basic form instead of the &quot;t&quot;-form, especially those ending in &quot;-ig&quot;, &quot;-lig&quot; and &quot;-vis&quot;: &quot;det forstår han selvfølgelig ikke&quot;, &quot;that, of course, he does not understand&quot;; the &quot;t&quot;-less form of such adverbs is obligatory when the adverb is isolated (i.e. with no corresponding adjective) or the meaning of the adverb is essentially different from that of the adjective (e.g. &quot;endelig&quot;, &quot;finally, at last&quot; ~ &quot;endeligt&quot;, &quot;definitively&quot;). In other cases, the &quot;t&quot;-less form is preferred when the adverb qualifies an adjective (e.g. &quot;væsentlig(t) større&quot;, considerably larger&quot;).
* The comparative and superlative of some frequent adjectives have umlaut: e.g. &quot;lang, længere, længst&quot;, &quot;long, longer, longest&quot;; &quot;ung, yngre, yngst&quot;, &quot;young, younger, youngest&quot;; &quot;stor, større, størst&quot;, &quot;big, bigger, biggest&quot;.
* One adjective is suppletive: &quot;lille&quot;, &quot;little, small&quot; (&quot;n&quot;- and &quot;t&quot;-form and definite &quot;e&quot;-form) ~ &quot;små&quot; (plural &quot;e&quot;-form), &quot;småt&quot; (adverb &quot;t&quot;-form). Six adjectives are suppletive in the three degrees of comparison: &quot;god, bedre, bedst&quot;, &quot;good, better, best&quot;; &quot;dårlig, værre, værst&quot;, &quot;bad, worse, worst&quot;; &quot;gammel, ældre, ældst&quot;, &quot;old, older, oldest&quot;, &quot;mange, flere, flest&quot;; &quot;many, more, most&quot;; &quot;megen/-et, mere, mest&quot;, &quot;much, more, most&quot;; &quot;lille / lidt, mindre, mindst&quot; &quot;little, less / smaller, least / smallest&quot;. Irregular, but not suppletive are &quot;få, færre, færrest&quot;, &quot;few, fewer, fewest&quot; and &quot;nær, nærmere, nærmest&quot;, &quot;close, closer, closest&quot;.

==Interjections==
Danish has a number of interjections. Emotive interjections include &#x27;ow&#x27; among others. Response tokens include and &#x27;yes&#x27; and &#x27;no&#x27;, and (approx. &#x27;oh&#x27;), and . When responding to polar questions, and are sensitive to the presence of a negation ( &#x27;not&#x27;, &#x27;nobody&#x27; or &#x27;never&#x27;) in the question, so that confirms a negated statement, and , an alternate form of is used to disconfirm a negated statement. They can be used in various combinations with other words (including other response tokens).

== Syntax ==
Danish is a V2-language, meaning that the finite verb can usually be found in second position in a main clause. 

The basic sentence structure is Subject-Verb-Object. Paul Diderichsen developed a model of the Danish sentences with different slots to be filled. 

=== Main Clauses ===
According to Diderichsen&#x27;s model, main clauses have the following structure: 

Not every slot of the model needs to be filled in order to form a grammatical main clause. The model shows relative positions of constituents, especially in relation to the finite verb. So a sentence like

is fully grammatical even though not every slot of the clause model is filled. The only position that is obligatory to form a clause is the v-position of the finite verb.

Every slot of the model can be filled by specific constituents. 

The F-position can be filled by a nominal as subject or object, adverbials or non-finite verbs, i.e. by most phrases that can form constituents.

As Danish is a V2-language, the second position (v) is always filled with the finite verb. 

If the subject was not in the F-position, it can be found in the n-position, other nominals are also possible. 

The a-position contains clausal adverbials, e.g. negation and may contain more than one element.

Non-finite verbs or particles or both can be found in the V-position. 

The N-position is filled by nominals which can function as objects, in case of ditransitive verbs there can be two objects here, complements or the real subject if there is a dummy subject der in F-position.

The A-position contains other adverbials, which are called content adverbials.

The N-position and A-position can also be seen as sequences of positions as they can be filled by more than one constituent and because there is an internal order to these constituents, e.g. that direct objects usually follow indirect objects in the N-position. 

==== Constituents in the F-position ====
The F-position of main clauses can be filled by a variety of constituents. When this happens, the subject is moved to the n-position. Most frequently, adverbial expressions of time and place are moved to the F-position.

This movement is performed to mark the fronted constituent pragmatically, both constituents with high and low pragmatic prominence can be fronted. So you can find information already known from the pretext in this position as well as new information. To express contrast, the element in F-position is stressed. Focused elements are usually not found in the F-position with the exception of wh-words in wh-questions.

=== Subordinate Clauses ===
Below you can see the model for the structure of subordinate clauses:

Different to main clauses, the first position k is for the subordinate conjunction. This position is usually filled, but the conjunction &quot;at&quot; and the relative pronoun &quot;som&quot; can sometimes be omitted.

The subject of the clause follows in the n-position. This position needs to be filled in every subordinate clause.

In difference to main clauses, clausal adverbials precede the finite verb in subordinate clauses.

===Sentence types===
====Questions====
Danish has a number of question types. Polar interrogatives have interrogative word order (i.e. an unfilled foundation field), while content questions have a question word ( &#x27;wh-word&#x27;) in the foundation field. Declarative questions and in situ questions also exist.
====Imperative====
Besides using the imperative form of the verb, the imperative sentence type is characterized by not having a subject. However, it is possible to have it, always placed after the verb.

<text>Jeffrey &quot;Free&quot; Luers is an American political activist from Los Angeles, California, who served a ten-year prison sentence for an arson motivated by environmental concerns. On February 14, 2007, the Oregon Court of Appeals overturned Luers&#x27; sentence, instructing the Lane County circuit court to determine a new sentence. That court reduced the sentence from 22 years, 8 months to 10 years in February 2008, after what &quot;The Independent&quot; described as an &quot;international campaign for a more appropriate sentence for a crime in which no one was hurt.&quot;

==Background==
Luers is a former resident of Eugene, Oregon and helped establish Red Cloud Thunder, a group of activists who organized a tree sitting campaign to stop the clear-cutting of old growth forests outside of Fall Creek, Oregon.

==Arson and sentencing==
The first incident took place in Eugene, Oregon in the United States when Luers and Craig Marshall planted crude delay devices for an attempted arson of trucks at the Tyree Oil Company. The two placed a section of cloth, which was draped over a gallon milk jug filled with a fuel and soap mixture, in the fuel tank of a double-trailer fuel truck. According to authorities, the potential blast could have caused damage over two city blocks.

On June 16, 2000, he set fire to three light trucks at Romania Chevrolet dealership suspectedly via the use of bombs, in Eugene as a protest against excessive consumption and global warming, along with Craig &quot;Critter&quot; Marshall, who was sentenced to five and a half years in prison. The arson destroyed three pickup trucks including a 2000 Silverado. Luers might have received a comparable sentence if he had not been convicted of an earlier attempted arson as well. Luers was initially sentenced to 22 years, 8 months in prison. Supporters argued that his sentence was excessive, because no one was injured and property damage was estimated at only $40,000

The Oregon Court of Appeals overturned the sentence in 2007, remanding the case to the Lane County circuit court for resentencing. In February 2008, the circuit court approved a reduction in his term to 10 years, most of which had already been served.

==Reaction to sentence==
Luers has at times been a cause célèbre among some radicals, anti-prison activists, and individuals associated with the Earth Liberation Front (ELF), although Luers has said that he does not consider himself to be an ELF member.

== Release ==
Luers was mistakenly released early from prison in October 2009 after an error calculating his sentence. He returned to prison after visiting his parole officer. He was released from prison on December 16, 2009, after serving almost ten years. Amy Goodman of &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; interviewed him about a week later and spoke about his sentencing, time in prison, and environmental attitudes. His attorney, Lauren Regan, was interviewed as well.

== Personal life ==

Luers identifies as an anarchist.

<doc id="1324441" wikidata="Q116842" url="?curid=1324441" title="Walter Haefner">
<text>Walter Haefner (13 September 1910 – 19 June 2012) was a Swiss businessman and a thoroughbred racehorse owner and breeder in Ireland.

As a young man Haefner went to work in the auto industry as an employee of the Swiss division of General Motors Corporation. He eventually moved to England where he acquired an automobile franchise before returning home to open a Volkswagen dealership. Recognizing the important role a computer could play in his growing chain of dealerships, in 1957 Haefner became one of the first in Switzerland to import an IBM system for business use. This led to his 1964 creation of Automation Center A.G., a computer services company in Zürich.

In 1976, he expanded operations to the US and, after merging his company with Russell Artzt&#x27;s and Charles Wang&#x27;s publicly owned software company, Computer Associates International, Inc., in 1987, Haefner was CA&#x27;s largest individual shareholder until his death. He continued to own AMAG Automobil- und Motoren, a highly successful Swiss automobile dealership chain. Until his death, at age 101, he was the oldest person worth more than a billion dollars.

Through horse racing, Haefner met art dealer Daniel Wildenstein, who was himself a successful horse breeder. In the mid-1960s, Haefner acquired his first paintings from Wildenstein&#x27;s New York branch. 

==Moyglare Stud Farm==
In 1962 Haefner purchased the Moyglare Stud Farm near the town of Maynooth, County Kildare, Ireland. His thoroughbred racehorses have won numerous Group One and British Classic Races in England, Ireland, and France as well as important races at other venues in Europe, North America, Japan, Australia, and Hong Kong.

In the United States Moyglare&#x27;s racing stable was handled by trainer Christophe Clement while Dermot K. Weld is the trainer in charge of its European operations. In 1991 Weld became the first European-based trainer to win a race in Hong Kong when Moyglare&#x27;s colt Additional Risk won the Hong Kong Invitational Bowl at Sha Tin Racecourse.

In 1975, the Curragh Racecourse honored Moyglare&#x27;s contribution to Irish racing by naming a Group I race the Moyglare Stud Stakes. In 1988 Trinity College, Dublin awarded Haefner an honorary doctorate for his services to the Irish bloodstock industry and for his contributions to education in Ireland.

Selective major race wins by some of the horses owned or bred by Moyglare Stud Farm: 
* Additional Risk - Hong Kong Bowl
* Again Tomorrow - Premio Parioli
* Assert - Prix du Jockey Club, Irish Derby Stakes 
* Bikala - Prix du Jockey Club, Prix Ganay
* Brief Truce - St. James&#x27;s Palace Stakes

* Trusted Partner - Irish 1,000 Guineas
* Twilight Agenda - won Meadowlands Cup, San Pasqual Handicap, Del Mar Breeders&#x27; Cup Mile. Career earnings of US$2,177,843

Haefner&#x27;s daughter, Eva Maria Bucher-Haefner, owns Moyglare Stud. As of November 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated her net worth at US$2.4 billion. She is married with two children and lives in Zurich.

<text>Erivan Karl Matthias Haub (29 September 1932 – 6 March 2018) was a German billionaire businessman, and the managing director and part owner of Tengelmann Group, one of Germany&#x27;s largest retailers. At the time of his death in March 2018, his net worth was estimated at US$6.4 billion.

== Early life==
Erivan Haub was born 29 September 1932 in Wiesbaden, Germany. He was the son of Erich Haub and Elizabeth Haub (born Schmitz-Scholl) (1899–1977), who originated from the Mülheim family Schmitz-Scholl, the owners of the grocery chain Tengelmann.

==Career==
After the Second World War, he completed two internships with the Jewel Tea company in Chicago and the Alpha-Beta company in La Habra, California, before returning to Germany to study economics at the University of Hamburg. In the 1960s, he and his wife lived in Tacoma, Washington. In July of 2012 he, along with his wife Helga, made a contribution of more than 295 works of western American art to the Tacoma Art Museum. At one time, he was the 6th richest man in the U.S., just one position ahead of Bill Gates, but later dropped to about 250th. Haub died at his home in Wyoming, US.

He joined the family business in 1963. Upon the death of his uncle Karl Schmitz-Scholl in March 1969 he became the group&#x27;s managing director. Haub concentrated the Tengelmann group business on the retail trade. Under his guidance Tengelmann expanded: in 1971 it took over the grocery chain &quot;Kaiser&#x27;s&quot;; in 1972 Haub founded the discount grocery retailer &quot;Plus&quot;. In the following years, Tengelmann focused on the development of its international business, which led to the 1979 takeover of The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company. In 2000, he handed the position over to his son Karl-Erivan, and joined the supervisory board.

==Family==
Erivan Haub married Helga Otto in 1958. They lived in Wiesbaden and had three sons:
* Karl-Erivan Haub (1960-2018)
* Georg Haub
* Christian W.E. Haub (born 1964)

===Honors===
The Haub School of Business at Saint Joseph&#x27;s University is named in his honour. The Helga Otto Haub School of Environment and Natural Resources at the University of Wyoming is named for his wife, Helga.

<doc id="1324446" wikidata="Q7933973" url="?curid=1324446" title="Virgin Mobile USA">
<text>Virgin Mobile USA was a no-contract Mobile Virtual Network Operator. It used Sprint&#x27;s network for coverage. It licensed the Virgin Mobile brand from United Kingdom-based Virgin Group. Virgin Mobile USA was headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, and provided service to approximately 6 million customers.

Founded in 2001 as a joint venture between Virgin Group and Sprint Corporation, Virgin Mobile USA commenced operations in June 2002 as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), providing services via the Sprint 1900 MHz CDMA network. In 2009, Sprint Nextel bought out joint-venture partner Virgin Group, becoming the sole owner of Virgin Mobile USA.

In June 2017, Virgin Mobile dropped all Android and began to only offer iPhones to new customers under its new &quot;Inner Circle&quot; unlimited plan. Following the discontinuation of the plan in 2018, it began to restore Android devices to its lineup.

In January 2020, Virgin Mobile announced that it would shut down, and transfer its remaining customers to Boost Mobile the following month in preparation for the Sprint and T-Mobile merger.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
Virgin Mobile USA was formed in 2000 in San Francisco. In July 2000, John Tantum and Dave Whetstone pitched Richard Branson on entering the U.S. market after Virgin had successfully launched Virgin Mobile in the United Kingdom in 1999. At that point, the U.S. team began pitching the U.S. mobile operators on the concept of an MVNO, which at the time was not well understood. The MVNO concept Virgin Mobile was pitching to mobile operators was a joint venture, where both parties would have aligned incentives, rather than the often-contentious relationship that mobile operators had with resellers. A joint venture was created between Virgin Group and Sprint Corporation, and Dan Schulman was brought in to run the business. Virgin Mobile USA began operating in the summer of 2002. Because prepaid mobile had a downmarket perception at the time, Virgin Mobile USA called its service &quot;pay as you go.&quot;
=== Initial public offering ===
In May 2007, Virgin Mobile USA, Inc. initiated an initial public offering (IPO) by filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. 
On October 10, 2007, Virgin Mobile&#x27;s sold 27.5 million shares at US$15 per share, at the low end of the original $15–$17 prediction.

On November 15, 2007, approximately one month after the IPO, Virgin Mobile USA announced earnings for the three-month period ended September 30, 2007. The company reported that its third-quarter loss widened to $7.3 million, compared with a loss of $5.1 million in the year-ago quarter. The company also reported a pro-forma loss of 15¢ per share, compared with a loss of 10¢ per share in the year-ago period. , shares of the company&#x27;s common stock had declined to $9.19 per share.

The company reported in 2007 that it held an exclusive license for the Virgin Mobile brand in the United States, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico until the end of 2027. In exchange, Virgin Mobile USA agreed to pay 0.25% of gross revenues up to an annual limit of $4 million, adjusted annually for inflation.

=== Acquisition of Helio ===
In 2008, Virgin Mobile USA acquired Helio, Inc., a competing mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) also hosted on the Sprint network, aimed at post-paid, contract users. By late 2009, Virgin Mobile USA ceased selling new Helio phones or service, dropping the Helio name. 

=== Full acquisition by Sprint Nextel ===
On July 28, 2009, Sprint Nextel Corporation agreed to acquire the outstanding shares of Virgin Mobile USA, Inc. in return for Sprint Nextel stock valued at approximately US$5.50 per share of Virgin Mobile USA common stock. Prior to the purchase, Sprint Nextel owned 13.1% of Virgin Mobile USA.

After the acquisition, Sprint Nextel formed the Sprint Prepaid Group, an organizational division which included Sprint&#x27;s other prepaid offerings, Boost Mobile and Common Cents Mobile.

=== Initial smartphones and Beyond Talk plans introduction ===
In May 2010, Virgin Mobile USA began offering its first smartphone, the BlackBerry Curve 8530, combined with new, unlimited text and data Beyond Talk-branded plans.

=== Discontinuation of Helio ===
Sprint Nextel announced in March 2010 that Virgin Mobile USA would stop providing service to Helio post-paid customers on May 25, 2010. Sprint Nextel offered Helio customers incentives to switch to Sprint-branded service plans.

=== Integration of Common Cents Mobile ===
On May 18, 2011, Sprint Nextel discontinued operating its Common Cents Mobile pre-paid brand. Common Cents Mobile customers were transitioned to a Virgin Mobile USA payLo service plan that allowed the former Common Cents Mobile customers to keep their existing $.07 per minute rate.

=== Initial 4G devices ===
On May 31, 2012, Virgin Mobile USA began offering 4G products and services using Sprint&#x27;s 2500 MHz 4G WiMAX network. The HTC EVO V 4G, which was also previously released by Sprint as the HTC EVO 3D was the first 4G smartphone.

On February 25, 2013, Virgin Mobile USA released the Samsung Galaxy Victory 4G LTE, its first 4G device using Sprint&#x27;s 4G LTE network. On June 28, 2013, Virgin Mobile USA released the Apple iPhone 5, its second device taking advantage of Sprint&#x27;s LTE network. On April 1, 2014, Virgin Mobile USA released the NETGEAR Mingle mobile hotspot, its first tri-band device which is capable of using all three of Sprint&#x27;s LTE bands.

=== Inner Circle, transition to iPhone only ===
In June 2017, Virgin Mobile USA announced a new promotional offer known as &quot;Inner Circle&quot;, offering an &quot;unlimited&quot; data plan (subject to throttling of media streaming quality, and full throttling of data after 23 GB of usage) for $50 per-month, and that new customers would receive a year of service for $1, and another six-month period for $1 if they purchase a new device after their second year of service. At the same time, the carrier transitioned to only offering iPhone products to new customers, and dropped all other devices from its smartphone lineup.

The Inner Circle plan was discontinued in August 2018; the carrier then started to return Android devices to its lineup, citing consumer demand.

=== Discontinuation ===
In mid-2018 Virgin Mobile was pulled out of Target stores. Shortly thereafter a majority of the Virgin Mobile workforce was laid off. In April 2019 the brand was pulled out of Best Buy and in May, Meijer. In October 2019, Virgin Mobile was pulled from Walmart leaving the company without a national retail presence. In January 2020, the company began notifying its customers by text message that it was discontinuing service and that in February 2020 customer accounts would be migrated to Boost Mobile.

== Services ==
Virgin Mobile USA offered wireless products and services through Virgin Mobile.

=== Virgin Mobile ===
Virgin Mobile-branded service was available within the contiguous United States, Hawaii and Puerto Rico coverage areas under the Sprint nationwide network.

=== Assurance Wireless ===
Virgin Mobile offered Assurance Wireless, the telephone service subsidized by the federal Lifeline Assistance program, a government benefit program supported by the federal Universal Service Fund. The Assurance Wireless brand was moved to the T-Mobile family in 2020 after the Sprint and T-Mobile merger was officially completed and after Virgin Mobile was officially shut down and folded into Boost Mobile.

== Network ==
=== Coverage ===
Virgin Mobile USA provided wireless services in the contiguous United States, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico via parent, Sprint&#x27;s nationwide CDMA, EVDO, LTE, and Sprint Spark networks.

=== Phone support ===
Since June 27, 2017, Virgin Mobile USA sold the iPhone in various models. Options included:
* iPhone 6
* iPhone 6S
* iPhone 6S Plus
* iPhone SE (1st generation)

* iPhone 7
* iPhone 7 Plus
* iPhone 8
* iPhone 8 Plus
* iPhone X
Customers who already owned an iPhone were able to bring it to Virgin Mobile USA if it was compatible. From February 2018, grandfathered customers without the iPhone-only Inner Circle plan remained eligible to purchase Android devices, feature phones and mobile broadband modems.

== Services ==
Inner Circle Virgin Mobile USA has one plan offering for new customers. The iPhone-only Inner Circle plan offers customers unlimited talk, text and data for $50. However, when users purchase an iPhone or bring their own iPhone and port their number to Virgin Mobile, the first 6 months of service are $1 per month. The Inner Circle plan also promotes &quot;perks&quot; that customers have exclusive access to as Inner Circle members. These &quot;perks&quot; include a companion ticket on Virgin Atlantic, an extra night at Virgin Hotels and discounts from Virgin Wines.

Data Love and Data Love+ Virgin Mobile USA maintains the Data Love and Data Love+ plans for customers who were already using these services before June 21, 2017. These unlimited plans offer high-speed 4G LTE data. Data-Free Music is automatically included for those on Virgin Mobile&#x27;s Data Love or Data Love + plan with Streaming Music. Users must download one (or more) of Virgin Mobile&#x27;s streaming music partner&#x27;s apps through Google Play or the iTunes App Store in order to access Data-Free Music. Virgin Mobile USA unlimited service plans for phones do allow roaming for devices that have been enabled to roam. Virgin Mobile maintains the text content of text messages for three months and records of to whom and when text messages were sent for two to three months.

===Member benefits===
Customers on the Inner Circle plan are eligible for member benefits. The concept is the same as Virgin Mobile Canada&#x27;s program of the same name, which was first introduced in 2010, and competitor T-Mobile Tuesdays, which was introduced in 2016. Most member benefits differ between the American and Canadian versions, though the programs do share some partners and deals in common, including H&amp;M and Virgin Hotels.

===Former services ===
Virgin Mobile USA offered older services that are now discontinued. Customers with such services may be entitled to a grandfather clause.

Broadband2Go Internet plans were offered with Virgin Mobile USA&#x27;s mobile broadband modems. Users could purchase access to Broadband2Go services by the day or by the month. A daily plan offered 250 MB of full-speed access. Monthly plans ranged from 500 MB to 6 GB. access.

PayLo plans offered users unlimited talk and text for $40 per month.

Virgin Mobile offered talk, text, and mobile web access plans for feature phones and smartphones under the Data Done Right brand. These plans could only be purchased at Walmart.

== Account security ==
In September, 2012, media outlets began reporting on the findings of Kevin Burke, a software developer and Virgin Mobile USA customer. Burke&#x27;s experimentation led him to claim that Virgin Mobile USA&#x27;s account security practices did not adequately protect customer account information.

To access their account via the Virgin Mobile USA website, customers must enter their ten-digit telephone number and a six-digit password. The maximum possible number of six-digit passwords is one million, a relatively small number. According to Burke, Virgin Mobile USA did not employ security techniques that would prevent an attacker from rapidly cycling through all possible password permutations, allowing a brute force attack to succeed in twelve days or less.

In response to the wide media coverage, Virgin Mobile updated its online account access system, limiting users to 20 attempts from one IP address.

== Marketing ==
Virgin Mobile&#x27;s target audience was primarily young adults, and the company often utilized edgy, pop culture content when advertising. On March 15, 2010, Lady Gaga released the music video for Telephone which included product placement for a Virgin Mobile branded LG Rumor. 

Beginning on May 2, 2011, Virgin Mobile USA launched a campaign that revolved around a fictional Hollywood celebrity couple &quot;Sparah&quot;. The campaign was expected to last six months, but ran through the end of 2011. Virgin Mobile produced multiple videos and photo galleries that starred the fictional couple and posted them to a dedicated website &quot;sparah.com.&quot; Virgin Mobile USA hoped to connect the ability for consumers to enjoy data-intensive web content using a Virgin Mobile USA unlimited data plan.

In August 2011, Virgin Mobile USA aired television ads that parodied elements of T-Mobile USA and AT&amp;T Mobility&#x27;s marketing, featuring an unflattering portrayal of spokespersons for both brands.

In March 2012, Virgin Mobile introduced an ad campaign featuring Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, and the slogan &quot;We answer to a higher calling&quot;.

== Retail presence ==
Virgin Mobile products and services were sold via the virginmobileusa.com web site and at partner retail outlets, including Best Buy, RadioShack, Target, Fred Meyer, and Walmart.

<doc id="1324454" wikidata="Q2595685" url="?curid=1324454" title="Isaac Puente">
<text>Isaac Puente Amestoy (3 June 1896 – 1 September 1936), born in Las Carreras near Biscay, was a Basque physician and Spanish anarchist of a strong anarchist communist bent, who adhered to concerns around birth control, hygiene and sexuality. He promoted 
anarcho-naturism, and was active in the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT).

He is best known for his pamphlet &quot;El comunismo libertario&quot; (&quot;Libertarian Communism&quot;) published in 1932. This came to be the adopted programme of the CNT at the May 1936 Congress in Zaragoza, just prior to the Spanish Civil War.

Puente was an important propagandist of anarcho-naturism, was a militant of both the CNT anarcho-syndicalist trade union and Iberian Anarchist Federation. He was among the contributors of the Valencia-based &quot;Orto&quot; magazine between 1932 and 1934. He published the book &quot;El Comunismo Libertario y otras proclamas insurreccionales y naturistas&quot; (en:&quot;Libertarian Communism and other insurrectionary and naturist proclaims&quot;) in 1933, which sold around 100,000 copies. Puente was a doctor who approached his medical practice from a naturist point of view. He saw naturism as an integral solution for the working classes, alongside Neo-Malthusianism, and believed it concerned the living being while anarchism addressed the social being. He believed capitalist societies endangered the well-being of humans from both a socioeconomic and sanitary viewpoint, and promoted anarcho-communism alongside naturism as a solution.

An active militant, he was involved in a failed uprising in Aragon and La Rioja in 1933 for which he suffered repression. Later, Puente was killed by Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War after being arrested and taken to Vitoria and later executed in Pancorbo in 1936. The Isaac Puente battalion was named after him.

<text>Jeffrey Stuart Skoll (born January 16, 1965) is a Canadian engineer, billionaire internet entrepreneur and film producer. He was the first president of eBay, eventually using the wealth this gave him to become a philanthropist, particularly through the Skoll Foundation, and his media company Participant Media. He founded an investment firm, Capricorn Investment Group, soon after and currently serves as its chairman. Born in Montreal, Quebec, he graduated from University of Toronto in 1987 and left Canada to attend Stanford University&#x27;s business school in 1993.

Shortly after graduating from business school, he began his career at eBay, where he wrote the business plan that the company followed from its emergence as a start-up to a larger company. While at the company, he began the eBay Foundation which was allocated pre-IPO stock now worth $32 million. Once eBay&#x27;s second largest stockholder, behind Omidyar, he subsequently cashed out a portion of his company holdings, netting him about $2 billion. With an estimated net worth of $4 billion (as of December 2016), Skoll was ranked by Forbes as the seventh wealthiest Canadian and 134th in the United States.

Through his former film production company, Participant–of which he was founder, owner, and chairman–he produced numerous critically acclaimed films. His first films &quot;Syriana&quot; (2005), &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; (2005), and &quot;North Country&quot; (2005), along with the documentary &quot;Murderball&quot; (2005), accounted for 11 Oscar nominations in 2006. His subsequent films have included &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; (2006), &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; (2006), &quot;The World According to Sesame Street&quot; (2006), &quot;Waiting for &quot;Superman&quot;&quot; (2010), &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012), and his latest, &quot;Spotlight&quot; (2015) won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2016.

== Early life ==
Jeff Skoll was born to a Jewish family in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. His mother was a teacher and his father was a chemical company owner who sold industrial chemicals. The family settled in Toronto in the late seventies. When Skoll was fourteen, his father was diagnosed with cancer which prompted him to discuss with his son how much he regretted not having had the time to do everything he had planned in life. His first job was pumping gas at a York Mills gas station.

He graduated with a BASc with honours in 1987 from the University of Toronto&#x27;s electrical engineering program. While an undergraduate student, he co-edited the engineering students&#x27; satirical newspaper &quot;The Toike Oike.&quot; He paid his way through college by pumping gas in North York, Ontario. After graduating he backpacked around the world for several months before returning and founding two businesses in Toronto: Skoll Engineering, an information technology consulting firm and Micros on the Move Ltd., a computer rental firm. He left Canada in 1993 to earn a Master of Business Administration degree at Stanford Graduate School of Business, graduating in 1995. After Stanford he worked on internet projects for publishing company Knight-Ridder.

== Skoll&#x27;s eBay era ==

In 1996, Skoll met eBay&#x27;s founder Pierre Omidyar, who hired him as the company&#x27;s first president and first full-time employee. While eBay was already profitable at the time Skoll joined, he wrote the business plan that eBay followed in subsequent years, using a typical five-year projection. He remained President until the arrival of Meg Whitman in January 1998 when he became Vice President, Strategic Planning and Analysis until back problems necessitated his departure from full-time employment at the company. In 1998, he championed the creation of the eBay Foundation, which was allocated pre-IPO stock now worth $32 million. Once eBay&#x27;s second largest stockholder, behind Omidyar, he subsequently cashed out a portion of his company holdings, yielding him around $2 billion.

== Participant ==

In 2004, Skoll founded the company Participant to create films that increase public awareness of critical social issues and give audiences opportunities to get involved through education and social action campaigns. In 2005, Skoll&#x27;s first Participant productions were released, with Syriana; Good Night, and Good Luck; North Country; and Murderball, together garnering 11 Oscar nominations. A year later, Skoll financed and played a key role in the creation of the environmental documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, which grew out of a slideshow developed by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore on the climate crisis. The film won the 2006 Academy Award for Best Feature Documentary. &quot;I would never have predicted that a film like &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; would impact so many people&quot;, Skoll told Philanthropy Roundtable.

The Financial Times reported in 2009 that Participant allows Skoll to &quot;pursue social and political causes through a mass medium. From modest beginnings, the company (which Skoll chairs, supported by a team of executives) is now a serious player.&quot; Fortune wrote the next year that Skoll&#x27;s films are not typical Hollywood fare, &quot;they tackle weighty subjects such as eco-Armageddon, petro-terrorism, education reform, and women&#x27;s rights. In short they tend to reflect Skoll&#x27;s progressive, and ultimately optimistic, worldview that shining a light on the world&#x27;s problems will inspire people to band together to bring about change on a large scale. (Indeed, the name &#x27;Participant&#x27; evokes a call to action.)&quot;

Skoll has served as Executive Producer or Producer on nearly 100 Participant films, including &quot;Spotlight&quot;, &quot;Roma&quot;, and &quot;American Factory&quot;, and as of 2019 Participant has won 18 Oscars and received 73 Academy Award nominations. In 2020, the company received another Academy Award nomination and win for best documentary feature for &quot;American Factory&quot;.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, in 2014 Skoll funded the creation of the Skoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, saying at the time: &quot;I founded Participant Media in the belief that a story well told has the power to ignite positive social change. This new center at UCLA TFT is an extension of that vision, with the goal of empowering a new generation and elevating storytelling as a tool to create impact and empower people to connect to the social issues that can have a profound impact on our world.&quot; In March 2019, Participant and the Skoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment released a report, &quot;The State of Social Impact Entertainment&quot;, that said: &quot;social impact entertainment — narrative and documentary film, television, theater, and emerging forms that engage audiences in solving real-world challenges — is not a fad but the future of the entertainment industry.&quot;

In 2019, on behalf of Participant, Skoll and Participant CEO David Linde accepted the newly created TIFF Impact Award from the Toronto International Film Festival; in 2020 the award was renamed the Jeff Skoll Award in Impact Media, and has continued to be awarded to filmmakers whose work has had a social impact as part of the TIFF Tribute Awards.

Skoll announced in April 2024 that Participant was shuttering.

== Philanthropy ==
Skoll is a recipient of the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy, and a Giving Pledge signatory. He has given the eponymous Skoll Foundation approximately $1 billion of eBay stock since its formation in 1999. The Foundation supports &quot;social entrepreneurship&quot;.

As of 2020, Skoll has been working for over ten years to help prevent pandemics and other global threats. In 2009, Skoll donated $100 million to create the Skoll Global Threats Fund to confront threats including climate change, water security, pandemics, nuclear proliferation, and Middle East conflict. The Fund created and spun off a stand-alone non-profit entity, Ending Pandemics, that focuses on pandemic detection and response. In 2011, Skoll&#x27;s film company Participant co-produced the film &quot;Contagion&quot; to raise awareness about the dangers posed by pandemics. Skoll wanted the film be scientifically sound and encourage funding of medical experts; In 2020, following the COVID-19 pandemic media coverage noted it was &quot;shocking in its accuracy&quot;.

In January 2020, Skoll donated $20 million, and an additional $100 million in April, to the Skoll Foundation to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds were used to assist with testing, contact tracing, and provide respiratory devices and other medical equipment to countries that couldn&#x27;t afford it.

Skoll is active in &quot;collaborative philanthropy&quot; and has joined with other philanthropists and foundations to pool resources that then flow to non-profits focused on addressing specific issues at scale. In 2017, Skoll, joined with others to create Co-Impact, a philanthropic funding collaborative seeded with $500 million, whose &quot;specific aim is to fund organizations that are addressing health, education and economic opportunity in low-to-middle income countries&quot;.

Similarly in 2018, Skoll, Chris Anderson, Virgin Unite, among others launched The Audacious Project, a philanthropic funding collaborative with an initial investment of $250 million for &quot;audacious ideas&quot; that deliver &quot;impact at scale&quot;. Some of the first recipients of funding from The Audacious Project included the Environmental Defense Fund, Sight Savers, and The Bail Project.

Skoll has funded the creation of academic centers at two universities. In 2003, Skoll funded the creation of the Skoll Center for Social Entrepreneurship at Oxford University&#x27;s Said Business School. The center is a research center, hub for innovators, and host of the annual Skoll World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship. Called the &quot;Davos for the nonprofit set&quot; by &quot;Forbes&quot;, Skoll World Forum participants have included leading thinkers from South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. In 2019, Skoll also funded the creation of the Skoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. The center is dedicated to promoting social change through entertainment and the arts.

In 2005, Skoll financed The Gandhi Project in partnership with Relief International which created a dubbed version in Arabic of the film &quot;Gandhi&quot;. They used Palestinian voice actors and artists to make the film particularly relevant to Palestinians. With Skoll&#x27;s support, it was screened throughout Palestine to promote non-violence, self-reliance, economic development, and empowerment.

In 2000, Skoll gave C$7.5 million to the University of Toronto to endow three chairs and establish the Jeffrey Skoll BASc/MBA Program, a joint program of the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering and the Rotman School of Management.

===Impact investing===
Skoll was one of the earliest proponents of socially responsible investing, called &quot;impact investing&quot;, through which he invests in for-profit companies whose mission is to deliver both social impact and financial returns. In 2001, Skoll created Capricorn Investment Group &quot;on the premise of socially responsible investing&quot; and the firm now oversees more than $5 billion in client assets and another $3.5 billion in partnership with other organizations. According to Forbes, a &quot;significant portion&quot; of Capricorn&#x27;s assets &quot;has been put to work backing mostly private companies that are in some way aiming to help the environment and combat climate change&quot;. Capricorn&#x27;s early investments included electric carmaker Tesla, Inc., battery technology developer QuantumScape, and air taxi developer Joby Aviation. Other investments include private equity fund Encourage Solar Finance to promote rooftop solar installations in India.

In 2016, Skoll, along with Bono and investment firm TPG, co-founded The Rise Fund, a $2 billion social-impact fund with &quot;a series of strict metrics by which to measure social impact&quot;. Rise&#x27;s investments fall across seven sectors, including agriculture, education, and healthcare, and since 2017, &quot;Rise has invested in more than 25 growth-stage companies that are making a measurable positive social and/or environmental impact&quot;.

== Other activities ==
In November 2022, Skoll bought a minority stake in Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment.

== Personal life ==
In 2014, Skoll married television executive Stephanie Swedlove. In January 2019, it was announced Skoll had filed for divorce from Swedlove.

<doc id="1324467" wikidata="Q585152" url="?curid=1324467" title="Kari Lehtonen">
<text>Kari Lehtonen (born November 16, 1983) is a Finnish former professional ice hockey goaltender who played 14 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Atlanta Thrashers and Dallas Stars. He was selected second overall in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft by the Thrashers, becoming the highest-drafted European goaltender, as well as being tied with Patrik Laine, Alexander Barkov and Kaapo Kakko for the highest-drafted Finnish player in NHL history.

==Playing career==

===Early years===

Lehtonen was drafted second overall in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft by the Atlanta Thrashers after an outstanding 2001–02 season in the Finnish SM-liiga. Lehtonen was the backup goalie for Jokerit, but captured the starting position and won the Urpo Ylönen trophy, given to the best goalie of the season, and the league&#x27;s playoff MVP award, the Jari Kurri trophy. Lehtonen stayed with Jokerit for one more season before moving to North America.

===Atlanta Thrashers===
During the 2003–04 season, Lehtonen mostly spent his time with the Chicago Wolves, the Thrashers&#x27; American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, but he was called up for a number of occasions and played four games for the Thrashers, winning all four of them and posting one shutout. In the four games with the Thrashers, he posted a .953 save percentage and 1.25 goals against average (GAA).

Lehtonen spent the 2004–05 NHL lockout season with the Wolves, adjusting to the North American playing style. After playing 57 games for the Wolves, of which he won 38, posting .929 save percentage and 2.27 GAA, the Thrashers called him up, and Lehtonen started the 2005–06 season as the starting goalie for Atlanta. On the opening night of the 2005–06 season, Lehtonen suffered a serious groin injury when Florida Panthers centre Nathan Horton collided with him. The injury sidelined him for 35 games. Lehtonen was once again injured on April 6, 2006, when Tampa Bay Lightning forward Chris Dingman collided with him; Lehtonen tried to get to his feet, but sprained his ankle in the process.

Shortly into the 2006–07 season, Lehtonen broke the Atlanta Thrashers shutout streak record previously held by Michael Garnett. He also set his career highs in every category. AirTran Airways, a low-cost airline, signed Lehtonen as an endorser for the 2006–07 season. On February 8, 2007, Lehtonen became the Thrashers franchise leader for wins by a goaltender with 49, surpassing Pasi Nurminen&#x27;s record of 48. On April 12, 2007, Lehtonen was the starting goaltender for the Thrashers in their first Stanley Cup playoff game.

After a rough start to the 2007–08 season, Lehtonen suffered another groin injury on October 18, 2007. He would miss 16 games before returning on December 5, 2007. He finished the season with a respectable save percentage to go along with four shutouts as the Thrashers failed to qualify for the 2008 playoffs.

===Dallas Stars===
On February 9, 2010, Lehtonen was traded to the Dallas Stars in exchange for Ivan Vishnevskiy and a fourth-round draft pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft (Ivan Telegin).

Prior to the start of the 2010–11 season, the Stars signed Lehtonen to a three-year, $10.65 million extension. In his first full season in Dallas, Lehtonen compiled a 34–24–11 record with a 2.55 GAA in 69 games played. Lehtonen and the Stars narrowly missed the 2011 playoffs after losing to the Minnesota Wild on the final day of the season to eliminate them from playoff contention, finishing the season only two points behind the defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks for the last playoff spot.

On September 4, 2012, the day before an impending lockout, Lehtonen signed a five-year, $29.5 million contract.

Lehtonen made the playoffs with the Stars for the first time in 2014 as the team finished as the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference where they would eventually be defeated in six games by the top seeded Anaheim Ducks.

Prior to the 2015–16 season, the Stars acquired fellow Finnish goaltender Antti Niemi from the San Jose Sharks to compete with Lehtonen. They alternated regularly the next two seasons. In the 2016 playoffs, Lehtonen established himself as the primary goalie. However, in Game 7 of the second round, he was pulled after giving up three goals in the first period as the Stars&#x27; season ended with a 6–1 loss to the St. Louis Blues for a 4–3 defeat in the series.

He earned his 300th win on December 13, 2017, in a game against the New York Islanders by making 32 saves to clinch a 5–2 win.

== International play ==
Lehtonen has been selected to play for Finland&#x27;s youth and national teams on many occasions. He won a bronze medal at the 2014 Winter Olympics. He played in two games, one victory in the preliminary round and a loss in the semi-finals.

<text>Ben Lewis Reitman M.D. (1879–1943) was an American anarchist and physician to the poor (&quot;the hobo doctor&quot;). He is best remembered today as one of radical Emma Goldman&#x27;s lovers. Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1972 feature film &quot;Boxcar Bertha&quot; is based on &quot;Sister of the Road&quot;, one of Reitman&#x27;s books.

==Biography==
Reitman was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, to poor Russian Jewish immigrants in 1879, and grew up in Chicago. At the age of twelve, he became a hobo, but returned to Chicago and worked in the Polyclinic Laboratory as a &quot;laboratory boy&quot;. In 1900, he entered the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Chicago, completing his medical studies in 1904. During this time he was briefly married; he and his wife had a daughter together. His wife was Mae Schwartz, and their daughter was Jan Gay (born Helen Reitman), the author, nudism advocate, and founder of the nudist &quot;Out-of-Door Club&quot; at Highland, New York.

He worked as a physician in Chicago, choosing to offer services to hobos, prostitutes, the poor, and other outcasts. Notably, he performed abortions, which were illegal at the time. In 1907, Reitman became known as &quot;King of the Hobos&quot; when he opened a Chicago branch of the Hobo College, which became the largest of the International Brotherhood Welfare Association centers for migrant education, political organizing, and social services. 

Reitman met Emma Goldman in 1908, when he offered her use of the college&#x27;s Hobo Hall for a speech, and the two began a love affair, which Goldman described as the &quot;Great Grand Passion&quot; of her life. The two traveled together for almost eight years, working for the causes of birth control, free speech, worker&#x27;s rights, and anarchism. 

During this time, the couple became involved in the San Diego free speech fight in 1912–13. Reitman was kidnapped by a mob, severely beaten, tarred and feathered, branded with &quot;I.W.W.,&quot; and his rectum and testicles were abused. Several years later, the couple were arrested in 1916 under the Comstock laws for advocating birth control, and Reitman served six months in prison.

Both believed in free love, but Reitman&#x27;s practice incited feelings of jealousy in Goldman. He remarried when one of his lovers became pregnant; their son was born while he was in prison. Goldman and Reitman ended their relationship in 1917, after Reitman was released from prison.

Reitman returned to Chicago, ultimately working with the City of Chicago, establishing the Chicago Society for the Prevention of Venereal Disease in the 1930s. His second wife died in 1930, and Reitman married a third time, to Rose Siegal. Reitman later became seriously involved with Medina Oliver, and the couple had four daughters – Mecca, Medina, Victoria, and Olive.

Reitman died in Chicago of a heart attack at the age of sixty-three. He was buried at the Waldheim Cemetery (now Forest Home Cemetery), in Forest Park, Illinois.

<doc id="1324473" wikidata="Q2700609" url="?curid=1324473" title="Tower Grove Park">
<text>Tower Grove Park is a municipal park in St. Louis, Missouri. Located on the south side of the city, the elongated park extends from Kingshighway Boulevard east to Grand Boulevard. The park’s predominately residential surroundings include the neighborhoods of Southwest Garden, Shaw, Tower Grove East, and Tower Grove South.

Both Tower Grove Park and the neighboring Missouri Botanical Garden were part of the estate of 19th-century businessman and botanist Henry Shaw. In 1868, Shaw donated the land for the park to the city of St. Louis.

== History ==
Tower Grove Park was originally part of La Petite Prairie, which was settled by the French in the early 18th century. Grazing land was held in common, and farming land was divided into long, narrow tracts. The commons system was abandoned around 1800, and the land began to be sold into private hands. By the 1850s much of the property was owned by German Catholics, recent immigrants from Germany&#x27;s 1848 civil war. The German dairy farmers found it ideal as pasture land. They built comfortable homes and began creating a community toward the end of the 19th century. Blocks were developed, upon which many of the prosperous German immigrants, turned American citizens, built grand homes. The area around the park continues to be home to a number of residential neighborhoods.

Henry Shaw donated the land for the park in 1868, and the park opened to the public in 1872.

== Environment and facilities ==
The park features 32 pavilions of picturesque design, most dating from the Victorian era. The landscape includes a lily pond and formal plantings; the Piper Palm House, a bandstand, the site of music and other special events; as well as tennis courts; a wading pool for small children; open expanses of green; softball diamonds and soccer fields; paths for walkers, joggers, and cyclists, and tall specimen trees and a great variety of bushes. Designed in the gardenesque style by James Gurney Sr., the park has been designated a National Historic Landmark as one of the nation&#x27;s finest examples of a late 19th-century public park. Gurney had been head of the aquatic plants section at Kew Gardens in London, and he remained in St. Louis as superintendent of the park.

The park is home to nearly 400 species of trees, bushes, and flowering plants. It is a well-known birdwatching area, particularly during the spring and fall bird migration seasons. It is part of the Mississippi Flyway and migrating birds rest in the park along their journey. Forty percent of North American songbirds and waterbirds use this route. Examples are many types of warblers, orioles, and Canada geese.

==Statues==
There are several statues from the 1800s along the central corridor of the park. There is a full likeness of Alexander von Humboldt, the German naturalist, geographer and explorer, and one of William Shakespeare the English playwright, both from 1878 and sculpted by German sculptor Ferdinand Freiherr von Miller. von Miller also produced a statue of the Italian navigator and explorer Christopher Columbus that was dedicated in 1886, and placed near the gates and entrance from Grand Avenue.

The Christopher Columbus statue had been annually commemorated by the local Italian American community. In 2016 and 2017, the statue was vandalized with red paint and messages including &quot;murderer&quot; and &quot;Black Lives Matter.&quot; Calls for the statue&#x27;s removal in 2018 initiated forming a commission to make recommendations on the statue&#x27;s future. The Columbus statue was removed from the park in June 2020.

Around the bandstand there are white marble busts of some famous musical composers mounted on columns. Mozart and Rossini by Howard Kretschmar from 1882, Beethoven and Wagner by Ferdinand von Miller from 1884, and Gounod and Verdi by Carlo Nicoli from 1886.

There is a smaller scale statue of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, the German born military officer and American Revolution volunteer, near the Palm house. Steuben later became an American citizen and figure to German Americans. The original, larger statue (by the German sculptor Cuno von Uechtritz-Steinkirch) was commissioned for the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair. The current version was placed in Tower Grove Park in 1968.

Two zinc statues of stags, en couchant and on pedestals, face each other across Center Cross Drive, just west of the Piper Palm House.

==Events==
Many events, from picnics to weddings, are held in the park throughout the year. During the summer, a number of large festivals are held in the park, including ones featuring themes such as international culture and paganism. The park has also been the site of various LGBTQ Pride festivals.

Since 2005, from May through October, a farmers&#x27; market is held from 8-12:30 Saturday mornings just west of the Wading Pool Pavilion. It features local and organic farmers offering fresh produce and meats, baked goods and preserves, as well as prepared foods and drinks, teas and coffees, with stalls for craftsmen and artisans as well.

<doc id="1324480" wikidata="Q1387731" url="?curid=1324480" title="Khoo Teck Puat">
<text>Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat (; 13 January 1917 – 21 February 2004) was a banker and hotel owner, who, with an estimated fortune of S$4.3 billion (US$3,195,953,500), was the wealthiest man in Singapore at one point. He owned the Goodwood Group of boutique hotels in London and Singapore and was the largest single shareholder of the British bank Standard Chartered. The bulk of his fortune came from shares in Standard Chartered, which he bought up in the 1980s to help thwart Lloyds Bank&#x27;s proposed acquisition which many financiers deemed hostile. The Goodwood Park Hotel in Singapore, built in 1900, is a restored historic landmark.

Around the period of his death in 2004, Khoo was ranked as the 108th richest person in the world by the business magazine &quot;Forbes&quot;. Khoo&#x27;s estate has donated S$80 million to Duke–NUS Medical School.

==Biography==
Khoo received his early education in St Joseph&#x27;s Institution in Singapore in 1930. He was educated up to standard eight prior to his marriage at the age of 17, and started working at the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) as an apprentice bank clerk by 1933. While attached with OCBC, Khoo served as the Chairman of Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board for a year in 1958. His rise in OCBC was rapid and he developed strong ties with Tan Chin Tuan until they had a difference of opinion which resulted him leaving OCBC in 1959 as the deputy general manager. He argued that OCBC was growing far too slowly and not opening enough branches in the smaller towns in Peninsular Malaya.

==Career==
In 1960, Khoo restarted his career in banking by founding Malayan Banking (now commonly known as Maybank) with a few partners in Kuala Lumpur. The bank grew rapidly to more than 150 branches within three years.

In 1963, the bank purchased Goodwood Park Hotel in Singapore for S$4.8 million.

From 1964 to 1965, Khoo was a senator in the Malaysian parliament.

In 1965, Khoo was ousted from Maybank by the Malaysian government under Deputy Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak on the pretext of pumping the bank&#x27;s money into his own private firm in Singapore.

In 1968, Khoo bought over Maybank&#x27;s Singapore properties, including Goodwood Park Hotel and Central Properties, for S$50 million. While bitter with what the Malaysian government did, Khoo retained his Malaysian citizenship.

In 1976, he ceased to be a director of Maybank. Though he had opened the national bank of Brunei in the 1960s, his search for a legitimate banking vehicle continued.

In 1981, Khoo bought Australia&#x27;s Southern Pacific Hotel Corporation – parent of the Travelodge chain – using funds from the National Bank of Brunei. He sold it in 1988 as part of his asset liquidation process to make restitution to the Bruneian government.

After the death of the former Sultan Omar in 1986, Sultan Hassanal arranged for an investigation into the finances of the National Bank, leading to its closure. Khoo had allegedly taken unsecured and undocumented loans of more than £300 million from the bank. He was never charged, but his son Khoo Ban Hock served two years in prison for his role in the affair.

In 1986, an opportunity arose when as a white knight, Khoo made a dramatic acquisition of a 5% stake in the British bank Standard Chartered, being one of three financiers who came to the rescue of Standard Chartered to stave off a hostile takeover by Lloyds Bank. He subsequently grew his stake to almost 15% to become the single largest shareholder.

In 1990, Khoo made a contribution of S$10 million to the Singapore government&#x27;s 25th anniversary charity fund – to help children, the elderly and the disabled. He was listed as Singapore&#x27;s richest businessman by the business magazine &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2003.

In 2004, after Khoo died at Mount Elizabeth Hospital from a heart attack, it was revealed that he has a bigger stake in three of his listed companies Goodwood Park, Hotel Malaysia and Central Properties than it was disclosed to the Singapore Exchange. His daughters, Jacqueline and Elizabeth, who were in management positions at the companies, were fined a total of S$500,000. Khoo left his Standard Chartered stake, then approximately 11.5%, to his children.

In March 2006, they sold it to Singapore&#x27;s Temasek Holdings.

==Philanthropy==
In 1981, Khoo set up the Khoo Foundation, a charity fund, with an initial S$20 million. The foundation donated S$125 million towards the construction and operation of a hospital, Alexandra hospital @ Yishun, in Yishun, Singapore. In 2007, the hospital was subsequently renamed after Khoo as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in recognition of the contribution by the Khoo foundation.

<text>Reinhard Mohn (29 June 1921 – 3 October 2009) was a German billionaire businessman and philanthropist. Under his leadership, Bertelsmann, once a medium-sized printing and publishing house, established in 1835, developed into a global media conglomerate. In 1977, he founded the non-profit Bertelsmann Stiftung, which is today one of the largest foundations in Germany, with worldwide reach.

Mohn received numerous domestic and international awards, including the Knight Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, and Spain&#x27;s Prince of Asturias Award.

== Life ==
=== Background ===
Born in 1921 as the fifth child of Agnes Mohn (née Seippel) and , Reinhard represented the fifth generation of the shareholding families of Bertelsmann. In 1887, his grandfather, , had taken over the management of the printing and publishing house from his father-in-law, , son of Carl Bertelsmann.

Raised in a strict Protestant family, Mohn earned his German baccalaureate (Abitur) at the Evangelisch Stiftische Gymnasium Gütersloh in 1939 and went on to complete his Reichsarbeitsdienst, the official labor service of the Third Reich. Afterwards, he volunteered for military service with the Luftwaffe, originally with the aim of becoming a pilot. After serving in an air-base command on the Western Front, Mohn was stationed with an anti-aircraft unit, advancing in rank from private to sergeant, and in 1942 achieving the rank of lieutenant. From France, via Italy, his regiment was moved to Tunisia. On 5 May 1943, Mohn became a U.S. prisoner of war, and in mid-June, he was taken across the Atlantic to Camp Concordia, an internment center in Kansas for German prisoners of war. According to Mohn&#x27;s accounts, he was profoundly influenced by this experience; as one example, he began reading American management literature for the first time.

In January 1946, Reinhard Mohn returned to Gütersloh. His oldest brother, Hans Heinrich Mohn, had died in 1939, and Sigbert Mohn, his second-oldest brother, was still a prisoner of war. Reinhard initially took an apprenticeship as a bookseller, and later joined his father&#x27;s business. His father, Heinrich Mohn, had come under the scrutiny of British occupation authorities because he was a supporting member of the SS, because he had donated to other Nazi organizations, and for other reasons. In April 1947, Heinrich Mohn transferred his publishing license to his son Reinhard, who managed the publishing business from then on.

=== Family ===
In 1948, Mohn married Magdalene Raßfeld, whom he knew from his school days. The couple had three children: Johannes, Susanne and Christiane; they divorced in 1982. Later that year, Mohn married Elisabeth Scholz, with whom he had had an affair since the 1950s and fathered three children in the 1960s. After the wedding, Mohn adopted their three mutual children: Brigitte, Christoph and Andreas.

== Career ==
=== Bertelsmann ===
In 1947, Mohn took over the management of the C. Bertelsmann publishing company, which had been largely destroyed by bombing raids during World War II. In 1950, he established the book club, which formed the basis for the fast growth of the company in the decades that followed. From the beginning, he closely involved employees, e.g. through the loan participation program introduced in 1951. In 1969, he launched an employee profit-sharing model, viewed as exemplary throughout Germany. As a businessman, Mohn was consistent in his efforts to grow the traditional publishing business into a media conglomerate: Thus, he entered music and film production, invested in the magazine business, and promoted international expansion. A merger of Bertelsmann with the Axel Springer group planned in the years 1969/70 did not come to fruition.

In 1971, Mohn transformed the family company into a joint stock corporation. In this way, he created another structural prerequisite for Bertelsmann&#x27;s rise to one of the world&#x27;s leading media groups. Mohn became chairman of the executive board, and in this position continued a corporate culture based on partnership, the essential component of which involves dialogue between management and employees. In 1976, he had a new corporate headquarters built, where Bertelsmann&#x27;s home offices are still located today. During this time, Mohn also began an entry into the U.S. publishing business, of vital importance to Bertelsmann. The acquisition of Bantam Books (1977/1980) and Doubleday (1986) created the largest trade-book publishing group in the United States, at the time.

In 1981, Mohn moved from the executive board to the supervisory board, which he chaired for another ten years, still remaining involved in business operations. At 70, he finally stepped down from his duties, and remained honorary chairman of the supervisory board. From then on, he dedicated his efforts primarily to the Bertelsmann Stiftung foundation. In 1999, Mohn transferred his sole control over the voting rights of roughly 90% of Bertelsmann shares to the Bertelsmann Verwaltungsgesellschaft, a move designed to ensure the continuity of his company.

=== Bertelsmann Stiftung ===
In 1977, Mohn established the non-profit Bertelsmann Stiftung, initially endowed with capital of 100,000 Deutsche Mark. Mohn supported the management-driven concept of an operating foundation, independently developing and managing projects. He directed the Bertelsmann Stiftung to help fund the improvement of the and established the Carl Bertelsmann Prize (today the Reinhard Mohn Prize).

In the 1980s, the Bertelsmann Stiftung became the key focus of Mohn&#x27;s corporate citizenship activities. In 1993, the majority of shareholdings in Bertelsmann was transferred to the foundation, making the Bertelsmann Stiftung the largest shareholder in the group. Capital shares and voting rights were strictly separated in the gift agreement, so that neither the foundation nor the group can exert any significant controlling influence over the other.

Mohn massively increased the Bertelsmann Stiftung&#x27;s budget in the 1990s. In addition to projects in Germany, he supported projects in Spain, such as the Fundació Biblioteca d&#x27;Alcúdia Can Torró on Mallorca. In 1995, he founded the , now based in Barcelona and Madrid, as an independent subsidiary foundation that works to promote dual training to reduce youth unemployment. Founded in 2008, the Bertelsmann Foundation North America, headquartered in Washington, D.C., deals with transatlantic cooperation, among other issues.

In the early years, the founder was the sole Executive Board member of the Bertelsmann Stiftung. In 1979, a managing director was hired; from 1983, Mohn was supported by an Advisory Board, and in 1993, the Executive Board was also expanded. After 1998, Mohn withdrew from executive management: Initially, he stepped down from his position as Chairman of the Executive Board, and a year later also withdrew as the Chairman of the Advisory Board. As a result of several structural and personnel changes, Mohn held the interim chairmanship of both Bertelsmann Stiftung executive bodies again from the end of 2000 until mid-2001, when he was succeeded by Gunter Thielen as Chairman of the Executive Board. In 2004, he permanently stepped down from the Executive Board of the Bertelsmann Stiftung, but as the founder, according to the statutes, he remained a member of the Board of Trustees until he died in 2009.

== Published works ==
From the late 1980s on, Reinhard Mohn was also involved in journalistic activities as an essayist and nonfiction book author. He wrote several books and magazine articles in which he dealt with topics concerning society and business. In 1985, he published an essay on &quot;Vanity in the Life of the Executive&quot;, in which he decried the archetype of a self-centered managerial class. With his statements on this topic, Mohn&#x27;s perspectives repeatedly drew controversy. In 1986, with the worldwide publication of his book &quot;Success through Partnership&quot;, he laid out the principles of corporate culture at Bertelsmann. In &quot;Humanity Wins&quot;, published in 2000, he strongly advocated an executive style in a spirit of partnership as a paradigm of a modern organizational structure. &quot;An Age of New Possibilities&quot; from 2001, defined a regulatory framework, which at its core is defined by entrepreneurship. In 2008, his last work was published as &quot;A Global Lesson&quot;, in which Mohn provided an autobiographical account of the formative elements of his own life. It was written with author , who also wrote the script to the film &quot;Es müssen mehr Köpfe ans Denken kommen&quot; (More minds need to start thinking) from Roland Suso Richter. This film was the gift from the Bertelsmann Executive Board to Mohn on his 85th birthday in 2006.

== Miscellaneous ==
In 1991, on the 70th birthday of Reinhard Mohn, the Bertelsmann Executive Board established a Reinhard Mohn Endowed Chair for Corporate Governance, Business Ethics and Social Evolution at the private University of Witten/Herdecke.

In 2006, Mohn created the , an eponymous foundation bearing his name, which has been run since 2010 by his son, Christoph Mohn. After the senior Mohn&#x27;s death, the foundation gained shareholdings in Bertelsmann, which Reinhard Mohn had held via an intermediary company.

In 2010, the University of Witten/Herdecke honored Mohn by establishing an Institute for Corporate Management and Corporate Governance, today known as the Reinhard Mohn Institute of Management. It also houses the Reinhard Mohn Chair of Management, endowed in 1991, and two professorships, one for strategy and organization and one for research.

In 2011, the Bertelsmann Stiftung awarded the first Reinhard Mohn Prize, which upholds and advances the tradition of the Carl Bertelsmann Prize. This award honors internationally renowned individuals for forward-looking solutions to societal and political challenges.

== Criticism ==
Mohn was criticized for how he dealt with the National Socialist past of Bertelsmann. After questions arose in the 1990s as to the company&#x27;s role in the Third Reich, Bertelsmann, with the support of Mohn, established an independent historical commission, seeking to come to terms with its involvement in the Nazi era. The commission presented its final report in 2002 and found that the decades-long account of its alleged involvement in a publishing company for the resistance could not be substantiated. On the contrary, Bertelsmann was the largest book producer for the Wehrmacht.

In 2010, author and journalist criticized a &quot;tax-saving interrelationship&quot; between Bertelsmann and the foundation Bertelsmann Stiftung. The structures set up by Mohn were alleged to have saved his family billions in inheritance tax. However, this tax would not have been owed, according to the prevailing legal view at that time.

In March 2022 Lisin called for a peaceful resolution in a letter to staff at NLMK, writing that &quot;Lost lives are always a huge tragedy that is impossible to justify. I am convinced that peaceful diplomatic conflict resolution is always preferable to the use of force.&quot; However, in September 2022 it was claimed that NLMK had supplied materials to Russian firms involved in nuclear weapon development, and that tankers owned by Lisin had participated in evading EU sanctions by trans-shipping oil at sea to EU-registered vessels. In October 2022 the US was urged to sanction Lisin. Lisin and NLMK responded, as was cited by The Times, RFE/RL and other outlets, with the following: &quot;The Russian operations of NLMK are not capable of producing steel intended for military applications. Our operations focus solely on producing rolled strip steel intended for general civilian use. NLMK has never supplied military intended products to the Russian military-industrial complex. That said, NLMK cannot control end uses of its civilian products&quot;. As for vessels, the company sold them off as unprofitable in September 2022, according to Kommersant.

<text>Milcho Leviev ( ; December 19, 1937 – October 12, 2019) was a Bulgarian composer, arranger, and jazz pianist. Leviev was born in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, into a Bulgarian Jewish family; his father was Izak Leviev and his brother was the artist Yoan Leviev.

==Career==
Leviev graduated from the Bulgarian State Academy of Music in 1960, majoring in composition under Pancho Vladigerov and in piano under Andrei Stoyanov. 

His professional development as a composer began at the Drama Theatre in Plovdiv. After Emil Georgiev left office, Leviev was appointed conductor of the Bulgarian National Radio big band (1962–66). His ideas were innovative in the orchestra; pieces like &quot;Studia&quot;, &quot;Blues in 9&quot; or &quot;Anti-waltz&quot; combined folklore and jazz. He worked as soloist and conductor of the Sofia and Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestra from 1963-1968. In 1965, embracing the idea of the writer Radoy Ralin, he founded Jazz Focus &#x27;65 with which he toured until 1970, achieving success for Bulgarian jazz and winning prizes at jazz festivals in Montreux, Sofia, and Prague. In 1970, he left Bulgaria and moved to Los Angeles. He performed again in Bulgaria in the early 1980s.

Leviev worked as composer, arranger, and pianist for the Don Ellis Orchestra (1970–1975) and the Billy Cobham Band (1971–77). He toured the U.S. and Europe and was music director for Lainie Kazan (1977–80). He gave concerts and recorded with John Klemmer, Art Pepper, and Roy Haynes. Leviev toured Europe with Pepper (1980–82) and was one of the founders of the fusion band Free Flight.

In 1983, Leviev became music director of the Jazz Sessions at the Comeback Inn in Venice, California. He gave concerts in Japan with bassist Dave Holland (1983–86) and organized solo jazz recitals in Europe (1985–86). He taught jazz composition at the University of Southern California and given master classes at the New Bulgarian University in Sofia. He composed symphony and chamber works, big band, and jazz orchestra music. In the 1960s, he wrote film music.

Leviev died on 12 October 2019 in Thessaloniki, Greece.

==Awards and honors==
As a student, he won second prize at the International Competition in Vienna for his Toccatina for piano. In 1987, he won the Drama-Logue Award for best music director given by the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts. Some of his works were published by Dick Grove Publications and the Bulgarian publishing house Nauka I Izkustvo (up to 1968). He won a prize at the National Jazz Educational Congress, a Grammy Award for arrangement, and the Honorary Gold Medal of the Académie internationale des Arts in Paris (1995). He was awarded an honorary Doctor Honoris Causa by the Academy of Music, Dance and Fine Arts in Plovdiv (1995) and by the New Bulgarian University.

<text>Jean-Claude Decaux (15 September 1937 – 27 May 2016) was a French businessman and founder of advertising company JCDecaux. The company is now run by his sons, Jean-François Decaux and Jean-Charles Decaux.

==Personal life==
Jean-Claude Decaux was the son of a shoe salesman in Beauvais, France.

He was married with three children and lived in Paris.

He died on 27 May 2016 aged 78.

==Career==
At the age of 18, inspired by an argument with his father over the family shoe store&#x27;s window display, Jean-Claude started a business creating billboards along French roadways. In 1963, legislation in France placed restrictions on billboard use which forced Decaux out of business. He founded JCDecaux in 1964. He made a deal with the city of Lyon, proposing that he would build bus shelters and keep them clean in exchange for advertising space there. The company quickly expanded to other cities.

In 1980, Decaux personally designed the Sanisette public toilet, a self-cleaning public toilet, as a replacement for the pissoirs of Paris.

In January 2015, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, he had a net worth of $6.2 billion.

<text>The Portland Observatory is a historic maritime signal tower at 138 Congress Street in the Munjoy Hill section of Portland, Maine. Built in 1807, it is the only known surviving tower of its type in the United States. Using both a telescope and signal flags, two-way communication between ship and shore was possible several hours before an incoming vessel reached the docks. The tower was designated a National Historic Landmark and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 2006; it is now managed by Greater Portland Landmarks, a local historic preservation nonprofit. It is open to the public as a museum.

==Geography==
Portland has a deep harbor sheltered by numerous islands. Ships entering the harbor are not directly visible from the wharfs, which created problems for merchants trying to prepare for the arrival of cargoes. This problem was solved in 1807 when Captain Lemuel Moody organized the construction of an observatory on Portland&#x27;s Munjoy Hill, visible from both the open ocean and the wharfs. During the War of 1812, the observatory was used as a watch tower.

==About the observatory==
The 86-foot (26 m) tall observatory (7 stories) is octagonal (to lessen wind pressure on each side) and lighthouse-shaped, with a fieldstone base of heavy loose rocks, and stands 222 feet (68 m) above sea level. There is no basement but the rock ballast in the bottom floor and octagonal design have kept the structure steady during storms. The observatory&#x27;s &#x27;lantern&#x27; (cupola) included a P &amp; J Dollond Achromatic Refracting Telescope, which could identify ships 30 miles (48 km) to sea. That telescope disappeared from the observatory in 1939.

The observatory has been renovated numerous times over the years, including a Works Progress Administration renovation in 1939. It was most recently renovated from 1998–2000 to repair damage from moisture and powderpost beetles. This renovation won a 2001 National Preservation Honor Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The center column was not an original feature, and was added in the 1939 renovation. In 2014 additional repairs to the windows and shingles were underway.

The observatory was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. In 2006, the observatory was made a National Historic Landmark and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.

===Past operation===
The Portland Observatory is the only remaining maritime signal station in the United States. Tower operations were paid with annual fees collected from shipping merchants, who purchased the right to have their flags stored in the building and hoisted up its flagstaffs when their ships were sighted. A telephone was eventually installed, extending the tower&#x27;s function until 1923, when the reliability of engine powered vessels and communication by radio made it obsolete.

In 1937 the tower was turned over to the city. Between the time of its closure and the 1990s, the building was often unlocked and popular among area children. Some older area residents have fond memories of playing in the building and the initials some of them carved into the wood are still visible. The latest major restoration left as much of the original wood as possible in place. This is distinguished by its dark stain while the replacement wood was left its original lighter color.

===Current operation===
Greater Portland Landmarks, a non-profit organization, maintains the building. Guided tours with discussion about the history of the building and the neighborhood are provided by volunteer docents from Memorial Day to Columbus Day for a small fee. On very clear days the view from the cupola&#x27;s balcony extends from the seaward horizon as far inland as Mount Washington.

<doc id="1324514" wikidata="Q251751" url="?curid=1324514" title="Michele Ferrero">
<text>Michele Ferrero (; 26 April 1925 – 14 February 2015) was an Italian billionaire businessman. He owned the chocolate manufacturer Ferrero SpA, Europe&#x27;s second-largest confectionery company (at the time of his death), which he developed from the small bakery and café of his father in Alba, Piedmont. His first big success was his work with Francesco Rivella in adding vegetable oil to the traditional &quot;gianduja&quot; paste to make the popular spread Nutella.

==Early life==
Michele Ferrero was born on 26 April 1925 in Dogliani, the only child of Pietro Ferrero, who founded the Ferrero company, and his wife Piera Cillario.

==Career==
Ferrero joined the firm in 1949.

He was the richest person in Italy, with a personal wealth of $26 billion surpassing Silvio Berlusconi in March 2008. In May 2014, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index listed Ferrero as the 20th richest person in the world.

Ferrero&#x27;s brands include Nutella, Mon Chéri, Kinder Chocolate, Ferrero Rocher, Tic Tacs and Kinder Eggs.

From 1997, his sons, Giovanni Ferrero and Pietro Ferrero, co-led the company. After Pietro died on 18 April 2011, of a heart attack while cycling in South Africa, Giovanni became the sole CEO.

==Personal life and death==
Ferrero married in 1962, and they had two sons together, Giovanni Ferrero and Pietro Ferrero Jr.

He was a fervent Catholic. Ferrero visited the Lourdes shrine annually, and had a Madonna placed in every factory and office. At the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of his company, he said: &quot;The success of Ferrero we owe to Our Lady of Lourdes; without her we can do little.&quot;

Ferrero died on 14 February 2015, at his home in Monte Carlo, Monaco, after a long illness. He was 89.

<doc id="1324517" wikidata="Q7581447" url="?curid=1324517" title="Sprung (video game)">
<text>Sprung is a video game for the Nintendo DS. It was released in North America on December 7, 2004 as one of the launch titles for the system. In Europe, the game was released under the expanded title Sprung: The Dating Game. &quot;Sprung&quot; puts players in the shoes of either Becky or Brett in a conversation-based adventure game and dating sim that mostly consists of dialogue. &quot;Sprung&quot; can also be regarded as a visual novel, though the game&#x27;s level of interactivity makes it unique for its kind. The game was one of the first dating simulation games to have a wide commercial release in North America.

The character treatments and overall plot in &quot;Sprung&quot; were conceived by Colleen McGuinness, who was the lead writer for the project. Upon release, the game received mixed reviews for its gameplay, but was praised for its comedic writing. It was noted as a unique release for its time and for pushing &quot;the limits of the Teen rating&quot;. The working title for &quot;Sprung&quot; was Crush. Two spin-off mobile games were later released featuring characters from &quot;Sprung&quot;; &quot;Love Triangle: Dating Challenge&quot; was released in 2005 followed by &quot;Heartbreakers&quot; in 2006.

==Gameplay==
There are two distinct narratives in the game which allow the player to play as either Brett or Becky. Both stories take place at the same locations, but under different continuities. The game is split up by different &quot;scenes&quot; that contain a narrative consisting of dialogue, similar to a script of an episode of a sitcom. Each scene gives the player an objective to complete. During a scene, the player will appear on the bottom screen of the Nintendo DS and the person they are talking to will appear on the top. With nearly every interaction with characters within a scene, the player is given the option from a list of responses on how to respond. Different situations will require the player to use their wit and charm, in addition to a wide variety of collectible items, to progress through the scene. Many of the items can be used at will on any character; using the pepper spray and gasoline items will often end up with the player getting arrested or committed depending on their actions. There are multiple locations in the game, all of which feature their own theme music that is influenced melodically by how characters react to choices.

Bonus scenes are unlocked through the collection of &quot;golden lines&quot;, which are quotes that are deemed the most witty or absurd conversational options. Additional art pieces can be unlocked through the collection of various items throughout the game.

==Plot==
Becky and Brett&#x27;s narratives establish them as having been friends since childhood. They go on a trip to a ski resort as an attempt to find love, have fun, and seek new work opportunities. Brett is torn between his long-standing crush on Becky and desire to explore his options and play the field. Brett tries to navigate love on the mountain with a zany cast of eligible bachelorettes while helping his close friends Danny and Lucas with their own mischief. Along the way, he has to deal with Elliot and Conor, two pretentious men who are richer, more charming, and more famous than him. Brett&#x27;s story culminates with a competition with Conor where the prize is the chance to take one of three girls on a dream vacation.

In Becky&#x27;s story, she uses the vacation as an escape from her recent ex-boyfriend Sean only to have him arrive at the same time. Her story gives the player the option of a split path in the careers of waitressing or modeling, which results in different scenes becoming available. Becky&#x27;s story involves maintaining her relationships with her childhood friends - the promiscuous Kiki and the geeky Erica, among new friends that can help or hinder her situation based on their motives. The player also guides Becky in advancing her career path, finding love while on the mountain, and getting revenge on her ex-boyfriend.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Sprung&quot; received &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot; according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Praise was given for the game&#x27;s comedic writing, with &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; calling the game &quot;bizarrely fun&quot; and writing &quot;only someone who hates comedy could dislike this game.&quot; &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; called it &quot;always entertaining and occasionally hilarious.&quot; &quot;Sprung&quot;&#x27;s subject matter was also applauded by critics, with &quot;GameSpot&quot; calling it a &quot;bold move&quot;, praising the developers for a &quot;willingness to tread some risqué ground which most games tend to sidestep.&quot; &quot;DS Central&quot; noted that &quot;Sprung&quot; &quot;takes extremely adult themes and moulds them into a light hearted, thoroughly fantastic mess.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; described the game as pushing &quot;the limits of the Teen rating&quot; and highlighted the &quot;hint at homosexual and bisexual encounters in several of the game&#x27;s dating missions.&quot;

The game&#x27;s dialogue-based gameplay received mixed reviews. Some reviewers compared it to a choose your own adventure novel. &quot;Game Informer&quot; noted: &quot;There&#x27;s good humor and writing to be had here, but it&#x27;s not so much a game as an interactive comic.&quot; &quot;eToychest&quot; called &quot;Sprung&quot; &quot;surprisingly addictive&quot; and described it as &quot;amusing and well-written&quot; but remarked that the gameplay could &quot;alienate some gamers who do not have an affinity for games whose primary game mechanic is based around retention.&quot; In a mixed review, &quot;GameSpot&quot; described the gameplay as &quot;frustrating&quot; but the art as &quot;fairly smooth and effective.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; also praised the game&#x27;s animation, calling it &quot;incredibly well done, almost feature film quality&quot;. The game was criticized for its minimal use of the Nintendo DS&#x27;s touch screen.

&quot;Sprung&quot;&#x27;s wide array of collectible items (notably pepper spray) and the ability to use them on any character was praised by reviewers, though &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote that the feature was not implemented frequently enough. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; wrote that &quot;using pepper spray suddenly and for no reason usually creates some prime comedy&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot; recommended &quot;trying the pepper spray at least once, since it&#x27;s fun to blind people and get arrested&quot;. 

In the years following its release, &quot;Sprung&quot; has been looked back on in a more positive light. In a retrospective review, &quot;Sprung&quot; was again praised for its writing and humor by &quot;Rice Digital&quot;. The publication described the game as a &quot;movie plot turned interactive&quot; and a unique release for its time. In 2021, &quot;TheGamer&quot; described &quot;Sprung&quot; as a &quot;hidden gem&quot; and an &quot;excellent game&quot;.

<text>Lester Crown (born June 7, 1925) is an American businessman and is the son of Chicago financier Henry Crown (died 1990), who created the Material Service Corporation with two brothers in 1919, which merged with General Dynamics in 1959.

Crown has been a perennial member of the Forbes 400 list since 1982. He controls family holdings, including large stakes in Maytag, Hilton Hotels, Alltel, Aspen Skiing Company, New York&#x27;s Rockefeller Center, and pro basketball&#x27;s Chicago Bulls. He also holds a 13% stake in the New York Yankees, an increase from 10% when he was an original limited partner with George Steinbrenner&#x27;s investment group in 1973. Presumably, the large stake held in Bank One at the time of the 2003 Forbes 400 listing has converted to JPMorgan Chase stock and was derived from an interest in First Chicago Bank, which was enumerated in the 1998 Forbes 400 list as First Chicago NBD shares. Recent achievements include brokering a controversial agreement to expand O&#x27;Hare International Airport, and spearheading the funding of the new Cook County Hospital (Stroger Hospital).

Affiliations include: Trusteeship of Northwestern University, the Aspen Institute and the Michael Reese Health Trust. Crown is on the Board of Directors of Lyric Opera and Children&#x27;s Memorial Hospital, and the America Abroad Media advisory board. He is a member of Lake Shore Country Club, Northmoor Country Club, Standard Club, Economic Club of Chicago, and Northwestern University&#x27;s John Evans Club. He is a Deputy Chair of the International Board of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and a member of the Tel Aviv University&#x27;s Board of Governors. Crown is also involved with The Crown Center for Middle East Studies at Brandeis University. He donated the initial $10 million gift that started the center in 2005. He and the rest of his family are involved with the Crown Fellows program in American history at Brandeis, as well.

==Political views==
In a 2008 letter to voters Crown expressed his support for Barack Obama, the Democratic Presidential Candidate:

While my involvement in politics is motivated by a variety of issues, there is one issue that is fundamental: My deep commitment to Israel and to a strong U.S.-Israel relationship that strengthens both Israel&#x27;s security and its efforts to seek peace,&quot; Crown wrote. &quot;I am writing to share with you my confidence that Senator Barack Obama&#x27;s stellar record on Israel gives me great comfort that, as President, he will be the friend to Israel that we all want to see in the White House - stalwart in his defense of Israel&#x27;s security, and committed to helping Israel achieve peace with its neighbors.&quot;

In April 2013 Crown was one of 100 prominent American Jews who signed a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging him to &quot;work closely&quot; with Secretary of State John Kerry &quot;to devise pragmatic initiatives, consistent with Israel&#x27;s security needs, which would represent Israel&#x27;s readiness to make painful territorial sacrifices for the sake of peace.&quot;

== Awards ==
Crown received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1989. He was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1999 in the area of Business and Social Service. Crown, alongside his wife, received the Blessed are the Peacemakers Award from Catholic Theological Union in 2012.

==Personal life==
In 1950, he married Renée Schine. His wife is the sister of producer G. David Schine and daughter of theater and hotel magnate, Junius Myer Schine. They have seven children: A. Steven Crown, James Crown, Patricia Crown, Susan Crown Kunkler, Daniel Crown, Sara Crown Star, and Janet Crown Peterson.

Their son James (1953-2023) succeeded him as the President and Chairman of Henry Crown &amp; Co. A daughter, Janet, is founder and owner of Burn 60 Fitness Studios and is divorced from celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson. Among his seven children are board members of several major cultural institutions. Another daughter, Susan, is chairwoman of the Shoah Foundation. Together the family&#x27;s net worth exceeds ten billion dollars, as of December 2020.

<text>The flag of Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) changed with political developments in the country. At independence in 1965 the recently adopted flag of Southern Rhodesia was used, until a new flag (the green and white triband) was adopted in 1968. The 1968 flag remained in use following the declaration of the republic in 1970 and thus is associated with the end of the crown in Rhodesia. It was also initially the flag of Zimbabwe Rhodesia until a new flag was adopted in September 1979.

==History==

Between the late 1920s and 1953, the then Colony of Southern Rhodesia followed British colonial practice, by using a Blue Ensign with the Union Flag in the canton and the shield from the colony&#x27;s coat of arms in the fly.

In 1953, Southern Rhodesia federated with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland to form the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The federal flag was used between September 1953 until 31 December 1963 when the federation was dissolved. Less than a year after the break-up of the Federation, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland became the independent states of Zambia and Malawi respectively. Southern Rhodesia became known simply as Rhodesia, although its legal name remained the Colony of Southern Rhodesia. In April 1964 Rhodesia adopted a light Royal Air Force blue ensign with the shield from the coat of arms of Rhodesia in the fly. This was the first time the lighter shade of blue ensign was used by a British colony, although Fiji and Tuvalu both subsequently adopted national flags based on the light blue ensign.

Following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) on 11 November 1965, the flag was retained, but three years later on the anniversary of UDI it was replaced by a green and white flag (similar to that of Nigeria) with the full coat of arms in the centre. On 2 March 1970, the country declared itself a republic but there was no change to the flag.

Prior to its closure, the Rhodesian mission in London flew the newly adopted flag in a provocative gesture, as the Commonwealth Prime Ministers arrived for their Conference. This was considered illegal by the Foreign Office, and prompted calls by Labour MP Willie Hamilton, who condemned it as &quot;the flag of an illegal Government in rebellion against the Crown&quot;, for its removal.

Throughout this time, the UK refused to recognise Rhodesia&#x27;s independence and maintained that the dark-blue ensign remained the official flag of the country, but in 1972, the Rhodesian Olympic team raised the earlier pre-1953 dark Blue Ensign at the Olympic Village in Munich, while &quot;God Save The Queen&quot; was played. This was before its expulsion from the International Olympic Committee, four days before the opening of the 1972 Summer Olympics.

In 1979, the country became known as Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, although not legally, and a new flag was adopted on 4 September that year featuring the pan-African colours of red, black, yellow and green, and the Zimbabwe Bird. However, under the terms of the Lancaster House Agreement, the country briefly returned to British rule under the Union Jack from 12 December 1979 although the Zimbabwe Rhodesia flag remained &quot;de facto&quot; in use. Thus it was the British Union Flag that was lowered during the ceremony on 17/18 April 1980 marking the country&#x27;s attainment of independence as the Republic of Zimbabwe when the new flag of Zimbabwe was adopted.

==Official description==

The following was published as a supplement to the Government Gazette issued on Friday 9 August 1968.

1968 Flag of Rhodesia No. 40 / p. 285&lt;br&gt;
Rhodesia Act&lt;br&gt;
To provide for the adoption of a national flag for Rhodesia; to provide for the making of regulations to restrict or control the application to any goods of a reproduction of such flag; to amend section 16 of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1957, and to provide for matters incidental to the foregoing.
&lt;br&gt;
BE IT ENACTED by His Excellency the Officer Administering Government as representative of the Queen&#x27;s Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Parliament of Rhodesia, as follows: -&lt;br&gt;
1. This Act may be cited as the Flag of Rhodesia Act, 1968.&lt;br&gt;
2. The Flag of Rhodesia shall be a flag consisting of three vertical stripes of equal width, green, white and green, on which there appears in the centre of the white stripe the coat of arms of Rhodesia, with -&lt;br&gt;
(a) the length of the flag equal to twice the width of the flag; and&lt;br&gt;
(b) the coat of arms of Rhodesia equal in height to three-fifths of the heights of the flag.&lt;br&gt;
3. The Minister of Justice shall cause a copy of the Flag of Rhodesia to be prepared and deposited in the National Archives of Rhodesia established in terms of the National Archives Act, 1963 (No. 76 of 1963).&lt;br&gt;

==Flag of the governor of Southern Rhodesia==

The first flag used by the governor of Southern Rhodesia followed the usual pattern for representatives of the British Crown. It consisted of a defaced Union Flag (Union Jack) with a white disc in the center of the flag. Within the centre of the disc was the shield from the Southern Rhodesian Coat of Arms.

In common with most other British colonies, the flag used by the governor, as the Sovereign&#x27;s representative in Southern Rhodesia, initially flew a Union Flag with a white roundel in the centre, charged with the shield from the colony&#x27;s arms granted on 11 August 1924. Unique among the flags of the governors of British Colonies, this shield of Arms was not surrounded by the customary wreath presumably because Southern Rhodesia was not a full dominion. Southern Rhodesia became a British Colony on 12 September 1923. This flag was put into use on 1 October 1924 and was flown until 30 July 1951.

On 31 July 1951, a new flag was put into use for the governor of Southern Rhodesia. This was dark blue and charged in the centre with a Royal Crown, its height being four-sevenths of the hoist. Initially the Tudor Crown would have been used, but after her accession to the throne in 1952, Queen Elizabeth II indicated her preference for the St Edward&#x27;s Crown and this version would have been used thereafter. Although the colony had attained &#x27;Responsible Government&#x27; in 1923, it was never a fully fledged Dominion, and so did not have a Governor-General, whose flag in other Dominions would be dark blue, charged in the centre with the Royal Crest above a Crown, with the name of the Dominion written in a yellow scroll below.

==Flag of Zimbabwe Rhodesia==
When Rhodesia became Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, a new flag was adopted with more African elements on 2 September of that year. This flag was, however, short-lived, as the self-declared state soon reverted to British rule before gaining independence as Zimbabwe in 1980.

==Modern use==
The Rhodesian flag has been used since the 2010s by various racist, alt-right and white supremacist groups. Dylann Roof posted a manifesto onto a website named &quot;The Last Rhodesian&quot;, before carrying out mass-murder of nine African-Americans in the 2015 Charleston church shooting; he also wore a jacket with a Rhodesian flag patch on it, as well as the flag of apartheid South Africa. According to a &quot;Vox&quot; article, Roof and others see Rhodesia as &quot;proof that countries are better off when white people run them. […] The lesson of Rhodesia, for white supremacists, is that black people are a threat to a healthy white-run society. And they need to be kept down.&quot;

In an article for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writer John Ismay noted that the flag&#x27;s popularity among the alt-right stems from its lack of recognizability compared to other white supremacist symbols. Ismay stated that &quot;If such symbols and slogans, for a North American audience, lack the instant shock effect of a Confederate or Nazi flag, that is part of the point,&quot; noting how alt-right online storefront Commissar Clothing describes Rhodesian imagery as &quot;inside jokes and references that the general public will not understand.&quot; Other commenters note that most Rhodesian exile groups reject these fringe uses.

<text>are Japanese mountain ascetic hermits. They are generally part of the syncretic religion, which includes Tantric Buddhism and Shinto.

Their origins can be traced back to the solitary Yama-bito and some (saints or holy persons) of the eighth and ninth centuries.

== Clothing and items ==

The Yamabushi usually wear and bring the following clothes and items with them:
* Yuigesa (), a harness or sash adorned with pom-poms
* Kyahan (), sandals made from straw
* Tokin () which is a small hat-like adornment worn at the front of the head

<text>Johnny Lane Oates (January 21, 1946 – December 24, 2004) was an American professional baseball player, coach, and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a catcher for the Baltimore Orioles, Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, and New York Yankees from to . During his playing career, Oates was a light-hitting player who was valued for his defensive skills and played most of his career as a reserve player. It was as a big league manager that Oates experienced his greatest success, when, under his leadership, the Texas Rangers won three American League Western Division titles.

==Baseball playing career==

Born in Sylva, North Carolina, Oates graduated from Prince George High School in Prince George, Virginia, before going on to Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. He was selected by the Baltimore Orioles as their first round pick in the 1967 Major League Baseball Secondary Draft.

Oates began his professional baseball career with the Bluefield Orioles, then the Miami Marlins in 1967 at the age of 21. After two seasons with Miami, Oates moved up to the Dallas–Fort Worth Spurs in 1969, where he hit for a .288 batting average in 66 games. He continued his climb up the minor league ladder in 1970, playing for the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings before making his major league debut with the Baltimore Orioles at the age of 24 on September 17, 1970. Oates was not on the post-season roster for The Orioles that won the 1970 World Series. Oates returned to the minor leagues in 1971, playing another season with Rochester, where he posted a .277 batting average along with a respectable .364 on-base percentage.

Oates was brought back up to the Orioles for the 1972 season, where he caught the majority of the Orioles&#x27; games. His defensive skills became apparent as he led American League catchers with a .995 fielding percentage. In a transaction primarily driven by the Orioles&#x27; need for a power-hitting catcher, Oates was traded along with Davey Johnson, Pat Dobson and Roric Harrison to the Atlanta Braves for Earl Williams and Taylor Duncan on the last day of the Winter Meetings on December 1, 1972. Oates spent two seasons with the Braves, platooning alongside Paul Casanova, then Vic Correll, before being traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in May 1975.

Oates had been designated to platoon at catcher with Bob Boone for the 1976 season; however, in the season-opening game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he cracked his collar bone in a collision at home plate with Dave Parker and missed almost half the season. &quot;That play changed my career&quot;, he said afterwards. He returned to help the Phillies win the 1976 National League Eastern Division pennant. Oates had one plate appearance, as a pinch hitter, in the 1976 National League Championship Series as the Phillies lost to the eventual world champion Cincinnati Reds. After the season, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers on December 20, 1976.

With the Dodgers, Oates worked as a second-string catcher behind Steve Yeager and would once again reach the post-season as the Dodgers clinched the 1977 National League West title. The Dodgers went on to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1977 National League Championship Series before eventually losing to the New York Yankees in the 1977 World Series. In 1978, Oates appeared in only 40 games as the Dodgers repeated as Western Division champions and, once again defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1978 National League Championship Series. The 1978 World Series was also a repeat of the previous year, as the Dodgers once again lost to the Yankees in a six-game series. Oates&#x27; playing time decreased further in 1979, as he appeared in only 26 games before being released at the end of the season. He became a free agent and signed a contract to play for the New York Yankees on April 4, 1980. Oates served as a backup to Rick Cerone during the 1980 season before playing in his final game on May 24, 1981, at the age of 35.

==Managing==
Oates began managing in baseball in 1982. That year, he guided the New York Yankees&#x27; Double-A Nashville Sounds to the Southern League title. From 1984 to 1987, he worked as a coach for the Chicago Cubs and was credited with developing Jody Davis into a Gold Glove Award winning catcher. He rejoined the Orioles organization at their Rochester AAA affiliate in 1988. The following year, he was promoted to the majors where he worked as first base coach under Frank Robinson, and in 1991, after Robinson started 13–24, Oates was promoted to the manager of the Orioles. In his first full season with the team, Oates led the Orioles to an 89–73 record and then to an 85–77 record in 1993, which helped him to win &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Manager of the Year Award. However, following the strike-shortened 1994 season, Oates was dismissed by new owner Peter Angelos. He finished his Orioles managerial career with a record of 291 wins and 270 losses.

Oates was hired by the Texas Rangers, who had just fired their previous manager, Kevin Kennedy. Oates proceeded to lead the Rangers to their first playoff appearance in team history during the 1996 season. Despite the team&#x27;s poor ERA (the team averaged 4.65 collectively), the Rangers&#x27; batting lineup was incredibly potent, featuring Iván Rodríguez, Will Clark, Mark McLemore, Dean Palmer, Rusty Greer, Juan González, and Mickey Tettleton; the team finished 90–72. Oates won the 1996 American League Manager of the Year Award that year, sharing honors with the Yankees&#x27; Joe Torre.

Oates continued to lead the Rangers for several more seasons, leading them to American League West titles in 1998 and 1999. However, the Rangers would win just one playoff game in that span (winning Game 1 of the 1996 American League Division Series), and the latter two ALDS appearances saw the Rangers score only one run each time, all at the hands of the New York Yankees, who won the World Series in those respective years. Oates&#x27; record of 1–9 (.100) is the worst for any manager with multiple postseason appearances.

In a blowout game on September 6, 2000, Oates had Scott Sheldon play all nine positions in a single game, making him the third player in MLB history to do so. Oates told reporters &quot;After it got to be 10-1 … I thought it was the perfect night to do it.&quot;

Following a fourth-place finish in 2000 and beginning the 2001 season with an 11–17 record, Oates resigned as manager and third base coach Jerry Narron replaced him. Many fans, however, blamed Rangers management for the team&#x27;s woes, saying that team management placed unreasonable expectations on Oates, especially after spending $252 million on free agent shortstop Alex Rodriguez. He finished his Rangers managerial career with a record of 506 wins and 476 losses.

==Career statistics==

===Playing===
In an 11-year major league career, Oates played in 593 games, accumulating 410 hits in 1,637 at bats for a .250 career batting average along with 14 home runs, 126 runs batted in and a .309 on-base percentage. A good defensive player, he ended his career with a .987 fielding percentage.

===Managerial record===
==Honors==
Oates was named American League Manager of the Year in 1996 when he led the Rangers to their first playoff berth in franchise history, winning the American League West Division. He won the Sporting News American League Manager of the Year Award that year (and also when he was managing the Orioles in 1993).

His uniform number 26 was retired by the Rangers on August 5, 2005. It was only the second number retired by the Rangers, following the 34 of Nolan Ryan. During the 2005 season, a commemorative patch was worn on all Ranger uniforms and a sign was hung on the outfield wall in his honor. Prior to Game 3 of the 2010 American League Division Series against the Tampa Bay Rays, his eight-year-old grandson, Johnny Oates II, threw out the ceremonial first pitch.

Oates was posthumously inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame on August 7, 2010. That same year, Buck Showalter had honored his friend Oates by choosing the number &#x27;26&#x27; as he took over management of the Baltimore Orioles.

Oates was inducted into the Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame in 1983. He was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame (the state-wide organization) in 2003.

==Personal life==

Oates was considering returning to managing when he was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor, glioblastoma multiforme. Doctors gave Oates only about a year to live, but he survived for over three years—enough time to attend his daughter&#x27;s wedding, his grandchild&#x27;s birth, and his induction into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame at The Ballpark in Arlington. During the ceremony at The Ballpark, he was given a standing ovation as Oates, weakened by the cancer and its treatment, required the help of his wife Gloria and a cane to walk.

Oates died at age 58 at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center in Richmond on Christmas Eve 2004.

<text>Angel Raymond Wagenstein (; 17 October 1922 – 29 June 2023) was a Bulgarian screenwriter and author. Wagenstein was born in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, but spent his childhood in France where his Jewish family emigrated for political reasons due to their leftist politics.

Angel Wagenstein returned to Bulgaria due to an amnesty, and as a student at a lyceum, where he joined an anti-fascist group. He was interned in a labour camp for Jews in Macedonia, but escaped from it. After a combat mission, he was arrested and condemned to death in 1944, but the execution was first delayed by the Anglo-American bombing of Sofia, which destroyed parts of the prison and forced the relocation of the inmates to another facility, and then prevented by the anti-fascist (mostly Communist) takeover and the roughly simultaneous invasion of the Soviet Red Army.

After completing a degree in 1950 in film screenwriting at the S. A. Gerasimov All-Union State Institute for Cinematography in Moscow, he worked as a screenplay writer for the Bulgarian Cinematography Center and for the DEFA Film Studio (the former East Germany Cinematography Center). He is author of over fifty screenplays for films, documentaries and cartoons. He became famous with his movies about Bulgarian Communists, especially partisans.

His film &quot;Stars&quot;, shot in 1959 by German director Konrad Wolf, was awarded the Special Jury Prize at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival. In 1980, he was a member of the jury at the 30th Berlin International Film Festival.

His fiction includes the triptych Петокнижие Исааково (Isaac&#x27;s Torah), Далеч от Толедо (Far from Toledo) and Сбогом, Шанхай (Farewell, Shanghai), which have been published both separately and together not only in Bulgarian but also in French, German, Russian, English, Czech, Polish, Macedonian, Spanish, Italian and Hebrew. Far from Toledo was awarded in 2002 the Alberto Benveniste annual prize of the Sorbonne, while his novel Farewell Shanghai received the Jean Monnet Prize of European literature in 2004. The French government awarded Angel Wagenstein the high distinction of Chevalier of the French Order of Merit, and later Chevalier of Arts and Literature. He is also the bearer of the highest Bulgarian distinction – the Stara Planina Order. In 2009, he was made honorary citizen of the city of Plovdiv. A documentary film about his life, &quot;Angel Wagenstein: Art Is a Weapon&quot;, was produced by American director Andrea Simon in 2017 and won the Audience Award at the South East European Film Festival.

The East German movie &quot;Eolomea&quot; is based on one of his works.

Wagenstein was married to Zora, with whom he had two sons, Raymond and Plamen. He turned 100 in October 2022, and died on 29 June 2023.

<doc id="1324557" wikidata="Q3520200" url="?curid=1324557" title="Mutha River">
<text>The Mutha River is a river in western Maharashtra, India. It arises in the Western Ghats and flows eastward until it merges with the Mula River in the city of Pune. It has been dammed twice, first at the Panshet Dam (on the Ambi River), used as a source of drinking water and irrigation for Pune city. The water released here is dammed again at Khadakwasla and is an important source of drinking water for Pune. One more dam has been built later on the Mutha river at Temghar.

After merging with the Mula River in Pune, the Mutha flows on as the Mula-Mutha River to join the Bhima River.

In 2014, the Government of Maharashtra announced that the Pune Municipal Corporation would build new sewage treatment plants to ensure that no sewage was dumped in the river.

== Government documents, orders and court orders ==
The National Green Tribunal of India has the power to hear all cases relating to issues of the river under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. 
Considering the serious nature of encroachments on the Mutha river, the NGT in its latest order on 23 July 2019 ordered a committee to be formed to look into these issues. The committee will comprise (i) the Chief Engineer, Water Resources Department (Government of Maharashtra), (ii) the District Collector, Pune, (iii) the Member Secretary, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, (iv) the SEIAA, Maharashtra and (v) a Senior Scientist from the CPCB, Regional Office at Pune. The committee will decide the appropriate measures.

<doc id="1324564" wikidata="Q616484" url="?curid=1324564" title="Portuguese pavement">
<text>Portuguese pavement, known in Portuguese as calçada portuguesa or simply calçada (or pedra portuguesa in Brazil), is a traditional-style pavement used for many pedestrian areas in Portugal. It consists of small pieces of stone arranged in a pattern or image, like a mosaic. It can also be found in Olivença (a disputed territory administered by Spain) and throughout former Portuguese colonies, especially in Brazil. Portuguese workers are also hired for their skill in creating these pavements in places such as Gibraltar. Being usually used in sidewalks, it is in town squares and atriums that this art finds its deepest expression.

One of the most distinctive uses of this paving technique is the image of Saint-Queen Elizabeth of Portugal (Santa Rainha Isabel), in Coimbra, designed with black and white stones of basalt and limestone.

==History==

Paving as a craft is believed to have originated in Mesopotamia, where rocky materials were used in the inside and outside of constructions, being later brought to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.

The Romans used to pave the &quot;vias&quot; connecting the empire using materials to be found in the surroundings. Some of the Roman techniques introduced then are still applied on the &quot;calçada&quot;, most noticeably the use of a &quot;foundation&quot; and a &quot;surfacing&quot;.

In its current form, Portuguese pavement was first used in Lisbon from 1840 to 1846, during repairs to São Jorge Castle directed by general and engineer Eusebio Pinheiro Furtado. These included the repavement of the castle&#x27;s courtyards with a zigzag pattern of alternating black and white stones deemed atypical for the time.

In 1848, Pinheiro was put in charge with the renewal of Rossio square, which he paved with a pattern of waves in homage to the sea crossed by Portuguese sailors. From then onward, the &quot;calçada&quot; began to spread throughout the streets of Lisbon and Portugal as a whole. Much of the motifs and patterns would revolve around the sea and maritime exploration, and the pavement quickly became a symbol of Portuguese culture and identity, also spreading overseas to Portugal&#x27;s colonies.

Portuguese pavement spread to Spain in the late 19th century, most notably to Barcelona in 1896, where it was used to pave the sides of the Salón de San Juan, with later expansions in 1909 and 1917–1920.

It was not until 1905 when Portuguese pavement was first used in Brazil, in the city of Manaus. Belo Horizonte followed suit, and then Rio de Janeiro. In Rio, mayor Francisco Pereira Passos was a strong promoter of implementing the &quot;calçada&quot; as part of the city&#x27;s urban renewal plan, which was subsequently adopted in the reworking of Avenida Rio Branco, importing &quot;calceteiros&quot;, designs and even stones from Portugal. The remaining building materials were destined to the newly innaugurated Avenida Atlântica, in its iconic wavy pattern. Portuguese pavement then began to proliferate through Rio.

In the 1940s, the Portuguese &quot;calçada&quot; began to evolve in line with the principles of the International Style, developing abstract geometric patterns. In Brazil, this pavement was used in many projects directed by modernist architects, in which they blended traditional materials and techniques like the &quot;calçada&quot; with contemporary design. Roberto Burle Marx applied it to many of his works and conserved it when redesigning Copacabana in the 1970s.

==Future==

Very little new paving of this type is done, and the entire profession is at risk. The long hours and low wages typical of &quot;calceteiros&quot; have reduced apprenticeships and thus new pavers. Furthermore, as the pavement is less safe (provides less traction when wet; loose stones can become tripping hazards), costs more (especially with the difficulty of obtaining appropriate stones), and wears quicker than concrete or asphalt, there is also dropping interest in investment and construction in it. Although there were once hundreds of &quot;calceteiros&quot;, most modern work is on conservation or major architectural projects.

In spite of its historical and cultural value, this type of pavement has raised concerns in recent times, particularly in regards to its accessibility. Portuguese pavement has been noted for being particularly slippery, a condition worsened by natural wear and tear as well as by rainy conditions, the latter of which also allows for the formation of puddles in more concave, worn-out sections. Other disadvantages include the propensity for weeds and moss to form in its cracks. The loosening of stones is also a relevant issue, making sidewalks covered by this type of pavement need constant maintenance and repair in order to avoid pedestrians from tripping. These qualities have often made transport for the elderly, wheelchair users, pregnant women and babies in strollers particularly difficult. Portuguese pavement is also especially harsh on some types of footwear.

In Portugal, Porto completely replaced the traditional pavement of its city centre for granite blocks in 2005.

In Brazil, while São Paulo has almost completely replaced the Portuguese pavement sidewalks of Paulista Avenue with a cheaper, more regular type of concrete pavement since 2007, other cities such as Rio de Janeiro still have a nearly ubiquitous Portuguese pavement, particularly in more affluent areas.

It can also be found around the Asunción Super Centro building in Asunción, Paraguay.

==Technique==
Craftsmen lay a bedding of gravel upon a well-compacted trench of argillaceous materials, which accommodates the tessera stones, acting as a cement.

<doc id="1324565" wikidata="Q1233319" url="?curid=1324565" title="DuPont analysis">
<text>DuPont analysis (also known as the DuPont identity, DuPont equation, DuPont framework, DuPont model, DuPont method or DuPont system) is a tool used in financial analysis, where return on equity (ROE) is separated into its component parts.

Useful in several contexts, this &quot;decomposition&quot; of ROE allows financial managers to focus on the key metrics of financial performance individually, and thereby to identify strengths and weaknesses within the company that should be addressed. Similarly, it allows investors to compare the operational efficiency of two comparable firms.

The name derives from the DuPont company, which began using this formula in the 1920s. A DuPont explosives salesman, Donaldson Brown, submitted an internal efficiency report to his superiors in 1912 that contained the formula.

==Basic formula==
The DuPont analysis breaks down ROE into three component parts, which may then be managed individually:
* Profitability: measured by profit margin
* Asset efficiency: measured by asset turnover
* Financial leverage: measured by equity multiplier
Or 
Or 

==ROE analysis==
The DuPont analysis breaks down ROE (that is, the returns that investors receive from a single dollar of equity) into three distinct elements. This analysis enables the manager or analyst to understand the source of superior (or inferior) return by comparison with companies in similar industries (or between industries). See for further context.

The DuPont analysis is less useful for industries such as investment banking, in which the underlying elements are not meaningful (see related discussion: ). Variations of the DuPont analysis have been developed for industries where the elements are weakly meaningful, for example:

===High margin industries===
Some industries, such as the fashion industry, may derive a substantial portion of their income from selling at a higher margin, rather than higher sales. For high-end fashion brands, increasing sales without sacrificing margin may be critical. The DuPont analysis allows analysts to determine which of the elements is dominant in any change of ROE. 

===High turnover industries===
Certain types of retail operations, particularly stores, may have very low profit margins on sales, and relatively moderate leverage. In contrast, though, groceries may have very high turnover, selling a significant multiple of their assets per year. The ROE of such firms may be particularly dependent on performance of this metric, and hence asset turnover may be studied extremely carefully for signs of under-, or, over-performance. For example, same-store sales of many retailers is considered important as an indication that the firm is deriving greater profits from existing stores (rather than showing improved performance by continually opening stores).

===High leverage industries===
Some sectors, such as the financial sector, rely on high leverage to generate acceptable ROE. Other industries would see high levels of leverage as unacceptably risky. DuPont analysis enables third parties that rely primarily on their financial statements to compare leverage among similar companies.

==ROA and ROE ratio==
The return on assets (ROA) ratio developed by DuPont for its own use is now used by many firms to evaluate how effectively assets are used. It measures the combined effects of profit margins and asset turnover.

:formula_1

The return on equity (ROE) ratio is a measure of the rate of return to stockholders. Decomposing the ROE into various factors influencing company performance is often called the DuPont system.

:formula_2
:Where
:* Net Income = pre-tax income after taxes
:* Equity = shareholders&#x27; equity
:* EBIT = Earnings before interest and taxes
:* Pretax Income is often reported as Earnings Before Taxes or EBT
This decomposition presents various ratios used in fundamental analysis. 
* The company&#x27;s tax burden is (Net income ÷ Pretax profit). This is the proportion of the company&#x27;s profits retained after paying income taxes. [NI/EBT]
* The company&#x27;s interest burden is (Pretax income ÷ EBIT). This will be 1.00 for a firm with no debt or financial leverage. [EBT/EBIT]
* The company&#x27;s operating income margin or return on sales (ROS) is (EBIT ÷ Revenue). This is the operating income per dollar of sales. [EBIT/Revenue]
* The company&#x27;s asset turnover (ATO) is (Revenue ÷ Average Total Assets). 
* The company&#x27;s equity multiplier is (Average Total Assets ÷ Average Total Equity). This is a measure of financial leverage.

<text>Alexey Alexandrovich Mordashov (; born 26 September 1965) is a Russian billionaire businessman. He is the main shareholder and chairman of Severstal, Russia&#x27;s largest steel and mining company.

As of 2025, he is the wealthiest man in Russia with an estimated personal net worth at US$30.5 billion. In the Forbes 2025 ranking, which takes into account the assets of the whole family, Mordashov ranks first among Russian billionaires (US$30.5∅B). .
When he was 37, Forbes ordained him (along with Oprah) as a &quot;new arrival&quot; in the world of billionaires.

Mordashov was mentioned in the Panama Papers and FinCEN files leaks – a company associated with Mordashov paid for a number of Vladimir Putin&#x27;s pet projects and gave generously to close Putin associates.

He is under sanctions due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to the EU, Rossiya Bank, in which Mordashov owns a financial stake, is the &quot;personal bank&quot; of the senior officials who benefitted from the annexation of Crimea. In November 2023, the New York Times reported as part of the Cyprus Confidential leak that accounts connected to him paid , a German author, to write a book about Putin.

==Early life==
Mordashov is the son of Russian parents, who were both steel mill workers. According to Mordashov, his family used welfare coupons, allowed only 200g of butter and 400g of sausages per month. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree in engineering from the Leningrad Engineering-Economical Institute, currently known as ENGECON. He later gained an MBA from Northumbria University in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, in 2001. In an address to students at the European University at Saint Petersburg, Mordashov spoke about his decision to study in Leningrad rather than Moscow and the value his undergraduate studies played in his search for employment and eventual career path. Returning to Cherepovets, he started his career by joining the same steel plant where his parents had worked.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
In 1988 he joined Cherepovetskiy Metallurgical Plant after graduation from Leningrad Engineering-Economical Institut as an economist. By 1992 he became finance director, shortly before the company was privatised. When the plant&#x27;s elderly director instructed him to acquire shares to keep them out of the hands of an outsider, he formed two investment funds and, by buying up workers&#x27; shares, built a major stake in the factory. In 1996 he was appointed as CEO of the company. He went on to build a conglomerate, Severstal, acquiring steel, coal and mining companies.

=== Investments ===
In 2003, Mordashov became a co-owner of Rossiya Bank.

In 2004, Mordashov started investing in US steel companies, purchasing companies in Dearborn, MI and Columbus, MS. The acquisition included the Rouge Plant in Dearborn. He received a loan from the United States Department of Energy to renovate and refurbish the manufacturing plants in Dearborn. The value of the loan, over $370 million, was revoked in 2012, after growing political tensions between the US and Russia.

Between 2004 and 2014, Mordashov and Severstal invested up to $3 billion in both the Dearborn and Columbus plants. In 2011 he sold a number of US assets in Ohio, Maryland and West Virginia to the Renco Group, owned by industrialist Ira Rennert. By 2014 all of Severstal&#x27;s US investments had been sold for a total of $2.3 billion.

His company Severstal planned a multibillion-dollar project in joint venture with POSCO in eastern India. After ten years of not getting environmental and land clearances, his company opted out in 2008.

In autumn 2007, Mordashov purchased shares in TUI Travel. As he increased his stake to the largest single shareholder through his S-Group Travel, TUI Travel under Michael Frenzel expanded into Eastern Europe and Russia in 2008, China and India in 2009, and sold off its shipping interests, Hapag-Lloyd AG, to the &quot;Albert Ballin Consortium&quot; in March 2009. In 2014, he held a blocking stake of more than 25% in TUI Travel when TUI Travel was absorbed by TUI Group. In October 2018, he has a 24.9% stake in TUI Group through his S-Group Travel and has been on the TUI Group supervisory board since 2016.

In 2008, Mordashov, Surgutneftegas and Rossiya Bank created the National Media Group, which now owns packages in TV channels (Fifth, First, REN TV).

In 2011, Mordashov purchased 25% of the shares in steam turbine manufacturer, Power Machines, from Siemens. In 2013, with partner Yuri Kovalchuk, Mordashov bought 50% of Tele2 Russia, the country&#x27;s 4th largest mobile phone operator.

In 2012, Mordashov consolidated Severstal&#x27;s gold mining assets into one company, Nord Gold N.V. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: NORD LI). In 2013, Nord Gold was awarded a license to embark on gold exploration in Siberia. In 2017 Mordashov announced plans to delist Nordgold from the London Stock Exchange (LSE) citing unfair valuation as the reason. The LSE requires that companies have at least 25% as free float, while Mordashov owns 91% of the company.

Mordashov was elected as chairman of the World Steel Association in October 2012. In 2011, he was the only Russian participant in a meeting of Bilderberg Club at St Moritz, Switzerland.

In June 2013, Mordashov was the fifth largest shareholder of Rossiya Bank owning 6%.

In 2015, Mordashov stepped down as CEO, appointing former COO Vadim Larin, in his place. Mordashov would be appointed as chairman. The changes were confirmed by Severstal.

On 10 October 2017 Alexey Mordashov became a Commander of the Order of Merit of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

=== Sanctions ===
On 28 February 2022, in relation to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Union blacklisted Mordashov and had all his assets frozen. In early March, the Italian police seized one of his yachts, the &quot;Lady M&quot;. At that time, another one of his yachts, the &quot;Nord&quot;, was outside the European Unions jurisdiction in the Seychelles.

He was sanctioned by the UK government in 2022 in relation to the Russo-Ukrainian War.

== Pandora Papers ==

The Pandora Papers were a collection of nearly 12 million leaked confidential financial records compiled by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Within those records are details of how a special unit known as &quot;Cypriot&quot; within accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) helped Mordashov &quot;build the offshore infrastructure of his business empire.&quot; The firm helped set up over 65 shell companies in various &quot;secrecy jurisdictions&quot; such as the British Virgin Islands on behalf of a holding company connected to Mordashov. Through these shell companies, Mordashov expanded his presence in the logging, coal, and media industries inside Russia.

== Personal life ==
Mordashov and his first wife Elena (sometimes Yelena) have a son, Ilya, and divorced in 1996. In 2001, it was revealed in a St Petersburg divorce court that he was paying only $620 a month to support his ex-wife and son, when she sued him for half of his pre-divorce property but lost the case and incurred large fees. The case was eventually settled after she took it to the European Court of Human Rights.

Mordashov owns the yachts Lady M and Nord as well as a private jet.

By 2001, Mordashov had married his second wife, also Elena, and had had two more sons - Kirill and Nikita.

In 2018–2019, for Kirill and Nikita the KN-holding company was created, to which Mordashov transferred his shares in Nordgold and TUI. In this way, the businessman hoped to transfer business experience to his sons. But in 2021, Nikita lost his share due to unsuccessful studies and leaving for military service.

In 2022, the ICIJ reported that Mordashov transferred most of his ownership stake in tourism conglomerate TUI to a Caribbean shell company controlled by Marina Mordashova who is reportedly the mother of some of his children.

<text>Ann Hansen is a Canadian anarchist and former member of Direct Action, a guerrilla organization known for the 1982 bombing of a Litton Industries plant, which made components for American cruise missiles. After her arrest she was sentenced to life in prison and was released on parole after seven years. Hansen wrote of her experiences in her 2002 book, &quot;Direct Action: Memoirs of an Urban Guerrilla&quot;. She is a prison rights activist and released her book &quot;Taking the Rap: Women Doing Time for Society&#x27;s Crimes&quot; in 2018.

==Direct Action==
By the late 1970s, Hansen was living in Toronto, where she met Brent Taylor. She then moved to Vancouver and began a relationship with Taylor. They decided to form a guerrilla organization named Direct Action, with the addition of Doug Stewart, Julie Belmas and Gerry Hannah, local fixtures of Vancouver&#x27;s punk scene. The group carried out militant actions which included an attack on a BC Hydro substation on Vancouver Island and the Litton Industries bombing in Toronto. The Litton Industries site was preparing to build components for US cruise missiles and the explosion played a part in Litton losing the contract. Hansen, as a member of a separate group known as the Wimmin’s Fire Brigade, later fire-bombed several Red Hot Video stores in Vancouver which sold hardcore porn.

Hansen and other members of Direct Action were arrested in 1983 and she was remanded to Oakalla Prison in British Columbia. After being sentenced to life imprisonment, she was moved to Kingston Prison for Women and later the Grand Valley Institution for Women in Kitchener. She was struck by the number of prisoners who were indigenous or black. Hansen was released on parole after seven years. Hansen released a memoir entitled &quot;Direct Action: Memoirs of an Urban Guerrilla&quot; in 2001.

==Activism==

In August 2012, Hansen was arrested and imprisoned for alleged parole violations after she had organised a film screening at public library in Kingston, Ontario at which a lawyer gave a direct action workshop. She was held again at the Grand Valley Institution for Women. She was released with stricter parole conditions in October.

After writing the book &quot;Taking the Rap: Women Doing Time for Society&#x27;s Crimes&quot; about her experiences of incarceration, Hansen made a speaking tour of Canada, talking at the University of British Columbia, Capilano University, Kwantlen Polytechnic University (KPU), the University of Winnipeg and the Magnus Eliason Recreation Centre in Winnipeg, amongst other places.

Hansen is part of the P4W Memorial Collective, which campaigns for the preservation of the former Kingston Prison for Women, where she was previously incarcerated. When the building was redeveloped, the group requested a memorial garden be built to remember those women who were imprisoned there. Hansen participated in 2020 as a speaker in the event &quot;Untold stories on Kingston Penitentiary Tours: An online panel discussion&quot;.

Hansen donated her personal papers to the University of Victoria Libraries&#x27; Special Collections &amp; University Archives&#x27; Anarchist Archives in 2011.

<doc id="1324570" wikidata="Q494412" url="?curid=1324570" title="Lee Kun-hee">
<text>Lee Kun-hee (; 9 January 194225 October 2020) was a South Korean businessman who served as the chairman of Samsung from 1987 to 2008 and from 2010 to his death in 2020. He is also credited with the transformation of Samsung to one of the world&#x27;s largest business entities that engages in semiconductors, smartphones, electronics, shipbuilding, construction, and other businesses. Since Lee became the chairman of Samsung, the company became the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of smartphones, memory chips, and appliances. He was the third son of Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul. With an estimated net worth of US$21 billion at the time of his death, he was the richest person in South Korea, a position that he had held since 2007.

He was convicted twice, once in 1996 and subsequently in 2008, for corruption and tax evasion charges, but was pardoned on both instances. In 2014, Lee was named the world&#x27;s 35th most powerful person and the most powerful Korean by &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s most powerful people along with his son, Lee Jae-yong.

==Early life==

Lee Kun-hee was born on 9 January 1942 in Daegu, during the Japanese occupation of Korea. His father, Lee Byung-chul, founded the Samsung Group, initially as an exporter of fruit and dried fish. Lee Kun-hee studied economics at Waseda University in Tokyo, and was later educated at the George Washington University in the United States.

==Career==

===First period at Samsung===
Lee joined the Tongyang Broadcasting Company (then an affiliate of the Samsung Group) in 1966, and later went on to work for Samsung&#x27;s construction and trading company.

He took over the chairmanship of the conglomerate on 24 December 1987, two weeks after the death of his father, Lee Byung-chul. In 1993, believing that Samsung Group was overly focused on producing large quantities of low-quality goods and was not prepared to compete in quality, Lee famously said, &quot;Change everything except your wife and kids&quot;. This call was an attempt to drive innovation at the company and to face up to the competition at that time from rivals like Sony Corporation. In what is now known as the &#x27;Frankfurt Declaration&#x27;, he gathered his executives in the German city in 1993, and called for a change in the company&#x27;s approach to quality, even if it meant lower sales. The company went on to become the largest manufacturer of televisions, outpacing Sony in 2006.

===Scandals and controversies===
Lee was convicted for having paid bribes to president Roh Tae-woo in 1996. He was subsequently pardoned by president Kim Young-sam.

On 14 January 2008, Korean police raided Lee&#x27;s home and office in an ongoing probe into accusations that Samsung was responsible for a slush fund used to bribe influential prosecutors, judges, and political figures in South Korea. On 4 April 2008, Lee denied allegations against him in the scandal. After a second round of questioning by the South Korean prosecutors, on 11 April 2008, Lee was quoted by reporters as saying, &quot;I am responsible for everything. I will assume full moral and legal responsibility.&quot; On 21 April 2008, he resigned and stated: &quot;We, including myself, have caused troubles to the nation with the special probe; I deeply apologize for that, and I&#x27;ll take full responsibility for everything, both legally and morally.&quot;

On 16 July 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the Seoul Central District Court had found Lee guilty on charges of financial wrongdoing and tax evasion. Prosecutors requested that Lee be sentenced to seven years in prison and fined 350 billion won (approximately US$312 million). The court fined him 110 billion won (approximately US$98 million) and gave him a three-years suspended sentence. However, on 29 December 2009, South Korean president Lee Myung-bak pardoned Lee, stating that the intent of the pardon was to allow Lee to remain on the International Olympic Committee. In Lee Myung-bak&#x27;s corruption trial, this pardon was revealed to have been in exchange for bribes; further bribery and other political corruption between former President Lee and Lee Kun-hee was also exposed.

&quot;Think Samsung&quot;, a 2010 book by Kim Yong-chul, former Samsung legal counsel, alleged that Lee was guilty of corruption. In particular, it claimed that he stole up to 10 trillion won (approximately US$8.9 billion) from Samsung subsidiaries, tampered with evidence, and bribed government officials to guarantee his son would succeed him.

===Return to Samsung===
On 24 March 2010, Lee announced his return to Samsung Electronics as its chairman. He continued in this position until 2014, when he suffered an incapacitating heart attack and his son, Lee Jae-yong, became the Samsung group&#x27;s de facto leader. He is credited with having transformed Samsung into the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of smartphones, televisions, and memory chips. At the time of his death, the company was worth US$300 billion, and with an estimated net worth US$20.7 billion per Bloomberg&#x27;s billionaire index, he was the richest person in South Korea; a position that he had held since 2007.

Following his death, Lee&#x27;s heirs are expected to face an estate tax of around US$10 billion, which might potentially result in dilution of the family&#x27;s stake in the conglomerate. This stems from South Korea&#x27;s high estate tax of 50% for estates larger than US$3 billion, which is second only to Japan, amongst the OECD countries.

==Personal life==
Lee Kun-hee was married to Hong Ra-hee until his death. Hong is the daughter of Hong Jin-ki, the former chairman of the JoongAng Ilbo and Tongyang Broadcasting Company.

His siblings and some of their children are also executives of major Korean business groups. Lee Boo-jin, his eldest daughter, is president and CEO of Hotel Shilla, a luxury hotel chain, as well as president of Everland Resort, a theme park and resort operator that is &quot;widely seen as the de facto holding company for the conglomerate&quot; according to the Associated Press.

Lee had four children: the eldest child and the only son, Lee Jae-yong (born 1968), and three daughters, Lee Boo-jin (born 1970), Lee Seo-hyun (born 1973), and Lee Yoon-hyung (1979–2005) who died by suicide.

Lee&#x27;s older brother Lee Maeng-hee and older sister Lee Sook-hee initiated legal action against him in February 2012, asking a South Korean court to award them shares of Samsung companies totaling US$850 million (913.563 billion won), which they claim their father willed to them. Court hearings began in May 2012. On 6 February 2014, courts in South Korea dismissed the case.

===Illness and death===

Lee was treated for lung cancer in the late 1990s and was tested again for cancer in 2005, at the MD Anderson Medical Center in Houston, Texas, with no subsequent concerns being announced. He was hospitalized in Seoul in May 2014 after suffering a heart attack, and lapsed into a coma, which he remained in until his death on 25 October 2020, at the age of 78.

Lee&#x27;s death triggered the largest inheritance tax bill in history, of 12 trillion won ($10.78 billion).

===Posthumous===

The heirs to the late Lee announced in the spring of 2021 that the businessman&#x27;s multibillion-dollar collection of more than 23,000 works of art would be dispersed throughout public institutions in South Korea. Contrary to this announcement, the country&#x27;s minister of culture, sports, and tourism, Hwang Hee, announced plans to build a new museum dedicated to the Lee collection.

He is married to Christa Schlecker and has two children, Lars Schlecker and Meike Schlecker, both active in the management of the Schlecker company.

At the age of 21, he acquired the degree &quot;Meister&quot; butcher and took over the parental butcher&#x27;s shop. In 1975, he built his first drug store in Kirchheim unter Teck which went up to more than 100 stores two years later. , there were more than 13,000 stores across Europe, employing about 50,000 people and generating revenue of about 6.55 billion euros.

In July 2012, Anton Schlecker and his family declared bankruptcy and all Schlecker stores closed and were sold off to the appointed receivers.

== Schlecker kidnapping ==

In 1987, his two children – Meike and Lars – were kidnapped, released only after he paid 9.6 million marks in ransom. In summer 1998, Wilhelm Hudelmaier and Herbert Jacoby were arrested in Ehingen and convicted of kidnapping. In 1999, they were convicted by the Landgericht Ulm of kidnapping and extortion. They both were sentenced to a prison term of 13.5 years.

<doc id="1324576" wikidata="Q7608688" url="?curid=1324576" title="Stephen Bechtel Jr.">
<text>Stephen Davison Bechtel Jr. (May 10, 1925 – March 15, 2021) was an American billionaire businessman, civil engineer, and co-owner of the Bechtel Corporation. He was the son of Stephen Davison Bechtel Sr. and grandson of Warren A. Bechtel, who founded the Bechtel Corporation. He was known for expanding the global footprint of the corporation through several of its international projects. Some of the projects executed under his leadership of the company included King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh as well as Jubail Industrial City in Saudi Arabia as well as oil platforms in the North Sea, liquefied natural gas plants in Algeria, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates.

Bechtel also served on the board of General Motors and International Business Machines. He had a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the Purdue University and a master&#x27;s degree from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

At the time of his death, he had a net worth of nearly US$3 billion according to &quot;Forbes&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Bechtel was born in Oakland, California, on May 10, 1925. He was the son of Laura A. Peart and Stephen Bechtel Sr., and the grandson of Warren A. Bechtel, the founder of American construction and civil engineering firm Bechtel Corporation. During his time in high school, he enlisted in Marine Corps Reserve, and went to University of Colorado to study engineering. In 1946, he graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering, where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi, and married Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Mead Hogan, a Berkeley alumna. He earned his Master of Business Administration degree from the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1948.

==Career==
Bechtel joined the family business in 1948. While he initially wanted to enter into home building, he was convinced by his father by showcasing Bechtel Corporation&#x27;s global projects in a three week trip. He succeeded his father, Stephen Bechtel Sr., as president of Bechtel Corporation in 1960 and chairman in 1969. His career with the company spanned 30 years until his retirement in 1990. During his time, the company which was earlier known for its work on the Hoover Dam and the Bay Area Rapid Transit, expanded its global footprint by working on the Channel Tunnel between France and the United Kingdom, King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh as well as Jubail Industrial City in Saudi Arabia. The last is considered one of the largest civil engineering projects of the time. The company was involved in the build out of oil platforms in the North Sea, liquefied natural gas plants in Algeria, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates, and also in the cleanup of the nuclear reactor site Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.

The company&#x27;s role in Boston&#x27;s infrastructure projects, titled Big Dig, in the 1990s came into scrutiny, with the company having to pay to settle litigation over a ceiling collapse and leaky tunnels. Earlier, the company had been charged by the US Justice Department in 1976 of illegally complying with the Arab League boycott of Israel, and had also faced criticism for undertaking projects in Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq of the 1980s. During his leadership, the 1980s oil glut and the resulting plunge in oil prices resulted in reduced spend by the middle-eastern countries on infrastructure projects including petroleum pipelines, resulting in a significant impact to the company&#x27;s business. In addition to retrenchments of about half of its 44,000 member large workforce, the company under Bechtel&#x27;s leadership undertook financial engineering actions including taking part ownership in some of the infrastructure projects.

During his time the company, over three decades, the company&#x27;s revenues grew eleven-fold, and the company also pivoted from majority ownership residing within the family to a model that had majority ownership by managers outside of the family. He held 20 percent of the company shares and his net worth in 2021 was estimated by &quot;Forbes&quot; to be $2.9 billion. After his retirement from Bechtel Corporation, he headed the real estate company Fremont Group, which was also an early investor in Starbucks Corporation. He had also served as director on the board of General Motors and International Business Machines.

===Political appointments===
Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Bechtel to the President’s Committee on Urban Housing. Richard Nixon named him to membership on the National Industrial Pollution Control Council, the National Commission on Productivity, the Labor Management Advisory Committee, and the National Commission for Industrial Peace. Gerald Ford asked Bechtel to serve on the President’s Labor-Management Committee.

=== Boy Scouts ===
Bechtel became an Eagle Scout in 1940 and has been recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with both the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and the Silver Buffalo Award. Stephen&#x27;s uncle Kenneth K. Bechtel was awarded the Silver Buffalo in 1950 and served as national president of the Boy Scouts of America from 1956 to 1959.

The BSA acquired new property near Beckley, West Virginia, for a new high adventure base in 2009. Bechtel donated $50 million towards the new base, which has been named The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve.

=== Philanthropy ===
Bechtel was a contributor to many environmental causes. He created a foundation in 1957 to support these cases. The foundation contributed $50 million to create a National Scout Reserve in southern West Virginia, which is now the home of the national boy scout jamboree. The foundation contributed $25 million to renovate the Presidio of San Francisco. The S. D. Bechtel Jr. Foundation and the Stephen Bechtel Fund support many non-profit groups, especially in the San Francisco Bay area. Stephen and Betty&#x27;s largess also extended to Berkeley&#x27;s International House, Mills College, Achievement Rewards for College Scientists, the San Francisco Symphony, the San Francisco Ballet, the Head Royce School, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Royal Horticultural Society, the American Friends of the Royal Academy Trust, the Nature Conservancy, the Royal Oak Foundation, the Huntington Library, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

==Awards and honors==
Bechtel was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990. He is the 1980 recipient of the Hoover Medal, which commemorates the civic and humanitarian achievements of engineers. In 1990, he was elevated to National Honor Member by Chi Epsilon, the national civil engineering honor society. In 1998, he and his son Riley were presented with the Honor Award from the National Building Museum for their company&#x27;s contributions to the built environment. Bechtel received the Award of Excellence from &quot;Engineering News-Record&quot; for his leadership of Bechtel Corporation.

He received the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 1991, from the then US President, George H. W. Bush.

== Personal life ==
Bechtel and his wife, Betty, had two sons and three daughters. One son, Riley Bechtel, succeeded him as the chairman and chief executive of the Bechtel Corporation. He was a nature enthusiast and hiker who had once made the trek to the Everest base camp and had also hiked the John Muir Trail over a 211 mile course.

Bechtel died on March 15, 2021, at his home in San Francisco, California. He was aged 95.

<doc id="1324580" wikidata="Q6525484" url="?curid=1324580" title="Leonard Lauder">
<text>Leonard Alan Lauder (born March 19, 1933) is an American billionaire, philanthropist, art collector. He and his brother, Ronald Lauder, are the sole heirs to the Estée Lauder Companies cosmetics fortune, founded by their parents, Estée Lauder and Joseph Lauder, in 1946. During his tenure as the CEO, the company went public at The New York Stock Exchange in 1996 and acquired several major cosmetics brands, including MAC Cosmetics, Aveda, Bobbi Brown, and La Mer.

In 2013, Lauder promised his collection of Cubist art to The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The collection is valued at over $1 billion and constitutes one of the largest gifts in the museum&#x27;s history.

&quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot; estimated Lauder&#x27;s net worth at US$32.3 billion as of September 2021, the 44th richest person in the world.

==Early life and education==
Lauder is the elder son of Joseph and Estée Lauder and the elder brother of Ronald Lauder. His family is Jewish. He married Evelyn Hausner in July 1959. They had two sons, William, executive chairman of The Estée Lauder Companies, and Gary, managing director of Lauder Partners LLC. He is a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and he also studied at Columbia University&#x27;s Graduate School of Business before serving as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy.

==Career==
He joined Estée Lauder in 1958 when he was 25. He created the company&#x27;s first research and development laboratory in the mid-1990s and was responsible for the company acquiring brands like MAC, Bobbi Brown and Aveda. Under his leadership in the late 1980s, Estée Lauder opened its first store in Moscow with support from the Gosbank daughter the Moscow Narodny Bank Limited in London.

In 1986, Lauder hosted a New York City luncheon attended by Donald Trump and Soviet Ambassador to the United States Yuri Dubinin during which Trump hashed out his partnership with the Kremlin.

Lauder stepped down as CEO of Estée Lauder in 1999, but remains chairman emeritus of the company and is known around the company as &quot;Chief Teaching Officer&quot;.

Lauder gained notoriety in 2001 for creating the Lipstick index, a since discredited economic indicator, meant to reflect a proclivity to spend money on luxury items even in the face of crisis. For many years, he has resided on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. On January 1, 2015, Lauder married photographer Judy Ellis Glickman.

Leonard Lauder, unlike his brother, supported Kathy Hochul&#x27;s first campaign for New York governor in 2022.

===Art collection===
Lauder is a major art collector (he began by buying Art Deco postcards when he was six), but his particular focus, rather than on American artists, is on works by the Cubist masters Picasso, Braque, Gris, and Léger. He also collects Klimt. Much of his art comes from some of the world&#x27;s most celebrated collections, including those of Gertrude Stein, the Swiss banker Raoul La Roche, and the British art historian Douglas Cooper.

In 2012, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston opened an exhibition of 700 of his postcards, a tiny part of the promised gift he has made to the museum of 120,000 postcards: &quot;The Postcard Age: Selections from the Leonard A. Lauder Collection&quot;. In an interview in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Lauder explained how postcards turned him into a collector, and how these &quot;mini-masterpieces&quot; remained his lifelong pursuit to the point where his late wife, Evelyn, called the collection his &quot;mistress&quot;. He donated his collection of Oilette postcards, published by Raphael Tuck &amp; Sons, to Chicago&#x27;s Newberry Library, and funded their digitization; the Newberry launched the 26,000-item Tuck digital collection in 2019.

Lauder&#x27;s interest in postcards led him to be acquainted with one of the owners of the Gotham Book Mart, a Manhattan bookstore, and he sought to help the Gotham re-establish its presence in the city when the owner had sold its long-time building and needed a new space. Lauder bought a building at 16 East 46th Street along with a partner, letting the building&#x27;s storefront space to the Gotham. Later, the Gotham fell behind on rents, eventually resulting in Lauder and his partner to file for eviction. In a much-publicized closure of the bookstore, the New York City Marshal later auctioned the store&#x27;s inventory, which was bought in a lot by Lauder and his partner to some protest from many other independent book sellers and collectors who were present at the proceedings and hoping to purchase some of the bibliophilic treasures.

===Philanthropy===
====Arts and culture====
Lauder has long been a major benefactor of the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 1971, he joined the museum&#x27;s acquisitions board and in 1977, by then president of his family&#x27;s business, he became a Whitney trustee. He became president in 1990 and has been chairman since 1994. He has donated both money and many works of art to the Whitney, and is the museum&#x27;s most prolific fundraiser. His 2008 donation to it of $131 million is the largest in the museum&#x27;s history. Through the Leonard and Evelyn Lauder Fund, he and his wife have also sponsored several exhibitions at the Whitney. The fifth-floor permanent collection galleries are named for the couple. In 1998, he told a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that his &quot;dream job&quot; was to be the Whitney Museum&#x27;s director. Most recently, Lauder gave $131 million for the Whitney&#x27;s endowment.

A long-time supporter of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, Lauder led the creation of a research center for Modern art at the museum, which he helped support through a $22 million endowment made alongside museum trustees and other benefactors. In April 2013, he promised his collection of 81 pieces of Cubist art, consisting of 34 pieces by Pablo Picasso, 17 by Georges Braque, 15 by Fernand Léger, and 15 by Juan Gris to the museum; together, they are valued at more than one billion dollars. It has been described by William Acquavella, of Acquavella Galleries, as &quot;without doubt the most important collection any private person has put together in many, many years,&quot; Art historian Emily Braun, who co-organized the 2014 Met exhibition of Lauder&#x27;s Cubist collection with Rebecca Rabinow, has served as Leonard Lauder&#x27;s personal curator since 1987.

====Social causes====
Lauder is co-founder and chairman of the Alzheimer&#x27;s Drug Discovery Foundation, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a trustee of the Aspen Institute, chairman of The Aspen Institute International Committee, honorary chair of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and a member of the President&#x27;s Council of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital. Along with his wife, Evelyn, he helped create the Evelyn H Lauder Breast Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. In February 2022, he donated $125 million to University of Pennsylvania to establish a new tuition-free nurse practitioner program within Penn Nursing.

===Memoir===
Lauder&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Company I Keep: My Life in Beauty&quot; was published in 2020.

<doc id="1324582" wikidata="Q2746395" url="?curid=1324582" title="Portage Park, Chicago">
<text>Portage Park is located on the northwest side of the City of Chicago, Illinois and is one of 77 officially designated Chicago community areas. Portage Park is bordered by the community areas of Jefferson Park and Forest Glen to the north, Dunning and the suburb of Harwood Heights to the west, Irving Park to the east and Belmont-Cragin to the south.

The area is notable for its Six Corners outdoor shopping district, centered at the intersection of Irving Park Road, Cicero Avenue and the diagonal Milwaukee Avenue, the Portage Theater and for its namesake - Portage Park. The name of the park was taken from the major portage linking the Des Plaines and Chicago rivers along what is today Irving Park Road. The area was so swampy that in wet weather, Native Americans and trappers were easily able to paddle through the area in either direction without leaving their canoes. In those days, the Des Plaines was perhaps the most significant way to the Illinois, and then on to the Mississippi (and to return).

Portage Park has the largest Polish community in the Chicago Metropolitan Area according to the 2000 census. Portage Park is home to the Polish American Association, the Polish Jesuit Millennium Center, the Polish Army Veterans Association in the beautiful building of the former Irving State bank, in addition to the multitude of Polish shops and businesses throughout the district. One of the area&#x27;s parks is named Chopin Park after Frédéric Chopin, Poland&#x27;s most famous pianist and composer.

==History==

In 1850, along with construction of the Northwest Plank Road (present Milwaukee Avenue), Jefferson Township was incorporated at the legendary Dickinson Tavern. Jefferson Township was part of a large swath of land annexed to the city in 1889 in advance of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. Much of the area was still largely rural in the early 20th century until the extension of streetcar lines into the area along Milwaukee, Irving, and Cicero lured in immigrants from the overcrowded tenements of the city&#x27;s ethnic enclaves. Soon Scandinavian, German, Italian, Polish and Irish families from the industrial areas by the Chicago River such as Polish Downtown and Goose Island were buying lots in the vicinity to build their homes. Area developers such as Szajkowski, Schorsch as well as Koester and Zander subdivided what had been farmland into subdivisions of what became part of Chicago&#x27;s famous &quot;bungalow belt&quot;.

==Demographics==


==Transportation==

The Portage Park neighborhood is accessible via mass transit through the Blue Line. The Montrose station is located on Portage Park&#x27;s northeastern edge in the Kennedy Expressway median and the Irving Park station is located on Portage Park&#x27;s southeaster edge in the Kennedy Expressway median as well. The Milwaukee District / North Line has a station stop at Mayfair, just west of the Kennedy Expressway.

==Neighborhood==
The neighborhood of Portage Park is a primarily residential area. The area&#x27;s building stock is composed primarily of bungalows and two-flats. There are two large business districts in Portage Park; one, Six Corners, at the intersection of Irving, Cicero, and Milwaukee, and another at Belmont and Central extending south into Belmont-Cragin.
The area was home to a number of movie palaces, among which were the Portage, Patio, and Belpark theaters. While the Belpark is now closed, the Portage Theater has been renovated with public TIF funds and is now home to a performing arts center showing arthouse and silent films. The Patio was privately restored and now hosts musical and theater acts.

Portage Park is also home to a cluster of architecturally significant churches, and is one of the few neighborhoods on the city&#x27;s North Side highlighted in Marilyn Chiat&#x27;s &quot;The Spiritual Traveler: Chicago and Illinois&quot;. The spires and steeples of these monumental edifices such as St. Ladislaus, St. John of Rila the Wonderworker, St. Bartholomew, St. Ferdinand, and Our Lady of Victory tower over the neighborhood, giving the area much of its charm.

==Portage Park (Chicago Park District)==
Portage Park served as the focus that brought together the different communities in the area and created the neighborhood.

The field house at Portage Park was designed by Clarence Hatzfeld, whose firm Hatzfeld and Knox would later design many of the Prairie and Craftsman-style bungalows just east in the Villa District in Irving Park near historic St. Wenceslaus.

The park originally had a dirt bottom pond that blended into a concrete bottom pool. The hill to the east of the pool that exists now, was the dirt that was removed when the pool was first created when the park was first established. The pond portion of the pool extended to the western edge of this &#x27;hill&#x27;. The earliest building in the park is the gymnasium, followed by the field house. The staircase to the field house was a circular affair, supported by several cement posts under the platform that was created by a large landing at the second floor.

The WPA was very involved in the creation of the long gone Rock House at the south end of the Park. This Rock House had a small pond area that had goldfish and flower basins. Until the polio epidemic, the water was kept at a substantial depth to support the fish over winter. The flower planters to the north and east of the main entrance off Central at Irving Park Road will give an idea of just what the Rock House looked like. There were seats throughout the half circle structure of flagstone. Except for the overhead wooden canopy, every where you looked there was white flagstone - walls, seats, floor, support pillars. The Chicago Park District has WPA photos of the structure. The park predates all of the buildings that surround it.

The swimming events of the Pan-American Games were held here in 1959 in the second pool constructed in the park, as were the US swimming trials for the 1972 Summer Olympics.

<text>was a Japanese businessman and founder of Ito-Yokado.

==Early life and career==
Itō was born in Tokyo on 30 April 1924. His parents, Senzo and Yuki Itō, operated a dry goods shop named Yokado. After finishing high school, Itō had a short stint in the Japanese military and working at what would become Mitsubishi Materials before returning to work at his parents&#x27; shop. Following the death of his brother in 1956, Itō took over Yokado, which was then a clothing shop. He soon renamed the company Ito-Yokado.

Itō was the owner, founder and honorary chairman of the $30 billion (in sales) Ito-Yokado retailing group, the second largest retailing organization in the world, which includes more than 10,000 7-Elevens in Japan and the US. Itō built the company from a small apparel store in Tokyo, into a corporation with annual revenues of more than $28 billion and a labour force of more than 125,000. The Ito-Yokado Group includes more than 10,000 7-Eleven stores in Japan and 5,800 in North America, along with 1,000 other stores, department stores, restaurants, specialty shops, supermarkets and superstores. Ito-Yokado was also the Japanese franchisee for Oshman&#x27;s Sporting Goods stores, Robinson department stores, and Denny&#x27;s restaurants. The company has begun opening superstores in China.

In 1992, Itō resigned as president of Ito-Yokado following allegations his staff made payments to the yakuza. Itō denied knowledge of the payments, though some of the money came from his wife&#x27;s bank account, but nonetheless took responsibility for the payments.

==Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management==
Itō was a significant supporter of the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management, with an initial $3 million gift to help build the school&#x27;s current home and a subsequent $20 million gift. His son, Junro, earned his MBA at the Drucker School in 1989 and was active in the Drucker alumni association in Japan.

==Personal life and death==
Itō was married and had three children. He died on 10 March 2023, at the age of 98.

<text>Robert Kenneth Beausoleil (born November 6, 1947) is an American murderer and associate of Charles Manson and members of his communal Manson Family. He was convicted and sentenced to death for the July 27, 1969, fatal stabbing of Gary Hinman, who had befriended him and other Manson associates. Beausoleil was later granted commutation to a lesser sentence of life imprisonment, after the Supreme Court of California issued a ruling that invalidated all death sentences issued in California prior to 1972.

During his incarceration in the California state prison system, Beausoleil has recorded and released music. He has also worked on visual art, instrument design, and media technology. Although a parole board recommended him for parole in January 2019 in his 19th hearing for eligibility, the recommendation was denied by the governor of California.

==Early life==
Beausoleil was born on November 6, 1947, in Santa Barbara, California, to working-class parents Charles Kenneth Beausoleil and Helen Arlene Mattox. He was the first-born child in a Catholic family and has four siblings. When he was 15, Beausoleil was sent to Los Prietos Boys Camp for ten months for running away from home and a series of juvenile pranks. 

After his release, Beausoleil moved to the Los Angeles area and drifted between there and San Francisco, gravitating towards the emerging counterculture music scene and acting. He became a member of several rock bands beginning about 1965, including The Orkustra, The Milky Way, and The Grass Roots (other members later became Love). In 1967, he met Kenneth Anger and secured a part in Anger&#x27;s film &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot;. 

In 1968, Beausoleil was living with Gary Hinman in Topanga Canyon when he met Charles Manson. He became associated with Manson and the communal group known as the &quot;Manson Family&quot;.

==Murder of Gary Hinman==

According to Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi in his book &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, Gary Hinman was killed over an issue of money and property that Manson believed Hinman had, and that Manson felt the Family was owed for a Hinman-supplied Beausoleil drug deal gone bad. At Beausoleil&#x27;s second trial, prosecutors said it had been rumored that Hinman had received a $20,000 inheritance. According to the Los Angeles District Attorney&#x27;s Office, the slaying became the first in a series of murders committed by the &quot;Family&quot; that set in motion the &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; scenario, which Manson envisioned and preached would happen in the near future in America. 

Accompanying Beausoleil that night were Susan Atkins and Mary Brunner. Brunner was granted legal immunity as the key witness for Beausoleil&#x27;s prosecution. Atkins subsequently became involved in the infamous Tate-LaBianca murders and other crimes perpetrated by Manson and his followers.

Beausoleil went with Atkins and Brunner to Hinman&#x27;s house in Topanga Canyon, where Beausoleil had lived briefly. They demanded that Hinman give them money, but Hinman said that he did not have any money to give. Beausoleil called Manson at Spahn Ranch and said there was no money. Manson told them to hold Hinman captive at his house and convince him to get the money before Manson arrived.

Bruce Davis drove Manson to the Topanga Canyon home, taking a samurai sword or bayonet. Manson struck Hinman with the sword, severely cutting his face and ear. Some accounts said that he cut off part of Hinman&#x27;s ear. Beausoleil said he stitched up Hinman&#x27;s ear with dental floss; other reports say the stitching was done by Atkins and Brunner. Hinman begged for medical attention, but he was held captive at the house and tortured for three days before being killed. Manson told Beausoleil to kill Hinman and to make it look as if the crime had been committed by black revolutionaries, as part of his ideology that a race war was imminent and part of what he called &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;. Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death while Hinman, a devotee of Buddhism, repeated a Buddhist chant. As Hinman lay dying, Beausoleil, Atkins and Brunner took turns smothering him with a pillow. 

After killing Hinman, Beausoleil wrote the words &quot;Political piggy&quot; on a wall in Hinman&#x27;s blood, in an attempt to lead police to believe the murder was done by a group of radicals. He dipped his hand in Hinman&#x27;s blood and left a paw print, attempting to symbolize The Black Panthers as another way to mislead investigators about Hinman&#x27;s murder. Beausoleil drove away in Hinman&#x27;s Fiat. He was arrested on August 6, 1969, after falling asleep in the car, having pulled off the highway at Cuesta Grade, a steep segment of U.S. Route 101 between San Luis Obispo and Atascadero.

In a jailhouse interview twelve years after the murder, Beausoleil asserted that the killing was the result of a drug transaction gone wrong. No reference to a drug deal was made in either of Beausoleil&#x27;s two trials for the murder or in related books by Ed Sanders and Vincent Bugliosi. According to his 1981 interview published in &quot;Oui&quot; magazine, Beausoleil first said he had unknowingly supplied members of the Straight Satans motorcycle gang with a batch of bad mescaline, sold to him by Hinman, and the bikers had demanded their money back. In that interview, he denied that Manson had come to the Hinman residence. Beausoleil said that he had cut Hinman&#x27;s face himself with a knife during a struggle over a gun. In 1998 he reversed himself about that element of the assault. 

Conspirator Susan Atkins stated before her death that she never heard Beausoleil indicate that a drug transaction was related at all to why they went to Hinman&#x27;s house seeking money from him.

==Conviction, life in prison, and parole hearings==
On April 18, 1970, a Superior Court jury in Los Angeles found the 22-year-old Beausoleil guilty of first-degree murder of Hinman and sentenced him to death. 

Beausoleil&#x27;s 18-year-old girlfriend, Kathryn &quot;Kitty&quot; Lutesinger, had testified against him during the trial; she was then pregnant by him and later gave birth to a daughter, who would be raised by Lutesinger&#x27;s parents.

In 1972, following the Supreme Court of California ruling (in the case of &quot;People v. Anderson&quot;) that the prevailing death penalty statutes were unconstitutional, Beausoleil&#x27;s sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. 

Called as a witness at a 1973 sanity hearing for four other Manson associates, Beausoleil said that he and they would not conform to society&#x27;s standards of sane behavior. He said, 
&quot;I&#x27;m at war with everybody in this courtroom. It&#x27;s nothing personal but the world has been gattling at my brothers and sisters and as long as they are ripping off our world, our friends and our children, you better pray I never get out.&quot;

Beausoleil&#x27;s initial parole suitability hearing was held on August 15, 1978. Prior to 2019, he had a total of 18 suitability hearings; each time the parole board rejected his bid for parole.

Beausoleil attracted some women admirers while in prison. In 1980, he married a 21-year-old fan with whom he had corresponded. Within a year, she sought to annul the marriage, saying he had also been involved with other women.

On April 15, 1982, while incarcerated, Beausoleil was stabbed by other prisoners. After that point he reportedly began to lose his sense of loyalty to Manson and distance himself more from the &quot;family&quot;. He ceased to justify their actions and expressed more regret about what they had done.

In 1994, he requested and was transferred to the Oregon State Penitentiary. His wife, Barbara, whom he had met while in California, moved to Oregon to be near him. Bobby and Barbara had no children together, but she had children from a former marriage.
Following the death of his wife and having committed a disciplinary infraction in the Oregon prison, he was transferred back to California in 2015, to the California Medical Facility in Vacaville.

His parole bid was denied in 2016 in part because he was said to have been recording music for sale without permission from the California authorities. Oregon authorities had given him such permission, according to Gary Hinman&#x27;s cousin Kay Hinman Martley and Sharon Tate&#x27;s sister Debra Tate. These family members of victims of the Manson murders had been involved in the parole hearings and continued to oppose the release of Beausoleil.

On January 3, 2019, a panel of commissioners of the California Board of Parole recommended that Beausoleil be freed on parole. In recommending parole, the panel cited Beausoleil&#x27;s youthful offender status as having been a mitigating factor in his crime. They noted that, during his nearly half-century of incarceration, he had pursued creative outlets and pro-social growth, gradually maturing into a person exhibiting compassion and empathy. The Los Angeles District Attorney&#x27;s office disagreed, saying that the panel&#x27;s recommendation was &quot;unfortunate&quot;.

Kay Martley and Debra Tate also continued to oppose granting parole. Martley stated &quot;this man does not belong outside the walls of prison.&quot; Debra Tate repeated the allegation that Beausoleil had been violating prison rules by profiting from the sale of his music and art while in prison. She started a petition on Change.org to ask the governor to deny him parole. Beausoleil&#x27;s attorney responded to the comment about the music and art activities by saying that &quot;Everything he has produced so far was done with the full permission of the warden of his prior institutions.&quot;

As had been the case for several other Manson associates, Governor of California Gavin Newsom denied Beausoleil&#x27;s parole recommendation on April 26, 2019, saying he felt that Beausoleil&#x27;s release could still pose a danger to society. Six years later, a state parole board panel again recommended on January 7, 2025 that Beausoleil was suitable for a thorough and comprehensive parole review by the Board of Parole Hearings and Gov. Newsom.

As of 2023, only two people who have been convicted of murder in the killings committed by the Family have been released from prison: Steve &quot;Clem&quot; Grogan, who was paroled in 1985, and Leslie Van Houten, who was paroled in 2023. Several others, including Manson and Atkins, have died in prison. Bruce Davis remains incarcerated after having had seven recommendations for parole denied by California governors.

==Private life==
Beausoleil has three biological children.

==Film roles==
Beausoleil was to star in Kenneth Anger&#x27;s 1967 version of the film &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot;, but little footage was shot before the two had a falling out, and the project was abandoned. Some of the footage was later used in &quot;Invocation of My Demon Brother&quot; (and again in the resurrected &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot; film). Beausoleil appeared in the western-styled softcore porn film &quot;The Ramrodder&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Savage Passion&quot;), which also featured his friend Catherine Share. Share later became a full-fledged member of the Manson Family. This film was shot at a small ranch in Topanga Canyon.

Beausoleil at the age of 16 had a brief appearance as Cupid in the 1967 film &quot;Mondo Hollywood&quot;, a documentary about the social, political, and cultural climate of Los Angeles. It included a wide cast of Hollywood figures, including Manson Family murder victim, hair stylist Jay Sebring.

Beausoleil, with his prison band The Freedom Orchestra, completed his soundtrack for Kenneth Anger&#x27;s &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot; in 1979. The film premiered in New York in 1980.

==Music career==
In 1965, Beausoleil was a member of Arthur Lee&#x27;s band the Grass Roots. (This is not to be confused with the San Francisco Bay area recording artists of the same name.) To avoid confusion, Lee&#x27;s group later changed its name to &quot;Love&quot;. In early 1966, Beausoleil formed a band called The Orkustra. Bandmate violinist David LaFlamme later had success with his band It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day.

Incarcerated for most of his adult life, Beausoleil has nonetheless produced a significant body of musical recordings, visual art, and writings. Among his most notable works is the soundtrack for &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot;, an indie-underground film by Kenneth Anger, paired with a prog-rock symphony for a fallen angel&#x27;s mythical journey. To perform and record his score from prison, Beausoleil assembled The Magick Powerhouse of Oz band. 

The official Beausoleil soundtrack was originally released on LP by Lethal Records in 1980. A 2004 CD on the Arcanum label included archival material from The Orkustra and The Magick Powerhouse of Oz. The &quot;Lucifer Rising Suite&quot; released by The Ajna Offensive in 2009 documents the film&#x27;s soundtrack project from its beginnings in 1967 to its completion and delivery to the filmmaker in 1979. In addition to the soundtrack, some alternate themes, musical and soundscape experiments, and live performances are included in the boxed set; the anthology box set was released on CD in 2014.

Subsequent additional Beausoleil albums feature compositions often recorded in correlation to and released in conjunction with his drawings and paintings. The 2014 compilation &quot;Whispers Through The Black Veil&quot; was released on the Wyrd War label, containing the song &quot;The Wailing On Witch Mountain&quot;, composed, performed, and recorded in 2012. His most recent musical release is &quot;Voodoo Shivaya&quot; (2018), a 2-disk concept album recorded between 2008 and 2015. It features both covers and original songs with vocal and instrumental tracks showcasing Beausoleil&#x27;s instrumental and vocal skills. Guest performances, with the approval of the Oregon State Penitentiary administration, included Annabel Lee Moynihan, Michael Jenkins Moynihan, Robert Ferbrache, and Mike Behrenhausen, all members of the dark folk band Blood Axis. The triple gatefold LP and CD packaging integrates Nicholas Syracuse&#x27;s photography with calligraphy by Timo Ketola.

==Interviews==
Truman Capote interviewed Beausoleil in 1972, while the latter was imprisoned in San Quentin State Prison. Capote published the interview in the form of a short story &quot;Then It All Came Down&quot;, included in his 1980 book &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot;. According to his biographers, Capote believed his memory to be infallible and did not keep notes. Following the book&#x27;s publication, Beausoleil said that Capote took gross literary license in his reporting of the interview from eight years earlier.

<text>Thomas M. Siebel (; born November 20, 1952) is an American billionaire businessman, technologist, and author. He founded the enterprise software company Siebel Systems and is the founder, chairman, and CEO of C3.ai, an artificial intelligence software platform and applications company.

He is the chairman of First Virtual Group, a diversified holding company with interests in investment management, commercial real estate, agribusiness, and philanthropy.

==Early life and education==
Siebel was born in Chicago, one of seven children of Arthur Francis Siebel, a Harvard-educated lawyer, and Ruth A. (née Schmid) Siebel. Siebel is a graduate of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he received a BA in history, an MBA, an MS in computer science, and an honorary doctorate of engineering.

==Business career==
Between 1984 and 1990, Siebel was an executive at Oracle Corporation, where he held a number of management positions. Siebel served as chief executive officer of Gain Technology, a multimedia software company that merged with Sybase in December 1992. Siebel is the founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of Siebel Systems, which was acquired by Oracle in January 2006. Siebel is the chairman of First Virtual Group, a diversified holding company.

===Siebel Systems===
Siebel Systems was a software company primarily engaged in the design, development, marketing, and support of customer relationship management (CRM) applications. As an executive at Oracle Corporation, Siebel proposed the idea of creating enterprise software applications tailored for marketing, sales, and customer service functions. Oracle management declined his proposal. In 1993, Siebel left Oracle and founded Siebel Systems to pursue that opportunity. In 1999, Siebel Systems became one of the fastest-growing technology companies in the United States. Siebel Systems grew to over 8,000 employees in 32 countries, more than 4,500 corporate customers, and annual revenue greater than $2 billion before merging with Oracle in January 2006.

==Management philosophy==
In 2019, Siebel initiated a program at C3.ai that pays 100 percent of the costs for employees to complete an online master&#x27;s degree of computer science (MCS) program from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Employees who complete the MCS degree receive a salary increase of 15 percent, a cash bonus of $25‚000, and additional stock options.

==Honors and awards==
Siebel has held advisory and board positions at institutions including Stanford University, the University of Illinois, and the University of California, Berkeley. He was a Trustee at Princeton University from 2008 to 2011. He also chairs the American Agora Foundation and serves as a director at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. Siebel is the founder of the Montana Meth Project and the Siebel Scholars Foundation, both focused on public health and education initiatives. His philanthropic contributions have been recognized by publications such as &quot;Barron’s&quot;, which ranked him among the world’s top 25 philanthropists in 2009 and 2010, and &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;, which included him in its list of &quot;The 50 Most Generous Philanthropists&quot; in 2007 and 2008.

==Philanthropy==
In 2001, Siebel donated $32 million to his alma mater, the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, to build the Siebel Center for Computer Science, opened in spring 2004. In 2006, Siebel donated $4 million to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to establish two endowed full professorships, the &quot;Thomas M. Siebel Chair in the History of Science&quot; and the &quot;Thomas M. Siebel Chair in Computer Science.&quot; Siebel pledged an additional $100 million gift to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2007. In 2015, the Siebel Foundation launched the Siebel Energy Institute to research the data management of energy infrastructure monitoring data. In 2016, Siebel donated $25 million to build the Siebel Center for Design at the University of Illinois, a 60,000-square-foot multidisciplinary hub designed by architects Bohlin Cywinski Jackson and was completed in 2020. In 2024, Siebel donated $50 million to the University of Illinois to establish the Siebel School of Computing and Data Science.

==Political involvement==
In February 2022, Siebel donated $90,000 to the Canada convoy protest in Ottawa, that also blocked border crossings between Canada and the U.S. to protest COVID-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions.

In 2024, Siebel donated $500,000 to Donald Trump.

==Personal life==
He is married to Stacey Siebel. They have four children and live in Woodside, California. Siebel is the second cousin once removed of Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the First Partner of California and wife of Governor Gavin Newsom.

In 2022, Siebel had the highest personal emissions from private jet use of any American.

===Elephant incident===
On the morning of August 1, 2009, he and a guide were in Tanzania, observing a group of elephants from 200 yards away, when an elephant charged Siebel&#x27;s guide and then turned on Siebel, breaking several ribs, goring him in the left leg, and crushing the right. They radioed for help, but it was three hours before he received any medical treatment. He was flown to the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi, where they cleaned his wounds and stabilized his leg. He was then flown back to the United States on a 20-hour flight with 10 hours of morphine and 15 hours of fluids. He had lost half of his fluids and was put in the intensive care unit. He was moved to Stanford Hospital where, over the next six months, they performed 11 surgeries, fixed his ribs and shoulder, and saved his left leg.

In September 2010, a year after the attack, Siebel had undergone 16 surgeries and an Ilizarov apparatus external fixator to mend, lengthen, and reshape the tibia of his right leg. After 19 reconstructive surgeries over two and a half years, Siebel has now made a full recovery. In 2013, National Geographic included Siebel&#x27;s account in its TV series &quot;Dead or Alive: Trampled on Safari&quot;.

<doc id="1324589" wikidata="Q2866484" url="?curid=1324589" title="Ashburn, Chicago">
<text>Ashburn, one of Chicago&#x27;s 77 community areas, is located on the south side of the city. Greater Ashburn covers nearly five square miles. The approximate boundaries of Ashburn are 72nd Street (north), Western Avenue (east), 87th Street (south) and Cicero Avenue (west).

== History ==
Ashburn, which got its name as the dumping site for the city&#x27;s ashes, was slow to experience growth at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1893, the &quot;Clarkdale&quot; subdivision was planned near 83rd and Central Park Avenue along the new Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway, with only 19 homes built in the first 50 years. The early residents were Dutch, Swedish and Irish. Ashburn opened Ashburn Flying Field, the first airfield in Chicago, in 1916, becoming the home to the E. M. Laird Airplane Company. The marshy airfield closed in 1939. The post-World War II economic boom, the industrial boom of Ford City, and the baby boom all contributed to population growth in the 1950s and 1960s. Affordable home prices and proximity to the Chicago Loop helped the boom. Before Bogan High School was built, and before the area west of Pulaski Road was developed, ash &#x27;heaps&#x27; were visible in the area south of Ford City but north of 79th Street.

Along the southern edge of Ashburn, the square mile to the west is known as Scottsdale (due to the developer naming the area after his son, Scott) or St. Bede Parish. The center square mile is known as Ashburn or St. Denis Parish (which includes the now-defunct St. Denis Grammar School), and the easternmost square mile is known as Wrightwood, St. Thomas More Parish. The population of Greater Ashburn was predominantly Irish-Catholic until the 1990s when the area began to diversify with the migration of the African Americans moving in and the whites moving out. The economic landscape of the community began to suffer when the whites relocated, taking establishments that they often owned, out of the community. In the 1950s, St. Denis Grammar School served more than 2,000 children, many of whom were in classrooms of 40+ students each. Classes during the 1959 White Sox 1959 World Series were held in the basement of the school due to overcrowding. There were also two shifts of school grades for grade 4. The pastors at St. Denis (Father Doyle, Father Hanley and Father Fullmer) were devoted to expanding the facilities and serving the Catholics, but could never have enough classrooms to house all the Catholic children in the classrooms in the mid to late 1950s. There was a satellite school at Springfield Avenue &amp; 82nd Place in the early 1950s, and Dawes Elementary was filled, so much so that new schools, Carroll and Hancock, were built shortly after Dawes Elementary.

In 1999, &quot;The New York Times&quot; did an article on the Ashburn neighborhood as a case study in the difficulties of neighborhood integration in Chicago. Wrightwood, to the east, was the first section of the neighborhood to integrate, becoming predominantly African-American. Ashburn experienced a significant transition to a racially blended middle-class population of firefighters, police officers, teachers, and other city workers. Scottsdale, to the west, has remained predominately white.

A WBEZ report conducted in July 2017 regarding Ashburn&#x27;s continued segregation issues of becoming more segregated in time indicated, &quot;Ashburn has seen a lot of racial change since 1990 and appears to be integrated - at least on paper.&quot; It further states that Ashburn is the only neighborhood in Chicago with a dominant middle class black population, to add black residents from 2000 - 2010, at a time when black people have been leaving the city in droves.

== Neighborhoods ==

===Beverly View===
Beverly view is located in the far eastern section of Ashburn. The population was 996 and the racial makeup was 82.4% African American, 14.3% White, 1.1% Hispanic or Latino, 1.1% Asian, and 1.1% of Mixed Race. Beverly View is bounded by West 79th Street to the north, the CSX railroad line to the south and east, and Western Avenue to the west.

The most recent population for Wrightwood was 9,540 and the racial makeup for the neighborhood was 87.7% African American, 4.6% Hispanic or Latino, 4.1% of Mixed Race, and 3.6% White. Wrightwood is bounded by West Columbus Avenue to the north, 87th Street to the south, Western Avenue to the east, and Kedzie Avenue to the west.

===Marycrest===
Marycrest is located in the east central portion of Ashburn in Chicago. The most recent population for Marycrest was 541 and the racial makeup was 80.6% African American, 16.4% Hispanic or Latino, and 3.0% White.

Scottsdale is bounded by Cicero Avenue to the west, Pulaski Road to the east, 77th Street to the north, and 87th Street to the south.

===GADA===
In 2016, the Greater Ashburn Development Association (GADA) was created to replace the now defunct Greater Ashburn Planning Association (GAPA). They were created to bring the entire Ashburn community back together through concerted efforts of multi-organizational support. Its mission: to foster strategic relationships between the businesses and residents to create economic prosperity while partnering with surrounding communities and organizations to strengthen the forces against the challenges of potential blight, while continuing to seek a resolution to the mechanisms of gradual succession.

As a result of the formulation of GADA, Ashburn had its first Summer Extravaganza, turning out over 500 community residents, business owners, sponsors and supporters. In 2017, because of the efforts of GADA and the Ashburn community&#x27;s online neighborhood platform (NEXTdoor/Ashburn), they were the only predominantly African American community in Chicago to receive the Good Neighbor Award from the NEXTdoor organization, a nonprofit company whose mission is to support neighborhoods in becoming stronger advocates for themselves. Jen Burke, NEXTdoor staff writer, writes, &quot;Every day, we come across incredible stories of how neighbors are using Nextdoor to improve each other’s lives and their larger community - one neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, Ashburn, has done just that – in a big way&quot;.

==Transportation==
METRA&#x27;s SouthWest Service provides Monday–Saturday rail service at the Ashburn and Wrightwood railroad stations.

== Politics ==
Ashburn has strongly supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, Ashburn cast 14,929 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 1,690 votes for Donald Trump. In the 2012 presidential election, Ashburn Park cast 15,436 votes for Barack Obama and cast 1,718 votes for Mitt Romney.

Since at least the 1980s, the majority of Ashburn has been located in the 18th ward. As of the 2023-2033 decennial reapportionment of ward boundaries, Ashubrn is located entirely within the 18th ward. Derrick Curtis is currently Alderman of the 18th ward. Curtis also serves as the ward&#x27;s Democratic committeeperson. His Republican counterpart is Devin Jones.

<text>Siebel Systems, Inc. () was an American software company principally engaged in the design, development, marketing, and support of customer relationship management (CRM) applications—notably Siebel CRM.

The company was founded by Thomas Siebel and Patricia House in 1993. At first known mainly for its sales force automation products, the company expanded into the broader CRM market. By the late 1990s, Siebel Systems was the dominant CRM vendor, peaking at 45% market share in 2002.

On September 12, 2005, Oracle Corporation announced it had agreed to buy Siebel Systems for $5.8 billion. &quot;Siebel&quot; is now a brand name owned by Oracle Corporation.

Siebel Systems is Oracle&#x27;s on-premises CRM system, and Oracle&#x27;s cloud applications for CRM are Oracle Advertising and Customer Experience (CX).

==History==
Siebel Systems, Inc. began with sales force automation software, then expanded into marketing and customer service applications, including CRM. From the time it was founded in 1993, the company grew quickly.

Benefiting from the explosive growth of the CRM market in the late 1990s, Siebel Systems was named the fastest growing company in the United States in 1999 by Fortune magazine.

===Thomas Siebel, Pat House===
Siebel&#x27;s &quot;first experience with sales technology was in the late 1980s, when he worked for Oracle.&quot; At the time, &quot;Siebel Systems&quot; co-founder Patricia House also was working for Oracle. Siebel left Oracle to try his hand at a startup. In 1992 House left Oracle and together they worked on what became Siebel Systems (in 1993).

<doc id="1324605" wikidata="Q5471096" url="?curid=1324605" title="Fort Dummer">
<text>Fort Dummer was built in the winter of 1724 in what is now the Town of Brattleboro in southeastern Vermont. Today, it is notable as the first permanent European settlement in Vermont. The original site of the fort is now lost below the waters of the Connecticut River impoundment of the Vernon Dam.

==Establishment==
Fort Dummer was a British colonial fort built during Dummer&#x27;s War by the militia of the Province of Massachusetts Bay under the command of Lieutenant Timothy Dwight in what is now the Town of Brattleboro, in southeastern Vermont. This was in the heart of one of the three main sections of the Equivalent Lands.

The fort was the first permanent European settlement in Vermont. It consisted of a 180-square foot (17 m²) wooden stockade with 12 guns manned by 55 men (43 Massachusetts militiamen and 12 Mohawk warriors). It was named after Lieutenant Governor William Dummer, who was acting governor of Massachusetts at the time of the fort&#x27;s construction.

On October 11, 1724, seventy Abenakis attacked Fort Dummer and killed 3 or 4 militiamen in the only known military action involving the stockade.

Near the former site of the fort is a granite monument, which is one mile (2 km) south of the Brattleboro railway station.

==Fort Dummer State Park==
Fort Dummer State Park is part of the Vermont State Park system. It comprises 217 acres (878,000 m²) of forest in Brattleboro, Guilford &amp; Vernon.

The park overlooks the former site of Fort Dummer which was flooded when the Vernon Dam was built on the Connecticut River in 1908. The granite monument that commemorates the fort is not within the borders of the park. The monument itself was moved in 1908 to prevent it from being lost after the dam was completed. The original site of the fort can be seen from the northernmost scenic vista on the Sunrise Trail within the park. It is now underwater near the lumber company located on the western bank of the river.

Campground facilities include 50 tent/trailer sites and 10 lean-to sites, toilet buildings with hot showers, and a sanitary dump station. Other facilities include a small picnic area, three short hiking trails, one of which leads to a swimming hole, and a large open field.

<doc id="1324606" wikidata="Q1112916" url="?curid=1324606" title="White knight (business)">
<text>In business, a white knight is a friendly investor that acquires a corporation at a fair consideration with support from the corporation&#x27;s board of directors and management. This may be during a period while it is facing a hostile acquisition from another potential acquirer (black knight) or it is facing bankruptcy. White knights are preferred by the board of directors (when directors are acting in good faith with regards to the interest of the corporation and its shareholders) and/or management as in most cases as they do not replace the current board or management with a new board, whereas, in most cases, a black knight will seek to replace the current board of directors and/or management with its new board reflective of its net interest in the corporation&#x27;s equity.

The first type, the white knight, refers to the friendly acquirer of a target firm in a hostile takeover attempt by another firm. The intent of the acquisition is to circumvent the takeover of the object of interest by a third, unfriendly entity, which is perceived to be less favorable. The knight might defeat the undesirable entity by offering a higher and more enticing bid, or strike a favorable deal with the management of the object of acquisition.

The second type refers to the acquirer of a struggling firm that may not necessarily be under threat by a hostile firm. The financial standing of the struggling firm could prevent any other entity being interested in an acquisition. The firm may already have huge debts to pay to its creditors, or worse, may already be bankrupt. In such a case, the knight, under huge risk, acquires the firm in crisis. After acquisition, the knight then rebuilds, or integrates the firm.

A number of variations of the term have been used and these include: a &quot;gray knight&quot; which is an acquiring corporation or individual that enters a bid for a hostile takeover in addition to the target firm and first bidder, perceived as more favorable than the &quot;black knight&quot; (unfriendly bidder), but less favorable than the white knight (friendly bidder). Also, a &quot;white squire&quot;, which is similar to a white knight except it only exercises a significant minority stake, as opposed to a majority stake. A white squire does not have the intention, but rather serves as a figurehead in defense of a hostile takeover. The white squire may often also get special voting rights for their equity stake.

==Hostile firms&#x27; strategies==
* The strategy that is usually employed by a hostile firm is making an offer more lucrative than the white knight&#x27;s, so that the shareholders consider rejecting the white knight&#x27;s bid. This, however, can lead to bidding wars and finally to overpaying, by one or the other, for the target firm.
* Another option is known as the &quot;NL strategy&quot;. Here, the hostile firm allows the white knight to move ahead and waits for the acquisition to take place. Once things are settled between the two entities, the hostile firm launches a takeover offer for the white knight. This takeover offer is generally a hostile one. The target (firm being bid on) can enter into with the white knight to prevent it from turning into a gray knight.

==Examples==
* 1953 – United Paramount Theaters buys nearly bankrupt ABC
* 1980 – Renault buys a controlling stake in American Motors, which saves the struggling American automaker from bankruptcy 
* 1982 – Allied Corporation buys Bendix Corporation in a situation involving the &quot;Pac-Man defense&quot;. Allied is drafted in when the company that Bendix tries a hostile takeover on fights back by buying up Bendix stock in attempt to create a reverse hostile takeover.
* 1984 – Chevron Corporation acquired Gulf Oil after Gulf tried being a white knight to Citgo in 1982 in order for Citgo to avoid a hostile takeover by T. Boone Pickens. Pickens then turned his attention to Gulf, leading to the Chevron–Gulf deal.
* 1984 – Sid Bass and his sons buying significant interest in Walt Disney Productions as a defense against Saul Steinberg&#x27;s hostile bid for the company.
* 1987 – Kluwer Publishers merges with Wolters Samson as a defensive move against an attempted hostile takeover of Kluwer by Elsevier
* 1998 – Compaq merges with financially weak DEC
* 2001 – Dynegy attempts to merge with Enron to cover Enron&#x27;s massive debts (the merger failed as it became obvious that Enron had been committing fraud, resulting in the Enron scandal)
* 2003 – SAP was seen by analysts as the most likely to help defeat Oracle&#x27;s hostile bid for PeopleSoft, but it came to nothing
* 2006 – Severstal almost acted as a white knight to Arcelor as the merger negotiations were in place between Arcelor and Mittal Steel Company
* 2006 – Bayer acted as a white knight to Schering as the merger negotiations were in place between Schering and Merck KGaA
* 2007 – Nissin Foods launches a friendly 37bn yen ($314m; £166m) bid for Myojo Foods after US hedge fund Steel Partners offered 29bn yen to buy the firm.
* 2008 – JPMorgan Chase acquires Bear Stearns allowing Bear Stearns to avoid insolvency after Bear Stearns stock price suffered a precipitous decline, with its market capitalization dropping by 92%.
* 2008 – Volkswagen acquires Porsche, after Porsche launched a hostile takeover of Volkswagen by purchasing enough Volkswagen shares to control 75% of the company at one point. During the financial crisis, Porsche ran out of funding and was at risk of insolvency. Volkswagen both performed a Pac-Man defense and acted as a white knight to Porsche by lending them enough money to stay solvent, with the consequence being that Porsche was absorbed into Volkswagen. This unusual situation occurred because of the shared history between the two companies, and that the chairman of Volkswagen at the time was Ferdinand Piëch, a descendant of Ferdinand Porsche, a co-founder of Volkswagen before founding his eponymous company, and Piëch&#x27;s family had deep ties to both companies.
* 2008 – PNC Financial Services buys National City Corp. after National City was denied TARP funds in order to stay afloat due to increasing concerns that National City would fail due to the subprime mortgage crisis
* 2009 – Fiat S.p.A. takes over Chrysler, saving the struggling automaker from liquidation. The two companies eventually merge into Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.
* 2022 – FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was called the &quot;White Knight of Crypto&quot; due to bailing out struggling cryptocurrency entities. He was also called the &quot;J. P. Morgan of crypto&quot;, as J. P. Morgan had spent a considerable amount of his own money to shore up the banking system in the Panic of 1907. Ironically, FTX would spectacularly implode months later after FTX faced huge liquidity issues, for which Bankman-Fried himself would be arrested.

<text>In finance, a buyout is an investment transaction by which the ownership equity, or a controlling interest of a company, or a majority share of the capital stock of the company is acquired. The acquirer thereby &quot;buys out&quot; the present equity holders of the target company. A buyout will often include the purchasing of the target company&#x27;s outstanding debt, which is referred to as &quot;assumed debt&quot; by the purchaser. It is usually synonymous with &quot;acquisition&quot;.

==Non-finance usage==
The term may apply more generally to the purchase by one party of all of the rights of another party with respect to an ongoing transaction between the two. For example:
*An employer may &quot;buy out&quot; an employee&#x27;s contract by making a single prepayment, so as to have no ongoing obligation to employ the person;
*A landlord may buy out the remainder of a tenant&#x27;s lease, effectively paying them to vacate.
*A government may buy out homes in a floodplain or other area subject to hazard. The language used by FEMA, a United States agency, is &quot;acquisition&quot;.
*In Major League Baseball, a club option is an optional year at the end of the ballplayer&#x27;s contract that may be guaranteed at the discretion of the team. Usually, the option comes with a &quot;buyout&quot; which represents a fraction of the value of the option. If at the time that the club is in a position to exercise its option and the team decides not to exercise the option, the team will usually pay the buyout and decline the option. Generally, this results in the ballplayer becoming eligible to be a free agent. Alternatively, if the contract turned one of the ballplayer&#x27;s arbitration-eligible seasons into an option season, the team can decline the option with the ballplayer then entering the arbitration process instead.
*In real estate, a landlord has the opportunity to buy out their tenant on a mutually agreed upon price. Most of the time, landlords use buyouts to remove rent-stabilized tenants and move in a tenant who will pay a higher rent. This type of buyout can create benefits for both parties.

<doc id="1324615" wikidata="Q6683227" url="?curid=1324615" title="Los Rieleros del Norte">
<text>Los Rieleros del Norte (&quot;The Railers of the North&quot;) are a Mexican three-time Grammy-nominated regional Mexican band from Ojinaga, Chihuahua, Mexico. They are based in El Paso, Texas, United States, and specialize in the norteño-sax genre.

==History==
They formed the band in Ojinaga, Chihuahua, in 1980 and later moved to Texas. The band&#x27;s name, &quot;Los Rieleros&quot;, is based on work that some members did on the railroads of Pecos, Texas. All original members of the band are natives of Ojinaga, Chihuahua, a town from which several other norteño-sax bands originated.

Currently, the band&#x27;s lead vocalist is Daniel Esquivel; the other members include Daniel&#x27;s sons Daniel Esquivel Jr. and José Luis Esquivel playing the button accordion and bajo sexto, respectively; Daniel&#x27;s older brother Alfredo Esquivel playing drums; Alfredo&#x27;s son José Ángel Esquivel playing electric bass; and Daniel and Alfredo&#x27;s younger brother Javier Esquivel playing the alto saxophone. Original and longtime saxophonist Eugenio &quot;Pemo&quot; González was officially replaced by Javier Esquivel in 2024. From 1985 through 1994, Polo Urías was the band&#x27;s lead singer and bassist, but he left to form his own band, &quot;Polo Urías y su Maquina Norteña&quot;. Several years ago, the Rieleros ensemble had two bajo sexto players, one of whom was Manolo Morales – who eventually left to form his own band, Los Rieles. Los Rieleros del Norte also helped spin off La Maquinaria Norteña, which featured three former members of the Polo Urías band. They also inspired Esquivel&#x27;s singer/songwriter and producer cousin, Isac Esquivel, to join Sonic Ranch Studios, along with Christopher Schoemann and Christopher M. Carzoli.

Los Rieleros del Norte have recorded many albums over the years. These include; &quot;Estampida Norteña&quot;, &quot;Prieta Orgullosa&quot;, &quot;Aventura Pasada&quot;, and many other albums which have now become classics in regional Mexican music. Among their many songs, &quot;El Columpio&quot;, &quot;Te Quiero Mucho&quot;, &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot;, &quot;No le Digas a Nadie&quot;, &quot;En la Puerta de Esa Casa&quot;, &quot;Una Aventura&quot; and, &quot;Copa Sin Vino&quot; are just some of their many singles, which have topped the regional Mexican music charts. &quot;Sobre los Rieles&quot; was released in September 2004, featuring the hit &quot;Tu Nuevo Cariñito&quot;. In July 2005, &quot;Que el Mundo Ruede&quot; was released as the Rieleros&#x27; newest album. In 2006, &quot;Siempre Imitado Jamas Igualado&quot; was released, featuring the song &quot;Voy a Llorar Por Ti&quot;, and on June 26, 2007, their album, &quot;Ven y Dime: 25 años&quot; was released, featuring the single &quot;Un Juego&quot;. On May 27, 2008.

The actual founder of the band and its name is subject to controversy. Many fans had assumed that it was bassist Manalo Morales, but that probably is not true. Current leader Daniel Esquivel and Manolo Morales himself reportedly denied this in a morning radio show called &quot;Piolín por la Mañana,&quot; acknowledging that Manuel &quot;Meño&quot; Lujan of Pecos is the original founder who named the group.

Lujan has maintained a low profile on this issue, so far preferring not to assert any legal right to ownership of the band&#x27;s name. Meanwhile, the others have proceeded in court to establish control over the band. The group filed a suit in the Western District of Texas against Morales, &quot;Los Rieleros del Norte, Inc. v. Morales et al&quot;, on March 21, 2007, for trademark infringement, to clarify this issue. Kathleen Cardone, a federal judge in El Paso, Texas, then gave all rights to Daniel Esquivel. The court order made Esquivel the rightful owner of the group and prohibited Morales from having any type of connection with the band, though Morales is rumored to have used the name of the group occasionally anyway. Armed with the court order, Esquivel consolidated his control of the band. His position was strengthened in early 2009 when, after seven years of litigation, the Mexican courts also held that he was the band&#x27;s rightful owner. The court order prohibited Morales from using the name Los Rieleros and prohibited him from performing any songs recorded by the group from 2002 onwards without permission. These decisions together gave Daniel Esquivel full ownership of the band in both the United States and Mexico. Esquivel later stated in a press conference that he was willing to work with Morales and his crew and even help them to record an album of their own material, as long as they used a different name for their group. So far, there is no indication that this ever happened.

<doc id="1324620" wikidata="Q1687749" url="?curid=1324620" title="Jerome Kohlberg Jr.">
<text>Jerome Kohlberg Jr. (July 10, 1925 – July 30, 2015) was an American businessman and investor. He was an early pioneer in the private equity and leveraged buyout industries founding private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and later Kohlberg &amp; Company.

==Early life and education==
Kohlberg was raised in a Jewish family graduating from New Rochelle High School in New Rochelle, New York. Kohlberg served in the United States Navy during World War II and went on to college and graduate school on the GI Bill. He earned an undergraduate degree from Swarthmore College. He later received an MBA from Harvard Business School and an LLB from Columbia Law School. In 1986, he founded the Philip Evans Scholarship Foundation at Swarthmore.

==Career==

===Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.===
Kohlberg joined Bear Stearns in 1955 where he would go on to manage the corporate finance department. Working for Bear Stearns in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Kohlberg, alongside Bear Stearns executives began advising a series of what they described as &quot;bootstrap&quot; investments. Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is considered to have been among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973) as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Although they had a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy. Kravis and his associates created a series of limited partnerships to acquire these various corporations, ones they judged were performing well below their sales and profit potential or where there were untapped financial assets that could be monetized. In most cases, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co put up ten percent of the acquisition price from its own funds and borrowed the rest from investors by issuing high-yield bonds.

By 1976 tensions had built up between Bear Stearns and the trio of Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts leading to their departure and the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in that year. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns and Lewis took exception to the amount of time spent on outside activities. Early investors in KKR included the Hillman Family Group of Henry Hillman and the Hillman Company. By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising its first institutional fund with approximately $30 million of investor commitments.

===Kohlberg &amp; Company===

In 1987 Kohlberg resigned from KKR over differences in strategy and Henry Kravis and George Roberts assumed full leadership of the firm. Kohlberg did not favor the large buyouts (which would likely have included the 1989 takeover of RJR Nabisco) or hostile takeovers. Instead, Kohlberg chose to return to his roots, acquiring smaller, middle-market companies and, in 1987, founded a new private equity firm Kohlberg &amp; Company. As of the end of 2007 Kohlberg &amp; Company had raised six private equity funds since its inception, with approximately $3.7 billion of investor commitments. Additionally, Kohlberg also operated a series of debt investment funds under the banner of Katonah Debt Advisors, as well as a publicly traded investment vehicle Kohlberg Capital (NASDAQ:KCAP). Kohlberg retired from Kohlberg &amp; Company in 1994.

Kohlberg died of cancer on July 30, 2015, on Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, twenty days after his 90th birthday.

==Philanthropy==

Kohlberg participated in philanthropy through the Kohlberg Foundation.

<text>Modriča () is a town and municipality in Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina. As of 2013 census, the town has a population of 10,137 inhabitants, while the municipality has a population of 25,720 inhabitants.

==History==

The first written document about Modriča is a 13th century charter of Hungarian King Bela IV in which Modriča is mentioned as a spring: &quot;...fons Modricha, ubi cadit in Boznam (&quot;...the spring of Modricha, where it falls into the Boznam&quot;)&quot;; this indicates that it was a minor stream which was flowing into the Bosna river. According to traditional stories, Modriča was named after a small river with blue, mountain water. It is assumed that the small river is Dusa. According to other narratives, the area bears the name of Old Slavic marks of the blue sky and distances, which are more discerned on the horizon than visible – modrina (blue/bruise-like)/modriča.

There is archaeological evidence of human presence in the territory of present-day Modriča municipality back in the Paleolithic — Old Stone Age. This is evidenced by traces discovered at the Gradina site in the village of Dugo Polje above the valley of the Bosna river.
Traces of ancient Neolithic farmers were found in several places, among others at the locations of Kulište in Kruškovo Polje, Ždralovo Brdo in the village of Kladari, Prljaca, then in the villages of Vranjak, Kužnjača, Skugrić, Dugo Polje, etc. There is an important site at Dobor hill with seven archaeological layers of the Iron Age. Traces of Old Slavic settlements can be found in several places in the Modriča municipality. In the charter of Kotromanić from 1323 the Nenavište Parish is mentioned with the settlements of Modriča and Jakeš.

The events that were developing around the Dobor fortress presaged the end of Bosnia&#x27;s independence. Those were conflicts with the Hungarians in 1393/94 and 1408, and the removal of 170 Bosnian boyars from the ramparts of the fort. These areas then became a cruel war frontier in the onslaught of the Turks, and they won Dobor and Modriča in 1536. After the defeat of the Turks at Vienna in 1683, Modriča was the border area the next two centuries, which meant it was a zone of conflicts, rebellions, devastation and economic stagnation. During the Austro-Hungarian rule, Modriča was included in a list of 66 towns that Bosnia and Herzegovina had at that time.

In the second half of the 19th century economic, cultural and educational conditions were slowly improving. According to archives, schools had existed since at least the 19th century, maybe even since the end of the 18th century. Modriča had a nursery school in the rural area. 

From 1929 to 1939, Modriča was part of the Vrbas Banovina and from 1939 to 1941 of the Banovina of Croatia within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

Conditions improved in the second half of 20th century, with a contributing factor being the Šamac-Sarajevo railroad, built in 1947, that passed through the town, with a branch line Modriča-Gradačac built in 1951. Some factories in the city were also built: an oil refinery, factories of paper and plastic boxes Pamo and Plastmo, a flour mill, the &quot;Vjekoslav Bakulić&quot; shoe factory, the &quot;Hemija&quot; chemical cleaning company and the small &quot;8th of September&quot; wood factory, together with the required town infrastructure (residential buildings, a secondary school, a sports hall). The &quot;Dr. Mujbegović (later Petar Mrkonjić)&quot; wheat and cattle farm was also expanded. The &quot;Modriča&quot; volleyball team won the national championship of Yugoslavia in 1979.

After the 1992–95 Bosnian War, the pre-war municipal borders were changed, the villages of Jakeš, Pećnik and Modrički Lug were excluded from Modriča and included in the new Vukosavlje municipality, and a few villages from the western part of the pre-war Gradačac municipality were included in the Modriča municipality, thus the size of the municipality changed substantially.

<text>Leon Levine (June 8, 1937 – April 5, 2023) was an American businessman and philanthropist who founded Family Dollar. He resided in Charlotte, North Carolina.

==Early life==
Leon Levine was born into a Jewish family on June 8, 1937, in Wadesboro, North Carolina. The family actually lived in Rockingham, North Carolina, but that town, some 19 miles away from Wadesboro, had no hospital at that time. The family operated a small town store called The Hub, managed by his brother Sherman and his mother until its closure in 1960.

In 1949, when Leon was 12, his father died from a heart attack; that loss led him to become closer to his mother than before. In 1951, Sherman was drafted by the U. S. Army to fight in the Korean War, requiring Leon to assume his responsibilities at the store. This necessitated him to attend school only during the morning hours, while working in the afternoon, something permitted by North Carolina law then.

==Career==
In 1956, Leon and Sherman purchased a Chenille bedspread factory in Wingate, North Carolina. Much like he did during high school, Leon attended nearby Wingate College during the morning so he could manage the factory for the rest of the day. After a discouraging sales trip to New York, Leon nonetheless persisted and was able to develop a market for his bedspreads in Puerto Rico. In 1958, Levine, realizing he would have to make a major capital investment in new equipment in order to stay competitive, sold the company.
In 1959 he visited a store in Kentucky that sold nothing costing more than a dollar. He liked the simple concept and in November 1959, at age 22, he opened a similar store in the 1500 block of Central Avenue in Charlotte, a place that sold items with a $2 ($21 in 2023 money) maximum price. He named it Family Dollar for the affordability of its merchandise and the demographic that it was aimed towards. Levine capitalized Family Dollar with $3,000 ($31,014 in 2023 money) of his own money and $3,000 from a partner.

In June 1960, Levine opened a second store, also in Charlotte, next door to a Park &#x27;n Shop store on Wilkinson Boulevard. Later that year he opened a third store in Charlotte, followed by another one, in Hamlet, North Carolina. That same year, due to inflation, he realized that the $2 price cap was not feasible, and he increased it to $3 ($30 in 2023 money), a ceiling he kept until 1972. The company grew rapidly; by 1961, Family Dollar had expanded into neighboring South Carolina. In 1962, Family Dollar did some $2 million ($19.9 million in 2023 money) in business, and moved into the Augusta, Georgia market. Around this time, Levine went solo, buying out his partner&#x27;s interest in the company. By the end of 1979 Family Dollar had 380 stores in eight states.

In 1974, Family Dollar moved its administrative and warehouse space to a newly built facility in Matthews, North Carolina. In 1970, Levine decided to put Family Dollar public on the stock exchange. Two years later, Family Dollar&#x27;s common stock began trading on the American Stock Exchange.

==Personal life==
During a summer vacation to Florida in 1957, Levine met Barbara Leven, who lived in Chicago; they married in February 1958. Their three children were Howard Russel, born on Christmas Day 1958; Lori Ann, born in December 1960; and Mindy Ellen, born in August 1963. Barbara died in 1966 from breast cancer; Mindy died by suicide in 1988.

Twelve years after his first wife died, on June 5, 1978, Levine married Sandra Poliakoff. They had met in the 1960s while Sandra was friends with his first wife, Barbara. After some years of having lost touch, he renewed his friendship with her in 1975. Their daughter, Amy, was born in June 1981. Levine and Poliakoff had been involved in numerous charitable and philanthropic causes. She has served on the Board of Commissioners of the Carolinas Healthcare System. The couple had 10 grandchildren. He was a member of the North Carolina Business Hall of Fame and belonged to Charlotte&#x27;s Temple Israel, which named its social hall after him.

In 2003, he retired as Chairman and CEO of Family Dollar. He was succeeded by his son, Howard, who served until January 2016.

Levine started The Leon Levine Foundation, which aims to improve the general welfare throughout the Carolinas. The organization invests in nonprofit organizations that have strong leadership, a successful track record, and a focus on sustainability in the areas of health care, education, Jewish values and human services. Leon and Sandra were members of the Board of Directors, serving as President and Vice-President, respectively.

Levine died in Charlotte on April 5, 2023, at the age of 85.

<text>Popworld is a British television programme that was broadcast on Channel 4 as part of the T4 strand, featuring pop news, trivia, gossip, interviews and music videos, as well as musical performances from contemporary artists.

The show began on 21 January 2001 and was initially presented by Miquita Oliver and Simon Amstell. Alex Zane and Alexa Chung took over the hosting role in 2006. &quot;Popworld&quot; was broadcast every Sunday morning on Channel 4 at 10:30am, and repeated on E4 at 2:00pm the following day.

On 27 April 2007, Channel 4 announced they would not be recommissioning the show, and after six years on air, &quot;Popworld&quot; ended on 14 July 2007.

==History==

&quot;Popworld&quot; began in 2000 as a website founded by pop mogul Simon Fuller, and the accompanying show (first transmitted daily at teatime on E4) was originally intended for a pre-adolescent audience. The show&#x27;s original hosts were Nickelodeon presenter Simon Amstell and 16-year-old Miquita Oliver. The original ratings for the programme were dismal, but as Amstell and Oliver gradually warmed to each other (their relationship was strained in the early days) and had greater control of what they could say, the ratings improved. &quot;Popworld&quot; finally made it on to T4 (Channel 4&#x27;s youth strand) in the spring of 2001. In the early series, the show featured Leigh Francis as the character Barry Gibson.

During Amstell and Oliver&#x27;s tenure on the show, it often used surreal humour and small references to Jewish culture in the United Kingdom; for example, Amstell had been shown reading &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, as well as making references to festivals and customs. Since its inception, the show gradually grew more and more dry and sarcastic, with singers and bands being subtly, and by 2004 more overtly, mocked. By the end of Amstell and Oliver&#x27;s tenure on the show, it had gained a cult following as the alternative to limitlessly enthusiastic programmes such as &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Notable events that occurred during their tenure included openly gay Amstell coming on to homophobic reggae star Beenie Man, and Britney Spears walking out of an interview in tears. The Kooks refused to do an interview on their second appearance on the show, after Amstell&#x27;s repeated references to the singer&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Katie Melua during their first interview.

In February 2006, Amstell and Oliver announced they would be leaving the show. Following their departure episode, Alex Zane and Alexa Chung took over presenting until its series finale in July 2007.

==Magazine==
&quot;Popworld&quot; launched a magazine of the same name in 2003, but production was stopped after just one year.

In late 2006, it was announced that &quot;Popworld&quot; was launching a weekly magazine called &quot;Popworld Pulp&quot;. 130,000 copies were produced for launch, which took place in April 2007. After only a week, it was axed due to selling only 7% of its newsagent allocation, despite a £1.49 cover price and a wide promotional campaign. Two weeks later, the show, too, announced it was ending.

<text>Dieter von Holtzbrinck (born 29 September 1941 in Stuttgart) is one of the heirs to the Holtzbrinck publishing empire, founded by his father Georg von Holtzbrinck (1909–1983) in 1948. In 2006, his wealth was estimated at around US$1 billion.

He was a director of Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., until he resigned on 19 July 2007, showing his disagreement with the takeover of the company by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp.

== Biography ==
Dieter von Holtzbrinck is the elder son of the publisher and entrepreneur Georg von Holtzbrinck (1909–1983) and his wife Addy von Holtzbrinck, née Griesenbeck (1913–2005). His sisters were Monika Schoeller (1939–2019) and Karin von Holtzbrinck (1943–2006). Stefan von Holtzbrinck (born 1963) is his half-brother.

Holtzbrinck studied economics at the University of St. Gallen and completed an eighteen-month publishing internship in the USA. In 1970, he joined Handelsblatt GmbH as managing partner. This belonged to his father Georg von Holtzbrinck&#x27;s publishing group, who founded the media company in 1931 and led it to success during the Nazi era. In 1980, he took over from his father as chairman of the entire publishing group. In 2001, he handed over operational management to his 22-year-younger half-brother Stefan von Holtzbrinck and took over as chairman of the supervisory board.

In mid-2006, Dieter von Holtzbrinck retired from the company. He began gradually transferring his assets to a family foundation. At this time, his private wealth was estimated at 1.0 billion US dollars. With this, he ranked 54th in the list of the richest Germans in 2006. The Forbes list of the world&#x27;s richest people in 2010 ranked him 828th with assets of 1.3 billion US dollars.

In 2007, Dieter von Holtzbrinck unsuccessfully tried to acquire the Süddeutsche Zeitung with investors.

On June 1, 2009, Dieter von Holtzbrinck sold his shares in the publishing group to his half-brother Stefan and his sister Monika Schoeller, each now holding 50 percent. In return, Dieter von Holtzbrinck took the influential national daily newspapers into his newly founded Dieter von Holtzbrinck Medien GmbH (DvH Medien): all shares in the Handelsblatt publishing group, which also includes the prestigious magazine Wirtschaftswoche, the Tagesspiegel group, and 50 percent of the publisher of the weekly newspaper Die Zeit, the operational management of which was taken over by DvH Medien. The daily newspapers with only regional significance (Saarbrücker Zeitung group) initially remained with the Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck.

Until Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s entry in 2007, Holtzbrinck was a member of the Corporate Governance Committee of the board of directors of the US publisher Dow Jones. With his resignation, Holtzbrinck protested against the takeover by Murdoch. He had been a member of the committee since 2001.

<doc id="1324651" wikidata="Q507007" url="?curid=1324651" title="Pandora's Box (band)">
<text>Pandora&#x27;s Box was a female pop group, assembled by Jim Steinman in the 1980s. Some of its members had previously worked with Steinman, in the ensemble Fire Inc., on the album &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, on live shows and on other studio recordings. They produced one concept album, &quot;Original Sin&quot;, released in 1989.

==Line-up==
The listed members, whose photos were put on the album, were Elaine Caswell, Ellen Foley, Gina Taylor, Deliria Wilde and Jim Steinman, who was listed as a keyboardist. The album credits two more artists with lead vocals on songs: Laura Theodore and Holly Sherwood. Additionally, backing vocals were performed by Rory Dodd, Eric Troyer and Todd Rundgren.

Foley had worked with Steinman on &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; and &quot;Neverland&quot;. Holly Sherwood was a member of his group Fire Inc. Caswell has worked with Steinman on many projects, including The Dream Engine. In 2005 and 2006, she performed &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot; at shows called Over the Top and The Dream Engine, respectively, at Joe&#x27;s Pub in New York City.

Gina Taylor is also known as Gina Taylor Pickens, and was previously a stage actress off-Broadway and member of the band Musique. She previously worked with Steinman as part of the background vocals on the track &quot;This Corrosion&quot; by the Sisters of Mercy.

Jim Steinman said that Pandora&#x27;s box was one of his favorite mythologies.

Elaine Caswell stated in interview (in 2018) that Pandora&#x27;s Box was &quot;four women; three that existed and [...] Deliria Wilde who was somewhat mythical, someone [Steinman] kind of created&quot;.

<text>William Levy (January 10, 1939 – April 22, 2019), also known as the Talmudic Wizard of Amsterdam, was an American writer, editor, and former radio personality, plus the author of such works as &quot;The Virgin Sperm Dancer&quot;, &quot;Wet Dreams&quot;, &quot;Certain Radio Speeches of Ezra Pound&quot; and &quot;Natural Jewboy&quot;.

Before leaving the U.S. in the autumn of 1966 aboard the R.M.S Queen Mary, Levy attended the University of Maryland, College Park and Temple University, and taught in the literature department at Shippensburg State College, in Pennsylvania. 

In the Sixties and Seventies, he was founder and chief editor of many magazines, including the &quot;Insect Trust Gazette&quot;, &quot;International Times&quot;, &quot;Suck&quot;, and &quot;The Fanatic&quot;.

<doc id="1324663" wikidata="Q836752" url="?curid=1324663" title="My-HiME">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series produced by Sunrise. Directed by Masakazu Obara and written by Hiroyuki Yoshino, it premiered in Japan on TV Tokyo from September 2004 to March 2005. The series focuses on the lives of HiMEs—girls with the capacity to materialize photons—gathered at Fuka Academy for secret purposes.

The series was licensed for North American distribution by Bandai Entertainment and European distribution by Bandai&#x27;s European subsidiary, Beez, with the first American DVD released in March 2006. Bandai released the Complete Collection DVD set in America on October 7, 2008. It is also shown on iaTV in the mid-2000s and on Comcast’s Anime Selects on Demand for a limited time. At Otakon 2013, Funimation had announced that it acquired the series, along with a handful of other former BEI titles. They also announced at the 2017 New York Comic Con that they would release &quot;My-HiMe&quot;, &quot;My-Otome&quot;, and a &quot;My-Otome Zwei&quot; + &quot;My-Otome 0: S.ifr&quot; pack, all on Blu-Ray + DVD combo packs on January 8, 2018.

==Plot==

The story centers on Mai Tokiha, a seemingly ordinary high-school girl who has recently transferred to the prestigious Fuuka Academy with her younger brother, Takumi. The elite Fuuka Academy harbors a number of mysteries, involving both fellow students and staff. As they arrive at the Academy, Mai finds herself bound to a Child, a part-spiritual, part-mechanical creature, that can only be summoned and controlled by girls with the HiME mark.

Mai is told that she is one of twelve girls who have the aforementioned mark, and that they must use their powers to protect everyone from Orphans, monstrous creatures with abilities similar to the HiME&#x27;s Children. Mai is very reluctant to become involved at first, because of her protective role towards her brother, but the other HiME quickly begin to manifest around her, each with very different motivations and goals for using (or not using) her powers. As the Orphans become more numerous and aggressive, Mai joins the other HiME&#x27;s fight against them to protect those around her, including her friends, who are even drawn into the conflict as well. However, Mai and the other HiME soon find out the Orphans are not the only kind of enemy they have to fight, and as the cause of all of this is revealed, they find themselves facing the dark secret about their destiny.

==Characters==

The series features a group of students and staff at Fuuka Academy, with the emphasis on the female cast. Although most of them were introduced by the second episode, only a few characters are disclosed as HiMEs; the other characters&#x27; abilities and alignments are revealed throughout the rest of the series.

The main characters are the hardworking, caring Mai Tokiha, the catlike Mikoto Minagi, and the cold beauty Natsuki Kuga. Other ones are shown with a wide range of personalities and relationships. Obara stated that he &quot;wanted to reverse the roles that men and women usually play,&quot; making the actresses take leading roles.

*Mai is the protagonist of the series. She is portrayed as a self-reliant person, often hesitant to tell others about her problems. She is a first-year high school student, and her roommate is Mikoto Minagi. Her stated hobbies are working part-time jobs and taking care of Takumi.
*Mikoto is a third-grade middle school student who behaves very much like a cat. She loves to be with Mai, often at her side or clinging to her. She also has a problem with spicy food, and consuming it will often send her into rampages while looking for water.
*Natsuki is typically portrayed as a serious, rational blue-haired female. Though she does not work with Mikoto neither Mai, the three become friends as the series progresses.

==Related media==
A manga series was developed by Sunrise. It was first serialized in Akita Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Shōnen Champion&quot; and later published in North America by TOKYOPOP. It follows an alternate storyline at Fuka Academy where Mai, Mikoto and Natsuki become roommates.

An anime spin-off, entitled , aired in Japan from October 2005 to March 2006. The series featured some of the same characters from the previous one, but it is set in a far future timeline.

A PlayStation 2 video game, was developed by Marvelous Interactive and released in Japan on June 30, 2005. The adventure game follows a storyline different from the anime and manga series. A remake, &quot;Mai-Hime - Unmei no Keitouju Shura&quot;, was released for the PC.

Two PlayStation Portable fighting games, and , both developed by Sunrise Interactive, were also released.

A parody trailer for a &quot;Mai-Hime&quot; movie was included in the first DVD of &quot;Mai-Otome&quot;, with the title &quot;Fuuka Wars&quot; or &quot;The Great Battle of Fuuka&quot; with a release date of 20006[sic].

A second manga series titled was developed by Sunrise. It was first serialized in &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; in 2010.

<doc id="1324664" wikidata="Q27575" url="?curid=1324664" title="Color rendering index">
<text>A color rendering index (CRI) is a quantitative measure of the ability of a light source to reveal the colors of various objects faithfully in comparison with a natural or standard light source.

&quot;Color rendering&quot;, as defined by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE), is the effect of an illuminant on the color appearance of objects by conscious or subconscious comparison with their color appearance under a reference or standard illuminant.

The CRI of a light source does not indicate the apparent color of the light source; that information is given by the correlated color temperature (CCT). The CRI is determined by the light source&#x27;s spectrum. An incandescent lamp has a continuous spectrum, a fluorescent lamp has a discrete line spectrum; implying that the incandescent lamp has the higher CRI.

The value often quoted as &quot;CRI&quot; on commercially available lighting products is properly called the CIE Ra value, &quot;CRI&quot; being a general term and CIE Ra being the international standard color rendering index.

Numerically, the highest possible CIE Ra value is 100 and would only be given to a source whose spectrum is identical to the spectrum of daylight, very close to that of a black body (incandescent lamps are effectively black bodies), dropping to negative values for some light sources. Low-pressure sodium lighting has a negative CRI; fluorescent lights range from about 50 for the basic types, up to about 98 for the best multi-phosphor type. Typical white-color LEDs have a CRI of 80 or more, while some manufacturers claim that their LEDs achieve a CRI of up to 98.

CIE Ra&#x27;s ability to predict color appearance has been criticized in favor of measures based on color appearance models, such as CIECAM02 and for daylight simulators, the CIE metamerism index. CRI is not a good indicator for use in visual assessment of light sources, especially for sources below 5000 kelvin (K). New standards, such as the IES TM-30, resolve these issues and have begun replacing the usage of CRI among professional lighting designers. However, CRI is still common among household lighting products.

==History==

Researchers use daylight as the benchmark to which to compare color rendering of electric lights. In 1948, daylight was described as the ideal source of illumination for good color rendering because &quot;it (daylight) displays (1) a great variety of colors, (2) makes it easy to distinguish slight shades of color, and (3) the colors of objects around us obviously look natural&quot;.

Around the middle of the 20th century, color scientists took an interest in assessing the ability of artificial lights to accurately reproduce colors. European researchers attempted to describe illuminants by measuring the spectral power distribution (SPD) in &quot;representative&quot; spectral bands, whereas their North American counterparts studied the colorimetric effect of the illuminants on reference objects.

The CIE assembled a committee to study the matter and accepted the proposal to use the latter approach, which has the virtue of not needing spectrophotometry, with a set of Munsell samples. Eight samples of varying hue would be alternately lit with two illuminants, and the color appearance compared. Since no color appearance model existed at the time, it was decided to base the evaluation on color differences in a suitable color space, CIEUVW. In 1931, the CIE adopted the first formal system of colorimetry, which is based on the trichromatic nature of the human visual system. CRI is based upon this system of colorimetry.

To deal with the problem of having to compare light sources of different correlated color temperatures (CCT), the CIE settled on using a reference black body with the same color temperature for lamps with a CCT of under 5000 K, or a phase of CIE standard illuminant D (daylight) otherwise. This presented a continuous range of color temperatures to choose a reference from. Any chromaticity difference between the source and reference illuminants were to be abridged with a von Kries-type chromatic adaptation transform. There are two extent versions of CRI: the more commonly used Ra of (actually from 1974) and R96a of .

==Test method==

The CRI is calculated by comparing the color rendering of the test source to that of a &quot;perfect&quot; source, which is a black-body radiator for sources with correlated color temperatures under 5000 K, and a phase of daylight otherwise (e.g., D65). Chromatic adaptation should be performed so that like quantities are compared. The &quot;Test Method&quot; (also called &quot;Test Sample Method&quot; or &quot;Test Color Method&quot;) needs only colorimetric, rather than spectrophotometric, information.


# Using the 2° standard observer, find the chromaticity co-ordinates of the test source in the CIE 1960 color space.
# Determine the correlated color temperature (CCT) of the test source by finding the closest point to the Planckian locus on the (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) chromaticity diagram.
# If the test source has a CCT &lt; 5000 K, use a black body for reference, otherwise use CIE standard illuminant D. Both sources should have the same CCT.
# Ensure that the chromaticity distance (DC) of the test source to the Planckian locus is under 5.4×10−3 in the CIE 1960 UCS. This ensures the meaningfulness of the result, as the CRI is only defined for light sources that are approximately white. formula_1
# Illuminate the first eight standard samples, from the fifteen listed below, alternately using both sources.
# Using the 2° standard observer, find the co-ordinates of the light reflected by each sample in the CIE 1964 color space.
# Chromatically adapt each sample by a Von Kries transform.
# For each sample, calculate the Euclidean distance formula_2 between the pair of co-ordinates.
# Calculate the special (i.e., particular) CRI using the formula formula_3
# Find the general CRI (Ra) by calculating the arithmetic mean of the special CRIs.

Note that the last three steps are equivalent to finding the mean color difference, formula_4 and using that to calculate formula_5:

===Chromatic adaptation===
 uses this von Kries chromatic transform equation to find the corresponding color (&quot;u&quot;&quot;c&quot;,&quot;i&quot;, &quot;v&quot;&quot;c&quot;,&quot;i&quot;) for each sample. The mixed subscripts (&quot;t&quot;, &quot;i&quot;) refer to the inner product of the test illuminant spectrum and the spectral reflexivity of sample &quot;i&quot;:

formula_7

formula_8

formula_9

formula_10

where subscripts &quot;r&quot; and &quot;t&quot; refer to reference and test light sources respectively.

===Test color samples===

As specified in , the original test color samples (TCS) are taken from an early edition of the Munsell Atlas. The first eight samples, a subset of the eighteen proposed in , are relatively low saturated colors and are evenly distributed over the complete range of hues. These eight samples are employed to calculate the general color rendering index formula_5. The last six samples provide supplementary information about the color rendering properties of the light source; the first four for high saturation, and the last two as representatives of well-known objects. The reflectance spectra of these samples may be found in , and their approximate Munsell notations are listed aside.
&#x27;

==R96a method==
In the CIE&#x27;s 1991 Quadrennial Meeting, Technical Committee 1-33 (Color Rendering) was assembled to work on updating the color rendering method, as a result of which the R96a method was developed. The committee was dissolved in 1999, releasing , but no firm recommendations, partly due to disagreements between researchers and manufacturers.

The R96a method has a few distinguishing features:

* A new set of test color samples
* Six reference illuminants: D65, D50, black bodies of 4200 K, 3450 K, 2950 K, and 2700 K.
* A new chromatic adaptation transform: CIECAT94.
* Color difference evaluation in CIELAB.
* Adaptation of all colors to D65 (since CIELAB is well-tested under D65).

It is conventional to use the original method; R96a should be explicitly mentioned if used.

===New test color samples===
As discussed in , recommends the use of a ColorChecker chart owing to the obsolescence of the original samples, of which only metameric matches remain. In addition to the eight ColorChart samples, two skin tone samples are defined (TCS09* and TCS10*). Accordingly, the updated general CRI is averaged over ten samples, not eight as before. Nevertheless, has determined that the patches in give better correlations for any color difference than the ColorChecker chart, whose samples are not equally distributed in a uniform color space.

== Example ==

The CRI can also be theoretically derived from the spectral power distribution (SPD) of the illuminant and samples, since physical copies of the original color samples are difficult to find. In this method, care should be taken to use a sampling resolution fine enough to capture spikes in the SPD. The SPDs of the standard test colors are tabulated in 5 nm increments , so it is suggested to use interpolation up to the resolution of the illuminant&#x27;s spectrophotometry.

Starting with the SPD, let us verify that the CRI of reference illuminant F4 is 51. The first step is to determine the tristimulus values using the 1931 standard observer. Calculation of the inner product of the SPD with the standard observer&#x27;s color matching functions (CMFs) yields (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;) = (109.2, 100.0, 38.9) (after normalizing for &quot;Y&quot; = 100). From this follow the &quot;xy&quot; chromaticity values:

formula_12

formula_13

The next step is to convert these chromaticities to the CIE 1960 UCS in order to be able to determine the CCT:

formula_14

formula_15

Examining the CIE 1960 UCS reveals this point to be closest to 2938 K on the Planckian locus, which has a coordinate of (0.2528, 0.3484). The distance of the test point to the locus is under the limit (5.4×10−3), so we can continue the procedure, assured of a meaningful result:

formula_16

We can verify the CCT by using McCamy&#x27;s approximation algorithm to estimate the CCT from the &quot;xy&quot; chromaticities:

formula_17

where formula_18.

Substituting formula_19 yields &quot;n&quot; = 0.4979 and CCTest. = 2941 K, which is close enough. (Robertson&#x27;s method can be used for greater precision, but we will be content with 2940 K in order to replicate published results.) Since 2940 &lt; 5000, we select a Planckian radiator of 2940 K as the reference illuminant.

The next step is to determine the values of the test color samples under each illuminant in the CIEUVW color space. This is done by integrating the product of the CMF with the SPDs of the illuminant and the sample, then converting from CIEXYZ to CIEUVW (with the &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot; coordinates of the reference illuminant as white point):

From this we can calculate the color difference between the chromatically adapted samples (labeled &quot;CAT&quot;) and those illuminated by the reference. (The Euclidean metric is used to calculate the color difference in CIEUVW.) The special CRI is simply formula_20.

Finally, the general color rendering index is the mean of the special CRIs: 51.

== Typical values ==

A reference source, such as black-body radiation, is defined as having a CRI of 100. This is why incandescent lamps have that rating, as they are, in effect, almost black-body radiators. The best possible faithfulness to a reference is specified by CRI = 100, while the very poorest is specified by a CRI below zero. A high CRI by itself does not imply a good rendition of color, because the reference itself may have an imbalanced SPD if it has an extreme color temperature.

== Special value: R9 ==

Ra is the average value of R1–R8; other values from R9 to R15 are not used in the calculation of Ra, including R9 &quot;saturated red&quot;, R13 &quot;skin color (light)&quot;, and R15 &quot;skin color (medium)&quot;, which are all difficult colors to faithfully reproduce. R9 is a vital index in high-CRI lighting, as many applications require red lights, such as film and video lighting, medical lighting, art lighting, etc. However, in the general CRI (Ra) calculation R9 is not included.

R9 is one of the numbers of Ri refers to test color samples (TCS), which is one score in extended CRI. It is the number rates the light source&#x27;s color revealing ability towards TCS 09. And it describes the specific ability of light to accurately reproduce the red color of objects. Many lights manufacturers or retailers do not point out the score of R9, while it is a vital value to evaluate the color rendition performance for film and video lighting, as well as any applications that need high CRI value. So, generally, it is regarded as a supplement of color rendering index when evaluating a high-CRI light source.

R9 value, TCS 09, or in other words, the red color is the key color for many lighting applications, such as film and video lighting, textile printing, image printing, skin tone, medical lighting, and so on. Besides, many other objects which are not in red color, but actually consists of different colors including red color. For instance, the skin tone is impacted by the blood under the skin, which means that the skin tone also includes red color, although it looks much like close to white or light yellow. So, if the R9 value is not good enough, the skin tone under this light will be more paleness or even greenish in your eyes or cameras.

== Criticism ==
Ohno and others have criticized CRI for not always correlating well with subjective color rendering quality in practice, particularly for light sources with spiky emission spectra such as fluorescent lamps or white LEDs. Another problem is that the CRI is discontinuous at 5000 K, because the chromaticity of the reference moves from the Planckian locus to the CIE daylight locus. identify several other issues, which they address in their color quality scale (CQS):
* The color space in which the color distance is calculated (CIEUVW) is obsolete and nonuniform. Use CIELAB or CIELUV instead.
* The chromatic adaptation transform used (Von Kries transform) is inadequate. Use CMCCAT2000 or CIECAT02 instead.
* Calculating the arithmetic mean of the errors diminishes the contribution of any single large deviation. Two light sources with similar CRI may perform significantly differently if one has a particularly low special CRI in a spectral band that is important for the application. Use the root-mean-square deviation instead.
* The metric is not perceptual; all errors are equally weighted, whereas humans favor certain errors over others. A color can be more saturated or less saturated without a change in the numerical value of ∆&quot;E&quot;&quot;i&quot;, while in general a saturated color is experienced as being more attractive.
* A negative CRI is difficult to interpret. Normalize the scale from 0 to 100 using the formula formula_21.
* The CRI cannot be calculated for light sources that do not have a CCT (non-white light).
* Eight samples are not enough since manufacturers can optimize the emission spectra of their lamps to reproduce them faithfully, but otherwise perform poorly. Use more samples (they suggest fifteen for CQS).
* The samples are not saturated enough to pose difficulty for reproduction.
* CRI merely measures the faithfulness of any illuminant to an ideal source with the same CCT, but the ideal source itself may not render colors well if it has an extreme color temperature, due to a lack of energy at either short or long wavelengths (i.e., it may be excessively blue or red). Weight the result by the ratio of the gamut area of the polygon formed by the fifteen samples in CIELAB for 6500 K to the gamut area for the test source. 6500 K is chosen for reference since it has a relatively even distribution of energy over the visible spectrum and hence high gamut area. This normalizes the multiplication factor.

=== Alternatives ===
 &quot;reviews the applicability of the CIE color rendering index to white LED light sources based on the results of visual experiments&quot;. Chaired by Davis, CIE TC 1-69(C) is currently investigating &quot;new methods for assessing the color rendition properties of white-light sources used for illumination, including solid-state light sources, with the goal of recommending new assessment procedures [...] by March, 2010&quot;.

For a comprehensive review of alternative color rendering indexes see .

 reviewed several alternative quality metrics and compared their performance based on visual data obtained in nine psychophysical experiments. It was found that a geometric mean of the GAI index and the CIE Ra correlated best with naturalness (r=0.85), while a color quality metric based on memory colors (MCRI) correlated best for preference (&quot;r&quot; = 0.88). The differences in performance of these metrics with the other tested metrics (CIE Ra; CRI-CAM02UCS; CQS; RCRI; GAI; geomean (GAI, CIE Ra); CSA; Judd Flattery; Thornton CPI; MCRI) were found to be statistically significant with &quot;p&quot; &lt; 0.0001.

Dangol, et al., performed psychophysical experiments and concluded that people&#x27;s judgments of naturalness and overall preference could not be predicted with a single measure, but required the joint use of a fidelity-based measure (e.g., Qp) and a gamut-based measure (e.g., Qg or GAI.). They carried out further experiments in real offices evaluating various spectra generated for combination existing and proposed color rendering metrics.

Due to the criticisms of CRI many researchers have developed alternative metrics, though relatively few of them have had wide adoption.

==== Gamut area index (GAI) ====
Developed in 2010 by Rea and Freyssinier, the gamut area index (GAI) is an attempt to improve over the flaws found in the CRI. They have shown that the GAI is better than the CRI at predicting color discrimination on standardized Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Tests and that GAI is predictive of color saturation. Proponents of using GAI claim that, when used in conjunction with CRI, this method of evaluating color rendering is preferred by test subjects over light sources that have high values of only one measure. Researchers recommend a lower and an upper limit to GAI. Use of LED technology has called for a new way to evaluate color rendering because of the unique spectrum of light created by these technologies. Preliminary tests have shown that the combination of GAI and CRI used together is a preferred method for evaluating color rendering.

==== Color quality scale (CQS) ====

 developed a psychophysical experiment in order to evaluate light quality of LED lightings. It is based on colored samples used in the &quot;color quality scale&quot;. Predictions of the CQS and results from visual measurements were compared.

== Film and video high-CRI LED lighting ==

Problems have been encountered attempting to use LED lighting on film and video sets. The color spectra of LED lighting primary colors does not match the expected color wavelength bandpasses of film emulsions and digital sensors. As a result, color rendition can be completely unpredictable in optical prints, transfers to digital media from film (DIs), and video camera recordings. This phenomenon with respect to motion picture film has been documented in an LED lighting evaluation series of tests produced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences scientific staff.

To that end, various other metrics such as the TLCI (television lighting consistency index) have been developed to replace the human observer with a camera observer. Similar to the CRI, the metric measures quality of a light source as it would appear on camera on a scale from 0 to 100. Some manufacturers say that their products have TLCI values of up to 99.

<doc id="1324667" wikidata="Q572220" url="?curid=1324667" title="Into Glory Ride">
<text>Into Glory Ride is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Manowar. Released in July 1983 by Megaforce Records and Music for Nations, it was the first to feature drummer Scott Columbus. The album&#x27;s title is a reference to a lyric of the title track from the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Battle Hymns&quot;. 

A heavy metal and power metal album, members Ross &quot;The Boss&quot; Friedman and Joey DeMaio brought themes of fantasy, historical warfare, and sword and sorcery to prominence in songs such as &quot;Gloves of Metal&quot; in the album, representing Manowar&#x27;s turning point in their musical direction. The negative publicity of their debut album inspired Manowar to develop their fanbase, including a publicized signing of a recording contract in their blood and the phrase &quot;death to false metal&quot;, which originated from &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot;. 

The album received mixed but favorable receptions among critics and writers, with some writers calling &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot; influential in developing power metal music and a refinement of Manowar&#x27;s music style.

==Background==
After the release of their debut album &quot;Battle Hymns&quot;, Liberty Records and Bill Aucoin dropped Manowar due to negative press and complications in marketing the band. The bassist Joey DeMaio called them &quot;idiots&quot;, describing that for a while, Manowar was &quot;left for dead&quot;. This was acknowledged in the album notes of their second album &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot;, where Manowar wrote about their reemergence after being struck by &quot;deceivers&quot;, and &quot;left for dead&quot;. For their second album, Manowar signed with Megaforce Records and gained headlines in the British music press for signing the new contract in their own blood, becoming the first band to demonstrate their commitment this way and being against &quot;false metal&quot;. The signing was a in the 1983 July/August issue No. 47 of &quot;Kerrang!&quot;

In a &quot;TrueMetal.it&quot; September 2021 interview with Ross &quot;The Boss&quot; Friedman, Friedman stated that as a &quot;super history buff&quot;, he was fond of Vikings and Ancient Greece. With Joey DeMaio, Friedman conceived the image of the band and the concept for &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot;. Regarding the album artwork and the image of the band, Friedman stated that Manowar &quot;ordered real swords; it was all real, we were real. We were completely involved. We used to think that everything in life is a battle, until today, everything is a battle, you have to strive to improve, to prepare, to overcome obstacles and to become a better person every day. Be good to others and tough on your enemies. We were all Manowars, or so I thought...&quot;

The ethos of &quot;true metal&quot; and the dichotomy between &quot;true metal&quot; and &quot;false metal&quot;, as well as the phrase &quot;Death to false metal&quot; is prominently featured in &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot;, where both are printed on the album sleeve. Writers and media outlets observed that &quot;true metal&quot; aligns with Manowar themselves, and the authentic characteristic of heavy metal music, whereas &quot;false metal&quot; aligns with commercial motivations and poseurs. Jon Zazula, founder of Megaforce Records was quoted as saying &quot;This is Manowar, not Men at Work&quot; by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in 1983. Friedman would later disown the dichotomy between &quot;true metal&quot; and &quot;false metal&quot;, stating it &quot;was the worst thing Joey ever said and it did set us up for humiliation in the end&quot;.

==Songs==
===Side one===
====&quot;Warlord&quot;====
&quot;Warlord&quot; is a song about a biker riding around and having sex with girls. The song starts with two people making love, but are quickly disturbed by the girl&#x27;s parents including a broken escape by the young male protagonist. The main subject of &quot;Warlord&quot;, the biker is said to be also watching television and seeing an appeal for aid in another part of the world; The biker disparages the appeal for aid, declaring &quot;stop sending money; send &#x27;em all a bomb&quot;. Some authors claim that Manowar in &quot;Warlord&quot; channels the essence of a working-class biker, which may have likely resonated with metal fans of the time. Phil Freeman, writing for &quot;Burning Ambulance&quot; asserts that biker culture is one of Manowar&#x27;s primary themes in their music. Others claim that the lyrical content of &quot;Warlord&quot; manifests a degree of hypermasculinity and misogyny.

In 1996, the band&#x27;s eighth album &quot;Louder Than Hell&quot; the opening track from the album called “Return of the Warlord,” is a sequel to the song “Warlord”.

====&quot;Secret of Steel&quot;====
&quot;Secret of Steel&quot; represents the continuation and refinement of the power metal style, that Manowar first explored with the eponymous closing track to their 1982 debut album &quot;Battle Hymns&quot;. Some music writers observed the song to be a tribute to the 1982 film &quot;Conan The Barbarian&quot;. According to Freeman and &quot;Burning Ambulance&quot;, Manowar frequently employ steel as a recurring metaphor, for several of their songs. &quot;Secret of Steel&quot; is their first song whose title is connected with the word &quot;steel&quot;.

The song has also been described as an ode to sword and sorcery stories, as well as having a doomy atmosphere. The song also heavily features a choir, and guitar works of Ross &quot;The Boss&quot; Friedman.

====&quot;Gloves of Metal&quot;====
An anthemic heavy metal and power metal song, &quot;Gloves of Metal&quot; is about being a warrior of metal, dressed in leather, studs and spikes. The song also draws on the imagery of sword and sorcery&#x27;s barbarians and heavy armored army slowly marching forward. A major characteristic of &quot;Gloves of Metal&quot; is the slow, pacing rhythm throughout the song. Some writers have noted the singing of Eric Adams in the song as being powerful and operatic. The lyrics mentions the name &quot;metal kings&quot;, which would become one of their well known nicknames and later inspire the title of their sixth studio album &quot;Kings Of Metal&quot;. Composed by Friedman and DeMaio, Friedman wrote the riff with a modified guitar tuning for &quot;Gloves of Metal&quot;, where every string in the guitar are in standard tuning, but only the sixth string is in C#. 

Manowar filmed their first official music video for &quot;Gloves of Metal&quot; in 1983. The music video features shots of leather-clad warriors riding on horseback through the forest, Manowar miming the studio recording as if it was a live performance, and fighting and victory scenes. In 2000, the German web magazine &quot;Vampster&quot; named the video &quot;one of the most iconic that the metal scene has ever seen&quot;, and described both the music video and the &quot;best-known&quot; song as &quot;[getting] its power from its slow pace&quot;. &quot;Vampster&quot; deemed the music video complementary to the album artwork of &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot;. In 2014, VH1 ranked the song &#x27;Gloves of Metal&#x27; as the 6th greatest heavy metal song with the word &quot;metal&quot; in the title.

====&quot;Gates of Valhalla&quot;====
&quot;Gates of Valhalla&quot; is a Norse-influenced heavy metal song about being a Viking warrior fighting and dying for glory in the afterlife, a fantasy-based heroic mythos that incorporates elements of Viking culture. The song is one of Manowar&#x27;s first ballads and prominently features &quot;histronic&quot; singing vocals and melancholic lyrics expressing a final battle of a Viking and being sent to Valhalla upon his death: &quot;With sword in hand, I scream the final battle cry&quot;. Some music writers consider Manowar to be pioneers of Viking metal, calling them &quot;forefathers&quot; due to the lyrical content of &quot;Gates of Valhalla&quot; among other songs.

===Side two===
====&quot;Hatred&quot;====
&quot;Hatred&quot; is a heavy metal song with doom metal influences. The song is described as having an aggressive, dark and doom rhythm with &quot;strange&quot; dissonant guitars, along with varying rhythms that becomes atmospherically dense. The song&#x27;s name is screamed twice in succession in the chorus. Music writers have described Eric Adams&#x27; screams in &quot;Hatred&quot; as &quot;merciless&quot; and the song as &quot;sluggish&quot;, and full of &quot;aggressiveness&quot; and &quot;measured grind&quot; with its gory lyrics.

====&quot;Revelation (Death&#x27;s Angel)&quot;====
&quot;Revelation (Death&#x27;s Angel)&quot; references the New Testament&#x27;s vision of the final Apocalypse, as told in the Book of Revelation. British sociologist Karl Spracklen observes that Manowar uses this reference to turn the morality tale into a &quot;glory of the final battle against Satan&quot;, where the lyrics reject the Satanism of heavy metal in favor of an idea that resembles the Victorian era religious movement Muscular Christianity. The song features archetypical heavy metal characteristics such as a galloping rhythm and was described as having an &quot;almost majestic atmosphere&quot; by some music writers. Music writers have also noted the refrain of the song being melodic and evoking powerful vivid imagery and theme, describing the vocals as &quot;full&quot; and &quot;emotional&quot;, while some have described the songwriting quality as &quot;excellent&quot;.

====&quot;March for Revenge (By the Soldiers of Death)&quot;====
The song describes the revenge of soldiers of death, describing their battles, wars and accomplishments filled with revenge after the fallen soldiers, who have died in battle: &quot;Let revenge be sweet, for when we march, your sword rides with me&quot;. Writers and music outlets such as &quot;Kerrang!&quot; note the recurring theme of &quot;rape and pillage&quot; being very prominent in the song, quoting the lyrics: &quot;maim and kill them, take the women and children&quot;. Some reviewers argue that the song is &quot;a perfect successor&quot; of the title track of Manowar&#x27;s debut album &quot;Battle Hymns&quot;, &quot;Battle Hymn&quot;, observing that &quot;March for Revenge&quot; follows the similar musical structure as the latter.

==Release==
&quot;Into Glory Ride&quot; was released in July 1983 by Megaforce Records in the United States, and Music for Nations for the rest of the world. Manowar appeared on a Nickelodeon talk show &quot;Livewire&quot; in 1983 to promote their album &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot;. Manowar performed two songs live, &quot;Gloves of Metal&quot; and &quot;Revelation (Death&#x27;s Angel)&quot;. Members of the band, dressed in barbarian warrior attire in a similar manner as the promoted album&#x27;s artwork, took questions from an audience of teenagers, parents, and grandparents. 

===Critical reception===
&quot;Into Glory Ride&quot; received mixed to positive receptions among writers and critics. In November 1983, &quot;Metal Forces&quot; writer Bernard Doe describes the album as &quot;weak and quite tame&quot; compared to the &quot;tough macho image&quot; the band portrayed. Referencing the phrase &quot;Death to false metal&quot; as printed in the sleeve notes, Doe bitingly implies that Manowar is the &quot;false metal&quot;, owing to the macho image he considered as &quot;fake&quot;. While lauding the musicianship of Eric Adams and Ross the Boss, naming &quot;Warlord&quot; and &quot;Revelation (Death&#x27;s Angel)&quot; as exemplary tracks, Doe noted that &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot; is an improvement from their previous debut album &quot;Battle Hymns&quot;. Writing for &quot;AllMusic&quot;, Steve Huey described &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot; as &quot;murky and unfocused&quot; but observed that some songs are strong enough to be &quot;Manowar standards&quot;.

In 2000, sociologist Deena Weinstein named &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot; as one of the &quot;100 Definitive Metal Albums&quot; to listen to in her book &quot;Heavy Metal: The Music and Its Culture&quot;. In the same year, the German online magazine &quot;Vampster&quot; described &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot; as &quot;an absolute killer&quot; and lamented that after the album, &quot;MANOWAR will never write such an album again - not even remotely. ... no band has managed to create a comparable work [to &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot;]&quot;. The online magazine &quot;PowerMetal.de&quot; rated the album 9.32 stars out of 10 stars and praised the album for its passion for &quot;myths and legends&quot;, musicianship, speed, and aggression, declaring that &quot;MANOWAR have remained absolutely true to each other with the disc&quot;. 

In 2005, &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot; was ranked number 444 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;Best of Rock &amp; Metal: Die 500 stärksten Scheiben aller Zeiten&quot;. In 2006, the online magazine &quot;Metalfan.nl&quot; rated the album 94 out of 100 points, calling &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot; an &quot;almost entirely epic album, further developing the aspects of the debut&#x27;s best songs ... A top record from a top band.&quot;&quot;

=== 2019 remixed version: &quot;Into Glory Ride: Imperial Edition MMXIX&quot; ===
On 29 March 2019, &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot; was remixed from the original multitrack recordings and released as &quot;Into Glory Ride: Imperial Edition MMXIX&quot;. The album was remixed at Joey DeMaio&#x27;s Valhalla Studios in Owasco, New York. The band stated that they had been &quot;forced into a somewhat rushed and compromised production&quot; during the original recording. The album artwork of &quot;Into Glory Ride: Imperial Edition MMXIX&quot; differs from the original album artwork, as it includes an artwork by the artist Ken Kelly, depicting a warrior riding a golden chariot with horses. 

In 2019, the Greek online magazine &quot;Metal Invader&quot; described &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot; as &quot;one of the masterpieces of a band that influenced the Metal firm as little as possible... So they deserve our respect...&quot;. Reviewing for the &quot;Imperial Edition&quot;, &quot;Metal Invader&quot; asserted that the 2019 version &quot;deserves to be next to the classic since it brings to the surface many new elements in terms of sound.&quot;

<doc id="1324669" wikidata="Q5289243" url="?curid=1324669" title="Dollar voting">
<text>Dollar voting is an analogy that refers to the theoretical impact of consumer choice on producers&#x27; actions by means of the flow of consumer payments to producers for their goods and services.

==Overview==
In some principles textbooks of the mid-20th century, the term &quot;dollar voting&quot; was used to describe the process by which consumers&#x27; choices influence firms&#x27; production decisions. Products that consumers buy will tend to be produced in the future. Products that do not sell as well as expected will receive fewer productive resources in the future. According to this analogy, consumers vote for &quot;winners&quot; and &quot;losers&quot; with their purchases. This argument was used to explain market allocations of goods and services under the catchphrase &quot;consumer sovereignty&quot;.

Consumer boycotts sometimes aim to change producers&#x27; behaviour. The goals of selective boycotts, or dollar voting, have been diverse, including cutting corporate revenues, removal of key executives, and reputational damage.

The modern idea of dollar voting can be traced back to its development by James M. Buchanan in &quot;Individual Choice in Voting and the Market&quot;. As a public choice theorist, Buchanan considered economic participation by the individual to be a form of pure democracy. Also known as political consumerism, the history of dollar voting in the United States can be traced back to the American Revolution, when colonists boycotted several British products in protest of taxation without representation.

If voters feel disenfranchised politically, they may instead use their spending power to influence politics and the economy. Consumers use dollar voting because they hope to impact society&#x27;s values and the use of resources.

==Criticisms==
Dollar voting has faced criticism in modern America for being class-bound. Dollar voting is archetypically used by middle and upper middle class consumers who spend their money at local farmers markets, community agricultural programs, and the preparation of &quot;slow food&quot;. These purchases do not affect low-income producers and consumers in the food market. Dollar voting has also been criticized as a form of conspicuous consumption for the well-off.

Dollar voting has also been criticized for being a sort of consumer vigilantism. While most economists and economic philosophers accept that consumers have a right to their personal moral choices in the market, large-scale movements to influence consumer spending could have potentially dangerous implications.

Efforts to encourage corporations and firms to act in environmentally friendly ways have become popular. It is unclear whether firms that create negative environmental externalities will actually change their method of production to satisfy such desires. Dollar voting also could dissuade citizens from law-making efforts to check unmitigated self-interest in firms and consumers, instead shifting this responsibility over to the market.

<doc id="1324670" wikidata="Q509300" url="?curid=1324670" title="Federal Capital Territory (Nigeria)">
<text>The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) is a federal territory in central Nigeria. Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria, is located in this territory. The FCT was formed in 1976 from parts of the states of old Kaduna, Kwara, Niger, and Plateau states, with the bulk of land mass carved out of Niger state. The Federal Capital Territory is within the North Central region of the country. Unlike other states of Nigeria, which are headed by elected Governors, it is administered by the Federal Capital Territory Administration, headed by a minister, who is appointed by the president.

== History ==
The Federal Capital Territory was created upon the promulgation of decree number 6 of 1976. It came into existence due to a need to find a replacement for the capital city of Lagos, which had become congested and had little space for expansion. The area chosen as the new capital was principally Gwari Land (the home of the tribes referred to as the Gbagyis, their language is referred to as Gwari) with high concentrations of Muslims and Christians and a high degree of neutrality from the dominant ethnic groups.

Decree 6 of 1976, gave the federal government rights over land within the territory. The population density prior to the takeover by the government was sparse with a population of 120,000 residents living in 840 villages and mostly of Gwari heritage. Inhabitants were relocated to nearby towns like Suleja in Niger state, and New Karshi in Nasarawa State on the outskirts of the territory.

==Geography==
The territory is located just north of the confluence of the Niger River and Benue River. It is bordered by the states of Niger to the west and north for 179 km, Kaduna to the northeast for 45 km, Nasarawa to the east and south for 156 km, and Kogi to the southwest for 17 km.

Lying between latitudes 8.25 and 9.20 north of the equator and longitudes 6.45 and 7.39 east of Greenwich Meridian, The Federal Capital Territory is geographically located at the center of the country.

The Federal Capital Territory has a landmass of approximately 7,315 km2, and it is situated within the savannah region with moderate climatic conditions.

===Natural resources===
Minerals found in the FCT include marble, tin, clay, mica, and tantalite.

===Wildlife===
The hills of the FCT provide home to many bushbuck, forest Black duiker, bush pig, chimpanzee and red-flanked duiker.
Also found in FCT woodland are leopard, buffalo, roan antelope, Western hartebeest, elephant, warthog, grey duiker, dog-faced baboon, patas monkey and green monkey.

=== Climate ===
Like some northern states in Nigeria, the Federal Capital Territory is relatively mild. The Federal Capital Territory is usually very hot between the months of January and April. The average daily maximum temperature of the city is above , with the month of March being the hottest month. The rainy season in the territory lasts between July and October of every year but the coolest month is December, during the harmattan season. During the harmattan, there is high relative humidity, coupled with windy and foggy atmosphere.

== Administration ==

=== Federal Capital Territory Ministers ===

The Federal Capital Territory is headed by the Federal Capital Territory Minister, Barr. Nyesom Wike, who is appointed by the Federal government. The Federal Capital Territory Minister appoints members to the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council.

=== Subdivisions ===
While the Federal Capital Territory minister administers the whole of the Federal Capital Territory, the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) specifically manages the construction and infrastructure development of the region.

The territory is currently made up of six local government areas, namely:
* Abaji
* Abuja Municipal
* Bwari
* Gwagwalada
* Kuje
* Kwali
==Languages==

<doc id="1324675" wikidata="Q3676068" url="?curid=1324675" title="Chukwu">
<text>Chukwu () is the supreme being of Igbo spirituality. In the Igbo pantheon, Chukwu is the source of all other Igbo deities and is responsible for assigning them their different tasks. The Igbo people believe that all things come from Chukwu (Chiukwu), who brings the rain necessary for plants to grow and controls everything on Earth and the spiritual world. They believe Chukwu to be an undefinable omnipotent and omnipresent supreme deity that encompasses everything in space and space itself.

Linguistic studies suggest that the name &quot;Chukwu&quot; is a portmanteau of the Igbo words &quot;chi&quot; (&quot;spiritual being&quot;) and &quot;ukwu&quot; (&quot;great&quot;).

==Conception of Chukwu==
According to the Igbo people, who are the majority in the southeastern region of Nigeria today, Chineke is the creator of the universe and everything good in it along with rain, trees, and other plants. Chukwu is a supreme deity, and in pagan traditions this was often anthropomorphizedby the sun. How, Chukwu literally means &quot;deity&quot; as does Chineke, so for Christian and Muslim Igbos Chukwu means &quot;God&quot; and has no relation with the sun or any other natural phenomenon.

Many Igbo Christians refer to the Christian God as Chukwu. Chukwu (Chu-kwu) is similar to &quot;The Most High&quot; and &quot;The Almighty&quot; instead of a name like &quot;God&quot; which is of Germanic origin. This was usually referring to an idol in the pre-Christian era, but with the arrival of Christianity and Islam in the region, Chukwu became used for God. Chukwu in Igbo language means God the Almighty, the supreme and most high.Most Igbo names are attached to the supreme Being (God) example Ugo Chukwu, Ebere Chukwu and many more. The Igbo believe it is impossible for humans to conceive of the unlimited greatness of Chukwu. Many Igbo dialects refer to The Almighty by titles such as &quot;Chukwu&quot; (Chi Ukwu), &quot;Chineke&quot; (Chi Na Eke), &quot;Chukwu Okike&quot; (Chi Ukwu Okike), &quot;Chiokike&quot; (Chi Okike), &quot;Chuku&quot; (Chi Uku), &quot;Ebili Ukpabi&quot; (Ebili nu Ukpabi), and &quot;Obasi&quot; (Obi Alusi).

There are six aspects of Chukwu:
# Chukwu – the first force and existence of all beings.
# Anyanwu – the symbolic meaning of the sun. The sun reveals everything so Chukwu is the source of knowledge and the author of all knowledge.
# Ala – the fertility of Earth, its people, and its spiritual world full of sub-deities.
# Amadioha – the bringer of justice, love, peace, and unity, and the creator of humankind.
# Chi – a sub-deity functioning as a personal, spiritual guide.
# Okike – creator of laws that govern the visible and invisible.

<doc id="1324681" wikidata="Q722249" url="?curid=1324681" title="Operating margin">
<text>In business, operating margin—also known as operating income margin, operating profit margin, EBIT margin and return on sales (ROS)—is the ratio of operating income (&quot;operating profit&quot; in the UK) to net sales, usually expressed in percent.

:formula_1

&quot;Net profit&quot; measures the profitability of ventures after accounting for all costs.

&quot;Return on sales (ROS)&quot; is net profit as a percentage of sales revenue. ROS is an indicator of profitability and is often used to compare the profitability of companies and industries of differing sizes. Significantly, ROS does not account for the capital (investment) used to generate the profit. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 69 percent responded that they found the &quot;return on sales&quot; metric very useful.

Unlike Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin, operating margin takes into account depreciation and amortization expenses. {NNP = GNP- depreciation /GNP = GDP- depreciation

==Purpose==
These financial metrics measure levels and rates of profitability. Probably the most common way to determine the successfulness of a company is to look at the net profits of the business. Companies are collections of projects and markets, individual areas can be judged on how successful they are at adding to the corporate net profit. Not all projects are of equal size, however, and one way to adjust for size is to divide the profit by sales revenue. The resulting ratio is return on sales (ROS), the percentage of sales revenue that gets &#x27;returned&#x27; to the company as net profits after all the related costs of the activity are deducted.

==Construction==
Net profit measures the fundamental profitability of the business. It is the revenues of the activity less the costs of the activity. The main complication is in more complex businesses when overhead needs to be allocated across divisions of the company. Almost by definition, overheads are costs that cannot be directly tied to any specific product or division. The classic example would be the cost of headquarters staff.

&quot;Net profit: To calculate net profit for a unit (such as a company or division), subtract all costs, including a fair share of total corporate overheads, from the gross revenues.
formula_2

&quot;Return on sales (ROS): Net profit as a percentage of sales revenue&quot;.
formula_3

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) is a very popular measure of financial performance. It is used to assess the &#x27;operating&#x27; profit of the business. It is a rough way of calculating how much cash the business is generating and is even sometimes called the &#x27;operating cash flow&#x27;. It can be useful because it removes factors that change the view of performance depending upon the accounting and financing policies of the business. Supporters argue it reduces management&#x27;s ability to change the profits they report by their choice of accounting rules and the way they generate financial backing for the company. This metric excludes from consideration expenses related to decisions such as how to finance the business (debt or equity) and over what period they depreciate fixed assets. EBITDA is typically closer to actual cash flow than is NOPAT. ... EBITDA can be calculated by adding back the costs of interest, depreciation, and amortization charges and any taxes incurred. 
formula_4Example: The Coca-Cola Company

formula_5

It is a measurement of what proportion of a company&#x27;s revenue is left over, before taxes and other indirect costs (such as rent, bonus, interest, &quot;etc&quot;.), after paying for variable costs of production as wages, raw materials, &quot;etc&quot;. A good operating margin is needed for a company to be able to pay for its fixed costs, such as interest on debt. A higher operating margin means that the company has less financial risk.

Operating margin can be considered total revenue from product sales less all costs before adjustment for taxes, dividends to shareholders, and interest on debt.

<doc id="1324684" wikidata="Q2030903" url="?curid=1324684" title="Real Time with Bill Maher">
<text>Real Time with Bill Maher is an American television talk show that airs weekly on HBO, hosted by comedian and political satirist Bill Maher. Much like his previous series &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; on Comedy Central and later on ABC, &quot;Real Time&quot; features a panel of guests who discuss current events in politics and the media. Unlike the previous show, guests are usually better versed in the subject matter; more experts such as journalists, professors, and politicians participate in the panel, and fewer actors and celebrities are included.

&quot;Real Time&quot; is a weekly hour-long program with a studio audience, and is broadcast from Studio 33 at Television City in Los Angeles. Prior to Season 20, the program aired live on Friday nights at 10:00pm ET, however, it is now pre-recorded at 7:00pm ET. In addition, a 10–15-minute &quot;Overtime&quot; segment quickly follows the show on YouTube live stream, which answers questions posted by viewers through HBO&#x27;s online website for the show.

In September 2021, HBO announced that the show had been renewed for two additional seasons, keeping the show on the air through 2024. The show&#x27;s 21st season premiered on January 20, 2023. From February 3, 2023, the post-show Overtime segment was added to CNN Tonight programming. The show&#x27;s 22nd season premiered on January 19, 2024. In March 2024, HBO announced that the show had been renewed for two additional seasons, keeping the show on the air through the end of 2026.

== Format ==
The opening sequence contains a theme song composed by Scott &quot;Shavoni&quot; Parker, Christopher &quot;Kid&quot; Reid and Louis Brown. A montage of animated graphics with political and cultural themes surrounded by splashes of color accompanies the music. Season 21 features an updated version of the theme song performed by Green Day.

The show opens with a comedy monologue performed by Maher, followed by a one-on-one interview with a prominent guest. Maher then engages with two or three additional panel guests, who partake in various discussions and debates. Midway through the panel session, Maher performs a comedic bit that typically satirizes a notable current event. The final segment of each episode is entitled &quot;New Rules&quot; and contains an array of editorials related to popular culture and American politics. The final &quot;New Rule&quot; serves as Maher&#x27;s closing editorial monologue. While the aforementioned format is typically followed, Maher states that it is not entirely rigid and has also indicated that he prefers in-studio interviews to satellite interviews.

Since the show airs on HBO, Maher and his guests are allowed to use profane language, a significant departure from the broadcast standards that existed on &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;. Graphics displayed throughout the show may also contain some uncensored content.

During the first season, Paul F. Tompkins was featured as a correspondent, and each episode would conclude with a performance by a stand-up comedian. The segments featuring Tompkins and the stand-up comedians were dropped after episode 10. Viewers were also able to engage over the air during the first season by calling in live, but this practice was subsequently discontinued.

Starting with episode 67, audio-only versions of the show were made available as free podcasts via the iTunes Store and as raw RSS feeds. The podcasts may also feature bonus material taped during studio rehearsal, such as additional &quot;New Rules&quot; that were not included in the final broadcast.

During Season 4, Maher began hosting a live chat (now called &quot;Overtime&quot;) with his guests immediately following each broadcast. Viewers are invited to submit questions and topics for Maher and the other participants to answer and discuss. This post-show event was initially featured on HBO&#x27;s website and is currently broadcast on CNN.

=== Politics and current events ===

Maher has been a critic of the Obama administration, the Bush administration and the Trump administration. His panel attempts to present a diverse set of views. Frequently, it consists of a liberal commentator or political figure, a conservative commentator or political figure, and a third individual who does not have as clear an ideological label, or someone with moderate beliefs. This third individual is often an actor, comedian, musician, or other entertainment figure, though many times the commentator is openly conservative or liberal.

On his previous TV series, &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, Maher used the word &quot;libertarian&quot; to describe his political leanings. Regarding religion, he considers himself a &quot;rationalist&quot;, as someone &quot;preaching the gospel of &#x27;I don&#x27;t know. Maher identifies himself as politically unaffiliated and disagrees with the Republican party on many issues, and with the Democratic Party on many of their party platform&#x27;s planks. He endorsed the candidacy of Ralph Nader of the Green Party during his 2000 presidential campaign. After the 2000 election, Maher was among those who felt that votes cast by progressives for Nader possibly cost Democratic candidate Al Gore the election, and put George W. Bush in the White House. During an episode on which Nader and Michael Moore were guests, both Maher and Moore begged Nader not to run again in 2004. Maher endorsed Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry leading up to the 2004 presidential election. In 2008, he endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and harshly criticized Republican candidate John McCain&#x27;s political campaign. He also heavily criticized McCain&#x27;s vice presidential pick, Sarah Palin, on her qualifications and intelligence. Maher interviewed then presidential-candidate, Republican Ron Paul, giving him some positive air time. He often cites Paul&#x27;s views in order to demonstrate the diversity of views on the right. Maher has used Real Time to bring voters attention to current political races. In 2014, Real Time launched a campaign called &quot;Flip a district.&quot; The objective was for Real Time&#x27;s audience to directly affect the outcome of an upcoming congressional race where Maher felt the incumbent candidate had voted or behaved badly. The show&#x27;s executive producer Scott Carter told the New York Times that they were considering both Republicans and Democrats but “with our viewers voting, I imagine it is much more likely we will pick a Republican.&quot; Republican Minnesota Rep. John Kline was eventually selected but was not unseated in that election despite the Real Time campaign.

Maher has strong opinions on US drug policy, advocating for the legalization of marijuana. He is against censorship, often citing his own dismissal from ABC and the backlash against the Dixie Chicks for their comments on the Iraq War. He is also against conservative attitudes towards sex and sexuality, mocking outrages over the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal and Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot;. He is also not shy about his lack of religious beliefs and he frequently criticizes religion. He is widely known for his support of animal rights groups such as PETA. Hot-button political issues such as health care, corporate influence in government, illegal immigration, the environment, entitlement programs, and human service regulations are frequently discussed on the show.

==== Christine O&#x27;Donnell ====
On September 17, 2010, Maher aired a clip of Delaware Republican Senatorial candidate Christine O&#x27;Donnell from the October 29, 1999, episode of his prior TV series &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, where she discussed that she had &quot;dabbled in witchcraft&quot;. This was perhaps the most notable of numerous controversial statements by O&#x27;Donnell that made her the most covered candidate in the 2010 mid-term election cycle. O&#x27;Donnell went on to film a rebuttal commercial claiming &quot;I&#x27;m not a witch, I&#x27;m you.&quot; This ad inspired many video parodies and O&#x27;Donnell later said that the ad backfired and focused attention on her decade-old statement. O&#x27;Donnell lost to her Democratic opponent, Chris Coons, in the general election. On the September 7, 2012, episode of &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, O&#x27;Donnell appeared on the show for the first time and resolved the issue with Maher, who apologized for the amount of publicity that the clip garnered. Maher said that he would not have aired the clip if he knew that it would have taken away from the message of her campaign.

=== Changes in 2008 ===
The show returned on January 11, 2008, and began broadcasting in high definition, with updates to the set for HD display.

As a result of the writers&#x27; strike, in Season 6, the opening skit, the &quot;New Rules&quot; segment, and the closing monologue were eliminated for five episodes at the beginning of the year. The ice breaker used in the middle of the show (normally a fake products sketch tying into a current event) was also eliminated due to the strike. The announcement that &quot;Real Time&quot; would return without writers indicated that the opening monologue would also be cut, but every episode included a full monologue. The initial season finale of Season Five was to air on November 9, 2007, and was to feature Ben Affleck, George Carlin, and Tom Brokaw as guests, but was canceled due to the strike.

During the strike, the &quot;Overtime&quot; concept became part of the live show itself, through a new segment called &quot;Blogga, Please!&quot;. Using HBO&#x27;s website, viewers were able to leave comments or questions during the live show. Maher and the panel then responded to selected postings at the end of the show. The &quot;Blogga, Please!&quot; segment was discontinued, and &quot;New Rules&quot; brought back, on February 15 following the resolution of the strike. Additionally, during the strike, Maher aired pre-recorded interviews by himself with everyday people about the election and other issues after the opening monologue.

Established early on, the final &quot;New Rule&quot; served as a segue into the closing monologue. On the March 7 episode, the closing monologue returned to the format of the show. The opening skits did not reappear, except for April 4 and 11, 2008.

Instead of doing a second satellite interview near the forty-minute mark, the January 11 episode also featured the debut of the &quot;Real Time Real Reporter&quot;, a blogger or political pundit who is brought on midway through the show as an extra panelist to offer opinions on the latest election campaign happenings. Such correspondents have included Matt Taibbi, Frank Luntz, Amy Holmes, P. J. O&#x27;Rourke, and Dan Savage.

=== Changes in 2009 ===
The 2009 premiere was on February 20 at the earlier time of 10:00pm EST. The opening sequence was also slightly changed to include then President-elect Barack Obama and his family waving to a crowd of supporters on election night in November 2008.

Also, the show aired one continuous season as opposed to airing episodes in the spring and fall with a summer break in between.

For a short time the &quot;Real Time&quot; panel was reduced from three panelists to two for the new season. Maher jokingly attributed the new panel line-up to the economic crisis, stating that it was a means of reining in spending for the HBO show; Maher later stated that there is no connection between the failing economy and the producers&#x27; decision to remove the third guest. During his show on March 13, 2009, Maher reacted to the confusion sparked by his remarks from his previous show regarding the panel stating, &quot;I said as a joke that we had cut down the panel to two people because of economic times, and people took me seriously. No. It&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m tired of talking to three people sometimes.&quot; The panel was once again at three panelists for the show one week later, on March 20. In addition to the panel reconfiguration, Maher has instituted a one-on-one in-studio interview segment in lieu of the past seasons&#x27; satellite interviews. The interview with James Carville on the May 8 show, however, was conducted via satellite.

=== Changes in 2012 ===
HBO renewed the show on April 24, 2012, for two more seasons through 2013–14. The first episode of Season 11 aired on January 18, 2013, retaining its format of an initial monologue from Maher, a one-on-one interview with a guest, then turning to a discussion panel of three guests, and ending with &quot;New Rules&quot;.

A new addition to the format is that of a fourth or &quot;mid-guest&quot;, who comes in at approximately the halfway point of the show, bringing their own issue to the table and discussing it with the entire panel.

=== Changes in 2017 ===
In 2017, &quot;Real Time&quot; debuted a new theme song and a new set. The new theme song continues in the path of its predecessor by showcasing important political events including the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. The new season retained the basic format of the showa top-of-the-show guest, a table discussion and a mid-show guest. The biggest change in terms of set design has been that the main table where Bill Maher and two or three guests discuss current political events is moved closer to the audience after the top of the show interview is completed. In addition to this, some mid-show guests including Leah Remini, Jake Tapper, Ralph Reed and Barbra Streisand have been interviewed on a separate side table. Though mid-show guests like Remini and Tapper have not taken part in any discussion on the main show after their interview or appeared on Overtime, the segment which is broadcast on YouTube, other guests like Reed have.
===Changes between 2020 and 2024===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;Real Time&quot; moved from Studio 33 to being taped from Maher&#x27;s home in Beverly Hills with guests appearing remotely from the April 3, 2020, episode to August 23, 2020. Bill Maher and his production team returned to their usual studio on August 28, 2020, their first show produced back in studio since March 2020. Changes to production were made for the return to the studio, with no live studio audience, the continuation of using a fake laugh track and archive clips of audiences applauding and laughing during Maher&#x27;s opening monologue, along with social distancing of the crew and interviews with guests via the internet/satellite connections. Since February 5, 2021, the show has allowed regular audience attendees in the studio who have tested negative for COVID-19.

Beginning with the April 3, 2020, episode of Season 18, until the August 21, 2020, episode, &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; had temporarily adjusted its format. All the episodes from this period were filmed from Maher&#x27;s home starting with a monologue either from Maher&#x27;s garden, elsewhere on the grounds of his property, or the living room. The duration of the show consisted of three to four in-depth guest interviews instead of the long-form panel discussion as guests appeared remotely while Maher recorded the discussion from his &quot;man cave&quot; or his garden. The show ended with &quot;New Rules&quot; from Maher&#x27;s garden. There was no &quot;Overtime&quot; segment.

On August 28, 2020, Bill Maher returned to the studio, but with no audience and guests appearing remotely over a video screen. From September 11, 2020, to October 30, 2020, and November 13, 2020, a limited audience was brought in with some guests appearing remotely while others are in studio. November 6, 2020, featured the first show with a limited audience, mainly the staff writers, and all guests appearing in the studio. A format that has been done consistently since the Season 18 finale on November 20, 2020, into Season 19. Since February 5, 2021, of Season 19, the show has allowed regular audience attendees in the studio who have tested negative for COVID-19. After the monologue, Maher speaks with the first guest appearing in the studio sitting in the armchairs moved six feet apart across from another. The panel discussion involves two guests sitting six feet apart from one another across from Maher at the discussion table. And no &quot;Overtime&quot; segment.

The season 19 episode scheduled for May 14, 2021, was canceled after Maher tested positive for COVID-19 during the show&#x27;s weekly testing for COVID. The episode was to feature Neil deGrasse Tyson, Max Brooks, and Dan Carlin as guests. The following May 21 show was canceled as a precaution.
For season 20, the show does not air live, rather it is pre-recorded at 7:00 pm ET with the 10:00 pm ET airing unchanged with the same three guest format from the previous season. &quot;Overtime&quot; returned on January 21, 2022, following the season premiere. Instead of the usual four guests format, it is the three guests, the first guest interviewed after the monologue, and the two guests who sit with Maher at the discussion table during the rest of the show. This format has continued into season 21 and season 22.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
The response to the first season was mostly mixed. On Metacritic, the season has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100 based on 5 critics&#x27; reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Nancy Franklin of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said &quot;There’s also more of Maher in the new show, and it’s no big surprise that more Maher is less. He’s a jerk of the old school, full of unexamined anxiety and arrogance, with a habit of using sexual stereotypes from half a century ago both to put down and to compliment people.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the show &quot;Fox News of the antiwar movement&quot; and described it as &quot;a flagrantly liberal talk show that provides like-minded viewers with instant gratification.&quot;

Television host Larry King called &quot;Real Time&quot; &quot;one of the best shows on television&quot;. Maher was a regular guest on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; as well as co-host at various times, and co-emcee of the final show, along with Ryan Seacrest.

Common Sense Media&#x27;s website says, &quot;Comedian Bill Maher is very funny, very well-informed, and very insightful, but he&#x27;s also very crass.&quot; It later says, &quot;Maher also expects his audience to have plenty of tolerance for blue humor. His jokes are profane and riddled with explicit sexual references, and he often pokes fun at the use and abuse of alcohol and other intoxicants. It&#x27;s funny, but it&#x27;s very much aimed at adults.&quot; The site gives &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; an &quot;overall quality&quot; rating of 4 out of 5 stars.

&quot;Ruthless Reviews&quot; was also positive, saying, &quot;Maher&#x27;s show is as good as ever, which means that the sacred and the profane continue to be discussed with intelligence, humor, and the occasional silliness&quot; and that it &quot;works so well because he selects provocative guests and I can&#x27;t remember the panel ever having a dull conversation. Maher is smart and witty (and clearly in control), which means that he won&#x27;t let his guests get away with bullshit.&quot;

=== Bibliography ===

* &quot;New Rules: Polite Musings from a Timid Observer&quot; (Rodale Books, 2005)

<doc id="1324690" wikidata="Q1370004" url="?curid=1324690" title="Estevanico">
<text>Estevanico (–1539), also known as Mustafa Azemmouri and Esteban de Dorantes and Estevanico the Moor, was the first person of African descent to explore North America. He was one of the last four survivors of the Narváez expedition, along with Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Andrés Dorantes de Carranza, and Alonso del Castillo Maldonado. 

Little is known about Estevanico&#x27;s background but contemporary accounts described him as a &quot;negro alárabe&quot; or &quot;Arabic-speaking black man&quot; native to Azemmour, Morocco. In 1522, he was sold as a slave to the Spanish nobleman Andrés Dorantes de Carranza in the Portuguese-controlled Moroccan town of Azemmour.

Starting in 1528 he participated in the Narváez expedition, which set out from Cuba under the leadership of Pánfilo de Narváez to explore and colonize Spanish Florida. After numerous challenges, including shipwrecks and enslavement by Native Americans, Estevanico, along with three other survivors, escaped their captivity in 1534 and became medicine men. They embarked on an epic journey, covering nearly 2,000 miles, through the American interior, becoming the first Africans and Europeans to enter the American West. Their travels were greeted with respect and admiration from the indigenous communities, and they finally reached a Spanish settlement in Sinaloa, Mexico, in July 1536.

Their tales of rich civilizations in the north captivated Spaniards in Mexico City, leading the Viceroy of New Spain, Antonio de Mendoza, to commission Fray Marcos de Niza to search for the fabled Seven Cities of Cibola. Estevanico served as a guide for the expedition, venturing ahead of the main party with a group of Sonoran Indians and trade goods. However, tragedy struck near Cíbola when the village inhabitants attacked Estevanico, leading to his death. Several contemporary accounts describe his demise but the motivations behind the attack remain unclear.

His journey, as chronicled by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, provided insights into the peoples, wildlife, and geography of western North America.

==Background==

Very little is known about the background of Estevanico. The most comprehensive description of his origins consists of just one line written by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in his Spanish account of the Narváez Expedition. Cabeza de Vaca wrote that he was a &quot;negro alárabe, natural de Azamor&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;an Arabized black, native to Azemmour&quot; or &quot;an Arabic-speaking black man, a native of Azamor&quot;. This same chronicle does not mention Estevanico&#x27;s enslavement but other contemporary documents make it clear that he was owned by Andrés Dorantes de Carranza, a Spanish nobleman who participated in the expedition.

Most contemporary accounts referred to him by his personal nicknames Estevanico, Estevan, or simply &quot;el negro&quot; (a common Spanish term, meaning &quot;the black&quot;).

As a young man, Estevanico was sold into slavery in 1522 in the Portuguese-controlled Moroccan town of Azemmour, on the Atlantic coast. He was sold to Andrés Dorantes de Carranza. It is unclear whether he was raised Muslim but Spain did not allow non-Catholics to travel to New Spain, so he would have been baptized as a Catholic in order to join the expedition. His Christian name Estevan, a Spanish form of &quot;Stephen,&quot; supports this.

==Narváez expedition==
The expedition of some 300 men, led by the newly appointed &quot;adelantado&quot; (governor) of La Florida, Pánfilo de Narváez, left Cuba in February 1528 intending to go to Isla de las Palmas near present-day Tampico, Mexico, to establish two settlements. Storms and strong winds forced the fleet to the western coast of Florida. The Narváez expedition landed in present-day St. Petersburg, Florida, on the shores of Boca Ciega Bay. Narváez ordered his ships and 100 men and 10 women to sail north in search of a large harbor that his pilots assured them was nearby. He led another 300 men, with 42 horses, north along the coast, intending to rejoin his ships at the large harbor. There is no large harbor north of Boca Ciega Bay, and Narváez never saw his ships again.

After marching 300 miles north, and having armed confrontations with Native Americans, the survivors built boats to sail westward along the Gulf Coast shoreline hoping to reach Pánuco and the Rio de las Palmas. A storm struck when they were near Galveston Island, Texas. Approximately 80 men survived the storm, being washed ashore at Galveston Island. After 1529, three survivors from one boat, including Estevanico, became enslaved by Coahuiltecan Indians; in 1532, they were reunited with a survivor from a different boat, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca. The four spent years enslaved on the Texas barrier islands.

In 1534 the four survivors escaped into the American interior and became medicine men. The four men, Cabeza de Vaca, Andrés Dorantes de Carranza, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado and Estevan, escaped captivity in 1534 and traveled west into present-day Texas Southwestern US, and Northern Mexico. They were the first Europeans and African to enter the American West. Having walked nearly 2,000 miles since their initial landing in Florida, they finally reached a Spanish settlement in Sinaloa. They traveled from there to Mexico City, 1,000 miles to the south. As medicine men they were treated with great respect and offered food, shelter, and gifts, and villages held celebrations in their honor. When they decided they wanted to leave, the host village would guide them to the next village. Sometimes as many as 3,000 people would follow them to the next village. The party traversed the continent as far as western Mexico, into the Sonoran Desert to the region of Sonora in New Spain (present-day Mexico). After finding a small Spanish settlement, the four survivors travelled 1,000 miles to the south to Mexico City, arriving in July 1536.

Cabeza de Vaca published the &quot;Relación&quot;, a book about their 8-year survival journey, in 1542 and included information about Estevanico. It was reprinted again in 1555. It was the first published book to describe the peoples, wildlife, flora and fauna of inland North America, and the first to describe the American bison. In the &quot;Relación&quot;, Cabeza de Vaca said Estevanico often went in advance of the other three survivors because Estevanico had learned some parts of the indigenous language.

==Expedition to New Mexico==
In Mexico City, the four survivors of the expedition told stories of wealthy indigenous tribes to the north, which created a stir among Spaniards in Mexico. When the three Spaniards declined to lead an expedition to the north, Antonio de Mendoza, the Viceroy of New Spain, commissioned Fray Marcos de Niza to lead an expedition north in search of the fabled Seven Cities of Cibola. Estevanico was instructed to serve as a guide for the expedition. In a letter to Charles V, Mendoza wrote &quot;I retained a negro who had come with Dorantes&quot;. According to a contemporary source, Mendoza either purchased Estevanico or received him as a gift from Dorantes. There is some evidence that Mendoza emancipated Estevanico; he was added to the viceroy&#x27;s personal guard and never again referred to as a slave.

On 7 March 1539, the expedition left from Culiacán, the northernmost Spanish settlement in Nueva Galicia. Estevanico traveled ahead of the main party with a group of Sonoran Indians and a quantity of trade goods. As before, he assumed the role of a medicine man, wearing bells and feathers on his arms and ankles and carrying a gourd rattle decorated with strings of bells and two feathers. He was instructed by Fray Marcos to communicate by sending back crosses to the main party, with the size of the cross indicating the importance of his discoveries. One day, a cross arrived that was as tall as a person and the messengers said that Estevanico had heard reports of seven large and wealthy cities in a land to the north called Cíbola. The advance party proceeded to the north in search of Cíbola despite instructions from Fray Marcos to wait for him.

==Death accounts==
When Estevanico was within a day&#x27;s journey of Cíbola, he sent a messenger ahead to announce his arrival. When informed of Estevanico&#x27;s impending visit, the chief of the first village angrily ordered the messenger to leave and threatened to kill anyone who came back. Estevanico seemed unconcerned by these threats and proceeded to Cíbola. When the party arrived, the villagers took their trade goods and held them overnight without food or water. One of the Indians who had been with Estevanico&#x27;s party managed to escape and hide nearby. The next morning he saw the men of Cíbola chasing Estevanico and shooting arrows at him. He did not see what happened to the African, but others in his party were killed. The hidden Indian hurried to tell Fray Marcos what he had witnessed.

Upon hearing the news of the attack, Fray Marcos hurried forward. Soon he met two more Sonorans from the advance party who were wounded and bloodstained. They did not know for certain the fate of Estevanico but they assumed he was dead. After hearing this, De Niza quickly returned to New Spain and wrote an account of his expedition for the viceroy. In his &quot;Relacíon&quot;, he reported on the death of Estevanico at Hawikuh as related to him by members of the African&#x27;s party.

A year later, a much larger Spanish expedition led by Francisco Vázquez de Coronado reached the pueblo where Estevanico was reported killed. In August 1540, he wrote to the viceroy that &quot;the death of the negro is perfectly certain because many of the things which he wore have been found.&quot; He also wrote that the inhabitants of the Zuni pueblo where he died had killed Estevanico because he was a &quot;bad man&quot; who killed and assaulted their women.

Other contemporary accounts of Estevanico&#x27;s death are known. Pedro de Castañeda de Nájera, a chronicler of the Coronado expedition, wrote that the men of Cibola killed him because they were offended when he asked them for turquoise and women. Hernando Alarcon, also a member of the expedition, was told that when Estevanico bragged that he had numerous armed followers nearby, the chiefs of Cibola killed him before he could reveal their location to his followers. Sancho Dorantes de Carranza, the grandson of Andrés Dorantes de Carranza, wrote that Estevanico was &quot;shot through with arrows like a Saint Sebastian.&quot;

Modern historians have advanced other theories to explain Estevanico&#x27;s death. Roberts and Roberts have suggested that Estevanico, who wore owl feathers and carried a medicine-man&#x27;s gourd, may have been seen by the Zuni as impersonating a medicine man, which they punished by death. Others theorize that he may have resembled an evil sorcerer who existed in the Zuni religion, the &quot;Chakwaina&quot; kachina.&quot;

Juan Francisco Maura suggested in 2002 that the Zuni did not kill Estevanico, but rather he and his friends remained among the who probably helped him fake his death so he could regain his freedom. Some folklore legends say that the Kachina figure, &quot;Chakwaina,&quot; is based on Azemmouri.

==Legacy==
Estevanico was the first non-Native to visit Pueblo lands.

<text>Pawn Shoppe Heart is the major-label debut of American garage rock revival band The Von Bondies, and their second album, released in 2004.

The record was met with critical acclaim, and helped lend even further voice to the Detroit garage punk underground brought to mainstream success by The White Stripes two years prior. The record has an average score of 80/100 on Metacritic. On the last track, after the three-minute silence following &quot;Pawn Shoppe Heart&quot;, there&#x27;s a hidden track: a cover of &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot;, a song made popular by Otis Redding.

A shortened version of &quot;C&#x27;mon C&#x27;mon&quot; was the theme song for the American comedy-drama television show, &quot;Rescue Me&quot;. It is featured on the video games &quot;Burnout 3: Takedown&quot; and &quot;MVP Baseball 2004&quot;. The track &quot;Mairead&quot; is about Queens of Noize DJ Mairead Nash, who has been associated with Jason Stollsteimer. MLB Network uses a brief clip of &quot;C&#x27;mon C&#x27;mon&quot; as the opening of their show &quot;30 Clubs in 30 Days&quot;. &quot;C&#x27;mon C&#x27;mon&quot; was also released as downloadable content for &quot;Rock Band&quot; and &quot;Rock Band 2&quot; on March 31, 2009 for Xbox 360 and April 2, 2009 for PS3. This track became available as DLC for the Wii version of &quot;Rock Band 2&quot; on April 7, 2009 for $2 (200 Wii Points).

<doc id="1324717" wikidata="Q640337" url="?curid=1324717" title="Dil Ne Jise Apna Kahaa">
<text>Dil Ne Jise Apna Kahaa () is a 2004 Indian Hindi-language romantic drama film starring Salman Khan, Preity Zinta, Bhumika Chawla, Delnaaz Paul, Riya Sen and Helen. It is an unofficial adaptation of the American film &quot;Return to Me&quot; (2000). The film had a poor opening and proved to be unsuccessful at the box office.

== Plot ==
The movie begins with a young couple named Rishabh (Salman Khan) and Pari (Preity Zinta), who are deeply in love. He is wealthy chief editor at an advertising agency for film ads, and she is a hardworking, dedicated doctor. They marry, and soon Pari is pregnant. Pari has a dream to create a hospital for children. Tragically, she is involved in an accident and dies in the hospital after losing her unborn child as well from internal bleeding. Pari&#x27;s last wish was to donate her heart to her patient Dhani (Bhumika Chawla). Rishabh is devastated and refuses to go on with the plan to donate the heart; he goes ahead with Pari&#x27;s last request: the creation of the children’s hospital which Rishabh names Parilok (fairyland).

Dhani is cured, much to the joy of her family and her grandmother (Helen). Rishabh has gone into depression but soon comes across Pari&#x27;s project to build Parilok. He begins to develop the project with the aid of his brother-in-law RT, and his team of project coordinators and architects. Soon enough, Rishabh and Dhani come across each other now that she works in his agency as a copywriter, and she feels an instant attraction to him. Rishabh becomes disgruntled and ignores her advances as he is still very much in love with Pari. RT begins to see a huge change in the agency since Dhani began working for them but Rishabh suggests that she should quit. By the time the early concepts for the Parilok hospital come in, Rishabh snaps at Dhani after she disapproves of the designs of the hospital. RT tries to get through with Rishabh’s miserableness and questions why he snapped at Dhani. 

RT explains Rishabh’s bitterness to Dhani and tells her that Pari had donated her heart to a dying patient and that Rishabh hates Pari’s new heart donor. Dhani now knows the truth and that she now has Pari’s heart. She confronts Pari’s colleague and reveals her the truth and that everything that Pari used to love and hate are all linked to her heart. The next day, Dhani pulls together her version of the Parilok hospital concepts and everyone is amused by her presentation. Rishabh does not know that Pari&#x27;s heart was given to Dhani, but soon he realizes that after Dhani collapses on his doorstep after nastily telling her to leave his house. Rishabh feels that he’s always responsible for someone’s death. Pari’s especially. His sister tells him that God must have given him the chance to love Pari again through Dhani. She gives him two choices: either to accept Dhani through Pari’s heart or let her die. Rishabh agrees to accept this fate. While she is in the hospital, with doctors struggling to restart her broken heart, he falls in love with her. He tells her that he loves her, and if she loves him, she will pull through. She does, and the two get together.

<text>Bull&#x27;s-Eye Ball (called Hot Shot in Germany) is a skee ball game developed by Hasbro (through its subsidiary Tiger Electronics). Small steel balls must be bounced via an elastic diaphragm into a narrow inlet in order to win points. The entire device is approximately the size of four soda cans. It consists of 3 different games: 30 Second Blitz, where the goal is to get as many points as possible within 30 seconds; 25 Point Rush, where the player must get 25 points as fast as possible; and Bull&#x27;s-Eye Ace, where the player tries to get a large percentage of bull&#x27;s-eyes.

There are several editions of Bulls-Eye Ball, including Bulls-Eye Ball 2 (with a new addition, Target Master), Bulls-Eye Ball Platinum, and a baseball edition, Bulls-Eye Ball Baseball.

<doc id="1324724" wikidata="Q7169129" url="?curid=1324724" title="Perlan Project">
<text>Perlan Project Inc. is a not-for-profit aeronautical exploration and atmospheric science research organization that utilizes sailplanes (gliders) designed to fly at extremely high altitudes.

On 29 August 2006 Steve Fossett and Einar Enevoldson, the pilots of Perlan Mission I, broke the existing altitude record for gliders by soaring up to 50,671 feet (15,460m) in a standard glider using stratospheric waves of air.

The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale has ratified the altitude record of achieved on 2 September 2018, a substantial improvement over the previous year&#x27;s best altitude of , which was set on 3 September 2017. These flights used the custom designed and built pressurized high-altitude Windward Performance Perlan II glider, sponsored by Airbus. They also collected data about Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and its ozone layer.

==Meteorological basis of the missions==
Standing mountain waves are a source of rising air used in the sport of soaring. Riding these waves, similar in some ways to surfing on an ocean wave, has been widely used to reach great altitudes in sailplanes since they were discovered by German glider pilots, including Wolf Hirth, in 1933 in the Riesengebirge. This method uses the powerfully rising and sinking air in mountain waves. Gliders regularly climb in these waves to high altitudes.

Prior to the 4 September 2017 flight, the glider absolute world altitude record stood at 15,460 meters (50,727 feet), which is the altitude reached by Steve Fossett and Einar Enevoldson during Perlan Mission I. The previous record was 14,938 meters (49,009 feet). It was set in 1986 by Robert R. Harris, flying from California City and reaching his record height over Mount Whitney, California. This may be near the limit for standing mountain waves in temperate latitudes, although in unusual meteorological conditions much higher altitudes may be achievable.

Standing waves normally do not extend above the tropopause at temperate latitudes. A strong west wind usually decreases above the tropopause, which has been shown to cap or prevent the upward propagation of standing mountain waves. However, at the outer boundary of the polar vortex, in winter, the stratospheric polar night jet exists. Its wind field can join with the wind field of the polar jet stream. The result is a wind which increases with altitude through the tropopause and upward to 100,000 feet or above. When this conjunction of winds occurs over a barrier mountain, standing mountain waves will propagate through that entire altitude range. Einar Enevoldson, former NASA test pilot, sought to demonstrate the feasibility of riding these stratospheric standing mountain waves. The weather conditions favorable, although not in every case required to exist simultaneously for a climb into the stratospheric waves, are not exceptional. The following list of requirements for record attempts was given in an article published in 2014:

*Prefrontal conditions
*Ridge top winds ≥ 40 knots
*Winds within 30 degrees of perpendicular to ridgeline
*Strong low-level winds
*A stable atmosphere
*A gradual wind increase in altitude
*A weak tropopause
These conditions often occur during late winter and early spring over the southern Andes and Scandinavia.

These conditions are likely to occur in the southern region of Patagonia three to four times per year between mid-August and mid-October. They probably occur in New Zealand, but less frequently; over the Antarctic Peninsula more frequently; and at several locations in the northern hemisphere, but closer to the North Pole at latitudes above 60° north.

==Objectives==

The overall objective of the project is to show that sailplane flight well into the middle stratosphere—in the vicinity of 90,000 feet—can be done safely, repeatedly and economically.
A sailplane is an ideal platform for several scientific and technological research endeavors:
*A sailplane can maneuver precisely at very high altitudes to traverse or remain relatively stationary in a desired portion of the wave structure, as the structure is determined in flight.
*A sailplane can remain on station for several hours to record the evolution of the wave.
*A sailplane with modern, compact, low power instrumentation makes possible the recording of air mass motion precisely, as well as the collection of samples for later ground analysis or analysis in flight.
*A sailplane has high strength and great controllability. It is ideal for penetrating breaking waves to determine the turbulence structure and ensuing flight dynamics.
*A sailplane at 90,000 feet altitude flies in approximately the same aerodynamic regime—Mach and Reynolds numbers—to be experienced by a moderate size aircraft flying near the surface of Mars.
*A sailplane may carry aerodynamic instrumentation to measure the boundary layer behavior in this regime better than can be done in any wind tunnel.

==History==

Einar Enevoldson conceived the project in 1992, after seeing the new LIDAR images of standing mountain waves west of Kiruna, Sweden, that Wolfgang Renger of the DLR, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany had posted on his office wall. Enevoldson collected evidence on the location, prevalence, and strength of stratospheric mountain waves during the period 1992-1998. Starting in 1998 Elizabeth Austin expanded the data analysis and put the project on a firm meteorological basis, with the observation that the stratospheric polar night jet was the principal factor enabling the propagation of standing mountain waves high into the middle stratosphere. At this time a small group at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center analysed the flight dynamics and aerodynamics of sailplane flight up to 100,000 feet.

In 1999, Steve Fossett heard that Enevoldson was trying to find funding, and immediately asked to join the project. United States Air Force, on the basis of NASA request, loaned the project full pressure suits. A Glaser-Dirks DG-500 (DG 505M) motorized glider was modified to remove all engine and related equipment and the space used for storage of liquid oxygen and a large supply of Li-SO2 primary batteries. Most of the instruments and electronics were replaced with equipment suitable for the extreme altitudes that the sailplane would encounter. Duncan Cummings, of San Pedro, California, built special, lightweight, efficient, reliable faceplate heat controllers. Butler Parachute Company built special high altitude stabilized parachutes.

Enevoldson and Fossett flew the sailplane from California City for shakedown and preliminary high altitude flights in the Sierra Nevadas of California, reaching over 42,000 feet in Spring 2002. In Summer 2002, the sailplane was shipped to Omarama, New Zealand, where it flew during three winters without reaching the stratosphere. The timing was too early in the season.

Perlan Mission I was designed to prove Enevoldson&#x27;s thesis by actually flying into and climbing these stratospheric mountain waves. In 2005, the sailplane was shipped to El Calafate, Argentina, a small town at 50° south latitude. Five attempts in a three-week period, none in favorable weather conditions, were unsuccessful. In 2006, the forecast offered very favorable conditions on 28 August but at 33,000 feet, in a strong climb, Steve Fossett&#x27;s pressure suit inflated prematurely and excessively, and the flight was aborted. The next day, on 29 August, after one of the pressure suit regulators had been changed, the weather conditions were still favorable, the team made another attempt. After a four-hour climb, Enevoldson and Fossett reached the record altitude of 50,671 feet (15,460m), validating the concept.

Because the record flight of 29 August 2006 proved Enevoldson&#x27;s thesis, Steve Fossett agreed to fund, progressively, the next mission: to build a special purpose sailplane with a pressurized cabin to fly to 90,000 feet. At the time of Steve&#x27;s death on 3 September 2007, the structural and aerodynamic design of the fuselage had been completed, along with the aerodynamic design of the entire sailplane. Funding for the remainder of the Perlan Project was lost with Steve&#x27;s death, and a search for new funding was begun.

==Airbus Perlan Mission II==
After Fossett&#x27;s death in 2007, it appeared for a time that the mission was on permanent hiatus. However, a new team gradually reassembled around Enevoldson and partial funding was secured thanks to commitments from partners in the United States and Australia. Einar Enevoldson reported in September 2008, that Morgan Sandercock, an experienced sailplane pilot from Australia, had provided funds to restart the project. This funding was put to completing the fuselage with pressure cabin and do the structural tests on it, but additional funds were needed to complete the aircraft.

In June 2010, Dennis Tito joined the mission as a pilot and major funder, which enabled significant progress towards the completion of the aircraft. That same year Jim Payne, holder of numerous world soaring records, joined the project as chief pilot.

A great deal of design work has been done by Greg Cole of Windward Performance to show that a sailplane for 90,000 feet is relatively straightforward, while 100,000 feet is possible, although more difficult and expensive. Windward Performance would build the sailplane of high performance pre-preg in production-quality tooling. The sailplane required relatively high-end design, analysis, and construction to be flutter-safe at very high true air speeds, and strong enough for the potentially heavy turbulence that could be encountered at 90,000 feet. It must also have well-proven, fail-safe pressurization and cabin air re-cycling systems.

In 2014, Airbus agreed to become the title sponsor, and provide sufficient funding for completion of the aircraft, flight testing and the altitude flights. The mission was renamed the Airbus Perlan Mission II.
RDD Enterprises, an aviation research, design and development company based in Redmond, Oregon, took over the manufacture of the Perlan 2.

===Flight campaigns===

The aircraft was completed in the summer of 2015, with first flight scheduled for 7 September. Windy conditions that day prevented the flight, which finally occurred on 23 September. Flight testing started in Minden, NV in fall and winter of 2015, using a new hangar donated by Tito. The first attempts to reach 90,000 feet will be launched from El Calafate, Argentina, deep in the south of Patagonia, in the Southern Hemisphere soon afterwards in summer of 2016.

Jim Payne (USA) and Morgan Sandercock (Australia) set a new altitude record of 15,902 metres (52,172 feet) from Comandante Armando Tola International Airport in El Calafate, Argentina. The flight took place on 3 September 2017.

The 2018 season was again based at El Calafate. The project acquired a Grob G 520 Egrett turboprop aircraft for use as a tow plane. This enabled Perlan II to be towed to This seems to be the highest glider tow, although such records are not registered.

On 26 August 2018 Jim Payne and Morgan Sandercock reached an altitude of .
This was followed by with Jim Payne and Miguel Iturmendi on 28 August 2018.
On 2 September 2018, Jim Payne and Tim Gardner reached an altitude of , surpassing the attained by Jerry Hoyt on 17 April 1989 in a Lockheed U-2: the highest manned, heavier-than-air, subsonic flight.
The Perlan 2 could fly to if conditions allow, higher than the manned level flight altitude record of the SR-71 Blackbird at .
Previous records were measured with pressure altitude; high altitude soaring records now require GPS data.
