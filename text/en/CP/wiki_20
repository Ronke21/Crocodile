<text>Joseph &quot;Jeph&quot; Loeb III () is an American film and television writer, producer and comic book writer. Loeb was a producer/writer on the TV series &quot;Smallville&quot; and &quot;Lost&quot;, writer for the films &quot;Commando&quot; and &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;, and a writer and co-executive producer on the NBC TV show &quot;Heroes&quot; from its premiere in 2006 to November 2008. From 2010 to 2019, Loeb was the Head of and Executive Vice President of Marvel Television.

A four-time Eisner Award winner and five-time Wizard Fan Awards winner, Loeb&#x27;s comic book work, which has appeared on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, includes work on many major characters, including Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, Hulk, Captain America, Cable, Iron Man, Daredevil, Supergirl, the Avengers, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, much of which he has produced in collaboration with artist Tim Sale.

==Early life==
Jeph Loeb was raised in a Jewish family in Stamford, Connecticut. He began collecting comic books in mid-1970.

His stepfather was a vice-president at Brandeis University, where Jeph met one of his mentors and greatest influences in comic book writing, the writer Elliot Maggin. Jeph attended Columbia University, where he was a member of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and a Master&#x27;s degree in Film. His instructors included Paul Schrader.

==Career==
===Film and television===
Loeb&#x27;s debut in filmmaking was his collaboration with Matthew Weisman in authoring the script of &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;. The film was released on August 23, 1985, and was a notable starring role for Michael J. Fox. Loeb and Weisman then collaborated in writing the script of &quot;Commando&quot;. The film was released on October 4, 1985, and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. His next screen credit was the film &quot;Burglar&quot;, released on March 20, 1987. The plot was based on the novels of Lawrence Block about fictional burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr. His collaborators were Weisman and Hugh Wilson.

The film was atypical for the time, featuring a female comedic role for starring actress Whoopi Goldberg. His second film that year was &quot;Teen Wolf Too&quot;, a sequel of &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;, which was co-written by Weisman and Tim Kring. The film was released on November 20, 1987. The film featured teen idol Jason Bateman and veteran actor John Astin. Loeb would re-team with Kring almost two decades later for the TV series &quot;Heroes&quot;. Four years later, Loeb was working on a script for &quot;The Flash&quot; as a feature with Warner Bros. While the script deal fell through, Loeb met then publisher Jenette Kahn who asked Loeb to write a comic book for DC Comics.

In 2002, Jeph Loeb wrote the script for the episode of &quot;Smallville&quot;, entitled &quot;Red&quot;, which introduced red kryptonite into the series. He became a supervising producer and has written many episodes since then. He signed a three-year contract, and although producers Miles Millar and Alfred Gough offered to keep him on for future seasons, Loeb left to care for his son, who had cancer (&quot;See Comics career below&quot;).

Loeb later became a writer/producer on the ABC TV series &quot;Lost&quot; during that show&#x27;s second season. Leaving &quot;Lost&quot;, Loeb went on to become Co-Executive Producer and writer on the NBC drama &quot;Heroes&quot;, which his colleague Tim Kring had created. Loeb wrote the teleplay for the first-season episodes &quot;One Giant Leap&quot; and &quot;Unexpected&quot;. The show prominently features the artwork of Tim Sale, Loeb&#x27;s longtime comics collaborator.

The series was nominated for the 2007 Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, and a Writers Guild of America award for Best New Series. It won the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite New TV Drama, as well the Saturn Award for Best Network Television Series. It was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Dramatic Television Series.

Loeb and Tim Kring were presented with the Jules Verne Award for Artistic Achievement at the Jules Verne Festival in Paris, France, on April 22, 2007, for their work on &quot;Heroes&quot;. Loeb himself was also presented with a belated 2005 Jules Verne Award for Best Writing for his work on &quot;Smallville&quot;, which he had not previously been given because his trip to the Festival that year had been cancelled due to his son&#x27;s ill health.

On November 2, 2008, &quot;Daily Variety&quot; reported that Loeb and fellow &quot;Heroes&quot; co-executive producer, Jesse Alexander, were no longer employed on the series. In an interview with Comic Book Resources, Loeb stated, &quot;As of today, Jesse Alexander and I have left &quot;Heroes&quot;. I&#x27;m incredibly proud to have been a big part of the success a show with eight Emmy nods and a win this year for NBC.com. I will miss the superb cast and writing staff and wish everyone the best.&quot; At the time, Loeb had completed writing and producing the third-season episode, &quot;Dual&quot;.

On June 28, 2010, Marvel Entertainment, as part of its expansion into television, appointed Loeb to the position of Executive Vice President, Head of Television of the newly created Marvel Television, in which Loeb would work with publisher Dan Buckley, to create both live-action and animated shows based on Marvel&#x27;s catalog of characters. During his time as the head of Marvel Television, he executive produced live-action shows within the Marvel Cinematic Universe such as &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, &quot;Agent Carter&quot;, and &quot;Inhumans&quot;, shows on Netflix such as &quot;Daredevil&quot;, &quot;Jessica Jones&quot;, &quot;Iron Fist&quot;, &quot;The Punisher&quot;, &quot;Luke Cage&quot;, and the miniseries &quot;The Defenders&quot;, along with younger adult shows like &quot;Runaways&quot; and &quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot;, and other live action or animated shows based on Marvel characters like &quot;M.O.D.O.K.&quot;, &quot;The Gifted&quot;, &quot;Legion&quot;, &quot;Helstrom&quot;.

In October 2019, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige was promoted to Chief Creative Officer of Marvel Entertainment, which includes Marvel Television, prompting Loeb to leave the company after nearly a decade. Loeb had been planning his departure, however, before Feige&#x27;s promotion.

===Comics career===
Loeb is known for his extensive use of narration boxes as monologues to reveal the inner thoughts of characters, though the character interactions he writes are sparse in terms of dialogue.

Jeph Loeb&#x27;s first comic work was &quot;Challengers of the Unknown&quot; vol. 2 #1 – #8 (March – October 1991), which was the first of many collaborations with Tim Sale. Their later collaborations included the -centered &quot;&quot;; &quot;&quot;, a 13-issue limited series; and &quot;&quot;, a 14-issue limited series set in the first years of the hero&#x27;s career. &quot;The Long Halloween&quot; was one of three noted comics that influenced the 2005 feature film &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, the others being &quot;&quot; and &quot;Batman: Year One&quot;. Other Loeb-Sale collaborations at DC include the &quot;Superman for All Seasons&quot; limited series and &quot;&quot;.

At Marvel Comics, Loeb worked on the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; crossover storyline in 1995 and co-created the character X-Man with artist Steve Skroce. Loeb wrote the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; version of Captain America in 1996–1997. He and Tim Sale crafted several limited series for Marvel including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man: Blue&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

Loeb became the writer of &quot;Superman&quot; with issue #151 (Dec. 1999). His tenure on the title, largely drawn by Ed McGuinness, included the &quot;Emperor Joker&quot; and &quot;Our Worlds at War&quot; crossovers. He left &quot;Superman&quot; with issue #183 (August 2002). At the end of 2002, Loeb teamed with artist Jim Lee to create the year-long story arc &quot;Batman: Hush&quot;, which spawned three lines of toys, posters and calendars, and sat at the #1 spot for eleven of the twelve months it was in publication. The following year, Loeb and McGuinness launched &quot;Superman/Batman&quot;. Loeb&#x27;s run on the title spawned a new ongoing &quot;Supergirl&quot; series, and an animated film adapted from Loeb&#x27;s &quot;Public Enemies&quot; story arc.

After signing an exclusive contract with Marvel in September 2005, Loeb launched &quot;Hulk&quot; with artist Ed McGuinness, in which he introduced the Red Hulk.

In 2006, Loeb chose his hometown of Stamford, Connecticut, to be subject to superhero destruction in the first issue of the 2006–2007 Marvel miniseries &quot;Civil War&quot;, the central title of the crossover storyline of the same name. That same year, Marvel announced an untitled &quot;Spider-Man&quot; series by Loeb and J. Scott Campbell, to be released &quot;sometime in 2007&quot;. The series was subsequently cancelled and then brought back on the schedule in 2010, with a 2011 article mentioning it was &quot;still being worked on&quot;. In 2021, Campbell confirmed that the project has been cancelled despite having two fully pencilled issues.

In 2007, Jeph wrote the miniseries &quot;Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America&quot;, which used the five stages of grief as a motif to explore reactions of various characters of the Marvel Universe to the loss of the assassinated Captain America. The first issue ranked No. 1 in sales for April 2007, and the fifth and final issue, dated July 4, 2007, was the &quot;Funeral for Captain America&quot;, which was covered by the Associated Press and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

Loeb wrote two miniseries for the Ultimate Marvel Universe. His work on &quot;The Ultimates 3&quot; in 2007, with artist Joe Madureira, was panned by critics for its use of transgressive sexual and violent content for shock value &quot;without the political relevance or epic pacing of the first two volumes.&quot; In 2008, Loeb returned to the Ultimate Universe with artist David Finch for the critically reviled five-issue miniseries &quot;Ultimatum&quot;. Described in a 2015 Vulture retrospective as &quot;one of the biggest creative disasters in comics history&quot;, &quot;Ultimatum&quot;&#x27;s gratuitous murder scenes permanently damaged sales across the entire Ultimate Universe and in the long run brought about its cancellation. &quot;Over the course of just five issues, 34 different heroes and villains were murdered, often by gruesome means: Doctor Strange was squeezed until his head exploded; Magneto was decapitated; the Blob ate the Wasp and, while holding her half-devoured corpse, belched out, &#x27;Tastes like chicken&#x27;; and so on.&quot; The review site Let&#x27;s Be Friends Again described &quot;Ultimatum&quot; as &quot;a base and insulting comic book.&quot; Critic Jason Kerouac wrote, &quot;&quot;Ultimatum&quot; #5 could quite possibly be the single worst piece of writing in recorded history.&quot;

A &quot;Captain America: White&quot; limited series was announced in 2008 but only a #0 issue was published. The long-delayed project was scheduled to finally see print in September 2015.

Loeb shares his writing studio, The Empath Magic Tree House, with Geoff Johns and Allan Heinberg.

==Personal life==

Loeb&#x27;s son, Sam, died on June 17, 2005, at the age of 17, after a three-year battle with bone cancer. In June 2006, Sam had a story published in &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #26, which was nearly completed before his death. His father finished the work with the help of 25 other writers and artists, all of whom were friends of Sam, including Geoff Johns, John Cassaday, Ed McGuinness, Joe Madureira, Rob Liefeld, and Joss Whedon. The issue also featured a tale titled &quot;Sam&#x27;s Story&quot;, dedicated to Sam, in which a boy named Sam serves as the inspiration for Clark Kent to later become Superman.

==Racial controversy==
During Loeb&#x27;s tenure as the head of Marvel Television, the Netflix shows &quot;Daredevil&quot;, &quot;Iron Fist&quot; and &quot;The Defenders&quot; were criticized for promoting negative stereotypes of East Asians and East Asian culture. Following the controversy surrounding &quot;Iron Fist&quot;″s casting, Loeb defended the casting of white actor Finn Jones, emphasizing that Danny Rand&#x27;s status as an &quot;outsider&quot; was a vital theme of the show.

While promoting the second season of &quot;Iron Fist&quot; at San Diego Comic-Con 2018, Loeb appeared on stage wearing a karate gi and headband as part of a comic bit with &quot;Iron Fist&quot; actress Jessica Henwick, who forced him to remove the costume. The stunt was heavily criticized as culturally insensitive.

During the #SaveDaredevilCon panel for Comic-Con@Home in July 2020, Peter Shinkoda, a Canadian actor of Japanese descent who played recurring villain Nobu Yoshioka on &quot;Daredevil&quot;, suggested that Loeb forced the show&#x27;s writers to drop proposed storylines fleshing out Nobu and fellow recurring villain Madame Gao. Shinkoda accused Loeb of explaining to writers that &quot;there were three previous Marvel movies, a trilogy called &quot;Blade&quot; that was made where Wesley Snipes killed 200 Asians each movie. Nobody gives a shit so don&#x27;t write about Nobu and Gao.&quot; Shinkoda also claimed that he and Gao&#x27;s actress Wai Ching Ho were not invited to the season 2 premiere of &quot;Daredevil&quot; and received less payment than the extras. Co-star Tommy Walker said that &quot;Daredevil&quot; and &quot;Defenders&quot; showrunner Doug Petrie had previously pitched a multiracial Asian American version of &quot;Iron Fist&quot; to Marvel Television in early development, but was rejected by Loeb.

===Critical reaction===
Many of Loeb&#x27;s books, such as &quot;Batman: The Long Halloween&quot;, &quot;Superman For All Seasons&quot;, and the Marvel &quot;color&quot; books (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man: Blue&quot;, &quot;&quot;) have garnered critical praise, and have been adapted into other media.

&quot;Hulk&quot; #1, in which Loeb introduced the Red Hulk, was the #1 selling comic book for January 2008. Subsequent issues sold well, but received mixed to negative reviews. Issues #7–9 of the series, along with &quot;King-Size Hulk&quot; #1, were collected into a trade paperback volume, &quot;Hulk: Red and Green&quot;, which made the &quot;New York Times&quot; Graphic Books Best Seller List in May 2009 (as did &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8&quot;, Volume 4, on which Loeb collaborated).

The first issue of Loeb&#x27;s &quot;The Ultimates 3&quot; continued the series&#x27; history of ranking at No. 1 in sales, though the series was much less well-received critically than its predecessors.

The first issue of &quot;Ultimatum&quot; ranked No. 1 in sales for November 2008. At Weekly Comic Book Review, Andrew C. Murphy gave it a B+, praising David Finch&#x27;s art, while Ben Berger gave it a C, opining that there was too much exposition, but praising Finch&#x27;s art. The rest of the series, however, received more negative reviews. IGN&#x27;s Jesse Schedeen gave the series&#x27; final issue a scathing review, saying, &quot;Ultimatum is one of the worst comics I have ever read,&quot; and called it &quot;the ultimate nightmare.&quot; Points of criticism among these reviews included the level of graphic violence, which included cannibalism, and the notion that the series was sold on the basis of its shock value, with some reviewers singling out Loeb&#x27;s dialogue, characterization and storytelling, others asserting the story&#x27;s lack of originality, or opining that the series would&#x27;ve been better suited to someone who had previously been more involved with the Ultimate line, such as Brian Michael Bendis or Mark Millar.

In 2009 &quot;Ultimates 3&quot; and &quot;Ultimatum&quot; were included on ComicsAlliance&#x27;s list of The 15 Worst Comics of the Decade.

Loeb was also awarded an honorary doctorate by St. Edward&#x27;s University in Austin, Texas, and an Inkpot Award.

<text>A panda car, or just panda, is a small- or medium-sized marked British police car.

==History of the term==
The term &#x27;panda car&#x27; was first used to refer to black police cars with panels that had been painted white to increase their visibility. It was later applied to blue and white police cars.

There is a record of Salford City Police using black and white Hillman Minxes in 1960.

The chief constable of the Lancashire Constabulary referred to the use of blue and white Ford Anglia panda cars in Kirkby in an article in &quot;The Times&quot; on 26 January 1966.
In 1967, the Dunbartonshire force bought two Hillman Imps (subsequently nicknamed Pinky and Perky) for escort duties on the A82 road; one was blue, the other white. The boot lids, bonnets and doors were then swapped to create a panda car style scheme. 

In the 1980s, police cars in the United Kingdom began to be ordered in white to reduce purchase costs, usually with orange or red &quot;jam sandwich&quot; reflective stripes. Today, patrol cars use Battenburg markings or stripes, although many forces still use a mainly white colour scheme. The name &quot;panda car&quot; or &quot;panda&quot; is still sometimes used.

==Roles==
In many areas, the panda car replaced the traditional &quot;bobby on the beat&quot;, when it was seen that larger suburban or rural areas could be more effectively patrolled by officers in cars, as opposed to on foot, bicycles, or motorcycles. 

The provision of shelter from the weather, and a two way radio, were also benefits. 

The panda is distinct from the &quot;area car&quot;, a larger and more powerful vehicle which acts as support to the beat constables, usually carrying two officers. Current usage within the Metropolitan Police Service uses the term &quot;panda car&quot; to refer specifically to a marked car driven by a basic driver (i.e., one constrained to drive within normal traffic rules, and who may not use the vehicle&#x27;s siren). 

This contrasts with an IRV (immediate response vehicle) which could be exactly the same vehicle but driven by a response driver (i.e., one trained and permitted to disregard certain traffic laws and use the siren, as one would normally expect from police vehicles). The callsign attached to the vehicle for the duration of the shift should normally make it clear whether it is functioning as a panda or IRV at the time.

== Pop culture ==
In the &quot;Detective Conan&quot; manga and animated series, the case &quot;The Man From Chicago&quot; refers to panda cars in the United Kingdom.

<text>Timothy Roger Sale (May 1, 1956 – June 16, 2022) was an American comics artist, &quot;best known for his work on the DC Comics characters Batman and Superman and for influencing depictions of Batman in numerous films.&quot; He is primarily known for his collaborations with writer Jeph Loeb, which included both comics work and artwork for the TV series &quot;Heroes&quot;. Sale&#x27;s renditions of Batman influenced modern cinematic depictions of the character, with film directors and actors directly citing Sale&#x27;s work.

==Early life==
Tim Sale was born on May 1, 1956, in Ithaca, New York, the son of Dorothy Young, a feminist political activist, and Roger Sale, a literary critic.

He spent most of his early life in Seattle, Washington, having moved there with his family at age six. He attended the University of Washington for two years before moving to New York City to attend the School of Visual Arts, as well as the comics workshop run by artist John Buscema. Mr. Sale completed the &quot;John Buscema Art School, which was advertised in the pages of Marvel Comics and held in a New York City hotel for a short time in the 1970s.&quot;

He returned to Seattle before graduating from SVA.

==Career==

Sale began doing art for the series &quot;MythAdventures&quot; in 1983, and was soon working on &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot;.

The body of Sale&#x27;s comics work has been with collaborator Jeph Loeb. The duo, credited in their comics as &#x27;storytellers&#x27;, produced popular work such as the -centered &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, as well as &quot;Superman for All Seasons&quot; and &quot;&quot;. At Marvel Comics, the team has produced the so-called &quot;color&quot; books such as &quot;Daredevil: Yellow&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man: Blue&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. A &quot;Captain America: White&quot; limited series was announced in 2008 but only a #0 issue was published. The long-delayed project finally saw print in September 2015.

With Darwyn Cooke, Sale launched the &quot;Superman Confidential&quot; series in 2007.

Sale worked on artwork for the television program &quot;Heroes&quot;, where his frequent collaborator Jeph Loeb served as a writer and producer. Sale&#x27;s artwork appeared in the show as the work of the precognitive artist Isaac Mendez as well as other artists on the show. Eric Powell was hired as the colorist for Sale&#x27;s work. Sale also created the font used in the show&#x27;s captions and credits, which he based on his handwriting.

In 2021, &quot;&quot; was adapted for a two-part animated film from Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.

==Awards==
Sale won an Eisner Award in 1999 in the &quot;Best Artist/Penciller/Inker or Penciller/Inker Team&quot; category.

==Personal life and death==
Sale lived in the Seattle metropolitan area. On June 13, 2022, Jim Lee announced Sale had been admitted to the hospital with severe health issues. Representatives of Sale later confirmed he was in the hospital while asking for privacy. Three days later, Sale died on June 16, from kidney failure. &quot;He is survived by his mother; his sister, Maggie Sale; and his partner, Susan Bailey.&quot;

==Legacy==
DC Comics publisher Jim Lee praised Sale, saying, &quot;Tim Sale was an amazing artist, draftsman and storyteller. Beyond the taut chiaroscuro style which became his trademark. Tim clearly put a premium on storytelling, clarity and pacing — cherishing emotion above all. His stories were beautifully visceral, nuanced and evinced deep humanity. Tim simply had no use for surface banality.&quot;

Filmmakers Christopher Nolan and Matt Reeves, both of whom directed &quot;Batman&quot; films, have cited &quot;&quot; and its sequel, &quot;&quot;, as an influence on those films. In an interview with the website World of Batman, Christian Bale, who played the character, characterized the &quot;really fantastic imagery&quot; with which Sale rendered those works. Commenting on Sale&#x27;s figurework, Bale stated, &quot;I would kind of imitate those positions.&quot;

The legendary Polynesian navigator Kupe landed at Komanga Point, 3 kilometres west of Titahi Bay, leaving an anchor stone which today can be seen at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The area was settled by Māori for many years before the arrival of Europeans, and several pa sites are located nearby. The area was the site of many inter-iwi conflicts, notably in the 1820s, when the area was invaded by the followers of Te Rauparaha.

The first European residents were whalers operating from Korohiwa, between Titahi Bay and Komanga Point.

During World War II, a camp housing US military personnel was built in Titahi Bay.

Titahi Bay is one kilometre long and forms a bay. The boat sheds at the northern and southern ends of the beach are often featured in photographs of the area.

Surfing is a popular activity there. Titahi Bay is a beach break that can be surfed on all tides and is generally best during periods of onshore winds. The surf breaks have a vast array of size and skill sets, from the Rocks (1.5–2 m) to the famous Locals (1-2m) to the Fishermans (inside 2-3m, outside 3-5m) mainly all from a northwesterly swell direction. This all changes when the south swell arrives, with different breaks from different swell directions. A surfing club has operated for over 30 years. Two NZ champions originate from the area. The Titahi Bay Surf Life Saving Club is located in the centre of the bay.

The fossilised remains of a forest from the Pleistocene era are located at Titahi Bay and form an intertidal reef. The forest was dominated by podocarps and tree-ferns and dates from the last interglacial period 150,000–70,000 years ago.

<doc id="1321749" wikidata="Q626632" url="?curid=1321749" title="Auxiliary police">
<text>Auxiliary police, also called volunteer police, reserve police, assistant police, civil guards, or special police, are usually the part-time reserves of a regular police force. They may be unpaid volunteers or paid members of the police service with which they are affiliated; There is no consistent international definition.

Auxiliary police are primarily tasked with supporting and augmenting the police, but this may also extend to established emergency services such as the fire department (and in the case of fire police), emergency medical services, border guard, and coast guard. Duties commonly assigned to auxiliaries include community policing, neighborhood watch, traffic policing, civil defense, and riot control.

The police powers auxiliaries may exercise vary from agency to agency; some have no or limited authority, while others may be accorded full police powers. They may be armed or unarmed.

==Australia==
The Australian Federal Police can appoint special members who do not have full police powers. Special members are generally recruited locally to perform regulatory and administrative duties while others perform community policing duties in locations such as Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and Jervis Bay Territory.

The Western Australia Police has had auxiliary officers since 2009. The role of police auxiliary officers was inserted into the &quot;Police Act 1892&quot; by the &quot;Police Amendment Act 2009&quot;. They generally perform administrative and other duties which do not require full police powers.

The Northern Territory Police has auxiliary officers who can perform administrative duties and communications, plus duties which may require some expertise but do not require police powers such as search and rescue.

The Victoria Police recruited 3,100 auxiliary police to the Victoria Police Auxiliary Force during World War II to assist regular police in the event of emergencies. The Auxiliary Force was disbanded in 1946. A number of retired police were temporarily formed into a Police Reserve to assist with traffic control during the 1956 Summer Olympics. A permanent Retired Police Reserve was established under the &quot;Police Regulation Act 1958&quot;, although today is very small in number.

The New South Wales Police Force formed a Police Reserve of around 500 special constables during World War I. The Police Reserve was formed again during World War II.

==Canada==

In Canada, many police forces utilize the services of auxiliary constables. Under various provincial policing legislations and the &quot;Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act&quot;, the role of auxiliary constable is to assist regular, or sworn, police constables in the execution of their duties, as well as to provide assistance in community policing.

Auxiliary constables in Canada wear uniforms similar to regular force constables. However, most wear the word &quot;auxiliary&quot; on a rocker panel under the force&#x27;s crest on each arm, and in some cases, wear a red and black checkered head band on their service caps to distinguish them from full-time police. Also, auxiliary constables are usually unarmed, but are trained in firearms. They may, depending on legislation and policies, carry a baton and handcuffs while on duty.

Auxiliary officers are often called upon to assist in such things as large-scale searches for missing persons, to provide crowd control at large-scale events, and often accompany regular force police officers on daily patrols.

The Calgary Police Service discontinued their auxiliary cadet program in 2019 due to concerns that volunteers were given supplemental work, which brought about safety and working condition concerns.

==Hong Kong==

The Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force (HKAPF, traditional Chinese: 香港輔助警察隊), established in 1914, provides additional manpower to the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) during emergencies and other incidents. From 1969 to 1997, the HKAPF was known as the Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force (RHKAPF).

Auxiliary police officers are paid hourly wages and have similar duties to full-time members of the HKPF. Most are armed and, like members of the HKPF, are equipped with full gear and weapons including pepper spray, expandable batons and Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 revolvers as sidearms, with spare ammunition, while some are armed with Remington 870 shotguns. The HKAPF reports to the Commissioner of Police.

== Estonia ==
The Assistant Police Officer position was created in Estonia by the &quot;Assistant Police Officer Act&quot;, which was adopted by the Riigikogu on 20 April 1994. It provided the rights, duties and activities of the assistant police officer, defined by Estonian law as a person who is not a member of the Estonian Police but who voluntarily participates in police activities in the cases allowed by local laws. While taking part in police activities, the assistant police officer is a government representative.

Initially, each police officer was guided individually by a police officer to whom they were assigned (usually the region constable). Nowadays they are guided by assistant police officer formations managers, who are appointed by the chief of police.

==Germany==

In Germany, auxiliary police forces (&quot;Freiwilliger Polizeidienst&quot; or &quot;Sicherheitswacht&quot;) exist in the states of Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, and Saxony. The auxiliary police (&quot;Freiwillige Polizei-Reserve&quot;) of Berlin was dissolved in 2002. Their jurisdiction varies between states.

===Baden-Württemberg===
Founded in May 1963, the Baden-Württemberg auxiliary police (&quot;Freiwilliger Polizeidienst Baden-Württemberg&quot;) consists of 1,201 members.

The officers are required to complete two weeks of training after which they are usually deployed on service with a regular police officer. In the eyes of law, they are fully authorized police officers, wear normal police uniforms with a certain patch and complete police gear, including pepper spray, handcuffs and Walther P5 pistol.

Though, the coalition contract of 2011-2016 between the governing political parties Bündnis 90/Die Grünen and the SPD seeks the abolishment of the auxiliary police and the financial supply as well as the recruitment of new auxiliary officers was suspended.

===Bavaria===
The Bavarian auxiliary police (&quot;Bayerische Sicherheitswacht&quot;) was officially founded on 31 December 1996.

Officers have limited legal powers: apart from a citizen&#x27;s arrest, briefly detain and question a person and check their identification and can ask a dangerous person to leave the area (Platzverweis under Article 16, PAG).

Equipped with a radio and pepper spray, they usually patrol on foot or by bicycle and do not wear a full uniform, but either plain clothes with a brassard or a marked shirt.

===Hessen===
The auxiliary police in Hessen (&quot;Freiwilliger Polizeidienst Hessen&quot;) was introduced in October 2000 and employs around 750 members of which approximately 30% are women.

The officers are given 50 hours. Their patrol is limited to beats on foot and serves traffic control, assistance to major events and prevention of crime through mere police presence.

Although they wear ordinary police uniform (except wearing baseball caps instead of peaked caps) with &quot;freiwilliger Polizeidienst&quot; patches, their equipment is generally limited to pepper spray and a mobile phone.

Apart from this, they have limited powers as they may only ask a person to wait with them, briefly interrogate them, ask them to reveal their identity or to leave the area if they appear to be dangerous (Platzverweis under §31 HSOG).

===Saxony===
The auxiliary police of Saxony (&quot;Sächsische Sicherheitswacht&quot;) was formed on 1 April 1998. A third of the 800 active members are women.

After being trained for 60 hours, they usually patrol on foot in blue or green jackets or shirts, showing presence on public transport, openly accessible buildings such as shopping malls and other public areas.

They are equipped with radio and pepper spray and are authorised to conduct a stop (§ 21, Abs. 1 Sächsisches Polizeigesetz) of a similar nature to officers in Bavaria or Hesse.

==Hungary==

In Hungary, the auxiliary police are the Polgárőrség (formally &quot;Nationwide Civil Self-Defense Organization&quot;; directly translated as &quot;Civil Guard&quot;; short name &quot;OPSZ&quot;).

Established in 1989 and brought under the provisions of Act 52 of the Hungarian Parliament in 2006, the Polgárőrség consists of uniformed and unarmed volunteers who take part in police work in various fields such as neighbourhood watch, vehicle patrol, citizen&#x27;s arrests (only in flagrante delicto), assisting the Rendőrség, and youth crime prevention. Since 2009, auxiliary duties were expanded to include traffic directing and crossing guard work. The Polgárőrség also operates an automatic number-plate recognition unit called the Matrix Police.

The presence of the Auxiliary Police, in uniform, on patrol in marked police units has been proven to reduce vandalism and other crimes in the community. The force is made up of 80,000 volunteers.

Hungarian Auxiliary Police members do not possess more authority or rights than any other citizen. Since 2009, auxiliaries can carry pepper spray, direct traffic at traffic collision sites and pedestrian crossings in front of kindergartens and primary schools.

==India==
The Home Guard is an Indian paramilitary force serving as an auxiliary to the Indian Police Service. Home Guards are responsible for internal security, civil defense, border patrol, Coast Guard support, and firefighting assistance. They also maintain functional units dedicated to motor transport, engineering, first aid, water and power operations, communications, and other services.

Members of the Indian Home Guard are equipped with and trained to use older weapons such as the Lee–Enfield SMLE, Sten, and Bren.

==Indonesia==
The Indonesian Auxiliary Police, commonly known as POKDAR (&quot;PokdarKamtibmas&quot;), are the uniformed and non-uniformed auxiliary police of the Indonesian National Police. They were established in 1992.

Their duties are to assist police with neighborhood watch, intelligence gathering, and incident scene security. They are also permitted to assist in undercover operations, though their involvement is minimal. Auxiliaries are unarmed and equipped with radios and handcuffs.

The initial auxiliary uniform was similar to that of the Indonesian National Police, except with the police badge removed. The uniform was later changed to a simple black sleeveless jacket, with &quot;POKDARKAMTIBMAS&quot; written on the back in yellow.

==Ireland==

The Garda Síochána are aided by an auxiliary force called the &quot;Garda Síochána Reserve&quot;, often simply called &quot;Garda Reserve&quot;. The position was created in 2006, with a planned 4,000 persons to join the Reserve according to &quot;An Garda Síochana Act 2005&quot;. The force are mainly involved in legislation relating to traffic, public order, theft and burglary. 
They have limited powers, authorised by the Garda Commissioner. &quot;Garda Reserve&quot; members cannot drive a Garda patrol car, must be accompanied by a full member of the force while on patrol, and aren&#x27;t allowed to carry firearms. Reserve members carry out duties such as event policing, attend court proceedings, assist at road check-points and road collisions. Reserves members are given training in relation to law, human rights, Garda communication, self-defence and Garda discipline and procedures.

==Israel==

The Israeli term for auxiliary police is &quot;Mishmar Ezrachi&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;Civil Guard&quot;. This organization includes uniformed and non-uniformed civilians who volunteer for police work in various fields such as neighbourhood watch, regular patrol, traffic enforcement, bomb squad assistants, youth crime prevention, coast guard, border patrol, and diving operations. The Civil Guard is a division of the Israel Police, and is tasked with first response before regular police units arrive; however, they are generally considered separate from them, with less powers in comparison.

Equipment of the Civil Guard generally consists of a fluorescent yellow police vest, flashlight, radio, firearms, handcuffs and whatever else may be required particular to the assignment. Some volunteers are armed with rifles and, if they have any, personally-owned weapons. Issued equipment is returned at the end of each shift. Most volunteers manage about one shift a week (2 to 4+ hours), while the minimum requirement is 12 hours a month.

The Civil Guard is composed mainly of &quot;classic&quot; volunteers who patrol in a car or on foot. They go through basic training and have limited police powers while on duty. They may apprehend a suspect or make an arrest if necessary. There are also Matmid (מתמיד) volunteers which operate far more intensively than classics in regular police work. Yatam (ית&quot;מ) volunteers mainly operate in traffic control. Both Matmid and Yatam are more like volunteer police officers, with almost all the authorities of a regular police officer, advanced training, and regular police uniforms. The Civil Guard also has special units such as bicycle-riders, search-and-rescue teams, divers, translators, and drivers, but their members have to go through additional training and have a higher level of commitment.

==Malaysia==

In Malaysia, auxiliary police () refers to sworn private security police officers serving in autonomous government agencies and key government-linked companies/entities such as Northport (Malaysia) Bhd (Northport), Petroleum Nasional Berhad (Petronas), the Malaysian Federal Reserve Bank (&quot;Bank Negara&quot;), the National Anti-Drug Agency (&quot;Agensi Anti-Dadah Kebangsaan&quot; – AADK), the Federal Land Development Agency (FELDA) and the Inland Revenue Board (&quot;Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri&quot;); and other institutions with semi-governmental interests. Such institutions include the National Savings Bank (&quot;Bank Simpanan Nasional&quot; – BSN), Malayan Railways Limited (&quot;Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad&quot; – KTMB), Pos Malaysia Holdings Berhad (the national postal service), Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (the largest Malaysian airport operator), the North-South Highway Project (&quot;Projek Lebuhraya Utara Selatan&quot; – PLUS), Tenaga Nasional Berhad (the national power service), Sarawak Energy Berhad (Public Utilities) and other similar strategic organizations.

Most of these organizations have already been privatized, but are allowed to maintain an auxiliary police unit. Under special circumstances, auxiliary police units have also been established by private companies with no government interests at all such as the force maintained by Resorts World Berhad (RWB), the company that operates the popular resort and casino at Genting Highlands. At present, there are 153 government agencies, statutory bodies and private companies authorized to operate their own auxiliary police units, with a total strength of 40,610 personnel.

Malaysian Auxiliary police are not attached &quot;per se&quot; to the Royal Malaysian Police, but are granted some police powers such as the power to carry out minor investigations or to make arrests within their area of jurisdiction. However, they are totally autonomous in matters related to the security of their company&#x27;s premises and facilities. Some forces are also conferred the authority to issue traffic summonses (that are paid to the Federal Government, not the issuing organization) for offences committed on their area of jurisdiction. While Malaysian auxiliary police officers are empowered to carry firearms which is registered and own by the company, for this purpose they are subject to the same application and approval procedures as any other private company instead of being treated as part of the Royal Malaysian Police.

Malaysian Auxiliary police units are not allowed to enforce federal laws outside of their designated company/agency premises or areas, as stated in IGSO H602 Section 3.16. which translate Auxiliary police possess some police powers in their designated company/agency premises or areas only when performing their duty.

Malaysian auxiliary police uniforms have been traditionally different from those of the regular police force, but a consolidation exercise by the Management Department of the Royal Malaysian Police Federal Headquarters (&quot;Bukit Aman&quot;) in 2004 has since authorised the use of regular police dress, insignia and other paraphernalia for sworn auxiliary police officers. The only differences are the unit patches with company logo, e.g. &quot;Polis Bantuan&quot; Petronas (worn by auxiliary police officers only, sewn on the left sleeve), the shoulder title (which says &quot;Polis Bantuan&quot; or Auxiliary Police, instead of &quot;Polis Diraja&quot; or Royal Police) and the service number (worn by junior police officers of Honorary Sergeant Major rank and below, just above the right breast pocket; auxiliary police numbers begin with the letters &#x27;PB12345&#x27; whereas regular police officers numbers do not contain any letters.)

Under Malaysian law, auxiliary police officers are obliged to serve voluntarily and are therefore not paid by the Government. As such, they are designated full-time employees of the departments or corporations they serve and are remunerated on a different scale than regular police officers.

Under the Police Act of 1967 (Revised 1988) (Act 344), the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), with the consent of the Minister in charge of police affairs and the King, may appoint any person to hold honorary auxiliary police ranks to the level of Honorary Superintendent of Police and below, and to establish their areas of jurisdiction.

==Mexico==
The Mexico City Auxiliary Police are security police who work for the Ministry of Public Security and provide protection to government buildings, airports, and infrastructure in Mexico City. They do not protect banks or other financial institutions, as these are protected by the Banking Police (&quot;Bancarios&quot;).

==Netherlands==
Since 1948, the Dutch police have had different forms of voluntary police officers. In 1948, shortly after World War II, the Reserve Police was established as a spare police force that would be pressed into service in the event of an emergency. The Reserve Police, as it was called from 1948 until 1994, consisted of men (and later women) who worked as fully armed and equipped police officers. Similar to their full-time colleagues, they were equipped with a pistol, short baton, and handcuffs.

After police reforms in 1994, volunteer police were fully integrated into the 25 regional police forces. Between 1994 and 2010, volunteers were no longer permitted to carry firearms, though older volunteers had their firearm grandfathered in, provided they continued to train with it and prove competent. Eventually, firearms were returned to volunteer police inventories, but volunteers require a full police diploma, several years of field experience as an unarmed officer, and additional police safety training. In 2012 the initial training program for new voluntary police officers was changed, reducing the training from three years down to one year. Dutch voluntary police officers hold the same police powers and wear the same uniform as their professional counterparts.

Since around the year 2000, police forces in the Netherlands started experimenting with police volunteers who performed administrative, house keeping, and other tasks. Labour unions have always criticized this. As of today, no definitive form for this type of volunteerism has been found and it still is subject of negotiations.

==Norway==
In Norway, conscripts who have completed their initial period of military training can be transferred to the auxiliary police &quot;Politireserven&quot; (PR) rather than joining the military reserves. The PR is managed by the Mobile Police, and is intended to reinforce the regular police in case of national emergencies or disasters. The PR only exists in the central eastern part of the country. After a ten-day introduction course, and with refresher courses every few years, the PR troops can be used for armed or unarmed guard duties, border and traffic checkpoints, and for public order duties.

==Russia==

The Voluntary People&#x27;s Druzhina was the auxiliary law enforcement agency of the Soviet Union. It continues to be the auxiliary police in modern Russia.

==Singapore==
In Singapore, auxiliary police are security police appointed under Section 92(1) or (2) of the Police Force Act 2004. They are vested with all the power, protection and immunity of a police officer of corresponding rank and are licensed to carry firearms when carrying out their duties. Auxiliary police officers are full-time employees of companies known as auxiliary police forces (APF), and are not directly affiliated to the Singapore Police Force (SPF). Auxiliary police officers are trained through attending a residential training course, the curriculum of which is set by the Security Industry Regulatory Department (now the Police Licensing and Regulatory Department), a department of the SPF established by in 2004 to regulate the security industry.

After passing the training course and being appointed as auxiliary police, each auxiliary police officer is issued with a warrant card signed by the Commissioner of Police of the SPF with a National Skills Recognition Scheme certificate.

The first APF originated from the Airport Security Force formed under the Department of Civil Aviation in 1956 to guard and patrol at the former Paya Lebar Airport. In July 1963, it was officially designated as an APF.

In 1965, Malayan Airways formed its own APF as well. In 1967, when Malayan Airways was renamed Malaysia Singapore Airlines (MSA), the Security Department was called MSA Police. When MSA was broken up into Singapore Airlines and Malaysian Airlines System in 1972, the Singapore component of the MSA Police became the SIA Auxiliary Police Force. In 1973, when Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS) was incorporated by SIA as a fully owned subsidiary, the SIA Auxiliary Police Force was renamed the SATS Auxiliary Police Force. In 1989, it was restructured as SATS Security Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of SATS.

In 1972, to meet the need of the commercial world in Singapore for armed guards, till then provided by the SPF&#x27;s Guards and Escort Unit, the Parliament of Singapore passed an act to spin off the Guards and Escort Unit into a statutory board named the Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation (CISCO).

There were also other auxiliary police forces in Singapore such as the Pulau Bukom Auxiliary Police, CIAS Auxiliary Police (since renamed the Aetos Auxiliary Police Force), and the PSA Auxiliary Police (since merged with Aetos). These auxiliary police forces were granted licences and powers under the Police Force Act to operate only in restricted geographical areas, such as in the ports, airports, or Pulau Bukom Island.

In October 2004, following the enactment of the Police Force Act 2004, these auxiliary police forces were no longer restricted to operate in the airport or seaports and could offer their services throughout the whole island of Singapore.

There are currently five auxiliary police forces in Singapore:

* Aetos Auxiliary Police Force (part of Aetos Security Management)
* Certis CISCO Auxiliary Police Force (part of Certis Group)
* Installations Auxiliary Police Force
* Pulau Bukom Auxiliary Police Force
* SATS Auxiliary Police Force (part of SATS Security Services)

In 2017, some of the APFs are looking to recruit Taiwanese nationals due to problems in recruiting and retaining Singaporeans and Malaysians alike. Some were deployed to work at land checkpoints alongside Singaporeans in 2018.

According to reports from Radio Taiwan International, some Taiwanese nationals refuse to continue working due to the stress in their assigned job posts.

In January 2024, Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said that other countries are being considered for recruitment into APFs such as China, India, Myanmar and the Philippines due to concerns of not recruiting enough Singaporeans.

==South Korea==
In South Korea, the Auxiliary Police have a military-like structure, in that it consists of volunteers selected among eligible males (aged 18–35) who have not yet fulfilled South Korea&#x27;s obligatory military duty; service in the Auxiliary Police is accepted as equivalent to military duty. The length of service for Auxiliary Policemen is 21 months, which is identical to that of ROK Army enlistments. Within the Auxiliary Police ranks exists four sub-ranks similar to the four enlisted ranks in the ROK Army: Private Constable (이경; &quot;Igyeong&quot;), Private Constable First Class (일경; &quot;Ilgyeong&quot;), Corporal Constable (상경; &quot;Sanggyeong&quot;), and Sergeant Constable (수경; &quot;Sugyeong&quot;).

When enlisted, volunteers first go through four-week basic military training at the Korea Army Training Center under administration of Ministry of National Defense. The recruits are then handed over to the Ministry of Public Administration and Security for later administration, and are given a three-week police training before being deployed to various police units (that are each no bigger than the size of a company) throughout the country. Depending on their assignment, the Auxiliary Policemen may assist the National Police Agency with a wide array of police works, such as riot policing, traffic control, crowd control, surveillance and patrol. Upon completion of their service, Auxiliary Policemen are discharged with a Sergeant rank in the ROK Army Reserve (except in cases of demotion). The unit is now currently disbanded and appears to be completely deactivated.

==Sri Lanka==
The Sri Lanka Reserve Police was the part-time volunteer section of the Sri Lanka Police, the statutory police force in the island until it was disbanded in 2006 with its personal transferred to the Sri Lanka Police. Since 2008, Community Police, also known as &quot;Civil Committees&quot;, have been established across the country (mostly in urban areas) to increase public safety following attacks orchestrated by the Tamil Tigers.

==Sweden==
The Swedish Auxiliary Police (&quot;Beredskapspolisen&quot;) was created in 1986 with the purpose to aid the Swedish Police Authority, primarily as a pool of trained manpower in special situations such as larger disturbances of the peace, major black-outs and power failures, and natural disasters. The Auxiliary Police were disbanded on 1 October 2012 after staffing increases in the Police Authority rendered it unnecessary. At the time of its disbandment it had 1,500 officers.

The Auxiliary Police were organised with at least one section per län. Each section consisted of two or more troops and each troop consisted of three eight-man squads. All leadership positions were filled by experienced police officers from the regular police force who had undergone leadership training. The auxiliary police officers were recruited exclusively among people who had completed their military service but since 1 January 2008 military service was no longer a requirement.

The uniforms were similar to the regular police with the exception of the name &quot;Beredskapspolis&quot; instead of &quot;Polis&quot;. The Auxiliary Police were initially armed with the Carl Gustaf m/45, before being superseded by the CGA5P. Eventually, the Auxiliary Police was disarmed entirely, with the Police Authority&#x27;s SIG Sauer 9×19mm Parabellum pistols available only when necessary.

The Swedish Government announced in 2023 that they plan to reintroduce the &quot;Beredskapspolis&quot;. It would be used in the event of serious emergencies caused by gang crime and terrorism.

==United Kingdom==
The Special Constabulary is the part-time volunteer section of a statutory police force in the United Kingdom or some Crown dependencies. Its officers are known as special constables or informally as specials. Specials hold exactly the same powers as their &quot;regular&quot; (full time Police Constable) counterparts, they have opportunities to be promoted to supervisory ranks (such as sergeant and inspector), however they are limited to the office of constable and as such do not receive additional police powers if promoted to the rank of inspector. Special promotions are merely administrative and do not reflect the equivalent regular rank.

Special Constables are permitted to carry all equipment utilised by their full-time counterparts – including a baton, PAVA or CS spray and handcuffs. Although Special Constables aren&#x27;t permitted to train in the use of firearms roles, they have recently been allowed to undertake Taser training and carry Taser operationally. They are, sometimes, allowed to join other specialist units such as Roads Policing Units.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland, the only routinely armed force in the UK, does not have a Special Constabulary. It does, however, have a Reserve programme. Reserve Constables are paid for their part-time work and are permitted to carry their personal protection weapon (PPW) on and off-duty, like their regular counterparts.

==United States==
In the United States, many police departments and sheriff&#x27;s departments operate their own auxiliary police. Their powers, scope, armament, and transportation vary between each agency.

The Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that, as of 2013, there were more than 29,000 unpaid reserve (auxiliary) officers in the United States, and about 32% of local police departments had a reserve officer program. Larger cities are generally more likely to have a reserve program than smaller cities; 62% of police departments that patrol areas with a population of over 1 million have a police reserve program, while only 26% of the smallest departments (serving areas with a population lower than 2,500) do.
Colorado is the only U.S. state that uses a governmental statewide shared reserve composed of fully authorized peace officers, the Colorado Rangers. New Mexico operates the New Mexico Mounted Patrol, an all-volunteer state police agency which can be called upon to assist law enforcement anywhere in the state.

The New York City Police Department Auxiliary Police consists of about 4,500 unarmed volunteer auxiliary officers who conduct foot patrols, traffic control duty, and other activities. In a 1991 decision, the New York Court of Appeals held that the &quot;fellow-officer rule&quot; (a rule allowing a police officer &quot;to rely on a communication from another police officer and to act upon it in making an arrest&quot;) applied to auxiliary officers.

In 2015, a volunteer reserve deputy in Oklahoma fatally shot Eric Harris, an unarmed black man; the reserve deputy was convicted of manslaughter.

== France ==

France has a reserve of the National Police (active in the cities) and the National Gendarmerie (mainly rural police member of the army). Its members are paid per day of service based on their availability. The Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defense can also mobilize them in case of a serious threat to national security. Access to the reserve is obtained after less than one month of training in a police academy (police) or military barracks (gendarmerie). There is also continuing education. Ranks are obtained with seniority of service and a competitive examination for officers. There are 1,500 police reservists as of 2022 and 29,000 gendarmerie reservists as of 2018. They are composed of men and women with age limits for registration as well as medical aptitude. Reservists are required to have French nationality. Reservists have the same uniforms and skills as professional police officers or gendarmes and almost the same equipment, except for certain specific prerogatives (maintenance of order, judicial protection agent, judicial police officer), they are officially assistant judicial police officers. They cannot record all offences.

<doc id="1321785" wikidata="Q7269519" url="?curid=1321785" title="Quasi-projective variety">
<text>In mathematics, a quasi-projective variety in algebraic geometry is a locally closed subset of a projective variety, i.e., the intersection inside some projective space of a Zariski-open and a Zariski-closed subset. A similar definition is used in scheme theory, where a &quot;quasi-projective scheme&quot; is a locally closed subscheme of some projective space.

==Relationship to affine varieties==

An affine space is a Zariski-open subset of a projective space, and since any closed affine subset formula_1 can be expressed as an intersection of the projective completion formula_2 and the affine space embedded in the projective space, this implies that any affine variety is quasiprojective. There are locally closed subsets of projective space that are not affine, so that quasi-projective is more general than affine. Taking the complement of a single point in projective space of dimension at least 2 gives a non-affine quasi-projective variety. This is also an example of a quasi-projective variety that is neither affine nor projective.

==Examples==

Since quasi-projective varieties generalize both affine and projective varieties, they are sometimes referred to simply as &quot;varieties&quot;. Varieties isomorphic to affine algebraic varieties as quasi-projective varieties are called affine varieties; similarly for projective varieties. For example, the complement of a point in the affine line, i.e., formula_3, is isomorphic to the zero set of the polynomial formula_4 in the affine plane. As an affine set formula_5 is not closed since any polynomial zero on the complement must be zero on the affine line. For another example, the complement of any conic in projective space of dimension 2 is affine. Varieties isomorphic to open subsets of affine varieties are called quasi-affine.

Quasi-projective varieties are &quot;locally affine&quot; in the same sense that a manifold is locally Euclidean: every point of a quasi-projective variety has a neighborhood which is an affine variety. This yields a basis of affine sets for the Zariski topology on a quasi-projective variety.

<text>Emperor Taizu of Jin (August 1, 1068 – September 19, 1123), personal name Aguda, sinicised name Min (), was the founder and first emperor of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty of China. He was originally the chieftain of the Wanyan tribe, the most dominant among the Jurchen tribes which were subjects of the Khitan-led Liao dynasty. Starting in 1114, Aguda united the Jurchen tribes under his rule and rebelled against the Liao dynasty. A year later, he declared himself emperor and established the Jin dynasty. By the time of his death, the Jin dynasty had conquered most of the Liao dynasty&#x27;s territories and emerged as a major power in northern China. In 1145, he was posthumously honoured with the temple name Taizu by his descendant Emperor Xizong.

The name [Wanyan] Aguda is transcribed [Wan-yen] A-ku-ta in Wade-Giles; the alternative spelling Akutta (possibly from reconstruction of Jurchen language) appears in a very small number of books as well.

==Life==
Aguda was an eighth-generation descendant of Hanpu, the great progenitor of the entire Wanyan clan. His father was Helibo, the chieftain of the Wanyan clan. His mother was a daughter of the chieftain of the Nalan () tribe. He was born in 1068 near the Ashi River within present-day Harbin, Heilongjiang Province. He was well-known within his tribe for his bravery, and had participated in numerous campaigns against rival Jurchen tribes at the command of the Khitan-led Liao dynasty. In 1109, during the height of a widespread famine, Aguda assisted his father in absorbing famished warriors from other Jurchen tribes to strengthen his own tribe. Later, he fought wars against other Jurchen tribes and succeeded in unifying all Jurchens under the Wanyan tribe&#x27;s leadership.

In 1113, Aguda succeeded his elder brother, Wuyashu, as the leader of his tribe. Like other Jurchens, Aguda loathed what he considered the exploitation of his tribesmen by corrupt Liao officials. In 1112, when the Liao ruler, Emperor Tianzuo, went on a fishing expedition in Jurchen territory, he ordered all the chieftains to dance for him. Aguda became famous among the Jurchens when he was the only person who defied the order.

In early 1114, Aguda sent spies into Liao territory and prepared to revolt against the Khitan regime, which he considered decadent. His chief advisors were Wanyan Zonghan and Wanyan Xiyin. In September, Aguda rallied his tribesmen (around 2,500 men) at Liushui (流水; near present-day Lalin River in Fuyu, Jilin Province) and openly rebelled against the Liao dynasty. His cavalry captured Ningjiangzhou (寧江州; present-day Fuyu, Jilin Province) and defeated a 7,000-strong Liao army at the Battle of Chuhedian in November. In January 1115, following a series of military successes, Aguda proclaimed himself emperor, established the Jin dynasty, and adopted the regnal name &quot;Shouguo&quot; (). In August, his army conquered Huanglong Prefecture (黄龍府; present-day Nong&#x27;an County, Jilin Province) and defeated 700,000 Liao troops with only 20,000 horsemen at the Battle of Hubudagang. By 1116, Aguda had completed the conquest of the entire Liaodong Peninsula. Between 1119 and 1122, his army repeatedly defeated Liao forces and captured all of the Liao dynasty&#x27;s five capitals.

Since the Jin dynasty was an enemy of the Liao dynasty, the Han Chinese-led Northern Song dynasty considered the Jin dynasty to be their natural allies. In 1117, the Song dynasty sent emissaries to the Jin dynasty, ostensibly to buy horses, but in reality to negotiate an alliance against the Liao dynasty. Between 1117 and 1123, seven Song delegations visited the Jurchens, and six Jin embassies went to the Song capital, Bianjing (present-day Kaifeng, Henan Province). Between 1115 and 1123, the Jin and Song dynasties negotiated and formed the Alliance Conducted at Sea against the Liao dynasty. Under the conditions of the alliance, the Song dynasty would attack the Liao dynasty from the south, while in return, the Jin dynasty would hand over control of the Liao dynasty&#x27;s Sixteen Prefectures to the Song dynasty.

During the war against the Liao dynasty, Aguda also took time to establish the new feudal governmental system based on Jurchen tribal customs. He also organised the national agriculture with a collectivist system known as the &quot;Miŋgan Moumukə&quot; (). Furthermore, Aguda absorbed elements of Han Chinese culture and ordered his chancellor Wanyan Xiyin to develop a unique Jurchen writing system.

Aguda died in August 1123, at the age of 56. His death came a few months after the Jin and Song dynasties signed a treaty which recognised each other as equals and required the Song to pay the Jin an annual tribute of 200,000 taels of silver and 300,000 bolts of silk. Aguda was succeeded by his younger brother, Wuqimai (Emperor Taizong). Wuqimai continued the campaign against the Liao dynasty and captured the Liao emperor, Emperor Tianzuo in 1125, thereby ending the Liao dynasty&#x27;s existence. Soon after conquering the Liao dynasty, the Jin dynasty waged war against the Northern Song dynasty. Aguda was buried in the Rui Mausoleum () at Dafangshan () outside Zhongdu (中都; present-day Beijing).

==Commemoration==
Mounted statues of Aguda and his chief commander, Wanyan Zonghan, have been erected on the grounds of the Jin Dynasty History Museum () at the former location of the old Jin capital, Shangjing (), which is near present-day Acheng District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province.

<text>Amos Elon (, July 4, 1926 – May 25, 2009) was an Israeli journalist and author.

==Biography==
Heinrich Sternbach (later Amos Elon) was born in Vienna. He immigrated to Mandate Palestine as a child in 1933. He studied law and history in Israel and England. He married Beth Drexler, a New York-born literary agent, with whom he had one daughter, Danae. In the 1990s, Elon began to spend much of his time in Italy. In 2004 he moved there permanently, citing disillusionment with developments in Israel since 1967. Elon died of leukemia on May 25, 2009 in Borgo Buggiano in Tuscany, Italy, aged 82. In 2005, his daughter Danae produced a biographical film about him, entitled &quot;Another Road Home&quot;.

==Journalistic career==
Beginning in the 1950s, Elon served as a correspondent on European and American affairs for the newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot;. He took a leave of absence from Haaretz in 1971 and resumed in 1978. Elon retired from Haaretz in 2001. Elon was an early advocate for the creation of a Palestinian state and withdrawal from the territories occupied by Israel in 1967. Elon also spoke out against Armenian genocide denial and Yad Vashem&#x27;s boycott of the 1982 International Conference on Holocaust and Genocide over its inclusion of the Armenian genocide.

Elon was the author of nine books. He rose to international fame in the early 1970s after publishing &quot;The Israelis: Founders and Sons&quot;, described as &quot;an affectionate but unsparing portrait of the early Zionists&quot;. A frequent contributor to the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, he was widely regarded as one of Israel&#x27;s leading journalists for many years.

==Zionism==
In 1975 he wrote an admiring if critical biography of Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, but later grew disillusioned. In 2004 he sold his home in Jerusalem and moved to Tuscany. In an interview that year with Ari Shavit he stated that Zionism had &quot;exhausted itself&quot; and that he had come to consider it &quot;perhaps the least successful attempt at colonialism that I can think of. This is the crappiest colonial regime that I can think of in the modern age.&quot;

==Academic career==
In 2007–2008, Elon was a fellow at the Center for Law and Security at New York University School of Law.

<doc id="1321810" wikidata="Q2584005" url="?curid=1321810" title="Jackal (Marvel Comics character)">
<text>The Jackal is an alias used by several supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually depicted as enemies of the superhero Spider-Man. The original and best known incarnation, Miles Warren, was originally introduced in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #31 (December 1965) as a professor at the fictional Empire State University. Later storylines established him as also being a scientist researching genetics and biochemistry, and revealed an unhealthy romantic obsession he had for Gwen Stacy. Warren was driven mad with grief and jealousy so he created his Jackal alter-ego to seek revenge on Spider-Man, whom he blamed for Gwen&#x27;s tragic death. To this end, he trained himself in martial arts, and created a green suit and gauntlets with claw-like razors. Although the Jackal initially didn&#x27;t possess any superpowers, he later gained enhanced strength, speed and agility by mixing his genes with those of a jackal.

The Jackal was introduced in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #129 (February 1974), but his human identity was not revealed until &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #148 (September 1975). Originally one of Spider-Man&#x27;s less popular rogues, the character rose to prominence after being one of the first in the Marvel Universe to master cloning technology, and creating various clones of Spider-Man, like the Scarlet Spiders Ben Reilly and Kaine Parker, as well as of other characters, including himself and the chimera Spider-Girl. His experiments went on to play a major role in several popular Spider-Man storylines, such as the &quot;Clone Saga&quot; (1994–1996), &quot;Spider-Island&quot; (2011), and &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot; (2016–2017), the latter storyline of which established [[Ben Reilly]] as the second Jackal; in &quot;Spider-Gwen&quot;, during the titular character&#x27;s foray into Earth-616, the Jackal attempts to capture her to explicitly sexually assault her, after previously only subtextually expressing this desire towards her main continuity counterpart and her clones.

In 2014, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the Jackal as Spider-Man&#x27;s 17th greatest enemy. The character has been featured in several media adaptations of Spider-Man, including animated series and video games.

==Publication history==
The character first appears in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #129 (February 1974), and was created by writer Gerry Conway and artist Ross Andru. In &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #148 (September 1975), the Jackal&#x27;s identity was revealed to be Professor Miles Warren who first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #31 (December 1965), and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko. Prior to his Jackal reintroduction, his appearances were essentially limited to the occasional cameo in which he acts as simple background to Spider-Man&#x27;s civilian life as a college student.

When named at all in these early appearances, he is called only &quot;Professor Warren&quot;. A &quot;Mister Warren&quot; had previously appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #8 (January 1964) but he is a high school science teacher rather than a college professor, and is physically very distinct from Miles Warren. Despite this, Conway has said it was always his interpretation that &quot;Mister Warren&quot;, &quot;Professor Warren&quot;, and Professor Miles Warren/Jackal were the same character.

The character was featured in the controversial 1990s &quot;Clone Saga&quot; story arc, the 2011 storyline &quot;Spider-Island&quot;, and the 2016-2017 storyline &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Miles Warren===
Miles Warren is a professor of biology at ESU/Empire State University, where he meets Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy. During his tenure there, Warren becomes secretly infatuated with the much younger Gwen to the point of obsession and jealousy of Parker. After Gwen is murdered by the Green Goblin, Warren swears vengeance on Spider-Man, since it was reported that it was Spider-Man who killed Gwen. Gwen&#x27;s death drives Warren into depression, despair, and insanity as a mad geneticist who eventually turns into the Jackal. Miles is also the brother of science teacher Raymond Warren of Midtown High School.

====Early career====
Miles is an assistant of the High Evolutionary at Wundagore Mountain after earning his Ph.D. in biochemistry. Warren assists the High Evolutionary in experiments that involve turning animals into humans and vice versa. There is conflict between Warren and the High Evolutionary because Warren succeeds in creating &quot;New Men&quot; who looked practically human, whereas the High Evolutionary is not able to. Eventually, Warren evolves a jackal that exhibits a Jekyll and Hyde personality. When the test subject escapes, the High Evolutionary banishes Warren from Wundagore. Warren continues his research and eventually settles down with Monica, a woman who bears him two children who are all killed in what is originally believed to be a car crash; however, it is later revealed to be an assault by his highly evolved Man-Jackal envious of his creator.

====The Jackal&#x27;s origin====
The day after Gwen&#x27;s death, Warren&#x27;s lab assistant Anthony Serba reveals that he successfully cloned a frog using their research technology. Warren gives Serba tissue samples of Gwen and Peter, telling Serba that they come from rat cells. Serba later confronts Warren, stating that the clones are human and must be destroyed immediately. Panicking, Warren attempts to cover Serba&#x27;s mouth to shut him up, accidentally suffocating Serba. Unable to accept responsibility for his actions, Warren develops a second personality to carry the weight of his misdeeds dubbed &quot;The Jackal&quot;. He further develops his alter ego by fashioning a green suit and gauntlets with sharp, claw-like razors on each finger, and by training himself athletically. During this time, he also continues to experiment with cloning humans. Kaine is the first successful clone of Peter despite suffering from a slow cloning degeneration and having regenerative abilities to repeatedly elude death.

The Jackal&#x27;s hatred for Spider-Man manifests in his belief that Spider-Man is solely responsible for allowing Gwen, whom he loved, to die at the Goblin&#x27;s hands. He starts harassing Spider-Man, setting him up against other adversaries. Warren allies himself with the Punisher against Spider-Man. The Jackal next attempts to incite a gang war between Hammerhead and Doctor Octopus. Later, he equips wrestler Maxwell Markham with the Grizzly costume and a powerful exoskeleton to assassinate newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson. The Jackal then holds Parker hostage in a scheme to trap Spider-Man. He eventually learns Spider-Man&#x27;s identity.

Out of his numerous attempts to create clones of Peter, only one is a perfect copy of the original. He also creates two clones of himself, one a direct copy and the other a modified clone harboring the Carrion virus. The Jackal helps the Tarantula (Anton Miguel Rodriguez) escape prison, and the two become partners. The Jackal captures Spider-Man, but lets him go after proving that Spider-Man is no match for the Jackal in a fair fight. He then lures his nemesis to Shea Stadium and manipulates into battling his perfect clone of Peter by binding &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; reporter Ned Leeds to a bomb that only the original Spider-Man can disarm. But when a clone of Gwen tears off the Jackal&#x27;s mask and confronts him on his crimes, Warren accepts responsibility for his actions. He attempts to correct his wrongdoings by freeing Leeds, only to be caught in the bomb&#x27;s explosion.

====Clone Saga====

During the &quot;Clone Saga&quot;, it is revealed that Peter&#x27;s clone had survived the explosion and gone into hiding under the alias of Ben Reilly. The Jackal who died at Shea Stadium was also a clone. Nearly five years later, another clone of Jackal would marry Gwen&#x27;s original clone, and the two would live under the assumed names Warren Miles and Gwen Miles. This clone of Warren eventually dies of the degeneration that afflicts most of the Jackal&#x27;s clones. The real Jackal resurfaces, where his experiments mutate his own DNA and give him an actual jackal&#x27;s attributes.

When Reilly returns years later to New York City as the Scarlet Spider and allies with Spider-Man, the Jackal also returns to unleash his clone army and convinced both Parker and Reilly that the latter was the original Spider-Man, and the former was the clone. The Jackal creates clones of Peter who come into conflict with Spider-Man, the Scarlet Spider, and Kaine. Ultimately, the Jackal, in the process of attempting to kill and replace millions of people with clones that he can control, falls off a tall building while trying to save Gwen&#x27;s clone and dies.

Because of Norman Osborn, the Jackal and various others (including Kaine) had been tricked into thinking that Reilly was the original and that Peter was the clone. All of the Jackal&#x27;s machinations were influenced by his incorrect assertion that he knew who the real Peter was.

====Spider-Island====
The Jackal returns in the &quot;Spider-Island&quot; storyline, being further genetically altered to the point where he frequently displays animalistic tendencies. His body is always cold, requiring him to wear a thick fur coat even in the hottest weather. He is now a crime lord calling himself &quot;The Professor&quot;, and allies himself with Hammerhead, but the two eventually go to jail. He returns in the &quot;Infestation&quot; back-up feature of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, unleashing genetically engineered bedbugs to pass on Spider-like abilities to thousands of citizens in Manhattan. He achieves this through the aid of human clones of himself, and funding from Adriana Soria. Although the bedbugs later die, the virus gives New York&#x27;s citizens spider-powers and becomes airborne to infect the world and create a new race of Homo-Arachnus as part of his co-conspirator&#x27;s plan to overtake the Great Web of Life. The Jackal has also enlisted the aid of his mutated henchman Tarantula. It is revealed that the clone of Gwen introduced in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #144 was actually Abby-L (Gwen&#x27;s second clone and the first cloning attempt), a flawed clone with degenerative debilities. Before this seemingly perfect copy of Gwen died at Abby-L&#x27;s hands, it is revealed that the copy actually had some degeneration on her hand, suggesting not being perfect after all. Abby-L was also infected with the Carrion virus and had Carrion&#x27;s same abilities. Abby-L was manipulated into killing Gwen&#x27;s other clone, who was living in London under the alias of Joyce Delaney, and coming into conflict with the Jackal and Kaine. With his own ulterior motives, the Jackal manipulated gang leaders into adorning duplicate costumes of Spider-Man to cause chaos in New York City. He experimented on the Spider King&#x27;s host form to spread New York City&#x27;s infestation on a global scale. The Jackal still knows Spider-Man&#x27;s true identity despite the worldwide mindwipe to the rest of the world. After a cure is created by Mister Fantastic with Max Modell&#x27;s Horizon Labs using Anti-Venom&#x27;s antibodies, the Jackal assures Soria that no cure is possible. Soria kills him after realizing that his co-conspirator&#x27;s powers were amplified into the god-like Spider-Queen due to a frequency that returned Spider-Man&#x27;s spider-sense. However, the Jackal who dies ends up being a clone while the real Jackal had kept his distance the entire time with his former self&#x27;s surviving clones, anticipating the outcome and gaining a sample of his slain female co-conspirator&#x27;s DNA, recognizing his success in obtaining DNA unbeknownst to the Avengers and Spider-Man.

It is later revealed that the Jackal has been monitoring Peter&#x27;s accidental creation of Alpha, and has set his sights on Spider-Man&#x27;s new protégé. The Jackal resurfaces accompanied by his cloned mutated human-spider hybrids of Spider-Queen and is bent on harvesting Alpha&#x27;s powers for himself to clone a race of Alpha males. But his plans fail as the Alpha energy cannot be cloned, resulting in powerless, near-mindless copies of Alpha, all of which are destroyed when the enraged Alpha breaks free. It is then revealed that the two versions of Jackal that Spider-Man and Alpha fought were also clones.

====Superior Spider-Man era====
When Otto Octavius&#x27;s mind possesses Spider-Man&#x27;s body, the X-Men battle a 30 ft. human-spider hybrid attacking New York which turns out to be a human mutant created by the Jackal using Mister Sinister&#x27;s works, a &quot;daughter&quot; of Scott Summers, Gwen, and Soria named as &quot;Gwen Warren / Spider-Girl&quot;. The Jackal later attacks the Superior Spider-Man and the new Scarlet Spider with mutant-powered spider-clones. Superior Spider-Man kills the clones by destroying the Jackal&#x27;s hideout, but the Jackal escapes. It is revealed that he kept samples of Scarlet Spider&#x27;s DNA. The Jackal tells Carrion that he is prepared to develop Spidercide 2.0.

====Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy====
Ben&#x27;s dissolved remains are collected by the Jackal who was resurrected thanks to a new cloning process. However, the Jackal found problems with the cellular degradation. He had Ben killed 26 more times, all of which had Ben&#x27;s life (and most of Peter&#x27;s) flash before his eyes. The ordeal of repeated death caused Ben to become mentally unbalanced and morally ambiguous, due to the trauma and very soul being damaged from being removed and replaced over and over. Ben eventually breaks free and knocks out the Jackal. After improving Warren&#x27;s formula, Ben makes clones of Miles and persuades the Jackal that &quot;he&quot; is a clone, thereby making it nearly impossible to tell who is the real one. Now free with a number of clone of Miles as servants, Ben acts as the new Jackal during the &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot; storyline and is determined to repay the people who have heavily influenced Ben&#x27;s and Peter&#x27;s lives with the Jackal&#x27;s technology to make sure that no one has to suffer again and that those who have can become whole, and even does this by establishing New U Technologies.

When Spider-Man activates the Webware to stabilize the human and clone cells all across the world that were in danger of succumbing to clone degradation, the various clone of Miles melt as Ben fights Doctor Octopus. The so-called clone that does not melt realizes that he &quot;is&quot; the true Warren and vows to have revenge on Ben as the true Jackal. Ben returns to a safe-house and finds Miles in his Jackal outfit waiting in the living room. The Jackal proceeds to burn Ben&#x27;s safe-house down and engages in one final battle. Ben defeats the Jackal and leaves him in the burning house to die.

The Jackal however, survived the fire and targeted the neural net that was built by Dr. Yesenia Rosario when the woman was doing a presentation of it at Empire State University. The Jackal was defeated by Spider-Man and Ms. Marvel as Dr. Rosario destroys her own invention by setting it to self-destruct.

He later surfaced in the Empire State University once more, under the guise of &quot;Professor Guarinus&quot; and is shocked to bump into Ghost-Spider who had recently enrolled in this universe&#x27;s ESU. He injected himself with actual jackal DNA allowing himself to transform into looking exactly like his iconic green costume, but for real. The Jackal recruited another new student named Benji to befriend the alternate Gwen Stacy in exchange for the possibility of great power if she does her job well and while Benji is able to tell Miles that Gwen is a costumed hero from another world, she somehow had failed Warren and was punished for it.

===Spectacular Spider-Men===
The Jackal impersonated Raymond Warren by utilizing his cloning technology to take on his brother&#x27;s likeness to continue his research without arousing suspicion. While acting as an acquaintance of Raymond&#x27;s colleagues and friends, his secret lab in ESU contained clones of the Jackal which were defeated by the original Spider-Man and the other Spider-Man, and investigated by Carlie Cooper. While posing as Raymond, he manipulated the A.I. Arcadium created by Arcade, Mentallo and Hammerhead. The Jackal has an alliance with the A.I. as the organic form K.N.A.I.V.E. However, the Spider-Men defeat K.N.A.I.V.E. and the Jackal&#x27;s identity theft is revealed to which he&#x27;s punched by his brother&#x27;s former student and is arrested by the police.

===Ben Reilly===

Benjamin &quot;Ben&quot; Reilly is the second major character to use the Jackal alias.

==Powers and abilities==
Prior to his regeneration, Miles Warren is a genius in the fields of biochemistry, genetics, and cloning. The Jackal was a talented martial artist and gymnast. He later spliced his genes with the DNA of a jackal, having the strength, durability, speed, and agility amplified to inhuman levels. Warren has access to state-of-the-art laboratories, as well as advanced gadgets or devices if needed.

==Copies of Jackal==
Prior to the death of the Warren clone at Shea Stadium, he had created a clone of himself. The clone remained in stasis within a cloning casket that malfunctioned and super-aged the clone beyond death. Eventually, it emerged and became known as Carrion that wielded power and had no conscience for its actions. He was the first carrier of the Carrion virus, which Warren designed to destroy humanity. Carrion contained all Warren&#x27;s memories which contained within his RNA, that included his hatred and knowledge of Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity. Carrion wielded the power to create a Red Dust that would spread as pestilence as well as his touch that would incapacitate or even cause organic matter to degenerate to the point of disintegration. The original Carrion intended to kill Spider-Man with a spider-amoeba, but failed as Carrion was absorbed by the amoeba, engulfed in flames that ensued from his battle.

Much later, fellow ESU rival Malcolm McBride stumbled across Warren&#x27;s old lair, where he was infected with a strain of the Carrion virus and became the second incarnation of Carrion. The virus allowed McBride to become endowed with the knowledge of Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity; however, he was unsure whether he was Dr. Warren&#x27;s first clone or Malcolm McBride. Eventually, McBride teamed with the likes of Demogoblin and Carnage, but was later cured of his condition and incarcerated in Ravencroft Asylum.

A man dressed as the Jackal once attacked Alpha Flight and claimed to be Miles Warren&#x27;s son. It was later indicated that this Jackal was the Ani-Man Warren created that ultimately murdered the Professor&#x27;s family.

A version of the Jackal dubbed as &quot;The Professor&quot; fought Daredevil and Punisher.

He used multiple stand-ins, such as the clones of his human form and the Jackal in &quot;Spider-Island&quot;. There was also an additional clone accompanying the Jackal in &quot;Sibling Rivalry&quot; after targeting the Superior Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider.

Ben Reilly later made clones of Miles Warren to help run New U Technologies.

==Other clones==
The following clones were created by the Jackal:

* The clone of Miles Warren who died at Shea Stadium in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #149.
* The clone of Miles Warren who married the clone of Gwen Stacy and died of clone degeneration in &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot; #125.
* The clone of Miles Warren in the &quot;Daredevil/Punisher&quot; limited series.
* The original clone of Miles Warren who is Carrion.
* The clone of Gwen Stacy introduced in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #144. She went by the aliases Joyce Delaney and Gwen Miles.
* Abby-L – The original clone of Gwen who is also infected with the Carrion virus; introduced in &quot;Spider Island: Deadly Foes&quot;.
* The clone of Gwen introduced in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #399 who dies of clone degeneration.
* Ben Reilly a.k.a. the Scarlet Spider/Spider-Man – A clone of Peter Parker.
* Kaine Parker a.k.a. the Tarantula/Scarlet Spider – The first clone of Peter Parker who suffers from clone degeneration.
* Spidercide – A clone of Peter who has control over his own molecules, used by the Jackal, like Jack and Guardian, as muscle. Died fighting Ben Reilly and Peter above the Daily Bugle before falling to its death.
* Jack – A clone of Peter who was the Jackal&#x27;s diminutive henchman, armed with claw-like fingernails (much like Guardian) who dies from clone degeneration.
* Guardian – A clone of Peter with dense skin, super-strength, and claw-like fingernails who guarded the entrance to one of the Jackal&#x27;s headquarters who also died of clone degeneration.
* The clone of Spider-Man whose skeleton was found in the smokestack that Ben Reilly was dumped down at the original Clone Story&#x27;s end.
* The army of clones of Spider-Man in &quot;Maximum Clonage&quot;.
* The various clones of his human form featured in &quot;Spider-Island&quot;. Most, in human form, acted as henchmen for the Jackal and Adriana Soria. Two later kidnapped Alpha and his family which Spider-Man fought.
* The Spider clones that were harvested from Adriana Soria&#x27;s DNA sent to fight Spider-Man.
* The Alpha clones created to harvest/clone the Parker Particles.
* Using the works of Mister Sinister, the Jackal created a clone that was a girl who can turn into a mutant spider. This girl can shoot mucus from her mouth and shoot optic blasts when in spider form. When the girl was defeated by Superior Spider-Man and Storm, she was taken into the X-Men&#x27;s custody where Beast claims that three DNA sources were used to create her. In January 2023, she later adopted the name of Gwen Warren and the alias of Spider-Girl. Cerebra later confirmed that Jackal used the DNA samples of Cyclops, Gwen Stacy, and Spider-Queen to create her.
* The Jackal then used the DNA samples of the X-Men that he obtained from one of Mister Sinister&#x27;s laboratories to create mutant-powered spider-clones. One clone has optic blasts like Cyclops, one clone can use electrical attacks like Storm, one clone can teleport like Nightcrawler, and the final clone can do cryokinesis like Iceman. These mutant-powered spider-clones were killed when Superior Spider-Man blew up the Jackal&#x27;s hideout.

==Reception==
J. M. DeMatteis, the creator of the &quot;Clone Saga&quot;, claimed in an interview that he thought Jackal is &quot;a terrific villain...one of his favorites&quot;, and that it &quot;was a blast bringing the character back, if only for this one story.&quot; Dan Slott claimed in an interview with &quot;Newsarama&quot; about the &quot;Spider-Island&quot; saga that the Jackal is &quot;one of the wonderful mad scientists of Spider-Man&#x27;s world.&quot;

==Other versions==
===&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;===
In the &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; universe, when the Zombie Galacti left the Earth (after eating Galactus), Wilson Fisk (Kingpin) makes an empire. The zombiefied Jackal plays an important part in it, creating human clones to feed the remaining Marvel Zombies. This process utilizes Inhuman technology.

===Spider-Man: Clone Saga===
Jackal appears in the re-imagining of the Clone Saga by Tom DeFalco, who was exploring the storyline as it was originally conceived. He infects both May Parker and Mary Jane Watson with a genetic virus. When Kaine betrays Jackal and leads Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider to his lair, all three are captured. The Jackal then reveals his plan to create an army of Spider-Clones to take over the world and clone Gwen Stacy. The clones prove unstable, however, and the Jackal comes to the conclusion that Ben is the original. Before he can do anything, Kaine breaks free and burns his mark onto the Jackal&#x27;s face before breaking his neck.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel version of Miles Warren is a hypnotherapist for Harry Osborn to help repress memories about the Green Goblin. Later in the Deadpool story arc of &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, he was revealed to be dating May Parker. Additionally, his Clone Saga involvement has been taken over by Doctor Octopus. He last appeared when May tried to introduce him to Peter, but they had to leave town because of Norman Osborn and he had a patient to handle.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot;===
&quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot; features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962. After the 60s, Miles eventually leaves Empire State and forms his own bio-engineering company. Peter Parker&#x27;s wife, Gwen Stacy, became his chief biologist. During this time, he was also hired by Norman Osborn to create clones of Norman and Peter, but he also secretly created a clone of Gwen. In 1977, Norman gets word of Warren&#x27;s additional clone and sends Harry Osborn as the Black Goblin to attack Warren&#x27;s company, revealing the clones to Harry, Peter, and Gwen in the process. Harry blows up the containment tubes containing the clones, which kills all of them except for Peter&#x27;s clone. However, Warren reveals that the &quot;Gwen&quot; that Peter was with was actually her clone, while the real Gwen died in the explosion, as he wanted to keep her for himself.

===&quot;Spider-Verse&quot;===
In the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; storyline, the Miles Warren of Earth-802 is one of the top scientists working for Jennix of the Inheritors. Jennix once quoted to Miles &quot;I keep you around because you were once the most brilliant mind on the planet.&quot; Spider-Man of Earth-94, Scarlet Spider, and Black Widow of Earth-1610 later encounter Miles Warren when they infiltrate the Baxter Building to disable Jennix&#x27; cloning device (which is used to create new bodies for the Inheritors if they get killed in action).

===&quot;Secret Wars&quot;===
During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Spider-Gwen encounters the Jackal of Arachnia and covers him with webbing as he is robbing a grave after which he exclaims he is the best geneticist of his generation.

===What If?===
In &quot;What If The Punisher Had Killed Spider-Man?&quot;, Warren successfully dupes the Punisher into killing Spider-Man and abandons him to take the fall in his place. Becoming a hunted fugitive, the Punisher eventually tracks Warren down and intends to surrender him to the police. But when the NYPD is about to arrest Punisher instead, threatening to kill him should he shoot Warren, Warren is executed (off-panel) by the Punisher after the latter gleefully concludes the story with the words: &quot;See you on the other side, Jackal.&quot;

===Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy===
When Warren reveals his plans for New U, Kaine and the Gwen Stacy of Earth-65 step in to stop him from winning Peter to his side. Kaine later told Spider-Man that they have visited various unidentified alternate universes where Peter agreeing to Jackal&#x27;s plans for New U Technologies have led to catastrophe in the form of the Carrion Virus.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Miles Warren appears in the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1994) two-part episode &quot;The Return of Hydro-Man&quot;, voiced by Jonathan Harris. This version is a scientist whose cloning experiments were banned by the government. In an attempt to stabilize his clones, he uses a sample of Hydro-Man to create clones of the latter and Mary Jane Watson before being discovered by Spider-Man and his clones evaporate.
** An alternate universe version of Warren appears in the episode &quot;I Really, Really Hate Clones&quot;, in which he captures and clones the web-slinger and tampers with both versions&#x27; memories, with one becoming the Scarlet Spider and the other later turning into Spider-Carnage.
* Miles Warren appears in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, voiced by Brian George. This version is East Indian.

<text>Poynton is a town in the civil parish of Poynton-with-Worth, in the Cheshire East district and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England; from 1974 to 2009 it was in Macclesfield district. It is located on the easternmost fringe of the Cheshire Plain, south-east of Manchester, north of Macclesfield and south of Stockport. 

The first mention of the manor of Poynton was in 1289. Coal was mined in Poynton from the 16th century and the collieries, under the ownership of the Lords Vernon from 1832 until their closure in 1935, were the largest in Cheshire. Consequent urbanisation and socioeconomic development necessitated better transport links; these came with the completion of the Macclesfield Canal through Poynton in 1831, the arrival of the Manchester and Birmingham Railway in 1845 and the Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway in 1869. In the late 20th century, Poynton became a commuter town for Manchester. Since 1945, the population has nearly trebled to 14,260 in 2011.

==History==

The settlement does not appear in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086. The first mention of the manor of Poynton occurred in the 13th century when it was held under the Earl of Chester by the Poutrells family and then by the de Stockeports, lords of Stockport. It was part of the barony of Stockport. Past spellings include &quot;Ponynton&quot; and &quot;Poynington&quot;. The Warren family held the manor from 1382, beginning with Sir John de Warren, who was a son of Sir Edward de Warren and his wife Cicely de Eton of Poynton and Stockport. This family held the manor until 1801, when Sir George Warren, the last surviving male, died. He was succeeded by his daughter, Lady Warren Bulkeley. She died childless in 1826 when she left the estate to Frances Maria Warren (then Lady Vernon) daughter of Sir John Borlase Warren, 1st Baronet. The Lords Vernon held the estate until the final sale in 1920.

Coal was found outcropping to the east of Towers Road, which corresponds to the line of the Red Rock Fault at the surface. The earliest record to be found is a lease dated 28 February 1589, which talks of the &quot;Coal pit at Wourthe lately occupied by George Finche&quot;. This could be worked on the surface then by shallow shafts, and later by deeper shafts with waterwheels or steam engines operating pumps and winding gear. In the late 18th century, the Warrens of Poynton co-operated with the Leghs of Lyme to work the Cannel and Sheepwash seams at Norbury Hollow. Initially, the mines were pumped using waterwheels driven by the Norbury Brook; atmospheric steam engines were then used and then condensing engines thus allowing deeper pits to be sunk. Output in 1789 was over 23,586 tonnes (26,000 tons), rising to a production of 221,056 tonnes (243,673 tons) in 1859, an amount believed unlikely to have been surpassed. The Poynton Collieries were substantial, and the coal rights were held by the Warren family who leased them the Wrights and the Claytons. The canal, and new roads and railway lines, were used to remove the coal. In 1826, the estate passed to George John Venables Vernon, 4th Lord Vernon, who decided in 1832 to manage the mines himself. In 1856 it was estimated that there was a reserve of 15,163,027 tons, which would supply 245,000 tons for 61 years. This was to be supplied by the Park Round Pit and the Park Oval Pit, both working the Four Foot and Five Foot Seam, and the Anson Pit and the Nelson Pit, which were working the Accommodation Seam. The pits had good transport links to their principal markets, cotton mills around Manchester. With the Lancashire Cotton Famine in 1861, and the subsequent recession, the price of coal collapsed, and the output dropped 112,840 tons, leading to worker redundancies. A new shaft, the Lawrance Pit, was sunk at Park in 1885, raising the output to 216,362 tons and paying for itself within a year. However the costs were rising and the closure of the Norbury Pits resulted in a constant ingress of water. In 1926 production was down to 80,146 tons. The 1926 General strike lasted for 17 weeks in Poynton and the men went back to work as the collieries would have closed because of the cost of pumping. The collieries closed on 30 August 1935; 250 men were made redundant. Eighty were offered jobs in the Kent coalfield and some secured employment with Avro at Woodford. The Anson Colliery is now the site of the Anson Engine Museum; all other shafts have been capped and Park Pit has been levelled.
The Macclesfield Canal was originally proposed in 1765 but construction did not start until 1826 because of opposition from outside parties. The canal was designed by Thomas Telford and completed in 1831. Sir George Warren was a promoter of the extension of the turnpike road from Manchester by way of Hazel Grove to Sandon, Staffordshire, where it joined what is now the A51 road. The Manchester and Birmingham Railway opened a line through Poynton in 1845, which now forms part of the London–Manchester main line. The Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway opened in 1869 with stations at Higher Poynton and Middlewood; it closed in 1970, and the line is now a footpath called the Middlewood Way.

In the late 18th century, the Pickford family developed their family business of waggoners on the London-to-Manchester route with The Birches Farm at Poynton as its headquarters. The business thrived and they relocated to London in 1823. Pickfords is today one of the best-known removal firms in the United Kingdom.

From the 1870s, private house-building gathered pace and gradually Poynton became a commuter town for workers in the Manchester conurbation. Since the Second World War, several housing estates have been built by both the local authorities and private developers.

The population has risen from 5,000 to almost 15,000 since 1945.

==Governance==

From 1974 until the 2009 structural changes to local government in England, Poynton was administered by three tiers of local government: the parish council of Poynton-with-Worth, Macclesfield Borough Council and Cheshire County Council. Poynton-with-Worth (a civil parish) was made up of three electoral wards and was created in 1880 by uniting the hitherto separate civil parishes of Poynton and Worth. In 2009 the Parish Council resolved to become a Town Council and elect a Mayor, creating Poynton with Worth Town Council.

Cheshire East Council took over the responsibilities of the borough council and the county council on 1 April 2009.

Poynton is represented on Cheshire East Council in two two-member electoral wards, Poynton West and Pott Shrigley and Poynton East and Adlington, by four councillors, all members of the Conservative Party. Poynton is in the Macclesfield Constituency of the United Kingdom Parliament, which was represented by Conservative MPs from 1918 to 2024 but is currently represented by Labour Party MP Tim Roca.

Poynton was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Prestbury, in 1866 Poynton became a separate civil parish, in 1880 the parish was abolished.

==Geography==

Poynton is located at SJ925835 , between the Norbury Brook and the Poynton Brook at the easternmost limit of the Cheshire Plain. The land is between and above sea level. The town is approximately SSE of Manchester, from Manchester Airport, from junction 5 of the M56 motorway and from junction 3 of the M60 motorway. The west of the parish is predominantly residential, buffered from Hazel Grove and Bramhall by the North Cheshire Green Belt. To the south of the town are two business parks but here and to the east it is rural in nature, bounding on the former deer park of Lyme Hall. The A6 trunk road passes to the north of the parish, and the Macclesfield Canal runs north–south along the contour to the east of the parish.

The town straddles the Red Rock Fault. Its downthrow to the west brings the Permo–Triassic sandstones and mudstones of the Cheshire Plain up against the Millstone Grit and shales of the Peak District. To the immediate east of the fault are the coal measures of the Carboniferous period which, unlike those in the Lancashire Coalfield, are missing the top layers. Outcrops of the Middle Coal Measures are present here. Coal from these strata, particularly the Four Foot Mine (or seam), the Five Foot Mine and the Accommodation Mine, was mined in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The lower ground, including most of Poynton, is covered by glacial till left by the retreating ice sheet at the close of the last ice age.

Woodford Aerodrome was to the west and was owned by BAE Systems and had a Met Office weather station. Woodford&#x27;s weather station recorded a temperature of on 8 January 2010, during the Winter of 2009–10 in Great Britain and Ireland. The area has now been developed for housing.

===Climate===
==Demography==
At the time of the 2011 census, the population of the parish of Poynton with Worth was 14,260. The ethnic grouping of Poynton was 98% white, 1.1% Asian, 0.5% Mixed Race, 0.1% Black/African/Caribbean and 0.2% other groups. Religious division was 70.4% Christian, 21.5% no religion, 0.3% Muslim and 0.2% other religions. 59.7% of residents aged over 16 were married.

==Culture and community==

Poynton Co-op was founded in 1862, staying independent until February 1992. There were many Friendly Societies, Burial Clubs, Workmen&#x27;s Club and the Miners&#x27; Union. The Methodist Chapel was established in 1847 followed by the Baptists and Primitive Methodists chapels; together with St George&#x27;s Church they were the social centres of the village. Lord Vernon opened the first school in 1838 which was extended as the number of children attending it grew, and this building is now used as the Poynton Youth and Community Centre.

The Poynton Show is held every August bank holiday weekend. It started in 1885, as an agricultural show, and has grown in size; 35,000 people visited the show in 1970. It offers a range of events in the main arena such as stunt riding and aerobatics, a fairground, exhibitions and competitive events.

The St George&#x27;s Singers is large choral society founded in 1956. The choir has strong links with the Royal Northern College of Music and Chetham&#x27;s School of Music. It has sung in Helsinki, Tallinn, Kraków, Budapest and Érd; more locally the choir&#x27;s annual Singing Day regularly attracts over 200 singers to learn and perform choral music. The Vernon Building Society (Poynton) Brass Band first started within the Poynton coal-mining community and was supported by the mine owners, the Vernon family. Records from 1832 stating that new uniforms had been purchased by Lady Vernon suggest that it has existed for over 160 years.

Poynton has two Anglican churches: St Martin&#x27;s, Higher Poynton, and St George&#x27;s, which occupies a prominent position in the town centre. St George&#x27;s church dates from 1859 and is in the Victorian Gothic style; the steeple was added in 1884. The two churches have active congregations and run services, youth groups and a children&#x27;s group.

Poynton is twinned with Érd in Hungary. Since 2016, it has also been twinned with Haybes in France.

==Landmarks==

Sir George Warren bought the Worth estate in 1792. Worth Hall, now redeveloped as flats, was originally the home of the Downes family of Worth; it lies within Davenport Golf Club. Several halls were built in Poynton Park, each one then demolished to make way for a new hall. The final hall, Poynton Towers, was demolished in the 1930s. The ornamental lake, known locally as Poynton Pool, was created in the 1760s by Sir George Warren, who dammed a tributary of Poynton Brook as part of his landscaping of the park. The dam itself served as the foundation for the turnpike.

Poynton Coppice is a designated local nature reserve. Other landmarks include St George&#x27;s Church, with the town&#x27;s war memorial in its churchyard, Park Colliery and Anson Pit.

==Transport==

===Waterways===

The Macclesfield Canal, a canal with only one flight of locks, was first proposed in 1765, but was not commenced until 1826. Completed in 1831, it joins the Peak Forest Canal in Marple with the Trent and Mersey Canal near Kidsgrove and forms a part of the Cheshire Ring. The route was chosen so it could pass close to the Poynton Colleries to transport coal to Macclesfield for the steam engines and c5,000 houses. It shortened the canal journey from Manchester to London by and allowed easy carriage of coal to the cotton mills at Dukinfield.

===Railway===
The Manchester and Birmingham Railway opened a line through Poynton in 1845, which now forms a spur of the West Coast Main Line between London and Manchester. Poynton railway station is served by northbound trains to Stockport and Manchester Piccadilly, and southbound to Macclesfield and Stoke-on-Trent. Services are operated by Northern Trains; they run generally hourly trains in both directions, with additional trains at peak times and fewer on Sundays.

The Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway was opened in 1869, with stations at Higher Poynton and Middlewood. This line was closed in January 1970 and was later converted into a shared-use path called the Middlewood Way, which was opened in 1985 by David Bellamy.

===Roads===
Poynton lies to the south of the A6 road. This was the favoured London to Manchester route in the Late Middle Ages, as it avoided the wetter land of the Cheshire Plain. This is shown in John Ogilby&#x27;s road atlas of 1675. It was improved by the formation of a turnpike trust in 1724. In 1760, Sir George Warren, the Leghs of Adlington and James Pickford promoted a new turnpike through Poynton with Worth from Hazel Grove to Sandon in Staffordshire on the A51 road; this provided a link to Macclesfield. It is now known as the A523 or locally as the London Road. Later, the A5149 Chester Road, provided a link to Wilmslow. The town is within 5 miles of the M60 motorway at Stockport and M56 motorway at Manchester Airport.

====Shared Space====
In December 2011, the village road network was reconstructed at the junction of Chester Road/Park Lane and London Road, creating the first &quot;double roundel&quot; for a high-traffic intersection. Similar to a roundabout, the new junction reduces the four-lane approaches to two lanes, allowing pedestrians to cross quickly and safely allowing the elimination of traffic signals. Multiple coloured and textured cobbles separate traffic from pedestrian areas; however, it functions as a shared space, allowing pedestrians to cross anywhere that feels safe. According to the town, businesses have seen increased foot traffic and congestion has been considerably lessened. The total cost was £4m.

===Buses===
Cheshire East Council is responsible for co-ordinating public transport. It runs an Integrated Transport Service based in Crewe. Poynton with Worth parish council was one of the Cheshire parishes that were part of Selnec PTE, created by the Transport Act 1968, but was not included in Greater Manchester when it was formed on 1 April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972. As a result, special ticketing arrangements are in place within the parish. 

The 391/392 bus services, operated by Belle Vue Coaches, run between Stockport and Macclesfield every two hours in each direction on Mondays to Saturdays.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. 

The town is served by these local radio stations:
*BBC Radio Manchester
*Heart North West
*Smooth North West
*Greatest Hits Radio Manchester &amp; The North West
*Canalside Radio, a community-based station broadcast from Macclesfield.

The &quot;Poynton Post&quot; and regional &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; are the town&#x27;s local newspapers.

==Education==

Education in Poynton is now run by Cheshire East Council; it was formerly run by Cheshire County Council. Given the proximity to the border, some parents choose to have their children educated in Stockport.

There are 5 primary schools and Poynton High School. After secondary school, young residents can attend Poynton High School&#x27;s sixth form or colleges nearby such as Aquinas College, Marple College or Macclesfield College.

<text>Sir Frederick Miles Warren (10 May 1929 – 9 August 2022) was a New Zealand architect. He apprenticed under Cecil Wood before studying architecture at the University of Auckland, eventually working at the London County Council where he was exposed to British New Brutalism. Upon returning to Christchurch, and forming the practice Warren and Mahoney, he was instrumental in developing the &quot;Christchurch School&quot; of architecture, an intersection between the truth-to-materials and structural expression that characterised Brutalism, and the low-key, Scandinavian and Japanese commitment to &quot;straightforwardness&quot;. He retired from Warren and Mahoney in 1994 but continued to consult as an architect and maintain his historic home and garden at Ohinetahi.

==Early life==
Warren was born in Christchurch on 10 May 1929, the son of Jean and Maurice Warren. He was educated at Christ&#x27;s College. He commenced his architectural training as an apprentice to Cecil Wood and studied architecture via correspondence at the Christchurch Atelier. Warren later moved to Auckland to complete his studies at the University of Auckland.

Warren&#x27;s first major building was the Dorset Street Flats (designed in 1956) that were derided as prison-like due to their small scale and exposed concrete. This domestic vocabulary was quickly adapted to various building types – the Dental Nurses School (1958), the architect&#x27;s own office and home (1962), Harewood Crematorium (1963), Christchurch College (now known as College House) (1964) and the Christchurch Town Hall (1972).
==Awards and recognition==
Warren &amp; Mahoney won the New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA) Gold Medal in 1959, 1964, 1969 and 1973. In 1966 they won the American Institute of Architects&#x27; Pan Pacific Citation, an award also given to among others the architects Kenzo Tange and Harry Seidler. Warren was awarded the NZIA Gold Medal as an individual in 2000. Warren and Peter Beaven are the only two Christchurch architects who have been awarded both the New Zealand Institute of Architects gold medal.&lt;ref name=&quot;new / old city plan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1974 New Year Honours, Warren was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1985 New Year Honours, and appointed to the Order of New Zealand in the 1995 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. In 2001 he received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Auckland, and in 2003 he received an Icon Award from the Arts Foundation of New Zealand. In March 2009, Warren was commemorated as one of the Twelve Local Heroes, and a bronze bust of him was unveiled outside the Christchurch Arts Centre.

For his 80th birthday, his work was the basis of an exhibition at the Christchurch Art Gallery, which was also shown at the University of Auckland&#x27;s Gus Fisher Gallery in 2010.

In 2011 Warren was profiled on &quot;Artsville&quot;, a TVNZ arts documentary series.

Critics of his work and its impact on the Victorian architectural heritage of Christchurch include Duncan Fallowell, who has written: &quot;his buildings can&#x27;t manage the simplest attributes of good design or benevolence&quot;.

In 2015, the NZIA replaced their Architecture Medal award with four named awards honouring prominent New Zealand architects, including the Sir Miles Warren Award for Commercial Architecture.

==Gardens==
In addition to his passion for architecture Warren was also well known as a keen and talented gardener. The garden at 65 Cambridge Terrace (pictured above) was admired for its simplicity. In 1977, with Pauline and John Trengrove, Warren began work on the garden at Ohinetahi. This garden includes a formal rose garden, a walled &quot;red and green&quot; garden and a woodland garden. Warren also designed a display garden for the 2009 Ellerslie Flower Show. In 2012 Warren gifted his house and garden to the people of New Zealand via the Ohinetahi Charitable Trust.

==Death==
Warren died in Christchurch on 9 August 2022 at the age of 93.

<doc id="1321819" wikidata="Q167437" url="?curid=1321819" title="The Jackal (1997 film)">
<text>The Jackal is a 1997 American action thriller film directed and produced by Michael Caton-Jones and starring Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, Diane Venora and Sidney Poitier in his final theatrically released film role. It is a loose remake of the 1973 film &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;, which was based on the 1971 novel of the same name by Frederick Forsyth. 

&quot;The Jackal&quot; was released in the United States by Universal Pictures on November 14, 1997. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics but was a commercial success, grossing $159.3 million worldwide against a $60 million budget.

==Plot==
A joint operation between the FBI and the MVD in Moscow leads to the killing of the younger brother of Azerbaijani mafia boss Terek Murad. In retaliation, Murad hires an ex-KGB asset, an international hitman operating under the codename &quot;the Jackal&quot;, to assassinate an unidentified prominent American for $70 million. Two weeks later, the MVD capture and interrogate one of Murad&#x27;s henchmen, Viktor Politovsky, and discover the assassination plot. The interrogation, coupled with recovered documents, leads the FBI and MVD to suspect that FBI Director Donald Brown is the intended target.

Using a series of disguises and stolen or forged IDs, the Jackal prepares for the assassination attempt. FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston and Russian Police Major Valentina Koslova turn to imprisoned IRA sniper Declan Mulqueen for help. They believe that his former lover, a former ETA militant and fugitive named Isabella Zancona, can identify the Jackal. Mulqueen reveals that he knows the Jackal and agrees to help in exchange for his release as well as U.S. citizenship and safe haven for Zancona. Mulqueen and Zancona want revenge on the Jackal after he wounded her in Libya and caused her to miscarry their unborn child. Zancona, now married, provides information to help identify the Jackal, including that he is a United States Army Special Forces veteran with combat experience from his stationing in El Salvador and describes him as sociopathic with no emotions. Zancona discreetly slips Mulqueen a key to a dropbox containing a clean passport and $10,000 cash to return to Ireland. However, Preston had earlier warned Mulqueen that if he ever escaped, refused to cooperate, or if an IRA squad tries to rescue him, he would be shot.

Meanwhile, when the Jackal arrives in Montreal to collect a large caliber weapon, a contact notifies him that hijackers are pursuing it. The Jackal kills one hijacker with an extremely poisonous chemical and evades the others. He then hires Ian Lamont, a mechanic and small-time hoodlum, to build a control mount for the weapon. The Jackal demands that all design specs be turned over to him, and he also requires Lamont&#x27;s complete confidentiality. When Lamont tries extorting more money, the Jackal kills him during a live-fire test of the weapon. The FBI discovers Lamont&#x27;s remains and evidence that the Jackal intends to utilize a long-range heavy machine gun for the assassination. The Jackal sails across the Great Lakes to Chicago, where he escapes the FBI and almost kills Mulqueen, leading Mulqueen to deduce there is a mole tipping off the Jackal. They discover that the director of the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC, gave the Jackal a direct access code to FBI records, allowing him to track down and kill Koslova and two FBI agents. Before dying, Koslova - passing on a taunt from the Jackal - tells Mulqueen that &#x27;[Declan] cannot protect his women&#x27;.

As the Jackal drives to Washington, D.C., Mulqueen deduces from the Jackal&#x27;s mocking statement that his target is &quot;not&quot; Director Brown, but in fact the First Lady of the United States, who is scheduled to give a public speech. The Jackal, masquerading as a gay man, dates Douglas, a man he encountered earlier in a bar; unbeknownst to Douglas, he uses his garage to store his machine gun. When a news report exposes the Jackal&#x27;s identity, he kills Douglas. On the date of the First Lady&#x27;s speech, the weapon is hidden in a minivan parked near the speaker podium, with the Jackal planning to shoot the First Lady via remote control. However, before the Jackal can take his shot, Mulqueen uses a sniper rifle to destroy the weapon&#x27;s scope and takes off in pursuit of the Jackal, while another marksman blows up the van&#x27;s fuel tank. The Jackal blindly opens fire before his vehicle is destroyed, and Preston is shot and wounded while tackling the First Lady to safety. Following a chase through the Washington Metro tunnels, Mulqueen confronts the Jackal, who is then shot from behind by Zancona; however, the Jackal&#x27;s gun discharges a shot, and Mulqueen is also wounded. While Zancona tends to Mulqueen, the severely wounded Jackal retrieves a spare handgun: seeing this, Mulqueen grabs Zancona&#x27;s pistol and shoots the assassin several times, finally killing him.

A few days later, Preston and Mulqueen witness the Jackal&#x27;s burial in an unmarked grave. Preston reveals that he is returning to Russia to pursue Terek Murad and his gang, and that Mulqueen&#x27;s request to be released was denied but he will likely be moved to a minimum security prison. Preston also remarks that his heroics in saving the First Lady have made him &quot;untouchable&quot; within the FBI: knowing his current clout will prevent any backlash against him, he turns his back on Mulqueen, allowing him to go free.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was in production development from August 19 to November 30, 1996. It was filmed in international locations such as Porvoo, Finland, including its special effects. The film began production titled &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;, but the author of the original novel Frederick Forsyth and the director and producer of the original film Fred Zinnemann and John Woolf opposed the production. They eventually filed an injunction to prevent Universal Pictures from using the name of the original novel and film, and it would be marketed as being &quot;inspired by&quot; rather than directly based on Forsyth&#x27;s novel. Edward Fox also reportedly turned down a cameo appearance in the film.

Chuck Pfarrer had written the first script, he was finishing up a three-year deal at Universal when he was offered the project, Pfarrer initially said no, but he agreed to write the script to fulfill contractual obligations to the studio, then Kevin Jarre did a rewrite to Pfarrer&#x27;s script, contributing the Richard Gere character, Declan Mulqueen, an imprisoned IRA terrorist who strikes up a bargain to assist the FBI. Caton-Jones later said in an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that he regretted not being there to supervise and contribute more to the screenplay:&quot;I never really liked the script. It was always too long, So I was trying to trim it as I went along and I really made the film in the editing room, stripping a lot of excess away&quot;.

An early test-screened version of the film had an innocent man shot by Willis&#x27; character hiding out in a gay bar. The audience loudly cheered the killing, which came to the attention of GLAAD. Chaz Bono (the group’s entertainment media director) spoke with &quot;Jackal&quot; producer Sean Daniel, who arranged to have the scene re-edited. Bruce Willis successfully fought to keep a same-sex kiss in the film.

==Release==
===Home media===
&quot;The Jackal&quot; was released on VHS, DVD and LaserDisc on April 28, 1998.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;The Jackal&quot; received a 24% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Jackal&quot; is a relatively simple chase thriller incapable of adding thrills or excitement as the plot chugs along.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 36 out of 100 based on 20 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called it a &quot;glum, curiously flat thriller&quot;; he also included the film in his &quot;Worst of 1997&quot;, comparing it to the 1973 film and calling it a &quot;retread&quot;, &quot;cruder&quot;, and &quot;dumbed down&quot;.
Ruthe Stein of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;more preposterous than thrilling&quot;; and Russell Smith of the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;1997&#x27;s most tedious movie&quot;.

At the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, Richard Gere received a nomination for Worst Fake Accent, but he lost to Jon Voight for &quot;Anaconda&quot; and &quot;Most Wanted&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;The Jackal&quot; was released on November 14, 1997, with an opening weekend totaling $15,164,595. It went on to gross $159,330,280 worldwide, against a $60 million budget.

==Music==

The original score for &quot;The Jackal&quot; was composed by Carter Burwell. It was never officially released on CD, although Burwell uploaded select cues from the film to his website. The project was not a happy experience for Burwell; he disliked the script, and disapproved of producer Danny Saber&#x27;s remix of his score.

<text>Catfight (also girl fight) is a term for an altercation between two women, often characterized as involving scratching, shoving, slapping, choking, punching, kicking, wrestling, biting, spitting, hair-pulling, and shirt-shredding. It can also be used to describe women insulting each other verbally or engaged in an intense competition for men, power, or occupational success. The catfight has been a staple of American news media and popular culture since the 1940s, and use of the term is often considered derogatory or belittling. Some observers argue that in its purest form, the word refers to two women, one blonde and the other a brunette, fighting each other. However, the term is not exclusively used to indicate a fight between women, and many formal definitions do not invoke gender.
== Etymology ==
The term &quot;catfight&quot; was recorded by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as the title and subject of an 1824 mock heroic poem by Ebenezer Mack. In the United States, it was first recorded as being used to describe a fight between women in an 1854 book written by Benjamin G. Ferris who wrote about Mormon women fighting over their shared husband. Their houses, according to Ferris, were designed to keep women &quot;as much as possible, apart, and prevent those terrible catfights which sometimes occur, with all the accompaniments of billingsgate [vulgar and coarse language], torn caps, and broken broomsticks.&quot; The word cat was originally a contemptuous term for either sex, but eventually came to refer to a woman considered loose or sexually promiscuous, or one regarded as spiteful, backbiting, and malicious.

== Responses ==
===Male===
Catfights are often described as titillating for heterosexual men. Portrayals of catfights in cartoons, movies and advertising often display participants as attractive, with &quot;supermodel physiques&quot;, dishevelled and missing articles of clothing, and catfights are often described by media aimed primarily at men as sexy.

===Female===
Women have often been critical of the term &quot;catfight&quot;, particularly when it is used in ways that may seem to inappropriately sexualize, neutralize, or trivialize disagreements among women on serious topics.

Feminist historians say use of the term catfight to label female opponents goes back to 1940, when American newspapers characterized as a catfight a dispute between Clare Boothe Luce and journalist Dorothy Thompson over which candidate to support in the 1940 presidential campaign. One newspaper called it &quot;a confrontation between two blonde Valkryies&quot;, and journalist Walter Winchell, upon running into Luce and Thompson at a nightclub, reportedly urged them not to fight, saying, &quot;Ladies, ladies, remember there are gentlemen present.&quot;

In the 1970s the American news media began to use the term &quot;catfight&quot; to describe women&#x27;s disagreements about issues related to women&#x27;s rights, such as the Equal Rights Amendment.

A University of British Columbia&#x27;s Sauder School of Business survey found that both female and male observers judged female vs. female conflicts to have more negative impacts on the workplace environment than conflicts that involved men.

== Usage in popular culture ==

Catfights first began appearing in American popular culture in the 1950s when postwar pioneers of pornography such as Irving Klaw produced film clips of women engaged in catfighting and wrestling. Klaw used many models and actresses in his works, including Bettie Page. The popularity of watching women fight increased in the postwar years and eventually moved into the mainstream of society. In the 1960s, catfights became popular in B movies such as Russ Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; and the 1969 animated Boris Karloff movie &quot;Mad Monster Party&quot;. In the 1970s and 1980s, catfights began to make appearances in women in prison films, in roller derby, and in nighttime soap operas such as &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Dynasty&quot;.

&quot;Dynasty&quot; starred John Forsythe as an oil tycoon and patriarch of a wealthy family that lived in Denver. The show co-starred blonde Linda Evans and brunette Joan Collins. The two women had a number of fights, both verbal and physical, during the show&#x27;s 9-year run on ABC. Designed to compete with &quot;Dallas&quot;, a highly popular evening drama on CBS, &quot;Dynasty&#x27;s&quot; first-year ratings were unremarkable. For the second season, the producers introduced the dark-haired Collins as a foil to the blonde Evans and hoped that her &quot;bitchy persona&quot; would enhance the show&#x27;s ratings, which it did. Wanting the ratings to go even higher, Douglas S. Cramer, &quot;Dynasty&quot; producer suggested that the two women have a &quot;knockdown, drag out fight&quot;. Cramer, in a 2008 interview, claimed that everybody loved the catfights except Joan Collins because &quot;Linda was so much stronger than she was.&quot; In a 2023 interview, Collins confirmed that she hated the catfights because &quot;... they were so stupid.&quot;

Dynasty upped the ante ... On one side was the blonde stay at home Krystal Carrington ... in the other corner was the most delicious bitch ever seen on television, the dark haired, scheming, career vixen, Alexis Carrington Colby ... Krystal just wanted to make her husband happy; Alexis wanted to control the world. How could you not love a catfight between these two? 

The &quot;Dynasty&quot; director&#x27;s blueprint for the first fight was, according to Evans, an &quot;outrageous catfight&quot; she had almost a decade earlier with Stefanie Powers in the detective series &quot;McCloud&quot;, starring Dennis Weaver. The fight occurs during an argument they are having in Evans&#x27; apartment when Powers, on her way out, grabs a bottle of seltzer water and sprays down Evans. Before she reaches the door, Evans grabs Powers and the two women engage in spirited catfight, wrecking the apartment in the process. During the fight, Powers&#x27; blouse is partially torn off, exposing her black bra, a surprising level of undress for network television in that era. Evans eventually overpowers her brunette opponent and is holding her head down in a water-filled aquarium when Weaver walks in, which ends the fight.

Catfights, both real and staged, are a staple of daytime television talk shows and reality television shows such as &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;, &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, &quot;For Love or Money&quot;, and &quot;The Real Housewives&quot; series, where women are frequently presented as being in continual competition with each other for love and professional success. In 2009, ABC-TV promoted &quot;The Bachelor&quot; with the voiceover narration &quot;Let the catfights begin&quot;, and reality television shows have frequently overlaid sound effects of hissing cats onto scenes featuring women arguing or competing with each other.

In 2002, an SABMiller television commercial called &quot;Catfight&quot; featured two young beautiful women drinking a beer in an outside cafe. Their polite conversation quickly turned into an argument about whether Miller Lite beer&#x27;s best aspect was its taste or the fact that it was less filling than other beers. The argument led to a fight where one of the girls knocked the other into an adjacent pool. The women quickly lost most of their clothes and continued the fight clad in only in their underwear. Before the fight came to a conclusion, the scene faded out and the viewers saw that it was a fantasy dreamed up by two men in a bar discussing what would make a great commercial. The scene would later cut to the girls, stripped down to their underwear, wrestling in a mud pit. An &quot;uncensored&quot; version was also filmed that included an alternate ending where the mud-covered girls kiss. Predictably, one critic noted, the fight was between a blonde and a brunette. The campaign generated considerable controversy, but sales of Miller Lite subsequently declined by 3%.

More than any other aspect of the catfight in today&#x27;s culture, the catfight&#x27;s sexually arousing potential is exploited for numerous purposes. The phenomenon of catfighting as erotic entertainment for straight men is widely documented throughout the Internet, television, film, and even pornography. On numerous websites ... web users are overwhelmingly presented with catfighting as highly sexual, even pornographic. So many websites act as sources of catfights as pornography that it would be hard to believe the catfight can be interpreted in any other way. Venturing onto ... these pages will lead a viewer to an abundance of videos and images of objectified women fighting with each other by pulling hair, scratching, and even biting each other. The interpretation of the catfight as sexy and gratifying for men is hardly uncommon on the Internet.—Rachel Reinke: &quot;Catfight: A Feminist Analysis&quot;

A 2019 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; titled &quot;Me-OW! It&#x27;s the End of the Catfight&quot;, pointed how the term has been slowly falling out of favor in light of the #MeToo movement, &quot;calling any conflict between women a catfight is understood to be sexist, and enthusiasm has generally dampened for women fighting&quot;. Notwithstanding, the author pointed out, remnants remained and cited the tabloid-created feud between Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle as an example.

== In the TV and film industry ==
The entertainment industry has produced many works that include catfights. Below is a selection of notable films and television episodes, many of them featuring major movie stars engaged in fighting.
* &quot;OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies&quot;. Academy Award winning director Michel Hazanavicius directed this 2007 French spy spoof that featured a clothes shredding catfight between Bérénice Bejo and Aure Atika. Instead of breaking up the fight, Jean Dujardin, in the role of OSS Agent 117, watches with glee as the two barefoot brunettes battle each other.
* &quot;2 Days in the Valley&quot;. Teri Hatcher and Charlize Theron star in what the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; referred to as the &quot;spandex cat fight of the year&quot;. According to director John Herzfeld the two women, who refused to use stunt doubles, were hitting each other so hard that at one point the filming was stopped after Hatcher connected to Theron&#x27;s chin so that the resulting bruise could be hidden by make-up. After filming, when Hatcher was asked about the &quot;catfight&quot;, she responded &quot;It was actually a brawl—not a catfight because technically a &#x27;catfight&#x27; is hair pulling and there was none of that.&quot;
* &quot;Back from Eternity&quot;. A 1956 remake of &quot;Five Came Back&quot; starring Phyllis Kirk and Anita Ekberg. Jealous over her apparent attraction to a pilot played by Keith Andes, Kirk starts a fight with Ekberg in a stream while washing clothes. Shooting the scene on a sound set required the creation of a stream with running water and foam rubber rocks to avoid injury to Kirk and Ekberg.
* &quot;Barfly&quot;. Faye Dunaway has a kicking, hair-pulling battle with Alice Krige in a Los Angeles bar, described by &quot;the Washington Post&quot; review of the movie as a &quot;cat fight on skid row ... (that is) as preposterous as the script as a whole.&quot;
* &quot;Carry on Girls&quot;. Barbara Windsor and Margaret Nolan in a publicity event for a forthcoming beauty contest, get into a fight over Nolan wearing a silver bikini in a hotel lobby that Windsor says she stole off her in a previous contest, tearing off Nolan&#x27;s hairpiece, her bikini top, and very nearly her bikini bottoms until contest organisers Sid James and Bernard Bresslaw just about manage to separate them apart. In a scene, shortly afterwards, Windsor said she deliberately provoked the catfight merely to arouse more publicity for the contest.
* &quot;Catwoman&quot;. Panned by critics, this 2004 movie nonetheless culminates in &quot;a world-class catfight&quot; between co-stars Halle Berry and Sharon Stone.
* &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. Iconic 1970s TV show starring, in its first season, Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett, and Jaclyn Smith. Dressed in a white bikini, Smith fought Rosemary Forsyth in the first season&#x27;s third episode titled &quot;Night of the Strangler&quot;. Smith later engaged stuntwoman Heidi von Beltz in a locker room fight during the season-two episode &quot;Angels in the Backfield&quot; (von Beltz would later become quadriplegic as a result of injuries sustained while performing a stunt in &quot;The Cannonball Run)&quot;. Cheryl Ladd joined the cast after Fawcett&#x27;s departure and fought Shera Danese in season three&#x27;s episode &quot;Disco Angels&quot;.
*&quot;Colorado Territory&quot;. Dorothy Malone tries to alert the visiting marshal, played by Morris Ankrum, that wanted felons played by Joel McCrea and Virginia Mayo have taken refuge in their ranch house, but is stopped by Mayo. The two women engage in what The Village Voice called one of &quot;The Best Catfights In Hollywood History.&quot;
*&quot;Community&quot;. In &quot;The Psychology of Letting Go&quot;, the third episode of the second season of the 2009 NBC sitcom, Alison Brie and Gillian Jacobs have a fundraiser rivalry that climaxes in an oil wrestling bout. Todd VanDerWerff, writing for The AV Club, commented &quot;At this point, a comedy throwing its two hot girls into an ironic mud fight is essentially just a non-ironic mud-fight, it&#x27;s happened so often.&quot;
* &quot;Comrade X&quot;. Hedy Lamarr and Natasha Lytess have a &quot;hair pulling battle&quot; over the affections of Clark Gable in this 1940 movie.
* &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot;. Marlene Dietrich and Una Merkel engage in &quot;one of the most famous female vs female fights ever captured on film.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; review of the 1939 movie said &quot;The scene that really counts though is the cat-fight between Miss Dietrich&#x27;s Frenchy and Una Merkel&#x27;s outraged Mrs. Callahan ... we thought the battle in &#x27;The Women&#x27; was an eye-opener, now we realize it was just shadow clawing. For the real thing, with no-holds barred and full access to chairs, tables, glasses, waterbuckets and as much hair that can be snatched from the opponent&#x27;s scalp, we give you not &#x27;The Women&#x27; but the two women who fight it out in Bloody Gulch.&quot; Adaptations of the movie include &quot;Frenchie&quot; starring Shelley Winters and Marie Windsor as the combatants and &quot;Destry&quot; starring Mari Blanchard and Mary Wickes. All four women, in both of the movies, were shown the Dietrich-Merkel fight in the original, as a point of reference.
The Dietrich-Merkel match-up, a riotous tooth-and-nail catfight lasting over two minutes, took five days to film. Dietrich was adamant about doing as much of her own fighting as was possible on the screen. Co-star Merkel realized that Dietrich wasn&#x27;t pulling any punches and opted to do her own fighting as well. Both actresses became carried away in the moment in front of the Hal Mohr&#x27;s camera and came away with scrapes, bruises and splinters. A first aid station was set up off the soundstage for injuries. Pioneering stuntwoman Helen Thurston filled in for Dietrich when the action became too heavy ... but the publicity claimed the stars did all their own stunts in one continuous take and were presented with champagne toasts and applause from the cast and crew. -- Gene Freese, &quot;Classic Movie Fight Scenes: 75 Years of Bare Knuckle Brawls, 1914-1989&quot;
* &quot;Eve&quot;. Celeste Yarnall stars in this 1968 film as a female version of Tarzan, living in the jungle with native peoples. Yarnall almost fell to her death while filming her fight scene with Mexican actress Rosenda Monteros when Monteros failed to follow the carefully scripted fight choreography and nearly kicked Yarnall off a 200-foot cliff.
* &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. In the role of James Bond, Sean Connery watches two gypsies engage in what many consider to be one of the entertainment industry&#x27;s most iconic catfights. The black-haired, dark-eyed, olive-skinned &quot;gypsy&quot; combatants were Martine Beswick and Aliza Gur. According to Beswick, their relationship on the set was not friendly and the film&#x27;s director, Terence Young encouraged Beswick to get rough with Gur.
I was a very nice girl but Aliza was a cow. We had terrible clashes and I was disgusted with her. I had a lot of anger inside of me so that [fight] scene was a perfect way to work it out. We rehearsed the fight for three weeks but when we shot it, Aliza was really fighting. Everyone encouraged me to fight back, so I did. We got into a real scrapping match.— Martine Beswick

* &quot;Girls in Prison&quot;. Inmates Joan Taylor and Adele Jergens fight each other in a muddy field. 
* &quot;Go West, Young Lady&quot;. Dance hall girl Ann Miller and her rival Penny Singleton have a &quot;rowdy free-for-all hair-pulling fight ... worth the price of admission&quot;, in this 1942 western starring Glenn Ford. One biographer noted that the scene was humiliating for Miller, as she lost the energetic fight to Singleton.
* &quot;Gun Girls&quot;. 1957 American crime film, ridiculed for sloppy production and dialogue as well as for having women in their 20s portray teen-aged criminals. During the movie, Eve Brent fights Eleise Cameron when she finds Cameron in her boyfriend&#x27;s apartment. Brent would later star as Jane in &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Fight for Life&quot;.
* &quot;Gunslinger&quot;. Beverly Garland and Allison Hayes fight in this Roger Corman directed western. Garland, who injured her ankle filming an earlier scene, told Corman she was unable to stand up, let alone film a fight scene with Hayes. Corman responded by having a doctor inject her ankle with painkillers. In her biography, Garland said &quot;You could be dead and Roger would find a way to film around that. We filmed the fight scene and I did all my own stunts ... we really scratched, punched and pulled each others hair! Of course I couldn&#x27;t work for several weeks after that, I couldn&#x27;t walk on that leg. But Roger got his scenes, that&#x27;s all that mattered.&quot;
* &quot;Hot Blood&quot;. 1956 musical drama starring Jane Russell and Cornel Wilde where Wilde is tricked by his brother into an arranged marriage with tempestuous Annie Caldash, played by Russell. &quot;One of the liveliest scenes in the movie is a hair pulling battle, blonde vs brunette, when Jane encounters a rival for her hubby&#x27;s affections ... and a free-for-all with blonde Helen Westcott follows.&quot;

* &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot;. Uma Thurman in the role of The Bride uses a combination of swords, knives, and martial arts to kill Lucy Liu, Vivica Fox and Daryl Hannah.
* &quot;Kansas City Bomber&quot;. Raquel Welch stars in this feature film about the sport of female roller derby. Portraying a divorcee and single parent, Welch in the role of K.C. Carr, engages in a number of fights, most notably against actress Helena Kallianiotes who plays the role of a fading roller derby star, Jackie Burdette. Two weeks into the shoot, Welch suffered a cut lip and swollen face during a fight scene with Kallianiotes. An MGM spokesman said the two actors &quot;got carried away&quot; and Welch &quot;got slugged&quot; by Kallianiotes.
* &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;. Brief scene with Jenny Agutter fighting Farrah Fawcett. Allegedly, the fight scene was to be much longer but the director, Michael Anderson became concerned that the two women were pulling each other&#x27;s hair so hard, that a real fight would erupt.
* &quot;Meet Me in Las Vegas&quot;. Cyd Charisse and Liliane Montevecchi &quot;rip off jewelry and various parts of clothing&quot; in a dance fight choreographed by Hermes Pan to the song Frankie and Johnny performed by Sammy Davis Jr. The dance sequence took over a month to rehearse and an entire week to film. The film received an Oscar nomination for best musical score.
* &quot;Mesa of Lost Women&quot;. Jackie Coogan stars as a mad scientist in this 1953 B movie directed by Ron Ormond. Near the film&#x27;s conclusion actresses Mary Hill and Tandra Quinn fight each other in Coogan&#x27;s laboratory.
* &quot;&quot;. In a 1966 episode titled &quot;Old Man Out&quot;, former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley and Barbara Bain fake a lengthy cat fight as a diversionary tactic while the Mission Impossible team breaks a man out of prison.
* &quot;Naked Gun&quot;. Saloon girls Veda Ann Borg and Mara Corday fight over stolen money in this 1956 western

* &quot;Off Limits&quot;. In this 1953 film, during a boxing match, where one of the fighters is being managed by Bob Hope, two of Hope&#x27;s girlfriends, Joan Taylor and Carolyn Jones, get into a boxing match of their own, distracting both the audience and the boxers fighting in the ring.
* &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot;. Remake of the similarly titled 1940 film. The remake featured two barefoot, bikini-clad women, one being the &quot;good blonde&quot; Raquel Welch and the other, the &quot;bad brunette&quot; Martine Beswick, who get into one of the most famous catfights in film history.
* &quot;Perils of Nyoka&quot;. A 1942 movie serial shown in 15 parts, starring Kay Aldridge as the imperiled Nyoka and Lorna Gray as her female nemesis, the evil Vultura. Aldridge, attractively attired in jungle shorts, and Gray also attractively attired in a revealing sarong, engage in multiple fights, the climactic battle occurring in the serial&#x27;s final chapter when Vultura attempts to escape with a valuable treasure, only to be confronted by Nyoka. &quot;The wrestling match between the two girls, their naked legs entwined, had something for everyone.&quot; Watching the women fight was Vultura&#x27;s pet gorilla who, seeing that Nyoka was winning the fight, launched a spear at her, but missed and instead killed Vultura.
* &quot;Planet Earth&quot;. A 1974 made-for-TV science fiction movie created by Gene Roddenberry about a post-apocalyptic matriarchal society where women keep men drugged and use them as slaves. Led by John Saxon in the role of Dylan Hunt, a team of outsiders that includes Janet Margolin as Harper-Smythe, visits a village looking for a missing friend. Hunt is quickly taken prisoner by Diana Muldaur in the role of Marg, the head Amazon. Smythe quickly realizes she will have to fight Marg to get him back.
Marc Daniels brings professional polish and brisk pacing to the telefilm and the action sequences are very nicely-staged ... there&#x27;s a very well-done catfight between Muldaur and Margolin where it&#x27;s clear that the two actresses are doing much of the stuntwork themselves.
Prior to that encounter, Smythe fights actress Sally Kemp in the role of an Amazon housemistress named Treece. The confrontation was interrupted by Treece&#x27;s children who were clearly distraught at the site of their mother fighting another woman.
This mirrors a scene in &quot;Genesis II&quot; in which the shock wave from a nuclear explosion Hunt has triggered strikes on a Pax lookout just as a mother has brought her young children out to see the stars. There and in the &quot;Planet Earth&quot; scene, the heroes witness the effect of their own violence on children, forcing them to rethink the use of force—a very effective and intelligent pacifistic touch from Roddenberry.
* &quot;San Antone&quot;. 1953 western where &quot;bitchy Southern belle Arleen Whelan&quot; attacks Mexican Katy Jurado with a knife. Jurado disarms Wheelan and the two fight each other until broken up by returning members of the group.

* &quot;Star in the Dust&quot;. Actresses Randy Stuart and Coleen Gray invited their husbands to watch the filming of their fight scene in this 1956 western. At the conclusion, Gray recalled in a later interview, the women dusted themselves off, but the two husbands &quot;were pale and clammy and weak&quot; having watched their wives engage in a fistfight. 
* &quot;Stories of the Century&quot;. Premier episode of the 1954 season featured Detective Frankie Adams, played by Mary Castle, attempting to subdue Marie Windsor, in the role of Belle Starr
* &quot;Swashbuckler&quot;. During a bar scene, Geneviève Bujold accuses another woman of owning a trinket that is rightfully hers. The dispute leads to a fight between Bujold and stunt actress Lee Pulford. The fight ends with Bujold knocking out her opponent. In an interview after the release of the film, the blonde-haired Pulford, who described herself as very athletic, said that Bujold didn&#x27;t know how to fight and that during the rehearsals she was extra careful not to hurt the slender French-Canadian actress, one of the film&#x27;s major co-stars.
* &quot;Tarzan and the Slave Girl&quot;. Jane, played by Vanessa Brown and Denise Darcel in the role of Lola, have a hair pulling, furniture throwing catfight in this 1950 Tarzan entry. In a 2001 interview, Brown claimed that &quot;Denise was impossible ... I really didn&#x27;t like her. I don&#x27;t think the catfight scene took much preparation on my part.&quot;
* &quot;The Bounty Hunter&quot;. Marie Windsor and Dolores Dorn engage in a &quot;hair-pulling, kicking battle&quot; over a gun in this 1954 Randolph Scott western.
* &quot;The Leech Woman&quot;. At gun point, Coleen Gray fights Gloria Talbott. Before the scene was filmed, Gray mentioned to Talbott that she was pretty strong and wouldn&#x27;t have any problem taking the gun away. Talbott was taken aback by the comment and approached the scene with the intent of overpowering her blonde co-star even though the script called for Gray to win the fight. Years later, Talbott admitted in an interview that Gray was right, she was much stronger than Talbott, throwing her into a closet as the two women went off-script, wrestling each other.
* &quot;The Mini-Skirt Mob&quot;. Diane McBain stars as the leader of an all-female motorcycle gang. Furious that her ex-boyfriend married another woman (played by Sherry Jackson), she spends the entire movie terrorizing the couple and, at one point, gives a vicious beating to Jackson. Off-screen, McBain and Jackson were close friends and shared a Hollywood apartment.

* &quot;The New Adventures of Wonder Woman&quot;. In the 90 minute made-for-TV 1975 pilot movie, Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman fights Stella Stevens who plays the role of a Nazi spy. The previous year, an initial attempt to start a Wonder Woman TV series starring Cathy Lee Crosby failed when it did not garner sufficient TV ratings for ABC Television to renew as a series. The movie was criticized for featuring the blonde-haired Crosby in the role traditionally reserved for a brunette, a decision that even Crosby had questioned. Crosby did have two short fights, one of which was against a renegade Amazon played by Anitra Ford.
* &quot;The Old Chisholm Trail&quot;. Johnny Mack Brown and Tex Ritter are singing cowboys in this 1942 western that also stars Mady Correll as a scheming ranch owner and Jennifer Holt as the blonde heroine who own the local trading post where the two women get into a &quot;vicious catfight&quot;. 
* &quot;The San Francisco Docks&quot;. Actress Esther Ralston, described as a &quot;hard fighting blonde glamor girl&quot;, told director Arthur Lubin that her and fellow actress Irene Hervey did not want to have stunt doubles perform their fight scene, described by press accounts as a &quot;whirlwind fistfight ... said to overshadow the most hectic feminine movie battles seen in recent motion pictures.&quot; Hervey later described the fight as a &quot;terrific battle between me and Esther Ralston—with hair-pulling, kicking, the works.&quot; 
* &quot;The Spy in the Green Hat&quot;. In this theatrical version of the two-part &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; episode titled &quot;The Concrete Overcoat Affair&quot;, Leticia Roman tries to escape from the guard of Janet Leigh who responds by pulling a knife from her garter belt and attacking Roman. Knocking the knife out of Leigh&#x27;s hand, the two women &quot;roll around together on a conference table, and a good old-fashioned catfight ensues.&quot; One critic described it as &quot;what may very well be one of the sexiest spy movie scenes ever, Janet Leigh versus Roman wrestling in skirts is the stuff dreams are made of.&quot; Advertisements showing the dark-haired Roman fighting the blonde Leigh were featured in many newspapers. One caption read &quot;Guest stars Janet Leigh and Leticia Roman use cat-like tactics in this sparring scene from Friday night&#x27;s &#x27;Man From Uncle&#x27; telecast.&quot;
* &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. Near the end of the movie, Raquel Welch fights Faye Dunaway, a battle described by Dunaway as a fight &quot;where we try, more or less, to tear each other to pieces. Welch and Dunaway worked with trainers to make their fight as &quot;physical and brutal&quot; as possible without injuring themselves, although Welch suffered a sprained wrist when Dunaway shoved her so hard she fell.
* &quot;The Turning Point&quot;. In the film&#x27;s pivotal scene, the two adult female protagonists, portrayed by Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine, have an extended catfight on the roof of Lincoln Center.
* &quot;The Women&quot;. After Paulette Goddard steals Rosalind Russell&#x27;s husband, the two get into a kicking, hair-pulling fight that took three days and eight changes of costume to shoot. During the fight, Russell bit Goddard in the leg. Russell later said that Goddard suffered a permanent scar from the bite, but that the two actresses remained friends. A 1955 remake of the film was featured on the TV show &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot;. Goddard and Mary Boland were the only cast members from the original 1939 film. Allegedly, Goddard and Shelley Winters, a cast member of the remake, engaged in an actual &quot;hair-pulling fist fight&quot; during one of the rehearsals. Unlike the original, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s 1956 remake titled, &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot;, included men, music, color, and songs. During the rehearsal of the Russell-Goddard catfight from the original movie, Ann Miller punched co-star Delores Gray hard enough to knock her off her feet, twice. Later in the movie, June Allyson slapped Joan Collins so hard filming was postponed until Collin&#x27;s facial swelling went down.

* &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;. Nancy Kwan battles Sharon Tate in a karate scene choreographed by Bruce Lee. Released in 1968, this was one of Tate&#x27;s last films before she was murdered by Charles Manson. &quot;Tate looks stunning in her micro-minis and even has a catfight with Nancy Kwan&#x27;s evil enemy agent.&quot;
* &quot;Total Recall&quot;. Directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as Douglas Quaid, the 1990 film featured a &quot;knock down, drag-out battle between Quaid&#x27;s wife (Sharon Stone) and his dream girl Rachel Ticotin. One reviewer noted that it was &quot;the best screen fight between two women since &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot;&quot;. A 2012 remake of the film featured Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel, in the roles previously filled by Stone and Ticotin.
* &quot;True Lies&quot;. Jamie Lee Curtis and Tia Carrere engage in a &quot;precisely choreographed catfight&quot; while in the back seat of an out of control limousine. 
* &quot;Untamed Youth&quot;. Arguing over a bed in a prison camp dormitory, Lori Nelson fights Jeanne Carmen in the 1957 film about juvenile delinquency. The scene has been noted for unusual dialogue: before they fight, Nelson asks Carmen if she wants &quot;an Italian hair cut&quot;, presumably referring to hair pulling. The fight begins with the dark-haired Carmen threatening to give Nelson a &quot;beating&quot;, the two barefoot girls proceed to punch and wrestle each other until Carmen surrenders to her blonde opponent by telling her &quot;Don&#x27;t hit me in the mouth again, you&#x27;ll break my dental plate.&quot;
* &quot;View from the Top&quot;. Flight attendants Gwyneth Paltrow and Christina Applegate fight each other in the cabin of a passenger airline.
* &quot;War Goddess&quot;. 1973 film, directed by Terence Young who had previously directed &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; that included the Beswick-Gur catfight scene. &quot;War Goddess&quot; featured an oil wrestling match between Sabine Sun and Alena Johnston, two amazons who were in competition to become the leader of their tribe.
* &quot;Woman They Almost Lynched&quot;. Saloon owner Audrey Totter has a &quot;hair pulling fight ... and then one of those clear-the-streets gunfight&quot; with challenger Joan Leslie.
* &quot;Yankee Pasha&quot;. Rhonda Fleming and Mamie Van Doren are both in love with Jeff Chandler leading to a &quot;catfight for supremacy&quot; where Fleming landed an actual punch on Van Doren&#x27;s jaw, sending her sprawling across the set. Van Doren later said that Fleming was &quot;quite a fighter&quot;. Despite the mishap in what was otherwise a carefully choreographed fight that involved a lot of &quot;tumbling and hair pulling&quot;, Van Doren claimed that as a young actress, she enjoyed working with Fleming in the movie.

== Eroticism ==
Catfight is also the collective term for a fetish-like inclination, which has its erotic attraction in the competitive as well as the playful test of strength between women. This inclination is primarily voyeuristic and includes among other sports wrestling, arm wrestling and boxing.

The porn industry portrays intimate wrestling matches which sometimes lead to orgasmic entanglements and open tribadism. In some cases, sexual arousal and climax are the mutual goals of a female wrestling match. The main rule of such a &quot;sex fight&quot; is usually: Whoever has an orgasm first, loses. Nonetheless, multiple orgasms are possible. Therefore, tribadic scenes and erotic fights cannot always be distinguished. So-called &quot;sexfights&quot;, &quot;pussyfights&quot; or &quot;tribfights&quot; form separate categories among commercially produced videos.

From the 1990s to the mid-2000s, Napali Video and California Wildcats were groundbreaking for the production and publication of such videos in the Anglo-American region. Depending on the film, the depicted focus was on different types of duels, including wrestling, boxing, sexfighting or titfighting, the aggressive squeezing or rubbing of the breasts. However, clearly lesbian acts were almost always part of the scenes presented. Actresses for &quot;Napali Video&quot; and &quot;California Wildcats&quot; included Puma Swede, Vanessa Blue, Kim Chambers, Penny Flame and Jessica Jaymes. In particular, Tanya Danielle and Devon Michaels repeatedly appeared together in multiple videos, which gave the impression of an actual rivalry and both actresses became icons of the scene.

Eventually, the first European productions appeared around the same time. The Austrian production company &quot;Danube Women Wrestling&quot; (DWW), which had previously primarily specialized in erotic wrestling matches, also marketed sexfighting videos until 2011 under the &quot;Tribgirls&quot; label. The wrestlers were initially mainly of Hungarian and later Czech nationality. The production of videos was continued from 2012 on by &quot;Fighting-Dolls.com&quot; and &quot;Trib-Dolls.com&quot; from Brno, who followed in the footsteps of &quot;DWW&quot; and &quot;Tribgirls&quot;. However, some of the women switched to the &quot;Foxy Combat&quot; studio, which is operated by former DWW wrestler Hana Klima since 2007 and which has also been producing videos of erotic wrestling and sexfighting ever since. &quot;Foxy Combat&quot; is also based in Brno, which means that two competing production companies are based in the second largest city in the Czech Republic. Meanwhile, commercially produced videos of lesbian sexfights are no longer uncommon and come from the United States as well as Europe and East Asia.

<text>Satra Corporation was a US trading and metal processing company. It is primarily known in the United Kingdom for its Satra Motors Limited subsidiary, which was the official importer and distributor of Soviet Union cars and motorcycles in that country from 1973 to 1979. Satra is an acronym for &quot;Soviet American Trade Association&quot;.

==Subsidiaries==
Satra Motors imported, modified, and distributed Soviet cars, such as Lada and Moskvich, and motorcycles made by Ural, Dnepr, Voskhod, Minsk, and the IZh whose Planeta and Jupiter were marketed. The motorcycles were sold in Britain and Australia under a single brand name, Cossack.

Satra Motors was based in Carnaby, Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire on the old airfield.

==Cossack motorcycles==
The term Cossack Motorcycle can apply to any number of motorcycles, made in the former Soviet Union, a reference to the horseback riding Cossacks. Some are derived from the design of the 1938 BMW R71 sidecar motorcycle. Examples include the Russian Ural or the Ukrainian Dnipro.

&quot;Cossack&quot; was also the brand name applied to all Soviet motorcycles distributed by &quot;Satra Belarus&quot; from 1973 to 1979, originally located in Surrey, southern England, later moving to Carnaby in eastern England and being used by the Australian importer, Capitol Motors until May 1976 when their motorcycle division closed. 

Ural, Dnipro, IZh, Voskhod and Minsk were some of the former Soviet Union manufacturers whose bikes were imported and rebadged.

<text>Sedoheptulose or pseudoheptulose or -&quot;altro&quot;-heptulose is a ketoheptose—a monosaccharide with seven carbon atoms and a ketone functional group. It is one of the few heptoses found in nature, and is found in various fruits and vegetables ranging from carrots and leeks to figs, mangos and avocados.

It is an intermediate in respiratory and photosynthetic pathways and plays a vital role in the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway.

Studies have shown that 7-O-galloyl-D-sedoheptulose, a chemical extracted from dogwood fruit, is able to reduce pro-inflammatory markers &quot;in vivo&quot; such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein and thus might be able reduce low-level inflammation in humans. While this compound contains a sedoheptulose moiety, sedoheptulose itself has not been shown to possess the same properties.

==Awards==

* SATRA won the Queen&#x27;s Award to Industry (Now Queen&#x27;s award for Enterprise) in 1969 for its Heat Setting Process
* SATRA won Interiors Monthly award for Best Product Testing Provider 2024 for its Furniture and Flooring testing

==Everest boots==
SATRA played a role in the successful expedition to the top of Mount Everest in 1953 in which Sir Edmund Hillary, along with Tenzing Norgay, became the first person to &#x27;stand on top of the world&#x27;. In 1952, SATRA was approached by The British Expedition to produce 34 pairs of boots to meet the challenge of climbing in one of the most inhospitable environments on the planet. The boots were designed to provide a high level of thermal insulation for use in high altitude and saw a combination of inner vapour barrier, mesh insoles and an integrated rubber outer gaiter: the water resistant vapour barrier&#x27;s inner layer stopped the boots becoming soaked with sweat then freezing; the mesh insole allowed sweat to disperse from the socks; the outer gaiter prevented melting snow soaking in to the boot itself. There were five layers of Ceiba pentandra•kapok insulation, a naturally hollow fibre and a forerunner of synthetic versions. The boot lasting technique helped prevent compression of the vital insulation material and microcellular resin soles further improved insulation and decreased weight.

The result was boots that weighed only 4 lb 4oz (1.9kg) almost 1kg lighter than comparable footwear at the time, and a successful expedition in which no-one who wore the boots got frostbite – a remarkable achievement.

<text>Santy is a computer worm created in Perl to exploit a vulnerability in phpBB software which used Google to spread across the Internet.

== Overview ==
Within 24 hours of its release on 20 December 2004, about 30,000 to 40,000 websites were attacked by Santy. The worm holds a record of spreading worldwide within three hours of its release. It caused writable files (of formats such as .php and .html) on the infected servers to display the message &quot;This site is defaced!!! This site is defaced!!! NeverEverNoSanity WebWorm generation X&quot;, where X is a number representing the generation of the worm.

There have been variants of the worm, some that use alternative search engines after Google blocked queries from the Santy worm, and an anti-Santy anti-worm that attempts to patch vulnerable installations.

The phpBB Group had released a patch for the vulnerability a month before the attacks, in phpBB 2.0.11.

<doc id="1321869" wikidata="Q2058876" url="?curid=1321869" title="Yuya Uchida (singer)">
<text>was a Japanese singer, record producer, and actor. With a career spanning six decades, he was a major figure in Japanese music. Kazuo Takeda stated that Japanese rock would not be what it is today without Uchida, as he was one of the first to bring what was happening in the West in the mid-1960s back to Japan.

He appeared in numerous films, such as Nagisa Ōshima&#x27;s &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot;, and won two best acting awards. He also starred in the American film &quot;Black Rain&quot;.

==Career==
Uchida was born in Nishinomiya. He dropped out of high school at age 17 and began his music career in 1957. He became friends with John Lennon after opening for The Beatles on their 1966 tour of Japan.

Shocked after seeing Jimi Hendrix perform in London in 1967, Uchida returned home and wanted to introduce a similar sound to Japan. He formed Yuya Uchida &amp; The Flowers who released the album &quot;Challenge!&quot; in 1969, which is composed almost entirely of covers of Western psychedelic rock acts. After replacing all but one member and Uchida reverting to a producer/manager role himself, the group changed their name to Flower Travellin&#x27; Band and released another cover album, 1970&#x27;s &quot;Anywhere&quot;, before relocating to Canada. Before the move they recorded an album of original material in just two days; &quot;Satori&quot; was released in North America in 1971 by GRT Records. The band produced two more albums, &quot;Made in Japan&quot; (1972) and &quot;Make Up&quot; (1973), before separating for 34 years.

In addition to his solo career and Flower Travellin&#x27; Band, he worked with a large variety of musicians both domestic and international, and recorded with The Ventures and Frank Zappa in the mid-1970s. In 1975 he produced an international music festival titled &quot;World Rock Festival&quot; which featured artists from around the world performing together. That same year, Uchida also produced the self-titled album by Creation.

He unsuccessfully ran for the 1991 Tokyo gubernatorial election.

Uchida collaborated with pop idol Rino Sashihara for the 2014 duet single &quot;Shekina Baby&quot;.

==Personal life and legal troubles==
Yuya Uchida married actress Kirin Kiki in 1973. The two separated two years later but remained legally married until her death in 2018. Their daughter is an essayist/singer and married to actor Masahiro Motoki, who was adopted into the Uchida family as a &quot;mukoyōshi&quot;. Yuya was the grandfather to three children by his daughter.

Uchida was arrested in September 1977 for violating Japan&#x27;s Cannabis Control Law. Although Uchida admitted ten years later that he was smoking it at the time, the charges were dropped &quot;Nolle prosequi&quot;. He was arrested again in 1983 for violating Japan&#x27;s Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law. Uchida entered the offices of Udo Artists, Inc. with a kitchen knife and threatened a rock promoter for allegedly paying foreign artists far more money than Japanese ones. Again, he was never indicted.

Uchida successfully underwent emergency eye surgery on May 31, 2005, for a blocked retinal artery, which would have led to blindness. In mid-November 2005, his house was broken into and several watches and jackets were stolen.

On May 13, 2011, Uchida was arrested for assault and trespassing after threatening his former girlfriend, whom he began dating in December 2009. The police said that Uchida allegedly hit the 50-year-old woman after she tried ending their relationship in March and began sending her threatening letters. The woman said she had her locks changed, but Uchida then had another locksmith open the door and entered her house on April 19. Uchida acknowledged writing the letters and having spare keys made to her house, but denied threatening her.

==Death==
Yuya Uchida died from pneumonia in a Tokyo hospital on March 17, 2019, aged 79. He received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 61st Japan Record Awards on December 30, 2019.

<text>The Great Western Railway 3252 or Duke Class were 4-4-0 steam locomotives with outside frames and parallel domed boilers. They were built in five batches between 1895 and 1899 for express passenger train work in Devon and Cornwall. William Dean was their designer, possibly with the collaboration of his assistant, George Jackson Churchward. Four prototype 4-4-0s, of the Armstrong Class, had already been built in 1894.

==Design==
===Frames and wheels===
The outside frames of the Dukes were curved upwards over each pair of driving wheels. Inner and outer frames were thick. The first 40 members of the class were fitted with Mansell pattern bogie wheels with wooden centres. The first 25 tenders built also had Mansell pattern wheels, and a shorter than normal wheelbase of so that the locomotives would fit on the smaller turntables then in use west of Newton Abbot. The engine bogie was of a centre-less type designed by Dean.

===Boilers===
The majority of the class were fitted with round-topped fireboxes of the same diameter as the boiler. The last four were fitted with Belpaire fireboxes, raised a few inches above the boilers. Eighteen of the Duke class were later rebuilt with domeless tapered boilers and Belpaire fireboxes between October 1906 and January 1909. They were reclassified as members of the Bulldog Class. A further Duke, no. 3273 &quot;Armorel&quot;, had been fitted with a parallel domeless boiler in February 1902, converting it to a Camel Class locomotive. It was fitted with a Bulldog-type boiler in October 1910. By December 1923 all remaining Dukes had been fitted with flush-topped Belpaire fireboxes and domed boilers pressed to . Duke no. 3258, &quot;King Arthur&quot;, built August 1895, was fitted with a superheater in December 1896. The rest of the class, with the exception of two locomotives, were fitted with superheaters between August 1911 and September 1946. The class had distinctive long smokeboxes, extended to hold a diaphragm plate and net for spark prevention.

===Cylinders and valves===
Slide valves were fitted underneath the cylinders, and were driven directly by eccentrics on the leading driving axle through Stephenson valve gear. This position had the advantage that, when the regulator was closed and steam pressure shut off, the valves would drop away from the steam ports, thus reducing wear on the valves and port faces. Dean&#x27;s earlier designs had used slide valves mounted vertically between the cylinders; the new position allowed an increase in cylinder diameter from to in the Armstrong Class. The Dukes had diameter cylinders, possibly due to permanent way weight restrictions and a reduced supply of steam from the Dukes&#x27; smaller boilers.

==Renumbering==
The Dukes were subject to the 1912 renumbering of GWR 4-4-0 locomotives. Those Dukes rebuilt as Bulldogs were renumbered as members of that class in the series 3300–3455. The remaining Dukes were renumbered consecutively as 3252–3291, this block of numbers having previously been allocated to the first batch of Duke Class locomotives.

==Rebuilding==
By the 1930s many of the Duke class were becoming uneconomical to repair, particularly with regard to the curved outside frames, which were weaker than the later straight-topped version. A number of the class had been transferred to the ex-Cambrian Railways main line, where permanent way restrictions debarred the use of heavier locomotives.

In December 1929, no. 3265, &quot;Tre Pol and Pen&quot;, was withdrawn, and the cylinders and motion, together with a spare Duke boiler and smokebox, were fitted to the straight-topped frames and cab of Bulldog no. 3365 &quot;Charles Grey Mott&quot;. The rebuilt locomotive retained the name and number of the Duke. The reduction in axle weight, as compared to the Bulldogs, allowed for working over the Cambrian section.

From 1936 a further twenty-nine of the Dukes were withdrawn and replaced by Bulldogs fitted with Duke boilers and motion, reclassified as Earl Class locomotives. The onset of World War II brought a halt to the program, the last replacement being in November 1939, leaving ten Dukes to pass into British Railways ownership. These were scrapped between June 1949 and July 1951, the last survivor being No. 9089, formerly no. 3289 &quot;St Austell&quot; of July 1899. 

==In fiction==
The fate of the Dukes are mentioned by Duck the Great Western Engine in the Reverend Wilbert Awdry&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Very Old Engines&quot;.

<text>Theo H. Davies &amp; Co. is a company that was one of the Big Five trading and agricultural companies in the Territory of Hawaii.

==History==
Starkey, Janion, &amp; Co. was a trading company founded in Liverpool in April 1845 by Englishmen James and John Starkey and Robert Cheshyre Janion. Janion arrived in Honolulu in August, selling the first boat-load of merchandise. Janion acquired a building in a prime location on the Honolulu Harbor after the firm of Ladd &amp; Co. went out of business, and some of the last undeveloped land that was part of the claim of former British Consul Richard Charlton.
The Starkey brothers bought more goods in England, where they were traded with Hawaiian exports and gold. After the California Gold Rush their business soon expanded to include their own fleet of ships, and selling insurance as the local agent for Lloyd&#x27;s of London.

In 1849 another Briton William Lowthian Green was hired, and when the Starkey brothers pulled out in 1851, the name was changed to Janion &amp; Co. In 1857, Welshman Theophilus Harris Davies arrived in Hawaii and joined the company as a clerk for Green. In 1859 Green became a partner. Davies worked his way up in the company, but left when his contract expired in 1862. In 1863 Davies returned to work as an agent for a sugarcane plantation, but left again when his contract expired in 1866. In 1867 Janion &amp; Green were in financial trouble, and Davies was brought in to reorganize. Davies and Janion formed a new partnership in 1871.

Davies raised capital in London and invested in plantations on the island of Hawaii. In 1875, he refinanced the Honolulu Iron Works and hired Alexander Young. He would partner with Young in a number of future businesses.
Davies took full control of the company after Janion died in 1881, and incorporated his growing interests in the sugar industry. The business expanded to add departments for steamship agents, grocery stores, dry goods, and hardware. Under the laws of the Provisional Government of Hawaii, it became Theo. H. Davies &amp; Co., Ltd. in January, 1894.

After Davies died in 1898, Francis Mills Swanzy became managing director and T. Clive Davies (son of Theo) as board member. In 1917 T. Clive Davies and Ernest Hay Wodehouse were named co-managing directors, but Davies died the same day. A new headquarters building built in 1921 served through the 1960s when a 32-story Davies Pacific Center was built at 841 Bishop Street.
In 1928 the company opened a Manila branch and expanded with sugarcane plantations in the Philippines.
John E. Russell led the company until the 1950s. Geoffrey C. Davies (T. Clive&#x27;s son) became chairman, followed by Gerald M. Wilkinson. James H. Tabor, Harold E. Weidig, and Milton Pickup then served as presidents. In 1967 Dillingham Corp. made a failed takeover attempt.

Theo H. Davies &amp; Co. remained in family hands until 1973, when the family sold the company to Hong Kong–based conglomerate Jardine Matheson. Davies became the first big five company to get out of sugar, selling the Hamakua Sugar Company in 1984 to Francis S. Morgan. Hamakua Sugar filed for bankruptcy just 8 years later in 1992 and was liquidated. 

Jardine then diversified its holdings, buying the franchises in Hawaii for restaurants such as Pizza Hut and Taco Bell and auto marques such as Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar. Starting in 2003, Jardine gradually sold its various holdings in the islands.

Theo H. Davies (Manila), founded in 1928, currently exists as a separate holding company. JTH Davies, under the control of Philippine businessman Eusebio Tanco, who is involved in education, insurance, shipping and overseas job placement businesses in Manila and other locations in the Philippines.

<text>George Stacy is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, primarily in association with Spider-Man. He is Gwen Stacy&#x27;s father and the police captain from the New York City Police Department. Stacy is a strong supporter of Spider-Man, often defending the superhero when others accuse Spider-Man of criminal acts, and thus serves as a foil personality to another Spider-Man related character, J. Jonah Jameson. Stacy&#x27;s death in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #90 (November 1970) has been described as a turning point in the Spider-Man saga, signaling to readers that permanent changes could happen in the story, and that the supporting cast was not safe. Stacy was resurrected in a cloned body by Ben Reilly in &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot; (2016–2017), with the embodiment of Death herself confirming in &quot;Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider&quot; (2017–2018) that all clones Ben created of deceased people had their souls intact on being brought back, before Stacy was killed again by the Carrion Virus.

The character has been adapted from the comics into several forms of media, including animated series and feature films. In live-action, the character was played by James Cromwell in the film &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007), by Denis Leary in Marc Webb&#x27;s &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; film duology (2012–2014), and by Shea Whigham in &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; (2023) and &quot;Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse&quot; (TBA).

==Publication history==
George Stacy first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #56 (January 1968), created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Romita Sr.

==Fictional character history==
Little did Peter Parker know, after falling in love with Empire State University classmate Gwen Stacy that her father was Captain George Stacy, one of the most respected former police members in the NYPD. He is also the husband of Helen Stacy and the brother of Arthur Stacy. But even in retirement, Captain Stacy kept up with the happenings at the department - and had taken a keen interest in Spider-Man. It was not long before John Jameson called Stacy out of retirement to assist in the return of a device called the Nullifier - which could render any electrical or mechanical apparatus inoperative - that Doctor Octopus had tricked an amnesiac Spider-Man into stealing.

After safely securing the weapon, Stacy interviewed Peter, believed to have been held captive with Doc Ock and Spider-Man. After the interview, Stacy revealed to Peter that he had spent time studying the career of Spider-Man, and that he was glad to have met Peter, known for photographing the wall-crawler on numerous occasions.

Identifying himself as a strong supporter of Spider-Man, Captain Stacy wished to see the wall-crawler redeemed in the public eye. He also took an instant liking to Peter, and openly encouraged the growing bond between the youngster and his daughter Gwen. Shortly thereafter at a dance club which employed Mary Jane Watson, Captain Stacy was put under a hypnotic trance through a rigged camera operated by Mary Jane who took photos of him unaware that these actions were aiding Wilson Fisk (aka the Kingpin). Stacy was compelled into a backroom where he underwent additional brainwashing by the camera&#x27;s inventor, Dr. Winkler.

Despite Spider-Man&#x27;s efforts, George returned programmed to follow the Kingpin&#x27;s directions. As such, Captain Stacy later stole police records for the Kingpin while Spider-Man&#x27;s automatic camera captured the theft. Peter gave the photos to J. Jonah Jameson, hopeful that this apparent betrayal of the Stacy family would actually help expedite a discovery of the captain&#x27;s innocence. While George and Gwen attempted to flee, they were kidnapped by the Kingpin&#x27;s men and held captive at one of Norman Osborn&#x27;s labs where Dr. Winkler worked. The Kingpin intended to eliminate the Stacys once they were used to lure Spider-Man into his crushing hands. While Spider-Man battled the Kingpin, Osborn arrived and tackled the Kingpin&#x27;s henchmen holding the Stacys at gunpoint. Though the Kingpin fled, and Winkler was apparently killed, the Stacys were rescued. Osborn&#x27;s testimony to the police exonerated Captain Stacy.

Captain Stacy started to suspect Peter and Spider-Man were the same person. After a feverish Peter admitted to being Spider-Man before his friends including Captain Stacy, Parker asked the Prowler to imitate Spider-Man so Peter and Spider-Man could be seen together, however, Captain Stacy could not be fooled. Later, Stacy sacrifices himself to save civilians during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus.

George Stacy has largely remained dead since. He was resurrected in a clone body in &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot;, but later died from the Carrion virus.

<doc id="1321906" wikidata="Q2075576" url="?curid=1321906" title="Massachusetts State Police">
<text>The Massachusetts State Police (MSP) is an agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts&#x27; Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, responsible for law enforcement and vehicle regulation across the state. As of 2024, it has 2,500 sworn troopers and 611 civilian support staff for a total of 3,111 personnel, making it the largest law enforcement agency in New England. The MSP is headed by Colonel Geoffrey Noble, the first colonel to not come from State Police ranks.

==History==
The MSP was established by Massachusetts state governor John A. Andrew when he signed a law creating the State Constabulary on May 16, 1865. This legislative act to &quot;establish a State Police Force&quot; founded the first statewide enforcement agency in the nation. The first leader of the State Police was William Sterling King, an American officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. The agency remained small and rather informal until 1921, when the MSP was enlarged to comprise 50 officers stationed in barracks across the state with the primary mission of providing law enforcement to rural areas underserved by existing local police agencies. This law enforcement mission was performed by the trooper on horseback, usually, and in motor cars in areas with upgraded roads. The MSP enlarged its mission to handle primary vehicular regulation on the Commonwealth&#x27;s interstate and limited-access highways after their development mid-century; during this period, it also established a presence in protecting Logan International Airport.

For much of the 20th century, the MSP was organized along military lines with a heavy emphasis on the role of the barracks, spartan working conditions, and a uniformity in appearance and internal culture. Until recently, the MSP maintained one of the strictest regimens for physical size requirements for applicants. Efforts are being made presently to render the department more racially diverse, as well as more inclusive of women and LGBT troopers.

Since its inception, 47 officers from the Massachusetts State Police and its former agencies which made up its ranks have been killed in the line of duty. The earliest death was in 1909 and the latest death was March 3, 2022.

In November 2019, Superintendent Gilpin announced her retirement as colonel of the Massachusetts State police after two years in the position.

===Firearms===
During the 1960s and 1970s, the MSP issued the Walther PPK as a special assignment weapon.

During the 1980s, the .357 Magnum Smith &amp; Wesson Model 65 was issued to the troopers. Different weapons were issued for off-duty and special assignments. Prior to 1986, they were issued two Smith &amp; Wesson Model 65 revolvers, one with a 4 inch barrel for on duty wear, and one with a 3 inch barrel for off duty wear, they were required to wear a 3 inch barreled revolver even if they were at the beach in a bathing suit. They were required at the time to carry two weapons at all times, because they were considered one duty 24/7. From 1986 and on, the new off duty weapon was the .38 Special Smith &amp; Wesson Bodyguard revolver. 

The agency issued the SIG Sauer P226 in 9mm from the early 1990s, followed by the SIG Sauer P226 DAK (Double Action Kellerman) in .40 S&amp;W.

In 2011, troopers started carrying the Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P pistol in .45 ACP.

As of 2023, the MSP is replacing the .45 ACP handguns with the SIG Sauer P320 chambered in 9mm. The P320 comes equipped with a Romeo1 red-dot optic and a Night Stick 550XL flashlight attached. The P320 is also set on the X-Series frame.

===Museum===
The history of the agency is preserved at the Massachusetts State Police Museum and Learning Center in Whitinsville. The museum was made possible by private donations from MSP troopers and employees. The museum, originally intended to be located at the site of the former Troop C2 barracks, was relocated to a building in Whitinsville after a fire damaged a portion of the old barracks building in 2017. Exhibits at the museum include:

* Restored 1931, 1941, 1951, 1978 Ford cruisers
* Motorcycles, including a 1951 Indian
* State Police weapons (past &amp; present)
* Historical uniforms, hats and artifacts
* Harvard riot photos and riot equipment
* Mounted police equipment and other equine related items
* Original teletype machine
* The first computer and Mobile Data Terminals used by the MSP
* Historic daily station logs
* President John F. Kennedy photos and memorabilia
* Nostalgic badges and patches

==Consolidation of state-controlled police agencies==
In 1992, the former Massachusetts Department of Public Safety – Division of State Police, Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles Police, Massachusetts Capitol Police, and Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) Police (commonly known as the Metropolitan Police) departments merged to form what is currently known as the Department of State Police (an agency within the Executive Office of Public Safety, which is different from the Department of Public Safety). The four former agencies officially ceased to exist on July 1, 1992. The distinctive uniform and seal of the former Division of State Police would be retained by the newly formed Department of State Police. The ranks of corporal and staff sergeant were not carried over into the new agency. The Massachusetts Environmental Police remained a separate entity under the Department of Fisheries, Wildlife, and Environmental Law Enforcement, and later became a separate department-level office under the re-organised Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs. In the early part of the 2000s the MBTA Police discussed a possible merger but it will most likely not happen due to high costs and standards for both recruitment and training.

==Rank structure==
The Massachusetts State Police rank structure is as listed:
Promotion to the ranks of Sergeant, Lieutenant, and Captain is based on varying combinations of years of service, promotional exam score, and/or performance on oral examination boards. The ranks of Detective Lieutenant and Detective Captain are appointed; an individual must already have attained the rank of Lieutenant prior to being appointed to the rank of Detective Lieutenant and must have attained the rank of Captain prior to being appointed to the rank of Detective Captain.

The ranks of Major and Lieutenant Colonel are appointed by the Colonel/Superintendent. The Deputy Superintendent holds the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. The Colonel/Superintendent is appointed by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

==Division of Investigative Services==

===Detective units===
The Commonwealth is divided into 11 State Police detective units that work out of various district attorneys&#x27; offices. Boston, Springfield, and Worcester are the only cities in the Commonwealth that have the authority to investigate homicides. This responsibility is granted through the District Attorney&#x27;s Office in each city&#x27;s respective county. According to Massachusetts General Law, all homicides are under the control of the District Attorney in the county they occur. Only the District Attorney can delegate the responsibility of investigating homicides to another party. In Springfield and Worcester, it is the captain in charge of the Detective Bureau, and in Boston, it is the commander of the Homicide Unit. The various district attorneys&#x27; offices investigate all other homicides in any other cities or towns. The detective units also investigate many other major crimes and serious incidents.
===Attorney General&#x27;s Office===
The detective unit in the Attorney General&#x27;s office is composed of the drug unit, the computer crimes unit, and various other specialized investigative squads. The unit investigates everything from white-collar crime to drug distribution.

===Violent Fugitive Apprehension Section===
The VFAS is tasked with apprehending the commonwealth&#x27;s most violent and elusive fugitives. The unit works with various local and federal agencies and is part of numerous task forces.

===Gang Unit===
The Gang Unit is a statewide specialty unit established to: suppress criminal gang activity, investigate gang related crimes, and gather intelligence on known and suspected gang members. Gang Unit duties include street-level narcotics enforcement, weapons enforcement, criminal investigation, and special operations. The Gang Unit assists local cities and towns by conducting undercover narcotics operations and by providing additional officers to patrols dedicated to combating gang activity in high crime areas. In addition to these activities, the Gang Unit also provides local police departments with personnel, intelligence, expertise, and training specific to battling gang-related crime. The Gang Unit maintains partnerships with, and provides gang awareness training to, schools, corporations, social service agencies, probation officers, trial courts, District Attorneys&#x27; offices, and civilian groups. The Gang Unit&#x27;s primary objective is to improve the quality of life of all citizens adversely affected by gang activity.

===Fire and Explosion Investigation Section===
Specially trained Massachusetts State Police detectives have functioned as State Fire Marshal investigators for more than fifty years. At present, the Fire &amp; Explosion Investigative Section (F&amp;EIS) consists of thirty-eight full-time members who make up the Fire Investigations and Hazardous Devices (Bomb Squad) units. F&amp;EIS also consists of eight bomb techs, five bomb dogs and five accelerant detector dogs. Each unit has its own self-contained command and control structure and a specific jurisdiction to serve. Many of the investigators have been cross-trained to assist the other sections in time of need.

===Crime Lab===
The main Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab is located in Maynard. There are several laboratory substations spread throughout the Commonwealth. The lab serves law enforcement agencies and District Attorneys throughout the Commonwealth, providing a wide array of support to facilitate effective investigations and criminal prosecutions. The Crime Lab examines evidence that can be used to help tie criminals to their crimes, victims to their assailants and exonerate innocent suspects. The Ballistics Section and Crime Scene Services Section are served by sworn personnel.

The lab is broken up into sections and units:
== Division of Homeland Security &amp; Preparedness ==
This division was formed in 2017 and oversees the Commonwealth Fusion Center and the Preparedness and Planning Section, which contains a new Watch Center that is open 24 hours a day. The fusion center&#x27;s job is to collect and analyze intelligence relating to terrorism and criminal activity which is then shared among other law enforcement agencies. The Fusion Center is based in Maynard, Massachusetts and is overseen by a Major.

The Preparedness and Planning section oversees security planning for major Massachusetts events such as the Boston Marathon and Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular among others. It is also responsible for response planning to critical incidents and natural disasters. It is located at State Police Headquarters in Framingham and is overseen by a Major.

==Division of Standards &amp; Training==

Recruit and in-service training for the Massachusetts State Police takes place at the MSP academy located centrally in Massachusetts at 340 West Brookfield Road in New Braintree. Prior to the 1992 merger, the Division of State Police&#x27;s Training Academy was located in Framingham. This facility now houses the Department of State Police General Headquarters.

Becoming a trooper is a competitive process. Approximately 14,000 men and women took the written entrance exam in June 2002. Out of that, only a few hundred were selected to become members of the MSP. After receiving a conditional job offer, the recruit has to make it through 24 weeks of paramilitary training as part of a Recruit Training Troop (RTT). As of April 2009, the State Police no longer administers its own standalone examination for appointment to the department. The State Police now generates a prospective list from candidates that take the Massachusetts Police Officer Civil Service examination who elect to be considered for appointment to the State Police; this is the same examination that is used by many municipal departments and the MBTA. The Environmental Police administer their own civil service examination. 

On October 17, 2011, the 80th RTT began training. This was the first class in over five years. During the 24 weeks of training the recruit lives at the academy Monday through Friday. The 80th RTT class began with 250 trainees, adding 25 trainees in the first two weeks of training as others departed the program. Their day starts at 5:30 a.m. and goes until 8 p.m. with lights out around 9:30. The recruits attend over 98 academic classes and must pass 10 cumulative exams with a passing score of 70%. Along with classes, recruits have to take part in daily physical regimens such as running and weightlifting. The 80th RTT graduated a record 208 new troopers on March 9, 2012.

The academy takes a toll both mentally and physically on the recruit, and many recruits do not make it through. The typical academy washout rate is around 28-30%. For example, when the 77th RTT started in November 2004, there were 180 recruits. During the first week, 44 recruits dropped out and 34 new recruits had to be added in. By the end of the then 26 weeks, only 137 graduated.

As of the 83rd RTT, there is no more back-filling the academy class. The 83rd RTT began with 247 troops and expected to graduate around 175 in January 2018.

The academy also hosts the biannual Massachusetts State Police Student Trooper Program. The Student Trooper program is an intensive, one-week, residential learning experience for young adults, ages 15–17.

==Demographics==
As of June 2000, the Massachusetts State Police had the following demographics:
* Male: 91%
* Female: 9%
* White: 89%
* African-American/Black: 11%

The MSP is one of the few State Police Departments in the US where the percentage of African American officers (11%) is significantly greater than that of the state population (6.97%).

==Compensation==
As of 2017, the Massachusetts State Police average pay for a state trooper was $145,413, with three troopers earning over $300,000, and 245 troopers (12% of the workforce) earning over $200,000. A trooper&#x27;s base pay is augmented by working multiple details, directing traffic, overtime shifts, or providing security at special events.

Former Massachusetts inspector general Greg Sullivan criticized state police overtime as excessive, pointing out an unusual number of troopers who earned more in 2017 than the governor of the state. He cited the use of state police instead of civilian employees to direct traffic at construction details and Logan Airport as examples of wasteful spending. Sullivan argued that the reason overtime pay is so large is that the troopers who make overtime assignments also partake of the benefits of overtime, leaving no incentive to reduce the practice. In 2017, 24 troopers earned more than $100,000 in overtime, and 20 in Troop F earned more than $250,000, a fact which was not revealed until missing payroll records were noticed by the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;.

===Perks and extra benefits===
Along with their base salary and overtime, troopers have other benefits to include:
* Troopers receive hazard bonus pay of $700 annually.
* Troopers who commute 75 miles or more in one way travel from home receive $75 each week.
* State police employees who work in civilian clothing for 10 days or more each calendar month receive a stipend of $62.50 per month.
* State police employees who work a five-day workweek are compensated an extra 17 days off per year. This time off is to align with employees who work four days on duty, then get two days off.

=== State Police Academy hazing scandals ===
In September 2005, an investigation was begun after allegations of illegal hazing at the State Police Training Academy were brought to light. A recruit who voluntarily dropped out the academy accused the academy staff of water boarding her by placing her head in a toilet bowl. The investigation found that the recruit was told to inspect the toilet bowl after doing an inadequate job of cleaning the toilet. As a result of the investigation, with pressure from then governor Mitt Romney, three troopers were removed from their positions, including the Academy Commandant, Lt. Richard Lane. Other demoted instructors included Trooper Eric Baldwin. The 78th Recruit Training Troop graduated in December 2005.

In 2022, staff were reassigned after recruits got blisters from doing an unauthorized exercise involving bear crawls on hot pavement. In 2023, an unusually high number of recruits, 46%, dropped out within the first two weeks, with some complaining of hazing.

On September 13, 2024, trainee Enrique Delgado-Garcia died after suffering knocked-out teeth, a skull injury, and a broken neck; his body was covered in bruises. State police said the injuries occurred during a boxing training exercise, which they have suspended; the Division of Standards and Training was tasked with reviewing academy training programs. Delgado-Garcia was sworn in as an officer before he died. The class&#x27;s graduation was met with protesters demanding a faster and more transparent investigation into his death. Because Delgado-Garcia had worked in the Worcester District Attorney&#x27;s office as a victim witness advocate, a private trial lawyer, David Meier, was appointed to perform the investigation.

Delgado-Garcia had complained to a friend that the academy was &quot;torture&quot;. Another recruit that year complained of mental abuse going beyond what is needed for training, including bullying and racist remarks.

=== Sgt. Brian O&#x27;Hare scandal ===
In February 2006, a respected state police sergeant, Brian O&#x27;Hare, was arrested by the FBI after soliciting what he thought was an underage boy for sex, who was actually an undercover FBI Agent. O&#x27;Hare was discharged from the state police and subsequently sentenced to 5 years in federal prison.

=== Allegations of internal racial discrimination ===
In March 2017 the Boston Globe reported on allegations of discrimination within the State Police against minority state troopers.

=== Alli Bibaud scandal ===
In October 2017, a state police arrest report of a judge&#x27;s daughter, Alli Bibaud, was changed to remove an embarrassing and incriminating statement (&quot;Do You Know How Many People I Had To Blow To Get That,&quot;) concerning how she obtained the heroin she allegedly possessed. An online news article, written by Aidan Kearney for Turtleboy Sports, listing &quot;many&quot; troopers as sources, allege that the report was changed due to Dudley District Court Judge Tim Bibaud calling District Attorney Joseph Early and Colonel Richard McKeon, who in turn directed Major Susan Anderson to have the statement removed. On November 7, 2017, the trooper who was ordered to change his report, Ryan Sceviour, sued the leadership of the state police for reversal of the discipline he received for including the embarrassing and incriminating statements in his report, as well as an official apology, lawyers fees, and punitive damages. On November 11, 2017, Colonel Richard McKeon retired in the midst of the scandal.

=== Leigha Genduso scandal ===
In February 2018, Aidan Kearney, a journalist for the online news site Turtleboy Sports, broke a story that Trooper Leigha Genduso, who was assigned to the K-9 unit, was hired by the state police in spite of testifying during grand jury proceedings targeting her former boyfriend, before her hire as first a civilian dispatcher and then state trooper, that she smoked marijuana daily, sold marijuana in amounts up to 10 pounds at a time, took various other prescription drugs not prescribed to her, and laundered money from her former boyfriend&#x27;s drug profits. There was also information from &quot;many sources&quot; that Genduso&#x27;s boyfriend at the time of her hire, then-Major (eventually Lieutenant Colonel) Daniel Risteen, used his influence to gain her favorable treatment and highly desirable assignments usually only offered to troopers with many years seniority.

On February 23, 2018, Lieutenant Colonel Risteen abruptly retired from the state police.

On Friday, August 24, 2018 Leigha Genduso resigned from the Massachusetts State Police.

===Overtime theft probe===
On March 20, 2018, Attorney General Maura Healey announced that her office was reviewing the &quot;apparent discrepancies between overtime paid and actual patrols worked,&quot; by 21 state troopers of the Troop E division. Of the 21 state troopers, 19 are active, one retired last year, and another, Trooper Matthew Sheehan, was already suspended due to racist messages he posted online. Colonel Kerry Gilpin addressed the media and said one of the alleged offenders put in for as many as 100 no-show shifts during 2016.

On April 2, 2018, governor Baker announced the elimination of Troop E due to the ongoing overtime investigation that found dozens of active and former troopers allegedly putting in for overtime shifts for which they did not work. State Police Colonel Kerry Gilpin also announced that location of State Police cruisers will be tracked by Global Positioning System (GPS) technology known as automatic vehicle Locator technology, and the state police will also develop a body camera program.

On June 27, 2018, the Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrested three Massachusetts state troopers for allegedly stealing thousands of dollars for overtime work they didn&#x27;t complete in calendar year 2016. The troopers allegedly took steps to conceal their fraud by altering tickets written to make it look like the citations were issued during claimed overtime shifts. Sometimes tickets submitted by the troopers were fictitious or never actually issued to known motorists. Each of the three troopers were charged with a single embezzlement count.

===Hidden payroll data===
On March 26, 2018. the Boston Globe reported that payroll records for the 140-trooper Massachusetts State Police Troop F, which provides law enforcement and security for all properties of the Massachusetts Port Authority, have been hidden from public view and weren&#x27;t filed with the state comptroller for several years. Almost 80 percent of the troopers assigned to Troop F earned more than Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker. Pay for the troopers comes from the Massachusetts Port Authority, but the police troopers are employees of the Massachusetts State Police and operations are overseen by commanders of the State Police.

After the Boston Globe report came out, governor Baker said that the act of not disclosing years of payroll records for Troop F of the State Police was &quot;clearly deliberate,&quot; and state Comptroller Thomas Shack demanded to know if other state agencies were failing to reveal other payroll records.

On March 30, 2018, the Globe reported a Troop F Detective Lieutenant earned more than $300,000 each year between 2015 and 2017. The Lieutenant was the highest paid employee of the Massachusetts State Police for the years 2014 - 2016.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Mystery Street&quot; (1950) features Ricardo Montalbán as MSP Detective Lieutenant Peter Moralas, assigned to the Barnstable County District Attorney&#x27;s Office, investigating the death of a young woman whose skeleton is found buried in a Cape Cod beach. He seeks assistance from the Department of Legal Medicine at Harvard University.
* &quot;The Departed&quot; (2006) is about two spies in the MSP&#x27;s Special Investigations Unit, with Staff Sergeant Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) being planted on the MSP as a spy for Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), an Irish Mob boss, while Trooper Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an undercover cop assigned to infiltrate Costello&#x27;s crew. Director Martin Scorsese asked the MSP if he could use actual logos, badges, and color schemes on the uniforms and the cruisers, but was denied.
* Ben Benson&#x27;s series of novels featuring Massachusetts State Troopers such as high ranking Chief of Detectives Wade Paris and rookie Trooper Ralph Lindsey, appearing mostly in the 1950s, were among the earliest examples of police procedurals. When Benson died, another writer, Roy Stratton (the great-grandson-in-law of Charles Dickens) started a new series about the MSP for the same publisher, Mill-Morrow, featuring Trooper Scott Gregory; but the series ended after only two books.
* The agency serves as a partial-setting for Dennis Lehane&#x27;s novel &quot;Mystic River&quot; and its film version, in which the characters played by Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne are MSP detectives.
* The Robert B. Parker character Spenser is said to have been with the MSP, specifically as a detective with the Suffolk County District Attorney&#x27;s office. He frequently interacts with an MSP homicide detective named Captain Healy (who also appears in the Jesse Stone novels) and worked with an MSP trooper named Brian Lundquist in the novel &quot;Pale Kings and Princes&quot;.
* An MSP cruiser comes to a halt at the Wordloaf Conference in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Moe&#x27;N&#x27;a Lisa&quot;, having pursued the Simpsons into Vermont (minute 11:50 in the episode).
* Norman Rockwell&#x27;s famous painting &quot;The Runaway&quot; depicts a Massachusetts State Trooper and a young boy at a lunch counter. Rockwell lived in Massachusetts for much of his life. Actual MSP Trooper Dick Clemens is the Trooper portrayed in the painting. The boy&#x27;s name is Edward Locke.
* In &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;, Ray Winstone&#x27;s character is killed by a Massachusetts State Trooper.
* In &quot;R.I.P.D.&quot;, an MSP Air Wing helicopter takes part in the raid where Ryan Reynolds&#x27; character is killed.
* In &quot;Patriots Day&quot;, an MSP trooper stands guard over Martin Richard&#x27;s corpse until he can be taken away by ambulance, at which point he salutes. Other troopers appear sporadically throughout the film, and the Superintendent at the time Colonel Timothy Alben is a character in it portrayed by Charles Luise but is simply credited as &quot;Massachusetts State Police Colonel.&quot;
* The Showtime original series &quot;City on a Hill&quot; features multiple MSP troopers assigned to the Suffolk County DA&#x27;s Office.

<doc id="1321909" wikidata="Q5460144" url="?curid=1321909" title="Flook (comic strip)">
<text>Flook was a British comic strip which ran from 1949 to 1984 in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper. It was drawn by Wally Fawkes (of the jazz group Wally Fawkes and the Troglodytes), who signed the strips as &quot;Trog&quot;.

It was the first newspaper comic strip to be published by the New Zealand newspaper &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot;, where it ran from 1952 to 1979. In North America, the strip was syndicated via the General Features Corporation to newspapers between 10 September 1951 and 15 October 1954, at which point the last paper to run it, the Vancouver &quot;Province&quot;, discontinued it mid-story.

==Characters and story==
The central characters were a young boy called Rufus and his magical animal friend, Flook. According to the strip &#x27;The Coming of Flook&#x27;, which forms part of the cartoon book &quot;Rufus and Flook v. Moses Maggot&quot;, we learn that Flook, who vaguely resembled a furry pig walking on his hind legs, was a creature from the age of the dinosaurs whom Rufus, in a dream, rescued from cavemen and who then came back to waking reality with him. Flook was able to talk (in seven languages) and had a fine sense of irony with which to temper Rufus&#x27; innocence and enthusiasm. He was also able to change shape into all manner of objects, though not much was made of this power after the first couple of years of the strip. They inhabited a satirical and socially perceptive fantasy world not unrelated to contemporary Great Britain, populated by larger-than-life characters, mostly bearing a striking resemblance to leading politicians and celebrities. Many of their adventures starred their principal adversaries, the villainous Moses Maggot (who, for the purposes of North American syndication, was renamed Mossy Mildew) and his sidekick, the gaolbird Douglas Bodger, whose sister – the overweight teenage witch Lucretia Bodger (a play on Lucretia Borgia), with her cat, Gobstopper – also appeared quite frequently, as did a mad retired colonel.

==Scripts==
The strip was initially written by Douglas Mount, a &quot;Daily Mail&quot; employee. Mount left the &quot;Mail&quot; with little warning and subsequently the strip&#x27;s authorship was taken up by the Australian journalist Robert Raymond. In his memoir &quot;Giving Luck a Chance&quot;, Raymond describes the way in which Fawkes brought him on board as &quot;Flook&quot;&#x27;s author in 1949. Fawkes invited Raymond into his office, where he was being harassed by telephone calls from the production team for the latest daily instalment of the strip. Raymond himself was unemployed at the time:

&#x27;Ever written the script for a strip?&#x27; Wally enquired casually.

&#x27;Can&#x27;t say I have.&#x27;

&#x27;Want to have a go? It pays quite well. Seven guineas a week, probably.&#x27;

He immediately had all my attention.

I tried to think of all the strips I had ever read. I knew that if I got the Mail out of this jam the scriptwriting job was mine. I paced up and down a few times.

&#x27;Right! Here&#x27;s what we do. The old boy says: Make yourselves at home while I&#x27;m away, boys, but - &#x27;

The phone rang again.

&#x27;Leave the receiver off&#x27;, said Wally, glancing at the clock and starting to letter the caption in the balloon. &#x27;But what?&#x27;

&#x27;-BUT STAY OUT OF THE EAST WING!&#x27;

&#x27;Great!&#x27; said Wally, lettering rapidly. &#x27;What&#x27;s in the East Wing?&#x27;

&#x27;I haven&#x27;t any idea,&#x27; I said, &#x27;but give me a day or so and I&#x27;ll think of something&#x27;. 

Following Raymond&#x27;s departure in 1953, authors were Compton Mackenzie, singer and writer George Melly, the comedian Barry Took, the musician Humphrey Lyttelton and the film critic Barry Norman. Several book-length episodes and compilations were published, and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; also marketed a Flook toy.

The ironic and bohemian ethos that the strip came to develop was notably at variance with the conservatism of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, which finally discontinued it after some 10,000 episodes, reportedly because the editor, David English, objected to its repeated jabs at the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher (though she is said to have enjoyed it), and the strip&#x27;s covert criticism of the &quot;Mail&quot;″s championing of the cause of Zola Budd. After it was dropped by the &quot;Mail&quot;, &quot;Flook&quot; scripted by Keith Waterhouse (shortly before he moved to the &quot;Mail&quot;) ran in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; starting in 19 November 1984 until 15 November 1985 before switching to the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;.

Flook was adopted as a mascot by 831 Squadron, Fleet Air Arm, and the character was painted on the squadron aircraft.

<doc id="1321931" wikidata="Q7618543" url="?curid=1321931" title="Stokes Valley">
<text>Stokes Valley, a major suburb of the city of Lower Hutt in the North Island of New Zealand, lies at the edge of the city, seven kilometres northeast of the city centre. It occupies the valley of a small tributary of the Hutt River, called Stokes Valley Stream, which flows north to meet the main river close to the Taitā Gorge. Stokes Valley takes its name from Robert Stokes, who formed part of the original survey team of 1840 commissioned to plan the city at Thorndon in Wellington.

Stokes Valley comprises a suburb in its own valley, physically separated from the rest of Lower Hutt. It is surrounded on all sides by densely forested hills.

Its cultural identity, very similar to that of the rest of Lower Hutt, has progressed [some would jokingly disagree] a long way from the &quot;congregation of old shellbacks and whalers, men-o&#x27;-wars men and seamen, lags and hard cases, living in tents and whares ... [a] heterogeneous mass of misguided humanity&quot; reported in 1855.

==Geology and early history==
It has been suggested that the valley was formed during the ice age 10,000–20,000 years ago by glacial scouring, but considering that the Hutt Valley and the greater Wellington area have experienced major tectonic uplifting it is possible that the valley was formed through major earthquakes and erosion.

According to tradition, Māori arrived in the Hutt Valley in about 1250 AD when the two sons of Whatonga, a Hawke&#x27;s Bay chief, settled in the area and named the Hutt River &quot;Heretaunga&quot;, after their old home. Although Māori had lived in the Hutt Valley for almost 600 years prior to Europeans, there has been no evidence of Māori habitation in Stokes Valley and the closest iwi (tribe), located at Waiwhetū, say they never used the valley for any significant purpose before Europeans arrived. Stokes Valley was located at the junction of the claimed territory of three major Māori tribes, the Te Āti Awa who sold it to European settlers, Ngāti Toa, and the Ngāti Kahungunu, and for this reason it would have in all likelihood never have been inhabited. This partially explains an extreme willingness to include this land in the sale to the early settlers.

==Modern history==
The modern history of the area, as far as European settlement is concerned, began on 21 September 1839, when local Te Āti Awa chief Te Puni gestured with his arms and pointed finger the areas of the Hutt Valley and Wellington, that he was willing to sell to the New Zealand Land Company through its agent Colonel William Wakefield aboard the ship &quot;Tory&quot;. Stokes Valley, which at that time was simply an unnamed branch valley of the Hutt Valley, was included in this land.

The second of the New Zealand Company&#x27;s ships to arrive in Wellington was the 273-ton &quot;Cuba&quot; on 3 January 1840. It had on board 20 able-bodied men aged from 20 to 27. Among these was the Company&#x27;s surveying party, whose duty was to plan the city at Thorndon and survey the site in readiness for the arrival of the emigrants who already procured sections in London. The first emigrant ship, containing 85 adult settlers and their 42 children, arrived only 17 days later. At this stage there was no sections or shelters surveyed for most of the people, and many had to live in huts built by the Māori, or simply shelter under karaka trees. The Wellington and Hutt Valley area was hurriedly surveyed.

The original survey party that arrived in 1840 on the &quot;Cuba&quot; comprised Captain William Mein Smith (Surveyor General) and Messrs. R. D. Hanson, W. Carrington, R. Park, R. Stokes, and K. Bethune, all well known personalities in the early history of Wellington. Robert Stokes, after whom the valley was named, was initially active surveying a &#x27;valley east of the valley of the Hutt&#x27; from 30 March to 2 April 1841, resuming the following 14 October for a few more days, highly probably referring to the area first named as Stokes Valley in a plan of January 1843. Stokes left the employ of the New Zealand Company in early 1842 and went into business for himself. Stokes Street in Wellington was named in his honour in the 1841 map of Wellington.

Robert Stokes took a prominent part in Wellington affairs, including government. He published a work in 1844 on the Wairau Affray, led the first European crossing of the Rimutaka range to the Wairarapa, built a once-famous house in Wellington, &quot;Saint Ruadhan&quot;, on Woolcombe Street (since demolished; the site now forms part of The Terrace). He was a keen gardener, known for his prize-winning vegetables and flowers, and was also a keen botanist, and was treasurer of the Horticultural and Botanical Society. He became a publisher and printer, his name appearing on &quot;The New Zealand Spectator and Cook&#x27;s Strait Guardian&quot; as a printer He was a prominent speaker, and was instrumental in carrying a Bill to establish a municipal corporation for Wellington and a railway link to the Wairarapa. Stokes stood as an elected member of the Wairarapa Council in 1867, and was a Member of the Victoria University of Wellington Senate from 1871 to 1878. Stokes died at Clanricarde Gardens, London, on 20 January 1880.

===Crown Grants===
The first Crown Land Grants in Stokes Valley were made from 18 January 1853. Section 74 was granted to Robert Henry Wood and Section 73 to George Hart. Wood never settled in the valley, even though he received another land grant of section 67. There is no known evidence that he ever left England, and it was common to have absentee ownership of Crown grants in those days, but it is known that he served on the Committee of the First Colony formed in London. Hart who was born in London, also never settled in the valley, but he did leave England after receiving the land grant, arriving on the ship &quot;Mary&quot; in 1843. In 1863 he was appointed Commissioner of Thorndon for the Thorndon Ward of the Wellington Town Board. The first person to actually settle in Stokes Valley after the making of Crown Grants was Mr. Hart Udy who immediately set up a saw mill on his property at the entrance to the Valley on the north East side of the main road. His property was plot or Section 65 of the original Crown land grant.

===Early settlement===
Mr. William Judd Sr. was known as the first resident of Stokes Valley. Judd arrived at Port Nicholson on the ship &quot;Martha Ridgway&quot; in July 1840 along with his wife Anne and their sons John, George, and Stephen. The Judds initially lived at Lower Hutt after arriving, but after the birth of his fourth son and upon securing a contract to make a road through the Taitā Gorge, Judd moved with his family to the entrance of Stokes Valley. He constructed a home on a leasehold title on the southern side of the present Stokes Valley main road. The exact date of his move to the valley is unknown, but his name is listed in the &quot;Memorial of the Settlers of Wellington and the Neighbouring Districts...&quot; published in the local newspaper of the time in April 1852. His house was recorded as severely damaged in the earthquake of 23 February 1855 and he most likely lived in the valley for several years before 1852. It was in this house that the last three members of his family were born. This possibly puts his settlement in the valley in the late 1840s.

George Spackman (a contender for first settler) was also known to reside in Stokes Valley as early as 3 April 1852 and is listed beside Mr Judd in the &quot;Memorial of the Settlers...&quot;. Spackman is listed on the 1854 Electoral Roll as a settler residing on a leasehold in Stokes Valley, Spackman arrived with his wife on the ship &quot;Bolton&quot; on 21 April 1840, and a son was born to them three months later. George Spackman paraded with the &quot;Old Identities&quot; who attended the capital&#x27;s Jubilee of Colonisation in 1890.

Mr. Hart Udy, after whom Udy Street in Petone is named, was born in Cornwall in 1808. In 1839 he left England for New Zealand with his wife and family on the New Zealand Company&#x27;s ship &quot;Duke of Roxburgh&quot;, arriving in Petone in February 1840. Hart worked for Sir Francis Molesworth on the building of the first cutter and house to be built from New Zealand timber. After working for three years in Wellington as a shipwright at the stream near Staples Brewery he moved to Waiwhetū (now a suburb of Lower Hutt), where he worked as a carpenter for many years. On 1 March 1845 his house was pillaged by local Mãori. In 1849 he built the first Anglican church in Lower Hutt near the Hutt Bridge . On 24 May 1852 Mr Hart Udy by mutual consent dissolved a Saw Milling partnership which he had with William Corbett and Richard Blake that was based in Stokes Valley, so it is assumed he had worked in the valley for a significant time before then. He moved to Stokes Valley in 1853, and resided there until 1857, when he took his family to Matarawa where he had access to valuable bush-clad land. A source says that Udy set up a sawmill at the valley mouth in 1858, but it doesn&#x27;t make it clear whether this was the original one he dissolved in 1852 that he reactivated or an additional one.
He carried on the family sawmilling business until 1865, when he retired leaving it to his sons. Mr Hart Udy Jr., who was five years old when his parents arrived in 1840, married Elizabeth Holland of Petone in 1855, their first home being in Stokes Valley. He was also involved in his father&#x27;s sawmilling business and moved with him to Matarawa. Mr Hart Jr. later became Mayor of the Borough of Greytown. Mr Hart Udy Sr died on 27 November 1890 in Greytown aged 82 from complications from a bone he had accidentally swallowed, he had 90 direct descendants, and was Justice of the peace of Greytown &amp; greatly missed.

For a long time many made their living by felling timber, splitting posts and rails, and timber production as the valley had a large amount of native bush, including birch, rimu, rātā, tōtara, and white pine. The bush was populated with a considerable amount of wildlife, including weka, California quail, and wild pigs. Once the bush was largely cleared, it was found that the valley&#x27;s soil had little to offer for farm production and for a time Stokes Valley was known as &quot;Starvation Valley&quot; owing to the difficult times that many of the early settlers had in making a living in the remote valley. Their problems were not helped by floods, drought and snow storms. The Hutt Valley area experienced a major flood in the 1870s which caused considerable damage to the lower portion of Stokes Valley and swept away a large amount of cut timber.

The first recorded marriages in the valley were in 1865. On 5 June Thomas Sparks was married to Mary Ann Robinson (both residents of Stokes Valley) at the Primitive Methodist Church by Rev. Waters. Two further marriages are recorded from October, with the marriage of Isaac Sykes to Maria Ann Wyeth of Upper Hutt at St James&#x27; Church at Lower Hutt on 8 October, and the marriage of Stokes Valley farmer John Walker to Mary Brown of Kapiti, at the Anglican Church in Upper Hutt, by the Rev. Mr Abrahams on 26 October.

Other early incidents in Stokes Valley include the invention and patenting of an improved milk churn, by Ignatius Singer in 1900, and two local tragedies. The first of these occurred on 10 December 1883, when an elderly woman named Hamlin was shot at by a youth. There was no shot loaded in the gun, but gunpowder lodged in her left arm above the wrist. Hamlin died during an operation to amputate the arm. Another account of this same incident claims it occurred in 1885 and that the woman was called Hamblin. According to this account the youth (Sinnox) was a friend and popped in to demonstrate his newly acquired shotgun after hunting rabbits. The gun accidentally discharged, and Mrs. Hamblin was hit in the shoulder. A doctor was summoned, but when he arrived he ordered her to be taken to hospital because of loss of blood. By the time Hamblin arrived at Wellington hospital she was unconscious through loss of blood, and she died later that night. This account makes no mention of an amputation, but goes into greater detail about the people involved.

The second local tragedy, on 1 April 1897, made headlines in newspapers around the country. Mrs. Annetta Hope was killed with her infant child, Annetta, and 20-year-old step daughter Lillian, when the horse and carriage they were riding in slipped down the Taitā (or Hutt) Gorge and into the Hutt River. Mrs. Hope had decided to meet her husband Joseph William Hope from the Silverstream railway station (now a train museum) after his work, but he did not arrive. She was halfway back to Stokes Valley at a steep part of the gorge when she saw the next train coming and made an attempt to turn the horse and carriage around to go back to meet it. It is thought that the horse took fright and as Mrs. Hope was not experienced at controlling a carriage it slipped down into the ravine. The bodies were found about one hour later, drowned in about four feet of water. The horse was none the worse for wear. The husband did not find out what had happened to her until the following Thursday when he read it in &quot;The Evening Post&quot;. It was later decided at an inquest that the road was dangerous and needed to be fenced as bicycles were frequently on the road and could frighten horses. (It is not known whether any bicycles were involved in the Hope tragedy).

=== Early 20th-century history ===
In 1927 a toll bridge was erected across the Hutt River to service the valley, but this was destroyed by a flood in 1932 and replaced by a foot bridge that was later deemed unsafe. Before 1940 the upper valley was heavily populated with holiday baches and enjoyed a resort status. During the Second World War, the United States Marine Corps established a base near the foot of the valley.

=== Natural disasters ===

==== 1855 Wellington earthquake ====

The Otago witness in 1899 recounts an interesting story of the reminiscences of one of the early inhabitants of the valley and the early characters (including the &quot;Rev.&quot; Udy) during the &quot;great&quot; Wellington earthquake (presumably 1855 and not 1848). This earthquake apparently lasted a long time and was exceedingly frightful for even the most hardened soul as the story below relates:

:...will never forget the big earthquake which shook hundreds of green pine trees out by the roots, split asunder rocks, tore up great rents in the ground, sent mighty slips down from mountains and hill, overturned houses and so twisted others that doors would neither open nor close, and several times threw Maoris canoeing over the Hutt River out into the waters.

:The day before the disturbance, I and my brothers were at work hewing wood in the bush; the earthquake, which came in the night, had uprooted hundreds of trees all around the spot of our previous day&#x27;s labour, and blocked up all the roads and tracks in the neighbourhood. Away over in Stokes&#x27;s Valley there was at that time a congregation of old shellbacks and whalers, men-o&#x27;-wars men and seamen, lags and hard cases, living in tents and whares but when the earthquake was in its worst throes and they found that it had come to stay sometime this heterogeneous mass of misguided humanity assembled with one accord, and under the guidance of the Rev. Mr Udy, a gentleman of the Wesleyan persuasion, prayed in the open air, harder than ever they blasphemed night and day, for deliverance.

==== 1976 slips and flooding ====

On 20 December 1976, extremely heavy rainfall struck the Hutt Valley and Wellington. This caused hundreds of slips and widespread flooding, and Pinehaven and Stokes Valley were declared disaster zones. At 10:30am on 20 December, a petrol station at the entrance to Stokes Valley was flooded to within of the top of the petrol pumps. Three houses in Ngahere Street were destroyed when they slipped down a hill. Five Stokes Valley residents were evacuated by a helicopter from the United States Coast Guard icebreaker &quot;Burton Island&quot; which happened to be in port at the time, and crew from the ship also helped dig out houses in Stokes Valley after the weather subsided. About 100 Hutt Valley people evacuated from their homes were given accommodation at the Epuni Boys Home.

==Alternative names and nicknames==
Stokes Valley was often referred in print as &quot;Stokes&#x27;s Valley&quot;.
Stokes Valley is sometimes referred to as Koraunui, a Māori name meaning &quot;big ferns&quot;, which is possibly a reference to the lush bush which once covered the entire valley and which still exists in some areas, especially on the hills surrounding Stokes Valley. It is not known whether local Māori ever used this name, but the minutes of a Hutt County Council meeting in 1926–27 provide the first recorded mention of this name. The minutes record an attempt to officially change the name of the valley to Koraunui, prompted by a request to do so from the Stokes Valley Progressive Association. The new name was accepted and moves to change the name were undertaken. A petition was submitted to the Department of Internal Affairs, awaiting the Ministers objection to a change of name. It was resolved to wait for the results of a postal ballot of ratepayers concerned before proceeding. It was finally decided not to change the name, though exactly why is unclear.

In 2005 the original Stokes Valley School, established over 100 years earlier, changed its name to Koraunui School, after its merger with Kamahi School. It was decided to change the school&#x27;s name as a sign of respect to Kamahi School (which closed after the merger on 28 January 2005), and because the new entity essentially became a new school, its roll approximately doubling overnight with the merger. the roll for Koraunui School is around 330 pupils. The name Koraunui is also used for the Koraunui Marae in Stokes Valley, the Koraunui Kindergarten in Stokes Valley Road, the Koraunui Sports Club, and the Koraunui Hall (which was a major event centre for Stokes Valley society functions, including mayoral dinners, and is used by clubs and for fundraising events).

Since the late 1990s Stokes Valley has been affectionately known by some locals (both past and present) and those living within the greater Wellington area as Snake Gully. The origin of this nickname is not known but is likely to relate to the 1940s radio series &#x27;Dad and Dave from Snake Gully&#x27; 

In common with several other New Zealand towns stereotypically seen as largely consisting of working-class people with little access to nightlife, Stokes Valley is now ironically referred to on many internet forums and discussion groups as Stokes Vegas. In keeping with this theme, the Stokes Valley Cosmopolitan Club has a gambling casino called &quot;Stokes Vegas Gaming Room&quot;

==Notable residents==
Brothers Neville and Dave Hiscock were both internationally famous motorcycle racers who lived in Stokes Valley. Dave Hiscock dominated the New Zealand racing scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s, winning 40 consecutive races. He won the New Zealand Castrol Six Hour race five times and was placed five times in the Australian Castrol Six Hour Race in the 1970s and 1980s.
His brother Neville Hiscock won the Australian Castrol Six Hour Race in 1981, and teamed with his brother to win the New Zealand Castrol Six Hour Race in 1982. Neville was killed in February 1983 while racing in Killarney, near Cape Town in South Africa. Dave retired from competitive racing shortly after this, and now lives in Australia. A recent mural that shows many historical elements of Stokes Valley life has been completed honouring the Hiscock brothers and mentioning how they both &quot;dominated motorcycle racing in the 1970s&quot;. It was instigated and commissioned by local resident Dennis O&#x27;Grady and is painted on the wall of his business. It is located in the car park facing the current New World supermarket in the Scott Court Shopping mall in Oates St. The mural shows a picture of Neville Hiscock racing one of his bikes.

Irene van Dyk the famous South African born New Zealand Netball player called Stokes Valley her home for at least 10 years from late 1990s to early 2000s. Irene van Dyk is recognised as the most capped international player of all time, and has won numerous titles for South Africa and then later New Zealand. She represented New Zealand for 14 years before retiring from international netball in June 2014. She has said that Stokes Valley is a wonderful place to live and raise a family. In an interview in 2002 she said &quot;It&#x27;s very beautiful, and we love how central it is to everything.  The neighbourhood kids are really nice and they play with [her daughter] a lot.&quot;

Notable artist Guy Ngan was a resident of Stokes Valley for over 50 years. Ngan, born to Chinese parents in 1926, produced a range of work across a large range of media, including sculpture, painting, drawing, design, and architecture. His sculpture &quot;Mating Worms&quot; at the entrance to Stokes Valley has become the de facto symbol of the Valley since its installation in 1980, appearing on such things as the logo of local newspapers and school reports. Ngan was director of the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts from 1976 to 1986. In 2006 a major retrospective of his work was held at the Wellington City Art Gallery. His sculpture &quot;Elevating Worms&quot; is in the Scott Court shopping mall, on the side facing Stokes Valley Road.

Darcy Nicholas, &quot;one of the best known of early contemporary Maori artists&quot;, also resides in Stokes Valley with his wife Anne.

Several notable sportspeople call Stokes Valley their home. These include three representative association footballers: Craig Henderson, who plays professionally for Mjällby AIF in Sweden; New Zealand international Cole Peverley; and Dan Keat, who has played with Dartmouth College and L.A Galaxy in the United States. All three have represented New Zealand at age-group level, with Peverley playing once for the national team (the All Whites) in 2008. Craig Bradshaw, New Zealand international basketball player, also grew up in Stokes Valley. Bradshaw represented the country as a member of the Tall Blacks during the 2004 Summer Olympics campaign and the 2006 FIBA World Championships.

Wellington Lion &amp; Hurricane, Brad Shields grew up in Stokes Valley.

Jack Gleeson, All Black coach in 1972 and from 1977 to 1978, owned the Stokes Valley tavern and the All Blacks practised at Delaney Park before the first test against the British and Irish Lions in June 1977.

<text>Riku Kiri (born April 5, 1963 in Kotka, Finland) is a Finnish former strongman and powerlifter, best known for competing in the World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition, narrowly missing out on capturing the title on more than one occasion. He has been referred to as: &quot;the strongest man never to win World&#x27;s Strongest Man.&quot;

Having competed in 25 International strongman competitions and winning 11 of them, Kiri is among the 20 most decorated strongmen of all time.

==Life and career==
The 1.94 m (6 ft 4 in), 145 kg (320 lb) Kiri is particularly noted for his static strength including a 300 kg (661.4 lb) single-arm deadlift and a 302.5 kg (666.9 lbs) raw bench press. He squatted 440 kg in the Dutch Open strongman contest of 1995 in a Smith machine apparatus. He also bench pressed 290.0 kg (639.3 lb) raw in an official WPC meet along with many other records. At 19 years old in 1983, Riku held a World Record in powerlifting in the squat lift in IPF competition, 350 kg (125 kg weight category).

In one of his first ever strongest man contests, he defeated reigning World&#x27;s Strongest Man winner Jón Páll Sigmarsson, in 1985.

For most of his appearances in World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition, Kiri has been hampered by ankle injuries. Although Kiri placed 3rd and 2nd respectively in 1993 and 1996, ankle injuries plagued him during both contests. In reference to the Car Carry event in 1993, Kiri&#x27;s coach, Markku Suonenvirta, famously said: &quot;His ankle is broken but he&#x27;s a tough guy.&quot; Kiri&#x27;s ankle was in fact not broken but badly injured and weakened. In the 1996 WSM final event (Power Stairs) Kiri was about to go head to head with Magnus Ver Magnusson. However, just after the starter&#x27;s whistle, Kiri dropped out due to another ankle injury. Kiri was also forced to drop out of the 1998 World&#x27;s Strongest Man final due to an ankle injury, finishing in 6th place.

His background is in security work, and he holds shares in Gold&#x27;s Gym-Helsinki.

<doc id="1321940" wikidata="Q6958111" url="?curid=1321940" title="Naenae">
<text>Naenae (, occasionally spelled NaeNae) is a suburb of Lower Hutt, New Zealand. It lies on the eastern edge of the floodplain of the Hutt River, four kilometres from the Lower Hutt Central business district. A small tributary of the Hutt, the Waiwhetū Stream, flows through the suburb. Naenae lies 19.7 km from Wellington Central.

== Toponymy ==
&quot;Naenae&quot; or &quot;nae-nae&quot; is a translation from the Māori, meaning &quot;mosquito&quot; or &quot;sandfly&quot;, and is widely believed to recall a time prior to the draining of the area, when the mosquito population predominated. The New Zealand Geographic Board authorised &quot;Naenae&quot; as a correct spelling in 1929. 

However, the name of the suburb &#x27;Naenae&#x27; is an incorrect recording by settler populations of the traditional Māori name &#x27;Te Ngaengae.&#x27; In fact, &#x27;Naenae’ is derived from &#x27;Te Ngaengae&#x27;, which means ‘to cause effect through rupture’. The story of Naenae begins with Māui raising the fish Hāhā-te-Whenua, and his brothers cutting the fish and creating mountains, lakes and rivers. There was a freshwater lake where Naenae cemetery is now. Two man-eating taniwha dwelled there, and people were banned from going into the water because they would disappear. One day a child slipped in and the two taniwha raced towards the child and tore each other apart. Thus two rivers were created: Waiwhetū and Te Awamutu. Taniwha are unexplained phenomena, not necessarily the large monsters they are often represented as. Te Ngaengae could be ‘a volcanic activity underwater’. Maui’s fish was called Hāhā-te-Whenua – a reference to plates shifting under the water.

== Setting ==
Naenae occupies a basin and the lower slopes of the Eastern Hutt Hills in the upper reaches of the Waiwhetū Stream catchment area.

=== Waiwhetū Stream ===
The stream has its headwaters in the Eastern Hutt hills, above the suburbs of Wingate and Naenae in Lower Hutt. It has a catchment area of around . The stream is around in length and passes through the eastern suburbs of Fairfield, Waterloo, and Waiwhetū, and the industrial areas of Seaview and Gracefield before entering the estuary of the Hutt River Te Awa Kairangi as it reaches Wellington Harbour.

== History ==
From the early days of European settlement, land in the area around Naenae and Taitā had been used for market gardens, and had supplied vegetables for the Wellington region.

As Lower Hutt expanded after the end of World War II in 1945, the Labour Party government under Peter Fraser selected Naenae as an ideal site to become a &quot;designer community&quot;, a model suburb of sorts, where a suburban state-housing estate would complement a substantial shopping centre. This community centre would serve as a social hub for the greater area. The planners hoped to encourage nuclear-family life in such a scheme. Due to the increasing urbanization of New Zealand, demand for housing outstripped the need for such centres, leaving the scheme only partially realised .

Ernst Plischke, an Austrian architect, designed plans for the new community centre between 1942 and 1943. However, government architect Gordon Wilson later drastically changed the design.

Naenae Railway Station (opened 1946), on the Hutt Valley section of the Wairarapa Line, adjoins Naenae&#x27;s shopping centre.

Naenae&#x27;s post-modern Post Office building, (officially opened in 1966, closed as a postal centre in 2016) pays homage to the Art Deco era Main Post Office in Lower Hutt town centre.

A re-zoning of Naenae made it partly industrial in the 1960s, but it remained principally a residential area. At its peak, Naenae boasted two manufacturers with strong Dutch connections:
* Philips, which produced televisions and radios. The last television set produced in this factory was made on 11 June 1988. Resene Paints occupied the buildings .
* Rembrandt Suits, formed following the Second World War by Dutch tailors. It moved out of its 1950s era Naenae factory in 2012.

=== Swimming pool ===
Naenae&#x27;s shopping centre contained an Olympic-size swimming-pool, built when New Zealand hosted an international diving championships. The pool was opened on 10 November 1956, and had three diving boards. Originally open-air, a roof over the pool was completed in 1987, making it usable all year round. A hydroslide was constructed adjacent to the main pool in the same project. The toddlers&#x27; paddling pool remained open-air for a few years more. At the time of the completion of the roof, the pool was the only facility in Wellington with both a 50 metre pool and competition diving platforms.

The pool closed in April 2019 due to earthquake concerns. In 2021, the Hutt City Council approved a budget of $68m for replacing the pool as part of their 10-year plan. In 2020, the council had funding support of $27m from central government. Demolition of the original pool began in 2021, in preparation for redevelopment. In 2022, the former Community Hall was demolished in preparation for building a new Naenae Pool and Fitness Centre that includes an Olympic size pool with 10 lanes. Other projects include refurbishing the library, building a new community centre, and redeveloping Walter Mildenhall park.

<text>The Northern Airport Expressway, officially numbered S28, is an 11.29 km toll road extension that runs from G45 Daqing–Guangzhou Expressway (formerly Beijing-Chengde Expressway) to the Beijing Capital International Airport in Beijing, China. It was opened in September 2006. The opening of this road has helped to alleviate traffic on the Airport Expressway, which had been the sole highway link to the airport. The Northern Airport Line allows drivers from Zhongguancun and points north and west of the city to head north first on Jingcheng Expressway before going directly east to the airport, instead of having to go east on the 4th Ring Road to get on the Airport Expressway, where traffic is often clogged near the Siyuan Bridge.

<text>St. Charles Rock Road is the current name of what was the first road to traverse present-day St. Louis County, Missouri between St. Louis and St. Charles. For most of its length it is also known as Route 180.

==Route description==
Its present-day origin is at the border of the cities of Wellston (to the east) and Pagedale, starting as a co-signed road with pre-existing Route 180 at a T intersection with Lucas-Hunt Road. Route 180, up to this transition point, is co-signed with Dr. Martin Luther King Drive, from Route 180&#x27;s eastern terminus in St. Louis&#x27; Kingsway East neighborhood; Dr. Martin Luther King Drive originates farther east than Route 180, where the Martin Luther King Bridge crosses the Mississippi River into central St. Louis. St. Charles Rock Road/Route 180 proceeds northwest past several cemeteries, crosses under I-170 within St. John, then continues through Breckenridge Hills and St. Ann. As it enters Bridgeton, it crosses over I-70 and then under I-270. From I-270 it continues northwest towards the banks of the Missouri River, ending opposite St. Charles at Missouri Bottom Road.

==History==

In the 1760s, St. Louis (on the Mississippi River) and St. Charles (on the Missouri) were the two major European settlements in the lower Missouri River Valley. A path between the two came to be known as King’s Highway, a name used in colonial times by the Spanish and then the French for many frequently used roads. The southeastern end of the road became known as St. Charles Street.

On May 20, 1804, Capt. Meriwether Lewis reached St. Charles, the expedition&#x27;s last &quot;civilized&quot; stop, via St. Charles Rock Road to meet up with Lt. William Clark. The Lewis and Clark Expedition then officially began with 40 to 50 men – the precise number is unknown.

In 1819, St. Charles Road was established as a post road and stagecoach road; by 1837 it became a turnpike. The road furnished access to the Santa Fe Trail and Oregon Trail for the many westbound wagon trains that were outfitted in St. Louis. After passage of the Missouri Plank Road Law in 1851, it became an oak plank road. In 1865, St. Charles Road was rebuilt with macadam and renamed St. Charles Rock Road. In 1921, it became the first concrete state highway in St. Louis County. In 1953, St. Charles Rock Road was completed as a divided two-lane highway along much of its length.

==Transportation==
A major influence in the route&#x27;s location today was construction of an electric interurban railway, the St. Louis, St. Charles and Western Railway, west from Easton Avenue (which had been St. Charles Road and became Dr. Martin Luther King Drive) and Hodiamont, in stages, to St. Charles. From Wellston to the current location of Lindbergh Boulevard the line ran in a straight shot while the road meandered around St. John and Breckenridge Hills. Eventually the road was relocated to adjoin the streetcar line, which ran to its north. Many portions of the original road are now side streets in the area. Running west, streetcar line diverged from the Rock Road at the present location of Lindbergh and headed northwest for Bridgeton, which brought it just west of where the Rock Road swung south away from its present route to join Fee Fee Creek and head west. The route was winding, the creek prone to flooding but the land acquisition was easiest along the Creek. When the interurban line stopped running in the 1930s, the Road Rock was reconstructed on the railroad right-of-way for a direct shot into St. Charles. The former route was named Old St. Charles Rock Road, now Boenker Road. Today, a portion of the streetcar right-of-way, complete with poles, has survived intact on the south side of the Rock Road just east of Earth City Expressway.

<text>The Bulldog and Bird classes were double-framed inside cylinder 4-4-0 steam locomotives used for passenger services on the Great Western Railway. The Bird Class were a development of the Bulldogs with strengthened outside frames, of which a total of fifteen were built. A total of 121 Bulldogs were built new, with a further twenty rebuilt from Duke Class locomotives. Thirty Bulldogs were later rebuilt as Earl Class locomotives and renumbered 3265 (prototype conversion), 3200-3228.

==History==

No. 3312 &quot;Bulldog&quot; was built in October 1898, with curved outside frames, a domed parallel boiler with a raised Belpaire firebox and a wrapper-type smokebox. The boiler was a prototype for the parallel version of Churchward&#x27;s Standard No. 2 boilers. &quot;Bulldog&quot; was originally classed as a variant of the Duke Class.

In October 1899 no. 3352 &quot;Camel&quot; appeared with the final form of the parallel No. 2 boiler, domeless, with a raised Belpaire firebox and a circular drumhead smokebox supported on a curved saddle. A further twenty locomotives, nos. 3332 to 3351, were built between November 1899 and March 1900. Between May and December 1900 a second batch of twenty Camels (as the class were initially known) were built with straight-topped outside frames. These were numbered 3353 to 3372. A third batch, 3413 to 3432 were built between December 1902 and May 1903; these were the last to be built with parallel boilers.
In September 1903 no. 3443 &quot;Birkenhead&quot; was built with a tapered Standard No. 2 boiler. The boiler was tapered only over the rear half of the barrel, and this type became known as the &quot;half-cone&quot;; a later version of the No. 2 boiler was tapered over three-quarters of the barrel. A further twenty-nine locomotives were built with the half-cone boiler between September 1903 and April 1904, bringing the class total to ninety-one.

Between April and September 1906 thirty locomotives were built with the three-quarter coned No. 2 boiler. In March 1906, &quot;Bulldog&quot; was rebuilt with the same type of boiler, and the class now became known as the Bulldog Class. From October 1906 to January 1909 eighteen of the Duke Class were converted to Bulldogs by the fitting of No. 2 boilers. A further member of the Duke Class, no. 3273 &quot;Armorel&quot;, had been fitted with a parallel domeless boiler in February 1902, thus becoming a Camel Class locomotive. It ran with tapered boilers of various types from April 1906.

The Bird Class were a development of the Bulldog Class with deeper outside frames and a new type of bogie. Previously all outside framed bogies on GWR locomotives had been of the Dean centreless type. Churchward adapted a French design of bogie, as used on the de Glehn Atlantics, to produce a bar-framed bogie for his standard locomotives. This inside-framed bogie design was adapted to produce an outside-framed replacement for the Dean bogie. The Birds were built in two batches; nos. 3731 to 3735 in May 1909 and nos. 3736 to 3745 from November 1909 to January 1910.

This class were subject to the 1912 renumbering of GWR 4-4-0 locomotives, which saw the Bulldog Class gathered together in the series 3300-3455, and other types renumbered out of that series. The 3300-3455 series had previously contained locomotives of Duke, Badminton, Atbara, City and a number of Bulldog class locomotives. After the renumbering, nos. 3300–19 were former Duke class locomotives rebuilt as Bulldogs between 1902 and 1909; nos. 3320–3440 were those built as Bulldogs; and nos. 3441–55 were the Bird class.

No. 3320 &quot;Avalon&quot; was the first of the Bulldog Class to be withdrawn, in August 1929, followed by no. 3365 &quot;Charles Grey Mott&quot;, withdrawn in January 1930. The frames of 3365 were used to construct the first of the Earl Class, no. 3265 &quot;Tre Pol and Pen&quot;. The last to be withdrawn was no. 3377 &quot;Penzance&quot; in January 1951.

All of the Bird Class survived into British Railways ownership, being withdrawn between April 1948 and November 1951, the last two being no. 3453 &quot;Seagull&quot; and no. 3454 &quot;Skylark&quot;.

No Bulldogs were preserved; however the frames of no. 3425 survive under Earl no. 9017 &#x27;Earl of Berkeley&#x27; at the Bluebell Railway.

==Accidents and incidents==
*In 1904, locomotive No. 3460 &quot;Montreal&quot; was hauling a passenger train with GWR 1661 Class 0-6-0ST No. 1674, when it was derailed at Loughor, Glamorgan due to excessive speed. Five people were killed and eighteen were injured.

<doc id="1321997" wikidata="Q648608" url="?curid=1321997" title="Rochet">
<text>A rochet () is a white vestment generally worn by a Roman Catholic or Anglican bishop in choir dress. It is virtually unknown in Eastern Christianity. The rochet in its Roman form is similar to a surplice, with narrower sleeves and a hem that comes below the knee, and both of which may be made of lace. The Anglican form is a descendant of traditional albs worn by deacons and priests, but with sleeves gathered at the wrists, and nearly as long as the underlying cassock.

The word stems from the Latin &quot;rochettum&quot; (from the Late Latin &quot;roccus&quot;, connected to the Old High German &quot;roch&quot;, &quot;roc&quot; and the Anglo-Saxon &quot;rocc&quot;; Dutch &quot;koorhemd, rochet&quot;, French &quot;rochet&quot;, German &quot;Rochett, Chorkleid&quot;, Italian &quot;rocchetto&quot;, Spanish &quot;roquete&quot;), which means an ecclesiastical vestment.

== Catholic use ==
In the Catholic Church, cardinals, bishops and certain other dignitaries use a rochet, a garment that is worn over the cassock for non-Eucharistic functions, or Masses at which the wearer is not a celebrant.

The Catholic rochet is a tunic of white, usually fine linen or muslin (batiste, mull) reaching about to the knee, and distinguished from the surplice mainly by the narrower sleeves which make its arms tight-fitting. It is frequently trimmed with lace. The lower edge and the sleeves may also be garnished with lace, lined with violet or red silk (in the case of prelates), or, more rarely, embroidered borders.

The rochet is proper to, and distinctive of, prelates and bishops, but the right to wear it is sometimes granted by the pope to others, especially the canons of cathedral churches. It is not a &quot;vestis sacra&quot;, and thus cannot be used as a substitute for the surplice (e.g., in the administering of the Sacraments, following the Decree of the Congregation of Rites of January 10, 1852). Nonetheless, since it is used at choir services and is ordered to be worn over everyday dress at Mass (Missa rom. Rit. celebr. i. 2), it may be included among liturgical vestments in the widest sense. It is worn instead of a surplice by Canons Regular as part of their habit for liturgical use alone.

The earliest notice of the use of the rochet is found in an 9th-century inventory of vestments of the Roman clergy. In this, it is called &quot;camisia&quot;, a name which it retained at Rome until the 14th century. It seems to have been proper to particular members of the clergy by that time. Other Roman names for the vestment were &quot;succa, sucta&quot;; it was not until the 14th century that the name &quot;rochettum&quot; appeared at Rome, but it was not long before it had superseded all the native designations. In the Middle Ages, it was always plain.

Outside Rome, too, the vestment is met with fairly early, e.g. in the Frankish empire (9th century) as &quot;alba clericalis&quot;, in contrast to the liturgical alb, and in England (10th century) under the name of &quot;oferslip&quot; (in the 46th canon of the ecclesiastical laws of Edgar). At the beginning of the 12th century, the rochet is mentioned under the name of &quot;camisia&quot;, by Gilbert of Limerick and by Honorius, and, somewhat later, by Gerloh of Reichersperg as &quot;tunica talaris&quot;. From the 13th century onward, it is frequently mentioned. The name &quot;rocheltum&quot; is first traceable in England; in Germany and northern France, the rochet was also called &quot;sarohi&quot; (Latinized &quot;sarrotus&quot;) or &quot;sarcos&quot; (Latinized &quot;sarcotium&quot;).

Outside Rome, the rochet was, until well into the 14th century, a vestment common to all the clergy, and especially to those of lower orders; and so it remained in some places as late as the 19th. Moreover, in especially in the German dioceses, it had a liturgical character, being used instead of the surplice.

The rochet was originally a robe-like tunic, and was therefore girdled, like the liturgical alb. As late as 1260, the provincial synod of Cologne decreed that the &quot;vestis camisialis&quot; must be long enough to cover everyday dress entirely. A good example of the &quot;camisia&quot; of the 12th century is the rochet of Thomas Becket preserved at Dammartin in the Pas de Calais. It is the only surviving mediaeval example, and remarkable for its pleating: this, as with albs, gave greater breadth and more elaborate folds. 

In the 15th century, the rochet only reached halfway down the shin; by the 16th and 17th, to the knee; in the 18th and 19th, often only until mid-thigh.

== Anglican use ==

In the Anglican churches the rochet is a vestment peculiar to bishops and is worn by them in choir dress with the chimere, both in ministration in church and also on ceremonial occasions outside, e.g. sitting in the House of Lords, attending a royal levee, or commencement ceremony. It may be worn with a stole, cope and mitre for more dignified occasions (such as Baptism outside the context of the Eucharist, Solemn Evensong, royal weddings and the coronation of the Sovereign).
In general it has retained the medieval form more closely than the Roman rochet and more resembles the alb, insofar as it is of plain, very fine linen, and reaches almost to the feet. Where the Roman rochet is descended from the surplice, the rochet in its Anglican form is equal to that of the earlier style albs worn by priests. The main modifications have been in the (usually) baggy &#x27;lawn&#x27; sleeves that are gathered at the wrists with a band of black or scarlet cloth. At the time of the Reformation these were still narrow, though already showing a tendency to expand. The portrait of Archbishop Warham at Lambeth, for instance, shows a rochet with fairly wide sleeves narrowing towards the wrists, where they are confined by fur cuffs. This fashion continued until, in the 17th century, the sleeves became much fuller; only in the 18th century did they develop into the familiar exaggerated balloon shape, confined at the wrists by a ribbon, beyond which a ruffle projected. About the same period, too, arose the custom of making the rochet sleeveless and attaching the lawn sleeves to the chimere. This remained the fashion most of the 19th century, but there has since been a tendency to revert to the earlier less exaggerated form, and the sleeves have been reattached to the rochet. The ribbon by which the wrist is confined is red, except when conducting or participating in a formal, public funeral (e.g. of a head of state), when it is black.

The rochet is worn without the chimere under the cope by those bishops who use this vestment. At his consecration the bishop-elect is, according to the rubric, presented to the consecrating bishops vested in a rochet only; after the laying on of hands he retires and puts on the rest of the episcopal habit; i.e. the chimere.
One exception to the normal Anglican-style is the rochet worn by the previous Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, which has open-ended narrow sleeves in the manner of the Roman rochet.

<text>Castle Brewery is one of the oldest commercial breweries in South Africa. As company-endorsed legend would have it, the company was founded by Charles Glass in Johannesburg in 1894. UCT history professor Anne Kelk Mager has argued that the official SAB story overemphasized the role of Charles and that it was his wife Lisa Glass who was primarily responsible for the creation of Castle. It later merged with other breweries to form South African Breweries, which still later merged with Miller of the United States to form SABMiller.

On October 10, 2016, Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion at the time the deal closed a year later). The arrangement had been approved by shareholders of both companies on 28 September 2016, and the deal closed on 10 October 2016. The acquisition - subsequently referred to as a merger in the news media - ended the corporate use of the name SABMiller. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, (AB InBev) and is trading as ABI on the Brussels Stock Exchange, as BUD on the New York stock exchange and as ANH on the Johannesburg market.
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and became a business division of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV. On October 11, 2016, Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors. 

Since SABMiller no longer exists as an entity, South African Breweries is now a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (abbreviated as AB InBev).

==History==

Prior to incorporation in 1895, Castle Brewery had operations in Cape Town to serve the steady expansion of a settler community from the mid-17th century. The demand for beer prompted the first Dutch governor, Jan van Riebeeck, to establish a brewery at the Fort (later replaced by the Castle in central Cape Town) as early as 1658 - beating the first wine production by six months. In the same year, Pieter Visagie brewed the first beer from the waters of the Liesbeeck River. Over the next 200 years, brewing made its mark in the Cape and beyond. Noted brewers of the time included Cloete at the Newlands Brewery; Ohlsson at the Anneberg Brewery; Jacob Letterstedt at Mariendahl Brewery - also in Newlands: Hiddingh at Cannon Brewery; Martienssen at the Salt River Brewery, and a second Cloete in Kloof Street.

One of the key figures in the story of Newlands, and in South African beer manufacturing history, was Swede Anders Ohlsson, who sailed for Africa, aged 23, in 1864. Initially, he imported Swedish goods and timbers, and developed an extensive trade network and a solid business empire. Then he turned to brewing, basing himself at Newlands, where he produced Lion Lager. In 1956, Castle Brewery bought out Ohlssons and Chandlers Union Breweries and the company, for the first time, became known as the South African Breweries.

==Brands==

The main brand is Castle Lager, first brewed in 1895. Castle Lager has won many awards, from gold medals to the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Bottled Lager&quot; award at the 2000 International Brewing Industry Awards. The lager has 5% ABV with a unique light hops taste, advertised as &quot;somewhat dry, somewhat bitter, never sweet&quot; and as &quot;the beer that stood the test of time&quot;.

South African Breweries is a major supporter of South African sport, and Castle Lager is the official sponsor of the South African cricket and soccer teams. Until 2004, it was also the primary sponsor of the national rugby team, the Springboks, but that position has now been taken by Standard bank Group Limited.

<doc id="1322008" wikidata="Q5285098" url="?curid=1322008" title="Dizrythmia">
<text>Dizrythmia (1977) is the third studio album released by New Zealand new wave band Split Enz. It was the first Split Enz album without co-founding members Phil Judd and Mike Chunn. Neil Finn and Nigel Griggs, the first being the younger brother of band leader Tim Finn, replaced them respectively. Meanwhile, Nigel&#x27;s old friend and former bandmate Malcolm Green took the place of Emlyn Crowther, who also left around this time. The album was released domestically by Mushroom Records, and overseas by Chrysalis Records.

The single &quot;My Mistake&quot; was a hit in New Zealand and Australia, but failed to make much impact overseas. &quot;Bold as Brass&quot; was the second single. The album is regarded as the start of the band&#x27;s breakthrough, and marked a shift from art rock to more pop-oriented songs.

The album&#x27;s title comes from circadian dysrhythmia, more commonly known as jet lag.

The back cover was originally intended as the front cover. Both were designed by Noel Crombie, who also designed the band&#x27;s costumes.

Tim Finn coughs forty-four seconds into &quot;Nice to Know&quot;, a feature erroneously left in the final mix.

Both Tim Finn and Eddie Rayner were disappointed with the final mix of &quot;Charlie&quot;, feeling that the vocals sounded very flat. Geoff Emerick, the engineer for the album, thought it was a beautiful vocal, however, so it stayed.

<doc id="1322028" wikidata="Q203398" url="?curid=1322028" title="Chimere">
<text>A chimere ( or ) is a garment worn by Anglican bishops in choir dress, and, formally as part of academic dress.

A descendant of a riding cloak, the chimere resembles an academic gown but without sleeves, and is usually made of scarlet or black cloth. In modern English use the garment is worn as part of the ceremonial dress of Anglican bishops. It is a long sleeveless gown of silk or satin, open down the front, gathered in at the back between the shoulders, and with slits for the arms. It is worn over the rochet, colored either black or scarlet (a combination referred to as &quot;convocation robes&quot;).

==Ecclesiastical use==

The chimere is worn by the bishops of the Anglican Communion as a component of their choir habit. It is traditionally coloured either scarlet or black, although some bishops have innovated a purple chimere. The wrist-bands of the bishop&#x27;s rochet typically match the colour of the chimere.

For Anglican bishops, the chimere is part of their formal vesture in choir dress: typically, the chimere would be worn over a purple cassock and the rochet and would be accompanied by a black scarf known as a tippet, with an optional academic hood. The chimere may be worn when vested in the cope, but not necessarily. Due to liturgical changes in the later nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it is no longer common for the chimere to be worn when celebrating the Eucharist, though the practice is still kept by some low-church bishops.

Traditionally, the red chimere was worn only by bishops holding the degree of Doctor of Divinity and the black chimere by the others. This did not matter for many years, as formerly all bishops were conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity upon consecrated. When this practice ceased, the distinction was largely ignored, as in recent times many bishops regularly wear the red chimere, regardless of academic status.

On the analogy of the Catholic mantelletta, certain Anglican prelates have from sometimes appeared in purple chimeres. An influential article on chimeres and their colours by The Rev. N. F. Robinson at the end of the 19th century urged the retention of the garment, especially the black chimere.

In some churches, the lead singer of the choir is permitted to wear a chimere. It is also a traditional part of the vestments of a verger.

==History==
The word (; ; ; cf. Spanish , &#x27;sheepskin coat&#x27;) derives from the Latin or , possibly derived ultimately from Ancient Greek , (&#x27;wintry&#x27;), originally referred to a winter overcoat (cf. the cognate mythological monster Chimaera).

Its secular precursor was worn also by the Roman Senators, and is still worn by some university professors.

The origin of the chimere has been the subject of much debate; the view of it as a modification of the cope has been discarded, and it is practically proved to be derived from the mediaeval tabard (, or ), an upper garment worn in civil life by all classes of people both in England and abroad. It has therefore a common origin with certain items of academic dress.

The word chimere, which first appeared in England in the 14th century, was sometimes applied not only to the tabard worn over the rochet, but to the sleeved cassock worn under it. Richard le Scrope (Archbishop of York, died 1405) is described as wearing on his way to execution a blue chimere with sleeves. However, the word properly applies to the sleeveless tabard which tended to supersede, from the 15th century onwards, the inconvenient (a long, closed cloak with a slit in front for the arms) as the out-of-doors upper garment of bishops. These chimeres, the colors of which (murrey, scarlet, green, etc.) may have denoted academic rank, were part of the civil dress of prelates. Thus, in the inventory of Walter Skirlawe, Bishop of Durham (1405–1406), eight chimeres of various colors are mentioned, including two for riding (&quot;pro equitatura&quot;). The chimere was, moreover, a cold weather garment, and In summer was replaced by the tippet.

By a late abuse, the sleeves of the rochet were, from motives of convenience, sometimes attached to the chimere.

The Anglican rubric for the consecration of a bishop directs the newly consecrated prelate, hitherto vested in rochet, to put on the rest of the episcopal habit, i.e. the chimere. The garment has thus become in the Church of England symbolic of the episcopal office, and is in effect a liturgical vestment. This direction was added to the Book of Common Prayer in 1662, and there is proof the development of the chimere into at least a choir vestment was subsequent to the Reformation. John Foxe, indeed, mentions that Hooper at his consecration wore a long scarlet &quot;chymere&quot; down to the foot (Acts and Mon., ed. 1563, p. 1051), a source of trouble to himself and of scandal to other extreme reformers; but that this was no more than the full civil dress of a bishop is proved by the fact that Archbishop Parker at his consecration wore surplice and tippet, and only wore the chimere once the service was over, for leaving. This civil character of the garment still survives alongside the other; the full dress of an Anglican prelate at important civil functions (e.g. in parliament, or at court) is still the rochet and chimere.

===Catholic counterparts===
The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition spoke of the zimarra or simarre as the equivalent on the European continent of the chimere and indicated that the English word was derived, through Old French, from the Italian term . It cited ecclesiologists as defining the zimarra as a kind of soutane (cassock), from which it was distinguished by having a small cape and short, open arms (&quot;manches-fausses&quot;) reaching to the middle of the upper arm and decorated with buttons. The same ecclesiologists identified the zimarra with the , which was described as “the uppermost garment of the clergy, worn over the soutane, instead of the .” In France and Germany, it was fitted more or less to the figure; in Italy it was wider and fell down straight in front. Unlike the chimere, it was not associated with any particular rank of clergy nor was universally used by them. As late as the middle of the 18th century, the zimarra was still in common use as an out-of-doors overcoat, but after that it was in Italy associated with certain members of the clergy, senators of the city of Rome (before the unification of Italy) and university professors. In 1910, at the time of composition of the Encyclopædia Britannica article, Pope Benedict XV wore a black zimarra lined with white, and sometimes ornamented with white binding and gold tassels.

In the Catholic Church, the zimarra was never a liturgical vestment nor part of choir dress. It was more or less a loose cloak clergymen sometimes used as part of mere everyday civilian dress. In Italian, the term is generally used not of a close-fitting garment, such as the cassock, but of a loose over-garment, similar to the fur-lined used in northern Europe. Images of the zimarra as worn by women can be seen at Dressing the Italian Way and The Italian Showcase.

While the word &quot;chimere&quot; is derived from the Italian word , the Catholic ecclesiastical garment most like the loose-fitting chimere is the , whose use by cardinals and bishops was abolished by the 1969 &quot;Instruction on the Dress, Titles and Coats-of-Arms of Cardinals, Bishops and Lesser Prelates&quot;. The same document also abolished the for lesser prelates in general, maintaining it only for a limited number of officials of the Roman Curia.

==Academic use==
As an item of academic dress, a slightly modified version of the chimere is, for instance, prescribed at the University of Oxford for doctors in Convocation Dress — and as such it is referred to as the Convocation Habit. The differences are that the chimere is worn open and the Convocation Habit is worn closed with two large buttons.

If an Anglican bishop is part of the &quot;platform party&quot; at a commencement (that is, the speaker, or is giving the invocation or benediction) he may wear the rochet and chimere with the appropriate hood and academic cap.

<doc id="1322029" wikidata="Q3541103" url="?curid=1322029" title="True Colours (Split Enz album)">
<text>True Colours is the sixth studio album released by New Zealand band Split Enz, and was their first major commercial success. Released on 21 January 1980, the album featured more pronounced contributions from co-lead singer and songwriter Neil Finn than previous releases. The album&#x27;s New Zealand and Australian number 1 single, &quot;I Got You&quot;, which also broke them internationally, is credited to him. The US release of the album featured &quot;Shark Attack&quot; and &quot;I Got You&quot; in reversed positions due to the latter&#x27;s success on the single charts.

==Details==
Tim Finn said, &quot;We had been playing so many shows, so the band were very tight. It was like everything was starting to line up to make a really powerful record.&quot; Crombie added, &quot;We&#x27;d had a rough time up to that in England, and I think we&#x27;re really just raring to go. We came back to Melbourne and recorded the album and it just felt it was a new beginning.&quot;

Finn later said of recording, &quot;David Tickle was supremely confident, almost arrogant, but he gave us something to bounce off. Half the time we didn&#x27;t even like him. He wasn&#x27;t some svengali who sprinkled the fairy dust. He was mostly a good engineer.&quot;

Originally, the band thought &quot;Missing Person&quot; to be the album&#x27;s standout track, not realizing &quot;I Got You&quot; would become the hit. &quot;I Hope I Never&quot; was mixed differently for the Australian single release, with strengthened percussion. &quot;Nobody Takes Me Seriously&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter with You&quot; and &quot;Poor Boy&quot; were released as singles in the northern hemisphere.

A synthesizer melody played in &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Dream of It&quot; was first introduced in an early Split Enz recording, aptly titled &quot;The Instrumental&quot;.

==Cover==
The album cover was initially released in four colour combinations – yellow and blue, red and green, purple and yellow, and blue and orange – but would ultimately be given another four makeovers with releases in lime green and pink, hot purple and burnt orange, gold and platinum (to mark its sales milestones), and finally yellow, blue and red.

Crombie later said, &quot;There was a lot of resistance initially. For some reason they thought people would get confused. It was just playing with it really. Why not? In the end there were 11 covers. The rarest one is the black and white one that got sent out to the press. There&#x27;s about 100 of them, with Textas to colour your own. So, if you&#x27;re really keen, you&#x27;ll have 11.&quot;

When it was later released on the A&amp;M label, imaginative shapes and patterns covered the vinyl using a technique known as &quot;laser-etching&quot;. When light hit the record, these designs would protrude and spin about the room. The album was the first to ever use this technique, originally designed to discourage the creation of counterfeit copies.

==Reissues==
True Colours was remastered by Eddie Rayner and re-released on two occasions. Firstly in 2003, and yet again with the rest of the Split Enz catalogue on 20 May 2006 with the bonus tracks &quot;Things&quot; and &quot;Two of a Kind&quot;. In October 2010, the album was listed at number 22 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;, despite Split Enz being a New Zealand group.

On the 40th anniversary of the release in 2020, the album was remixed by Rayner, reissued as &quot;True Colours: 40th Anniversary Mix&quot; and reached number one on the New Zealand Albums chart again.

==Critical reception==

Reviewed in &quot;Roadrunner&quot; at the time of release, it was described as, &quot;a thoughtful, reflective album. The approach to songs is more straight forward, more serious, than the Split Enz we are all used to.&quot;

Crombie later said, &quot;I think we split our audience to some extent. It seemed like a real sort of dividing point. Suddenly we had a lot of teenage girls in our audience and it moved into a different kind of vibe in terms of live performance.” Tim Finn agreed, &quot;If you were a &quot;Mental Notes&quot; freak, you might have taken a step back at that point.&quot;

<text>The Rhode Island State Police (RISP) is an agency of the US state of Rhode Island responsible for statewide law enforcement and regulation, especially in areas underserved by local police agencies and on the state&#x27;s limited-access highways. Its headquarters is in North Scituate (a village of Scituate).

==History==
The RISP was founded in 1925 at the request of the state&#x27;s General Assembly, and was modeled on the organization structure of the Pennsylvania State Police. Its first headquarters was in the Benefit Street Marine Corps Armory in Providence, which stationed the first twenty-three troopers and the Superintendent. At this stage, the division relied heavily on Indian motorcycles to perform their wide-ranging patrol duties.

In 1936, the RISP acquired the so-called Coggeshall property in North Scituate. Consisting of approximately 145 acres of land and many outbuildings, the centerpiece of the property and new headquarters building was the Coggeshall Mansion, built in the late 19th century. The mansion and outbuildings are still in use by the RISP.

During this time, the division organized itself into three patrol districts comprising the northern, southern, and &quot;island&quot; parts of the state. As the twentieth century progressed, the RISP enlarged and modified itself, establishing new barracks and instituting new programs to further meet its statewide policing mandate.

Troopers did not apply to join the Rhode Island State Police but &quot;enlisted&quot; for three-year periods, after which they could apply for reenlistment. The reenlistment included a review of job performance and a full medical examination. If the member was found to be suitable for reenlistment, they were sworn in again by a member of the Division&#x27;s Command Staff. This longstanding three-year enlistment continues to this day.

==RISP at present==
Currently, the RISP is composed of two districts, District &quot;A&quot; which covers the northern half of the state and District &quot;B&quot; which covers the southern half of the state. There are currently four patrol commands, referred to as barracks, located in:

* Lincoln (RISP-Lincoln Woods Barracks)
* Richmond (RISP-Hope Valley Barracks)
* North Scituate (RISP-Scituate Barracks)
* North Kingstown (RISP-Wickford Barracks)

The RISP fields an additional patrol command at the TF Green Airport in Warwick. The Portsmouth Barracks would be the fifth, but is not currently in use.

Construction of the Rhode Island State Police Headquarters was completed in 2010 in North Scituate on the same property where the Administrative Services building once stood. The building serves as a Public Safety Complex and houses the RISP Patrol Bureau, Detective Bureau, Administrative Bureau, and many other specialized units. It also houses the E 9-1-1 Uniform Emergency Telephone System. The outer buildings and Coggeshall Mansion house administrative and logistical support units and are located on the same grounds as the headquarters building. Also on the grounds of the Public Safety Complex in North Scituate is the RISP Museum, which is open to the public.

The Division also maintains specialized units such as its Charitable Gaming Unit, SWAT team, Dive Team (SCUBA), Intelligence Unit, Detective Unit, Governor&#x27;s Security Unit, Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Unit, Training Academy staff, K9 Team, Computer Crimes Unit, Financial Crimes Unit, Narcotics Unit, and Criminal Identification Unit as well as many other specialized units.

The Rhode Island State Police Academy is located in the town of Foster. The site was originally a United States Army Nike Missile Base which was decommissioned and turned over to the state of Rhode Island. The state then turned the facility over to the state police as the location for their new training academy.

In December 2018 troopers began using the SIG Sauer P320 chambered in 9mm to replace the older P226 DAK pistols.

Less-lethal weapons issued to Troopers include OC Pepper Spray, Tasers, and the Expandable Straight Baton.

The Rhode Island State Police achieved its initial accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) in 1994, and was reaccredited in 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, and 2011. The Division achieved Flagship Status in 2005, 2008, and 2011 and received the Accreditation with Excellence Award in 2011, 2014, and 2017.

==Uniforms==
The 1950s-era uniform of the Rhode Island State Police is unique in the United States law enforcement community. The uniform has also won best dressed in the country in previous years and in 2005, the National Association of Uniform Manufacturers and Distributors (NAUMD) presented the Rhode Island State Police with an 80th Anniversary Commemorative Uniform Award. The RISP is one of only five state police forces that do not wear a badge on their uniform shirts. Instead, they wear a set of numbers stamped in brass, placed onto a piece of black fabric, with red piping on the edges, over the left breast on the uniform shirt. However, the RISP does issue a wallet badge for off-duty use/identification. The badge is gold colored for all ranks.

Unlike most other police agencies in the USA, which utilize black leather duty gear and footwear, the RISP wears leather duty gear and footwear (high boots or shoes, depending on the uniform season) that is a deep chestnut brown color, creating a very distinctive look. RISP high boots, shoes, and most of the leather duty gear is produced by the historic Dehner Boot Company of Omaha, Nebraska. The RISP also has the distinction of being one of the few, if not the only, agencies to have three seasonal uniform changes as opposed to the standard two season (summer and winter) uniform change that most agencies utilize. The three consist of the winter uniform (high boots, breeches, long sleeve shirt with Sam Browne strap), spring/fall uniform (shoes, regular uniform Pants, long-sleeve shirt with Sam Browne strap) and summer uniform (shoes, regular uniform pants, short-sleeve shirt without Sam Browne strap).

The primary colors on the State Police uniform are black and red. The epaulets worn on uniform shirts and dress blouses are black and piped in red. The stripe on the spring/fall and summer uniform pants is a wide black stripe while the striping on the winter/dress uniform breeches is a wide black stripe that is piped with a thinner red stripe. The spring/fall and summer uniform pants and shirts are a lighter charcoal gray while the winter and dress pants and shirts are a darker charcoal gray. A black tie is worn with the winter, spring/fall and dress uniforms and is tucked into the uniform shirt after the first button.

The uniform hat of the RISP is a gray straw campaign style hat for the summer and spring/fall uniforms while the winter and dress uniform hat is a tan felt campaign style hat. Both hats feature a brown leather band at the base of the hat and a gold colored hat badge mounted on a brown leather backing.

Specialized units (K-9, Tactical Unit, etc.) are authorized to wear BDU-style utility uniforms and black nylon web duty gear.

===Rank structure===
==Fallen officers==
Since the establishment of the Rhode Island State Police, seven officers have died in the line of duty.
==In popular culture==
The Rhode Island State Police won the &quot;Best Dressed&quot; award from the National Association of Uniform Manufacturers and Distributors (NAUMD) in 1986. On September 30, 1986, six troopers went to New York City to model the uniform on the television show &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;.
The Rhode Island State Police features prominently in the 2000 comedy film &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot;, with Jim Carrey playing a state trooper affected with multiple personality disorder.

In the television series &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, the character Declan Giggs, portrayed by the actor Ethan Embry, is a Rhode Island State Police Detective.

The Netflix movie &quot;Rescued by Ruby&quot; details the real life story of a RISP K9, Ruby and her partner Daniel.

<text>The Umiray River is a river that separates the Aurora and Quezon provinces. It is bounded by the towns of Dingalan in Aurora and General Nakar in Quezon, it is ironically bounded by 2 barangays of the same name of each town, also &quot;Umiray&quot;. 

It is used as a means of transport by the illegal loggers. From the mountains, the illegal loggers float the &quot;troso&quot; (lumber) and float them downstream up to the ocean. During the late 20th century (and continuing up to the present), it has been the site of several clashes between the army and the communist group, the New People&#x27;s Army. In 1995, the government has made a project called Umiray–Angat Transbasin Project (UATP) to link the Pacific Ocean with Angat River in Bulacan&#x27;s mountains through a tunnel that will traverse Umiray River then cut through the mountains of Sierra Madre straight to Angat River. In 2013, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System signed an agreement with the General Nakar, Quezon local government unit to replace the structures made in 1995 to increase the flow from the Umiray to the Angat.

<text>The Tarantula is the name of two characters appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The first, John Law, is a superhero introduced during the Golden Age of Comic Books, while the second is a villain introduced in the 2000s. Both are associated with the character Nightwing.

==Publication history==
The original Tarantula was a character prominent in the 1940s named John Law. He first appeared in &quot;Star-Spangled Comics&quot; #1 (October 1941) and was created by Mort Weisinger and designed and drawn by cartoonist Hal Sharp. He continued in &quot;Star Spangled Comics&quot; until issue #19 (April 1943). In his initial Golden Age appearances he wore a yellow-and-purple costume that bore strong resemblance to Wesley Dodds&#x27; second Sandman costume. This was later explained in a retcon in the pages of &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; as coming from Dodds&#x27; associate, Dian Belmont. He was assisted by his housekeeper Olga. According to &quot;Jess Nevins&#x27; Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes&quot;, the Tarantula battles &quot;the sword-wielding Blade, the cowboy thief the Outlaw and his pyrotechnic partner the Candle, the Hindu-themed Shiva, and the crime lord Sting&quot;.

The second Tarantula, Catalina Flores, first appeared in &quot;Nightwing&quot; (vol. 2) #71 (September 2002), and debuted as Tarantula in issue #75 (January 2003). She was created by Devin Grayson.

==Fictional character biography==
===John Law===
Mystery story writer John Law was inspired to become a mystery man by the Crimson Avenger in the days after America entered World War II. The Tarantula possessed no super-abilities but relied on several gimmicks and his quick wits. He was trained in hand-to-hand combat, as well as some acrobatics, and had a passing interest in stage make-up and stage magic. He used suction cups attached to the soles on his boots to allow him to walk up walls and hang from ceilings. He used a &quot;web-gun&quot; which fired a string of fast-hardening nylon that was used to swing from one anchored point to another.

He was a member of the All-Star Squadron before retiring to continue his writing career. He published a best-selling book, &quot;Altered Egos: The Mystery Men of World War II&quot;, sometime in the 1970s. He went on to write many other books, but none were as successful as &quot;Altered Egos&quot;.

In his later years, Law lived in the city of Blüdhaven, in the same building as Dick Grayson, known to some as the vigilante hero Nightwing. Two elderly Nazis, wanting revenge on Law, tracked him down, but were defeated by Nightwing. Law tried to spin this out as a plot for a new story, with him as the major protagonist.

Later, the building was burned down by the villain Blockbuster in an attempt to ruin Nightwing&#x27;s life. John Law&#x27;s successor, the new Tarantula, tried to save him, but arrived too late. John Law was presumed to have died, along with 21 other residents. However, his body was never recovered, suggesting that he survived the explosion.

===Catalina Flores===

Catalina Marie Flores grew up in Blüdhaven and witnessed many of the injustices that were carried out throughout the city. This prompted her to leave Blüdhaven and join the FBI in Quantico, Virginia. It is unknown how long she was an agent, but she eventually left the bureau and returned to Blüdhaven. Once there, she learned that her older brother, Assistant D.A. Mateo Flores, was unable to halt the corruption present throughout the city. She seemed to be working for the city herself when she encountered John Law, the first Tarantula, when he visited her office to get his SSI check. She had previously read a book of memoirs featuring the first Tarantula and she wanted him to sign her copy. She then wanted to know everything about John Law during his time as Tarantula.

Catalina first garnered Nightwing&#x27;s attention while attending a self-defense class taught by him and she was able to deliver a blow to his body. Confident and uninhibited, she was eager to learn other various hand-to-hand defensive moves, as well as getting to know more about Grayson on less formal terms. She next caught his eye during her first outings as the second Tarantula. Nightwing was unimpressed with her extreme vigilante methods and forbade her to operate in Blüdhaven. This angered her and she took off, only to be more of a foil for Grayson down the road. During that time, Grayson was investigating the death of Delmore Redhorn, Blüdhaven&#x27;s corrupt Chief of Police, and discovered evidence indicting the new Tarantula as his killer.

Working with Tad Ryerstad (Nite-Wing), Nightwing was able to have Tarantula arrested for the murder of Redhorn, although in the process the wanted vigilante Tad was arrested as well. Mateo was determined to have his sister released, angered that Catalina was arrested with the help of a dubious vigilante. After she was released, Tarantula aided Blockbuster in his revenge campaign on Nightwing. When ordered to kill Grayson&#x27;s girlfriend, Barbara Gordon, she instead manipulated a dinner engagement between the two in such a manner that caused Barbara to break up with Grayson.

Things soon took a turn for the worse when Blockbuster hired other villains to attack those Grayson held dear. Tarantula was devastated as she was unable to stop a bomb explosion in Grayson&#x27;s building complex that was also the home of John Law. Confronted by Lady Vic and warned not to go against Blockbuster&#x27;s wishes, she shot Vic in the chest. Seeking vengeance for John Law&#x27;s demise, Tarantula helped Nightwing record Blockbuster&#x27;s confession, but when she gave the tape to her brother, he crushed it because of a deal he made with Blockbuster to get her out of prison. Tarantula was out on the streets soon enough, and when the battle between Nightwing and Blockbuster heated up, Tarantula involved herself and shot Blockbuster. Nightwing could have prevented the murder, but, driven to the edge of sanity by Blockbuster&#x27;s calculated assaults on everyone whom Nightwing held dear (Blockbuster knew his secret identity and exploited this), in a moment of absolute misery Nightwing stood aside and let Tarantula kill him. Afterwards, wounded and suffering a near-mental breakdown due to Blockbuster&#x27;s attacks as well as his own complicity in the villain&#x27;s murder, Grayson was unable to stop Tarantula from raping him where he fell. Not long after the incident, the two left Blüdhaven, only for Tarantula to face off against Copperhead, who was responsible for killing several local gang leaders. Grayson was able to pull it together long enough to save her from Copperhead. Strong feelings for Grayson had them try to know each other better and she persuaded him to buy a marriage license. Before Grayson could sign anything, Batman summoned him to Gotham. After the events of &quot;War Games&quot;, Nightwing came to his senses and turned in Tarantula and himself for the murder of Blockbuster. He was acquitted of his crimes, however, while Tarantula was imprisoned.

Her fate was unknown during &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; when the Secret Society of Super Villains released Chemo, destroying Bludhaven. Later in &quot;Secret Six&quot;, she was revealed to be alive and well, but was imprisoned at Alcatraz Island. She stole a mysterious card from Junior, a mysterious crime boss who runs all of the West Coast mobs. It was later revealed that she was in possession of a &quot;Get Out of Hell Free&quot; card, forged by Neron. The card is coveted by Junior, who is revealed to be Ragdoll&#x27;s insane sister, who sends an army of supervillains after Tarantula. She eventually sacrifices herself by pulling Junior and herself in front of a combined attack from the assembled villains, killing them both.

Later, she made an appearance in &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; as part of the resistance in an alternative future dominated by Nazis.

====Controversy====
At the end of &quot;Nightwing&quot; (vol. 2) #93 (July 2004), after Tarantula killed Blockbuster, she raped Nightwing on the rooftop. At the time, Nightwing was in shock and undergoing deep emotional trauma. He had also explicitly told Catalina not to touch him, but she proceeded despite this. On the subject, writer Devin Grayson made the following statement: &quot;For the record, I&#x27;ve never used the word &#x27;rape&#x27;, I just said it was non-consensual&quot;. Grayson subsequently apologized for the comment in an interview a decade later, explicitly referring to the act as rape.

==Other characters named Tarantula==
There have been other characters who have used the name Tarantula:

===Mr. Crossart===
The Tarantula name was used by a criminal named Mr. Crossart. He took the wealthy socialite Vivian Dale captive and ran afoul of Sandman. Tarantula was later among the villains that Ian Karkull used to fight the Justice Society of America. He was defeated by Sandman and Sandy the Golden Boy.

===Crime lord===
There is a Tarantula who is a crime lord. His minion Logger suspected that Charles McNider and Doctor Mid-Nite are the same people.

===Franklin Lester===
The Tarantula name was used by Franklin Lester who lost his private investigator license for unknown reasons and became a vigilante who targeted the Masher Mob. He was inspired by the &quot;Tarantula&quot; TV series that his son Gerold watched. This attracted the attention of Superman who tried to stop him from killing the two Masher Mob members. When Lois Lane stumbled upon him, Tarantula attempted to silence her only to be stopped by Superman and the ghost of a secret agent named Simon Cross. Tarantula was then handed over to the police.

===Roger Goldman===
The Tarantula name was also used by Roger Goldman, the former owner of the Evergood Milk Bottling Company. He became a serial killer and an enemy of Sandman.

==In other media==
The Catalina Flores incarnation of Tarantula makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; as one of several villains recruited by the Joker.

<doc id="1322055" wikidata="Q332898" url="?curid=1322055" title="Dead-end tower">
<text>A dead-end tower (also anchor tower, anchor pylon) is a fully self-supporting structure used in construction of overhead power lines. A dead-end transmission tower uses horizontal strain insulators at the end of conductors. Dead-end towers may be used at a substation as a transition to a &quot;slack span&quot; entering the equipment, when the circuit changes to a buried cable, when a transmission line changes direction by more than a few degrees, or at intervals along a straight run to limit the extent of a catastrophic collapse. 

Since dead-end towers require more material and are heavier and costlier than suspension towers, it is uneconomic to build a line with only self-supporting structures.

Dead-end towers are used at regular intervals in a long transmission line to limit the cascading tower failures that might occur after a conductor failure. An in-line dead-end tower will have two sets of strain insulators supporting the lines in either direction, with the lines connected by a jumper between the two segments. Dead-end towers can resist unbalanced forces due to line weight and tension, contrasted with suspension towers which mostly just support the conductor weight and have relatively low capacity for unbalanced load. Dead-end towers may use earth anchor cables to compensate for the asymmetric attachment of the conductors. They are often used when the power line must cross a large gap, such as a railway line, river, or valley.

Dead-end towers may be constructed of the same materials as other structures of the line. They may be steel or aluminum lattice structures, tubular steel, concrete, or wood poles.

==Branch pylon==
Dead-end towers are also employed at branch points as branch pylons. A tower at which the power line runs further as overhead line and as underground cable is a branch tower for a cable branch.

A branch pylon is used to start a line branch. The branch pylon is responsible for holding up both the main line and the start of the branch line. This makes a branch pylon also an anchor pylon since it must resist forces from both lines.

Branch pylons frequently, but not always, have one or more cross beams transverse to the direction of travel of the line for the admission of the branching electric circuits; some also have cross beams of the branching electric circuits lying in the direction of travel of the main line. Branch pylons without additional cross beams are occasionally constructed.
==Termination pylon==
A special kind of a dead-end tower is a termination pylon, also called a terminal tower. It is used when the overhead power line terminates, and is connected to substation equipment, or transitions to underground cable.
For voltages below 30 kV also pylon transformers are used.

==Long spans==
For crossings of large bodies of water, wide freeways, or valleys, where the span width of the conductors is very long, specific constructions must be used to achieve a wider distance between the conductors, mostly to prevent short-circuits which may occur when conductors come in contact with one another due to wind or other interferences. These towers may be built as H-frame towers, or may have each conductor placed on a single tower or mast. In every case, these towers are built more stable than most of the other towers used, as the wide span between towers means that much greater forces are placed on these towers.

==Switch pylon==
Anchor pylons may also have a switch attached to their crossbeam. These so-called switch pylons are operated from the ground by the use of long rods. The attachment of circuit breakers to pylons is only practical when voltages are less than 50 kV.

==Sequences==
Sequences of two or more strainer pylons are uncommon in a powerline because strainers require twice as many strain insulators as ordinary pylons. Longer wire sections thus reduce installation work and cost. Sequences of strainers are sometimes used at powerlines crossing valleys, or where the powerline runs a path with curves.

<text>Waiata (released as Corroboree in Australia) is the seventh studio album by New Zealand new wave band Split Enz, released in March 1981. &quot;Waiata&quot; is the Māori term for song and singing, while &quot;corroboree&quot; is an Aboriginal term. According to Noel Crombie the intention was to name the album using a word from the natives of every country it was released in. This did not go ahead and the only country to adopt this change was Australia. The rest of the world kept the New Zealand title &quot;Waiata&quot;.

The songs &quot;History Never Repeats&quot; and &quot;One Step Ahead&quot; were among the first music videos aired on MTV when the cable television channel launched in the United States in 1981.

<text>In mathematics, an integral curve is a parametric curve that represents a specific solution to an ordinary differential equation or system of equations.

==Name==
Integral curves are known by various other names, depending on the nature and interpretation of the differential equation or vector field. In physics, integral curves for an electric field or magnetic field are known as &quot;field lines&quot;, and integral curves for the velocity field of a fluid are known as &quot;streamlines&quot;. In dynamical systems, the integral curves for a differential equation that governs a system are referred to as &quot;trajectories&quot; or &quot;orbits&quot;.

==Definition==
Suppose that F is a static vector field, that is, a vector-valued function with Cartesian coordinates (&quot;F&quot;1,&quot;F&quot;2...,&quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;), and that x(&quot;t&quot;) is a parametric curve with Cartesian coordinates (&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;t&quot;),&quot;x&quot;2(&quot;t&quot;)...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)). Then x(&quot;t&quot;) is an integral curve of F if it is a solution of the autonomous system of ordinary differential equations,
:formula_1
Such a system may be written as a single vector equation,
:formula_2
This equation says that the vector tangent to the curve at any point x(&quot;t&quot;) along the curve is precisely the vector F(x(&quot;t&quot;)), and so the curve x(&quot;t&quot;) is tangent at each point to the vector field F.

If a given vector field is Lipschitz continuous, then the Picard–Lindelöf theorem implies that there exists a unique flow for small time.
==Examples==

If the differential equation is represented as a vector field or slope field, then the corresponding integral curves are tangent to the field at each point.

==Generalization to differentiable manifolds==
===Definition===

Let &quot;M&quot; be a Banach manifold of class &quot;C&quot;&quot;r&quot; with &quot;r&quot; ≥ 2. As usual, T&quot;M&quot; denotes the tangent bundle of &quot;M&quot; with its natural projection &quot;π&quot;&quot;M&quot; : T&quot;M&quot; → &quot;M&quot; given by

:formula_3

A vector field on &quot;M&quot; is a cross-section of the tangent bundle T&quot;M&quot;, i.e. an assignment to every point of the manifold &quot;M&quot; of a tangent vector to &quot;M&quot; at that point. Let &quot;X&quot; be a vector field on &quot;M&quot; of class &quot;C&quot;&quot;r&quot;−1 and let &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;. An integral curve for &quot;X&quot; passing through &quot;p&quot; at time &quot;t&quot;0 is a curve &quot;α&quot; : &quot;J&quot; → &quot;M&quot; of class &quot;C&quot;&quot;r&quot;−1, defined on an open interval &quot;J&quot; of the real line R containing &quot;t&quot;0, such that

:formula_4
:formula_5

===Relationship to ordinary differential equations===

The above definition of an integral curve &quot;α&quot; for a vector field &quot;X&quot;, passing through &quot;p&quot; at time &quot;t&quot;0, is the same as saying that &quot;α&quot; is a local solution to the ordinary differential equation/initial value problem

:formula_4
:formula_7

It is local in the sense that it is defined only for times in &quot;J&quot;, and not necessarily for all &quot;t&quot; ≥ &quot;t&quot;0 (let alone &quot;t&quot; ≤ &quot;t&quot;0). Thus, the problem of proving the existence and uniqueness of integral curves is the same as that of finding solutions to ordinary differential equations/initial value problems and showing that they are unique.

===Remarks on the time derivative===

In the above, &quot;α&quot;′(&quot;t&quot;) denotes the derivative of &quot;α&quot; at time &quot;t&quot;, the &quot;direction &quot;α&quot; is pointing&quot; at time &quot;t&quot;. From a more abstract viewpoint, this is the Fréchet derivative:

:formula_8

In the special case that &quot;M&quot; is some open subset of R&quot;n&quot;, this is the familiar derivative

:formula_9

where &quot;α&quot;1, ..., &quot;α&quot;&quot;n&quot; are the coordinates for &quot;α&quot; with respect to the usual coordinate directions.

The same thing may be phrased even more abstractly in terms of induced maps. Note that the tangent bundle T&quot;J&quot; of &quot;J&quot; is the trivial bundle &quot;J&quot; × R and there is a canonical cross-section &quot;ι&quot; of this bundle such that &quot;ι&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = 1 (or, more precisely, (&quot;t&quot;, 1) ∈ &quot;ι&quot;) for all &quot;t&quot; ∈ &quot;J&quot;. The curve &quot;α&quot; induces a bundle map &quot;α&quot;∗ : T&quot;J&quot; → T&quot;M&quot; so that the following diagram commutes:

Then the time derivative &quot;α&quot;′ is the composition &quot;α&quot;′ = &quot;α&quot;∗ &quot;ι&quot;, and &quot;α&quot;′(&quot;t&quot;) is its value at some point &quot;t&quot; ∈ &quot;J&quot;.

<text>Gabaldon , officially the Municipality of Gabaldon (, Ilocano: &quot;Ili ti Gabaldon&quot;), is a municipality in the province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 38,958 people.

==Etymology==
On June 16, 1955, the town&#x27;s name was changed from Sabani to Gabaldon in honor of the former provincial governor and Philippine Resident Commissioner Isauro Gabaldón.

==History==
During the latter half of the 19th century, Gabaldon was the site of the &quot;Sabani Estate,&quot; the largest hacienda in Nueva Ecija, which was then part of Laur. The estate possessed 3,000 heads of cattle and occupied more than 6,000 hectares. Ilocano, Pangasinese, Tagalog, &amp; Kapampangan settlers arrived from different places like the neighboring provinces of Tarlac, Pangasinan, and Pampanga. On May 10, 1920, the national government, through the National Development Company, took over the administration of the estate and developed it for rice production. A group composed of local businessmen leased the estate until 1935, after which it was returned to Sabani Estate Development Company. The government then converted the estate into a homestead.

On June 12, 1950, the barrios of Bitulok, Bantug, Bitulok Saw Mill, Cuyapa, Macasandal, Pantok, Calumpang, Malinao, Tagumpay, Bugnan, Bagong Sicat, Ligaya, Calabasa, Bateria and Pintong Bagting were separated from Laur to constitute the new municipality of &quot;Bitulok&quot;.

The municipality&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;Bitulok&quot; to &quot;Sabani&quot;. On June 16, 1955, the municipality&#x27;s name was changed from Sabani to Gabaldon by virtue of &quot;Republic Act 1318&quot;, to honor former provincial governor and Philippine Resident Commissioner Isauro Gabaldón.

==Geography==
The municipality is located in the valley situated at the footstep of the Sierra Madre to its east and the Caraballo Mountains to its west. It lies from Palayan, from Manila, and from Baler. Gabaldon is bounded by Bongabon to the north, Laur to the west, General Tinio to the south, and Dingalan to the east.

===Barangays===
Gabaldon is politically subdivided into 16 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.
* Bagong Sikat
* Bagting
* Bantug
* Bitulok (North Poblacion)
* Bugnan
* Calabasa
* Camachile
* Cuyapa
* Ligaya
* Macasandal
* Malinao
* Pantoc
* Pinamalisan
* South Poblacion
* Sawmill
* Tagumpay
===Climate===

==Demographics==


== Economy ==

Agriculture is the main economic source of the municipality, with 56% of its land area being used for farming. Rice is the primary crop being cultivated in the municipality&#x27;s lowland while secondary crops such as onion, corn, garlic, ampalaya, and other crops are cultivated in the uplands. The municipality is one of the top onion producers in the province. Limited livestock, poultry, and fish production are also present.

The municipality has nearly 300 commercial establishments mostly centered along the national road and around the municipal public market. Moreover, there are 6 agri-based industrial establishments within the city, including 5 rice mills and a commercial poultry, and 20 cottage industry establishments.

==Tourism==

Due to Gabaldon&#x27;s proximity to the coastal town of Dingalan, Aurora and its scenic location in the valley, there are several ecological tourist spots found in the municipality, including the Dupinga Water Reservoir, the Sierra Madre, Cabangcalan Lake, and multiple waterfalls dotting the southeastern part of the Sierra Madre. Numerous resorts are in the municipality, including the Ecopark located inside the Gabaldon campus of the Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology.

<text>Arena Wars is an action and real-time strategy game released by Tri Synergy and Ascaron Entertainment in 2004.

==Gameplay==
The game is notable for combining strategy and shooter elements in gameplay. The limited unit choices (6) and specials (one for each unit) make the game extremely balanced. There are no resources needed to build units, as every player has exactly 1000 credits. Building units uses credits, but a player that loses a unit regains the money instantly and can rebuild it (or another unit), penalized only by the time taken to rebuild. Players also do not construct buildings, but use buildings located at fixed positions on the map. Players win the game by completing one of three objectives, depending on the game type:
* Capture the Flag - stealing the flag from an opposing base
* Bombing Run - carrying a bomb into an opposing base
* Double Domination - controlling &quot;domination zones&quot; for a period of time

As opposing players have equal options, high-level strategy, fast decision making, and precise micromanagement are key factors for success.

==Development==
&quot;Arena Wars&quot; was the first commercial game to utilize the .NET Framework; however, it used a managed OpenGL wrapper rather than the XNA Framework/Direct3D API.

==Remake==
Arena Wars Reloaded, developed br exDream and published by Ascaron Entertainment, was released on June 22, 2007 for PC and combines elements of real-time strategy and action elements, like its predecessor. The game carries many of the original overall game structure with improvements in graphics and a more stable game engine.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

<text>Eric Burgess (1920 – March 2005) was an English freelance consultant, lecturer and journalist, who wrote about the Pioneer program of space missions since the first tests in 1957. He was the science correspondent of the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; during many of the planetary probe launches, and was often the senior science reporter present at many of them.

Burgess is credited with the original idea that the Pioneer probes should carry a message for extraterrestrial intelligences. He approached Carl Sagan about his idea, which eventually resulted in the Pioneer plaque. Burgess was a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and British Interplanetary Society, and an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

Burgess and Arthur C. Clarke were both charter members of the British Interplanetary Society and lifelong friends. While Clarke claimed he invented the idea of using three satellites in geostationary orbit to create the global communication relay in common use (book dust jacket front fold-over sleeve of &quot;The Exploration of Space&quot;, A.C. Clarke, Harper Bros., 1951), Burgess claimed to have given the idea to Clarke in the late 1940s. Shortly before his death Burgess had a large collection of film and printed media on the subject of rocketry and space exploration that may have been donated by his heirs to a local library. Perhaps his greatest contribution other than the claim of having the idea for geosynchronous satellite communication networks (disputed with characteristic droll humor by Clarke) was his chronicling of the initial exploration of the solar system (re: bibliography). He was also the science adviser for the James Bond film &quot;Moonraker&quot; which received an Academy Award nomination for its visuals which Burgess helped edit for accuracy.

<text>A distribution transformer or service transformer provides a final voltage transformation in the electric power distribution system, stepping down the voltage used in the distribution lines to the level used by the customer.
The invention of a practical, efficient transformer made AC power distribution feasible; a system using distribution transformers was demonstrated as early as 1882.

If mounted on a utility pole, they are called pole-mount transformers. Suppose the distribution lines are located at ground level or underground. In that case, distribution transformers are mounted on concrete pads and locked in steel cases, thus known as distribution tap pad-mount transformers.

Distribution transformers typically have ratings less than 200 kVA, although some national standards allow units up to 5000 kVA to be described as distribution transformers. Since distribution transformers are energized 24 hours a day (even when they don&#x27;t carry any load), reducing iron losses is vital in their design. They usually don&#x27;t operate at full load, so they are designed to have maximum efficiency at lower loads. To have better efficiency, voltage regulation in these transformers should be kept to a minimum. Hence, they are designed to have small leakage reactance.

==Types==

Distribution transformers are classified into different categories based on factors such as:
* Mounting location – pole, pad, underground vault
* Type of insulation – liquid-immersed or dry-type 
* Number of phases – single-phase or three-phase 
* Voltage class 
* Basic impulse insulation level (BIL).
==Use==
Distribution transformers are normally located at a service drop, where wires run from a utility pole or underground power lines to a customer&#x27;s premises. They are often used for the power supply of facilities outside settlements, such as isolated houses, farmyards, or pumping stations at voltages below 30 kV. Another application is the power supply of the overhead wire of railways electrified with AC. In this case, single-phase distribution transformers are used.

The number of customers fed by a single distribution transformer varies depending on the number of customers in an area. Several homes may be fed from a single transformer in urban areas; depending on the mains voltage, rural distribution may require one transformer per customer. A large commercial or industrial complex will have multiple distribution transformers. In urban areas and neighborhoods where primary distribution lines run underground, padmount transformers, and locked metal enclosures are mounted on a concrete pad. Many large buildings have electric service provided at primary distribution voltage. These buildings have customer-owned transformers in the basement for step-down purposes.

Distribution transformers are also found in wind farm power collection networks, where they step up power from each wind turbine to connect to a substation that may be several miles (kilometers) distant.

==Connections==


Both pole-mounted and pad-mounted transformers convert the overhead or underground distribution lines&#x27; high &#x27;primary&#x27; voltage to the lower &#x27;secondary&#x27; or &#x27;utilization&#x27; voltage inside the building. The primary distribution wires use the three-phase system. Main distribution lines always have three &#x27;hot&#x27; wires plus an optional neutral. In the North American system, where single-phase transformers connect to only one phase wire, smaller &#x27;lateral&#x27; lines branching off on side roads may include only one or two &#x27;hot&#x27; phase wires. (When only one phase wire exists, a neutral will always be provided as a return path.) Primaries provide power at the standard distribution voltages used in the area; these range from as low as 2.3 kV to about 35 kV depending on local distribution practice and standards, often 11 kV (50 Hz systems) and 13.8 kV (60 Hz systems) are used, but many other voltages are standard. For example, in the United States, the most common voltage is 12.47 kV, with a line-to-ground voltage of 7.2 kV. It has a 7.2 kV phase-to-neutral voltage, exactly 30 times the 240 V on the split-phase secondary side.

===Primary===

The high-voltage primary windings are brought out to bushings on the top of the case. 
*Single-phase transformers, generally used in the North American system, are attached to the overhead distribution wires with two different types of connections:
**Wye – A &#x27;wye&#x27; or &#x27;phase to neutral&#x27; transformer is used on a wye distribution circuit. A single-phase wye transformer usually has only one bushing on top, connected to one of the three primary phases. The other end of the primary winding is connected to the transformer case, which is connected to the neutral wire of the wye system and is also grounded. A wye distribution system is preferred because the transformers present unbalanced loads on the line that cause currents in the neutral wire and are then grounded. However, with a delta distribution system, the unbalanced loads can cause variations in the voltages on the 3-phase wires.
**Delta – A &#x27;delta&#x27; or &#x27;phase to phase&#x27; transformer is used on a delta distribution circuit. A single-phase delta transformer has two bushings connected to two of the three primary wires, so the primary winding sees the phase-to-phase voltage; this avoids returning primary current through a neutral that must be solidly grounded to keep its voltage near earth&#x27;s potential. Since the neutral is also provided to customers, this is a significant safety advantage in a dry area like California, where soil conductivity is low. The main disadvantage is higher cost, e.g., needing at least two insulated &#x27;hot&#x27; phase wires even on a branch circuit. Another minor disadvantage is that if only one of the primary phases is disconnected upstream, it will remain live as the transformers try to return current. It could be a hazard to line workers.
*Transformers providing three-phase secondary power, used for residential service in the European system, have three primary windings attached to all three primary phase wires. The windings are almost always connected in a &#x27;wye&#x27; configuration, with the ends connected and grounded.
The transformer is always connected to the primary distribution lines through protective fuses and disconnect switches. For pole-mounted transformers, this is usually a &#x27;fused cutout.&#x27; An electrical fault melts the fuse, and the device drops open to give a visual indication of trouble. Lineworkers can also manually open it while the line is energized using insulated hot sticks. In some cases, completely self-protected transformers are used, which have a circuit breaker built in, so a fused cutout isn&#x27;t needed.

===Secondary===

The low-voltage secondary windings are attached to three or four terminals on the transformer&#x27;s side.
*In North American residences and small businesses, the secondary is often the split-phase 120/240-volt system. The 240 V secondary winding is center-tapped, and the center neutral wire is grounded, making the two end conductors &quot;hot&quot; concerning the center tap. These three wires run down the service drop to the building&#x27;s electric meter and service panel. Connecting a load between the hot wire and the neutral gives 120 volts, which is used for lighting circuits. Connecting both hot wires gives 240 volts for heavy loads such as air conditioners, ovens, dryers, and electric vehicle charging stations.
*In Europe and other countries using its system, the secondary is often the three-phase 400Y/230 system. There are three 230 V secondary windings, each receiving power from a primary winding attached to one of the primary phases. One end of each secondary winding is connected to a &#x27;neutral&#x27; wire, which is grounded. The other end of the three secondary windings and the neutral are brought down the service drop to the service panel. 230 V loads are connected between any of the three-phase wires and the neutral. Because the phases are 120 degrees from each other, the voltage between any two phases is sqrt(3) * 230V = 400V, compared to the 2 * 120V = 240V in the North American split phase system. While three-phase power is almost unheard of in individual North American residences, it is common in Europe for heavy loads such as kitchen stoves, air conditioners, and electric vehicle chargers.

==Construction==
Distribution transformers consist of a magnetic core made from laminations of sheet silicon steel (transformer steel) stacked and either glued together with resin or banded together with steel straps, with the primary and secondary wire windings wrapped around them. This core construction is designed to reduce core losses and dissipation of magnetic energy as heat in the core, an economically important cause of power loss in utility grids. Two effects cause core losses: hysteresis loss in the steel and eddy currents. Silicon steel has low hysteresis loss, and the laminated construction prevents eddy currents from flowing in the core, which dissipates power in the resistance of the steel. The efficiency of typical distribution transformers is between about 98 and 99 percent. Where large numbers of transformers are made to standard designs, a wound C-shaped core is economical to manufacture. A steel strip is wrapped around a former, pressed into shape, and then cut into two C-shaped halves re-assembled on the copper windings.

The primary coils are wound from enamel-coated copper or aluminum wire, and the high-current, low-voltage secondaries are wound using a thick ribbon of aluminum or copper. The windings are insulated with resin-impregnated paper. The entire assembly is baked to cure the resin and then submerged in a powder-coated steel tank, which is then filled with transformer oil (or other insulating liquid), which is inert and non-conductive. The transformer oil cools and insulates the windings and protects them from moisture. The tank is temporarily evacuated during manufacture to remove any remaining moisture that would cause arcing and is sealed against the weather with a gasket at the top.

Formerly, distribution transformers for indoor use would be filled with a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) liquid. Because these chemicals persist in the environment and adversely affect on animals, they have been banned. Other fire-resistant liquids such as silicones are used where a liquid-filled transformer must be used indoors. Certain vegetable oils have been applied as transformer oil; these have the advantage of a high fire point and are completely biodegradable in the environment.

Pole-mounted transformers often include accessories such as surge arresters or protective fuse links. A self-protected transformer consists of an internal fuse and surge arrester; other transformers have these components mounted separately outside the tank. Pole-mounted transformers may have lugs allowing direct mounting to a pole or may be mounted on cross-arms bolted to the pole. Aerial transformers, larger than around 75 kVA, may be mounted on a platform supported by one or more poles. A three-phase service may use three identical transformers, one per phase.

Transformers designed for below-grade installation can be designed for periodic submersion in water.

Distribution transformers may include an off-load tap changer, which slightly adjusts the ratio between primary and secondary voltage to bring the customer&#x27;s voltage within the desired range on long or heavily loaded lines.

Pad-mounted transformers have secure locked, bolted&#x27; and grounded metal enclosures to discourage unauthorized access to live internal parts. The enclosure may also include fuses, isolating switches, load-break bushings, and other accessories as described in technical standards. Pad-mounted transformers for distribution systems typically range from around 100 to 2000 kVA, although some larger units are also used.

==Placement==

In the United States, distribution transformers are often installed outdoors on wooden poles.

In Europe, it is most common to place them in buildings. If the feeding lines are overhead, these look like towers. If all lines running to the transformer are underground, small buildings are used. In rural areas, sometimes distribution transformers are mounted on poles, and the pole is usually made of concrete or iron due to the weight of the transformer.

<doc id="1322123" wikidata="Q296887" url="?curid=1322123" title="Freddie Highmore">
<text>Alfred Thomas Highmore (born 14 February 1992) is an English actor. He is known for his starring roles beginning as a child, in the films &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; (2004), &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2005), &quot;Arthur and the Invisibles &quot;(2006), &quot;August Rush&quot; (2007), &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot; (2008), and &quot;Astro Boy&quot; (2009). He won two consecutive Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards for Best Young Performer and received two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.

Highmore starred as Norman Bates in the drama-thriller series &quot;Bates Motel&quot; (2013–2017), for which he was nominated three times for the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series and won a People&#x27;s Choice Award, and Dr. Shaun Murphy in the ABC drama series &quot;The Good Doctor&quot; (2017–2024), for which he also served as a producer and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.

==Early life==
Highmore was born on 14 February 1992 in Camden Town, London. His mother, Sue Latimer, is a talent agent whose clients include actors Daniel Radcliffe and Imelda Staunton. His father is the former actor Edward Highmore.

Highmore was educated at The Brookland Junior and Infant school in Hampstead Garden Suburb near Golders Green in the London Borough of Barnet until the age of 11 and gained a scholarship to attend Highgate School, an independent school in Highgate, London.

In November 2007, Highmore moved to North London.

In 2008, Highmore received A* grades in English language and English literature, maths, Spanish, French, Latin, geography, biology, chemistry, and physics in his GCSE exams. In 2010, Highmore once again achieved A* grades in maths, further maths, French, and Spanish in his A-level exams.

From 2010 to 2014, Highmore attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he earned a double first in Spanish and Arabic. He also enrolled at the London School of Economics to study finance at summer school during the summer break at Cambridge in 2011. Highmore worked at Gulf Bank in Kuwait as an intern in 2012 and at a law firm in Madrid during his year abroad while filming the first two seasons of &quot;Bates Motel&quot;, which made him briefly consider becoming a lawyer after graduation.

==Career==

===Early career as a child actor (1999–2004)===
Highmore began his acting career with small roles on television at the age of 7. He made his film debut in Coky Giedroyc&#x27;s comedy &quot;Women Talking Dirty&quot; (1999), playing the son of a woman who has recently become estranged from her commitment-phobic French lover. In 2001, Highmore played a young King Arthur in the TNT miniseries &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, a take on the Arthurian legends that depicted the women of Camelot as the real power behind the throne.

In 2001, in the BBC miniseries &quot;Happy Birthday Shakespeare&quot;, he portrayed a young boy who dreams of moving his family to Stratford-upon-Avon. Highmore has acted alongside members of his family in two separate films: he and his brother played siblings in &quot;Women Talking Dirty&quot;, and he and his father played a father and son in Hallmark Entertainment&#x27;s television film &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story&quot; (2001).

In 2004, Highmore returned to the big screen for the family adventure film &quot;Two Brothers&quot;, directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud. He played the son of a French administrator who refuses to believe that his new friend, a tiger cub named Sangha, might be dangerous after having tasted blood. He next had a major role in the fantasy film &quot;Five Children and It&quot; (2004). That same year, Highmore made his breakthrough with a critically acclaimed performance as Peter Llewelyn Davies in Marc Forster&#x27;s semi-biographical film &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;. He received several awards and nominations for the role, including a Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Young Performer, and nominations for the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role.

===Young adult roles (2005–2011)===

In 2005, he portrayed the main role of Charlie Bucket in Tim Burton&#x27;s musical fantasy film &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, adapted from the book of the same name by Roald Dahl. He was reportedly recommended by co-star Johnny Depp, with whom Highmore had worked in &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;; Depp had been impressed by the young actor&#x27;s performance and thus put his name forward for the role. Highmore had not seen the original 1971 version of the film, and decided not to see it until he was done filming so his portrayal of Charlie would not be influenced. For his role, he again won the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Young Performer and was awarded the Satellite Award for Outstanding New Talent. Highmore also lent his voice to the film&#x27;s accompanying video game of the same name.

He next appeared as a young Max Skinner in Ridley Scott&#x27;s comedy-drama film &quot;A Good Year&quot;, which was released in the UK on 27 October 2006. Also in 2006, he began portraying protagonist Arthur Montgomery in the live-action/animated fantasy adventure film &quot;Arthur and the Invisibles&quot;, released on 13 December 2006. Two sequels followed: &quot;Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard&quot; (2009) and &quot;Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds&quot; (2010). For the third film and the trilogy&#x27;s accompanying video game, Highmore provided voice acting. In 2007, he lent his voice to the adventure fantasy film &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; (2007) and its video game of the same name. He then portrayed the title character in the drama film &quot;August Rush&quot; (2007). The story follows a musical prodigy as he searches for his birth parents. This film received a wide release on 21 November 2007.

Highmore next starred in the dual role of American twins Simon Grace and Jared Grace in the fantasy adventure film &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot; (2008), based on the popular children&#x27;s stories of the same name by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black. The film also had a video game of the same name in which Highmore reprised the characters of Simon and Jared in a voice role. That same year, he provided voice acting for the role of Little Jack in the animated film &quot;A Fox&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2008). In 2009, Highmore voiced the lead character in the animated film &quot;Astro Boy&quot; and provided his voice to its accompanying video game, &quot;Astro Boy: The Video Game&quot;. He then played the main role in &quot;Toast&quot;, a BBC biographical film about chef Nigel Slater, which was aired on 30 December 2010. Also in 2010, he starred as Hally Ballard in the drama film &quot;Master Harold...and the Boys&quot;, based on the play of the same name by Athol Fugard. The following year, he co-starred in the romantic comedy-drama &quot;The Art of Getting By&quot; (2011).

===&quot;Bates Motel&quot; and &quot;The Good Doctor&quot; (2012–2017)===

In 2013, Highmore voiced the title character in the animated adventure film &quot;Justin and the Knights of Valour&quot;. From 2013 to 2017, he portrayed the iconic role of Norman Bates in the A&amp;E drama-thriller series &quot;Bates Motel&quot;, a prequel to the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Psycho&quot; that restarts the storyline in the present day. He won a People&#x27;s Choice Award in 2017 for his performance, and has received nominations for the Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television (2013), the Satellite Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama (2013), and the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series (2014–2015, and 2017). Highmore ventured into writing and directing during his time working on the series, writing the fourth season episode &quot;Unfaithful&quot; and the fifth season episode &quot;Inseparable&quot;, and directing the fifth-season episode &quot;The Body&quot;.

In August 2014, it was reported that NBC had purchased a comedy pilot script written and executive produced by Highmore and &quot;Bates Motel&quot; showrunner Kerry Ehrin. In 2015, he appeared in the Libertines&#x27; music video for &quot;You&#x27;re My Waterloo&quot;. In 2016, Highmore starred in Stephen Poliakoff&#x27;s BBC Two seven-part miniseries &quot;Close to the Enemy&quot; and Nick Hamm&#x27;s political comedy-drama film &quot;The Journey&quot;.

In 2017, Highmore took on the lead role of Dr. Shaun Murphy, an autistic savant, in the ABC drama series &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series for his performance. He serves as an executive producer and director on the show, and wrote the second season episode &quot;Hello&quot;.

Highmore has been cast as the voice of the Duke of Cheshire in the animated film adaptation of &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot;. He is to play the title character, Baby Face Nelson, in the A&amp;E drama pilot &quot;Baby Face&quot;, which he co-wrote and will executive produce with Kerry Ehrin. Highmore will also serve as an executive producer on Ehrin&#x27;s drama pilot &quot;Long Distance&quot; for NBC.

===Screenwriting and producing (2018–present)===
In August 2018, Highmore formed his Sony-aligned production company, Alfresco Pictures, which aims to develop scripted series for broadcast, cable, streaming services, and international co-productions projects &quot;that have a broader point or message behind them, that try and spark conversations that aren&#x27;t being had or give a microphone to voices and experiences that haven&#x27;t been heard from before.&quot;. &quot;I hope &#x27;Alfresco&#x27;, aside from being a play on my real name, Alfred, speaks more widely to a sense of refreshing, communal openness that is reflective of the stories we gravitate towards at the company,&quot; he said. &quot;In wanting to set up &#x27;Alfresco&#x27;, it came from a natural desire to be involved in a wider way in the industry ... I always had that natural curiosity to do other things. And that, I guess, shifted into not only wanting to develop my own ideas and projects that I was writing or directing or acting in, but also becoming a producer in a wider sense and helping other people tell their stories.&quot;

In August 2019, it was reported that Highmore will co-write and serve as an executive producer for &quot;Homesick&quot;, a dark comedy in development at the WarnerMedia-owned cable net, which will explore mental health, body image, toxic masculinity and what it means to defy &quot;normal&quot; gender expectations.

==Personal life==
Highmore lives in London and avoids social media. While on &quot;Bates Motel&quot;, Highmore developed a close friendship with co-star Vera Farmiga and became godfather to her son.

Apart from his native English, Highmore is fluent in French and Spanish, and semi-fluent in Arabic.

In a September 2021 interview on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, Highmore revealed that he had recently married Klarissa Munz.

<doc id="1322128" wikidata="Q999094" url="?curid=1322128" title="Lat Phrao district">
<text>Lat Phrao (, , ) is one of the 50 districts (&quot;khet&quot;) of Bangkok, Thailand. The district is bound by six other districts (from north clockwise): Bang Khen, Bueng Kum, Bang Kapi, Wang Thonglang, and Chatuchak.

==History==
Formerly, Lat Phrao was a tambon of Bang Kapi district, in what was then Phra Nakhon province, before the unification of Thonburi and Phra Nakhon into the single administrative area of Krung Thep (Bangkok). Later it was a sub-district (tambon) of the Bang Kapi District (amphoe), after naming conventions were changed for administrative districts of Bangkok.

On 4 September 1989, Lat Phrao was split off from Bang Kapi along with Bueng Kum as new districts.

In 1997, the boundaries of Lat Phrao District were modified to balance the size and population of Bangkok&#x27;s districts. The portion of Chorake Bua sub-district north of Khok Khram and Ta Reng canals was reassigned to Bang Khen district, and portions of the Lat Phrao sub-district were added to Wang Thonglang district.

On 24 January 2002, portions of Wang Thonglang District were reassigned to Lat Phrao Sub-district.

The word &quot;Lat Phrao&quot; literally means &#x27;slope of coconut&#x27;. The district seal features a coconut putting forth two fresh leaves, assumed the district used to be full of coconut orchards.

==Administration==
The district is divided into two sub-districts (&quot;khwaeng&quot;).
==District council==
The district council for Lat Phrao has seven members, who each serve four-year terms. Elections were last held on 30 April 2006. The results were seven seats for the Thai Rak Thai Party.

<text>PK Porthcurno is a museum located in the small coastal village of Porthcurno Cornwall, UK. Porthcurno was the point at which many submarine telegraph cables—transatlantic and to other locations—came ashore. The first cables were direct current impulse transmitters. The first cables with transistor amplifiers were laid in the 1950s.

The museum, which opened in May 1998, is housed in the former telegraph facility.

==History==
In June 1870, the Falmouth, Gibraltar &amp; Malta Telegraph Company of John Pender (which had been established in July 1869, with capital of £660,000 (in 1870s money)) landed the final section of the first Great Britain-India submarine cable in Porthcurno. The cable section between Carcavelos and Porthcurno was laid by the &quot;Hibernia&quot;, with the shore-end being laid by the Anchor Line ship &quot;Investigator&quot;. On 23 June, the first message was sent from Bombay to Pender’s house on Arlington Street, London, where he was holding a party attended by the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VII. It was received using the siphon recorder of Sir William Thomson. Next day, the line opened to public traffic.

What became the world’s largest submarine telegraph station was founded at Porthcurno, initially with a staff of 16 young men. Often in early days, these young men were badly behaved and ill-disciplined.

Further cables to Newfoundland, France, Spain, and Gibraltar were landed at Porthcurno, which became the gateway to the Empire.

At the outbreak of World War II, the existing surface installations were thought to be far too vulnerable to attack, and in 1941, miners were employed to cut tunnels into the solid granite of the valley&#x27;s hillside to house the telegraphy equipment. Porthcurno telegraphy facility closed in 1970, 100 years after it first began its operations.

Modern cables are usually fibre optic and are much lighter in construction, international information is now made available of the locations of submarine cables.

==Museum development==
The museum was started by former employees of Cable and Wireless based at the company&#x27;s Holborn headquarters in London. It is now located in the previously excavated tunnels near Porthcurno beach, Cornwall. The layout of the museum display was carried out after receiving a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
The museum has displays showing the history of submarine cable-laying ships and telegraphy, and a variety of samples of undersea telegraph cable designs used throughout its long history. The museum has a varied collection of still-working equipment designed for telegraphy. It remained a training college for the communications industry until 1993. An Exeter University project known as &quot;Connecting Cornwall&quot; was funded to promote a new exhibition; &quot;The Nerve Centre of Empire&quot;. This was opened in the summer of 2010 by the Princess Royal. The exhibition was developed as an educational experience for children and young people, employing original design from local artist, Hennie Haworth. There are now around 16 people working at the museum, welcoming visitors from around the world and managing with a constant flow of research enquiries from academics, family historians, local historians and the media. The most recent chapter in the museum&#x27;s development involves the sensitive re-development of the Grade II listed buildings to accommodate greater exhibitions space, and improved visitor facilities including a cafe and greater accessibility. The project, &#x27;Developing for the Future&#x27;, has been supported by Heritage Lottery Fund, the Arts Council England, Coastal Communities Fund, SubOptic, the Charles Hayward Foundation. Department for Culture, Media and Sport/Wolfson Museums and Galleries Improvement Fund, ShareGift, the Edith Murphy Foundation, the Garfield Weston Foundation, The Headley Trust, Cornwall Council and the Trusthouse Charitable Foundation. Further funding was provided by the Clore Duffield Foundation for the development of a new, flexible educational centre; the Clore Learning Space. As a result of this extensive capital project, the museum closed to the public in September 2013 and reopened in summer 2014. In 2020, it was rebranded as PK Porthcurno: Museum of Global Communications.

In March 2022, the museum was the subject of an episode of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s series &quot;The Museums That Make Us&quot;, presented by Neil MacGregor.

==Collection==
The museum’s collection has designated status. It consists of a large photographic collection and the archives of Cable &amp; Wireless plc, as well as models of cable ships, paintings, company staff magazines, cable samples (including the first transatlantic telephone cable TAT-1), and a range of telegraphic equipment.

==Museum staff and volunteers==
The museum has around 16 professional staff, mostly full-time, and a large volunteer community. Many of the museum&#x27;s technical volunteers trained or taught at the Porthcurno technical training college at some point in its history, prior to its eventual closure in 1993.

==Awards==
The museum has won a number of awards since opening. These include:
* Cultural Enterprises Awards 2020: Green Award
* Cornwall Tourism Awards 2018/19: Gold – Small Attraction of the Year
* South West England Tourism Excellence Awards 2018–2019: Highly Commended – Small Attraction of the Year

<doc id="1322198" wikidata="Q5532092" url="?curid=1322198" title="General Pershing Zephyr">
<text>The General Pershing Zephyr was the ninth of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Zephyr&quot; streamliners, and the last built as an integrated streamliner rather than a train hauled by an EMD E-unit diesel locomotive. It was constructed in 1939 with bodywork and passenger cars by Budd Company and diesel engine, electric transmission, power truck, and other locomotive equipment by General Motors Electro-Motive Corporation. Because its intended Kansas City to St Louis route passed near the birthplace and boyhood home of famous World War I General John J. Pershing, the train was named after him. The power car was named &quot;Silver Charger&quot;, after Pershing&#x27;s horse &quot;Charger&quot;, while the passenger cars were named after United States Army badges of rank—&quot;Silver Leaf&quot;, &quot;Silver Eagle&quot;, and &quot;Silver Star&quot;.

The train replaced the &quot;Ozark State Zephyr&quot;, which had been inaugurated three years earlier. In September, 1938, a second set was added, the 9903, which had previously served as the &quot;Mark Twain Zephyr&quot; running between Burlington, Iowa and St Louis via Samuel Clemens&#x27; birthplace of Hannibal, Missouri. The &quot;Ozark State&quot; service inaugurated operating out of Kansas City in the morning and St Louis in the afternoon, with the second trainset alternating. The new equipment took over the original schedule, while the alternate timing was renamed the &quot;Mark Twain Zephyr&quot; (despite not operating through Hannibal).

Unlike previous &quot;Zephyrs&quot;, the &quot;General Pershing Zephyr&quot; was completely non-articulated; each car was self-contained and joined to the next by couplers, rather than shared trucks. The inflexibility of the articulated layout had been recognised; it was hard to lengthen, shorten, or replace parts of the train. The route did not require a high-capacity train nor a powerful locomotive, so the &quot;General Pershing Zephyr&quot; returned to the pattern of the first &quot;Pioneer Zephyr&quot;, being a power/baggage car and three trailers. Budd also fitted disc brakes, the first such practical installation to railroad passenger cars.

The power car, 9908 &quot;Silver Charger&quot;, was unique. It utilised a single new EMC 567 V-12 engine developing 1,000 hp, rather than the pair used in the contemporary EMC E3. It had one Martin Blomberg-designed E-unit A1A passenger truck at the front, with powered outer axles and a center idler axle, and an unpowered trailing truck, giving it the unusual wheel arrangement of A1A-2. This made it mechanically half of an E3. The back half of the power car was a baggage area. This made it similar to special power-baggage units built by EMD for the Colorado Springs section of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad &quot;Rocky Mountain Rocket&quot;, though the latter had a carbody and E-3/E-6 styling by EMD. The &quot;Silver Charger&quot; was the last power unit built by Budd with the unique &quot;Zephyr&quot;/&quot;Flying Yankee&quot; shovelnose styling.
 It also carried sleeping cars. The train was number 32 when eastbound and number 33 when traveling west.

The train ran its assigned route until the United States entered World War II, during which time the trainset ran on many different routes. As 9908 &quot;Silver Charger&quot; could be detached from its trainset, it continued in service hauling other trains after the rest of the streamlined trainset was withdrawn. In this form it lasted in service until 1966, following which it was donated to the National Museum of Transportation in St Louis.

Traveling between Kansas City and St Louis required the &quot;General Pershing Zephyr&quot; to operate on tracks owned by the Alton Railroad, officially making them an operating partner. To symbolize this joint administration, the &quot;General Pershing Zephyr&quot; often sported an &quot;Alton Burlington&quot; nose herald instead of the standard &quot;Burlington Route&quot; seen on most Burlington locomotives. 
The diner-lounge-observation car &quot;Silver Star&quot; was sold to Amax Iron Ore Corporation in 1974 for use on the Mount Newman railway in Western Australia and renamed &quot;Sundowner&quot;. It was used for many years as passenger accommodation on the fortnightly supply train to the mines. It was also used for VIP and inspection trains. Having last been used in 2003, it was sent to Perth for rebuilding as the nucleus of the Silver Star Cafe in Port Hedland.

<doc id="1322202" wikidata="Q7826066" url="?curid=1322202" title="Torna atrás">
<text>Torna atrás () or tornatrás is a term used in 18th century &quot;Casta&quot; paintings to portray a &quot;mestizo&quot; or mixed-race person who showed phenotypic characteristics of only one of the &quot;original races&quot;, such as European or Amerindian ancestry. The term was also used to describe an individual whose parentage was half white and half &quot;albino&quot;.


==Spanish America==
The term &quot;torna atrás&quot; (in English, similar in meaning to &quot;throwback&quot; or &quot;harken back to&quot;) could also refer to the appearance of racial characteristics not visible in the parents. An example is the child of a white person and a light-skinned person of partial African ancestry (&quot;albino&quot;) born with darker skin than their African-descended parent.

The term &quot;torna atrás&quot; does not appear as a legal category in colonial documentation, but it is often shown in families portrayed in casta paintings in eighteenth-century Mexico.

==Philippines==
The term &quot;tornatrás&quot; was also used in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial era from the 16th to 19th century, to describe persons of mixed Austronesian (referred to in Spanish as &quot;indio&quot;), Chinese (referred to in Spanish as &quot;Sangley&quot;), and Spanish ancestry (referred to in Spanish as &quot;español&quot; (or &quot;kastila&quot; in Filipino/Tagalog), specifically either &quot;filipinos&quot;/&quot;insulares&quot; (Spaniard born/raised in Spanish Philippines) or &quot;americanos&quot; (Criollo born/raised in Spanish America) or &quot;peninsulares&quot; (Spaniard born/raised in Iberia) ), or just mixed Chinese and Spanish ancestry.

Although tornatrás was originally used to describe a descendant of mestizos, albinos and Europeans, in the Philippines they were commonly known as those born from a Spanish father and a &quot;mestiza de Sangley&quot; (mixed native and Sangley Chinese) mother or a pure-blooded Sangley Chinese mother; they can be born to any mixed native and Spanish parent and any mixed native and Chinese parent. Most tornatrás who were mostly middle-class people in Spanish Philippines used Spanish as their primary language multilingually with Philippine languages and/or Hokkien Chinese, and in many cases converted to the Catholic faith. Examples of famous tornatrás persons in colonial history are José Rizal, Andrés Bonifacio, and Manuel Quezon.

<doc id="1322203" wikidata="Q77782940" url="?curid=1322203" title="Auchinleck House">
<text>Auchinleck House is an 18th-century mansion in Scotland. It is situated near the town of Auchinleck near Cumnock and Ayr in East Ayrshire. The Auchinleck Estate has been inhabited since the 13th century, and the remains of Auchinleck Castle and Auchinleck Old House stand in the estate. The house is protected as a category A listed building, while the two ruined dwellings are scheduled monuments.

==History==

Auchinleck Castle was recorded as being extant in 1241. At that time, the castle was the seat of the Auchinlecks of that Ilk, who had held the barony since at least the 13th century and possibly earlier. The castle, and the barony, remained within the Auchinleck family until 1504 when due to a failing Auchinleck male line, and the marriage of a daughter of Sir John Auchinleck to a Thomas Boswell, the estate and the title were granted to Boswell by King James IV. Boswell assumed the title of laird from that date. It is not known when Auchinleck Castle ceased to be inhabited. The ruins still stand within the grounds of the Auchinleck estate, on the low sandstone cliff which overlooks the confluence of the River Lugar and the Dippol Burn.

===The Boswells===
In 1591 John Boswell was in trouble with the Privy Council for practising witchcraft, sorcery and enchantments, consulting with witches and taking part in other devilish activities. Richie Graham, the most notorious wizard of his day, admitted to having raised the Devil at Auchinleck. Boswell&#x27;s response to these allegations was to flee the country.

Auchinleck Old House was built in 1612, and was the home of the Boswell family prior to the building of the current Auchinleck House. Again, the ruins are still standing within the estate.

The &quot;new&quot; Auchinleck House was built &quot;circa&quot; 1760 by Alexander Boswell, Lord Auchinleck, 8th Laird of Auchinleck. It later passed on to his son, James Boswell, the biographer of Samuel Johnson. Boswell and Johnson visited the house in 1773 on their way back from their journey to the Hebrides. In 1782, James Boswell became the 9th Laird of Auchinleck. His wife Margaret Boswell catalogued the houses&#x27;s valuable library of books in 1783. The design of the house has been attributed to Robert Adam, although it may have been designed by Alexander Boswell himself.

===Auchinleck House in the 20th century===
During the Second World War, the then Laird of Auchinleck gave permission for Officers from the armies of Poland, Canada and France to live in Auchinleck House.

In 1986 the remains of the buildings were turned over to the Scottish Historic Buildings Trust by James Boswell, a descendant of the 18th-century Boswells. The Trust repaired the roof, and thus ensured the survival of the building. In 1999 Auchinleck House was bought by the Landmark Trust, a building preservation charity whose aim it is to &quot;rescue historic and architecturally interesting buildings and their surroundings from neglect and, when restored, to give them new life by letting them for holidays.&quot; Now restored, Auchinleck House is used for holiday lets, and is occasionally open to the public.

<text>A niqāb or niqaab (; ), also known as a ruband (), is a long garment worn by some Muslim women in order to cover their entire body and face, excluding their eyes. It is an interpretation in Islam of the concept of &quot;hijab&quot;, and is worn in public and in all other places where a woman may encounter non-&quot;mahram&quot; men. Most prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula, the niqab is a controversial clothing item in many parts of the world, including in some Muslim-majority countries.

Historically, the niqab was largely exclusive to Muslim women in Najd, a region in present-day Saudi Arabia, and in some Arab countries of the Persian Gulf. However, since the late 1970s, it has spread throughout the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, particularly among Sunni Muslims. This phenomenon was encouraged by the rise of &quot;Petro-Islam&quot; under the House of Saud; the propagation of hardline Sunni Islamic doctrines from the oil-producing Arab countries, beginning in earnest after the 1973 Arab–Israeli War, would quickly come to mold the Saudis&#x27; ideological response to the religious zeal that the Iranian Revolution had stirred among Shia Muslims. Sponsorship by Saudi Arabia of mosques throughout many Muslim-majority countries led to the increased adoption of Wahhabism and Salafism globally, resulting in the rise of the niqab as one of the more noticeable consequences of the Saudi strain of Islamic revivalism, which flourished greatly throughout the late 20th century. It also consolidated the newfound religious and cultural dominance of Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia over the Arab countries as a whole, effectively serving as a social countermeasure to the religious and cultural influence of Shia-majority Iran.

Since the 2000s, and particularly after the September 11 attacks in the United States, the niqab has increasingly become the subject of negative attention in the Western world, as it is commonly perceived by detractors as a visible sign of growing Islamic extremism and a rejection of Western values. For instance, in Algeria, where the presence of the niqab increased considerably in the 1990s, the Algerian public consciousness began associating the garment with the Islamists who were fighting in the Algerian Civil War; it was also protested by some Algerians as a byproduct of Saudi-backed Islamic fundamentalism—one that lacked authenticity in Algerian culture.

To varying degrees, wearing the niqab or the burqa has been banned by legislation in several countries, including a number of Muslim-majority countries. A significant amount of Muslim scholars consider the niqab as not compulsory for practicing Muslim women. Though similar, the niqab is distinct from the burqa by way of the eyes: a niqab does not cover the eyes, varies in the thickness of the material used, and has visible sleeves; but a burqa is elaborately designed with thicker material that covers the woman&#x27;s entire body figure and face, lacking sleeves (i.e., keeping the entire body under the uniform cloth) and having a mesh screen to obfuscate the eyes. While the niqab is more widespread, the burqa is largely limited to Central Asia and South Asia, and is most prominent in Afghanistan.
==Use of the term in Arabic==
Women who wear the niqab are often called &#x27;; this word is used both as a noun and as an adjective. However, the more correct form grammatically is &#x27; (plural &#x27;) but &#x27; is used in an affectionate manner (much as with &#x27; versus &#x27;). Women in niqab are also called &#x27;, with the plural &#x27;.

==Religious doctrine==
=== In pre-Islamic Arabia ===

In pre-Islamic Arabia, face veiling was common among women of various religious backgrounds. The Roman author Tertullian, who was a Christian, described in &quot;The Veiling of Virgins&quot; the contemporary societal tendency among pagan Arabian women to cover their entire faces.

=== Women&#x27;s veiling in Islam ===
Al-Ghazali states in The Revival of the Religious Sciences that &quot;men have always uncovered their faces throughout time, and women have always gone out in niqab.&quot; Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari: “It has always been the custom of women, both in the past and in the present, to cover their faces from strangers.”

Since the Maliki madhhab does not require niqab, by extension it is argued that niqab is not an overall mandatory requirement. Therefore, Islamic scholars and contemporary Islamic jurists have agreed that women are not required to cover their face. There exist a number of reasons why women may cover their face in public, and this practice must be understood within a particular social context as well as their madhhab.

==== Styles ====

There are many styles of &quot;niqab&quot; and other facial veils worn by Muslim women around the world. The two most common forms are the &quot;half niqab&quot; and the &quot;gulf-style&quot; or &quot;full niqab&quot;.

The &quot;half niqab&quot; is a simple length of fabric with elastic or ties and is worn around the face. This garment typically leaves the eyes and part of the forehead visible.

The &quot;gulf-style&quot; or &quot;full niqab&quot; completely covers the face. It consists of an upper band that is tied around the forehead, together with a long wide piece of fabric which covers the face, leaving an opening for the eyes. Many full niqab have two or more sheer layers attached to the upper band, which can be worn flipped down to cover the eyes or left over the top of the head. While a person looking at a woman wearing a niqab with an eyeveil would not be able to see her eyes, the woman wearing the niqab would be able to see out through the thin fabric.

Other less common and more cultural or national forms of niqab include the Afghan style burqa, a long pleated gown that extends from the head to the feet with a small crocheted grille over the face. The Pak chador is a relatively new style from Pakistan, which consists of a large triangular scarf with two additional pieces. A thin band on one edge is tied behind the head so as to keep the chador on, and then another larger rectangular piece is attached to one end of the triangle and is worn over the face, and the simple &quot;hijāb&quot; wrapped, pinned or tied in a certain way so as to cover the wearer&#x27;s face.

Other common styles of clothing popularly worn with a &quot;niqab&quot; in Western countries include the khimar, a semi-circular flare of fabric with an opening for the face and a small triangular underscarf. A khimar is usually bust-level or longer, and can also be worn without the &quot;niqab&quot;. It is considered a fairly easy form of headscarf to wear, as there are no pins or fasteners; it is simply pulled over the head. Gloves are also sometimes worn with the niqab, because many &quot;munaqqabāt&quot; believe no part of the skin should be visible other than the area immediately around the eyes or because they do not want to be put in a position where they would touch the hand of an unrelated man (for instance, when accepting change from a cashier). Most &quot;munaqqabāt&quot; also wear an overgarment (jilbab, abaya etc.) over their clothing, though some munaqabat in Western countries wear a long, loose tunic and skirt instead of a one-piece overgarment.

==Rules and regulations==
===Enforcement of the niqab/burqa===
Covering the face was enforced by the Taliban regime with the traditional Afghan face veil called the burka.

===Criminalization of the niqab/burqa===

There are currently 18 states that have banned the niqab and burqa, both Muslim-majority countries and non-Muslim countries, including:

* Africa: Cameroon, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Tunisia
* Asia: China, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan
* Europe: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland

The niqab is controversial in the Western world. In France specifically, although the niqab is not individually targeted, it falls within the scope of legislation which bans the wearing of any religious items (Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, or Buddhist) in state schools (universities are not affected), and another ban on face coverings (which also includes carnival masks and motorbike helmets when not on a motorbike).

In 2004, the French Parliament passed a law to regulate &quot;the wearing of symbols indicating religious affiliation in public educational establishments&quot;. This law forbids all emblems that outwardly express a specific religious belief to be worn in French public schools. This law was proposed because the Stasi Commission, a committee that is supposed to enforce secularity in French society, was forced to deal with frequent disputes about headscarves in French public schools, as outsiders of the practice did not understand the scarves&#x27; purpose and therefore felt uncomfortable.

Although the French law addresses other religious symbols – not just Islamic headscarves and face coverings – the international debate has been centered around the impact it has on Muslims because of the growing population in Europe, especially in France, and the increase in Islamophobia.

In July 2010, the National Assembly in France passed &quot;Loi Interdisant La Dissimulation Du Visage Dans L&#x27;espace Public&quot;, (Act Prohibiting Concealment of the Face in Public Space). This act outlawed the wearing of clothing that covers one&#x27;s face in any public space. Violators of the ban on veils and coverings are liable to fines of up to 150 euros and mandatory classes on French citizenship. Anyone found to have forced a woman to wear a religious covering faces up to two years in prison as well as a €60,000 fine.

In October 2018, the United Nations Human Rights Committee declared that France&#x27;s ban disproportionately harmed the right of women to manifest their religious beliefs, and could have the effects of &quot;confining them to their homes, impeding their access to public services and marginalizing them.&quot;

====Discrimination against niqabis====

The niqab is outlawed in Azerbaijan, where the overwhelming majority of the population is Muslim. Niqabi women, just like women wearing hijab, cannot work as public servants, neither can they continue studies at schools, including the private schools. Although there is no single law banning niqab at private companies, it would be nearly impossible for a niqabi woman to find work.

In February 2010, an Arab country&#x27;s unnamed ambassador to Dubai had his marriage annulled after discovering that his bride was cross-eyed and had facial hair. The woman had worn a niqab on the occasions that the couple had met prior to the wedding. The ambassador informed the Sharia court that he had been deliberately deceived by the bride&#x27;s mother, who had shown him photographs of the bride&#x27;s sister. He only discovered this when he lifted the niqab to kiss his bride. The court annulled the marriage, but refused a claim for compensation.

Sultaana Freeman gained national attention in 2003 when she sued the US state of Florida for the right to wear a niqab for her driver&#x27;s license photo. However, a Florida circuit court ruled there was no violation in the state requiring her to show her face to a camera in a private room with only a female employee to take the picture, in exchange for the privilege of driving. The ruling was affirmed by the appellate court.

One female non-Muslim student at Eastern Michigan University spent a semester in 2005 wearing a niqab for a class project (she referred to the face veil as a &quot;burqa&quot;). Her stated experiences, such as her own feeling as if no one wanted to be near her, led her to assert that conservative Muslim dress is disapproved of in the United States.

Some Muslim Palestinian women, particularly students, have worn white niqabs during Arab protest activities relating to the Arab–Israeli conflict.

In 2006, female candidates from the Hamas party campaigned during the Palestinian Authority parliamentary elections, wearing niqabs.

==Prevalence and legislation by country==
=== Africa ===
==== Algeria ====
In October 2018, Algeria banned the wearing of full-face veils, including the niqab, for female public servants while at work.

==== Cameroon ====
In July 2015, Cameroon banned the face veil including the burqa after two women dressed in the religious garments completed a suicide attack killing 13. This was also done in order to counter extremism in public and places of work.

==== Chad ====
In June 2015, the full face veil was banned in Chad after veiled Boko Haram bombers disguised as women carried out multiple suicide attacks.

==== Republic of the Congo ====
In May 2015, the Republic of the Congo banned the face veil in order to counter extremism. The decision was announced by El Hadji Djibril Bopaka, the president of the country&#x27;s Islamic High Council.

==== Egypt ====
The niqab in Egypt has a complex and long history. On 8 October 2009, Egypt&#x27;s top Islamic school and the world&#x27;s leading school of Sunni Islam, Al-Azhar, banned the wearing of the niqab in classrooms and dormitories of all its affiliate schools and educational institutes.

==== Morocco ====
The Moroccan government distributed letters to businesses on 9 January 2017 declaring a ban on the burka. The letters indicated the &quot;sale, production and import&quot; or the garment were prohibited and businesses were expected to clear their stock within 48 hours.

==== Tunisia ====
In July 2019, wearing the niqab was banned in government buildings. The ban came after the capital Tunis was attacked by three suicide bombings in seven days.

=== Asia ===
==== China ====
In February 2015, the city of Ürümqi banned face veils in order to counter extremism. The Chinese government later expanded the ban to all of Xinjiang in March 2017.

==== Iran ====
The niqab was traditionally worn in Southern Iran from the arrival of Islam until the end of the Qajar era. There were many regional variations of niqab, which were also called ruband or pushiye.

The 20th century ruler, Reza Shah, banned all variations of face veil and veils in 1936 known as Kashf-e hijab, as incompatible with his ambitions to westernize the citizens of Iran and their traditional historical culture. Reza Shah ordered the police to arrest women who wore the niqab and hijab and to remove their face veils by force. This policy outraged the clerics who believed it was obligatory for women to cover their faces. Many women gathered at the Goharshad Mosque in Mashhad with their faces covered to show their objection to the niqab ban.

Between 1941 and 1979 wearing the niqab and hijab was no longer against the law, but it was considered by the government to be a &quot;badge of backwardness.&quot; During these years, wearing the niqab and chador became much less common and instead most religious women wore headscarves only. Fashionable hotels and restaurants refused to admit women wearing niqabs. High schools and universities actively discouraged or even banned the niqab, though the headscarf was tolerated.

After the new government of &#x27;Islamic Republic&#x27; was established, the niqab ban was not enforced by officials.

In modern Iran, the wearing of niqab is not common and is only worn by certain ethnic minorities and a minority of Arab Muslims in the southern Iranian coastal cities, such as Bandar Abbas, Minab and Bushehr. Some women in the Arab-populated province of Khuzestan still wear the niqab.

==== Kyrgyzstan ====
In Kyrgyzstan, the ban on the Islamic niqab took effect on February 1, 2025, with women facing a fine of 20,000 som ($230) if they wear it in public places.

==== Pakistan ====
In 2015, the constitutional Council of Islamic Ideology issued the fatwa that women are not required to wear niqab or cover their hands or feet under Shariah.

==== Saudi Arabia ====
The niqab is an important part of Saudi culture and in most Saudi cities (including Riyadh, Mecca, Medina, Jeddah, etc.) the vast majority of women cover their faces.
The Saudi niqab usually leaves a long open slot for the eyes; the slot is held together by a string or narrow strip of cloth. In 2008, the Mohammad Habadan, a religious authority in Mecca, reportedly called on women to wear veils that reveal only one eye, so that women would not be encouraged to use eye make-up.

==== Sri Lanka ====
Face veils were banned in the aftermath of the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings.

==== Syria ====
1,200 niqab-wearing teachers were transferred to administrative duties in the summer of 2010 in Syria because the face veil was undermining the secular policies followed by the state as far as education is concerned. In the summer of 2010, students wearing the niqab were prohibited from registering for university classes. The ban was associated with a move by the Syrian government to re-affirm Syria&#x27;s traditional secular atmosphere.

On 6 April 2011 it was reported that teachers would be allowed to once again wear the niqab.

==== Tajikistan ====
In 2017 the government of Tajikistan passed a law requiring people to &quot;stick to traditional national clothes and culture&quot;, which has been widely seen as an attempt to prevent women from wearing traditional Islamic clothing, in particular the style of headscarf wrapped under the chin, in contrast to the traditional Tajik headscarf tied behind the head.

==== Yemen ====
Since antiquity, the Arab tradition of wearing the niqab has been practiced by women living in Yemen. Traditionally, girls begin wearing veils in their teenage years.

Acceptance of the niqab is not universal in Yemen. A senior member of the Al-Islah political party, Tawakkol Karman, removed her niqab at a human rights conference in 2004 and since then has called for &quot;other women and female activists to take theirs off&quot;.

=== Europe ===

==== Austria ====
In 2017, a legal ban on face-covering Islamic clothing was adopted by the Austrian parliament.

==== Belgium ====
On 29 April 2010, the Belgian Chamber of Representatives adopted a law prohibiting people to wear &quot;attire and clothing masking the face in such a way that it impairs recognizability&quot;. The penalty for violating this directive can run from up to 14 days imprisonment and a 250 euro fine.

On 11 July 2017 the ban in Belgium was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) after having been challenged by two Muslim women who claimed their rights had been infringed.

==== Bulgaria ====
In 2016, a legal ban on face-covering Islamic clothing was adopted by the Bulgarian parliament.

==== Denmark ====
In autumn 2017, the Danish parliament (Danish: Folketinget) agreed to adopt a law prohibiting people to wear &quot;attire and clothing masking the face in such a way that it impairs recognizability&quot;. A full ban on both niqabs and burqas was announced on 31 May 2018. The ban came into force on 1 August 2018 and carries a fine of 1000 DKK, about 134 euro, by repeat offending the fine may reach 10 000 DKK. Then targets all garments that covers the face, such as fake beards or balaclavas. Supporters of the ban claim that the ban facilitates integration of Muslims into Danish society while Amnesty International claimed the ban violated women&#x27;s rights. A protest numbering 300-400 people was held in the Nørrebro district of Copenhagen organised by Socialist Youth Front, &quot;Kvinder i Dialog&quot; and &quot;Party Rebels&quot;.

The first fine was issued in Hørsholm in August 2018 to a woman dressed in a niqab who was in a fistfight with another woman on an escalator in a shopping centre. During the fight, her face-covering veil fell off, but as police approached, she put it on again and police issued the fine. Both women were suspected of public order violations.

==== France ====
On 13 July 2010 France&#x27;s lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved a ban on wearing burqa-style Islamic veils. The legislation forbids face-covering Muslim veils in all public places in France and calls for fines or citizenship classes, or both. The bill also is aimed at husbands and fathers – anyone convicted of forcing someone else to wear the garb risks a year of prison and a fine, with both penalties, doubled if the victim is a minor.

==== Germany ====
In 2017, a legal ban on face-covering clothing for soldiers and state workers during work was approved by German parliament. Also in 2017, a legal ban on face-covering clothing for car and truck drivers was approved by German Ministry of Traffic.

In July 2017, German state Bavaria approved a legal ban on face-covering clothing for teachers, state workers and students at university and schools.

In August 2017, the state of Lower Saxony (German: &quot;Niedersachsen&quot;) banned the burqa along with the niqab in public schools. This change in the law was prompted by a Muslim pupil in Osnabrück who wore the garment to school for years and refused to take it off. Since she has completed her schooling, the law was instituted to prevent similar cases in the future.

In July 2020, the state of Baden-Württemberg banned face-covering veils for pupils, which extended the ban which was already in force for school staff.

==== Italy ====
In Italy, a law issued in 1975 strictly forbids wearing any attire in public that could hide the face of a person. Penalties (fines and imprisonment) are provided for such behaviour. The original purpose of the anti-mask law was to prevent crime or terrorism. The law allows for exemptions for a &quot;justified cause&quot;, which has sometimes been interpreted by courts as including religious reasons for wearing a veil, but others – including local governments – disagree and claim religion is not a &quot;justified cause&quot; in this context.

==== Latvia ====
In 2016, a legal ban on face-covering Islamic clothing was proposed for adoption by the Latvian parliament.

==== Netherlands ====
In 2007, the government of the Netherlands planned a legal ban on face-covering Islamic clothing, popularly described as the &#x27;burqa ban&#x27;, which included the niqab. In 2015, a partial ban of the niqab and burqa were approved by the Dutch government. The parliament still had to approve the measure. In November 2016, the legal ban on face-covering was approved by parliament. On 26 June 2018, a partial ban on face covering (including niqabs) on public transport and in buildings and associated yards of educational institutions, governmental institutions and healthcare institutions was enacted, with a number of exceptions.

==== Norway ====
In 2012 in Norway, a professor at the University of Tromsø denied a student&#x27;s use of niqab in the classroom. The professor claimed Norway&#x27;s parliament granted each teacher the right to deny the use of niqab in his/her classroom. Clothing that covers the face, such as a niqab, is prohibited in some schools and municipalities.

The Prime Minister of Norway Erna Solberg stated in an interview that in Norwegian work environments it is essential to see each other&#x27;s faces and therefore anyone who insists on wearing a niqab is in practice unemployable. Solberg also views the wearing of the niqab as a challenge to social boundaries in the Norwegian society, a challenge that would be countered by Norway setting boundaries of its own. Solberg also stated that anyone may wear what they wish in their spare time and that her comments applied to professional life but that any immigrant has the obligation to adapt to Norwegian work life and culture.

In June 2018, the parliament of Norway passed a bill banning clothing covering the face at educational institutions as well as daycare centres, which included face-covering Islamic veils. The prohibition applies to pupils and staff alike.

==== Sweden ====
In 2012, a poll by Uppsala University found that Swedes believed that face-covering Islamic veils are either completely unacceptable or fairly unacceptable, 85% for the burqa and 81% for the niqāb. The researchers noted these figures represented a compact resistance to the face-covering veil by the population of Sweden.

In December 2019, the municipality of Skurup banned Islamic veils in educational institutions. Earlier, the municipality of Staffanstorp approved a similar ban.

==== Switzerland ====
In July 2016, the Canton of Ticino banned face-covering veils.

In September 2018, a ban on face-covering veils was approved with a 67% vote in favour in the canton of St Gallen. The largest Islamic community organisation in Switzerland, the Islamic Central Council, recommended that Muslim women continue to cover their faces.

In March 2021, a nationwide referendum was held on whether full-face coverings should be banned in public, which includes niqabs and burqas. Voters narrowly voted to ban niqabs and burqas by a 51.2% to 48.8% margin.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, comments by Jack Straw, MP, started a national debate over the wearing of the &quot;veil&quot; (niqab), in October 2006. Around that time there was media coverage of the case of Aishah Azmi, a teaching assistant in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, who lost her appeal against suspension from her job for wearing the niqab while teaching English to young children. It was decided that being unable to see her face prevented the children from learning effectively. Azmi, who had been interviewed and hired for the position without the niqab, allegedly on her husband&#x27;s advice, argued it was helping the children understand different people&#x27;s beliefs. In 2010, a man committed a bank robbery wearing a niqab as a disguise.

=== North America ===
==== Canada ====
The niqab is banned in the Canadian province of Quebec in all publicly funded services. Persons cannot receive public service or provide public service with their faces covered. This includes public transportation, hospitals, and courts amongst others. On 18 October 2017, Bill 62 passed into law after a 66–51 vote in the Quebec National Assembly. The new law is entitled &quot;An Act to foster adherence to State religious neutrality and, in particular, to provide a framework for requests for accommodation on religious grounds in certain bodies&quot;. However, regulations regarding the ban&#x27;s implementation, and religious accommodations, are not expected until July 2018.

On 16 November 2015 the first act of Canada&#x27;s newly appointed Minister of Justice and Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould was to assure women who chose to wear the niqāb during the Oath of Allegiance of their right to do so. In December 2011 then-Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney announced a policy directive from the Federal Government under then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper that Muslim women must remove niqābs throughout the citizenship ceremony where they declare their Oath of Allegiance. Zunera Ishaq, a Sunni Muslim woman living in Mississauga, Ontario, challenged and won the niqāb ban in the case of &quot;Canada v Ishaq&quot; on 5 October 2015. The Federal Court of Appeal decision in her favour was seen by some as &quot;an opportunity to revisit the rules governing the somewhat difficult relationship between law and policy.&quot; In October 2015 Harper had appealed the Supreme Court of Canada to take up the case. With the election of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on 19 October 2015, the niqāb debate was settled as the Liberal government chose to not &quot;politicize the issue any further.&quot; Minister Wilson-Raybould, who is the first Indigenous person to be named as Justice Minister, explained as she withdrew Harper&#x27;s appeal to the Supreme Court, &quot;In all of our policy as a government we will ensure that we respect the values that make us Canadians, those of diversity, inclusion and respect for those fundamental values.&quot; The Justice Minister spoke with Zunera by telephone to tell her the news prior to making her official announcement.

Elections Canada, the agency responsible for elections and referendums, stated that Muslim women can cover their faces while voting. The decision was criticized by the Conservative Party of Canada, Bloc Québécois, and Liberal Party of Canada. The New Democrats were not opposed to the decision. The Conservative federal Cabinet had introduced legislation to parliament that would bar citizens from voting if they arrived at polling stations with a veiled face.

The niqāb became an issue in the 2007 election in Quebec after it became public knowledge that women wearing the niqāb were allowed to vote under the same rules as electors who did not present photo identification (ID); namely, by sworn oath in the presence of a third party who could vouch for their identity. The chief electoral officer received complaints that this policy was too accommodating of cultural minorities (a major theme in the election) and thereafter required accompaniment by bodyguards due to threatening telephone calls. All three major Quebec political parties were against the policy, with the Parti Québécois and Action démocratique du Québec vying for position as most opposed. The policy was soon changed to require all voters to show their face, even if they did not carry photo ID. However, Quebec residents who wear the niqāb stated they were not opposed to showing their faces for official purposes, such as voting. Salam Elmenyawi of the Muslim Council of Montreal estimated that only 10 to 15 Muslim voters in the province wear the niqāb and, since their veils have become controversial, most would probably not vote.

In October 2009, the Muslim Canadian Congress called for a ban on burqa and niqāb, saying that they have &quot;no basis in Islam&quot;. Spokesperson Farzana Hassan cited public safety issues, such as identity concealment, as well as gender equality, stating that wearing the burqa and niqāb is &quot;a practice that marginalizes women.&quot;

In December 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Muslim women who wear the niqāb must remove it in some cases when testifying in court.

==== United States ====
In 2002, Sultaana Freeman (formerly Sandra Keller, who converted to Islam in 1997 when marrying a Muslim man), sued the U.S. state of Florida for the right to wear a niqab for her driver&#x27;s license photo. However, a Florida appellate court ruled that there was no violation in the state requiring her to show her face to a camera in a private room with only a female employee to take the picture, in exchange for the privilege of driving. The prevailing view in Florida is currently that hiding one&#x27;s face on a form of photo identification defeats the purpose of having the picture taken, although 15 other states (including Arkansas, California, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, and Louisiana) have provisions that allow for driver&#x27;s licenses absent of an identifying photograph in order to accommodate individuals who may have a religious reason to not have a photograph taken. In 2012, a string of armed robberies in Philadelphia were committed by people disguised in traditional Islamic woman&#x27;s garb; Muslim leaders were concerned that the use of the disguises could put Muslim women in danger of hate crimes and inflame ethnic tensions.

==== Australia ====
In May 2010, an armed robbery committed by a man wearing a face veil and sunglasses raised calls to ban the Islamic veil; a request for new legislation was dismissed by both Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Liberal leader Tony Abbott.

<text>Sir Charles Barnard Groves CBE (10 March 191520 June 1992) was an English conductor. He was known for the breadth of his repertoire and for encouraging contemporary composers and young conductors.

After accompanying positions and conducting various orchestras and studio work for the BBC, Groves spent a decade as conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. His best-known musical directorship was of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, beginning in 1963, with which he made most of his recordings. From 1967 until his death, Groves was associate conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and in the 1970s he was one of the regular conductors of the Last Night of the Proms. He also served as president of the National Youth Orchestra from 1977, and, during the last decade of his life, as guest conductor for orchestras around the world.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Groves was born in London, the only child of Frederick Groves and Annie (née Whitehead). He was a pupil at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral School (where a house is now named after him), singing in the Cathedral choir and, from the age of 13, studying the piano and organ. 
Music was already important to him as a solace, as he was orphaned at the age of ten – his father having died in 1921 from injuries received in World War I and his mother having died four years later.
From 1930 until 1932 he was a pupil at Sutton Valence School, in Kent, where Groves Hall is named in honour of him.
After leaving Sutton Valence School he attended the Royal College of Music.
There, his main studies were in lieder and accompanying, but he became involved in student opera productions as a répétiteur. He was naturally gifted with great fluency and the ability to sight read almost any music, but confessed, years later, to having been lazy about his piano studies, and he abandoned his ambitions to become a concert pianist. He played in the percussion section for Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Hugh the Drover&quot; and Delius&#x27;s &quot;A Village Romeo and Juliet&quot; when Sir Thomas Beecham performed as guest conductor at the College. Groves also went into the conducting class, but did not progress beyond the third orchestra. In 1937, while still a student, he accompanied choral rehearsals of Brahms&#x27;s &quot;German Requiem&quot;, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; and Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot; under Arturo Toscanini.

Groves began his professional career as a freelance accompanist, including work for the BBC. In 1938, he was appointed chorus master of the BBC Music Productions Unit under the direction of Stanford Robinson, where he worked on broadcast opera productions. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Groves was sent to Evesham, and later Bedford, England, to be resident chorus master for the BBC while it was evacuated from London. In 1943, he was invited to take charge of the BBC Revue Orchestra, playing mostly light music. During this time Groves conducted Weill&#x27;s &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; with Gertrude Lawrence in the lead role.

===Conducting posts===
Groves was conductor for the BBC Northern Orchestra in Manchester from 1944 to 1951, conducting several studio concerts every week, and thereby acquiring an exceptionally large repertoire. While in Manchester he met a BBC colleague, Hilary Barchard, whom he married in 1948. Feeling the need to move from studio-based work, Groves accepted the conductorship of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra from 1951 to 1961, which he conducted about 150 times each year. When financial difficulties led to a proposal to merge the Bournemouth and Birmingham orchestras, Groves supported the alternative proposition by which the Bournemouth orchestra took on the additional role of resident orchestra for the new Welsh National Opera, of which he became musical director from 1961 to 1963. Groves did much to establish that company&#x27;s choral and orchestral traditions and conducted many performances of works then seldom staged, such as Verdi&#x27;s &quot;I Lombardi&quot; and &quot;The Sicilian Vespers&quot;, which won critical acclaim and were brought to London.

Groves is probably best known for his long tenure from 1963 to 1977 as Music Director and Principal Conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, conducting, as he said, &quot;everything from the St John Passion to Messiaen and Stockhausen&quot;. He spent nine months of every year with the RLPO, where he greatly improved standards of playing. In the other three months he guest conducted concerts and operas in London and overseas. He took the RLPO on highly acclaimed tours of Germany and Switzerland in 1966 and 1968, and Poland in 1970. During his time in Liverpool, Groves instituted a series of seminars for young conductors, and those who made early appearances there included Andrew Davis, Mark Elder, John Eliot Gardiner, James Judd and Barry Wordsworth. At one seminar Groves noted the presence in the orchestra, as an extra percussion player, of a teenager named Simon Rattle.

From 1967 until his death, Groves was associate conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which he led on a tour of the US In the 1970s he was one of the regular conductors of the Last Night of the Proms (others being Norman Del Mar and James Loughran).

Groves was Music Director of the English National Opera in 1978–1979, but in spite of a well-received and rare revival of Weber&#x27;s &quot;Euryanthe&quot; the appointment did not prove a success, and he relinquished the post the following year. He found combining administration with conducting too stressful for him. Groves also served as president of the National Youth Orchestra (1977–1992) and, especially during the last decade of his career, as guest conductor for numerous orchestras around the world. In 1984, he joined the English Sinfonia as president and artistic adviser, later also becoming principal conductor of the Guildford Philharmonic (1987) and music director of the Leeds Philharmonic Society (1988).

===Repertoire===
Groves was particularly noted for his assured conducting of large-scale works and was the first conductor to direct a complete cycle of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s symphonies in Britain. He was also famous for encouraging modern composers, and he frequently included their works in his programmes. Groves conducted a wide repertory, refusing to concentrate on any particular subgenre. He remarked, &quot;I feel myself a GP [general practitioner] rather than a consultant.&quot; Nevertheless, he became particularly known as a champion of British composers and invariably offered British works in his programmes when touring abroad. His large British repertoire included the works of Malcolm Arnold, Arthur Bliss, Havergal Brian, Frank Bridge, Benjamin Britten, George Butterworth, Eric Coates, Frederick Delius, Edward Elgar, Alexander Goehr, Alun Hoddinott, Gustav Holst, George Lloyd, William Mathias, Michael Tippett, Thea Musgrave, Peter Maxwell Davies, Arthur Sullivan, Ralph Vaughan Williams and William Walton.

Groves was noted for adding adventurous new works to the repertory of his orchestras. The composer Oliver Knussen said, &quot;He managed to get the respect of the players and the affection of performers. He had an exemplary attitude and track record with regard to contemporary music. His policy of presenting second performances as well as first was selfless and idealistic.&quot; Groves&#x27;s premières included works by Lennox Berkeley, David Blake, Justin Connolly. Arnold Cooke, Gordon Crosse, Jonathan Harvey, Robin Holloway, Daniel Jones, John McCabe, Priaulx Rainier, Edwin Roxburgh, Edmund Rubbra, Giles Swayne and Hugh Wood. 

===Honours and personal life===
Groves received many honours for his musical work, including being appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1958, a Commander of the Order (CBE) in 1968, and receiving a knighthood in 1973. He received doctorates from four universities, was made a freeman of the City of London in 1976 and elected an honorary member of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1990. He was appointed Companion of the Royal Northern College of Music (whose council he chaired from 1973 to 1990, and where a building is named in his honour) and a Fellow of the Royal College of Music, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, Trinity College of Music, and the London College of Music, and was an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music. The &quot;Making Music Sir Charles Groves Prize&quot; is a national award, named in his honour, given to an individual or organisation making an outstanding contribution to British music. Peter Maxwell Davies wrote &quot;Sir Charles: his Pavane&quot; as a tribute to Groves&#x27;s memory.

Away from the concert hall, Groves was a connoisseur of English literature and also a keen sports fan. When young he played rugby &quot;in the Wasps F team&quot;, as he self-deprecatingly put it, and as a cricketer was &quot;a wily slow bowler&quot;. Charles and Hilary Groves had three children, Sally, Mary and Jonathan, the first and last of whom entered the musical profession. Charles Groves suffered a heart attack early in 1992 and died in London, four months later, at the age of 77. A memorial stone to his memory was placed in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Recordings==
Although the record companies tended to regard Groves as a specialist in British music, he made recordings of German, French and Russian music including Beethoven (Symphony No 4 and Symphony No 6); Fauré (&quot;Masques et bergamasques&quot; and &quot;Pavane&quot;); Haydn (Symphony No 92, &quot;Oxford&quot;, Symphony No 104, &quot;London&quot;); Ravel (&quot;Pavane pour une infante défunte&quot;); Satie (&quot;Gymnopédies&quot;) and Tchaikovsky (&quot;Variations on a Rococo Theme&quot; (with Paul Tortelier, cello)). He also recorded Dvorak&#x27;s Sixth Symphony and Sibelius&#x27;s incidental music to &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

British music recorded by Groves includes Arnold (Symphony No 2); Bliss (&quot;A Colour Symphony&quot;, &quot;Morning Heroes&quot;); Brian (Symphonies 8 &amp; 9); Bridge (&quot;Enter Spring&quot;, &quot;The Sea&quot;, &quot;Summer&quot;); Britten (&quot;Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge&quot;); Butterworth (&quot;The Banks of Green Willow&quot; ); Delius (&quot;Koanga&quot;, &quot;A Mass of Life&quot;, &quot;On hearing the first cuckoo in Spring&quot;); Elgar (&quot;Caractacus&quot;, Cello Concerto (Paul Tortelier, cello), &quot;Chanson de matin&quot;, &quot;Chanson de nuit&quot;, &quot;Crown of India&quot; Suite, &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;, &quot;The Light of Life&quot;, &quot;Nursery Suite&quot;, Serenade for Strings, &quot;Severn Suite&quot;, Violin Concerto (Hugh Bean, violin)); Holst (&quot;Choral Symphony&quot;, &quot;The Planets&quot;, &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s Suite&quot;); Sullivan (Overture &quot;Di Ballo&quot;, Overtures to Savoy Operas, Symphony in E (&quot;Irish&quot;)); Tippett (&quot;Fantasia concertante on a Theme of Corelli&quot;); Vaughan Williams (&quot;Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis&quot;, &quot;Hugh the Drover&quot;); Walton (&quot;Capriccio burlesco&quot;, &quot;Crown Imperial&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot; Funeral March, &quot;Johannesburg Festival Overture&quot;, &quot;Orb and Sceptre&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot; Prelude and Suite, &quot;Scapino&quot;, &quot;Spitfire Prelude &amp; Fugue&quot;); and Warlock (&quot;Capriol Suite&quot;).

<text>The North American river otter (Lontra canadensis), also known as the northern river otter and river otter, is a semiaquatic mammal that lives only on the North American continent throughout most of Canada, along the coasts of the United States and its inland waterways. An adult North American river otter can weigh between . The river otter is protected and insulated by a thick, water-repellent coat of fur.

The North American river otter, a member of the subfamily Lutrinae in the weasel family (Mustelidae), is equally versatile in the water and on land. It establishes a burrow close to the water&#x27;s edge in river, lake, swamp, coastal shoreline, tidal flat, or estuary ecosystems. The den typically has many tunnel openings, one of which generally allows the otter to enter and exit the body of water. Female North American river otters give birth in these burrows, producing litters of one to six young.

North American river otters, like most predators, prey upon the most readily accessible species. Fish is a favored food among the otters, but they also consume various amphibians (such as salamanders and frogs), freshwater clams, mussels, snails, small turtles and crayfish. The most common fish consumed are perch, suckers, and catfish. Occasional reports also show the river otter eating other small animals, such as mice, squirrels, birds, and even dogs that they&#x27;ve attacked and drowned.

The range of the North American river otter has been significantly reduced by habitat loss, beginning with the European colonization of the Americas. In some regions, though, their population is controlled to allow the trapping and harvesting of otters for their fur. North American river otters are very susceptible to the effects of environmental pollution, which is a likely factor in the continued decline of their numbers. A number of reintroduction projects have been initiated to help halt the reduction in the overall population.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The North American river otter was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777. The mammal was identified as a species of otter and has a variety of common names, including North American river otter, northern river otter, common otter and, simply, river otter. Other documented common names are American otter, Canada otter, Canadian otter, fish otter, land otter, nearctic river otter, and Prince of Wales otter. The North American river otter was first classified in the genus &quot;Lutra&quot;. &quot;Lutra&quot; was the early European name (from Latin), and the specific epithet &quot;canadensis&quot; means &quot;of Canada&quot;. 
In a new classification, the species is called &quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;, where the genus &quot;Lontra&quot; includes all the New World river otters.

Molecular biological techniques have been used to determine when the river otter and the giant otter (&quot;Pteronura brasiliensis&quot;) of South America diverged. These analyses suggest they diverged in the Miocene epoch 23.03 to 5.33 million years ago (Mya), which is &quot;much earlier&quot; than indicated in the fossil record. Fossils of a giant otter dating back 3.5 Mya (during the Pliocene) have been found in the US Midwest; however, fossils of the modern river otter did not appear in North America until about 1.9 Mya. The New World river otters originated from the Old World river otters following a migration across the Bering Land Bridge, which existed off and on between 1.8 million and 10,000 years ago. The otters migrated to North America and southwards again across the Panamanian Land Bridge, which formed 3 Mya.

==Description==

The North American river otter has long and thin whiskers that are used to detect prey in dark waters. An average adult male weighs about against the female&#x27;s average of . Its body length ranges from . About one-third of the animal&#x27;s total length consists of a long, tapered tail. Tail lengths range from . Large male North American river otters can exceed a weight of . It differs from the Eurasian otter by its longer neck, narrower visage, the smaller space between the ears and its shorter tail.

Males and female river otters show different non-sexual physical characteristics, with males typically being larger.

North American river otters can live 21–25 years in captivity, or 8–13 years in the wild.

===Form and function===

North American river otters characteristically approach within a few feet of a boat or a person on shore due to their near-sightedness, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. North American river otters have a transparent inner eyelid (called a nictitating membrane) to protect their eyes while swimming.

Most mustelids, including otters, have 36 specialized teeth, including sharp canines and carnassials that inflict lethal bites to prey. Also, North American river otters have large molars used for crushing hard objects, such as the shells of molluscs. Additional premolars may be present. The dental formula is .

==Behavior==
North American river otters only settle in areas that consist of vegetation, rock piles, and sufficient coverage.
===Playing===
North American river otters are renowned for their sense of play. Otter play mostly consists of wrestling with conspecifics. Chasing is also a common game. North American river otters rely upon play to learn survival skills such as fighting and hunting.

===Hunting===
A highly active predator, the North American river otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The vulnerability and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. This availability is influenced by the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.

The diet of the North American river otter can be deduced by analyzing either stool obtained in the field, or gut contents removed from trapped otters. Fish are the primary component of the North American river otter&#x27;s diet throughout the year. Every study done on the food habits of the North American river otter has identified varying fish species as being the primary component of its diet. For instance, an Alberta, Canada study involved the collection and analysis of 1,191 samples of North American river otter scat (feces) collected during each season. Fish remnants were found in 91.9% of the samples. Moreover, a western Oregon study revealed fish remains were present in 80% of the 103 digestive tracts examined. Crustaceans (crayfish), where regionally available, are the second-most important prey for otters. Crustaceans may even be consumed more than fish. For example, a study conducted in a central California marshland indicated crayfish formed nearly 100% of the river otter&#x27;s diet at certain times of the year. However, North American river otters, as foragers, will immediately take advantage of other prey when readily obtainable. Other prey consumed by North American river otters includes fruits, aquatic plants, reptiles, amphibians, birds (most especially moulting ducks which render the birds flightless and thus makes them easier to capture), aquatic insects, small mammals, and mollusks.
North American river otters are not scavengers; they avoid consuming carrion (dead animals). North American river otters do not generally handle prey of a large size relative to themselves but there are occasions where they have been observed ambushing and killing adult common snapping turtles while the large turtles (which are roughly equal in average body weight to a North American river otter) are hibernating. Remains of the much larger North American beaver have been found in North American river otter scat in some regions, although most otter dietary studies in areas where otters and beaver live near each other do not show them to be regular predators of beavers (despite the claims of fur-trappers that otters frequently hunt beavers) and perhaps only young beaver kits may be attacked.

=== Ecological impacts on prey species ===
When left unchecked, though, otters can be significant predators under certain circumstances (e.g. in hatcheries or other fish culture facilities). Likewise, the potential predatory impact of otters may be considerable whenever fish are physically confined (most commonly in smaller ponds offering sparse cover or other escape options). To protect fish in these cases, the otters may need to be removed or relocated. Even in larger bodies of water, river otters may take disproportional advantage of any seasonal concentrations of fish when and where only very limited areas of suitable spawning, low-flow, or over-wintering habitat may exist. Even fast-swimming fish like trout slow down in extremely cold water, leaving them vulnerable. As such, careful consideration of any threatened, endangered, or fish species of special interest is warranted prior to reintroduction of otters to a watershed.

===Social behavior===

A North American river otter can have a territory as large as . However, their usual territory is about . This can change during mating seasons, but that topic is up for debate. 

Although North American river otters are known to be social animals, they can also survive by themselves. Their bodies allow them to avoid predators quite effectively since they can dive, burrow, twist, and turn their bodies for evasive techniques, enabling them to survive independently. North American river otters famously love to play together, which creates strong social bonds, improves hunting skills, and marks territory. North American river otters are not aggressively territorial, but frequently scent-mark certain spots to make their presence known.

===Reproduction and life cycle===
Delayed implantation distinguishes the species from the Eurasian otter, which does not do this.

In early spring, expectant mothers begin to look for a den where they can give birth. The female otters do not dig their own dens; instead, they rely on other animals, such as beavers, to provide suitable environments to raise their offspring. When the mothers have established their domains, they give birth to several kits. Litter size can reach five, but usually ranges from one to three. Each otter pup weighs approximately five ounces.

The mothers raise their young without aid from adult males. When the pups are about two months old and their coats grow in, their mother introduces them to the water. North American river otters are natural swimmers and, with parental supervision, they acquire the skills necessary to swim.
The North American river otters may leave the den by eight weeks and are capable of sustaining themselves upon the arrival of fall, but they usually stay with their families, which sometimes include the father, until the following spring. Prior to the arrival of the next litter, the North American river otter yearlings venture out in search of their own home ranges.

==Geographic range==
The North American river otter is found throughout North America, inhabiting inland waterways and coastal areas in Canada, the Pacific Northwest, the Atlantic states, and the Gulf of Mexico. They also inhabit the forested regions of the Pacific coast in North America. The species is also present throughout Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands, and the north slope of the Brooks Range.

However, urbanization and pollution has resulted in a reduction in the otters&#x27; range in the United States. River otters are now absent or rare in Arizona, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee. Reintroduction projects have expanded their distribution in recent years, in West Virginia, and especially in the Midwestern United States. Since their reintroduction to Kentucky in the early 1990s, the otters have recovered to the point that a trapping season was implemented in 2006, and the species is now found in all of the state&#x27;s major waterways. In 2010, the Colorado Department of Wildlife reported the river otter, reintroduced to the state in the 1980s, was &quot;thriving&quot; and recommended its protection status be reconsidered. In late 2012, a river otter nicknamed Sutro Sam took up residence around the former site of the Sutro Baths in San Francisco, the first river otter sighting in that city since the 1950s. North American river otters occupy all Canadian provinces and territories, except, until recently, Prince Edward Island. Otters have recently began re-establishing themselves on Prince Edward Island.

Historical records indicate North American river otters were once populous throughout most major drainages in the continental United States and Canada prior to European settlement. North America&#x27;s largest North American river otter populations were found in areas with an abundance and diversity of aquatic habitats, such as coastal marshes, the Great Lakes region, and glaciated areas of New England. In addition, riverine habitats in interior regions supported smaller otter populations. The North American river otter existed on all parts of the Pacific Coast, including the seashore and inland streams and lakes. However, river otters were scarce or absent in areas of Southern California such as the chaparral and oak woodlands and Mojave Desert seasonal waterway regions, or in the xeric shrubland regions in New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, and Colorado. In Mexico, North American river otters lived in the Rio Grande and Colorado River Deltas.

==Ecology==

===Habitat===
Although commonly called a &quot;river otter&quot;, the North American river otter is found in a wide variety of aquatic habitats, both freshwater and coastal marine, including lakes, rivers, inland wetlands, coastal shorelines, marshes, and estuaries. It can tolerate a great range of temperature and elevations. Aquatic life ties North American river otters almost exclusively to permanent watersheds. Their main requirements are a steady food supply and easy access to a body of water. However, it is sensitive to pollution, and will disappear from tainted areas.

Like other otters, the North American river otter lives in a holt, or den, constructed in the burrows of other animals, or in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. An entrance, which may be under water or above ground, leads to a nest chamber lined with leaves, grass, moss, bark, and hair.

===Diet===

The diet of the North American River otters is extensive and mostly consists of fish, frogs, crayfish, turtles, insects and some small mammals. They are known to hunt in pairs or alone and can hunt on both land and in the water. “The North American river otter (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;) is a predator adapted to hunting in water, feeding on aquatic and semi-aquatic animals. The vulnerability and seasonal availability of prey animals primarily determines the food habits and prey preference of the river otter.”

====Fish====
North American river otters consume an extensive assortment of fish species ranging in size from that impart sufficient caloric intake for a minute amount of energy expenditure. North American river otters generally feed on prey that is in larger supply and easier to catch. As a result, slow-swimming fish are consumed more often than game fishes when both are equally available. Slow-moving species include suckers (Catostomidae), catfish, sunfish and bass (Centrarchidae), daces, carp, and shiners (Cyprinidae). For instance, Catostomidae are the primary dietary component of North American river otters in Colorado&#x27;s Upper Colorado River Basin. Likewise, the common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;) is a preferred fish species for the North American river otter in other regions of Colorado. Fish species frequently found in the diets of the North American river otters include: Catostomidae, which consists of suckers (&quot;Catostomus&quot; spp.) and redhorses (&quot;Moxostoma&quot; spp.); Cyprinidae, made up of carp (&quot;Cyprinus&quot; spp.), chubs (&quot;Semotilus&quot; spp.), daces (&quot;Rhinichthys&quot; spp.), shiners (&quot;Notropis&quot; and &quot;Richardsonius&quot; spp.), and squawfishes (&quot;Ptychocheilus&quot; spp.); and Ictaluridae, which consists of bullheads and catfish (&quot;Ictalurus&quot; spp.). Other fish an integral part of the North American river otters&#x27; diets are those that are often plentiful and found in large schools: sunfish (&quot;Lepomis&quot; spp.); darters (&quot;Etheostoma&quot; spp.); and perches (&quot;Perca&quot; spp.). Bottom-dwelling species, which have the tendency to remain immobile until a predator is very close, are susceptible to North American river otters. These include Central mudminnows (&quot;Umbra limi&quot;) and sculpins (&quot;Cottus&quot; spp.). Game fish, such as trout (Salmonidae) and pike (Esocidae), are not a significant component of their diets. They are less likely to be prey for the North American river otters since they are fast-swimming and can find good escape cover. However, river otters will prey on trout, pike, walleye (&quot;Sander vitreus vitreus&quot;), salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus&quot; spp.), and other game fish during spawning. Otters have been found to consume invasive Asian carp.

Adult North American river otters are capable of consuming of fish per day. A study conducted on captive otters revealed they preferred larger fish, ranging from , more than smaller fish, ranging from , and they had difficulty catching fish species less than or larger than . Otters are known to take larger fish on land to eat, whereas smaller fish are consumed in the water.

====Crustaceans====
North American river otters may prefer to feed on crustaceans, especially crayfish (&quot;Cambarus&quot;, &quot;Pacifasticus&quot;, and others) and crabs more than fish where they are locally and seasonally plentiful. In Georgia, crayfish accounted for two-thirds of the prey in the summer diet, and their remnants were present in 98% of the summer spraint. In the winter, crayfish made up one-third of the North American river otter&#x27;s diet. A study conducted on North American river otters in a southwestern Arkansas swamp identified a correlation between crayfish consumption, fish consumption, and water levels.

During the winter and spring, when the water levels were higher, North American river otters had a greater tendency to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become more difficult to obtain.

====Reptiles and amphibians====
Amphibians, where regionally accessible, have been found in the North American river otter&#x27;s diet during the spring and summer months, as indicated in many of the food habit studies. The most common amphibians and reptiles recognized were frogs (&quot;Rana&quot; and &quot;Hyla&quot;). Specific species of reptiles and amphibians prey include: boreal chorus frogs (&quot;Pseudacris maculata&quot;); Canadian toads (&quot;Bufo hemiophrys&quot;); wood frogs (&quot;Rana sylvatica&quot;); American bullfrogs (&quot;Rana catesbeiana&quot;); green frogs (&quot;Rana clamitans&quot;); northwestern salamanders (&quot;Ambystoma gracile&quot;); California giant salamander (&quot;Dicamptodon ensatus&quot;); rough-skinned newt (&quot;Taricha granulosa&quot;); and garter snakes (&quot;Thamnophis&quot;).

Amphibians and reptiles are more obtainable by the North American river otter during the spring and summer as a result of breeding activity, appropriate temperatures, and water supply for the prey.

====Birds====

Waterfowl, rails, and some colonial nesting birds are preyed upon by North American river otters in various areas. Susceptibility of these species is greatest during the summer (when waterfowl broods are vulnerable) and autumn. The North American river otters have also been known to catch and consume moulting American wigeon (&quot;Mareca americana&quot;) and green-winged teal (&quot;Anas crecca&quot;). Other species of birds found within their diets include: northern pintail (&quot;Anas carolinensis&quot;); mallard (&quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot;); canvasback (&quot;Aythya valisineria&quot;); ruddy duck (&quot;Oxyura jamaicensis&quot;); and the American coot (&quot;Fulica americana&quot;).

Although they consume birds, North American river otters do not feed on bird eggs.

====Insects====
Aquatic invertebrates have been recognized as an integral part of the North American river otter&#x27;s diet. Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most aquatic invertebrates preyed upon by the otters are from the orders Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the North American river otters.

====Mammals====
Mammals are rarely consumed by North American river otters, and are not a major dietary component. Mammals preyed upon by North American river otters are characteristically small or are a type species found in riparian zones. The few occurrences of mammals found in the North American river otter&#x27;s diet include remains of the muskrat (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;); meadow vole (&quot;Microtus pennsylvanicus&quot;); eastern cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus floridanus&quot;); and snowshoe hare (&quot;Lepus americanus&quot;).

Records of North American otters preying upon North American beavers (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) vary; it has been reported in the southern boreal forest of Manitoba. Trappers in Alberta, Canada commonly assert North American river otters are major predators of North American beavers. A 1994 river otter study reported findings of beaver remains in 27 of 1,191 scats analyzed. However, many other studies did not report any findings of North American beaver remains in the scat sampled.

==Threats==
Cases where otters have been ambushed and consumed by grizzly bears (&quot;Ursus arctos horribilis&quot;) and polar bears (&quot;Ursus maritimus&quot;) have also been reportedly witnessed near the Arctic region.

Threats to North American river otter populations in North America vary regionally. North American river otter inhabitation is affected by type, distribution, and density of aquatic habitats and characteristics of human activities. Preceding the settlement of North America by Europeans, North American river otters were prevalent among aquatic habitats throughout most of the continent. Trapping, loss or degradation of aquatic habitats through filling of wetlands, and development of coal, oil, gas, tanning, timber, and other industries, resulted in local extinctions or population declines in North American river otter populations in many areas. In 1980, an examination conducted on U.S. river otter populations determined they were locally extinct in 11 states, and lost significant population in 9 other states. The most severe population declines occurred in interior regions where fewer aquatic habitats supported fewer otter populations. Although the distribution became reduced in some regions of southern Canada, the only province-wide extinction occurred on Prince Edward Island.

During the 1970s, improvements in natural resource management techniques emerged, along with increased concerns about North American river otter population declines in North America. Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, including the use of reintroduction projects. Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. All Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and 29 U.S. states have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas.

Oil spills present a localized threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other diminution of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution and pose long-term threats if the enforcement of water quality standards is not upheld. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water quality issue in some areas, as it eliminates otter prey. This dilemma prevents, and consequently inhibits, recolonization or growth of North American river otter populations. Recently, long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant North American river otter populations has been discussed. Similarly, many perceived threats to North American river otters, such as pollution and habitat alterations, have not been rigorously evaluated. Little effort has gone into assessing the threat of disease to wild North American river otter populations, so it is poorly understood and documented.

===Conservation status===
&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot; is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). They have been virtually eliminated through many parts of their range, especially around heavily populated areas in the midwestern and eastern United States. Appendix II lists species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction currently, but may become so unless trade is closely controlled.

The North American river otter is considered a species of least concern according to the IUCN Red List, as it is not currently declining at a rate sufficient for a threat category. By the early 1900s, North American river otter populations had declined throughout large portions of their historic range in North America. However, improvements in water quality (through enactment of clean water regulations) and furbearer management techniques have permitted river otters to regain portions of their range in many areas. Reintroduction projects have been particularly valuable in restoring populations in many areas of the United States. However, North American river otters remain rare or absent in the southwestern United States. Water quality and development inhibit recovery of populations in some areas. The species is widely distributed throughout its range. In many places, the populations have re-established themselves because of conservation initiatives. Reintroduction of river otters may present a problem in that it may contaminate the genetic structure of the native population.

<text>The first USS &quot;Warrington&quot; (DD-30) was a modified in the United States Navy during World War I. She was named for Lewis Warrington.

&quot;Warrington&quot; was laid down on 21 June 1909 at Philadelphia by the William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship &amp; Engine Building Company; launched on 18 June 1910; sponsored by Mrs. Richard Hatton; and commissioned on 20 March 1911.

==Pre-World War I==
After fitting out at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, &quot;Warrington&quot; moved on 5 August to the Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island, where she loaded torpedoes in preparation for training with the Atlantic Torpedo Fleet. During most of the fall and early winter, the warship conducted battle drills and practice torpedo firings with the submarines and destroyers of the torpedo fleet. She also joined the cruisers and battleships of the Atlantic Fleet for training in broader combat maneuvers. Those training evolutions took her as far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and as far south as Cuba.

On 27 December 1911, the destroyer departed Charleston, South Carolina, in company with the ships of Destroyer Divisions 8 and 9, bound for Hampton Roads. At about 1240 the following morning, the two divisions of destroyers reached the vicinity of the Virginia capes. Suddenly, an unidentified schooner knifed her way through the darkness and mist, struck &quot;Warrington&quot; aft, and sliced off about of her stern. The collision deprived her of all propulsion and forced her to anchor at sea some off Cape Hatteras. responded to her distress call first; but, soon, and joined the vigil. The three ships struggled through the morning and forenoon watches to pass a towline to their stricken sister, but it was not until the revenue cutter arrived at 1300 that the latter ship succeeded in taking &quot;Warrington&quot; in tow. The revenue cutter towed her into the Norfolk Navy Yard where she was placed in reserve while undergoing repairs which were not completed until 2 December 1912.

Upon her return to active service, &quot;Warrington&quot; resumed operations with the torpedo forces assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, by then designated the Atlantic Torpedo Flotilla. For a little over four years, she plied the eastern coastal waters of the United States, participating in various gunnery drills and torpedo-firing practices with the torpedo flotilla as well as in fleet maneuvers and battle problems with the assembled Atlantic Fleet. During part of that interlude, the destroyer was based at Newport and worked out of Boston, Massachusetts during the remainder.

&quot;Warrington&quot; was ordered to Bar Harbor, Maine and entered the port with USRCS &quot;Androscoggin&quot; to prevent unauthorized departure of foreign vessels but primarily to protect the transfer of gold and silver, as well as all mail and passengers, from to shore to be transported by train to New York. The two ships arrived at Bar Harbor on 6 August 1914 with wild speculation in the press.

&quot;Warrington&quot; ran aground on 20 May 1916 at Rockport, Massachusetts, prompting a board of investigation ordered by the Commander, Destroyer Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet. Her commanding officer Lt. Isaac F. Dortch was subsequently convicted on three charges in a general court martial and penalized twenty numbers on his service record.

==World War I==
When the United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917, &quot;Warrington&quot; began patrols off Newport to protect the harbor from German submarines. After six weeks of such duty and preparations for service overseas, she stood out of Boston on 21 May, bound for Europe. After a stop at Newfoundland en route, she arrived at Queenstown, on the southern coast of Ireland, on 1 June. There, she began six months of service patrolling the southern approaches to British ports on the Irish Sea and escorting convoys on the final leg of their voyage across the Atlantic to the British Isles. The destroyer operated out of Queenstown until late November 1917 when she was ordered to France.

She reached Brest, her new base of operations, on 29 November and resumed a grueling schedule of patrols and escort missions. Records indicate that she experienced only one apparent brush with a U-boat. On the morning of 31 May 1918, while escorting a convoy along the French coast, she received a distress call from the Navy transport which, earlier that morning, had been torpedoed by well out to sea. The destroyer parted company with her coastal convoy immediately and raced to rescue the sinking ship&#x27;s crew. She did not reach the area of the sinking until late that night but succeeded in rescuing 443 survivors just after 2300. took on all but one of the remaining 688 survivors of &quot;President Lincoln&quot;. That single exception, Lieutenant Edouard Isaacs, had the dubious honor of being rescued by &quot;U-90&quot;. On 1 June, during the voyage back to Brest, &quot;Warrington&quot; and &quot;Smith&quot; depth-charged the &quot;U-90&quot;. Lt. Isaacs, the captured naval officer who later escaped from a German prison camp, reported that the charges shook the submarine severely. However, no evidence of any success appeared on the surface; and the two destroyers, conscious of the importance of landing their human cargo, abandoned the attack and continued on to Brest. They entered that port the following day, disembarked the &quot;President Lincoln&quot; survivors, and resumed their patrol and escort missions.

Through the end of the war, &quot;Warrington&quot; operated out of Brest, patrolling against enemy submarines. However, the threat posed by the U-boats diminished considerably after the failure of Germany&#x27;s last offensive in July and an Allied offensive had made their bases on the Belgian coast untenable. Late in October, Germany discontinued unrestricted submarine warfare and, early in November, sued for peace.

==Inter-war period==
The armistice was concluded on 11 November 1918, but &quot;Warrington&quot; continued to serve in European waters until the spring of 1919. On 22 March, she stood out of Brest in the screen of a convoy of subchasers and tugs. After visiting the Azores and delivering her charges safely at Bermuda, the warship headed for Philadelphia. She reached the Delaware Capes early in May and remained in the Navy Yard at League Island until decommissioned on 31 January 1920.

&quot;Warrington&quot; lay at Philadelphia in reserve until 1935. On 20 March 1935, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. She was sold to M. Black &amp; Company, Norfolk, Virginia, on 28 June 1935 for scrapping in accordance with the terms of the London Treaty for the Limitation and Reduction of Naval Armaments.

<doc id="1322335" wikidata="Q2752019" url="?curid=1322335" title="Česnica">
<text>A česnica (Serbian Cyrillic: чесница, ; derived from the noun &quot;čest&quot;, meaning &quot;share&quot;), also called Božićna pogača (Serbian Cyrillic: Божићна погача, &quot;Christmas pogača&quot;) is the ceremonial, round loaf of bread that is an indispensable part of Christmas dinner in Serbian tradition. The preparation of this bread may be accompanied by various rules and rituals. A coin is often put into the dough during the kneading; other small objects may also be inserted. At the beginning of Christmas dinner, the česnica is rotated three times counterclockwise, before being broken among the family members. The person who finds the coin in his piece of the bread will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. The česnica was used in folk belief for divining or influencing the amount of crops.

==Preparation==
The česnica is usually made with wheat flour and baked on Christmas Eve or early Christmas morning by the head of household or the woman of the house. The water for the dough is in some areas collected on Christmas Day before sunrise from a spring or a well, into which a handful of grain is thrown. It is called the strong water and is believed to be imbued with beneficial power. The preparation of the bread may be accompanied by various rules: the flour is taken only from a full sack; the water for the dough is collected from three springs; the person who will prepare the česnica must bathe before that; etc. In eastern and southern Serbia, after they kneaded the dough for the česnica, the head of household or the woman of the house take hold with dough-stained hands of the fruit trees, beehives, and cattle to make them more productive.

A coin is often put into the dough during the kneading, some families using the same coin from year to year; it may be a valuable piece. In some regions, little figures carved from cornel wood, representing chickens, oxen, cows, swine, bees, and the like, are also put into the dough. In other areas, the inserted objects include grains, broad beans, walnuts, tufts of wool, twigs, and splinters from various wooden buildings. In Semberija, families insert a piece of the first splinter produced in felling the badnjak; this is done &quot;because of bees&quot;, as the reason is traditionally termed. Before baking, the upper surface of the loaf may be inscribed with various symbols, such as a Christogram, or stars, circles, and impressions of keys or combs.

In Vojvodina česnica is not a kind of bread, but a pastry made of layers of filo filled with roughly chopped nuts and raisins, similar to baklava, but drier and is usually made exclusively with added honey. A coin is placed at some point between the layers.

==Christmas dinner==

Christmas dinner is the most festive meal of the year. It begins about noon, or even earlier. The family members seated at the table stand up when the head of household gives a sign. The head makes the Sign of the Cross and lights a candle, before censing the gathered relatives and saying a prayer, after which they all kiss each other while saying, &quot;Peace of God, Christ Is Born.&quot; The head and another man of the family hold the česnica between themselves, rotating it three times counterclockwise. The česnica is then carefully broken among the relatives, so that each of them gets his own piece of the bread, without a crumb falling off.

Up to three pieces of the loaf may be set aside: one for the absent relatives (if there are such), one for a stranger who might join the family at the dinner, and one for the &quot;polaznik&quot;, their first visitor on Christmas Day (if he is not present). The rest of the česnica is consumed during the dinner. The family member who finds the coin in his piece of the bread will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. The head may try to buy the coin from this lucky relative. Each of the other objects hidden in the bread indicates the segment of the household economy in which the person who finds it in his share of the česnica will be especially successful.

In some regions, such as the Bay of Kotor and Bukovica, the česnica is not broken and eaten at Christmas dinner. It is instead placed on the table or nearby, with a candle stuck into it. The head of household lights this candle at the beginning of Christmas dinner. In Bukovica, several olive or bay laurel twigs are stuck around the candle. In the Bay of Kotor, the date when the česnica is eaten varies from place to place; it may be even twenty days after Christmas, on the Feast of Saint Sava. In some areas only half of the česnica is consumed at Christmas dinner, the other half being eaten a week later, on the Feast of St. Basil the Great.

==Folk belief==
In traditional folk belief, the česnica may be used for divination in some regions. In Bosnia, when the dough is shaped and ready for baking, a number of notches are cut in the upper surface of it, and seeds of various crops are placed into the notches. The more a notch has risen when the česnica is baked, the more productive the crop whose seed is in it will be in the following year. In Jadar, western Serbia, the number of embers of the badnjak equal to the sum of grain and livestock sorts grown by the family are taken out of the fire and placed on the česnica. Each of the sorts is associated with its own ember on that loaf. The sort whose ember retains its glow longer than the others should be the most productive in the coming year. To ensure an abundance of grain, some people place a bowl filled with grain on the česnica.

In 19th-century Herzegovina, two men would rotate the česnica between themselves, one of them asking, &quot;Am I protruding [from behind the česnica]?&quot; and the other responding, &quot;You are, a little.&quot; The first man would then say, &quot;Now a little, and next year not even a little.&quot; The purpose of this conversation was to invoke an abundance of grain in the coming year. A similar practice was recorded in the 12th century among West Slavs on the island of Rugia in the Baltic Sea. Those Slavs were adherents of the cult of Svantovit, and had a big temple dedicated to that god at Cape Arkona. Saxo Grammaticus described, in the Book XIV of his &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, the festival of Svantovit which was held annually after harvest in front of that temple. In one of the rituals, a round loaf of bread covered with honey, with the diameter equal to a man&#x27;s height, was held vertically in front of the statue of Svantovit. The priest of the temple went behind the loaf, before asking the gathered people whether they saw him. After they responded that they did, the priest expressed the wish that next year they would not see him. The aim of the ritual was to ensure a rich harvest of grain in the following year.

==Notes==

 Christmas does not fall on the same day for the Serbs as for the Western Christians, although they celebrate it on the same date—25 December. This is because the Serbian Orthodox Church uses the Julian calendar rather than the Gregorian used in the West. Since 1900, the Julian calendar is 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar, and this difference will remain until 2100. During this period, 25 December in the Julian calendar—Christmas for the Serbs—corresponds to 7 January of the following year in the Gregorian calendar.

<doc id="1322363" wikidata="Q1155712" url="?curid=1322363" title="Sonora Matancera">
<text>La Sonora Matancera is a Cuban band that played Latin American urban popular dance music. Founded in 1924 and led for more than five decades by guitarist, vocalist, composer, and producer Rogelio Martínez, musicologists consider it an icon of this type of music. Notable singers to have sung and recorded with the band include Bienvenido Granda, Daniel Santos, Myrta Silva, Miguelito Valdés, Leo Marini, Celia Cruz, Nelson Pinedo, Vicentico Valdés, Estanislao &quot;Laíto&quot; Sureda, Alberto Beltrán, Carlos Argentino, and Celio González.

==Early history: 1920s to 1940s==
===The founding of Tuna Liberal===
The group was founded on January 12, 1924 in Barrio Ojo de Agua, a neighborhood in the city of Matanzas. Culturally and demographically, this seaport is located in the most African region of Cuba. The ensemble was initially named Tuna Liberal for political reasons. The co-founders were Valentín Cané (director, tres, guitar and tumbadora, or as it is commonly called, conga. He was also a songwriter and later on a singer) and Pablo &quot;Bubú&quot; Vázquez Gobín (contrabass). The other original members were Manuel &quot;Jimagua&quot; Sánchez (timbales), Ismael Goberna (cornet/trumpet), Domingo Medina, José Manuel Valera, Julio Gobín, Juan Bautista Llopis (guitarists), and Eugenio Pérez, vocalist. One source believes Valera and Bautista Llopis were the vocalists while a second source holds to the position that Eugenio Pérez was the sole sonero. At this point, the band was just a commonplace group and had not yet developed its distinctive sound.

===The 1920s===
In 1925, Gerardo Machado, then Cuban President, invited Tuna Liberal to play at a party for his birthday. This marked a new acceptance for Afro-Cuban groups and a style of music that had previously been barred from certain restaurants and hotels.

Personnel changed in 1926, and the name of the band was changed to &quot;Septeto Soprano&quot;, due to supposed new singer Eugenio Pérez (according to one source), though he left a few months later. A different source credits the new name to the vocal range of the singer and maracas player, Carlos Manuel &quot;Caíto&quot; Díaz Alonso, who became a member the same year.

Rogelio Martínez joined the group in 1926, after Caíto recommended him to Valentín Cané. Another source indicates that Rogelio recommended Caíto to Valentín Cané, and that Caíto and Rogelio became members in 1927. A third source posits that Caíto and Rogelio joined the collective in 1926; both had recorded with pianist and bandleader Antonio María Romeu.
The group lost Domingo Medina, Julio Gobín, and Juan Bautista Llopis in their attempt at a more modern sound. In 1927, at the suggestion of Valentín Cané, the ensemble moved to Havana, intending to stay one week. It remained there for the next thirty-three years.

Havana was home to a thriving music scene in the 1920s. Septeto Soprano played their first engagements in La Habana at such popular nocturnal haunts as &quot;El Teatro Alhambra&quot;, &quot;El Centro Gallego&quot;, &quot;El Centro Asturiano&quot;, &quot;La Casa de los Médicos&quot;, &quot;El Club de los 20&quot;, &quot;El Club de los Anaranjados&quot; and other dance clubs. The group alternated at these nightspots with other ensembles of the day, including the likes of Sexteto Habanero, &quot;Sexteto Munamar&quot;, Sexteto Boloña, &quot;Septeto Nacional de Ignacio Piñeiro&quot; (one source asserts that this ensemble was a sexteto, not a septeto, at this time), &quot;Sexteto Pinareño&quot;, and &quot;Sexteto Gloria Cubana&quot;. At first the collective did not have an easy time due to the professionalism of the other tríos, &quot;cuartetos&quot;, sextetos, and septetos active at this time, but carved out a niche for itself in the Cuban capital.

The move to Havana proved to be consequential. In 1928, the collective made its first recordings, for its first label, RCA-Victor. The ensemble would eventually record for thirteen different labels.

In 1929, the band signed a contract to perform live on the airwaves of Radio Progreso, making appearances on this station for many years.

===The 1930s===
Son ensembles of this time added pianos to broaden their contrapuntal and harmonic vocabulary. Trumpets, sometimes as many as three, replaced cornets. The additional instruments meant sextetos and septetos evolved into conjuntos. Septeto Soprano added a piano during this decade but did not expand its brass section until the 1940s.

Septeto Soprano made only one recording during this decade. It was for RCA-Victor.

Some of the individuals important to the group&#x27;s success began their long association with the collective in the 1930s. In 1932, Rogelio Martínez was appointed co-director. He was influential in determining the destiny of the conjunto. Juan Bautista Llopis returned for a brief period, and a new percussionist, &quot;José &quot;Manteca&quot; Rosario Chávez&quot;, became a member. Three more sources say that Manteca joined in 1929 while one other source states that this happened in 1935. Manteca filled the vacancy created when Jimagua left.

The collective changed its name to &quot;Estudiantina Sonora Matancera&quot; in the early 1930s. Each change in the group&#x27;s name was indicative of a change in instrumentation and its corresponding stylistic change.

In 1935, vocalist Manolo Barquín occasionally sang with the group. That year it adopted its formal name, Conjunto Sonora Matancera. Calixto Leicea and Humberto Cané (son of Valentín Cané) became members in this year. Another source claims Humberto Cané joined in 1929.

Calixto Leicea replaced Ismael Goberna, who retired because of poor health and died a few months later. By then, Calixto had played and made his name with Sexteto Nacional (led by Ignacio Piñeiro), Chaveo y Su Grupo, Juventud Habanera, Sexteto Guarina, and María Teresa Vera. As was common with musicians of his generation throughout Latin America, he had been a member of a government-sponsored municipal band, &quot;La Banda Municipal de Matanzas&quot; (prior to embarking on a career as a professional musician), getting a firm musical education in the process. Calixto Leicea was an excellent songwriter and arranger. The band recorded many of his compositions as well as arrangements. The collective&#x27;s theme song &quot;Traigo un tono&quot; is a guaracha composed in 1947 by Calixto.

Humberto Cané succeeded his father on tres and, as well, sang. Valentín Cané, having ceded to his eldest son the tres chair, remained a valuable member of the collective, as he still sang, composed and — in a new role — played tumbadora. The departure of Humberto Cané in 1944 signaled the end of the tres as part of the permanent instrumentation of the group.

Dámaso Pérez Prado (later, in the 1950s, famous as &quot;El Rey del Mambo&quot;) was the band&#x27;s first pianist and one of its earliest arrangers from 1936 to 1939. &quot;Severino &quot;Refresquito&quot; Ramos&quot; was the primary arranger, as well as pianist, from 1939 (but especially since 1942) to 1944 and, as such, principal architect of the sonic identity of this conjunto. After 1944, he limited himself to arranging and composing.

In this decade, La Sonora Matancera faced strong competition from such ensembles as Sexteto Guarina, Juventud Habanera de Joseíto Fernández, Sexteto Nacional de Ignacio Piñeiro, Sexteto Segundo Nacional, Trío Matamoros, Sexteto Casino (it would later become a conjunto), Sexteto María Teresa Vera, Conjunto Kubavana, Belisario López, and Orquesta Antonio María Romeu. There was a rivalry between Sexteto Nacional de Ignacio Piñeiro and Sonora Matancera.

The ensemble terminated its association with Radio Progreso by the end of the decade. In 1939, it was signed to a contract by the ownership/management of Radio CMQ (or simply CMQ) for a series of live broadcasts.

===The 1940s===
Bienvenido Granda sang lead vocals from 1940 to 1954, the first truly important sonero to perform and record with the conjunto. Another source says that he joined La Sonora Matancera in 1942 while a third source says it was in 1944. Whatever the case may be, his association with Sonora Matancera made it famous throughout the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. No one recorded more tunes with the ensemble than Bienvenido Granda, as he made over 200 recordings during his time with the ensemble.

In 1942, La Sonora Matancera left CMQ. It would now broadcast — with Bienvenido Granda as lead singer — over the airwaves of RHC Radio.

Pedro Knight and &quot;Ezequiel &quot;Lino&quot; Frías&quot; left Arsenio Rodríguez&#x27;s conjunto to join Sonora Matancera on the same day in 1944. These two steered the collective towards a more modern sound. The one gave the brass section more heft while the other enhanced the rhythm section. Pianist Lino Frías anchored La Sonora&#x27;s rhythm section until 1976. He was also a superb composer and arranger.

In 1944, the conjunto made its next-to-last recordings for RCA-Victor. It also was signed to a recording contract by the newly established Panart Records.

Original director Valentín Cané led the group till an asthmatic condition forced him to retire in 1946. He continued to receive pay as if he were an active member of La Sonora Matancera till he died two years later. In 1946, in place of Valentín Cané, Tata Güines, who was a member of the groundbreaking ensemble led by Israel &quot;Cachao&quot; López in the late 1950s and the early 1960s, became the conguero for a short time. &quot;Carlos &quot;Patato&quot; Valdés&quot; also held this position for a few months.

Ángel &quot;Yiyo&quot; Alfonso Furias took over the tumbadora chair in 1948 and thus completed the quintessential lineup. From 1948 to 1954, it consisted of:

* Calixto Leicea: first trumpet chair;
* Pedro Knight: second trumpet chair;
* Pablo &quot;Bubú&quot; Vázquez Gobín: contrabass;
* Ezequiel &quot;Lino&quot; Frías: piano;
* José &quot;Manteca&quot; Rosario Chávez: timbalitos, bongó and &quot;cencerro&quot; (also known as &quot;campana&quot;);
* Ángel &quot;Yiyo&quot; Alfonso Furias: tumbadora;
* Rogelio Martínez: Director, guitar and coro (background vocals);
* Carlos Manuel &quot;Caíto&quot; Díaz Alonso: maracas and coro;
* Bienvenido Granda: lead vocals, coro (whether he or some other sonero sang lead with the band) and claves.

Sonora Matancera honed its skills over a generation — from the late 1920s to the late 1940s — in the &quot;academias de baile&quot; (a special type of dance hall), such as the famous &quot;Marte y Belona&quot;, where nightly La Sonora drew record crowds of the best dancers. Apart from this prestigious &quot;academia&quot;, other nightspots where La Sonora Matancera entertained the dancing public in the early 1940s were El Habana Sport, another academia de baile, Centro Castellano, La Tropical (one source lists a dance hall called &quot;La Cervecería Tropical&quot;; it is not at all clear if these two are one and the same) and Las Playitas. The collective during this time also made live broadcasts on Radio Progreso. Later that same decade Sonora Matancera frequently played in such top dance venues as El Club Atlético Santiago de Las Vegas, Quibikán, Centro Gallego, El Edén Concert, Sans Souci, El Tropicana and Centro Asturiano. At this time La Sonora always performed on the feast day of August 15, known as La Tutelar, at El Liceo Guanabacoa while Arsenio Rodríguez y Su Conjunto Orquestal Todos Estrellas and Antonio Arcaño y sus Maravillas (Cachao and his brother Orestes López were members of this orchestra at the time) engaged in a musical &quot;mano a mano&quot; on the same day at &quot;El Manantial de la Cotorra&quot;. Its long tenure in the &quot;academias&quot; served La Sonora Matancera well as it transformed the ensemble into an excellent dance band.

In the 1940s, the conjunto more than held its own against such important groups as Orquesta Casino de La Playa, Arsenio Rodríguez, Orquesta Ideal, Cheo Belén Puig, Antonio Arcaño y sus Maravillas, Conjunto Jóvenes del Cayo, and Orquesta Almendra. Together with this cooperative these bands made Cuba &quot;El Paraíso Musical de las Américas&quot; (&quot;The Musical Paradise of the Americas&quot;).

From the mid-1940s till the end of the 1950s, the collective had a program as &quot;artistas exclusivos&quot; (&quot;exclusive artists&quot;) on Radio CMQ called &quot;Cascabeles Candado&quot;.

In the period 1947–1948, the group made a number of recordings (Bienvenido Granda as lead singer on the majority of these numbers) as Conjunto Tropicavana or Conjunto Tropicabana. The name change was to avoid legal problems, since the band was still under contract to Panart Records.

As this decade drew to a close, Sonora Matancera decided on a course of action that would become standard practice: the incorporation of non-Cuban lead singers into its ranks (without excluding the use of Cuban artists). The first non-Cuban singers were Puerto Ricans, singer/composer Daniel Santos and guarachera/songwriter Myrta Silva. Some of these vocalists were featured lead singers. Others were invited to record a limited number of songs during a brief period of time.

Daniel Santos performed and recorded with the collective beginning in 1948. His five-year stay with La Sonora helped it achieve world-wide fame. The cooperative returned to airing live broadcasts at Radio Progreso in 1948 with Daniel Santos as the featured lead vocalist.

Myrta Silva was the first woman to join the musical collective. Over a short time in 1949, she recorded four studio sessions with the conjunto. She left by 1950. Myrta returned in 1952 and made a number of live recordings.

In 1949, the ensemble recorded twenty-two songs for Ansonia Records. The conjunto made said recordings using its real name. That same year, moreover, it signed with Seeco Records, which was owned by New York City-based Sidney Siegel. The first recording for this label was made on November 25, 1949, the guaracha &quot;Tocando madera&quot;, with Bienvenido Granda as sonero. The association with Seeco Records lasted until 1966, with the last recordings having been made in the prior year. The source does not indicate if the group was still contractually obligated to Panart Records when it recorded for Ansonia and when it signed, as well as recorded, with Seeco.

==Late 1940s to late 1950s==

La Sonora Matancera&#x27;s most successful period was from 1947 until 1959. This was its golden age. By the early 1950s, the ensemble made live broadcasts from the studios of Radio Progreso, Radio CMBG, and Radio CMQ. These stations broadcast on shortwave radio, which helped increase the collective&#x27;s popularity in Latin America. During this decade, the band — besides these regular bookings on Cuban radio — had its calendar filled with club dates, film appearances, and tours overseas. The majority of its recordings were made at this time.

===Temporary change to Big Band style===
Besides personnel and instrumental changes, Sonora Matancera, as already illustrated, underwent stylistic changes. In 1950, the conjunto expanded to big band (&quot;orquesta&quot;) size, making a series of recordings with Daniel Santos. Though these met with approval, the orquesta reverted to a conjunto.

About 1950, the ensemble recorded eighty tunes for Stinson Records using the name of Sonora Cubana. It already had recorded ten numbers under this name and would record two additional songs as Sonora Cubana; the record company for these twelve tunes is not named by the source. The lead vocalist on these recordings is Bienvenido Granda.

===Addition of Celia Cruz, personnel changes and the first overseas tour===
Celia Cruz succeeded Myrta Silva in 1950, performing and recording with the conjunto until 1965. Fans of the cooperative at first did not accept Celia as a worthy replacement for Myrta, but by 1951 she had won the audience over. In 1962, she married second trumpeter Pedro Knight, who later became her &quot;protector, manager, and musical director&quot;.

Cruz&#x27;s first recording with the conjunto was made on December 15, 1950. It was for Seeco Records. &quot;Cao cao, maní picao&quot; was an instant success, a &quot;bombshell&quot;. Seeco had an extensive distribution network, allowing it to ship its recordings of different artists, including La Sonora, throughout Latin America.

Personnel changes in 1954 included the replacement by Estanislao &quot;Laíto&quot; Sureda of Bienvenido Granda as male lead singer; Bienvenido left after a heated argument with Rogelio Martínez over money: he wanted higher pay than his colleagues, but in the collective all received the same salary. One other personnel change occurred this year. Elpidio Vázquez, a son of Bubú, replaced him on contrabass.

The conjunto made its first overseas tour in 1955. It performed in Panama, Colombia, Venezuela and Costa Rica. In the course of the Colombia tour, Carlos Argentino joined the band as a singer and remainted till 1959.

Manteca left either in 1955 or in 1957, retiring as had other members through the years because of health matters. Simón Domingo &quot;Minino&quot; Esquijarroza then became the percussionist.

In 1956, Celio González replaced Laíto on lead vocals (besides singing coro with Rogelio, Caíto, and Laíto and playing the güiro); he stayed until 1959. Refresquito retired in 1957, and Javier Vázquez, another son of Bubú, then became the principal arranger. In 1959, the conjunto undertook another overseas tour, playing in Venezuela, Peru, Chile, and Uruguay; the year is considered the ensemble&#x27;s high-water mark.

==The Middle Period: 1960s to 1970s==
===Leaving Cuba and its aftermath: 1960–1961===

The cooperative began the decade with a tour of Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Aruba, and Curaçao, but the political upheaval following the Cuban Revolution affected the group greatly. Having signed a lucrative contract to perform in Mexico City, the group, accompanied by Celia Cruz, left Havana on June 15, 1960. Minino decided to stay; the conjunto never returned to Cuba.

On July 15, 1960 two new singers joined the group, Willy &quot;El Baby&quot; Rodríguez and Alberto Pérez Sierra. Of the eleven new vocalists associated with La Sonora Matancera in the 1960s, only two remained for any appreciable amount of time, Willy &quot;El Baby&quot; Rodríguez and Justo &quot;El Mulato&quot; Betancourt. In 1961, Mario &quot;Papaíto&quot; Muñoz joined the ensemble as the new timbalero/bongosero/campanero. Additionally, Celio González returned and continued as sonero and güiro player until 1965.

===1962–1965===
In 1962, Sonora Matancera established itself in New York City, where it continued to perform Cuban/Afro-Cuban urban popular dance music. Its residency in New York would last for thirty-nine years, longer than their stay in Havana.

In 1965, Celia, Celio and Willy all ended their affiliation with the collective. Celia Cruz went on to become a significant and celebrated performer of so-called salsa music, and was known as the &quot;Queen of Salsa&quot;.

In that same year, Caíto and Lino were among the vocalists and instrumentalists gathered by Dominican-born Johnny Pacheco for a classic studio recording. Besides Caíto and Lino two other musicians associated with La Sonora played on this album. One was from the past (Patato) and one was a trumpeter who would be invited to participate in a 1981 recording session (&quot;Pedro &quot;Puchi&quot; Boulong&quot;).

===A Time of Transition: 1966–1969===
Pedro Knight retired as a trumpeter in 1967 to be Celia Cruz&#x27;s full-time manager. &quot;Ramón Emilio &quot;Chiripa&quot; Aracena&quot; became the new second trumpet chair that same year.

Leo Marini, a vocal mainstay during the 1950s, renewed his association by recording an album with the cooperative in 1969.

The latter half of the decade saw the emergence of two new musical genres, the Boogaloo and the closely related &quot;shing-a-ling&quot;. These musical styles were born in New York City of the admixture of Latin — specifically Cuban/Afro-Cuban rhythms — and rhythm and blues in its incarnation as soul music. Many New York-based groups recorded in this style to satisfy their record companies. La Sonora Matancera also recorded an album, &quot;Sonora Boogaloo&quot;, even though they were recording at this time for their own label. Soon after Sonora Matancera returned to their earlier style.

At the end of the 1960s six of the nine members of La Sonora were stalwarts of the glory years.

===1970s===
Over the course of this decade, soneros and instrumentalists came and went. Instrumentational and stylistic changes were the order of the day as well.

During this time, La Sonora Matancera continued to record, perform at dance clubs, and tour overseas. Early in the 1970s, the ensemble played at Carnegie Hall. Eventually, it would travel to Europe, playing in Spain, France, Germany, and Finland.

In 1970, Justo Betancourt left, to be replaced by Gabriel Eladio &quot;Yayo el Indio&quot; Peguero. This was a significant change in lead singers, for Yayo remained with Sonora Matancera for more than two decades. He recorded only forty-four songs. This does not negate the fact that Yayo was the most important sonero to perform and record with the cooperative in its later years.

In 1971, Chiripa left the ensemble. &quot;Saúl Torres&quot; entered in his stead. Carlos Argentino, a veteran of the golden age, rejoined and recorded with La Sonora in the same year. In 1972, Leo Marini returned to the collective (without evidence of recording that year).
Between 1973 and 1977, the brass section comprised six different trumpeters. The most prominent was Alfredo &quot;Chocolate&quot; Armenteros, a former member of Arsenio Rodríguez&#x27;s seminal conjunto in the 1940s.

The individual members of the ensemble were seen by other artists as exemplars of their craft. In 1975, Caíto sang on one of the cuts at a recording session at CBS Studios in New York City. This recording session yielded a double album of Cuban dance music and Afro-Cuban folkloric music, the first of a two-album series. These two albums are considered to be among the best recordings of Cuban/Afro-Cuban music made in the 1970s. Chocolate was one of the instrumentalists assembled for this recording date, prior to his joining the cooperative.

After thirty-two years Lino Frías and La Sonora Matancera parted ways in 1976. Lino went on to play on two albums recorded that year with a collection of top singers and musicians under the aegis of Cachao. He was also the pianist and musical director on the first album made by &quot;Armando Sánchez&quot; and his conjunto. He may have continued in this vein if not for poor health. These three albums were recorded by small, independent labels not controlled by Fania Records. Javier Vázquez followed Lino Frías as pianist and in so doing assumed dual responsibilities with the collective.

In 1977, Miguelito Valdés, having recorded with Sonora Matancera in 1951, did so once more. Contemporary touches were added to the cooperative&#x27;s instrumentation, with electronic piano, organ and electric guitar employed during this session.

Calixto Leicea stopped recording with the collective in 1978, although he accompanied La Sonora wherever it performed. In that same year, recordings made in 1977 by Miguelito Valdés with the group were re-released.

Five veterans of the glory days were still active with the cooperative at the close of the 1970s.

==The Late Period: 1980s to present day==
===The 1980s===

The decade of the 1980s began with the departure of Yiyo, a member for thirty-two years. He was replaced by Alberto Valdés. Chocolate also left in this year, being succeeded by Héctor &quot;Bomberito&quot; Zarzuela, a long-time member of Pacheco&#x27;s conjuntos. This year saw the addition of a third trumpet and a third coro vocalist, bringing the number of instrumentalists and singers to twelve.

In 1980, the contrabass and the piano were replaced by electronic counterparts (in the case of the piano for the second time). In this year Celia Cruz returned to record one more album. Rhythm instruments, violins and organ can be heard on several of the recorded numbers, but were possibly an electronic illusion on the part of the pianist and not the actual instruments themselves. Critics saw experiments with electrical effects as emblematic of a loss of originality, although the attempt was a temporary one.

In 1981, La Sonora Matancera recorded an album for Bárbaro Records, a subsidiary of the Fania Records empire co-founded by Johnny Pacheco and Jerry Masucci. The artists on this recording, for the most part, had been specially invited for the recording date. The tres made its return on one number played by Mario Hernández, the much-admired Puerto Rican tresero. &quot;Elpidio Vázquez, Jr.&quot; also performed on this date as the substitute bass player on one song. He represented the third consecutive generation of his family to be a member of Sonora Matancera. Justo Betancourt was the sonero.

The old guard continued to resurface. Celia Cruz recorded a final album with the ensemble in 1982.

In 1984, the collective recorded with the singer Ismael Miranda. He was for many years sonero with Larry Harlow&#x27;s orchestra.

1985 was a year of change. Bomberito left, to be replaced by Ken Fradley. Fradley had been a charter member of &quot;Saoco&quot;, the short-lived but important conjunto. Two artists constituted the coro on Saoco&#x27;s first album: Yayo el Indio (a member of La Sonora) and Adalberto Santiago (a sonero who would record with La Sonora Matancera in 1993). The individual members of Sonora Matancera, even at this late date, were held in high esteem. The cooperative still attracted top talent, vocalists and instrumentalists alike.

In 1989, La Sonora celebrated its sixty-fifth anniversary of existence. This landmark achievement was commemorated by concerts in Central Park and Carnegie Hall. Their appearance at the last-named venue has been preserved on vinyl. Of the fourteen soneros on this recording, nine were veterans of the gilded age. This was the last occasion when these artists would perform with the collective. In this year Javier Vázquez left after thirteen years as pianist and thirty-two years as chief arranger. &quot;José Luis Cruz&quot; became the new keyboardist.

===The 1990s===
Caíto died in 1990 after sixty-three years with the group. He was succeeded by Fernando Lavoy.

In 1993, La Sonora Matancera recorded an album in Mexico, &quot;De Nuevo&quot;, with Adalberto Santiago on lead vocals. In the same year Willy &quot;El Baby&quot; Rodríguez rejoined La Sonora. Sonora Matancera lost the services of Yayo el Indio in 1994. He retired as the singer with the longest continuous tenure with the ensemble. At this time the personnel lineup consisted of nine members. Three of them were associated with the cooperative since at least the 1950s.

===Later history: 2000 to 2013===
For traditionalists, the death of Rogelio Martínez on May 13, 2001 marked the end of La Sonora. Javier Vázquez, with the blessing of Rogelio Martínez, Jr., leads a group of the same name in Las Vegas, Nevada.

==Characteristic features==
La Sonora Matancera is characterized by its use of two trumpets. Furthermore, contrabass, piano, timbalitos, bongós, cencerro, and tumbadora are prominently featured. Sonora Matancera was also distinguished by its backup singers, or &quot;coro&quot;. It usually consisted of Rogelio Martínez and Carlos Manuel &quot;Caíto&quot; Díaz Alonso, whose falsetto delivery was derived from a traditional singing style of the earliest soneros (called in Cuba &quot;voz de vieja&quot;).

The group&#x27;s style in the 1940s was described as &quot;white&quot; or &quot;mulato&quot; in comparison to other groups in the same genre; while race in 1940s/1950s Cuba didn&#x27;t necessarily mean much in terms of audience it did affect which clubs groups could play in, and access to record production and distribution. The addition of Celia Cruz, according to Ned Sublette, made La Sonora &quot;sound blacker&quot;.

<doc id="1322392" wikidata="Q1591491" url="?curid=1322392" title="Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas">
<text>&quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; is a song written in 1943 by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane and introduced by Judy Garland in the 1944 MGM musical &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;. Frank Sinatra later recorded a version with modified lyrics. In 2007, ASCAP ranked it the third most performed Christmas song during the preceding five years that had been written by ASCAP members.
In 2004 it finished at No. 76 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs rankings of the top tunes in North American cinema.

==&quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;==
The song was written in 1943 for the film &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;, for which MGM had hired Martin and Blane to write several songs. Martin was vacationing in a house in the neighborhood of Southside in Birmingham, Alabama, that his father Hugh Martin had designed for his mother as a honeymoon cottage, located just down the street from his birthplace, and which later became the home of Martin and his family in 1923. The song first appeared in a scene in which a family is distraught by the father&#x27;s plans to move to New York City for a job promotion, leaving behind their beloved home in St. Louis, Missouri, just before the long-anticipated 1904 World&#x27;s Fair begins. In a scene set on Christmas Eve, Judy Garland&#x27;s character, Esther, sings the song to cheer up her despondent five-year-old sister, Tootie, played by Margaret O&#x27;Brien.

==Lyrics and revisions==
Some of the original lyrics penned by Martin were rejected before filming began. When presented with the original draft lyric, Garland, her co-star Tom Drake and director Vincente Minnelli criticized the song as depressing, and asked Martin to change the lyrics. Though he initially resisted, Martin made several changes to make the song more upbeat. For example, the lines &quot;It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past&quot; became &quot;Let your heart be light / Next year all our troubles will be out of sight&quot;. Garland&#x27;s version of the song, which was also released as a single by Decca Records, became popular among United States troops serving in World War II; her performance at the Hollywood Canteen brought many soldiers to tears.

In 1957, when Frank Sinatra approached Martin to record the song, he asked him to revise the lyrics to promote more positive themes; he particularly pointed out the line &quot;until then we&#x27;ll have to muddle through somehow,&quot; saying &quot;the name of my album is &quot;A Jolly Christmas&quot;. Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?&quot; Martin&#x27;s revised lyric was &quot;hang a shining star upon the highest bough.&quot; Martin made several other alterations, changing from the future tense to the present, so that the song&#x27;s focus is a celebration of present happiness rather than anticipation of a better future. (However, Sinatra had recorded the original song&#x27;s lyrics in 1948.) On &quot;The Judy Garland Show Christmas Special&quot;, Garland sang the song to her children Joey and Lorna Luft with Sinatra&#x27;s revised lyrics.

In 2001, Martin, occasionally active as a pianist with religious ministries since the 1980s, wrote an entirely new set of lyrics to the song with John Fricke, &quot;Have Yourself a Blessed Little Christmas,&quot; a religious version of the secular Christmas standard. The song was recorded by female gospel vocalist Del Delker with Martin accompanying her on piano.

In a 2002 interview, NewSong lead singer Michael O&#x27;Brien claimed that the line &quot;through the years, we all will be together if the Lord allows,&quot; was part of the original song but was purged and replaced with &quot;if the fates allow&quot; to remove religious reference when the song was released. O&#x27;Brien stated that while a pastor in a California church in 1990, he had met Martin, who played piano at the church where O&#x27;Brien was serving for an evening, and the pastor was told, &quot;That&#x27;s the original way I wrote it, so I want you to sing it this way.&quot;

==Collaboration controversy==
Although Ralph Blane is credited with writing the music for many of Martin&#x27;s songs, Martin claimed in his autobiography that he wrote both music and lyrics to all of the songs in &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; and that &quot;all of the so-called Martin and Blane songs (except for &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot;) were written entirely by me (solo) without help from Ralph or anybody else.&quot; His explanation for allowing Blane equal credit for the songs was: &quot;I was reasonably content to let him receive equal screen credit, sheet music credit, ASCAP royalties, etc., mainly because this bizarre situation was caused by my naive and atrocious lack of business acumen.&quot;

==Cover versions==
Judy Garland&#x27;s 1944 version of the song reached No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

Tori Amos included an acoustic version of the song as the B-side to her 1998 single &quot;Spark&quot;.

In 1993, Tatsuro Yamashita sang a cover version with orchestra included album &quot;Season&#x27;s Greetings&quot;.

Chicago covered this song in their nineteenth studio album &quot;Chicago XXV: The Christmas Album&quot; with Champlin and Scheff as vocals. This album was re-issued in 2003 as &quot;What&#x27;s It Gonna Be, Santa?&quot;

In 2009, Keyshia Cole reached number 58 on the US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart with a version of the song.

In 2011, Michael Bublé&#x27;s version reached number 98 on the top 100 charts. This version would reach a new peak of 41 in 2023.

In 2014, English singer Sam Smith released a cover version which debuted at number 90 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the first time a version of the song had charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; list. The song reached top ten on the US and Canadian adult contemporary charts and on the US Holiday chart. It also peaked inside the top forty in Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Switzerland.

In 2016, Josh Groban reached number 1 on the US adult contemporary charts with a version of the song.

In December 2017, Sabrina Carpenter sang a cover version.

In 2018, at least three new versions of the song were released:
* John Legend reached number 1 on the US adult contemporary charts with a version of the song from his album &quot;A Legendary Christmas&quot;, featuring Esperanza Spalding on duet vocals.
* Azealia Banks, American rapper and singer songwriter released a cover of this song on her Christmas EP Icy Colors Change.
* New Zealand band The Beths released a single with their cover version.

In 2023, former Fifth Harmony members Ally Brooke and Dinah Jane released a new cover version of the song.

===Lorna Luft version===
In 1995, American singer Lorna Luft, daughter of Judy Garland, recorded a cover of &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; which was reworked as a &quot;virtual duet&quot; with her mother Judy Garland. It was produced by Gordon Lorenz and released as a CD single only in the UK by Carlton Sounds label. A music video featured Luft performing the song in a studio interspersed with classic footage of Garland singing to a then 11-year-old Luft on the 1963 Christmas episode of her CBS variety television series &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;, all placed on the same screen.

Luft&#x27;s version of the song peaked at number 100 on the UK singles chart on December 16, 1995.

<text>Edouard Victor Michel Izac (December 18, 1891 – January 18, 1990) was a lieutenant in the United States Navy during World War I and a Medal of Honor recipient. From 1937 to 1947, he served five terms as a Representative from California.

Born in Cresco, Iowa, Izac grew up in a rural setting, graduating from United States Naval Academy in 1915. He was posted to the troop transport in 1918 when that ship was sunk by German submarine . Taken as a prisoner of war, and not letting his captors know that he spoke German, Izac gathered intelligence on the submarine and its crew before being transferred to prison camps in Germany, from where he escaped in October 1918.

Izac subsequently moved to San Diego and was elected as a Democrat to California&#x27;s 20th congressional district, where he chaired the House Naval Affairs Committee and had oversight of Naval activities in the Pacific during World War II. Despite initially being hesitant to enter the war and remaining cautious to expanded U.S. involvement, experiences touring Nazi concentration camps in 1945 ultimately hardened his resolve. Nonetheless, he lost his bid for a sixth term in Congress in 1946. Izac spent much of the rest of his life writing and farming in the Washington, D.C., area and was the last living Medal of Honor recipient of World War I when he died in 1990 at 98.

== Early years ==
Edouard Victor Michel Izac was born on December 18, 1891 in Cresco, Howard County, Iowa, the youngest of nine children to Balthazar Izac, a builder of farm wagons, and Mathilda Geuth. His father emigrated to the United States from Alsace-Lorraine in 1852 amid instability from the coup d&#x27;état instigated by Napoleon III, while his mother was born in Philadelphia to a family that immigrated from Baden-Württemberg. Balthazar Izac&#x27;s name was changed to Isaacs by immigration officials as he entered the country, and all of his children except for Edouard adopted this spelling of the name as well. The family spoke an Alsatian dialect of German at home, and Izac learned to speak French early in his life.

Izac attended the School of the Assumption in Cresco, before moving to attend high school in South St. Paul, Minnesota. He decided to enter the United States Naval Academy to get a &quot;complete education,&quot; seeing private colleges as out of reach. After securing a recommendation from a Congressman in Chicago, he was appointed to the academy. Izac did not excel in academics at the Academy, however he did meet Agnes Cabell, daughter of General DeRosey Caroll Cabell, at a dance. Izac graduated the Academy in 1915, and he and Cabell were married the next day.

== Military service ==
Following his graduation, Izac was assigned to the battleship , as the United States began its involvement in World War I. When he was promoted from ensign to lieutenant (junior grade), he signed up for the Naval Transport Service, hoping for assignments less open-ended than battleship duty. During this time, his daughter Cabell was born in 1916. He transferred to the troop transport in July 1917, and helped to oversee the conversion of that ship from an ocean liner to a ship of war, duties which kept the ship in drydock until its maiden voyage on 18 October. The ship subsequently undertook four uneventful trips to Europe, including one in November 1917 escorting U.S. Representative Clarence B. Miller.

===Capture and escape===
By the ship&#x27;s fifth voyage, Izac was its executive officer. During this voyage, the ship successfully ferried troops to Brest, France, on May 23, 1918, and began the return trip, in convoy, to New York City on May 29. The next day, the destroyer escort for the convoy departed, leaving four troopships to cross the sea alone. Izac was in command of the guns on the afterdeck. A submarine was spotted early in the morning on May 31 and the ships attempted to evade it unsuccessfully. &quot;President Lincoln&quot; was from the coast of France when it was struck by three torpedoes at a range of about at 08:54 by German submarine . By 09:15, her captain, Commander Percy Wright Foote ordered the ship abandoned. &quot;President Lincoln&quot; rolled starboard at 09:30 and sank, but only took 26 men in a crew of 700 with her. The rest remained in lifeboats as the rest of the convoy headed to a safe distance, as was policy at the time. &quot;U-90&quot; then surfaced, attempting to locate the ship&#x27;s captain, but was unable to do so, pulling Izac out of a lifeboat instead because its crew recognized his officers&#x27; insignia. Izac was taken as a prisoner of war after lying to the sub&#x27;s crew that the captain had gone down with the ship. He was subsequently held in quarters aboard the ship while it dived to avoid depth charges from the pursuing .
Izac later recalled that he was treated well while a prisoner, dining with the ship&#x27;s officers and playing bridge and other card games with the crew. During political discussions on the boat, he also learned about the German mindset and conditions for German U-Boat crews, which were generally superior to conditions in other ships at the time. During this time, he began to take mental notes of the submarine and the routines and operations of her crew, hoping to gather intelligence that could be useful against German submarine efforts. He concealed his knowledge of German language which he used to listen in on the crew. Using maps and binoculars borrowed from the crew, Izac was able to ascertain the ship&#x27;s return route to Kiel, which took it north of the Shetland Islands, into the North Sea and past Skagerrack and Kattegat in a bid to avoid minefields and patrols. He also learned of a rendezvous point used by U-boats near Denmark to avoid patrols, though was thwarted in his first escape attempt there. He also learned of at least one island where sub crews were commonly landing to poach mutton, which he considered ideal for a trap. Arriving in Kiel on June 10, he was transferred to , on which he was ferried to a prison camp in Karlsruhe. Conditions there were more difficult and the prisoners were fed less, so he tried unsuccessfully to escape again.

Four weeks later, as Izac was moved to Villingen by train, he attempted to escape again by jumping headfirst out of a window as the train was traveling but struck his head and knees on the railroad ties and was caught and beaten by guards for the attempt, then forced to run the remaining to the prison camp. Bedridden by his injuries for three weeks, he was then sentenced to two weeks of solitary confinement. Izac would be unable to bend his knees for two months. During his initial recapture, a guard broke his rifle striking Izac and was court martialed for destruction of military property; after the war Izac sought damages from a claims commission and was awarded $27,000 for the incident. By the time he left solitary confinement, Izac had lost and weighed . Conditions in this camp were more harsh and Izac prepared to escape here by walking, running and weightlifting as he continued his recovery. But conditions at the camp continued to deteriorate, especially for the Russian prisoners of war.

On the night of October 6, Izac and a group of American prisoners succeeded in a mass escape from the prison by cutting power and leaving the premises dressed as German guards. To avoid dogs and other pursuers, he and another American officer, Harold Buckley Willis, hiked a roundabout route to Switzerland. They traveled through the Black Forest and along the Alb, followed a rail line and crossed the Rhine River, crossing the border early in the morning of 13 October. Their path had taken them through even though a direct route from the camp to the closest Swiss border was away. They survived on raw vegetables along the way. From the crossing he was taken to the American Embassy in Bern, where he was given money by the American Red Cross to travel to Paris, which he reached on 22 October. From there, he was taken to London, where he met with Admiral William Sims on 23 October, and finally returned to the Bureau of Navigation, arriving on November 11, 1918, Armistice Day.

=== Subsequent career ===
Welcomed to the Department of the Navy as a hero, Izac was promoted to lieutenant commander within a few months and assigned to a prestigious post as the director of munitions at the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., moving there with his family. He was subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt on November 11, 1920, with whom he became friends. In addition, he was awarded the Italian Croce di Guerra and the Cross of Montenegro. However, the injuries he sustained to his knees in his escape attempts ended his Navy career and Izac was forced to retire.

Living only on a small pension, Izac moved his family to a home of his father-in-law in San Diego, where he took a job selling ads for the &quot;San Diego Union&quot; from 1922 to 1929, during which time he also began working as a freelance writer, focused mainly on subjects on problems of war veterans, history, and English. The newspaper job was lost following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and he briefly moved the family to rural France, living simply, likely off of the money awarded from the German government.

== Political career ==
Izac returned to San Diego in 1931. Three years later, a group of veterans in the city convinced him to run for Congress in California&#x27;s 20th congressional district. He secured nominations from both the Democratic and Progressive parties, but ultimately lost the election to Republican George Burnham.

Campaigning again in 1936, Izac changed his strategy and used his war record and Medal of Honor award as selling points in his political campaign. He retold the story of his capture in various rallies, becoming noted for his animation while speaking. A supporter of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies, Izac promoted a policy of neutrality, support for veterans, and advocated for a larger military presence in San Diego as an economic anchor. During the campaign, he raised $40 each from a group of 40 veterans under the condition of repaying them should he lose. Crafting a political image that tied him as a friend to Roosevelt, a patriot and with first-hand experience in poverty, he won the election in 1936.

=== Congress ===

Sworn in to the Seventy-fifth Congress, Izac advocated for non-interventionalism in World War II. In his first speech on the House floor, Izac said the path the nation was on would lead to its involvement in the conflict, which elicited substantial coverage from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Among other acts, he introduced legislation calling for the protection of the Palomar Observatory, establishment of a U.S. Marine Corps hospital in San Diego, aid for construction of public schools and to add a battalion of African American soldiers in the then-segregated California Army National Guard. Veterans were a substantial focus of his legislative efforts. He introduced legislation including disabled veterans and their families in New Deal and other appropriations. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1940 and 1944.

Serving on the House Naval Affairs Committee, Izac was considered a potential candidate for greater positions of power. His name came up in 1940 as possible candidate to become the Assistant Secretary for the Navy, but Izac publicly announced at the time that he wanted to remain in Congress, in a role that was focused on support of veterans. He eventually became chair of the House Naval Affairs Committee, and in this role had an oversight role in military efforts to defense matters on the Pacific coast, and was also involved in questioning Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt over the internment of Japanese Americans. This duty sent him on inspection tours of U.S. bases in the Pacific during the war. He also pushed against efforts for a post-war downsizing of U.S. military bases in the Pacific.

It was around this time that Izac&#x27;s popularity began to wane for his liberal positions and opposition to reactionary efforts by Congress. His voting record came under scrutiny by the &quot;San Diego Union&quot;, in part for his opposition to permanent status for the House Un-American Activities Committee and for his protests against the deportation of prominent West Coast union leader Harry Bridges. Izac subsequently won re-election by smaller margins. He had won his 1938 re-election campaign by 20,000 votes in a vote of 58,806 to 38,333, but was re-elected by 4,373 votes in 1940, and 777 votes in 1942 in a close election that came down to the count of absentee ballots. Izac despised Adolf Hitler but nonetheless never advocated for entering the war against him, and his isolationist views were increasingly unpopular in favor of national unity to support the war effort, especially after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1942 following redistricting, Izac shifted to the 23rd congressional district, and Republican Carl Hinshaw replaced him in the 20th congressional district.

In 1945, General Dwight Eisenhower suggested to Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall that legislative representatives be brought to Europe to learn about the concentration camps being found there firsthand. Izac was one of a group of 12 Congressmen and Senators sent to the European Theater of Operations, where they toured Buchenwald, Nordhausen and Dachau concentration camps, learning of the conditions directly from a number of the survivors, an experience that deeply impacted Izac and led to his belief that &quot;terroristic and fanatical&quot; members of the Nazi Party should be &quot;eliminated&quot; rather than reintegrated as part of denazification. He was also a believer in more harsh punishment for the German people in the name of justice, though he knew such sanctions were unlikely. The group penned a report, &quot;Atrocities and other Conditions in Concentration Camps in Germany.

In 1946, he was present at Operation Crossroads, observing nuclear weapons tests on a fleet of 90 Navy vessels at Bikini Atoll. Izac observed the tests aboard the , from the epicenter of the blasts, but said little of his reaction to the weapons.

Izac&#x27;s 1946 re-election campaign pitted him against Republican Charles K. Fletcher, a banker who focused on local issues, differentiating him from Izac, who felt they should be addressed by local bodies, rather than federal government. Fletcher defeated Izac gaining 69,411 votes to Izac&#x27;s 53,898, and was elected to the Eightieth Congress.

=== Later life ===
Later in life, Izac chose to downplay the accomplishments of the Medal of Honor again. After leaving office, he moved his family to land inherited from his father-in-law in Gordonsville, Virginia, where Izac became a farmer and led a simple life raising cattle and growing different kinds of fruit and vegetables. The family then grew most of its own food and survived on pensions from the Navy and Congress. At one point, he dammed a stream to make a small lake, which has since been known as Lake Izac. In retirement the family also took to traveling, visiting Jerusalem almost every year and using these visits as the basis for a 1965 book, &quot;The Holy Land: Then and Now.&quot; Of the book, he later said, &quot;No one who has not visited the most momentous events in the history of the human race will ever be able to visualize just how it all happened. You simply have to go there.&quot;

In 1952, one of Izac&#x27;s sons, 19-year-old Forrest, died in what the coroner ruled a suicide. His youngest son, Andre, eventually joined the Navy as a chaplain and served aboard the . He later lived in Bethesda, Maryland, in the 1960s. An accident following the death of his wife in 1970 led him to live with his second daughter, Anna for the remainder of his life, in Fairfax, Virginia. By 1989 he was the oldest living Medal of Honor recipient and his 99th birthday was noted by Willard Scott on &quot;Today&quot;.

== Death and burial ==
Izac died in his sleep of congestive heart failure on January 18, 1990. At the time of his death, he was the last living Medal of Honor recipient from World War I. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia. Edouard Izac was survived by five children, nineteen grandchildren and twenty-five great-grandchildren.

==Medal of Honor citation==
Rank and organization: Lieutenant, U.S. Navy. Place and date: Aboard German submarine U-90 as prisoner of war, May 21, 1918. Entered service at: Illinois. Born: December 18, 1891, Cresco, Howard County, Iowa.

Citation:

When the U.S.S. President Lincoln was attacked and sunk by the German submarine U-90, on May 21, 1918, Lt. Izac was captured and held as a prisoner on board the U-90 until the return of the submarine to Germany, when he was confined in the prison camp. During his stay on the U-90 he obtained information of the movements of German submarines which was so important that he was determined to escape, with a view to making this information available to the U.S. and Allied Naval authorities. In attempting to carry out this plan, he jumped through the window of a rapidly moving train at the imminent risk of death, not only from the nature of the act itself but from the fire of the armed German soldiers who were guarding him. Having been recaptured and reconfined, Lt. Izac made a second and successful attempt to escape, breaking his way through barbed-wire fences and deliberately drawing the fire of the armed guards in the hope of permitting others to escape during the confusion. He made his way through the mountains of southwestern Germany, having only raw vegetables for food, and at the end, swam the River Rhine during the night in the immediate vicinity of German sentries.

<text>Petronilla Melusina von der Schulenburg, Countess of Walsingham, Countess of Chesterfield (1 April 1693 – 16 September 1778) was the natural daughter of King George I of Great Britain and his longtime mistress, Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal.

== Biography ==
In 1722, Melusina was created Baroness Aldborough and Countess of Walsingham as a life peer. After the death of her father in 1727, she lived mainly with her mother at Kendal House in Isleworth.

In Isleworth, Middlesex, on 5 September 1733 Melusina married Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, a leading Whig politician. The couple had no children, but it is said that &quot;family letters&quot; suggest that Melusina may have been the mother, through an intimacy with Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, of Benedict Swingate Calvert. Calvert was born in England in around 1730–32, the illegitimate son of the 5th Baron Baltimore, while his mother&#x27;s identity is otherwise unknown.

<text>Ciro Alegría Bazán (November 4, 1909 – February 17, 1967) was a Peruvian journalist, politician, and novelist.

==Biography==
Born in Huamachuco District, he exposed the problems of the Native Peruvians while learning about their way of life. This understanding of how they were oppressed was the focus for his novels. He attended classes at the University of Trujillo, and worked briefly as a journalist for the newspaper &quot;El Norte&quot;.

In 1930, Alegría joined the Aprista movement, dedicated to social reform as well as improving the welfare of Native Peruvians. He was imprisoned several times for his political activities before finally being exiled to Chile in 1934.

He remained in exile in both Chile and later the United States up until 1948. Later, he taught at the University of Puerto Rico, and wrote about the Cuban revolution while in Cuba. His most well known novel, &quot;Broad and Alien is the World&quot; (1941) or &quot;El mundo es ancho y ajeno&quot;, won the Latin American Novel Prize in 1941, and brought him international attention. It depicts an Andean community, living in the Peruvian highlands. The book was later published in the United States and has been reprinted many times, in multiple languages. He lived in Puerto Rico, USA and Cuba.

Alegría returned to Peru in 1960. He joined President Fernando Belaúnde Terry&#x27;s party (Acción Popular) and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1963. He died unexpectedly in Lima, Peru on February 17, 1967. After his death, his widow Dora Varona published many of his essays and reports he had written for various newspapers. He was 57 years old.

==Works==
Ciro Alegria published, among others, the following works:
*&quot;La serpiente de oro&quot; (&quot;The golden snake&quot;)
*&quot;Los perros hambrientos&quot; (&quot;The hungry dogs&quot;)
*&quot;El mundo es ancho y ajeno&quot; (&quot;Broad and Alien is the World&quot;, Merlin Press, United Kingdom).
