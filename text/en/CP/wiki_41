<text>The Liberal Movement (LM) was a South Australian political party which existed from 1973 to 1976, and was a forerunner to the Australian Democrats.

The LM was initially organised in 1972 by former premier Steele Hall, as a progressive liberal group in the Liberal and Country League (LCL), in response to a perceived resistance to reform within the LCL. When tensions heightened between the LCL&#x27;s conservative wing and the LM after the March 1973 state election, some of the members split from the LCL, forming a new party on 2 April 1973.

While still part of the LCL, the LM had eleven state parliamentarians. On its own, it was reduced to three parliamentarians − Hall and Robin Millhouse in the lower house and Martin Cameron in the upper house. At the 1974 federal election Hall won a Senate seat and David Boundy retained his South Australia seat for the LM. At the 1975 state election, Millhouse and Boundy retained their seats, while John Carnie won a second seat and Cameron retained his seat in the upper house, bringing the party to a peak of five parliamentarians. 

However, the LCL and LM parties narrowly failed to dislodge the incumbent Dunstan Labor government at the 1975 state election. That result, together with internal weaknesses, led in 1976 to the LM&#x27;s being re-absorbed into the LCL, which by then had become the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia. The Liberal Party also lost the 1977 state election, but succeeded in winning government at the 1979 state election.

A segment of the LM, led by former state attorney-general Robin Millhouse, did not rejoin the Liberals, but instead formed a new party—the New LM. This party, combined with the Australia Party—under the invited leadership of Don Chipp—formed the nucleus of the Australian Democrats which aspired to a balance of power in the federal Senate and up to four state upper houses for three decades. The LM and its successor parties gave voice to what is termed &quot;small-l liberalism&quot; in Australia.

==Party system==
Before parties became established in the Australian colonies in the later 19th century, all members of the colonial parliaments were independents, occasionally labelled as &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot;, amongst other terms. With the advent of Labor, these groups combined to form anti-Labor parties. &quot;Liberal&quot;, in the Australian context, refers to what could be described as classical liberalism, and is distant from the modern meaning that the word has acquired in the United States and some other countries. Liberalism in Australia represents the centre-right of the political spectrum, while Labor represents the centre-left.

The first Labor party in South Australia was the United Labor Party in 1891, born out of a trade union association that recommended and supported trade unionist candidates. In response, the National Defence League (NDL) was born two years later. In 1909, the NDL combined with the Liberal and Democratic Union and the Farmers and Producers Political Union to form the Liberal Union, later known as the Liberal Federation. The ULP transformed into the Labor Party in 1910, and has been known by this name ever since. A separate Country Party subsequently emerged, representing rural interests, but this was assimilated back into the conservative side of politics with the formation of the Liberal and Country League (LCL) in 1932. The South Australian party system has not deviated from this two-party divide, and all other parties gained negligible representation or influence, until the emergence of smaller parties such as the Australian Democrats in the late 20th century, and the Greens and Family First Party in the 21st century.

==Liberal representation==
Political scientists Neal Blewett and Dean Jaensch characterised the LCL as a strange amalgamation of differing groups: &quot;the Adelaide &#x27;establishment&#x27;, the yeoman proprietary (farmers and regional workers), and the Adelaide middle class&quot;. Of these groups, the middle class was the most electorally depressed, both in parliament and within the party itself, owing to a 2:1 ratio favouring regional areas both in electoral legislation and the party organisation. The establishment influenced the party with its financial backing, while the yeoman proprietary was the most numerous. Only in 1956 did the urban middle class achieve parliamentary representation through Robin Millhouse, who was elected to the urban middle class seat of Mitcham.

Millhouse was a vocal advocate of his broader constituency, championing their case in a party dominated by rural conservatives. He wrote a paper on the &#x27;Liberal Case for Electoral Reform&#x27;, arguing for a fairer electoral system, as it was biased against voters resident in the capital city, Adelaide, whether they be progressive or conservative, Liberal or Labor. Many younger urban middle class voters, who would have normally been attracted to the LCL, were abandoning the party for Labor owing to their dissatisfaction with the malapportioned electoral system known as the &#x27;Playmander&#x27;. But this concerned the rural conservatives little, who hoped to retain their hold on power through the present system, which included a Legislative Council where suffrage was based on land ownership, resulting in a body dominated by the ruling class and the rural landholders, and a 16–4 LCL majority. Millhouse&#x27;s paper was quickly ignored.

The LCL had governed, primarily under the stead of Sir Thomas Playford, for 32 years, and finally lost to Labor in 1965. A year and a half later, when Playford retired, Steele Hall was elected to replace him. A young farmer from a rural constituency, Hall had never conflicted with the party line, and was expected to uphold the existing LCL principles, having spoken out in support of the Playmander and the restrictive Legislative Council before. However, when the LCL was returned to office in 1968 under his leadership, with the help of malapportionment, Hall was under pressure. Labor had led the LCL 52.0 to 43.8% on primary votes, but owing to the Playmander, both ended with 19 seats and an independent supported the LCL and returned them to power. Large protests against the Playmander broke out, and there were strong calls for reform.

The LCL had routinely ignored such protests before, but Hall&#x27;s course differed from what was expected. He appointed Millhouse his Attorney-General, and continued a raft of social reform that had begun under the previous Labor government. This was opposed by some conservatives within the party; lines began to be drawn, and factions began to appear. Hall commented in the party&#x27;s newsletter that &quot;too many people see the LCL as a party tied to conservative traditions. We must show voters that we can move with the times, that we are &#x27;with it&#x27;.&quot;

==Electoral reform==
The level of malapportionment had grown to a level in excess of 3:1 in favour of rural areas, and Hall, having won the 1968 state election on 46 per cent of the two-party-preferred vote, committed himself to a fairer electoral system. Previously 39 members were elected: 13 from metropolitan Adelaide and 26 from the country. Hall&#x27;s first attempt for reform was a system with 45 seats and 20 from the country; this proposal received scorn from both Labor and the rural councillors, and was seen as not going far enough by the former and going too far by the latter. A second proposal, for 47 seats with 19 in the country, was adopted with bipartisan support in the House of Assembly, but encountered opposition in the Legislative Council. The new system would make an LCL win near-impossible at the coming 1970 state election, and Hall and the LCL were aware of it. For his weakening of rural constituencies, Hall became an enemy to those councillors who stood in defence of the previous system. Hall saw the political situation as untenable and felt the LCL needed reform to cope with the removal of an artificial situation.

Labor&#x27;s leader, Don Dunstan, also introduced a bill for reform of the Legislative Council, which sought to remove its wage and property based qualifications and instil adult suffrage. Hall himself stated he would approve the bill if it included a clause guaranteeing that the Legislative Council could only be abolished through a referendum. Dunstan agreed, but Hall&#x27;s own party split on the issue. The bill passed the House of Assembly with Labor support, but failed in the Legislative Council where the LCL&#x27;s rural conservatives dominated its restricted electoral base.

Behind the votes in parliament was a personal antagonism between Hall and Ren DeGaris, the leader of the LCL in the Legislative Council. DeGaris, who was elected to the council in 1962, was a staunch defender of its franchise and electoral boundaries. The two were the &quot;de facto&quot; leaders of the party&#x27;s two factions; Hall represented the urban-based progressives, and DeGaris the rural-based conservatives. The conflict between the two extended beyond politics and on to a personal level, contributing to the polarisation of views within the LCL and making it difficult for an internal compromise to be reached on the issue of electoral reform.

After the LCL lost government in 1970, primarily owing to the electoral reform, Hall managed to be re-elected as leader. He convinced a majority of the party&#x27;s membership that reform was needed, and sought to remove the influence that the party&#x27;s representatives in the Legislative Council held. When the Dunstan government again introduced a bill to introduce universal suffrage to the council, Hall gained the support of 7 out of 20 members in the Assembly, but only 2 of 16 LCL members in the Legislative Council supported the bill. Internally, there was much opposition to any electoral reform when the matter was debated at party conferences.

The conservatives then moved against Hall, putting forward party proposals to lessen the influence of its parliamentary leader. Liberal parties in Australia had long held to a tradition of the separation of houses, independence of members, and the ability of the parliamentary leader to choose his own cabinet. The rural councillors sought to preserve their power, and demanded that cabinet positions not be decided by the leader, but elected by the parliamentary party as a whole. As this would include the Legislative Council, dominated by its rural membership, Hall&#x27;s support among moderate Liberals would be overwhelmed by the councillors&#x27; inclusion. Hall privately told Legislative Council Chairman David Brookman that he could not work with DeGaris and that he would resign if he was not allowed to choose his cabinet.

After the parliamentary party agreed on this issue 12–8, Hall resigned the leadership on 16 March 1972, stating that &quot;I cannot continue to lead a Party that will not follow; I cannot lead a Party which has lost its idealism and which has forgotten that its purpose for existence is to govern successfully for the welfare of all South Australians. Our Party is still deeply cleft by the persuasive influence of a number of its members in the Legislative Council.&quot; Later in the speech, he said &quot;Over the last three years I have been subject to a great deal of disloyalty on a continuing basis ... I had hoped this afternoon to move a motion of no confidence in the Government; instead, I found out Party had moved a vote of no confidence in itself.&quot; Premier Dunstan, with whom Hall had never had amiable relations, crossed the floor of the house and shook Hall&#x27;s hand in a gesture of solidarity. Hall said he &quot;was knifed&quot; and said the conservatives&#x27; actions were &quot;a clear example of how deeply the wooden horses of the Legislative Council have entrenched themselves in the ranks of the Assembly membership&quot;. The LCL President Ian McLachlan put on a brave face, saying &quot;Mr Hall had some personal problems with the party, but these differences do not make a divided party&quot; but he was quoted the next day as saying that the proposal was mooted to gauge Hall&#x27;s power. The obscure and low-key conservative Bruce Eastick was installed as the new leader, as some more prominent figures such as Millhouse were seen as too sympathetic to Hall. In the meantime, there was a strong reaction to Hall&#x27;s departure among the public, and segments of the LCL, notably the youth wings, demonstrated against the events and made motions of objection. Hall had expected to become a normal backbencher, but the groundswell of support prompted a change of heart.

==Formation==
Hall initially sought to appeal to the State Council of the LCL. Although the body had no binding authority over the parliamentary caucus, which chose the leader, Hall and his followers saw it as an opportunity for a media victory. The motion went narrowly against Hall, but it generated much attention and potential embarrassment for the conservatives.

After this, he thought of establishing his own separate party, citing small opinion polls that supported this action, but Ian Wilson, the former member for the federal Division of Sturt, convinced him to stay within the LCL and bring about internal change. Strong support emerged from within the party for Hall&#x27;s stand, particularly from its youth wing, the Young Liberals. On 21 March 1972, a faction, but closer to a &quot;party within a party&quot; was formed: the New Liberals. On 28 March it was renamed the Liberal Movement. The conservatives strongly criticised Hall and his new movement, accusing them of undermining Eastick, disrupting the party and being disloyal.

It quickly gained support within the LCL&#x27;s membership, capturing a number of party branches and began preselecting its own members. Robin Millhouse was a member of the faction, and served as the deputy leader of both the LCL and the LM. Thanks to the electoral reform that had occurred, with more urban electoral districts to contest, the urban-based LM greatly increased its parliamentary representation, with seven members in the House of Assembly (including Hall, Millhouse and future Premiers David Tonkin and Dean Brown), three in the Legislative Council, and one in the Australian House of Representatives (Ian Wilson). Soon there were factional clashes during parliamentary debate, and combative television debates. One LCL branch president publicly called Hall a &quot;traitor&quot;. The LM managed to worry the conservatives by managing to seize control of some rural branches within electorates held by strongly anti-LM representatives, including that of DeGaris. The conservatives tried to remove Hall&#x27;s endorsement for his seat, but failed. Several bitterly fought pre-selection battles followed. As a former premier, Hall was much more proficient than Eastick at dealing with the press, and used his skills to generate more media publicity, prompting Eastick to claim bias.

The LM sought to seize control of the LCL agenda by winning key positions on the state executive at the annual general meeting in September, but this was difficult as the malapportionment towards rural groups was entrenched at party level, and because the conservatives had anticipated the LM&#x27;s plans. The LM President Alex Perryman challenged McLachlan for the party presidency and in a high-profile contest received 47% of the vote in a narrow defeat. He received around 90% among urban delegates and around 33% of the rural votes, the latter figure shocking the conservatives. The LM later generated more publicity by inquiring about alleged impropriety in the balloting process.

The LM&#x27;s policies were generally progressive, and Hall himself stated that &quot;we had no major differences with the written philosophies of the LCL&quot;. The LM&#x27;s colour, purple, was described by observers as &quot;LCL blue with a dash of Labor red&quot;, signifying the faction&#x27;s location on the political spectrum. The LM was less concerned with creating differing policy as it was taking over and reforming the LCL; however, on the electoral reform front, the LM started by calling for the Legislative Council to be devoid of ministers. Worried by the LM, conservatives in the LCL tried to change the party rules to prevent members from criticising the organisation in public, and enforce discipline. This backfired as the LM exploited it to portray the conservatives as repressive, and the media also viewed it negatively, and the move was put on hold. The non-Labor forces, in their disunity, were in a poor position to challenge the dominance of charismatic Premier Dunstan. The LM itself contained two poorly defined internal groups: moderates, concerned with the inequalities of the electoral systems and the LCL&#x27;s ageing image; and radicals, who espoused the aforementioned in addition to the desire for wide-ranging social reform. Some of the latter felt Hall was the most progressive option available, but not progressive enough. Nevertheless, the LM had generated a large amount of campaign funds and had great name recognition; Hall was also favoured in opinions as a better leader than Eastick by a threefold factor. They cited such figures to portray themselves as the main threat to Labor and justify why they were the direction the LCL needed to take. Late in the year the LM received another boost when Wilson regained the seat of Sturt for the Liberal Party at the 1972 federal election, making much of his LM membership.

In the 1973 state election, the LM largely ran a separate campaign from the LCL as a whole. The majority of the LCL&#x27;s metropolitan candidates were also within the LM, and it was hoped that enough seats would be gained so that not only would the LCL return to power, but that the LM would be able to overpower the conservative faction in the House of Assembly and re-elect Hall as leader. To do this, they needed to capture at least three marginal Labor seats in Adelaide. This also meant the conservatives in the LCL would be better off losing to Labor if they wanted to maintain their hold on the party, as Labor&#x27;s vulnerable seats were in all in the city, and a Labor loss meant a LM gain. The LCL campaign chairperson explicitly said that she would prefer losing if it meant keeping control of the party. While the LM ran an innovative campaign, the LCL itself faltered, losing support in the country to a separate Country Party and to Labor in metropolitan Adelaide. One LM seat held by a rural member was lost to the Country Party. The LM were branded by the LCL conservatives as being the reason behind the LCL&#x27;s defeat. The LM saw itself as a more modern and appropriate alternative to the LCL, more in tune with urban mainstream, but there was no evidence that urban LM candidates were more popular than conservative LCL candidates in Adelaide. LM members made up the majority of urban LCL candidates, but were unable to wrest any Labor seats in Adelaide.

Labor&#x27;s convincing win was not unexpected, particularly as infighting in the LCL had been ongoing for over a year. Friction was present throughout the campaign as well as before it, particularly as much of the donations were given directly to the LM. In the months before the election LCL members had thrown punches in the corridors of Parliament House. Internal battles between conservatives and LM members for party pre-selection were keenly contested. Around half of the LCL candidates were LM supporters and avoided mention of the LCL and its conservative leader Bruce Eastick in their pamphlets. Some of the LM faction candidates instead trumpeted Hall as their leader and printed books detailing their policies. There was also an incident where a LM function celebrating Wilson&#x27;s win in the 1972 federal election clashed with Eastick&#x27;s main policy speech. Eastick and his conservatives arrived at Wilson&#x27;s dinner after they finished campaigning for the night, but then walked out when Wilson was delivering a speech calling for the LCL to be more tolerant of the diverse opinions within the party. Labor ran a sedate campaign, but made much of the internal LCL divisions.

==Split==
Despite the LCL&#x27;s defeat, the failure of the LM to gain internal supremacy over the conservatives was seen by the latter as a vindication of their policies. Pressure from the LCL&#x27;s leader, Bruce Eastick, who called on the LM to disband, and the conservative wing of the party, saw machinations against the LM. Hall reiterated the LM&#x27;s intention to continue, but Millhouse was removed as the LCL deputy leader in 1973, and pressure began to be mounted on the faction, which did not have any members on the frontbench; Hall did not pursue a position in the shadow ministry. Tension continued as rumours spread claiming that the LCL State Council was contemplating the forbidding and vetoing of LM members from representing the party in elections. While Hall and Martin Cameron responded by publicly vowing to stand firm, several of their LM colleagues were ambivalent when asked about the intentions if the LM were no longer tolerated within the LCL. However, Heini Becker left the LM.

On 23 March, a motion was passed at the state council that allowed it to deny membership to those who belonged to &quot;outside political organisations&quot;, and the LM was subsequently declared to be one. Strangely, an LCL member could also be a member of the Communist Party of Australia, but not the LM. A motion by LM members to also declare the League of Rights an outside political organisation failed. The LCL conservatives were confident the LM would capitulate and reintegrate, as third parties had never been successful in South Australia. At first, LM members tried to have their banning from the LCL deemed illegal, but this failed.

It was not expected that the LM would split to form a separate party. But before it was established, Hall promptly resigned from the LCL, declaring it &quot;hypocritical and decadent&quot;. Martin Cameron quickly followed, and Robin Millhouse consulted with members from his constituency before agreeing to resign from the LCL. Ian Wilson, who had earlier managed to convince Hall not to form a separate party, tried in vain to sway him to remain with the LCL and focus on reforming it from within. He wanted to shut down the LM in an attempt to limit the damage to the party, believing that &quot;political groups come and go, but the ideals we aim for will never change&quot;. All other LCL-LM members did not follow; three lower house members including Tonkin and Brown, Wilson in the federal parliament, and two MLCs all stayed in the LCL. David Tonkin stated that &quot;every one of those Liberals who resign from the League is making it more and more certain that the League will remain just as it is&quot;.
A number of LCL branches remained with the LM, and there were mass resignations from the LCL on the whole. Eastick was relatively unconcerned: the LCL had a massive membership of over 30,000 and the LM&#x27;s split did little to dent it—Eastick admitted 200 individual resignations. In the meantime, the LCL tried to introduce a requirement for members to make &quot;pledge&quot; that they were not aligned with &quot;an outside political body&quot;. This prompted a second wave of resignations, notably from sections of the Young Liberal Movement. Despite its leader&#x27;s show of confidence, many in the LCL were concerned that the expulsion of LM elements had apparently backfired; it also prompted some disillusioned parliamentarians to suggest that rural and urban elements in the LCL could not coexist.

The new party was formally announced on 2 April after an LM convention. As the LM had already begun establishing an infrastructure while in the LCL, it was able to pick up momentum readily, presenting itself as a centrist moderate party, but it was never able to shed its reliance on Hall.

As Hall and Millhouse were both competent parliamentary performers, it was widely acknowledged in the media that they outperformed the LCL in providing an effective opposition. In one parliamentary division, with the entirety of the ALP and LCL on one side of the house and the LM members on the other, Millhouse took one of many opportunities to taunt Eastick and damage the LCL, labelling him &quot;Dunstan lover!&quot; The South Australian media, which had earlier warmed to Premier Dunstan, then focused their attention on the LM and gave the fledgling party much-needed publicity.

The primary instigator for the creation of the LM in 1972 had been based around the lack of electoral reform. The electoral system had been expected to continue to return rural LCL members in the Legislative Council, yet at the 1973 state election Labor had, through the mass registration of new voters for the council vote, managed to gain two seats, giving a council of 14 LCL, 6 Labor. As half the council was elected at each election, Labor only had to retain their vote to gain an additional two seats at the 1975 state election, and a minor rise in it would see additional council seats fall to them. It was increasingly plausible that Labor would be able to gain a majority in the Legislative Council within a decade and then carry through their goal of abolishing it, and push through any electoral legislation it so wished.

To the LCL, this was a dangerous situation, and seeing a need to avoid it, they compromised: their position abruptly changed to being in favour of wholesale reform of the Legislative Council. When Dunstan put forward bills to reform it, the LCL relented, and Eastick convinced the LCL councillors to let them pass, conditional on amendments to the legislation. These were a minor change to the particular proportional system used to elect the councillors, and that it remained non compulsory to vote in the council. The new council would eventually have 22 members, with half elected each election from a multi-member constituency covering the entirety of the state. Hall attacked the LCL for its sudden change in stance on reform, and managed to see the first LM policy become law with the lowering of the council suffrage age to 18.

The reform legislation for the Legislative Council was not to take effect until the next election, and the death of LCL MLC Henry Kemp necessitated a by-election for the council district of Southern on 11 August 1973. Southern was an ultra-safe rural LCL seat, and Labor declined to stand in the by-election. It was contested by the LCL, the LM, a separate Country Party and the Australia Party. The three non-LCL parties agreed on favourable preference deals in the hope of one of them displacing the LCL. The LM gained 29 per cent of the vote, and the LCL candidate, John Burdett, won by a 4 per cent margin once preferences had been distributed.

At the start of 1974, the LCL had undertaken some progressive reforms. They brought in a less conservative membership at the grassroots level, although the old guard was still prominent in parliamentary roles. They tried to broach the possibility of reintegrating the LM. Wilson and the new executive director of the LCL, John Vial were at the forefront, but the LM was optimistic about its future and refused unless the LCL changed leaders and allowed for explicitly separate urban and rural factions, which did not happen.

==Elections and support==
===Federal election 1974===
In order to give the LM national exposure, Hall decided to stand for the Australian Senate at the 1974 federal election. Another objective was to allow Millhouse and Cameron to become more prominent at state level and dispel the established perception of the LM as a Hall party. The move was a risk as failure would have left the LM&#x27;s main drawcard out of the spotlight entirely until a state election which was not due for another two years, but Hall said the party had no future unless it could gain national stature. Another possible problem was that the media could have lost interest in the LM at a state level regardless of whether Hall won a senate position. However it was a rare opportunity, because the election followed a double dissolution (the first since 1951), meaning that all Senate seats were up for election, and thus a candidate needed only 9.1% of the vote (after preferences) to win a seat, compared to 16.7% for an ordinary half senate election.

The battle between the LCL and the LM was not seen as a large part of the national campaign, as South Australia was only a small part of the nation and most of the marginal seats that would determine the outcome were in other states. The LM gained 9.9 per cent of the vote in the Senate and Hall was elected in his own right, without the assistance of preferences. In the House of Representatives, the LM gained 8.4 per cent of the vote across the 12 South Australian seats, ranging from a high of 18 per cent in metropolitan Boothby to 1.6 per cent in rural Angas. Fortunately for Hall and the LM, the senate election resulted in Labor and the Liberal-Country Party coalition holding 29 seats each, and Hall was one of two crossbenchers who held the balance of power. The media made much of Hall&#x27;s position as a powerbroker at federal level, and the Liberals responded to him in a hostile manner; for his part, Hall continued to persistently attack them as outmoded and lambasted them over the matter of electoral reform.

Hall had abandoned his rural Yorke Peninsula-based seat of Goyder to stand for the Senate, and at the 1974 Goyder state by-election the LM were concerned about how their vote would stand without the assistance of its prominent incumbent and in an area outside their urban base; the LCL had always won the seat easily. The campaign was robust, with strong accusations being traded as what was previously a safe seat became evenly poised and the subject of frantic electioneering. Surprisingly, as the LM was an urban movement, they polled 46 per cent of the vote, which was enough for David Boundy to comfortably win the seat for the LM, with the help of Country Party preferences; in fact the LM two-party preferred vote was 62.6%. Despite most of its preferences flowing to the LM, the Country Party attacked the LM for perceived hypocrisy as they had run in a rural seat despite calling for the anti-Labor forces to be separated into urban and rural divisions. This continued to be a source of tension, as the LM continued to campaign in rural seats, prompting the Country Party to threaten to deny them preferences. The LM triumph embarrassed the LCL, and Eastick survived a leadership challenge from Heini Becker in the aftermath. Over the next year, the LM focused on building the party machinery.

===State election 1975===
At the 1975 state election the LM had ambitions of becoming the largest non-Labor party. The campaign was focused primarily on accusations of mismanagement of the economy by Labor, with the LM seeking to positioning itself between the Liberals and Labor, as the centre-ground of South Australian politics. Advertisements attacked the Liberal Party for being a conservative party, and Labor for its perceived socialism and poor economic record. At the time, inflation and unemployment was increasing. The LM slogan was &quot;Vote LM—You know it&#x27;s right&quot;. Despite now being a federal senator, Hall was still synonymous with the LM at state level and he was central in the party&#x27;s advertising. The momentum was against Labor, and it was expected that the election could come down to whether Labor would retain their marginal urban seats. The LM proposed to the Liberals to have a joint candidate in the marginal metropolitan seat of Gilles—which required a two-party preferred swing of 6%—to maximise their chances. The Liberals agreed but wanted the joint candidate to stand in Unley, and no agreement was reached.

Millhouse, now the State Parliamentary Leader of the LM, announced the LM&#x27;s policy for the 1975 state election at the Adelaide Town Hall on 2 July. He outlined the LM&#x27;s plans for economic rejuvenation: an end to compulsory unionism, budget and tax cuts, and measures to curb rising inflation and cost of living. Social policy included proposals for an early form of multiculturalism and promotion of &#x27;cultural diversity&#x27; and bilingualism. Energy policy appealed to a new generation of environmentalists, and promoted conservation and promotion of solar power. He slammed the proposed City of Monarto as a &#x27;monument to socialist folly&#x27;.

In the lower house, the LM retained both of their seats (Millhouse and Boundy), but won no new seats. Contesting 45 of the 47 seats, the LM commanded almost a fifth (18.2 per cent) of the vote in the lower house and the combined non-Labor forces gained 50.8 per cent of the two-party-preferred total. The LM was more effective in the city, recording 20.2% of the urban vote and 13.4% in rural areas. The party made several formerly safe Liberal seats marginal (including that of its leader, Eastick where they captured 20.3% in the rural district of Light). The LM withstood a concerted push by the Liberals to oust Millhouse from Mitcham, and retained Goyder. They were also strong in those seats held by LM members who did not break away during the split but stayed with the LCL. However, preferences did not flow as the non-Labor parties had wished, with up to 20 per cent of LM second-preferences flowing to Labor instead of the Liberals or Country Party.

In the upper house, the LM won two seats. They thus gained one seat, with Cameron joined by John Carnie. With the new proportional system in the Legislative Council after the electoral reforms, the LM captured 18.8% of the vote to end with 2 of the 11 seats available. This was enough to allow Labor and the LM to join and sidestep conservative Liberal opposition in the upper house.

The Liberals, having suffered a 12 per cent reduction in their metropolitan primary vote, and gained their lowest result, quickly dumped Eastick, who was an unimpressive parliamentary performer and seen as an obstacle to reintegration with the LM, as leader. Tonkin became the new leader, the first Liberal leader from a metropolitan seat. The federal Liberal Party was rattled by the strength of the LM, and tried to reintegrate them. Hall was offered a high position in the Liberal senate ticket if he rejoined, and a position in cabinet if the Liberals defeated the federal Labor government. The LM regarded its first state electoral performance as impressive, and optimistic with their future, they flatly rejected the overtures. However, they had also gone into debt to fund their election campaign. Millhouse also found it harder to dominate the Liberals and seize the momentum in parliamentary debate when proceedings resumed; he found Tonkin a much more formidable opponent than Eastick.

===Federal election 1975===
The second consecutive double dissolution 1975 federal election in December was held owing to the dismissal of the Whitlam Government by Governor General John Kerr, and the subsequent appointment of federal Liberal leader Malcolm Fraser as caretaker Prime Minister. Prior to the dismissal, the Liberal Party had used its majority in the Australian Senate to block supply bills. Hall voted in favour of the supply bills being passed, and objected to the federal Liberals&#x27; actions. Hall had been praised for his stance on supply, but the Liberals attacked him, accusing him of being &quot;Labor in a purple disguise&quot; and saying that Fraser needed a compliant senate &quot;not hampered by independents sitting on the fence&quot;. Hall countered by saying he was preferencing the Liberals and therefore not Labor-aligned, and that he was a &quot;dedicated anti-socialist&quot;.

Hall saw the double dissolution as an opportunity to capture senate seats in all the states across the nation, and the LM sought to create bases outside South Australia. On 18 November, a LM rally was held at Melbourne Town Hall to launch a branch in Victoria. A branch was formed in Queensland and Hall travelled to Western Australia to oversee the formation of a state branch. Generally, the LM&#x27;s attempts to spread its message failed owing to the dramatic and highly polarising effects of Whitlam&#x27;s dismissal and the constitutional crisis, which produced angry demonstrations around the country. Amid the tumult, the media was almost completely focused on the two main parties, giving other groups almost no opportunities to capture the public imagination. The LM also found it difficult to establish a connection with the populace outside South Australia owing to its formation within a state-specific backdrop.

Attempts were made to expand the appeal of the LM through secret merger talks with the Australia Party, who initiated the idea, but these collapsed. The campaign was also hampered by the departure of two LM candidates who relabelled themselves as the Independent Liberal Movement. The first to leave the LM, C. W. Henderson, was a member of the LM Management Committee who criticised Hall&#x27;s attempts to spread the party nationally. He accused Hall of having &quot;delusions of grandeur&quot;, leading to his membership being suspended two days later. The next day, J. Henderson, the sixth member of the senate ticket, quit, saying he did not &quot;want to be a puppet on a party string&quot;. Groves and Henderson aggressively campaigned against the LM, although they were to receive only 0.09% of the senate vote themselves.

When the election was held, there was a 12 percent swing towards the Liberal Party in South Australia, or 7 percent on two party preferred. There was a large swing against Labor owing to the dissatisfaction with the Whitlam administration, but it generally went directly to the Liberal Party. Against this background, and with relatively little media attention paid to the LM and its cause, Despite gaining prominence for his stance on supply, Hall struggled to be re-elected, gaining only 6.5 per cent of the Senate vote and relying on preferences, ironically from Labor. In South Australia, Labor gained 41 per cent of the vote, and the Liberals 51 per cent. In the lower house, the LM managed only 6.2% across the 12 seats, again recording its best result in Boothby, with 10.4%. Hall&#x27;s hope for Australia-wide support for the LM was dashed owing to the previous events, with the party gaining negligible results for their candidates in other states. The lower house candidates in the Australian Capital Territory registered around 3%, but the senate candidates in Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland received less than 1%. Hall&#x27;s opinion was that &quot;the Liberal Movement was for its part in the contest happy to have survived.&quot; Nevertheless, Hall was still adamant the LM&#x27;s future was as a standalone entity: &quot;The LM is going to continue as an Australia-wide party ... We shall have to go through the sickening process of having the Liberal party make overtures to us once again ... I would like to tell them right now that they will be wasting their breath.&quot; Despite Hall&#x27;s defiance, the poor showing meant his senate term was only to last for three rather than six years, and he no longer had the balance of power and the resulting media exposure. This was a problem, as the party was largely centred around his personality.

==Decline==
Independent of the LM, the LCL had begun to change. It eventually supported Don Dunstan&#x27;s bills for electoral reform, both to the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council, and its internal structure was reorganised and modernised, particular with the arrival of Tonkin, its first urban leader. The LCL renamed itself the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia to bring itself into line with its federal counterpart. Thus, many of the reasons for the LM&#x27;s split had become null. Combined with the LM&#x27;s declining membership (one third of members had not renewed) and its large debt, it found itself in a precarious position. Negotiations in 1976 began with the aim for the LM to merge into the new Liberal Party, and news of the secret talks were leaked in April. Once the news became public, Millhouse stated his complete opposition: &quot;I will not rejoin the Liberal Party ... I have meant what I said in the past and I do not see any change in the attitude of the Liberal Party to alter my view.&quot; He said doing so would entail a surrender of honour and self-respect, and described the LM as the only &quot;genuine Liberal party&quot; in the nation, boldly predicting that its agenda would become dominant in society. Millhouse&#x27;s stand was widely condemned by the media, who saw it as based on pride rather than pragmatism, and unhelpful for anti-Labor politics. Hall, however, wanted to unite the non-Labor forces, and acknowledged that &quot;there is no prospect of maintaining LM electorate groups ... in simple terms, our alternatives are to swallow some little pride, and unite to fight Labor.&quot; He said to do otherwise would be to &quot;exist in splendid selfish isolation&quot;, and said they could not survive as a relevant force by holding Goyder and Mitcham and losing upper house seats owing to a dwindling vote. Hall said the LM&#x27;s reform agenda had been fulfilled, their finances were untenable and contended there was no ideological reason remaining for a split. This put him at increasing odds with Millhouse, who continued to describe the Liberals as &quot;very conservative&quot;. Some members of the Liberals were also wary of a merger, owing to the long-standing antipathy between the two groups, and persistent criticism of them from the LM over the years.

In the meantime, the negotiations continued, with Hall prominent. During informal discussions following the 1975 state election, Millhouse had been offered the deputy leadership in a merged party, and Cameron a leading role in the upper house, but following the poor showing at the federal election and the deteriorating financial state of the LM, the offer was reduced and the posts that had been offered to Millhouse and Cameron were no longer available. However, Hall was still able to negotiate for the LM President and Treasurer to be given positions on a new executive. He also agreed to forgo any further senate bids. An agreement was put in place to protect Boundy from being ousted at a pre-selection of the new party, but this was broken at the next election. The LM was also given an equal voting share on pre-selection committees for three urban lower house seats.

Labor was not pleased with the prospect of its opponents being reunited and potentially more effective, and Premier Dunstan mocked the opposition parties as a &quot;circus&quot;, while his deputy Des Corcoran predicted the new entity would not be able to last. The media continued to criticise Millhouse&#x27;s defiance as disruptive.

When the LM voted narrowly in May 1976 to rejoin the Liberals (222 to 211), Millhouse immediately created the New LM, and became its only parliamentary representative. He tried to put an optimistic view on the matter, saying that the close-run vote as an endorsement of his position, and the merger as an opportunity to start with a clean slate with no debt. The merger was finalised on 4 June when the Liberals&#x27; State Council voted heavily in favour.

He was a prominent member of the Assembly, and a constant irritant to the Liberals, with whom he often sparred. When Don Chipp resigned from the federal Liberal Party, and stated his intention to create a centrist and progressive &quot;third force&quot; in Australian politics, Millhouse&#x27;s New LM responded. Chipp&#x27;s Australian Democrats was created, and negotiations began for a merger between the two parties. The New LM candidates at the 1977 state election stood under a joint New LM-Australian Democrats ticket, winning 12.3 per cent of the vote in the 12 electorates they contested, and Millhouse defeated the Liberal candidate in the lower house seat of Mitcham, which he would hold until resigning from parliament in 1982. The merger was finalised on 3 October 1977 and the New LM was absorbed into the Democrats. Meanwhile, the interstate branches of the LM, which had been in existence for only six months, either disbanded in 1976, or eventually evolved and merged into state components of the Democrats. The Western Australian division of the LM was the strongest interstate branch and renamed itself the Centre Line Party before becoming the state branch of the Democrats.

David Tonkin, an LM member before it split and became a separate party, had gained the Liberal party leadership in 1975, succeeding Eastick. He worked swiftly to heal the internal party wounds, and to re-establish the non-Labor forces and provide an effective opposition. The 1977 state election saw a decline in Liberal support, but the party gained power soon after the resignation of Premier Dunstan, with an 11 per cent swing at the 1979 state election, receiving 55 per cent of the two-party-preferred vote, though losing office after one term at the 1982 state election. The first Democrats MLC was also elected in 1979 on a first preference vote of 6.5 per cent. The Democrats continued to attract support, and held the balance of power in the Legislative Council for most of the time from the 1979 state election until after the 1997 state election.

==Parliamentarians==
*Steele Hall
*Robin Millhouse
*Martin Cameron
*John Carnie
*David Boundy

All went back into the fold of the LCL successor, the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia, except for Millhouse who joined the New Liberal Movement (New LM), one of the predecessor parties that would form the Australian Democrats.

<text>is a Japanese broadcaster in Yamagata. Its radio station is affiliated with Japan Radio Network (JRN) and National Radio Network (NRN), and its television station is affiliated with Nippon News Network (NNN) and Nippon Television Network System (NNS).

== History ==
In the early 1950s, commercial broadcasters began to appear throughout Japan. On February 20, 1953, Yamagata Broadcasting held its first founders&#x27; meeting, and Yamagata Shimbun, a local newspaper, had an important role in the establishment of Yamagata Broadcasting, as did most of the first commercial broadcasters in Japan. At that time, the head office of Yamagata Broadcasting was located in Yamagata Shimbun with a capital of 50 million yen.

On March 14 of the same year, Yamagata Broadcasting applied to the Ministry of Post and Post for a broadcasting license, and obtained a preliminary license on August 14 of the same year. However, Yamagata Broadcasting was facing a shortage of funds at that time, so the president of Yamagata Shimbun, Hattori Keio, requested the Yamagata Prefectural Government to fund Yamagata Broadcasting, and finally got the agreement. On September 26, 1953, Yamagata Radio began to transmit experimental radio signals. On October 5 of the same year, Yamagata Broadcasting received a formal broadcast license. The next day, Yamagata Broadcasting Station started trial broadcast.

At 12:00 on October 15, 1953, Yamagata Broadcasting Station officially started broadcasting. On December 24 of the year it was launched, Yamagata Broadcasting Station extended its broadcast time to 6am to 11pm. At the end of the same year, Yamagata Broadcasting increased its capital by 30 million yen. On October 15, 1954, the first anniversary of the broadcast, Yamagata Broadcasting opened the Tsuruoka Broadcasting Bureau (JOEL), covering the Shonai area. On November 10 of the same year, Yamagata Broadcasting and Nippon Broadcasting System signed a program cooperation agreement. According to the results of the first listening rate survey in November 1955, Yamagata Broadcasting&#x27;s listening rate reached 47.9%, surpassing NHK Radio 1 of 45.4%. In the second survey in August of the following year, this number changed to 56.3% vs. 37%, and Yamagata Broadcasting&#x27;s advantage further expanded. In fiscal year 1955, Yamagata Broadcasting achieved profitability for the first time. After six capital increases, Yamagata Broadcasting&#x27;s capital increased to 164 million yen in the autumn of 1957.

Yamagata Broadcasting established the &quot;Yamagata Broadcasting and Television Establishment Preparatory Committee&quot; on January 8, 1957 to prepare for the establishment of a television station. On October 22, 1957, Yamagata Broadcasting obtained a television preliminary broadcast license. At the same time, in order to cope with the increase in equipment and manpower required for the launch of television, Yamagata Broadcasting began to jointly plan to build a new headquarters with Yamagata Shimbun. On July 29, 1959, construction began on the Yamagata Shimbun Broadcasting Hall, a new joint headquarters building for both companies. This building has six floors and has a 53-meter-high TV tower on the roof. It cost 550 million yen. The Yamagata Shimbun Broadcasting Hall was officially completed on October 7, 1960.

In terms of TV network selection, Yamagata Broadcasting Station chose to join the Nippon Television network. On March 16, 1960, Yamagata Broadcasting received an official television broadcast license. On March 21, Yamagata Broadcasting began transmitting experimental television signals. On the 25th of the same month, Yamagata Broadcasting began to pilot the TV program. In March 1960, just before Yamagata Broadcasting Station started broadcasting, there were only 13,467 television sets in Yamagata Prefecture, with a penetration rate of only 5.6%. Therefore, Yamagata Broadcasting actively promoted the popularization of televisions before the launch of television, and carried out activities such as &quot;TV Savings&quot;.

On April 1, 1960, Yamagata Broadcasting Station officially launched. At the beginning of the broadcast, Yamagata Broadcasting broadcast programs from 10:00 to 13:00 and 17:30 to 22:30 every day, with a daily broadcast time of 8 hours. On October 1, 1966, Yamagata Broadcasting began broadcasting color television programs. According to a ratings survey in September 1968, among the 20 TV programs with the highest ratings in Yamagata Prefecture, 19 were from Yamagata Broadcasting and only 1 was from NHK. On June 16, 1975, a groundbreaking ceremony was held for the Yamagata News Broadcasting Hall, and the Yamagata Broadcasting Headquarters was expanded again. On October 1 of the following year, the Yamagata Shimbun Broadcasting Hall was completed. In fiscal year 1978, Yamagata Broadcasting&#x27;s turnover reached 4.53 billion yen and net profit reached 345 million yen.

On April 1, 1980, Yamagata Broadcasting joined the TV Asahi network ANN and became affiliated to two networks simultaneously.

Yamagata Broadcasting started broadcasting stereo TV programs in August 1981 and was the first commercial TV station in Yamagata Prefecture to broadcast stereo programs. In 1982, Yamagata Broadcasting sent reporters to Poland to collect information and successfully reported the exclusive news that the Polish government recognized that it would lift martial law. According to a ratings survey conducted by Video Research in December 1983, Yamagata Broadcasting won the triple crown of ratings in Yamagata Prefecture with 15% for the whole day, 29.3% for the prime time , and 28.7% for the evening period. To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding, Yamagata Broadcasting and Yamagata Shimbun jointly published &quot;Yamagata Prefecture Encyclopedia&quot; in 1981.

In 1993, when Yamagata Television switched to ANN, the secondary affiliation agreement was relinquished and the station became a full-time affiliate of NNN.

<doc id="1330540" wikidata="Q4823742" url="?curid=1330540" title="Australian standard pallet">
<text>Australian standard pallets are square softwood or hardwood pallets that are standard in Australia and non-standard anywhere else in the world.

They are 1165 × 1165 mm in size and fit exactly in the RACE container of the Australian railways. They are ill-suited for the standard and ISO shipping containers used around the globe.

== Construction and specification==
Australian standard pallets are defined by Australian Standard AS:4068-1993 &quot;Flat pallets for materials handling&quot;. They can be manufactured in hardwood or softwood, where hardwood is good for durability, weather tolerance and very heavy loads of over 2 tonne. 1165 × 1165 mm softwood pallets can also be manufactured using lighter timber suitable for use as a lightweight pallet using 19mm boards (up to 1 tonne) or 25mm boards (up to 2 tonne). Australian standard pallets are extensively used in Australian storage and warehousing as racking pallets because they can be removed from transport directly onto warehouse racking for storage.

The majority of Australian business will use a softwood pallet. Pricing ranges from $15.00 AU to $19.00 AU (2019) for a softwood standard size pallet, based on quantities.

== Use ==
The Australian standard pallet is designed for use with the RACE container of Australian railways. Originally the pallet was specified at 46 × 46 inches (from a nominal size of 48 × 48 inches, or 4 ft × 4 ft), but this has been metricated to the marginally smaller 1165 × 1165 mm dimensions. Two pallets will fit closely side by side in a RACE container. They can be stacked on two levels and one container can thus hold 20 pallets. A standard railway wagon carries three containers and can thus hold 60 pallets.

Two-thirds of palletized transport within Australia uses the 1165 × 1165 standard pallet. For external use, where goods are to be shipped in ISO containers, an 1100 × 1100 mm pallet is used. This is a pallet size widely used by Japan and Korea, but is also specified in the Australian standard for pallets.

== History ==
Australia was one of the first countries to develop a standard pallet. During World War II the United States, as part of their logistics effort, used palletized transport on a scale never before seen. This especially impressed the Australians who were still mostly handling goods by manual effort. When the war ended, the Americans left behind their materials handling equipment and a very large stock of pallets in Australia. The Australian government formed the Commonwealth Handling Equipment Pool (CHEP) to exploit these assets, and it was CHEP that introduced the Australian standard pallet. The government sold the assets of CHEP in the 1950s, mostly to port authorities, but the trading name of CHEP was taken by Brambles Limited and is now the largest pallet rental business in the world.

During the 1970s, Australia converted to the metric system. Australia pushed ahead with metrication quickly, and did this with less fuss and opposition than occurred in other countries such as the United States or the United Kingdom. In order to proceed rapidly, a quick decision was needed on pallet sizes before decisions on metrication of packaging could be made. Because of this, it was decided to retain the Australian standard pallet, despite it being peculiar to Australia.

== International standardisation ==
Not using an international standard pallet can increase transport costs of international trade. Export goods may have to be repalletized to suit the requirements of the destination country. In some cases they must be repalletized twice in the distribution chain, once on to a pallet suitable for international containers and again at the destination country if they are also not using a standard pallet. Likewise, import goods will not arrive on an Australian standard pallet and need repalletizing for RACE containers. The intrinsic advantage of palletized transport is that it minimises manual handling operations. These repalletizations detract from that advantage.

A 2002 report commissioned by the Australian Department of Transport and Regional Services examined the possibility of replacing the Australian standard pallet with the ISO standard size of 1200×1000 mm. Two-thirds of Australia&#x27;s trade is with countries that use either this size, or the near equivalent US standard size of 48×40 inches so changing to this standard would be less costly than to other standard pallet sizes. The report concluded that making this change would be worth a net present value of $2.5 billion at a discount rate of 30%, or $5.1 billion at discount rate of 20%.

Despite the analysis in the report, Australia continues to use the Australian standard pallet. The cost of making the change is estimated at $600 million over ten years, which includes not only the change to the pallets themselves, but also to storage racking and other equipment. Operating costs are estimated to increase by $100 million over the same ten years: the smaller pallet means more handling operations for the same amount of goods, and a less efficient usage of truck and warehouse space (larger pallets have a greater ratio of goods to pallet and packaging).

<text>Earlene Fowler (born 1954) is an American novelist and the author of a number of mystery novels set in the fictional Californian city of San Celina. She was raised in La Puente, California.

Earlene has written 15 books in the &quot;Benni Harper&quot; series of mysteries. The sixth book, &quot;Mariner&#x27;s Compass&quot;, won the Agatha Award for Best Novel in 1999. The lead character, Benni Harper, is curator of a folk art museum and quilting figures prominently in many of the storylines. Each book in the series has been given the name of a traditional quilt block pattern. Recurring characters include Police Chief Gabe Ortiz, Benni&#x27;s friend Elvia Aragon, Grandma Dove, Aunt Garnet, and cousin Emory.

San Celina is a fictionalized and slightly modified version of San Luis Obispo, California. The books include many local landmarks and recognizable places from throughout San Luis Obispo County, although many of the names have been altered slightly. The name &quot;San Celina&quot; is improper Spanish (improper gender agreement between the subject and article) and was meant as a joke, but is now a decision the author regrets due to the large number of letters she receives about it.

In November, 2004 &quot;Benni Harper&#x27;s Quilt Album&quot; was published. Co-written with Margrit Hall, this book features quilt patterns inspired by early books in the series. The book includes photographs and new stories to fill in some missing plot details from the book series.

Earlene was a short story writer for more than ten years before her first novel was published. Writing classes at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, California led to the submission of her first book to a publisher. Within a week, a three-book contract was signed.

&quot;The Saddlemaker&#x27;s Wife&quot;, not a part of the &quot;Benni Harper&quot; series, was nominated for the 2006 Agatha Award for Best Novel. Ms. Fowler was nominated along with authors Nancy Pickard (winner), L. C. Hayden, Julia Spencer-Fleming, and Jacqueline Winspear.

<text>The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) is the official executive body of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region in northern Iraq.

The cabinet is selected by the majority party or list who also select the prime minister of the Iraqi Kurdish polity. The president is directly elected by the electorate of the region and is the head of the cabinet and chief of state who delegates executive powers to the cabinet. The prime minister is traditionally the head of the legislative body but also shares executive powers with the president. The President of Kurdistan Region is also the commander-in-chief of the Peshmerga.

== 2014 ==
From mid-2013 to mid-2014, the KRG &quot;built up their own defenses by creating a security belt stretching more than 1,000 km (600 miles) from the Iranian border all the way to Syria – skirting around Mosul, a city of 2 million people they appear[ed] to have no intention of fighting for.&quot; In August 2014, ISIL attacked the Kurds.

On 1 July 2014, Masoud Barzani announced that &quot;Iraq&#x27;s Kurds will hold an independence referendum within months.&quot;

== 2017 ==
In September, the 2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum was held regarding Kurdish independence from Iraq. 92% of Iraqi Kurds participating in the referendum voted in favor of independence. The referendum was regarded as illegal by the federal government in Baghdad, and on 6 November, Iraq&#x27;s Supreme Federal Court ruled that no Iraqi province was allowed to secede in order to preserve the unity of Iraq.

On 14 November, the KRG announced it would respect the Supreme Federal Court&#x27;s ruling, stating that &quot;this decision must become a basis for starting an inclusive national dialogue between (Kurdish authorities in) Erbil and Baghdad to resolve all disputes&quot;.

<doc id="1330583" wikidata="Q4888238" url="?curid=1330583" title="Diagnosis of tuberculosis">
<text>Tuberculosis is diagnosed by finding &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; bacteria in a clinical specimen taken from the patient. While other investigations may strongly suggest tuberculosis as the diagnosis, they cannot confirm it.

A complete medical evaluation for tuberculosis (TB) must include a medical history, a physical examination, a chest X-ray and microbiological examination (of sputum or some other appropriate sample). It may also include a tuberculin skin test, other scans and X-rays, surgical biopsy.

==Medical history==
The medical history includes obtaining the symptoms of pulmonary TB: productive, prolonged cough of three or more weeks, chest pain, and hemoptysis. Systemic symptoms include low grade remittent fever, chills, night sweats, appetite loss, weight loss, easy fatiguability, and production of sputum that starts out mucoid but changes to purulent. Other parts of the medical history include prior TB exposure, infection or disease and medical conditions that increase risk for TB disease such as HIV infection. Depending on the sort of patient population surveyed, as few as 20%, or as many as 75% of pulmonary tuberculosis cases may be without symptoms.

Tuberculosis should be suspected in adults when a pneumonia-like illness has persisted longer than three weeks, or when a respiratory illness in an otherwise healthy individual does not respond to regular antibiotics.

The diagnosis is particularly challenging in children because they more commonly have extrapulmonary disease and present with less mycobacteria (paucibacillary disease).

==Physical examination==
A physical examination is done to assess the patient&#x27;s general health. It cannot be used to confirm or rule out TB. However, certain findings are suggestive of TB. For example, blood in the sputum, significant weight loss and drenching night sweats may be due to TB.

Tuberculosis classification (Class 0 to 5) used in the US is based on the pathogenesis of the disease. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has an additional TB classification (Class A, B1, or B2) for immigrants and refugees developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The (Class) &quot;B notification program&quot; is an important screening strategy to identify new arrivals who have a high risk for TB.

==Microbiological studies==
A definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis can only be made by culturing &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; organisms from a specimen taken from the patient (most often sputum, but may also include pus, CSF, biopsied tissue, etc.). A diagnosis made other than by culture may only be classified as &quot;probable&quot; or &quot;presumed&quot;. For a diagnosis negating the possibility of tuberculosis infection, most protocols require that two separate cultures both test negative.

===Sputum===
Sputum smears and cultures should be done for acid-fast bacilli if the patient is producing sputum. The preferred method for this is fluorescence microscopy (auramine-rhodamine staining), which is more sensitive than conventional Ziehl–Neelsen staining. In cases where there is no spontaneous sputum production, a sample can be induced, usually by inhalation of a nebulized saline or saline with bronchodilator solution. A comparative study found that inducing three sputum samples is more sensitive than three gastric washings.

===Alternative sampling===
In patients incapable of producing a sputum sample, common alternative sample sources for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis include gastric washings, laryngeal swab, bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial washings, and/or transbronchial biopsy), and fine needle aspiration (transtracheal or transbronchial). In some cases, a more invasive technique is necessary, including tissue biopsy during mediastinoscopy or thoracoscopy.

===Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT)===
Other mycobacteria are also acid-fast. If the smear is positive, PCR or gene probe tests can distinguish &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; from other mycobacteria. Even if sputum smear is negative, tuberculosis must be considered and is only excluded after negative cultures.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for TB are a heterogeneous group of tests that use either the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique or transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) or other forms of nucleic acid amplification methods to detect mycobacterial nucleic acid. These tests vary in which nucleic acid sequence they detect and vary in their accuracy. In the decade of the 2000s, the two most common commercially available tests were the amplified mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test (MTD, Gen-Probe) and Amplicor (Roche Diagnostics). In 2007, a systematic review of NAAT by the NHS Health Technology Assessment Programme concluded that &quot;NAAT test accuracy to be far superior when applied to respiratory samples as opposed to other specimens. Although the results were not statistically significant, the AMTD test appears to perform better than other currently available commercial tests.&quot; Xpert ® MTB/RIF and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra has high specificity in diagnosing extrapulmonary tuberculosis and is accurate in detecting rifampicin resistance. However, clinicians should rely on clinical judgement to diagnose TB meningitis when culture results are negative.

A 2007 before-after observational study found that use of the MTD test reduced inappropriate tuberculosis therapy. The study found the accuracy of the MTD test as follows: Overall sensitivity 92%, specificity 99%. In Smear positive patients high sensitivity 99%, specificity 98%. In smear negative patients low sensitivity 62%, but high specificity 99%.

NAA techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) are the basis of molecular diagnosis of TB. To detection of MTB in samples different molecular methods and assays have been defined. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR), microarrays, PURE-LAMP, NGS, and WGS are assays that applicable for all taxa and genes, but some assays have been designed for correct and specific detection of MTB such as Amplicor MTB, Cobas TaqMan MTB, E-MTD, FluoroType MTB, LPA (Genotype MTB/R), Anyplex MTB, Xpert MTB, and Genedrive MTB 

In 2010 the Xpert MTB/RIF test, another NAAT for TB, became commercially available and, as the CDC said in 2015, it began &quot;revolutionizing tuberculosis (TB) control by contributing to the rapid diagnosis of TB disease and drug resistance. The test simultaneously detects &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex&quot; (MTBC) and resistance to rifampin (RIF) in less than 2 hours. In comparison, standard cultures can take 2 to 6 weeks for MTBC to grow and conventional drug resistance tests can add 3 more weeks.&quot; The Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra improves upon the Xpert MTB/RIF test.

===Culture===
Many types of microbiological culture are available. Traditionally, cultures have used the Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ), Kirchner, or Middlebrook media (7H9, 7H10, and 7H11). A culture of the AFB can distinguish the various forms of mycobacteria, although results from this may take four to eight weeks for a conclusive answer. New automated systems that are faster include the MB/BacT, BACTEC 9000, VersaTREK, and the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT). The Microscopic Observation Drug Susceptibility assay culture may be a faster and more accurate method.

==Radiography==
===Chest X-ray and CT===
In active pulmonary TB, infiltrates or consolidations and/or cavities are often seen in the upper lungs with or without mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy or pleural effusions ( tuberculous pleurisy). However, lesions may appear anywhere in the lungs. In disseminated TB a pattern of many tiny nodules throughout the lung fields is common - the so-called miliary TB. In HIV and other immunosuppressed persons, any abnormality may indicate TB or the chest X-ray may even appear entirely normal.

Abnormalities on chest radiographs may be suggestive of, but are not necessarily diagnostic of, TB. However, chest radiographs may be used to rule out the possibility of pulmonary TB in a person who has a positive reaction to the tuberculin skin test and no symptoms of the disease.

Cavitation or consolidation of the apexes of the upper lobes of the lung or the tree-in-bud sign may be visible on an affected patient&#x27;s chest X-ray.
The tree-in-bud sign may appear on the chest CTs of some patients affected by tuberculosis, but it is not specific to tuberculosis.

===FDG PET/CT===
FDG PET/CT can play several useful roles in patients with confirmed or suspected TB. These roles include detection of active TB lesions, assessment of disease activity, differentiation between active and latent disease, assessment of disease extent (staging), monitoring response to treatment, and identification of potential biopsy target.

===Abreugraphy===
A variant of the chest X-Ray, abreugraphy (from the name of its inventor, Dr. Manuel Dias de Abreu) was a small radiographic image, also called miniature mass radiography (MMR) or miniature chest radiograph. Though its resolution is limited (it doesn&#x27;t allow the diagnosis of lung cancer, for example) it is sufficiently accurate for diagnosis of tuberculosis.

Much less expensive than traditional X-Ray, MMR was quickly adopted and extensively utilized in some countries, in the 1950s. For example, in Brazil and in Japan, tuberculosis prevention laws went into effect, obligating ca. 60% of the population to undergo MMR screening.

The procedure went out of favor, as the incidence of tuberculosis dramatically decreased, but is still used in certain situations, such as the screening of prisoners and immigration applicants.

==Immunological tests==

===Tuberculin skin test===
Two tests are available: the Mantoux and Heaf tests.

====Mantoux skin test====


The Mantoux skin test is used in the United States and is endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

If a person has had a history of a positive tuberculin skin test, another skin test is not needed.

====Heaf test====

The Heaf test was used in the United Kingdom until 2005, and is graded on a four-point scale. The Mantoux test is now used.

The equivalent Mantoux test positive levels done with 10 TU (0.1 ml 100 TU/ml, 1:1000) are
* 0–4 mm induration (Heaf 0 to 1)
* 5–14 mm induration (Heaf 2)
* Greater than 15 mm induration (Heaf 3 to 5)

====CDC classification of tuberculin reaction====
An induration (palpable raised hardened area of skin) of more than 5–15 mm (depending upon the person&#x27;s risk factors) to 10 Mantoux units is considered a positive result, indicating TB infection.
* 5 mm or more is positive in
** HIV-positive person
** Recent contacts of TB case
** Persons with nodular or fibrotic changes on CXR consistent with old healed TB
** Patients with organ transplants and other immunosuppressed patients
* 10 mm or more is positive in
** Recent arrivals (less than 5 years) from high-prevalent countries
** Injection drug users
** Residents and employees of high-risk congregate settings (e.g., prisons, nursing homes, hospitals, homeless shelters, etc.)
** Mycobacteriology lab personnel
** Persons with clinical conditions that place them at high risk (e.g., diabetes, prolonged corticosteroid therapy, leukemia, end-stage renal disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes, low body weight, etc.)
** Children less than 4 years of age, or children and adolescents exposed to adults in high-risk categories
* 15 mm or more is positive in
** Persons with no known risk factors for TB
** (Note: Targeted skin testing programs should only be conducted among high-risk groups)

A tuberculin test conversion is defined as an increase of 10 mm or more within a 2-year period, regardless of age.

====Tuberculin skin test after BCG vaccine====

There is disagreement on the use of the Mantoux test on people who have been immunized with BCG. The US recommendation is that in administering and interpreting the Mantoux test, previous BCG vaccination should be ignored; the UK recommendation is that interferon-γ tests should be used to help interpret positive tuberculin tests, also, the UK does not recommend serial tuberculin skin testing in people who have had BCG (a key part of the US strategy). In their guidelines on the use of QuantiFERON Gold the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that whereas Quantiferon Gold is not affected by BCG inoculation tuberculin tests can be affected. In general the US approach is likely to result in more false positives and more unnecessary treatment with potentially toxic drugs; the UK approach is as sensitive in theory and should also be more specific, because of the use of interferon-γ tests.

Under the US recommendations, diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is considered for any BCG-vaccinated person whose skin test is 10 mm or greater, if any of these circumstances are present:
* Was in contact with another person with infectious TB
* Was born or has resided in a high TB prevalence country
* Is continually exposed to populations where TB prevalence is high.

These have been reviewed in detail.

===Interferon-γ release assays===
Interferon-γ (interferon-gamma) release assays (IGRAs) are 21st century tests for tuberculosis. Guidelines for the use of the FDA approved QuantiFERON-TB Gold were released by the CDC in December 2005. In October 2007, the FDA gave approval of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube for use in the United States.For diagnosing &quot;latent&quot; TB, three systematic reviews of IGRAs concluded the tests noted excellent specificity for the tests to distinguish latent TB from prior vaccination. IGRAs are based on the ability of the &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; antigens for early secretory antigen target 6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10) to stimulate host production of interferon-gamma. Because these antigens are only present in few non-tuberculous mycobacteria or not in any BCG vaccine strain, these tests are thought to be more specific than the tuberculin skin test.

The blood tests QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube and T-SPOT.TB use these antigens to detect people with tuberculosis. Lymphocytes from the patient&#x27;s blood are incubated with the antigens. These tests are called interferon γ tests and are not equivalent. If the patient has been exposed to tuberculosis before, T lymphocytes produce interferon γ in response. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube uses an ELISA format to detect the whole blood production of interferon γ. The distinction between the tests is that QuantiFERON-TB Gold quantifies the total amount of interferon γ when whole blood is exposed to the antigens(ESAT-6, CFP-10 and TB 7.7(p4)), whereas 

As of 2003, the enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) has been another blood test available in the UK that may replace the skin test for diagnosis. T-SPOT.TB, a type of ELISpot Assay, counts the number of activated T lymphocytes that secrete interferon γ.

According to a 2007 study from Korea, a high prevalence country of LTBI, QuantiFERON-TB Gold and T-SPOT.TB have good sensitivity but reduced specificity for diagnosing &quot;active&quot; TB, due to their ability to detect latent TB. In a recently published metaanalysis, with data from both developed and developing countries, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube had a pooled sensitivity for active TB of 81% and specificity of 99.2%, whereas T-SPOT.TB had a pooled sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 86.3%. In head-to-head comparisons, the sensitivity of IGRAs surpassed TST. However, several subsequent studies have reported higher sensitivity for TST than for IGRAs in patients with active TB; one large 2017 study reported a sensitivity of 90% for TST and only of 81% for the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay.

A 2012 study at Stanford University confirmed that addition of immune boosters can make the IGRA more reliable in terms of separating positive from negative individuals. A study from the University of Southampton shows that variations in environmental temperatures can have a profound effect on the performance of IGRA. A recently published study from the same group also provided evidence that immunosuppressive agents significantly impair the performance of IGRAs, raising concerns about their reliability in immunosuppressed patients.
Although IGRA replaced the TST in most of clinical settings its variability as of 2013 was a concern while reading the result

===Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) detection assays===
In 2014, tests based on the detection of mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen in urine emerged as point-of-care tests for tuberculosis (TB). LAM antigen is a lipopolysaccharide present in mycobacterial cell walls, which is released from metabolically active or degenerating bacterial cells and appears to be present only in people with active TB disease. Urine-based testing have advantages over sputum-based testing because urine is easy to collect and store, and lacks the infection control risks associated with sputum collection.

In 2015, World Health Organization recommended the use of the Alere Determine TB LAM Ag assay for people with HIV and a CD4 count below 100 cells/μL and in those defined as seriously ill according to WHO criteria (respiratory rate &gt;30 breaths per min, body temperature &gt;39 °C, heart rate &gt;120 beats per min, or unable to walk unaided). This recommendation was informed by a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 cross-sectional or cohort studies that showed a relatively low pooled sensitivity of 45% and specificity of 92% against a microbiological reference standard. Despite the limited sensitivity, test-guided initiation of anti-TB treatment reduced mortality in immunocompromised, hospitalized PLHIV.

In 2019, an international R&amp;D consortium including Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, Fujifilm, University of Cape Town, Rutgers University, University of Alberta and Otsuka funded by Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT) completed the development and a first clinical study of the Fujifilm SILVAMP TB point-of-care LAM assay. Compared with the Alere Determine TB LAM Ag assay, the Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM assay includes novel monoclonal antibodies directed towards the 5-methylthio-d-xylofuranose (MTX) epitope and a silver amplification technology to enable higher diagnostic sensitivity at high specificity. A 2019 study with 968 HIV+ hospital inpatients found the Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM test to have a 28% higher sensitivity than the Alere Determine TB LAM Ag and the Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM could diagnose 65% of patients with active TB within 24 h. A meta-analysis with 1,595 inpatients and outpatients showed 70% sensitivity and 90% specificity for TB diagnosis in people living with HIV for Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM. As of 2020, the test showed a high positive predictive value (95.2%) in HIV-negative outpatients. Large prospective studies are on the way.

===Transcriptomic host response, polygenic risk score===
In 2022, a study reported the use of a fingerstick blood point-of-care triage test by Cepheid (company) looking for messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of 3 genes in response to TB. The Xpert MTB Host Response test calculated a polygenic risk score based on the expression levels of guanylate-binding protein 5 [GBP5], dual-specificity phosphatase 3 [DUSP3], and Krüppel-like factor 2 [KLF2] genes to differentiate between active TB and other diseases.

===Adenosine deaminase===
In 2007, a systematic review of adenosine deaminase by the NHS Health Technology Assessment Programme concluded &quot;There is no evidence to support the use of ADA tests for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB. However, there is considerable evidence to support their use in pleural fluid samples for diagnosis of pleural TB, where sensitivity was very high, and to a slightly lesser extent for TB meningitis. In both pleural TB and TB meningitis, ADA tests had higher sensitivity than any other tests.&quot;

=== Transdermal Patch ===
The transdermal patch is an experimental method&quot; of detecting active &quot;M.tuberculosis&quot; circulating within blood vessels of a patient. The skin patch contains antibodies recognizing the secreted bacterial protein MPB-64 passing through the blood capillaries of the skin creating an immunological response. If the patch detects this secreted bacterial protein, the surrounding skin will redden.

=== rdESAT‑6 and rCFP‑10 ===

The Serum-Mylab Cy-TB Test is approved for use in India.

In October 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; derived antigens (rdESAT-6 / rCFP-10) (brand name Siiltibcy), intended for the diagnosis of &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; infection. The applicant for this medicinal product is Serum Life Science Europe GmbH. The active substances of Siiltibcy are &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; derived antigens rdESAT‑6 and rCFP‑10. Siiltibcy was authorized for medical use in the European Union in January 2025.

==Using trained rats==
In 2018, the international nonprofit organization APOPO was working with Sokoine University of Agriculture in Tanzania to train African giant pouched rats (&quot;Cricetomys ansorgei&quot;) to detect the &quot;scent&quot; of tuberculosis. A recent study shows that &quot;rats increased pediatric tuberculosis detection by 67.6%&quot; and that training these creatures could help address the current challenges related to the diagnosis of this illness in children.

<text>The EMD FT is a diesel-electric locomotive that was produced between March 1939 and November 1945, by General Motors&#x27; Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC), later known as GM Electro-Motive Division (EMD). The &quot;F&quot; stood for Fourteen Hundred (1400) horsepower (rounded from 1350) and the &quot;T&quot; for Twin, as it came standard in a two-unit set. The design was developed from the TA model built for the C,RI&amp;P in 1937, and was similar in cylinder count, axle count, length, and layout. All told 555 cab-equipped ”A” units were built, along with 541 cabless booster or ”B” units, for a grand total of 1,096 units. The locomotives were all sold to customers in the United States. It was the first model in EMD&#x27;s very successful F-unit series of cab unit freight diesels and was the locomotive that convinced many U.S. railroads that the diesel-electric freight locomotive was the future. Many rail historians consider the FT one of the most important locomotive models of all time.

== Design and production ==
The first units produced for a customer were built in December 1940 and January 1941 for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and numbered the 100 set. These were the first diesel-electric locomotives ever produced with dynamic braking, a system developed at the insistence of the railroad and with its assistance. Initially the four-unit, coupler-equipped set featured two booster units between two cab units in the manner of the demonstrator set. The Brotherhoods of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, however, insisted that the two cabs required two crews, so the railway had EMD produce extra boosters, and renumbered its earliest sets into four unit sets with one cab unit and three boosters. Negotiation with the unions soon rectified the situation, but as the road&#x27;s earliest units were geared for higher speeds than subsequent units, these sets continued to be composed of one FTA cab unit and three FTB boosters. This is why the road had ten more FTB booster units than FTA cab units. The original A-B-B-A demonstrator set was sold to the Southern Railway.

The FT was equipped with the EMD 567 medium-speed two-stroke cycle Diesel engine, along with its many successors.

FTs were generally marketed as semi-permanently coupled A-B sets (a lead unit and a cabless booster connected by a solid drawbar) making a single locomotive of . Many railroads used pairs of these sets back to back to make up a four-unit A-B-B-A locomotive rated at . Some railroads purchased semi-permanently coupled A-B-A three-unit sets of . All units in a consist could be run from one cab; multiple unit (MU) control systems linked the units together. Some roads, like the initial customer Santa Fe, ordered all their FTs with regular couplers on both ends of each unit for added flexibility. This package included &quot;hostler&quot; controls for B units, enabling these units to be operated independently of A units for moving within yard limits, and a fifth porthole was provided in the carbody to enable the &quot;hostler&quot; some measure of visibility. Internally, EMD referred to these units as model FS.

==Engine and powertrain==
The FT introduced a 16-cylinder version of the 567 (later 567A) series engine developing at 800 rpm. Designed specifically for railroad locomotives, this mechanically scavenged (Roots-blown) two stroke 45 degree V type, with an bore by stroke giving displacement per cylinder, remained in production until 1966. A D8 D.C. generator provides power to four D7 traction motors, two on each truck, one on each axle, in a B-B arrangement. The Blomberg design introduced here has been EMD&#x27;s standard B truck, used with few exceptions through the F59PHI of 1994. EMD has built all its own components since 1939.

Only the four demonstrator FTs used the 567 U-Deck engine. Those engines were replaced in the demonstrators by 567 V-Deck engines before sale to the Southern in May 1941. All FT locomotives built between December 1940 and February 1943 used the 567 V-Deck engine. The 567 V-Deck engine was replaced in production with the 567A engine in May 1943. All subsequent FT locomotives built from May 1943 to the end of production in November 1945 used the 567A engine.

== Body recognition and appearance ==
The FT is very similar to the later F-units in appearance, but there are some differences that render it distinguishable from later EMD freight cab units. The side panels of the FT were different, but it was fairly common for railroads to alter them to make an earlier unit appear later. As built, FT units had four porthole windows spaced closely together along their sides, and B units with couplers on both ends had a fifth window on one side for the hostler position, if equipped with hostler controls.

The roof is a more reliable indication; FTs had four exhaust stacks along the centerline (flanked by boxy structures if dynamic brakes were included). The radiator fans were recessed within the carbody, and arranged in two pairs, one near each end of the locomotive. Later units have the fans grouped together, and their shrouding extended atop the roof.

The overhangs of the body past the trucks differ in the FT compared to later units. The B-units of FTs ordered in semi-permanently coupled A-B sets, and those with couplers on both ends, have a large overhang on one end (the coupler-equipped end on the paired units) featured on no other EMD B-units. This is not present on the B-units in semi-permanently coupled A-B-A sets, which were called &quot;FTSB&quot; units (for &quot;Short Booster&quot;). At other locations, except the cab front, the FT units have less of an overhang than later units; the trucks appear to be right at the ends of the car bodies.

As with other early cab units - but unlike &quot;hood&quot; type locomotives - the F (and E) series used the body as a structural element, similar to a truss bridge. Most of EMD&#x27;s newer passenger locomotives have a non-structural “cowl” type body built on an underframe derived from freight designs.

== Wartime restrictions ==
During World War II, locomotive production was regulated by the War Production Board. First priority for the diesel prime movers&#x27; manufacturing capability, as well as the materials used in the fabrication and assembly of the engines, electric generators and traction motors was for military use. Steam locomotives could be built with fewer precious materials, and with less conflict with military needs. It was also opportune for eastern railroads to stick with coal-fired steam power while petroleum distribution to the east coast was disrupted in early days of the US war effort. The traditional locomotive builders were prohibited from developing or building diesel road locomotives until early 1945, with the exception of a few dual-service ALCO DL-109s for the New Haven Railway. EMD, however, was purely a diesel builder, and therefore was allowed to build diesel freight locomotives, as consistent with fulfilling Navy needs for their 567 engines. The WPB assigned the FTs to the railroads it deemed most able to benefit from the new locomotives. Santa Fe received by far the largest allocation, given its heavy war traffic and the difficulty and expense of providing water for steam locomotives on its long desert stretches. Were it not for the wartime restrictions, many more FTs would have been built. Most railroads wanted diesels, but often had to settle for steam locomotives.

The wartime restrictions on other manufacturers&#x27; diesel programs helped ensure EMD&#x27;s dominance of the postwar diesel market, as EMD exited the wartime restrictions with a fully mature diesel engine suited for high capacity road use. Other locomotive manufacturers, under extreme competitive pressure from EMD&#x27;s high-powered and reliable 567 engine in the early postwar era, embarked upon crash development programs that yielded unsatisfactory results. EMD&#x27;s advantage resulted in their selling the vast majority of units in the dieselization era and a death spiral for all who tried to compete with them in the early postwar market.

== Subsequent models ==
The FT was discontinued in late 1945, replaced in production by the F2, which retained the rating of the FT, but with upgraded electrical and control equipment. Additionally, the mechanically driven cooling fans, which required constant tending by the locomotive&#x27;s fireman, were replaced with electrically driven fans which were automatically controlled, a system which is still in use to this day. The F2 was produced only in 1946, and afterward was replaced by updated models in the EMD F-unit series, such as the F3, F7, and F9.

== Original buyers ==
== Surviving units ==

Multiple EMD FT units survive today. 

The lead A-unit from demonstrator No. 103 is displayed at the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri. The original A unit was presented to the museum in a June 27, 1961 ceremony. The Virginia Museum of Transportation currently owns a B unit, which was on loan to the Museum of Transportation from 2015 to 2020. Both units are cosmetically restored and painted in the original GM demonstrator paint scheme. However, only the A unit is from the original demonstrator set. The two B units and the other A were eventually scrapped after years of service. The B unit now on display at Roanoke, originally just a regular FT B unit, was later stripped of its engine and other locomotive parts and converted to a boiler car. It later went to the museum in Virginia. In 1989, this former FT B unit, as well as the genuine demonstrator A unit from St. Louis, were repainted in the original demonstrator colors for a celebration at EMD (McCook, Illinois, often described by mailing address LaGrange) for the 50th anniversary of the FT. They toured together and then were returned to their respective museum owners.

One FT-A unit, FSBC 2203-A, is on display in Mexico. It was originally built for the Northern Pacific Railway.

Three B-units from the Southern Railway are preserved. #960604 is at the North Carolina Transportation Museum in Spencer, North Carolina, #960602 is in Conway, South Carolina, and #960603 is at the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri.

<text>The Manhattan Transfer station was a passenger transfer station in Harrison, New Jersey, east of Newark, west of New York Penn Station on the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) main line, now Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor. It operated from 1910 to 1937 and consisted of two car-floor-level platforms, one on each side of the PRR line. It was also served by the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad. There were no pedestrian entrances or exits to the station, as its sole purpose was for passengers to change trains, or for trains to have their locomotives changed.

==History==

=== Need and operation ===

Until 1910, none of the railroads that crossed New Jersey to reach New York City crossed the Hudson River. Instead, passengers rode to terminals on the Hudson Waterfront, where they boarded ferries. The dominant Pennsylvania Railroad was no exception; its passenger trains ran to Exchange Place in Jersey City.

On November 27, 1910, the PRR opened the New York Tunnel Extension, a line that ran through a pair of tunnels under the Hudson River to New York Penn Station. This new line branched off the original line two miles east of Newark, then ran northeast across the Jersey Meadows to the tunnels. Just west of the split, the PRR built the Manhattan Transfer station. Passenger trains bound for New York Penn paused there so that their steam locomotives could be replaced by electric locomotives that could run through the tunnel under the river. The station also allowed passengers to change trains; riders on the main line could transfer to local trains to Exchange Place, where they could catch ferries or Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (H&amp;M) subway trains to 33rd Street Terminal in Manhattan, and riders from Exchange Place could change to PRR main line trains.

The H&amp;M, the precursor to the PATH train, started running trains between Hudson Terminal in Manhattan and Park Place in Newark on October 1, 1911. H&amp;M trains stopped at Exchange Place, Grove Street, Summit Avenue, Manhattan Transfer, and Harrison. Afterward, H&amp;M trains stopped on the outer tracks of the two Manhattan Transfer platforms, allowing passengers to transfer from Penn-Station-bound trains. H&amp;M trains also carried mail bound for PRR trains, retrieving first-class letters sent from the Church Street Station Post Office, near Hudson Terminal, and transferring the letters to PRR trains at Manhattan Transfer.

The H&amp;M ordered MP-38 railcars to run this special service, in partnership with the PRR. The &quot;McAdoo Reds&quot;, as the MP-38s were called, ran only between Manhattan Transfer and New York City, carrying the logos of PRR and H&amp;M to show their partnership. Until 1922 the PRR also operated a shuttle service from Manhattan Transfer to New York Penn, using six converted MP-54 cars.

A spate of serious accidents involving H&amp;M trains took place at Manhattan Transfer in the 1920s. A collision between two PRR trains occurred at Manhattan Transfer on October 27, 1921, injuring 36 people. The cause was heavy fog covering a train signal. Less than a year later, on August 31, 1922, heavy fog caused another collision. This time, the collision was between two H&amp;M trains; fifty people were injured, including eight who were seriously injured. Another collision between two H&amp;M trains near the station on July 22, 1923, killed one person and injured 15 others. A crash between two PRR trains occurred at the station on February 24, 1925, killing 3 and injuring 32 more.

=== Decline ===
Manhattan Transfer was built mainly because PRR trains needed to switch to electric locomotives. In 1913 the PRR&#x27;s board voted to electrify its main line in the Philadelphia area using an 11 kV overhead catenary system. This had to do with the PRR&#x27;s cumbersome operations at Broad Street Station in Philadelphia, where trains had to enter and leave the terminal from the same side, and congestion frequently arose because of the length of time needed for steam locomotives to switch directions. Tracks at Manhattan Transfer were originally electrified with 650 V third rail, which was used by PRR electric trains to Penn Station and Exchange Place, and by H&amp;M trains between Park Place and Hudson Terminal.

In 1928 the PRR and the Newark government agreed to build a new Newark Penn Station to replace three stations: Manhattan Transfer, Park Place, and the PRR&#x27;s Market Street station in Newark. Newark Penn was to be a quarter-mile south of Park Place. The H&amp;M would be extended to Newark Penn via new approach tracks over the Passaic River, and H&amp;M and PRR passengers would be able to connect at Newark Penn instead of Manhattan Transfer.

Contracts to electrify the PRR tracks south of Manhattan Transfer with 11 kV overhead wires were awarded in 1929. Two years later, in light of low interest rates and high unemployment, the PRR&#x27;s president announced plans to speed up the electrification project, with plans to complete it in two and a half years instead of four. In addition, new approach tracks to Newark Penn would be built over the Passaic River. PRR trains to Exchange Place started using the 11 kV catenary system in December 1932. Within two months, the PRR had completed the electrification of the main line from Philadelphia north to New York Penn Station; south to the PRR station in Wilmington, Delaware; and west to the Paoli, Pennsylvania, PRR station. By March 1933 most PRR trains on that stretch of the main line were pulled by electric engines, but PRR trains continued to stop at Manhattan Transfer for the H&amp;M connection. (The branch to South Amboy remained steam for a couple more years, so a few engine changes continued at Manhattan Transfer.) Around 1940 the third rail west of the west end of the tunnels was removed.

On June 20, 1937 the H&amp;M moved from Park Place to Newark Penn Station, and Manhattan Transfer and Park Place closed. Newark Penn allowed transfers between the H&amp;M, the PRR, and the newly extended Newark City Subway, and had exits to the street. Manhattan Transfer was demolished, but the site of the platforms could be seen through the 1960s. The site of the eastbound platform was partly replaced by a yard for the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) in 1967. After the opening of the Aldene Connection, the CNJ started running trains to PRR&#x27;s Newark Penn Station, and the CNJ stored its trains in the yard on the eastbound platform&#x27;s site.

Manhattan Transfer became famous, and the name was used in other contexts. In 1925 John Dos Passos published an acclaimed novel about the busyness of New York City. The tributes to Manhattan Transfer station include a jazz vocal ensemble formed in 1969.

==Layout==
Manhattan Transfer station consisted of two island platforms, one for westbound trains and one for eastbound. Each platform was long and wide. The station itself had four tracks, but several bypass tracks surrounded the station to south and north, and passed between the two platforms. H&amp;M trains stopped on the outer tracks, while PRR trains stopped on the inner tracks. The two platforms were brick, which deteriorated during later years.

West of the station the H&amp;M tracks split to the northwest and entered a viaduct, stopping at Harrison before terminating at Park Place station in Newark. PRR trains continued southwest East of the station, the PRR tracks split to the northeast and continued to New York Penn, while the H&amp;M tracks split to the southeast for to Exchange Place before entering the Downtown Hudson Tubes to Hudson Terminal in New York City. There were two switch towers near the station: Tower N to the west and Tower S to the east.

A sign box was above each platform, each containing around twenty signs, showing common destinations, as well as &quot;named&quot; trains. Before the arrival of the next train, a platform attendant would use a long pole to change the signs displayed.

The only access to the station was by train, with no access to the surrounding area. It was estimated that 230 million passengers had used Manhattan Transfer during its 27 years in operation.

<text>Ole Anders Olsen (born 15 September 1975), known professionally as Andy LaPlegua, is a Norwegian singer, originally known for being founder and lead vocalist of futurepop band Icon of Coil. He also gained fame in the aggrotech and electro-industrial scenes as founder and lead vocalist of Combichrist and Panzer AG.

== Biography ==
Following the death of Prince, LaPlegua revealed that the biggest musical influences in his life growing up in the early &#x27;80s were David Bowie, Motörhead, Prince, The Cure, and Dead Kennedys.

Originally a part of several scenes in Norway, LaPlegua experimented with hip-hop in the Detroit techno/Old School band LAW, industrial in Devils into Crime, punk in My Right Choice/Fleshfire and metal in Lash Out. He also found interest in trance and club music making his mark on the scene with his involvement in the bands Plastic Life and Sector9.

Early on, he was the vocalist in Fredrikstad based hardcore/metal band My Right Choice - who released an EP under the project name Fleshfire, as well as stand-in (and later permanent) vocalist for Lash Out.
Icon of Coil was formed as a solo project in 1997. After becoming very enthusiastic about the music and its possibilities, LaPlegua invited a former bandmate of his, Sebastian Komor to join Icon of Coil to perform live. After several public performances and the release of &quot;Shallow Nation&quot;, IoC&#x27;s first album, Komor joined the band full-time.

Combichrist was officially launched in 2003. It was created as a more aggressive alternative to Icon of Coil. Panzer AG was officially launched in 2004. LaPlegua combined the danceability of Icon of Coil and the hard-hitting beats of Combichrist when he created Panzer AG. His fourth, most techno-oriented project, is (DJ) Scandy. His new project, Scandinavian Cock, is a rockabilly/psychobilly act.

== Personal life ==
LaPlegua was married to German model and actress Sophia Thomalla in March 2016, and they announced their divorce a year later in May 2017. In December 2018 he was engaged to Liv Blankenship; they married in 2020. As of March 2024, he is engaged to Maegan McKenney.

<text>Andrzej Maksymilian Fredro (1620 – 15 June 1679) was a Polish szlachcic and writer.

== Biography ==
Andrzej Maksymilian Fredro was born in 1620. He studied at the Cracow Academy.

He was castellan of Lwów from 1654 and voivode of the Podolian Voivodeship from 1676. He was Marshal of the Sejm (zwyczajny) from 16 January to 11 March 1652 in Warsaw. At that sejm Władysław Siciński used liberum veto for the first time. Fredro fortified Przemyśl in 1658–1660.

He died on 15 June 1679.
In his political writing, Fredro argues that liberum veto is necessary for a republic as big as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. When one region of the Commonwealth falls into crisis, nobles from other regions may not be fully aware of the danger. Decision by majority in the Sejm is dangerous for such a big republic, because it enables the majority to ignore the interests of a particular region which has gotten into difficulty and asks the nation for help.

He was married to Katarzyna Gidzińska.

<doc id="1330618" wikidata="Q570360" url="?curid=1330618" title="The Innocent Age">
<text>The Innocent Age is a double album by American singer-songwriter Dan Fogelberg, released in 1981. It was one of his most successful albums: three of his four Top 10 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart (&quot;Hard to Say&quot; (no. 7), &quot;Same Old Lang Syne&quot; (no. 9), and &quot;Leader of the Band&quot; (no. 9)) were from this album, as well as another Top 20 single in &quot;Run for the Roses&quot; (no. 18). All four also reached the Top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; adult contemporary chart, with &quot;Leader of the Band&quot; reaching number 1 on that chart. 

The album includes his song &quot;Times Like These&quot;, from the 1980 &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; soundtrack. Joni Mitchell, Emmylou Harris, Glenn Frey and Don Henley are prominent contributing vocalists. 

&quot;The Innocent Age&quot; drew its inspiration from Thomas Wolfe&#x27;s major novel &quot;Of Time and the River&quot;.
&quot;The Innocent Age&quot; was originally released as a two-LP vinyl set and later as a two-disc CD set.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; deemed the album &quot;banal and overblown.&quot;

<text>Robert Alda (born Alfonso Giuseppe Giovanni Roberto D&#x27;Abruzzo; February 26, 1914 – May 3, 1986) was an Italian-American theatrical and film actor, a singer, and a dancer. He was the father of actors Alan and Antony Alda. Alda was featured in a number of Broadway productions, then moved to Italy during the early 1960s. He appeared in many European films over the next two decades, occasionally returning to the U.S. for film appearances such as &quot;The Girl Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1969).

==Career==
He began his performing career as a singer and dancer in vaudeville after winning a talent contest, and moved on to burlesque.

In 1949, as part of the Jack Carson&#x27;s radio program, Alda toured with Jack Carson and Marion Hutton.&lt;ref name=&quot;bandchirps/marion-hutton&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Alda is known for portraying George Gershwin in the biographical film &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; (1945) as well as the talent agent in the Douglas Sirk classic &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; (1959). On Broadway, he originated the role of Sky Masterson in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1950), for which he won a Tony Award, and starred in &quot;What Makes Sammy Run?&quot; (1964). He was also the host of the DuMont TV version of the game show &quot;What&#x27;s Your Bid?&quot; (May–June 1953).

In the mid-1950s, Alda starred as espionage agent Colonel Bill Morgan in the syndicated TV series &quot;Secret Files USA&quot;, the episodes of which were based on stories from American intelligence services. He was host of the TV game show &quot;Can Do&quot; in 1956.

Alda made two guest appearances with his son Alan on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, in the episodes &quot;The Consultant&quot; (January 1975) and &quot;Lend a Hand&quot; (February 1980). The latter episode also featured Antony Alda, his younger son by his second wife.

Alda appeared in an episode of &quot;The Feather &amp; Father Gang&quot; in 1977.

==Personal life==
Alda&#x27;s first wife, and mother of actor Alan Alda, Joan Browne, was a homemaker and former beauty pageant winner. They divorced in 1946.

<doc id="1330654" wikidata="Q505256" url="?curid=1330654" title="Joe Greene">
<text>Charles Edward Greene (born September 24, 1946), better known as &quot;Mean&quot; Joe Greene, is an American former professional football defensive tackle who played for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL) from 1969 to 1981. A recipient of two NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards, five first-team All-Pro selections, and ten Pro Bowl appearances, Greene is widely considered to be one of the greatest defensive linemen to play in the NFL. He was noted for his leadership, fierce competitiveness, and intimidating style of play for which he earned his nickname.

Born and raised in Temple, Texas, Greene attended North Texas State University—now University of North Texas—where he earned consensus All-America honors as a senior playing for the North Texas State Eagles football team. He was selected by the Steelers fourth overall in the 1969 NFL draft and made an immediate impact with the team, as he was named the NFL&#x27;s Defensive Rookie of the Year. Greene is credited with providing the foundation upon which Steelers coach Chuck Noll turned the dismal franchise into a sports dynasty. He was the centerpiece of the &quot;Steel Curtain&quot; defense that led Pittsburgh to four Super Bowl championships in a six-year span.

Throughout his career, Greene was one of the most dominant defensive players in the NFL, able to overpower opposing offensive linemen with ease and disrupt blocking. Former teammate Andy Russell called Greene &quot;unquestionably the NFL&#x27;s best player in the seventies&quot;. He is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame, and his number 75 jersey is one of only three retired by the Steelers. Greene is also well known for his appearance in the &quot;Hey Kid, Catch!&quot; Coca-Cola commercial, which aired during Super Bowl XIV and solidified his reputation as a &quot;tough football player who&#x27;s a nice guy&quot;.

==Early life and college==
Charles Edward Greene was born September 24, 1946, in Temple, Texas. He played high school football at Dunbar High School in Temple. Despite Greene&#x27;s talents, the Dunbar Panthers had a mediocre record, and he was not heavily recruited by colleges. His options were limited further due to segregation of the Southwest Conference. He was eventually offered a scholarship to play college football at North Texas State University (now University of North Texas), where he played for Odus Mitchell on the varsity team from 1966 to 1968. In the three seasons he played on the squad, they had a 23–15–1 record. With a per-carry average of less than two yards in his 39 games at defensive tackle, North Texas State limited the opposition to 2,507 yards on 1,276 rushes. Greene was a three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference selection.

In his junior season Greene married Agnes Craft, also a student at North Texas State and the daughter of a Dallas businessman. Tight on money, they were wed at Craft&#x27;s sister&#x27;s house in Dallas. Chuck Beatty, Greene&#x27;s teammate at North Texas and later again in the NFL with the Steelers, served as best man.

As a senior, Greene was a consensus pick as a defensive tackle for the 1968 All-America team, earning first-team honors from United Press International (UPI), the Newspaper Enterprise Association, and &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, among others. His college coach, Rod Rust, said of Greene: &quot;There are two factors behind Joe&#x27;s success. First, he has the ability to make the big defensive play and turn the tempo of a game around. Second, he has the speed to be an excellent pursuit player.&quot; A pro scout said, &quot;He&#x27;s tough and mean and comes to hit people. He has good killer instincts. He&#x27;s mobile and hostile.&quot;

==Nickname==
While sources agree the name is a reference to North Texas&#x27; athletics teams, the Mean Green, there are conflicting accounts as to how, when, and why Greene received his &quot;Mean Greene&quot; nickname. When he first arrived at North Texas, the university&#x27;s moniker was the Eagles. In 1966, Greene&#x27;s first year on the varsity team, the team adopted the &quot;Mean Green&quot; moniker. Two possible origins of the nickname are two separate cheers that supposedly developed independently during North Texas&#x27; 1966 game against UTEP. One cheer was by Sidney Sue Graham, wife of the North Texas sports information director. In response to a tackle by Greene, she blurted out, &quot;That&#x27;s the way, Mean Greene!&quot; Bill Mercer, former North Texas play-by-play announcer, states Graham&#x27;s thought behind the nickname was the Mean Green defense. Meanwhile, in the student section, North Texas basketball players Willie Davis and Ira Daniels, unsatisfied with the unenthusiastic crowd, began to sing, &quot;Mean Green, you look so good to me&quot;. The rest of the crowd soon followed. &quot;After that we did it every game,&quot; Davis said. &quot;A lot of people later on started associating it with Joe because his last name was Greene, but it actually started with that simple chant that Saturday night at Fouts Field. And that&#x27;s the truth.&quot;

Although it stuck with him throughout his professional career due to his playing style, Greene himself was not fond of the nickname, insisting it did not reflect his true character. &quot;I just want people to remember me as being a good player and not really mean,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to be remembered for playing 13 years and contributing to four championship teams. I would like to be remembered for maybe setting a standard for others to achieve.&quot;

As for the “Joe” part of his nickname (since his given name was Charles, not Joseph), that came from one of his aunts. During a 2014 interview with NFL Films, Greene said that his aunt nicknamed him Joe due to his resemblance to boxing legend Joe Louis, who at the time of Greene&#x27;s birth was in the middle of his 12-year reign as heavyweight champion. &quot;She thought I was hefty and bulky enough to be called Joe Louis,&quot; Greene said. &quot;She started calling me Joe, and it kind of stuck.&quot;

==Professional football career==
The Pittsburgh Steelers franchise was one of the most downtrodden in the NFL, having experienced many losing seasons before the hiring of Chuck Noll as head coach in 1969. Noll and the Rooney family, which had owned the franchise since its formation, agreed that building the defensive line was crucial to rebuilding the team. Thus, they decided on Greene with the fourth pick of the 1969 NFL draft. The selection proved unpopular with fans and media, who were hoping for a player that would generate excitement; the relatively unknown Greene did not appear to meet their expectations. Meanwhile, Greene, who was highly competitive, was disappointed he was picked by a team that had such a reputation for losing. &quot;I did not, did not want to be a Steeler,&quot; he admitted in a 2013 interview. Noll saw immense potential in Greene and insisted on drafting him. Ken Kortas, who had played in all 42 games as defensive tackle over the previous three seasons, was soon traded away to the Chicago Bears to accommodate him on the roster. In a matter of months he established himself as one of the most dominant players in the league at his position. Despite his team finishing 1969 with a 1–13 record, the Associated Press (AP) named Greene the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, and he was invited to his first Pro Bowl.

Former teammate Andy Russell called Greene &quot;unquestionably the NFL&#x27;s best player in the seventies,&quot; saying &quot;No player had a greater impact or did more for his team.&quot; Greene and coach Noll are widely credited with turning the Steelers franchise around. The Steelers finished 1970 with a 5–9 record and went 6–8 in 1971. Greene was invited to the Pro Bowl in both seasons. In 1972, Pittsburgh finished 11–3 and won its first division title and its first playoff game—the &quot;Immaculate Reception&quot; game against the Oakland Raiders. During the season, Greene tallied 11 quarterback sacks and 42 solo tackles, and he was recognized as the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year. Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula lauded Greene, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s just a super super star. It&#x27;s hard to believe he isn&#x27;t offside on every play. He makes the other team adjust to him.&quot; By this time, Noll had built a formidable defense. &quot;We have maybe 10 guys now capable of making All-Pro,&quot; said Greene in 1972. &quot;I&#x27;m just like all the other guys, doing my best in a team effort.&quot;
With the drafting of defensive tackle Ernie Holmes in 1972, the Steelers assembled what became known as the &quot;Steel Curtain&quot; defensive line of Greene, Holmes, L. C. Greenwood, and Dwight White. Greene was invited to the Pro Bowl for 1973, joining White and Greenwood on the American Football Conference (AFC) roster.

Greene won his second AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award after the 1974 season, becoming the first player to receive the award multiple times. That year, he developed a new tactic of lining up at a sharp angle between the guard and center to disrupt the opposition&#x27;s blocking assignments. His coaches were at first skeptical of the tactic and did not allow him to try it during the regular season. He first implemented it against the Buffalo Bills in the division championship game. It proved to be highly effective, as it impeded Buffalo&#x27;s blocking, and running back O. J. Simpson managed only 48 yards rushing. The following week, the Steelers faced the Oakland Raiders in the AFC championship game, with the defining match-up being Greene against All-Pro center Jim Otto. At one point Greene, consumed by emotions, kicked Otto in the groin. Later, on a third-down play, Greene threw Otto to the ground with one arm before leaping to sack quarterback Ken Stabler. Oakland was held to 29 rushing yards in the Steelers&#x27; 24–13 victory. On January 12, 1975, the Steelers won their first of four Super Bowl championships in a six-year span by defeating the Minnesota Vikings 16–6 in Super Bowl IX. In that game, lined up against center Mick Tingelhoff, Greene recorded an interception, forced fumble, and fumble recovery in what is considered one of the greatest individual defensive Super Bowl performances. Pittsburgh limited the Vikings to only 119 total yards of offense, 17 of which were gained on the ground. After the season, Greene was honored by the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; at its 39th Dapper Dan dinner as Pittsburgh&#x27;s outstanding sports figure of the year.
Greene missed four games in 1975 due to a pinched nerve, snapping a streak of 91 straight games started since he entered the league. In December 1975, he and the other members of the Steel Curtain appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. After leading the Steelers to another Super Bowl win after the 1975 season over the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl X, Greene missed the first several games of the 1976 season with a back injury. The Steelers started off the season 1–4 and looked like they would not make the playoffs. Quarterback Terry Bradshaw was also injured and was replaced by rookie Mike Kruczek. Greene returned and the Steelers defense carried the team to nine-straight wins and the playoffs. With a defense considered one of the best in NFL history, the 1976 Steelers held opponents to an average of less than 10 points per game (138 points over 14 games). During their nine-game winning streak, the Steelers defense recorded five shutouts, including three straight, and surrendered a total of 28 points (roughly 3 points per game). The defense allowed only two touchdowns over those nine games. The Steelers were defeated by the Raiders in that year&#x27;s AFC championship game.

By 1977, Greene was the captain of the Steelers defense, although his reduced effectiveness over the previous two seasons due to injuries led to rumors that he was washed up. He was never again able to attain the same success as a pass rusher after his pinched nerve in 1975. Spurred by the rumors, he returned in 1978 to lead all Pittsburgh linemen in tackles, and he had four sacks and a career-high five fumble recoveries. The Steelers defense allowed a league-low 195 points during the season, en route to a 35–31 victory over the Cowboys in Super Bowl XIII. In that contest, Greene had one of Pittsburgh&#x27;s five sacks of Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach.

Pittsburgh finished the 1979 season with a 12–4 record, and ranked second in total defense and fifth in scoring defense. Greene was named a first-team All-Pro by the Pro Football Writers Association and &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot; and was invited to his final Pro Bowl. He was also deemed the NFL&#x27;s Man of the Year in recognition of his off-field contributions. In the AFC championship game against the Houston Oilers, the Steelers held NFL MVP Earl Campbell to just 15 rushing yards on 17 carries. Pittsburgh then defeated the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl XIV for an unprecedented fourth Super Bowl title. With the fourth title came Greene&#x27;s fourth Super Bowl ring, inspiring his famous phrase, &quot;one for the thumb&quot;, an allusion to winning a fifth championship. His wish went unfulfilled, however, as the Steelers failed to reach the playoffs in each of his final two seasons.

Greene retired as a player following the 1981 season. He finished his career having played in 181 out of a possible 190 games, and recorded 77.5 sacks (unofficially, as sacks were not an official statistic until 1982) and 16 fumble recoveries. His spot in the lineup was technically not replaced; the Steelers switched to a 3–4 defensive alignment for the 1982 season, which has only one nose tackle as opposed to two defensive tackles. The team has used the 3–4 as its base alignment continuously in the years since Greene&#x27;s retirement, and more recently have used alignments that deploy only two true linemen.

==Attitude and playing style==

Greene&#x27;s nickname remained popular due to his exploits on the playing field, where he was described as ferocious and intimidating. He instilled fear in opponents with the intensity of his play. In a 1979 game against the Houston Oilers, with only seconds remaining and Houston leading 20–17, the Oilers lined up near the Pittsburgh goal line to run their final play. With victory already assured for the Oilers, Greene pointed angrily across the line of scrimmage at Houston quarterback Dan Pastorini, warning, &quot;If you come into the end zone, I&#x27;ll beat the crap out of you! I&#x27;m gonna kill you!&quot; Pastorini responded by taking a knee, ending the game. Afterward, Greene laughed and said, &quot;I knew you weren&#x27;t going to do it.&quot;

In his early years with the Steelers, Greene was at times uncontrollable, and often let his temper get the best of him. On one occasion during a 1975 game against the rival Cleveland Browns at Cleveland Municipal Stadium, Greene repeatedly kicked Browns lineman Bob McKay in the groin while McKay was lying on the ground. He also punched Denver Broncos guard Paul Howard and spat at quarterback Fran Tarkenton, and he frequently clashed with officials.

Greene and middle linebacker Jack Lambert became the emotional leaders of Pittsburgh&#x27;s defensive squad. Greene was described as a huge presence both on and off the field. Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled an instance in which a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had just gone through as he yanked off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene lifted his head and silently glared at him. &quot;Believe me, that&#x27;s all Joe did, he never even said anything,&quot; said Gordon. &quot;I don&#x27;t think the other players saw Joe glare at him. I think the other player just felt it, and then he sat down and never said another word.&quot; A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. &quot;If you were giving less than 100 percent, he let you know one way or the other,&quot; said Swann.

==Acting career==
===Coca-Cola commercial===

Greene appeared in a famous commercial for Coca-Cola that debuted on October 1, 1979, and was aired during Super Bowl XIV on January 20, 1980. The ad won a Clio Award in 1980 for being one of the best commercials of 1979. It is widely considered to be one of the best television commercials of all time. The commercial helped shift the public&#x27;s perception of Greene as hostile and unapproachable, to a soft-hearted &quot;nice guy&quot;.

===Other roles===
While most well known for the Coca-Cola commercial, Greene has acted in other roles. One of his first acting roles was in &quot;The Black Six&quot;, a blaxploitation film starring other NFL players including fellow Hall of Famers Lem Barney, Willie Lanier, and Carl Eller. Greene also played himself in the movie &quot;...All The Marbles&quot;, a TV movie on teammate Rocky Bleier, titled &quot;Fighting Back: The Rocky Bleier Story&quot;, and in &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot;, in which he was ordered to &quot;tackle that car&quot; by Terry Bradshaw when Sherriff Buford T. Justice, played by Jackie Gleason, was in pursuit of Burt Reynolds&#x27; &quot;Bandit&quot;. Greene then went and &quot;tackled&quot; Justice&#x27;s patrol car, turning it completely over.

==Coaching career and later life==
After retiring from the NFL, Greene spent one year, 1982, as a color analyst for &quot;NFL on CBS&quot; before becoming an assistant coach under Steelers&#x27; head coach Chuck Noll in 1987. He spent the next 16 years as an assistant coach with the Pittsburgh Steelers (1987–1991), Miami Dolphins (1991–1995), and Arizona Cardinals (1996–2003). In 2004, he retired from coaching and was named the special assistant for player personnel for the Steelers. In this position, he earned his fifth Super Bowl ring after the Steelers won Super Bowl XL. When asked how it felt to finally win &quot;one for the thumb&quot;, he replied, &quot;That&#x27;s all utter nonsense. It&#x27;s one for the right hand. It&#x27;s one for &quot;this&quot; group, for &quot;this&quot; team.&quot; He earned a sixth ring from Super Bowl XLIII. Greene is one of four people outside the Rooney family to have Super Bowl rings from the first six championship seasons. He retired from his position in the Steelers front office in 2013.

In 2014, Greene was the subject of an episode of the NFL Network documentary series &quot;A Football Life&quot;, which chronicled his life and career. As of 2024, he resides in Flower Mound, Texas. His wife of 47 years, Agnes, with whom he had three children, died in 2015. He has since remarried to Charlotte Greene. Greene is known as &quot;Papa Joe&quot; to his seven grandchildren. In 2017, Greene released an autobiography entitled &quot;Mean Joe Greene: Built by Football&quot;.

In 2018, Greene set up the Agnes Lucille Craft Greene Memorial Scholarship in honor of his late wife. The scholarships are presented annually to students from Texas, whose parents have battled cancer.

==Legacy==

Greene is recognized as one of the most dominant players to ever play in the NFL. He is widely considered one of the greatest defensive linemen in league history. His durability allowed him to play in 181 of a possible 190 games, including a streak of 91 straight to begin his career. The Steel Curtain defense is consistently ranked among the top defensive groups of all time. As of the death of L. C. Greenwood in September 2013, Greene is the last surviving member of the Steel Curtain.

===Post-career honors===
* In 1984, Greene was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. He is the only former UNT player so honored. 
* His number 75 jersey is retired by the North Texas football team, and he was inducted into the UNT Hall of Fame in 1981.
* He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987, a class which also included Larry Csonka, Len Dawson, Jim Langer, Don Maynard, Gene Upshaw, and John Henry Johnson. 
* The Hall of Fame Selection Committee named Greene to the NFL 1970s All-Decade Team, honoring the best players of the decade. In 1994, he was selected by a 15-person panel of NFL and Pro Football Hall of Fame officials, former players, and media representatives to the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team as one of the greatest players of the NFL&#x27;s first 75 years.
* In 1999, Greene was deemed the 14th greatest player of all time by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. He was ranked 13th on &quot;The Top 100: NFL&#x27;s Greatest Players&quot; by the NFL Network in 2010.
* Greene is regarded among the greatest players in Steelers franchise history. His number 75 jersey was officially retired at halftime during the Steelers&#x27; game against the rival Baltimore Ravens on November 2, 2014. Greene also briefly wore number 72 during his rookie season before switching to his more familiar 75 mid-season. He is only the third Steeler to have his jersey formally retired, the first being Ernie Stautner and the other being Franco Harris. However, the Steelers had not reissued No. 75 since Greene&#x27;s retirement, and it had been understood long before 2014 that no Steeler would ever wear it again.
* The University of North Texas, Greene&#x27;s alma mater, unveiled a statue of him outside of Apogee Stadium in 2018. Greene is regarded as the most famous alum of UNT.
* In 2015, the Mean Joe Greene Community Football Field was dedicated in Greene&#x27;s honor in his hometown of Temple, Texas.
* In 2019, Greene was named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team as one of the greatest players of the NFL&#x27;s first 100 years.

<text>The Battle of Fort George was fought during the War of 1812, in which the Americans defeated a British force and captured Fort George in Upper Canada. The troops of the United States Army and vessels of the United States Navy cooperated in a very successful amphibious assault, although most of the opposing British force escaped encirclement.

==Background==
Fort George was the westernmost of the British fortified posts on Lake Ontario, the others being York, the provincial capital of Upper Canada, and Kingston where most of the ships of the Provincial Marine were based. The fort was situated on the western bank of the Niagara River near its mouth. On the American side of the river lay Fort Niagara. Fort George was constructed to replace and counterbalance Fort Niagara, which the British lost to the Americans after Jay&#x27;s Treaty of 1796.

==Events in 1812==
At the beginning of the war both the British forces near Fort George and the American forces at Fort Niagara felt unprepared for conflict. On May 18, 1812, Sir George Prévost, the Governor General of the Canadas, wrote a letter in response to the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies who was inquiring about the military situation in Canada. He stated that there were 400 soldiers of the 41st Regiment and a Captain&#x27;s Command of Artillery stationed at Fort George. He also wrote that he felt Fort George would not be able to withstand an attack by the Americans if they came with a considerable force. On the American side, Colonel Philetus Swift and Benjamin Barton wrote before the war to the Governor of New York, Daniel Tompkins, that Fort Niagara would fall to the British if a war were to be declared. By July 1812 however, the American commander at Fort Niagara was expecting a British attack and was demanding more reinforcements.

On October 8, 1812, Major General Stephen Van Rensselaer of the New York state militia outlined a plan of attack to send a militia force from Lewiston to attack Queenston which would force the British to send soldiers from Fort George to Queenston. When that happened, a force of U.S. Regulars commanded by Brigadier General Alexander Smyth were to travel by boat from Four Mile Creek to the rear of Fort George and capture the fort. This plan failed to materialize, in part because Smyth failed to cooperate. An attempt to carry out the plan on the night of October 10/11 was thwarted by bad weather. Smyth marched his detachment back to Black Rock, New York.

Van Rensselaer attacked Queenston with the troops he had at Lewiston on the night of October 13/14, without Smyth&#x27;s troops.
During the ensuing Battle of Queenston Heights, the guns of Fort George and Fort Niagara began to fire at the opposite fort. During the exchange the Americans set fire to the court house, jail, and fifteen or sixteen other buildings. During this battle Fort George was left under the control of Major Thomas Evans and there were no more than twenty soldiers acting as the main guards.

==American plans==
The Americans drafted a new plan on February 10, 1813. The plan was to attack Kingston, then York from Sackets Harbor with 4,000 soldiers. Only then were they to assault Fort George. Simultaneously 3,000 soldiers from Buffalo, New York, were to capture Fort Erie then march on Fort George. This plan was changed to avoid Kingston because Major General Henry Dearborn, commander of the United States armies on the frontier with Canada, believed false reports that there were 6,000 to 8,000 British soldiers at Kingston.

On April 27, the Americans on Lake Ontario under Dearborn and Commodore Isaac Chauncey gained success at the Battle of York, occupying the town for several days and capturing many guns and stores, although Brigadier General Zebulon Pike and several dozen soldiers were killed by an exploding magazine. The American army was then transported across the lake in Chauncey&#x27;s ships to Fort Niagara. Dearborn planned to attack Fort George next, but his army required rest and reorganisation. No preparations had been made to accommodate the troops at Fort Niagara, and they suffered considerable shortages and privations for several days. In particular, the wounded were left without shelter or medical attention.

On May 15, Colonel Winfield Scott took up his appointment as Dearborn&#x27;s Adjutant General (i.e. Chief of Staff), having been exchanged after being captured at the Battle of Queenston Heights in the previous year. (The British maintained that Scott had only been paroled pending an exchange, and protested when he took up the appointment.) Scott improved the army&#x27;s administration and pushed forward the plans for the forthcoming attack. At the same time, Master Commandant Oliver Hazard Perry of the United States Navy, who had arrived from Lake Erie to request sailors and supplies for his squadron and was temporarily serving as one of Chauncey&#x27;s senior officers, reconnoitred the landing sites at the mouth of the Niagara River, taking bearings and placing marker buoys.

At Fort George, the Americans planned to land on the shore of the lake rather than on the shore of the Niagara River. The troops would be supported as they landed by twelve schooners, each mounting one or more heavy cannon, which could approach the shore closely. Two larger vessels, the corvette and the brig , would engage the nearest British batteries.

The American army numbered approximately 4,000 regular infantry. The force was divided into four waves, which would land in succession. The first wave was to be commanded by Scott himself, the second by Brigadier General John Parker Boyd, a professional soldier, and the third by Brigadier General William H. Winder, a recently commissioned lawyer. A brigade under a political appointee, Brigadier General John Chandler, formed the reserve, with most of the artillery under Colonel Alexander Macomb. The Army&#x27;s second-in-command, Major General Morgan Lewis, was nominally in overall command of the landing force. Dearborn, the commander in chief, would observe from aboard &quot;Madison&quot;.

As the American preparations proceeded, on May 25 they began to bombard Fort George from their positions along the river and from Fort Niagara, and also from Chauncey&#x27;s schooners. The gunners in the fort and the nearby batteries were using cannonballs which had been heated in furnaces until they were red-hot, then quickly loaded into cannons and fired. Several log buildings within Fort George burned down, and the women and children in the fort were forced to take shelter within the bastions.

==British situation==
The commander of the British forces on the Niagara peninsula was Brigadier General John Vincent. He had 1,000 regular soldiers (the bulk of the 1st battalion of the 8th (King&#x27;s) Regiment and the 49th Regiment, with detachments of the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles and the Glengarry Light Infantry). There were also up to 300 militia present, including Captain Runchey&#x27;s Company of Coloured Men.

Although Vincent knew that an assault was imminent, he could not know from which direction it would come. To try to cover the entire threatened front, he split his regulars into three detachments and would counterattack the Americans when they landed. Most regulars were placed on the Niagara River, assuming that the Americans would attack under cover of their guns in Fort Niagara.

==Battle==
The attack, however, did not come along the Niagara River. Just after dawn on May 27, an early morning fog dispersed to reveal the American vessels off the lake shore to the west. Vincent believed he saw 14 or 15 vessels and 90 to 100 large boats and scows each with 50 or 60 soldiers. Scott&#x27;s troops began landing west of the mouth of the Niagara River, while Perry&#x27;s schooners silenced the nearby British batteries. Scott&#x27;s force consisted of the U.S. 1st Rifle Regiment under Major Benjamin Forsyth, two companies of the U.S. 15th Infantry and the bulk of the U.S. 2nd Artillery, fighting as infantry. A company of the Glengarry Light Infantry charged the Americans with the bayonet as they waded ashore. Winfield Scott had to personally fight off a Glengarry soldier while falling into the water. The Glengarry company was outnumbered and forced to retreat, losing half their men. A company of the Royal Newfoundland also attacked but took heavy casualties from grapeshot fired by the schooners.

Scott advanced from the beach but was counter-attacked by British troops (the remnants of the troops which had already engaged Scott, plus five companies of the 8th (King&#x27;s), Runchey&#x27;s company and 100 other militia) which had been concentrated in a ravine out of the American fire. Scott was driven back, but once again the fire from Perry&#x27;s schooners caused heavy losses among the British. Scott&#x27;s force was reinforced by the leading troops of Boyd&#x27;s brigade, which was just landing, and the British were driven back in turn.

As Winder&#x27;s brigade also began landing, Vincent realized that he was outnumbered and outflanked and decided to evacuate his soldiers before they were completely encircled. He ordered an immediate retreat south to Queenston. Although he ordered the fort&#x27;s guns to be spiked and the magazines to be blown up, the task was so hastily performed and Scott pursued so closely that the Americans were able to secure the fort substantially intact. One small magazine did explode, and the blast threw Scott from his horse and broke his collarbone. (Some British women and children had been left behind in the fort in the hasty retreat and would have suffered heavy casualties if the demolitions had proceeded as Vincent ordered.)

Scott continued to press after Vincent and the American batteries bombarded the retreating British from the other side of the river. Vincent&#x27;s rearguards, including Merritt&#x27;s Troop of Provincial Dragoons, held off Scott although several stragglers were captured. However, the American plan had allowed for only two companies of light dragoons commanded by Colonel James Burn to cross the Niagara above Fort George cut off Vincent&#x27;s retreat. The dragoons were delayed in their crossing by a British battery, and Burn cautiously waited for both companies to assemble before moving against Vincent, by which time Scott had reached Burn&#x27;s position. As Scott waited for the American dragoons to reorganise before pressing on again, Brigadier General Boyd brought him orders from Major General Lewis to abandon the pursuit and return to Fort George. Lewis feared that the British would lead Scott into an ambush.

==Casualties==
The U.S. Army lost one officer and 39 enlisted men killed and five officers and 106 other ranks wounded; for a total of 40 killed and 111 wounded. Most of the casualties were in Boyd&#x27;s 1st Brigade. The 2nd Brigade under William Winder saw comparatively light fighting, and only 6 of its men were wounded. The New York Volunteers had 4 men wounded. The 3rd Brigade under Chandler, the last to arrive, suffered no casualties, while the U.S. Navy lost one killed and two wounded. Richard Feltoe gives much higher casualties of 111 killed and 192 wounded.

The British official casualty return, for the regular troops only, gave 52 killed, 44 wounded and 262 missing; also mentioning that 16 men who had been &quot;wounded on former occasions&quot; had been left behind in the Fort George military hospital and were not included in the casualty total. The detachment of the (local) Lincoln Militia who fought at the battle lost 5 officers and 80 other ranks, although only four of these seem to have been killed. According to their official report, the Americans took 276 prisoners, 163 of whom were wounded. General Boyd offered his own personal tally - 107 killed, according to his burial parties, with 175 wounded brought in and another 105 unwounded prisoners. The wounded prisoners would have included the 16 wounded patients captured in the Fort George hospital. Including these 16 as unwounded prisoners (because they were captured at this engagement but received their wounds in earlier ones), the total British casualties were 183 killed, wounded or deserted; 147 wounded prisoners and 129 unwounded prisoners; adding up to a loss of 459 men.

==Results==
The Americans had inflicted heavy casualties and captured a strongly fortified position with fewer losses to themselves. The victory can be credited to excellent planning and leadership by two comparatively junior officers: Scott and Perry.

When the Americans broke off the pursuit, Vincent continued his retreat to Beaver Dams, near present-day Thorold, Ontario, where he gathered in the other British regular detachments from Fort Erie and other posts higher up the Niagara, and temporarily disbanded the militia, before falling back to Burlington Heights near the western end of Lake Ontario.

When the British abandoned Fort Erie, Perry was able to move several armed schooners which had been blockaded in Black Rock into Lake Erie, and these were to be instrumental in his victory later in the year in the Battle of Lake Erie. However, the American army was slow to exploit the capture of Fort George by advancing up the Niagara peninsula, and they allowed Vincent to launch a surprise attack at the Battle of Stoney Creek, after which the Americans withdrew to Fort George. By concentrating their naval squadron against Fort George, the Americans had also left themselves vulnerable to a counter-attack on their base, and only indecisive command by Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost allowed the Americans to fight him off at the Battle of Sackett&#x27;s Harbor.

The Americans subsequently remained in a small defensive enclave around Fort George. After a disaster when a sortie against a British outpost was surrounded and forced to surrender by Native Americans at the Battle of Beaver Dams, they remained largely inactive on this front until they abandoned Fort George in December 1813.

Ten currently active regular battalions of the United States Army (2-1 ADA, 3-4 ADA, 4-1 FA, 1-2 Inf, 2-2 Inf, 1-4 Inf, 2-4 Inf, 3-4 Inf, 1-5 Inf and 2-5 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of a number of American units (Crane&#x27;s Company, 3rd Regiment of Artillery, Baker&#x27;s Company, 2nd Regiment of Artillery, Leonard&#x27;s Company, 1st Regiment of Artillery, and the old 6th, 13th, 14th, 20th, 21st, 22nd and 23rd Infantry Regiments) that were engaged at Fort George.

==Commemoration==

The battlefield site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1921. Nearby Fort George was similarly designated that same year.

<doc id="1330666" wikidata="Q13636438" url="?curid=1330666" title="Holotricha">
<text>Holotricha was an order of ciliates. The classification has fallen from use as a formal taxon, but the terms &quot;holotrich&quot; and &quot;holotrichous&quot; are still applied descriptively to organisms with cilia of uniform length distributed evenly over the surface of the body.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;holotrich&quot; derives from the ancient greek (), meaning &quot;whole, entire&quot;, and , (), meaning &#x27;hair&#x27;, because of the even distribution of cilia over the surface of the cell.

==Classification==
The order Holotricha was erected in 1859 by Friedrich Stein, who developed a system of classification in which ciliates were categorized according to the type and distribution of their cilia. The four major subdivisions of Stein&#x27;s Ciliata were: Heterotricha, Peritricha, Hypotricha and Holotricha. The latter was reserved for organisms with cilia covering the entire surface of the body. The order included five families, within which a very diverse collection of genera were grouped. Among the better-known ciliates in Stein&#x27;s Holotricha were &quot;Coleps&quot;, &quot;Nassula&quot;, &quot;Lacrymaria&quot;, &quot;Loxodes&quot;, &quot;Colpoda&quot;, &quot;Glaucoma&quot; and &quot;Paramecium&quot;.

Stein&#x27;s scheme was amended in 1889 by Otto Bütschli, who divided the Ciliata into two orders: Holotricha and Spirotricha. Bütschli&#x27;s Holotricha were described much as Stein&#x27;s had been, as ciliates with relatively uniform somatic cilia. The other three orders of Stein&#x27;s Ciliata were placed in a lower rank under the new order Spirotricha: ciliates possessing a well-developed structure of spiralling membranelles around the oral cavity.

Versions of Bütschli&#x27;s two-order scheme were used by taxonomists throughout the first half of the twentieth century, although many adjustments were made to the arrangement of families and genera within those groups. Meanwhile, improved laboratory methods and the advent of the electron microscope began to reveal inadequacies in the old scheme; and, as inconsistencies accumulated, dissatisfaction with the system grew. Nonetheless, Holotricha remained in use as a high-level taxon until 1974, when John Corliss proposed a complete revision of the phylum Ciliophora. In his system, Spirotricha is retained as an order, under the class Polyhymenophora, but Holotricha does not appear at any rank. Recent systems of classification, including an influential scheme proposed by Pierre de Puytorac in 1994, and Denis Lynn&#x27;s revision of 2002, make no mention of Holotricha.

<text>Permission, in philosophy, is the attribute of a person whose performance of a specific action, otherwise ethically wrong or dubious, would thereby involve no ethical fault. The term &quot;permission&quot; is more commonly used to refer to consent. Consent is the legal embodiment of the concept, in which approval is given to another party.

Permissions depend on norms or institutions.

Many permissions and obligations are complementary to each other, and deontic logic is a tool sometimes used in reasoning about such relationships.

<doc id="1330683" wikidata="Q1189184" url="?curid=1330683" title="Management of tuberculosis">
<text>Management of tuberculosis refers to techniques and procedures utilized for treating tuberculosis (TB), or simply a treatment plan for TB.

The medical standard for active TB is a short course treatment involving a combination of isoniazid, rifampicin (also known as Rifampin), pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first two months. During this initial period, Isoniazid is taken alongside pyridoxal phosphate to obviate peripheral neuropathy. Isoniazid is then taken concurrently with rifampicin for the remaining four months of treatment (6-8 months for miliary tuberculosis). A patient is expected to be free from all living TB bacteria after six months of therapy in Pulmonary TB or 8-10 months in Miliary TB.

Latent tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is treated with three to nine months of isoniazid alone. This long-term treatment often risks the development of hepatotoxicity. A combination of isoniazid plus rifampicin for a period of three to four months is shown to be an equally effective method for treating LTBI, while mitigating risks to hepatotoxicity. Treatment of LTBI is essential in preventing the spread of active TB.

==Drugs==

===First line===
All first-line anti-tuberculous drug names have semi-standardized three-letter and single-letter abbreviations:
* ethambutol is EMB or E
* isoniazid is INH or H
* pyrazinamide is PZA or Z
* rifampicin is RMP or R
* streptomycin is SM or S
* doxycycline

First-line anti-tuberculous drug names are often remembered with the mnemonic &quot;RIPE&quot;, referring to the use of rifamycin (like rifampin), isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. 

In US practice, names and abbreviations that are not universally accepted are used. For example, rifampicin is referred to as rifampin and is abbreviated as RIF, while streptomycin is referred to as STM. The notations RIF, RFP, and RMP have all been frequently used for rifampicin, and the notations IRPE, HRZE, RIPE, and IREP for combination regimens are all synonyms or nearly synonyms depending on dosage schedules. Other abbreviations have also been widely used).

In this system, which the World Health Organization (WHO) supports, &quot;RIPE&quot; is &quot;RHZE&quot;. (Both have mnemonic potential, as tuberculosis is named after tubercles (small tubers), and a tuber can be ripe and can be a rhizome.)

Drug regimens are similarly abbreviated in a semi standardized manner. The drugs are listed using their single letter abbreviations (in the order given above, which is roughly the order of introduction into clinical practice). A prefix denotes the number of months the treatment should be given for; a subscript denotes intermittent dosing (so 3 means three times a week) and no subscript means daily dosing. 

Most regimens have an initial &quot;high-intensity phase&quot;, followed by a &quot;continuation phase&quot; (also called a consolidation phase or eradication phase): the high-intensity phase is given first, then the continuation phase, the two phases divided by a slash.

So,
:2HREZ/4HR3
means isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide daily for two months, followed by four months of isoniazid and rifampicin given three times a week. Several studies have shown that the combination of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide has increase the risk of drug-induced liver injury.

In the US only, streptomycin is not considered a first line drug by ATS/IDSA/CDC because of high rates of resistance. WHO has made no such recommendation.

===Second line===
The second-line drugs (WHO groups 2, 3, and 4) are only used to treat disease that is resistant to first line therapy (i.e., for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)). A drug may be classified as second-line instead of first-line for one of three possible reasons: 1) it may be less effective than the first-line drugs (e.g., &quot;p&quot;-aminosalicylic acid), 2) it may have toxic side-effects (e.g., cycloserine), or 3) it may be effective, but unavailable in many developing countries (e.g., fluoroquinolones):
* aminoglycosides (WHO group 2): e.g., amikacin (AMK), kanamycin (KM)
* polypeptides (WHO group 2): e.g., capreomycin, viomycin, enviomycin
* fluoroquinolones (WHO group 3): e.g., ciprofloxacin (CIP), levofloxacin, moxifloxacin (MXF)
* thioamides (WHO group 4): e.g. ethionamide, prothionamide
* cycloserine (WHO group 4)
* terizidone (WHO group 5)

===Third line===

Third-line drugs (WHO group 5) include drugs that may be useful, but have doubtful or unproven efficacy:
* rifabutin
* macrolides: e.g., clarithromycin (CLR);
* linezolid (LZD);
* thioacetazone (T);
* thioridazine;
* arginine;
* vitamin D;
* bedaquiline.

These drugs are listed here either because they are not very effective (e.g., clarithromycin) or because their efficacy has not been proven (e.g., linezolid, R207910). Rifabutin is effective, but is not included on the WHO list because, for most developing countries, it is impractically expensive.

==Standard regimen==

===Rationale and evidence===
Tuberculosis has been treated with combination therapy for over fifty years. Treatments consisting of a single drug are not used (except in latent TB or chemoprophylaxis), and regimens that use only single drug result in the rapid development of resistance and treatment failure. The rationale for using multiple drugs to treat TB is based on simple probability. The rate of spontaneous mutations that confer resistance to an individual drug are well known: 1 mutation for every 107 cell divisions for EMB, 1 for every 108 divisions for STM and INH, and 1 for every 1010 divisions for RMP.

Patients with extensive pulmonary TB have approximately 1012 bacteria in their body, and therefore will likely be harboring approximately 105 EMB-resistant bacteria, 104 STM-resistant bacteria, 104 INH-resistant bacteria and 10² RMP-resistant bacteria. Resistance mutations appear spontaneously and independently, so the chances of them harbouring a bacterium that is spontaneously resistant to both INH and RMP is 1 in 108 × 1 in 1010=1 in 1018, and the chance of them harbouring a bacterium that is spontaneously resistant to all four drugs is 1 in 1033. This is, of course, an oversimplification, but it is a useful way of explaining combination therapy.

There are other theoretical reasons for supporting combination therapy. The different drugs in the regimen have different modes of action. INH are bactericidal against replicating bacteria. EMB is bacteriostatic at low doses, but is used in TB treatment at higher bactericidal doses. RMP is bacteriacidal and has a sterilizing effect. PZA is only weakly bactericidal, but is very effective against bacteria located in acidic environments, inside macrophages, or in areas of acute inflammation.

All TB regimens in use were 18 months or longer until the appearance of rifampicin. In 1953, the standard UK regimen was 3SPH/15PH or 3SPH/15SH2. Between 1965 and 1970, EMB replaced PAS. RMP began to be used to treat TB in 1968 and the BTS study in the 1970s showed that 2HRE/7HR was efficacious. In 1984, a BTS study showed that 2HRZ/4HR was efficacious, with a relapse rate of less than 3% after two years. In 1995, with the recognition that INH resistance was increasing, the British Thoracic Society recommended adding EMB or STM to the regimen: 2HREZ/4HR or 2SHRZ/4HR, which are the regimens currently recommended. The WHO also recommend a six-month continuation phase of HR if the patient is still culture-positive after 2 months of treatment (approximately 15% of patients with fully sensitive TB) and for those patients who have extensive bilateral cavitation at the start of treatment.

===Monitoring, DOTS, and DOTS-Plus===
DOTS stands for &quot;Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course&quot; and is a major plank in the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Plan to Stop TB. The DOTS strategy focuses on five main points of action. The first element involves creating increased sustainable financial services and a short- and long-term plan provided by the government, dedicated to eliminating tuberculosis. The WHO helps encourage mobilized funding to reduce poverty standards that will prevent tuberculosis. The second component of the DOTS strategy is case detection, which involves improving the accuracy of laboratory tests for bacteriology and improving communication from labs to doctors and patients. Case detection means that laboratories that detect and test for bacteriology are accurate and communicative to its doctors and patients. The third strategy is to provide standard treatment and patient support. The guidelines to adhere to adequate treatment is to provide pharmaceutical drugs that will help eliminate tuberculosis and follow-up check-ups to ensure that tuberculosis is not a deterring factor in a patient&#x27;s life. There are many cultural barriers as many patients might continue to work under unsanitary living conditions or not have enough money to pay for the treatments. Programs that provide stipends and incentives to allow citizens to seek treatment are also necessary. The fourth element to DOTS is to have a management program that supplies a sustainable long-term supply of reliable antibiotics. Lastly, the fifth component is to record and monitor treatment plans to ensure that the DOTS approach is effective. DOTS not only aims to provide structure for tuberculosis programs, but also to ensure that citizens diagnosed with tuberculosis adhere to protocols which will prevent future bacterial infections.

These include government commitment to control TB, diagnosis based on sputum-smear microscopy tests done on patients who actively report TB symptoms, direct observation short-course chemotherapy treatments, a definite supply of drugs, and standardized reporting and recording of cases and treatment outcomes. The WHO advises that all TB patients should have at least the first two months of their therapy observed (and preferably the whole of it observed): this means an independent observer watching patients swallow their anti-TB therapy. The independent observer is often not a healthcare worker and may be a shopkeeper or a tribal elder or similar senior person within that society. DOTS is used with intermittent dosing (thrice weekly or 2HREZ/4HR3). Twice weekly dosing is effective but not recommended by the WHO, because there is no margin for error (accidentally omitting one dose per week results in once weekly dosing, which is ineffective).

Treatment with properly implemented DOTS has a success rate exceeding 95% and prevents the emergence of further multi-drug resistant strains of tuberculosis. Administering DOTS, decreases the possibilities of tuberculosis from recurring, resulting in a reduction in unsuccessful treatments. This is in part due to the fact that areas without the DOTS strategy generally provide lower standards of care. Areas with DOTS administration help lower the number of patients seeking help from other facilities where they are treated with unknown treatments resulting in unknown outcomes. However, if the DOTS program is not implemented or done so incorrectly positive results will be unlikely. For the program to work efficiently and accurately health providers must be fully engaged, links must be built between public and private practitioners, health services must be available to all, and global support is provided to countries trying to reach their TB prevention, and treatment aims. Some researchers suggest that, because the DOTS framework has been so successful in the treatment of tuberculosis in sub-Saharan Africa, DOTS should be expanded to non-communicable diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and epilepsy.

===DOTS-Plus strategy===
The WHO extended the DOTS programme in 1998 to include the treatment of MDR-TB (called &quot;DOTS-Plus&quot;). Implementation of DOTS-Plus requires the capacity to perform drug-susceptibility testing (not routinely available even in developed countries) and the availability of second-line agents, in addition to all the requirements for DOTS. DOTS-Plus is therefore much more resource-expensive than DOTS, and requires much greater commitment from countries wishing to implement it. Community engagement is a new approach that is being initiated alongside the DOTS individualized treatment. By creating a community for health workers to give support to patients and hospital faculty, the DOTS-plus model also incorporates psychological structural support treatments to help accommodate patients to ensure completion of treatment. Treatment with the new strategy is a total duration of 18–24 months.

Monthly surveillance until cultures convert to negative is recommended for DOTS-Plus, but not for DOTS. If cultures are positive or symptoms do not resolve after three months of treatment, it is necessary to re-evaluate the patient for drug-resistant disease or nonadherence to drug regimen. If cultures do not convert to negative despite three months of therapy, some physicians may consider admitting the patient to hospital so as to closely monitor therapy.

===Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis===
Tuberculosis not affecting the lungs is called extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Disease of the central nervous system is specifically excluded from this classification.

The United Kingdom and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation is 2HREZ/4HR; the US recommendation is 2HREZ/7HR. There is good evidence from randomized controlled trials to say that in tuberculous lymphadenitis and in TB of the spine, the six-month regimen is equivalent to the nine-month regimen; the US recommendation is therefore not supported by the evidence.

Up to 25% of patients with TB of the lymph nodes (TB lymphadenitis) will get worse on treatment before they get better and this usually happens in the first few months of treatment. A few weeks after starting treatment, lymph nodes often start to enlarge, and previously solid lymph nodes may soften and develop into tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis. This should not be interpreted as failure of therapy and is a common reason for patients (and their physicians) to panic unnecessarily. With patience, two to three months into treatment the lymph nodes start to shrink again and re-aspiration or re-biopsy of the lymph nodes is unnecessary: if repeat microbiological studies are ordered, they will show the continued presence of viable bacteria with the same sensitivity pattern, which further adds to the confusion: physicians inexperienced in the treatment of TB will then often add second-line drugs in the belief that the treatment is not working. In these situations, all that is required is re-assurance. Steroids may be useful in resolving the swelling, especially if it is painful, but they are unnecessary. Additional antibiotics are unnecessary and the treatment regimen does not need to be lengthened.

There is no evidence that 6 months regimen is inadequate in treating abdominal TB and there is no additional benefits for 9-month regimen for preventing relapse.

However, more large scale studies are needed to confirm the above conclusion.

===Tuberculosis of the central nervous system===

Central nervous system tuberculosis takes two major forms: tuberculous meningitis and tuberculoma.

Tuberculosis may affect the central nervous system (meninges, brain, or spinal cord) in which case it is called TB meningitis, TB cerebritis, and TB myelitis respectively; the standard treatment is 12 months of drugs (2HREZ/10HR) and steroid are mandatory.

Diagnosis is difficult as CSF culture is positive in less than half of cases, and therefore a large proportion of cases are treated on the basis of clinical suspicion alone. PCR of CSF does not significantly improve the microbiology yield; culture remains the most sensitive method and a minimum of 5 mL (preferably 20 mL) of CSF should be sent for analysis. TB cerebritis (or TB of the brain) may require brain biopsy to make the diagnosis, because the CSF is commonly normal: this is not always available and even when it is, some clinicians would debate whether it is justified putting a patient through such an invasive and potentially dangerous procedure when a trial of anti-TB therapy may yield the same answer; probably the only justification for brain biopsy is when drug-resistant TB is suspected.

It is possible that shorter durations of therapy (e.g., six months) may be sufficient to treat TB meningitis, but no clinical trial has addressed this issue. The CSF of patients with treated TB meningitis is commonly abnormal even at 12 months; the rate of resolution of the abnormality bears no correlation with clinical progress or outcome, and is not an indication for extending or repeating treatment; repeated sampling of CSF by lumbar puncture to monitor treatment progress should therefore not be done.

Although TB meningitis and TB cerebritis are classified together, the experience of many clinicians is that their progression and response to treatment is not the same. TB meningitis usually responds well to treatment, but TB cerebritis may require prolonged treatment (up to two years) and the steroid course needed is often also prolonged (up to six months). Unlike TB meningitis, TB cerebritis often required repeated CT or MRI imaging of the brain to monitor progress.

Central nervous system TB may be secondary to blood-borne spread: therefore some experts advocate the routine sampling of CSF in patients with miliary TB.

The anti-TB drugs that are most useful for the treatment of Central nervous system TB are:
* INH (CSF penetration 100%)
* RMP (10–20%)
* EMB (25–50% inflamed meninges only)
* PZA (100%)
* STM (20% inflamed meninges only)
* LZD (20%)
* Cycloserine (80–100%)
* Ethionamide (100%)
* PAS (10–50%) (inflamed meninges only)

The use of steroids is routine in TB meningitis (see section below). There is evidence from one poorly designed trial that aspirin may be beneficial, but further work is required before this can be recommended routinely.

===Steroids===
The usefulness of corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone or dexamethasone) in the treatment of TB is proven for TB meningitis and TB pericarditis. The dose for TB meningitis is dexamethasone 8 to 12 mg daily tapered off over six weeks (for those who prefer more precise dosing should refer to Thwaites et al., 2004). The dose for pericarditis is prednisolone 60 mg daily tapered off over four to eight weeks.

Steroids may be of temporary benefit in pleurisy, extremely advanced TB, and TB in children:
* Pleurisy: prednisolone 20 to 40 mg daily tapered off over 4 to 8 weeks
* Extremely advanced TB: 40 to 60 mg daily tapered off over 4 to 8 weeks
* TB in children: 2 to 5 mg/kg/day for one week, 1 mg/kg/day the next week, then tapered off over 5 weeks

Steroids may be of benefit in peritonitis, miliary disease, tubercular osteomyelitis, TB osteomyelitis, laryngeal TB, lymphadenitis, and genitourinary disease, but the evidence is scant and the routine use of steroids cannot be recommended. Steroid treatment in these patients should be considered on a case-by-case basis by the attending physician. The long-term impact of pleural TB on respiratory function is unknown. Therefore, such impact should be quantified first before assessing the need of further clinical trials of corticosteroids with pleural TB.

Thalidomide may be of benefit in TB meningitis and has been used in cases where patients have failed to respond to steroid treatment.

==Non-compliance==
Patients who take their TB treatment in an irregular and unreliable way are at greatly increased risk of treatment failure, relapse, and the development of drug-resistant TB strains.

There are variety of reasons why patients fail to take their medication. The symptoms of TB commonly resolve within a few weeks of starting TB treatment and many patients then lose motivation to continue taking their medication. Regular follow-up is important to check on compliance and to identify any problems patients are having with their medication. Patients need to be told of the importance of taking their tablets regularly, and the importance of completing treatment, because of the risk of relapse or drug-resistance developing otherwise.

One of the main complaints is the bulkiness of the tablets. The main offender is PZA (the tablets being the size of horse tablets). PZA syrup may be offered as a substitute, or if the size of the tablets is truly an issue and liquid preparations are not available, then PZA can be omitted altogether. If PZA is omitted, the patient should be warned that this results in a significant increase in the duration of treatment (details of regimens omitting PZA are given below).

The other complaint is that the medicines must be taken on an empty stomach to facilitate absorption. This can be difficult for patients to follow (for example, shift workers who take their meals at irregular times) and may mean the patient waking up an hour earlier than usual everyday just to take medication. The rules are actually less stringent than many physicians and pharmacists realise: the issue is that the absorption of RMP is reduced if taken with fat, but is unaffected by carbohydrate, protein, or antacids. So the patient can in fact have his or her medication with food as long as the meal does not contain fat or oils (e.g., a cup of black coffee or toast with jam and no butter). Taking the medicines with food also helps ease the nausea that many patients feel when taking the medicines on an empty stomach. The effect of food on the absorption of INH is not clear: two studies have shown reduced absorption with food but one study showed no difference. There is a small effect of food on the absorption of PZA and of EMB that is probably not clinically important.

It is possible to test urine for isoniazid and rifampicin levels to check for compliance. The interpretation of urine analysis is based on the fact that isoniazid has a longer half-life than rifampicin:
* &quot;urine positive for isoniazid and rifampicin&quot; – patient probably fully compliant
* &quot;urine positive for isoniazid only&quot; – patient has taken his medication in the last few days preceding the clinic appointment, but had not yet taken a dose that day.
* &quot;urine positive for rifampicin only&quot; – patient has omitted to take his medication the preceding few days, but did take it just before coming to clinic.
* &quot;urine negative for both isoniazid and rifampicin&quot; – patient has not taken either medicine for a number of days

In countries where doctors are unable to compel patients to take their treatment (e.g., the UK), some say that urine testing only results in unhelpful confrontations with patients and does not help increase compliance. In countries where legal measures can be taken to force patients to take their medication (e.g., the US), then urine testing can be a useful adjunct in assuring compliance.

RMP colours the urine and all bodily secretions (tears, sweat, etc.) an orange-pink colour and this can be a useful proxy if urine testing is not available (although this colour fades approximately six to eight hours after each dose).

In study on cases of extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB), researchers at the University of the Philippines Manila found that similarity of symptoms of EPTB to other diseases results to delayed identification of the disease and late provision of medication. This, ultimately contribute to increasing rates of mortality and incidence rates of EPTB.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends prescription of fixed-dose combination drugs, to improve adherence to treatment by reducing the number of tablets that need to be taken by people, and also possibly reducing prescribing errors. A Cochrane review, published in 2016, found moderate quality evidence that &quot;there is probably little or no difference in fixed-dose combination drugs compared to single-drug formulations&quot;.

===Treatment adherence strategies===
As stated above, non-compliance to anti-tuberculin treatment can result in treatment failure or development of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Therefore, overall treatment strategies should be focused on promoting adherence. WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend a multi-faceted patient centered care approach. Public health and private sector practitioners can promote TB treatment adherence by allowing patients to be active partners in making their own treatment decisions; improving patient&#x27;s knowledge and understanding of tuberculosis disease, treatment, and potential spread; and by discussing expected interim and long-term outcomes with patients. CDC also recommends use of incentives and enablers. Incentives are monetary rewards for a healthy behavior (e.g.transport or food vouchers), while enablers function to remove economic burdens impeding healthcare access (e.g. grouping clinic visits, providing after hours clinic visits, or home visits). However, more research is needed to determine whether incentives and enablers have a significant effect on long-term treatment adherence for TB. Smartphones are considered to have potential to improve compliance.

Individuals with tuberculosis may also benefit from the emotional support of peers and survivors. Advocacy organizations and patient-support groups such as STOP TB, TB Alert, Treatment Action Group (TAG), and others work to connect TB survivors.

==Adverse effects==
For information on adverse effects of individual anti-TB drugs, please refer to the individual articles for each drug.

The relative incidence of major adverse effects has been carefully described:
* INH 0.49 per hundred patient months
* RMP 0.43
* EMB 0.07
* PZA 1.48
* All drugs 2.47
This works out to an 8.6% risk that any one patient will need to have his drug therapy changed during the course of standard short-course therapy (2HREZ/4HR). The people identified to be most at risk of major adverse side effects in this study were:
* age &gt;60,
* females,
* HIV positive patients, and
* Asians.

It can be extremely difficult identifying which drug is responsible for which side effect, but the relative frequency of each is known. The offending drugs are given in decreasing order of frequency:
* Thrombocytopenia: Rifampicin (RMP)
* Neuropathy: Isoniazid (INH)
* Vertigo: Streptomycin (STM)
* Hepatitis: Pyrazinamide (PZA), RMP, INH
* Rash: PZA, RMP, Ethambutol (EMB)

Thrombocytopenia is only caused by RMP and no test dosing need be done. Regimens omitting RMP are discussed below. Please refer to the entry on rifampicin for further details.

The most frequent cause of neuropathy is INH. The peripheral neuropathy of INH is always a pure sensory neuropathy and finding a motor component to the peripheral neuropathy should always prompt a search for an alternative cause. Once a peripheral neuropathy has occurred, INH must be stopped and pyridoxine should be given at a dose of 50 mg thrice daily. Simply adding high dose pyridoxine to the regimen once neuropathy has occurred will not stop the neuropathy from progressing. Patients at risk of peripheral neuropathy from other causes (diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, renal failure, malnutrition, pregnancy, etc.) should all be given pyridoxine 10 mg daily at the start of treatment. Please refer to the entry on isoniazid for details on other neurological side effects of INH.

Rashes are most frequently due to PZA, but can occur with any of the TB drugs. Test dosing using the same regimen as detailed below for hepatitis may be necessary to determine which drug is responsible.

Itching RMP commonly causes itching without a rash in the first two weeks of treatment: treatment should not be stopped and the patient should be advised that the itch usually resolves on its own. Short courses of sedative antihistamines such as chlorpheniramine may be useful in alleviating the itch.

Fever during treatment can be due to a number of causes. It can occur as a natural effect of tuberculosis (in which case it should resolve within three weeks of starting treatment). Fever can be a result of drug resistance (but in that case the organism must be resistant to two or more of the drugs). Fever may be due to a superadded infection or additional diagnosis (patients with TB are not exempt from getting influenza and other illnesses during the course of treatment). In a few patients, the fever is due to drug allergy. The clinician must also consider the possibility that the diagnosis of TB is wrong. If the patient has been on treatment for more than two weeks and if the fever had initially settled and then come back, it is reasonable to stop all TB medication for 72 hours. If the fever persists despite stopping all TB medication, then the fever is not due to the drugs. If the fever disappears off treatment, then the drugs need to be tested individually to determine the cause. The same scheme as is used for test dosing for drug-induced hepatitis (described below) may be used. The drug most frequently implicated as causing a drug fever is RMP: details are given in the entry on rifampicin.

===Drug-induced hepatitis===
Drug-induced hepatitis, from TB treatment, has a mortality rate of around 5%.
Three drugs can induce hepatitis: PZA, INH, and RMP (in decreasing order of frequency). It is not possible to distinguish between these three causes based purely on signs and symptoms. Test dosing must be carried out to determine which drug is responsible (this is discussed in detail below).

Liver function tests (LFTs) should be checked at the start of treatment, but, if normal, need not be checked again; the patient need only be warned of the symptoms of hepatitis. Some clinicians insist on regular monitoring of LFT&#x27;s while on treatment, and in this instance, tests need only be done two weeks after starting treatment and then every two months thereafter, unless any problems are detected.

Elevations in bilirubin must be expected with RMP treatment (RMP blocks bilirubin excretion) and usually resolve after 10 days (liver enzyme production increases to compensate). Isolated elevations in bilirubin can be safely ignored.

Elevations in liver transaminases (ALT and AST) are common in the first three weeks of treatment. If the patient is asymptomatic and the elevation is not excessive then no action need be taken; some experts suggest a cut-off of four times the upper limit of normal, but there is no evidence to support this particular number over and above any other number. Some experts consider that treatment should only be stopped if jaundice becomes clinically evident.

If clinically significant hepatitis occurs while on TB treatment, then all the drugs should be stopped until the liver transaminases return to normal. If the patient is so ill that TB treatment cannot be stopped, then STM and EMB should be given until the liver transaminases return to normal (these two drugs are not associated with hepatitis).

Fulminant hepatitis can occur in the course of TB treatment, but is fortunately rare; emergency liver transplantation may be necessary and deaths do occur.

===Test dosing for drug-induced hepatitis===
Drugs should be re-introduced individually. This cannot be done in an outpatient setting, and must be done under close observation. A nurse must be present to take patient&#x27;s pulse and blood pressure at 15-minute intervals for a minimum of four hours after each test dose is given (most problems will occur within six hours of test dosing, if they are going to occur at all). Patients can become very suddenly unwell and access to intensive care facilities must be available. The drugs should be given in this order:
* Day 1: INH at 1/3 or 1/4 dose
* Day 2: INH at 1/2 dose
* Day 3: INH at full dose
* Day 4: RMP at 1/3 or 1/4 dose
* Day 5: RMP at 1/2 dose
* Day 6: RMP at full dose
* Day 7: EMB at 1/3 or 1/4 dose
* Day 8: EMB at 1/2 dose
* Day 9: EMB at full dose
No more than one test dose per day should be given, and all other drugs should be stopped while test dosing is being done. So on day 4, for example, the patient only receives RMP and no other drugs are given. If the patient completes the nine days of test dosing, then it is reasonable to assume that PZA has caused the hepatitis and no PZA test dosing need be done.

The reason for using the order for testing drugs is because the two most important drugs for treating TB are INH and RMP, so these are tested first: PZA is the most likely drug to cause hepatitis and is also the drug that can be most easily omitted. EMB is useful when the sensitivity pattern of the TB organism are not known and can be omitted if the organism is known to be sensitive to INH. Regimens omitting each of the standard drugs are listed below.

The order in which the drugs are tested can be varied according to the following considerations:
# The most useful drugs (INH and RMP) should be tested first, because the absence of these drugs from a treatment regimen severely impairs its efficacy.
# The drugs most likely to be causing the reaction should be tested as late as possible (and possibly need not be tested at all). This avoids rechallenging patients with a drug to which they have already had a (possibly) dangerous adverse reaction.

A similar scheme may be used for other adverse effects (such as fever and rash), using similar principles.

===Dysbiosis caused by HRZE antibiotic treatment===

Tuberculosis treatment results in changes to the structure of the gut microbiome both during and after treatment in mice and humans. It is currently unknown what the long term effects of this dysbiosis are on systemic immunity.

==Deviations from the standard regimen==
There is evidence supporting some deviations from the standard regimen when treating pulmonary TB. Sputum culture-positive patients who are smear-negative at the start of treatment do well with only four months of treatment (this has not been validated for HIV-positive patients); sputum culture-negative patients do well on only three months of treatment (possibly because some of these patients never had TB at all). It is unwise to treat patients for only three or four months, but all TB physicians will have patients who stop their treatment early (for whatever reason), and it can be reassuring to know that sometimes retreatment is unnecessary. Elderly patients who are already taking a large number of tablets may be offered 9HR, omitting PZA which is the bulkiest part of the regimen.

It may not always be necessary to treat with four drugs from the beginning. An example might be a close contact of a patient known to have a fully sensitive strain of tuberculosis: in this case, it is acceptable to use 2HRZ/4HR (omitting EMB and STM) in the expectation that their strain will be INH susceptible also. Indeed, this was previously the recommended standard regimen in many countries until the early 1990s, when isoniazid-resistance rates increased.

TB involving the brain or spinal cord (meningitis, encephalitis, etc.) is currently treated with 2HREZ/10HR (12 months of treatment in total), but there is no evidence to say that this is superior to 2HREZ/4HR. There is no difference in relapse rates amongst those who are treated with 6 months or longer period of time. However, more well-designed studies are needed to answer this question.

===Regimens omitting isoniazid===
Isoniazid resistance accounts 6.9% of isolates in the UK (2010). Worldwide, it is the most common type of resistance encountered, hence the current recommendation of using HREZ at the beginning of treatment until sensitivities are known. It is useful to know of current reported outbreaks (like the current outbreak of INH-resistant TB in London).

If patients are discovered to be infected with an isoniazid-resistant strain of TB having completed 2 months of HREZ, then they should be changed to RE for a further 10 months, and the same thing if the patient is intolerant to isoniazid (although 2REZ/7RE may be acceptable if the patient is well supervised). The US recommendation is 6RZE with the option of adding a quinolone such as moxifloxacin. The level of evidence for all these regimens is poor, and there is little to recommend one over the other.

===Regimens omitting rifampicin===
The UK prevalence of rifampicin (RMP) resistance is 1.4%. It is rare for TB strains to be resistant to RMP without also being resistant to INH, which means that rifampicin-resistance usually means resistance to INH as well (that is, MDR-TB). However, RMP intolerance is not uncommon (hepatitis or thrombocytopaenia being the most common reasons for stopping rifampicin). Of the first-line drugs, rifampicin is also the most expensive, and in the poorest countries, regimens omitting rifampicin are therefore often used. Rifampicin is the most potent sterilising drug available for the treatment of tuberculosis and all treatment regimens that omit rifampicin are significantly longer than the standard regimen.

The UK recommendation is 18HE or 12HEZ. The US recommendation is 9 to 12HEZ, with the option of adding a quinolone (for example, MXF).

===Regimens omitting pyrazinamide===
PZA is a common cause of rash, hepatitis, and of painful arthralgia in the HREZ regimen, and can be safely stopped in those patients who are intolerant to it. Isolated PZA resistance is uncommon in &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, but &quot;M. bovis&quot; is innately resistant to PZA. PZA is not crucial to the treatment of fully sensitive TB, and its main value is in shortening the total treatment duration from nine months to six.

An alternative regimen is 2HRE/7HR, for which there is excellent clinical trial evidence. The 1994 US CDC guidelines for tuberculosis erroneously cite Slutkin as evidence that a nine-month regimen using only isoniazid and rifampicin is acceptable, but almost all of the patients in that study received ethambutol for the first two to three months (although this is not obvious from the abstract of that article). This mistake was rectified in the 2003 guidelines.

This regimen (2HRE/7HR) is the first-line regimen used to treat &quot;M. bovis&quot;, since &quot;M. bovis&quot; is intrinsically resistant to pyrazinamide.

===Regimens omitting ethambutol===
EMB intolerance or resistance is rare. If a patient is truly intolerant or is infected with TB that is resistant to EMB, then 2HRZ/4HR is an acceptable regimen. The main motivator for including EMB in the initial two months is because of increasing rates of INH resistance.

==Tuberculosis and other conditions==

===Liver disease===
People with alcoholic liver disease are at an increased risk of tuberculosis. The incidence of tuberculous peritonitis is particularly high in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.

There are broadly two categories of treatment: A) Cirrhotic patients with essentially normal baseline liver function tests (Childs A Cirrhosis). Such patients may be treated with standard 4 drug regime for 2 months followed by 2 drugs for remaining 4 months (total 6-month treatment). B) Cirrhotic patients altered baseline liver function tests (Childs B &amp; C). According to 2010 WHO guidelines: depending on the severity of the disease and degree of decompensation, the following regimen can be used, by altering the number of hepatotoxic drugs. One or two hepatotoxic drugs may be used in moderately severe disease (e.g., Childs B cirrhosis) whereas hepatotoxic drugs are completely avoided in decompensated Child C cirrhosis. • Two hepatotoxic drugs – 9 months of Isoniazid, Rifampin, and Ethambutol (until or unless isoniazid susceptibility is documented)
– 2 months of Isoniazid, Rifampin, Ethambutol, and Streptomycin followed by 6 months of Isoniazid and Rifampin
• One hepatotoxic drug
– 2 months of Isoniazid, Ethambutol &amp; Streptomycin followed by 10 months of Isoniazid and Ethambutol • No hepatotoxic drugs – 18–24 months of Streptomycin, Ethambutol, and quinolones. Patients with liver disease should have their liver function tests monitored regularly throughout TB treatment.

===Pregnancy===
Pregnancy itself is not a risk factor for TB.

Rifampicin makes hormonal contraception less effective, so additional precautions need to be taken for birth control while tuberculosis treatment.

Untreated TB in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and major fetal abnormality, and treatment of pregnant women. The US guidelines recommend omitting PZA when treating TB in pregnancy; the UK and WHO guidelines make no such recommendation, and PZA is commonly used in pregnancy. There is extensive experience with the treatment of pregnant women with TB and no toxic effect of PZA in pregnancy has ever been found. High doses of RMP (much higher than used in humans) causes neural tube defects in animals, but no such effect has ever been found in humans. There may be an increased risk of hepatitis in pregnancy and during the puerperium. It is prudent to advise all women of child-bearing age to avoid getting pregnant until TB treatment is completed.

Aminoglycosides (STM, capreomycin, amikacin) should be used with caution in pregnancy, because they may cause deafness in the unborn child. The attending physician must weigh the benefits of treating the mother against the potential harm to the baby, and good outcomes have been reported in children whose mothers were treated with aminoglycosides. Experience in Peru shows that treatment for MDR-TB is not a reason to recommend termination of pregnancy, and that good outcomes are possible.

===Kidney disease===
People with kidney failure have a 10 to 30-fold increase in risk of getting TB. People with kidney disease who are being given immunosuppressive medications or are being considered for transplant should be considered for treatment of latent tuberculosis if appropriate.

Aminoglycosides (STM, capreomycin, and amikacin) should be avoided in patients with mild to severe kidney problems because of the increased risk of damage to the kidneys. If the use of aminoglycosides cannot be avoided (e.g., in treating drug-resistant TB) then serum levels must be closely monitored and the patient warned to report any side-effects (deafness in particular). If a person has end-stage kidney disease and has no useful remaining kidney function, then aminoglycosides can be used, but only if drug levels can be easily measured (often only amikacin levels can be measured).

In mild kidney impairment, no change needs to be made in dosing any of the other drugs routinely used in the treatment of TB. In severe chronic kidney disease (GFR&lt;30), the EMB dose should be halved (or avoided altogether). The PZA dose is 20&quot; &quot;mg/kg/day (UK recommendation) or three-quarters the normal dose (US recommendation), but not much published evidence is available to support this.

When using 2HRZ/4HR in patients on dialysis, the drugs should be given daily during the initial high-intensity phase. In the continuation phase, the drugs should be given at the end of each haemodialysis session and no dose should be taken on non-dialysis days.

===HIV===
In patients with HIV, treatment for the HIV should be delayed until TB treatment is completed, if possible.

The current UK guidance (provided by the British HIV Association) is
* CD4 count over 200—delay treatment until the six months of TB treatment are complete.
* CD4 count 100 to 200—delay treatment until the initial two-month intensive phase of therapy is complete
* CD4 count less than 100—the situation is unclear and patients should be enrolled in clinical trials examining this question. There is evidence that if these patients are managed by a specialist in both TB and HIV then outcomes are not compromised for either disease.

If HIV treatment has to be started while a patient is still on TB treatment, then the advice of a specialist HIV pharmacist should be sought. In general, there is no significant interactions with the NRTI&#x27;s. Nevirapine should not be used with rifampicin. Efavirenz may be used, but dose used depends on the patient&#x27;s weight (600 mg daily if weight less than 50 kg; 800 mg daily if weight greater than 50 kg). Efavirenz levels should be checked early after starting treatment (unfortunately, this is not a service routinely offered in the US, but is readily available in the UK). The protease inhibitors should be avoided if at all possible: patients on rifamycins and protease inhibitors have an increased risk of treatment failure or relapse.

The World Health Organization (WHO) warns against using thioacetazone in patients with HIV, because of the 23% risk of potentially fatal exfoliative dermatitis.

According to Caprisa 003 (SAPiT) Study the mortality in patients who were started on anti-retrovirals during TB treatment was 56% lower than those started after TB treatment was completed (hazard ratio 0.44 (95% CI: 0.25 to 0.79); p=0.003).

===Epilepsy===
INH may be associated with an increased risk of seizures. Pyridoxine 10&quot; &quot;mg daily should be given to all epileptics taking INH. There is no evidence that INH causes seizures in patients who are not epileptic.

TB treatment involves numerous drug interactions with anti-epileptic drugs and serum drug levels should be closely monitored. There are serious interactions between rifampicin and carbamazepine, rifampicin and phenytoin, and rifampicin and sodium valproate. The advice of a pharmacist should always be sought.

===Covid-19===
TB and COVID-19 are a &quot;cursed duet&quot; and need immediate attention. TB should be considered a risk factor for severe COVID disease and patients with TB should be prioritised for COVID-19 preventative efforts, including vaccination.

==Drug-resistance==
===Definitions===
Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is defined as TB that is resistant at least to INH and RMP. Isolates that are multi-resistant to any other combination of anti-TB drugs but not to INH and RMP are not classed as MDR-TB.

As of October 2006, &quot;Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis&quot; (XDR-TB) is defined as MDR-TB that is resistant to quinolones and also to any one of kanamycin, capreomycin, or amikacin. The old case definition of XDR-TB is MDR-TB that is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs. This definition should no longer be used, but is included here because many older publications refer to it.

The principles of treatment for MDR-TB and for XDR-TB are the same. The main difference is that XDR-TB is associated with a much higher mortality rate than MDR-TB, because of a reduced number of effective treatment options. The epidemiology of XDR-TB is currently not well studied, but it is believed that XDR-TB does not transmit easily in healthy populations, but is capable of causing epidemics in populations which are already stricken by HIV and therefore more susceptible to TB infection.

===Epidemiology of drug-resistant TB===

A 1997 survey of 35 countries found rates above 2% in about a third of the countries surveyed. The highest rates of drug-resistant TB were in the former USSR, the Baltic states, Argentina, India, and China, and was associated with poor or failing national Tuberculosis Control programmes. Likewise, the appearance of high rates of MDR-TB in New York city the early 1990s was associated with the dismantling of public health programmes by the Reagan administration.

Paul Farmer points out that the more expensive a treatment, the harder it is for poor countries to get. Farmer sees this as verging on denial of basic human rights. Africa is low in quality of treatment partly because many African cultures lack the &#x27;concept of time&#x27; essential to the schedule of administration.

MDR-TB can develop in the course of the treatment of fully sensitive TB and this is always the result of patients missing doses or failing to complete a course of treatment.

Thankfully, MDR-TB strains appear to be less fit and less transmissible. It has been known of many years that INH-resistant TB is less virulent in guinea pigs, and the epidemiological evidence is that MDR strains of TB do not dominate naturally. A study in Los Angeles found that only 6% of cases of MDR-TB were clustered. This should not be a cause for complacency: it must be remembered that MDR-TB has a mortality rate comparable to lung cancer. It must also be remembered that people who have weakened immune systems (because of diseases such as HIV or because of drugs) are more susceptible to catching TB.

Children represent a susceptible population with increasing rates of MDR and XDR-TB. Since diagnosis in pediatric patients is difficult, large number of cases are not properly reported. Cases of pediatric XDR-TB have been reported in most countries including the United States.

In 2006 an outbreak of XDR-TB South Africa was first reported as a cluster of 53 patients in a rural hospital in KwaZulu-Natal, with all but one dying. The mean survival from sputum specimen collection to death was only 16 days and that the majority of patients had never previously received treatment for tuberculosis. This is the epidemic for which the acronym XDR-TB was first used, although TB strains that fulfil the current definition have been identified retrospectively, this was the largest group of linked cases ever found. Since the initial report in September 2006, cases have now been reported in most provinces in South Africa. As of 16 March 2007, there were 314 cases reported, with 215 deaths. It is clear that the spread of this strain of TB is closely associated with a high prevalence of HIV and poor infection control; in other countries where XDR-TB strains have arisen, drug-resistance has arisen from mismanagement of cases or poor patient compliance with drug treatment instead of being transmitted from person to person. This strain of TB does not respond to any of the drugs currently available in South Africa for first- or second-line treatment. It is now clear that the problem has been around for much longer than health department officials have suggested, and is far more extensive. By 23 November 2006, 303 cases of XDR-TB had been reported, of which 263 were in KwaZulu-Natal. Serious thought has been put to isolation procedures that may deny some patients their human rights, but which may be necessary to prevent further spread of this strain of TB.

===Treatment of MDR-TB===
The treatment and prognosis of MDR-TB are much more akin to that for cancer than to that for infection. It has a mortality rate of up to 80%, which depends on a number of factors, including
# How many drugs the organism is resistant to (the fewer the better),
# How many drugs the patient is given (patients treated with five or more drugs do better),
# Whether an injectable drug is given or not (it should be given for the first three months at least),
# The expertise and experience of the physician responsible,
# How co-operative the patient is with treatment (treatment is arduous and long, and requires persistence and determination on the part of the patient),
# Whether the patient is HIV positive or not (HIV co-infection is associated with an increased mortality).

Treatment courses are a minimum of 18 months and may last years; it may require surgery, though death rates remain high despite optimal treatment. That said, good outcomes are still possible. Treatment courses that are at least 18 months long and which have a directly observed component can increase cure rates to 69%.

The treatment of MDR-TB must be undertaken by a physician experienced in the treatment of MDR-TB. Mortality and morbidity in patients treated in non-specialist centres is significantly elevated compared to those patients treated in specialist centres.

In addition to the obvious risks (e.g., known exposure to a patient with MDR-TB), risk factors for MDR-TB include male sex, HIV infection, previous incarceration, failed TB treatment, failure to respond to standard TB treatment, and relapse following standard TB treatment.

A large proportion of people with MDR-TB are unable to access treatment due to what Paul Farmer describes as an &quot;Outcome Gap&quot;. The majority of people struck with MDR-TB live in &quot;resource-poor settings&quot; and are denied treatment because international organizations have refused to make technologies available to countries who cannot afford to pay for treatment, the reason being that second line drugs are too expensive therefore treatment methods for MDR-TB are not sustainable in impoverished nations. Farmer argues that this is social injustice and we cannot allow people to die simply because they are faced with circumstances where they cannot afford &quot;effective therapy&quot;.

Treatment of MDR-TB must be done on the basis of sensitivity testing: it is impossible to treat such patients without this information. If treating a patient with suspected MDR-TB, the patient should be started on SHREZ+MXF+cycloserine pending the result of laboratory sensitivity testing.

A gene probe for &quot;rpoB&quot; is available in some countries and this serves as a useful marker for MDR-TB, because isolated RMP resistance is rare (except when patients have a history of being treated with rifampicin alone). If the results of a gene probe (&quot;rpoB&quot;) are known to be positive, then it is reasonable to omit RMP and to use SHEZ+MXF+cycloserine. The reason for maintaining the patient on INH despite the suspicion of MDR-TB is that INH is so potent in treating TB that it is foolish to omit it until there is microbiological proof that it is ineffective.

There are also probes available for isoniazid-resistance (&quot;katG&quot; and &quot;mabA-inhA&quot;), but these are less widely available.

When sensitivities are known and the isolate is confirmed as resistant to both INH and RMP, five drugs should be chosen in the following order (based on known sensitivities):
* an aminoglycoside (e.g., amikacin, kanamycin) or polypeptide antibiotic (e.g., capreomycin)
* PZA
* EMB
* a fluoroquinolones: moxifloxacin is preferred (ciprofloxacin should no longer be used;
* rifabutin
* cycloserine
* a thioamide: prothionamide or ethionamide
* PAS
* a macrolide: e.g., clarithromycin
* linezolid
* high-dose INH (if low-level resistance)
* interferon-γ
* thioridazine
* meropenem and clavulanic acid

Drugs are placed nearer the top of the list because they are more effective and less toxic; drugs are placed nearer the bottom of the list because they are less effective or more toxic, or more difficult to obtain.

Resistance to one drug within a class generally means resistance to all drugs within that class, but a notable exception is rifabutin: rifampicin-resistance does not always mean rifabutin-resistance and the laboratory should be asked to test for it. It is only possible to use one drug within each drug class. If it is difficult finding five drugs to treat then the clinician can request that high level INH-resistance be looked for. If the strain has only low level INH-resistance (resistance at 0.2&quot; &quot;mg/L INH, but sensitive at 1.0 mg/L INH), then high dose INH can be used as part of the regimen. When counting drugs, PZA and interferon count as zero; that is to say, when adding PZA to a four drug regimen, you must still choose another drug to make five. It is not possible to use more than one injectable (STM, capreomycin, or amikacin), because the toxic effect of these drugs is additive: if possible, the aminoglycoside should be given daily for a minimum of three months (and perhaps thrice weekly thereafter). Ciprofloxacin should not be used in the treatment of tuberculosis if other fluoroquinolones are available.

There is no intermittent regimen validated for use in MDR-TB, but clinical experience is that giving injectable drugs for five days a week (because there is no-one available to give the drug at weekends) does not seem to result in inferior results. Directly observed therapy certainly helps to improve outcomes in MDR-TB and should be considered an integral part of the treatment of MDR-TB.

Response to treatment must be obtained by repeated sputum cultures (monthly if possible). Treatment for MDR-TB must be given for a minimum of 18 months and cannot be stopped until the patient has been culture-negative for a minimum of nine months. It is not unusual for patients with MDR-TB to be on treatment for two years or more.

Patients with MDR-TB should be isolated in negative-pressure rooms, if possible. Patients with MDR-TB should not be accommodated on the same ward as immunosuppressed patients (HIV infected patients, or patients on immunosuppressive drugs). Careful monitoring of compliance with treatment is crucial to the management of MDR-TB (and some physicians insist on hospitalisation if only for this reason). Some physicians will insist that these patients are isolated until their sputum is smear negative, or even culture negative (which may take many months, or even years). Keeping these patients in hospital for weeks (or months) on end may be a practical or physical impossibility and the final decision depends on the clinical judgement of the physician treating that patient. The attending physician should make full use of therapeutic drug monitoring (particularly of the aminoglycosides) both to monitor compliance and to avoid toxic effects.

Some supplements may be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of tuberculosis, but for the purposes of counting drugs for MDR-TB, they count as zero (if you already have four drugs in the regimen, it may be beneficial to add arginine, vitamin D, or both, but you still need another drug to make five).
* arginine, some clinical evidence (peanuts are a good source)
* Vitamin D (some in-vitro evidence; see Vitamin D and tuberculosis treatment)

The drugs listed below have been used in desperation and it is uncertain whether they are effective at all. They are used when it is not possible to find five drugs from the list above.
* imipenem
* co-amoxiclav
* clofazimine
* prochlorperazine
* metronidazole

On 28 December 2012 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved bedaquiline (marketed as Sirturo by Johnson &amp; Johnson) to treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, the first new treatment in 40 years. Sirturo is to be used in a combination therapy for patients who have failed standard treatment and have no other options. Sirturo is an adenosine triphosphate synthase (ATP synthase) inhibitor.

The follow drug is experimental compounds that are not commercially available, but which may be obtained from the manufacturer as part of a clinical trial or on a compassionate basis. Their efficacy and safety are unknown:
* Pretomanid (manufactured by Novartis, developed in partnership with TB Alliance)

There is increasing evidence for the role of surgery (lobectomy or pneumonectomy) in the treatment of MDR-TB, although whether this is should be performed early or late is not yet clearly defined.
:&quot;See&quot; Modern surgical management

==Management in Asia==
The Asia‐Pacific region carries 58% of the global tuberculosis burden, which includes multi drug-resistant tuberculosis. Southeast Asia has high burdens of tuberculosis as a result of inefficient and inadequate health infrastructures. According to the World Health Organization, many Asian countries have high cases of tuberculosis, but their governments will not invest in new technology to treat its patients.

===Philippines===
From 2005 to 2009, the IPHO-Maguindanao, a governmental organization in Maguindanao, Philippines, partnered with the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) to increase tuberculosis awareness. CRS implemented a USAID-assisted project to fund tuberculosis testing. Additionally, they launched an &quot;Advocacy, Communication, and Self-Mobilization&quot; project featuring workshops to encourage testing in communities. Citizens attending religious sermons were able to distribute information about tuberculosis and inform their communities on where to seek treatment and how to adhere to treatment protocols The DOTS-Plus strategy, designed to deliver from within familiar local institutions, was successful at conveying information about tuberculosis prevention and treatment.

=== India ===
In 1906, India opened its first air sanatorium for treatment and isolation of TB patients.However, the World Health Organization (WHO) reviewed the national program in India which lacked funding and treatment regimens that could report accurate tuberculosis case management. By 1945, there were successful immunization screenings due to campaigns that helped spread messages about the prevention of disease. This was also around the same time that the WHO declared tuberculosis to be a global emergency and recommended countries adopt the DOTS strategy.

=== Bangladesh, Cambodia, Thailand ===
In Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Indonesia, there is a diagnostic treatment for latent tuberculosis in children below five years of age. The IGRA approach (Interferon Gamma Release Assay) is used in these countries. IGRA testing and diagnosis are whole blood cell tests where fresh blood samples are mixed with antigens and controls. A person infected with tuberculosis will have interferon-gammas in the blood stream when mixed with the antigen. It is a highly accurate but expensive test and is technologically complex for immuno-compromised patients. These developing countries were unable to get rid of tuberculosis effectively because the national health policies did not cover screening and testing for tuberculosis. There were also no programs in place to educate citizens and provide training for healthcare workers. Without the mobilization of sufficient resources and the backing of  sustainable government funding, these developing countries failed to adequately provide the treatment and resources necessary to combat tuberculosis.

===Vietnam===
According to the WHO, Vietnam ranks 13th on the list of 22 countries with the highest tuberculosis burden in the world. Nearly 400 new cases of TB and 55 deaths occur each day in Vietnam. In 1989, the Ministry of Health in Vietnam addressed the tuberculosis burden by establishing the National Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases and implemented the DOTS strategy as a national priority. Vietnam&#x27;s health service system consists of four different levels: the central level headed by the Ministry of Health (MOH), provincial health services, district health services, and commune health centers&quot;. These departments worked with the National Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases to ensure that there were treatment and prevention plans for long-term reduction of tuberculosis. In 2002, Vietnam also implemented a communication plan to provide accurate educational information to respond to any barriers or misperceptions about tuberculosis treatment. The government worked with the WHO, Center for Disease and Control Prevention, and local medical non-profits such as Friends for International Tuberculosis Relief to provide information about the causes of TB, sources of infection, how it is transmitted, symptoms, treatment, and prevention. The National Tuberculosis Control Program works closely with the primary health care system at the central, provincial, district, and commune levels which has proven to be an incredibly imperative measure of success.

==&quot;Tuberculosis non-profits in Asia&quot;==

Friends for International TB Relief is a small non-governmental organization whose mission is to help prevent tuberculosis and the spreading of TB. FIT not only diagnoses patients, but also provides preventative tuberculosis detection to pilot a comprehensive patient-centered TB program that aims to stop TB transmission and reduce suffering. The organization focuses on island screening due to the high level of risk and burden the population faces. Through its method of search, treat, prevent, and integrative sustainability, FIT is working closely with most of the population on the island (roughly 2022 patients), and partnered with the Ho Chi Minh City Public Health Association on a pilot that provides active community outreach, patient-centric care and stakeholder engagement.

Located in Ha Noi, the National Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases is responsible for the direction and management of TB control activities at the central level. The institute supports the MOH in developing TB- related strategies, and in handling management and professional guidelines for the system. The provincial level centers diagnose, treat, and manage patients, implement TB policies issued by the NTP, and develop action plans under the guidelines of the Provincial Health Bureau and the provincial TB control committees. The districts are capable of detecting TB and treating patients. All districts have physicians specializing in TB, laboratories, and X-ray equipment and have either a TB department or a TB-communicable diseases department in the district hospital. The district level is also responsible for implementing and monitoring the NTP, and the supervision and management of TB programs in the communes. The commune level provides treatment as prescribed by the district level, administering drugs, and vaccinating children. In TB control, village health workers play critically important roles in identifying suspected TB patients, conducting counseling for examination and tests, paying home visits to patients undergoing treatment, and reporting problems in monthly meetings with the CHC.

TB Alliance is a non-governmental organization that is located in South Africa and was discovered in the early 2000s. The NGO is a leading non-profit for global tuberculosis research and development of new TB vaccines. To advance TB development, TB Alliance creates partnerships with private, public, academic, and philanthropic sectors to develop products in underserved communities. In 2019, TB Alliance became the first not-for-profit organization to develop and register an anti-TB drug. TB Alliance also works closely alongside the World Health Organization (WHO), U.S FDA, and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) to endorse regulative policies and treatments that are affordable.

FHI 360 is an international tuberculosis non-profit organization funded by USAID to treat and support patients in Myanmar, China, and Thailand. The organization developed an app called DOTsync for healthcare staff to administer antibiotics and monitor the side effects of patients. This is incredibly imperative to eliminating tuberculosis because it allows healthcare workers to have follow-up checkups with patients to ensure that tuberculosis treatments are effective.

Operation ASHA is a TB nonprofit organization that was founded in 2006. Located in India and Cambodia, Operation ASHA focuses on the development of &quot;e-Compliance&quot;, which is a verification and SMS text messaging system where patients can use their fingerprints to access their medical records and be reminded daily via text when to take their medication. According to Operation ASHA, the e-Compliance treatment successive rate is 85%.

==Treatment failure==
Patients who fail treatment must be distinguished from patients who relapse. Patients who responded to treatment and appeared to be cured after completing a course of TB treatment are not classed as treatment failures, but as relapses and are discussed in a separate section below.

Patients are said to have failed treatment if they
# fail to respond to treatment (cough and sputum production persisting throughout the whole of treatment), or
# only experience a transient response to treatment (the patient gets better at first, but then get worse again, all the while on treatment).

It is very uncommon for patients not to respond to TB treatment at all (even transiently), because this implies resistance at base-line to all of the drugs in the regimen. Patients who fail to get any response at all while on treatment should first of all be questioned very closely about whether or not they have been taking their medicines, and perhaps even be admitted to hospital to be observed taking their treatment. Blood or urine samples may be taken to check for malabsorption of TB drugs. If it can be shown that they are fully compliant with their medication, then the probability that they have another diagnosis (perhaps in addition to the diagnosis of TB) is very high. These patients should have their diagnosis carefully reviewed and specimens obtained for TB culture and sensitivity testing. Patients who get better and then get worse again should likewise be questioned very closely about adherence to treatment. If adherence is confirmed then they should be investigated for resistant TB (including MDR-TB), even if a specimen has already been obtained for microbiology before commencing treatment.

Prescription or dispensing errors will account for a proportion of patients who fail to respond to treatment. Immune defects are a rare cause of non-response. In a tiny proportion of patients, treatment failure is a reflection of extreme biological variation and no cause is found.

==Treatment relapse==
Patients are said to relapse if they improve while on treatment, but become ill again after stopping treatment. Patients who experience only a transient improvement while on treatment, or who never respond to treatment are said to have failed treatment and are discussed above.

There is a small relapse rate associated with all treatment regimens, even if the treatment has been taken religiously with 100% compliance (the standard regimen 2HREZ/4HR has a relapse rate of 2 to 3% under trial conditions). The majority of relapses occur within 6 months of finishing treatment. Patients who are more likely to relapse are those who took their medication in an unreliable and irregular fashion.

The probability of resistance is higher in those patients who relapse and every effort must be made to obtain a specimen that can be cultured for sensitivities. That said, most patients who relapse do so with a fully sensitive strain and it is possible that these patients have not relapsed, but have instead been re-infected; these patients can be re-treated with the same regimen as before (no drugs need to be added to the regimen and the duration need not be any longer).

The WHO recommends a regimen of 2SHREZ/6HRE when microbiology is not available (the majority of countries where TB is highly endemic). This regimen was designed to provide optimal treatment for fully sensitive TB (the most common finding in patients who have relapsed) as well as to cover the possibility of INH-resistant TB (the most common form of resistance found).

Because of the lifelong risk of relapse, all patients should be warned of the symptoms of TB relapse upon finishing treatment and given strict instructions to return to their doctor if symptoms recur.

==Public health and health policy==
As of 2010, India has more reported cases of TB than any other country. This is in part due to severe mismanagement of diagnosis and treatment of TB within the private health care sector of India that serves about 50% of the population. There are therefore calls for the private sector to engage in the public Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program that has proved effective in reducing TB amongst the patients receiving health care through the government. Additionally, a study by Maurya et al. conducted in 2013 shows evidence that there is a burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in India and change is needed for testing, surveillance, monitoring, and management. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 80% fewer TB cases were reported daily in April 2020 in India, reducing the diagnosis and treatment of TB.

==Trial of therapy==
In areas where TB is highly endemic, it is not unusual to encounter patient with a fever, but in whom no source of infection is found. The physician may then, after extensive investigation has excluded all other diseases, resort to a trial of TB treatment. The regimen used is HEZ for a minimum of three weeks; RMP and STM are omitted from the regimen because they are broad spectrum antibiotics, whereas the other three first-line drugs treat only mycobacterial infection. Resolution of the fever after three weeks of treatment is good evidence for occult TB and the patient should then be changed to conventional TB treatment (2HREZ/4HR). If the fever does not resolve after three weeks of treatment then it is reasonable to conclude that the patient has another cause for his fever.

This approach is not recommended by the WHO and most national guidelines.

==Surgical treatment==
Surgery has played an important part in the management of tuberculosis since the 1930s.

===Historical surgical management===
The first successful treatments for tuberculosis were all surgical. They were based on the observation that healed tuberculous cavities were all closed. Surgical management was therefore directed at closing open cavities to encourage healing. These procedures were all used in the pre-antibiotic era. There exists a myth that surgeons believed that the purpose was to deprive the organism of oxygen: it was however well known that the organism survives anaerobic conditions. Although these procedures may be considered barbaric by 21st century&#x27;s standards, it must be remembered that these treatments represented a potential cure for a disease that at the time had a mortality at least as bad as lung cancer in 2000s.

;Recurrent or persistent pneumothorax
:The simplest and earliest procedure was to introduce air into the pleural space so as to collapse the affected lung and therefore the open cavity. There was always spontaneous resolution of the pneumothorax and the procedure had to be repeated every few weeks.
;Phrenic nerve crush
:The phrenic nerve (which supplies the diaphragm) was cut or crushed so as to permanently paralyse the diaphragm on that side. The paralysed diaphragm would then rise up and the lung on that side would collapse, thus closing the cavity.
;Thoracoplasty
:When the cavity was located in the apex of the lung, thoracoplasty could be performed. Six to eight ribs were broken and pushed into the thoracic cavity to collapse the lung beneath. This was a disfiguring operation, but it avoided the need for repeated procedures. In the Novosibirsk TB Research Institute (Russia), osteoplastic thoracoplasty (a variant of extrapleural thoracoplasty) has been used for the last 50 years for patients with complicated cavitary forms of TB for whom lung resection is contraindicated.
;Plombage
:Plombage reduced the need for a disfiguring operation. It involved inserting porcelain balls into the thoracic cavity to collapse the lung underneath.

Surgical resections of infected lungs were rarely attempted during the 1930s and 1940s, due to the extremely high perioperative mortality rate.

===Modern surgical management===
In modern times, the surgical treatment of tuberculosis is confined to the management of multi-drug resistant TB. A patient with MDR-TB who remains culture positive after many months of treatment may be referred for lobectomy or pneumonectomy with the aim of cutting out the infected tissue. The optimal timing for surgery has not been defined, and surgery still confers significant morbidity. The centre with the largest experience in the US is the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, Colorado. From 1983 to 2000, they performed 180 operations in 172 patients; of these, 98 were lobectomies, and 82 were pneumonectomies. They report a 3.3% operative mortality, with an additional 6.8% dying following the operation; 12% experienced significant morbidity (particularly extreme breathlessness). Of 91 patients who were culture positive before surgery, only 4 were culture positive after surgery.

Some complications of treated tuberculosis like recurrent hemoptysis, destroyed or bronchiectasic lungs, and empyema (a collection of pus in the pleural cavity) are also amenable to surgical therapy.

In extrapulmonary TB, surgery is often needed to make a diagnosis (rather than to effect a cure): surgical excision of lymph nodes, drainage of abscesses, tissue biopsy, etc. are all examples of this. Samples taken for TB culture should be sent to the laboratory in a sterile pot with no additive (not even water or saline) and must arrive in the laboratory as soon as possible. Where facilities for liquid culture are available, specimens from sterile sites may be inoculated directly following the procedure: this may improve the yield. In spinal TB, surgery is indicated for spinal instability (when there is extensive bony destruction) or when the spinal cord is threatened. Therapeutic drainage of tuberculous abscesses or collections is not routinely indicated and will resolve with adequate treatment. In TB meningitis, hydrocephalus is a potential complication and may necessitate the insertion of a ventricular shunt or drain.

==Nutrition==
It is well known that malnutrition is a strong risk factor for becoming unwell with TB, that TB is itself a risk factor for malnutrition, and that malnourished patients with TB (BMI less than 18.5) are at an increased risk of death even with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Knowledge about the association between malnutrition and TB is prevalent in some cultures, and may reduce diagnostic delay and improve adherence to treatment.

Although blood levels of some micronutrients may be low in people starting treatment for active tuberculosis, a Cochrane review of thirty-five included trials concluded that there is insufficient research to know whether the routine provision of free food or energy supplements improves tuberculosis treatment outcomes. However, nutritional supplementation probably improves weight gain in some settings.

===Vitamin D and tuberculosis epidemiology===

Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for tuberculosis, and vitamin D deficiency appears to impair the body&#x27;s ability to fight tuberculosis, but there is no clinical evidence to show that treating vitamin D deficiency prevents tuberculosis, although the available evidence is that it ought to. Reduced levels of vitamin D may explain the increased susceptibility of African-Americans to tuberculosis, and may also explain why phototherapy is effective for lupus vulgaris (tuberculosis of the skin) (a finding which won Niels Finsen the Nobel Prize in 1903), because skin exposed to sunlight naturally produces more vitamin D.

Concerns that tuberculosis treatment itself decreases vitamin D levels appear not to be an issue in clinical practice.

Genetic differences in the vitamin D receptor in West African, Gujarati and Chinese populations have been noted to affect susceptibility to tuberculosis, but there is no data available in any population that shows vitamin D supplementation (that is, giving extra vitamin D to people with normal vitamin D levels) has any effect on susceptibility to TB.

===Vitamin D and tuberculosis treatment===
Giving vitamin D to TB patients who are vitamin D deficient may be beneficial in a proportion of patients. When taken as a group, vitamin D supplementation appears to have no benefit when using sputum culture conversion as an endpoint, and giving vitamin D supplements to TB patients who have normal vitamin D levels does not provide any benefit from the point of view of TB. In a subset of patients with the &quot;tt&quot; genotype of the TaqI vitamin D receptor and who are vitamin D deficient, vitamin D supplementation appears to hasten sputum culture conversion. There are no studies of vitamin D using the gold standard outcome of relapse, so the true benefit of vitamin D is not at present known.

It was noted as early as the mid-19th century that cod liver oil (which is rich in vitamin D) improved patients with tuberculosis, and the mechanism for this is probably an enhancement of immune responses to tuberculosis.

The addition of vitamin D appears to enhance the ability of monocytes and macrophages to kill &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; &quot;in vitro&quot; as well as ameliorating potentially harmful effects of the human immune system. Another reason vitamin D can be used as a treatment for mycobacterial infections like tuberculosis is because of pro-anti-inflammatory cytokines that are influenced by vitamin D. Vitamin D has a post-anti-inflammatory effect on tuberculosis.

==Latent tuberculosis==
The treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is essential to controlling and eliminating TB by reducing the risk that TB infection will progress to disease.

The terms &quot;preventive therapy&quot; and &quot;chemoprophylaxis&quot; have been used for decades and are preferred in the UK because it involves giving medication to people who have no active disease and are currently well, the reason for treatment is primarily to prevent people from becoming unwell. The term &quot;latent tuberculosis treatment&quot; is preferred in the US because the medication does not actually prevent infection: it prevents an existing silent infection from becoming active. The feeling in the US is that the term &quot;treatment of LTBI&quot; promotes wider implementation by convincing people that they are receiving treatment for disease. There are no convincing reasons to prefer one term over the other.

It is essential that assessment to rule out active TB is carried out before treatment for LTBI is started. To give LTBI treatment to someone with active TB is a serious error: the TB will not be adequately treated and there is a risk of developing drug-resistant strains of TB.

There are several treatment regimens available:
* 9H—Isoniazid for 9 months is the gold standard and is 93% effective.
* 6H—Isoniazid for 6 months might be adopted by a local TB program based on cost-effectiveness and patient compliance. This is the regimen currently recommended in the UK for routine use. The US guidance exclude this regimen from use in children or persons with radiographic evidence of prior tuberculosis (old fibrotic lesions). (69% effective)
* 6 to 9H2—A twice-weekly regimen for the above two treatment regimens is an alternative if administered under Directly observed therapy (DOT).
* 4R—Rifampicin for 4 months is an alternative for those who are unable to take isoniazid or who have had known exposure to isoniazid-resistant TB.
* 3HR—Isoniazid and rifampicin may be given for 3 months.
* 2RZ—The 2-month regimen of rifampicin and pyrazinamide is no longer recommended for treatment of LTBI because of the greatly increased risk of drug-induced hepatitis and death.
* 3RPT/INH - 3-month (12-dose) regimen of weekly rifapentine and isoniazid.

Evidence for treatment effectiveness:

A 2000 Cochran review containing 11 double-blinded, randomized control trials and 73,375 patients examined six- and 12-month courses of isoniazid (INH) for treatment of latent tuberculosis. HIV positive and patients currently or previously treated for tuberculosis were excluded. The main result was a relative risk (RR) of 0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.52) for development of active tuberculosis over two years or longer for patients treated with INH, with no significant difference between treatment courses of six or 12 months (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.73 for six months, and 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50 for 12 months).
&lt;br&gt;A 2013 systematic review published by the Cochrane Collaboration, compared Rifamycins (monotheraphy and combination therapy) to INH monotheraphy as an alternative in preventing active TB in HIV negative populations. The evidence suggested that shorter Rifampicin regimes (3 or 4 months) had higher treatment completion rates and fewer adverse events when compared to INH. However, the overall quality of evidence as per GRADE criteria was low to moderate. Another meta-analysis came to a similar conclusion, namely that rifamycin-containing regimens taken for 3 months or longer had a better profile in preventing TB reactivation.

==Research==
There is some evidence from animal and clinical studies that suggests that moxifloxacin-containing regimens as short as four months may be as effective as six months of conventional therapy.

Bayer is currently running a phase II clinical trial in collaboration with the TB Alliance to evaluate shorter treatment regimens for TB; encouragingly, Bayer have also promised that if the trials are successful, Bayer will make moxifloxacin affordable and accessible in countries that need it. Another approach for anti-TB drug development, which does not rely on antibiotics, consists of targeting NAD+ synthase, an essential enzyme in tuberculosis bacteria but not in humans. Low level laser therapy for treating tuberculosis is not supported by reliable evidence.

==History==
Streptomycin and para-aminosalicylic acid were developed by the mid-1940s. In 1960, Edinburgh City Hospital physician Sir John Crofton, addressed the Royal College of Physicians in London with a lecture titled &quot;Tuberculosis Undefeated&quot;, and proposed that &quot;the disease could be conquered, once and for all&quot;. With his colleagues at Edinburgh, he recognised that germs that developed only a mild resistance to one drug was significant. His team showed that when treating new cases of TB, strict compliance to a combination of three therapies, or the triple therapy, (streptomycin, para-aminosalicylic acid and isoniazid) could provide a complete cure. It became known as the &#x27;Edinburgh method&#x27; and became standard treatment for at least 15 years. In the 1970s it was recognised that combining isoniazid and rifampin could reduce the duration of treatment from 18 to nine months, and in the 1980s the duration of treatment was further shortened by adding pyrazinamide.

<text>Al-Malik as-Salih Najm al-Din Ayyub (5 November 1205 – 22 November 1249), nickname: Abu al-Futuh (), also known as al-Malik al-Salih, was the Ayyubid ruler of Egypt from 1240 to 1249.

==Early life==
As-Salih was born in 1205, the son of Al-Kamil and a Nubian concubine. Her name was Ward Al-Muna and she was also the servant of Al-Kamil&#x27;s other wife, Sawda bint Al-Faqih, the mother of Adil. In 1221, he became a hostage at the end of the Fifth Crusade, while John of Brienne became a hostage of as-Salih&#x27;s father Al-Kamil, until Damietta was reconstructed and restored to Egypt. In 1232, he was given Hasankeyf in the Jazirah (now part of Turkey), which his father had captured from the Artuqids. In 1234 his father sent him to rule Damascus, removing him from the succession in Egypt after suspecting him of conspiring against him with the Mamluks. 

In 1238, al-Kamil died leaving as-Salih his designated heir in the Jazira, and his other son Al-Adil II as his heir in Egypt. In the dynastic disputes which followed, as-Salih took control of Damascus in 1239 and set about using it as a base for enlarging his domain. 

He received representations from his father&#x27;s old Emirs in Egypt, who appealed to him to remove his brother. While making ready to invade Egypt he was informed that his brother had been captured by his soldiers and was being held prisoner. As-Salih was invited to come at once and assume the Sultanate.

In August 1239, Ayyub began pressuring Al-Salih Ismail to join him at Nablus for the campaign to take over Egypt from al-Adil II. Ayyub began to grow suspicious of Ismail&#x27;s perceived procrastination and sent a noted physician, Sa&#x27;d al-Din al-Dimashqi, to find out what his vassal was doing. Ismail&#x27;s vizier discovered Ayyub&#x27;s scheme and secretly forged al-Dimashqi&#x27;s records to mislead Ayyub into thinking Ismail was indeed on his way to Nablus. Eventually, Ismail, with the support of the Ayyubids of Kerak, Hama and Homs, captured Damascus from Ayyub in September 1239. Ayyub was abandoned by his troops and taken captive by local Bedouin who transferred him to al-Nasir Dawud&#x27;s control, in which he was held as a prisoner in Kerak, along with Shajar al-Durr who gave birth to their son Khalil, and his Mamluk Rukn al-Din Baybars al-Salihi.

In April 1240, An-Nasir, quarreling with al-Adil II, released Ayyub and allied with him against the Egyptians, in return for a promise that Ayyub would reinstall him in Damascus. Al-Adil was imprisoned by his own troops, and Ayyub and An-Nasir made a triumphal entry into Cairo in June 1240, hence As-Salih became the paramount ruler of the Ayyubid family.

==Rise of the Mamluks==
Once installed in Cairo, As-Salih was far from secure. The complex nature of the Ayyubid state meant that the ruling family itself, as well as associated Kurdish clans, had divided loyalties. Within Egypt, a powerful faction of Emirs, the Ashrafiyya, were conspiring to depose him and replace him with his uncle, as-Salih Ismail, who had regained control of Damascus after his departure. As-Salih shut himself in the Cairo citadel, and could no longer trust even the once-loyal Emirs who had brought him to power. The lack of loyal soldiers led him to begin buying large numbers of Kipchak slaves, who were available in unusually large numbers following the Mongol invasions in central Asia. They soon formed the core of his army, and were known as Mamluks.

As-Salih was not the first Ayyubid ruler to make use of Mamluks, but he was the first to depend on them so heavily. Rather than just recruiting small numbers of Mamluks, As-Salih established two complete corps of them, numbering up to 1000 men. One unit was known as the &#x27;River Corps&#x27; or Baḥrīyah or Bahriyya, because they were garrisoned at Rawḍah island in the River Nile. The second, smaller corps was the Jamdārīyah, which appears to have operated as a body guard for As-Salih. As the Mamluks would eventually overthrow the Ayyubid dynasty and take power on their own, their early rise to prominence under As-Salih Ayyub is of considerable historical importance. In English, references to the Bahriyya after As-Salih&#x27;s death, when they became the dominant power in Egypt, usually describe them as the Bahri Mamluks. The members of the Bahriyya who were recruited by As-Salih himself are also sometimes referred to as the Salihiyya. During his lifetime these terms were synonymous.

==Wars with other Ayyubid realms and the Crusaders==
The period 1240–1243 was largely occupied with complex military and diplomatic manoeuvres involving the Crusader states in Palestine and the European armies that arrived during the Barons&#x27; Crusade, other Ayyubid family rulers in Syria, and the Khwarezmians of Diyar Mudar who had previously been allied to as-Salih. Just as his Bahri Mamluks were important in enabling him to maintain order in Egypt, the Khwarezmians were useful in dominating the other Ayyubid rulers in neighbouring regions. In 1244, at As-Salih&#x27;s invitation, the remainder of the Khwarezmian army which had just been crushed and routed out by the Mongols, advanced through Syria and Palestine and sacked Jerusalem, which had been handed over to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor by al-Kamil during the Sixth Crusade. Later that year as-Salih, again allied to the Khwarezmians, defeated as-Salih Ismail in Syria, who had allied with the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, at the Battle of La Forbie. In 1245 as-Salih captured Damascus, and was awarded the title of sultan by the caliph al-Musta&#x27;sim in Baghdad. As-Salih was not however able to extend his rule far beyond Damascus, although he was able to retain the emirate of Baalbek under Saʿd al-Din al-Humaidi.

In 1246 he decided that his Khwarezmian allies were dangerously uncontrollable, so he turned on them and defeated them near Homs, killing their leader and dispersing the remnants throughout Syria and Palestine. As-Salih&#x27;s capture of Jerusalem after the Khwarezmian sacking led to the call for a new Crusade in Europe, and Louis IX of France took up the cross. The campaign took several years to organise, but in 1249 Louis invaded Egypt on the Seventh Crusade, and occupied Damietta.

==Death and legacy==
As-Salih was away fighting his uncle in Syria when news of the Crusader invasion came, but he quickly returned to Egypt and encamped at al-Mansourah, where he died on 22 November after having his leg amputated in an attempt to save his life from a serious abscess. As-Salih did not trust his heir, al-Muazzam Turanshah, and had kept him at a safe distance from Egypt in Hasankeyf. As-Salih&#x27;s widow, Shajar al-Durr, managed to hide his death until Turanshah arrived. Turanshah&#x27;s rule was brief and was followed by a long and complicated interregnum until the Bahri Mamluks eventually took power. As-Salih was thus the last major Ayyubid ruler of Egypt, and the last to combine rule of Egypt with effective rule of parts of Palestine and Syria.

<text>Tintin and the Temple of the Sun (original title Tintin et le temple du soleil) is a 1969 animated film produced by Belvision Studios. A co-production between Belgium, France and Switzerland, it is an adaptation of Hergé&#x27;s two-part Tintin adventure &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; and &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;.

== Production ==
Coming after the success of the Belvision cartoon series, &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, there was a lot of publicity for the movie (which was the first of two animated films, the second being 1972&#x27;s &quot;Tintin and the Lake of Sharks&quot;). Jacques Brel, a fan of the series, contributed two songs to the soundtrack, entitled &quot;Chanson de Zorrino&quot; and &quot;Ode a la Nuit&quot;.

== Plot ==
When seven archaeologists find an old Inca mummy, they become the victims of an Inca curse. Back in Europe, they fall into a deep sleep one by one and only once a day, at the same time, do they wake up for a few minutes and have hallucinations of the Inca god. The story begins with the sixth archaeologist falling asleep by the contents of a crystal ball thrown into his car by Incas.

Professor Tarragon stays with Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock in Marlinspike Hall, when the Thompsons arrive, Tarragon learns from them that he is the last conscious Professor. A thunderstorm approaches and the lights go out. This is used by the Incas to put the last one in sleep and to capture Professor Calculus, who has proved to be a desecrater of the sanctuary by putting on the bracelet of the Inca sun god.

His friends Tintin and Haddock follow the track to Peru, up to the mountains through snow and jungle and finally discover the Temple of the Sun, where they are caught. Their only choice is to choose the day on which they want to be burned to death by the sun. Tintin chooses wisely and is able use an eclipse. At the end he achieves forgiveness, the archaeologists are cured from their curse and Calculus is released.

==Cast==
===Additional Voices===
*Geneviève Beau
*Jacques Jouanneau
*Jacques Ruisseau
*Jacques Sablon
*Bachir Touré

==Changes from the books==
Many scenes from the source books are deleted; in fact the whole of &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; is condensed into twenty minutes of film. Events were changed and some are added. For example, the Prince of the Sun&#x27;s daughter is introduced, who tries to beg her father to spare the prisoners (and likes Zorrino). Also, Thomson and Thompson accompany Tintin and Captain Haddock on their quest to rescue Professor Calculus, whereas in the books their only role is attempting to use dowsing in order to find Tintin and his friends (and their arrival in the Incan village delays the planned execution).

<doc id="1330711" wikidata="Q2776519" url="?curid=1330711" title="Exiles (Dan Fogelberg album)">
<text>Exiles is an album by the American musician Dan Fogelberg, released in 1987. It includes the A/C hits &quot;Lonely in Love&quot; and “Seeing You Again” and the pop hit &quot;She Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;. Fogelberg supported the album by touring with Wendy Waldman.

==Production==
Fogelberg spent two years writing the songs, which were inspired by his divorce. The Tower of Power horns played on &quot;What You&#x27;re Doing&quot;.

==Reception==

The &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; noted that, &quot;as with any mellow musician who turns up the volume, Fogelberg now claims he has been a closet rock and roller all along.&quot; &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot; wrote: &quot;The title song recalls Springsteen, featuring an anguished, Michael Brecker tenor sax solo that&#x27;s pure Clarence Clemons. &#x27;What Your Doing&#x27; is solid soul, with Fogelberg doing his best Otis Redding, backed by a girl group and the Tower of Power horn section. For ballad fans, there&#x27;s the gentle pop of &#x27;Seeing You Again&#x27; and the solo voice and piano of &#x27;Hearts in Decline&#x27;. Breaking up is hard to do, but Fogelberg should find some solace in LP sales. &quot;Exiles&quot; is custom made for his millions of adult rock fans.&quot;

The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; wrote that &quot;Fogelberg&#x27;s phony soul inflections on &#x27;What You&#x27;re Doing&#x27; are barely short of laughable.&quot; The &quot;Indianapolis News&quot; wrote that &quot;Dan Fogelberg&#x27;s &quot;Exiles&quot; (Full Moon-Epic) is an album-long look at the downside of love, and it&#x27;s a strong record.&quot;&quot;The Washington Post&quot; called &quot;Lonely in Love&quot; &quot;a soulless string of bromides with a twist of tenor sax supplied by designated-soulman Michael Brecker.&quot; &quot;The Morning Call&quot; listed the album among the worst of 1987. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said &quot; After a three year hiatus from rock n rock and a brief foray into country music turf, this Colorado recluse returns with a blazing vengeance.&quot;

<text>Obadiah Gardner (September 13, 1852July 24, 1938) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Maine. Gardner was a businessman and member of the Democratic Party who served in several minor state executive positions before serving in the United States Senate.

==Biography==
Gardner was born near Port Huron, Michigan. In 1864 at the age of 12, he moved with his parents to Union, Maine, where he attended public schools. He studied at Eastman Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York and later at the Coburn Classical Institute in Waterville, Maine. After graduating he engaged in the agriculture business, including ventures in lumber, lime, and creameries in Rockland and cattle raising elsewhere.
He was a member of the Maine Board of Agriculture and later the master of the Maine State Grange (1897–1907). In 1908, he launched an unsuccessful campaign to become governor, losing to Republican candidate Bert M. Fernald. In 1911, he was appointed as chairman of the Board of State Assessors, but resigned after being appointed and later elected Senator, filing the vacancy caused by the death of William P. Frye. Gardner served from September 23, 1911, until March 3, 1913, when he lost his bid for re-election. During this time, Gardner served in the Senate with fellow Democrat Charles Fletcher Johnson. It marked the first time since 1853 that two Democrats represented Maine in the United States Senate.

Following this defeat, he was appointed a member of the International Joint Commission created to prevent disputes between Canada and the United States over shared boundary waters. Later he became chairman of the American delegation, serving until his retirement in 1923.

Gardner returned to Rockland and later moved to Augusta, where he died. He is interred in the Achorn Cemetery in Rockland.

Julita Ross died on June 29, 1981, in Levittown, Toa Baja and was buried in Bayamón. The mayor of Toa Baja honored her memory by renaming the Levittown theater &quot;El Theatro de Bellas Artes de Julita Ross&quot; (The Julita Ross Theater of Beautiful Arts).

<text>CNN NewsNight is a live news program which airs on the CNN and CNN International networks. It airs at 10:00 PM ET on weeknights and is currently hosted by Abby Phillip.

During its first run, the show focused on investigative journalism and had a strong emphasis on interviews. It included segments such as The Whip (which quickly previewed segments from four reporters at large), On the Rise, and Segment 7. The Morning Papers segment, known as The Rooster, featured a brief preview of compelling or interesting headlines from the next day&#x27;s newspapers around the world. The segment concluded with the weather forecast in Chicago as provided in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;.

To cover the increased amount of news generated by Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath in September 2005, CNN expanded NewsNight to two hours and added Anderson Cooper as a co-host. (Cooper&#x27;s coverage of the natural disaster elsewhere on the network had given him strong ratings.) These changes were intended to last for the duration of the hurricane&#x27;s aftermath, but CNN later announced that it would keep the new format and make Cooper a permanent co-host.

On November 2, 2005, CNN announced that it was canceling &quot;NewsNight&quot; and that Brown would leave the network. As of November 7, 2005, the timeslot was given to Cooper&#x27;s show, &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot;.

&quot;CNN NewsNight&quot; was revived on October 16, 2023, with host Abby Phillip; it airs weeknights at 10:00 PM ET on CNN.

Between November 29, 2023, and April 10, 2024, the program was not aired on Wednesdays after then-CNN chief Chris Licht wanted more personality-based programming on the network; this resulted in the launch of &quot;King Charles&quot;, a news discussion program co-hosted by Gayle King and former NBA player Charles Barkley. The programme performed poorly in the ratings, and on the April 10 broadcast, the hosts announced that it would be the final episode. Consequently, &quot;CNN Newsnight&quot; again became a five-nights-a-week programme.

<text>Miami Modernist architecture, or MiMo, is a regional style of architecture that developed in South Florida during the post-war period. The style was internationally recognized as a regionalist response to the International Style. It can be seen in most of the larger Miami and Miami Beach resorts built after the Great Depression. Because MiMo styling was not just a response to international architectural movements but also to client demands, themes of glamour, fun, and material excess were added to otherwise stark, minimalist, and efficient styles of the era. The style can be most observed today in Middle and Upper Miami Beach along Collins Avenue, as well as along the Biscayne Boulevard corridor starting from around Midtown, through the Design District and into the Upper Eastside.

The term MiMo has only recently been associated with the style. Popularity of the term is credited to Miami Beach resident Randall C. Robinson and interior designer Teri D&#x27;Amico. Principal examples of MiMo include the Fontainebleau Hotel, Eden Roc, Seacoast Towers, Deauville, and Di Lido hotels by famed architect Morris Lapidus; Norman Giller&#x27;s Carillon Hotel, which was voted Miami Beach&#x27;s &quot;Hotel of the Year&quot; in 1959; and the original Diplomat Hotel in Hollywood, Florida.

To some degree, Miami developed the style through the work of younger architects immediately after the war; they were more closely aligned with media promotions and sensationalism than older architects of the era. The region successfully transposed its extravagant resort styling to a national audience easily captivated by the area’s relative exoticism.

The area along Biscayne Boulevard is now the designated &quot;MiMo Biscayne Boulevard Historic District&quot; or more uniquely named &quot;MiMo on BiBo&quot;, for &quot;Miami Modern on Biscayne Boulevard&quot;. MiMo Historic District runs roughly from 50th Street to 77th Street along Biscayne Boulevard, although MiMo can be found in the Design District and Midtown. Many annual festivals are held to promote MiMo architecture, such as &quot;Cinco de MiMo&quot; a play on &quot;Cinco de Mayo&quot; in early May. The area is bounded by the Little River to the north, Bay Point Estates to the south, the Florida East Coast Railway to the west, and Biscayne Bay to the east.

<text>Thief is a 1981 American neo-noir heist film written and directed by Michael Mann in his feature film debut. It stars James Caan as a professional safecracker trying to escape his life of crime, and Tuesday Weld as his wife. The supporting cast includes Jim Belushi, Robert Prosky, Dennis Farina, and Willie Nelson. The screenplay is inspired by the memoir &quot;The Home Invaders: Confessions of a Cat Burglar&quot;, by former cat burglar Frank Hohimer. The original musical score was composed and performed by Tangerine Dream.

Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and James Caan&#x27;s brother Ronnie, &quot;Thief&quot; was screened at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or. It was released in the United States on March 27, 1981, to widespread critical acclaim. &quot;Thief&quot; earned $11.5 million at the box office, on a $5.5 million budget.

== Plot ==
Frank is a jewel thief and ex-convict who has a set structure to his life since being released from Joliet Correctional Center in Joliet, Illinois. With a pair of successful Chicago businesses (a bar and a car dealership) as fronts for his criminal enterprise, Frank sets out to fulfill the missing part of his life vision: a family with Jessie, a cashier he has begun dating.

After taking down a major diamond score, Frank gives the diamonds to his fence, Joe Gags. However, before Frank can collect his $185,000 share, Gags is thrown from a twelve-story window for skimming from the payments he had been collecting from loan shark clients. Barry, Frank&#x27;s friend and associate making the pick-up, discovers that Attaglia, a plating company executive Gags was working for, is responsible for Gags&#x27; murder and stealing Frank&#x27;s payoff. In a confrontation at the plating company, Frank demands his money back.

This leads to a meeting with Attaglia&#x27;s employer Leo, a high-level fence and Chicago Outfit boss. Unknown to Frank, Leo has been receiving Frank&#x27;s goods from Gags for some time. Leo returns the money and says he admires Frank&#x27;s eye for quality stolen goods and professionalism. He wants Frank working directly for him, offering large profits. Their meeting is monitored from a distance by police surveillance.

Frank is initially reluctant, not wanting the added exposure or complications, but later that night, a conversation with Jessie changes his mind when she agrees to be part of his life, after he relates a tale of prison survival via a toughened mental attitude. Frank now agrees to do just one big score for Leo, telling Barry that this will be their last job. After being rejected at the state adoption agency, with Leo&#x27;s help Frank is able to acquire a baby boy on the black market, whom he names David after his late mentor, nicknamed Okla.

After resisting a shakedown from a group of corrupt police detectives, and then subsequently ditching their surveillance, Frank and his crew are involved in a large-scale Los Angeles diamond heist organized by Leo. All goes well with Frank&#x27;s &quot;burn job&quot; and he is expecting the agreed-upon sum of $830,000 for the unmounted stones with a wholesale value $4 million. But when Frank returns from the job, Leo gives him less than $100,000. This is all that Frank will receive in cash according to Leo, who says he invested the rest of Frank&#x27;s cut in shopping centers in Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas, an idea Frank had previously rejected. In addition, Leo has set up a Palm Beach score for Frank in six weeks without consulting him. Frank tells Leo that their deal is over and takes the cash as he leaves, demanding the rest of his money in 24 hours.

Frank drives to his car lot, unaware that Leo&#x27;s henchmen have already beaten and captured Barry and are waiting to ambush him. Frank is knocked out and Barry is killed by the enforcers. Frank awakens with Leo staring down at him, surrounded by his henchmen. Leo informs him that he, Jessie, their child, and everything he owns are Leo&#x27;s property. He threatens Frank&#x27;s family if he does not continue working for him. Leo warns Frank to focus on his responsibilities. When Frank returns home, he orders an uncomprehending Jessie out of their house, telling her their marriage is over, that she must immediately leave, and that he will not be joining her. Frank instructs an associate to drive her, the baby, and $410,000 in cash to somewhere where they cannot be located.

With nothing to lose, Frank blows up their home using high-explosive charges. He then drives to his business establishments and does likewise. Armed with a pistol, he quietly breaks into Leo&#x27;s house in a peaceful neighborhood and pistol whips Attaglia in the kitchen. Frank hunts for Leo, killing him in the living room. Frank then pursues Attaglia as he tries to escape from the house, but is confronted in the front yard by Leo’s bodyguards. In the ensuing gunfight, Frank is shot, but manages to kill the trio. Frank loosens what appears to be a bulletproof vest he was wearing beneath his jacket, and walks away into the night.

== Background ==
&quot;Thief&quot; marked the feature film debut of Michael Mann as director, screenwriter and executive producer, after five years in television drama.

Mann made his directorial debut with the TV film &quot;The Jericho Mile&quot;. This was partly shot in Folsom Prison. Mann says that influenced the writing of &quot;Thief&quot;:
It probably informed my ability to imagine what Frank&#x27;s life was like, where he was from, and what those 12 or 13 years in prison were like for him. The idea of creating his character, was to have somebody who has been outside of society. An outsider who has been removed from the evolution of everything from technology to the music that people listen to, to how you talk to a girl, to what do you want with your life and how do you go about getting it. Everything that&#x27;s normal development, that we experience, he was excluded from, by design. In the design of the character and the engineering of the character, that was the idea.

Also notable is the scene where Leo disposes of bodies at an auto body shop, placing them in a plating solution in the exact same manner as used in the Charles Bronson movie The Mechanic.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
Mann made James Caan do research as a thief for his role, and said:
I always find it interesting, people who are aware, alert, conscious of what they do and are pretty good at it… People who want to put in 50-60 hours a week and go home and are not really conscious of life moving by, don&#x27;t really interest me very much... As part of the curriculum designed for an actor getting into character, I try to imagine what&#x27;s going to really help bring this actor more fully into character. And so I try to imagine what experiences are going to make more dimensional his intake of Frank, so that he is Frank spontaneously when I&#x27;m shooting. So one of the most obvious things is it&#x27;d be pretty good if [James Caan] was as good at doing what Frank does as is Frank.The character Leo was patterned after Chicago Outfit bosses Felix Alderisio and Leo Rugendorf.

=== Casting ===
&quot;Thief&quot; marks the first film appearance of actors Dennis Farina, William Petersen, James Belushi and Robert Prosky. At the time a Chicago police officer, Farina appears as a mob henchman. Conversely, John Santucci (real name: John Schiavone), who plays the role of corrupt cop Urizzi, was a recently paroled thief on whom the character Frank was partly based, and acted as a technical adviser on the film. Another actor in the film, W.R. ‘Bill’ Brown, was also a former safecracker and associate of Joseph Scalise. Chuck Adamson (Detective Ancell) and Nick Nickeas (Nick) were also Chicago police officers, while Gavin MacFadyen, who plays Detective Boresko, was a journalist who later served as adviser to Mann’s 1999 film &quot;The Insider&quot;.

In 1986, Farina and Santucci both were cast in Mann and Adamson&#x27;s TV series &quot;Crime Story&quot;, Farina as a Chicago police lieutenant and Santucci as a jewel thief. Petersen, who later would star (along with Farina) in the Mann film &quot;Manhunter&quot;, appears briefly as a barman at a club. The influential Chicago improv teacher Del Close has a brief appearance as a mechanic, in a scene that was improvised with the other mechanic actors.

=== Filming ===
&quot;Thief&quot; was filmed on-location in Chicago and Los Angeles. Jerry Bruckheimer and Ronnie Caan served as the film&#x27;s producers.

Being Michael Mann&#x27;s feature film directorial debut, &quot;Thief&quot; showcases many of the cinematic techniques that would later become his trademarks. Chief among these is the cinematography (by Donald E. Thorin), utilizing light and shadow to give the proceedings, especially those taking place in the darkness of night, a sense of danger. The film also earns plaudits for its meticulous attention to detail: the tools and techniques of the trade, right down to the oxy lance used to penetrate a safe, are authentic, the result of Mann&#x27;s decision to hire real-life thieves to serve as technical advisers.

The still of Frank holding a gun on Attaglia as he attempts to recover his money in an early scene was used for one of the movie&#x27;s posters.

Near the end of the film, Frank destroys his house. The film company built a false front onto a real house and attempted to destroy it with explosives. The explosions severely damaged the real house, however, leading to its demolition.

James Caan&#x27;s emotional several-minute monologue with Weld in a coffee shop is often cited as the film&#x27;s high point, and Caan has long considered the scene his favorite of his career. The actor liked the movie although he found the part challenging to play. &quot;I like to be emotionally available but this guy is available to nothing.&quot;

===Music===

Mann has gained a reputation as a director who uses cutting-edge music for his films.

&quot;Thief&quot;″s moody soundscapes were composed and performed by Tangerine Dream, and was their second of many notable film scores composed by the group throughout the 1980s. The film was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Musical Score, but that didn&#x27;t deter Mann from choosing them a second time to compose the music for his next feature film, the ill-fated 1983 WWII fantasy horror &quot;The Keep&quot;.

He originally intended to score the music with Chicago blues music. He said, &quot;However, I felt that what the film was saying, thematically, and the facility with which the film might be able to have resonance with audience. I felt that to be so regionally specific in the music choice would make Frank&#x27;s experience specific only to Frank. So I wanted the kind of transparency, if you like, the formality of electronic music, and hence Tangerine Dream.&quot; He utilizes jazz/blues in one scene when Frank races to meet Jessie after the offer from Leo, transitioning from the meetup, all the way to the jazz club.

Additional music cues were composed by Craig Safan.

==Reception==
Under the working title &quot;Violent Streets&quot;, the film debuted at the 34th Cannes Film Festival. It went on to open in theaters in the United States on March 27, 1981, earning a modest $4.3 million. While not a financial success in its initial release, the film has become a reference point in Mann&#x27;s career, especially with the release of his crime epic, &quot;Heat&quot;, with which this movie has many similarities.

=== Critical response ===

Roger Ebert described &quot;Thief&quot; as &quot;one of the most intelligent thrillers I&#x27;ve seen&quot; and gave the film out of 4 stars, writing that &quot;If &quot;Thief&quot; has a weak point, it is probably in the handling of the Willie Nelson character&quot; and went further, stating &quot;Willie has played the character so well that we wanted more. But, then, I suppose it is a good thing when a movie creates characters we feel that strongly about, and &quot;Thief&quot; is populated with them. It&#x27;s a thriller with plausible people in it. How rare.&quot;

<text>Frank Ross (born December 23, 1977), better known by his stage name Nitty, is an American rapper from The Bronx, New York. He is perhaps best known for his single &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; and his pop rap style of hip hop, which he calls &quot;playboy rap&quot;.

==Career==
His singles include &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; and &quot;Hey Bitty&quot;, the former reaching No. 1 in sales in the United States in October 2004, and also debuting at No. 1 in Australia in 2005. The following album, &quot;Player&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, was released in 2005.

In an interview with the former Australian music television show &quot;So Fresh&quot;, Nitty explained that he did not want to jump into rap as a mean, edgy type of rapper that is the current trend, but more of a nice-guy rapper, with lighthearted songs and videos. He calls this style &quot;playboy rap&quot;.

Since &quot;Player&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, Nitty has gone on to continue his career as a producer. He is currently an independent artist. In the film &quot;Sex Drive&quot;, his song &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; was on the soundtrack.

<doc id="1330804" wikidata="Q5227158" url="?curid=1330804" title="Data Discman">
<text>is an electronic book player introduced to the Western market in late 1991 or early 1992 by Sony Corporation. It was marketed in the United States to college students and international travelers, but had little success outside Japan. The Discman product name had originally been applied to Sony&#x27;s range of portable CD players such as the Sony Discman D-50, first released in 1984.

The Data Discman was designed to allow quick access to electronic reference information on a pre-recorded disc. Searching terms were entered using a QWERTY-style keyboard and utilized the &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; keys.

A typical Data Discman model has a low resolution small grayscale LCD (256x200 early on, later models would have up to 320x240 and in colour), CD drive unit (either Mini CD or full size), and a low-power computer. Early versions of the device were incapable of playing audio CDs. Software was prerecorded and usually featured encyclopedias, foreign language dictionaries and novels. It was typically created using the Sony Electronic Book Authoring System (SEBAS).

A DD-1EX Data Discman is in the permanent collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum and is currently displayed in the V&amp;A&#x27;s 20th Century Gallery. This early model did not include the ability to play sound.

An updated model, the DD-10EX, was released in 1992 or 1993. The accompanying manual gives a copyright date of 1992. Unlike the DD-1EX, the DD-10EX also had the ability to play audio files. The British version came with a disc containing the &quot;Thomson Electronic Directory&quot; for April 1992, plus another containing the &quot;Pocket Interpreter 5-language conversation book for travelers&quot;. A DD-10EX was included in an exhibition entitled &quot;The Book and Beyond: Electronic Publishing and the Art of the Book&quot;, held at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, from April to October 1995. The exhibition also included a CD-ROM designed to be played on the Data Discman, entitled &quot;Library of the Future&quot; and published in 1993.

The DD-1EX and DD-10EX both made use of a flip or clamshell form, while the flat, rectangular design of the DD-8 was closer to later e-book readers such as the Amazon Kindle.

<doc id="1330819" wikidata="Q4924364" url="?curid=1330819" title="Student syndrome">
<text>Student syndrome refers to planned procrastination, when a student will begin to substantially apply themselves to an assignment or task at the last moment before its deadline. For a person experiencing student syndrome, they only begin to make significant progress when there is a sense of urgency that causes the person to put the proper amount of effort into their task. This eliminates any potential safety margins and puts the person under stress and pressure. An estimated 80 to 95 percent of college students engage in some form of procrastination.

The term is used to describe this form of procrastination in general, and does not only apply to students. It has been observed to affect work flow and productivity in a traditional class setting, the manufacturing industry, and professional fields, such as software engineering and engineering management. 

The term was coined by Eliyahu M. Goldratt in his novel &quot;Critical Chain&quot;.

== Causes &amp; effects of student syndrome ==
Student syndrome can be caused by poor time management, perfectionism and the fear of failure, overload, or burnout. Poor time management can cause people to fail to properly prioritize their tasks and work on them in a timely manner. Perfectionism can cause people to delay starting to work simply from the need to complete it perfectly, while a fear of failure causes a delay of work to not have to confront the possibility of not doing well on the assignment or task. People who are overloaded or burnt out may struggle to complete work and other responsibilities.

Additionally, the nature of work in college and some professional fields, in which students and workers need to structure their own time and effort to manage their work, provides greater opportunity for people to procrastinate, especially those that do not have set methods to self-regulate their work flow. There are also widely accessible distractors, such as video games and text messaging, that can easily tempt people into engaging in more desirable activities.

Because of the last minute nature of the work flow under student syndrome, it does not allow for proper adaptability to unexpected issues that arise during the work process. Student syndrome can cause a negative impact to grades or performance reviews, as the limited time to complete tasks can cause people to submit incomplete or underdeveloped work. Additionally, it can affect people&#x27;s mental health and well-being due to the increase in stress and how it can affect sleep or eating habits, especially later in the semester or project timeline.

<doc id="1330820" wikidata="Q493818" url="?curid=1330820" title="Inoue Kaoru">
<text>[[Kazoku|Marquess]] Inoue Kaoru (井上 馨, January 16, 1836 – September 1, 1915) was a Japanese politician and a prominent member of the Meiji oligarchy during the Meiji period of the Empire of Japan. As one of the senior statesmen (&quot;Genrō&quot;) in Japan during that period, he had a tremendous influence on the selection of the nation&#x27;s leaders and formation of its policies.

==Early years==

Born Yakichi (勇吉) to a lower-ranked &quot;samurai&quot; family in Yuda, Chōshū domain (present day Yamaguchi, Yamaguchi Prefecture), Inoue attended the &quot;Meirinkan&quot; domain school with his brother Ikutarō (幾太郎). He was a close boyhood friend of Itō Hirobumi who later became Japan&#x27;s first prime minister, and he played an active part in the &quot;sonnō jōi&quot; movement. In 1858, he studied &quot;rangaku&quot;, artillery and swordsmanship in Edo.

In the Bakumatsu period, Inoue emerged as a leader of the anti-foreigner movement in his native Chōshū. Desiring to rid Japan of foreigners, he and Takasugi Shinsaku set fire to the British legation in Edo in January 1863.

Recognizing Japan&#x27;s need to learn from the Western powers, Inoue joined the Chōshū Five and was smuggled out of Japan to study at University College, London in England in 1863. When he returned with Itō Hirobumi, he unsuccessfully tried to prevent war (the Battle of Shimonoseki) between Chōshū and the Western naval powers over the closing of the Straits of Shimonoseki to foreign shipping. Later, he fought against the forces of the Tokugawa shogunate in the 1864 First Chōshū Expedition, during which he was severely wounded by the attack of the assassins, received a near-fatal injury, appealing to Inoue&#x27;s elder brother for beheading because of the unbearable pain and finally Ikutaro Tokoro who was then in hiding from the pursuit of Tokugawa shogunate with Prince Sanjō Sanetomi and rushed to Inoue pulled him through this by putting about 50 stitches of tatami needle in the wounds on the whole body without anesthesia because of emergency during the domestic war time (The story that Inoue&#x27;s mother holding bloody Inoue then dissuaded her elder son from beheading was introduced in the National Japanese text book of the 5th period as the power of mother). He later played a key role in the formation of the Satchō Alliance against the Tokugawa shogunate.

==Statesman in the Meiji government==

After the Meiji Restoration, Inoue served in several important positions in the new Meiji government. He was appointed Vice Minister of Finance in 1871 and was influential in reorganizing government finances on modern lines, especially in the reform of the land tax system, termination of government stipends to the ex-&quot;samurai&quot; and former aristocracy and for promoting industrialization. Closely linked to business circles, including the emerging Mitsui &quot;zaibatsu&quot;, he was also involved in the railway business. These measures created many political enemies, and Inoue was forced to resign in May 1873. Inoue took part in the Osaka Conference of 1875 to support the creation of a representative national assembly.

In 1876, Inoue was asked to assist in the field of foreign affairs, and was involved in the conclusion of the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1876 as vice-ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary. He returned to government as Minister of Public Works in 1878 and Lord of Foreign Affairs in 1879 under the early Meiji &quot;Dajō-kan&quot; Cabinet. In 1884, he was elevated to the rank of count (&quot;hakushaku&quot;) under the new &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system.

In December 1885, Inoue officially became Japan&#x27;s first Minister of Foreign Affairs bearing that title in the first Itō Hirobumi cabinet. However, Inoue came under public criticism for his failure to negotiate a revision of the unequal treaties, his building of the Rokumeikan, and support of its Westernizing influences, which forced him to resign in August 1887.

Later he served as Minister of Agriculture and Commerce in the Kuroda administration, as Home Minister in the second Itō administration and again as Finance Minister in the 3rd Itō administration.

From 1901 onwards, Inoue served as most senior of the &quot;genrō&quot;, and considered himself the government&#x27;s foremost advisor on financial affairs. He was advanced to the title of marquis (&quot;kōshaku&quot;) in 1907, and died in 1915 at his summer home at Okitsu-juku, Shizuoka prefecture.

<text>The George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge (known locally as simply the Coleman Bridge) is a double swing bridge that spans the York River between Yorktown and Gloucester Point, in the United States state of Virginia. It connects the Peninsula and Middle Peninsula regions of Tidewater, Virginia. The bridge is the only public crossing of the York River, though State Route 33 crosses both of its tributaries (the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers) just upriver of their confluence at West Point.

==History==
Originally built in 1952, it was reconstructed and widened in 1995 through an unusual process which greatly reduced the time the important commuter artery was out-of-service from conventional methods. The current -long double-swing-span bridge carries United States Route 17, a four-lane arterial highway. The movable span is needed to allow ship access to several military installations that are upstream of the bridge, most notably, the United States Navy&#x27;s Naval Weapons Station Yorktown. The roadways are almost above the river at the highest point of the bridge. The bridge is the largest double-swing-span bridge in the United States, and second largest in the world.

The toll bridge was named for George P. Coleman, who from 1913 to 1922 was the head of the Virginia Department of Highways and Transportation, predecessor to the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). The bridge has been one of the sites of a special program to establish and encourage nesting locations for the peregrine falcon population of Virginia.

==Toll rates==
The George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge is a toll facility. Tolls are only collected northbound, and are used to pay for the expansion of the bridge to four lanes. Toll Collection Rates are as follows:

*Bicycles 0¢
*EZ-Pass (transponder required) 85¢
*Motorcycles 85¢
*Two-axle vehicles $2
*Three-axle vehicles $3
*Four- or more-axle vehicles $4

Bicycles taking advantage of the free crossing must use the established bicycle lane located to the right of the far right travel lane.

<doc id="1330839" wikidata="Q3578015" url="?curid=1330839" title="Han school">
<text>The &quot;han&quot; school was a type of educational institution in the Edo period of Japan. They taught samurai etiquette, the classical Confucian books, calligraphy, rhetoric, fighting with swords and other weapons; some also added subjects such as medicine, mathematics and Western sciences. Schools in different &quot;han&quot; (domains) provided different curricula and had varied conditions for entry. Over the course of the Edo period, &quot;han&quot; schools evolved from simple one-room schools to large educational facilities with multiple buildings. The total numbers of &quot;han&quot; schools varied from several dozen in the early 17th century to over 250 by the end of the 19th century.

== Overview ==

These institutions were known as &quot;hangaku&quot; (), &quot;hangakkō&quot; () or &quot;hankō&quot; (), but since there was no official requirement of what a &quot;han&quot; school has to be or to do, the terminology varied. Han schools were established by individual daimyō (rulers of &quot;han&quot;) to educate male members of the samurai class to be virtuous administrators; originally they taught adults, but over time students were getting younger. They learnt kangaku-juku (Confucian sciences) and military arts 

Some upper-class samurai were legally required to get formal schooling, but most could choose not to. Women were never accepted; they received education at home. Some &quot;han&quot; schools accepted upper commoners, especially in the end of the Edo period; the first one to allow them to enter was the Ōno Domain school founded by Doi Toshitada, in 1857, although lectures were universally segregated by class.

== Curriculum ==
The idea behind the &quot;han&quot; school learning was to build character of a future state servant: discipline and knowledge of the appropriate etiquette were believed to be as important as the cultivation of intellect. Despite that, attendance was not compulsory in most &quot;han&quot;, in others there usually was an age limit: for example, in Mito, students over the age of forty were not required to attend lectures.

All students were taught Confucian sciences, but over the course of the Edo period, more and more subjects became available. There was a lot of variation in the actual organisation of &quot;han&quot; schools: for example, in the Matsumoto &quot;han&quot;, only lower samurai, who ought to become simple clerks, could study mathematics. By the end of the Edo period, about a third of &quot;han&quot; schools incorporated kokugaku, while a quarter of them taught at least some rangaku (Western studies, mainly medicine, military and naval sciences). 

Students would read Chinese books in the morning, then spend afternoons mastering Japanese martial arts, which were seen as a set of local skills that balances the purely intellectual studies acquired from abroad. Students normally started military training at the age of 15 (Japanese count; corresponds to 13 years according to the Western age counting), after the genpuku ceremony. Among the martial arts taught in &quot;han&quot; schools were kenjutsu (sword arts), kendo (fencing), sōjutsu (spear fighting), kyūdō (archery), bajutsu (horse riding), jujutsu et cetera; in over 30 &quot;han&quot;, students learnt combative swimming, suijutsu. Later, gunnery was added to the military curriculum.

=== Chinese studies ===
Confucian studies were seen as the most important part of the education. The &quot;han&quot; school was built around the assumption that all the truth was supposedly already captured in the Chinese classics and could be extracted with diligent study; the idea of the endless pursuit of knowledge that requires constant questioning and discovery was not accepted. A similar approach was prevalent in the Western pedagogical thought of that time, but the association of Western educational system with Christianity and changes in the social order meant that Tokugawa never allowed it.

The educational process was very academic and conservative; its ultimate political goal was to conserve the rigid hierarchical order of Tokugawa Japan. Students read the Four Books and Five Classics, the , other works of Confucian and Neoconfucian thinkers such as Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming, studied Chinese history, Chinese poetry and public speaking, but without any official programme. In class, the teacher would read a passage from a text, which the students then repeated several times while holding copies of the book on their knees; then the teacher explained the meaning of the passage. Students did not interpret the text or hold debates about it: because of the idea that the &quot;correct&quot; meaning of the classics had been long discovered, these activities were excluded from the learning process, appearing only sporadically among the literati.

Learning required the knowledge of Classical Chinese, the language of the Confucianist canon, and of calligraphy. Because of the structure of the government, which was modelled after the Chinese government of that time, Confucian books were useful guides for a state serviceman. The instruction in &quot;han&quot; schools was entirely secular, with no religious leaders teaching, and the Confucian texts were seen as teaching ethics and philosophy, not viewed as a religious scripture. At the same time, most of the schools held the festival once or twice per year.

== History and administration ==
There was no state office overseeing the education in Tokugawa Japan. Because of that, it is not known when the first &quot;han&quot; schools appeared; one of the earliest ones was Meirindō (Sendai), first mentioned in 1629. Prior to their establishment, samurai hired private teachers to get education at home.

Early &quot;hankō&quot; were one-room schools with a single Confucian teacher and a single student; to learn another subject, the student had to hire another teacher. First &quot;han&quot; schools were run by daimyō&#x27;s Confucian advisers, jusha. Exams, graduation certificates and the gradual increase in difficulty of the educational material were introduced in the later half of the Edo period. In the years directly preceding the Boshin War, most samurai children except for the lowest-rank families were educated in &quot;han&quot; schools.

Students usually paid no fees; the schools were funded by the daimyō and by donations from Buddhist temples and private persons. Many of schools also had land plots where their students grew rice and vegetables for sale. They also taught some introductory classes, while the alternating students on duty woke everyone up at dawn, informed teachers that the lecture time is about to start, patrolled the grounds, wrote down the weather conditions and recorded all accidents. The usual punishment for students was detention, in particular, eating alone, and cleaning duty; physical punishment was rare.

The numbers of &quot;han&quot; schools significantly grew towards the end of the shogunate: just a few appeared in the 17 century, and by 1750, fewer than 30 were founded. The establishment of the Kumamoto &quot;han&quot; school in 1755 motivated many daimyō to follow their example, but the biggest impulse to open &quot;han&quot; schools was the Kansei era edict mandating education for the higher administration; in 1751-1867, around 180 schools started working. By the time of the forced opening of Japan in 1853, there were about 250 &quot;han&quot; schools and around 40,000 commoner schools in Japan. Some of the more famous han schools included Nisshinkan (Aizu), Kōdōkan (Mito), Meirinkan (Hagi, Yamaguchi) and two schools in Kumamoto, Jishūkan and Saishunkan.

&quot;Han&quot; schools emulated each other and the Shōheikō, but were not subordinate to it; its graduates taught in a third of the &quot;han&quot; schools. However, the government monitored the schools and punished its personnel for spreading dissident ideas; for example, in 1839 several scholars of Western studies were imprisoned.

In the end of the 18 century, a typical &quot;hankō&quot; included several buildings: practice and lecture halls, ceremonial halls, dojos for physical training and dormitories. Han schools varied in size; bigger schools were more bureaucratic, so some teachers established &quot;shijuku&quot; (), independent schools that generally operated in the same fashion as the official &quot;han&quot; schools, but usually had a focus in a particular field, such as medicine. Students would often live in their teacher&#x27;s house, fulfilling the Confucian ideal of the society being modelled after a family. Some &quot;shijuku&quot; had close ties with &quot;han&quot; schools. Many samurai attended &quot;shijuku&quot; together with a &quot;han&quot; school, or went to a &quot;han&quot; school after finishing a &quot;shijuku&quot;.

== After the Meiji Restoration ==
By the end of the Edo period about half of the &quot;han&quot; schools accepted children of wealthy commoners. In 1869 &quot;han&quot; schools were ordered to accept women and commoners, but almost none applied. The Meiji government abolished the &quot;han&quot; system in 1871 and the Tokugawa system of formal education during the following decades, but they served as a base for the creation of the modern Japanese middle school. Some high schools picked the name of their local &quot;han&quot; schools for themselves, as a sign of continuity.

<doc id="1330842" wikidata="Q4887454" url="?curid=1330842" title="Benefit season">
<text>A benefit season is a method of financially rewarding professional cricketers that is used by English county cricket teams to compensate long serving players.

The system originated in the 19th century to help out professional cricketers who were paid low wages and generally could not play professional cricket much beyond the age of forty. Early &quot;benefits&quot; typically comprised the gate receipts of a designated match. Nowadays, a benefit season comprises a sequence of events such as dinners and auctions of memorabilia over the course of the summer cricket season or the whole year in which the relevant cricket season falls. In almost all cases only one player from a club is given a benefit in each season in order to avoid two or more players competing to attract money from the same people. Until recently, players with less service might sometimes be given a &quot;Testimonial&quot; season or match: the difference appears to have been largely semantic, but for almost half a century one of the less financially sound English first-class county clubs, Derbyshire, made a point of not awarding benefits, but giving testimonials instead. The Australian cricketer Colin McCool was awarded a testimonial in 1959, only three years after joining Somerset.

The player will appoint a &quot;benefit&quot; committee to help him organise his benefit, composed of other current and former cricketers, and any business and professional people with relevant skills and contacts who are willing to help out. All the profits go to the player and they are exempt from tax following the ruling of the House of Lords over the benefit for James Seymour, the Kent cricketer whose benefit in 1920 was the subject of a protracted legal case brought by the Inland Revenue and not fully resolved until 1926.

A player may be rewarded with a benefit season by his county committee about ten years after receiving his county cap, but this varies from player to player, partly because in order for his benefit to qualify for tax exemption a player must not have had a contractual expectation of a benefit. Occasionally a player stays with a county long enough to be awarded a second benefit. Sometimes this is also known as a &quot;testimonial&quot;: an example is Graham Gooch of Essex who had a benefit in 1985 and a testimonial in 1995.

The system has survived into the 21st century even though county cricketers are now reasonably well paid. The amounts raised generally vary from a few tens of thousands of pounds to low six figures. A few players (such as Graeme Hick ) have made over three hundred thousand pounds. The amount that a player makes from his benefit depends on factors such as his personal popularity, contacts, social skills and fame at least as much as on his degree of financial need and the quality of his contribution to his club on the pitch. One aspect of this which attracts particular scepticism is that famous international cricketers, some of whom will retire as millionaires in any case, tend to make more out of their benefit season than less well off players who have never played for their country, and who seem closer to the being the kind of &quot;deserving cause&quot; for whom benefits were first devised. The supporters of the system contend that it brings about two million pounds a year into the English game which would otherwise be lost if the system were to be abandoned.

Since the 1990s the proportion of cricketers who move from one county club to another during their playing career has been rising sharply, and many players who do so never receive a benefit. However, salaries have risen sharply in recent years, and many players prefer to hunt for a better salary rather than stay where they are in the hope of being awarded a benefit at some point. A conventional pension scheme for cricketers has also been introduced to complement the benefit system.

If a county has no player in its squad who is eligible for a benefit but has not yet had one, it may organise a &quot;county benefit&quot; or a &quot;youth cricket benefit&quot; to raise funds for special projects, but these often do not raise much money as many people are more interested in taking part in a benefit if they know that they are helping an individual.

Tax exempt events to raise money for long serving players are also used in some other sports such as football, although they tend to be called testimonials in that case and are usually a single match rather than a season of events. The tax free status of benefits and testimonials rests on a single early 20th century legal ruling, and great care has to be taken by every benefit committee not to breach the rules in some small way which might lead to the player receiving a demand for tax on the entire amount, or to provoke the Inland Revenue into challenging the exemption on an overall basis. However, testimonials for prominent professional footballers have in modern times increasingly become charity fundraisers in which the player donates either a large part or all of the proceeds to one or more organisations.

<doc id="1330847" wikidata="Q2542958" url="?curid=1330847" title="River of Souls">
<text>River of Souls is the twelfth album by American singer-songwriter Dan Fogelberg, released in September 1993. The album features a variety of genres ranging from Celtic, Brazilian, country, and African soft rock. It received mostly positive reviews from fans and critics alike, praising the instrumentation and vocals. However, some of the song&#x27;s topics, which included war and politics, were not well received.

==Background==
In a 1994 interview, Fogelberg remarked that &quot;some people have said this album is really different from what I&#x27;ve done before, but to me it&#x27;s just songwriting. I didn&#x27;t set out to do world-beat music or anything like that. These songs just demanded a different treatment.&quot; 

Fogelberg described the album as &quot;pessimism tempered with deeper spiritual optimism&quot; and &quot;eclectic,&quot; and said his songwriting influences were Canadian singer Bruce Cockburn and South African Johnny Clegg, both of whom incorporated political concerns into their works. &quot;River of Souls&quot; addresses concerns about the environment in &quot;Holy Road&quot;, and the homeless in &quot;Faces of America&quot;, and war in &quot;A Voice for Peace&quot;. 

Fogelberg said he tried to make it a &quot;real musical album,&quot; and that for &quot;The Minstrel,&quot; a song about sailing, he brought in penny whistles and a Celtic harp to give the song a British folk feel. He also noted that he wrote &quot;Serengeti Moon&quot; about 10 years ago, before Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Graceland&quot; came out, and &quot;thought, what am I going to do with this?&quot;

Fogelberg said he worked on the album for three years. He recorded the album at Mountain Bird Studios in Colorado, and Sunset Sound Recorders in California.

<text>Judith McNaught (born May 10, 1944) is a bestselling author of over a dozen historical and contemporary romance novels, with 30 million copies of her works in print. She was also the first female executive producer at a CBS radio station.

==Early career==
Born on May 10, 1944, in San Luis Obispo, she majored in Business at Northwestern University. She married a St. Louis dentist and had two children, a daughter, Whitney, and a son, Clayton, before her divorce.

Before gaining success as a writer, McNaught had previously worked as an assistant director for a film crew, an assistant controller of a major trucking company, president of a temporary employment agency, and president of an executive search firm. She also was the first female executive producer at a CBS radio station.

She met her second husband, Michael &quot;Mike&quot; McNaught, while working as an assistant director for a film crew, working on a movie for a General Motors division. McNaught was the director of public relations for the company. Between them, they had seven children, her two and his five from a previous marriage. Her husband encouraged her to write, buying her a new typewriter and being supportive through the years that publishers rejected her novels.

McNaught&#x27;s first manuscript was &quot;Whitney, My Love&quot;, which she wrote between 1978 and 1982. After having difficulty selling that novel, she wrote and sold &quot;Tender Triumph&quot; in early 1982. She received the book cover for &quot;Tender Triumph&quot; on June 20, 1983—the day after her husband was killed in an accident.

==Success==
&quot;Whitney, My Love&quot;, the first manuscript, was finally published in 1985, after McNaught had proven herself with two successful published novels. Unaware that there were rules that most Regency romances followed, McNaught&#x27;s early novels were unique. Her novels introduced the hero first, rather than the heroine. Unlike the typical Regency, &quot;a light romp with no sex,&quot; her novels tended to be &quot;intensely sensual and witty.&quot; The book is now credited with inventing the genre today known as the Regency Historical. &quot;Whitney, My Love&quot; captured the elements of the traditional Regency romance, but its long length, sensuality, and emotional intensity were more often associated with the traditional historical romances, which were rarely set during the Regency period. Despite the many years it took to sell the story, it was very successful, and its success influenced other editors to solicit manuscripts written in the same style.

At the beginning of McNaught&#x27;s writing career, she was one of a very few authors writing for the historical romance market. By 1985, however, the genre had exploded, and over 50 new historical romances were being published each month, many of them full-length historicals set in the Regency period like McNaught&#x27;s. Despite her years of success in the historical romance genre, in 1990 McNaught switched genres to write contemporary romances, hopeful that she would have a better opportunity to distinguish her work in a less-saturated market. As her career has continued to mature, McNaught has gradually introduced elements of suspense into her writing. Regardless of their genre, however, her books tend to be fast-paced and feature strong, loyal, compassionate, intelligent female characters.

McNaught was one of the first romance authors to receive a multimillion-dollar contract and have her novels published in hardcover, better positioning them for review by major publications. She reached the New York Times Bestseller List for the first time in 1988, and all of her subsequent books have also placed on the NYT Bestseller List. 
After one of her novels placed on the New York Times Best Seller List for the first time, McNaught asked her publisher to change the covers of all future releases. Instead of the common bodice-ripping cover, McNaught wished her books to be packaged with &quot;classy&quot; covers.

In the early 1990s, Coors Brewing asked her to write a book that would appeal to women and could be used by the company to promote its women&#x27;s literacy program. Appalled at the discovery that one in five women was functionally illiterate, McNaught offered to rewrite her almost-completed manuscript, &quot;Perfect&quot; to insert the literacy theme. The change took her an additional six weeks to incorporate. McNaught chose to donate a portion of her earnings from the book to women&#x27;s literacy programs and insisted that each book contain a card giving readers information on how to donate to literacy programs or to become tutors.

She was the keynote speaker at the Romance Writers of America Conference in 1996, and in 1997, Texas Women&#x27;s Monthly selected her among their four favorite authors, with John Grisham, Patricia Cornwell, and Dean Koontz. She has also been awarded a Romantic Times Career Achievement Award and had a Number 1 New York Times Bestseller with the romantic suspense &quot;Night Whispers&quot;.

==Personal life==
While McNaught at one time lived in Saint Louis, Missouri, she moved to Texas after falling in love with Dallas while on a book tour. Her third marriage, to Don Smith, a professional golfer and engineer, ended in May 1993. McNaught described the break-up as peaceful and friendly, and she threw a party for 160 friends to celebrate entering a new phase of her life. As of 2007, she lives in Frisco, Texas. McNaught is active in children&#x27;s charity and with breast cancer causes, and she has recently begun promoting literacy issues. After creating a subplot on literacy in her novel &quot;Perfect&quot;, McNaught asked her publishers to include a response card in the book packaging. Because of its inclusion, thousands of women who had read the book volunteered to become tutors and help people learn to read.

<text>A study guide can be anything that facilitates learning in a particular topic. It may be a textbook or other resource that fosters comprehension of literature, research topics, history, and other subjects.

General topics include study and testing strategies; reading, writing, classroom, project management skills, and certification preparation; as well as techniques for learning as an adult, with disabilities, and online. Some will summarize chapters of novels or the important elements of the subject. Study guides for math and science often present problems (as in problem-based learning) and will offer techniques of resolution.
Academic support centers in schools often develop study guides for their students, as do for-profit companies and individual students and professors. Once only found at local five and dime stores the internet brought about a new era of online sites with study material. Only CliffsNotes survived this transition to the internet. Examples of companies that produce study guides include Coles Notes, SparkNotes, CliffsNotes, Schaum&#x27;s Outlines, Permacharts, and Study Notes.

Some high school teachers or college professors may compose study guides for their students to assist them with reading comprehension, content knowledge, or preparation for an examination. These study guides may be issued as an assignment to be completed or as a comprehensive selection of material assembled by the teacher.

<doc id="1330867" wikidata="Q3161374" url="?curid=1330867" title="James River Bridge">
<text>The James River Bridge (JRB) is a four-lane divided highway lift bridge across the James River in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Owned and operated by the Virginia Department of Transportation, it carries U.S. Route 17 (US 17), US 258, and State Route 32 across the river near its mouth at Hampton Roads. The bridge connects Newport News on the Virginia Peninsula with Isle of Wight County in the South Hampton Roads region, and is the easternmost such crossing without a tunnel component.

When completed in 1928, the bridge was the longest bridge in the world over water. The original two-lane bridge was replaced from 1975 to 1982 with a wider four-lane bridge that could handle increased traffic volumes. In 2005, the bridge carried an annual average daily traffic of about 30,000 vehicles per day.
==History==

The privately owned James River Bridge Corporation was chartered by the General Assembly to build a system of bridges across the James River, Chuckatuck Creek, and Nansemond River, as well as approach roads. On the Newport News end, the bridge simply ended at an intersection with State Route 39/U.S. Route 60 (Virginia Avenue, now Warwick Boulevard). However, a large system of approach roads, including two smaller toll bridges, was built on the Isle of Wight County side. Traffic coming off the bridge reached a Y intersection at Bartlett, at which it could head west over a private approach road past Carrollton to State Route 10 at Benns Church, or head southeast into Nansemond County. The first of the two smaller bridges was the Crittenden Bridge over Chuckatuck Creek (the county line) at Crittenden, and the second, after passing the road to Hobson and Chuckatuck (now State Route 628), was the Nansemond River Bridge over the Nansemond River. The end of the private approach road was at the current intersection of Bennetts Pasture Road (State Route 627) and Lee Farm Lane (State Route 701), where one could go south to State Route 10 (now State Route 337) at Driver. So the James River Bridge System served not only traffic crossing the James River, but also traffic along State Route 10; the 1928 Chuckatuck-Driver Kings Highway Bridge (now State Route 125) competed with the James River Bridge System for this traffic. Projected traffic volumes were not reached, leading to bankruptcy of the James River Bridge Corporation. It was bought by bondholders, headed by a local businessman from Smithfield. The new owners raised tolls, proving unpopular with local residents. Chapter 399 of the Acts of Virginia of 1940 authorized the SHC to acquire the James River Bridge System, consisting of the three bridges and approach roads. The SHC bought the system from the corporation for $5.6 million on September 30, 1949. (equivalent to $ million in dollars).

The $5.2 million James River Bridge was opened on November 17, 1928, by the press of a button in Washington, D.C., where U.S. President Calvin Coolidge, sitting in the Oval Office of the White House, sent an electric signal to lower into place the upraised lift span over the James River channel. Drivers could now choose to cross Hampton Roads on a fixed bridge rather than one of many ferries. The new bridge was narrow by current standards, with a roadway from curb to curb, and railings much less substantial than found on modern structures. The main lift span was long; the other two bridges included bascule spans.

In 1928, State Route 503, a state highway from Portsmouth via Churchland and Belleville to the private approach road south of the Nansemond River, was added to the state highway system. This designation was removed in 1931.
U.S. Route 17 was moved onto this alignment (from one of the ferries) by 1932, and still uses it today.

As early as 1933, the State Highway Commission (SHC) considered taking over the bridge approaches - but not the bridges themselves - from the corporation.

State Route 258, now part of U.S. Route 258, was extended over the Benns Church approach and bridge by late 1943 to reach the new Mercury Boulevard.

In 1949, the sate brought the bridge from the previous owners.

In 1951, State Route 32 was extended from Suffolk over the bridge to end in Newport News, completely overlapped with other routes, &quot;to facilitate the routing of traffic over the James River Bridge System, between points north of Newport News and south of Suffolk&quot;.

In 1955, the state doubled tolls to $1.80 round trip for cars (equivalent to $ in dollars) and $4.00 or more for trucks (equivalent to $ in dollars) in order to pay for repairs, new toll booths, and a new punched card system compatible with the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel. The toll plazas, which had numbered three - one for each bridge - were consolidated to two, one at the south end of the main bridge and one at the north end of the Nansemond River Bridge. Thus the Crittenden Bridge became free for local traffic. In addition, passenger vehicles and light trucks only had to pay at the first booth they reached; large trucks and buses had to pay twice. This meant that light vehicles crossing only the main bridge (for instance between Smithfield and Newport News) only had to pay southbound. Tolls were eventually dropped to 10 cents per axle.

J.W. Luter, Jr. of the local Smithfield Packing Company rerouted his trucks via a smaller, cheaper bridge owned by a Norfolk car dealer.

Tolls were removed on June 3, 1976; the state paid off the remaining bonds at that time. Simultaneously, the parallel Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel opened, and tolls were removed from that facility, the Coleman Bridge, and the Robert O. Norris Bridge. Many considered this an important step in the development of the area.

In 1978, Bicycles, mopeds, and pedestrians were banned from using the bridge; the easternmost crossing for them is the Jamestown Ferry, about upstream. The State Highway and Transportation Commission banned these transportation modes from using the bridge in 1978 &quot;in the interest of safety&quot;, due to high traffic and lack of sidewalks. Once the replacement bridge was completed, they returned to the question in 1983, and decided to continue the ban, since the new bridge also had no sidewalks or sufficient recovery area.
A new four-lane lift bridge was completed in stages from 1975 to 1982. During construction, the two southbound lanes of the new bridge were completed first and carried northbound traffic while the old bridge carried two lanes of southbound traffic until the northbound lanes of the new bridge were completed. When the northbound lanes of the new bridge opened the old bridge was demolished, but a section on the Newport News side was retained for use as a fishing pier. Now known as the James River Pier, it is the longest fishing pier on the East Coast.

At the Newport News end, traffic approaches the bridge at a six-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange, where Mercury Boulevard (carrying U.S. Route 17, U.S. Route 258, and State Route 32 onto the bridge) passes over Warwick Boulevard (U.S. Route 60). After an intersection with River Road and the entrance to Huntington Park, the four-lane divided bridge begins, lying to the southeast a part of the old bridge that remains as a fishing pier. The lift span over the shipping channel, with a clearance of when raised and when lowered, is about 1/4 of the way along the bridge. This allows ocean-going ships to pass en route to civilian port facilities in Hopewell and at the Port of Richmond.
The roadway becomes Carrollton Boulevard on the Isle of Wight County end; after a number of intersections, US 258 and SR 32 turn west at Bartlett towards State Route 10 at Benns Church, while US 17 curves southeast towards Portsmouth.

The nearest upstream crossing of the James River is the Jamestown Ferry (State Route 31); the next fixed crossing is the 1966 Benjamin Harrison Bridge (State Route 156) at Hopewell. When the bridge opened in 1928, the next bridge upstream was the 1913 Mayo Bridge in Richmond.

Downstream, both crossings of Hampton Roads are bridge-tunnels for military reasons: the 1992 Monitor-Merrimac Bridge-Tunnel (Interstate 664) and 1957 Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel (Interstate 64/U.S. Route 60).

The toll building and parking area were used for maintenance workers, police, and tow truck drivers, from their usedness being obsoleted in 1976 up until 2002, when it was demolished after asbestos was discovered. Preservationists have argued the building had historic significance.

Due to severe corrosion of the metal beams that supported the deck of the 86-year-old bridge structure, the James River Pier was demolished and rebuilt with concrete in 2015.

<text>Johanna Helen Lindsey (née Howard, March 10, 1952 – October 27, 2019) was an American writer of historical romance novels. All of her books reached the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list, many reaching No. 1.

== Personal life ==
Johanna Helen Howard was born on March 10, 1952, in Frankfurt, West Germany. Her mother was Wanda Donaldson Howard, a personnel management specialist. Her father was Edwin Dennis Howard, a soldier in the U.S. Army, stationed in West Germany, where she was born. The Howard family moved about a great deal when she was young due to her father&#x27;s military career.

Her father always dreamed of retiring to Hawaii, but he died in 1964. That year, her family moved to Hawaii, likely to honor his wish.

In 1970, when she was still in school, she married Ralph Bruce Lindsey, becoming a young housewife. The marriage continued, the couple residing in Hawaii and producing three children; Alfred, Joseph and Garret, who have made her a grandmother. After her husband&#x27;s death, Lindsey moved to Maine and did not remarry.

== Writing career ==
Lindsey wrote her first book, &quot;Captive Bride&quot;, in 1977 &quot;on a whim&quot;. The book was a success, as have been the forty-nine novels that followed. As of 2006 more than fifty-eight million copies of her books had been sold worldwide, and her work has been translated into twelve languages.

==Style==
Owing to their diversity of settings Lindsey&#x27;s work covers a number of romance subgenres, including historical fiction (medieval, Regency, American frontier, and Viking eras) and science fiction. Her most popular books are a series of Regency sagas about the fictional Malory family (see Family Tree).

Richard Sandomir of &quot;The New York Times&quot; explained,Lindsey set her passionate tales in many locales, including the Caribbean; the Barbary Coast; England as early as the year 873; Norway, when the Vikings ruled; 19th-century Texas, Wyoming and Montana; and the planet Kystran, in a series of science-fiction bodice-rippers.

== Legacy ==

The covers of Lindsey&#x27;s novels have been parodied, fitting in as they do with a trend in romance publishing to use gaudy painted designs that feature a muscular male model with his chest exposed, towering above or otherwise dominating floridly dressed women.

In December 2019, her son Alfred announced that Lindsey died on October 27, 2019, at the age of 67. The cause of death was Stage 4 lung cancer.
Italian model Fabio was often featured on the cover of Lindsey&#x27;s work. In 1987, Fabio first appeared on Lindsey&#x27;s novel &quot;Hearts Aflame&quot;, painted by Elaine Duillo. This has been credited with launching Fabio&#x27;s career as a male model. By 1992, over 55,000,000 romance novels featuring Fabio were sold. Fabio expressed his condolences in 2019 upon hearing of Lindsey&#x27;s death:I loved being featured on her covers. To this day, &quot;Man of My Dreams&quot; is still one of my all time favorites. Rest in peace, Johanna. Thank you for sharing your gift. You will be missed.

<text>A Dirty Shame is a 2004 American satirical sex comedy film written and directed by John Waters and starring Tracey Ullman, Johnny Knoxville, Selma Blair, and Chris Isaak. It follows a community in suburban Baltimore divided between people with highly conservative attitudes towards sexuality, and those who have been turned into sex addicts after experiencing concussions.

After premiering at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival, &quot;A Dirty Shame&quot; was released in the United States on September 17, 2004. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Due to its sexual themes and content, it received an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, which limited the scope of its release and marketing, and it grossed $1.5 million domestically. Due to its poor box office performance, the film has stood as Waters&#x27; last directorial effort for over two decades.

The people of Harford Road are firmly divided into two camps: the neuters, the puritanical residents who despise anything even remotely carnal; and the perverts, a group of sex addicts whose unique fetishes have all been brought to the fore by accidental concussions. Repressed Sylvia Stickles finds herself firmly entrenched in the former camp.

Sylvia&#x27;s promiscuous daughter Caprice, a go-go dancer at a local biker dive-bar, the Holiday House, under the stage name &quot;Ursula Udders&quot; because of her very large N-cup breast implants and has a penchant for indecent exposure.

One day, after leaving Caprice locked up over the garage, under house arrest &quot;for her own good&quot;, Sylvia is smacked on the head by a passing car and meets Ray-Ray Perkins, a local mechanic and self-styled &quot;sex saint&quot; who opens her mind to a whole new world of sensual pleasure, as he and his followers search for the ultimate sex act.

Eventually, through a series of bizarre head knockings, everyone in the Harford Road area of Baltimore becomes a sex addict, as Ray-Ray shoots semen out of his head and becomes the messiah of &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Sexin&#x27;!&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
John Waters decided to make the film after discovering several sexual slang terms and branches existed on the internet, explaining the groups and terminology found in the film. The film was shot entirely on-location in Baltimore on Harford Road which is prominently featured in the film. In a featurette on the DVD veteran stage actress Suzanne Shepherd recalled that when she was cast as Big Ethel, she was completely unfamiliar with Waters&#x27; work and she had no idea what to expect when she showed up for the first script review. Horrified by what she was reading, she became so distraught that she began to cry. She tried to quit the project but Waters and her cast mates managed to persuade her to stay. Paul Giamatti was originally slated to play Vaughn Stickles, but dropped out before filming began.

The film received an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). This caused the film&#x27;s distribution to be severely limited, as most major theater chains don&#x27;t show NC-17 rated films while media outlets are reluctant to carry advertising for these movies. When Waters asked what he would need to cut for them to give his film an R rating, he was told that the ratings board &quot;stopped taking notes.&quot; After Waters unsuccessfully attempted to appeal the rating, the film was released with the NC-17 classification.

==Reception==
&quot;A Dirty Shame&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, with its explicitness both lauded and lampooned. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 53% based on 117 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;John Waters casts his provocative eye towards libido in a sex satire that won&#x27;t leave audiences feeling too &quot;Dirty&quot;, but this sophomoric farce doesn&#x27;t strike a nerve like his best work – a real &quot;Shame&quot;.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

One of the more positive reviews came from Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, who wrote

A gross-out pioneer, Waters has always had more on his mind than delirious, sex-crazed silliness. By allowing people to speak freely about their sexual urges and practices with a bluntness that is jaw-droppingly hilarious, Waters has drawn deeply upon comedy&#x27;s liberating power. The more the sex addicts talk about their hang-ups the more comically harmless they seem, and thus it&#x27;s all the more absurd for the puritanical to try to punish them for their various pursuits of pleasure.

Waters has always harnessed poor taste to lampoon attempts to limit freedom of expression. This raucously gritty and high-spirited film could scarcely be bluer in terms of the language, but from Waters it comes as a gust of fresh air.

Also enthusiastic was Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who wrote

&quot;A Dirty Shame&quot; is Waters unleashed, and wicked, kinky fun for anyone except the twits who rated it NC-17...You may even shed a tear when Sylvia bonds with her daughter by confessing, &quot;I&#x27;m a cunnilingus bottom.&quot; OK, the jokes are hit-and-miss and the plot is nonexistent, but the Waters spirit stays consistently and sweetly twisted. When the cast takes to the streets singing, &quot;Let&#x27;s go sexin&#x27;&quot;, you want to cheer them on.

On the other end of the spectrum was Roger Ebert, who gave the film one star out of a possible four, elaborating

There is in show biz something known as &quot;a bad laugh&quot;. That&#x27;s the laugh you don&#x27;t want to get, because it indicates not amusement but incredulity, nervousness or disapproval. John Waters&#x27; &quot;A Dirty Shame&quot; is the only comedy I can think of that gets more bad laughs than good ones...We go to a Waters film expecting bad taste, but we also expect to laugh, and &quot;A Dirty Shame&quot; is monotonous, repetitive and sometimes wildly wrong in what it hopes is funny.

===Box office===
&quot;A Dirty Shame&quot; opened on September 17, 2004 on one Baltimore screen and grossed $29,384 for the weekend. The next weekend, it expanded to 133 venues, where it grossed $448,914 ($3,375 per screen). It grossed a total of $1,339,668 in the United States and Canada. Overseas, the film grossed an additional $574,498 (as of July 14, 2005), making its global box office total come to $1.9 million.

==Home media==

The film was released on DVD on June 14, 2005. It was issued in its original NC-17 version and in an edited, R-rated cut sold through Blockbuster, Wal-Mart and Best Buy as well as Target dubbed &quot;The Neuter Version&quot;. The R-rated version is heavily censored and removes most of the profanities including altered dialogue such as &quot;sex toy&quot;. Additionally, a scene in which two characters stand naked in their doorway is replaced by one in which the characters are clothed. In an interview, Waters stated that this version is &quot;essentially for brainless people and &#x27;really weird collectors&#x27;&quot;.

Netflix claimed to stream the NC-17 version but for a time, it was the censored version. It has since replaced it with the uncensored cut. A heavily censored version aired on LOGO, a cable channel for gay interest. Despite several internet sites and even the spine of the DVD stating that it is &quot;The Neuter Version&quot;, the Australian release of the film is the NC-17 version with all profanity and nudity intact. It is rated R18+ for &quot;sexual references and adult themes&quot;.

<text>Ron Raphael Braunstein (born June 7, 1976), professionally known by his stage name Necro, is an American rapper and record producer from New York City. He founded his own independent record label Psycho+Logical-Records in November 1999. He is a member of hip hop groups the Circle of Tyrants and Secret Society together with his older brother Ill Bill, and one-half of The Godfathers alongside Kool G Rap.

== Early life ==

Necro was born in Brooklyn, New York City, and grew up in the Glenwood Houses, where he lived for eight years from about six years old to age 14, when he moved to Canarsie, Brooklyn. Born into a Jewish family, he is the son of Israeli immigrants, with ancestry from Israel and Romania. Necro&#x27;s father was a Romanian-born Israeli soldier and his mother an Orthodox baalat teshuva. When he was in high school he was popular among the hip hop fans that went to his school until he got kicked out for fighting in the 10th grade and sold drugs to make money. He constantly read books.

He began his musical career at 11, playing in a death metal band named Injustice. He made a transition from heavy metal to hip hop. In 1988, he started rapping after being influenced by his older brother, rapper Ill Bill. Necro derived his stage name from the Slayer song &quot;Necrophiliac&quot;. Before that he called himself &quot;Mad Mooney&quot;, which was a character from a Clive Barker book. He made his first demo in about 1990 and won a demo battle contest on the Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito show on WKCR-FM. In about 1993, Necro started rapping full-time and made a demo called &quot;Do The Charles Manson&quot;. In 1995, he proceeded to rap on the Wildman Steve and DJ Riz show WBAU 90.3FM.

== Stylistic characteristics ==

=== Lyrical style ===
Necro lists Kool G Rap as one of his biggest influences in terms of multi-syllabic rhyme structure and content, as well as LL Cool J, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, Rakim and the Geto Boys. Necro is also influenced by heavy metal/death metal lyrics, as well as gangster/horror movies, musicals and popular culture.

=== Musical style ===
Necro raps in a hip hop sub-genre called horrorcore.

He has done rap metal and has combined rap with death metal music.
Necro refers to his music as &quot;death rap&quot; to describe his style of ultraviolent hip hop and to distinguish himself from other genre labels created by the media. His music combines death metal beats with explicit raps about violence, death, the occult, drugs and sex.

=== Production ===
Necro is a self-taught musician and has been playing instruments since the age of ten. He started producing hip hop beats in 1989 by looping up records and bought an Ensoniq EPS in 1991. In the following years he produced beats for artists like Non Phixion, Cage, Krist and Missing Linx, who all released independent singles. The first record he produced that received airplay was &quot;No Tomorrow&quot; by Non Phixion in 1996, put out on Searchlight Music/FatBeats Distribution.

The first wave of albums released on Necro&#x27;s label were produced by Necro himself. This includes the debut solo albums of Non-Phixion members Ill Bill, Sabac Red and Goretex after he already produced 7 songs for Non Phixion&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Future Is Now&quot; in 2002 and Non Phixion&#x27;s &quot;The Green CD&#x27; in 2004, and two albums for label member Mr Hyde. In 2009, a beat Necro produced in 1997 was used by Raekwon on his album &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II&quot; for the song &quot;Gihad&quot;, which also featured Ghostface Killah.

=== Death metal influence ===
Since the inception of his rap career Necro has been influenced by the genre of heavy metal, and more specifically death metal, which has altered his path into hip hop. He has been quoted in interviews citing death metal as a key influence for his rhymes, Chuck Schuldiner&#x27;s Death in particular.

Necro has said that he is heavily influenced by the thrash metal albums &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, &quot;Slowly We Rot&quot;, &quot;Leprosy&quot;, and &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, and he has remarked that those albums take him back to &quot;the &#x27;80s when shit was pure&quot;.

Necro rapped over a death metal blast beat on the track &quot;Suffocated to Death by God&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, with the drums being played by Mike Smith from the band Suffocation and has also collaborated with Scott Ian of Anthrax and Dave Ellefson of Megadeth, two members of the &quot;Big 4&quot;, on the track &quot;Evil Rules&quot;.

Necro references heavy metal acts in his rhymes as well. For instance, on &quot;Underground&quot;, Necro states he will &quot;penetrate your skull like a riff from Obituary&#x27;s &#x27;Slowly We Rot&#x27;&quot; and quotes Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; by saying &quot;Taste me you will see / more is all you need / dedicated to / how I&#x27;m killing you&quot;. Over the years, Necro has increased his referencing and collaborations with underground metal acts, as evidenced by his 2004 album &quot;The Pre-Fix for Death&quot;, which features many references and collaborations with heavy metal musicians from Obituary, Hatebreed, Slipknot, and Voivod. In addition, Necro created his own group known as The Circle of Tyrants, named after a song by Celtic Frost. &quot;The Circle of Tyrants&quot; album also contains collaborations with artists from Testament, Exhumed, and Sepultura as well as song titles named after &#x27;80s thrash metal songs such as Slayer&#x27;s &quot;South of Heaven&quot; and Metallica&#x27;s &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;.
=== Concepts ===
Necro is known for releasing conceptual songs. His multilayered, wide-ranging concepts explore how he beats and murders people who aren&#x27;t as tough as him and the creative ways in which he has sex with women. Songs have tackled topics like the Manson murders: &quot;Creepy Crawl&quot;, &quot;Cockroaches&quot;, &quot;Scalpel&quot;, &quot;The 12 King Pimp Commandments&quot;, &quot;Dead Body Disposal&quot;, &quot;The Human Traffic King&quot;, &quot;White Slavery&quot;, &quot;I Need Drugs&quot;, &quot;Food For Thought&quot;, &quot;S.T.D.&quot;, picking up women (&quot;86 Measures of Game&quot;), cannibalism (&quot;Human Consumption&quot;), suicide (&quot;You Did It&quot;), bondage and sex games (&quot;EdgePlay&quot;), watersports and micturition (&quot;Piss&quot;), life as a pimp (&quot;Out the Pocket&quot;), a revenge tale (&quot;Some Get Back (Revenge)&quot;), and war narratives (&quot;First Blood&quot;).

Necro is a devoted fan of the 1983 film &quot;Scarface&quot;. Necro sampled the main character from &quot;Scarface&quot;, Tony Montana, in &quot;Cockroaches&quot;. Necro has also rapped, &quot;I live scarface scenes&quot; in &quot;Gory Days&quot;, and rapped Montana&#x27;s infamous quote, &quot;you fuck with me you fucking with the best&quot;, whilst sampling the quote simultaneously in &quot;asBESTos&quot;. Necro also took the title from &quot;Push It to the Limit&quot; which appeared in the film&#x27;s soundtrack and used the title for his own song &quot;Push it to the Limit&quot;. Al Pacino&#x27;s work besides &quot;Scarface&quot; plays a recurrent theme throughout Necro&#x27;s work. Necro&#x27;s new collaboration with Kool G Rap is called &quot;The Godfathers&quot; as is the movie &quot;The Godfather&quot; that made a star of Al Pacino. In &quot;asBESTos&quot;, Necro raps, &quot;I&#x27;m completely rehabilitated, reinvigorated, reassimilated&quot; which is taken directly from an Al Pacino quote in &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot;.

=== Injustice ===
Necros&#x27; first band was &quot;Injustice&quot; formed in 1986, with Braunstein playing guitar. With this band, alongside his brother Bill on bass and vocals, he played live shows with bands such as Napalm Death, Sepultura and Obituary at the Brooklyn club &quot;L&#x27;Amours&quot;. Injustice recorded their first demo called &quot;The Cursed Earth&quot; in 1989 and their second demo called &quot;Inhuman Conditions&quot; at Josh Silver&#x27;s house in 1990 before splitting up the same year due to not securing a label contract.

== Psycho+Logical-Records ==

Necro founded the independent record label Psycho+Logical-Records in November 1999. In 15 years, Psycho+Logical-Records has released over 40+ albums all available digitally online on over 300+ outlets &amp; physically in stores on CD &amp; vinyl.

== Touring ==
Necro has been performing live since the age of 11. In 2007, Necro played the Download Festival at Donington. Some of the groups he has opened for include Run DMC, Beatnuts, Sepultura, Kool Keith, Insane Clown Posse, Napalm Death &amp; Biohazard. He has headlined for sold-out shows in some of NYC&#x27;s mid-sized venues such as Brownie&#x27;s, Wetlands, The Knitting Factory &amp; SOB&#x27;s.
During the summer of 2009, Necro was a featured artist on the Rock the Bells tour appearing in Toronto, New York, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. On January 1, 2017, &quot;Necro&quot; was invited to participate in the &quot;Juggalo March On Washington&quot;. He accepted on January 2, 2017.

== Directing and Necro films ==
Necro went to Brooklyn College for film for two years where he had access to film making equipment. His movie &quot;187 Reasonz Y&quot; had an anti-cop theme with a police officer getting shot in the head at the end of the film. The film department was repulsed by Necro&#x27;s visions and he received no support from them.

Necro&#x27;s film company has already released three direct-to-video features (&quot;187 Reasonz Y&quot;, &quot;The Devil Made Me Do It&quot; and the &quot;I Need Drugs&quot; music video).

=== Acting ===
Necro has been taking classes on acting and honing his skills in the acting department. In May 2009, he premiered in a short video-film titled, &quot;Triumph Of The Kill&quot; acting the role of a serial killer clown. The short film was premiered on YouTube and MySpace.

He acted in the Safdie brothers&#x27; 2014 film &quot;Heaven Knows What&quot;, playing Skully, and their 2017 film &quot;Good Time&quot;, playing a drug dealer named Caliph.

== Controversy ==
=== Sounds of the Underground ===
In 2007, Necro toured with Sounds of the Underground. On July 25, 2007, he decided to leave the Sounds of the Underground tour. Necro commented, &quot;I decided to leave the tour collectively with my manager and booking agent (both tour organizers) because we felt the tour&#x27;s demographic was not receiving hip hop well. I was facing hostile, disrespectful crowds and had lots of glass bottles thrown at me. It was making a lot of people in the tour crew nervous and there was concern someone might get hurt (NOT ME). It was also being suggested that maybe I tone down my live show and not antagonize the already antagonistic crowd. I couldn&#x27;t roll with that as it&#x27;s not my style. I was holding back enough as it is but there is a line. All the bands on the tour loved us and everyone behind the scenes knew we displayed major heart and never once got fazed by the hostility. We finished every show according to our 25 minute time slot. I will make one thing clear for the haters: we NEVER got booed OFF the stage. Not once. Yes a ton of emo kids booed us at every show, but we had a twenty-five minute set every night and we stayed on stage for every minute of it, and we represented. Every show had at least 200 NECRO fans in the pit tearing it up, and our meet and greets were incredible! It&#x27;s just a shame these little kids are so closed-minded. The majority of the hate was coming from mop top emo sixteen-year-olds who have no clue who the originators of metal are, and didn&#x27;t respect my &#x27;rest in peace&#x27; chant to metal legends (Dime, Cliff, Chuck, Piggy, Sob). As far as the tour organizers and I are concerned, you are my peoples so it&#x27;s all love and I&#x27;m thankful for the opportunity to prove I can represent in a variety of situations. This actually did a lot for me and is just one move in many my team will make to blow NECRO up&quot;.

=== Riot at Vancouver show ===
On Saturday March 21, 2009, Necro had an appearance scheduled at a Vancouver, Canada nightclub (Richards on Richards). When promoters announced that the show was canceled at the last minute, fans became violent and chaos broke out. People began to throw bottles at the venue&#x27;s DJ (DJ Sage of the Vancouver hip hop radio show Urban Renewal Project).

=== Perth incident ===
On June 5, 2009, Necro was fined A$3,000 after breaking the jaw of a man in Perth, Australia. He was arrested at his hotel later that day, forcing the cancellation of his show at Perth&#x27;s Hyde Park Hotel. He pleaded guilty to the crime.

=== Ani Difranco ===
On May 18, 2010, Necro released &quot;DIE!&quot; On July 17, 2010, Necro revealed (through his website&#x27;s forum) that he is being sued by Ani Difranco due to sampling her song &quot;Used to You&quot; for the track &quot;The Asshole Anthem&quot;. iTunes and Amazon subsequently removed the album from their stores, and Necro re-released the album without this track included.

=== Inspiration in Tori Stafford&#x27;s murder ===
On March 23, 2012, jurors in the Tori Stafford murder trial in London, Ontario, were presented with a connection between Necro&#x27;s music and Tori&#x27;s admitted killer.

The court in the trial of Michael Rafferty heard testimony from convicted murderer Terri-Lynne McClintic that she listened to Necro the day she abducted Tori. Rafferty&#x27;s defense attorney also noted similarities between the song &quot;Garbage Bag&quot; and letters McClintic had written when she was in a youth facility in 2007 and 2008; the letters described the hypothetical torture and murder of a person. At 5:12pm on April 8, 2009, the day of the murder, Terri-Lynne McClintic was positively identified as purchasing garbage bags. 8-year-old Tori Stafford had been found dead in a green garbage bag on July 19, 2009.

Necro issued a press statement on March 23, 2012, saying he does not support &quot;anything that brings harm to children&quot; and that he believes he has been unfairly blamed for the actions of some of his fans.

<text>The (Sega Sound Team) was Sega&#x27;s official in-house band from 1988 to 1993, specializing in rock versions of Sega arcade game themes for Japan-only compilation albums and festival appearances. Consisting of six musicians who worked in Sega&#x27;s sound department at the time, the band included keyboardists Hiroshi Kawaguchi, Katsuhiro Hayashi, and Kimitaka Matsumae; guitarists Koichi Namiki and Jouji Iijima; bassists Sachio Ogawa and Shingo Komori; and drummer Takehiko Tanabe. Kawaguchi and Komori left the band in 1990 and were replaced by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi on keyboards and Masato Saito on bass, respectively.

Usually, some of these albums that were released would consists of two especially recorded versions of the game soundtrack and the rest would consist of the game&#x27;s original soundtrack. After the group split, the members resumed work on Sega projects. Mitsuyoshi composed the soundtrack to &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, &quot;Daytona USA&quot; and the two installments of &quot;Shenmue&quot;, while Matsumae would be involved in &quot;Sega Rally&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot;.

Although the original group disbanded in 1993, in 2011, former members of the band reunited under the name &quot;Blind Spot&quot;, still regularly releasing albums and performing concerts as of 2021.

<text>No Resemblance Whatsoever is a collaboration album by American singer-songwriter Dan Fogelberg and jazz flutist Tim Weisberg, released in 1995. The cover art was a current picture of the two in a pose similar to that on the cover of their 1978 collaboration &quot;Twin Sons of Different Mothers&quot;. The album title was a comedic reference to the pair who once looked somewhat like brothers (per the album title of their last collaboration), but now not so much with their clean-shaven faces and the passage of 17 years. This particular album, according to Fogelberg, only took 10 days to record. Weisberg sued Fogelberg in 1997 claiming fraud and breach of contract over money Weisberg claimed was owed to him from the album sales and the subsequent tour.

<text>Cricket has a considerably lower profile in Scotland than it has in neighbouring England. Scotland is not one of the twelve leading cricketing nations which play Test matches, but the Scottish national team is now allowed to play full One Day Internationals even outside the Cricket World Cup, in which Scotland competed in 1999, 2007, and 2015. Scotland has a well established recreational cricket structure. In 2016 it was estimated that around 17,000 people play cricket in Scotland. At international level, Scotland is ranked as one of the highest &#x27;associate&#x27; (non Test) teams, and has historic rivalries both with its neighbouring full members England and Ireland, and fellow high ranked associate, Netherlands.

==History==
Cricket in Scotland is at least 225 years old. The first match for which records are available was played in September 1785 at Schaw Park, Alloa. The game was more generally introduced to Scotland by English soldiers garrisoned in the country in the years following the Jacobite rising led by Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745; and it is no coincidence that the oldest known club is Kelso (records date back to 1820), in the Borders, then a garrison town. The origins of cricket in Perth, where cricket was also played at a very early stage, was also for the same reason.

In other areas, including the Borders of Scotland, the game seems to have been introduced by immigrant English workers in the paper, textile and iron industries, while in Edinburgh the game was taken up in the mid nineteenth century by the main Schools in the area, most prominently initially by the Royal High School &amp; Edinburgh Academy.

The first representative game of any standing was in 1849, when the All England XI came to Edinburgh to play a 22-man team representing Scotland. This match provoked great interest and similar visits followed over the next few years, representative games also being played in other Cities &amp; Towns. Scotland matches played on an eleven a side basis date from 1865, against a total of more than 30 countries, including all the Test-playing nations, and numerous other select teams, including, of course, the MCC. But the development of Scotland&#x27;s international standing was more-or-less ignored for the best part of the 20th century, with three-day matches against Ireland, MCC, touring Test teams and the occasional County side being the only ones granted &#x27;first-class&#x27; status.

In 1980, Scotland was invited to take part in England&#x27;s Benson and Hedges Cup and NatWest Trophy one-day competitions. In a further development, Scotland resigned from membership of the UK Cricket Council in 1992, effectively severing links with England in the cricketing sense, and in 1994 was elected to Associate Membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC). This gave Scotland its own voice in world cricket and the national team took part for the first time in the ICC Trophy held in Kuala Lumpur in March/April 1997. Third place qualified Scotland for the ICC World Cup in 1999 hosted by England, and Scotland themselves hosted two games (against New Zealand &amp; Bangladesh) at The Grange Club in Edinburgh.

Although failing to qualify for the 2003 World Cup, Scotland made significant inroads in professionalising the game in Scotland. The first part of this was Scotland&#x27;s acceptance into the English Sunday League competition in 2003, for a period of three years. This involved playing a minimum of 18 matches of top class cricket against the English counties, giving both players and administrators the level of experience necessary for Scotland&#x27;s progress to One-Day International status.

In a halcyon period for the Scotland International side, they won the inaugural (three-day) ICC Intercontinental Cup in November 2004, and then the 2005 ICC Trophy in Dublin by beating old rivals Ireland, putting the Scots into 12th place in the global rankings. This gave Scotland qualification for the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. Placed in the hardest Group, no successes were achieved in the Tournament and there was further disappointment at not achieving qualification for the 2011 World Cup.

The International teams then entered a transitional phase, with the retiral of several key players from the previous few years. It was 2011 before Scotland emerged with a fully competitive team, most notably winning four consecutive One Day Internationals against Afghanistan, Netherlands (twice) and Ireland. Following defeat by Sri Lanka, they continued a successful path by beating Northamptonshire and Warwickshire on consecutive days in the CB40 Competition.

==Administration==
The governing body for Scottish cricket is Cricket Scotland, which administers women&#x27;s cricket and junior cricket as well as the men&#x27;s game.

The then Scottish Cricket Union resigned from the UK Cricket Council in 1992, effectively severing links with the organisation of cricket in England and Wales. In 1994 Scotland became an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council.

==Men&#x27;s national team==

The Scottish men&#x27;s team competed in the Cricket World Cup in 1999. It lost all five of its matches and was eliminated in the preliminary round. Scotland failed to qualify for the 2003 World Cup but qualified for the 2007 event in the West Indies. Scotland won the qualifying tournament, the ICC Trophy, in Ireland in 2005. Scotland played Australia, South Africa and the Netherlands in the opening group stage in 2007. Most of the members of Scotland&#x27;s national team are amateurs, although a few Scots have played professionally in English domestic cricket, and for the England national team, including former captain Mike Denness.

In 2003, the Scottish team was granted a place in the English national one day cricket league in the hope that playing against professional cricketers on a regular basis would improve the performance level of the best Scottish cricketers.

The Scottish national team qualified for the 2007 2009, 2016, 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cup tournaments, qualifying for the main round for the first time at the 2021 Tournament.

They have also qualified for the upcoming edition of the T20 World Cup which will be hosted by West Indies and United States in June 2024.

==Domestic cricket==
===Amateur cricket leagues===
Scotland has amateur cricket leagues held throughout the country which are run by five associations: 
* The East of Scotland Cricket Association - 9 leagues, 81 teams &amp; a Sunday Development League 
* The Western District Cricket Union - 6 leagues, 57 teams &amp; 2 Sunday Leagues, 13 teams 
* The Strathmore &amp; Perthshire Cricket Union - 3 leagues, 28 teams &amp; a Sunday Recreation &amp; Development League 
* The North East Scotland Cricket SCIO - 3 &quot;grades&quot;, 29 teams 
* The North of Scotland Cricket Association - 7 team Senior League &amp; 9 team Development League 

In addition to leagues ran by the 5 associations, there is also the Eastern Premier League, which is a combined top level 10 team league for sides from East of Scotland Cricket Association and the Strathmore &amp; Perthshire Cricket Union.

===The Regional Series===
The Regional Pro Series was first launched in 2016 replacing the North Sea Pro Series a competition which was a joint venture between the Royal Dutch Cricket Board and Cricket Scotland. It is Scotland&#x27;s premier domestic competition. The tournament consists of three teams; Western Warriors, Eastern Knights and Caledonian Highlanders. Each team is based in a different region of Scotland.

==Twenty20 cricket==
The first season of the European T20 league, a Twenty20 franchise-based tournament, was scheduled to start in August 2019.

==Notable Scottish cricketers==
One of the most notable cricketers in history was a Scot, born in India of Scottish parents, Douglas Jardine, the inventor of &quot;Leg Theory&quot;. Jardine was born in British India, brought up in St Andrews, spent most of his life in England, died in Switzerland and his ashes were scattered in Perthshire. He gave his own children Scottish names.

A number of other prominent cricketers have come from Scotland, including the former England captain,Mike Denness, Warwickshire all-rounder Dougie Brown, and former England test players Gavin Hamilton and Gregor MacGregor, who represented Scotland at rugby as well as England at cricket.

Another notable Scottish cricketer was Brian Hardie, who was a major contributor to the successful Essex side of the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s. One of the most successful Scottish spinners, and a respected journalist, was Ian Peebles, who was one of the cricketers of the year in 1931 alongside Donald Bradman.

R. C. Robertson-Glasgow played for Oxford University and Somerset and later became a prominent cricket writer and correspondent. The South African-born former England captain Tony Greig also qualified to play for England due to his Scottish parentage.

Finally Scots have also played for other countries: Tom Campbell for South Africa and Archie Jackson for Australia.

<doc id="1330901" wikidata="Q200972" url="?curid=1330901" title="Coat of arms of New Zealand">
<text>The coat of arms of New Zealand () is the heraldic symbol representing the South Pacific island country of New Zealand. Its design reflects New Zealand&#x27;s history as a bicultural nation, with Zealandia, a European female figure on one side and a Māori rangatira (chief) on the other. The symbols on the central shield represent New Zealand&#x27;s trade, agriculture and industry, and a Crown represents New Zealand&#x27;s status as a constitutional monarchy.

The arms were granted by warrant of King George V on 26 August 1911, and modified by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956. While the use of the coat of arms is restricted to the New Zealand Government, the symbol enjoys wide use on state decorations; it appears on the uniform of the police and is on the cover of the national passport.

==History==
Until 1911, New Zealand used the same royal coat of arms as the United Kingdom.
With the evolution of New Zealand self-government, especially the granting of dominion status in 1907, it was decided that a new coat of arms was required. An official competition held in 1908 received 78 designs. The winning entry was a design by James McDonald, a draughtsman in the Department of Tourist and Health Resorts. Some minor adjustments were made to the design and the arms were granted by royal warrant of King George V on 26 August 1911. The warrant was published in the &quot;New Zealand Gazette&quot; of 11 January 1912.

The central shield has remained unaltered since 1911. It comprises a quartered shield containing in the first quarter four stars representing the Southern Cross constellation (as depicted on the national flag, but with the stars in different proportions); in the second quarter, a golden fleece; in the third, a wheat sheaf; and in the fourth, two hammers (see § Symbolism). Over all this is a pale—a broad vertical strip—with three ships representing the importance of maritime trade and &quot;recalling the 19th-century settlement of the country by European migrants&quot;.

In the original design, the crest was a demi-lion (the upper half of a rampant lion) holding the Union Flag, and the scroll at the shield&#x27;s base featured the then motto of the country, &quot;Onward&quot;.

Although the royal warrant specified the design of the coat of arms, by the mid-1940s at least 20 variants were in use. One month prior to New Zealand&#x27;s adoption of the Statute of Westminster (which formally accepted the full external autonomy offered by the British Parliament) on 25 September 1947, a special committee was formed by then Prime Minister Peter Fraser. Responsible for the &quot;redrawing and standardisation of the Coat of Arms&quot;, the committee consisted of Alister McIntosh, Joe Heenan, Colin Aikman, Frank Corner, Foss Shanahan and Professor John Cawte Beaglehole. One of the committee&#x27;s concerns was that the female supporter looked too much like a &quot;Soviet heroine&quot;. Following the election of the First National Government in 1949, the new Attorney-General, Jack Marshall (later Prime Minister) took up responsibility for the committee. Marshall requested the woman to be re-drawn based on the likeness of Grace Kelly, a favourite actress of his.

Queen Elizabeth II approved a revised version in 1956; she also expressly authorised the use of the St Edward&#x27;s Crown in the arms. That design is still in use today.

==Symbolism==

The coat of arms depicts a shield with four quadrants divided by a central pale:
* The first quadrant depicts the four stars on the national flag, representing the asterism within the constellation of Crux; the second quadrant depicts a golden fleece, representing the nation&#x27;s farming industry; the third depicts a sheaf of wheat for agriculture; and the fourth quadrant depicts crossed hammers for mining.
* The pale depicts three ships, representing the importance of sea trade, and the immigrant nature of all New Zealanders.
* The dexter supporter is a European woman carrying the flag of New Zealand, while the sinister supporter is a Māori rangatira (chief) holding a taiaha (fighting weapon) and wearing a kaitaka (flax cloak).
** The female figure is said to be a depiction of Zealandia, a common national personification of New Zealand during the first half of the 20th century. It also broadly represents all &quot;non-indigenous citizens of the country&quot;. 
* The shield is surmounted by a rendition of St Edward&#x27;s Crown, which has been used in the coronations of New Zealand&#x27;s monarchs. The Crown also represents New Zealand&#x27;s historic ties to the United Kingdom.
* Below is a scroll with &quot;New Zealand&quot; on it, behind which (constituting the &quot;heraldic compartment&quot; on which the supporters stand) are two fern branches, representing the native vegetation.

==Status and uses==

None of New Zealand&#x27;s national symbols—including the flag, the anthems, and coat of arms—are mentioned in the Constitution Act 1986. The official use of the coat of arms was mandated by royal warrant in 1911. The use of state, royal, and viceregal emblems is also protected by the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981.

The arms are a symbol of national sovereignty. As such, official usage of the coat of arms is restricted to the New Zealand Government. The symbol is used as a mark of authority by various government agencies and representatives, including the prime minister and Cabinet, and most courts, including the Supreme Court. The coat of arms also feature on all Acts of Parliament; and on the cover of the New Zealand passport, alongside the silver fern, another popular symbol of New Zealand.

Since 1962, a banner of the arms, defaced with a royal symbol, has formed the sovereign&#x27;s personal flag for New Zealand, for use by the Queen in her capacity as monarch of New Zealand. The flag of the governor-general of New Zealand has, since 2008, featured the shield of the arms on a blue background.

On a few special occasions, such as royal visits or jubilee celebrations, individuals and private organisations can display the coat of arms temporarily. It can only be used or published with the permission of the Ministry for Culture and Heritage.

<text>Lampsacus (; ) was an ancient Greek city strategically located on the eastern side of the Hellespont in the northern Troad. An inhabitant of Lampsacus was called a Lampsacene. The name has been transmitted in the nearby modern town of Lapseki.

==Ancient history==
Originally known as Pityusa or Pityussa (), it was colonized from Phocaea and Miletus. In the 6th century BC Lampsacus was attacked by Miltiades the Elder and Stesagoras, the Athenian tyrants of the nearby Thracian Chersonese. During the 6th and 5th centuries BC, Lampsacus was successively dominated by Lydia, Persia, Athens, and Sparta. The Greek tyrants Hippoclus and later his son Acantides ruled under Darius I. Artaxerxes I assigned it to Themistocles with the expectation that the city supply the Persian king with its famous wine. When Lampsacus joined the Delian League after the battle of Mycale (479 BC), it paid a tribute of twelve talents, a testimony to its wealth; it had a gold coinage in the 4th century, an activity only available to the more prosperous cities.

A revolt against the Athenians in 411 BC was put down by force. In 196 BC, the Romans defended the town against Antiochus the Great, and it became an ally of Rome; Cicero (&quot;2 Verr.&quot; i. 24. 63) and Strabo (13. 1. 15) attest its continuing prosperity under Roman rule. Lampsacus was also notable for its worship of Priapus, who was said to have been born there.

The philosopher Anaxagoras was forced to retire to Lampsacus after a trial in Athens around 434–433 BC. The citizens of Lampsacus erected an altar to Mind and Truth in his honor, and observed the anniversary of his death for many years. Additionally, in his honor, the annual celebration known as the Anaxagoreia was established. 

The people of Lampsacus were pro-Persian, or were suspected of doing so and Alexander the Great was furiously angry, and threatened to do them massive harm. They sent Anaximenes of Lampsacus to intercede for them. Alexander knew why he had come, and swore by the gods that he would do the opposite of what he would ask, so Anaximenes said, &#x27;Please do this for me, your majesty: enslave the women and children of Lampsacus, burn their temples, and raze the city to the ground.&#x27; Alexander had no way round this clever trick, and since he was bound by his oath he reluctantly pardoned the people of Lampsacus.

Lampsacus produced a series of notable historians and philosophers. Charon of Lampsacus () composed histories of Persia, Libya, and Ethiopia, and annals of his native town. Metrodorus of Lampsacus (the elder) (5th century BC) was a philosopher from the school of Anaxagoras. Strato of Lampsacus () was a Peripatetic philosopher and the third director of Aristotle&#x27;s Lyceum at Athens. Euaeon of Lampsacus was one of Plato&#x27;s students. A group of Lampsacenes were in the circle of Epicurus; they included Polyaenus of Lampsacus (c. 340 – 278 BC) a mathematician, the philosophers Idomeneus of Lampsacus, Colotes the satirist and Leonteus of Lampsacus; Batis of Lampsacus the wife of Idomeneus, was the sister of Metrodorus of Lampsacus (the younger), whose elder brother, also a friend of Epicurus, was Timocrates of Lampsacus. Anaximenes of Lampsacus, a rhetorician and historian. His nephew (son of his sister), was also named Anaximenes and was a historian. Aristocles (Ἀριστοκλῆς) of Lampsacus was a stoic philosopher. Xenophon of Lampsacus was a geographer.

The people of Lampsacus dedicated a statue of Anaximenes of Lampsacus at Olympia, Greece.

==Christian history==

According to legend, St Tryphon was buried at Lampsacus after his martyrdom at Nicaea in 250.

The first known bishop in Lampsacus was Parthenius, under Constantine I. Part of the Hellespont, Lampsacus was subject to the metropolis of Cyzicus. In 364, the see was occupied by Marcian and in the same year a council of bishops was held at Lampsacus. Marcian was summoned to the First Council of Constantinople of Constantinople in 381, but refused to retract his adherence of the Macedonian Christian sect. Other known Bishops of Lampsacus were Daniel, who assisted at the Council of Chalcedon (451); Harmonius (458); Constantine (680), who attended the Third Council of Constantinople; John (787), at Nicaea; St. Euschemon, a correspondent of St. Theodore the Studite, and a confessor of the Faith for the veneration of images, under Theophilus. The See of Lampsacus is mentioned in the &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot; until about the 12th or 13th century. The famous Lampsacus Treasure, now in the British Museum, dates from this period.
The bishopric remains a vacant and titular see.

<text>Chesapecten jeffersonius is the fossilized form of an extinct scallop, which lived in the early Pliocene epoch between four and five million years ago on Virginia&#x27;s coastal plain. &quot;Chesapecten jeffersonius&quot; are commonly found in strata exposed along Coastal Plain cliffs along major rivers in southeastern Virginia and eastern North Carolina, and it is the index fossil for the Lower Yorktown Formation.

It is the state fossil of the Commonwealth of Virginia in the United States.

== Paleontological history ==

In 1687, Martin Lister published a drawing of &quot;C. jeffersonius&quot;, making it the first North American fossil to be illustrated in scientific literature.

In 1824, geologist John Finch gathered a large collection of mollusk fossils, including &quot;Chesapecten jeffersonius&quot;, from the vicinity of Yorktown, Virginia, and gave them to scientists at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP).

Scientist Thomas Say, at ANSP, described the species and named it &quot;Pecten jeffersonius&quot; to honor Thomas Jefferson.

== Identification ==

&quot;Chesapecten jeffersonius&quot; is distinguished from other &quot;Chesapecten&quot; species by the number of ribs (9 to 12), and a rather rounded shell edge.

<text>Graham Christopher Stack (born 26 September 1981) is a football coach and former professional football player.

Stack played as a goalkeeper for Arsenal, Beveren, Millwall, Reading, Leeds United, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Plymouth Argyle, Blackpool, Hibernian, Barnet, Kerala Blasters and Eastleigh.

He also played in under-21 internationals for the Republic of Ireland.

==Club career==
===Arsenal===
Stack joined Arsenal in summer 1998, and signed his first professional contract in July 2000. The 2002–03 season saw Stack loaned out to Belgian club Beveren, along with three other Arsenal players. In December 2002, Stack came under physical attack during a Beveren match, as hooligans charged at him. He punched one of the hooligans in the face, and riot police were quickly on the scene.

His Arsenal debut came in a League Cup match against Rotherham on 28 October 2003, a match his team won 9–8 on penalties; Stack scored in the shootout. He played in all of Arsenal&#x27;s five matches in the competition, losing in the semi-finals to Middlesbrough. Stack was on the bench as Arsenal clinched the 2003–04 FA Premier League title at White Hart Lane on 25 April 2004. Stack was loaned to Millwall for the entirety of the 2004–05 season. On his return, he was loaned to Reading, at the start of the 2005–06 season.

===Reading===
Stack joined Reading permanently on 30 December 2005, on a two-and-a-half-year contract. During the 2005–06 season, he made four appearances in the League Cup and three in the FA Cup. On 27 October 2006, Stack signed a three-month loan deal with Championship side Leeds United, whose manager Dennis Wise had previously signed Stack for Millwall. The loan deal was extended to the end of the 2006–07 season on 29 January 2007. Stack competed for the starting position with Neil Sullivan, Tony Warner and Casper Ankergren at various points of the season, but Leeds were relegated at the end of the season.

Shortly after returning to Reading, Stack was signed on a one-month loan by Wolverhampton Wanderers, following an injury to their first-choice goalkeeper Matt Murray. His loan spell was later extended to January 2008, and then again to the end of the 2007–08 season. Stack was released by Reading, following their relegation from the Premier League, on 16 May 2008.

===Plymouth Argyle===
Stack signed a two-year contract with Championship club Plymouth Argyle in July 2008, after training with the club. He made his competitive debut for Argyle on 9 August 2008, with a start against former loan club Wolves. On 27 November 2008, Stack made Blackpool the sixth loan club of his career. However, a month later he returned to Plymouth without making an appearance for &quot;the Seasiders&quot;. He was loaned to Wolverhampton Wanderers for a second time towards the end of the season. Plymouth released Stack from his contract with the club with effect from 1 August 2009.

===Hibernian===
On 24 July 2009, Stack agreed a two-year deal with Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. He made his debut in the Scottish League Cup second round win against Brechin, and retained his place for the following league match against Celtic. Stack established himself as Hibs&#x27; first choice goalkeeper during the early part of the 2009–10 season, but then suffered recurring back problems. Stack returned to the Hibs starting line up on 20 February in a 1–0 defeat against Motherwell, but was again sidelined when he suffered an
eye injury in April.

He made just one league appearance in the early part of the 2010–11 season, partly due to a recurrence of the back injury. Stack regained his place in the Hibs team in February 2011, as new manager Colin Calderwood decided to give opportunities to each of his goalkeepers under a rotation policy. Soon afterwards, however, Stack suffered a shoulder injury that required surgery. Despite that setback, Stack agreed a new one-year contract with Hibs during May 2011. Stack played regularly during the 2011–12 season, but suffered a thigh injury during the Scottish Cup semi-final that caused him to miss the last five league games and the 2012 Scottish Cup Final. Stack left Hibernian at the end of his contract in May 2012.
===Barnet===
Stack had trials with Preston North End and Watford in the 2012–13 pre-season. On 23 August 2012 he signed for League Two club Barnet. He was sent off in a 2–1 defeat against Fleetwood Town on 29 September. He was eventually handed the captaincy in the absence of both Edgar Davids and Barry Fuller (who was vice-captain). After a string of excellent performances, in January 2013, he was given a three-year contract extension until June 2016. He saved a 94th minute penalty in the last ever game at Underhill Stadium, a 1–0 win against Wycombe Wanderers on 20 April 2013. Stack started the game against Northampton in the final game of the season, which they went on to lose 2–0, thus relegating Barnet to the Conference. In the 2013–14 season, Stack became team captain after Edgar Davids&#x27; resignation. Stack won promotion with the Bees by winning the Conference title of 2014–15 with the bees. He lost his place to Jamie Stephens in the 2015–16 season, and left the club in July 2016 despite being offered a new deal.

===Kerala Blasters===
Stack joined Kerala Blasters in a joint player and goalkeeping coach role in August 2016.

===Eastleigh===
After the conclusion of the 2016 ISL season, Stack returned to England to sign for National League side Eastleigh. On 7 April 2018, Stack was involved in an injury time equalising goal (which was credited to Ryan Cresswell) in a National League game against Wrexham. Stack left Eastleigh in September 2018 to take a coaching position with Watford.

=== Chesham United ===
On 26 March 2022, Stack announced via the social media platform Twitter that he has come out of retirement for a temporary stint at Chesham United in the Southern League Premier South, the 7th division of English football, to cover Chesham&#x27;s main keeper because he was unavailable. He made his debut on the 26th March in a league fixture at home to Poole Town. Chesham won the game 3–2 to keep their promotion chances alive. Stack played the entire game.

=== Kings Langley ===
Stack played one league game for Kings Langley in November 2024.

==Coaching career==
Between 2018 and 2022, Stack was a goalkeeping coach at Watford, primarily coaching the club&#x27;s academy keepers. In December 2019, Stack acted as caretaker assistant manager to Hayden Mullins following the sacking of Quique Sánchez Flores. Then, in July 2020, he assisted Mullins again for the final two games of the season after the sacking of Nigel Pearson.

In June 2022, Stack was appointed goalkeeping coach at Championship club Cardiff City, a role he held until February 2023 when new manager Sabri Lamouchi wanted to appoint his own coaching team.

On 6 March 2023, Stack was announced as First Team Goalkeeping Coach at Colchester United, joining as part of newly appointed Head Coach Ben Garner&#x27;s Backroom Team at the League Two club.

On 9 July 2023, Stack joined Maccabi Tel Aviv as First Team Goalkeeping Coach, joining as part of newly appointed Head Coach Robbie Keane&#x27;s team at the Israeli Premier League club. He left the role later that month by mutual consent.

<text>Daniel Karbassiyoon (born August 10, 1984) is an American former professional soccer player who played for English sides Arsenal, Ipswich Town and Burnley. He works as a scout and IT Product Owner for Arsenal in London.

==Early life==
Karbassiyoon was born in Roanoke, Virginia to an Italian mother and Iranian father. He holds dual American and Italian citizenship.

==Club career==
H Karbassiyoon e signed a full contract with Arsenal in 2003, moving from amateur club Roanoke Star at the beginning of the previous season. Having joined as a forward, he adapted his role to that of a left-back.

Karbassiyoon&#x27;s first match for Arsenal was against Manchester City in the League Cup on October 27, 2004, as a substitute for Arturo Lupoli. He marked his debut by scoring a goal in the 90th minute; the match finished 2–1. He then went on to secure a starting spot in the League Cup&#x27;s next round match against Everton at Highbury where a young Arsenal side prevailed 3–1. His final match with the first team saw him play the final ten minutes of a 1–0 defeat against Manchester United at Old Trafford. However, he could not gain any sort of place in the regular Arsenal first team and, in November 2004, he was loaned out to Football League Championship team Ipswich Town for three months, making six appearances for the East Anglian side.

Arsenal released Karbassiyoon in the summer of 2005, after he had played just three times for them, all in the League Cup. He signed for Burnley soon afterwards. However, a series of injuries left Karbassiyoon unable to establish himself at Turf Moor and he was placed on the transfer list at the end of his first season at the club. His contract was terminated by mutual consent in August 2006.

Karbassiyoon had a trial at Dutch team AZ Alkmaar, but wasn&#x27;t offered a contract. Owing to knee injury problems, he retired from professional football in February 2007, at the age of 22.

In April 2007, Karbassiyoon returned to Arsenal as the club&#x27;s North American scout. He has been credited for scouting Costa Rican international Joel Campbell as well as German-born Gedion Zelalem. He has since also taken on the role of product manager within the club&#x27;s IT department.

Karbassiyoon published an e-book, &quot;The Arsenal Yankee&quot;, which detailed his journey from player to scout in 2016.

<text>Alfred Lothar Wegener (; ; 1 November 1880 – November 1930) was a German climatologist, geologist, geophysicist, meteorologist, and polar researcher.

During his lifetime he was primarily known for his achievements in meteorology and as a pioneer of polar research, but today he is most remembered as the originator of continental drift hypothesis by suggesting in 1912 that the continents are slowly drifting around the Earth (German: &quot;&quot;). 

His hypothesis was not accepted by mainstream geology until the 1950s, when numerous discoveries such as palaeomagnetism provided strong support for continental drift, and thereby a substantial basis for today&#x27;s model of plate tectonics. 

Wegener was involved in several expeditions to Greenland to study polar air circulation before the existence of the jet stream was accepted. Expedition participants made many meteorological observations and were the first to overwinter on the inland Greenland ice sheet and the first to bore ice cores on a moving Arctic glacier.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Alfred Wegener was born in Berlin on 1 November 1880, the youngest of five children, to Richard Wegener and his wife Anna. His father was a theologian and teacher of classical languages at the Joachimsthalschen Gymnasium and Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster. In 1886 his family purchased a former manor house near Rheinsberg, which they used as a vacation home.

Wegener attended school at the Köllnische Gymnasium on Wallstrasse in Berlin, completing his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1899, graduating as the best in his class.

Wegener studied physics, meteorology and astronomy at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, completing two external semesters at Heidelberg and Innsbruck. His teachers included Wilhelm Förster for astronomy and Max Planck for thermodynamics.

From 1902 to 1903 during his studies he was an assistant at the Urania astronomical observatory. He completed his doctoral dissertation on the subject of applying the astronomical data of Alfonsine tables to contemporary computational methods in 1905 under the supervision of Julius Bauschinger and Wilhelm Förster. Despite becoming a doctor in the field of astronomy, Wegener had always maintained a strong interest in the developing fields of meteorology and climatology and his studies afterwards focused on these disciplines.

In 1905 Wegener became an assistant at the near Beeskow. He worked there with his brother Kurt, who was likewise a scientist with an interest in meteorology and polar research. The two pioneered the use of weather balloons to track air masses. On a balloon ascent undertaken to carry out meteorological investigations and to test a celestial navigation method using a particular type of quadrant (&quot;Libellenquadrant&quot;), the Wegener brothers set a new record for a continuous balloon flight, remaining aloft 52.5 hours from 5–7 April 1906. His observations during his time at the Observatorium made a significant contribution to the field of atmospheric physics.

===First Greenland expedition and years in Marburg===
In 1906, Wegener participated in the first of his four Greenland expeditions, later regarding this experience as marking a decisive turning point in his life. The Denmark expedition was led by the Dane Ludvig Mylius-Erichsen and charged with studying the last unknown portion of the northeastern coast of Greenland. During the expedition Wegener constructed the first meteorological station in Greenland near Danmarkshavn, where he launched kites and tethered balloons to make meteorological measurements in an Arctic climatic zone. Here Wegener also made his first acquaintance with death in a wilderness of ice when the expedition leader and two of his colleagues died on an exploratory trip undertaken with sled dogs.

After his return in 1908 and until World War I, Wegener was a lecturer in meteorology, applied astronomy and cosmic physics at the University of Marburg. His students and colleagues in Marburg particularly valued his ability to clearly and understandably explain even complex topics and current research findings without sacrificing precision. His lectures formed the basis of what was to become a standard textbook in meteorology, first written In 1909/1910: &quot;Thermodynamik der Atmosphäre&quot; (Thermodynamics of the Atmosphere), in which he incorporated many of the results of the Greenland expedition.

On 6 January 1912 he presented his first proposal of continental drift in a lecture to the Geologische Vereinigung (Geological Association) at the Senckenberg Museum, Frankfurt am Main. Later in 1912 he made the case for the theory in a long, three-part article and a shorter summary.

===Second Greenland expedition===
Plans for a new Greenland expedition grew out of Wegener and Johan Peter Koch&#x27;s frustration with the disorganisation and meager scientific results of the Danmark expedition. The new Danish Expedition to Queen Louise Land would involve only four men, take place in 1912–1913, and have Koch for leader.

After a stopover in Iceland to purchase and test ponies as pack animals, the expedition arrived in Danmarkshavn. Even before the trip to the inland ice began the expedition was almost annihilated by a calving glacier. Koch broke his leg when he fell into a glacier crevasse and spent months recovering in a sickbed. Wegener and Koch were the first to winter on the inland ice in northeast Greenland. Inside their hut they drilled to a depth of 25 m with an auger. In summer 1913 the team crossed the inland ice, the four expedition participants covering a distance twice as long as Fridtjof Nansen&#x27;s southern Greenland crossing in 1888. Only a few kilometres from the western Greenland settlement of Kangersuatsiaq the small team ran out of food while struggling to find their way through difficult glacial break-up terrain. But at the last moment, after the last pony and dog had been eaten, they were picked up at a fjord by the clergyman of Upernavik, who just happened to be visiting a remote congregation at the time.

===Family===
Later in 1913, after his return Wegener married Else Köppen, the daughter of his former teacher and mentor, the meteorologist Wladimir Köppen. The young pair lived in Marburg, where Wegener resumed his university lectureship. There his two older daughters were born, Hilde (1914–1936) and Sophie (&quot;Käte&quot;, 1918–2012). Their third daughter Hanna Charlotte (&quot;Lotte&quot;, 1920–1989) was born in Hamburg. Lotte would in 1938 marry the famous Austrian mountaineer and adventurer Heinrich Harrer, while in 1939, Käte married Siegfried Uiberreither, Austrian Nazi Gauleiter of Styria.

===World War I===
As an infantry reserve officer Wegener was immediately called up when the First World War began in 1914. On the war front in Belgium he experienced fierce fighting but his term lasted only a few months: after being wounded twice he was declared unfit for active service and assigned to the army weather service. This activity required him to travel constantly between various weather stations in Germany, on the Balkans, on the Western Front and in the Baltic region.

Nevertheless, he was able in 1915 to complete the first version of his major work, &quot;Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane&quot; (&quot;The Origin of Continents and Oceans&quot;). His brother Kurt remarked that Alfred Wegener&#x27;s motivation was to &quot;reestablish the connection between geophysics on the one hand and geography and geology on the other, which had become completely ruptured because of the specialized development of these branches of science.&quot;

Interest in this small publication was however low, also because of wartime chaos. By the end of the war Wegener had published almost 20 additional meteorological and geophysical papers in which he repeatedly embarked for new scientific frontiers. In 1917 he undertook a scientific investigation of the Treysa meteorite.

===Postwar period===
In 1919, Wegener replaced Köppen as head of the Meteorological Department at the German Naval Observatory (&quot;Deutsche Seewarte&quot;) and moved to Hamburg with his wife and their two daughters. In 1921 he was moreover appointed senior lecturer at the new University of Hamburg. From 1919 to 1923 Wegener did pioneering work on reconstructing the climate of past eras (now known as &quot;paleoclimatology&quot;), closely in collaboration with Milutin Milanković, publishing &quot;Die Klimate der geologischen Vorzeit&quot; (&quot;The Climates of the Geological Past&quot;) together with his father-in-law, Wladimir Köppen, in 1924. In 1922 the third, fully revised edition of &quot;The Origin of Continents and Oceans&quot; appeared, and discussion began on his theory of continental drift, first in the German language area and later internationally. Withering criticism was the response of most experts.

In 1924 Wegener was appointed to a professorship in meteorology and geophysics in Graz, a position that was both secure and free of administrative duties. He concentrated on physics and the optics of the atmosphere as well as the study of tornadoes. He had studied tornadoes for several years by this point, publishing the first thorough European tornado climatology in 1917. He also posited tornado vortex structures and formative processes. Scientific assessment of his second Greenland expedition (ice measurements, atmospheric optics, etc.) continued to the end of the 1920s.

In November 1926 Wegener presented his continental drift theory at a symposium of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists in New York City, again earning rejection from everyone but the chairman. Three years later the fourth and final expanded edition of &quot;The Origin of Continents and Oceans&quot; appeared.

===Third Greenland expedition===

In April–October 1929, Wegener embarked on his third expedition to Greenland, which laid the groundwork for the German Greenland Expedition which he was planning to lead in 1930–1931.

===Fourth Greenland expedition: Death===

Wegener&#x27;s last Greenland expedition was in 1930. The 14 participants under his leadership were to establish three permanent stations from which the thickness of the Greenland ice sheet could be measured and year-round Arctic weather observations made. 
They would travel on the ice cap using two innovative, propeller-driven snowmobiles, in addition to ponies and dog sleds.
Wegener felt personally responsible for the expedition&#x27;s success, as the German government had contributed $120,000 ($1.5 million in 2007 dollars). Success depended on enough provisions being transferred from West camp to &#x27; (&quot;mid-ice&quot;, also known as Central Station) for two men to winter there, and this was a factor in the decision that led to his death. Owing to a late thaw, the expedition was six weeks behind schedule and, as summer ended, the men at &#x27; sent a message that they had insufficient fuel and so would return on 20 October.
On 24 September, although the route markers were by now largely buried under snow, Wegener set out with thirteen Greenlanders and his meteorologist Fritz Loewe to supply the camp by dog sled. During the journey, the temperature reached and Loewe&#x27;s toes became so frostbitten they had to be amputated with a penknife without anaesthetic. Twelve of the Greenlanders returned to West camp. On 19 October the remaining three members of the expedition reached &quot;.

Expedition member Johannes Georgi estimated that there were only enough supplies for three at &quot;, so Wegener and 27 year-old native Greenlander Rasmus Villumsen took two dog sleds and made for West camp. (Georgi later found that he had underestimated the supplies, and that Wegener and Villumsen could have overwintered at Eismitte.)
They took no food for the dogs and killed them one by one to feed the rest until they could run only one sled. While Villumsen rode the sled, Wegener had to use skis, but they never reached the camp. Wegener died in his tent around 90 miles from &quot;&quot; and was hastily buried with his skis stuck upright in the snow. Villumsen resumed his journey, but he was never seen again. Six months later, on 12 May 1931, Wegener&#x27;s skis were discovered. Expedition members built a pyramid-shaped mausoleum in the ice and snow, and Alfred Wegener&#x27;s body was laid to rest. Wegener had been 50 years of age and a heavy smoker, and it was believed that he had died of heart failure brought on by overexertion. Kurt Wegener took over the expedition&#x27;s leadership in July, according to the prearranged plan for such an eventuality.

==Continental drift theory==

Wegener first thought of this idea by noticing that the different large landmasses of the Earth almost fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. The continental shelf of the Americas fits closely to Africa and Europe. Antarctica, Australia, India and Madagascar fit next to the tip of Southern Africa. But Wegener only published his idea after reading a paper in 1911 which criticised the prevalent hypothesis, that a bridge of land once connected Europe and America, on the grounds that this contradicts isostasy. Wegener&#x27;s main interest was meteorology, and he wanted to join the Denmark-Greenland expedition scheduled for mid-1912. He presented his continental drift hypothesis on 6 January 1912. He analysed both sides of the Atlantic Ocean for rock type, geological structures and fossils. He noticed that there was a significant similarity between matching sides of the continents, especially in fossil plants.
From 1912, Wegener publicly advocated the existence of &quot;continental drift&quot;, arguing that all the continents were once joined in a single landmass and had since drifted apart. He supposed that the mechanisms causing the drift might be the centrifugal force of the Earth&#x27;s rotation (&quot;&quot;) or the astronomical precession. Wegener also speculated about sea-floor spreading and the role of the mid-ocean ridges, stating that &quot;the Mid-Atlantic Ridge ... zone in which the floor of the Atlantic, as it keeps spreading, is continuously tearing open and making space for fresh, relatively fluid and hot sima [rising] from depth.&quot; However, he did not pursue these ideas in his later works.

In 1915, in the first edition of his book, &quot;&quot;, written in German, 
Wegener drew together evidence from various fields to advance the theory that there had once been a giant continent, which he named &quot;&quot; 
(German for &quot;primal continent&quot;, analogous to the Greek &quot;Pangaea&quot;, 
meaning &quot;All-Lands&quot; or &quot;All-Earth&quot;). Expanded editions during the 1920s presented further evidence. (The first English edition was published in 1924 as &quot;The Origin of Continents and Oceans&quot;, a translation of the 1922 third German edition.) The last German edition, published in 1929, revealed the significant observation that shallower oceans were geologically younger. It was not translated into English until 1962.
Note prior advocates for various forms of continental dynamics: 
Abraham Ortelius, Antonio Snider-Pellegrini, Eduard Suess, Roberto Mantovani, Otto Ampferer, and Frank Bursley Taylor.

===Reactions===
In his work, Wegener presented a large amount of observational evidence in support of continental drift, but the mechanism remained a problem, partly because Wegener&#x27;s estimate of the velocity of continental motion, 250 cm/year, was too high. (The currently accepted rate for the separation of the Americas from Europe and Africa is about 2.5 cm/year.)

While his ideas attracted a few early supporters such as Alexander Du Toit from South Africa, Arthur Holmes in England and Milutin Milanković in Serbia, for whom continental drift theory was the premise for investigating polar wandering, the hypothesis was initially met with scepticism from geologists, who viewed Wegener as an outsider and were resistant to change. The German geologist Max Semper wrote a critique of the theory, which culminated in this mockery against Wegener: 

Nevertheless, the eminent Swiss geologist Émile Argand advocated Wegener&#x27;s theory in his inaugural address to the 1922 International Geological Congress.

The one American edition of Wegener&#x27;s work, published in 1925, was written in &quot;a dogmatic style that often results from German translations&quot;. In 1926, at the initiative of Willem van der Gracht, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists organised a symposium on the continental drift hypothesis. The opponents argued, as did the Leipziger geologist Franz Kossmat, that the oceanic crust was too firm for the continents to &quot;simply plough through&quot;.

From at least 1910, Wegener imagined the continents once fitting together not at the current shore line, but 200 m below this, at the level of the continental shelves, where they match well. Part of the reason Wegener&#x27;s ideas were not initially accepted was the misapprehension that he was suggesting the continents had fit along the current coastline. Charles Schuchert commented:

Wegener was in the audience for this lecture, but made no attempt to defend his work, possibly because of an inadequate command of the English language.

In 1943, George Gaylord Simpson wrote a strong critique of the theory (as well as the rival theory of sunken land bridges) and gave evidence for the idea that similarities of flora and fauna between the continents could best be explained by these being fixed land masses which over time were connected and disconnected by periodic flooding, a theory known as permanentism. Alexander du Toit wrote a rejoinder to this the following year.

Alfred Wegener has been mischaracterised as a lone genius whose theory of continental drift met widespread rejection until well after his death. In fact, the main tenets of the theory gained widespread acceptance by European researchers already in the 1920s, and the debates were mostly about specific details. However, the theory took longer to be accepted in North America.

==Modern developments==

In the early 1950s, the new science of paleomagnetism pioneered at the University of Cambridge by S. K. Runcorn and at Imperial College by P.M.S. Blackett was soon producing data in favour of Wegener&#x27;s theory. By early 1953 samples taken from India showed that the country had previously been in the Southern hemisphere as predicted by Wegener. By 1959, the theory had enough supporting data that minds were starting to change, particularly in the United Kingdom where, in 1964, the Royal Society held a symposium on the subject.

The 1960s saw several relevant developments in geology, notably the discoveries of seafloor spreading and Wadati–Benioff zones, and this led to the rapid resurrection of the continental drift hypothesis in the form of its direct descendant, the theory of plate tectonics. Maps of the geomorphology of the ocean floors created by Marie Tharp in cooperation with Bruce Heezen were an important contribution to the paradigm shift that was starting. Wegener was then recognised as the founding father of one of the major scientific revolutions of the 20th century.

With the advent of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in 1993, it became possible to measure continental drift directly.

==Awards and honours==
The Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany, was established in 1980 on Wegener&#x27;s centenary. It awards the Wegener Medal in his name. The crater Wegener on the Moon and the crater Wegener on Mars, as well as the asteroid 29227 Wegener, the Wegener Peninsula in Eastern Greenland and the peninsula where he died in Western Greenland near Ummannaq, , are named after him.

The European Geosciences Union sponsors an Alfred Wegener Medal &amp; Honorary Membership &quot;for scientists who have achieved exceptional international standing in atmospheric, hydrological or ocean sciences, defined in their widest senses, for their merit and their scientific achievements.&quot;

<text>The Diane Linkletter Story is a 1970 16mm short film by American filmmaker John Waters starring Divine, Mary Vivian Pearce, and David Lochary.

==Overview==
This improvised film is based on the 1969 suicide of TV personality Art Linkletter&#x27;s daughter, Diane. In the film, Mr. and Mrs. Linkletter fret about their daughter&#x27;s recent behavior, which includes taking drugs and dating a lowlife named Jim. Eventually, the parents confront Diane, which results in her suicide under the influence of LSD. Waters claims that the film is &quot;accidental&quot; – he and his friends improvised a story while testing a new synch-sound camera (later used on &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot;). The film had a very limited release in the early 1970s, mainly in art houses as short feature before &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;, and gained a wider audience when it showed up on a 1990 videotape entitled &quot;A Divine Double Feature&quot;, paired with a live recording of the off-Broadway play &quot;The Neon Woman&quot;, which also starred Divine.

==Cast==
* Divine as Diane Linkletter
* David Lochary as Art Linkletter
* Mary Vivian Pearce as Lois Foerster Linkletter

==Background==
John Waters stated in a 2015 interview with the British Film Institute that the short is the worst of his works, but that &quot;The Diane Linkletter Story&quot; was ad-libbed and was really just a test of the camera the day it was filmed.

<text>Pierre La Mure (15 June 1909 – 28 December 1976) was a French author.

La Mure was born in Nice, in department Alpes-Maritimes. He published the 1950 novel about the life of the French artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. This book was the basis of the classic 1952 movie of the same name. He later penned the play &quot;Monsieur Toulouse&quot;; a work centered on Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s relationship to Marie Charlet, a prostitute, and his meeting with fellow artist Vincent van Gogh.

<text>Alexander Robert Reinagle (23 April 1756 – 21 September 1809) was an English-born American composer, organist, and theater musician. 
He should not be confused with his nephew of the same name, Alexander Robert Reinagle (21 August 1799 – 6 April 1877), also a composer and organist, who lived all his life in Britain. He was close friends with a young Mozart when he visited London. He was influenced by Haydn, Mozart and Clementi.

==Scotland==

Reinagle was born in Portsmouth, England. His father was a Hungarian professional musician and his mother was Scots. His brother was Joseph Reinagle. He studied music with his father, then with Raynor Taylor in Edinburgh. He went on a trip to London in 1763. He met Mozart and his family a year later. 

At first, Reinagle made a living in the shipping industry, making several trips to the American colonies during the 1770s. In Edinburgh, he taught music and presented several concerts. His first keyboard compositions were published in Glasgow and became popular in the American colonies.

==New York and Philadelphia==

In 1786, Reinagle decided to try his fortune as a professional musician in the newly independent United States of America. He moved to New York City, and, later moved again to Philadelphia, which was the national capital at the time. He helped revitalize the musical life of Philadelphia in the 1790s, introducing that city to the music of Haydn and Mozart, as well as his own original compositions.

One of Reinagle&#x27;s admirers was American President George Washington. In 1789, Reinagle composed a &quot;Chorus&quot;, which was performed for Washington at Trenton, New Jersey, during Washington&#x27;s journey to his inauguration. Later, in Philadelphia, Nellie Custis, Washington&#x27;s step-granddaughter, was one of Reinagle&#x27;s music students. Washington was a frequent concertgoer, and could often be seen in the audience at Reinagle&#x27;s concerts. On Washington&#x27;s death in 1799, Reinagle composed a &quot;Monody on the Death of George Washington&quot;.

In Philadelphia, Reinagle worked closely with Thomas Wignell in producing opera ballets with the New Company, at the Chestnut Street Theater. Reinagle and Wignell produced over 75 programs with the New Company. At Wignell&#x27;s death in 1803, Reinagle moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he became associated with the Holliday Street Theater. He died in Baltimore in 1809, and is buried in Old Saint Paul&#x27;s Cemetery there.

==Reinagle&#x27;s music==

His earliest compositions, from his days in Edinburgh, include a set of duos for two cellos, Opus 2, and &quot;Variations on Famous Scots Tunes&quot;, published in Glasgow and later in Philadelphia. He also composed &quot;Twenty-four Short and Easy Lessons&quot;, a series of teaching pieces for keyboard, which he later used in his teaching in Philadelphia.

Once in America, Reinagle continued to compose short pieces for special occasions, often with titles alluding to American personalities and ideas. Pieces such as his &quot;Federal March&quot;, &quot;President Madison’s March&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Madison’s Minuet&quot; are usually short and in the binary form associated with dance music of the time. Of more interest is the set of four keyboard sonatas. Reinagle composed these when he first arrived in Philadelphia; hence they are sometimes called the &quot;Philadelphia Sonatas&quot;. These are the first sonatas composed in the United States. They are substantial works, each in two or three movements. While they show the influence of C. P. E. Bach (one of Reinagle&#x27;s idols), they demonstrate Reinagle&#x27;s unique approach to form and motivic development.

Much of Reinagle&#x27;s theater music was lost when the Chestnut Street Theater burned down in 1820.

<doc id="1331039" wikidata="Q1370759" url="?curid=1331039" title="Dirac large numbers hypothesis">
<text>The Dirac large numbers hypothesis (LNH) is an observation made by Paul Dirac in 1937 relating ratios of size scales in the Universe to that of force scales. The ratios constitute very large, dimensionless numbers: some 40 orders of magnitude in the present cosmological epoch. According to Dirac&#x27;s hypothesis, the apparent similarity of these ratios might not be a mere coincidence but instead could imply a cosmology with these unusual features:
*The strength of gravity, as represented by the gravitational constant, is inversely proportional to the age of the universe: formula_1
*The mass of the universe is proportional to the square of the universe&#x27;s age: formula_2.
*Physical constants are actually not constant. Their values depend on the age of the Universe.
Stated in another way, the hypothesis states that all very large dimensionless quantities occurring in fundamental physics should be simply related to a single very large number, which Dirac chose to be the age of the universe.

== Background ==

LNH was Dirac&#x27;s personal response to a set of large number &quot;coincidences&quot; that had intrigued other theorists of his time. The &quot;coincidences&quot; began with Hermann Weyl (1919), who speculated that the observed radius of the universe, &quot;R&quot;U, might also be the hypothetical radius of a particle whose rest energy is equal to the gravitational self-energy of the electron:
:formula_3
where,
:formula_4
:formula_5 with formula_6
and &quot;r&quot;e is the classical electron radius, &quot;m&quot;e is the mass of the electron, &quot;m&quot;H denotes the mass of the hypothetical particle, and &quot;r&quot;H is its electrostatic radius.

The coincidence was further developed by Arthur Eddington (1931) who related the above ratios to N, the estimated number of charged particles in the universe, with the following ratio:
:formula_7.

In addition to the examples of Weyl and Eddington, Dirac was also influenced by the primeval-atom hypothesis of Georges Lemaître, who lectured on the topic in Cambridge in 1933. The notion of a varying-&quot;G&quot; cosmology first appears in the work of Edward Arthur Milne a few years before Dirac formulated LNH. Milne was inspired not by large number coincidences but by a dislike of Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity. For Milne, space was not a structured object but simply a system of reference in which relations such as this could accommodate Einstein&#x27;s conclusions:
:formula_8
where &quot;M&quot;U is the mass of the universe and &quot;t&quot; is the age of the universe. According to this relation, &quot;G&quot; increases over time.

== Dirac&#x27;s interpretation of the large number coincidences ==

The Weyl and Eddington ratios above can be rephrased in a variety of ways, as for instance in the context of time:
:formula_9

where &quot;t&quot; is the age of the universe, formula_10 is the speed of light and &quot;r&quot;e is the classical electron radius. Hence, in units where and , the age of the universe is about 1040 units of time. This is the same order of magnitude as the ratio of the electrical to the gravitational forces between a proton and an electron: 
:formula_11

Hence, interpreting the charge formula_12 of the electron, the masses formula_13 and formula_14 of the proton and electron, and the permittivity factor formula_15 in atomic units (equal to 1), the value of the gravitational constant is approximately 10−40. Dirac interpreted this to mean that formula_16 varies with time as formula_17. Although George Gamow noted that such a temporal variation does not necessarily follow from Dirac&#x27;s assumptions, a corresponding change of &quot;G&quot; has not been found.
According to general relativity, however, &quot;G&quot; is constant, otherwise the law of conserved energy is violated. Dirac met this difficulty by introducing into the Einstein field equations a gauge function that describes the structure of spacetime in terms of a ratio of gravitational and electromagnetic units. He also provided alternative scenarios for the continuous creation of matter, one of the other significant issues in LNH:
*&#x27;additive&#x27; creation (new matter is created uniformly throughout space) and
*&#x27;multiplicative&#x27; creation (new matter is created where there are already concentrations of mass).

== Later developments and interpretations ==

Dirac&#x27;s theory has inspired and continues to inspire a significant body of scientific literature in a variety of disciplines, with it sparking off many speculations, arguments and new ideas in terms of applications. In the context of geophysics, for instance, Edward Teller seemed to raise a serious objection to LNH in 1948 when he argued that variations in the strength of gravity are not consistent with paleontological data. However, George Gamow demonstrated in 1962 how a simple revision of the parameters (in this case, the age of the Solar System) can invalidate Teller&#x27;s conclusions. The debate is further complicated by the choice of LNH cosmologies: In 1978, G. Blake argued that paleontological data is consistent with the &quot;multiplicative&quot; scenario but not the &quot;additive&quot; scenario. Arguments both for and against LNH are also made from astrophysical considerations. For example, D. Falik argued that LNH is inconsistent with experimental results for microwave background radiation whereas Canuto and Hsieh argued that it &quot;is&quot; consistent. One argument that has created significant controversy was put forward by Robert Dicke in 1961. Known as the anthropic coincidence or fine-tuned universe, it simply states that the large numbers in LNH are a necessary coincidence for intelligent beings since they parametrize fusion of hydrogen in stars and hence carbon-based life would not arise otherwise.

Various authors have introduced new sets of numbers into the original &quot;coincidence&quot; considered by Dirac and his contemporaries, thus broadening or even departing from Dirac&#x27;s own conclusions. Jordan (1947) noted that the mass ratio for a typical star (specifically, a star of the Chandrasekhar mass, itself a constant of nature, approx. 1.44 solar masses) and an electron approximates to 1060, an interesting variation on the 1040 and 1080 that are typically associated with Dirac and Eddington respectively. (The physics defining the Chandrasekhar mass produces a ratio that is the −3/2 power of the gravitational fine-structure constant, 10−40.)

=== Modern studies ===
Several authors have recently identified and pondered the significance of yet another large number, approximately 120 orders of magnitude. This is for example the ratio of the theoretical and observational estimates of the energy density of the vacuum, which Nottale (1993) and Matthews (1997) associated in an LNH context with a scaling law for the cosmological constant. Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker identified 10120 with the ratio of the universe&#x27;s volume to the volume of a typical nucleon bounded by its Compton wavelength, and he identified this ratio with the sum of elementary events or bits of information in the universe.
Valev (2019) found an equation connecting cosmological parameters (for example density of the universe) and Planck units (for example Planck density). This ratio of densities, and other ratios (using four fundamental constants: speed of light in vacuum c, Newtonian constant of gravity G, reduced Planck constant ℏ, and Hubble constant H) computes to an exact number, . This provides evidence of the Dirac large numbers hypothesis by connecting the macro-world and the micro-world.

<doc id="1331043" wikidata="Q3116311" url="?curid=1331043" title="Gregor Townsend">
<text>Gregor Peter John Townsend (born 26 April 1973) is a Scottish professional rugby union coach and former player who has been coaching the Scotland national team since 2017.

Townsend was previously the assistant coach from 2009 to 2012. As a player, he won 82 caps for Scotland and two for the British and Irish Lions. He is a former coach of Glasgow Warriors and was a player-coach for Border Reivers. As well as in Scotland, he played club rugby in Australia, England, France and South Africa. As coach of Scotland, his team won at Twickenham for the first time in 38 years in 2021. Townsend was selected as attack coach for the 2021 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa.

Townsend was awarded an MBE in 1999 for services to rugby.

==Early life and education==
Townsend was born in April 1973 in Galashiels. He graduated in 1995 from the University of Edinburgh with an MA degree in History and Politics.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Townsend started playing for his local club Gala RFC, where his father had played, and came through from the mini section to senior side.

In 1993, Townsend spent a season in Australia, playing for Warringah in the Shute Shield. He was part of the team that came runners-up to Gordon, losing 23–19. He returned to the club in 1995 after leaving his local side Gala.

In 1995, Townsend joined English side Northampton Saints for the 1995–96 Courage League National Division Two, where he helped the side to promotion to the top English division for 1996. He remained with the club for a further two seasons in the top English division before moving to France to play for Brive in the French Rugby Union Championship. Across the two seasons he played for the club, Brive did not make much success which saw Townsend move to play for Castres Olympique in 2000. In Townsend&#x27;s first season with Castres, the side topped Pool 1 which saw them advance through to the quarter-finals where they defeated Colomiers 37–26. However, Castres failed to make the final after losing to Toulouse 32–21 in the semi-final. Following a disappointing 2001–02 Top 16 season, Townsend returned to Scotland to play for Border Reivers.

After retiring from international rugby in 2003, in December of that year Townsend signed with Super 12 South African side the Sharks. He played a single season for the Sharks outfit before he returned to France to play for Montpellier.

In 2005, Townsend returned home to Scotland for a second time and was a player/coach for the Border Reivers until they were disbanded at the end of the 2006–07 season.

===Provincial===

He played for South of Scotland District in the Scottish Inter-District Championship.

===International===

He was capped by Scotland &#x27;B&#x27; to play Ireland &#x27;B&#x27; on 28 December 1991 and played in the Scotland &#x27;B&#x27; side against France &#x27;B&#x27; in the spring of 1992.

He played for Scotland &#x27;A&#x27; in the &#x27;A&#x27; side&#x27;s first match, against Spain. He received 5 &#x27;A&#x27; caps in total.

Townsend made his international debut at the age of 19, coming off the bench against England on 6 March 1993 during the 1993 Five Nations Championship. It wasn&#x27;t until a year later that Townsend gained his second cap, which was a starting position against Wales during the 1994 Five Nations Championship. He then started the next 35 tests for Scotland before he was next played off the bench.

In December 1996 he represented the Barbarians, playing against Australia at Twickenham. In 1997, he was selected for the British Lions tour to South Africa by Ian McGeechan. He played in six games, including starting against South Africa in the first and second tests.

During the 1999 Five Nations Championship, Townsend scored a try against every other country, becoming the first Scotsman since 1925 to achieve this feat. His efforts across all four games helped Scotland to claim the Championship for the first time since 1990. Later that year, he was selected for his first ever Rugby World Cup, where he played in every Scotland game. However, Scotland failed to progress past the quarter-finals after losing to New Zealand 30–18. In April 2002 he became Scotland&#x27;s most capped player when he overtook the 65 full international appearances achieved by Scott Hastings. He was again selected for Scotland&#x27;s World Cup squad in 2003, and again played in every game. However, Scotland again did not progress past the quarter-finals, as they lost to hosts Australia 33–16. This was his last match playing for Scotland.

Townsend made one appearance, playing for the French Barbarians during his stint with Montpellier, against Australia in November 2004.

====Toonie flip====
This is the nickname given to the reverse pass which Townsend gave to Gavin Hastings for Scotland to register a dramatic and famous last-minute 23–21 victory against France in Paris in 1995.

==Coaching career==

===Border Reivers===

On Townsend&#x27;s return to Scotland, in 2005 he took up a player/coach role with Border Reivers which was where he started his coaching career. After the club disbanded in 2007, he started a Scotland mentoring program in which a number of former internationals gave specialized coaching to rising Scottish players. This included working with the top Scottish clubs, Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors, and the age-grade national sides, while he also worked with the amateur/semi-pro clubs.

===Scotland===

In October 2008, Townsend was appointed as assistant coach for the Scotland A national side ahead of their matches in later that year. In January 2009, he was appointed backs coach for the national side, before becoming the national attack coach the following season.

During Townsend&#x27;s tenure, he helped Scotland to their first win over Australia since 1982 and their first win over South Africa since 2002. He was their attack coach during the 2011 Rugby World Cup where Scotland failed to advance past the pool stage.

===Glasgow Warriors===

In March 2012, Townsend stood down from his role with the national team and replaced Sean Lineen at Glasgow Warriors as their head coach.

In Townsend&#x27;s first season in charge, he maintained Glasgow&#x27;s positioning in the play-offs of the Pro12, but as in the previous season under Lineen, Glasgow were knocked out by Leinster in the semi-finals. As Glasgow continued to build under Townsend, they made their first final appearance after beating Munster in the semi-finals 16–15. They faced Leinster in the final, only to lose 34–12. In Europe, they continued to struggle, finishing bottom of their pool for the second consecutive season.

The 2014–15 season not only saw Glasgow narrowly miss out on the knock-out stage of the European Rugby Champions Cup, with a loss to Bath in their final pool game, but they also made their second consecutive final in the Pro12. In that final, they defeated Munster 31–13 to claim their first ever Pro 12 title. During that season, Glasgow won all of their home games in the Pro 12, extending their unbeaten run at Scotstoun to 21 games. This unbeaten run came to an end when they were beaten by the Scarlets in the opening round of the 2015–16 Pro12 season. During the 2015–16, Glasgow failed to retain their title after they were knocked out by Connacht, who were later crowned champions, in the semi-finals.

The 2016–17 season would be Townsend&#x27;s last at Glasgow, with the announcement of him taking charge of the Scottish national side in June 2017, replacing Vern Cotter when his contract expired. In that season, Glasgow failed to make the Pro 12 play-off&#x27;s for the first time since the 2010–11 Celtic League season. Up until that point, they were the only club to have made all the play-offs under the current Pro 12 format. However, Glasgow did make the knockout stage of the 2016–17 European Rugby Champions Cup, only to fall against Saracens in the quarter-finals 38–13. This was the first Glasgow side to make the top-tier competition play-off in Europe, since the 1997–98 Heineken Cup, though Glasgow did make the second-tier competition knockout stage during the 2006–07 European Challenge Cup.

Townsend left the club with a 62% win rate across all competitions, winning 91 games from the 147 games coached.

===Scotland===
Townsend took over the head coach role for the Scotland national rugby team when the Warriors season finished in May 2017. On 8 May, Townsend named his first squad for Scotland&#x27;s 2017 June tests. His first game in charge of Scotland was a 34–13 victory against Italy in Singapore, which was backed up by a first ever win in Sydney against Australia 24–19. However, their final test on tour, an away game to Fiji, saw Scotland narrowly lose to the Flying Fijians 27–22, to see Scotland lose to the Pacific nation for the first time since 1998, the last time they played in Suva. Townsend led Scotland to a successful Autumn Internationals campaign, defeating Samoa 44–38 and Australia 53–24, which was a record winning margin for Scotland over Australia. Scotland also came within moments of defeating New Zealand, losing 17–22. Had it not been for a try saving tackle in the dying seconds of the game from Beauden Barrett, the score could have been equalized ahead of a potential match winning conversion.

Despite much promise in their Autumn campaign, Scotland started Townsend&#x27;s first Six Nations Championship with a 34–7 defeat to Wales. Scotland returned to winning ways in round 2, defeating France 32–26. In round 3, Townsend led Scotland to their first victory over England since 2010, winning 25–13, their largest winning victory over England in a Six Nations game. That victory meant they extended their home victories in the Championship out to 6, something they hadn&#x27;t achieved since their home wins between the 1989 and 1991 Five Nations Championships. Despite creating chances against Ireland, Scotland were unable to come away with the victory, losing 28–8. In the final round, it came down to a last minute penalty from Greig Laidlaw to secure a 29–27 win over Italy, to finish third on the table, their highest positioning since 2013. The 2018 June tests saw a young and inexperienced side travel to the Americas. The first game ended in a 48–10 victory over Canada, however the second test saw the United States claim a 30–29 win to see them earn their first victory over Scotland and a Tier 1 nation in the professional era. Despite this, Scotland went on to claim a record victory over Argentina, winning 44–15.

Townsend&#x27;s second Six Nations campaign started well with a convincing win over Italy by 33–20, with a hat-trick from Blair Kinghorn alongside tries to Stuart Hogg and Chris Harris. Scotland dominated the game until a surprising fight-back by Italy in the last 10 minutes saw the Azzurri score three times to set up a tense finish. A close-fought but chaotic loss to Ireland by 13-22 came the following week, with further losses to France (10-27) and eventual Grand Slam winners Wales (11-18) in the ensuing rounds. In the last game of the competition, Scotland faced England at home in Twickenham. The first half was almost entirely one-sided, with England racing out to a 31–0 lead in the first 30 minutes, until Stuart McInally scored a breakaway try off a charge-down from English captain Owen Farrell. The second half witnessed a stunning comeback by the Scots, with a flurry of tries to Darcy Graham, Magnus Bradbury, Finn Russell and Sam Johnson putting Scotland into the lead by 38–31 with 4 minutes to go before a last-gasp try to replacement English fly-half George Ford, who then converted to level the final score at 38-38. The drawn result allowed Scotland to retain the Calcutta Cup, and was both the highest-scoring draw and the highest-scoring comeback of any rugby match on record.

<text>Francis Barrett (born probably in London around 1770–1780, died &quot;after&quot; 1802) was an English occultist.

==Background==
Barrett, an Englishman, claimed himself to be a student of chemistry, metaphysics and natural occult philosophy. He was known to be an extreme eccentric who gave lessons in the magical arts in his apartment and fastidiously translated Kabbalistic and other ancient texts into English, such as von Welling&#x27;s work, &quot;Philosophy of The Universe&quot; circa 1735, from German (1801). According to his biographer Francis X. King, Barrett&#x27;s parents were humble folk married in the parish of St. Martin&#x27;s in the Fields on 29 September 1772.

==&quot;The Magus&quot;==

Barrett was enthusiastic about reviving interest in the occult arts, and published a magical textbook called &quot;The Magus&quot;. It was a compilation, almost entirely consisting of selections from Cornelius Agrippa&#x27;s &quot;Three Books of Occult Philosophy&quot;, the &quot;Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy&quot; attributed to Agrippa, and Robert Turner&#x27;s 1655 translation of the &quot;Heptameron of Peter of Abano&quot;. Barrett made modifications and modernized spelling and syntax.

&quot;The Magus&quot; dealt with the natural magic of herbs and stones, magnetism, talismanic magic, alchemy, numerology, the elements, and biographies of famous adepts from history.

&quot;The Magus&quot; also served as an advertising tool. In it Barrett sought interested people wanting to help form his magic circle. An advertisement in &quot;The Magus&quot; (Vol. 2, p. 140) refers to an otherwise unknown school founded by Barrett.

According to the advertisement:

==Views==
When writing about witches Barrett stated that he did not believe that their power to torment or kill by enchantment, touch or by using a wax effigy came from Satan. He claimed if the Devil wanted to kill a man guilty of deadly sin, he did not need a witch as an intermediary.

Barrett&#x27;s belief in magical power might be summed up this way:

<doc id="1331060" wikidata="Q7632429" url="?curid=1331060" title="Suburbs of Dunedin">
<text>Dunedin is a city of in the South Island of New Zealand. The principal suburbs of Dunedin are as follows. Inner and outer suburbs are ordered by location, clockwise from the city centre, starting due north:

==City Centre==

The centre of the city is The Octagon, an eight-sided plaza with a central carriageway. This is surrounded by another, larger octagonal street called Moray Place. The main retail area stretches north up George Street toward Dunedin North, and to a lesser extent south along Princes Street and east along Lower Stuart Street. At the end of Lower Stuart Street, 400 metres from the Octagon, lie Anzac Square and the Dunedin Railway Station, with an industrial area and the harbour beyond.

Half a kilometre south of the Octagon along Princes Street is The Exchange, at one time the site of the Dunedin Stock Exchange. The University of Otago was sited here for its first few years before moving to Dunedin North. It was originally called Custom House Square, still its official name.

The city&#x27;s main retail and business area first grew here, at the intersection of Princes and Rattray Streets, with the main warehousing area immediately to the east, south of the roughly triangular park of Queens Gardens. This area, which has been largely renovated and beautified in the first years of the 21st century, is known as the Warehouse Precinct. Queens Gardens contains the city&#x27;s main cenotaph. Close by this to the east lie the Otago Settlers Museum and Dunedin Chinese Garden. Beyond this are the docks at the head of the Otago Harbour. The area to the east of the railway from the docks north to the railway station has been the subject of long-term rejuvenation and redevelopment plans which may eventually see it turned into a district of boutique restaurants and shops.

The central business district has slowly moved north to George Street, although there has been some recent retail development in Crawford and Cumberland Streets, south and east of the Exchange. Immediately above and to the west of the central city is the hilly area known as City Rise, which contains many of the city&#x27;s more impressive old houses. It is bounded from above by the Town Belt, one of the world&#x27;s oldest green belts, designed by Charles Kettle in 1846.

==Inner suburbs==
The centre of Dunedin lies within a circle of hills broken only by the Otago Harbour and Ocean Beach, the latter being a long beach better known divided as St Clair, Middle St Kilda beaches. Suburbs within these hills and along their crest are usually regarded as inner while those beyond are outer. Since this distinction is largely by topography rather than true distance, several &quot;outer suburbs&quot; (such as Wakari and Halfway Bush) lie as close to the city centre as some inner suburbs (such as those in the North East and Leith Valleys) and share many of their features.

The main inner suburbs, clockwise from due north of the city centre, include the following:

===Pine Hill, Dalmore, and Liberton===

Pine Hill is a southern spur of Mount Cargill, the 660-metre volcanic outcrop that dominates the northern end of Dunedin&#x27;s urban area and is topped by the city&#x27;s main television transmitter tower. The hill lies between the valleys of the Leith River (usually called the Water of Leith) to the west and its tributary Lindsay Creek to the east, and looks down across North East Valley. The Northern Motorway, part of State Highway 1 winds north around the hill&#x27;s western flank. The suburb, which sits atop the spur, is four kilometres north of the city centre. Pine Hill&#x27;s 2001 population was 2,259, including the older suburb of Dalmore to the south and the post-war state housing development of Liberton. The latter is home to Liberton Christian School, Dunedin&#x27;s first special-character Protestant primary school. The upper section of Pine Hill (Campbells Road area) is often referred to as Pine Heights. Dalmore is also home to the annual Feastock festival held in a backyard on Fea Street.

===Dunedin North===
The northern end of the city centre is designated Dunedin North. Its main features are the main campuses of Dunedin&#x27;s two public tertiary institutions, the University of Otago and Otago Polytechnic, which are situated along the lower reaches of the Water of Leith. This river disgorges into the Otago Harbour in Dunedin North, close to one of the city&#x27;s main parks, Logan Park (a reclaimed lake), which contains the Logan Park High School and the sporting facilities of the Caledonian Ground and University Oval. The city&#x27;s main indoor sporting arena, Forsyth Barr Stadium is also located in Dunedin North, immediately to the southeast of Logan Park. Dunedin North&#x27;s 2001 population, including the University area, was 7,047.

One of the city&#x27;s oldest cemeteries, the Dunedin Northern Cemetery, is located in Dunedin North, as are the Dunedin Botanical Gardens. State Highway 1 joins the Dunedin road network at a busy intersection at the foot of Pine Hill and North East Valley at the &quot;Gardens Corner&quot;, close to the Botanical Gardens&#x27; northwestern edge.

===North East Valley and The Gardens===
Lindsay Creek, a tributary of the Water of Leith, flows southwest down the long North East Valley at the northern end of Dunedin&#x27;s urban area. This valley, lying between Pine Hill and Signal Hill, houses a residential suburb consisting of one main road with streets heading off it up the steep hills on either side. One of these streets, Baldwin Street, is listed as the world&#x27;s steepest street. The original North East Valley post office was located near the foot of Baldwin Street, but was relocated to the Gardens to be nearer the retail area. North East Valley&#x27;s 2001 population was 4,266.

The southern end of the valley is usually referred to as The Gardens or The Gardens Corner (The Dunedin Botanical Gardens are located nearby). The Gardens Corner contains one of Dunedin&#x27;s main retail areas, and also one of its busiest road intersections - here the Northern Motorway (State Highway 1) joins Dunedin&#x27;s one-way street system. This area includes Dunedin North Intermediate School and several University halls, notably Knox College and Salmond College.

===Normanby and Mount Mera===

Normanby is the name of the northern end of North East Valley, at which point Dunedin&#x27;s urban area gives way to open countryside. The land here is steeply sloping, as it is the foothills of Mount Cargill. The slopes of Mount Cargill itself are densely wooded, and are crisscrossed with walking tracks, some of which start at the Bethune&#x27;s Gully reserve, at the northern end of Normanby. Chingford Park, at the Normanby end of the valley is now a sports field and recreational reserve, but was originally the residence of one of Sam Neill&#x27;s forebears, who was founder of Dunedin Company Wilson Neill. The large house is now gone, but the stone stables still on the site are impressive.

Mount Mera is an area of state housing sitting on the north facing side of the valley, just above Normanby.

===Opoho===

Opoho suburb sits on the western flank of Signal Hill overlooking North East Valley and the Dunedin Botanic Gardens. It is a residential suburb with very mixed demographics, containing student flats, significant numbers of elderly citizens, and the houses of many in the academic community. Above the suburb sits the Centennial Lookout, a memorial built on the top of Signal Hill to mark the centenary of New Zealand in 1940. Impressive views over the city can be gained from here.

===Ravensbourne===
The suburb of Ravensbourne sits on the southern slopes of Signal Hill, close to the edge of the Otago Harbour. It is one of the older hill suburbs in the west harbour area of Dunedin. Separated from the inner city by a quarry at the eastern end of Logan Park. It is dominated by the Ravensdown fertiliser factory at the southern end of the suburb at the harbour&#x27;s edge. Ravensbourne&#x27;s 2001 population was 1,269.

===Shiel Hill, Waverley, and Vauxhall===

Across the Harbour from Ravensbourne are (from north to south) Shiel Hill, Waverley, and Vauxhall. They form a continuous residential suburb at the western end of Otago Peninsula on the flank of Shiel Hill, overlooking Andersons Bay and the upper reaches of Otago Harbour.

===Ocean Grove (Tomahawk)===

Ocean Grove, formerly called Tomahawk (a name by which it is still widely known) lies on the south coast of the city end of Otago Peninsula, in and around the valley formed by the two-lobed Tomahawk Lagoon. It has much the feel of a separate settlement, as it is separated from sight of Dunedin by the bluff of Lawyers Head. Other than the lagoon, its main feature is Tomahawk Beach. The area was the site of coastal defences during World War II, and the remains of lookouts from the era can be found on a hill above the suburb. Ocean Grove is connected by road to Tahuna (which lies to the west), and via a steep road to the ridge road along the centre of Otago Peninsula.

===Andersons Bay, Tahuna, and Tainui===

Andersons Bay is a residential and light industrial zone to the south of the central city and east of South Dunedin. It extends along the former shoreline and across reclaimed land close to the head of the Otago Harbour, with its southernmost point being at the Andersons Bay Inlet at the foot of part of the Otago Peninsula. A major sports facility, The Edgar Centre, is located close to the harbour foreshore just to the north of Andersons Bay Inlet. Andersons Bay&#x27;s 2001 population was 2,532. Dunedin&#x27;s main cemetery, Andersons Bay Cemetery and the golf links of Chisholm Park are located in the smaller suburb of Tahuna, which lies to the south, close to the coastal promontory of Lawyers Head. Between the two is the small residential suburb of Tainui.

===Musselburgh===

Musselburgh (named after the Scottish town) is located at the foot of the Otago Peninsula. It is at the narrowest point of the isthmus (at this point some 1,500 metres wide) connecting the Peninsula to the mainland. Musselburgh is dominated by a series of large rocky outcrops known as the Musselburgh Rise which stand above the eastern edge of the flat area of Saint Kilda. Musselburgh&#x27;s 2001 population was 2,835.

===South Dunedin and Kensington===

South Dunedin is the city&#x27;s second most important retail district, and lies immediately below the major road junction of Cargill&#x27;s Corner some 2,500 metres south of the city centre. The main features of South Dunedin are the railway workshops which cover some 100,000 square metres (25 acres) at the northern edge of the suburb, and Carisbrook (the city&#x27;s former main sports stadium), both of which straddle the border of South Dunedin and Caversham. At the northeastern edge of the suburb, closest to the city centre, is the small residential area of Kensington. South Dunedin&#x27;s 2001 population was 2,538.

===St Kilda===

The beaches of St Kilda and St Clair—properly called Ocean Beach—stretch along the city&#x27;s south coast for some 3,500 metres between Lawyers Head and Forbury Head. The suburb of St Kilda, which until 1989 was a separate borough, is a densely populated residential area stretching across the flat land between the beach and the light industrial areas to the south of the central city. St Kilda&#x27;s 2001 population was 5,904. At the southern end of the suburb lies Forbury Park, the city&#x27;s main horse racing (trotting and pacing) venue.

St Kilda has three pubs, a bowling green, a badminton hall as well as an Olympic-sized ice-skating rink. It is also the home of the St Kilda Sentinel Brass Band, Pirates Rugby Club, Otago Model Engineering Society, Ocean Beach Railway, the St Kilda Surf Lifesaving Club, and a Hot Rod club.

===St Clair and Forbury===

Five kilometres southwest of the city centre, St Clair lies on the lower slopes and at the foot of Forbury Hill. One of the city&#x27;s wealthier suburbs, many fine houses are situated in the tree-clad slopes. Close to the summit of the hill is one of the city&#x27;s top golf courses (St Clair Golf Course) and the ruins of Cargill&#x27;s Castle. At the foot of the hill are St Clair Beach, a restaurant and resort complex, and an open-air heated salt-water swimming pool; the beach&#x27;s sea wall, esplanade and oceanway were rebuilt and renovated in 2004. The beach is one of the South Island&#x27;s more popular surfing venues and is also home to the St Clair Surf Life Saving Club. The small promontory of White Island lies three kilometres off the beach. The twin single-sex secondary schools of King&#x27;s and Queen&#x27;s lie close to the point where St Clair, St Kilda and Forbury meet. The smaller suburb of Forbury is located to the north of St Clair, between it and Caversham. St Clair&#x27;s 2001 population was 4,179.

===Corstorphine and Kew===

Close to the summit of Forbury Hill, and stretching out towards Saint Clair to the south and the outer suburb of Concord to the west is the large suburb of Corstorphine. This suburb, which contains a large proportion of state houses, was built during the 1930s-1950s. Lower down the hill to the east, close to Caversham and Forbury, lies the smaller but more prosperous suburb of Kew.

=== Calton Hill ===
Calton Hill, as its name suggests is an alleviated suburb on the south-western edge of &#x27;inner&#x27; Dunedin. From Forbury Hill lies the spur known as Calton Hill which runs north into the Caversham Valley. Named after Calton Hill in Edinburgh, Scotland, the &#x27;Township of Calton Hill&#x27; was gazetted on the 19 November 1910. There is currently no official census information for population of the suburb, but aerial maps suggest approximately 400-500 households. Five roads form its perimeter: Caversham Valley Road motorway to the north; Riselaw Road in the south-west; Corstophine Road in the south-east (until Sidey Street intersection); and Sidey Street/ Burnett Street in the north-east. The suburb contains 2-3 retail business, but is mainly residential. There is farmland on its south-western border, whilst the direct neighbour suburbs are Caversham, Corstophine, Concord and Lookout Point.

===Caversham and Lookout Point===
One of Dunedin&#x27;s older suburban areas is Caversham, lying in a valley close to the Dunedin Southern Motorway (part of State Highway 1), the main transport access to Dunedin from the south. The suburb contains a small retail area, but is mainly residential. Carisbrook, the city&#x27;s former main rugby venue, is situated at the eastern end of the suburb. This end of the suburb is dominated by one of Dunedin&#x27;s largest industrial sites, the Hillside Railway Workshops. At the western end of the suburb, the valley rises steeply, culminating in a saddle of the motorway at Lookout Point. From here, there are views over the outer suburbs of Burnside, Green island, and Abbotsford. Caversham&#x27;s 2001 population was 5,019.

===Mornington, Maryhill, and Balaclava===

Due west of the city centre, with primary access up High Street, sits the hill suburb of Mornington. Southwest of it is Maryhill, while Balaclava is a small locality to the west of Maryhill. Mornington was originally served by a cable car from The Exchange, with a connecting line running from Mornington to Maryhill.

Maryhill takes its name from a district in the city of Glasgow in Scotland, due to settlers from Maryhill in Scotland many years ago.

===Roslyn and Belleknowes===
The suburb of Roslyn lies atop a crest which forms part of the inner ring of hills around Dunedin. Excellent views of the inner city can be gained from the Roslyn overbridge, which is 1,500 metres northwest of the city centre, and 150 metres above sea level. Several of the city&#x27;s most prestigious schools are located close to this suburb and its northern neighbour, Maori Hill. Its southwestern end merges imperceptibly into Belleknowes. Roslyn&#x27;s 2001 population was 3,957.

===Maori Hill and Prospect Park===

Along with St Clair, Maori Hill is regarded as one of Dunedin&#x27;s more exclusive suburbs. Many fine houses are located among the trees of the city&#x27;s Town Belt, which snakes around the slopes of the crest which surrounds much of the inner city. Unlike neighbouring hill suburbs like Roslyn, Maori Hill was not served by a cable car, possibly underlying its greater degree of exclusivity. Maori Hill&#x27;s 2001 population was 1,956. Prospect Park, a small suburb centred on the park of the same name, is sited at the northern end of the ridge which runs through the hill suburbs south to Lookout Point, overlooking the broad canyon of the Leith Valley.

===Woodhaugh, Glenleith, and Leith Valley===

At the northeastern end of the coastal plain that makes up the central city area, the Water of Leith forms a valley leading between Maori Hill and Pine Hill. In its lower reaches, this valley is broad, and is dominated by Woodhaugh Gardens. 
Much of Dunedin&#x27;s water supply comes from reservoirs in the upper reaches of the Leith Valley. These include Ross Creek Reservoir, the oldest reservoir still in active use in New Zealand. Numerous popular walking tracks traverse the bush-clad reserve land surrounding this reservoir. 
Once a quarry, this is one of the city&#x27;s oldest parks, dating from 1895. The area around the park is known as Woodhaugh and is a popular area for student accommodation, 15 minute walk to the university and the centre of the city. Beyond Woodhaugh, the valley narrows to become Glenleith, a residential suburb which follows the ribbon of the river. Past Glenleith is rough, undeveloped hill country, dotted by small farms. This area and the two suburbs of Glenleith and Woodhaugh is often collectively known simply as Leith Valley.

==Outer suburbs==
Many of the outer suburbs of Dunedin were separate towns until local government reorganisation in the late 1980s, and are still regarded as towns by some Dunedinites. The main outer suburbs, clockwise from the city centre (starting due north), include the following:

===Port Chalmers===
===Maia and Burkes===
Beyond Ravensbourne on the main road to the mouth of the Otago Harbour and the town of Port Chalmers lie the two small settlements of Maia and Burkes (or Burkes Bay). Maia, whose name thought by casual observers to be of Māori origin, was actually named by a former mayor for a character from Greek mythology, Maia, one of the daughters of the Titan Atlas.

===Saint Leonards===

On the west bank of the Otago Harbour beyond Burkes, equidistant between Ravensbourne and Port Chalmers, lies the sleepy residential settlement of St Leonards. This was named by early settler David Carey (after whom Careys Bay, near Port Chalmers, was named) for St Leonards-on-Sea in England, which was the birthplace of his wife. St Leonards&#x27; 2001 population was 729.

===Roseneath===
===Sawyers Bay===
===Portobello===
===Broad Bay===
===Macandrew Bay===
===Challis and The Cove===
===Waldronville===
===Concord and Burnside===
===Green Island===
===Abbotsford===

===Mosgiel===
===Wingatui===
===Kaikorai Valley, Kenmure, Kaikorai, and Bradford===
===Brockville===
===Halfway Bush===

<doc id="1331061" wikidata="Q7749605" url="?curid=1331061" title="The Magus (Barrett book)">
<text>The Magus, or Celestial Intelligencer is a handbook of the occult and ceremonial magic compiled by occultist Francis Barrett published in 1801.

==Contents and sources==
Much of the material was collected by Barrett from older occult handbooks, as he hints in the preface:

We have collected out of the works of the most famous magicians, such as Zoroaster, Hermes, Apollonius, Simon of the Temple, Trithemius, Agrippa, Porta (the Neapolitan), Dee, Paracelsus, Roger Bacon, and a great many others...

In fact, most of the material comes from Agrippa&#x27;s &quot;Three Books of Occult Philosophy&quot; and Pietro d&#x27;Abano&#x27;s &quot;Heptameron&quot;.

Previous demonologists such as Binsfeld (1589) had drawn up lists that comprised a hierarchy of devils, and attributed to them the power to instigate people to commit the seven deadly sins. Lucifer was associated with Pride, Satan with Anger and so forth. In &quot;The Magus&quot; Barrett altered the &quot;roster of devils&quot; and Satan now became a prince of deluders (serving conjurers and witches).

==Publication and influence==
The book was originally published with two books in a single volume, as was common with many texts of this period. It facilitated the modern revival of magic by making information from otherwise rare books more readily available.

<doc id="1331064" wikidata="Q814208" url="?curid=1331064" title="Flocking (texture)">
<text>Flocking is the process of depositing many small fiber particles (called flock) onto a surface. It can also refer to the texture produced by the process, or to any material used primarily for its flocked surface. Flocking of an article can be performed for the purpose of increasing its value. It can also be performed for functional reasons including insulation, slip-or-grip friction, retention of a liquid film, and low reflectivity.

==Uses==

Flocking is used in many ways. One example is in model building, where a grassy texture may be applied to a surface to make it look more realistic. Similarly, it is used by model car builders to get a scale carpet effect. Another use is on a Christmas tree, which may be flocked with a fluffy white spray to simulate snow. Other things may be flocked to give them a texture similar to velvet, velveteen, or velour, such as t-shirts, wallpaper, gift/jewelry boxes, and upholstery.

Besides the application of velvety coatings to surfaces and objects there exist various flocking techniques as a means of color and product design. They range from screen printing to modern digital printing in order to refine for instance fabric, clothes or books by multicolor patterns. Presently, the exploration of the flock phenomenon can be seen in the fine arts. Artist Electric Coffin is known for their many colorful flocked works, including a 50-foot piece in Facebook&#x27;s Seattle headquarters.

Flocking in the automotive industry is used for decorative purposes and may be applied to a number of different materials. Many rally cars also have a flocked dashboard to cut down on the sun reflecting through the windscreen. A view on the present state-of-the-art of flocking can be found in the first international exhibition &quot;Flockage: the flock phenomenon&quot; in the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery &amp; Museum in Bournemouth.

In the photographic industry, flocking is one method used to reduce the reflectivity of surfaces, including the insides of some bellows and lens hoods. It is also used to produce light-tight passages for film such as in 135 film cartridges.

Flock consists of synthetic fibers that look like tiny hairs. Flock print feels somewhat velvet and a bit elevated. The length of the fibers can vary in thickness which co-determines the appearance of the flocked product. Thin fibers produce a soft velvety surface while thicker fibers produce a more bristle-like surface.

=== Flocked fabrics ===
Flocking in fabrics is a method of creating another surface, imitating a piled one. In flocking, fibers or a layer are deposited over a base layer with the help of adhesive. Flocking in fabrics is possible all over the surface or in a localized area as well. Flocking as a decorative art dates back to the 14th century when short silk fibers were deposited on freshly painted walls.

=== Flock fibers ===
Flock fibers are the short fibers that are used in flocking.

==Process==

Flocking is defined as the application of fine particles to adhesive-coated surfaces, usually by the application of a high-voltage electric field. In a flocking machine the &quot;flock&quot; is given a negative charge whilst the substrate is earthed. Flock material flies vertically onto the substrate attaching to previously applied glue. A number of different substrates can be flocked including textiles, fabric, woven fabric, paper, PVC, sponge, toys, and automotive plastic.

The majority of flocking done worldwide uses finely cut natural or synthetic fibers. A flocked finish imparts a decorative and/or functional characteristic to the surface. The variety of materials that are applied to numerous surfaces through different flocking methods creates a wide range of end products. The flocking process is used on items ranging from retail consumer goods to products with high technology military applications.

==History==
Historians write that flocking can be traced back to circa 1000 B.C.E., when the Chinese used resin glue to bond natural fibers to fabrics. Fiber dust was strewn onto adhesive coated surfaces to produce flocked wall coverings in Germany during the Middle Ages.

==Health issues==

Flocking can expose workers to small nylon particulates, which inhaled can cause flock worker&#x27;s lung, a type of interstitial lung disease. Other exposure in the flocking industry can include acrylic adhesives, ammonium ether of potato starch, heat transfer oil, tannic acid, and zeolite.

<text>Viviane Romance (born Pauline Ronacher Ortmanns; 4 July 1912 – 25 September 1991) was a French actress.

Viviane Romance was born in Roubaix, France. She began her career as a dancer at the Moulin Rouge in Paris. She was elected Miss Paris of 1930, and she made her film debut in 1931 with a cameo role in &quot;La Chienne.&quot; Romance caused a small scandal winning Miss Paris because she had a child. She appeared in several films over the next few years, and she made a strong impression in &quot;La belle équipe&quot; (1936). From this time to the late 1950s, she was regarded as one of France&#x27;s leading cinematic actresses and played dozens of femme fatales, fallen women (with hearts of gold) and vamps. Her acting roles after 1956 were few, and she retired in 1974.

Romance was offered, and rejected, a Hollywood film contract in the 1930s. She preferred to make films in her native France. However, she also resided for many years in Italy where she made several Italian language films.

She was married three times, including to the actor Georges Flamant and the film director Jean Josipovici, who directed her in three films.

She died in Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, France.

<doc id="1331072" wikidata="Q1779332" url="?curid=1331072" title="Nysa on the Maeander">
<text>Nysa on the Maeander () was an ancient city and bishopric of Asia Minor, whose remains are in the Sultanhisar district of Aydın Province of Turkey, east of the Ionian city of Ephesus, and which remains a Latin Catholic titular see.

At one time it was reckoned as belonging to Caria or Lydia, but under the Roman Empire it was within the province of Asia, which had Ephesus for capital, and the bishop of Nysa was thus a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Ephesus.

Nysa was situated on the southern slope of mount Messogis, on the north of the Maeander, and about midway between Tralles and Antioch on the Maeander. The mountain torrent Eudon, a tributary of the Maeander, flowed through the middle of the town by a deep ravine spanned by a bridge, connecting the two parts of the town. Tradition assigned the foundation of the place to three brothers, Athymbrus (Ἀθυμβρός), Athymbradus (Ἀθύμβραδος), and Hydrelus (Ὕδρηλος), who emigrated from Sparta, and founded three towns on the north of the Maeander; but in the course of time Nysa absorbed them all; the Nysaeans, however, recognise more especially Athymbrus as their founder.

== History ==
In Greek mythology, Dionysus, the god of wine was born or raised in Nysa or Nyssa, a name that was consequently given to many towns in all parts of the world associated with cultivation of grapes. The name &quot;Nysa&quot; is mentioned in Homer&#x27;s Iliad (Book 6.132-133), which refers to a hero named Lycurgus, &quot;who once drove the nursing mothers of wine-crazed Dionysus over the sacred mountains of Nysa&quot;. 

The town derived its name of Nysa from Nysa, one of the wives of Antiochus I Soter, who reigned from 281 to 261 BC and founded the city on the site of an earlier town called Athymbra (Ἄθυμβρα), a name that continued in use until the second half of the 3rd century BC, but not in the earliest coinage of Nysa, which is of the next century. According to Stephanus of Byzantium, the town also bore the name Pythopolis (Πυθόπολις).
Nysa appears to have been distinguished for its cultivation of literature, for Strabo mentions several eminent philosophers and rhetoricians; and the geographer himself, when a youth, attended the lectures of Aristodemus, a disciple of Panaetius and grandson of the famous Posidonius, whose influence is manifest in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geography.&quot; Another Aristodemus of Nysa, a cousin of the former, had been the instructor of Pompey. Nysa was then a centre of study that specialized in Homeric literature and the interpretation of epics. Nysa was ruled by the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire, the Roman Empire, its continuation the Byzantine Empire, and by the Turks, until its final abandonment after being sacked by Tamerlane in 1402. The coins of Nysa are very numerous, and exhibit a series of Roman emperors from Augustus to Gallienus.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Hierocles classes Nysa among the sees of Asia, and its bishops are mentioned in the Councils of Ephesus and Constantinople. Nysa became a suffragan of its provincial capital&#x27;s metropolitan Archdiocese of Ephesus, I the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
Of the Byzantine bishops of Nysa in Asia, several are historically documented:
* Theodotus took part in the Council of Ephesus (431)
* Maeonius in the Council of Chalcedon (451)
* Sisinnius in the Third Council of Constantinople (680) and the Trullan Council (692)
* Theodosius in the Second Council of Nicaea (787)
* Nicholaus in the Council of Constantinople (869)
* Michael in the &#x27;Photian&#x27; Council of Constantinople (879) on the fate of Patriarch Photius I of Constantinople.

=== Titular see ===
The diocese was nominally restored in 1933 as Latin Titular bishopric of Nysa in Asia (Latin) / Nisa di Asia (Curiate Italian) / Nysæus in Asia (Latin adjective), of the Episcopal (lowest) rank, but it remains vacant, never having had an incumbent.

== Remains ==

There are important ruins on the site from the Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine periods. The well-preserved theatre, built during the Roman Imperial period, is famous for its friezes depicting the life of Dionysus, god of the grape harvest, winemaking and wine. It has a capacity 12,000 people. The library dating from the 2nd century A.D. is considered to be Turkey&#x27;s second-best preserved ancient library structure after the &quot;Celsus Library&quot; of Ephesus. The stadium of Nysa, which suffered from floods and is therefore partially damaged, has a capacity of 30,000 people. The bouleuterion (municipal senate), later adapted as an odeon, with 12 rows of seats, offers room for up to 600-700 people. Other significant structures include the agora, gymnasion and the Roman baths. The 100 m long Nysa Bridge, a tunnel-like substructure, was the second largest of its kind in antiquity.

<doc id="1331074" wikidata="Q1052633" url="?curid=1331074" title="Cee-lo">
<text>Cee-lo is a gambling game played with three six-sided dice. The name is derived from the Chinese name for the game, which is literally the numerical sequence four-five-six (). Although many variations exist, there are certain common rules, including the use of three dice and common roll combinations, such as rolling a 4-5-6 to win, 1-2-3 to lose, and other combinations which establish a point for comparison to rolls by other player(s).
The various sets of rules can be divided into two broad categories according to how betting is handled. In &quot;banking games&quot;, one player serves as a banker, who covers the individual bets of the other players, each of whom competes directly with the bank. In &quot;non-banking games&quot;, each player has essentially equal status, and rules must exist for the players to pool their bets and attempt to win from a common pot.

== Origins and history ==
The actual origins of the game are not clear; some of the earliest documentation comes from 1893, when Stewart Culin reported that Cee-lo was the most popular dice game played by Chinese-American laborers, although he also notes they preferred to play Fan-Tan and games using Chinese dominoes such as Pai Gow or Tien Gow rather than dice games. Gil Jacobs instead asserts the game is derived from passe-dix, with a betting system borrowed from craps.

Cee-lo flourished in Harlem during the 1970s and 80s. The game remains popular in American inner cities, but is more prominent in various New York City neighborhoods such as Harlem, Brownsville, Crown Heights, South Bronx, and Washington Heights, whereas &quot;street craps&quot; remains popular in other American cities such as Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago, and parts of the south. A deadly 2019 Brooklyn shooting was linked by police to a game of cee-lo.

Many hip hop artists have referenced the dice game &quot;Cee-Lo&quot; in rap songs since the 1990s. The references usually come from east coast rappers, including Kool G Rap, Big L, Jadakiss, Nas and Notorious B.I.G. as well as many other hip hop artists, and Cee-lo has seen a resurgence in popularity in American settings. A 2003 Associated Press article presented by CBS News identified Cee-lo as a fad at schools in certain areas, &quot;played for money even by preteens&quot;.

===Alternative names===
In America it is also called &quot;Roll-off!&quot; and by several alternative spellings, as well as simply &quot;Dice.&quot; In China it is also called &quot;Sān Liù Bàozi&quot; (三六豹子), or &quot;Three-Six Leopards&quot;.

== Rules ==
There is not one standard set of rules, but there are some constants that hold true to all sets of rules.

The constants include the number of dice used, which is always three. All rules describe certain winning combinations that can be rolled, and 4-5-6 is always treated as a winning combination for the first player who rolls it (though in some variants without a banker, it may be possible for several players to make a &quot;winning combination,&quot; requiring a second shootout). Besides the winning combinations, all Cee-lo rules include certain rolls that establish a &quot;point,&quot; and there are situations where two or more players will roll and compare their points to determine a winner. If for any reason the dice were to leave the playing area (ex: rolling off of the table and hitting the floor) the player would be deemed an automatic loss.

Cee-lo can either be played with one central player (the bank) making individual bets with each other player, or as a winner-take-all game. The rules for play both with and without a bank are described below, including some common variants of each.

Casual players can still play the game &quot;with a bank&quot;, as it includes rules that dictate when the duty of &quot;being the bank&quot; should pass to a new player.

=== Roll combinations===

Of the 108 potential valid combinations, 27 are instant wins, 21 are instant losses, and 60 establish a point between 2 and 5. The winning rolls (4-5-6, trips, point 6) are collectively called &quot;headcracks&quot;.

=== Cee-lo with a bank ===
By definition, Cee-lo is a banking game, meaning that the players bet against an established banker, and it is a &quot;point game&quot;, meaning that some dice rolls establish a &quot;point&quot; for the player (similar to the popular dice game craps). The basic flow of the banking variant is:
In this game, one person is established as the banker, and all other players make even money bets against the bank. If a player makes a $10 bet, then they stand to either win or lose $10 depending on the roll of the dice. The Banker has an advantage relative to the other players (amounting to approximately 2.7% of the amount bet) because the banker rolls first; this is driven by the number of potential instant wins (27) versus the number of potential instant losses (21).

====Betting====
According to the rules of &quot;Strung Flowers&quot;, each player throws the dice to determine which player will be the banker. The player who rolls the highest total number of red pips (sum of 1- and 4-pip faces on Chinese dice) is the banker.

When one player is established as the banker, they put up an initial stake known as the &quot;bank&quot;, or &quot;center bet&quot;. Once they have placed their stake, and announced the amount, the other players have a chance to cover or &quot;fade&quot; the bank. Starting with the player to the banker&#x27;s left, and proceeding clockwise around the circle, each player in turn can fade a portion of the bank, as much as they like, until the entire bank is covered. Alternatively, after every player has had a chance to make a bet, if the entire bank has not been covered, the banker withdraws the uncovered amount.

For example, if the initial stake is $100, the first player might choose to fade $20, the next player $20, and the next player $60. Then the entire bank is covered and no more bets are placed this round. As an uncovered example, if the initial stake is $100, six players choose to fade $10 each, and no one else wishes to bet, then the banker pockets the unfaded portion of the bank ($40), reducing the initial stake to $60, and plays for only the stakes that were covered.

After all the bets are settled according to the roll of the dice (explained below), if the same player maintains control of the bank, the banker may add as much money as they wish to their stake, or let the bank stand at whatever amount remains after all the bets are settled. After a new round begins, the players fade again just as above, and so the game continues.

Control of the bank can change under certain circumstances. If the banker establishes a point and all the players beat the banker by points in one round, they break the bank. Alternatively, if the banker rolls one of the instant loss combinations (1-2-3 or establishing a point of 1), the bank is also broken. In both cases, control of the bank then passes to the next player to the banker&#x27;s left, who establishes his own initial stake as above. Otherwise, the first player to beat the banker by rolling 4-5-6 or triples will become the new banker after the existing banker settles the remaining bets and pockets whatever remains of the bank.

==== The banker rolls the dice ====
When all the bets have been established, the banker rolls the dice. There are four outcomes: automatic win, automatic loss, set point, or re-roll. If the banker sets a point, the bets are settled individually by having each player roll the dice after the banker.

* Automatic Win: If the banker rolls 4-5-6, &quot;triples&quot; (all three dice show the same number), or a pair (of non-6s) with a 6 then they instantly win all bets. 
* Automatic Loss: If the banker rolls 1-2-3, or a pair (of non-1s) with a 1, they instantly lose all bets (the players break the bank).
* Set Point: If the banker rolls a pair and a single (2, 3, 4, or 5), then the single becomes the banker&#x27;s &quot;point.&quot; E.g. a roll of 2-2-4 gives the banker a point of 4. Note that one cannot set a point of 1 or 6, as those would result in an automatic loss or win, respectively (see above).
* Re-roll: If the dice do not show any of the above combinations, then the banker rolls again and keeps rolling until they get an instant win or an instant loss, or sets a point.

==== The players roll the dice ====
If the banker does not roll an automatic win or loss, they will have rolled a point of 2, 3, 4, or 5. Each player then rolls the dice to settle their individual bet against the banker. The player wins with a 4–5–6, triple, or any point higher than the Banker&#x27;s. They lose with a 1–2–3, or any point lower than the banker&#x27;s. If they tie the banker&#x27;s point, then it is a &quot;push&quot;, no winner or loser, and the player pockets his stake. If they do not roll win, loss, or point, they continue to roll the dice until they do so.

The first player to win with a 4–5–6 or triple commonly gets the privilege of being the next banker after all the bets of this round are settled. It is also often the case that 4–5–6 pays double, triples pay three times, and triple 1s pay five times the wager, though different betting systems may be agreed upon.

==== Variations in rules for the banking game ====
Some variants of Cee-lo have been described that reverse the rules of winning and losing rolls for the player who is not a banker, making a 1–2–3 a win for the player, and 4–5–6 a loss. If such a rule is followed to the extent that triples become a losing roll for the player, then this slightly increases the advantage to the banker.

In another variant, the triple 1-1-1 is considered a losing roll (&quot;acey out&quot;), which has the overall effect of reducing the banker&#x27;s edge. In others, the pair+6 and pair+1 may be used to establish points of 6 and 1, respectively, instead of counting as automatic wins or losses.

The difference in points may be used to adjust the bonus payoff; for example, if the player establishes a point which beats the bank&#x27;s point by 1, that would result in the player receiving their bet back plus a bonus equal to of the original bet; beating the bank by 2 points would award a bonus of of the original bet; and beating the bank by 3 points would award a bonus equal to the original bet.

=== Cee-lo without a bank (winner take all) ===
In this version of the game, each round involves two or more players of equal status. A bet amount is agreed upon and each player puts that amount in the pile or pot. Each player then has to roll all three dice at once and must continue until a recognized combination is rolled. Whichever player rolls the best combination wins the entire pot, and a new round begins. In cases where two or more players tie for the best combination, they must have a shoot out to determine a single winner.

The combinations are similar to those described above, and can be ranked from best to worst as:

; 4–5–6: The highest possible roll. If you roll 4–5–6, you automatically win.
; Trips: Rolling three same numbers is known as rolling a trip. Higher trips beat lower trips, so 4–4–4 is better than 3–3–3. Any trips beats any established point. 
; Point: Rolling a pair, and another number, establishes the singleton as a &quot;point&quot;. A higher point beats a lower point, so 2–2–6 (establishing a point of 6) is better than 5–5–2 (establishing a point of 2).
; 1–2–3: The lowest possible meaningful roll. If you roll 1–2–3, you automatically lose. 

Note that 6 and 1 are valid points that can be established, and do not result in an automatic win or loss, respectively, as in the banking game. Any other roll is a meaningless combination and must be rerolled until one of the above combinations occurs.

====Variations in rules for the non-banking game====
Some non-banking games also treat 1-1-1 as a losing roll, and may refer to this as an &quot;ace out&quot;.

Some players rule that a 4-5-6 is an instant win for the first player who rolls it, and it cannot be tied. To see who picks the order, each person rolls a die and the person with the highest number chooses the order. If it is a tie, then those people roll again and again until one person has a higher number. Other rules allow for a 4-5-6 to be tied, which may be referred to as &quot;catch up&quot; rules but this is usually not the case.

One variant rules that if a player wins with &quot;trips&quot; or 4-5-6, all players must pay double the original bet. This is known as &quot;doubling down&quot;.

In a two player game, dealer/player who rolls a &quot;1&quot; on the odd die is considered to have been &quot;aced out&quot;, losing automatically. If the odd die is a &quot;6&quot;, &quot;trips&quot;, or &quot;head crack&quot;, the player wins automatically.

=== Variants applicable to both banking and non-banking games ===

Some players designate a limited surface where players can roll, instead of throwing the dice off a wall, such as a table or a cardboard box. If the dice roll off the surface, it is called a &quot;loose roll&quot; or &quot;sloppy dice,&quot; resulting in an automatic loss for the player.

Some rule that if a player rolls the dice 3 times without getting a meaningful combination, they are out. Others may raise the limit to 5 times without a meaningful combination.

One variation assigns a point based on the pair rolled, rather than the singleton; i.e., a 5-5-2 establishes a point of five (also known by various slang terms such as &quot;fevers&quot;), which beats a 3-3-6 three (a.k.a. &quot;treys&quot;).

A variation described as a &quot;West Coast Version&quot; ranks the combinations somewhat differently. It ranks pairs according to the highest pair, ignoring the singleton (as described immediately above), then treats all &quot;trips&quot; as an instant loss. 1-2-3 is treated as just another meaningless roll.

Another variant treats triples as &quot;high points&quot; and doubles as &quot;low points&quot; (which are set in the traditional way). In this variant a &quot;low six&quot;, e.g. 2-2-6, beats a &quot;high five,&quot; 5-5-5, but a &quot;high five&quot;, 5-5-5 beats a &quot;low five&quot;, e.g. 3-3-5, and so on with other points.

A variant of Cee-lo has been sold under the name &quot;Chinchirorin&quot;. According to the rules of this game, &quot;Chinchirorin&quot; is a traditional Japanese game. Mainly played by older people in Japan, the game is reportedly gaining in popularity as a gambling game in that country.

==Probabilities==
With three six-sided dice there are (6×6×6=) 216 possible permutations.

*4-5-6: 6/216 = 2.78% (Automatic Win)
*Trips: 6/216 = 2.78%
*Point: 90/216 = 41.67%
*1-2-3: 6/216 = 2.78% (Automatic Loss)
*Meaningless permutations: 108/216 = 50%

<text>Astral Oil Works was an American oil company specializing in illuminating oil, and based in Brooklyn, New York. Astral Oil was a high-quality kerosene used in lamps and noted for being relatively safe. It was founded by Charles Pratt. Charles Pratt and Company (including Astral Oil) became part of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Trust in 1874, although the fact that Astral Oil was a New York branch of Standard Oil in Ohio was not made public until 1892.

==History==
===1850s-1860s: Background and formation===
Astral Oil Works was founded in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, New York, by Charles Pratt. Pratt was a pioneer of the petroleum industry who later formed Charles Pratt and Company with Henry H. Rogers. As a young man, Pratt had joined a company in Boston, Massachusetts which specialized in paints and whale oil products. In 1850 or 1851 he moved to New York City, where he worked for a similar company. Pratt realized that whale oil could be replaced by petroleum (&quot;natural oil&quot;) distillates to light lamps. He became a pioneer of the petroleum industry as new wells were established in western Pennsylvania in the 1860s. He soon established his kerosene refinery, Astral Oil Works, in Brooklyn, New York. In the mid-1860s, Pratt met two aspiring young men, Charles Ellis and Henry H. Rogers in western Pennsylvania, and later purchased the entire future output of their small venture, Wamsutta Oil Refinery near Oil City, at a fixed price. Pratt had previously bought whale oil from Ellis in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, and had done business with Rogers in the Pennsylvania oil fields starting in 1861. After five years in the oil fields, in 1866 Pratt asked Rogers to come to the Brooklyn side of Pratt&#x27;s business.

In 1867, Pratt built “America’s first modern oil refinery (Astral Oil) on the banks of Newtown Creek.” Over 50 other oil refineries were then founded along the East River from Williamsburg to Greenpoint, in the same area. While spending eight years in the Brooklyn refinery starting in 1866, Rogers, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, “invented the machinery by which naphtha was first successfully separated from the crude oil. This invention not only made the way for all that has been done since [in 1909] in the use of naphtha and its kindred products, but it made the handling and use of the residual oil far safer than it had ever before, because the volatile constituent had been removed.&quot; Rogers moved steadily from foreman to manager, and then superintendent of Pratt&#x27;s Astral Oil Refinery. Pratt finally gave Rogers an interest in the business. In 1867, with Henry Rogers as a partner, he established the firm of Charles Pratt and Company. In 1869, Pratt trademarked “Pratt’s Astral Oil.” On August 21, 1869, Charles Pratt wrote to the editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; that in the Board of Health meeting that month, the company&#x27;s astral oil came in for &quot;an unintentional consure&quot; after the name was confounded with other parties. The president of the Metropolitan Board of Health apologized for the error within several days, at a meeting on August 25, as it was DEVOE&#x27;S patent petroleum which had been deemed unsafe in an investigation, with &quot;Astral&quot; oil not analyzed by the board. The error resulted because the firm DEVOE &amp; PRATT had been dissolved, with the different partners selling different patent oil canned in the same manner, and &quot;sold in Fulton-street at neighboring stores.

===1870s: Spread of the Astral Oil brand===
Specializing in illuminating oil, which had earlier been derived from whale oil, the products of the Astral Oil Works kerosene refinery became famous worldwide in the late 19th century. Company advertising used the slogan, &quot;&quot;The holy lamps of Tibet are primed with Astral Oil&quot;.&quot; In September 1870, Astral Oil was exhibited at the American Institute Fair, after Charles Pratt of No. 108 Fulton-street had a &quot;splendid array of specimens of illuminating oils&quot; displayed.

The Pratt&#x27;s Astral Oil Guards, numbering 200 men, were organized on the night of August 30, 1871 on Long Island. Mr. Walter of the machine department was elected captain, with most of the men employed at the Pratt establishment at Hunter&#x27;s Point.

Around 10 o’clock in the evening of January 26, 1873, Pratt&#x27;s Astral Oil-works on the northern Williamsburg block “bounded by North 12th and North 13th street and extending from First-street to the river” (First Street was renamed Kent Avenue in 1880) was the scene of a large fire, creating shoots of flame at the building that “formed large spiral columns of flame which shot into the air fifty feet high.” Nearby houses were far enough away to not be harmed, although great alarm was reported in the neighborhood as different barrels were heard exploding. At the time, about 250 boys and adult men were employed by Pratt, including the workers in the packing-house and box-factory. A small number were employed in the refinery. No deaths were reported due to the fire.

===1874-1883: Standard Oil and union busting===
Charles Pratt and Company (including Astral Oil) became part of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Trust in 1874. However, the fact that Astral Oil was a New York branch of Standard Oil in Ohio was not made public until 1892. When the Rockefellers absorbed the Pratt interests in 1874, Pratt and Rogers began working under the auspices of Standard Oil Company, where Rogers held a number of executive positions. Pratt and Rockefeller in 1874 began to buy competing refineries in Brooklyn under the Pratt name. They succeeded in driving a number of smaller firms out of business. Around this time, the coopers’ union opposed Pratt&#x27;s efforts to cut back on certain manual operations, as they were the craftsmen who made the barrels that held the oil. Pratt busted the union, and his strategies for breaking up the organization were adopted by other refineries.

In March 1881, New York City had a smelling committee make the rounds to various stills and waters in Brooklyn. At the time of the examination, the Astral oil works had 20 stills each containing 600 barrels. The &quot;Times&quot; noted that “it was said here that the noxious gases given off in condensing the petroleum were utilized as fuel to such an extent that from one-half to a whole ton of coal was saved to each furnace.” The city&#x27;s Health Commissioner noted that Astral had “adopted all the known appliances, and their place was as little of a nuisance as it was possible to make it.

===1884-1890s: Growth, fire, and lawsuits===
By late 1884, Pratt’s new Astral Oil Works in Williamsburg was on Bushwick Creek in the Eastern District of Brooklyn in Northern Williamsburg. The main building of the oil company ran from First-street about 300 feet to “the width of the block&quot; from North Twelfth to North Thirteenth street. On December 21, 1884, a fire at Astral Oil was first noticed when an explosion shook houses and “broke windows for 300 feet&quot; in front of the new Williamsburg Gas Works along North Twelfth Street. The tank on North 12th Street then had a body of flames shoot up from two naphtha tanks, each with the quantity of 2,500 barrels of naphtha in them. The fire then spread. On December 22, 1884, Pratt&#x27;s Astral Oil Works in Greenpoint burned down. While the naptha storage house burned, the tin shop and refinery were saved by firemen. According to Pratt, much of the damages were insured.

On January 22, 1885, Pratt Manufacturing Company of New York filed a bill in equity against the Astral Refining Company of Oil City in the US Circuit Court of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pratt Manufacturing Company alleged that the term “Astral” as applied to petroleum was their trademark. In April 1886, a case was heard where Pratt Manufacturing Company sued the Astral Refining Company, Limited, to stop the latter from using the words “Astral Oil” as branding with refined petroleum. The case was dismissed.

Built in 1885–1886 as affordable housing for employees of Astral Oil Works, the Astral Apartments was a massive brick and terra cotta building in the Queen Anne style featuring a three-story-high round arch recess.

===1900-1920: Complete absorption by Standard Oil===
On November 11, 1905, Rogers was on the stand in the Exchange Building in the office of Walter I. Badger for three hours. He testified in a $50,000,000 lawsuit brought by Cadwallader M. Raymond and the estate of B. F. Greenough against him and other Standard Oil operators. The estate sought to recover royalties on a patent that Rogers admitted that Captain Greenough had pledged to Rogers and Pratt for a royalty contract years earlier, which rendered kerosene oil non-explosive.

Pratt founded and endowed the Pratt Institute. Under the Sherman Antitrust Act, Standard Oil Trust was broken up into 34 companies in 1911. Standard Oil&#x27;s Brooklyn refinery, at 20 acres, burned down in 1919, in what may have been an intentional attempt to clear the land and draw insurance. The former site of Astral Oil Works is now the location of the Bayside Fuel Oil depot at Bushwick Inlet.

===Derby County===
On 4 August 2006, Smith agreed personal terms on a 3-year contract with Championship outfit Derby County. He made his debut in a 2–2 draw against Southampton on 6 August. After struggling to adapt and break into a Derby side pushing for promotion, plus the arrival of several midfielders in the January transfer window, Smith was sold.

===Millwall===
Smith moved on loan to League One side Millwall on 21 March 2007 on an initial one-month loan deal, but this was extended on 17 April 2007 to run until the end of the 2006–07 season. Smith impressed during his time on loan at Millwall and manager Willie Donachie expressed an interest in retaining the youngster&#x27;s services. In July 2007 Millwall paid £150,000 for Smith, who signed a two-year contract with the club.

===Southampton===

<doc id="1331103" wikidata="Q843582" url="?curid=1331103" title="TV Miyazaki">
<text>Miyazaki Telecasting Co., Ltd. (abbreviation: UMK, Japanese name: 株式会社テレビ宮崎) callsign JODI-DTV (channel 3) is a Japanese TV station in Miyazaki. Currently branded as TV Miyazaki (テレビ宮崎), it is affiliated with FNN/FNS, NNN and ANN.

This is the only TV station in Japan that has joined three TV networks at the same time.

== History ==

On July 16, 1968, the Ministry of Posts (currently the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications) announced its second UHF TV allocation plan, releasing 14 station licenses in 14 areas, including the Miyazaki Prefecture. 12 of the 14 licenses were then merged into one by request from the prefectural government of Miyazaki. On February of the following year, the owners of the 12 licenses agreed into one company to apply of a TV license and were granted a reserved license by the following month.

On March 1, 1970, TV Miyazaki (tentative legal name prior to its launch) started trial broadcasts. And by April 1, 1970, TV Miyazaki official started broadcasting. In 1971, TV Miyazaki set up 7 relay stations alongside Miyazaki Broadcasting In 1973, TV Miyazaki completed the switch to color. TV Miyazaki introduced its color OB van in 1979, and was first used in the 34th National Sports Congress held in Miyazaki.

In 1980, TV Miyazaki completed its sports studio, a first for Japanese TV broadcasting. TV Miyazaki also started hosting large-scale events, with the NASA Space Science Fair in 1982 as its first event. FM Miyazaki (currently branded as JOY FM) was established by TV Miyazaki and started in 1984. During Japan&#x27;s bubble economy, TV Miyazaki began promoting business diversification, and started to enter the real estate business. In 1991, they also invested in the establishment of the golf course, UMK Country Club. In March 2000, they invested in building their new headquarters in preparation for digital broadcasting which was later completed in August of the following year and formally used in February 2002.

On December 1, 2006, digital broadcasting has started and ceased analog transmissions on July 24, 2011. In 2020, TV Miyazaki has unveiled its current logo, in time for its 50th anniversary.

== Technical Information ==
==Programming==
Since its inception until 1973, TV Miyazaki hasn&#x27;t been officially part in any network. At that time, it aired 60% of Fuji TV programming and 20% of programming each for Nippon TV and TV Asahi. In April 1973, TV Miyazaki became an FNN/FNS affiliate. Then in April 1976, they also joined ANN as its secondary affiliate (but not ANN&#x27;s general programming). And by April 1979, they finally joined NNN as its tertiary affiliate (like ANN, TV Miyazaki is not part of NNS, despite participating in the 24 Hour TV charity and airing select variety programs from Nippon TV).

Currently, the news provider (on all days) every morning and primetime (alongside their local news program UMK Super News) comes from FNN, the lunch news bulletin comes from ANN, and the late night news comes from NNN.

Their primetime schedule is also a mix of programs mostly from Nippon TV and Fuji TV, which also leaves no simulcast slots for TV Asahi programming. 

Because some programs (mainly TV Asahi programming on all days and certain Nippon TV &amp; Fuji TV programming on specific days) are not simulcasted by the broadcaster, there are currently two ways to watch them:

* Selected programs from Nippon TV (such as Matsuko In The Room) and TV Asahi (such as Welcome Newlyweds) are then aired on its rival broadcaster Miyazaki Broadcasting, or
* Cable operators in Miyazaki Prefecture provide channels from Kagoshima or Kumamoto Prefectures.

==Subsidiaries==
* FM Miyazaki (JOMU-FM, JFN affiliate)

<doc id="1331104" wikidata="Q5931592" url="?curid=1331104" title="William Herndon (lawyer)">
<text>William Henry Herndon (December 25, 1818 – March 18, 1891) was an American lawyer and politician who was a law partner and biographer of President Abraham Lincoln. He was an early member of the new Republican Party and was elected mayor of Springfield, Illinois.

Herndon and Jesse W. Weik wrote the book &quot;Herndon&#x27;s Lincoln: The True Story of a Great Life&quot;, published in 1889.

==Early life==
Herndon was born the first child of Archer G. Herndon and his wife Rebecca (Day) Johnson, on December 25, 1818, in Greensburg, Kentucky. The family of three moved to Illinois in 1820 and lived for a year in Madison County, Illinois, where Archer and Rebecca had another child. By the spring of 1821 the family was living in Sangamon County. When William was five, the family settled in the German Prairie settlement located five miles northeast of Springfield. Two more children were born to the family there.

Herndon&#x27;s father built the first tavern in Springfield and was engaged in other forms of mercantile business from 1825 to 1836. He was also involved in politics as state senator, and was one of the men instrumental in having the state capital moved to Springfield.

William, known as &quot;Billy&quot; at the time, worked for his father at the Indian Queen hotel before he attended college. It was one of the first hotels in Springfield.

==Marriage and children==
On March 26, 1840, Herndon married Mary J. Maxcy in Sangamon County. Mary&#x27;s family were also early Illinois settlers; her grandfather and step-grandmother arrived in 1827 and Mary&#x27;s immediate family arrived in 1834. Mary was born in Kentucky on July 27, 1822, to Maria Cook Maxcy and James Maxcy, a veteran of the War of 1812. James&#x27; father, Revolutionary War veteran Joel Maxcy, arrived in Sangamon County in 1827 with his second wife and died the following month.

Mary and William had six children: James, Annie, Beverly, Elizabeth, Leigh and Mary. Mary Herndon died on August 18, 1860. The following summer, on July 31, 1861, Herndon married Anna Miles with whom he had three more children: Nina Belle, William and Minnie. The family moved to a farm in Fancy Creek Township located six miles north of Springfield.

==Education and career==
Herndon attended Illinois College from 1836 to 1837 in Jacksonville, Illinois, but he had &quot;an unsuccessful year&quot;. Following this, he returned to Springfield and clerked at the Joshua Speed store, where he often engaged in debates, discussions, and poetry readings with Abraham Lincoln. Their conversations and readings were sometimes practice sessions before presenting material to the Young Men&#x27;s Lyceum, where both Herndon and Lincoln were members. It was an organization of aspiring young men.

In 1840 Herndon began studying law at the Logan and Lincoln law practice. Although employed at Joshua Speed&#x27;s store, he studied up to 14 hours per day after work.

In November 1844, Herndon passed the bar examination. In 1854, ten years after beginning his partnership with Lincoln, he was elected mayor of Springfield, Illinois. Both men were members of the Whig Party. In 1856 Herndon was one of the organizers of the fledgling Republican Party after the dissolution of the Whigs. Lincoln also joined the Republican Party, hoping to &quot;fuse&quot; people of disparate political affiliations who wanted to end slavery.

Herndon loved to learn and developed &quot;one of the best private libraries in Springfield&quot; including works by historians, economists, humanists, free-thinkers and philosophers.

==Abraham Lincoln==

===Partnership===
In the fall of 1844, Lincoln was tired of being a junior partner. He had worked for senior partners with political ambitions, and Lincoln wanted a younger partner to whom he could relate. Surprising both his wife and Herndon, in October Lincoln invited his friend to form a partnership. Lincoln appreciated Herndon&#x27;s friendship, loyalty, shared political beliefs and conscientious study. Lincoln said that Herndon &quot;was my man always above all other men on the globe.&quot; Herndon did not disappoint his friend. He contributed to the practice by performing research for his older and more experienced partner, building the firm&#x27;s law library, and overseeing young men who came to study law (read the law) at their office.

===Politics===
Herndon was a much stauncher opponent of slavery than Lincoln and claimed that he helped change Lincoln&#x27;s views on the subject. He felt that President Lincoln acted too slowly to bring an end to slavery. Herndon felt that the only way to rid the country of slavery was &quot;through bloody revolution.&quot;

During political campaigns, Herndon made strong points that tended to alienate members of the Republican Party and swing voters. Thus, for the 1860 presidential campaign, Herndon was not involved in direct political activities. However, he executed an important task during that campaign by conducting opposition research in the Illinois State Library to be used against Stephen A. Douglas in the 1860 presidential race. Finally, when Lincoln balked at voting for himself, Herndon persuaded him to do so.

===Relationship with the Lincoln family===
Through the whole of his partnership and friendship with Lincoln he was never invited to Lincoln&#x27;s home for dinner due to his contentious relationship with Mary Todd Lincoln. He also admitted that his frustration with Lincoln&#x27;s overly permissive parenting of his two younger sons, Willie and Tad, whom he recalled as undisciplined and disruptive brats in the law offices, caused some harsh words during their partnership.

His final meeting with Lincoln occurred in 1862 when he visited Washington, D.C. Lincoln received him amicably, but he was not invited into the family&#x27;s private quarters in the White House due to the enmity with Mary Lincoln.

===Biography===

====Initial research====
Following Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, Herndon began to collect stories of Lincoln&#x27;s life from those who knew him. Herndon aspired to write a faithful portrait of his friend and law partner, based on his own observations and on hundreds of letters and interviews he had compiled for the purpose. He was determined to present Lincoln as a man, rather than a saint, and to reveal things that the prevailing Victorian era conventions said should be left out of the biography of a great national hero.

In particular, Herndon said of Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;official&quot; biographers, John Nicolay and John Hay: &quot;They are aiming, first, to do a superb piece of literary work; second, to make the story with the classes as against the masses.&quot; He felt that this would represent the &quot;real Lincoln about as well as does a wax figure in the museum.&quot;

====Shared research information====
Ward Hill Lamon, who was then collaborating with a ghostwriter on a Lincoln biography, approached him for assistance. Herndon provided copies of and access to his original correspondences with Lincoln acquaintances and a written agreement not to publish his own biography of Lincoln for at least ten years in exchange for $2,000 cash and an agreement to receive up to $2,000 of the book&#x27;s royalties.

====Collaboration with Jesse Weik====
A young man named Jesse W. Weik who had corresponded with Herndon became a good friend. They then collaborated on the biography of Lincoln&#x27;s life. Weik performed additional research in the 1880s, picking up any new information since Herndon&#x27;s original research, and rewrote much of Herndon&#x27;s draft.

&quot;Herndon&#x27;s Lincoln: The True Story of a Great Life&quot;, the result of their collaborations, appeared in a three-volume edition published by Belford, Clarke &amp; Company in 1889. The majority of the actual writing was done by Weik, who received full credit as co-author. The book received mixed reviews due to the inclusion of such unvarnished elements as Lincoln&#x27;s mother&#x27;s illegitimacy (and even the rumors of Lincoln&#x27;s own), its sometimes viciously negative portrayal of Herndon&#x27;s longtime enemy Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s suicidal depression, and other decidedly less-than-hagiographic accounts of the martyred president who was quickly becoming the most venerated and romanticized figure in American history. Weik kept the notes gathered during the writing of the book and wrote a follow-up book &quot;The Real Lincoln: A Portrait&quot;, which included Weik&#x27;s personal insights and some embarrassing details for Herndon.

====Reception====
Particularly damning was the denunciation of the book by Robert Todd Lincoln, whose grudge against Herndon stemmed largely from Herndon&#x27;s recounting of Ann Rutledge as the only romantic love of his father&#x27;s life. Weik felt that Herndon&#x27;s portrayal of Robert&#x27;s mother and the Lincoln&#x27;s domestic life was especially hurtful.

==Death==
Herndon died March 18, 1891, at his farm in Fancy Creek Township, Sangamon County, Illinois north of Springfield. He is buried in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, the same cemetery as the Lincoln Tomb.

Herndon&#x27;s son William, or Willie, died the same day as his father. Herndon died of &quot;la grippe&quot; (influenza) and his son Willie had (&quot;la grippe&quot; that turned into) pneumonia. Herndon&#x27;s wife Anna died less than two years later on January 7, 1893.

==Portrayal==
Herndon was portrayed in many films for decades, including:
*Jason Robards, Sr. in the 1930 film &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; 
*Alan Baxter in the 1940 biographical film &quot;Abe Lincoln in Illinois&quot; 
*Jeffrey DeMunn in the 1988 (TV mini-series) &quot;Lincoln&quot; 
*Keith Carradine in the 1992 movie &quot;Lincoln&quot; 
*Michael Maize in the 2013 film &quot;Saving Lincoln&quot; 
*Bob Gunton in the 2017 film &quot;The Gettysburg Address&quot;

<doc id="1331135" wikidata="Q1520207" url="?curid=1331135" title="Sabarimala Temple">
<text>The Sabarimala Sree Dharma Sastha Temple () is a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Ayyappan, who is also known as Dharma Shasta and is the son of the deities Shiva and Mohini (female avatar of the god Vishnu).

The temple is situated atop the Sabarimala hill in the village of Ranni-Perunad, within the Ranni Taluk, Thiruvalla Revenue Division of Pathanamthitta district in the state of Kerala, India. The temple is surrounded by 18 hills in the Periyar Tiger Reserve. It is one of the largest annual pilgrimage sites in the world, with an estimate of over 10 to 15 million devotees visiting every year.

The temple is open for worship only during the days of &quot;Mandala Pooja&quot; (approximately 15 November to 26 December), &quot;Makaravilakku&quot; or Makara Sankranti (14 January), and Maha Thirumal Sankranti (14 April), and the first five days of each Malayalam month. The Sabarimala Temple serves as a prime example of the amalgamation of several religious traditions within the Indian context.

The temple practices encompassed the prohibition of women between the ages of 10 and 50 years from accessing the temple premises.

== Origins and legends ==

According to the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, the god Shiva united with the god Vishnu while he was in his female Mohini form. Their relationship resulted in the conception of the deity Shasta. Shasta is also known as Hariharaputra, the son of Hari (Vishnu) and Hara (Shiva). It is believed that Ayyappa is a form of Shasta.

The worship of Shasta forms part of the ancient history of south India. There are many Shasta temples in South India and across the globe.

Five Shasta temples, namely those in Kulathupuzha, Aryankavu, Achankovil, Sabarimala, and Ponnambalmedu, are said to be linked to Parashurama, an avatar of Vishnu. In Kulathupuzha, Shasta is venerated as a child deity. In the Aryankavu temple, he is worshipped as an adolescent &quot;Brahmachari&quot;. The Achankovil temple is connected to the deity&#x27;s Grihastha (household), where he is shown sitting on a horse and holding a sword, along with his wives, Pushkala and Poorna. The Sabarimala temple is associated with the deity&#x27;s Vanaprastha, and in the Ponnambalmedu or Kantamala temple, the deity is shown as the greatest &quot;Yogi&quot;.

=== Legend of Manikandan ===
Sage Suta told his followers the story of how Ayyappa was born, according to &quot;Bhutnathopakhyanam&quot;, a text for Ayyappan followers. After Chamundi killed Mahisasura, his sister Mahisi arrived to take revenge on the &quot;devas&quot; (gods). Brahma gave Mahishi a boon that made her invincible, and only a human born of two males could kill her. The devas were afraid and helpless, so they sought assistance from Vishnu. The union of Shiva and Vishnu, who took the avatar of Mohini, produced a son named Manikandan.

Manikandan was abandoned on the banks of the Pampa River in southern India. The emperor Rajasekhara of the Panthalam dynasty, who didn&#x27;t have any children, found this child. In the meantime, the queen delivered a baby. The queen disliked Manikandan and devised a scheme to eliminate him. She lied about her sickness, claiming that she could only be treated by consuming tiger&#x27;s milk. Twelve-year-old Manikandan ventured into the wilderness in search of tiger&#x27;s milk for her mother. On his journey through the forest, he destroyed Mahisi. The devas were pleased at Mahishi&#x27;s death. Indra assumed the appearance of a tiger, which Manikandan used to return to the kingdom. He flung an arrow into the forest to mark the location of a temple, directed them to construct a temple, and then departed for &quot;Devaloka&quot; (the devas&#x27; abode).

=== Connection with Rama ===
Shabari was a tribal devotee of Rama who is mentioned in the Ramayana. Sabarimala literally translates to &quot;the hill of Sabari.&quot;

As per legend, Sabari met Sage Matanga near the foot of Mount Rishyamukha. He became her guru, and she devotedly served him for years. When Matanga was on his deathbed, he foretold that Rama would come to grant her darshan. He told her to wait for the arrival of Rama. Since that time, Sabari has only left her ashram each day to gather berries for Rama. She would pick one, taste it, and place it in her basket if it was sweet, discarding the bitter berries because she wanted Rama to have only the sweet berries. While in his search for Sita, Rama visits the Sabari at her ashram. Sabari fed Rama with the berries that she had collected.

Rama saw a divine person doing penance and asked Shabari to tell him who it was. Shabari said it was Sastha (Ayyappan). Sastha also stood and greeted Rama.

=== Legend of Malikapurathamma and connection with Ezhava Community===

According to mythology, Maalikapurathamma is the divine daughter of Cheerappanchira Panicker who taught Kalaripayattu to Ayyappa. Cheerappanchira is an ancient noble Ezhava family renowned for its Kalari in Muhamma, Alappuzha District. According to legend, Ayyappan was sent by the Pandalam king to Muhamma to learn Kalaripayattu. Malikkapurathamma, also known as Subhadra (Poonkudi), used to teach Kalari to Ayyappan in the absence of her father. During this time, they fell in love with each other. The Cheerappanchira family to this day holds many rights in the Sabarimala temple, such as to conduct fireworks, to light Nilavilak and ceremonial lamps at the Malikapurathamma temple, collect half the coconuts given by devotees at the Malikapurathamma temple.

There is a small Mukkalvetti Ayyappa temple at Cheerappanchira, near Kollam which hold 3/4 power of Ayyappa and rest in Sabarimala.

Valiya kadutha swami and kochu kadutha Swamy who were warrior brothers worshipped at Shabarimala are considered as ‘Shaundikans’, who hails from the Malabar Thiyyar community.

== The temple ==


=== History ===
The Sabarimala temple does not have any ancient or medieval references. Nevertheless, there are extant late medieval references pertaining to the temple.

The Pandalam royal family drafted a mortgage document in 1793. It states that the royal family is pledging the revenue returns, which encompass the income generated by the Sabarimala Temple, to the Tranvancore state.

In 1863, Ward and Conner published an article that provided a description of Sabarimala and its vicinity.

In the year 1902, the ruler of Travancore issued a directive for the restoration of the Sabarimala temple, which had suffered damage as a result of a fire incident. Kochu Thomman, a Mavelikkara resident of Christian faith, funded and carried out the reconstruction contract.

In the year 1950, the temple was rebuilt after an arson attack. No charges were brought, and the earlier stone image of the deity was replaced by a panchaloha (an alloy of five metals) idol, about one and a half feet tall.

Neelakanta Panicker and his younger brother, Ayyappa Panicker, who are members of the Thattavila Vishwakarma family in Chengannur, Kerala, created the Panchaloha idol to replace the original stone statue of the deity. Edavankadan T.N. Padmanabhan Achari from Mavaelikkara was appointed the supervisor in charge of the new idol by Rajpramukh Sree Chithira Tirunaal Balarama Varma. In the early 1950s, through P. T. Rajan efforts, the present panchaloha idol of Ayyappan was installed at Sabarimalai, and a procession was taken all over Madras state.

In 1969, the flagstaff (&quot;dhwajastambha&quot;) was installed.

=== Architecture and shrines ===
The &quot;Sannidhanam&quot; (main temple) is built on a plateau about 40 feet high.

The temple consists of a sanctum sanctorum with a gold-plated roof and four golden finials at the top, two &quot;mandapams&quot;, and the &quot;balikalpura,&quot; which houses the altar.

The 18 sacred steps are the main stairway to the temple. As per the custom followed, no pilgrim without &quot;Irumudikkettu&quot; can ascend the 18 sacred steps. In 1985, the 18 steps were covered by Panchaloha. The temples of Ayyappan&#x27;s trusted lieutenants, Karuppu Sami and Kadutha Sami, are positioned as his guards (kaval) at the foot of the holy 18 sacred steps.

The northern gate is open for those who do not carry an &quot;Irumudikkettu&quot;, as observed in the 1991 Kerala High Court judgement.

Ayyappan&#x27;s half-brother Ganesha&#x27;s shrine is southwest of the sanctum. Devotees offer part of the broken coconut (Neythenga) to the fireplace (Azhi). Ganapati homam is the main offering.

The temple of &quot;Maalikapurathamma&quot;, whose importance is almost on par with that of Ayyappan, is located a few yards from Sannidhanam. It is believed that Ayyappan had specific instructions that he wanted &quot;Malikappurath Amma&quot; on his left side. Prior to the fire disaster, there was only a Peeda Prathishta (holy seat) at Malikappuram. Brahmasree Kandararu Maheswararu Thanthri installed the idol of Malikappurath Amma. Maalikapurathamma holds a Sankh, Chakram and Varada Abhya Mudra. Now the idol is covered with a gold golaka. The temple was also reconstructed in the last decade, and now the conical roof and &quot;sopanam&quot; are covered with gold.

The shrine of the king of the snakes, Nagaraja, is placed adjacent to the Malikappurathamma temple. Pilgrims, after the Darsan of Ayyappa and Kannimoola Ganapathi, make their darshan and give offerings to Nagaraja.

&quot;Manimandapam&quot; is the place where Ayyappan vanished into the temple.

The Sabarimala temple complex includes &quot;Pampa Ganapathi&quot; temple, &quot;Nilakal Mahadeva&quot; temple, and &quot;Palliyarakkavu Devi Temple&quot;. The Nilakal Mahadeva temple and Palliyarakkavu Devi Temple are as old as the Ayyappan temple, and the deities are worshipped as the parents of Ayyappan. Ganapathi temple at Pampa has &quot;Pampa Maha Ganapathi&quot; and &quot;Athi Ganapathi&quot; (lit. old Ganesha) idols; in Sreekovil, the idol from the first Ganesha temple is worshipped. &quot;Sabari Peedam&quot; has a temple for Rama and Hanuman as well.

==Festivals and religious practices==
===Prasadam===

The prasadam at Sabarimala temple are &quot;Aravana payasam&quot; and &quot;Appam.&quot; An &#x27;Appam&#x27; is a sweet ball composed of rice, kadalippazham, and ghee, whereas &#x27;Arvana&#x27; refers to a dense and sweet dessert. The Chief Commissioner, Travancore Devaswom Board, said that the board has been appointed by the Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore, as a consultant for providing technical guidance to ensure the quality of Aravana, Appam, and other prasadam preparations at Sabarimala temple.

===Harivarasanam===
Vadakkathillathu Eswaran Namoothiri, who held the position of &quot;melsanthi&quot;, a chief priest, started the tradition of singing keerthan in the year 1950. Following the &quot;Athazhapooja&quot;, he performed the recitation of &quot;Harivarasanam&quot;. Harivarasanam is a Sanskrit &quot;Urakkupattu, a&quot; lullaby. The recitation takes place nightly before the closure of the temple entrance. The keerthan can be found in the Sasthasthuti kadambam, a publication authored by Kambankudi Sundaram Kulathu Ayyer. The song depicts Ayappa as Hariharaputhra, a deity revered in the Vedas.

===Neyyabhishekam===
This significant ritual involves pouring sacred ghee brought by pilgrims in their &quot;Pallikettu&quot; or &quot;Irumudi&quot; (a two-compartment bag made of handwoven cotton cloth used to carry the offerings for Sabarimala Temple carried on their heads) on the idol of Ayyappan. It symbolically means the merging of Jeevatma with the Paramatma.

===Makara Vilakku===
Makaravilakku is an annual festival held on Makara Sankranti in Kerala, India at the shrine of Sabarimala. The festival includes the Thiruvabharanam (sacred ornaments of the deity Ayyappan) procession and a congregation at the hill shrine of Sabarimala. An estimated half a million devotees flow to Sabarimala every year to have a darshan (vision) of this ritual this day.

===Makarajyoti===
This is a star that appears at the moment of Makar Sankranti, after the holy arti and the lighting of the Makaravilakku at Ponnambalamedu. It is the custom that after seeing the Makarajyoti star, the lighting of the Makaravilakku shall begin.

Makara Jyothi is the name given to the celestial star Sirius.

===Tattvamasi===
The most important message written at the temple facade is one of the four Mahāvākyas of Advaita or the non-dualistic school of philosophy. Tat Tvam Asi, the 3rd of four Mahavakyas which in sanskrit translates to &quot;Thou Art That&quot; is the principal philosophy that governs the temple and pilgrimage. As the pilgrimage is symbolic for the journey to self-realization that all living beings possess the part and parcel of parabrahman (lord), pilgrims refer to each other as Swami, acknowledging their divinity with lord seated in everyone heart as bramhan.

The oneness of jIva and Ishvara are qualitatively but not quantitatively described by enquiry into the inner meaning of the statement ‘tat tvam asi’as follows:

* &quot;Tat&quot; refers to Ishvara, the lord - the word Ishvara has a literal and an implied meaning;
* The literal meaning of ‘Ishvara’ is ‘supreme bramhan (above bramhan and para bramhan )’;
*refers to the jIva, the individual identities of everyone;
* The literal meaning of ‘jIva’ is ‘AtmA identified with mithyA gross and subtle bodies’;
* The implied meaning is pure consciousness-AtmA without mithyA gross and subtle bodies;
* In advaita AtmA and parmatma (Brahman) are different names of the one Reality;
* Thus, jIva and Ishvara are Absolutely non-different in qualitatively, but only difference is quantitatively

===History behind the methods of worship===
The customs of the pilgrims to Sabarimala are based on five worshipping methods; those of Shaivites, Shaktists and Vaishnavites. At first, there were three sections of devotees – the devotees of Shakti worship their deity by way of yajna, literally sacrifice, the devotees of Vishnu who followed the strict penance and continence, and the devotees of Shiva who partly followed these two methods. Another name of Ayyappa is Shasta. All these can be seen merged into the beliefs of pilgrims to Sabarimala. The chain the pilgrims wear comes from the Rudraksha chain of the Shaivites. The strict fasting, penance and continence is taken out of the beliefs of the Vaishnavites. The offering of tobacco to Kaduthaswamy can be considered to be taken from the Shaktists.

== Pilgrimage ==
The duration of the pilgrimage to the Sabarimala temple is predetermined. Furthermore, the pilgrims are required to undergo various stages of the pilgrimage in an ordered manner.

The pilgrimage to Sabarimala starts on the first day of Vrischika month of the Malayalam year (the month of Scorpio) and ends on the 11th day of Dhanu month (the Month of Sagittarius). This season of the 41-day pilgrimage is known as the &quot;mandala&quot; (season). The season is in the months of December and January.

The nearest railway station is Chengannur railway station is known as the Gateway of Sabarimala because devotees from Andhra, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the rest of India alight at Chengannur railway station for their pilgrimage about 70% of devotees alight here so railway is going to create a new railway line from chengannur to pamba (Distance 75 km).

The devotees are expected to follow a &quot;Vratham&quot; (a 41-day austerity period) prior to the pilgrimage. This begins with wearing a special &quot;Mala&quot; (a neck chain made of Rudraksha or Tulasi beads is commonly used, although other types of chains are also available). During the 41 days of Vratham, the devotee who has taken the vow is required to strictly follow the rules that include following only a lacto-vegetarian diet (In India, vegetarianism is synonymous with lacto-vegetarianism), following celibacy, follow teetotalism, not using any profanity, control anger, and allow the hair and nails to grow without cutting. They must try to help others, and see everything around them as Ayyappa. They are expected to bath twice a day and visit the local temples regularly and only wear plain black or blue coloured traditional clothing.

Many Hindu pilgrims also visit a mosque in Erumely dedicated to Vavar, a Muslim saint who according to tradition was devotee of Ayyappan.

Millions of devotees still follow the traditional mountainous forest path (approximately 61 km) from Erumely, 12.8 km from Vandiperiyar and 8 km from Chalakayam, believed to be taken by Ayyappa himself. The Erumely route starts from Erumely to Aludha river, then crosses the Aludha mountain to reach Karivilam thodu. Now comes the sacred Karimala crossing, from there to Cheriyanavattom, Valliyanavattom and finally Pamba River. Then they have to climb Neelimala and enter into the Ganesha-Bettam, Shreerama-Betta Padam. Then comes the Aranmula kottaram, which is one of the stops of holy journey &quot;Thiruvabharana Ghoshayatra&quot; (the grand procession of the divine jewelry).

These days people use vehicles to reach the Pamba River by an alternate route. From Pamba, all the pilgrims begin trekking the steep mountain path of Neeli Mala till Sabari Mala. This route is now highly developed, with emergency shops and medical aid by the sides, and supporting aid is provided to the pilgrims while climbing the steep slope, which used to be a mere trail through dense jungle. The elderly pilgrims are lifted by men on bamboo chairs to the top, on being paid. 

=== Women ===
Temple management places religious restrictions against the entry of women aged 10 to 50. This is based on the tradition of the temple to respect the celibate nature of the deity; similar restrictions are present against the entry of men on certain days or the inner sanctum in other Hindu temples such as the Pushkar Brahma Temple and the Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati.

According to the &quot;Memoir of the Survey of the Travancore and Cochin States&quot;, which was published in two volumes by the Madras government in the 19th century, women of menstruating age were denied entry into the Sabarimala temple two centuries ago. Though the authors, lieutenants of the Madras Infantry, completed the survey by the end of the year 1820 after nearly five years of research, it was published in two volumes only in 1893 and 1901. According to the report, individuals who have reached puberty or a specific age are prohibited from approaching the temple, while elderly women and young girls are permitted to do so. This is due to the deity&#x27;s (Ayyappan) aversion to any sexual activity in the vicinity.

Up until 1991, women visited the temple, though in small numbers. Women pilgrims below the age of 50 would visit the temple to conduct the first rice-feeding ceremony of their children (Chorroonu) in the temple premises.

In 1991, Justices K. Paripoornan and K. Balanarayana Marar of the Kerala High Court, in their ruling against the Travancore Devaswom Board, restricted the entry of women between the ages of 10 and 50 from offering worship at the temple, stating that such a restriction was in accordance with the usage prevalent from time immemorial. In addition, the judges directed the Government of Kerala to use the police force to ensure that restriction was complied with. The high court also stated that &quot;since there is no restriction between one section and another section or between one class and another class among the Hindus in the matter of entry to a temple (Sabarimala), whereas the prohibition is only in respect of women of a particular age group and not women as a class.&quot;

On 28 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India, in a 4-1 majority decision (4 men and 1 women judicial panel), overturned the ban on the entry of women. The Chief Justice, Dipak Misra, stated that the selective ban on women was not an &quot;essential part&quot; of Hinduism but instead a form of &quot;religious patriarchy&quot;. Justice Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud stated that the ban &quot;stigamatises&quot; and &quot;stereotypes&quot; women while &quot;placing the burden of men&#x27;s celibacy&quot; on them. The lone female judge, Indu Malhotra noted in her dissenting judgement that &quot;what constitutes an essential religious practice is for the religious community to decide&quot; and not a matter that should be decided by the courts. She added that &quot;notions of rationality cannot be invoked in matters of religion by courts.&quot; After the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, there were a lot of protests and gatherings in the southern part of Kerala. In response to the decision made on September 28, 2018, devotees have filed about 65 review petitions. The Supreme Court of India accepted review petitions against its own orders. The Supreme Court has decided to review the petition and hold a public hearing because of the important facts and circumstances of the case.

This led to protests at Nilakkal and Pamba base camps on 17 October 2018, when the temple was opened for the first time after the Supreme Court verdict. Protesters assaulted women journalists, stole their camera equipment, and damaged a vehicle. The police were also attacked. A number of women were among the protesters, checking cars to see if they contained women of menstruating age and helping with the road blocks. There were also reports of police damaging protesters&#x27; motor bikes. However Ayyappan devotees in a large scale all over Kerala and also in other southern state of India namely Tamil Nadu, Andra pradesh and Karnataka, protested against entry of women in 10-50 age group in Sabarimala. Large number of people participated in the protest mainly women devotees. On 26 December 2018, devotees conducted &#x27;Ayyappa Jyothi&#x27; lighting diya or lamp all across the state of Kerala, Karnataka covering a distance of about 765 km from 6 pm to 6-30 pm against young women&#x27;s entry to temple. Thousands joined in the event. The protestors were physically attacked in Kannur and the state government filed cases against 1400 unidentified participants.

Even other religious groups supported the cause of devotees. Prominent Jain Acharya Yugbhushan Suri Maharaj, also known as Pandit Maharaj, has said that sanctity was a religious issue and that it was connected to fundamental religious rights. Commenting on the Sabarimala temple row, Pandit Maharaj told IndiaToday, &quot;Whether it is Sabarimala or Jharkhand&#x27;s Shikharji, the agitations are for sanctity,&quot; adding, &quot;Religion talks about inner belief and sanctity. This should be respected. I am not against the judiciary or the Supreme Court, but they should not overlook the belief of the people.&quot; Also, Art of Living founder Ravi Shankar batted for the rules that have been traditionally followed at the sanctum sanctorum of the Ayyappa Temple in Sabarimala.

Two women of menstruating age attempted to enter the temple on 19 October 2018 but were blocked by protesters about 100 m away. After the Thantri threatened to close the sanctum sanctorum if the women attempted to ascend the 18 sacred steps, they turned back.

On 2 January 2019 at 3:45 AM, for the first time after the Supreme Court verdict, two women in their early 40s were escorted by police into the Sabarimala temple, allegedly through a back gate meant for staff. The Chief Minister of Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan, confirmed their entry. Thereafter, priests closed the temple for one hour to ritually purify it as the 41-days pilgrimage is known as Mandala kalam or the 41-day austerity period/Vratham had not been given a by-pass and the women entered the temple premises violating all those traditions too.

After the hearing ended in February 2019, the Court, led by the newly appointed Chief Justice, Mr. Ranjan Gagoi, issued an order to send the case to a larger bench of seven judges so that the decision made on 28 September 2018, could be looked at again.

==Administration==

Administration and legal binding is managed by Travancore Devasvom Board, an affiliate authority of Government of Kerala. Thazhamon Madom is the traditional priest family who has powers over the religious matters to be decided in Sabarimala Temple. Tantri is the highest priest and is the head of the temple. It&#x27;s the duty of the family to decide on religious matters relating to Sabarimala shrine. Tantris are to be present in all ceremonial Poojas and functions to be held at temple premises and functions associated with temple. The installation of idols of the temple was also done by Tantri of this family.

Currently, Kandararu Rajeevararu and Kandararu Mahesh Mohanaru from Thazhamon Madom are the &quot;thantris&quot; of Sabarimala, taking yearly turns and A K Sudheer Namboodiri is the elected &quot;melshanti&quot; of Sabarimala, from November 2019 to November 2020.

Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has decided to allow more devotees daily to visit the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple as of 1 December 2020. The number of devotees has been increased from the present 1,000 to 2,000 on week days and from 2,000 to 3,000 on weekends and holidays.

All necessary precautionary measures have been taken at the shrine premises and base camps adhering to COVID-19 guidelines.

==Environmental efforts==

The waste disposed by the devotees to Sabarimala is threatening the wildlife of the region and the evergreen forests. Efforts are on to make Sabarimala free from pollution and waste. High Court of Kerala has directed that &#x27;Irumudikkettu&#x27; should not contain plastic materials. Projects like &quot;Punyam Poonkavanam&quot; has been initiated under the aegis of governmental departments. Mata Amritanandamayi Math has been regularly contributing to keep Sabarimala and its precincts clean. While cleaning Pamba river Sabarimala Sanndidhaanam clean is their primary objective, the broader vision is to spread the message of greenness and cleanliness beyond Sabarimala.

Some of the salient aspects of &quot;Punyam Poonkavanam&quot; project includes:
# Not using soap and oil while bathing in the holy Pamba River. No throwing any material, including clothes in the holy river.
# To prepare &quot;irumudikkettu&quot; without using any plastic and using only bio-degradable materials.
# To devote at least one hour in cleanliness activities at Sabarimala Sannidhaanam, River Pamba and surroundings as part of the pilgrimage.

==Transport==

The nearest railway station is Chengannur known as the Gateway of Sabarimala. (), () () are some of the closest accessible railway stations from Sabarimala.
The nearest airports are Thiruvananthapuram International Airport () and Cochin International Airport (). The state government has also approved the construction of a fifth airport in the Kottayam district, close to the Sabarimala shrine, on 31 December 2022.

Special buses are arranged from different parts of the state to provide transportation to Kerala in anticipation of the yearly Mandala and Makaravilakku poojas performed at the temple dedicated to Lord Ayyappa Swamy.

The Sabari Express, which stops at nearby stations like Chengannur, Thiruvalla and Kottayam, is frequented by devotees of this temple. During the peak season, the train is full of devotees looking to travel to the temple.

<text>Electronic programming guides (EPGs) and interactive programming guides (IPGs) are menu-based systems that provide users of television, radio, and other media applications with continuously updated menus that display scheduling information for current and upcoming broadcast programming (most commonly, TV listings). Some guides also feature backward scrolling to promote their catch up content. They are commonly known as guides or TV guides.

Non-interactive electronic programming guides (sometimes known as &quot;navigation software&quot;) are typically available for television and radio, and consist of a digitally displayed, non-interactive menu of programming scheduling information shown by a cable or satellite television provider to its viewers on a dedicated channel. EPGs are transmitted by specialized video character generation (CG) equipment housed within each such provider&#x27;s central headend facility. By tuning into an EPG channel, a menu is displayed that lists current and upcoming television shows on all available channels.

A more modern form of the EPG, associated with both television and radio broadcasting, is the interactive [electronic] programming guide (IPG, though often referred to as EPG). An IPG allows television viewers and radio listeners to navigate scheduling information menus interactively, selecting and discovering programming by time, title, channel or genre using an input device such as a keypad, computer keyboard or television remote control. Its interactive menus are generated entirely within local receiving or display equipment using raw scheduling data sent by individual broadcast stations or centralized scheduling information providers. A typical IPG provides information covering a span of seven or 14 days.

Data used to populate an interactive EPG may be distributed over the Internet, either for a charge or free of charge, and implemented on equipment connected directly or through a computer to the Internet.

Television-based IPGs in conjunction with Programme Delivery Control (PDC) technology can also facilitate the selection of TV shows for recording with digital video recorders (DVRs), also known as personal video recorders (PVRs).

==History==
===Key events===
====North America====
In 1981, United Video Satellite Group launched the first EPG service in North America, a cable channel known simply as The Electronic Program Guide. It allowed cable systems in the United States and Canada to provide on-screen listings to their subscribers 24 hours a day (displaying programming information up to 90 minutes in advance) on a dedicated cable channel. Raw listings data for the service was supplied via satellite to participating cable systems, each of which installed a computer within its headend facility to present that data to subscribers in a format customized to the system&#x27;s unique channel lineup. The EPG Channel would later be renamed Prevue Guide and go on to serve as the de facto EPG service for North American cable systems throughout the remainder of the 1980s, the entirety of the 1990s, and – as TV Guide Network or TV Guide Channel – for the first decade of the 21st century.
In 1986 at a trade show in Nashville, STV/Onsat, a print programming guide publisher, introduced SuperGuide, an interactive electronic programming guide for home satellite dish viewers. The system was the focus of a 1987 article in &quot;STV Magazine&quot;. The original system had a black-and-white display, and would locally store programming information for around one week in time. A remote control was used to interact with the unit. When the user found a show they wanted to watch, they would have to turn off the guide and then tune the satellite receiver to the correct service. The system was developed by Chris Schultheiss of STV/OnSat and engineer Peter Hallenbeck. The guide information was distributed by satellite using the home owner&#x27;s dish as the receiver. The information was stored locally so that the user could use the guide without having to be on a particular satellite or service.
In March 1990, a second generation SuperGuide system was introduced that was integrated into the Uniden 4800 receiver. This version had a color display and the hardware was based on a custom chip; it was also able to disseminate up to two weeks of programming information. When the user found the show of interest, they pressed a button on the remote and the receiver tuned to the show they wanted to watch. This unit also had a single button recording function, and controlled VCRs via an infrared output. Available in North America, it was the first commercially available unit for home use that had a locally stored guide integrated with the receiver for single button viewing and taping. A presentation on the system was given at the 1990 IEEE consumer electronics symposium in Chicago.

In June 1988 a patent was awarded that concerned the implementation of a searchable electronic program guide – an interactive program guide (IPG).

TV Guide Magazine and Liberty Media established a joint venture in 1992 known as TV Guide On Screen to develop an EPG. The joint venture was led by video game veteran, Bruce Davis, and introduced an interactive program guide to the market in late 1995 in the General Instrument CFT2200 set-top cable box. Leading competitors to TV Guide On Screen included Prevue Guide and StarSight Telecast. Telecommunications Inc, owner of Liberty Media, acquired United Video Satellite Group, owner of Prevue Guide, in 1995. TV Guide On Screen and Prevue Guide were later merged. TV Guide On Screen for digital cable set top boxes premiered in the DigiCable series of set top boxes from General Instrument shortly thereafter. See wiki on TV Guide for subsequent developments.

Scientific Atlanta introduced the 8600X Advanced analog Set-top box in 1993 that included an interactive electronic program guide, downloadable software, 2-way communications, and pause/FF/REW for VCR-like viewing. Millions were deployed by Time Warner and other customers.

====Western Europe====
In Western Europe, 59 million television households were equipped with EPGs at the end of 2008, a penetration of 36% of all television households. The situation varies from country to country, depending on the status of digitization and the role of pay television and IPTV in each market. With Sky as an early mover and the BBC iPlayer and Virgin Media as ambitious followers, the United Kingdom is the most developed and innovative EPG market to date, with 96% of viewers having frequently used an EPG in 2010. Inview Technology is one of the UK&#x27;s largest and oldest EPG producers, dating back to 1996 and currently in partnership with Humax and Skyworth.

Scandinavia also is a highly innovative EPG market. Even in Italy, the EPG penetration is relatively high with 38%. In France, IPTV is the main driver of EPG developments. In contrast to many other European countries, Germany lags behind, due to a relatively slow digitization process and the minor role of pay television in that country.

==Current applications==

Interactive program guides are nearly ubiquitous in most broadcast media today. EPGs can be made available through television (on set-top boxes and all current digital TV receivers), mobile phones (particularly through smartphone apps), and on the Internet. Online TV Guides are becoming more ubiquitous, with over seven million searches for &quot;TV Guide&quot; being logged each month on Google.

For television, IPG support is built into almost all modern receivers for digital cable, digital satellite, and over-the-air digital broadcasting. They are also commonly featured in digital video recorders such as TiVo and MythTV. Higher-end receivers for digital broadcast radio and digital satellite radio commonly feature built-in IPGs as well.

Demand for non-interactive electronic television program guides – television channels displaying listings for currently airing and upcoming programming – has been nearly eliminated by the widespread availability of interactive program guides for television; TV Guide Network, the largest of these services, eventually abandoned its original purpose as a non-interactive EPG service and became a traditional general entertainment cable channel, eventually rebranding as Pop in January 2015. Television-based IPGs provide the same information as EPGs, but faster and often in much more detail. When television IPGs are supported by PVRs, they enable viewers to plan viewing and recording by selecting broadcasts directly from the EPG, rather than programming timers.

The aspect of an IPG most noticed by users is its graphical user interface (GUI), typically a grid or table listing channel names and program titles and times: web and television-based IPG interfaces allow the user to highlight any given listing and call up additional information about it supplied by the EPG provider. Programs on offer from subchannels may also be listed.

Typical IPGs also allow users the option of searching by genre, as well as immediate one-touch access to, or recording of, a selected program. Reminders and parental control functions are also often included. The IPGs within some DirecTV IRDs can control a VCR using an attached infrared emitter that emulates its remote control.

The latest development in IPGs is personalization through a recommendation engine or semantics. Semantics are used to permit interest-based suggestions to one or several viewers on what to watch or record based on past patterns. One such IPG, iFanzy, allows users to customize its appearance.

Standards for delivery of scheduling information to television-based IPGs vary from application to application, and by country. Older television IPGs like Guide Plus+ relied on analog technology (such as the vertical blanking interval of analog television video signals) to distribute listings data to IPG-enabled consumer receiving equipment. In Europe, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) published standard ETS 300 707 to standardize the delivery of IPG data over digital television broadcast signals. Listings data for IPGs integrated into digital terrestrial television and radio receivers of the present day is typically sent within each station&#x27;s MPEG transport stream, or alongside it in a special data stream. The ATSC standard for digital terrestrial television, for instance, uses tables sent in each station&#x27;s PSIP. These tables are meant to contain program start times and titles along with additional program descriptive metadata. Current time signals are also included for on-screen display purposes, and they are also used to set timers on recording devices.

Devices embedded within modern digital cable and satellite television receivers, on the other hand, customarily rely upon third-party listings metadata aggregators to provide them with their on-screen listings data. Such companies include Tribune TV Data (now Gracenote, part of Nielsen Holdings), Gemstar-TV Guide (now TiVo Corporation), FYI Television, Inc. in the United States and Europe; TV Media in the United States and Canada; Broadcasting Dataservices in Europe and Dayscript in Latin America; and What&#x27;s On India Media Pvt. Ltd in India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, the Middle East and Asia.

Some IPG systems built into older set-top boxes designed to receive terrestrial digital signals and television sets with built-in digital tuners may have a lesser degree of interactive features compared to those included in cable, satellite and IPTV converters; technical limitations in these models may prevent users from accessing program listings beyond (at maximum) 16 hours in advance and complete program synopses, and the inability for the IPG to parse synopses for certain programs from the MPEG stream or displaying next-day listings until at or after 12:00 a.m. local time. IPGs built into newer television (including Smart TV), digital terrestrial set-top box and antenna-ready DVR models feature on-screen displays and interactive guide features more comparable to their pay television set-top counterparts, including the ability to display grids and, in the case of DVRs intended for terrestrial use, the ability – with an Internet connection – to access listings and content from over-the-top services.

A growing trend is for manufacturers such as Elgato and Topfield and software developers such as Microsoft in their Windows Media Center to use an Internet connection to acquire data for their built-in IPGs. This enables greater interactivity with the IPG such as media downloads, series recording and programming of the recordings for the IPG remotely; for example, IceTV in Australia enables TiVo-like services to competing DVR/PVR manufacturers and software companies.

In developing IPG software, manufacturers must include functions to address the growing volumes of increasingly complex data associated with programming. This data includes program descriptions, schedules and parental television ratings, along with flags for technical and access features such as display formats, closed captioning and Descriptive Video Service. They must also include user configuration information such as favorite channel lists, and multimedia content. To meet this need, some set-top box software designs incorporate a &quot;database layer&quot; that utilizes either proprietary functions or a commercial off-the-shelf embedded database system for sorting, storing and retrieving programming data.

<text>is a TV station of Nippon News Network (NNN) and Nippon Television Network System (NNS) in Hokkaidō, Japan. Headquartered in Sapporo, the capital city of Hokkaidō prefecture, the TV station was established on April 8, 1958. It is usually called &quot;STV&quot; for short, which is used as a name in a number of TV programs.

Since December 15, 1962, the company has operated as a television and radio station until July 12, 2005, when its radio broadcasting operations was split into . Currently, STV Radio is an affiliate of National Radio Network (NRN) covering the Hokkaidō Prefecture. The license of the radio broadcasts was succeeded to the STV Radio, and started broadcasting under the new subsidiary on October 1, 2005.

==History==

=== Early stages ===
In early 1957, Youzo Kurosawa (then president of the Hokkai Shimbun), Yoshjiro Kikuchi (then president of the Hokkaido Charcoal Steamship Company), and Yoshitaro Hagiwara (president of the Hokkaido Charcoal Steamship Company), considered the formation of a second private television station in Hokkaido. Japan&#x27;s national newspapers (Yomiuri Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, and Sankei Shimbun) attempted to enter the Hokkaido market at the time by combining two major sectors, television and newspapers, with the goal of creating a private television station.

This is unquestionably a serious danger to Hokkaido&#x27;s native newspaper, the Hokkai Shimbun. Hokkai Shimbun and an unnamed Hokkaido firm sought for a commercial TV broadcasting license under the name &quot;Sapporo TV&quot; in April 1957. And received their license on October of the same year. 

=== Founding and early years ===

The company was founded on April 8, 1958.STV began its TV broadcasts on April 1 the following year airing for at least 9 and a half hours a day. STV started as a dual affiliated station with NNN as their primary affiliate and FNN as their secondary affiliate. The network also aired certain programming from Nippon Educational Television (currently TV Asahi) alongside HBC. Since Sapporo TV initially obtained a quasi-educational station license, the station had to follow educational quotas for a substantial proportion of its programming. Sapporo TV&#x27;s first self-produced program is also an educational program &quot;Television Fudoki&quot;. In the first year of broadcasting, Sapporo TV&#x27;s corporate income entered the top ten in Hokkaido. In 1960, the Sapporo TV Broadcasting Hall was completed, enabling Sapporo TV to have its own TV studio. In the same year, the Sapporo Television Union also announced its establishment. In 1961, STV&#x27;s turnover reached 1.27 billion yen, and the average monthly turnover exceeded 100 million yen.

Prior to its official TV broadcasts, STV also applied a radio broadcasting license in 1958 (which was later rejected). The broadcaster applied for a license again on February 17, 1961 and was granted on July 10, 1962 becoming the only broadcaster in Japan to start TV broadcasts then radio broadcasts (STV Radio started broadcasting on December 15, 1962). NET TV stopped providing programs to STV after it moved its remaining programs to HBC sometime in 1962. Relying on the principle of thorough budget frugality, Sapporo TV set a very high profit rate of 42.5% in the second half of 1963. In 1964, the station&#x27;s signal had covered 95% of the population of Hokkaido. On March 20, 1966, STV started to air programs in color. STV joined NNN as one of its founding members on April 1, 1966, to strengthen the news reporting system. When the TV broadcasting license was renewed in 1967, the broadcasting license of Sapporo TV Station was changed from a quasi-educational station to a general TV station, withdrawing the former quotas introduced upon launch. The programming was more free and more entertainment programs were broadcast. Sapporo TV&#x27;s program production ability also improved in the late 1960s, and in 1969, it assisted in the production of the popular late-night program 11PM of the Nippon Television Network. In 1971, Sapporo TV Station built a new broadcasting hall, whose building area was three times that of the old broadcasting hall, and set up a special studio for TV news.

In 1972, Sapporo TV also assisted in broadcasting the Sapporo Winter Olympics. STV ended airing programs from Fuji TV/FNN after UHB started broadcasting on April 1, 1972. Sapporo TV started was the first broadcaster to use the automatic advertising broadcast system. In 1978, the 20th anniversary of the broadcast, Sapporo TV produced special programs such as the documentary &quot;One Year&quot;, and held special events such as &quot;European Famous Paintings Appreciation Conference&quot;. In 1980, the turnover of Sapporo TV&#x27;s television department reached 8.34 billion yen, and the revenue of the broadcasting department reached 1.736 billion yen. In 1984, the turnover of Sapporo TV&#x27;s TV department exceeded 10 billion yen, and the broadcasting department exceeded 2 billion yen. In 1985, the listening rate of STV radio surpassed that of Hokkaido Broadcasting for the first time, and won the first place in Hokkaido. In 1991, Sapporo TV&#x27;s TV department had a turnover of 13.374 billion yen, and its broadcasting department had a turnover of 3.21 billion yen, becoming the private broadcasting company with the highest turnover in Hokkaido for the first time. In 1993, to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the broadcast, Sapporo TV held the &quot;Higashiyama Kaii&quot; exhibition, which attracted 100,000 people to visit. In the same year, Sapporo TV&#x27;s average audience rating for the whole day was 10.4%, the average audience rating for prime time was 16%, and the average audience rating for evening time was 15.3%. The first time to win the ratings triple crown in the Hokkaido area. In January 1996, Sapporo TV opened its official website. In 1998, the 40th anniversary of broadcasting, Sapporo TV opened a Berlin branch to strengthen the collection of overseas news. But in 2005, Sapporo TV closed the Berlin branch and opened the Moscow branch.

In 1993, STV ranked number 1 in TV ratings for the first time. In 1998, the 40th anniversary of the network, the network opened its NNN bureau in Berlin (later closed in 2005 and opened a news bureau in Moscow on the same year instead).

=== 2000s ===
On April 7, 2000, the Sapporo Media Park &quot;Spica&quot; invested by the network officially opened, becoming an important cultural base in Sapporo. However, due to continued losses, STV withdrew from operating Spica in 2007 (parts of the Spica building was later demolished by the following year) . Since 2003, STV was number 1 in TV ratings. On July 13, 2005, STV separated its radio operations into a wholly owned subsidiary, STV Radio.

On June 1, 2006, STV started digital broadcasting (which expanded its digital relay stations in its sub-prefectures by the following year. However, due to the increase in investment in digital TV equipment, Sapporo TV suffered a loss for the first time since its broadcast in 2006. Analog broadcasting then ended on July 24, 2011. As of 2019, STV has been number 1 in TV ratings for 12 years, with its all-day ratings also number 1 for 27 years since 1993 continuing to set the longest record in Japan.
===2020s===
On November 29, 2024, STV, alongside fellow NNN/NNS affiliates Yomiuri TV, Chukyo TV and Fukuoka Broadcasting System announced that it would combine and integrate its management operations to form a holding company known as Yomiuri Chukyo FS Broadcasting Holdings Corp. with its offices being located at NTVHD&#x27;s headquarters in Minato, Tokyo. The merger, classified as a joint stock transfer is expected to close on April 1, 2025 pending approval from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. Unlike a full restructuring of either STV, YTV, CTV and FBS, all four broadcasters would become wholly-owned subsidiaries of the combined company with its operations, including its corporate functions remaining intact. The sale was approved by the shareholders of all four broadcasters, including STV on December 24th of that year.
