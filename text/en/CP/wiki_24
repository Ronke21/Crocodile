<text>Stefan Leroy Moore (born 28 September 1983) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker.

He is a product of the Aston Villa Academy, where he came through the ranks with his younger brother, Luke Moore, who went on to play for Aston Villa and other teams in the Premier League. Dropping into non-League football in his mid-twenties, Moore became a prolific goalscorer at that level.

He started his career as a youth playing for Romulus before joining Aston Villa&#x27;s academy, captaining them to win the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Moore played for Aston Villa in the Premier League before going on loan spells to Football League clubs Chesterfield, Millwall and Leicester City. He then joined Queens Park Rangers where he played for three years, making 39 appearances in the League. He was loaned out to Port Vale in 2006 before joining Walsall, Kidderminster Harriers, and Halesowen Town.

He joined St Neots Town in 2010. He helped the club to the United Counties League Premier Division title and Huntingdonshire Senior Cup in 2010–11 and the Southern League Central Division title in 2011–12. He joined Leamington in December 2012 and was dual-registered with Brackley Town four months later. Leamington won the Southern League title in 2012–13. He joined Solihull Moors in December 2014 and helped the club to win promotion as champions of the National League North in 2015–16. He spent parts of the 2016–17 season with Brackley Town and Corby Town, and Leamington, helping Leamington to win promotion out of the Southern League Premier Division. He joined Tamworth via Redditch United in September 2018 before ending the year at Highgate United, where he later retired from semi-professional football.

==Career==

===Aston Villa===
Moore played for Romulus as a youth player before joining Aston Villa as an associated schoolboy, moving onto Youth Training Scheme status in April 2000 and turning professional in October 2001. Whilst at Aston Villa, Moore captained Villa&#x27;s youth in the FA Youth Cup final in 2002, and was named as man of the match as Villa beat Everton 4–1. Moore also picked up numerous caps for England youth sides at this time up to under-19 level.
During the 2001–02 season, Villa loaned Moore out to Second Division side Chesterfield. He made his professional debut on 27 October, as Chesterfield were defeated 1–0 by Blackpool; Moore was substituted in the 72nd-minute for Sean Parrish. He went on to play two more matches for Chesterfield in the Football League Trophy and Second Division, before being recalled by Villa at the end of the one month.

He broke into the Villa first-team in 2002–03. Firstly, in the summer of 2002, he played twice in the UEFA Intertoto Cup, against Swiss side FC Zürich and French club Lille OSC. He scored on the Premier League debut, a 75th minute substitute for Marcus Allbäck, he put an &quot; screamer&quot; past Charlton Athletic&#x27;s Dean Kiely on 11 September at Villa Park. He made a further fourteen appearances that season, playing at grounds such as Old Trafford and Anfield. A knee injury midway through the season caused manager Graham Taylor to insist on an extended rest period for the young midfielder. During this down-time he signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with the club.

Villa had a much improved season in 2003–04, and Moore found a first-team place more difficult to achieve. He made twelve appearances, eight of which were in the Premiership. On 20 December, he got onto the scoresheet at Blackburn Rovers&#x27; Ewood Park on the 62nd minute, five minutes later he was replaced by Darius Vassell as Villa held out for a 2–0 win. In January his career was on the rocks following a damaging ankle injury.

At the start of the 2004–05 season, he joined Championship club Millwall on loan. He played seven games for the &quot;Lions&quot;, including a 1–1 draw with Ferencvárosi TC in the UEFA Cup First round. His spell at The Den ended in early October, though David O&#x27;Leary only used him once – replacing Carlton Cole 54 minutes into a 1–0 home defeat by Manchester United on 28 December. In March, Moore returned to the Championship with Leicester City. He played seven games, but only got two starts for the &quot;Foxes&quot;. At the end of the season, he joined Ian Holloway&#x27;s Queens Park Rangers on a free transfer, putting pen to paper on a three-year deal.

===Queens Park Rangers===
He played 27 games in 2005–06, scoring goals against Sheffield United and Ipswich Town. At the start of the 2006–07 season he joined Martin Foyle&#x27;s Port Vale on a one-month loan, down in League One. He made fifteen appearances, scoring once against Northampton Town, his spell being extended numerous times, before returning to Loftus Road at the end of 2006. He played just three games for a struggling QPR side in April. Moore made twelve appearances at the start of the 2007–08 season, making the scoresheet in a 1–1 draw with Watford. In early 2008, he was let go by the club and in late February signed with Walsall, following a trial spell.

He scored four minutes into his debut for the &quot;Saddlers&quot; in what was the only goal at Luton Town&#x27;s Kenilworth Road on 1 March. He made a further four appearances that month before losing his first-team spot and getting released in the summer. In April 2008, Moore had an unsuccessful trial with Australian A-League side Melbourne Victory for two-weeks, turning out in a match against Whittlesea Zebras.

===Non-League===

He left English Football League, signing with Conference National side Kidderminster Harriers on a short-term contract in October 2008, following an injury to star striker Justin Richards. After staying at the club on rolling monthly contracts, he signed a more permanent deal in January. Moore scored his first league goal for Kidderminster Harriers away at Forest Green Rovers on 7 April, where he scored an equaliser for Kidderminster to earn a point. However, he made just nineteen appearances in 2008–09 and was later released.

Moore joined up with Solihull-based side Silhill, playing with their fourth team, Silhill Fourth XI, in the Birmingham and District AFA League Division Five, in an attempt to maintain fitness. He debuted in a 4–2 win against Parkfield Amateur Seconds. He followed this up with a hat-trick against Meriden Athletic the following week in a 6–1 win, helping the Sils&#x27; fourth string to a record-high seventh position in the league. He then signed for Southern League Premier Division club Halesowen Town. In September 2009, Moore was linked with a move to Farnborough, but stayed and managed to score 20 goals in his first 20 league appearances (along with two more in two Southern League Cup matches). He ended the 2009–10 season with 39 league goals.

Moore was the subject of a transfer offer from Brackley Town at the end of the 2009–10 season, with the club offering him a reported £1,000 per week to join them. After a season finishing just outside the play-off positions despite facing a 10-point deduction for going into administration, Moore criticised the owners of the club in the local newspaper &quot;Halesowen News&quot;. He claimed that the owners &quot;do not really know what they are doing&quot; and commented on their &quot;lack of ambition&quot;. Halesowen responded with an official club statement via their website, stating that they had fined Moore one month&#x27;s wages for his actions. Moreover, the club said they would be reporting two Football League clubs for making illegal approaches to sign Moore.

In October 2010, Moore was signed by United Counties League side St Neots Town for a reported five-figure fee, signing a two-and-a-half-year contract. The club breezed to the top of the table, breaking every record in the United Counties League, including 160 goals in a season and a 13–0 win at Yaxley. This won them promotion into the Southern League Division One Central for the 2011–12 season. They also won the Huntingdonshire Senior Cup after beating St Ives Town. They won the Division One Central title to claim a second successive promotion. He joined Leamington in December 2012, and scored three goals in his debut match against Bedworth United on 1 January 2013. Moore signed for Conference North side Brackley Town on 25 March 2012 in a dual registration deal with Leamington. He made his debut two days later in a 1–1 draw with Halesowen Town. Leamington won the Southern League title in 2012–13, whilst Brackley qualified for the play-offs with a third-place finish. He left Leamington to play solely for Brackley in January 2014. He scored 12 goals in 19 league games for the &quot;Saints&quot; in the 2013–14 campaign, and was named the Conference North Player of the Month for December. Moore returned to Leamington in May 2014 having turned down an extended contract offer from Brackley Town.

In December 2014, Moore joined Conference North side Solihull Moors. The &quot;Moors&quot; finished in 12th place in 2014–15, before going on to win promotion as champions in 2015–16. He returned to Brackley Town for a brief loan spell in the 2016–17 season. He joined Corby Town of the Northern Premier League Premier Division on loan on 1 November 2016. Manager Gary Mills said the signing showed &quot;great intent&quot;. He rejoined Leamington on dual registration in March 2017. The club secured promotion out of the Southern League Premier Division after beating Hitchin Town 2–1 in the play-off final at the end of the 2016–17 season. He scored two goals in ten games across the 2017–18 campaign as Leamington consolidated their National League North status.

On 8 August 2018, Moore joined Southern League Premier Division Central side Redditch United on a one-year deal;&quot;Reds&quot; manager Paul Davis said he was a &quot;magnificent capture&quot; and a &quot;game-changing&quot; player. On 26 September, he switched to league rivals Tamworth, who were managed by former St Neots Town boss Dennis Greene; he had previously had a trial at The Lamb Ground in the summer but was not offered a contract by head coach Mike Fowler. He joined Midland League Premier Division club Highgate United on dual registration in December 2018. The &quot;Gate&quot; finished 14th in the 2018–19 season.

==Personal life==
He attended Hodge Hill Sports and Enterprise College, in Hodge Hill, Birmingham. He has a younger brother, Luke Moore who is a professional footballer. The two were teammates at Aston Villa. Moore owned a taxi firm in Water Orton, Warwickshire, before selling it in 2015.

Moore&#x27;s son, Kobei, joined Aston Villa at Under-9 level and turned professional at the club in May 2023.

<text>Richard A. Hayward (born 17 March 1952) is a British businessman who was chairman of the English association football club Wolverhampton Wanderers from 2003 to 2006. He is the eldest son of Sir Jack Hayward.

==Biography==
Hayward was educated at Gordonstoun before completing an art degree at the University of Edinburgh. He worked for his father&#x27;s businesses in the Bahamas before embarking on an entrepreneurial career. His various business projects have included a property company, a wine business and several bars and restaurants in the Bahamas. He also owns numerous properties in the United Kingdom and the Bahamas. He frequently visits, as well as manages, his father&#x27;s shooting estate, Dunmaglass.

He became Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. chairman when his father retired in December 2003 after failing to find a purchaser or new investors for the club. He had already served as a club director since 1997. He stepped down as chairman in July 2006, citing increased business commitments as the reason for his decision.

He is married to Alexandra (née Sitwell), owner of Renishaw Hall. The couple have five children - Rupert, Giles, Bertie, Munchie and Rosie; Rupert also briefly served as a Wolves director.

<doc id="1323744" wikidata="Q1068737" url="?curid=1323744" title="Reunion (Black Sabbath album)">
<text>Reunion is a live album by English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, released on 19 October 1998. As implied by the title, the album features a reunion of the original lineup of vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward for the first time since &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; (1978). &quot;Psycho Man&quot;, one of two studio tracks on the album, was the last to feature Ward on drums. Black Sabbath received their first ever Grammy Award in 2000 for the live recording of &quot;Iron Man&quot; taken from &quot;Reunion&quot;.

On 13 October 2023, the album was released, remastered from the original source tapes and released world-wide with the two studio songs remastered by Danny Saber.

==Background==
Six years after founding member Ozzy Osbourne departed Black Sabbath under less than amicable circumstances, he briefly rejoined his former bandmates for a single performance on 13 July 1985 at the Live Aid benefit concert in Philadelphia, and again in 1992 for the climax of his No More Tours farewell tour. Much to the dismay of fans, neither brief reconciliation had resulted in a full-fledged Black Sabbath reunion resulting in a new album and tour. A serious attempt at a reunion in 1993 proved fruitless as the band members lamented the reappearance of old animus. In 1997, Osbourne, Iommi and Butler reunited for the 1997 Ozzfest shows as Black Sabbath. Ward was absent due to health issues, and he was replaced by Faith No More&#x27;s Mike Bordin. Ward had made a brief return to Black Sabbath for a short South American tour in 1994, but it was with Tony Martin fronting the band. Anticipation for a full and meaningful reunion of the Osbourne-era version of the band was high.

==Recording==
By late 1997, all four original members put aside their differences and misgivings and two shows in their hometown at the NEC were booked. On 4 and 5 December 1997, the four original members of Black Sabbath performed together with the shows recorded for a highly anticipated live album release. Ward had a heart condition, and concern regarding his health and ability to perform at a high level meant that another former Black Sabbath drummer, Vinny Appice, was on standby for the two homecoming shows. &quot;We hadn&#x27;t done a show with Bill for 18 years,&quot; remarked Iommi. Ward made it through both shows – albeit not without incident:

Along with live versions of classics such as &quot;Paranoid&quot;, &quot;N.I.B.&quot;, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; and &quot;Iron Man&quot;, the double album also included two newly recorded studio tracks: &quot;Selling My Soul&quot; and &quot;Psycho Man&quot;. These two new tracks were also released on a CD single in the United States. Music critics applauded the band&#x27;s decision to surprise fans by including unexpected songs which had not been played live in many years, such as &quot;Spiral Architect&quot; and &quot;Behind the Wall of Sleep&quot;.

<text>Richmond Staples Mill Road station is an Amtrak train station located in unincorporated Henrico County, Virginia, about northwest of downtown Richmond. It is served by the daily , , , , and several daily trains.

==History==

Amtrak took over intercity passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971. Ex-Seaboard Coast Line trains (, , and ) continued to use Broad Street Station in Richmond, while the Newport News section of the ex-Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (later ) continued to use Main Street Station. Amtrak abandoned Broad Street Station on November 15, 1975, with trains moving to Richmond Staples Mill Road station in suburban Henrico County. It was designed by David Volkert and Associates.

The &quot;James Whitcomb Riley&quot; moved from Main Street to a station at Ellerson (Mechanicsville) on October 15, 1975. Its Newport News section was discontinued on June 15, 1976; it was replaced with the New York City–Newport News , which stopped at Staples Mill Road. Staples Mill Road station was Amtrak&#x27;s only Richmond station until 2003, when &quot;Regional&quot; (later ) trains serving Newport News began also stopping at Main Street.

A second island platform was added around 2009. The parking lot was doubled in size in 2018.

===Future plans===
In May 2019, the federal and state governments approved the &quot;DC to Richmond&quot; plan for expanded rail service between Washington and the Richmond area. This plan would include improvements to Staples Mill station:
two accessible platforms, a pedestrian overpass or underpass, and replacement of the station building. All Richmond trains would stop at both Staples Mill and Main Street, after extensive track improvements. A new bridge would be built over the James River, and a rail yard constructed in South Richmond. The 2019 plan is coordinated with updates to the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor plan.

In October 2024, the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority was awarded a $5.8 million federal grant to improve platforms and accessibility and add a platform canopy at the station.

<text>Saltair, also The SaltAir, Saltair Resort, or Saltair Pavilion, is the name that has been given to several resorts located on the southern shore of the Great Salt Lake in Utah, United States, about west of Salt Lake City (most of which were located in what is now the city of Magna).

==History==

===Saltair I===

The first Saltair, completed in 1893, was jointly owned by a corporation associated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Salt Lake &amp; Los Angeles Railway (later renamed as the Salt Lake, Garfield, and Western Railway; not to be confused with the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad), which was constructed for the express purpose of serving the resort. Saltair was not the first resort built on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, but was the most successful ever built. A stunning example of early 20th century Moorish Revival architecture, the resort was designed by well-known Utah architect Richard K.A. Kletting and rested on over 2,000 posts and pilings, many of which remain and still are visible over 110 years later.

Intended from the beginning as the Western counterpart to Coney Island, Saltair was one of the early amusement parks, and for a time was the most popular family destination west of New York. The church sold the resort in 1906.

The first Saltair pavilion and a few other buildings were destroyed by fire on April 22, 1925.

===Saltair II===
A new pavilion was built, and the resort was expanded at the same location by new investors, but several factors prevented the second Saltair from achieving the success of its ancestor. The advent of motion pictures and radio, the onset of the Great Depression, and the interruption of the &quot;go to Saltair&quot; routine kept people closer to home. With a huge new dance floor – the world&#x27;s largest at the time – Saltair became more known as a dance palace, the amusement park becoming secondary to the great traveling bands of the day, such as Glenn Miller. Though Saltair showed motion pictures, there were other theaters more convenient to town.

In addition, the first Saltair had benefited from its location on the road from Salt Lake City to the Tooele Valley and to Skull Valley, which in the late 1800s was home to Iosepa, a large community of Polynesian Mormons. Being near a major intersection, Saltair also served as the first (or last) major facility on the road, making it a popular resting area for those travelling by horseback or wagon. When Saltair was rebuilt, however, this traffic was all but gone. Part of the reason was the advent of automobiles, bus and train service to the Tooele Valley, but the other cause was the abandonment of Iosepa, as Polynesians went to homes in the Salt Lake Valley or the community forming around the new LDS Temple in Laie on Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands.

Saltair thus had to survive solely against strong competition, and in a dwindling market. Disaster struck in 1931, in the form of a fire that caused over $100,000 in damage, then again in 1933 as the resort was left high and dry when lake waters receded, forcing the construction of a miniature railway to carry swimmers between the resort and the water. Saltair was forced to close during World War II, which forced the rationing of fuel and other resources while it took many of the resort&#x27;s paying customers – and vital employees – out of Utah. Reopening after the war, the resort found the same situation that it had faced in the 1930s. There were so many other entertainment options, closer to home, and the public was no longer in the habit of going &quot;all the way out there&quot;. The resort closed in 1958, causing the railroad to cease passenger operations at the same time.

Attempts over the next decade to breathe new life into the resort finally ended in November 1970 when an arson fire was set in the center of the wooden dance floor, destroying the main Saltair pavilion. A previous arson fire in September 1967 had destroyed the concourse, entry gate, concession stands, and various other support structures but spared the 

===Saltair III===
Proximity to Interstate 80, plus new population expansion into the Tooele Valley and the western Salt Lake Valley, prompted the construction of a third Saltair in 1981. The new pavilion was constructed out of a salvaged aircraft hangar from Hill Air Force Base, and located approximately a mile west of the original. Once again the lake was a problem, this time flooding the resort only months after it opened. The waters again receded after several years, and again new investors restored and repaired and planned, only to discover that the waters continued to move away from the site, again leaving it high and dry.

Concerts and other events have been held at the newest facility, but by the end of the 1990s, Saltair was little more than a memory, too small to compete with larger venues that were closer to the public. While there is occasionally activity now and then, through most of the early 21st century, the third Saltair was all but abandoned. In 2005 several investors from the music industry pooled together to purchase the building and are now holding regular concerts there.

===Remnants===
Relics of the age of the Great Salt Lake resorts are nearby, and can be seen from the highway. Until recently, the most noticeable of these was the skeleton of car &quot;502&quot;, one of the Salt Lake, Garfield &amp; Western&#x27;s interurban rail cars that sat beside the ruins of an old powerhouse. The powerhouse once fed lights and roller coasters at the entrance to the original Saltair. The rail car was removed on February 18, 2012, by the property owner for safety concerns. Rows of pilings snake outward toward the lake, all that remains of the railway trestle and pier that once led to the earlier Saltair resort. The surviving buildings of Lake Park, one of Saltair&#x27;s neighbors, were moved to a new site thirty miles away, where the Lagoon Amusement Park has grown around them.

The Salt Lake, Garfield &amp; Western still exists as a common carrier shortline railroad, providing switching service in the Salt Lake City area. However, the tracks no longer reach to the resort itself.

==In popular culture==
Saltair has occasionally been used as a backdrop for movies. Key scenes of the 1962 horror film &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; were shot in Saltair II. The 1993 film &quot;Josh and S.A.M.&quot; features a scene at the then dilapidated Saltair III, showing the exterior and interior. 

A photo session for the Beach Boys was held there in 1968 with various poses around Saltair II and was used in promotional materials as well as being featured on the cover of the bootleg Beach Boys album &quot;Unsurpassed Masters, Vol. 19.&quot;

The Saltair Pavilion is destroyed (along with much of Salt Lake City) by the eponymous creature in the 1972 underground independent film &quot;The Giant Brine Shrimp&quot; by Utah filmmaker Mike Cassidy.

The Pixies&#x27;s 1991 song &quot;Palace of the Brine&quot; is a reference to Saltair.

The music video for Mac Miller&#x27;s song &quot;Stay&quot; was filmed with Saltair III as the backdrop.

Saltair was featured in the 2021 episode of the paranormal reality show &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot;, largely as a result of allegations of the building being haunted. The crew claimed to have filmed a shadow figure, disembodied voices, and several other paranormal occurrences.

<text>Mount Hikurangi (or &quot;Te Ara ki Hikurangi&quot; in Māori) is a peak in the eastern corner of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, about north of Gisborne, and southwest of the East Cape Lighthouse. On a spur of the Raukumara Range in the Waiapu Valley, it is the North Island&#x27;s highest non-volcanic peak.

Mount Hikurangi is within the rohe of Ngāti Porou and Ngati Uēpohatu and is the iwi&#x27;s most significant icon. In Māori mythology, it was the first part of the North Island to emerge when Māui pulled it as a giant fish from the ocean. According to these beliefs, his waka, &quot;Nukutaimemeha&quot;, became stranded on the mountain, and lies petrified between the mountain&#x27;s peaks in Lake Hinetakawhiti.

Nearby summits include Whanokao (), Aorangi (), Wharekia () and Taitai (). Together, these mountains provide what &quot;Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand&quot; calls an &quot;awe-inspiring vista&quot;.

The early arrivals to Aotearoa commonly gave Polynesian ancestral names and symbolism to New Zealand places. Hikurangi and Aorangi were a pair of names transferred from Tahiti via Rarotonga to different parts of New Zealand Tahiti has a Mount Hiurai (Hi’ura’i/Hikurangi) at the summit of Mehetia (Me’eti’a) island. Rarotonga has Ikurangi, and maybe the origin of all these names is Si&#x27;ulagi(Si&#x27;ulangi)in Ta&#x27;u, Samoa.

== The first sunrise of the new day ==
The peak is traditionally regarded as the first land in the world to catch the rays of the new day&#x27;s sun, although this claim, like any such claim of its type, is open to interpretation. Certainly it is not true at any time of the year other than the Southern Hemisphere summer, as both Fiji and Tonga are to the east. In summer, however, because of the tilt of the Earth&#x27;s axis, it does receive the sun&#x27;s rays earlier than these places It does not receive them earlier than the Chatham Islands (or, of course, Antarctica), however, and in midsummer some parts of the South Island mainland (such as the peaks of Banks Peninsula and Dunedin&#x27;s Mount Cargill) receive the dawn&#x27;s light at almost exactly the same time. This did not stop the mountain gaining world prominence in the celebrations for the new Millennium, however.

According to the Department of Conservation, the mountain is &quot;recognised and accepted as the first point on the mainland to greet the morning sun&quot;. The traditional greeting of South Island iwi Ngāi Tahu to North Island visitors, &quot;Haere mai, e te Rāwhiti!&quot; (Welcome, O Sunrise!), references this fact. Celebrations by Ngāti Porou to commemorate the first dawn of the new millennium in 2000, including karakia led by Tamati and Amster Reedy, took place on the summit of the mountain. In addition, nine massive whakairo (carvings) depicting Māui&#x27;s story and his family were erected on the mountain as part of the celebrations. They were carved under Derek Lardelli&#x27;s guidance by students from Toihoukura, the Eastern Institute of Technology&#x27;s School of Māori Visual Arts.

== History ==
Before the arrival of Europeans, Mount Hikurangi was within Ngāti Porou&#x27;s territory. Ngāti Porou believe they are descendants of Māui, and thus have had a connection with the mountain since it arose from the sea. In the 1870s, the Crown acquired the mountain and turned it into a state forest park. In November 1990, ownership of Mount Hikurangi was returned to Ngāti Porou, who now manage the mountain, and facilitate the public&#x27;s access to it.

===19th-century gold prospecting===
There were several “gold rushes” on Mount Hikurangi in the early days of European settlement. In 1874, about 100 Māori went prospecting on and around Mount Hikurangi. However, Sir James Hector, who examined the Waiapu Valley, found no signs of gold. In 1875 “Scotty” Siddons, mate of the &quot;Beautiful Star&quot;, claimed to have met a Māori person on the East Coast who had a few ounces of gold. He, and a mate named Hill, found a lot of mundic on the north-west side of the mountain, but only outcrops of limestone on the higher slopes. In 1886 Reupane te Ana, of Makarika, discovered what he fondly imagined was an enormous deposit of gold in the area. With what Joseph Angus Mackay called “noble unselfishness”, he let all his friends into the secret. Drays, wheelbarrows and receptacles of all kinds were rushed to the scene, and large quantities of the “precious metal” were removed to a safe place. When it turned out that the metal was only mundic, Reupane became an object of ridicule, and, afterwards, was known as “Tommy Poorfellow.”

== Significance to Māori ==
Mount Hikurangi () is of great spiritual, cultural, and physical significance to Ngāti Porou. It is the iwi&#x27;s most important icon, and in Māori mythology, was the first part of the North Island to emerge when Māui, an ancestor of Ngāti Porou, pulled it as a giant fish from the ocean. According to these beliefs, his waka, , became stranded on the mountain, and lies petrified near the mountain&#x27;s summit. Another of Ngāti Porou&#x27;s mythological ancestors, Paikea, is also associated with the mountain. According to myth, Paikea&#x27;s younger half-brother, Ruatapu, attempted to kill about 70 of his older kin (&quot;brothers&quot;) at sea in Hawaiki to exact revenge on his father for belittling him as a low-born son of a slave. The massacre, called , was survived only by Paikea, who called on the sea gods and ancestors to save him. Paikea travelled to New Zealand on the back of a whale, but Ruatapu sent a great flood, called , to kill the survivors in New Zealand. Mt. Hikurangi became a refuge for the people from this deluge.

The mountain is often referenced in Ngāti Porou&#x27;s karakia (incantations), waiata (songs), haka (war dances), and pēpeha or whakatauākī (proverbs). Examples of these include:

* (Hikurangi the mountain, Waiapu the river, Ngati Porou the people). Ngāti Porou&#x27;s proverb of identity.
* (Behold, it is divine! It is human! It is divine! It is human! Ah!). Referring to Mt. Hikurangi, this is from the Ngāti Porou haka, Rūaumoko, named after the earthquake god.
* (Thrusting upward, is Hikurangi). From the haka, (Hearken to the faint call of the voice of Māui), celebrating the mythological rise of the mountain from the ocean.
* ([A] kaka feeding on the tawari at Hikurangi, [is as fat as the] moki in the sea). This saying represents plentiful food.
* (Te Rangi-tāwaea [a Ngāti Porou ancestor] dons his garments). Said when Mount Hikurangi is covered in snow.

Some famous Māori quotes involving Hikurangi include:

* (Hikurangi is not a travelling mountain). The mountain of Hikurangi did not have a legend involving movement, and Te Kani-a-Takirau referenced this to justify his unwillingness to leave the area when he turned down the Māori Kingship, also saying he was &quot;a king already through [his] ancestors&quot;.
* (Enough, let him come hither to Hikurangi, to the mountain on which rests the snow). Said by Te Aotaki, instructing his tribe to welcome Tūwhakairiora, who came to avenge the murder of Poroumātā, his grandfather, and no doubt to undergo tohi (a rite to cause bravery), and possibly marry one of his daughters. Another version of the quote is (Let him come to me, to Hikurangi, the mountain covered with snow).

== Flora and fauna ==

The summit of Mount Hikurangi is the northernmost place where New Zealand&#x27;s alpine vegetation can be seen. Among the alpine shrubs and delicate herbs found there are large buttercups (&quot;Ranunculus&quot; spp.), and prickly wild Spaniards (&quot;Aciphylla&quot; spp.).

The mountain contains the only known habitat of a small sub-alpine shrub, the Hikurangi tutu (&quot;Coriaria pottsiana&quot;), found on the grassy scree slope behind the Mount Hikurangi Tramping Hut at .

Mount Hikurangi was the location of the last known mainland sighting of the North Island saddleback in 1910, before its reintroduction to the North Island on the 16th of June 2002 at Zealandia in Wellington. In Māori times, kaka would fatten themselves on the berries of the tawari trees growing on the mountain. In the 1960s, members of the Gisborne Tramping Club heard what they thought may have been the call of a kākāpō on the mountain, a parrot whose last documented existence in the North Island was in 1895.

The nearby Raukumara Forest Park&#x27;s forests include a wide range of podocarp-broadleaved species such as rimu, rātā, tawa, hinau, rewarewa, kāmahi, kahikatea, miro, beech and tōtara. Native birds and animals found in the area include pīwakawaka, tūī, whio, kākā, falcons, kererū, brown kiwi, Hochstetter&#x27;s frogs, snails, lizards, skinks, &quot;Motuweta riparia&quot; (Raukumara tusked wētā), and short- and long-tailed bats. Introduced animals include deer, goats, possums, pigs, cattle and mustelidae, all of which pose a threat to the native wildlife.

==Recreation==
Mount Hikurangi is about north of Gisborne by road. Visitors to the mountain are asked to contact Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Porou before arriving, as the track crosses their private land, which is sometimes closed for short periods for cultural or farming reasons. While there is no public vehicle or bicycle access beyond the car park near the bottom, 4x4 tours to the carvings can be organised through Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Porou, who also offer a summit guide and an overnight guide. From the car park, it is about a 7-hour walk to the summit. There is a hut for public use 4–5 hours up the mountain, but visitors must bring their own cooker and water. Bookings for the hut are also made through Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Porou. Visitors are advised to be cautious of the mountain&#x27;s unpredictable weather, and to bring clothing suitable for all weather conditions.

Hunting of introduced species is permitted in the nearby Raukumara Forest Park.

<text>Although not as prominent as its eastern namesake, Northland&#x27;s Mount Hikurangi is also of note. At , this peak overlooks central Northland and is a prominent peak on the skyline at the Bay of Islands, the area of the first permanent European settlement in New Zealand.

Hikurangi&#x27;s height is shown on LINZ maps as and in a regional plan. It forms the upper catchments of the Awarua, Kaikou and Punakitere rivers. There is a communications mast on the summit, serviced by a track through the bush. The mountain is formed of Cretaceous-Paleocene ophiolitic volcanics. It forms part of Tokawhero Forest, which has been logged. The secondary kauri-podocarp-broadleaved forest is now dominated by totara and kānuka, with kauri, tōwai, taraire, kahikatea, rewarewa, rimu, pukatea, northern rata, tanekaha and miro scattered emergents. Several uncommon species live in the bush, including Punctidae snails.

There are also two other hills in the area to the north and west of Whangārei with the same name; a volcanic cone near Hikurangi and a hill to the south of the Hikurangi River valley. Also in Northland, a Hikurangi rises to the south of Taipa.

<text>Andrzej Bursa (21 March 1932 – 15 November 1957) was a Polish poet and writer.

Born in Kraków, he studied journalism, then Bulgarian at Jagiellonian University in Kraków. In 1954–1957 Bursa worked as a journalist and reporter for the Kraków newspaper &quot;Dziennik Polski&quot;. Many of his contemporaries attributed his early death at the age of 25 to suicide, while the true cause of it was a congenital heart disease. He was buried at the Rakowicki Cemetery.

Bursa published his first poem in 1954. A prolific writer, he published 37 poems and a short story in different magazines during his lifetime. He died of a heart attack in 1957. Shortly thereafter, his first poetry collection was published, an important event in Polish poetry. Presently, there is a poetry prize named after Bursa which many living Polish poets have won (e.g. Ewa Lipska and Stanisław Barańczak).

<doc id="1323770" wikidata="Q6521359" url="?curid=1323770" title="Lemon ice box pie">
<text>Lemon ice box pie is an icebox pie consisting of lemon juice, eggs, and condensed milk in a pie crust, frequently made of graham crackers and butter. It is a variant of key lime pie; in both, the citric acidity sets the egg yolks, with minimal baking. There are also no bake versions.

==History==

No-bake icebox pies like the lemon icebox pie first became features of American cuisine in the 1930s, becoming more popular in the 1950s and 1960s as refrigerators became a standard item of the American kitchen. They are associated with the food traditions of the cuisine of the Southern United States.

A 1936 recipe for stovetop lemon icebox pie was made by combining flour, cornstarch and sugar in a double boiler and gradually adding water to create a smooth batter, adding butter and stirring constantly. Egg yolks are stirred in and briefly cooked, then the mixture is taken off the heat and the lemon zest and juice are added, whipped egg whites are folded in, and the mixture is set aside to cool, then poured into a pie dish lined with ladyfingers or vanilla wafers. The pie is chilled in the refrigerator and topped with whipped cream before serving.

==Preparation==

To make the pie, sweetened condensed milk is whisked with fresh lemon juice and cream cheese. Separately, the egg yolks are whisked with the lemon zest until they become pale in color, then the condensed milk mixture is added gradually to the eggs. The crust can be made with vanilla wafers that are combined with melted butter and sugar until the consistency of wet sand, then pressed into a pie pan to form a crust. The crust is lightly baked, then filled with the filling. The pie is baked gently and allowed to set for several hours in the refrigerator. Before serving, it is topped with fresh whipped cream that can be flavored with lemon zest.

The classic version of the no bake pie was made with eggs. Although cooks of that era said &quot;the lemon juice has the effect of cooking the eggs&quot;, the modern day recommendation is to heat the raw egg yolk briefly on the stovetop.

No bake versions can be made without eggs. The filling has been described as &quot;light and delicate in flavor&quot; and is made with just three ingredients: condensed milk, lemon zest and fresh lemon juice.

<doc id="1323795" wikidata="Q3567433" url="?curid=1323795" title="West Lawn, Chicago">
<text>West Lawn, one of Chicago&#x27;s 77 official community areas, is located on the southwest side of the city. It is considered to be a &quot;melting pot&quot; of sorts, due to its constant change of races moving in and out of the area, as well as the diversity that exists there. West Lawn is home to many Polish-Americans, Irish-Americans, Mexican-Americans, and other people of Latin American and Eastern European origin.

== History ==
Chicago Lawn, to the east, was settled while the marshy land of West Lawn remained unsettled. Some housing was built during the 1920s, but it still remained swampy land. Houses were built during the 1930s which then reported German-Americans, Irish-Americans, Polish-Americans, Czech-Americans and Italian-Americans living in the area. The area had been growing until the Great Depression, when the economy declined. After World War II, growth continued and new houses and streets were built. The Airport Homes race riots of 60th &amp; Karlov in 1946 were intended to keep black people out of the area. After the 1970s, more Mexican-Americans, Irish-Americans, and Polish immigrants started settling the area.

== Notability ==

West Lawn is the home of the Balzekas Museum of Lithuanian Culture along Pulaski. It was founded by Lithuanian-American businessman Stanley Balzekas Jr., and is the only museum in the US devoted to the subjects of Lithuania, the Lithuanian language, history, culture and politics, and to the Lithuanian-American experience.

One small business in the neighborhood, the Capitol Cigar Store at 63rd and Pulaski, features a tall Native American statue as the landmark of West Lawn. The statue is most notable for being seen in the movie &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;.

==Education==
West Lawn is part of City of Chicago School District #299 and City Colleges of Chicago District #508.

== Ford City ==
Ford City is a neighborhood on the southwest side of Chicago which immediately surrounds the Ford City Mall, in turn named for the Ford Aircraft plant which previously occupied the site; the location was also the site of the Dodge Chicago Plant, which after World War II became the factory for the Tucker Car Corporation. In the future, the Orange Line of the Chicago &quot;L&quot; might be extended here.

==Notable people==
* Michael Madigan, 67th and 69th Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives. He is a current resident of, and incumbent member of the Illinois House of Representatives for, West Lawn.
* Frank Savickas, member of the Illinois Senate from 1970 until 1992. He resided in West Lawn during his political career, later moving to Venice, Florida.
* Leo Stefanos, inventor of the DoveBar.

==Politics==
West Lawn has supported the Democratic nominee by large margins in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, West Lawn cast 8,429 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 1,328 votes for Donald Trump (83.12% to 13.10%). In the 2012 presidential election, West Lawn cast 6,715 votes for Barack Obama and cast 1,443 votes for Mitt Romney (81.37% to 17.49%).

West Lawn is split between the 13th ward represented by Marty Quinn, and 23rd represented by Silvana Tabares on the Chicago City Council.

<text>Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) is a technique used in molecular biology to obtain the full length sequence of an RNA transcript found within a cell. RACE results in the production of a cDNA copy of the RNA sequence of interest, produced through reverse transcription, followed by PCR amplification of the cDNA copies (see RT-PCR). The amplified cDNA copies are then sequenced and, if long enough, should map to a unique genomic region. RACE is commonly followed up by cloning before sequencing of what was originally individual RNA molecules. A more high-throughput alternative which is useful for identification of novel transcript structures, is to sequence the RACE-products by next generation sequencing technologies.

== Process ==
RACE can provide the sequence of an RNA transcript from a small known sequence within the transcript to the 5&#x27; end (5&#x27; RACE-PCR) or 3&#x27; end (3&#x27; RACE-PCR) of the RNA. This technique is sometimes called &quot;one-sided PCR&quot; or &quot;anchored PCR&quot;.

The first step in RACE is to use reverse transcription to produce a cDNA copy of a region of the RNA transcript. In this process, an unknown end portion of a transcript is copied using a known sequence from the center of the transcript. The copied region is bounded by the known sequence, at either the 5&#x27; or 3&#x27; end.

The protocols for 5&#x27; or 3&#x27; RACES differ slightly. 5&#x27; RACE-PCR begins using mRNA as a template for a first round of cDNA synthesis (or reverse transcription) reaction using an &quot;anti-sense&quot; (reverse) oligonucleotide primer that recognizes a known sequence in the middle of the gene of interest; the primer is called a &quot;gene specific primer&quot; (GSP). The primer binds to the mRNA, and the enzyme reverse transcriptase adds base pairs to the 3&#x27; end of the primer to generate a specific single-stranded cDNA product; this is the reverse complement of the mRNA. Following cDNA synthesis, the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is used to add a string of identical nucleotides, known as a homopolymeric tail, to the 3&#x27; end of the cDNA. (There are some other ways to add the 3&#x27;-terminal sequence for the first strand of the de novo cDNA synthesis which are much more efficient than homopolymeric tailing, but the sense of the method remains the same). 
PCR is then carried out, which uses a second anti-sense gene specific primer (GSP2) that binds to the known sequence, and a sense (forward) universal primer (UP) that binds the homopolymeric tail added to the 3&#x27; ends of the cDNAs to amplify a cDNA product from the 5&#x27; end.

3&#x27; RACE-PCR uses the natural polyA tail that exists at the 3&#x27; end of all eukaryotic mRNAs for priming during reverse transcription, so this method does not require the addition of nucleotides by TdT. cDNAs are generated using an Oligo-dT-adaptor primer (a primer with a short sequence of deoxy-thymine nucleotides) that complements the polyA stretch and adds a special adaptor sequence to the 5&#x27; end of each cDNA. PCR is then used to amplify 3&#x27; cDNA from a known region using a sense GSP, and an anti-sense primer complementary to the adaptor sequence.

==RACE-sequencing==
The cDNA molecules generated by RACE can be sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technologies (also called, RACE-seq). High-throughput sequencing characterization of RACE fragments is highly time-efficient, more sensitive, less costly and technically feasible compared to traditional characterization of RACE fragments with molecular cloning followed by Sanger sequencing of a few clones.

=== History and applications ===
RACE can be used to amplify unknown 5&#x27; (5&#x27;-RACE) or 3&#x27; (3&#x27;-RACE) parts of RNA molecules where part of the RNA sequence is known and targeted by a gene-specific primer. Combined with high-throughput sequencing for characterization of these amplified RACE products, it is possible to apply the approach to characterize any types of coding or non-coding RNA-molecules.

The idea of combining RACE with high-throughput sequencing was first introduced in 2009 as Deep-RACE to perform mapping of Transcription start sites (TSS) of 17 genes in a single cell-line. For example, In a study from 2014 to accurately map cleavage sites of target RNA directed by synthetic siRNAs, the approach was first named RACE-seq. Further, the methodology was used to characterize full-length unknown parts of novel transcripts and fusion transcripts in colorectal cancer. 
In another study aiming to characterize unknown transcript structures of lncRNAs, RACE was used in combination with semi-long 454 sequencing.

<doc id="1323814" wikidata="Q5455963" url="?curid=1323814" title="Five Guys Walk into a Bar...">
<text>Five Guys Walk into a Bar... is a comprehensive four-disc retrospective of the British rock group Faces released in 2004, collecting sixty-seven tracks from among the group&#x27;s four studio albums, assorted rare single A and B-sides, BBC sessions, rehearsal tapes and one track from a promotional flexi-disc, &quot;Dishevelment Blues&quot; – a deliberately-sloppy studio romp, captured during the sessions for their &quot;Ooh La La&quot; album, which was never actually intended for official release.

Eight of ten tracks from 1973&#x27;s &quot;Ooh La La&quot; appear (along with a live version of &quot;My Fault&quot;), as do eight of nine from 1971&#x27;s &quot;A Nod Is as Good as a Wink...To a Blind Horse&quot;, five of nine from 1971&#x27;s &quot;Long Player&quot; (with an additional two in alternative versions) and three of ten from 1970&#x27;s &quot;First Step&quot; (originally credited to &quot;Small Faces&quot;). Other vintage Faces tracks long sought-after by collectors and completists had never been compiled before (such as the studio-recorded US-only single version of their take on Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot;, or the obscure dobro-driven B-side &quot;Skewiff (Mend the Fuse)&quot;). The song that opens this set, &quot;Flying&quot;, is a subtly remixed version of the track which originally appeared on &quot;First Step&quot;. &quot;Wyndlesham Bay&quot; is an early version of one of Rod Stewart&#x27;s &#x27;solo&#x27; songs, &quot;Jodie&quot;, with different lyrics (although as the credit on the record label of the single itself clearly attests, &quot;Jodie&quot; is itself a later Faces performance of this song, likely recorded at the same session as &#x27;Poolhall Richard&#x27;, that has since been incorrectly credited to Stewart as a solo artist).

Many tracks from BBC sessions also appear throughout, including Faces takes on Stewart&#x27;s own &quot;Maggie May&quot; and &quot;Gasoline Alley,&quot; the latter as part of a medley including &quot;Around the Plynth.&quot; The Faces&#x27; earliest recordings are represented by rehearsal excerpts from the summer of 1969, including covers of Big Bill Broonzy&#x27;s &quot;I Feel So Good&quot; (featuring Stewart on guitar and Ronnie Wood on harmonica) and Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Evil.&quot;

The set was compiled by the group&#x27;s keyboardist, Ian McLagan, who had previously compiled 1999&#x27;s &quot;Good Boys... When They&#x27;re Asleep&quot;, and his liner notes offer a unique and intimate take on the band&#x27;s history alongside a fulsome tribute to late Faces founder member Ronnie Lane.

&quot;Five Guys Walk into a Bar...&quot; has received a largely positive response from critics since its release. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the box set as the best of its type: &quot;There has never been a better box set than the Faces&#x27; Five Guys Walk into a Bar... There has never been a box that captures an artist so perfectly, nor has a box set taken greater advantage of unreleased and rare material, to the point where it seems as essential and vital as the released recordings.&quot;

<text>Railways of Australia Container Express or RACE was a slightly wider version of the standard ISO shipping container able to take 2 Australia Standard Pallets side by side. More than 1,000 units were operated by the Railways of Australia, an association of the government-owned railways which comprised Australian National, the State Rail Authority of New South Wales, Queensland Railways, the Victorian State Transport Authority and Westrail. These entities operated in Australia prior to privatisation of freight services.

==History==
The RACE containers were developed in 1974 in New South Wales by the Public Transport Commission, and built by Freighter Industries Ltd. The RACE general container was designed to accommodate 20 standard pallets stacked in two levels. Carrying capacity was and it had rear and side doors for ease of loading and unloading. There were also ISO RACE containers for non-palletised freight, as well as ventilated, refrigerated and side-loading containers.

<doc id="1323819" wikidata="Q4661002" url="?curid=1323819" title="A-unit">
<text>An A-unit, in railroad terminology, is a diesel locomotive (or more rarely an electric locomotive) equipped with a driving cab and a control system to control other locomotives in a multiple unit, and therefore able to be the lead unit in a consist of several locomotives controlled from a single position. This terminology is generally used in North America, since only there was it commonplace to build B-units—cabless locomotive units which normally could not lead a train.

==Typical features==
Typical driving cab features, and therefore A-unit features, include windshields, rectangular side windows, crew seats, heating, and sometimes, radios, air conditioning and toilets. B-units always lack all of these features, except that some EMD F-units have an extra porthole-style side window(s) for a hostler (an employee permitted to move a locomotive in a yard only, not on the road).

==Terminology==
This terminology has fallen out of use for newer locomotives, since it only really applied to the cab unit style of locomotive. Thus, the term &quot;cab unit&quot; is used only when an A-unit has a carbody design. Hood unit &quot;road switcher&quot; types were generally equipped with driving cabs and the term &quot;A-unit&quot; was not generally applied to them, although the rare cabless road switchers were still called &quot;B-units&quot;.

==Conversions==
In some cases, A-units were converted to B-units. If the unit had been involved in a collision which damaged the cab, it was sometimes more cost-effective to rebuild the unit without the cab. In rarer cases, B-units were converted to A-units. The Chicago and North Western Railway converted several E8B units purchased from the Union Pacific Railroad. The cabs on the rebuilt units were referred to as &quot;Crandall Cabs.&quot; The BNSF also experimented with a single GP60B to make it an A-unit by using an Ex-UP SD40-2 cab on a GP60B frame and body, also required to move was the Dynamic blister from the front of the unit to the middle of the unit to make room for the cab.

<text>Luke Isaacc Moore (born 13 February 1986) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker. He represented England at England U21 level. He is the younger brother of former professional footballer Stefan Moore and uncle to current Aston Villa youth team player Kobei Moore.

==Club career==
===Aston Villa===
As a youngster, Moore played for Romulus and Tame Valley Primary School. As a member of Aston Villa&#x27;s youth academy, he was prohibited from appearing for his secondary school, Hodge Hill college, but nevertheless appeared in &quot;a couple of cup games&quot; for the school. Moore is the younger brother of the former Queens Park Rangers and Aston Villa striker Stefan Moore. Together they were a crucial part of the Villa FA Youth Cup winning team of 2002. In April 2002, Moore moved onto YTS status and then in February 2004, he signed his professional contract with the club.

In December 2003, Moore was loaned to Wycombe Wanderers, who had failed in their approach for him earlier in the season. He made his Wycombe Wanderers début in a 1–1 draw against Notts County on 13 December 2003. Moore only had to wait until his next game, against AFC Bournemouth to score his début goal in a 2–0 victory. On 3 January 2004, he scored his first career hat-trick in a 4–1 home win over Grimsby Town. His loan spell at Wycombe Wanderers ended shortly after.

Upon his return to Aston Villa, Moore made his first-team debut, as a substitute in a 2–2 draw against Birmingham City. At the start of the 2004–05 season, he made his first appearance of the season, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2–0 win against Southampton in the opening game of the season. Since then, Moore found himself in and out of the starting line–up in the first team, as he found himself in a competition with Juan Pablo Ángel, Carlton Cole and Darius Vassell over the striker position. As a result, Moore appeared in the first team, mostly coming on as a substitute. On 5 February 2005, when Moore made his first starts for Aston Villa and played the whole game, as they lost 3–1 against Arsenal. His first senior goal for Villa came in the 2–0 victory against Middlesbrough on 5 March 2005. At the end of the 2004–05 season, he went on to make twenty–two appearances and scoring once in all competitions. Shortly after, Moore signed a contract extension with the club, signing a three–year contract with a 12-month option extension.

Ahead of the 2005–06 season, Moore made an impression in the club&#x27;s pre–season tour, including scoring six times in a 14–0 win against Gällstads on 20 July 2005. Despite Villa signing additional forwards such as Kevin Phillips and Milan Baroš in the summer of 2005, Moore kept his place in the first-team squad, starting some games and coming on from the bench in others. The departure of Phillips and the injury to Baroš ensured his place as a starter for the first team at the beginning of the Premiership season. He then scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–1 loss against Chelsea on 24 September 2005. As a result, Moore became the first player to breach Chelsea&#x27;s defence this season, leading to earn £10,000 and gave it to a local charity of his choosing. This was followed up by scoring his second goal of the season, in a 3–2 loss against Middlesbrough. Two months later on 28 December 2005, he scored his third goal of the season, in a 3–3 draw against Fulham. Moore then scored an equalising goal, in a 1–1 draw against Chelsea on 1 February 2006. Three days later on 4 February 2006, Moore scored his first Premiership hat-trick for Villa, again against Middlesbrough. A week later on 11 February 2006, he scored his eighth goal of the season, in a 2–1 loss against Newcastle United. His performance in a number of matches earned praise from his teammates and Manager David O&#x27;Leary. However, towards the end of the 2005–06 season, Moore lost his first team place and was placed at the reserve side. Despite this, his eight league goals have played a crucial part but only because of injuries to Villa&#x27;s senior strikers and went on to make thirty–two appearances in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2006–07 season, Moore faced uncertainty over his future at Aston Villa following a new ownership. Eventually, his future at the club was resolved following talks with new Manager Martin O&#x27;Neill. He scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–0 win against Newcastle United on 27 August 2007. Moore then scored his second goal of the season, in a 2–0 victory over Charlton Athletic on 23 September 2006. At the start of the 2006–07 season, he was featured in the first team for the first eight matches of the season. Moore sustained a serious injury to his right shoulder in a game against Chelsea, an injury which had been persistent during his career. Moore travelled to the US to undergo surgery in October 2006, with Cleveland Browns&#x27; head team physician Anthony Miniaci carrying out the procedure, following advice from Aston Villa chairman Randy Lerner. After spending three months on the sidelines, he returned from injury, playing in a behind close door match against Walsall on 24 January 2007. Following this, Moore appeared in a handful matches in the club&#x27;s reserve to regain his fitness. He even rejected a loan move to a Championship club, preferring to regain his fitness at the club&#x27;s reserve side instead. Moore returned from his shoulder injury on 9 April 2007, coming on as a substitute for Shaun Maloney against Wigan Athletic at Villa Park. On 14 April 2007, having again come on as a substitute, he scored with a header in a 3–1 win against Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium. Moore came on against Bolton Wanderers in the last Villa game of the season to equalise in the 83rd minute, earning Villa a draw. At the end of the 2006–07 season, he went on to make fourteen appearances and scoring four times in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2007–08 season, Moore was linked a move away from Aston Villa, with clubs around England interested in signing him. Amid the transfer speculation, he scored a hat trick for Aston Villa in the friendly match with Toronto FC on 25 July 2007. Three days later on 28 July 2007, Moore scored in a follow–up match, in a 3–1 win against Columbus Crew. His performance earned praise from Manager O&#x27;Neill. He continued to be featured in and out of the starting eleven for the side, mostly coming from the substitute bench. Despite this, Moore scored his first goal of the season, in a 5–0 win against Wrexham in the second round of the League Cup. Two months later on 28 October 2007, he scored his second goal of the season, in a 1–1 draw against Bolton Wanderers. However, Moore&#x27;s poor performance led him to be dropped from the first team, as well as, his own injury concern. As a result, he was expected to leave West Bromwich Albion despite having his contract option taken up by Aston Villa. By the time he departed from the club, Moore went on to make fifteen appearances and scoring two times in all competitions.

===West Bromwich Albion===
In January 2008, Villa manager Martin O&#x27;Neill revealed that Rangers manager Walter Smith had contacted him about possibly signing Moore. O&#x27;Neill quoted Rangers with a price of £3.5 million for Moore. A month later on 22 February, Moore joined rivals West Bromwich Albion on loan until the end of the season, signing a deal to join permanently for £3.5 million in the summer of 2008.

Moore made his Albion debut on 23 February 2008, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2–1 home defeat to Hull City. He received the first red card of his career in a 4–1 home defeat to Leicester City on 15 March 2008. Despite being suspended, Moore was featured in and out of the starting eleven for the side, mostly coming on from the substitute bench. West Bromwich Albion was promoted to the Premier league after beating Queens Park Rangers 2–0 in the last game of the season. At the end of the 2007–08 season, he went on to make ten appearances in all competitions.

On 28 May 2008, Moore completed his transfer to the newly promoted Premiership side for a fee of £3 million. Ahead of the 2008–09 season, he was challenged by Manager Tony Mowbray to fight his way to the first team. However at the start of the 2008–09 season, he suffered a thigh injury that kept him out for two weeks. Moore&#x27;s first game after signing for the club on a permanent basis came on 26 August 2008 against Hartlepool United in the second round of the League Cup, starting the whole game, in a 3–1 loss. Since returning from injury, he found himself in and out of the starting line–up, mostly coming on from the substitute bench and his form struggled. As a result, local newspaper Birmingham Mail branded both Scott Carson and Moore as &quot;miserable pair&quot; from Aston Villa, due to &quot;becoming the on-pitch jokers&quot; in the club&#x27;s recent matches. He then scored his first goal for West Brom on 21 December 2008 against Manchester City. Despite earning support from his teammates to regain his goal scoring form, Moore failed to exceed expectations and found himself in a sidelined, including another thigh injury. Eventually, the club was relegated to the Championship after losing 2–0 against Liverpool on 17 May 2009. At the end of the 2008–09 season, he went on to make twenty–three appearances and scoring once in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2009–10 Championship season, Moore was allowed to leave the club following his performance last season. But he quickly impressed Manager Roberto Di Matteo, scoring three times in the club&#x27;s pre–season friendly matches. In the opening game of the season against Newcastle United, Moore set up the opening goal for Shelton Martis, in a 1–1 draw. A week later on 18 August 2009, he opened his account with a brace in the 3–2 victory at Peterborough United. Since the start of the 2009–10 season, Moore regained his first team place under the management of Di Matteo and formed a partnership with Simon Cox. Despite suffering injuries on two occasions in September, he managed to score his third goal of the season, as well as, setting up two goals, in a 5–0 win against Watford on 31 October 2009. Moore soon became a subject of chant from West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s supporters over his goal scoring form. Two months later on 26 December 2009, he scored his fourth goal of the season, in a 2–0 win against Peterborough United. However, Moore&#x27;s scoring record after was poor in the second half of the season that he was subjected of booing by the club&#x27;s supporters. As a result, Moore was demoted to the substitute bench for the rest of the 2009–10 season. Despite this, the club was promoted back to the Premier League after beating Doncaster Rovers 3–2 on 10 April 2010. At the end of the 2009–10 season, he went on to make twenty–nine appearances and scoring four times in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2010–11 season, it was widely expected that he would leave West Bromwich Albion during the 2010 summer transfer window. Amid to his future at the club, he made one appearance for the side, which came in a 2–0 win against Leyton Orient in the first round of the League Cup, which was his only appearance of the season for West Bromwich Albion. Upon leaving West Bromwich Albion, the club&#x27;s chairman Jeremy Peace said he regretted signing Moore for paying a big transfer fee.

====Derby County (loan)====
On 1 September 2010, Moore was not included in West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s 25-man squad for the new season therefore deeming him surplus to requirements at the Hawthorns, a move which saw him join Football League Championship side Derby County later that same month on a 29-day loan deal.

Moore made his Derby County debut on 25 September 2010 against Crystal Palace, coming on as 74th-minute substitute, in a 5–0 win. Moore was primarily used as a substitute in at the start of his spell at &quot;The Rams&quot;, three of his four appearances coming as substitute, but impressed enough for Derby boss Nigel Clough to want to extent his spell at Pride Park. The same day as Clough announced his desire to retain Moore&#x27;s services, he scored his first goal for the club, on his second start, with the opener in a 3–2 victory at Doncaster Rovers. The next week, it was announced his Derby loan had been extended for a further month, the loan was further extended to the end of December.

Moore later scored two goals in two matches on 20 November 2010 and 27 November 2010 against Scunthorpe United and Burnley. Derby manager Nigel Clough was keen to extend his loan until the end of the season in December, but after scoring in a 5–2 defeat against Nottingham Forest in the East Midlands derby game at the City Ground, Moore returned to West Brom stating that he wanted to keep his options open for the January transfer window. Moore scored 4 times in 13 league appearances for &quot;The Rams&quot; of which 9 were starts.

===Swansea City===
After a frustrating spell at West Bromwich Albion, Moore signed for Swansea City on a two-and-a-half-year deal on 7 January 2011 for an undisclosed fee rumoured to be a free transfer. Upon joining the club, he said that he was motivated to work under Brendan Rodgers.

Moore made his debut against Colchester United on 8 January 2011 in the FA Cup. Since making his debut for the club, he quickly became involves in the first team, playing in the striker position. Moore scored his first goal for Swansea in a home victory against Doncaster Rovers on 19 February 2011, which was followed up by his second Swansea goal came in a 3–0 win over Leeds United on 26 February 2011. However, he lost his first team place following the arrival of Tamás Priskin and Fabio Borini, resulting in his playing time coming on from the substitute bench for the rest of the season. A month later on 25 April 2011, Moore scored his third goal of the season, as well as, setting up one of the goals, in a 4–1 win against Ipswich Town. He was involved in three matches in the play-offs, as Swansea City was promoted to the Premier League. At the end of the 2010–11 season, Moore went on to make thirteen appearances and scoring four times.

At the start of the 2011–12 season, Moore made his first appearance of the season, starting the whole game, in a 3–1 loss against Shrewsbury Town in the second round of the EFL Cup. However, he found his first team opportunity limited, just making four appearances in the first half of the season. Moore then scored his first goal of the season, on 3 December 2011, in a 4–2 loss against Blackburn Rovers. He continued to receive his playing time, mostly coming from the substitute bench. Moore scored his second goal of the season, in a 2–1 loss against Bolton Wanderers in the fourth round of the FA Cup. He then scored a late goal against Manchester City which was the winning goal on 11 March 2012 in a 1–0 victory. That result knocked Man City down to second place due to Manchester United 2–0 win over West Brom. After the match, Moore praised Wayne Routledge&#x27;s performance and contribution for his assist, leading him to score with a header. Eventually, the club avoided relegation following a 4–4 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 28 April 2012. At the end of the 2011–12 season, he went on to make twenty–two appearances and scoring three times in all competitions.

At the start of the 2012–13 season, Moore started the season well when he scored twice, as well as, setting up one of the club&#x27;s first goal of the game, in a 3–1 win against Barnsley in the first round of the League Cup campaign. Moore then set up a goal for Routledge to score the club&#x27;s second goal of the game, in a 2–2 draw against Reading on 6 October 2012. However, under the new management of Michael Laudrup, Moore&#x27;s first team opportunities continued to be limited. In order to get playing time, Moore was linked with a loan move to Blackburn Rovers, which never happened. From 2 March 2013, Moore scored three goals against Newcastle United, West Brom and Norwich City earned praise from Laudrup, mentioning his confidence. At the end of the 2012–13 season, he went on to make nineteen appearances and scoring five times in all competitions.

On 23 August 2013, Swansea City confirmed that Moore&#x27;s contract had been terminated by mutual consent, ending his three-years at the club. Moore previously stated that he was ready to leave Swansea City after he was left out of their pre-season tour of the Netherlands.

===Elazığspor===
Shortly after leaving Swansea City, Moore joined Turkish club Elazığspor on a free transfer on 24 August 2013, on a three-year contract and moving abroad for the first time in his career. Upon joining the club, he said: &quot;As a team, we aim to perform better than our performance last year. I want to contribute to the team with my personal skills and efforts. I am extremely happy to be in Turkey. I always wanted to play abroad. There gratifying for me in Turkey.&quot;

Moore made his Elazığspor debut, coming on as an 83rd-minute substitute, in a 2–2 draw against Kardemir Karabükspor on 25 August 2013. In January 2014, Moore&#x27;s agent Peter Morrison revealed that he may be able to leave Elazığspor on a free transfer due to a problem regarding financial obligations. By the time he departed from the club, Moore made seventeen appearances and scored no goals for the side. After leaving Elazığspor, he was linked with a return to England, with clubs like Leeds United believed to be interested.

=== MLS ===
On 24 February 2014, it was announced that Moore had agreed to join Chivas USA, for the 2014 MLS season. He made his Chivas USA debut, coming on as 79th-minute substitute, in a 3–2 win against Chicago Fire in the opening game of the season. Moore went on to make six appearances for the side.

Moore was traded to the Colorado Rapids on 8 May for Marvin Chávez who in turn traded Moore to Toronto FC for Gale Agbossoumonde. He scored in his league debut with the team in a win against New York Red Bulls on 17 May after coming on as a sub in the 56th minute for Gilberto Oliveira Souza Júnior. This was followed up with his second goal of the season, in a 2–2 draw against Sporting Kansas City. However, during a 1–1 draw against Chicago Fire on 2 July 2014, he was sent–off in the 29th minute after &quot;a mid-air collision with Fire midfielder Chris Ritter&quot;. Three days later on 5 July 2014, Moore scored his third goal for the club, in a 2–1 loss against D.C. United. A month later, he scored two goals in two matches between 2 August 2014 and 10 August 2014 against Montreal Impact and Columbus Crew. Moore then scored his sixth goal of the season on 21 September 2014, in a 3–0 win against Chivas USA. At the end of the 2014 season, Moore went on to make twenty–nine appearances and scoring six times in all competitions.

At the start of the 2015 season, Moore found himself placed on the substitute bench in a number of matches. However, he served a one match suspension for a serious foul play during a 2–1 loss against Real Salt Lake on 29 March 2015. Moore then set up a goal for Sebastian Giovinco to score the only goal of the game, in a 1–0 win against Portland Timbers on 23 May 2015. Six days later on 29 May 2015, he scored his first goal of the season, as well as, setting up the club&#x27;s second goal of the game, in a 3–1 win against San Jose Earthquakes. Moore set up a goal for Giovinco, who went on to score twice in the match, winning 2–1 against D.C. United on 6 June 2015. However, he found his first team opportunities limited later in the 2015 season, due to being on the substitute bench and faced his own injury concern. On 6 September 2015, Moore returned from injury, starting the whole game, in a 2–1 loss against Seattle Sounders FC. At the end of the 2015 season, he went on to make seventeen appearances and scoring once in all competitions.

He was placed on waivers by Toronto FC on 26 February 2016 after spending two seasons with the club. Following this, Moore retired from professional football before turning 30. He since returned to Birmingham with his young son and became a football agent.

==International career==
Having previously been called up for England U19, Moore was called up to the England U21 for the first time in March 2005. On 7 October 2005, he made his England U21 debut, coming on as a 60th-minute substitute, in a 2–1 loss against Austria U21. Moore went on to make five appearances in total for England U21.

<doc id="1323831" wikidata="Q13616965" url="?curid=1323831" title="Leaverite">
<text>Leaverite is a slang term used by geologists, mineralogists, archaeologists, and amateur rock collectors to identify a specimen in the field that may look interesting or valuable but not worth removing. Rocks identified as such are generally left where they were found, as there is not sufficient reason to attempt to remove them. The term &quot;leaverite&quot; derives from the phrase &quot;&quot;leave &#x27;er right&quot; there&quot;.

There are several kinds of leaverites:
# Man-made features
# Unrocks; objects that may initially appear to be geologic in origin (also referred to as anthropogenicite).
# Large fossils and pseudofossils

Additional forms of leaverites include:
# Specimens that are too large to move or transport
# Legality of the removal of the specimen is questionable or outright illegal
# Collection of the specimen may result in death or dismemberment (e.g. the specimen is hanging on the side of a 300 ft cliff, removal of the specimen would result in a boulder falling on the collector, a rattlesnake is sunning itself on the specimen)

<text>Serge Joyal (born February 1, 1945) is a Canadian politician who served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1974 to 1984 and subsequently in the Senate of Canada from 1997 to 2020.

==Career==
A lawyer by profession, Joyal served as vice-president of the Quebec wing of the Liberal Party of Canada. He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1974 general election and remained a Liberal member of Parliament for ten years.

In 1978, Joyal, along with a group of concerned Montreal citizens that included Nick Auf der Maur and Robert Keaton, co-founded the Municipal Action Group (&quot;MAG&quot;). Joyal was particularly well known at the time for having supported L’Association des gens de l’air, a group which was criticizing the lack of spoken French by airport controllers. Joyal led the newly formed MAG and ran for mayor against the incumbent, Jean Drapeau. MAG succeeded in electing one member to Montreal council (auf der Maur), but Drapeau&#x27;s party won 52 seats. As Joyal had not resigned his federal seat, he returned to Ottawa.

Following the 1980 general election, Joyal served as co-chair of the Joint Committee on the Patriation of the Canadian Constitution. In 1982, he joined the Cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau as a Minister of State. He was appointed Secretary of State for Canada in 1982. When John Turner succeeded Trudeau in June 1984, Joyal remained in cabinet as Secretary of State. Joyal but lost his seat in the 1984 election that defeated the Turner government. On November 26, 1997, Joyal was appointed to the Senate of Canada on the recommendation of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and serves on a number of committees specialising in legal and constitutional affairs.

With the Senate Liberal Caucus facing losing official parliamentary caucus status in 2020 with a third of its caucus facing mandatory retirements on their turning age 75, Senator Joseph Day announced that the Senate Liberal Caucus had been dissolved and a new Progressive Senate Group formed in its wake, with the entire membership joining the new group, including this senator.

Joyal was appointed to the Order of Canada in 1996 and was raised to the rank of Companion of the Order in 2023. He is an Officer of the National Order of Quebec and is also a Chevalier in France&#x27;s Légion d’Honneur. He is an expert art collector and appraiser. In recent years, he has used his knowledge of the art world and his influence on the Senate and the government to get Parliament to assemble a collection of original portraits of the kings of France for the period during which Canada was first explored and colonized by France. In 2004, these paintings were placed on the walls of the Salon de la Francophonie, featured in the Centre Block of the Parliament Buildings, as companions to the portraits of the British and then Canadian monarchs who had been the sovereigns of the territories forming Canada since 1763.

He retired from the Senate reaching the age of 75, after more than 22 years of representing Kennebec on January 31, 2020.

<doc id="1323833" wikidata="Q215109" url="?curid=1323833" title="Karl Rudolf Brommy">
<text>Rear Admiral Karl Rudolf Brommy (changed his name to reflect the English pronunciation of his original name, Bromme) (10 September 1804 – 9 January 1860) was a German naval officer who helped establish the first unified German fleet, the Reichsflotte, during the First Schleswig War which broke out just before the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.

A skilled sea commander, Brommy also made significant contributions to German naval education and shore infrastructure.

==Early life and career==
Born Karl Rudolf &quot;Bromme&quot; in Anger (now part of Leipzig), in the Electorate of Saxony, he was the fifth child of Johann Simon Bromme and his wife, Louise; he was orphaned while still a child. In 1818, the youth received permission from his guardian to become a sailor; he studied at the navigational school in Hamburg and made his first sea voyage on the brig &quot;Heinrich&quot;. Eventually, he served on various United States sailing vessels. During this time, the young man altered the spelling of his name to “Brommy,” to match the English pronunciation.

===Service in South American and Greek revolutions===
In 1820, during a stay on the western coast of South America, Brommy enlisted as a midshipman in the Chilean Navy, at the time when it was led by British nobleman Lord Cochrane, the former Royal Navy officer who had achieved distinction in the Napoleonic Wars. Cochrane undertook the education of young Brommy, so that the youth was soon fit to take on his first command: the 18-gun brigantine &quot;Maypo&quot;. Brommy took part in several actions in Chile&#x27;s War of Independence against the Spanish including the capture of Valdivia. When Brazil became an independent empire in 1822, Cochrane left Chile in order to develop a Brazilian fleet. Brommy followed him, remaining in Brazilian service until 1825.

From 1827 to 1828, Cochrane led the Greek war fleet in the Greek War of Independence against the Turks and Egyptians. Brommy also followed him to Greece, now with the rank of Lieutenant Commander. He was initially first officer of the 64-gun frigate &quot;Hellas&quot; (formerly &quot;Hope&quot;), then second in command of the corvette &quot;Hydra&quot;.

On June 11, 1828, Brommy was advanced to the rank of Commander, and given command of the modern steam corvette &quot;Epicheiresis&quot; (the former &quot;Enterprise&quot;). In the squadron of Greek admiral Andreas Vokos Miaoulis, Brommy took part in the battles in the Gulf of Arta, and participated in the recapture of Missolonghi. In 1829, during the turmoils of the third Greek civil war, Miaoulis and Brommy supported the bourgeois camp. Soon, however, Brommy left Greece and returned to Saxony. In Meissen, he published an autobiographical novel under the pseudonym R. Termo.

In 1832, the Bavarian prince Otto von Wittelsbac became King of Greece. The King was conducted to his new realm by a Greek delegation under Admiral Miaoulis; Brommy attached himself to this delegation, and became an officer in the Greek Navy. He was named commander of various warships, harbor master of Piraeus, and head of the admiralty court. Later he became first commandant of the naval school in Piraeus. In 1845 Brommy requested the Prussian King Frederick William IV for transfer into the Prussian navy, but this request was denied.

==Organizing the first German Navy==
Following the revolutionary events of 1848, the cry became louder in all German states for the creation of a purely German navy (&quot;Deutsche Marine&quot;), which was founded on 4 June 1848 as the &quot;Reichsflotte&quot;. In a letter of July 23, 1848 to Heinrich von Gagern, President of the Frankfurt National Assembly, Brommy offered his help in building up a German fleet. In a reply of November 4, 1848, he was directed by Commerce Minister Duckwitz to come to Frankfurt am Main, where Brommy arrived at the end of the year.

At first, Brommy worked in Maritime Technical Commission of the Assembly&#x27;s naval department (&quot;Marineabteilung&quot;). After the department&#x27;s head, Prince Adalbert of Prussia, was removed from this position by the King of Prussia, Brommy took over the office.

On March 18, 1849, Brommy became Commander-in-Chief of the North Sea Flotilla with his flagship &quot;Barbarossa&quot; in Brake, Lower Saxony. The seaport of Brake became at this time the provisional naval base of the first German fleet. Brommy undertook the military fortification of this base by means of the Hamburg flotilla.

In 1849, in Berlin, Brommy published his “Naval Handbook” (&quot;Lehrbuch der Marine&quot;) – an easy-to-understand manual for educating all levels of seamen.

===The Battle of Heligoland (1849)===
At the beginning of the war against Denmark (the &quot;First Schleswig War&quot;), Brommy (now promoted to post-captain (&quot;Kapitän zur See&quot;) became head of the naval depot in Bremerhaven, that served as arsenal for the growing fleet. Despite material, personal, and financial problems, Brommy succeeded in establishing a small fleet for the war against Denmark. This fleet was initially comprised nine seaworthy steamships, two sailing vessels, and 27 gunboats (&quot;Ruderkanonenboote&quot;). Due to a shortage of native personnel, Brommy was forced to fill the ranks of the higher officers largely with Britons and Belgians.

The only wartime action of the German fleet under Brommy, the Battle of Heligoland (1849) against the Danes ended on June 4, 1849, with the breaking off of battle before the then-British territory of Heligoland, in order to prevent a conflict with Great Britain.

===Promotion to flag rank===
On November 23, 1849, the &quot;Provisional Central Authorities&quot; established by the Frankfurt Parliament appointed Brommy to flag rank, as a Rear Admiral. The appointment was made by Archduke John of Austria (1782–1859), the imperial regent (&quot;Reichsverweser&quot;).

===Disestablishment of the fleet===
In the following days, Brommy was further busied with the development of the fleet, but found himself opposed by the reactionary ruling powers. In 1850, the German Confederation was reestablished. Yet on April 2, 1852, the Federal Diet of the German Confederation in Frankfurt am Main, at the insistence of Prussia, disestablished the first German fleet in Brake. Lorenz Hannibal Fischer was the politician appointed as federal commissioner to oversee the naval disestablishment.

Into this situation Brommy threw himself, to defend colleagues and subordinates who were threatened with dismissal. The ships of the fleet were sold in the same year, most of them at less than their true value. Two modern ships were taken over by Prussia. On March 31, 1853, Brommy signed the dissolution order. So on April 1, with the disestablishment of all naval authorities, and the release of the personnel still in service, thus ended the history of the first German navy.

At this difficult time in his life, Brommy found personal happiness with his marriage to Caroline Gross, the daughter of a merchant and hotel owner of Brake.

Rear Admiral Brommy took his departure on June 30, 1853. From the German Confederation he received a one-time payment of 2,500 &quot;Taler&quot;. A short time later he was given a monthly pension of 125 &quot;Taler&quot; for the duration of his unemployment. His offer of service to the Prussian Navy was turned down.

==Later career and death==
In June 1857 Brommy took a position as technical adviser in the Austro-Hungarian Navy in Venice, but was forced to give up the position after a few months due to poor health. Disappointed, he returned with his wife and son to Germany and settled in St. Magnus near Bremen, where he died on January 9, 1860. Covered with the black-red-gold flag of his flagship &quot;Barbarossa&quot;, Brommy&#x27;s coffin was carried on the steamship &quot;Merkur&quot; to the cemetery of the village Kirchhammelwarden (today a district of Brake) for burial.

==Legacy==
In 1916, the Imperial German Navy built the &quot;Brommy,&quot; a convoy ship [&quot;Räumbootbegleitschiff&quot;], in honor of the admiral.

<text>Narc (stylized as NARC) is a 1988 run and gun arcade video game designed by Eugene Jarvis for Williams Electronics and programmed by George Petro, Todd Allen, and Eugene Jarvis, with art by Jack Haeger, John Newcomer, and Lin Young. It was one of the first ultra-violent video games and a frequent target of parental criticism of the video game industry. The object is to arrest and kill drug offenders, confiscate their money and drugs, and defeat &quot;Mr. Big&quot;. It was the first game in the newly restarted Williams Electronics coin-op video game division. Shortly before its release, Williams acquired the video and pinball divisions of Bally/Midway.

&quot;Narc&quot; was ported to the Commodore 64, Atari ST, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and NES. In 2005, the franchise was re-launched with a new game for the Xbox and PS2, which was released on March 22, 2005. A GameCube version of said game was planned, but was ultimately scrapped.

==Gameplay==
The game&#x27;s main characters are Max Force and Hit Man, who have received a memo from Spencer Williams, Narcotics Opposition chairman in Washington, D.C., dispatching them on Project NARC. Their mission is to apprehend Mr. Big, head of an underground drug trafficking and terrorist organization.

The player controls either Max Force or Hit Man, who shoot or arrest junkies, drug dealers, and organized crime kingpins. Max and Hit are each equipped with an automatic weapon and a missile launcher. When an enemy is dispatched using the latter, they explode in a torrent of scorched and bloody appendages. Some enemies can be arrested after they surrender and then float away with &quot;busted&quot; over them. This is then added to a tally at the end of the level along with drugs and money confiscated from other enemies that they dropped when gunned down (the game awards more points at the end of a round for arresting enemies without killing them).

==Technical details==
The arcade game uses what is termed a &quot;medium resolution monitor&quot;: higher resolution than televisions and normal arcade monitors, but in a smaller physical size.

&quot;Narc&quot; is the first arcade game to use the Texas Instruments TMS34010, a 32-bit processor with graphics-oriented instructions built-in. It was later used in &quot;Smash TV&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, and &quot;NBA Jam&quot;.

==Ports==
The August 1990 Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version of &quot;NARC&quot;, published by Acclaim Entertainment and developed by Rare was billed as &quot;the first video game with a strong anti-drug message,&quot; though Nintendo forced all drug references to be removed from the actual gameplay. The game retained most of its violence and gore.

Most of the computer ports had their music ported by Tony Williams, credited as &quot;Sound Images&quot; and David Wise ported the arcade music to the NES. The Game Boy version of &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; uses some music from &quot;NARC&quot;.

==Reception==

All the versions of the game generally received positive reviews, being praised for its intense action and enjoyable gameplay, but criticism for its repetitiveness, including 9/10 from &quot;CRASH&quot;, 8/10 from &quot;Sinclair User&quot; and 72% from &quot;Your Sinclair&quot;. Matt Bielby of &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; called it &quot;one of the most objectionable Speccy games I&#x27;ve seen in ages&quot;, and called it &quot;repetitive&quot; and the plot &quot;utter nonsense.&quot; However, due to being one of the first games to feature blood, it has been a target of concerns and criticism from parents.

==Legacy==
In 1990, Acclaim released &quot;NARC&quot; as a handheld LCD game.

The main musical theme by Brian L. Schmidt was recorded by the band Pixies and released as a B-side to their &quot;Planet of Sound&quot; single in 1990.

&quot;NARC&quot; was seen briefly in the 1990 film &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; as a group of teenagers were playing the game and fighting Mr. Big.

Max Force and villains Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead and Mr. Big appeared as characters in the cartoon &quot;The Power Team&quot; and in the 2014 film &quot;22 Jump Street&quot;.

&quot;NARC&quot; is included in compilation game, &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 2&quot; (2004).

&quot;NARC&quot; is a song on the soundtrack of Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number, another ultra-violent video game.

===2005 game===
A 2005 sequel was developed by VIS Entertainment and published by Midway for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Microsoft Windows. The Windows version, only released in Europe, was developed by Point of View.

The game casts the players as narcotics officer Jack Forzenski (voiced by Michael Madsen) and DEA agent Marcus Hill (voiced by Bill Bellamy), former partners reunited who are instructed to investigate a new drug on the streets called Liquid Soul. After arresting dealers and confiscating their stock, the player can either take the confiscated items to the evidence room, or keep them for future use. This confers benefits such as improved weapons accuracy. Dealing drugs for financial benefit is also possible.

A March 21, 2005, press release announced the game&#x27;s shipment to retailers and emphasized that &quot;NARC&quot; was designed for an &quot;older audience&quot;. The game was given an M rating.

<text>Irvine is a hamlet in Alberta, Canada within Cypress County. It is located approximately east of Medicine Hat on Highway 1 and has an elevation of . The hamlet is located in census division No. 1 and in the federal riding of Medicine Hat.

== History ==

The vast prairies were home to the Cree and other indigenous groups who traversed the area in and around the nearby Cypress Hills, following the routes of the bison. By 1870, the bison were all but gone. The Palliser Expedition passed through the region in 1859. Métis settled in the hills during the mid-1860s, and the Cypress Hills Massacre occurred in 1873.

A settlement developed around a trading post, and became known as 20 Mile Post - 20 miles from the next trading post at Medicine Hat. It later was renamed Irvine in honour of Colonel A. Irvine, a commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police who served with General F.D. Middleton during the North-West Rebellion of 1885.

In early May 1883, the push was on to complete the Canadian Pacific Railway line from just east of Walsh to Medicine Hat. Crews of gandy dancers worked hard, building the rail line through 20 Mile Post, and reaching Medicine Hat on May 31. Trains brought Europeans with high hopes for their futures to the area. Today, lengthy freight trains roll through Irvine in the blink of an eye.

Many German-Russian settlers homesteaded in the area and some of their descendants remain in and around Irvine to this day. The century-old St. George&#x27;s Parish Cemetery bares evidence of this history.

Prior to September 1, 1905, the community was within the jurisdiction of the Assiniboia District of the Northwest Territories. It then became part of the Province of Alberta.

Irvine was once a thriving community, complete with an elected mayor and town council, several churches, businesses, etc. 
Several grain elevators once thrust their lofty towers to the sky. Blacksmith shops were kept busy making and repairing equipment for local ranchers and farmers. Agriculture is the mainstay of the district&#x27;s economy. When Primere Getty (elected 1985) Changed the number of population required to be a town, Irvine was downgraded to a hamlet, the loss of autonomy, external centralized bylaws/enforcement and taxation discouraged businesses to relocate or to start up in Irvine. Over the decades, however, the demographic has aged and the town businesses closed their doors one by one, and the school was down graded (county decision after the school fire) from K-12 to a K-9 and the grain elevators demolished and rebuilt at the county seat the hamlet has Faltered. There is one surviving church, the old town office building on the main street occupied by a quaint restaurant, the historic Irvine bar, the complex (hockey and curling), Museum and several small businesses.

== Geography ==
An unusual geological formation was discovered northeast of Irvine when Google Earth images showed what has become known as the Badlands Guardian, a shape in the land that looks like a North American Indian wearing a feathered warbonnet.

== Demographics ==
Cypress County indicates that the population of the Hamlet of Irvine was 307 in the 2016 Census, a change of from its 2011 population of 291.

== Arts and culture ==

During the September long weekend, Irvine is home to the 20 Mile Post Days. This annual event includes a pancake breakfast hosted by the Lions Club, a parade, craft show and bench show, a Cowboy Church and a rodeo. It is known as 20 Mile Post Days because it is approximately from Medicine Hat.

== Attractions ==
Irvine is home to the Prairie Memories Museum, where visitors can wander through a &quot;town square&quot; setting to see an early 20th-century church, a one-room school house, a family home, old cabin and lumber store, as well as a small railway memorabilia collection. The museum building, housed in the former immigration hall, has a respectable historical collection.

== Infrastructure ==
Amenities in Irvine include a library, school pre-k to grade 9, a church, small hotel / bar, a hockey arena and curling rinks.

== Education ==
Irvine features a school (kindergarten through grade 9).

<text>Quarky &amp; Quaysoo&#x27;s Turbo Science is an educational computer game developed by Jeff Tunnell Productions and published by Sierra On-Line for MS-DOS in early 1992. It was designed to teach scientific concepts to children.

The game centers on Quarky and Quaysoo O&#x27;Gandi, two space &quot;elfs&quot; that are green and yellow respectively. With the help of the player they race through a town in vehicles ranging from cars to jet packs. To purchase vehicles, the player answers questions relating to science at stops along the way. Each stop has a theme: the construction site is simple machines, Clown College is chemistry, etc. There are three opposing teams: two tough street fighters, a pair of alien siblings, and a know-it-all named Odessa King. The game also featured an information book that ran over one-hundred pages long and taught science topics such as optics (via a run-in with the light police) and energy (with the help of Sheik Oil Slick).

==Reception==
&quot;Quarky &amp; Quaysoo&#x27;s Turbo Science&quot; was reviewed in the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Guide Book where it was described as a set of &quot;fun science problems&quot;. Noting that the problems orient toward &quot;energy, chemistry, magnetism, and air and water pressure&quot;, the authors assessed the game as best suited for children aged 9 years and older.

<doc id="1323869" wikidata="Q6832793" url="?curid=1323869" title="Michael Meighen">
<text>Michael Arthur Meighen (born March 25, 1939) is a Canadian lawyer, cultural patron, and former senator. He practised as a litigation and commercial lawyer in Montreal and Toronto. He is a grandson of Arthur Meighen, the ninth Prime Minister of Canada.

==Family and education==
Meighen is the son of lawyer and philanthropist Theodore Meighen and philanthropist Peggy deLancey Robinson, and the grandson of former Prime Minister of Canada Arthur Meighen. Following his father&#x27;s death, his mother was married to Senator Hartland Molson from 1990 until her death in 2001.

Born in Montreal in 1939, Meighen was educated at Selwyn House School from 1945 to 1953 and Trinity College School from 1953 to 1956. He later earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1960 from McGill University, where he was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi Memorial Chapter and Scarlet Key Honor Society.

==Political career==
Meighen is a longtime friend, advisor and fundraiser for former Progressive Conservative leader and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who appointed Meighen to the Senate in 1990, representing Ontario. Both he and Mulroney were lawyers at the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP. They also attended law school together at Université Laval in Quebec City, along with other prominent Canadian political leaders such as Lucien Bouchard.

In 1972 and again in 1974, he was the Progressive Conservative candidate in the Montreal riding of Westmount, losing on both occasions to Liberal Charles Drury.

He served as national president of the Progressive Conservative Party from 1974 to 1977, during which time he oversaw the 1976 leadership convention that chose Joe Clark to succeed Robert Stanfield as party leader.

More recently, Meighen was the only Conservative senator to vote in favour of same-sex marriage. He was a member of the Banking Trade and Commerce, National Security &amp; Defense and Fisheries committees. Meighen also chaired the Senate Sub-Committee on Veterans Affairs. Meighen was vice-chair of the Senate Committee on National Defence and Security until February 2007, when the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office instructed him and the chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, fellow moderate Tory Hugh Segal, to resign their positions. Reportedly, Prime Minister Stephen Harper wished to promote more ideologically conservative senators. Meighen resigned from the Senate on February 6, 2012, shortly before his 73rd birthday (he would have had to take mandatory retirement on his 75th).

==Legal and other work==
In the mid-1980s, Meighen was legal counsel to the Deschênes Commission on War Criminals. Today, Meighen is counsel to the law firm of Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP, which merged with his former firm Meighen Demers in 2001. He is a member of the McGill University Board of Governors and a director of the Cundill Funds, Sentry Select Capital Corp., and J.C. Clark Ltd. of Toronto. In January 2007, Meighen was appointed by the Canadian Government as a Commissioner of the Roosevelt Campobello International Park.

He and his wife, Kelly Meighen (née Dillon), are benefactors of the Stratford Festival. In 2004, he became Canadian chair of the Atlantic Salmon Federation, which promotes conservation efforts. He is past chair of the Stratford Festival, current chair of the T. R. Meighen Family Foundation and served as chancellor of the University of King&#x27;s College in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

On January 16, 2014, McGill University appointed Meighen as its 19th Chancellor, for a three-year term beginning on July 1, 2014. Also in 2014, he was named a Member of the Order of Canada.

==Personal life==
Meighen and his wife have three sons, Ted, Hugh, and Max. He lives in Toronto.

==Honours==
He was awarded two honorary doctorates, from the University of New Brunswick and from Mount Allison University.

<text>The Nissan Avenir is a line of station wagons beginning production in May 1990 by Nissan of Japan, with the budget oriented delivery van starting out as the Avenir Cargo, then being renamed the Nissan Expert (ja) in 1999. The Avenir replaced the long-serving Nissan Bluebird wagon/delivery van. It was a larger companion to the Nissan Wingroad/Nissan AD van. The 1999 Expert also assumed the load carrying duties of the discontinued Nissan Cedric and Gloria delivery vans. The Avenir appeared after the Subaru Legacy wagon, but before the Toyota Caldina wagon. The Avenir&#x27;s appearance was not shared with another Nissan sedan, although it was sold as the estate version of the Primera in European markets.

The name Avenir is French for &quot;future&quot;, and it was exclusive to &quot;Nissan Store&quot; Japanese dealerships, as it was a replacement for the Bluebird wagon.

== W10 (First generation)==
Introduced to the Japanese market in May 1990 (a small number of units were exported to Nissan New Zealand to replace the locally assembled U11 Bluebird wagon), the W10 Avenir was initially available with either the 1.8 L SR18Di in FWD or a 2.0 L SR20DE engine. The Nissan Expert/Avenir Cargo van light commercials came with either the 1.6 L GA16DS or the naturally aspirated CD20 2-liter diesel engine. 

The FWD was available with either a four-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual. The 4WD models, introduced in October 1990, were only available coupled to the automatic in the Avenir and only with a manual transmission on the Avenir Cargo. There was also the ATTESA configuration. A 2.0 L CD20T turbo-diesel was added to the passenger version range along with a light facelift in January 1993. At the same time, the 1.8-liter SR18Di engine was changed to the improved 1.8 L SR18DE with electronic multi-point injection. In December 1993 a special edition called &quot;Avenir Salut&quot; appeared, French for &quot;hello!&quot;, a name which eventually made its way onto the entire passenger car part of the Avenir range. The original Avenir Salut was a lower cost version of the Attesa-equipped, SR20DE-engined 2.0 Si, forgoing some of that car&#x27;s standard equipment such as the front spoiler and alloy wheels.

High sales of the second generation Subaru Legacy Wagon prompted Nissan to redesign the Avenir&#x27;s rear end in a similar style. This only applied to passenger car versions (the Avenir Cargo retained the original rear design), all of which were now badged Salut. These were introduced in August 1995, along with a turbocharged model called GT turbo; this came with a version of the 2.0-litre SR20DET and was available only in 4WD with the automatic transmission.

== W11 (Second generation)==
The W11 model was introduced early in 1998. Initially available with the 1.8 L QG18DE, 2.0 L SR20DE, 2.0 L SR20DET or the 2.0-litre CD20ET2 turbo-diesel. The QG18DE models were FWD only and available with either a 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission, the SR20DE models were an FWD 4-speed automatic or CVT transmission with 6-speed tiptronic function, the 4WD continued to be conventional 4-speed automatic only. The diesel CD20ET was only available with a 4-speed automatic. Once more the turbocharged 2.0 L SR20DET variants were available only in 4WD coupled with the conventional 4-speed automatic. The power output of the turbo version increased to . This generation of the Avenir was not sold outside of Japan.

From May 2000 the turbocharged Salut was renamed the GT4 along with interior and exterior changes. The output of the SR20DE engine was improved. From the August 2000 facelift, the CVT transmission was fitted to some non-turbo 4WD models.

Autech offered a customized version called the &quot;Rider&quot; trim level.

October 2000 saw the introduction of the Avenir Blastar, with an increased ground clearance and larger wheels, equipped with ATTESA and the SR20DE engine as an alternative to the Subaru Outback. Nissan shared the appearance with the smaller Nissan Wingroad JS.

In August 2002, the SR20DE and the SR20DET engines were replaced with the new QR20DE.

Due to lack of demand for the Avenir, the entire line was cancelled in September 2005; the Expert delivery van lasted until December 2006.

=== Nissan Expert===
After a brief hiatus, the Avenir Cargo delivery van was renamed the Nissan Expert starting in June 1999. The Expert came in three trim levels (L-G, LX-G, VX-G), two- or four-wheel drive, and with two engines: the 1.8-liter QG18DE (NEO), producing , or the 2.2-liter YD22DD diesel engine with . The front-wheel drive diesel could be had with a five-speed manual; all other versions of the Expert received Nissan&#x27;s electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission (E-ATx).

In December 2004, the Expert diesel models were discontinued, leaving only the 1.8-liter petrol engine. This continued to be built until December 2006 in the same three trim levels as originally introduced.

<doc id="1323926" wikidata="Q2862800" url="?curid=1323926" title="Armour Square, Chicago">
<text>Armour Square is a Chicago neighborhood on the city&#x27;s South Side, as well as a larger, officially defined community area, which also includes Chinatown and the CHA Wentworth Gardens housing project. Armour Square is bordered by Bridgeport to the west, Pilsen to the northwest, Douglas and Grand Boulevard to the east and southeast, and with the Near South Side bordering the area to the north, and Fuller Park bordering its southernmost boundary, along Pershing Road.

==Geography==
Armour Square is bounded by 18th Street to the north, Pershing Road to the south, the Union Pacific railroad tracks on the west and the Dan Ryan Expressway to the east.

==Neighborhood demographics==
Armour Square has historically been a predominantly white, working-class neighborhood with a particularly significant population of both Italian-Americans and Croatian-Americans. With its location being immediately south of Chinatown, today the neighborhood also has a large Asian population as well. A 2014 survey found that 46.6% of the neighborhood speaks Chinese at home. The 3406 census tract in the south of Armour Square is 99% black or African American.

==Buildings and structures==
Armour Square&#x27;s most recognizable landmarks are the historic Armour Square Park and nearby Rate Field, which sits at the southeast corner of W.35th and Shields Avenue, on the neighborhood&#x27;s southernmost end. Guaranteed Rate is home to the Major League Baseball franchise, the Chicago White Sox. There are three Catholic parishes in Armour Square: Santa Lucia, St. Therese Catholic Community at 218 W. Alexander St., and St. Jerome Croatian Catholic Church.

Historical images of Armour Square can be found in Explore Chicago Collections, a digital repository made available by Chicago Collections archives, libraries and other cultural institutions in the city.

In September 2022, the Chicago Plan Commission approved a plan to renovate a vacant Armour Square warehouse building into 47 solar-powered apartments.

The Chicago Housing Authority operates a 392-unit residential building for seniors age 62 and up 
in Armour Square on Wentworth Avenue.

== Chicago White Sox ==

In 1900, Charles Comiskey moved his St. Paul Saints to Chicago, where they became the team now known as the Chicago White Sox. They began play at the South Side Park on 39th Street in Armour Square, and have remained in the neighborhood ever since. No other major professional sports franchise has played in the same neighborhood longer than the White Sox. In 1910, Comiskey Park opened just 4 blocks north of South Side Park on a site that was formerly a junkyard. The Park remained the home of the Sox until 1990, when it was the oldest park in Major League Baseball. The new Comiskey Park, currently known as Rate Field, opened in 1991 across 35th Street from the old ballpark. Comiskey Park was then demolished in 1991 and converted into a parking lot. A plaque embedded in the asphalt marks the spot where home plate was on the original field.

== Chinatown ==

Chicago&#x27;s Chinatown is located in the Armour Square community area centered on and around Cermak and Wentworth Avenues, and is an example of an American Chinatown, or ethnic-Chinese neighborhood.

The Chinatown in the Armour Square community area is not to be confused with the West Argyle Street Historic District, sometimes called &quot;New Chinatown&quot;, which is on the North Side of Chicago in and around Argyle Street and hosts Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino, Thai and other Southeast Asian homes and businesses.

== Politics ==
The Armour Square community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, Armour Square cast 2,892 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 761 votes for Donald Trump (76.67% to 20.17%). In the 2012 presidential election, Armour Square cast 2,581 votes for Barack Obama and cast 575 votes for Mitt Romney (81.01% to 18.05%).

== Mass transit stations ==
Armour Square is served by the Dan Ryan branch of the Chicago Transit Authority&#x27;s Red Line, with stops at Cermak-Chinatown and Sox-35th. It is also served by Metra on the Rock Island Line via the 35th Street station.

==Education==
Chicago Public Schools serves residents of the community area; K-8 schools serving Armour Square include Haines and James Ward. Ward Elementary opened as Garibaldi Street Primary School in 1874, and became the Ward School in 1875, before receiving its current name in 1908. Residents are zoned to Phillips Academy High School.

<doc id="1323938" wikidata="Q2569337" url="?curid=1323938" title="Donkey Kong Land III">
<text>Donkey Kong Land III is a 1997 platform game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. A port for the Game Boy Color was released only in Japan in 2000 under the name Donkey Kong GB: Dinky Kong &amp; Dixie Kong. Like its predecessors, &quot;Donkey Kong Land III&quot; served as the portable version of and follow-up to its SNES counterpart, in this case &quot;Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot;, was enhanced for the Super Game Boy, and was packaged with a &quot;banana yellow&quot; cartridge.

The game has since been re-released via the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2014. The game was also later added to Nintendo Switch Online in early December 2024, following the re-releases of its two predecessors from late November.

== Gameplay ==

While the level environments and themes are the same as &quot;Donkey Kong Country 3&quot;, the level designs are all unique.

==Plot==
A contest has begun with big prizes for the first person who discovers the Lost World. Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong have already left to find it, leaving a disgruntled Dixie Kong behind. Deciding to prove herself every bit as capable as them, Dixie partners up with her toddler cousin Kiddy Kong. Baron K. Roolenstein and the Kremling Krew are also searching high and low for the fabled land.

==Development==
&quot;Donkey Kong Land 3&quot; was coded by Ian Manders. Manders started at Rare in 1994 with his first project being &quot;Ken Griffey Jr.&#x27;s Winning Run&quot;. The game used the same engine that Robert Harrison wrote from the ground up for &quot;Donkey Kong Land 2&quot;. Manders said that programming the game was a challenge as he was new to the tighter constraints for which the CPU of the Game Boy allowed.

The game deviates more from its console counterpart &quot;Donkey Kong Country 3&quot;, if not more than the first game which had new enemies in addition to new scenery and level design. Harrison stated that this was because most of the attention was being made for games for the Nintendo 64 at Rare and that using an existing game engine allowed for more original elements to be made for the game.

On 28 January 2000, less than three years after the game&#x27;s North American and European releases, Nintendo released an updated Game Boy Color version of the game in Japan. Titled &quot;Donkey Kong GB: Dinky Kong &amp; Dixie Kong&quot;, it was not released outside of Japan. This version is the same as the Game Boy version, but lacks some animations and dialogues. This version was also released on the 3DS Virtual Console in Japan in 2014, and again on the Japanese Nintendo Switch Online service in December 2024.

==Reception==
&quot;Donkey Kong Land III&quot; received a score of 81.25% at GameRankings based on four reviews. Nintendojo praised the game and awarded it 8.5 out of 10, citing the &quot;brilliantly designed&quot; levels and &quot;impressive&quot; visuals. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; gave the Virtual Console re-release 9 out of 10.

<doc id="1323944" wikidata="Q3326020" url="?curid=1323944" title="Mount Greenwood, Chicago">
<text>Mount Greenwood is one of the 77 community areas in Chicago. The 74th numbered area, it is about southwest of the Loop. It is surrounded by the neighborhoods of Beverly and Morgan Park to the east, the suburb of Evergreen Park to the north, the suburb of Oak Lawn to the west, and the suburbs of Merrionette Park and Alsip to the south. Mount Greenwood is known as the home of many Chicago firefighters, Chicago police officers, and union workers.

==History==
In the mid-nineteenth century, German and Dutch farmers settled the area. The region received its name in 1879 when the surveyor George Washington Waite platted an eighty-acre land grant that he had received from the federal government.
The proliferation of saloons led to a movement to turn Mount Greenwood into a &quot;dry area&quot; like the nearby communities of Morgan Park and Beverly. To prevent this, a group of citizens successfully campaign to incorporate Mount Greenwood as a village. Twenty years later, in 1927, the community voted to be annexed into Chicago to receive better services. The promised infrastructure took longer than anticipated to be delivered due to the Great Depression. Those services finally came nine years later, in 1936, when the Works Progress Administration installed sewers. Residents were still seeking improvements such as curbs into the 1960s. Despite being annexed by Chicago, the area maintained a character similar to nearby blue collar city-suburbs.

Mount Greenwood was home to the last farm in Chicago, owned by Peter Ouwenga until the mid-1980s when he sold his farm to the Chicago Public School system. The district built the Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences on Peter Ouwenga&#x27;s land, an experimental magnet high school devoted to teaching agricultural science to urban students. It was the second school of its kind after W.B. Saul High School in Philadelphia.

===Racial tension===
Mount Greenwood&#x27;s history has been characterized by racial tension. In the 1970s, a Mount Greenwood civic group, joined two other community groups to file a complaint with the Department of Justice over racial quotas at the Robert Black Mini-Magnet school that allegedly favored minorities. In 1992, &quot;The New York Times&quot; interviewed over one hundred residents of Mount Greenwood and Roseland in which Mount Greenwood residents seemingly endorsed the &quot;de facto&quot; segregation and expressed their beliefs in welfare queens and other stereotypes. Around the same time as the &quot;New York Times&quot; piece, residents successfully managed to restrict the number of minority students who could attend Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences which at the time had a predominantly black student body. In the late 1990s, an African-American family alleged that they were driven out of the neighborhood by persistent vandalism and harassment. In 2016, the area was the site of a clash between the Blue Lives Matter and Black Lives Matter movements after the latter came to Mount Greenwood to protest after the shooting of 25-year-old Joshua Beal by an off duty fire fighter.

==Geography==
Its approximate borders are 103rd Street to the north, 117th Street to the south, Pulaski Road to the west, and Sacramento Avenue to the east. Mount Greenwood is a rarity amongst Chicago community areas as residents, the city and academics largely agree on its boundaries. The area has three neighborhoods; Mount Greenwood, Mount Greenwood Heights and Talley&#x27;s Corner.

Land use in Mount Greenwood consists mostly of single family residential housing of which there is 748 acres, most of which was built between 1940 and 1970. The presence of the Chicago High School for Agricultural Science and St. Xavier University contribute to the 523 acres of institutional land use. Additionally, there is 365 acres of transportation use, 37 acres of commercial use, 30 acres of open space, 19 acres of multifamily residential housing and 8 acres of mixed use buildings.

Mount Greenwood is home to a large number of cemeteries and, for a time, was nicknamed the Seven Holy Tombs. Although completely surrounded by the City of Chicago, Mount Greenwood Cemetery is in unincorporated Cook County.

==Demographics==
The Mount Greenwood area has a reputation as a historical bastion of the South Side Irish. Mount Greenwood has the fourth highest percent of self-reported Irish Americans in the United States, at 46%. The area has historically been predominantly white and Mount Greenwood was the destination for many Chicagoans during the white flight of the latter half of the twentieth century. As recently as 1998, an African-American family moving into Mount Greenwood was a newsworthy item.

According to a 2016 analysis by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, there were 18,357 people and 6,416 households in Mount Greenwood. The racial makeup of the area was 86.5% White, 4.5% African American, 2.2% Asian, 1.1% from other races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.7% of the population. In the area, the population was spread out, with 29.5% under the age of 19, 18.2% from 20 to 34, 22.5% from 35 to 49, 18.8% from 50 to 64, and 11% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years.

The median household income was $89,728 compared to a median income of $47,831 for Chicago at-large. The area had an Income distribution in which 10.8% of households earned less than $25,000 annually; 13.5% of households earned between $25,000 and $49,999; 16.1% of households earned between $50,000 and $74,999; 16.3% of households earned between $75,000 and $99,999; 27.8% of households earned between $100,000 and $149,999 and 15.5% of households earned more than $150,000. This is compared to a distribution of 28.8%, 22.8%, 16.1%, 10.7%, 11.3% and 10.3% for Chicago at large. Mount Greenwood&#x27;s status as one of the wealthier Chicago community areas is further reflected in a home ownership rate of 87.5% compared to 44.7% rate for Chicago-at-large.

Over 95% of Mount Greenwood residents have graduated from high school and over one third of residents have graduated from college.

==Economy==
The top 5 employing industry sectors of Mount Greenwood residents are public administration (21.8%), education (16.0%), health care (11.3%), retail trade (6.9%) and accommodation and food service (6.2%). A plurality of the workforce works in the surrounding suburbs with the remainder working in the central business district. A small number of Mount Greenwood residents work in Mount Greenwood. A significant portion of residents are City of Chicago employees.

Over two thirds of these workers reside outside of Chicago and one fifth reside in Mount Greenwood and the surrounding neighborhoods. The area&#x27;s main commercial corridor is along 111th Street. The corridor has seen an increase in the construction of new shopping centers since the creation of a TIF district in 2009.

==Transportation==
The nearest Metra stations to Mount Greenwood are on the Rock Island District line and include the 103rd Street and 107th Street stations in Beverly and the 111th Street and 115th Street stations in Morgan Park. Nearly 90% of commuters drive to work.

==Schools and libraries==
In 1956, Saint Xavier University moved to Mount Greenwood from the Douglas area. By the 1980s, Mount Greenwood was home two of the last surviving farms in the city, one of which was developed as the Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences at the southeast corner of 111th and Pulaski. Mount Greenwood is home to one Catholic elementary school, three Catholic high schools (Brother Rice High School, Marist High School, and Mother McAuley Liberal Arts High School). Public grade schools in the area are Mt. Greenwood Elementary School, George F. Cassell Elementary School, and Annie Keller Regional Gifted Center. The neighborhood is zoned to Morgan Park High School. Mount Greenwood, like many other Chicago neighborhoods, has its own branch of the Chicago Public Library. The library in this area looks identical to the Hegewisch Branch of the Chicago Public Library. The library has a significant Irish heritage collection.

==Parks==
Mount Greenwood has 2.8 acres of park land per 1,000 residents. The booming Mount Greenwood community was among the neighborhoods identified for park development in the Chicago Park District&#x27;s Ten Year Plan to provide increased recreational opportunities in post-World War II Chicago. In 1946, the Mount Greenwood Civic Council urged the acquisition of vacant Board of Education land along 111th Street. The park district purchased the site in 1949, and slowly began improving the property. The park district constructed a fieldhouse in 1966, and added a swimming pool in 1973. The 1990s brought further improvements. A soft surface playground featured an airport/train station-themed play area. A refrigerated ice skating rink provides winter recreation.

Several features of Mount Greenwood Park honor noted local citizens. A parking area is dedicated to Frederick G. Abrams Sr. a Chicago Alderman and Treasurer of the Village of Mount Greenwood from 1918 to 1927. A baseball diamond bears the name Rooney Field, in honor of Rooney Richardson (--1982), who took an active role in community affairs.

==Politics==
In the 2016 presidential election, Mount Greenwood was the only community area in the city of Chicago won by Donald Trump. The area cast 5,445 votes for Trump and cast 3,320 votes for Hillary Clinton. Mount Greenwood had also gone for the Republican candidate in 2012 with 4,908 votes cast for Mitt Romney and 3,983 votes cast for Barack Obama.

<doc id="1323952" wikidata="Q561383" url="?curid=1323952" title="Brian Hibbard">
<text>Brian Hibbard (26 November 1946 – 17 June 2012) was a Welsh actor and singer from Ebbw Vale, Wales, best remembered as the lead vocalist in the original The Flying Pickets.

==Early life and career==
Hibbard was born into a working class family in Ebbw Vale, Monmouthshire, and had a socialist upbringing. He was educated at Ebbw Vale Grammar School. After various jobs including teacher, steel worker, barman and chimney sweep, he formed The Flying Pickets with a group of other actors who had practiced a cappella singing while travelling by coach to their appearances. Their cover version of Yazoo&#x27;s track &quot;Only You&quot; was the Christmas number one in 1983 on the UK Singles Chart.

Following the group&#x27;s success, Hibbard pursued a career as a television actor, making a guest appearance in the 1987 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Delta and the Bannermen&quot;. His first regular TV role came in 1989, playing petty criminal &quot;Chunky&quot; in three series of Manchester-based comedy drama &quot;Making Out&quot; (1989-1991), followed by a two-year stint in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as garage mechanic Doug Murray. Other soap appearances included brief stints in &quot;Emmerdale&quot; as Bobby-John Downes, and as Henry Mason, a man who ran a children&#x27;s home where Billy Mitchell and Julie Perkins were in care, in &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

Other appearances include &quot;Minder&quot;, &quot;The Armando Iannucci Shows&quot;, &quot;Satellite City&quot;, Welsh language soap &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot; as well as the youth drama &quot;Pam Fi, Duw?&quot; and in the 1997 film &quot;Twin Town&quot; as the self-styled &quot;Karaoke King&quot; Dai Rees.

==Personal life and death==
Hibbard and his wife Caroline had three children.

In 2000, Hibbard was diagnosed with prostate cancer; he died of the disease on 17 June 2012 at the age of 65.

<text>The Eighth Wonder is a 1995 opera by Alan John and with a libretto by Dennis Watkins about the building process of the Sydney Opera House.

==Production history==
&quot;The Eighth Wonder&quot; was premiered by The Australian Opera at the Sydney Opera House on 14 October 1995 in the presence of the composer and librettist. The opera was broadcast on television by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on the Friday evening following the world premiere performance.

It was revived by the same company (by this time known as Opera Australia) again at the Sydney Opera House in 2000.

A new adaptation, performed as part of Opera Australia&#x27;s 2016 season, was retitled &quot;Sydney Opera House: The Opera&quot;. It was performed outdoors on the steps of the Opera House, with the audience wearing headphones to hear the singers and orchestra with clarity.

In 2020, spurred by composer Stephen Rae&#x27;s desire to listen to the opera and finding it unavailable, a project commenced to promote the opera through a comprehensive website dedicated to the opera. The website was launched in March 2021 and resulted in a cover story feature in the April 2021 edition of &quot;Limelight&quot; magazine.

==Plot==
The opera tells the story of the very building in which it was performed. Soon after the building was commissioned and work had commenced the State Premier who administered its genesis died.

The opera suggests that the Premier believed that if the work was not sufficiently advanced and there was a change of government then the project would be cancelled. Therefore, the foundation work was commenced before the architect had solved the problem of how to build the main structure of the building. The time and cost estimates were also understated to ensure work commenced. There were many other engineering and design problems that had not been solved when work had commenced.

The opera supports the idea that the architect was fully competent to solve these problems and indeed was able to provide solutions that were far more elegant than anything that anyone less inspired, less talented and at one with a vision could provide.

Some time after that there was indeed a change of government. There was much hostility toward the building and the new government was not willing to let the architect complete the project. Much scandal was made of the time and cost of the project. The state bureaucracy wrested control from its architect and the architect&#x27;s intentions for the interiors of the building were never realised. The architect left the country and disowned the building.

Characters in the opera include the politicians, the architect, an engineer, socialites, and a prominent conductor (the maestro) who betrays the cause of opera for the cause of concert music (see full cast list below). There are also two young artists who firmly identify their future with the building. The names of the characters do not match their real-life counterparts and there are, no doubt, certain other fictional elements.

There is a large chorus and the music is quite accessible, with several bright choral climaxes. The opera consists of two acts, with a total of 15 scenes including Parliament House, the construction site and the suburban backyard where the young artists spend time with their families.

The opera concludes leaving the audience with a sense of loss for the complete vision that was never realised but also with an enormous sense of gratitude and wonderment that as much of that vision that has been completed has been.

<doc id="1323961" wikidata="Q2090692" url="?curid=1323961" title="Krzywda coat of arms">
<text>Krzywda is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families. The homeland of this coat of arms is probably the village Krzywda in Podlaskie.

==History==
There are two legends of how this coat of arms appeared:

The first says one of two (or three) brothers of the Lubicz clan did wrong (krzywda) to the other with respect to his portion of their inheritance, and as a result half of one cross was taken from his coat of arms and the new coat of arms was called Krzywda (which translates from Polish as &quot;injustice&quot;, &quot;grief&quot;). Polish: &quot;Gdy jeden Lubicz przy majątkowym działe brata skrzywdził, utracił za to jedno ramie górniego krzyża.&quot;

The other version says the missing arm was based on a rule that &quot;The first man to touch a certain piece of land, could claim it&quot;. Someone named Bogucki was in a boat looking for the land, and there were many other boats around him. When he feared others might get to the land first, he cut off his arm, threw it to the land, and claimed it as his.

==Blazon==
In Polish blazon sounds like: &quot;W polu błękitnym podkowa srebrna ocelami w dół zwrócona. W środku niej krzyż kawalerski złoty. Na niej umieszczony krzyż kawalerski złoty bez prawego ramienia. W klejnocie nad hełmem w koronie trzy pióra strusie.&quot;
In English: Azure, within a silver horseshoe ensiegned with a cross pattée sans its right arm, a cross patee both crosses Or. Crest: three ostrich plumes Argent.
In other words, on a blue field there is a silver horseshoe (pointed down) with a gold knight&#x27;s cross inside it, and another knight&#x27;s cross missing its right arm on top of it.

==Notable bearers==
Notable bearers of this coat of arms include:

* Stanisław Moniuszko
*Alexandre-Édouard Kierzkowski
* House of Krasnodębski
* Janusz Feliks Ratyński
* Zygmunt Stanisław Ratyński
* Levko Revutsky
* House of Rzewuski
** Wacław Rzewuski
** Ewelina Rzewuska
** Teresa Karolina Rzewuska
** Maria Ludwika Rzewuska
** Seweryn Rzewuski
** Stanisław Mateusz Rzewuski

Some people of this armorial clan received some titles from other counties. For example:
* Jósef Felix Łasowski – the title of Baron of the French Empire (15 August 1809)
* Kazimierz Rzewuski – the title of Count of Austria (21 April 1819)
* Alexander Soszyński – the title of dvoryanin of Russia (1860)
* and various other members of the latter family received countly titles from Austria and Russia.

<doc id="1323965" wikidata="Q3058776" url="?curid=1323965" title="East of Suez">
<text>East of Suez is a term used in British military and political discussions in reference to interests east of the Suez Canal, and may or may not include the Middle East. The phrase was popularised by Rudyard Kipling in his 1890 poem &quot;Mandalay&quot;. It later became a popular song when a tune was added by Oley Speaks in 1907.
&lt;poem&gt;
:&quot;Ship me somewheres east of Suez, where the best is like the worst,
:Where there aren&#x27;t no Ten Commandments an&#x27; a man can raise a thirst;&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

== 19th century ==

The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 provided the shortest ocean link from Britain to the Far East by making the long journey around the Cape of Good Hope unnecessary. With the 1882 invasion and occupation of Egypt, the United Kingdom took de facto control of the country as well as joint control along with the French of the Suez Canal – which had been described as the “jugular vein of the Empire”. 

The canal and the imperial outposts east of the canal were of genuine strategic value to the British Empire and its military infrastructure drew on sea lanes of communication through the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal, alternatively round the Cape of Good Hope to India, and on to East Asia (Brunei, Burma, Malaya, Hong Kong, North Borneo, Singapore, Sarawak) and Australia.

== 20th century ==
=== Fall of Singapore ===
The capture of Singapore by the Japanese on 15 February 1942, which was preceded by the sinking of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot;, severely damaged the Empire as it lost a strategic imperial outpost and presaged the end of British imperial power post–World War II. Then, with the Partition of India later in 1947, there was a gradual decrease of the military presence &quot;East of Suez&quot;, marking the end of the Empire. 

=== Suez Crisis ===
The Suez Crisis—a diplomatic and military confrontation in November 1956, caused by the nationalization of the Suez Canal by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser—ended in Egypt taking complete control of the canal. Both the United States and the USSR threatened the British to relent, exposing the now marginalized economic and military influence of the UK and its loss of superpower status, limiting its access to its bases in the Middle East and Asia.

=== Devaluation of the pound ===
In January 1968, a few weeks after the devaluation of the pound, the Labour Party Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his Defence Secretary, Denis Healey, announced that British troops would be withdrawn in 1971 from major military bases in South East Asia, &quot;east of Aden&quot;, primarily in Malaysia and Singapore as well as the Persian Gulf and the Maldives (both of which are sited in the Indian Ocean), which is when the phrase &quot;East of Suez&quot; became part of the vernacular. In June 1970, Edward Heath&#x27;s Conservative government came to power and retained a small political and military commitment to South East Asia through the Five Power Defence Arrangements. Prior to the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China, Britain based several units in Hong Kong.

== 21st century ==

In April 2013, the British research institute the Royal United Services Institute published a report which stated that the UK is in the process of a strategic shift back to an east of Suez policy. The report stated that a permanent military presence was being established at Al-Minhad in the United Arab Emirates, by the Royal Air Force, as well as the continuing buildup of British troops in the Persian Gulf states as Britain begins to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. Furthermore, the report argued that as Britain begins to relocate its troops from Germany by 2020, the British base in the UAE could become their permanent home.

The think tank also explained that as the United States begins to concentrate more on the Asia-Pacific region in its attempt to balance China&#x27;s rise as a world power, a strategic vacuum would emerge in the Persian Gulf region which was being filled incrementally by Britain. This shift of troops to the UAE coincided with establishment of the Royal Navy&#x27;s UK Maritime Component Command (UKMCC) in Bahrain. In December, the UK&#x27;s Chief of Defence Staff Gen Sir David Richards said: &quot;After Afghanistan, the [Persian] Gulf will become our main military effort&quot;. Overall this would signal a reversal of Britain&#x27;s East of Suez withdrawal.

In 2014, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office announced that the UK would expand its naval facilities in Bahrain to accept larger Royal Navy ships deployed to the Persian Gulf. HMS &quot;Jufair&quot; is the UK&#x27;s first permanent military base located East of Suez since it withdrew from the region in 1971. The base will reportedly be large enough to accommodate Type 45 destroyers and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class aircraft carriers. The Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 stated new British Defence Staffs will be established in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Africa in 2016. In 2017, the UK Joint Logistics Support Base was established in Oman, followed by a new Omani-British Joint Training Area in 2019.

Britain maintains a Jungle Warfare Training School in Brunei, and a battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles in addition to some aircraft of the Army Air Corps as part of the British Military Garrison Brunei. There is also a small British military presence remaining on Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territory, and a refuelling station (manned by Royal Navy personnel) in Sembawang, Singapore, as part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements.

<doc id="1323972" wikidata="Q714440" url="?curid=1323972" title="Richard C. Tolman">
<text>Richard Chace Tolman (March 4, 1881 – September 5, 1948) was an American mathematical physicist and physical chemist who made many contributions to statistical mechanics and theoretical cosmology. He was a professor at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

== Early life and education ==
Tolman was born in West Newton, Massachusetts to a successful businessman and a Quaker mother. Tolman attended the local public schools before matriculating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering 1903. He spent the following year studying abroad in Germany before returning to MIT for further studies. He was mentored by Arthur Amos Noyes, a pioneer of physical chemistry, and received PhD in 1910 under Noyes&#x27; supervision. He subsequently worked briefly at various universities before the outbreak of World War I.

== Scientific career ==
In 1912, he conceived of the concept of relativistic mass, writing that &quot;the expression formula_1 is best suited for the mass of a moving body.&quot;

During the First World War, Tolman served in the Chemical Warfare Service, attaining the rank of Major. When the war ended, he continued working for the government for some years, researching nitrogen fixation.

In a 1916 experiment with Thomas Dale Stewart, Tolman demonstrated that electricity consists of electrons flowing through a metallic conductor. A by-product of this experiment was a measured value of the mass of the electron. This early work sparked Tolman&#x27;s interest in chemical kinetics and statistical mechanics. Tolman and his collaborators at the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory at the University of California thanked the government for enabling them to conduct fundamental research that had little immediate relevance to their assigned project, writing that &quot;such a liberal policy is of great importance in maintaining a proper scientific attitude on the part of the staff of a research laboratory.&quot;

Tolman was a member of the Technical Alliance in 1919, a forerunner of the Technocracy movement where he helped conduct an energy survey analyzing the possibility of applying science to social and industrial affairs.

Tolman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1922. The same year, he joined the faculty of the California Institute of Technology, where he became professor of physical chemistry and mathematical physics and later Dean of Graduate Studies. One of Tolman&#x27;s early students at Caltech was the theoretical chemist Linus Pauling, to whom Tolman taught the old quantum theory. Tolman was elected to the National Academy of Sciences of the United States in 1923. His years at Caltech were his most productive.

In 1927, Tolman published a text on statistical mechanics whose background was the old quantum theory of Max Planck, Niels Bohr and Arnold Sommerfeld. Tolman was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1932. In 1938, he published a new detailed work that covered the application of statistical mechanics to classical and quantum systems. In his work on the subject, Tolman built heavily upon the key contributions of Ludwig Boltzmann, J. Willard Gibbs, Paul and Tatyana Ehrenfest.

Tolman took an interest in general relativity. He researched the application of thermodynamics to relativistic systems and cosmology. He established a number of theoretical results important in the study of an expanding universe. In his 1934 monograph titled &quot;Relativity, Thermodynamics, and Cosmology,&quot; Tolman demonstrated how black body radiation in an expanding universe cools but remains thermala key pointer toward the properties of the cosmic microwave background. Also in this monograph, Tolman was the first person to document and explain how a closed universe could equal zero energy. He explained how all mass energy is positive and all gravitational energy is negative and they cancel each other out, leading to a universe of zero energy. His investigation of the oscillatory universe hypothesis, which Alexander Friedmann had proposed in 1922, drew attention to difficulties as regards entropy and resulted in its demise until the late 1960s. Tolman interpreted astronomical observations in terms of the new cosmology in collaboration with Edwin Hubble.

During the 1930s, Tolman obtained solutions to the Einstein field equations describing the static spherically symmetric perfect fluid. J. Robert Oppenheimer, Robert Serber, and George Volkoff, built upon this work in their investigation the stability of neutron stars, obtaining the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.

During World War II, Tolman served as scientific advisor to General Leslie Groves on the Manhattan Project. At the time of his death in Pasadena, he was chief advisor to Bernard Baruch, the U.S. representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.

He resumed civilian life in 1947 and published some papers on the thermodynamics of surface phases. He died on September 5, 1948, three weeks after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage without warning.

Each year, the southern California section of the American Chemical Society honors Tolman by awarding its Tolman Medal &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to chemistry.&quot;

== Family ==

Tolman&#x27;s brother was the behavioral psychologist Edward Chace Tolman. He married psychologist Ruth Sherman Tolman in 1924.

<text>Iosepa ( or , with the &quot;I&quot; like an English &quot;Y&quot;) is a ghost town in the Skull Valley, located approximately southwest of Salt Lake City in Tooele County, Utah, United States. Once home to over 200 Polynesian members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Iosepa was inhabited during the period 1889–1917. Today, it is the site of an annual Memorial Day gathering that draws islanders and others from all over the Western United States.

==History==

===Foundation===
Mormon missionaries were sent to Polynesia starting in the 1850s. Many of their converts wanted to emigrate or &quot;gather&quot; to Utah with the main body of the Church, but were restricted by law, particularly in Hawaii. In the 1870s the Hawaiian government began to allow emigration, and by 1889 some 75 Native Hawaiians had gathered in the northern Salt Lake City neighborhood near Warm Springs Park. Despite their common faith, the immigrants experienced significant culture shock, as well as mistreatment by the white majority. The Polynesians were barred from staying in white-owned hotels and were refused service at restaurants in Salt Lake City. Church leaders began searching for a location to set aside as a Hawaiian enclave, but four decades of settlement had occupied most of the desirable land in the Salt Lake area.

In 1889, a group of three Hawaiian converts and three returned missionaries was assigned to choose a location. After considering possibilities in Cache, Weber, and Utah counties, they selected a site in Skull Valley, known as the Quincy Ranch or the Rich Ranch, as a gathering place for the South Sea Islanders. The colony was organized as a joint stock company, the Iosepa Agriculture and Stock Company, owned by the LDS Church. The first 46 settlers arrived at the new townsite on August 28, 1889 and drew lots for land. August 28 was later designated as Hawaiian Pioneer Day.

The name &quot;Iosepa&quot;, a Hawaiian form of &quot;Joseph&quot;, was chosen in honor of Joseph F. Smith (1838–1918), one of the first missionaries from the Church to serve the Hawaiian people, and also in honor of his uncle, Joseph Smith (1805–1844), founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. The Iosepans&#x27; main reason for coming to Utah was to be near the Salt Lake Temple. After it opened in 1893, they traveled there as frequently as possible to participate in religious ceremonies.

===Development and growth===
Iosepa was an inhospitable location for any group of people. Most of the colonists were from Hawaii, though others were from different parts of Polynesia, and Skull Valley is desert, quite unlike the islands they had left. The Iosepans worked hard to improve their new home and eke out a living. The company purchased a sawmill and built homes, a church, school, and store. They also developed an extensive irrigation system to bring water from the Stansbury Mountains, allowing fields, lawns, and flowerbeds to be watered in the middle of the desert. The people planted crops, raised pigs, and even constructed ponds for raising carp and trout. They did their best to adapt or replace traditional foodstuffs not native to Utah, substituting on a mixture of flour and cornstarch for poi and experimenting with growing their own seaweed and other island products. Cattle and sheep were raised under the church-managed Iosepa Agricultural and Stock Company. They also built a small reservoir, called Kanaka Lake, where they could swim and have lakeside picnics. In 1899, residents of other parts of the state converged on Iosepa for an Arbor Day celebration in which they planted 300 walnut trees, 300 fruit trees, and 100 ornamental trees. The town became known for its neat streets lined with yellow roses, and in 1911 even won the state prize for the &quot;best kept and most progressive city in the state of Utah.&quot;

===Challenges===
The settlement was well-planned, but is considered an unsuccessful attempt at colonization. Iosepa never managed to become self-sufficient; Latter-day Saint leaders had to allocate church funds to pay the town&#x27;s expenses. The harsh environment was hard on Iosepans&#x27; health. Infectious disease took a heavy toll, including deaths from pneumonia, smallpox, and diphtheria. In 1896 there were even three cases of leprosy, and a pest house was built outside of town to isolate the lepers. Sensationalized newspaper reports of the outbreak alienated Iosepa even further from mainstream Utah society. Times became harder after several crop failures, and many of the men sought work as miners in the nearby gold and silver mines. Iosepa continued to grow despite all these challenges. The population increased from around 80 in 1901 to 228 at its peak in 1915. Most residents were Hawaiians, but there were also Samoans, Māori, Portuguese, Scots, and English.

===Desertion===
In 1915, Joseph F. Smith, then President of the LDS Church, announced plans for the construction of a temple at Lā&#x27;ie, Hawai&#x27;i. The first such temple to be built outside of continental North America, the Laie Hawaii Temple brought Iosepa to an end. Although Mormon leaders did not advise the Iosepans to emigrate to Hawaii, the Church did offer to pay the passage of any who wished to move but could not afford it. Most of Iosepa&#x27;s residents chose to return to Hawaii. By January 1917 Iosepa was a ghost town, and the land was sold to the Deseret Livestock Company. Little remains of the original town other than the cemetery and a fire hydrant.

==Legacy==
In 1971, the Iosepa cemetery was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. For many years Iosepa has been known for the rows of evenly spaced fire hydrants poking out through the sagebrush. As of 2004, all that remains are a few building foundations and the markers in the town&#x27;s graveyard, which is surrounded by a chain-link fence. An historical marker gives a brief history of the settlement, which can easily be reached by automobile.

In 1980, a Memorial Day activity was organized at Iosepa, where a few Utah Polynesian families, some descended from Iosepans, repaired the fence and beautified the graveyard area. This marked the beginning of an annual tradition that continues to grow. In the mid-1980s, the Iosepa Historical Association was incorporated to foster appreciation of Utah&#x27;s Polynesian heritage and history. The association works to preserve the townsite and organize the festival. On August 28, 1989, Iosepa&#x27;s centennial, President Gordon B. Hinckley of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints dedicated a monument at the cemetery, featuring a bronze bust of a Polynesian warrior. That year the Memorial Day celebration was transformed from a one-day work activity to an elaborate three-day weekend luau. Every Memorial Day weekend hundreds of Polynesians and those interested in Polynesian history—about 1000 people in 2007—gather at the site for the celebration. Restrooms and a large concrete pavilion were added for the 1999 festival, and the association has plans for further improvements to welcome the growing crowds. Camping is encouraged, and visitors are always welcome.

<doc id="1323974" wikidata="Q3560435" url="?curid=1323974" title="Miss Violetta Beauregarde">
<text>Miss Violetta Beauregarde was the solo electronic-punk project by Italian performer/former model Cristina Gauri.

==Music==
Violetta Beauregarde started by performing several concerts in Italy and Europe, and her first CD, &quot;Evidentemente non abito a San Francisco&quot; (&quot;Apparently I don&#x27;t live in San Francisco&quot;), gained notable interest from the Italian music press. Her second record, Odi Profanum Vulgus et Arceo, has been released by Temporary Residence Limited as of September 2006. The record had some positive international recognition, and Beck notably ranked it second among his favourite records of 2006.

Violetta Beauregarde&#x27;s music has been likened to that of Kid 606 or Atari Teenage Riot. It is composed with eclectic and often do-it-yourself music instrumentation, over which she screams her lyrics. Her live shows are notable for a degree of attitude and for shock acts such as throwing lamb heads in the crowd.

==Other activities==
Gauri became first famous in the Italian musical scene also for having been the first Italian model for SuicideGirls under the nickname of Aiki.

She also ran an Italian blog, which was fairly known for the unique writing style and the strongly cynical, straightforward, outrageous opinions and language. Under the moniker &quot;Heidi 666&quot; she published a book, &quot;L&#x27;eterna lotta tra il Male e il Malissimo&quot; (&quot;The eternal struggle between the Evil and the Really Evil&quot;)

Gauri also appeared in the Italian pornographic film &quot;Mucchio Selvaggio&quot; (directed by Matteo Swaitz) performing fellatio at minute 81.

In 2019 she started to work as a journalist (registered) for the extreme right-wing Italian news website Primato Nazionale, linked to the neo-fascist organization Casa Pound.

<text>American University Park is a neighborhood of Washington, D.C., named for American University. AU Park, as it is often abbreviated, is situated against the Maryland border in the Northwest quadrant, bounded by Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Nebraska, and Western Avenues. Tenleytown and Friendship Heights lie to the east, Embassy Row to the southeast, and Spring Valley to the southwest. Politically, it is part of Ward 3 and Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3E.

This neighborhood includes some of the highest elevations in the city and is close to the District&#x27;s highest point in neighboring Tenleytown at (the city&#x27;s lowest point is sea level, on the banks of the Potomac River).

Developed in the 1920s by the W.C. and A.N. Miller, which also developed Spring Valley and Wesley Heights, the neighborhood consists almost entirely of single-family homes. A wide variety of architectural styles are present, and most homes have been modified or expanded since the 1930s. Although one of Washington&#x27;s first tracts developed with the automobile in mind, the approximately 2,700 homes are closely spaced, feature porches or stoops, and often lack driveways, which boosters say contributes to community spirit.

W.C. and A.N. Miller established restrictive covenants on the development to prevent Jewish or African-Americans from purchasing homes, which remained in place for decades. Then-Senator Richard Nixon and his wife Pat Nixon signed one in 1951 for their $41,000 home at 4801 Tilden St., also signed by Edward J. Miller, president of WC and AN Miller Company.

The following is an excerpt from the restrictive covenant:&quot;NO PART OF LAND HEREBY CONVEYED SHALL EVER BE USED, OR OCCUPIED BY, OR SOLD , DEMISED, TRANSFERRED, CONVEYED UNTO, OR IN TRUST FOR, LEASED, OR PERSONS OF NEGRO BLOOD OR EXTRACTION, OR TO ANY RENTED OR GIVEN TO NEGRO PEOPLE OR ANY PERSON OR PERSON OF THE SEMITIC RACE, BLOOD, OR ORIGIN WHICH RACIAL DESCRIPTION SHALL BE DEEMED TO INCLUDE ARMENIANS, JEWS, HEBREWS, PERSIANS, OR SYRIANS, EXCEPT THAT, THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL NOT BE HELD TO EXCLUDE PARTIAL OCCUPANCY OF THE PREMISES BY DOMESTIC SERVANTS OF SAID PARITIES HERETO OF THE SECOND PART THEIR HEIRS OR ASSIGNS.&quot;

Friendship Park, often called Turtle Park, serves as a center for community activity. Neighborhood landmarks include American University&#x27;s Washington College of Law and Katzen Arts Center, the Georgetown Day School, Bernard T. Janney Elementary School, the residence of the Japanese ambassador, and the former embassy of Sweden (which was relocated to the Georgetown waterfront in October 2006), and it was long popular among the diplomatic community. Affordable housing drew young families to American University Park starting in the early 1990s. It remains highly desirable — real estate values have more than doubled since then. Average homes are now valued well over $1 million.

<doc id="1323985" wikidata="Q176827" url="?curid=1323985" title="Markov random field">
<text>In the domain of physics and probability, a Markov random field (MRF), Markov network or undirected [[graphical model]] is a set of random variables having a Markov property described by an undirected graph. In other words, a random field is said to be a Markov random field if it satisfies Markov properties. The concept originates from the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model.

A Markov network or MRF is similar to a Bayesian network in its representation of dependencies; the differences being that Bayesian networks are directed and acyclic, whereas Markov networks are undirected and may be cyclic. Thus, a Markov network can represent certain dependencies that a Bayesian network cannot (such as cyclic dependencies ); on the other hand, it can&#x27;t represent certain dependencies that a Bayesian network can (such as induced dependencies ). The underlying graph of a Markov random field may be finite or infinite.

When the joint probability density of the random variables is strictly positive, it is also referred to as a Gibbs random field, because, according to the Hammersley–Clifford theorem, it can then be represented by a Gibbs measure for an appropriate (locally defined) energy function. The prototypical Markov random field is the Ising model; indeed, the Markov random field was introduced as the general setting for the Ising model. In the domain of artificial intelligence, a Markov random field is used to model various low- to mid-level tasks in image processing and computer vision.

== Definition ==
Given an undirected graph formula_1, a set of random variables formula_2 indexed by formula_3  form a Markov random field with respect to formula_4  if they satisfy the local Markov properties:

:Pairwise Markov property: Any two non-adjacent variables are conditionally independent given all other variables:

::formula_5

:Local Markov property: A variable is conditionally independent of all other variables given its neighbors:

::formula_6
:where formula_7 is the set of neighbors of formula_8, and formula_9 is the closed neighbourhood of formula_8.

:Global Markov property: Any two subsets of variables are conditionally independent given a separating subset:

::formula_11
:where every path from a node in formula_12 to a node in formula_13 passes through formula_14.

The Global Markov property is stronger than the Local Markov property, which in turn is stronger than the Pairwise one. However, the above three Markov properties are equivalent for positive distributions (those that assign only nonzero probabilities to the associated variables).

The relation between the three Markov properties is particularly clear in the following formulation:

* Pairwise: For any formula_15 not equal or adjacent, formula_16.
* Local: For any formula_17 and formula_18 not containing or adjacent to formula_19, formula_20.
* Global: For any formula_21 not intersecting or adjacent, formula_22.

== Clique factorization ==
As the Markov property of an arbitrary probability distribution can be difficult to establish, a commonly used class of Markov random fields are those that can be factorized according to the cliques of the graph.

Given a set of random variables formula_2, let formula_24 be the probability of a particular field configuration formula_25 in formula_26—that is, formula_24 is the probability of finding that the random variables formula_26 take on the particular value formula_25. Because formula_26 is a set, the probability of formula_25 should be understood to be taken with respect to a &quot;joint distribution&quot; of the formula_32.

If this joint density can be factorized over the cliques of formula_4 as

:formula_34

then formula_26 forms a Markov random field with respect to formula_4. Here, formula_37 is the set of cliques of formula_4. The definition is equivalent if only maximal cliques are used. The functions formula_39 are sometimes referred to as &quot;factor potentials&quot; or &quot;clique potentials&quot;. Note, however, conflicting terminology is in use: the word &quot;potential&quot; is often applied to the logarithm of formula_39. This is because, in statistical mechanics, formula_41 has a direct interpretation as the potential energy of a configuration formula_42.

Some MRF&#x27;s do not factorize: a simple example can be constructed on a cycle of 4 nodes with some infinite energies, i.e. configurations of zero probabilities, even if one, more appropriately, allows the infinite energies to act on the complete graph on formula_3.

MRF&#x27;s factorize if at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled:
* the density is strictly positive (by the Hammersley–Clifford theorem)
* the graph is chordal (by equivalence to a Bayesian network)

When such a factorization does exist, it is possible to construct a factor graph for the network.

== Exponential family ==
Any positive Markov random field can be written as exponential family in canonical form with feature functions formula_44 such that the full-joint distribution can be written as

:formula_45
where the notation
:formula_46
is simply a dot product over field configurations, and &quot;Z&quot; is the partition function:

:formula_47

Here, formula_48 denotes the set of all possible assignments of values to all the network&#x27;s random variables. Usually, the feature functions formula_49 are defined such that they are indicators of the clique&#x27;s configuration, &quot;i.e.&quot; formula_50 if formula_51 corresponds to the &quot;i&quot;-th possible configuration of the &quot;k&quot;-th clique and 0 otherwise. This model is equivalent to the clique factorization model given above, if formula_52 is the cardinality of the clique, and the weight of a feature formula_49 corresponds to the logarithm of the corresponding clique factor, &quot;i.e.&quot; formula_54, where formula_55 is the &quot;i&quot;-th possible configuration of the &quot;k&quot;-th clique, &quot;i.e.&quot; the &quot;i&quot;-th value in the domain of the clique formula_56.

The probability &quot;P&quot; is often called the Gibbs measure. This expression of a Markov field as a logistic model is only possible if all clique factors are non-zero, &quot;i.e.&quot; if none of the elements of formula_48 are assigned a probability of 0. This allows techniques from matrix algebra to be applied, &quot;e.g.&quot; that the trace of a matrix is log of the determinant, with the matrix representation of a graph arising from the graph&#x27;s incidence matrix.

The importance of the partition function &quot;Z&quot; is that many concepts from statistical mechanics, such as entropy, directly generalize to the case of Markov networks, and an &quot;intuitive&quot; understanding can thereby be gained. In addition, the partition function allows variational methods to be applied to the solution of the problem: one can attach a driving force to one or more of the random variables, and explore the reaction of the network in response to this perturbation. Thus, for example, one may add a driving term &quot;J&quot;&quot;v&quot;, for each vertex &quot;v&quot; of the graph, to the partition function to get:

:formula_58

Formally differentiating with respect to &quot;J&quot;&quot;v&quot; gives the expectation value of the random variable &quot;X&quot;&quot;v&quot; associated with the vertex &quot;v&quot;:

:formula_59

Correlation functions are computed likewise; the two-point correlation is:

:formula_60

Unfortunately, though the likelihood of a logistic Markov network is convex, evaluating the likelihood or gradient of the likelihood of a model requires inference in the model, which is generally computationally infeasible (see &#x27;Inference&#x27; below).

== Examples ==

=== Gaussian ===
A multivariate normal distribution forms a Markov random field with respect to a graph formula_1 if the missing edges correspond to zeros on the precision matrix (the inverse covariance matrix):

:formula_62
such that
:formula_63

== Inference ==
As in a Bayesian network, one may calculate the conditional distribution of a set of nodes formula_64 given values to another set of nodes formula_65 in the Markov random field by summing over all possible assignments to formula_66; this is called exact inference. However, exact inference is a #P-complete problem, and thus computationally intractable in the general case. Approximation techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and loopy belief propagation are often more feasible in practice. Some particular subclasses of MRFs, such as trees (see Chow–Liu tree), have polynomial-time inference algorithms; discovering such subclasses is an active research topic. There are also subclasses of MRFs that permit efficient MAP, or most likely assignment, inference; examples of these include associative networks. Another interesting sub-class is the one of decomposable models (when the graph is chordal): having a closed-form for the MLE, it is possible to discover a consistent structure for hundreds of variables.

== Conditional random fields ==

One notable variant of a Markov random field is a conditional random field, in which each random variable may also be conditioned upon a set of global observations formula_67. In this model, each function formula_68 is a mapping from all assignments to both the clique &quot;k&quot; and the observations formula_67 to the nonnegative real numbers. This form of the Markov network may be more appropriate for producing discriminative classifiers, which do not model the distribution over the observations. CRFs were proposed by John D. Lafferty, Andrew McCallum and Fernando C.N. Pereira in 2001.

== Varied applications ==
Markov random fields find application in a variety of fields, ranging from computer graphics to computer vision, machine learning or computational biology, and information retrieval. MRFs are used in image processing to generate textures as they can be used to generate flexible and stochastic image models. In image modelling, the task is to find a suitable intensity distribution of a given image, where suitability depends on the kind of task and MRFs are flexible enough to be used for image and texture synthesis, image compression and restoration, image segmentation, 3D image inference from 2D images, image registration, texture synthesis, super-resolution, stereo matching and information retrieval. They can be used to solve various computer vision problems which can be posed as energy minimization problems or problems where different regions have to be distinguished using a set of discriminating features, within a Markov random field framework, to predict the category of the region. Markov random fields were a generalization over the Ising model and have, since then, been used widely in combinatorial optimizations and networks.

<text>Wilbert Joseph Keon (May 17, 1935 – April 7, 2019) was a Canadian physician. A heart surgeon and researcher by profession, Keon was a longtime Canadian senator.

==Biography==
Born in Sheenboro, Quebec, Keon received a Bachelor of Science from St. Patrick&#x27;s College, Carleton University and a Doctor of Medicine from the University of Ottawa.

After a period of studying and teaching at Harvard University in Boston, he returned to Ottawa in 1969. Keon founded the University of Ottawa Heart Institute at the Ottawa Civic Hospital in 1976, acting as its CEO for more than thirty years until his retirement from that job in April 2004. In 1986, he was the first Canadian to implant an artificial heart into a human as a bridge to transplant. Keon retired as a working doctor and resigned from the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons in June 2010.

In 1990 Keon was appointed to the Senate by Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn on the advice of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, where he sat as a Conservative. In 2010, Keon retired from the Senate upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75.

Keon married Anne Jennings in 1960. They have three children: Claudia, Ryan, (who ran for the Liberal Party of Canada in the federal riding of Nepean-Carleton,) and Neil. Keon also has a school named after him in Chapeau, Quebec. He died from a suspected heart attack on April 7, 2019, aged 83.

==Controversy==
On November 25, 1999, Keon was caught in a prostitution sting by an undercover Ottawa police officer. Shortly thereafter, on December 16 of that same year, he resigned as director of the Ottawa Heart Institute.

<text>&quot;Korobeiniki&quot; () is a nineteenth-century Russian folk song that tells the story of a meeting between a &quot;korobeinik&quot; (peddler) and a girl, describing their haggling over goods in a metaphor for seduction.

Outside Russia, &quot;Korobeiniki&quot; is widely known as the &quot;Tetris&quot; theme tune, from its appearance in Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy version of the game (titled &quot;A-Type&quot;) as arranged by the Japanese composer Hirokazu Tanaka in 1989.

The song &quot;Korobeiniki&quot; is based on the poem of the same name by Nikolay Nekrasov, which was first printed in the &quot;Sovremennik&quot; magazine in 1861. Its increasing tempo and the dance style led to it quickly becoming a popular Russian folk song. Early musical compositions of the song were published by and Alexander N. Chernyavsky (Чернявский, Александр Николаевич) in 1898. Varvara Panina made gramophone records of the song with several recording companies in 1905 and later.

==Melody==
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 \relative a&#x27; {
 \time 4/4 
 e4. gis8 b4 gis8 e8 a4. c8 e4 d8 c8 b4. c8 d4 e4 c4 a4 a2
 \repeat volta 2 { 
 f&#x27;4. g8 a4 g8 f8 e4. f8 e4 d8 c8 b4. c8 d4 e4 c4 a4 a2 }
&lt;/score&gt;

==Lyrics sample==
There are several variants the lyrics, all being minor variations of the beginning of the poem.
==Arrangements of the song==
Numerous Russian singers performed this song.
===Tetris===

After arrangements of &quot;Korobeiniki&quot; first appeared in Spectrum Holobyte&#x27;s Apple IIGS and Mac versions of &quot;Tetris&quot;, the song was re-arranged in 1989 by Hirokazu Tanaka as the &quot;Type A&quot; accompaniment in Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy version 1.1. It has since become closely associated with the game in Western popular culture and the Tetris Company has required its inclusion in every version of the game since 2002. In 2008, UGO listed the song as the 3rd best video game music of all time.

The Tetris Company holds a sound trademark on this variation of the song for use in video games. The official &quot;Tetris&quot; website wrote that Korobeiniki was &quot;memorable enough on its own as both a poem and folk tune&quot;, independent of its adaption into the &quot;Tetris&quot; theme.

Doctor Spin&#x27;s 1992 novelty Eurodance cover version under the name &quot;Tetris&quot; reached No. 6 on the UK singles chart.

In November 2024, Hiiragi Magnetite released the song &quot;Tetoris&quot; (featuring Kasane Teto), inspired by the Tetris theme. The song spread rapidly on social media immediately after its release, debuting at number one on both the JAPAN Heatseekers Songs and Niconico Vocaloid Songs Top 20 charts. It also debuted at number 71 on the &quot;Billboard Japan&quot; Hot 100 chart for the week of December 23, 2024, eventually reaching number 35. The music video reached 10 million views on YouTube in December.

=== Other adaptations and versions ===
* Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra has recorded and performed versions of the song under the title &quot;Peddlers&quot; (sometimes ぺドラーズ &quot;Pedorāzu&quot;) since their eponymous debut EP in 1989. Most recently, it can be found on their 2014 album &quot;Ska Me Forever&quot;.
* String quartet Bond included a version on their 2000 debut album &quot;Born&quot; called &quot;Korobushka&quot;, which they often perform at their live concerts.
* American rock band Ozma released a rock version on their 2001 album &quot;The Doubble Donkey Disc&quot;; it was used in the 2013 film &quot;Kick Ass 2&quot;.
* An Italian house remix of the song, &quot;Cammino Contento&quot;, was featured on the 2005 Gigi D&#x27;Agostino compilation album &quot;Disco Tanz&quot;.
*The song has also been arranged by Yoko Shimomura for &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;. The song is retained in later versions of &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; as well.
* The Timbers Army performs the melody with altered lyrics during Portland Timbers games, usually accompanied by a simple dance with a large visual effect.
*German band dArtagnan used the music for their song &quot;Trink mein Freund&quot; and released a folk rock version of &quot;Korobeiniki&quot; (in Russian) on their 2022 album &quot;Felsenfest&quot;.

<doc id="1324009" wikidata="Q7575646" url="?curid=1324009" title="Speedpass">
<text>Speedpass was a keychain radio-frequency identification (RFID) device introduced in 1997 by Mobil (which merged with Exxon to become ExxonMobil in 1999) for electronic payment. It was originally developed by Verifone. By 2004, more than seven million people possessed Speedpass tags, which could be used at approximately 10,000 Exxon, Mobil and Esso gas stations worldwide.

Speedpass was one of the first widely deployed consumer RFID payment systems of its kind, debuting nationwide in 1997 far ahead of VISA and MasterCard RFID trials.

==History==
The ExxonMobil Speedpass was based on the Texas Instruments TIRIS RFID platform. It was originally designed by Verifone in two configurations; one intended for installation inside the fuel dispensing &quot;pump&quot;, and a convenience store model known as the Verifone RF250 (which was a redesign of the Ingenico iSC250 reader for smart cards).
The ExxonMobil Speedpass used a cryptographically-enabled tag with a Digital Signature Transponder (DST) which incorporated a weak, proprietary encryption scheme to perform a challenge–response protocol. On January 29, 2005, RSA Security and a group of students from Johns Hopkins University broke the proprietary encryption algorithm used by the Exxon-Mobil Speedpass. They were able to successfully copy a Speedpass and use the copied RFID tag to purchase gas.

In an attempt to prevent fraud, Speedpass users ultimately were required to enter their zip code into scanners at some gas stations. 

==Convenience Stores and the &quot;Flying Red Horse&quot;==
At one point, Speedpass was deployed experimentally in fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in select markets. McDonald&#x27;s alone deployed Speedpass in over 400 restaurants in the Greater Chicago area.

During the 1998 development of the RF250 convenience store reader, some prototype units were shipped from Verifone in Rocklin, California, to a Verifone office in Florida. The units did not arrive on time and were thought to have been lost in transit. They were later found, and despite each unit having a Verifone logo and being encased in boxes showing the Verifone logo; the shipping company had nothing in their lost goods database showing that name. Rather, the units turned up via a query for &quot;flying red horse&quot;, apparently since the units displayed a small Mobil logo - and the Mobil logo was and is a red Pegasus. The internal codename for the project was thus changed to &quot;Flying Red Horse&quot; 

The test was deemed a failure and McDonald&#x27;s removed the scanners from all their restaurants in mid-2004. Additionally, the New England grocery chain Stop &amp; Shop tested Speedpass at their Boston area stores; the units were removed in early 2005. Speedpass has also been previously available through a Speedpass Car Tag and a Speedpass-enabled Timex watch.

==Discontinuance and the switch to Speedpass+==
ExxonMobil announced that the RFID based key tag would be fully retired by June 30, 2019. ExxonMobil directed users to use the Speedpass+ app on their smartphone. The smartphone app uses the phone&#x27;s location data to pay at the pump using the app. The app detects the users location which then prompts the user to input the pump number they are using. Conversely if location services are not activated for the app, the user can scan a QR code on the pump to activate pay at the pump functionality. In the United States, the app has since been renamed the Exxon Mobil Rewards+ app, although it still utilizes the Speedpass+ functionality. In Canada, it continues to use the Speedpass+ name for its app.

The authors of the &quot;Buildings of England&quot; series refer to its &quot;magnificent scale&quot;, and consider it to be &quot;probably the grandest ...suite of civic rooms in the country&quot;, and &quot;an outstanding and complete example of late Georgian decoration&quot;.

It is not an administrative building but a civic suite, Lord Mayor&#x27;s parlour and Council chamber; local government administration is centred at the nearby Cunard Building. The town hall was built between 1749 and 1754 to a design by John Wood the Elder replacing an earlier town hall nearby. An extension to the north designed by James Wyatt was added in 1785. Following a fire in 1795 the hall was largely rebuilt and a dome designed by Wyatt was built. Minor alterations have subsequently been made. The streets surrounding its site have altered since its initiation, notably when viewed from Castle Street, the south-side, it appears as off-centre. This is because Water Street which ran to the junction with Dale Street, the west-east axis, was continuous and built up across the junction so that the town hall was not visible originally from that aspect. The structures were removed 150 years after this to expose the building from this position.

The ground floor contains the city&#x27;s Council Chamber and a Hall of Remembrance for the Liverpool servicemen killed in the First World War. The upper floor consists of a suite of lavishly decorated rooms which are used for a variety of events and functions. Conducted tours of the building are arranged for the general public and the hall is licensed for weddings.

==History==

The first recorded town hall in Liverpool was in 1515 and it was probably a thatched building. and was located in the block bounded by High Street, Dale Street &amp; Exchange Street East. It was replaced in 1673 by a building slightly to the south of the present town hall. This town hall stood on &quot;pillars and arches of hewen stone&quot; and under it was the exchange for merchants and traders to carry out their business.

Building of the present town hall began in 1749 on a site slightly to the north of its predecessor; its foundation stone was laid on 14 September. The architect was John Wood the Elder, who has been described as &quot;one of the outstanding architects of the day&quot;. It was completed and opened in 1754. The ground floor acted as the exchange, and a council room and other offices were on the upper floor. The ground floor had a central courtyard surrounded by Doric colonnades but it was &quot;dark and confined, and the merchants preferred to transact business in the street outside&quot;. Above the building was a large square dome with a cupola. In 1769 the building was provided with a turret clock manufactured by Joseph Finney of Liverpool.

The town hall was bombarded by striking seamen during the 1775 Liverpool Seamen&#x27;s Revolt.
The very last act of the American Civil War was when Captain Waddell walked up the steps of the town hall in November 1865 with a letter to present to the mayor surrendering his vessel, the CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, to the British government.

Improvements began in 1785 with an extension to the north designed by James Wyatt. Buildings close to the west and north sides were demolished, and John Foster prepared plans for the west façade. In 1786 Wood&#x27;s square dome was demolished and plans were made by Wyatt for a new dome over the central courtyard. In 1795, before the new dome was built, the hall was seriously damaged by a fire. Wyatt&#x27;s north extension was not significantly damaged, but Wood&#x27;s original building was gutted. The building was reconstructed and Wyatt&#x27;s new dome was added. The work was supervised by Foster and completed in 1802. Under the dome the central courtyard was replaced with a hall containing a staircase. In 1811 a portico was added to the south side. The construction and decoration of the interior was completed by about 1820.

In 1857 a telegraph wire was laid from the Observatory at Waterloo Dock to the Town Hall (at the suggestion of the Director of the Observatory, John Hartnup) with the intention of using &#x27;galvanic current&#x27; to transmit a time signal from the &#x27;normal clock&#x27; in the observatory to the turret clock in the dome of the Town Hall, so as to ensure that it displayed accurate time. This was achieved through an invention of a Mr R. L. Jones of Chester: by replacing the pendulum bob of the clock with a hollow electro-magnetic coil (in the manner of Bain&#x27;s electric pendulum) and connecting it to the telegraph wire (which provided a regular pulse of current at one second intervals from the Observatory clock), the two clocks became synchronised; and so &#x27;was seen the curious spectacle of a great clock with works nearly 100 years old keeping time with astronomical accuracy&#x27;. This was the first application of clock network technology to a large public clock; it was later applied to (among others) the clock in the Victoria Tower, and the two were thenceforth heard to strike the hour simultaneously.

In 1881 an attempt to blow up the town hall by the Fenians was aborted. Between 1899 and 1900 the portico on the north face was rebuilt and extended, and the northern extension was enlarged to form a recess in the Council Chamber for the Lord Mayor&#x27;s chair, this was the work of the borough surveyor Thomas Shelmerdine. In 1921 a room on the ground floor was made into the Hall of Remembrance to commemorate the military men from Liverpool who died in the First World War. Part of the building was damaged in the Liverpool Blitz of 1941; this restored after the end of the Second World War. Further restoration was carried out between 1993 and 1995. Between 2014 and 2015 the exterior of the building was renovated as part of a £400,000 project. The work included repairing bomb damage from the 1941 Blitz and cleaning the sandstone from the effects of pollution.

==Architecture==

===Exterior===

The town hall is built of stone with a slate roof and a lead dome. Its plan consists of a rectangle with a portico extending to the south and Wyatt&#x27;s rectangular extension to the north. The extension is slightly narrower than the rest of the building, and also has a projecting portico. The building has two storeys and a basement; the stonework of the basement and lower storey is rusticated. The south face, overlooking Castle Street, has nine bays. Its central three bays are occupied by the portico. This has three rounded arches on the ground floor, and four pairs of Corinthian columns in the upper storey surrounding a balcony. The east and west faces also have nine bays in the original part of the building, plus an additional three bays to the north on Wyatt&#x27;s extension. The middle three bays of the nine original bays project slightly forward and are surmounted by a pediment. The roof of the north face is higher than that of the main building. This face has five bays, with a central portico of three bays. On its first floor are four pairs of Corinthian columns and standing on the roof above these are four statues dating from 1792 by Richard Westmacott; these statues have been moved from the Irish Houses of Parliament. Above the upper storey windows on all faces are panels containing carvings, some of which relate to Liverpool&#x27;s foreign trade. The dome stands on a high drum supported on Corinthian columns. Around the base of the dome are four clock faces, each of which is supported by a lion and unicorn. On the summit of the dome is a statue, representing Minerva. It is high and was designed by John Charles Felix Rossi.

===Interior===

====Ground floor====

The main door in the south face leads to the Vestibule or Entrance Hall. It has a floor of encaustic tiles which include depictions of the arms of Liverpool and the liver bird.
 The room is panelled and on the east side is a large wooden fireplace containing 17th century Flemish carvings. It has a groin-vaulted ceiling, and in the lunettes are murals painted in 1909 by J.H. Amschewitz, depicting events in Liverpool&#x27;s history; King John creating Liverpool a free port (west wall); Industry and Peace (North Wall); Liverpool the centre of commerce (east wall); Education and Progress (South wall). Below these are brass tablets containing the names of the freemen of Liverpool. Also in the entrance hall are bardic chairs from the two Eisteddfods held in the city.

At the rear of the ground floor in Wyatt&#x27;s extension is the Council Chamber. This has mahogany-panelled walls and can seat 160 people. Adjacent to the Council Chamber is the Hall of Remembrance. On its wall are panels bearing the names of the military men who lost their lives in the First World War, and eight murals painted by Frank O. Salisbury in 1923.

In the centre of the ground floor is the Staircase Hall described in the &quot;Buildings of England&quot; series as &quot;one of the great architectural spaces of Liverpool&quot;. A broad staircase rises between two pairs of Corinthian columns to a half-landing, and narrower flights climb from that on each side to the upper floor. On the ground floor on each side of the staircase are display cabinets holding the city&#x27;s silver. On the half-landing is a statue of George Canning dated 1832 by Francis Chantrey, and hanging on the wall above this is a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Sir Edward Halliday.

Above the staircase the dome is carried by four pendentives; it rises to a height of and its interior is coffered. Around the base of the dome is inscribed Liverpool&#x27;s motto, &quot;Deus Nobis Haec Otia Fecit&quot;, and in the pendentives are paintings dated 1902 by Charles Wellington Furse depicting scenes of dock labour.

====Upper floor====
All the rooms on this floor are designed for entertainment and they have connecting doors that allow for a complete circuit of the floor. The middle room on the south side of the building is the Central Reception Room. It has a circular ceiling with pendentives, and plasterwork in neoclassical style designed by Francesco Bernasconi. The room leads to the balcony overlooking Castle Street. A door to the right leads to the West Reception Room, with a segmented-vaulted ceiling; it contains a marble chimneypiece with brass and cast iron fittings. This room leads to the Dining Room which occupies the west side of the building. It has been described as &quot;the most sumptuous room in the building&quot;. Around the room are Corinthian pilasters. The plaster ceiling has moulded compartments and under these is a frieze decorated with scrolls, urns and crouching dogs. The roundels between the capitals of the pilasters contain paintings of pairs of cupids.

The next room on the circuit is a small room which leads into the Large Ballroom. This occupies the whole of Wyatt&#x27;s north extension and measures by ; the ceiling is high. Around the room are Corinthian pilasters and on each of the shorter walls is a massive mirror. In the south wall is a niche for musicians, over which is a coffered semi-dome; on each side of this is a white marble chimneypiece. Hanging from the ceiling are &quot;three of the finest Georgian chandeliers in Europe&quot;; each is high, contains 20,000 pieces of cut glass crystal, and weighs over one ton. They were made in Staffordshire in 1820. The floor is a maple sprung dance floor. Most of the east side of the hall is occupied by the Small Ballroom, also known as the East Reception Room or Music Room. This room is surrounded by pilasters and at each end is a shallow apse; the apse in the north wall has two niches for musicians. Suspended from the ceiling are three 19th century chandeliers. Completing the circuit is the East Reception Room, similar in style to the West Reception Room. The rooms contain a number of portraits; one of these is of James Maury, America&#x27;s first consul.

==Current use and surroundings==

Liverpool City Council meets every seven weeks in the Council Chambers to conduct the business of the city. The town hall is open to the general public each month when conducted tours take place. The hall is licensed for weddings and, in addition to providing a venue for the ceremony, catering facilities can be supplied for a reception or a meal. Catering is also available for other events and functions. Council officers and their departments are based in the nearby Cunard Building.

Immediately to the north of the town hall is a paved square known as Exchange Flags; this is surrounded on all sides by modern office buildings. In the square is the Nelson Monument, celebrating the achievements of Horatio Nelson. It is a Grade II* listed building and is the earliest surviving public monument in the city.

<doc id="1324017" wikidata="Q438511" url="?curid=1324017" title="Alternative Investment Market">
<text>AIM (formerly the Alternative Investment Market) is a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange that was launched on 19 June 1995 as a replacement to the previous Unlisted Securities Market (USM) that had been in operation since 1980. It allows companies that are smaller, less-developed, or want/need a more flexible approach to governance to float shares with a more flexible regulatory system than is applicable on the main market.

At launch, AIM comprised only 10 companies valued collectively at £82.2 million. As at May 2021, 821 companies comprised the sub-market, with an average market cap of £80 million per listing. AIM has also started to become an international exchange, often due to its low regulatory burden, especially in relation to the US Sarbanes–Oxley Act (though only a quarter of AIM-listed companies would qualify to be listed on a US stock exchange even prior to passage of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act). By December 2005, over 270 foreign companies had been admitted to AIM.

The FTSE Group maintains three indices for measuring AIM, which are the FTSE AIM UK 50 Index, FTSE AIM 100 Index, and FTSE AIM All-Share Index.

==Regulatory model==

AIM is an exchange regulated venue featuring an array of principles-based rules for publicly held companies. AIM&#x27;s regulatory model is based on a comply-or-explain option that lets companies that are floated on AIM either comply with AIM&#x27;s relatively few rules, or explain why it has decided not to comply with them.

===Nominated Advisers (Nomads)===
Aside from granting leeway in regard to regulatory compliance, the Exchange also mandates continuous oversight and advice by the issuer&#x27;s underwriter, referred to as a Nominated Adviser (Nomad). The role of Nomads is central to AIM&#x27;s regulatory model, as these entities play the role of gatekeepers, advisers and regulators of AIM companies. In advising each firm as to which rules should be complied with and the manner in which existing requirements should be met, Nomads provide the essential service of allowing firms to abide by tailor-made regulation, reducing regulatory costs in the process. Theoretically, Nomads are liable for damages from tolerating misdemeanors on behalf of their supervised companies, including the loss of reputational capital. However, this heavy reliance on Nomads has been criticised as creating a conflict of interest, since Nomads receive fees from the companies they purportedly supervise while, in practice, managing to avoid liability for market misconduct.

In 2006, the London Stock Exchange launched a review of Nomad activities, resulting in a regulatory &quot;handbook&quot; for Nomads published by the Financial Services Authority in 2007.

===Self-regulation===
AIM is an unregulated market segment, therefore it escapes most of the mandatory provisions contained in European Union directives – as implemented in the UK – and other rules applicable to companies listed in the LSE. AIM believes self-regulation is pivotal to AIM&#x27;s low regulatory burden: companies seeking an AIM listing are not subject to significant admission requirements; after admission is granted, firms must comply with ongoing obligations which are comparatively lower to the ones that govern the operation of larger exchanges; and certain corporate governance provisions are not mandatory for AIM companies. Therefore, AIM-listed companies are often subject to manipulation by institutional investors. AIM-listed companies usually are only required to adhere to the corporate governance requirements of their home jurisdiction, which, as a practical matter, vary widely.

However, the regulatory requirements are more onerous than for private companies and AIM listed plcs are required to prepare audited annual accounts under IFRS.

===Investor base===
Another important element of AIM&#x27;s model is the composition of its investor base. Although AIM-listed companies are not start-ups, most are small and potentially more risky than a FTSE listing. This may prove to be hazardous for unsophisticated investors who lack both the knowledge and resources to conduct proper inquiries into a firm&#x27;s prospects and activities, or even larger investors which lack strong internal control and risk management requirements. As a consequence, AIM&#x27;s investor base is largely composed of institutional investors and wealthy individuals.

==Criticism==

===&quot;Casino&quot; environment===
In March 2007, U.S. securities regulator Roel Campos suggested that AIM&#x27;s rules for share trading have created a market like a casino. Campos reportedly said: &quot;I&#x27;m concerned that 30% of issuers that list on AIM are gone in a year. That feels like a casino to me and I believe that investors will treat it as such.&quot; The comment resulted in several angry retorts, including one from the London Stock Exchange, which controls AIM, pointing out that the number of companies that go into liquidation or administration in a year is actually fewer than 2%.

AIM has since issued new rules requiring that listed companies maintain a website.

The calibre of participants in the market has also been criticised by fund manager John Hempton of Bronte Capital Management.

=== Crown Corporation / Langbar International fraud ===

In 2003 Langbar international was admitted to the AIM.

In 2011 Langbar&#x27;s now former CEO, Stuart Pearson was found guilty of &quot;three counts of making misleading statements by falsely claiming in stock market announcements that the company had assets held by Banco do Brasil and that some assets were being transferred to the company&quot;, jailed for 12 months and banned for being a company director for five years.

This £365 million ($750m) share fraud was investigated by the Serious Fraud Office and the City of London Police when it was discovered in November 2005 that Langbar had none of the assets it declared at listing. This was due in part because the Nomad (Nominated Adviser) failed to carry out due diligence. Also, the Exchange did not ensure that the AIM rules had been complied with. AIM changed the rules for Nomads in 2006. On 19 October 2007 they fined Nabarro Wells £250,000 ($512,500) and publicly censured them for breaches of the AIM rules.

==Trends==
In March 2007 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; noticed a tendency to use listing vehicles incorporated in offshore financial centres prior to floating on AIM. Some 35% of the companies floated on AIM during 2006 were from OFCs, of which the majority came from the Channel Islands or the British Virgin Islands.

On 29 January 2009 it was announced that AIM is to form the basis of an Asian-orientated growth or incubator market called &#x27;Tokyo AIM&#x27;, which will be run as a joint venture between the Tokyo Stock Exchange and LSE. Tokyo AIM will replicate AIM&#x27;s system of oversight by NOMADs, with &#x27;J-Nomads&#x27; being &quot;selected and approved by TOKYO AIM ... to assess companies&#x27; suitability for the market&quot;. In July 2012, TOKYO AIM changed its name to TOKYO PRO Market, and since then Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. has continued to operate TOKYO AIM based on the original market concept.

==Dividends==
As of 1 October 2018, just under a third of AIM-listed companies have paid shareholders a dividend within their most recent financial year. The largest companies to have paid dividends include: Fevertree Drinks PLC (FEVR), Burford Capital Ltd (BUR), and Abcam PLC (ABC). The smallest companies to have paid dividends include: Holders Technology PLC (HDT), Aeorema Communications PLC (AEO), and Stilo International (STL).

<doc id="1324021" wikidata="Q624075" url="?curid=1324021" title="Vauxhall Victor">
<text>The Vauxhall Victor is a large family car produced by Vauxhall from 1957 until 1976. The Victor was introduced to replace the outgoing Wyvern model. It was renamed Vauxhall VX Series in 1976 and continued in production until 1978, by which time it had grown significantly and was viewed, at least in its home market, as a larger-than-average family car.

The last Victor, the Victor FE, was also manufactured under licence by Hindustan Motors in India as the Hindustan Contessa, during the 1980s and early 2000s, with an Isuzu engine.

The Victor was replaced in 1978 by the Vauxhall Carlton - essentially a badge engineered version of the Opel Rekord E.

The Victor briefly became Britain&#x27;s most exported car, with sales in markets as far flung as the United States (sold by Pontiac dealers, since Vauxhall had been part of GM from 1925), Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Asian right-hand drive markets, such as Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore.

In Canada, it was marketed as both the Vauxhall Victor (sold through Pontiac/Buick dealerships) and the Envoy (through Chevrolet/Oldsmobile dealers). The Victor was also instrumental in giving Vauxhall its first in-house-designed estate, which complemented the four-door saloon.

==F Series Victor==
The original Victor, launched on 28 February 1957, was coded the F series and saw a production run of more than 390,000 units. The car was of unitary construction and featured a large glass area with heavily curved windscreen and rear window. Following American styling trends then current, the windscreen pillars (A-pillars) sloped forwards. In fact, the body style was derived directly from the classic ′55 Chevrolet Bel Air. Bench seats were fitted front and rear trimmed in Rayon and &quot;Elastofab&quot;, and two-colour interior trim was standard. The Super model had extra chrome trim, notably around the windows; remnants of the signature Vauxhall bonnet flutes ran along the front flanks and the exhaust pipe exited through the rear bumper. The car was equipped with arm rests on the doors, door-operated courtesy lights, a two-spoke steering wheel, and twin sun visors, It is designed to compete with the Ford Consul Mk2, Austin A55 Cambridge, and the Morris Oxford Series III.


An estate variant was launched in 1958. When restyled, as the Series 2, the car lost all its &#x27;57 Buick styled bumper pods and the teardrop shaped Vauxhall flutes were replaced by a single chrome side-stripe running nose to tail. The sculpted &quot;porthole&quot; rear bumper tips, which rusted badly due to exhaust residue, were replaced by plain, straight ones. The old bumper ends continued to be used for many years on a variety of motor coaches and ice-cream vans.

Although the engine was of similar size to that of the outgoing Wyvern it was in critical respects new. Fitted with a single Zenith carburettor it had an output of at 4200 rpm and gained a reputation of giving a long trouble free life. This was also the year when Vauxhall standardized on &quot;premium&quot; grade petrol/gasoline, permitting an increase in the compression ratio from the Wyvern&#x27;s 6.8:1 to 7.8:1. Premium grade petrol had become available in the UK at the end of 1953, following an end to post-war fuel rationing, and at that time offered average octane level of 93, but in the ensuing four years this had crept up to 95 (RON).

The Victor&#x27;s three-speed gearbox had synchromesh on all forward ratios and was operated by a column-mounted lever. In early 1958 Newtondrive two-pedal control was available as an option.

Suspension was independent at the front by coil springs and an anti-roll bar was fitted on a rubber-mounted cross member. The rear suspension used a live axle and semi elliptic leaf springs. Steering was of the recirculating ball type. Lockheed hydraulic drum brakes were used.

A &quot;Super&quot; version tested by The Motor magazine in 1957 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 28.1 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £758 including taxes. The estate costs £931.

A Series II model was announced in 1959 with simplified styling. The new car was available in three versions with a Deluxe as the top model featuring leather trim and separate front seats.

F Series Victor sedans were assembled at General Motors New Zealand plant in Petone. Most were Supers with column shift and three-speed manual transmission, though some base models were made for government fleet contracts. Wagons were imported.

F type Victors were available in the United States and Canada through the Pontiac dealer network. They are the only Vauxhall-brand car ever offered in the US, however Vauxhalls continued to be available from Buick-Pontiac-GMC dealers in Canada (along with their unique Envoy-branded variants sold at Chevrolet-Oldsmobile dealers) until 1971.
==FB Series Victor and VX4/90==
The more cleanly styled FB announced 14 September 1960 ran until 1964 with a substantial improvement regarding rust protection. It was widely exported, although sales in the US ended after 1961 when Pontiac, Oldsmobile and Buick came up with home-grown compact models of their own, with the all-new GM &quot;Y&quot; platform (North America). Consequently, the FB only achieved sales of 328,000 vehicles by the time it was replaced in 1964. The body styling owed nothing to any US GM influence, the flat front and turtle-deck rear resembling some older US Fords. Mechanically, the main change was the option of a 4-speed all-synchromesh transmission with floor change but the previously used 3-speed all-synchro column change unit was still fitted as standard. The base (FBY) engine was also revised with higher compression ratio and revised manifolding increasing the power output to . In September 1963 the engine was enlarged from 1508 to 1594 cc, identified as the FB30. The increased capacity coincided with a further increase in the compression ratio of the standard engine from 8.1:1 to 8.5:1, reflecting the continuing increase of the average octane level of &quot;premium grade&quot; fuel (on which the Victor unit had by now standardised) offered in the UK, now to 97 (RON). 1963 was also the year when front disc brakes with larger wheels became an option. Models with the larger engine had a revised frontal treatment with a block style grille element and revised parking lights at either lower extreme of the grille.

A Vynide-covered bench front seat was standard on the base model and Super Victor but individual seats were standard on the De Luxe and optional on the lower-priced cars. Other options included a heater, fog lamps, radio, screen washers, reversing light and seat belts.

A 1508 cc &quot;Super&quot; version was tested by the British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1961 and was found to have a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 22.6 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £798 including taxes of £251.

A sporty derivative, the VX4/90, announced separately in mid-October 1961 was also available. It was fitted with a twin-carburettor, a taller alloy head, high-compression expansion controlled pistons, and a nitrided EN19B steel crankshaft engine giving and servo-assisted disc brakes (same as Cresta brakes) on the front wheels. Externally the car was distinguished from the standard car by a coloured stripe down the side, revised grille and larger tail-light clusters. These cosmetic features were essentially similar to the Canadian-market-only Envoy models.

The VX4/90 was available only in saloon form with 4-speed (GM Opel) all-synchro gearbox, Lockheed front disc brakes, 14 inch wheels, front individual / bucket seats, full instrumentation including mechanically driven (from the distributor) tachometer and heater. The VX4/90 FBX engine also was upgraded to the 31FB, the larger bore size giving 1595 cc (97 cubic inches). With a change in rear axle ratio from 4.125 to 3.9, the VX 4/90 could now easily exceed 90 mph.

General Motors New Zealand assembled the Victor FB sedan line in New Zealand, in Standard and Super form with three speed, column shift manual and bench front seat. Four speed floor shift, a factory option in England, was not available nor were disc brakes. Wagons, Deluxe sedans and the VX4/90 were rare imports, many under the no-remittance, no overseas exchange, deposit scheme available to consumers at the time. The Kiwi models were facelifted for 1964 but did not get the revised rear licence plate surround introduced in the UK market.
==FC Series Victor and VX4/90==

The FC was the first Vauxhall to use curved side-window glass, allowing greater internal width: the Estate derivative was noted as being especially capacious for its class. Nevertheless, the public at the time regarded it as a qualitative downgrade after the pleasantly styled, conservative FB. As a countermeasure the FC Victor was marketed as the Victor 101, the name arising from the claim that there were &#x27;101 improvements&#x27; over the FB. Bench or separate front seating was offered, with three-speed column-change gearbox or the optional four-speed floor change. A &#x27;Powerglide&#x27; two-speed automatic transmission was also available. Another US feature was that the optional radio was incorporated into the bright-metal dashboard trim. An innovative styling cue, which was adopted four years later by the Audi 100, was the incorporation of the side and indicator lamps in the front bumper, as had been common practice in the US for many years. The sculpted bumpers were, for the first time in the UK, contiguous with the body styling. The overall look of the car was unique in GM, with its slab sides outlined with brightwork seam covers incorporating the door handles. This, with the full width grille incorporating the headlights, was more reminiscent of the Lincoln Continental.

The FC (101) was the last Victor to have an engine with push rods and rockers operating the overhead valves. Victor FC models had racked up 238,000 sales by late 1967 when the &#x27;Coke bottle&#x27;-shaped FD replaced it.

As with the rest of the running gear, the sporting VX 4/90 was developed from the FB series and offered an alloy head, higher compression ratio, twin-Zenith 34IV carburettors, stiffer suspension and additional instruments. Vauxhall took the VX4/90 seriously enough to offer an optional limited-slip differential, but few cars were ordered with it: the VX4/90 was, by this time, largely overshadowed by the less expensive Ford Cortina GT, which also had a higher profile in race and rally competitions.

Overall, FC survival numbers appear to be less than the F, FB and even FD series, due to bad rust problems, so examples are rare, unfairly forgotten, and undervalued.

Towards the end of the model run, in May 1967, a Victor 101 de luxe was road tested by Britain&#x27;s &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine. The vehicle tested came with a four-speed floor-change gearbox and the 1595 cc engine delivering a claimed 66 bhp. A maximum speed of 81 mph (130 km/h) was achieved, which matched that achieved by a recently tested Austin A60 Cambridge and a Ford Cortina 1600 de luxe. The Victor accelerated to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 20.4 seconds, which was slightly quicker than the Austin but slightly slower than the lighter Cortina. The Vauxhall&#x27;s overall fuel consumption for the test, at 23.1 mpg (10.9 L/100 km) placed it at the bottom of this class by more than 10%, while its manufacturer&#x27;s recommended retail price of £822 was higher than that asked for the Austin at £804 or for the Ford at £761. (A lower price of £806 would have been available on the Victor if the test car had come with the three-speed column-change gearbox and all-round drum brakes.) The overall tone of the test was cautiously positive, with plaudits for the comfort, the lightness of the controls, the (optional) servo-assisted disc/drum brakes and the road holding, but adverse comments concerning the extent of the Victor&#x27;s propensity to roll and the rather low gearing which accentuated the variability of fuel consumption according to driving style.

All Victors sported a different grille treatment for 1967, a final-year facelift that was standard Vauxhall practice at the time. This had a more finished and upmarket look with sturdier bars rather than the cheaper looking criss-cross element on earlier cars. The waistline chrome strip was also thinner.

New Zealand assembly continued again with the Super with three-speed manual column-shift transmission and bench front seat though some base models - minus the distinctive waistline chrome strips - were also built for government fleet business. Powerglide two-speed automatic became an option in 1966. As with the FB, there were no factory options. The model was facelifted for 1967 and, near the end of the run, a four-speed manual gearbox with floor shift and twin front seats replaced the three-speeder with bench seat. Some Deluxe models, wagons and VX4/90s were imported fully assembled from the UK but were quite rare.

==FD Series Victor, VX4/90 and Ventora==

The FD was released at a time when the UK was undergoing a currency crisis as well as increasingly militant labour relations, resulting in rising prices and reduced quality. The FD Victor was inspired by the contemporary &quot;coke bottle&quot; styling which had emanated from Detroit USA, five years before Ford&#x27;s Cortina MK III. Fitted with all-new 1599 cc and 1975 cc engines that were the first British mass produced belt-driven overhead camshaft engines, the Slant Four was advanced for its time and application. The car also featured a bonded-in windscreen, the first for a mass produced car. The suspension design of the car was more sophisticated than most other British mass-produced efforts of the time, with a live axle located by trailing arms and a Panhard rod and sprung on coil springs instead of the traditional leaf springs, and a double wishbone front suspension assembly. The FD Victor was first shown at the October 1967 British Motor Show. where it was dubbed &quot;Car of The Show&quot; and also received the Don Safety Award.

The FD, however, departed from the traditional Victor family car bench front seat norm (there were still models with bench seats however) and could be ordered with comfortable contoured bucket seating front and rear. This was standard on the Victor 2000 (later 2000 SL with the facelift for 1970) and optional on the Victor 1600 (renamed Super with the 1970 facelift). Bucket seats were standard on the more sporty VX4/90 and six-cylinder Ventora versions, with the latter having reclining backrests as standard from 1969. All bucket seat models dispensed with the column shift and adopted a four-speed floor shift, with overdrive standard on manual VX4/90s and optional on the Ventora.
In February 1968, Vauxhall launched the Vauxhall Ventora, which was in effect a marriage of the Victor FD body with the 3.3-litre six-cylinder engine hitherto offered only in the larger Cresta and Viscount models. The Ventora offered a claimed of output compared with from the 2-litre 4-cylinder Victor, also featuring correspondingly larger front disc-brake calipers. The Ventora therefore differed most spectacularly from its siblings through its effortless performance: in that respect it had no obvious direct competitor at or near its price (£1,102 including taxes in February 1968) on the UK market. The interior was also enhanced, with extra instrumentation including a rev counter. From the outside Ventoras can be identified by their wider tyres, a front grille of toothy-harmonica like gaps in place of the Victor&#x27;s closely packed horizontal bars, fluted inserts in the hubcaps, and a black vinyl roof.

May 1968 saw the return to the Vauxhall range of a Victor estate, now based on the Victor FD. The estate, like the saloon, offered a choice of 1599 cc or 1975 cc four-cylinder engines and was also offered with the 3294 cc engine normally found in the Vauxhall Cresta. (The Victor estate 3294 was the only six-cylinder Victor offered on the domestic market, although the Ventora was effectively a six-cylinder Victor saloon by another name.) Rear suspension was beefed up on the estate models and all apart from the base 1599 cc version came with front wheel disc brakes. As on the FD saloon, however, the standard transmission was a three-speed manual gearbox controlled from a column-mounted lever. A four-speed box with a floor-mounted gear lever was available at extra cost on the four-cylinder models, although it was included in the overall package for buyers of the Victor 3294 cc estate. The floor-mounted lever was set well forward to enable it to remain clear of the bench front seat which was standard in the 1599 cc versions.

Sales of the FD came in below those of the FC, at 198,000 or so units produced over a slightly longer production run that ended in December 1971, though new cars were offered for sale until the arrival of the Victor FE in March 1972. The lower numbers reflected the effects of a long strike Vauxhall underwent in 1970, as well as the closing off of some export markets — the FD was the last Victor to be sold in Canada as either a Vauxhall or Envoy, and the last to be officially imported (and assembled) into New Zealand.

As well as the 1.6 and 2.0 I4s, the FD series, the last Victor line to be sold there, was also available in New Zealand (sedans only; wagons were rare imports) with the larger Cresta PC&#x27;s 3294 cc engine, badged as the Victor 3300, later 3300SL. These were manufactured with a choice of 4-speed manual gearbox or a 2-stage GM Powerglide automatic and most, apart from early cars, had the Ventora&#x27;s grille. The new three speed GM Automatic (aka Holden Trimatic) gearbox was available for the update 1970 2.0 and 3.3 models. Bench (earlier 1.6 models with three-speed manual column shift only) or bucket front seats were available.

A one-off Ventora was the Black Prince. This high-profile modified car used components leftover after Gordon-Keeble went bust in the 1960s and was built in 1971, based on a modified Victor FD. The car featured a 5.4-litre V8 Chevrolet engine, ZF 5-speed gearbox and a limited-slip differential. Special features included a Sony 4-band radio that could be removed from the dashboard and used as a portable radio, auxiliary dials, Lucas Square 8 fog lights, matt black bonnet stripe, dash-mounted ice detector and map lights. The car was offered for sale in 1972 for approximately £3000, and was broken up in the late 1980s, with the owner using the running gear in a kit car. However, it is now known that one of the two cars built still exists in reasonable condition, but without the original engine/transmission, as it has been offered for sale in recent years. In reality, this car was merely a project to utilize the parts received from the administrators of the bankrupt Gordon-Keeble Car Co.

A 1972 Victor purchased at £60 and called Red Victor 2, has been heavily modified with around 2,000 hp to go 0-60mph in 1 second while still being street legal.

The earliest known surviving original FD series Victor 2000 is LRU 802F, a January 1968 registered car in Oyster Grey with a Casino Red interior. Known affectionately by The FD Register as &#x27;Tom&#x27; after its first owner.

One earlier example in red survives which is extensively modified.

==FE Series Victor, VX4/90, Ventora, VX1800 and VX2300==

The last of the Victors, launched in March 1972, was the FE. Magazine and newspaper advertisements used the marketing slogan, &quot;NEW VICTOR - The transcontinentals&quot;. The car appeared substantially larger than its predecessor, but was actually no wider and only 2 inches (5 cm) longer with much of the extra length accounted for by larger bumpers. Nevertheless, a higher cabin and improved packaging enabled the manufacturer to boast of more leg room in the front and no less than of extra leg room in the back, with virtually no loss of boot/trunk capacity. Useful increases in headroom and shoulder-level cabin width were also achieved through the use of differently shaped side panels and windows. The Victor Deluxes originally had a bench seat in front; this was replaced with bucket seats for 1973 and the parking brake was moved to its conventional position on the floor between them.

Most UK cars in this class featured manual transmission and with the FE Vauxhall belatedly fell into line with their principal UK competitor by including a four-speed gearbox – available only at extra cost on the old Victor FD – as standard equipment. The FE&#x27;s extra weight presumably made this development irresistible. The four-speed transmission used the same box and ratios across the range, from the 1759 cc Victor to the torquey 3294 cc Ventora-badged version: contemporary road tests of the four-cylinder cars comment adversely on the wide gap – highlighted on the mountain roads included in the Portuguese route chosen for the car&#x27;s press launch – between second and third gears.
Although the architecture of the suspension remained as before, numerous detailed modifications were made to counter criticism of the old model. Changes included an anti-roll bar as standard equipment on all but the entry-level models, and stiffer springs at the back, intended to compensate for the Victor&#x27;s tendency to understeer. At the front the springing remained soft by the standards of the time: the track was widened (by 1.7 inches / 4 cm) and wheel geometry modified to incorporate &quot;anti-dive action&quot;, improvements intended to address the Victor&#x27;s tendency to wallow, which by then was attracting criticism from performance-oriented commentators.

The new Victor shared its floorpan and its basic bodyshell architecture with the Opel Rekord D (therefore the two cars look superficially similar) but all of the exterior panels were unique to the Victor and thus not interchangeable with the Rekord. The car used Vauxhall powertrains, along its own suspension and rack-and-pinion steering as opposed to the Rekord&#x27;s recirculating ball unit. The front end incorporated the then advanced detail of having the slim bumper bisect the grille, with a third of the grille and the side-lights (on quad headlamp models) below the bumper line.

Comparisons between the Victor and the Opel Rekord D were inevitable. An important difference from the back seat involved the rear doors. The Opel&#x27;s door incorporated rear quarter lights and windows that wound fully down into the door whereas Vauxhall&#x27;s designers preferred the &quot;cleaner uncluttered look&quot; arising from their elimination of rear quarter lights. The fact that back seat passengers could only open their windows down to approximately a third of their depth before further opening was blocked by the presence of the wheel arches was held out as a safety feature to complement the fitting of child-proof locks, given that back-seat passengers would no doubt include small children. Despite the absence of shared body panels anywhere that they could be seen, detailed investigation disclosed that minor assemblies such as the door locks and the wiper mechanisms were shared with the Opel Rekord D.

The FE Victor was the last Vauxhall to be designed independently of Opel. The engines were carried over from the FD range although enlarged to 1759 cc and 2279 cc. For a short period, the straight-six engine was used in the Ventora and 3300 SL models, the latter effectively a Victor Estate with lesser trim than the luxury Ventora. In spite of the heavy engine the 3300 SL Estate did not originally have power steering, this only arrived for the 1973 model year. The estates had a more sloping rear, similar to a hatchback, than the Rekord equivalent. The four-cylinder FE estate in fact had perfect 50/50 weight distribution. For the 1974 model year, the Victor underwent a light facelift with some interior modifications as well.

1974 finally saw the introduction of a proper Ventora Estate, along with running changes for the rest of the range. For some markets there was also a smaller 2.8-litre version of the big six available in the Ventora and Victor 3300 SL Estate; with more weight and less power than the four-cylinder, as well as higher fuel consumption, the extra cost was hard to justify and it soon disappeared from price lists along with the Ventora 3.3-litre.

World energy crises, falling exports and an increasingly muddled image led to Vauxhall&#x27;s decline during the early 1970s, such that sales of the FE slumped to 55,000 units before it was transformed to the VX series in January 1976.
===VX Series===

At the start of 1976 the relatively large 1800 cc Vauxhall Victor came with a recommended sticker price lower than that of the more modern but smaller and relatively well equipped Vauxhall Cavalier GL, which will have encouraged fleet managers to negotiate for higher discounts on the Cavalier and left the basic Victor looking embarrassingly underpriced. To try to move the Victor upmarket, Vauxhall upgraded the trim level of the basic Victor 1800 cc to match that of the 2300 cc version, with improvements that included fabric seat trim, a new clarified instrument display embellished with mock timber surround as well as a new central console. and a seat belt warning light across the range. Under the bonnet / hood various upgrades were made to the 1800 cc engine which now offered of output in place of the previously claimed. The changes carried a weight penalty, but performance was nevertheless usefully improved with top speed up from 89 mph (143 km/h) to 100 mph (161 km/h). To draw attention to the changes Vauxhall also dropped the Victor and VX 4/90 model names and the range was renamed the Vauxhall VX in January 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAM77/78&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The VX Series is distinguished from the outside by a simplified grille and revised headlights.
Since the demise of the Vauxhall Cresta more than three years earlier, only the Ventora had used the old Vauxhall six-cylinder engine: but now the four-cylinder VX 2300 GLS replaced the six-cylinder FE Ventora as Vauxhall&#x27;s flagship. The VX2300 GLS was fitted with four square halogen headlamps, velour upholstery, tinted glass and power steering.

The more sporting VX 4/90 was reintroduced, now based on the VX (formerly Victor FE), in March 1977 with a 5-speed close-ratio Getrag gearbox with dog-leg first gear (also featured in the VX 2300 GLS model), initially for mainland European export markets only. The car featured a modified, twin-carburettor version of the existing 2279 cc four-cylinder engine for which an output of was claimed, up from in the VX 2300, and a prototype fuel-injected variant was tested but not put into production. The car was fitted with twin halogen headlights and supplementary front fog-lights fitted beneath the front bumper, and also benefitted from extra sound-deadening materials to reduce road noise. The side window frames were fashionably blackened, and only four exterior colours could be specified, of which three were metallic. The manufacturer stated that the UK market would receive right-hand-drive versions of this latest incarnation of the VX 4/90 only in 1978. In 1978 the Vauxhall Carlton was released as a direct replacement for the VX1800/2300, production of which ended in the same year. The Carlton was based on the corresponding Opel Rekord E, and unlike the Victor FE/VX, was much closer in its engineering and body structure to its Opel sister - continuing the process of &quot;Opelisation&quot; of the Vauxhall range that had begun some years earlier. 
==Product variants==
The VX four-ninety was announced as a performance oriented version of the FB Victor in October 1961. During the FB series, the name changed slightly to VX 4/90 which continued to be used until the end of the FE range although the final VX 1978 incarnation carried badges which read VX490. The VX Four Ninety designation originally came from its engineering designation - Vauxhall eXperimental four-cylinder engine of 90 in³ capacity. As well as performance increasing modifications, VX 4/90s also had a number of exterior and interior modifications to distinguish them from Victors.

The Ventora, was introduced to the FD series sold between 1968 until it was dropped from the FE series in 1976. This used the Victor bodyshell, but had the Bedford-derived 3294 cc straight-six engine from the larger Cresta models. Again, the Ventora was distinguished from the Victor by improved trim levels and a more regal grille. The Ventora was effectively replaced as Vauxhall&#x27;s flagship executive saloon by the Opel-designed Senator/Royale model in 1978.

==Victor specials==

===Big Bertha===
A special version of the FE was the one-off 1974 Repco Holden-engined Ventora, nicknamed &quot;Big Bertha&quot;, built to compete in the &quot;Super Saloon&quot; category of British motor sport. Driven by Gerry Marshall, this car was fitted with a race-tuned 5.0 L V8 Repco Holden engine and bore little resemblance to the production car, except in its overall appearance. However the design was ill-fated, and suffered a crash in its sixth race. It was considered too big and too heavy, and had handling problems. Eventually it was decided to build a new, much smaller car around the same engine and chassis (much shortened) and this car was given the silhouette of the &quot;droopsnoot&quot; Firenza. Nicknamed &quot;Baby Bertha&quot;, this car was more successful and went on to dominate the category until Vauxhall moved from racing into rallying in 1977.

<text>Michael David d&#x27;Abo (born 1 March 1944) is an English singer and songwriter, best known as the lead vocalist of Manfred Mann from 1966 to their dissolution in 1969, and as the composer of the songs &quot;Handbags and Gladrags&quot; and &quot;Build Me Up Buttercup&quot;, the latter of which was a hit for The Foundations. With Manfred Mann, d&#x27;Abo achieved six top twenty hits on the UK Singles Chart including &quot;Semi-Detached, Suburban Mr. James&quot;, &quot;Ha! Ha! Said the Clown&quot; and the chart topper &quot;Mighty Quinn&quot;. He is the father to actress Olivia d&#x27;Abo.

==Early years==
D&#x27;Abo was born in Betchworth, Surrey, the son of Dorothy Primrose (née Harbord) and Edward Nassau Nicolai d&#x27;Abo, a London stockbroker. His d&#x27;Abo heritage is via the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies; his maternal line includes Edward Harbord, 3rd Baron Suffield (1781–1835). He was educated at Wellesley House Prep School in Kent, then at Harrow School and Selwyn College, Cambridge. He is , and has eyes &quot;that honestly seem to change from blue to brown to green, depending on the light&quot; according to Journalist Pete Goodman. D&#x27;Abo&#x27;s original intention at Cambridge was to read theology and become a priest but, faced with &quot;everything to learn&quot; (not least Classical Greek and Hebrew), and a disconnect between the &quot;strange, impractical philosophy&quot; he was being taught and his idealism about &quot;bringing comfort to people&quot; and spreading &quot;understanding in the world,&quot; he &quot;became wholly disillusioned&quot; (&quot;Rave&quot;, November 1966). He switched to economics, also unsuccessfully, and left Cambridge with &quot;a first class jazz collection&quot; but without completing his studies.

== Career ==

=== A Band of Angels ===
His musical career began while he was still at Harrow School. He had minor success with a group of Old Harrovians, A Band of Angels, that had their own comic strip in a UK pop music weekly, &quot;Fab 208&quot;. A Band of Angels did not make the big time and d&#x27;Abo later reflected on what had gone wrong for them: &quot;We weren&#x27;t right for each other. We weren&#x27;t a group. They didn&#x27;t want me to be too outstanding, a thing that happens naturally in most groups... Also we looked old-fashioned when we started. I knew I looked wrong but I didn&#x27;t want to change, I looked like me and what I am. It is just lucky that fashion now agrees with me&quot; (&quot;Rave&quot;, November 1966).

=== Manfred Mann ===
In July 1966, after leaving A Band of Angels, D’Abo joined Manfred Mann, an established chart-topping group, as a replacement for lead singer Paul Jones, who was leaving to start a solo career. Comparisons between d&#x27;Abo and Jones (whom d&#x27;Abo physically resembled) became a media preoccupation at the time of the switch, but d&#x27;Abo wasted little time dwelling upon it. &quot;I enjoy being with the group,&quot; he told Pete Goodman. &quot;We really do have an enormously wide range of musical tastes among us.&quot;

D&#x27;Abo&#x27;s first big hit with Manfred Mann was &quot;Semi-Detached Suburban Mr James&quot;. It was nearly recorded with &quot;Mr Jones&quot; in the title before it occurred to the group that it might be interpreted as a reference to Paul Jones. D&#x27;Abo then helped record Manfred Mann&#x27;s &quot;As Is&quot; album (with the attaching single of the Bob Dylan-penned &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;). All of the UK Fontana and US Mercury releases featured d&#x27;Abo.

He composed and produced Chris Farlowe&#x27;s &quot;Handbags and Gladrags&quot;, a hit single (which was also notably recorded by Rod Stewart and Stereophonics and subsequently became the theme music to the BBC television show &quot;The Office&quot;) and &quot;The Last Goodbye&quot;. He also wrote two songs recorded by Rod Stewart on Immediate Records: &quot;Little Miss Understood&quot; and &quot;So Much to Say (So Little Time)&quot;. With d&#x27;Abo fronting, Manfred Mann enjoyed numerous hits, including &quot;Ragamuffin Man&quot;, &quot;Ha! Ha! Said the Clown&quot;, &quot;My Name is Jack&quot; and the Dylan-penned number one hit, &quot;Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)&quot;, which they retitled simply &quot;Mighty Quinn&quot;. Manfred Mann subsequently disbanded in 1969.

=== After Manfred Mann ===
In 1968, he and Tony Macaulay co-wrote &quot;Build Me Up Buttercup&quot;, which was recorded by The Foundations and sold over four million copies by April 1969, including one million discs in the United States.

In December 1968, d&#x27;Abo played the lead in &quot;Gulliver Travels&quot; (subtly, not &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;) at the Mermaid Theatre, Blackfriars, London and he also portrayed Herod on the original recording of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. He had a short role on the original recording of &quot;Evita&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Loving Cup&quot; for The Fortunes and &quot;Mary, Won&#x27;t You Warm My Bed&quot; for Colin Blunstone. In 1970, he composed and performed the music for the Peter Sellers film &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Soup&quot;, and played John Lennon in &quot;No One was Saved&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre Schools scheme. D&#x27;Abo also worked with Mike Smith, the former keyboard player of the Dave Clark Five. In 1976, they released an album on the CBS (UK) label, &quot;Smith &amp; d&#x27;Abo&quot;.

=== Radio ===
In 1997, d&#x27;Abo presented a programme on BBC Radio Bristol, &quot;The Golden Years&quot;, playing music from the 1950s onwards; it broadcast on Saturdays on BBC Radio Gloucestershire. BBC Wiltshire Sound subsequently added the programme to their schedules.

During the 1990s, he also presented &quot;Late Night West&quot;, a popular weeknightly programme on west-of-England local radio for five nights a week, that included music, competitions, and a listener phone-in. In the late 1990s, he contributed to &quot;The Mike d&#x27;Abo Story&quot;, a documentary written by Geoff Leonard, narrated and produced by Phil Vowels, and broadcast on BBC Radio Bristol and BBC Radio Gloucestershire.

He also presented a number of programmes on BBC Radio 2 in 1986 and 1987.
=== The Manfreds ===
The original members of Manfred Mann, minus keyboard player Mann, reformed in 1991 to celebrate guitarist Tom McGuinness&#x27;s 50th birthday, and to promote a Manfred Mann compilation released around the same time. The absence of Mann forced them to adopt a different name.

Like Rob Townsend and Mike Hugg, d&#x27;Abo has also halted tours within recent years. According to the Manfreds website: &quot;Nowadays, Mike d’Abo will only appear on a select few Manfreds date&quot;.

==Family==
D&#x27;abo has been married three times. His first marriage was to model Maggie London in 1967. They had two children: Ben d&#x27;Abo (born 1967) and Olivia d&#x27;Abo (born 1969). His second wife was Karen and they had one son, Bruno d&#x27;Abo. His third marriage was to Lisa Weaver in 1996, which produced twins Ella and Louis in July 2007. He is a first cousin of actress Maryam d&#x27;Abo. His sister Carol is widow of the late Conservative MP and minister Sir Nicholas Baker.

<doc id="1324045" wikidata="Q4162524" url="?curid=1324045" title="Fremont Union High School District">
<text>Fremont Union High School District (abbreviated FUHSD) is a school district in Silicon Valley, California. It serves the communities of Cupertino, Sunnyvale, San Jose, Los Altos, Saratoga, and Santa Clara.

==History==
Founded in 1923 as the West Side Union High School District, the district served the agricultural Fremont Township in the West Valley region, and still serves the regions covered by the former Township today. It originally had only one school (called West Side Union High School), which operated in a few rooms of the Sunnyvale Grammar School building, before relocating to the intersection of Fremont Avenue and Highway 9 (now Sunnyvale-Saratoga Road). Two years later, in 1925, the district received its present name and its only school was renamed &quot;Fremont High School&quot;.

With the rise of suburban growth, which swallowed up the West Valley area in the 1950s and 1960s, the district established five more high schools: Sunnyvale High School (1956), Cupertino High School (1958), Homestead High School (1962), Lynbrook High School (1965), and Monta Vista High School (1969). Due to declining enrollment, Sunnyvale High School was shut down in 1981, with its campus being leased to the King&#x27;s Academy.

==Schools==
There are five high schools in FUHSD, as well as a community day school:

=== Cupertino High School ===
Cupertino High School, colloquially referred to as &quot;Tino,&quot; is a public high school located near the Rancho Rinconada and Fairgrove neighborhoods of Cupertino, California. The school serves mostly suburban residential and areas in eastern Cupertino, southern Santa Clara, and western San Jose.

The 2022-23 school year had 1,997 students in attendance. The student population was 51% male and 49% female. Its racial makeup was 69% Asian, 9% White, 9% Hispanic, 7% Two or More Races, and 1% Black.

The school&#x27;s land was purchased from prune farmers in 1956 for $96,000, and the school was opened on September 15, 1958. The school was honored as a California Distinguished School in 1990, 1994 and 2007, and as a Blue Ribbon School in 1994–96.

=== Fremont High School ===

Fremont High School is a public high school in Sunnyvale, California. Fremont is currently the only open public high school located in the city of Sunnyvale, and is the oldest school in the district.

The 2022-23 school year had 2,171 students in attendance. The student population was 52% male and 48% female. Its racial makeup was 43% Hispanic, 23% Asian, 16% White, 6% Two or More Races, 1% Black and 1% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.

The school was founded in 1923. The mascot used to be the Indian, but it was changed to the firebird in 1996. The school was honored as a California Distinguished School in 1996.

=== Homestead High School ===

Homestead High School is a public high school serving western Sunnyvale, southern Los Altos, and northwestern Cupertino, in Santa Clara County, California.

The 2022-23 school year had 2,311 students in attendance. The student population was 51% male and 49% female. Its racial makeup was 41% Asian, 23% White, 20% Hispanic, 9% Two or More Races and 1% Black.

The school was established in 1962. In 2003 and 2009, the California Department of Education recognized Homestead as a California Distinguished School, and in 2004, the Department of Education recognized Homestead as a Blue Ribbon School.

=== Lynbrook High School ===

Lynbrook High School is a public high school located in the West San Jose neighborhood of San Jose, California. It was founded in 1965. The class of 1968 was the first to graduate.

The 2022-23 school year had 1,741 students in attendance. The student population was 53% male and 47% female. Its racial makeup was 84% Asian, 7% White, 5% Two or More Races and 4% Hispanic.

The school was honored as a California Distinguished School in 1990, 1994, 1999 and 2007, and as a Blue Ribbon School in 2008.

=== Monta Vista High School ===

Monta Vista High School is a public high school in Cupertino, California. It was founded in 1969.

The 2022-23 school year had 1,751 students in attendance. The student population was 49% male and 51% female. Its racial makeup was 77% Asian, 8% White, 6% Two or More Races and 4% Hispanic.

The school was honored as a California Distinguished School in 1988, 1990, 1996, 2003 and 2007, and as a Blue Ribbon School in 1997–98, 2008 and 2014.

== Student enrollment ==
During the 2013-14 school year, there were 10,667 students in Fremont Union High School District. In terms of race and ethnicity, the district is predominantly Asian American. European American students make up a large minority. Hispanic and Latino students are also a sizable minority. In contrast, African American students are not very numerous. During the 2007 school year, Asian American students made up 53.3% of the school district&#x27;s student population. European American students made up 32.7% of the student population; Hispanics and Latinos made up 11.7% of the population. African American and American Indian students made up 2.0% and 0.4% of the population respectively.

Because the school district has recently faced a substantial budget deficit, it is now only enrolling residents who live within the district&#x27;s boundaries. In the past, many students who did not live within the district were allowed to attend Fremont Union High School District&#x27;s schools, but now the district is closely investigating all student residences. These investigations sometimes involve going into a student&#x27;s alleged home, where a specially-trained district employee searches the home—including the student&#x27;s bedroom—for signs that the student actually lives in the home. Video of two such inspections aired in a 2006 segment of the ABC News program 20/20. The narrator, John Stossel, was showing how the excellent reputation of Fremont Union&#x27;s schools motivates parents to lie about their child&#x27;s actual home. As explained on the 20/20 program, if the student is found to be from an outside area, he or she may be expelled from school. Sometimes this policy has caused controversy among parents and teachers, but the district must maintain this policy in order to keep class sizes low.

== CAHSEE performance ==

The California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE) is administered to every sophomore enrolled . Students must pass the test in order to receive a high school diploma. According to the California Department of Education in 2008, 93% of sophomores enrolled in the Fremont Union High School District passed the English-Language Arts portion of the test . According to the California Department of Education in 2008, 95% of sophomores enrolled in FUHSD passed the mathematics portion of the test. 

==Technology==
The Fremont Union High School District runs a fairly advanced technological system, including its own website servers, IP addresses, VoIP Infrastructure, and library catalog. Schoology is the school district&#x27;s primary means of communicating to students via the Internet.

<text>Juan F. Acosta (May 27, 1890 – 1968) was a Puerto Rican composer and music teacher.

==Early years==
Acosta, who came from a numerous family, was born and educated in the town of San Sebastián, Puerto Rico located on the western part of Puerto Rico. His parents, realized that their son was gifted with musical talent, enrolled him at a young age to take music classes. He was under the tutorship of Jesus Fiqueroa (1878–1971), an accomplished composer himself, who taught him how to play various musical instruments, among them the clarinet and the euphonium. By 1900, when Acosta was only 10 years old, he was able to prepare the musical arrangements for the orchestras directed by Fiqueroa. In 1906, when he was 16 years old, Acosta was approached by the director of the San Sebastian Municipal Band, Ángel Mislan (1862–1911) who took him under his wing. Mislan taught Acosta the art of musical composition and harmony. Every town had a Band which played in the town&#x27;s square. The position of Band director was considered a very important one and when Mislan left San Sebastian, he recommended that Acosta be his successor.

==First composition==

Acosta had a girlfriend called Carmela who in turn had another friend by the same name. Before moving from San Sebastian, in 1909, at the age of 19, he wrote his first danza titled &quot;Las Carmelas&quot;, inspired by the girls. He moved to the town of Adjuntas where he organized its municipal band and various school bands. It is also where he met his future wife, Ramonita Nieves.

Acosta&#x27;s artistic talent was soon solicited in other parts of Puerto Rico and he found himself working and visiting other towns. One of his students was a young man by the name of Rafael Alers, who in the future would also become a distinguished musician himself. He visited over 37 towns, where he instructed teachers in music and helped develop the educational music system of their schools.

On July 7, 1936, Acosta was resting under a pine tree in the plaza of the town of Hatillo, which inspired him to write one of his greatest compositions, the danza &quot;Bajo La Sombra de un Pino&quot; (Under the Shade of a Pine). Among Acosta&#x27;s many compositions are &quot;Asi es la Vida&quot; (That&#x27;s Life); and &quot;Glorias del Pasado&quot; (Glories of the Past). Acosta wrote over 844 musical pieces, including 127 hymns.

==Later years==
Juan F. Acosta died in 1968 and is buried in Quebradillas. According to his wishes, his family planted a pine tree by his grave. Over 300 of Acosta&#x27;s musical compositions are safeguarded in the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. In the 1960s, the Institute made a recording of 12 of Acosta&#x27;s greatest compositions, interpreted in piano by Elsa Rivera Salgado (1908–1998).

<text>Political egalitarianism describes an inclusive and fair allocation of political power or influence, fair processes, and fair treatment of all regardless of characteristics like race, gender, religion, age, wealth or intelligence. Political egalitarianism, and its close cousin political equality, are key founding principles and sources of legitimacy for many democracies. Related principles include one person, one vote and equality before the law. 

== Discussion ==

=== Egalitarianism ===
Egalitarianism denotes the belief that all people are of equal fundamental worth and should have equal status. Egalitarians tend to focus more on process and treating people as social equals than on the raw distribution of power.

=== Political equality ===
Political equality is only achieved when the norms, rules and procedures that govern the community afford equal consideration to all. Robert Dahl believes that the ideal of democracy assumes that political equality is desirable. He goes on to argue that political equality and democracy are supported by the inherent intrinsic equal worth of every person (intrinsic equality) and the tendency of concentrated power to corrupt.

=== Equality before the law ===

Equality before law means that the law applies to all peoples equally and without exceptions. For example, the freedom of speech should apply the same to all members of a society. Laws can sometimes be designed to help minimize unequal application. Well-designed constitutions, for example, can help protect political rights in functioning democracies.

<text>The Polynesian Cultural Center (PCC) is a family-centered cultural tourist attraction and living museum in Laie on the northern shore of Oahu, Hawaii. The PCC is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), was dedicated on October 12, 1963, and occupies of land belonging to nearby Brigham Young University–Hawaii (BYU-Hawaii).

The PCC encompasses eight simulated tropical villages where performers demonstrate various arts and crafts from throughout Polynesia. Visitors may also take a free shuttle tour of the university and see the LDS Church&#x27;s Laie Hawaii Temple and its associated visitors&#x27; center.

Seventy percent of the PCC&#x27;s approximately 1,300 employees are students at BYU-Hawaii. Since opening, the PCC has provided financial assistance to more than 12,000 BYU-Hawaii students. Students may work up to 20 hours per week during school terms and 40 hours during breaks. As a non-profit organization, PCC&#x27;s revenue is used for daily operations and to support education.

==History==
In early 1962, LDS Church president David O. McKay authorized the construction of the nonprofit center to provide employment and scholarships for students at BYU-Hawaii and to preserve Polynesia&#x27;s culture. It has its roots in the 1940s and 1950s when hukilau and luau beach gatherings were held to earn money to rebuild a local chapel belonging to the LDS Church, which had been destroyed in a fire. &quot;The Hukilau Song,&quot; made famous by Alfred Apaka, was written following the composer and song&#x27;s original singer, Jack Owens, visit to Lāi.e.&#x27;s hukilau. In October 1980, Guangdong Party&#x27;s first secretary, Xi Zhongxun, father of current Chinese leader Xi Jinping, visited the PCC during a tour of the United States. After the September 11 attacks, attendance suffered at the PCC. In 2004, the PCC doubled its advertising budget, &quot;to promote local music, dance and food festivals.&quot;

The PCC is one of the most frequently visited destinations for tourism in Hawaii, attracting 700,000 visitors annually. The PCC is the venue for the annual World Fire Knife Dance Competition, where contestants display their skills with blazing swords. Since its opening in 1963, over 32 million people have visited the center. Howard W. Hunter is credited with transforming the newly organized PCC from an unprofitable and unknown entity into one of Hawaii&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions.

==Activities==
===&quot;Hā–Breath of Life&quot;===
In addition to the daytime exhibits and demonstrations, PCC features an evening show for an additional charge. As of 2009, the show is a multicultural Polynesian show titled &quot;Hā–Breath of Life,&quot; which The New York Times described as &quot;a vivid, energetic production that highlights song and dance from the indigenous cultures of the South Pacific.&quot; The show features songs and dances throughout Polynesia, including the hula, tamure, otea, titi torea, haka, poi, meke, tauʻolunga, and Taualuga. Past shows include &quot;This is Polynesia&quot;, &quot;Mana: The Spirit of Our People.&quot;, and &quot;Horizons: Where the Sea Meets the Sky&quot;. The show reportedly has a cast of 100 performers, and they perform six evenings a week.

===&quot;Huki: A Canoe Celebration&quot;===
The Lagoon hosts a parade of canoes that showcase the signature dances of each Polynesian culture. The current show, &quot;Huki: A Canoe Celebration&quot;, which premiered in August 2018, was preceded by &quot;Rainbows of Paradise&quot;, &quot;This is Polynesia,&quot; and &quot;Ancient Legends of Polynesia&quot;.

===Villages===
Each major of Polynesian culture has its section centered on a traditional village. Hourly performances and cultural learning experiences take place in these villages. Villages include: 

*Hawaii
*Samoa
*Aotearoa (New Zealand)
*Fiji
*Tahiti
*Tonga

In addition to the villages, the PCC has a special exhibit dedicated to Rapa Nui (Easter Island or Isla de Pascua) and a tribute to the 1850s LDS mission. Visitors may participate in a luau, such as the Alii Luau (&quot;Royal Feast&quot;), which offers traditional Polynesian fare, including pork cooked in an imu (an underground oven). They can observe the roasted pig in the imu prior to the meal. The PCC has its own Special effect theater and a lagoon where visitors can take canoe rides accompanied by a guide or paddle by themselves.

==Special events==
PCC hosts many special events, highlighting Hawaiian, Samoan, Tahitian, and Māori cultures and a Christmas festival. The PCC used to host a Haunted Lagoon but discontinued it in 2013 because it was not profitable. Other festivals include the Moanikeala Hula Festival, the World Fireknife Championships, and the Micronesia Betelnut Festival.

<text>Tsutsui no Jōmyō Meishū (筒井浄妙明秀) was a warrior monk (&quot;sōhei&quot;) from Mii-dera who fought alongside Minamoto no Yorimasa and his fellow monks at the Battle of Uji in 1180, defending the Byōdō-in and Prince Mochihito from the Taira clan.

Later, in the same account, Gochi-in no Tajima is replaced on the bridge by his comrade, Tsutsui. Standing upon the broken bridge of Uji, Kyoto, Tsutsui fought off the Taira samurai with bow and arrow, &quot;naginata&quot;, sword, and dagger.

<text>Shana Frances Swash (born 16 July 1990) is a British actress from London, and the sister of actor and television presenter Joe Swash. She is best known for playing Demi Miller in the long-running BBC One soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; from 2004 to 2006.

==Acting==
In February 2006, it was announced that the role of Demi was to be cut, along with that of her on-screen mother Rosie. Despite an online petition from fans pleading for them not to be axed, both characters left the show in July of that year.

Swash played Princess Jasmine in a pantomime version of &quot;Aladdin&quot; in the Winter of 1999, and appeared in BBC sitcom &quot;After You&#x27;ve Gone&quot; in an episode entitled &quot;Silence of the Clams&quot;.

Swash also starred in the 2007 UK tour of &quot;Girls Night&quot;, and in one of a series of educational videos produced by Orange, in which she played a girl who uses social networking sites inadvisedly.

Swash appeared in the short film &quot;The Crime Wave&quot;, and was one of the hairdressers in the 2008 series of &quot;Celebrity Scissorhands&quot;, a reality series which helped to raise money for Children In Need.

On 23 December 2008, Swash starred in an episode of the BBC Scotland soap opera &quot;River City&quot;, in a dream sequence as the daughter of Shona Malone.

In May 2009, Swash performed in &quot;Proud&quot;, a play at the Above The Stag Theatre.

Swash also featured in the 2016 film &quot;My Feral Heart&quot; playing the part of a young carer at a care home for adults with learning difficulties - a part for which she received a nomination for the BIFA for Best Supporting Actress.

Swash&#x27;s latest on-screen role was on 21 September 2018. She appeared in an episode of daytime BBC drama series &quot;Doctors&quot;, entitled &quot;The Black Widow&quot;, where she played a carer called Juliet Radnor, who was accused of killing her client in order to gain an inheritance.

==Personal life==
Swash was born in Camden, London.
In August 2021 she announced her engagement to Nick Jones via her Instagram page.

In December 2023, Swash and Jones welcomed their first child together; a daughter named Kitty Frances Swash-Jones.

<doc id="1324083" wikidata="Q3848351" url="?curid=1324083" title="Tetsubin">
<text>are Japanese cast-iron kettles with a pouring spout, a lid, and a handle crossing over the top, used for boiling and pouring hot water for drinking purposes, such as for making tea.

&quot;Tetsubin&quot; are traditionally heated over charcoal. In the Japanese art of &quot;chanoyu&quot;, the special portable brazier for this is the . (See list of Japanese tea ceremony equipment).
&quot;Tetsubin&quot; are often elaborately decorated with relief designs on the outside. They range widely in size, and many have unusual shapes, making them popular with collectors. A relatively small &quot;tetsubin&quot; may hold around 0.5 litres of water; large ones may hold around 5 litres.

The historical origin of the &quot;tetsubin&quot; is not certain. At least one authoritative Japanese source states that it developed from the spouted and handled water kettle called &quot;tedorigama&quot; that was already being used in &quot;chanoyu&quot; in the era of Sen no Rikyū (1522–1591). During the 19th century, infused tea became more popular and tetsubin were considered primarily status symbols rather than functional kitchen items.
Outside Japan, a frequently seen variant is a cast-iron teapot that outwardly resembles a &quot;tetsubin&quot;. This type of teapot is glazed with enamel on the inside to make it more practical for tea brewing, though it cannot be used to heat water because that would break the enamel coating. In the west, these teapots are commonly referred to as &quot;tetsubin&quot;, although the Japanese call them , or iron teapot, to make a distinction from the kettle. Cast-iron teapots often come with a tea strainer that fits inside.

The prefectures of Iwate and Yamagata are best known for producing &quot;tetsubin&quot; as well as iron teapots.

==History==
It is not clear when the first tetsubin kettles appeared in Japan, but one hypothesis is that the popularity of the tetsubin grew alongside sencha, a form of leaf tea. China introduced Japan to sencha around the middle of the 17th century. Sencha was not considered as formal as matcha, the common powdered green tea at the time. Throughout the 18th century, people started drinking sencha as an informal setting for sharing a cup of tea with friends or family. As more people drank sencha, the popularity of the tetsubin grew. The tetsubin is most probably not an original design, but rather shaped by other kettles around at the time. The five closest relatives to the tetsubin are the tedorikama, the toyama, the mizusosogi, the dobin, and the yakkan.

The yakkan is the closest relative to the tetsubin, the main difference is that the yakkan is made from copper, whereas tetsubins are traditionally made out of iron. Some people have wondered why the tetsubin was developed, when a perfectly usable vessel such as the yakkan would have worked. Tea drinkers may have preferred the taste of water from an iron kettle over the taste of water from a copper kettle. Throughout the 18th century, tetsubin kettles became a standard household utensil for heating water to make tea with. As the use of these kettles increased, so too did the intricacy. During the 19th century, tetsubin designs went from simple basic iron kettles, to elaborately engraved masterpieces.

<doc id="1324088" wikidata="Q8198020" url="?curid=1324088" title="Pikmin">
<text>is a real-time strategy and puzzle video game series created by Shigeru Miyamoto, and published by Nintendo. The games focus on directing a horde of plant-like creatures called Pikmin to collect items by destroying obstacles, avoiding hazards, and fighting fauna that are hazardous to both the player character and the Pikmin.

The &quot;Pikmin&quot; series features four main entries as well as two spin-offs. The first two, &quot;Pikmin&quot; (2001) and &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; (2004), were made and released for the GameCube and later ported to the Wii as &quot;New Play Control!&quot; titles in 2008 and 2009. &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; was re-released in the &quot;Nintendo Selects&quot; series in 2012. Both titles were remastered for the Nintendo Switch in 2023 as &quot;Pikmin 1+2&quot;. A third installment, &quot;Pikmin 3&quot;, was released for the Wii U in 2013. An enhanced port of &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; for the Nintendo Switch, &quot;Pikmin 3 Deluxe&quot;, was released in 2020. The series&#x27; first handheld game, &quot;Hey! Pikmin&quot;, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2017. &quot;Pikmin 4&quot; was released for the Nintendo Switch in 2023. &quot;Pikmin Bloom&quot;, the series&#x27; mobile spin-off, was released for iOS and Android in 2021. &quot;Pikmin Finder&quot;, an augmented reality browser-based mobile game, was released in 2023.

==Gameplay==
The series&#x27; gameplay combines elements of action platformer with puzzle and strategy gameplay. The &quot;Pikmin&quot; games focus on exploring an Earth-like planet named PNF-404, and controlling a crowd of the titular Pikmin. Pikmin are intelligent, loyal, multicolored, plant-animal hybrids that follow the orders of their leader. There have been multiple leaders throughout the series, with the first and most notable being Captain Olimar, a tiny alien from the planet Hocotate introduced in the original &quot;Pikmin&quot;. &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; features Louie and The President, Olimar&#x27;s co-worker and boss, respectively, who are also playable leaders. &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; features leaders from a new alien species. The leaders are Alph, Brittany, and Charlie, who come from the planet Koppai and are similar to the Hocotatians, but also possess some different features from them. &quot;Pikmin 4&quot; features a customizable character who is part of an interplanetary rescue team, assisted by Oatchi, a space dog with exclusive abilities.

Pikmin are directed to perform several tasks, with the primary one being the retrieval of items integral to the mission of each game. The player must direct the Pikmin to overcome obstacles and PNF-404&#x27;s fauna. Because individual Pikmin are small and weak against most predators, and some are best suited for certain tasks, it is the responsibility of the player to direct the Pikmin appropriately to ensure successful retrievals of any items, avoid any hazards, and quickly tend to any obstacles and predators. Game time is divided into individual days, each of which consists of approximately 13 minutes, in which the player is encouraged to accomplish as much as possible before sunset.

Pikmin appear in a variety of colors, which signify the Pikmin&#x27;s abilities and resistance to environmental hazards. The number of Pikmin and their abilities have shifted throughout the franchise, with the first &quot;Pikmin&quot; game featuring three colors: Red, Yellow, and Blue. Red Pikmin are immune to fire, Blue Pikmin can move through the water thanks to their gills, and Yellow Pikmin can be thrown higher than other Pikmin, and can carry bomb rocks. 
In &quot;Pikmin 2&quot;, Yellow Pikmin have lost their ability to carry bomb rocks in exchange for being immune to electrical hazards, and White and Purple Pikmin are introduced. White Pikmin are the fastest, resistant to poisonous gases, capable of poisoning enemies, and capable of spotting objects buried underground. In comparison, Purple Pikmin are significantly stronger and heavier than the other types, which makes them excellent at inflicting damage and carrying heavy items, due to their stunning shockwave.

&quot;Pikmin 3&quot; introduced two more types: the black-colored Rock Pikmin, and the pink-colored, bee inspired Winged Pikmin. Rock Pikmin can break crystalline materials and cannot be crushed or impaled. They inflict the most damage out of all Pikmin types when thrown. In comparison, Winged Pikmin can fly freely and can fly high which enables them to recover elevated items and attack airborne enemies with ease. Their aerial maneuverability makes it easier to transport things to the ship/Onion. In addition to making each type capable of carrying bomb rocks, &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; also adjusted the abilities of Yellow, Blue, White, and Purple Pikmin. Yellow Pikmin are tied with Rock Pikmin for the fastest digging speed; Blue Pikmin are capable of swimming; White Pikmin are tied with Winged Pikmin for the lowest attack strength, and slowest digging speed; Purple Pikmin are tied with Red Pikmin for second highest attack strength, and second fastest digging speed, while removing their stunning ability.

&quot;Pikmin 4&quot; introduced two other types: Ice Pikmin, which can work during the day like most Pikmin; and Glow Pikmin, which operate at night and can only be used at night as a first in the series. Ice Pikmin can freeze enemies and bodies of water, and are invulnerable to being frozen, at the cost of having low attack power. They can freeze enemies by attacking them enough, or by being eaten, similarly to White Pikmin. With the Offensive Method, Ice Pikmin trigger a sort of &quot;Freeze Meter&quot;, and if the ring fills, the enemy is frozen. But with the Sacrificial Method, the ring fills significantly upon death, like how the White Pikmin kill their attacker on death. They can float on bodies of water when the water isn&#x27;t frozen. Depending on the size of the body of water, you may need a whole party of Ice Pikmin to freeze it, leaving only the player and Oatchi left. Glow Pikmin are immune to all the elements of fire, water, electricity, and poison, and can stun enemies when a group is charged together. However, they cannot be used during the day, and require an item to be used to get them in cave areas. &quot;Pikmin 4&quot; readjusted the previous Pikmin types again. Bomb rocks are no longer carried by the Pikmin. Instead, they are items the player can acquire and use at their discretion. Rock Pikmin can now be crushed on hard surfaces, and when taking elemental damage. They also cannot dig fast like Yellow Pikmin, who dig even faster than ever before. Purple Pikmin&#x27;s attack strength is the same as in &quot;Pikmin 3&quot;, but their shockwave stun returns and gives them extra damage upon impact.

Outside of coloration, all types of Pikmin share the same method of indicating their strength and swiftness: the stalk atop their heads will sport either a leaf, bud or flower, which develops when Pikmin are fed nectar or left planted in the ground for a certain amount of time. By extension, all types of Pikmin are stored in their respective motherships, referred to as &quot;Onions&quot;, for safety after sunset, as they are vulnerable to nocturnal predators. The Onions play a vital role in Pikmin reproduction: when any food, such as prey or pellets, is delivered to an Onion, it propagates seeds, which grow and are plucked from the ground as fully developed Pikmin. An Onion serves as an incubator for all Pikmin of its respective color, housing the Pikmin. The Onions travel alongside Olimar as he flies to different locations on the planet.

==Plot==

=== Characters ===

==== Protagonists ====
The main protagonist of the series is Captain Olimar, an employee of the Hocotate Freight Company, who flies a rocket ship known as the S.S. Dolphin, a reference to the GameCube&#x27;s developmental code name. He has a wife, son and daughter. &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; introduces Louie, a co-worker of Olimar, who places the Hocotate Freight Company in debt after losing a shipment of gold &quot;Pikpik&quot; brand carrots to a &quot;ravenous space bunny&quot;. The names &quot;Olimar&quot; and &quot;Louie&quot; are based on Mario and Luigi, who were also created by Shigeru Miyamoto.

In &quot;Pikmin 3&quot;, three new characters succeed Olimar as playable leaders: Alph the engineer, Brittany the botanist, and Captain Charlie. All three characters come from Koppai, a planet whose inhabitants are similar to the Hocotatians, and they interact with each other through in-game dialogue. Though not playable during the game&#x27;s story, Olimar and Louie both appear later in the game&#x27;s story and become integral to its plot, are playable in Bingo Battle Mode and five of the downloadable mission levels, and Olimar&#x27;s expedition logs are later discovered by the crew and offer helpful advice regarding PNF-404. Olimar and Louie are playable in the Olimar&#x27;s Comeback side story missions unique to &quot;Pikmin 3 Deluxe&quot;.

In &quot;Pikmin 4&quot;, the main character is customizable by the player, and works as a rookie member of the Rescue Corps organization. They are tasked with rescuing the other Rescue Corps members, as well as Olimar. This player character is one of two playable characters in the main story, along with the Rescue Corps&#x27; dog Oatchi. Though not playable during the game&#x27;s story, Olimar and Louie both appear later in the game&#x27;s story and become integral to its plot, with Louie appearing in a more antagonistic role. While not playable in the main story, Olimar is playable in the Olimar&#x27;s Shipwreck Tale side story.

==== Pikmin creatures ====
After becoming stranded on the unknown planet in &quot;Pikmin&quot;, Olimar becomes acquainted with the species of plant-like beings that he names &quot;Pikmin&quot; because they resemble the &quot;Pikpik&quot; brand of carrots on his home planet of Hocotate. They are small, brightly colored creatures who are each as tall as a US dime. They follow any command: from attacking enemies and defending Olimar to retrieving large artifacts. Pikmin are generally very weak unless they are used in hordes, as the Pikmin are excellent at working together. Pikmin speak with strange, squeaking noises. Simple commands can, however, be communicated to them by the use of a whistle or any other device capable of producing high-pitched noises.

Pikmin come in several colors, each with strengths and weaknesses. In &quot;Pikmin&quot;, there are three types of Pikmin: Red Pikmin, who are better in combat and can withstand extreme heat and fire; Yellow Pikmin, who can be thrown higher, can use bomb rocks (&quot;Pikmin&quot; and &quot;Pikmin 3&quot;, although all Pikmin types are capable of using bomb rocks in this game), are immune to electricity (&quot;Pikmin 2&quot; onward), and can dig faster (&quot;Pikmin 3&quot; onward); and Blue Pikmin, which have gills and can walk in water (or get splashed with water-based attacks) without drowning. There are also Mushroom Pikmin who attack the other types of Pikmin. They are created when regular Pikmin are infected by spores let out by the Puffstool.

In &quot;Pikmin 2&quot;, three new species of Pikmin were introduced: Purple Pikmin, White Pikmin, and Bulbmin. Purple Pikmin move slower than normal Pikmin, but have ten times the strength and weight of other Pikmin, giving them the ability to pick up much heavier objects and attack and destroy obstacles and other enemies with fewer numbers. They also have the potential to stun enemies when they land near or on them. White Pikmin, when ingested by enemies, damage the enemy by being toxic. White Pikmin themselves are immune to poison, can locate buried treasure with their special eyes, and can run faster than other Pikmin. Bulbmin are a subterranean parasitic species of Pikmin that infect Bulborbs (the most common enemy found within the &quot;Pikmin&quot; series) and take control of them. These Pikmin are found exclusively within certain cave systems in the game, usually as a pack of up to 10 juvenile Bulbmin and a single adult Bulbmin. While the adult forms of these Pikmin are hostile towards Olimar, the juvenile Bulbmin will follow Olimar like regular Pikmin once the adult is killed. They are immune to most hazards (save explosions, being eaten, being crushed, and bottomless pits), and will not follow Olimar when he leaves the cave they are found in. The only way to &quot;keep&quot; them is if they are transformed into other Pikmin species by Candypop Buds.

&quot;Pikmin 3&quot; introduced two new species of Pikmin: Rock Pikmin and Winged Pikmin. The gray-colored Rock Pikmin look like small rocks and can smash through glass, crystals, ice, and the carapaces of large creatures. These Pikmin can also survive crushing attacks from boulders and enemies and are invulnerable to piercing attacks as well. Rock Pikmin also cause more initial damage when thrown at an enemy, though they are unable to latch onto them. The pink-colored Winged Pikmin are the smallest species of Pikmin and hover in the air using their small wings. They can fly over hazards such as water and pits and can carry items in the air.

&quot;Pikmin 4&quot; also introduced two new species of Pikmin: Ice Pikmin and Glow Pikmin. Ice Pikmin can freeze enemies and water. Glow Pikmin are ghost-like Pikmin that only come out at night and are invulnerable to all elemental hazards. They can only be used during night expeditions or in caves.

==== Other characters ====
Another main character in &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; is the President of Hocotate Freight, a large man who runs the company and keeps debt collectors away. The president is forced to sell the Dolphin, and it is replaced by an unnamed ship that can speak, name, and value the treasure on the planet.

==Development==
===2001–2003: &quot;Pikmin&quot;===
&quot;Pikmin&quot; is the first game in the series, released on October 26, 2001. The game&#x27;s plot focuses on Captain Olimar&#x27;s predicament of having crash-landed on an unknown planet and befriending plant-animal creatures that he dubs Pikmin because of their similarity to the brand of carrots called &quot;Pikpik&quot;. Olimar has to gather the missing pieces of his broken spaceship to escape before his air supply completely runs out and he succumbs to the planet&#x27;s oxygen-rich atmosphere, which is poisonous to his species. &quot;Pikmin&quot; features three endings, which are dependent on the number of spaceship parts reclaimed. Reclaiming all thirty parts by the final day results in the best ending: Olimar waves goodbye to the Pikmin, who proceed to defend themselves on their own at nighttime, while Onions of various colors observe his departure as he looks back on the unknown planet before returning home. Reclaiming at least the twenty-five required parts by the final day results in the normal ending: Olimar quickly departs, while one of each type of Pikmin runs toward his ship to watch him depart. Lastly, failing to reclaim the twenty-five required parts by the final day results in the worst ending: Olimar crash-lands back onto the planet, succumbs to oxygen poisoning, and is taken by several Pikmin to be placed into an Onion, which converts him into a Pikmin-Hocotatian hybrid.

&quot;Pikmin&quot; was ported to the Wii in 2009 as a New Play Control! title, which was made available on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console service in North America in 2016. An HD remaster of the game was released for Nintendo Switch in 2023.

===2004–2012: &quot;Pikmin 2&quot;===
&quot;Pikmin 2&quot;, released in 2004, takes place immediately following the events of &quot;Pikmin&quot;. When Olimar returns to his home planet Hocotate, he discovers that his employer, Hocotate Freight, has gone into severe debt. When the company&#x27;s president discovers that the souvenir that Olimar has brought back with him is significantly valuable, he orders Olimar and Louie, another employee, to journey back to the Pikmin planet and gather treasure to pay off the debt. The main objective of &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; is to collect human garbage that is referred to as treasure on Hocotate, including bottle caps and gadgets. The player controls both Olimar and Louie, alternating between the two characters to divide and accomplish more tasks during a single day. Unlike the first game, &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; has no deadline, so the player can spend as many days as desired to collect all the treasure.

Like its predecessor, &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; was ported to the Wii in 2009 (or 2012 in North America) as a New Play Control! title was made available on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console service in Europe in 2016. An HD remaster of the game was released for Nintendo Switch in 2023.

===2013–2022: &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; and spin-offs===
Shigeru Miyamoto hinted about the possibilities of a new &quot;Pikmin&quot; game in a July 2007 interview with IGN, saying &quot;I certainly don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve seen the last of &quot;Pikmin&quot;. I definitely would like to do something with them, and I think the Wii interface in particular is very well suited to that franchise.&quot; A later CNET.com interview in April 2008 reported that &quot;For now, Miyamoto looks ahead to other projects for the Wii, mentioning his desire to continue the &quot;Pikmin&quot; series.&quot; A new &quot;Pikmin&quot; game was confirmed at E3 2008 during Nintendo&#x27;s developer roundtable, in which Miyamoto stated that his team was working on a new entry in the series. Miyamoto confirmed that &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; would be released on the Wii. He also stated that the Wii&#x27;s controls were &quot;working well&quot; with the game. The announcement in October 2008 of a re-release of the first two &quot;Pikmin&quot; games on the Wii with updated motion controls, raised concerns about whether &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; was in development. However, a subsequent interview with IGN clarified that the re-releases of &quot;Pikmin&quot; and &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; under the &quot;New Play Control!&quot; series was separate from &quot;Pikmin 3&quot;. The game was not shown at E3 2009, E3 2010, or E3 2011, but Miyamoto confirmed in June 2010 that the game was still in development. At Miyamoto&#x27;s roundtable discussion at E3 2011, Miyamoto stated that &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; development was moved to Wii U, the Wii successor. He said that the HD graphics for the next system and its special screen-based controller would work better for it. On April 15, 2012, Miyamoto said in a Spanish interview that a new &quot;Pikmin&quot; game and a new &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot; game will both be showcased for the Wii U at E3 2012. He also added the comment &quot;Anyone who played the original &quot;Pikmin&quot; games will enjoy playing it.&quot; On June 5, 2012, at Nintendo&#x27;s E3 press conference, &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; was announced and featured a trailer that revealed the inclusion of the new Rock Pikmin. Six days later, a second trailer was released that revealed the new Winged Pikmin and other aspects of the game. Although originally intended to be released within the Wii U&#x27;s launch window, &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; was delayed and instead released in mid-2013.

On August 5, 2020, Nintendo announced &quot;Pikmin 3 Deluxe&quot;, an enhanced port of &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; for the Nintendo Switch, for release on October 30, 2020, via Twitter.

A Nintendo 3DS entry in the series was announced in a Nintendo Direct in September 2016 as a side-scrolling action game due for release in 2017. In another Nintendo Direct in April 2017, the game&#x27;s title was announced as &quot;Hey! Pikmin&quot; and its release date was announced to be July 28, 2017. The game was developed by Arzest.

On March 22, 2021, Niantic, known primarily for the mobile game &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, announced a Pikmin game for mobile devices. Little was known at the time of announcement, except that it will feature similar gameplay to &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, using augmented reality technology. A playable prototype was released for select users in Singapore the same day the game was announced. On October 26, 2021, the game was revealed to be titled &quot;Pikmin Bloom&quot; and launched immediately in Australia and Singapore.

=== 2023–present: &quot;Pikmin 4&quot; and spin-offs ===
In September 2015, Miyamoto said that &quot;Pikmin 4&quot; was in development, and &quot;very close to completion&quot;. On July 7, 2016, Miyamoto said in an E3 interview with &quot;Game Rant&quot; that &quot;Pikmin 4&quot; was still in development, though at a lower priority. On June 19, 2017, Miyamoto reassured &quot;Eurogamer&quot; that the game was still &quot;progressing&quot;. In the years to follow, the game was widely considered vaporware until it was officially unveiled on September 13, 2022.

&quot;Pikmin 4&quot; was developed using Unreal Engine, its first use in an internally developed Nintendo EPD game, although the game was co-developed with Eighting. Lead staff include veteran Pikmin developer Yuji Kando, who was one of the two directors of &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; and returned as chief director and programming director; Yutaka Hiramuki as game design and lead writer, responsible for the level design and story similarly to his responsibilities on &quot;Pikmin 3&quot;; Takashi Tezuka, who returned as the mainline series producer, a role he has held since &quot;Pikmin 2&quot;, and Shigeru Miyamoto, who returned as the general producer, the same position he had in &quot;Pikmin 3&quot;.

Throughout the series, two styles of gameplay had emerged: a shorter, more focused challenge that encourages resource management and multitasking with an ultimate time limit, seen in &quot;Pikmin&quot; (2001) and &quot;Pikmin 3&quot;, and a longer experience featuring the collection of treasures within dangerous underground caves that focus more on the aspect of resource management without time limits in &quot;Pikmin 2&quot;. In &quot;Pikmin 4&quot;, the team aimed to appease fans of both gameplay types by trying to mix both styles into one, as well as make a highly approachable and accessible game, considering the series&#x27; relative lack of success in reaching general audiences. Additionally, the team wanted to incorporate new and exciting elements as selling points, such as Oatchi. This resulted in an extended development period, with many discussions among staff.

&quot;Pikmin 4&quot; was announced by Miyamoto in a Nintendo Direct on September 13, 2022. The teaser trailer gives a brief glimpse of the game&#x27;s environment, without any gameplay or story details. In the February 8, 2023, Nintendo Direct, &quot;Pikmin 4&quot; was revealed to launch on July 21, 2023. A demo was released on June 28, 2023. &quot;Pikmin 4&quot; was released on July 21, 2023, for the Nintendo Switch. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the game&#x27;s level design, visuals, score, large amount of content, and accessibility to newcomers, while criticizing the limited multiplayer options and low difficulty. The game was commercially successful, selling over three million units worldwide, making it the best-selling game in the series.

The first two games in the series were remastered for the Nintendo Switch in September 2023 as &quot;Pikmin 1+2&quot;. &quot;Pikmin Finder&quot; was released in 2023 and is an augmented reality browser-based mobile game. Developed and published by Nintendo using Niantic&#x27;s 8th Wall development platform, the game involves using the player&#x27;s mobile camera to display Pikmin and command them to carry treasure back to the player. The game was distributed in early September to coincide with Nintendo Live.

== Hoaxes and Rumors ==

=== Pom &amp; Orange Pikmin ===
Before the official release of &quot;Pikmin 4&quot;, a Reddit user posted a series of alleged gameplay leaks that gained attention within the gaming community. The user claimed that the protagonist of the game was named &quot;Pom&quot; and suggested that the character&#x27;s name was derived from the Pomeranian dog breed, as other captains in the game were purportedly named after dog breeds. Additionally, the user shared a &quot;leaked&quot; image featuring the protagonist with Red and Orange Pikmin. The description provided by the user included a claim that the Orange Pikmin were one-eyed, a notable deviation from previous Pikmin types.

Later, the user revealed that these &quot;leaks&quot; were false, and the content was fabricated.

=== Fiddlebert ===
In late June 2024, a Reddit user posted a satirical joke claiming that a character named &quot;Fiddlebert&quot; appeared in early versions of &quot;Pikmin 1&quot;. The post, intended for humor, led to confusion among some fans, with many questioning whether Fiddlebert was a legitimate character or a fabrication. As the post spread, a number of individuals who recognized it as a joke further participated by making false claims about the character&#x27;s alleged appearances in the &quot;Pikmin&quot; series. However, there is no official evidence or documentation to support the existence of Fiddlebert, and it has been confirmed that the character is not part of the &quot;Pikmin&quot; franchise.

==Reception==

The &quot;Pikmin&quot; series has received generally positive reviews. The series has been praised for its strategic gameplay based on time and resource management, as well as its graphics; Philip Kollar of &quot;Polygon&quot; described &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; as &quot;one of those rare pieces of evidence that a modern Nintendo can still produce something wholly unique.&quot;

==Legacy==
Olimar was introduced as a playable character in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series beginning with 2008&#x27;s &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, and has appeared in every subsequent entry. He commands the Pikmin in battle and, like in the &quot;Pikmin&quot; series, he is almost entirely dependent on them. Olimar can pluck new Pikmin from the ground at any time unless he has the maximum number of Pikmin allowed; he can command up to six in &quot;Brawl&quot;, and three in subsequent games. The Pikmin, as in the &quot;Pikmin&quot; series, are fragile and can be trounced, but new ones can be plucked from the stage immediately after. Olimar&#x27;s Final Smash, a signature one-use technique, shows him getting into his Hocotate Spaceship and flying off into the sky, while Red Bulborbs attack the other players on the ground. The ship then plummets to the ground and causes an explosion, dealing damage and knockback to opposing players as Olimar is ejected from it. &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; also features a playable stage called Distant Planet, based on the general setting of the Pikmin&#x27;s home planet featured in the first three &quot;Pikmin&quot; games. The same stage returned in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot;, while &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot; added a stage based on &quot;Pikmin 3&quot;; both stages returned in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. Alph from &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; appears as an alternate costume for Olimar beginning with &quot;3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;.

Pikmin appear in the Nintendo 3DS built-in application &quot;AR Games&quot;. Pikmin make a cameo during the process of transferring downloadable content from a Nintendo DSi to a 3DS, (or transferring from a 3DS to another 3DS or 2DS) with various types of Pikmin carrying the data over. A similar animation occurs when transferring saved data and other information from a Wii to an SD card using the Wii U transfer application, and a second animation, picking up where the first one leaves off, appears when completing the transfer from the SD card to a Wii U.

&quot;Nintendo Land&quot; includes the series in a team attraction titled &quot;Pikmin Adventure&quot;, where players&#x27; Mii&#x27;s fight robotic versions of familiar Pikmin foes. &quot;Pikmin Adventure&quot; utilizes the Wii U GamePad and Wii Remote; the former controls Olimar, whereas the latter allows other players to play as Pikmin. On the Game Boy Advance, the card-based Nintendo e-Reader peripheral included Pikmin minigames exclusive to Japan following the release of &quot;Pikmin 2&quot;, titled &quot;Pikmin 2-E&quot;. In the various minigames, players control either Olimar or the Pikmin to complete various puzzles.

&quot;Pikmin&quot; franchise amiibo figures can be used to unlock a &quot;Pikmin&quot; Mii costume in &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot;, and &quot;Pikmin&quot; character costumes in &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot;.

Several red, yellow, and blue Pikmin can be found across the land on ledges of Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Japan, with some carrying objects like coins from the &quot; Mario&quot; franchise and a berry.

Pikmin gummy candy was released exclusively in Japan in September 2021. This candy included grape-flavored blues, apple-flavored reds, orange-flavored yellows, and lemon-flavored white Pikmin.

A manga-style comic strip based on the &quot;Pikmin&quot; series, written by Kino Takahashi, was first published on June 21, 2023.

=== &quot;Pikmin&quot; Short Movies ===
On November 5, 2014, three short, animated &quot;Pikmin&quot; movies were released on the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS eShop, after being shown at the Tokyo International Film Festival. The films, &quot;The Night Juicer&quot;, &quot;Treasure in a Bottle&quot;, and &quot;Occupational Hazards&quot;, each feature groups of Pikmin and often Captain Olimar as well. To commemorate the films, puzzles related to them were made available in the Puzzle Swap game mode of &quot;StreetPass Mii Plaza&quot;. They were later uploaded to YouTube to promote &quot;Pikmin 3 Deluxe&quot;.

The Chaser was one of Toyota&#x27;s &quot;triplet sedans&quot;: it, the Mark II, and the Cresta are rebadged models of the same car, sold through different dealership sales channels. The Chaser and its platform sisters are considered a class below the Crown. The Chaser offered a sportier image than the Mark II or the more luxury-oriented Cresta.

The Chaser&#x27;s performance reputation benefited as the series and generations offered ever-increasing engine displacement. The addition of turbochargers and superchargers to growing engine displacement was offset by the fact that the Japanese Government taxed and regulated vehicle emission results. Larger engines offered more luxury, convenience, and suspension improvements as the generations progressed. Toyota chose not to install V6 engines in the Chaser for the entire series.


== First generation (X30, X40; 1977-1980)==
The Chaser was first produced in July 1977 with chassis codes X30, X31, X40 and X41, and evolved from the X20 generation Mark II GSS hardtop coupé. The X30-series chassis numbers were the original codes shared with the third-generation Mark II, with X40 numbers gradually introduced about halfway through the model&#x27;s life for cars that could pass the new emissions rules. All vehicles sold with Toyota&#x27;s TTC-C technology had a badge on the boot lid to indicate it complied with the Japanese Government&#x27;s Clean Air Act of 1975. It was powered by the four-cylinder 1.8-liter 3T-U, 13T-U, and 2-liter 18R-U, and the six-cylinder 2.0 L M-EU engine – all single cam engines tuned for economy and clean emissions rather than performance. The M-EU engine came standard with multi-port electronic fuel injection. 

The Chaser is a lightly redesigned Toyota Mark II, with a wider front grille and without parking lights. The Chaser also has taillights of a different design. Unlike the Mark II, there were no station wagons or commercial models offered. This was the only Chaser offered as a 2-door, with the 2-door option being replaced by the Toyota Soarer.

To provide buyers with a luxury sports sedan while minimizing tax consequences, the vehicle was limited to an engine size of 2000 cc as well as dimensions under long and wide. Engine displacements of 1.8 L and 2.0 L were offered to keep the annual road tax bill affordable to Japanese buyers, and the wheelbase was the same for both the two- and four-door. The Chaser was offered as a competitor to the Nissan Skyline coupé and sedan and the Mazda Cosmo. The front suspension was an independent MacPherson strut, and the standard rear suspension was a 4-link system, with top trim packages adopting an independent semi-trailing arm system instead. The models with a 4-wheel independent suspension also came with 4-wheel disc brakes. All body styles were now integrated with a safety cage with crumple zones for the front and rear, a body-on-frame chassis was abandoned, and unitary construction was now used.

The first Chaser came with power express down for the driver&#x27;s window, a tilt steering wheel, a system monitor that would inform if the disc brake lining needed to be serviced, an AM/FM Stereo radio with four speakers, and a separately available cassette player or 8-track cassette, full instrumentation including a volt meter and oil pressure, cruise control, and the rear seatback that could fold down to accommodate long items in the trunk. The Chaser received a new windshield wiper and headlight switch layout, with the controls operated by levers attached to the steering column as is typical nowadays. Wipers were two-speed with intermittent wipe, a rear wiper was also available for the upper trim level packages.

The performance image was shared with the 1972 Toyota Sprinter Trueno, followed by the 1978 Toyota Celica XX, and the 1980 Toyota Celica Camry and shared the 2.0 L &quot;M-EU&quot; Inline-six engine from the Celica XX. The Celica XX was the top-level car exclusive to &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; with the Celica Camry, then August 1980 the Celica Camry was also added to &quot;Toyota Vista Store&quot; with the more upscale Cresta.

== Second generation (X60; 1980-1984)==
The X60 Chaser began sales in October 1980, with the addition of the new 2.0-liter six-cylinder multi-port fuel injected 1G-EU single cam gasoline engine and a 2.2 L four-cylinder L-series diesel engine. The Chaser continued as the performance sedan and shared many technical improvements introduced on the Celica XX.

Body styles offered were a four-door sedan or 4-door pillared hardtop, and no longer offered the 2-door hardtop, which was replaced by the all-new luxury coupé Toyota Soarer. The top trim package &quot;Avante&quot; was introduced and remained until the Chaser was discontinued in 2001. 

The word &quot;&quot; is Latin and means to go forward or to lead ahead.

The hardtop and sedan came with individual trim packages, and the hardtop was the most desirable, while the XL and DX had flat bumpers that shortened their overall length. The front suspension consisted of MacPherson struts with a lower control arm, and the rear suspension used a semi-trailing arm with coil springs and separately installed shock absorbers. Four-wheel ventilated disc brakes and speed-sensitive power rack-and-pinion steering were standard. Fourteen-inch aluminum alloy wheels were standard on the Avante and SG Touring trim packages while thirteen-inch steel wheels were installed on other trim packages. The Avante was available with ESC (Electronic Skid Control) and was later added to other trim packages over time.

The cloth-only interior offered a power-adjustable driver&#x27;s seat with lumbar support. The rear seat had a fold-down armrest and a 60/40 split rear seatback that could accommodate longer items. Each trim package offered seven exterior colors, and one two-tone color choice of dark gray over silver was only available on the Avante. Interior color choices of blue, gray, or brown were offered, but each trim package had a unique upholstery pattern in cloth, and leather was unavailable. The body color dictated the interior color unless specially ordered, and the availability of standard equipment for each trim package grew as the selection was elevated. 

Optional items included several sound system choices, including an AM/FM stereo cassette with integrated equalizer, a trip computer, power windows with standard equipped express down for the driver&#x27;s window, glass sunroof, cruise control, digital clock with an alarm feature, a rear window wiper with electric defrost, headlight washers for the halogen headlights, and three-point seatbelts for front and rear passengers with ELR safety lock-down in case of a collision. 

This generation saw the introduction of a new companion called the Cresta to compete with the Nissan Leopard, while the Chaser continued to be the alternative to the Skyline. 

In August 1982, the 2.0 L 6-cylinder 1G-GEU twincam with the new engine family name LASREα (lightweight, advanced, super response, and engine) was added, and the series R and M engines were phased out. In 1980, the Celica Camry, which was offered at &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; and &quot;Toyota Auto Store&quot;, was renamed the Toyota Vista and a new dealership, &quot;Toyota Vista Store&quot; was created for the Vista.

== Third generation (X70; 1984–1988)==
This series first appeared in August 1984, and the hardtop body style was the only one offered. This car&#x27;s exterior dimensions were slightly smaller than those of the sister cars, Mark II and Cresta. Still, the Chaser was more performance-oriented while maintaining the Cresta&#x27;s advanced features and luxurious interior. In October 1985, the 1G-GTEU parallel twin turbo was installed in the trim package &quot;GT TWIN TURBO,&quot; which was a trim package name shared with the Cresta. Disc brakes are larger in diameter, and it was now equipped with bucket seats, borrowed from the Supra (A60) to distinguish that the Chaser was a performance sedan and set it apart from the luxurious Cresta. The Cresta, Chaser, and Mark II would now share a model code for the entire production series. The Chaser was marketed for the growing private ownership market, while the Crown offered additional amenities focused toward chauffeur-driven corporate ownership and premium-level taxi service. Side turn signal lights were installed above the headlights to enhance pedestrian safety.

The 1G-GEU engine received various improvements, while the LPG-powered engine was changed to the 3Y-PU. As for appearance, larger bumpers and a new front grille accompanied substantial changes to the equipment. The early type rear combination lamps were kept with minor revisions. The TEMS installation shared the same settings used in the 1986 Soarer and 1986 Supra (A70) to remain consistent with its performance-focused market position. The four-wheel independent suspension was improved and given the name PEGASUS, which first appeared on the Soarer. The &quot;GT TWIN TURBO S&quot; was only available with a 5-speed manual transmission. There were three kinds of four-speed automatic transmissions on offer labeled as ECT-S. The conventional automatic for the 1800 and turbodiesel engines (the naturally aspirated diesel did not come with an automatic option), a four-speed with a two-way overdrive for the 2-litre petrol engine, and an electronically controlled overdrive unit for the twin cam and turbo models. The ECT-S setting was linked to the TEMS setting, and the vehicle speed-sensitive power steering was modified.

Optional items introduced from the previous generation continued while new enhancements appeared. The trip computer was now integrated into a digital instrument cluster, which incorporated the TEMS setting and the ECT-S gear selection to include whether the transmission was in &quot;Normal,&quot; &quot;Power,&quot; or &quot;Econ&quot; settings and whether the overdrive was disengaged. Six different stereo choices were offered along with simple satellite controls on the left side of the instrument cluster within reach of the driver&#x27;s hand that controlled stereo volume, fan speed, and airflow direction, an illuminated ignition key slot, power-folding side-view mirrors installed on the doors, fully automatic climate control, and an air purification system installed behind the rear seats. Bucket seats, borrowed from the Supra (A60), were only available on GT Twin Turbo trim packages.

In January 1987, the &quot;Avante Lordly&quot; variant was released, and in September 1987, new versions of the 2L and 2L-T diesel engines complying with the 1986 car emissions standards were introduced. In January 1988 the &quot;Avante Supra&quot; special edition was released as a companion to the updated, third-generation Supra (A70).

*Diesel Sedan trim packages
**XL (diesel and turbodiesel), XG (turbodiesel)

== Fourth generation (X80; 1988–1992)==
In August 1988, the X81 series of Chasers were introduced to the Japanese market. The GT Twin Turbo model was now the most powerful variant, powered by the 1G-GTE engine putting out at 6200 rpm. The Avante G model was the highest special edition model in terms of equipment. In August 1989, two more models were added to the Avante lineup: the Avante G-L and the top-level Avante G. The Chaser was no longer the top-level car at &quot;Toyota Auto Store&quot; when the Toyota Aristo was introduced in 1991.

This generation introduced a visual distinction: the Chaser was only available as a pillared hardtop, the Cresta was only a sedan, and the Mark II offered both body styles. Exterior dimensions increased to the maximum limit under Japanese Government dimension regulations and now matched the Crown. To reduce weight and improve structural rigidity, High-tensile steel was used in key areas and the suspension. Five studs were added to each wheel to cope with the additional torque from the larger engines.

The top-of-the-line model, called &quot;Avante G&quot; had two variants. The base variant &quot;2.0 Avante G&quot; included a supercharger equipped 2.0 L &quot;1G-GZE&quot; straight six engine, while the &quot;3.0 Avante G&quot; included the 3.0 L &quot;7M-GE&quot; straight six shared with the Soarer. The supercharger was belt-driven but actuated by an electromagnetic clutch so that it would not be driven except when needed, increasing fuel economy.

The suspension continued to offer MacPherson struts for the front, but the rear suspension was upgraded to a new double-wishbone design. The optional TEMS electronic shock absorbers and specially modified MacPherson struts were available on the top-level trim package Avante G. The new rear suspension was shared with the Soarer, including a limited-slip differential on the GT Twin Turbo. ESC anti-lock brakes and the ECT-S automatic transmission continued and was available on more trim packages.

The options list continued to offer the digital instrument cluster, front and rear parking sensors, and seven AM/FM stereos with available cassette players could be selected, along with a CD player. The stereo controls were separated by a second row of switches just above the automatic climate control that performed simple functions. A trunk-mounted spoiler with a third brake light could be added. The cloth upholstery was unique to each trim package but without leather. The sport bucket seats used in the Toyota Supra (A70) were offered only on GT Twin Turbo equipped cars.

In August 1990, major revisions were made to the Chaser lineup, and some of the models received entirely new engines. The top-range models, Avante G and GT Twin Turbo, received the new 2.5L 1JZ engine, which was shared with the JZA70 Supra. The Avante G 2.5L received a normally aspirated 1JZ-GE engine with a maximum at 6000 rpm, while the GT Twin Turbo received the parallel twin-turbo 1JZ-GTE capable of at 6200 rpm, the maximum horsepower allowed under Japanese regulations. The 3.0 Avante G with the normally aspirated 7M-GE engine was the last generation that used the venerable Toyota M engine. In 1990 the 3.0 Avante G came with the 2JZ-GE. The Avante 2.5 and 3.0-litre engines incurred more annual road tax and came equipped with optional items on other trim packages as standard to compensate for the ownership costs.

*Diesel trim package:
**XL (turbodiesel)

== Fifth generation (X90; 1992–1996)==
In October 1992, the X90 Chaser replaced the previous X81 Chaser. It had a larger body, better handling, and more engine power. The body was curvier, and the car was significantly longer. With the introduction of the Third Generation Soarer, the exterior of the Chaser was more visually aligned with the Toyota Aristo, which was now the senior luxury sedan at &quot;Toyota Auto Store&quot; locations, while retaining the pillared hardtop appearance. The top-of-the-line Avante G model received a natural aspirated 2JZ-GE, the next evolution of the JZ series of engines after the 1JZ. Exterior dimensions exceeded the maximum limit under Japanese Government dimension regulations, and buyers now paid more yearly taxes, contributing to diminished sales.

The Tourer V was equipped with the 1JZ-GTE twin-turbo engine, the most potent offering, while the Tourer S trim received the non-turbo 1JZ-GE; the Tourer package replaced the trim package &quot;GT.&quot; Manual transmissions were optional for all engine offerings, from the 1.8-liter 4S-FE&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=495638&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and 2.4 turbodiesel 2L-TE up through the 2.0-liter 1G-FE and 2.5-liter 1JZ-GE straight-sixes. In September 1992, the Tourer models received equipment upgrades, although not to the level of the Avante G, and their prices were correspondingly higher. The traditional MacPherson strut front suspension added double wishbone technology with this series.

Permanent all-wheel-drive, called i-Four, was offered as an option in 1993 to stay competitive with the Nissan Skyline GTS sedan. The system typically provided 30 percent to the front and 70 percent to the rear wheels, incorporating a center differential lock feature. It was described as a safety feature linked to the anti-lock brakes, traction control, electronically controlled transmission, and electronic fuel injection, and it was offered on the Avante Four trim package. Supplementing the safety enhancement, a driver-side airbag was now standard for all trim packages. The ECT electronically controlled automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential (LSD) unit were now standard on all rear-drive drivetrain installations.

The Avante G was available with Electro MultiVision, a 6-inch color LCD screen that displayed TV broadcasts, stereo settings, climate control settings, fuel economy and cruising range, and maintenance reminders. This was the first version to offer a touch-sensitive screen, which was previously introduced in the Crown. CD-ROM updated maps, and VICS local traffic conditions were integrated, and GPS location information was used to display the vehicle&#x27;s position. Four stereo choices were offered, including two different versions that provided an in-dash CD player, along with DSP (Digital Sound Processing) that would modify the sound to simulate different venues. Ten speakers were available, including a subwoofer. Front and rear parking sensors, remote keyless entry, cellular phone handset in the front armrest with hands-free voice dialing, and the first-time leather interior was offered, were all optional equipment.

After the X80 generation, the export-market Cressida retired, and the X90 (in Mark II, Chaser, or Cresta guises) was only offered in the Japanese home market. Each member of the Mark II family supposedly had different characteristics—the Chaser was a pillared hardtop geared towards sporty driving, the Cresta was a stylish opulent luxury sedan, and the Mark II was a traditional luxury sedan.

== Sixth generation (X100; 1996–2001)==


In September 1996, the X100 Chaser replaced the X90 Chaser. The product lineup consisted mostly of Avante and Tourer trim, with the Avante as the luxury model (with more interior accessories) and the Tourer as the sporty model (with large 16-inch wheels). Toyota&#x27;s VVTi, the company&#x27;s version of variable-valve timing, was added to the 1JZ engines; they were also upgraded to have more torque, since they had already reached the agreed voluntary limit set by Japanese Automobile Manufacturer&#x27;s Association regarding horsepower. The 1JZ-GTE was powered by a single turbo configuration instead of the twin turbo of its predecessors. 

New to the lineup was the Avante Four and the Avante Four G Package, which was the Avante 2.5 L installed with i-Four all-wheel-drive. These cars were only available with a 4-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission. The Tourer V and the automatic-only Avante G 3.0 L (2JZ) models had the option of electronic control flex lockup attaching 4-speed automatic (intelligent) (ECT-iE) transmission, besides the ECT-E automatic in the lower-end models. The Tourer V and Tourer S came standard with the next generation of digital instrumentation called Optitron while the Avante continued to use the previous version. Dual airbags and side airbags in the outer edge of the front seatbacks were now standard equipment.

In 1997, the lineup was updated. The XL was powered by the 2.4 L &quot;2L-TE&quot; turbodiesel engine, while the &quot;1G-FE&quot; engine powered the Tourer 2.0 L, rated at at 5,600 rpm. These models were only sold with the 4-speed electronic control type (ECT) automatic transmission. The GPS-enabled navigation system continued with improvements and additional functionality.

In mid-late 1998, the base Tourer model received the optional manual gearbox. An AWD option was added to the 2.5L Avante models; the Four G Package received a higher special-edition interior. Additionally, the Chaser received a facelift, with the most significant changes to the rear tail lights. Other changes included new fog lights with a slightly redesigned front bar to accommodate them, different interior fabric, a 3-spoke steering wheel instead of 4 spokes, orange gauge lighting instead of white, and a grille with 2 horizontal bars instead of 3. The Chaser continued to be offered as the second-level sedan below the Toyota Aristo, and in 1998 &quot;Toyota Vista Store&quot; and &quot;Toyota Auto Store&quot; locations were combined and renamed &quot;NETZ Store&quot;.

The Chaser was discontinued in June 2001. It was replaced with a new model called the Verossa which shared the same model code. The Cresta suffered the same fate, but the Mark II continued for another generation (X110) before it was also discontinued. In 2004, the all-new X120 Mark X was introduced in Japan, incorporating many characteristics of the Chaser and the Cresta.

*Trim packages (3.0L, 2.5L, 2.0L and 1.8L)
**3.0 Avante G, 2.5 Avante G, 2.5 Tourer V, 2.5 Tourer S, 2.5 Avante, 2.5 Avante Four, 2.0 Avante, 2.0 Tourer
*Diesel Sedan trim packages
**Avante, XL (turbodiesel) 

===Motorsports===
X100 Chasers took part in the Japanese Touring Car Championship in 1997 and 1998. The car did not manage to win a race in its debut season, while the following year, when other manufacturers had left the JTCC, it won the title with Masanori Sekiya and TOM&#x27;S. The Chaser became famous in drifting events, due to its traditional front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, and vehicles without AWD installed are more sought after. Numerous Toyota Chasers, especially the later X90s and X100s, have been modified for use in drift.

<doc id="1324135" wikidata="Q442010" url="?curid=1324135" title="Ivry Gitlis">
<text>Ivry Gitlis (;‎ 25 August 1922 – 24 December 2020) was an Israeli virtuoso violinist and UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador. He performed with the world&#x27;s top orchestras, including the London Philharmonic, New York Philharmonic, Berlin Philharmonic, Vienna Philharmonic, and Philadelphia Orchestra.

==Early life and education==
Yitzhak-Meir (Isaac) Gitlis was born on 25 August 1922 in Haifa, Israel to Jewish parents Asher and Hedva Gitlis, who emigrated in 1921 from Kamianets-Podilskyi, Ukraine.

Gitlis acquired his first violin when he was five years old and started lessons under Mme Velikovsky together with his friend Zvi Zeitlin. He then studied privately with Mira Ben-Ami, a pupil of Joseph Szigeti. When he was eight, she arranged for him to play for Bronisław Huberman, which prompted a fundraising campaign to allow him to study in France.

In 1933, he arrived with his mother in Paris and started to take lessons with Marcel Chailley, husband of the pianist Céliny Chailley-Richez. Being very close to their family, he was introduced to George Enescu and Jacques Thibaud. In that period, he decided to change his birth name (Isaac)) to Ivry. At 11, Gitlis (&quot;Jitlis&quot;) entered the Conservatoire de Paris in the class of Jules Boucherit, and graduated in 1935.

From 1938 to 1940, his teachers included George Enescu and Jacques Thibaud in Paris and Carl Flesch in Spa, Belgium and later in London.

==Career==
===World War II===
In 1940, during World War II, he went to London where he first worked for two years in a war factory and was then assigned to the artists branch of the British Army. He gave numerous concerts for the Allied soldiers and in war factories. After the war he made his successful debut with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and subsequently played with the BBC and all other principal orchestras of Great Britain.

===1950s===
In 1951, as suggested by his teacher Alice Pashkus, he participated in the Long-Thibaud Competition in Paris, where he took fifth place. During the preliminary stages of the competition, a rumor circulated that he had stolen a Stradivarius violin during the war, which caused a scandal on the day of the final. Six years after the fall of Hitler, being a Jew in France was still causing debate.
In the same year, Gitlis made his debut in Paris, playing in a recital at the Salle Gaveau, sponsored by the music manager Marcel de Valmalète (9 July 1951).

In those years Ivry Gitlis already ranked with the foremost young masters of his instrument in the world. He started the study of the violin at the age of five. His debut was made shortly after that and he so impressed the noted virtuoso, Bronislaw Huberman, that he was sent to Paris to study. At the age of 11, the boy won first place among 150 competitors for admission to the Paris Conservatoire, and at 13, he got &quot;Premier Prix&quot; (graduated) at the Conservatoire. Gitlis continued his studies with such noted virtuosi as Georges Enesco, Jacques Thibaud and Theodore Pashkus, after which we embarked on a European concert tour. During the war, the youngster remained in London where he performed for the Armed Forces in hundreds of concerts. In the last few years he has been soloist with such orchestras as the London Philharmonic, London Symphony, Liverpool Philharmonic, etc. He has featured contemporary music on his program ranging from works of Bartok to Lennox Berkley, Ivor Walsworth and Hindemith, as well as continuing his programs of the music of the classics. Further tours of the European continent have strengthened critical belief that Ivry Gitlis was destined to become one of the world&#x27;s greatest violinists. (text extracted from: Don Gabor archives, ©1950). In 1955 he moved to the United States where he met Jascha Heifetz. There he made several tours, managed by Sol Hurok, including those conducted by Eugene Ormandy (Tchaikovsky, in Philadelphia) and George Szell (Sibelius, on 15,16 and 18 December 1955 in New York). 
In Europe, between 1954 and 1955, he recorded for the Vox label concertos by Berg (Violin Concerto &quot;To the memory of an angel&quot;, coupled with &quot;Chamber Concerto&quot; -Vox PL 8660- which was awarded a &quot;Grand Prix du Disque&quot; in 1954), Tchaikovsky, Mendelssohn, Stravinsky (Violin Concerto, coupled with &quot;Duo Concertant&quot;) and with the conductor Jascha Horenstein, Bartók, Bruch and Sibelius. His recording of Bartók&#x27;s 2nd Violin Concerto and Solo Violin Sonata -Vox PL 9020- received the &quot;Best Record of the Year&quot; award from the New York Herald Tribune in 1955.

===1960s===
In 1963, he was the first Israeli violinist to play in the Soviet Union. He gave a series of concerts under the cultural exchange program of the Soviet Union and Israel, starting in Vilnius (23 October 1963). His other concerts were given in Moscow, Leningrad, Kyiv and Odesa.

In 1968, he participated in The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus film project, performing &quot;Whole Lotta Yoko&quot; with Yoko Ono and The Dirty Mac.

Many composers were fascinated by his sound and way of playing, among whom René Leibowitz who dedicated his Violin Concerto, Op. 50 (1958) to him; Roman Haubenstock-Ramati with &quot;Sequences&quot; for Violin and Orchestra (1958); Bruno Maderna writing &quot;Pièce pour Ivry&quot; (1971), which Gitlis never recorded commercially, but recorded live in Paris on 25 May 1983; Yannis Xenakis with &quot;Mikka&quot;, which Gitlis premièred in 1972; Charles Harold Bernstein with two works for solo violin, inspired by Gitlis, &quot;Rhapsodie Israélienne&quot; and &quot;Romantic Suite&quot; (1984).

===1970s===
In 1972, Gitlis founded the Festival de Vence, famous for its innovative programming. He was also the inspirer and organiser of the Saint André de Cubzac, Alfortville and Bonifacio Music Festivals.

In 1975, he undertook a dramatic role, as Hypnotist in François Truffaut&#x27;s film, &quot;The Story of Adele H&quot;.

He often visited Japan, where he was very popular.

===1990s===
In 1990, Gitlis was designated UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador. His stated aim was the &quot;support of education and culture of peace and tolerance&quot;. He performed at the opening event of the International Bioethics Committee&#x27;s 3rd session in 1995.

===2000s===

Ivry Gitlis was a commentator (along with Itzhak Perlman) on the DVD &quot;The Art of Violin&quot; (2000), which showcases violin performances and gives biographical details of many of the great violinists of the twentieth century.

In 2008, he became patron of the Paris-based association &quot;Inspiration(s)&quot;, whose aim is to make classical music accessible to all. He was a Fellow of the Royal Northern College of Music.

He was a distinguished guest of the International Master Course for violinists and string players at Keshet Eilon Music Center.

==Violins==
At various stages in his career, Gitlis played on a 1699 Giovanni Battista Rogeri, which he sold to famed violin author Sidney Bowden, the 1737 &quot;Chant du Cygne&quot; Antonio Stradivari, and the 1740 &quot;Ysaye&quot; Guarneri del Gesù. Ivry Gitlis owned the 1713 &quot;Sancy&quot; Antonio Stradivari and a violin by Émile Marcel Français, Paris 1944 (won as a prize for the 1951 &quot;Thibaud Competition&quot;).

==Quotes==

* &quot;... don&#x27;t be so polite with the music, it&#x27;s like being in love!&quot; (IG, during a masterclass, 31 October 2011)
* &quot;Sheet music is a bunch of black marks; they have no significance ... I play violin, but in order to play well you have to be much more than a violin player. There is an entire world that lives together with it, like the currents in the ocean; and in any event, often I don&#x27;t use sheet music at all, but improvise.&quot; (IG, October 2012)
* &quot;... rubato is the art of playing in tempo...&quot; (IG)
* (on answering the question: &quot;what is your motto?&quot;) &quot;... to be alive, to be aware, to hear, to know, to feel, to see, to love, to be loved a little bit sometimes.&quot; (IG, July 2011)

==Family==
Ivry Gitlis was married from 1959 to 1960 to American director and writer Sandra Hochman; also to French Actress , with whom he had one child, Raphaëlle; and until his death was married to German actress , mother of three of his four children, Nessie, David and Johnathan.

Since the end of the 1960s, Gitlis resided in Paris, France. He died there on 24 December 2020 at the age of 98.

<text>Endtroducing... is the debut studio album by American music producer DJ Shadow, released on September 16, 1996, by Mo&#x27; Wax. It is an instrumental hip hop work composed almost entirely of samples from vinyl records. DJ Shadow produced &quot;Endtroducing&quot; over two years, using an Akai MPC60 sampler and little other equipment. He edited and layered samples to create new tracks of varying moods and tempos.

In the United Kingdom, where DJ Shadow had already established himself as a rising act, &quot;Endtroducing&quot; received praise from music journalists at the time of its release, and reached the top 20 of the UK Albums Chart. It was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. Mo&#x27; Wax issued four singles from the album, including the chart hits &quot;Midnight in a Perfect World&quot; and &quot;Stem&quot;. It took considerably longer for &quot;Endtroducing&quot; to find success in the United States. After promoting the album and returning to his hometown of Davis, California, DJ Shadow devoted his time to creating new music. During this period, interest in &quot;Endtroducing&quot; began to build among the American music press, and it peaked at number 37 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums chart.

&quot;Endtroducing&quot; was ranked highly on various lists of the best albums of 1996, and has been acclaimed by critics as one of the greatest albums of the 1990s. It is considered a landmark recording in instrumental hip hop, with DJ Shadow&#x27;s sampling techniques and arrangements leaving a lasting influence. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Endtroducing&quot; 329th on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

==Background==
As a high school student, DJ Shadow experimented with creating music from samples using a four-track recorder, inspired by sample-based music such as &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot; (1988) by the hip hop group Public Enemy. He began his music career in 1989 as a disc jockey for the University of California, Davis campus radio station KDVS. His KDVS work impressed A&amp;R representative Dave &quot;Funken&quot; Klein, who signed him to the Hollywood Basic label to produce music and remixes. DJ Shadow&#x27;s output for Hollywood Basic, including the 1993 single &quot;Entropy&quot; and his work with the SoleSides crew, brought him to the attention of English musician James Lavelle, who signed DJ Shadow to his Mo&#x27; Wax label.

DJ Shadow&#x27;s first two singles for Mo&#x27; Wax, &quot;In/Flux&quot; (1993) and &quot;Lost and Found (S.F.L.)&quot; (1994), utilized samples from &quot;used-bin&quot; vinyl records, blending elements of hip hop, funk, soul, jazz, rock, and ambient music. The singles were acclaimed by the British music press, and soon DJ Shadow and other Mo&#x27; Wax artists came to be viewed as leading practitioners of a nascent genre that the press termed &quot;trip hop&quot; – a name coined by &quot;Mixmag&quot; journalist Andy Pemberton in June 1994 to describe &quot;In/Flux&quot; and similar tracks being played in London clubs. In the summer of 1994, DJ Shadow started producing his first album. He completed around half of the record, but Mo&#x27; Wax opted to instead issue the finished music as a single – &quot;What Does Your Soul Look Like&quot; – the following year. As a result, DJ Shadow began work on his debut album anew. He was intent on capturing the same feel of his three Mo&#x27; Wax singles, and chose the title &quot;Endtroducing...&quot; for the album as &quot;it signified the fourth and final chapter in a series of pieces that I was doing for Mo&#x27; Wax with a certain sound, a certain tone, a certain atmosphere.&quot;

==Production==
DJ Shadow began production on &quot;Endtroducing&quot; in 1994 in his California apartment, before moving to the Glue Factory, the San Francisco home studio of his colleague Dan the Automator. Shadow strove to create an entirely sample-based album. His setup was minimal, with only three main pieces of equipment: an Akai MPC60 sampler, a Technics SL-1200 turntable and an Alesis ADAT tape recorder. He used the MPC60 for almost all composition. DJ Shadow bought it in 1992 at the suggestion of DJ Stretch Armstrong, who recommended it as a more advanced alternative to the &quot;industry standard&quot; sampler at the time, the E-mu SP-1200; according to DJ Shadow, the SP-1200 &quot;had been around for like four years, the sound was well established, and it had some real audio limitations in terms of the bit rate and stuff&quot;.

DJ Shadow sampled vinyl albums and singles accumulated from his trips to Rare Records, a record shop in his native Sacramento, where he spent several hours each day searching for music. His routine is depicted in the 2001 documentary film &quot;Scratch&quot;. The &quot;Endtroducing&quot; album cover is a photograph taken at Rare Records by B Plus, showing producer Chief Xcel and rapper Lyrics Born (the latter wearing a wig), who like DJ Shadow were members of the SoleSides collective. ABB Records founder Beni B (wearing a baseball cap) is also seen in the full version of the photograph, which appears in the album&#x27;s liner notes.

&quot;Endtroducing&quot; samples music of various genres, including jazz, funk, and psychedelia, as well as films and interviews. DJ Shadow programmed, chopped, and layered samples to create tracks. He opted to sample more obscure selections, making it a rule to avoid sampling popular material. Though he also used samples of prominent artists such as Björk and Metallica, DJ Shadow said that &quot;if I use something obvious, it&#x27;s usually only to break my own rules.&quot; Minor vocal contributions were provided by Lyrics Born and another SoleSides member, rapper Gift of Gab, as well as DJ Shadow&#x27;s then-girlfriend Lisa Haugen. He finished recording &quot;Endtroducing&quot; in early 1996.

==Composition==
DJ Shadow describes his albums as &quot;really varied&quot;, and said of &quot;Endtroducing&quot;: &quot;I feel like &#x27;Organ Donor&#x27; sounds nothing like &#x27;The Number Song&#x27; which sounds nothing like &#x27;Midnight&#x27; and on and on.&quot; He said he was often depressed during the production of the album and that his &quot;feelings of self-doubt and self-esteem come through in the music.&quot;

&quot;Endtroducing&quot; is opened by &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot;, a sound collage of record scratches and hip hop vocal samples. &quot;Building Steam with a Grain of Salt&quot; is built around a looped piano line sampled from Jeremy Storch&#x27;s &quot;I Feel a New Shadow&quot;, with various other musical elements entering throughout the track, including samples of an interview with drummer George Marsh, a women&#x27;s choir, bass fills, electronically altered drum kicks, and funk guitar. &quot;The Number Song&quot; uses multiple drum breaks and vocal samples of count-offs. &quot;Changeling&quot; deviates from the previous uptempo tracks, incorporating new-age sounds and gradually building toward a &quot;sublimely spacey&quot; coda. It segues into the first of three &quot;transmission&quot; interludes placed throughout the album, each featuring a sample from the 1987 John Carpenter film &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;. &quot;What Does Your Soul Look Like (Part 4)&quot; layers wordless chants over a looped bass groove, creating what &quot;Paste&quot;″s Mark Richardson describes as an &quot;uneasy&quot; techno soundscape. Track six is an untitled interlude featuring a man reciting a monologue about a woman and her sisters over a funk backing.

The two-part &quot;Stem/Long Stem&quot; begins the second half of &quot;Endtroducing&quot;. John Bush of AllMusic called the track a &quot;suite of often melancholy music, a piece that consistently refuses to be pigeonholed into any musical style.&quot; The first half, &quot;Stem&quot;, sets strings against a recurring sequence of erratic drum beats, before giving way to the more ethereal &quot;Long Stem&quot;, followed by &quot;Transmission 2&quot;. &quot;Mutual Slump&quot; features &quot;dreamy&quot; female spoken vocals and prominent samples of Björk&#x27;s &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot;. The sparse &quot;Organ Donor&quot; juxtaposes an organ solo and a drum break. &quot;Why Hip Hop Sucks in &#x27;96&quot; is a brief interlude featuring a repeating G-funk-esque beat, over which a voice shouts &quot;It&#x27;s the money&quot;. DJ Shadow composed the track to express his dissatisfaction with the state of commercial hip hop music in the mid-1990s.

&quot;Midnight in a Perfect World&quot; mixes a soulful vocal line with a slow drum beat. It samples the bassline from Pekka Pohjola&#x27;s &quot;The Madness Subsides&quot;, as well as elements of David Axelrod&#x27;s piano composition &quot;The Human Abstract&quot;. &quot;Napalm Brain/Scatter Brain&quot; progresses slowly, starting with a bassline and a drum loop, then gradually increasing in tempo as additional instrumentation enters the mix. The track eventually reaches its climax and deconstructs itself, leaving a single string sample playing by its conclusion. &quot;Endtroducing&quot; ends &quot;on an up note&quot; with &quot;What Does Your Soul Look Like (Part 1 – Blue Sky Revisit)&quot;, which is anchored by warm saxophone and keyboard hooks. A third and final &quot;transmission&quot; closes the album with the spoken words &quot;It is happening again&quot;, sampled from the David Lynch television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Endtroducing&quot; was released by Mo&#x27; Wax on September 16, 1996, in the United Kingdom. In the United States, it was issued by Mo&#x27; Wax and FFRR Records on November 19, 1996. DJ Shadow promoted the album through various interviews and press appearances. The record spent three weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number 17, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry in 1998. It also charted at number 75 in the Netherlands. &quot;Midnight in a Perfect World&quot; was previously issued as the album&#x27;s first single on September 2, 1996, and it was later released to American college and modern rock radio stations in January 1997. It peaked at number 54 on the UK Singles Chart, while its music video, directed by B Plus, received much airplay on MTV&#x27;s electronic music program &quot;Amp&quot;. &quot;Stem&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on October 28, 1996, reaching number 74 in the UK and number 14 in Ireland. &quot;What Does Your Soul Look Like (Part 1)&quot; followed on January 12, 1998, charting at number 54 in the UK. A fourth and final single – a double A-side release featuring producer Cut Chemist&#x27;s remix of &quot;The Number Song&quot; and DJ Shadow&#x27;s remix of the synth-pop band Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Painkiller&quot; – was issued on February 23, 1998.

Describing the time spent promoting &quot;Endtroducing&quot; as &quot;some weird rollercoaster ride&quot;, DJ Shadow was dismayed by the lack of reaction upon returning to his hometown of Davis, compared to the attention he had received within the British music scene. He felt he had been manipulated by the press and his record label and &quot;went from being angry to being depressed&quot; over the perceived lack of control he had over his life. DJ Shadow found himself compelled to produce new tracks such as &quot;High Noon&quot; as outlets for expressing his turbulent feelings at the time. Following this period, interest in his work grew in the US; newspapers ran stories on &quot;Endtroducing&quot; and DJ Shadow received several phone calls a day, enough to convince him to hire a manager. &quot;Endtroducing&quot; eventually entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums chart and peaked at number 37 on the listing in April 1997.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Endtroducing&quot; received critical acclaim. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; praised the album as &quot;an undeniable hip-hop masterpiece&quot; showing &quot;DJ Shadow remembers that sampling is an art form&quot;, while &quot;Q&quot; reviewer Martin Aston described it as &quot;a cinematically broad spectrum so deftly layered that the sampling-is-stealing argument falls flat&quot;. David Bennun from &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the record was &quot;not only one of the most daring and original albums of recent times, but also one of the loveliest&quot;, and in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, he wrote: &quot;I am, I confess, totally confounded by it. I hear a lot of good records, but very few impossible ones... You need this record. You are incomplete without it.&quot; Robert Christgau commented in &quot;Playboy&quot; that &quot;Endtroducing&quot; consists of &quot;not so much songs as compositions&quot;, and also claimed that while listeners unfamiliar with the album&#x27;s style of music would not find its tracks as powerful, &quot;they are so rich and eclectic, and spun out with such a sense of flow, that this album establishes the kind of convincing aural reality other British techno experimenters only fantasize about.&quot; Author and rock critic Greil Marcus penned a glowing review of the album in &quot;Artforum&quot;, where he called it &quot;absolutely modern – which is to say ambient-dreamy and techno-abstract&quot; and &quot;quite brilliant throughout&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Jon Wiederhorn likened &quot;Endtroducing&quot; to &quot;a surreal film soundtrack on which jazz, classical, and jungle fragments are artfully blended with turntable tricks and dialogue snippets&quot; and said that it &quot;takes hip-hop into the next dimension.&quot; Tony Green of &quot;JazzTimes&quot; commended DJ Shadow&#x27;s &quot;unerring ear for motif and texture&quot;, and Simon Williams of &quot;NME&quot; called him &quot;both slyly knowing and brilliantly naive, fusing the dramatic and the deranged to his own sweet end.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot;″s Sia Michel said that the album &quot;practically folds you into its symphonic fantasia, the coming-of-age story of a 24-year-old bunk-bed dreamer.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Jason Fine found that while &quot;Endtroducing&quot; occasionally lapses into less interesting &quot;moody atmospherics&quot;, &quot;even in the record&#x27;s mellowest moments, Shadow&#x27;s allegiance to the hard beats of hip-hop saves him&quot;.

&quot;Endtroducing&quot; appeared in numerous publications&#x27; lists of the best albums of 1996. The album topped year-end lists by &quot;Muzik&quot; and &quot;OOR&quot;, and placed second in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s. It was voted fourth place in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for 1996. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, named &quot;Endtroducing&quot; the best album of the year. The album also ranked in the top ten of year-end lists by &quot;The Face&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, and &quot;Vox&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Endtroducing&quot; has appeared in critics&#x27; lists of the greatest albums. Publications such as &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Spin&quot; have placed it on their lists of best albums of the 1990s. Robert Christgau named it among his 10 favorite albums from the decade. NPR listed &quot;Endtroducing&quot; as one of the 300 most important American records of the 20th century, and &quot;Time&quot; selected the record as one of the &quot;All-&quot;Time&quot; 100 Albums&quot; in 2006. It was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Endtroducing&quot; number 329 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

&quot;Guinness World Records&quot; cited &quot;Endtroducing&quot; as the first album created entirely from samples. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it &quot;not only a major breakthrough for hip-hop and electronica, but for pop music.&quot; It was a driving force in the development of instrumental hip hop music, inspiring numerous DJs and producers to create sample-based works. Tim Stelloh of &quot;PopMatters&quot; cited it as the &quot;benchmark&quot; for the genre. Will Hermes called &quot;Endtroducing&quot; &quot;trip-hop&#x27;s crowning achievement&quot; in &quot;Spin&quot;, and Jeff Weiss of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that it defined American trip hop. Music journalist Trey Zenker described it as a &quot;plunderphonics masterpiece&quot; in an essay for Tidal, while Turk Dietrich of the American experimental music duo Belong said that it was a nearly unrivaled masterwork of sampledelia. &quot;Endtroducing&quot; inspired the British rock band Radiohead to edit and loop drums on their 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;. Several artists sampled on &quot;Endtroducing&quot;, including David Axelrod and British rock band Nirvana, praised the album. DJ Shadow expressed surprise at the album&#x27;s stature: &quot;After the record, I&#x27;d always bump into these world-class producers who&#x27;d say, &#x27;Yeah, &quot;Endtroducing&quot; – what a great piece of production.&#x27; I just did it on one sampler in a tiny little studio.&quot;

Andy Battaglia of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; suggested that the influence of &quot;Endtroducing&quot; may have had a negative effect on the album itself, saying that it &quot;has been partially diluted by the symphonic beat-collage culture it helped spawn.&quot; The acclaim set high expectations for future releases by DJ Shadow, and he expressed his dissatisfaction with being expected to &quot;repeat &quot;Endtroducing&quot; over and over again&quot;. Nonetheless, DJ Shadow clarified that he views the album in a positive light: &quot;People always seem to suggest that there&#x27;s this pressure, and that &quot;Endtroducing&quot; is some kind of albatross, and I&#x27;ve just honestly never felt that way. I think that I have a healthy enough respect for the lineage of the music and how rare it is that you can connect with an audience. If that will always be &#x27;the record&#x27; then so be it, that&#x27;s cool.&quot; By April 26, 2005, &quot;Endtroducing&quot; had sold more than 290,000 copies in the US alone.

===Reissues===
A deluxe edition of &quot;Endtroducing&quot; was released on June 6, 2005. It includes a second disc, &quot;Excessive Ephemera&quot;, comprising alternate takes, demos, B-sides, remixes, and a live track, as well as new sleeve photographs and notes about the making of the album. A second deluxe edition commemorating the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, the &quot;Endtrospective&quot; edition, was released on October 28, 2016, featuring &quot;Excessive Ephemera&quot;, the remix album &quot;Endtroducing... Re-Emagined&quot;, and additional sleeve photographs and notes. A 25th-anniversary reissue was released on September 24, 2021. The reissue was remastered at half speed at Abbey Road Studios from DJ Shadow&#x27;s original DAT recording.

<text>The olive bee-eater or Madagascar bee-eater (Merops superciliosus) is a near passerine bee-eater species in the genus &quot;Merops&quot;. It is native to the southern half of Africa where it is present in Angola; Botswana; Burundi; Comoros; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Djibouti; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Kenya; Madagascar; Malawi; Mayotte; Mozambique; Namibia; Rwanda; Somalia; South Sudan; Sudan; Tanzania; Uganda; Zambia; Zimbabwe. It is a common species with a wide range so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated their conservation status as &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the olive bee-eater in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected on the island of Madagascar. He used the French name &quot;Le guespier de Madagascar&quot; and the Latin &quot;Apiaster Madagascariensis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the olive bee-eater. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the current binomial name &quot;Merops superciliosus&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The specific name &quot;superciliosus&quot; is Latin for &quot;supercilious&quot;, &quot;haughty&quot; or &quot;eye-browed&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;M. s. superciliosus&quot; Linnaeus, 1766 – east Africa, Madagascar and the Comoro Islands
* &quot;M. s. alternans&quot; Clancey, 1971 – west Angola and northwest Namibia

==Description==
The olive bee-eater grows to a length of with its tail streamers adding up to . The sexes are similar, and adults have bronzy-green plumage with an olive cap and white forehead, eyebrows, chin and cheeks. The rump and tail are blue, apart from the streamers, which are black.

==Distribution==
The olive bee-eater is found in the grassland and coastal mountain forests of East Africa and Madagascar, and an isolated population can be found in coastal Angola. There are two subspecies; &quot;M. s. superciliosus&quot; occurs in eastern Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, and southwards through East Africa to southern Mozambique and the Zambezi Valley, as well as the Comoro Islands and Madagascar; &quot;M. s. alternans&quot; occurs in western Angola and northwestern Namibia.

==Ecology==
They are partially migratory, and usually breed only in the southern portion of their range, moving north for the dry season in southern Africa. It lays four eggs in a burrow nest at the beginning of the southern African wet season, and the chicks usually hatch at the beginning of December. Unlike most bee-eaters, the species does not practice cooperative breeding and post-fledging dependence is only around 19 days, which is typical of temperate zone passerines and about half that of most Meropidae species.

<text>A utility pole, commonly referred to as a transmission pole, telephone pole, telecommunication pole, power pole, hydro pole, telegraph pole, or telegraph post, is a column or post used to support overhead power lines and various other public utilities, such as electrical cable, fiber optic cable, and related equipment such as transformers and street lights while depending on its application. They are used for two different types of power lines: &quot;sub transmission lines&quot;, which carry higher voltage power between substations, and &quot;distribution lines&quot;, which distribute lower voltage power to customers.

Electrical wires and cables are routed overhead on utility poles as an inexpensive way to keep them insulated from the ground and out of the way of people and vehicles. Utility poles are usually made out of wood, aluminum alloy, metal, concrete, or composites like fiberglass. A Stobie pole is a multi-purpose pole made of two steel joists held apart by a slab of concrete in the middle, generally found in South Australia.

The first poles were used in 1843 by telegraph pioneer William Fothergill Cooke, who used them on a line along the Great Western Railway. Utility poles were first used in the mid-19th century in America with telegraph systems, starting with Samuel Morse, who attempted to bury a line between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., but moved it above ground when this system proved faulty. Today, underground distribution lines are increasingly used as an alternative to utility poles in residential neighborhoods, due to poles&#x27; perceived ugliness, as well as safety concerns in areas with large amounts of snow or ice build up. They have also been suggested in areas prone to hurricanes and blizzards as a way to reduce power outages.

==Use==

Utility poles are commonly used to carry two types of electric power lines: &quot;distribution lines&quot; (or &quot;feeders&quot;) and &quot;sub transmission lines&quot;. Distribution lines carry power from local substations to customers. They generally carry voltages from 4.6 to 33 kilovolts (kV) for distances up to , and include transformers to step the voltage down from the primary voltage to the lower secondary voltage used by the customer. A service drop carries this lower voltage to the customer&#x27;s premises.

Subtransmission lines carry higher voltage power from regional substations to local substations. They usually carry 46 kV, 69 kV, or 115 kV for distances up to . 230 kV lines are often supported on H-shaped towers made with two or three poles. Transmission lines carrying voltages of above 230 kV are usually not supported by poles, but by metal pylons (known as transmission towers in the US).

For economic or practical reasons, such as to save space in urban areas, a distribution line is often carried on the same poles as a sub transmission line but mounted under the higher voltage lines; a practice called &quot;underbuild&quot;. Telecommunication cables are usually carried on the same poles that support power lines; poles shared in this fashion are known as joint-use poles, but may have their own dedicated poles.

==Description==

The standard utility pole in the United States is about tall and is buried about in the ground. In order to meet clearance regulations, poles can, however, reach heights of at least 120 feet (40 meters). They are typically spaced about apart in urban areas, or about in rural areas, but distances vary widely based on terrain. Joint-use poles are usually owned by one utility, which leases space on it for other cables. In the United States, the National Electrical Safety Code, published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) (not to be confused with the National Electrical Code published by the National Fire Protection Association [NFPA]), sets the standards for construction and maintenance of utility poles and their equipment.

===Pole materials===
Most utility poles are made of wood, pressure-treated with some type of preservative for protection against rot, fungi and insects. Southern yellow pine is the most widely used species in the United States; however, many species of long straight trees are used to make utility poles, including Douglas fir, jack pine, lodgepole pine, western red cedar, and Pacific silver fir.

Traditionally, the preservative used was creosote, but due to environmental concerns, alternatives such as pentachlorophenol, copper naphthenate and borates are becoming widespread in the United States. In the United States, standards for wood preservative materials and wood preservation processes, along with test criteria, are set by ANSI, ASTM, and American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) specifications. Despite the preservatives, wood poles decay and have a life of approximately 25 to 50 years depending on climate and soil conditions, therefore requiring regular inspection and remedial preservative treatments. Woodpecker damage to wood poles is the most significant cause of pole deterioration in the U.S.

Other common utility pole materials are aluminum, steel and concrete, with composites (such as fiberglass) also becoming more prevalent. One particular patented utility pole variant used in Australia is the Stobie pole, made up of two vertical steel posts with a slab of concrete between them.

===Power distribution wires and equipment===

On poles carrying both electrical and communications wiring, the electric power distribution lines and associated equipment are mounted at the top of the pole above the communication cables, for safety. The vertical space on the pole reserved for this equipment is called the &quot;supply space&quot;. The wires themselves are usually uninsulated, and supported by insulators, commonly mounted on a horizontal beam (). Power is transmitted using the three-phase system, with three wires, or phases, labeled &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;.

Sub transmission lines comprise only these 3 wires, plus sometimes an overhead ground wire (OGW), also called a &quot;static line&quot; or a &quot;neutral&quot;, suspended above them. The OGW acts like a lightning rod, providing a low resistance path to ground thus protecting the phase conductors from lightning.

Distribution lines use two systems, either grounded-wye (&quot;Y&quot; on electrical schematics) or delta (Greek letter &quot;Δ&quot; on electrical schematics). A delta system requires only a conductor for each of the three phases. A grounded-wye system requires a fourth conductor, the neutral, whose source is the center of the &quot;Y&quot; and is grounded. However, &quot;spur lines&quot; branching off the main line to provide power to side streets often carry only one or two phase wires, plus the neutral. A wide range of standard distribution voltages are used, from 2,400 V to 34,500 V. On poles near a service drop, there is a pole-mounted step-down distribution transformer to transform the high distribution voltage to the lower secondary voltage provided to the customer. In North America, service drops provide 240/120 V split-phase power for residential and light commercial service, using cylindrical single-phase transformers. In Europe and most other countries, 230 V three phase (230Y400) service drops are used. The transformer&#x27;s primary is connected to the distribution line through protective devices called fuse cutouts. In the event of an overload, the fuse melts and the device pivots open to provide a visual indication of the problem. They can also be opened manually by linemen using a long insulated rod called a hot stick to disconnect the transformer from the line.

The pole may be grounded with a heavy bare copper or copper-clad steel wire running down the pole, attached to the metal pin supporting each insulator, and at the bottom connected to a metal rod driven into the ground. Some countries ground every pole while others only ground every fifth pole and any pole with a transformer on it. This provides a path for leakage currents across the surface of the insulators to get to ground, preventing the current from flowing through the wooden pole which could cause a fire or shock hazard. It provides similar protection in case of flashovers and lightning strikes. A surge arrester (also called a lightning arrester) may also be installed between the line (ahead of the cutout) and the ground wire for lightning protection. The purpose of the device is to conduct extremely high voltages present on the line directly to ground.

If uninsulated conductors touch due to wind or fallen trees, the resultant sparks can start wildfires. To reduce this problem, aerial bundled conductors are being introduced.

===Communication cables===
The communications cables are attached below the electric power lines, in a vertical space along the pole designated the &quot;communications space&quot;. The communications space is separated from the lowest electrical conductor by the &quot;communication worker safety zone&quot;, which provides room for workers to maneuver safely while servicing the communication cables, avoiding contact with the power lines.

The most common communication cables found on utility poles are copper or fibre-optic cable (FOC) for telephone lines and coaxial cable for cable television (CATV). Coaxial or optical fibre cables linking computer networks are also increasingly found on poles in urban areas. The cable linking the telephone exchange to local customers is a thick cable lashed to a thin supporting cable, containing hundreds of twisted pair subscriber lines. Each twisted pair line provides a single telephone circuit or local loop to a customer. There may also be FOCs interconnecting telephone exchanges. Like electrical distribution lines, communication cables connect to service drops when used to provide local service to customers.

===Other equipment===
Utility poles may also carry other equipment such as street lights, supports for traffic lights and overhead wires for electric trolleys, and cellular network antennas. They can also carry fixtures and decorations specific for certain holidays or events specific to the city where they are located.

Solar panels mounted on utility poles may power auxiliary equipment where the expense of a power line connection is unwanted.

Streetlights and holiday fixtures are powered directly from secondary distribution.

==Pole attachment hardware==

The primary purpose of pole attachment hardware is to secure the cable and associated aerial plant facilities to poles and to help facilitate necessary plant rearrangements. An aerial plant network requires high-quality reliable hardware to
*Structurally support the distribution cable plant
*Provide directional guying to accommodate lateral stresses created on the pole by pole line configurations and pole loading configuration
*Provide the physical support and protection for drop cable plant from the pole to the customer premises
*Transition cable plant from the aerial network to underground and buried plant
*Provide the means for safe and effective grounding, bonding, and isolation connections for the metallic and dielectric components of the network.
Functional performance requirements common to pole line hardware for utility poles made of wood, steel, concrete, or Fiber-Reinforced Composite (FRC) materials are contained in Telcordia GR-3174, &quot;Generic Requirements for Hardware Attachments for Utility Poles&quot;.

=== Attachment hardware by pole type ===

*Wood poles

:The traditional wood pole material provides great flexibility during placement of hardware and cable apparatus. Holes are easily drilled to fit the exact hardware needs and requirements. In addition, fasteners such as lags and screws are easily applied to wood structures to support outside plant (OSP) apparatus.

*Non-wood poles
:There are three main non-wood pole materials and structures on which the attachment hardware may be mounted: concrete, steel, and fiber-reinforced composite (FRC). Each material has intrinsic characteristics that need to be considered during the design and manufacture of the attachment hardware.

:*Concrete poles
::The most widespread use of concrete poles is in marine environments and coastal zones where excellent corrosion resistance is required to reduce the impact of sea water, salt fog, and corrosive soil conditions (e.g., marsh). Their heavy weight also helps the concrete poles resist the high winds possible in coastal areas.

::The various designs for concrete poles include tapered structures and round poles made of solid concrete; pre-stressed concrete (spun-cast or statically cast); and a hybrid of concrete and steel.

::The drilling of installed concrete poles is not feasible. Users may wish to have the attachment hardware cast into the concrete during the pole manufacture. As a result of these operational difficulties, banded hardware has become the more popular means to attach cable plant to concrete poles.
::Design criteria and requirements for concrete poles can be derived from various industry documents including, but not limited to, ASCE-111, ACI-318, ASTM C935, and ASTM C1089.

:*Steel poles

::Steel poles can provide advantages for high-voltage lines, where taller poles are required for enhanced clearances and longer span requirements. Tubular steel poles are typically made from 11-gauge galvanized steel, with thicker 10- or 7-gauge materials used for some taller poles because of their higher strength and rigidity. For tall tower-type structures, 5-gauge materials are used.

::Although steel poles can be drilled on-site with an annular drill bit or standard twist drill, it is not a recommended practice. As with concrete poles, bolt holes could be built into the steel pole during manufacture for use as general attachment points or places for steps to be bolted into the pole.

::Welding of attachment hardware or attachment ledges to steel poles may be a feasible alternate approach to help provide reliable attachment points. However, operational and practical hazards of welding in the field may make this process undesirable or uneconomical.

::Steel poles should meet industry specifications such as: TIA/EIA-222-G, &quot;Structural Standard for Antenna Supporting Structures and Antennas&quot; (current); TIA/EIA-222; &quot;Structural Standards for Steel&quot;; and TIA/EIA-RS-222, or an equivalent requirement set to help ensure a robust and good quality pole is being used.

:*Fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) poles
::FRC poles cover a family of pole materials that combine fiberglass (fiber) strength members with a cross-linked polyester resin and a variety of chemical additives to produce a lightweight, weather-resistant structure. FRC poles are hollow and similar to the tubular steel poles, with a typical wall thickness of with an outer polyurethane coating that is ~ thin.

::As with all the other non-wood poles, FRC poles cannot be mounted with the traditional climbing hardware of hooks and gaffs. FRC poles can be pre-drilled by the manufacturer, or holes can be drilled on site. Attachments using lag bolts, teeth, nails, and staples are unacceptable for FRC poles. Through-bolts are used instead of lag bolts for maximum bonding to the pole and to avoid loosening of hardware.

::The relevant industry documents covering FRC poles include: ASTM D4923, ANSI C136.20, OPCS-03-02, and Telcordia GR-3159, &quot;Generic Requirements for Fiber-Reinforced Composite (FRC), Concrete, and Steel Utility Poles&quot;.

==Access==

In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, utility poles have sets of brackets arranged in a standard pattern up the pole to act as hand and foot holds so that maintenance and repair workers can climb the pole to work on the lines. In the United States, such steps have been determined to be a public hazard and are no longer allowed on new poles. Linemen may use climbing spikes called gaffs to ascend wooden poles without steps on them. In the UK, boots fitted with steel loops that go around the pole (known as &quot;Scandinavian Climbers&quot;) are also used for climbing poles. In the US, linemen use bucket trucks for the vast majority of poles that are accessible by vehicle.

==Dead-end poles==

The poles at the end of a straight section of utility line where the line ends or angles off in another direction are called &quot;dead-end&quot; poles in the United States. Elsewhere they may be referred to as anchor or termination poles. These must carry the lateral tension of the long straight sections of wire. They are usually made with heavier construction. The power lines are attached to the pole by horizontal strain insulators, either placed on crossarms (which are either doubled, tripled, or replaced with a steel crossarm, to provide more resistance to the tension forces) or attached directly to the pole itself.

Dead-end and other poles that support lateral loads have guy-wires to support them. The guys always have strain insulators inserted in their length to prevent any high voltages caused by electrical faults from reaching the lower portion of the cable that is accessible by the public. In populated areas, guy wires are often encased in a yellow plastic or wood tube with reflectors attached to their lower end, so that they can be seen more easily, reducing the chance of people and animals walking into them or vehicles crashing into them.

Another means of providing support for lateral loads is a push brace pole, a second shorter pole that is attached to the side of the first and runs at an angle to the ground. If there is no space for a lateral support, a stronger pole, e.g. a construction of concrete or iron, is used.
==History==
The system of suspending telegraph wires from poles with ceramic insulators was invented and patented by British telegraph pioneer William Fothergill Cooke. Cooke was the driving force in establishing the electrical telegraph on a commercial basis. With Charles Wheatstone he invented the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph and founded the world&#x27;s first telegraph company, the Electric Telegraph Company. Telegraph poles were first used on the Great Western Railway in 1843 when the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph line was extended to Slough. The line had previously used buried cables but that system had proved troublesome with failing insulation. In Britain, the trees used for telegraph poles were either native larch or pine from Sweden and Norway. Poles in early installations were treated with tar, but these were found to last only around seven years. Later poles were treated instead with creosote or copper sulphate for the preservative.

Utility poles were first used in the mid-19th century in America with telegraph systems. In 1844, the United States Congress granted Samuel Morse $30,000 () to build a 40-mile telegraph line between Baltimore, Maryland and Washington, D.C. Morse began by having a lead-sheathed cable made. After laying underground, he tested it. He found so many faults with this system that he dug up his cable, stripped off its sheath, bought poles and strung his wires overhead. On February 7, 1844, Morse inserted the following advertisement in the Washington newspaper: &quot;Sealed proposals will be received by the undersigned for furnishing 700 straight and sound chestnut posts with the bark on and of the following dimensions to wit: &#x27;Each post must not be less than eight inches in diameter at the butt and tapering to five or six inches at the top. Six hundred and eighty of said posts to be 24 feet in length, and 20 of them 30 feet in length.&#x27;&quot;

In some parts of Australia, wooden poles are rapidly destroyed by termites, so metal poles must be used instead and in much of the interior wooden poles are vulnerable to fire. The Oppenheimer pole is a collapsible wrought iron pole in three sections. It is named after Oppenheimer and Company in Germany, but they were mostly manufactured in England under license. They were used on the Australian Overland Telegraph Line built in 1872 which connected the continent north to south directly through the centre and linked to the rest of the world through a submarine cable at Darwin. The Stobie pole was invented in 1924 by James Cyril Stobie of the Adelaide Electric Supply Company and first used in South Terrace, Adelaide.

One of the early Bell System lines was the Washington DC–Norfolk line which was, for the most part, square-sawn tapered poles of yellow pine probably treated to refusal with creosote. &quot;Treated to refusal&quot; means that the manufacturer forces preservatives into the wood, until it refuses to accept more, but performance is not guaranteed.
Some of these were still in service after 80 years. The building of pole lines was resisted in some urban areas in the late 19th century, and political pressure for undergrounding remains powerful in many countries.

In Eastern Europe, Russia, and third-world countries, many utility poles still carry bare communication wires mounted on insulators not only along railway lines, but also along roads and sometimes even in urban areas. Errant traffic being uncommon on railways, their poles are usually less tall. In the United States electricity is predominately carried on unshielded aluminum conductors wound around a solid steel core and affixed to rated insulators made from glass, ceramic, or poly. Telephone, CATV, and FOCs are generally attached directly to the pole without insulators.

In the United Kingdom, much of the rural electricity distribution system is carried on wooden poles. These normally carry electricity at 11 or 33 kV (three phases) from 132 kV substations supplied from pylons to distribution substations or pole-mounted transformers. Wooden poles have been used for 132 kV for a number of years from the early 1980s one is called the trident they are usually used on short sections, though the line from Melbourne, Cambs to near Buntingford, Herts is quite long. The conductors on these are bare metal connected to the posts by insulators. Wood poles can also be used for low voltage distribution to customers.

Today, utility poles may hold much more than the uninsulated copper wire that they originally supported. Thicker cables holding many twisted pair, coaxial cable, or even fibre-optic, may be carried. Simple analogue repeaters or other outside plant equipment have long been mounted against poles, and often new digital equipment for multiplexing/demultiplexing or digital repeaters may now be seen. In many places, as seen in the illustration, providers of electricity, television, telephone, street light, traffic signal and other services share poles, either in joint ownership or by renting space to each other. In the United States, ANSI standard 05.1.2008 governs wood pole sizes and strength loading. Utilities that fall under the Rural Electrification Act must also follow the guidelines set forth in RUS Bulletin 1724E-150 (from the US Department of Agriculture) for pole strength and loading.

Steel utility poles are becoming more prevalent in the United States thanks to improvements in engineering and corrosion prevention coupled with lowered production costs. However, premature failure due to corrosion is a concern when compared to wood. The National Association of Corrosion Engineers or NACE is developing inspection, maintenance, and prevention procedures similar to those used on wood utility poles to identify and prevent decay.

==Markings==

===Pole brandings===
British Telecom posts are usually marked with the following information:
* &#x27;BT&#x27; – to mark it as a British Telecom UK Pole (This can also be PO (Post Office) or GPO (General Post Office) depending on the age of the pole)
* a horizontal line marking 3 metres from the bottom of the pole
* the pole length, typically 8 to 10 metres, and size. 9L is a 9 metres long, light pole, other letters used are &#x27;M&#x27; (Medium) and &#x27;S&#x27; (Stout).
* the year of treatment and therefore generally the year of installation (e.g. the pole in the picture was treated in 2003)
* the batch and type of wood used
* A date of the last official inspection
* An alphanumeric designation e.g. DP 242 where DP is an initialism of Distribution Point
* If relevant, a red D plate meaning &#x27;Dangerous&#x27; and indicating that the pole was structurally unsafe to climb or due to its proximity to other hazards

The date on the pole is applied by the manufacturer and refers to the date the pole was &quot;preserved&quot; (treated to withstand the elements).
In the United States, utility poles are marked with information concerning the manufacturer, pole height, ANSI strength class, wood species, original preservative, and year manufactured (vintage) in accordance with ANSI standard O5.1.2008. This is called branding, as it is usually burned into the surface; the resulting mark is sometimes called the &quot;birth mark&quot;. Although the position of the brand is determined by ANSI specification, it is essentially just below &quot;eye level&quot; after installation. A rule of thumb for understanding a pole&#x27;s brand is the manufacturer&#x27;s name or logo at the top with a two-digit date beneath (sometimes preceded by a month).

Below the date is a two-character wood species abbreviation and one- to three-character preservative. Some wood species may be marked &quot;SP&quot; for southern pine, &quot;WC&quot; for western cedar, or &quot;DF&quot; for Douglas fir. Common preservative abbreviations are &quot;C&quot; for creosote, &quot;P&quot; for pentachlorophenol, and &quot;SK&quot; for chromated copper arsenate (originally referred to salts type K). The next line of the brand is usually the pole&#x27;s ANSI class, used to determine maximum load; this number ranges from 10 to H6 with a smaller number meaning higher strength. The pole&#x27;s height (from butt to top) in 5-foot increments is usually to the right of the class separated by a hyphen, although it is not uncommon for older brands to have the height on a separate line. The pole brand is sometimes an aluminum tag nailed in place.

Before the practice of branding, many utilities would set a 2- to 4-digit date nail into the pole upon installation. The use of date nails went out of favor during World War II due to war shortages but is still used by a few utilities. These nails are considered valuable to collectors, with older dates being more valuable, and unique markings such as the utilities&#x27; name also increasing the value. However, regardless of the value to collectors, all attachments on a utility pole are the property of the utility company, and unauthorized removal is a misdemeanor or felony. (California state law cited as example)

===Coordinates on pole tags===

A practice in some areas is to place poles on coordinates upon a grid. The pole at right is a Delmarva Power pole located in a rural area of the state of Maryland in the United States. The lower two tags are the &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; coordinates along said grid. Just as in a coordinate plane used in geometry, X increases as one travels east and Y increases as one travels north. The upper two tags are specific to the sub transmission section of the pole; the first refers to the route number, the second to the specific pole along the route.

However, not all power lines follow the road. In the British region of East Anglia, EDF Energy Networks often add the Ordnance Survey Grid Reference coordinates of the pole or substation to the name sign.

In some areas, utility pole name plates may provide valuable coordinate information: a poor man&#x27;s GPS.

== Pole route ==
A pole route (or pole line in the US) is a telephone link or electrical power line between two or more locations by way of multiple uninsulated wires suspended between wooden utility poles. This method of link is common especially in rural areas where burying the cables would be expensive. Another situation in which pole routes were extensively used were on the railways to link signal boxes. Traditionally, prior to around 1965, pole routes were built with open wires along non-electrical operated railways; this necessitated insulation when the wire passed over the pole, thus preventing the signal from becoming attenuated.

At electrical operated railways, pole routes were usually not built as too much jamming from the overhead wire would occur. To accomplish this, cables were separated using spars with insulators spaced along them; in general four insulators were used per spar. Only one such pole route still exists on the UK rail network, in the highlands of Scotland. There was also a long section in place between Wymondham, Norfolk and Brandon in Suffolk, United Kingdom; however, this was de-wired and removed during March 2009.

==Environmental impact==
Utility poles are used by birds for nesting and to rest on. Utility poles and related structures are regarded by some to be a form of visual pollution. Many lines are placed underground for this reason, in places of high population density or scenic beauty that justify the expense. Architects design some pylons to be pretty, thus avoiding visual pollution.

Some chemicals used to preserve wood poles including creosote and pentachlorophenol are toxic and have been found in the environment.

The considerable improvement in weathering resistance offered by creosote infusion has long-term drawbacks. In recent years, concerns have been raised about the toxicity of creosote-treated wood waste, such as utility poles. Specifically, their biodegradation can release phenolic compounds in soil, which are considered toxic. Research continues to explore methods to render this waste safe for disposal.

Historically, pole-mounted transformers were filled with a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) liquid. PCBs persist in the environment and have adverse effects on animals.

<text>Celestyn Czaplic (6 April 1723 – 23 May 1804) of the Kierdeja coat of arms was a Polish–Lithuanian szlachcic, politician, writer and a poet. Remembered for his humorous poetry and impeccable moral character, he was a deputy to numerous Sejms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and a marshal of the Sejm of 1766. He held the offices of podczaszy, podkomorzy, and finally, from 1773, of the Master of the Hunt of the Crown. He was the recipient of the Order of Saint Stanislaus and the Order of the White Eagle.

==Biography==
He was born on 6 April 1723 in Volhynia to the noble Czaplic family. His father Ignaczy Czaplic, was a podstoli of Kiev in the Kiev Voivodeship. He attended schools in Volhynia, and spent time at the court of the magnate and prince Antoni Lubomirski. Later, he became an ally of the Czartoryski family.

He became the podczaszy of Kiev in 1746. He was elected a deputy to the Crown Tribunal and the Sejms of 1752, 1754, 1758, 1766 and 1767–68 (the infamous Repnin Sejm). The 1766 Sejm, lasting from October 6 to November 29, was the one where he held the position of the marshal of the Sejm, and thus it was also known as the &quot;Czaplic&#x27;s Sejm&quot;. He became the podkomorzy of Łuck in the Volhynia Voivodeship in 1765; he was known there, as he served as a local judge for some time prior to receiving his new title and office. He received the Order of Saint Stanislaus in 1766 (soon after received much praise for his marshal-ship of the 1766 Sejm).

In 1767 he joined the Radom Confederation. His participation in the Sejm of 1767–68, which bowed to the Russian demands, earned him condemnation from the opposition, particularly from the supporters of the Bar Confederation; despite that, he was still a popular figure, and highly considered by the king. In 1773 he received the office and title of Master of the Hunt of the Crown (łowczy koronny), which he held to 1783. Between 1778–80 he was a member of the Permanent Council. He unsuccessfully campaigned for the position of the Deputy Chancellor of the Crown. During the Great Sejm of 1788–1792 he served as a member of the Military Commission.

He also participated in the &quot;Thursday Dinners&quot; organized by king Stanisław August Poniatowski.

He was a knight of the Order of the White Eagle from 1775.

Friend of the dramatist Franciszek Bohomolec, he has been described as &quot;open and friendly&quot;, &quot;extremely jolly and witty&quot;, also well versed in sarcasm. He was interested in sciences, and had a sizable library. He was also famous among his contemporaries for his absent-mindedness, but also for his righteousness and impeccable moral character; it is said then when contemporaries at the royal court in Warsaw were considering questions of morality, they would ask themselves &quot;What would Czaplic think of that?&quot; This became a mildly popular proverb in Poland around the time of his life.

As a writer and poet he has authored fairy tales, idyls, and similar forms of light poetry, some of it published anonymously. He was known to improvise humorous poems and songs on the fly, which he would often perform himself, accompanying himself on a violin. He might have been the author of a popular festive song, &quot;Kurdesz nad kurdeszami&quot;, however his authorship of it is not certain.

He married Anna Drzewicka, and they had two daughters, Tekla and Teresa. He died on 23 May 1804 in Warsaw, where he spent the last decade of his life.

<text>The shaka sign, sometimes known as &quot;hang loose&quot; is a gesture with friendly intent often associated with Hawaii and surf culture. It consists of extending the thumb and smallest finger while holding the three middle fingers curled, and gesturing in salutation while presenting the front or back of the hand; the wrist may be rotated back and forth for emphasis. The shaka sign is similar to the letter Y in the American manual alphabet in American Sign Language or the sign for number six in the Chinese hand counting symbol. The shaka sign should not be confused with the sign of the horns, where the index and pinky fingers are extended and the thumb holds down the middle two fingers.

==Origins==
According to the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;, prevailing local lore credits the gesture to Hamana Kalili of Laie, who lost the three middle fingers of his right hand while working at the Kahuku Sugar Mill. Kalili was then shifted to guarding the sugar train, and his all-clear wave of thumb and pinkie is said to have evolved into the shaka as children imitated the gesture.

Another theory relates the origin of the shaka to the Spanish immigrants, who folded their middle fingers and took their thumbs to their lips as a friendly gesture to represent sharing a drink with the natives they met in Hawaii.

The late Lippy Espinda, a used car salesman and Oahu-based entertainer, has also been named as a possible creator of the shaka. Espinda, who frequently appeared as an extra in &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; as well as &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; episodes shot in Hawaii, used the term and the sign during his television ads in the &#x27;60s. Though the claim that he is the originator of the shaka sign is debatable, he is credited with increasing its popularity and that of Hawaiian Pidgin as well.

The word &quot;shaka&quot; is also used as an interjection expressing approval, which may predate its use for the shaka sign. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; the origin of the word is uncertain, but it may come from Japanese, where it is a byname for the Buddha.
== Meaning and use ==
Residents of Hawaii use the shaka to convey the &quot;Aloha Spirit&quot;, a concept of friendship, understanding, compassion, and solidarity among the various ethnic cultures that reside in Hawaii, lacking a direct semantic to literal translation. Drivers will often use it on the road to communicate distant greetings along with gratitude. A bill making it the state&#x27;s official gesture passed the legislature in 2024.

In the Honolulu public transport system (TheBus and Skyline), HOLO card readers display the shaka sign (along with a ukulele tone) when a card is tapped.

In Hawaii, the shaka sign is known as &quot;hang loose&quot; and is popular in surfer culture.

There are several emoticon representations of the shaka sign, including \,,/, \m/, and \,,_. The earliest known use of the first two, with three commas or a lower case &quot;m&quot; corresponding to a hand&#x27;s three middle fingers, is from 2006. The last, similar to the first except that it represents the thumb extended horizontally (as if perpendicular to the wrist) is reported, together with the first form, from Brigham Young University in 2016.

==Similar gestures==

===Chinese number gestures===

The sign has some similarities to the Chinese number gesture for &quot;six&quot;.

===Beverages===
The sign can also be used to indicate the imbibing of a bottled drink, either alcoholic or non-alcoholic, as attested to below, by placing the thumb to the mouth and motioning the little finger upward as if tipping up a bottle&#x27;s bottom end. A similar meaning can be achieved by pressing the thumb up against the tip of the nose with the little finger raised upwards parallel to the bridge of the nose. It is referred to as &quot;schooies&quot; in Australia (Australian slang for a schooner)

===Telecommunications===
With the thumb held near the ear and the little finger pointed at the mouth, the gesture is commonly understood to mimic the handset of a traditional landline telephone, and depending on context can be understood to stand for &quot;call me&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll call you&quot;, or &quot;let&#x27;s talk on the phone&quot;.

The Unicode 9.0 emoji 🤙 &quot;Call me hand&quot; can be interpreted as the shaka sign.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the shaka sign is a gang salute for the Mongrel Mob, but is not commonly used for this purpose. It can also serve as a greeting, meaning &quot;Chur&quot;, which is a friendly gesture between friends, similar to in Hawaii where it is used in the same context.

===Austrian Leiwand===
A similar gesture was common among criminals in Vienna in 1935, accompanying the word of approval or appreciation &quot;Leiwand&quot;.

==Usage examples==
Since 2015, fans of Brigham Young University (which has a satellite campus in Hawai&#x27;i and is also known colloquially as &quot;the Y&quot;) have started using the gesture, in deference to newly hired Kalani Sitake, BYU&#x27;s Polynesian head football coach, and because of its similarity with the letter Y in the American manual alphabet in American Sign Language. It is also used as a nod of respect to Hamana Kalili, a native Hawaiian Latter-day Saint who, according to locals, is the founder of the popular sign. 

In 2024, Filipino P-pop girl group BINI which initially coined by one of its members Sheena through her catchy phrase, &quot;Eyyy ka muna, eyyy,&quot; with a matching hand gesture has taken the internet by storm.

<text>In particle physics, Yukawa&#x27;s interaction or Yukawa coupling, named after Hideki Yukawa, is an interaction between particles according to the Yukawa potential. Specifically, it is between a scalar field (or pseudoscalar field) formula_1 and a Dirac field formula_2 of the type
The Yukawa interaction was developed to model the strong force between hadrons. A Yukawa interaction is thus used to describe the nuclear force between nucleons mediated by pions (which are pseudoscalar mesons).

A Yukawa interaction is also used in the Standard Model to describe the coupling between the Higgs field and massless quark and lepton fields (i.e., the fundamental fermion particles). Through spontaneous symmetry breaking, these fermions acquire a mass proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field. This Higgs-fermion coupling was first described by Steven Weinberg in 1967 to model lepton masses.

==Classical potential==
If two fermions interact through a Yukawa interaction mediated by a Yukawa particle of mass formula_3, the potential between the two particles, known as the &quot;Yukawa potential&quot;, will be:

formula_4

which is the same as a Coulomb potential except for the sign and the exponential factor. The sign will make the interaction attractive between all particles (the electromagnetic interaction is repulsive for same electrical charge sign particles). This is explained by the fact that the Yukawa particle has spin zero and even spin always results in an attractive potential. (It is a non-trivial result of quantum field theory that the exchange of even-spin bosons like the pion (spin 0, Yukawa force) or the graviton (spin 2, gravity) results in forces always attractive, while odd-spin bosons like the gluons (spin 1, strong interaction), the photon (spin 1, electromagnetic force) or the rho meson (spin 1, Yukawa-like interaction) yields a force that is attractive between opposite charge and repulsive between like-charge.) The negative sign in the exponential gives the interaction a finite effective range, so that particles at great distances will hardly interact any longer (interaction forces fall off exponentially with increasing separation).

As for other forces, the form of the Yukawa potential has a geometrical interpretation in term of the field line picture introduced by Faraday: The part results from the dilution of the field line flux in space. The force is proportional to the number of field lines crossing an elementary surface. Since the field lines are emitted isotropically from the force source and since the distance between the elementary surface and the source varies the apparent size of the surface (the solid angle) as the force also follows the  dependence. This is equivalent to the part of the potential. In addition, the exchanged mesons are unstable and have a finite lifetime. The disappearance (radioactive decay) of the mesons causes a reduction of the flux through the surface that results in the additional exponential factor formula_5 of the Yukawa potential. Massless particles such as photons are stable and thus yield only potentials. (Note however that other massless particles such as gluons or gravitons do not generally yield potentials because they interact with each other, distorting their field pattern. When this self-interaction is negligible, such as in weak-field gravity (Newtonian gravitation) or for very short distances for the strong interaction (asymptotic freedom), the potential is restored.)

==The action==
The Yukawa interaction is an interaction between a scalar field (or pseudoscalar field) and a Dirac field of the type
The action for a meson field formula_6 interacting with a Dirac baryon field formula_7 is

formula_8

where the integration is performed over dimensions; for typical four-dimensional spacetime , and formula_9

The meson Lagrangian is given by
formula_10

Here, formula_11 is a self-interaction term. For a free-field massive meson, one would have formula_12 where formula_3 is the mass for the meson. For a (renormalizable, polynomial) self-interacting field, one will have formula_14 where is a coupling constant. This potential is explored in detail in the article on the quartic interaction.

The free-field Dirac Lagrangian is given by
formula_15

where is the real-valued, positive mass of the fermion.

The Yukawa interaction term is 
formula_16

where is the (real) coupling constant for scalar mesons and

formula_17

for pseudoscalar mesons. Putting it all together one can write the above more explicitly as

formula_18

==Yukawa coupling to the Higgs in the Standard Model==
A Yukawa coupling term to the Higgs field affecting spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Standard Model is responsible for fermion masses in a symmetric manner.

Suppose that the potential formula_11 has its minimum, not at formula_20 but at some non-zero value formula_21 This can happen, for example, with a potential form such as formula_22. In this case, the Lagrangian exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. This is because the non-zero value of the formula_23 field, when operating on the vacuum, has a non-zero vacuum expectation value of formula_24

In the Standard Model, this non-zero expectation is responsible for the fermion masses despite the chiral symmetry of the model apparently excluding them.
To exhibit the mass term, the action can be re-expressed in terms of the derived field formula_25 where formula_26 is constructed to be independent of position (a constant). This means that the Yukawa term includes a component
formula_27
and, since both and formula_28 are constants, the term presents as a mass term for the fermion with equivalent mass formula_29 This mechanism is the means by which spontaneous symmetry breaking gives mass to fermions. The scalar field formula_30 is known as the Higgs field.

The Yukawa coupling for any given fermion in the Standard Model is an input to the theory. The ultimate reason for these couplings is not known: it would be something that a better, deeper theory should explain.

==Majorana form==
It is also possible to have a Yukawa interaction between a scalar and a Majorana field. In fact, the Yukawa interaction involving a scalar and a Dirac spinor can be thought of as a Yukawa interaction involving a scalar with two Majorana spinors of the same mass. Broken out in terms of the two chiral Majorana spinors, one has
formula_31

where is a complex coupling constant, is a complex number, and is the number of dimensions, as above.

<text>Land reform in South Vietnam refers to reforms proposed by the United States and implemented by South Vietnam. Seeking to undermine the popularity of the communist Việt Minh&#x27;s policies of land redistribution to poor peasants, the government of South Vietnam implemented their own land-redistribution policies during the Vietnam War. 

Early reforms enacted by the South Vietnamese government in the 1950s largely failed, as the ordinances prescribed by the government often attempted to directly undo the already-popular land reforms of the Việt Minh, requiring poor peasants to pay to acquire land that the communists had already given to them. During the 1960s, such programs were rendered defunct and unenforceable due to the South Vietnamese army&#x27;s inability to control farmland territories against the Viet Cong.

In the 1970s, South Vietnam implemented the &quot;Land to the Tiller&quot; reform with the aid of the United States. This program was more successful than earlier programs, and was almost entirely underwritten by the United States. The reform program was discontinued in 1975 following South Vietnam&#x27;s defeat in the Vietnam War and the unification of Vietnam.

Following the unification, the government of Vietnam attempted to carry out further land reform in the southern part of the country in order to develop its transformation to a socialist economy. This attempt at reform was met with difficulties, and did not achieve its goals.

== Background ==

Following World War II, the communist Việt Minh (the predecessor of Viet Cong) fought against the French colonialists and their local supporters (mainly landowners) in the First Indochina War. 
At the time, a large percentage of agricultural land was owned by powerful landowners and the majority of the rural population of Vietnam owned only small plots of land (with little legal assurance) or were simply landless peasants. 
The early success of the land reform program under the Viet Minh gave the communists a strong base of support among the 80% of the Vietnamese people who lived in rural areas.

Prior to the provisional separation of North and South Vietnam, emperor Bao Dai in 1953 responded to the Viet Minh program of land redistribution and rent reduction with a decree declaring that rents for land should not exceed 15 percent of the crop. The decree was unenforceable and rendered null by a failing colonial government and, in any case, contained loopholes that could have been exploited by landlords.

From 1954 to 1975 land reform in Vietnam was pursued on two separate channels and regions as the country was provisionally divided into two parts: South Vietnam (The Republic of Vietnam) and North Vietnam (the Democratic Republic of Vietnam), resembling the current partition of Korea. Communist North Vietnam and its southern proxies, the Viet Cong, adopted a policy of confiscating the land of landlords and rich peasants by force and redistributing it to poor and landless peasants, thus organizing the rural population into collectives.

==Land reform during the Vietnam War==
Capitalist South Vietnam failed in several land reform endeavors before finally achieving some success with the &quot;Land to the Tiller&quot; program in the early 1970s that was almost fully devised and supported by the United States, which considered it to be part of their policy of the Vietnamization of the war.

=== Early land reform ordinances ===
In 1954, South Vietnam&#x27;s ally, the United States, advised the new government of South Vietnam, headed by Ngo Dinh Diem, to undertake &quot;indispensable reforms&quot; including land reform. In response on 8 January 1955, Diem adopted Ordinance No. 2, which capped rental of land at 25 percent of production. In October 1956, Diem adopted Ordinance No. 57 which forbade ownership by an individual of more than of rice land and prescribed the conditions and terms under which the excess land expropriated from the rich could be transferred to landless less-wealthy farmers. The U.S. would pay the landowners and receive payment from the purchasers over a 6-year period. The U.S. believed land reform was important for buildling support for the government and threatened to cut aid unless land reform and other changes were made. Under the program the government acquired from 1958 to 1961 and distributed . The land redistributed thus comprised less than 10 percent of the 7.5 million acres of cultivated land in South Vietnam.

The land reform program implemented under Ordinance 57 was unpopular in the countryside. The Viet Minh had already divided up the land -- &quot;fairly,&quot; in the words of one official. The government&#x27;s program was less generous to the majority of farmers than had been the Viet Minh redistribution of land in areas which it controlled. The amount of land that individuals were permitted to retain was large, farmers were required to pay for land they acquired under the program, and the program was riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Many rural people believed that the United States army and the government of South Vietnam were on the side of the landlords. Military operations by the U.S. and South Vietnamese armies to clear communist insurgents from an area would often result in landlords reclaiming land previously abandoned or confiscated and redistributed by the Viet Minh or Viet Cong.

Support for the Vietcong was driven by resentment of Diem&#x27;s reversal of Viet Minh land reforms in the countryside. The Viet Minh had confiscated large private landholdings, reduced rents and debts, and leased communal lands, mostly to poorer peasants. Diem brought the landlords back, people who had been farming land for years had to return it to landlords and pay years of back rent. Marilyn B. Young wrote that &quot;The divisions within villages reproduced those that had existed against the French: 75% support for the NLF, 20% trying to remain neutral and only 5% firmly pro-Saigon government&quot;.

Ordinance 57 resulted in the reverse of what was the objective of land reform advocates: large landowners and landlords increased their influence, especially in the important rice-growing area of the Mekong Delta. The ordinance remained in effect until 1970, but was largely unutilized after 1960 as the Viet Cong insurgents took control or disputed government control of most of the rural areas of South Vietnam.

=== Land to the Tiller ===
The Land to the Tiller project carried out in Vietnam from 1970 to 1973 was based on a proposal by Roy Prosterman, a prominent American &quot;land-rights activist&quot;, who the US government of the time recruited within its efforts against Viet Cong in South Vietnam. Drawing on experiences in other countries (particularly in Latin America), Prosterman proposed a &quot;land-to-the-tiller&quot; program to compete with the Viet Cong for the allegiance of the peasants. The plan mimicked the communists&#x27; land expropriation strategy, coupled with monetary compensation to the former landowners.

On 26 March 1970, with the war still underway, the government of South Vietnam began implementation of the Land-to-the-Tiller program following Prosterman&#x27;s model. In total, the United States financed 339 million US dollars of the reform&#x27;s 441 million dollars of expenses. Individual holdings were limited to 15 hectares. Legal titles were extended to peasants in areas under control of the South Vietnamese government to whom land had previously been distributed by the Viet Cong.

===Analysis===
Bernard B. Fall a prominent war correspondent, historian, political scientist, and expert on Indochina during the 1950s and 1960s, claimed that delayed land reform in South Vietnam had played such a fundamental role in the Vietnam War that it was as important as &quot;ammunition for howitzers.&quot; South Vietnam&#x27;s ally and financial supporter, the United States, either failed to realise the importance of land reform in a timely fashion or was not able to persuade the South Vietnamese government of its importance. Andrew Biggs, at researcher at the University of Washington argues that the &quot;Land to the Tiller&quot; program of the early 1970s was too little, too late to swing the war in the favour of the US.

In the words of an American official, Robert Samson &quot;The Americans (lost the war because) they offered the peasant a constitution; the Viet Cong offered him his land and with it the right to survive&quot;.

==Land reform in southern Vietnam after reunification==

According to Trung Dinh Dang, a scholar at the Cornell School of Government and Politics Of Asia and The Pacific, the Vietnamese Communist Party struggled to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture in the south of Vietnam following the unification of the country. The contemporary party leaders initially considered land reform initiatives to be a temporary measure toward mass collectivisation.

<text>Gil Shaham (Hebrew: גיל שחם; born February 19, 1971) is an American violinist. His accolades include a Grammy Award in 1999, and he has performed as a soloist with such orchestras as the New York Philharmonic, Berlin Philharmonic, Vienna Philharmonic, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, Russian National Orchestra, Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, and the Orchestre de Paris.

==Biography==
Gil Shaham was born in Urbana, Illinois, while his Israeli parents were on an academic fellowship at the University of Illinois. His father, Jacob, was an astrophysicist and his mother, Meira Diskin, was a cytogeneticist. His sister is the pianist Orli Shaham. His brother, Shai Shaham, is the head of the Laboratory of Developmental Genetics at Rockefeller University.

When he was two years old, the family moved to Jerusalem, where he started violin lessons at the Rubin Academy of Music aged seven, winning annual scholarships from the America-Israel Cultural Foundation. He went on to graduate from the Horace Mann School in New York. He attended the Aspen Music Festival and School in Colorado, studying with Dorothy DeLay and Jens Ellermann, and won a scholarship to the Juilliard School. He and his sister Orli also studied at Columbia University.

Shaham lives in New York City and teaches at Bard College Conservatory of Music. He is married to violinist Adele Anthony. They have three children.

==Music career==

Shaham debuted as a soloist with the Jerusalem Symphony at age 10. He performed with the Israel Philharmonic—Israel&#x27;s foremost orchestra—less than a year later. Shaham won first prize in the Claremont Competition at age 11, and was admitted to Juilliard, where he studied with Dorothy DeLay and Hyo Kang.

Shaham&#x27;s career advanced in 1989 when, while a senior at Horace Mann, he replaced an ailing Itzhak Perlman to perform the Bruch and Sibelius violin concertos with the London Symphony Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.

Shaham won the Avery Fisher Career Grant in 1990, and the Premio Internazionale of the Accademia Chigiana in Siena in 1992.

Shaham has performed with the New York Philharmonic, Berlin Philharmonic, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Vienna Philharmonic, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Russian National Orchestra, Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, National Symphony Orchestra and National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America.

Shaham has played the &quot;Comtesse de Polignac&quot;, a Stradivarius violin of 1699 on loan from the Stradivarius Society of Chicago since 1989.

<text>Joe Colquhoun (7 November 1926 – 13 April 1987) was a British comics artist best known for his work on &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot; in &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot;. He was also the first artist to draw &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Harrow, Middlesex, Joe Colquhoun served in the Royal Navy during World War II, and won a place at Kingston School of Art on his return. His career in comics began in 1951 in Jungle Trails, and he went on to work for IPC Media on titles such as &quot;Lion&quot;, and later &quot;Tiger&quot;, where he drew &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; for six years, from 1954 to 1960, despite having no interest in football.

In the early 1970s he worked mainly for IPC&#x27;s humour comics &quot;Buster&quot; and &quot;Cor!!&quot;, until Battle Picture Weekly came along in 1976. For Battle he drew &quot;Soldier Sharp: the Rat of the Rifles&quot; and &quot;Johnny Red&quot; before editor Dave Hunt assigned him to work on Pat Mills&#x27; First World War story &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot; in 1978.

After &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot; finished in 1986 Colquhoun drew for &quot;Mask&quot; until his death from a heart attack in 1987.

<text>Peter David Klein (born September 17, 1940) is an American philosopher specializing in issues in epistemology who spent most of his career at Rutgers University.

==Education and career==

He received a BA at Earlham College (1962), and an MA (1964) and PhD from Yale University (1966).

He taught at Colgate University as an assistant professor from 1966 to 1970. Following that, he moved to Rutgers University, where he taught as an assistant professor from 1970 to 1973, an associate professor from 1973 to 1981, and a full professor from 1981 until retiring from Rutgers in 2016.

==Philosophical work==

Klein is widely known for his work on skepticism. His most influential work, however, is on the nature of knowledge, where he has long defended the defeasibility theory. His recent work defends infinitism about justification. On this view, to be justified in believing P is to possess a reason R1 to believe P, and a reason R2 to believe R1, and a reason R3...and so on, ad infinitum. Justification is, so to speak, &quot;turtles all the way down.&quot; He has also recently advocated a picture of knowledge according to which one can have knowledge of p even if the justification for the belief of p is essentially based on false premises. Klein calls these &quot;useful falsehoods&quot;.

Klein authored one book: &quot;Certainty: A Refutation of Skepticism&quot; (1982) (University of Minnesota Press), and co-edited &quot;Ad Infinitum: New Essays on Epistemological Infinitism&quot; (Oxford University Press) with John Turri. He has published a number of articles, chapters, and reviews in epistemology.

<text>Jonathan Joseph Heder (; born October 26, 1977) is an American actor and comedian. He is best known for his breakout lead role as the title character of the comedy film &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; (2004). He also voiced the character in the Fox animated series of the same name (2012).

Heder has had starring roles in the comedy films &quot;The Benchwarmers&quot; (2006), &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot; (2006), &quot;Blades of Glory&quot; (2007), &quot;Mama&#x27;s Boy&quot; (2007), &quot;When in Rome&quot; (2010), &quot;Reality&quot; (2014), and &quot;Ghost Team&quot; (2016). He also had starring roles in the drama films &quot;For Ellen&quot; (2012) and &quot;Walt Before Mickey&quot; (2015). Heder had starring voice roles in the animated film &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; (2007) and its sequel, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up 2: WaveMania&quot; (2017), as well as &quot;Thelma the Unicorn&quot; (2024). He had a main voice role on the Disney XD animated series &quot;Pickle and Peanut&quot; (2015–2018).

== Early life ==

Heder was born on October 26, 1977, in Fort Collins, Colorado, the son of Helen (née Brammer) and physician James Heder. He has an identical twin brother, Dan; an older sister, Rachel; an older brother, Doug; and two younger brothers, Adam and Matt. He is of Swedish descent, and is a nephew by marriage of former NFL player Vai Sikahema. When he was about two years old, he and his parents moved to Salem, Oregon. He attended Walker Middle School in Salem and graduated from South Salem High School in 1996, where he was a member of the swim team and drama club. He is also an Eagle Scout, and served as a Scoutmaster in 2010.

A 2002 alumnus of Brigham Young University, Heder worked on the short animated film &quot;Pet Shop&quot;. While attending BYU, he befriended Jared Hess and starred in Hess&#x27; short film &quot;Peluca&quot;, which was later expanded into &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;.

== Career ==
The 2004 comedy feature &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;, filmed in Preston, Idaho, earned $44.5 million. In June 2005, Heder received the MTV Movie Award for Best Musical Performance and Breakthrough Male Performance for the role. On October 8, 2005, he hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with musical guest Ashlee Simpson. Heder and his film co-star Efren Ramirez filmed a series of commercials to promote the 2005 Utah State Fair, and reprised their roles in a self-parody sketch, &quot;Napoleon Bonamite&quot;, on the animated series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;.

In 2005, Heder had a supporting role as a clerk in a new age bookstore in the romantic comedy &quot;Just like Heaven&quot;. In 2006, he appeared in the comedy film &quot;The Sasquatch Gang;&quot; and had a starring role with Rob Schneider and David Spade in producer Adam Sandler&#x27;s &quot;The Benchwarmers&quot; (2006), a comedy about three men making up for lost chances by creating their own Little League baseball team. Also in 2006, Heder was the voice of the character Skull in the animated film &quot;Monster House&quot;, and starred in the comedy &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot;, opposite Billy Bob Thornton and Jacinda Barrett. He co-starred in 2007 with Will Ferrell in the well-received &quot;Blades of Glory&quot; (2007) where, as in many of his films, he plays an absurd, slapstick caricature—this time, one of two rival figure skaters who must team up in a pairs competition.

Heder&#x27;s second turn at voice acting came in 2007 when he voiced Chicken Joe, a surfing chicken, in the animated film &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;. His first foray into web television was the 2008 web series &quot;Woke Up Dead,&quot; which he produced and starred in. The live-action, sci-fi comedy thriller follows Drex, a USC student who wakes up underwater in the bathtub one morning and suspects he may be dead.

Heder and his twin brother, Dan, star together as villains in the fourth installment of the popular internet martial arts comedy series &quot;Sockbaby&quot;. Heder&#x27;s performance in &quot;When in Rome&quot; was praised by &quot;New York Times&quot; critic A. O. Scott: &quot;Jon Heder as a goofy street magician is the funniest of the bunch.&quot; Heder voiced Napoleon Dynamite in the Fox Network animated series &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;, which debuted in January 2012. In 2013, Heder appeared in the music video for &quot;On Top of the World&quot; with numerous other Utah-based actors and musicians, and in 2014 he appeared in the music video for the Chromeo song &quot;Old 45s&quot;.

In January 2017, Heder reprised his role as Chicken Joe in &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up 2: WaveMania&quot;, the direct-to-video sequel to &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;. In 2022, it was announced that Heder would star in the comedy film &quot;Plan B&quot;, alongside Tom Berenger and Shannon Elizabeth.

In 2024, Heder reunited with Hess in &quot;Thelma the Unicorn&quot;, an animated film starring Brittany Howard.

== Personal life ==
Heder served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Japan, and speaks Japanese fluently.
Heder has been married to Kirsten Bales since 2002, having met her while attending Brigham Young University. They are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and have four children.

<doc id="1324425" wikidata="Q2568463" url="?curid=1324425" title="Al Aaraaf">
<text>&quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; is an early poem by American writer Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1829. It tells of the afterlife in a place called Al Aaraaf, inspired by A&#x27;raf as described in the Quran. At 422 lines, it is Poe&#x27;s longest poem.

&quot;Al Aaraaf&quot;, which Poe said he wrote before he was 15, was first published as the major poem in Poe&#x27;s 1829 collection &quot;Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems&quot;. The book and &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; in particular received mostly negative reviews for its complexity, obscure references, and odd structure. Some, however, noted the potential in the young poet, including author and critic John Neal, to whom Poe had shown &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; prior to publication. Poe later referred to Neal&#x27;s response as the first words of encouragement he had received. Nevertheless, the negative response to &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; may have inspired Poe&#x27;s later poetic theory that poems should be kept short.

Years later, in 1845, Poe used &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; to hoax members of the Boston literary circle during a reading. Poe said the poem was a new one and his audience was perplexed by it. He later said a Boston crowd did not deserve a new poem. He held a strong dislike for New England poets and the New England–based Transcendental movement and hoped by presenting a poem he had written in his youth would prove Bostonians did not know good literature.

==Overview==
&quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; is the longest poem Poe wrote and was inspired by Tycho Brahe&#x27;s identification of a supernova in 1572 which was visible for about seventeen months. Poe identified the supernova with Al Aaraaf, a star that was the place between paradise and hell. Al Aaraaf (Arabic , alternatively transliterated ) was a place where people who have been neither markedly good nor markedly bad had to stay until forgiven by God and let into Paradise, as discussed in Sura 7 of the Qur&#x27;an. As Poe explained to a potential publisher:
In the opening section of the poem, God commands Nesace, a name for Beauty&#x27;s spirit, to convey a message to &quot;other worlds&quot;. Nesace rouses the angel Ligeia and tells her to awaken the other thousand seraphs to perform God&#x27;s work. Two souls, however, fail to respond: the &quot;maiden-angel&quot; Ianthe and her &quot;seraph-lover&quot; Angelo (Michelangelo), who describes his death on earth and the flight of his spirit to Al Aaraaf. Ianthe and Angelo are lovers, and their failure to do as Nesace commanded results in God not allowing them into heaven.

==Analysis==
&quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; is thick with allusions and, because of this, is often avoided by scholars because, as writer Arthur Hobson Quinn notes, it can be &quot;unintelligible&quot;. Nevertheless, Quinn says it possesses qualities which are important to understand the development of Poe&#x27;s skills as a poet. &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; mixes historical facts, religious mythology and elements of Poe&#x27;s imagination. The poem primarily focuses on the afterlife, ideal love, and ideal beauty in relation to passion. The majority of the poem focuses on this reaching for ideal beauty and aesthetics. Characters in the poem serve as representative symbols of personified emotions. The goddess Nesace is beauty, Ligeia represents the music in nature, Ianthe and Angelo are creatures of passion.

The poem draws from Sura 7 (Arabic الأعراف) in the Quran; Poe also drew upon the Quran in other works, including &quot;The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade&quot;. In &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot;, Poe was probably less interested in the Quran itself and more interested in an atmosphere of the exotic or otherworldliness. The true setting of the poem is a sort of dreamscape or alternative world. As critic Floyd Stovall wrote, the theme of the poem is &quot;one of disillusionment with the world and escape into some more congenial realm of dream or of the imagination&quot;.

The star which prompted Poe to write &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; was believed to foretell disaster or that humanity would be punished for breaking God&#x27;s laws. Poe may have gotten the idea to base a poem on Brahe&#x27;s astronomical discovery from poet John Keats&#x27;s use of the 1781 discovery of the planet Uranus in a poem called &quot;On First Looking into Chapman&#x27;s Homer&quot; (1816). The name of the star has been changed from &quot;Al Orf&quot; to &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; to become similar to the word &quot;arafa&quot;, which means distinguishing between things. Additionally, Poe was indebted to Irish poet Thomas Moore, whose poem &quot;Lalla-Rookh&quot; inspired, among other parts of &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot;, the catalogue of flowers near the beginning. Another work by Moore, &quot;The Loves of the Angels&quot;, inspired Poe&#x27;s idea of uniting mortal and immortal love.

Structurally, the 422-line &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; has no discernible or consistent poetic rhythm, though the meter resembles a section of Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;Manfred&quot;. Instead of formal structure, the poem focuses on the flow of sound. Poet Daniel Hoffman analyzed the fluctuating meter and determined that Part I begins as octosyllabic couplets then shifts to pentameter couplets with occasional interludes of alternately rhymed trimeter-dimeters. Part II generally uses pentameter couplets with an interlude of anapestic dimeters.

==Publication history==

Poe claimed he wrote &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; before he was 15 years old, though he would later adapt his claim. A few passages from the poem were first published in the May 19, 1829, issue of the &quot;Baltimore Gazette&quot; signed &quot;Marlow&quot;. Poe first offered the complete poem to publishers Carey, Lea &amp; Carey in Philadelphia around May 1829. He wrote to them, &quot;If the poem is published, succeed or not, I am &#x27;irrecoverably a poet.&#x27; But to your opinion I leave it&quot;. He met with Isaac Lea, who was willing to publish it so long as they were protected against any loss. Poe asked his foster-father John Allan to subsidize the printing but, not supportive of Poe&#x27;s literary pursuits, he refused. By July 28, Poe wrote to the publishers asking for the return of his manuscript because, as he said, he had &quot;made a better disposition of my poems than I had any right to expect&quot;.

&quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; finally saw print for the first time in the collection &quot;Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems&quot;. 250 copies of the 71-page work was issued by Hatch and Dunning of Baltimore, Maryland in December 1829. Though Poe had already self-published &quot;Tamerlane and Other Poems&quot;, he considered &quot;Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems&quot; his first book. Though this was not entirely true, it was the first work published with his name, signed &quot;Edgar A. Poe&quot;. Poe addressed the obscurity in &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; by including multiple footnotes, many of which were left untranslated from French, Latin, and Spanish. &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; was published in its entirety only once in Poe&#x27;s lifetime, though some critics believe Poe never actually completed the poem because Poe implied it was originally intended to have four parts or 400 lines.

==Critical response==
Upon publication, &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; and the other poems in Poe&#x27;s collection drew harsh criticism because of how difficult it was to understand. Among the early reviewers was John Hill Hewitt, who wrote of Poe that &quot;no man has been more shamefully overestimated&quot;. In trying to explain the title poem, he wrote, &quot;all our brain-cudgeling could not compel us to understand it line by line or the sum total&quot;. A reviewer for the &quot;Baltimore Minerva and Emerald&quot; asked, &quot;Has the poet been struck dumb with palsy?&quot; Before publication, Poe had sought the advice of William Wirt, who had earned a reputation as a distinguished man of letters in Baltimore. On &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot;, Wirt wrote that he was not the best judge of poetry but believed that it might be accepted by modern-thinking readers. As he wrote, &quot;but to deal candidly... (as I am bound to do) I should doubt whether the poem will take with old-fashioned readers like myself&quot;. Sarah Josepha Hale of &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot; noted that &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; must have been written by a young author because it was &quot;boyish, feeble, and altogether deficient in the common characteristics of poetry&quot;. Nevertheless, she still called the author a genius. A reviewer for the &quot;American Ladies&#x27; Magazine&quot; also commented on the poet&#x27;s age: &quot;[the] author who appears to be very young, is evidently a fine genius, but he wants judgment, experience, tact&quot;.

Poe boasted that these early poems were superior to most other examples in American poetry. Critic John Neal, who was a friend of Poe&#x27;s cousin George Poe, responded to Poe&#x27;s claim in his review of &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; for &quot;The Yankee and Boston Literary Gazette&quot;. He said Poe&#x27;s boast was &quot;rather exquisite nonsense&quot; but that the young author showed promise and predicted that some day Poe might &quot;make a beautiful and perhaps a magnificent poem&quot; to prove his claim. He believed that if future poems by Poe were as good as some of his best lines in &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot;:
Neal&#x27;s encouragement, which came prior to publication, led Poe to include a dedication to Neal in the collection &quot;Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems&quot;. Poe&#x27;s cousin Neilson Poe was impressed by Neal&#x27;s endorsement and wrote, &quot;&quot;Our&quot; name will be a great one &quot;yet&quot;.&quot; Edgar Poe would refer to Neal&#x27;s comments as &quot;the very first words of encouragement I remember to have heard.&quot; Poe himself admitted that &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; had some &quot;good poetry&quot; in it as well as &quot;much extravagance, which I have not had time to throw away&quot;.

In the 20th century, poet Daniel Hoffman referred to &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; as &quot;Poe&#x27;s most ambitious failure&quot;, suggesting it is a &quot;fractured&quot; attempt at an epic poem that &quot;ran out of gas&quot;. Biographer Jeffrey Meyers called it Poe&#x27;s &quot;most turgid and opaque poem&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; includes names Poe would later reuse: Ligeia and Zante. Some of the themes in the poem also foreshadow a future poem, &quot;The City in the Sea&quot; (1831). The critical failure of both &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; and &quot;Tamerlane&quot; convinced Poe that long poems are inherently flawed because they cannot sustain a proper mood or a high quality poetic form. Because of this, he never again experimented with long poetry. He would later write of his theory on short poetry in &quot;The Poetic Principle&quot; in 1848. In that essay, he wrote &quot;A long poem does not exist. I maintain that the phrase, &#x27;a long poem,&#x27; is simply a flat contradiction in terms.&quot; Instead, he says, epic poetry and other long poems are actually a series of short poems strung together. Critics have suggested that this theory was written so that Poe could justify why &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; was unpopular.
After the publication of &quot;The Raven&quot; in 1845, Poe became a household name and, having reached the height of his poetic fame, he was often asked to lecture or recite poetry at public events. One such invitation came from the Boston Lyceum in October 1845, arranged with help from James Russell Lowell. Poe had a strong dislike for the Boston literary scene and the city itself, despite having been born there. Nevertheless, he accepted the $50 fee and the challenge of writing a brand new poem for his appearance.

Fresh off his public feud with Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his dislike of the Massachusetts-based Transcendentalism movement, Poe instead decided to play a trick on his Boston audience. The program, held October 16 at Boston&#x27;s Odeon Theater, was a grand event and featured a speech by Massachusetts statesman Caleb Cushing which was two and a half hours long. Poe read &quot;Al Aaraaf&quot;, renamed &quot;The Messenger Star&quot; for the event, and tried to convince his Boston audience that the poem he wrote as a young man was new. The audience was confused by the obscure poem and many left during its recitation. Poe ended with &quot;The Raven&quot;, as the theater manager noted, &quot;thus enabling us to make some show of front after a most lamentable defeat.&quot;

Poe considered the hoax an opportunity to prove that Bostonians did not know good literature. Based on critical reaction, he believed he was right. The editor of the &quot;Boston Courier&quot; reviewed &quot;The Messenger Star&quot; as &quot;an elegant and classic production, based on the right principles, containing the essence of &quot;true&quot; poetry, mingled with a gorgeous imagination&quot;. When Poe claimed that he wrote the poem before he had turned 12, Cornelia Wells Walter of the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot; wrote of her shock: &quot;A poem delivered before a literary association of adults, as written by &quot;a boy!&quot; Only think of it!&quot; It is unclear how old Poe was at the time he wrote the poem because, in part, he frequently changed his claim. Lewis Gaylord Clark said Poe&#x27;s age at writing the poem was irrelevant and, though he admitted the audience did not know the author&#x27;s age, &quot;they only knew it was sad stuff&quot;. Modern biographer Daniel Stashower compared Poe&#x27;s stunt with the story &quot;The Imp of the Perverse&quot;, in which Poe wrote about &quot;an earnest desire to tantalize a listener... The speaker is aware that he displeases.&quot;

Upon his return to New York, Poe wrote in the &quot;Broadway Journal&quot; his view of the event. After noting that he refused to offer a didactic poem, he wrote: 

&quot;Al Aaraaf&quot; was used between 1928 and 1952 as a pen name by Glasgow artist Hannah Frank.
