<text>The sand partridge (Ammoperdix heyi) is a gamebird in the pheasant family Phasianidae of the order Galliformes, gallinaceous birds.

This partridge has its main native range from Egypt and Israel east to south Arabia. It is closely related and similar to its counterpart in southeast Turkey and east to Pakistan, the see-see partridge, &quot;Ammoperdix griseogularis&quot;.

This 22–25 cm bird is a resident breeder in dry, open and often hilly country. It nests in a scantily lined ground scrape laying 5–14 eggs. The sand partridge takes a wide variety of seeds and some insect food.

== Description ==
The sand partridge is a rotund bird, mainly sandy-brown with wavy white and brown flank stripes. It ranges from 22–25 cm in height, and 180-200 g in weight. Its wingspan ranges from 39–41 cm. They can live for up to 4 years.

When disturbed, sand partridge prefers to run rather than fly, but if necessary it flies a short distance on rounded wings. The song is a slurred &quot;kwa-kwa-kwa&quot;

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
Males are larger than the females and have orange bills, rather than dull yellowish bills. The male has a grey head with a white stripe in front of the eye and a white cheek patch. The neck sides are plain, and not speckled with white. The head pattern is the best distinction from the see-see partridge. Females are a very washed-out version of males. They are sandier and greyer than males with fewer markings and have pinkish bars instead of white spots on the side of the neck. Females are more difficult to distinguish from its relative due to the weak head pattern. Male and female juveniles resemble adult females.

== Taxonomy ==
The sand partridge is one of 185 species in the ground-living family Phasianidae, the most-species rich clade in the Galliformes order. The Phasianidae family has a subfamily Phasianinae, which was considered monophyletic up until the 1990s until molecular phylogenies showed that its placement is indeed paraphyletic. The Phasianinae subfamily has two acknowledged clades: the erectile clade and the non-erectile clade (an erectile trait is a feathery or fleshy region on the head that some birds possess. It mainly evolved as a sexual signal. The sand partridge is part of the non-erectile clade, as they do not possess an erectile trait. These two clades are believed to have diverged during the early Oligocene, around 30 million years ago.
== Habitat and distribution ==
=== Distribution ===
Sand partridges are endemic across the Middle East. Populations are distributed across Eastern Egypt, Eastern Sudan, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The four subspecies of the sand partridge are native to specific parts of the Middle East. The &quot;Ammoperdix heyi heyi&quot; is distributed from the Jordan Valley to the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula to Saudi Arabia. The &quot;Ammopredix heyi nicolli&quot; is distributed across Northern Egypt. The &quot;Ammoperdix heyo cholmleyi&quot; is distributed from Egypt to Northern Sudan. The &quot;Ammoperdix heyi intermedius&quot; is distributed from Western Saudi Arabia to Yemen east into Oman and to the Musandam Peninsula in the UAE.

=== Habitat ===
Sand partridges can be found in desert ecosystems with scattered vegetation and boulders. They prefer steep, boulder-strewn slopes with sandy-bottomed wadis and ridges up to 2000 m and valleys down to 400 m below sea level. Sand partridges are rarely found in large stretches of dry, flat, or open desert as they require a water source for drinking. The sand partridge is non-migratory, so it breeds and spends its year in these habitats.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

=== Vocalizations ===
Known vocalizations only for male sand partridges. Male&#x27;s signalling call is a &quot;kew-kew-kew&quot; or &quot;watcha-watcha-watcha&quot;. When alarmed or flushed, they emit a louder, higher &quot;quip&quot; or &quot;qu-ip&quot;, or a harsh &quot;wuit-wuit-wuit&quot;.

=== Diet ===
Sand partridges are omnivorous birds. They feed on a mixed diet of plant matter and insects. During the summer, the sand partridge forages mostly for seeds and berries. Seeds come mostly from &quot;Acacia&quot; spp. and grasses. Berries come mostly from the toothbrush tree/mustard tree (&quot;Salvadora persica&quot;) and myrrhs (&quot;Commiphora&quot; spp.). Insects are mostly locusts. In Arabia specifically, sand partridges eat leaves and buds of desert thorn (&quot;Lycium shawii&quot;), &quot;Rhazya stricta&quot; and &quot;Sideroxylon mascatense.&quot; Habitats with woody vegetation height of 2–3 m between rocks are ideal foraging grounds for the sand partridge, as it provides food and also sufficient shelter from predator attacks.

=== Reproduction ===
Breeding seasons are dependent on location. In Israel, sand partridges breed between February and August. In Jordan and Sinai, Egypt, eggs are laid between March and April, whereas are only laid in April in the Northern Africa region. Within the Arabian Peninsula, eggs are laid mainly in March and April, but have been seen in Oman and Yemen as late as between August and November. Sand partridges are probably monogamous birds, but nests have been seen merely 30–70 m apart in Israel, indicating one male mating with multiple females (see polygyny). Nests are built in three different fashions. One way is the sand partridge will sparsely line the nest with grass, feathers, bits of wood, or pebbles. The second way is the sand partridge will build the nest under the cover of bush or rock and leave the nest unlined. The third way is building the nest in hollows or crevices at the base of cliffs. Females lay between 5–14 eggs that are pale grey or pink. Two females may lay in the same nest. Incubation is by females only for around 21–24 days. Chicks are white with grey upper breast and pale throat. Chicks become fledges at 9–20 days, and then are full grown at 30 days. Sand partridges can be found in groups of dozens of members, but families may come together to form large flocks of up to 70 members in later summer/early autumn.

== Status and conservation ==
The sand partridge is listed as &#x27;Least Concern&#x27; by the IUCN. The sand partridge has a large range and is deemed common and stable in the regions it resides. The sand partridge has been introduced to two islands offshore of Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The estimated entire population of sand partridge pairs in Arabia is ~900,000 and is increasing. Sand partridges live in areas that are mainly inhabitable to humans, thus have minimal threats. Throughout Arabia, stock grazing, urbanization, drought, and climate change in general, all affect sand partridges but are not true threats. Additionally, sand partridges are hunted for sport and food, locally and nationally. Over the entire range of the sand partridges habitats, there are conservation sites present. A non-profit in Jordan known as the Jordan Outdoor Sport Association was established in 2014 to encourage sustainable hunting in the area. Releasing sand partridges to supplement hunted birds is part of their conservation work.

<doc id="1315693" wikidata="Q755719" url="?curid=1315693" title="Giant armadillo">
<text>The giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), colloquially tatu-canastra, tatou, ocarro or tatú carreta, is the largest living species of armadillo (although their extinct relatives, the glyptodonts, were much larger). It lives in South America, ranging throughout as far south as northern Argentina. This species is considered vulnerable to extinction.

The giant armadillo prefers termites and some ants as prey, and often consumes the entire population of a termite mound. It also has been known to prey upon worms, larvae and larger creatures, such as spiders and snakes, and plants. Some giant armadillos have been reported to have eaten bees by digging into beehives.

==Description==

The giant armadillo is the largest living species of armadillo, with 11 to 13 hinged bands protecting the body and a further three or four on the neck. Its body is dark brown in color, with a lighter, yellowish band running along the sides, and a pale, yellow-white head. These armadillos have around 80 to 100 teeth, which is more than any other terrestrial mammal. The teeth are all similar in appearance, being reduced premolars and molars, grow constantly throughout life, and lack enamel. They also possess extremely long front claws, including a sickle-shaped third claw up to in length, which are proportionately the largest of any living mammal. The tail is covered in small rounded scales and does not have the heavy bony scutes that cover the upper body and top of the head. The animal is almost entirely hairless, with just a few beige colored hairs protruding between the scutes.

Giant armadillos typically weigh around when fully grown, however a specimen has been weighed in the wild and captive specimens have been weighed up to . The typical length of the species is , with the tail adding another .

==Distribution and habitat==
Giant armadillos are found throughout much of northern South America east of the Andes, except for eastern Brazil and Paraguay. In the south, they reach the northernmost provinces of Argentina, including Salta, Formosa, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero. There are no recognised geographic subspecies. They primarily inhabit open habitats, with cerrado grasslands covering about 25% of their range, but they can also be found in lowland forests.

==Biology and behavior==

Giant armadillos are solitary and nocturnal, spending the day in burrows. They also burrow to escape predators, being unable to completely roll into a protective ball. Compared with those of other armadillos, their burrows are unusually large, with entrances averaging wide, and typically opening to the west.

Giant armadillos use their large front claws to dig for prey and rip open termite mounds. The diet is mainly composed of termites, although ants, worms, spiders, other invertebrates, small vertebrates and carrion are also eaten. Little is currently known about this species&#x27; reproductive biology, and no juveniles have ever been discovered in the field. The average sleep time of a captive giant armadillo is said to be 18.1 hours.
Some giant armadillos have been reported to have eaten bees by digging into beehives.

In a long-term study on the species, that started in 2003 in the Peruvian Amazon, dozens of other species of mammals, reptiles and birds were found using the giant armadillos&#x27; burrows on the same day, including the rare short-eared dog (&quot;Atelocynus microtis&quot;). Because of this, the species is considered a habitat engineer, and the local extinction of &quot;Priodontes&quot; may have cascading effects in the mammalian community by impoverishing fossorial habitat. Additionally, the giant armadillo was once key to controlling leaf cutter populations which could destroy crops, but they can also damage crops themselves when digging through soil.

Female giant armadillos have two teats and have a gestational period of about five months. Evidence points to only giving birth once every three years. Little is known with certainty about their life history, although it is thought that the young are weaned by about seven to eight months of age, and that the mother periodically seals up the entrance to burrows containing younger offspring, presumably to protect them from predators. Although they have never bred in captivity, a wild-born giant armadillo at San Antonio Zoo was estimated to have been around sixteen years old when it died.

==Threats==
Hunted throughout its range, a single giant armadillo supplies a great deal of meat, and is the primary source of protein for some indigenous peoples. In addition, live giant armadillos are frequently captured for trade on the black market, and invariably die during transportation or in captivity. Despite this species&#x27; wide range, it is locally rare. This is further exacerbated by habitat loss resulting from deforestation. Current estimates indicate the giant armadillo may have undergone a worrying population decline of 30 to 50 percent over the past three decades. Without intervention, this trend is likely to continue.

==Conservation==

The giant armadillo was classified as vulnerable on the World Conservation Union&#x27;s Red List in 2002, and is listed under Appendix I (threatened with extinction) of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna.

The giant armadillo is protected by law in Colombia, Guyana, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Suriname and Peru, and commercial international trade is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). However, hunting for food and sale in the black market continues to occur throughout its entire range. Some populations occur in protected reserves, including the Parque das Emas in Brazil, and the Central Suriname Nature Reserve, a massive 1.6-million-hectare site of pristine rainforest managed by Conservation International. Such protection helps to some degree to mitigate the threat of habitat loss, but targeted conservation action is required to prevent the further decline of this species.

At least one zoo park, in Villavicencio, Colombia – &quot;Los Ocarros&quot; – is dedicated to this animal.

<text>Le Lido is a musical theatre venue located on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, France. It opened in 1946 at 78 Avenue des Champs-Élysées and moved to its current location in 1977. Until its purchase by Accor in 2021, it was known for its exotic cabaret and burlesque shows including dancers, singers, and other performers. Famous names have performed there including: Edith Piaf, Siegfried and Roy, Hervé Vilard, Sylvie Vartan, Ray Vasquez, Renee Victor, Johnny Hallyday, Maurice Chevalier, Marlene Dietrich, Eartha Kitt, Josephine Baker, Kessler Twins, Elton John, Laurel &amp; Hardy, Dalida, Shirley MacLaine, Mitzi Gaynor, Juliet Prowse, and Noël Coward.

== History ==
Le Lido was preceded by an artificial beach in a townhouse basement in the 1920s, running as a nightclub/casino in the late night hours.

&quot;Lido&quot;, founded in 1928, at 78 Avenue des Champs-Élysées, by Francisque Chaux (1851-1949), with entertainment, aquatic shows and bathing, with interior design by René Berger, and inspired by Venice Lido beach.

In 1933, following a compulsory liquidation, the establishment closed.

In 1936, took over the management and replaced the swimming pool with a performance hall.

&quot;Léon Volterra (1888-1949), the successful manager of famous music halls and theatres in Paris (Olympia, 1916-1918; Casino de Paris, 1917-1929; Théâtre de Paris, 1918-1948; Eden, 1921-1923; Théâtre Marigny, 1925-1946; Lido, 1936-1946)...Elected Mayor of the neighbouring town of Saint-Tropez in 1935 (1935-1941), Léon Volterra transferred to his wife, Simone Volterra (1898-1989), the management of the vineyard and of the theatres. After the divorce of the couple in 1946...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;crw/fotw/fr-83-ra&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 1941, during the German occupation of Paris, on that night, the Spanish ambassador José Félix de Lequerica invited the French writer Paul Morand and the actresses Arletty and Josée Laval, Pierre Laval″s daughter, to the Lido.

In 1946, sold to Joseph and Louis Clérico, On 20 June 1946, Le Lido with the new performance hall opened with a revue entitled &quot;Sans rimes ni raison&quot;. With the collaboration of Pierre-Louis Guérin and then René Fraday, the Lido developed a &quot;dinner-show&quot; formula. 

In 1948, Margaret Kelly, as “Miss Bluebell”, and her dance company, the “Bluebell Girls”, joined the Lido.

...&quot;the early days, when exotic creatures graced the stage - tales of runaway chimps, spitting lamas, and camels left stranded on the footpath still trip off the tongues of the Lido&#x27;s veterans&quot;...&lt;ref name=&quot;smh/lido-turns-60&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, after a visit by the entertainment director of the Stardust Resort and Casino, Las Vegas, the Clérico brothers along with Donn Arden brought the Lido to the Stardust Las Vegas. This started a series of imports of Parisian cabaret shows to Las Vegas: Folies Bergère to the Tropicana, Nouvelle Eve to Hotel El Rancho Vegas and Casino de Paris to the Dunes. The Stardust edition of Le Lido closed in 1992.

Between 1955 and 1960, the twin sisters, Alice and Ellen Kessler performed at The Lido. Leila and Valerie Croft, of Victoria, London, identical twins, also performed at The Lido.

In December 1964, Paris Match photographed Elizabeth Taylor, Aristotle Onassis and Claude Pompidou at a Lido première .

In 1977, Le Lido moved to the on the Champs-Élysées.
&quot;In 1978 the huge space under (UGC Normandie) the theatre’s former circle and stage were transformed into the Lido cabaret (1,200 seats) sharing the same entrance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CT/ugcNormandie&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Sodexo, the international food service company, purchased Le Lido and invested 24 million euro into developing its show.

27 revues were created between 20 June 1946 and 2 April 2015.

The hotel group Accor bought Le Lido in 2021 and dismissed most of the permanent employees, mainly artists and technicians, in order to replace the costly dinner shows and revues with less expensive musical theatre productions.

== Cabaret shows ==
The Lido was closed from December 2, 2014, to April 2, 2015, while a new version of the show was prepared. The new version was developed by Franco Dragone. Each version of Le Lido was made up of 10–20 scenes and ran for about an hour and a half. Two shows were run every day of the week. A pre-show dinner, featuring a robotic orchestra, was offered with the first evening show of each day at an additional cost.

In spring 2015, Franco Dragone created a new show for Le Lido titled &quot;Paris Merveilles&quot;. 

&quot;Currently (30 November 2016) about 60 girls appear on stage each night: 44 girls both topless and clothed (known as nudes and Bluebells) and 16 Kelly Boys. Roughly half are French; the rest hail particularly from the UK, Australia and Russia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cXf/parisian-british&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Le Lido show featured singers and dancers, which always included the famous Bluebell Girls. A few featured dancers, showgirls and lead singers were sometimes added. The Lido was known for its spectacular costumes featuring thousands of dollars in feathers and rhinestones, rich fabrics, and top quality furs.

The opening or &quot;theme&quot; scene welcomed the audience and set the tone for the evening. It also sometimes set the colour scheme for the show and featured special effects and lighting. Music could be original or a medley of current popular songs mixed with music from Broadway or Hollywood films; often the opening number was a potpourri of styles and performers could change costumes several times. Between the production numbers, specialty &quot;vaudeville/cabaret&quot; acts were featured, such as jugglers, acrobats or magicians. At least one scene would feature water effects – another thing the Lido was known for. The stage itself could be raised and lowered, change back and forth into an ice rink or swimming pool, and feature elaborate set pieces which came up from below. The closing number often featured a number called &quot;Merci Beaucoup&quot; (featured in the television show &quot;Shirley Maclaine at The Lido de Paris&quot;) and usually had some particularly spectacular costumes.

Among the last of its kind, the Lido had a special place in the history of nightclubs and floorshows and continued a tradition of the &quot;naughty but nice&quot; opulent production shows originally started by the Folies Bergère.

==Bluebell Girls==

Founded by Margaret Kelly, also known as Miss Bluebell, the dancers of the Lido were known as the Bluebell Girls. Until her retirement in 1986, each dancer was selected by Kelly. The dancers were afterwards under the direction of Pierre Rambert until his retirement in December 2014. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, they were &quot;some of the world’s most beautiful and talented burlesque dancers&quot;. The cast came from all over the world, and were noted for their statuesque height, averaging 5&#x27; 11&quot; (minimum 1.75 meters).

==Production history==
Every few years, Le Lido developed a new version of its show. The show used to change more frequently, but in later times each iteration could run for several years until the management felt it had run its course and a new production was called for. Each show could take millions of dollars to develop. The following are the titles of each show produced by the Le Lido:
*1946 – Sans Rimes Ni Raisons
*1946 – Mississippi
*1947 – Made in Paris
*1948 – Confetti (&quot;The Bluebell Girls&quot; debut)

<doc id="1315701" wikidata="Q3402414" url="?curid=1315701" title="Emperor Rosko">
<text>Michael Joseph Pasternak (born 26 December 1942), known by his stage name Emperor Rosko, is an American presenter of rock music programmes, most widely known for his shows on Radio Caroline and BBC Radio 1 in the UK in the 1960s and early 1970s.

==Early life==
Born in Los Angeles, California, he is the son of Hollywood film producer Joe Pasternak. He was influenced in his career choice by Los Angeles disc jockeys Lord Tim Hudson at KFWB and Wolfman Jack at XERB the Mighty 1090 (Rosarito Beach MX). Pasternak&#x27;s opportunity to broadcast came when he was in the US Navy, where he presented a show on the aircraft carrier , using the name Michael Prescott. He then moved to Europe and hosted sponsored programmes in France and Andorra.

==Origin of stage name==
In an interview with Chris Edwards, for Offshore Echoes, Rosko explained: &quot;I used to listen to a guy named Roscoe, who used to listen to a guy called Boscoe and the double-syllable name ending in &quot;o&quot; was synonymous with rhythm and rhyme which was a precursor to rap. I also used to listen to several other people like Wolfman, Tom Donahue, etc. So I took a little bit of everybody and became Emperor Rosko to distinguish myself from all the others.&quot;

==Offshore radio==
He joined Radio Caroline, a pirate radio station broadcasting from a ship off the coast of Britain, in April 1966. There, his American-influenced fast-paced presentation style soon made him one of the station&#x27;s best-loved DJs. He was often joined on air by his mynah bird Alfie. After his time at Radio Caroline, speaking fluent French, he presented for French-language stations Radio Monte Carlo and Radio Luxembourg as &quot;Le Président Rosko&quot;.

Rosko compered the Stax/Volt Tour of Europe in 1967 and can be heard introducing Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, the Bar-Kays, Carla Thomas, Eddie Floyd, Sam &amp; Dave, and Otis Redding on the two-album set &quot;The Stax/Volt Tour in London&quot;, recorded at the Finsbury Park Astoria (later the Rainbow Theatre) on 17 March 1967. It is Rosko who can be heard introducing Redding and encouraging the crowd to chant and spell his name on Redding&#x27;s album &quot;Live in Europe&quot;, recorded on 17 March and 21 March 1967.

===Return to Radio Caroline===
In January 2023, it was announced that Rosko was to re-join Radio Caroline. In a statement on their website the station stated that Rosko would present monthly breakfast shows under the Radio Caroline North link-up with Manx Radio.

==BBC career==
As a disc jockey with BBC Radio 1 at its launch in September 1967, Rosko initially recorded shows in France for the &quot;Midday Spin&quot; programme. On his first &quot;Midday Spin&quot; show, Rosko introduced himself with &quot;I am the Emperor, the geeter with the heater, your leader, your groovy host from the West Coast, here to clear up your skin and mess up your mind. It&#x27;ll make you feel good all over.&quot; He highlighted the new Motown, reggae and rock music.

Rosko moved to the UK in 1968 and from 1970 presented Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Friday Roundtable&quot;, in which new records were reviewed by a panel of guests. He also presented in a Saturday lunchtime slot. Together with fellow Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis, he launched the first mobile discothèque, the &quot;Rosko International Roadshow&quot;. He stayed with Radio 1 until September 1976, when he left for America to rejoin his father, who was suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Around 1975, he briefly hosted &quot;Crackerjack&quot; on BBC Television with Little &amp; Large. During that year he also presented a few editions of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, including the edition broadcast on 10 April.

When Rosko returned to Europe, he was heard via recorded shows on Radio Luxembourg. In 1981 he returned to Radio 1 for a 13-week Sunday series of shows, and continued to broadcast at weekends during the Summer for four years. In 1988, he returned to Radio 1 to help celebrate the 21st birthday of the station. In 1992, he helped celebrate the station&#x27;s 25th birthday with a special broadcast, before joining Virgin Radio 1215 in April 1993.

==Since 2000==
From October 2001, Rosko was heard on the now defunct Classic Gold Digital, and REM.FM, his programme being recorded in California. He also ran his own soul station &quot;Rosko Radio&quot; for Internet broadcaster Live365, which aired its final broadcasts in December 2007. There was no sponsor and the free distribution was challenged by the societies of authors and composers in the US based on complaints of unfair competition for FM radio. The service continued in podcast form.

He also broadcasts a programme called &quot;The LA Connection&quot; from his studios in California, which in 2012 could be heard in the UK on 96.5 Bolton FM, Classic Hits Forest Gold, Radio Scarborough, Zack FM 105.3 in East Anglia, Forest FM 92.3 in Verwood, Dorset, Vixen 101 in East Yorkshire, Belfast 89 and across Europe on several stations including Central FM in southern Spain, and Radio Ayia Napa in Cyprus.

On 11 April 2009, Rosko presented a three-hour show within a BBC-sponsored commemorative broadcast from the lightship LV18 berthed at Harwich. Since then, Rosko has been heard regularly on the internet broadcaster Big L International.

He makes occasional Sunday broadcasts for the radio station The Mighty KBC on 6.095 MHz (49m shortwave) in Europe.

On 14 August 2017, Emperor Rosko made a special guest broadcast on Radio Caroline to mark the 50th anniversary of the Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967.

In 2018, Rosko joined the line-up for the new United DJs DAB and online radio station.

In August of 2023 he was to be heard on Alderney&#x27;s QUAY-FM. 

On 28 March 2024, he broadcast on Boom Radio to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the launch of Radio Caroline.

==Film==
Rosko was the inspiration for the Philip Seymour Hoffman character &quot;The Count&quot; in the comedy film &quot;The Boat That Rocked&quot;, known as &quot;Pirate Radio&quot; in the United States.

==Singles discography==
==Awards==
*2008 – at a lunch in December, inducted into the Radio Academy Hall of Fame
*2011 – Lifetime Achievement Award at the International Radio Festival in Zürich.

==Publications==
His book &quot;Emperor Rosko&#x27;s DJ Book&quot; was published by Everest in March 1976 (). It was re-published, with additional material, as an eBook in October 2012.

<text>Wireless Village is a set of specifications for mobile instant messaging and presence services. It is intended to be a standard for cellphones and mobile devices to use these services across platforms.

Many wireless phones now include mobile instant messaging capabilities designed to hook into messaging services using IMPS on a carrier&#x27;s network, formerly known as the Wireless Village protocol. Those phones implement it as an &quot;IM&quot; icon on the phone, which is typically renamed and customized by the cellphone carrier or removed completely if not supported at the network level. Most Nokia and Motorola phones have that feature, as do many Sony Ericsson phones.

==Description==
The white paper describes the service:

&quot;Where possible, the protocol makes use of existing Internet and Web technologies. These technologies are implemented widely and are well tested, so their use within the protocol ensure easy implementation and interoperability testing. XML, the Extensible Markup Language, is rapidly emerging as the lingua franca for representing structured data over the Web. To the extent possible, the protocol uses XML to represent the protocol data being exchanged during an IMPS session. IMPS activities in the IETF IMPP have received widespread interest throughout the industry. Although it is still in development, to the extent possible, the Wireless Village initiative will support the CPIM draft and build upon it. Other useful standards in this space include the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) for registering the format of the IMPS protocol messages.&quot;

==History==
An announcement was made when this service was conceived by Ericsson, Motorola and Nokia. The specification is maintained by the Open Mobile Alliance, and is currently at version 1.3 of the protocol.

As of now, only a few public services exist using Wireless Village. Any unlocked phone can be configured to use these services, and therefore connect to other instant messaging services if implemented.

==Operator implementations==
*noknok, MTN South Africa, South Africa&#x27;s 1st operator launched IMPS service. It does not work with native phone applications.

==Yamigo==
Yamigo was a free communications service, based in Finland, that allowed instant messaging on mobile phones over wireless data services such as GPRS. The service was based on the protocol Wireless Village, developed by the Open Mobile Alliance, which is a joint venture between Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Motorola and other mobile device manufacturers.

Certain models of mobile phones that include a chat client could access the Yamigo network. These included certain models of phones from Nokia, Motorola, Sony Ericsson and Siemens. Once registered, Yamigo users could send messages to each other, and to users on Yahoo! Messenger, MSN Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger and ICQ. Yamigo supported importing contact lists from those services automatically.

Users connected to Yamigo via WAP and the internet. On the service&#x27;s sign up page, users selected how frequently their phone polled the Yamigo network. Because it is a client-server protocol, receiving messages depended on how often the phone was set to poll the network. The service was abandoned in late 2005, and the last upgrade was version .19 in April 2005.

<doc id="1315709" wikidata="Q954815" url="?curid=1315709" title="Piano Concerto in G major (Ravel)">
<text>Maurice Ravel&#x27;s Piano Concerto in G major, was composed between 1929 and 1931. The piano concerto is in three movements, with a total playing time of a little over 20 minutes. Ravel said that in this piece he was not aiming to be profound but to entertain, in the manner of Mozart and Saint-Saëns. Among its other influences are jazz and Basque folk music.

The first performance was given in Paris in 1932 by the pianist Marguerite Long, with the Orchestre Lamoureux conducted by the composer. Within months the work was heard in the major cities of Europe and in the US. It has been recorded many times by pianists, orchestras and conductors from all over the world.

==Background and first performance==

The concerto was Ravel&#x27;s penultimate composition. He had contemplated a piano concerto, based on Basque themes, in 1906; he returned to the idea in 1913, but abandoned work on the piece in 1914. Fifteen years elapsed before he turned once more to the idea of writing a concerto. He began sketching it in 1929 but throughout his career he had been a slow, painstaking worker, and it was nearly three years before the concerto was finished. He was obliged to put it to one side while he worked to a deadline to write another concerto, the D major, for the left hand, commissioned by Paul Wittgenstein.

The biographer Arbie Orenstein writes that while touring the US in 1928, Ravel had been &quot;impressed by its jazz, Negro spirituals and the excellence of its orchestras&quot;. Jazz had been popular in Paris since the start of the decade: Ravel had first heard, and enjoyed, it in 1921, and its influence is heard in the violin sonata, completed in 1927, and in the D major piano concerto. The Basque theme mooted in 1906 and 1913 was not wholly abandoned. His colleague Gustave Samazeuilh believed that Ravel drew on his earlier ideas for the outer movements of the G major concerto, and Orenstein notes a Basque influence in the opening theme of the work.

In an interview with the music critic Pierre Leroi, published in October 1931, Ravel said:

He had intended to be the soloist in the first public performance of the new work, but fatigue, poor health and pressure of work led him to offer the premiere to Marguerite Long, to whom he dedicated the concerto. Long, who was known for her performances of the works of Fauré and Debussy had earlier asked Ravel for a new work. She received the completed score on 11 November 1931, and played the concerto at the Salle Pleyel on 14 January 1932, with Ravel conducting the Orchestre Lamoureux.

A few days after the premiere, Ravel and Long began a European tour with the concerto, playing in sixteen cities, starting in Antwerp and including Brussels, Vienna, Bucharest, Prague, London, Warsaw, Berlin, Amsterdam and Budapest. The first North American performances were given on 22 April 1932, in Boston and Philadelphia.

==Instrumentation==
Ravel told Leroi, &quot;In order not to needlessly weigh down the orchestral texture, I called for a reduced orchestra: the usual strings are joined only by one flute, piccolo, oboe, cor anglais, two bassoons, two horns, one trumpet and one trombone&quot;. Orenstein points out that Ravel, or Leroi, forgot to mention two clarinets and the extensive range of percussion instruments.
The full tally of instruments, apart from the piano, comprises piccolo, flute, oboe, cor anglais, E clarinet, clarinet in B and A, 2 bassoons, 2 horns in F, trumpet in C, trombone, timpani, triangle, snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, tamtam, wood block, whip, harp, 16 violins, 6 violas, 6 cellos, and 4 double basses.

==Structure==

The concerto typically plays for about 22 minutes.

=== I. Allegramente ===
The first movement, in G major, is in time. It opens with a single sharp whip-crack, followed by an exposition that contains five distinct themes. Orenstein says of them that the first suggests a Basque folk melody, the second the influence of Spain, and the other three derive from the idiom of jazz. The development section – &quot;a lively romp&quot; – is followed by a cadenza-like passage leading to the recapitulation. Where a cadenza might be expected in such a concerto movement, Ravel writes three: first for harp, then for the woodwind, and finally for the piano; the last of these draws on the fifth theme of the exposition. An extended coda concludes the movement, bringing back some of the material from the development section and finishes with a series of descending major and minor triads.

===II. Adagio assai===
The slow movement, in E major, is in time. In contrast with the preceding movement, it is a tranquil subject of Mozartian serenity written in ternary form. Ravel said of it, &quot;That flowing phrase! How I worked over it bar by bar! It nearly killed me!&quot; The first theme is presented by the piano, unaccompanied. Ravel said he took as his model the theme from the &quot;Larghetto&quot; of Mozart&#x27;s Clarinet Quintet, but in an analysis of the work published in 2000 Michael Russ comments that whereas the Mozart melody unfolds across 20 bars, Ravel builds an even longer – 34-bar – melody, without repeating a single bar. The musicologist Michel Fleury calls the opening an &quot;extended monologue in the style of a stately Sarabande&quot;, and remarks that it derives &quot;its curiously hypnotic character&quot; from the rhythmic discrepancy between the time signature of the melody in the right hand and the signature of the accompaniment. After thirty bars – about three minutes in a typical performance – the solo flute enters with a C and oboe, clarinet and flute carry the melody into the second theme. There follows a more dissonant episode, imbued with what Fleury calls a slight sense of trepidation; the orchestra plays slowly ascending chord progressions while the piano part consists of &quot;iridescent harmonies&quot;. The cor anglais [English horn] reintroduces the opening theme beneath the piano&#x27;s &quot;delicate filigree in the high register&quot;.

===III. Presto===
The finale, in G major, is in time. At just under four minutes in a typical performance it is much the shortest of the three. Four brisk chords at the beginning launch what Fleury describes as &quot;an unstoppable onslaught, spurred on by the shrieks of the clarinet and the piccolo, the donkey brays of the trombone and occasional fanfare flourishes in the brass&quot;. Orenstein finds the opening recalls the carnival atmosphere of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Petrushka&quot; or Satie&#x27;s &quot;Parade&quot;. The solo part begins with a series of demisemiquavers marked to be played &quot;piano&quot; – a technically demanding combination. The music progresses through several modes before coming to its conclusion with the same four chords with which the movement begins. Reviewing the premiere of the work, Henry Prunières wrote, &quot;The spirit of jazz indeed animates this last movement ... but with extreme discretion&quot;.
==Recordings==
The first recording of the concerto, made in 1932, featured Marguerite Long as soloist with an &quot;ad hoc&quot; orchestra of the best players in Paris, conducted, according to the label, by the composer. In fact Ravel supervised the recording sessions, while a more proficient conductor, Pedro de Freitas Branco, took the baton.

The many later recordings include:

<doc id="1315722" wikidata="Q321473" url="?curid=1315722" title="Francesco Spiera">
<text>Francesco Spiera (1502 – December 27, 1548) was a Protestant Italian jurist. The manner of his death has been the subject of numerous religious tracts.

==Life==
He was born at Cittadella, north of Padua, then part of the Republic of Venice. Protestants of the early modern period used his case as an example of the dreadful consequences of the sin against the Holy Ghost: he discerned evangelical truth, but denied and abjured it for external reasons.

Spiera had a respected position in his native town and a fine house, in which ten children grew up. Besides the Scriptures, there fell into his hands various evangelical writings, such as &quot;The Benefit of Christ&#x27;s Death&quot;, &quot;Doctrine Old and New&quot;, and &quot;Summary of Sacred Scripture&quot;, which instilled in him doubts about Roman Catholic teachings, such as those on purgatory and veneration of the saints. 

With others he was arraigned before the Inquisition at Venice; his trial was held between May 24 and June 20, 1548. On the latter day, in St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica, Spiera made solemn abjuration of his &quot;errors&quot;, and subscribed the abjuration, which he then repeated on the following Sunday in Cittadella, after mass in the cathedral. On returning home, so he related it himself, &quot;the Spirit&quot;, or the voice of his conscience, began to reproach him for having denied the truth. Over time, he felt more and more hopeless, which feeling so affected him physically that he was taken to Padua to be treated by physicians. The treatment was in vain, and the conflict, which Pier Paolo Vergerio and others witnessed, ended in his death, shortly after his return to his home. 

That Spiera intentionally injured himself is later invention.

<doc id="1315738" wikidata="Q3133197" url="?curid=1315738" title="Henry de La Falaise">
<text>Henry de La Falaise, Marquis de La Coudraye (born James Henri Le Bailly de la Falaise; February 11, 1898 – April 10, 1972), was a French nobleman, translator, film director, film producer, sometime actor, and war hero who was best known for his high-profile marriages to two leading Hollywood actresses.

==Early life==
James Henri Le Bailly de la Falaise was born on February 11, 1898, in Saint-Cyr-l&#x27;École, France, the eldest son and second child of Louis Venant Gabriel Le Bailly de la Falaise, écuyer (1866–1910), a three time Olympic gold-medallist in fencing and former Army officer. His mother was the former Henriette Lucie Frédérique Hennessy (1873–1965), scion of the Cognac family. After his father died in 1910, his widowed mother married her second husband, Count Antoine Hocquart de Turtot (1872–1954), a cavalry officer and major French horse-racing figure, in 1912. His mother and father had four children together:

* Louise Le Bailly de La Falaise (1894–1910)
* Henri James Le Bailly de La Falaise, Écuyer (1898–1972), film director and producer, war hero and translator.
* Alain Le Bailly de La Falaise, Écuyer (1905–1977). He was the first husband of fashion model Maxime de la Falaise (1922—2009) and the father of fashion muse/designer Loulou de la Falaise.
* Richard Le Bailly de La Falaise, Écuyer (1910—died at Buchenwald in 1945)
His mother had another child with her second husband, de La Falaise&#x27;s half-sibling
* Henriette-Hyacinthe-Olympe-Geneviève Hocquart de Turtot (born c. 1913).

===Title===
The title held by the head of the family, Marquis de La Coudraye, dating from 1707, was granted, by an 1876 act of succession, to the younger son of Pacôme-François Le Bailly, Seigneur de La Falaise, and his wife, Pauline-Louise-Victoire de Loynes, daughter of the Marquis de La Coudraye. La Falaise inherited the title of Marquis de La Coudraye from his paternal grandfather, Gabriel-César-Henri Le Bailly de La Falaise, who, like his father, died in 1910 (the father died on April 4, the grandfather on August 6).

Since La Falaise had no children, the title of Marquis de La Coudraye was inherited by his younger brother, Alain de La Falaise (died 1977). It then passed to his nephew, Alexis de La Falaise (died 2004). It is now held by his grand-nephew (grandson of Alain), Daniel de La Falaise, a professional chef and food writer.

===Name===
His actual surname was &quot;Le Bailly&quot;, though he and other members of his family used &quot;Le Bailly de la Falaise&quot;, referring to an ancestral estate; it is typically abbreviated to &quot;de la Falaise&quot;. As the marquis told &quot;The New York Times&quot; (October 7, 1925), &quot;My patronymic name is Le Bailly, but ... I use the name de la Falaise because it is one of the great-grandfather branches of the Le Bailly family. De La Falaise is the only existing branch of that family today. So this should be my entire name: James Henry Le Bailly de La Falaise, Marquis de La Coudraye&quot;.

==Military service==
The Marquis de La Coudraye was awarded the Croix de Guerre for heroism during World War I, during which time he was attached to the 70th Division of the American Expeditionary Forces. He received Croix de Guerre for bravery during World War II, while he was attached to the British 12th Royal Lancers. In 1943, La Falaise published &quot;Through Hell to Dunkirk&quot; (Military Service Publishing Company), a memoir of his war experiences.

Notably handsome and universally known as &quot;Hank,&quot; the marquis was admiringly described by the actress Lillian Gish as &quot;a real war hero. In his bathing-suit he presents a graphic picture of what modern warfare does to a man – he is so cut-and-shot and covered with scars.&quot;

==Career==
La Falaise directed at least five motion pictures, notably among them are two travelogue drama silent films about primitive life and customs: &quot;Kliou, the Killer&quot; (1934, released 1936, also known as &quot;Kliou, the Killer Tiger&quot;) although the disparity in the titling remains unknown even today, and &quot;&quot; (1933, released 1935, also known as &quot;Djanger: Love Rite of Bali&quot;). The latter production was described many years later as a &quot;seductive blend of serious documentary, lyrical effusion and unbridled prurience&quot;. He may also have written a film script for Gloria Swanson, his first wife, called &quot;Paris Luck&quot;, a 1927 work that bore the name of Robert Bailly. He also served as the U.S. representative for Pathé, the French film studio. They were the last mainstream silent films shot by a major Hollywood studio.

La Falaise also produced and directed three films for RKO, which were filmed in French and English versions: &quot;Échec Au Roi (The Royal Bed)&quot; (an adaptation of Robert E. Sherwood&#x27;s play &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Husband&quot;); &quot;Le fils d&#x27;autre (The Woman Between)&quot;, and &quot;Nuit d&#x27;Espagne (Transgression)&quot;.

==Marriages==
La Falaise was married three times, but did not have any children. His wives were:
*Gloria Swanson (1899–1983), American movie actress. They married in Paris, France, on January 28, 1925, after meeting on the set of the Swanson film &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot;, on which La Falaise was working as a translator. They were officially divorced in November 1931, at which time Swanson was several months pregnant by Michael Farmer, an Irish sportsman, who would become her fourth husband. (Thinking her divorce from La Falaise was already finalized, the actress had married Farmer in August, which was technically bigamy, and was forced to remarry him, legally, in November.) Swanson conceived a child with La Falaise but had an abortion because, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted, in 2004, &quot;if she had given birth seven months after her marriage, her career would have been ruined&quot;. During their marriage La Falaise was employed as the California representative of Peugeot American Corp., the U.S. branch of the European automobile manufacturer.
*Constance Bennett (1904–1965), American movie actress, whom he married in November 1931, days after his divorce from Swanson was finalized. With her, he founded Bennett Productions, a film company for which he directed &quot;Legong: Dance of the Virgin&quot; (the first color movie filmed in Bali and the last of Hollywood&#x27;s silent films) and &quot;Kliou the Killer&quot; (filmed in present-day Vietnam and the last movie made in two-tone Technicolor). Bennett and La Falaise divorced in 1940.
*Emma &quot;Emmita&quot; Rodríguez Restrepo de Roeder (1940-his death 1972), a Colombian socialite, whose father had been a diplomat.

<doc id="1315744" wikidata="Q4043364" url="?curid=1315744" title="M67 recoilless rifle">
<text>The M67 recoilless rifle is a 90 mm (3.55 inch) anti-tank recoilless rifle made in the United States and later in South Korea. It could also be employed in an anti-personnel role with the use of the M590 antipersonnel round. It was designed to be fired primarily from the ground using the bipod and monopod, but could also be fired from the shoulder using the folded bipod as a shoulder rest and the monopod as a front grip. The weapon was air-cooled and breech-loaded, and fired fixed ammunition. It is a direct fire weapon employing stadia lines to allow simple range finding, based on a typical tank target bridging the lines once in range.

== History and use ==
Adopted in 1959 in Army service, the M67 was used in the Vietnam War together with the much larger 106 mm M40. The M67 proved an effective weapon, though it was primarily used against personnel in combat, and saw little or no use against armor and even against fortifications. While troops praised its effectiveness, the M67 came under heavy criticism due to the weapon&#x27;s weight and length as well as its backblast, which often precluded its use in offensive operations. Because of these disadvantages, the Marine Corps units continued to use the old M20 &quot;Super Bazooka&quot; in preference to the M67. It was largely replaced in Army service by the M47 Dragon anti-tank missile system starting in 1975. The M67 was also issued to anti-armour platoons of 1 ATF (Australian/New Zealand Task Force) during the Vietnam war, being used near the perimeter of the defense bases due to its weight. The M67 was issued in lieu of the standard issue Carl Gustav for these armies. This may have been to simplify logistics, or it may be that ammunition for the Carl Gustav could not be sourced due to Swedish opposition to the war in Vietnam.

The M67 was not completely withdrawn from infantry service. Instead, it was retained as a substitute standard antitank weapon for special tasks or battle environments. Since the batteries of the Dragon and the wires of the TOW could fail due to extremely low temperatures, the M67 was used for units deploying to arctic environments and remained in many infantry units in West Germany, such as the 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry, 3rd Infantry Division. Also, VII Corps Combat Engineer Battalions were using the M67 as their main anti-armor weapon during the mid-1980s. Heavy Physical Security Military Police Companies used the M67 on Special Weapons Sites in West Germany as an anti-vehicular weapon. These weapons were issued 6 per company, 2 per platoon for each combat engineer company. Until the 1990s, the 6th Light Infantry Division in Alaska was still using the M67 in its special weapons platoons. Two M67s were used by C Co 5/87th (Lt Infantry) 193rd Infantry Brigade during Operation Just Cause in the Republic of Panama in 1989, using the M590 antipersonnel ammunition. Similarly, the urban environment of West Berlin prompted the Army to keep the weapon with the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the 502nd Infantry Regiment, Berlin Brigade, as late as winter 1991; the M47 Dragon replaced it in January 1992. The Army Rangers retained the M67 in their weapons platoons until the 1990s, when it was replaced by the 84 mm M3 Carl Gustav; Ranger M67s played a key role in knocking out two BTR-60 APCs of the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army in Grenada during Operation Urgent Fury in 1983. Lastly, Combat Engineer units used the M67 as a demolition gun to destroy bunkers and other hard point targets as part of their MTOE (Modified Table Of Organization &amp; Equipment) at least as late as 1990.

The Salvadoran Army received 379 M67s between 1981 and 1992 and used them in urban warfare against the FMLN rebels. The Argentine Army also fielded some M67s during the Falklands War. Royal Saudi Land Forces fielded M67s against Iraq during Gulf War.

In February 2011, it was reported that stocks of surplus M67 recoilless rifles were reintroduced to the 101st Airborne Division for limited combat service in Afghanistan. Numbers of these weapons were issued to the 506th Infantry Regiment, &quot;Currahee&quot;, 4th Brigade Combat Team, for use against fortifications, and concentrations of enemy personnel. The M67 was issued in response to a demand for a reloadable shoulder-fired weapon to be used in static defensive positions as well as ambushes. In particular, the flechette anti-personnel round saw common usage. The M67s were eventually phased out again as the Army expanded issuing of the M3 Carl Gustav recoilless rifle to regular infantry units.

== Production ==
It was designed by the Midwest Research Institute in Kansas City, Missouri. It was also produced in South Korea by Kia Motors, while rounds were manufactured by Poongsan Corporation. Additionally, a licensed version was made in Greece, the &quot;EM-67&quot;.

== Description ==
The M67 is shaped like a long tube with the sight assembly and trigger offset to the side in opposite directions about halfway along the barrel. Under this point is the monopod, with the bipod halfway back from there. The weapon requires a crew of three to operate it; a gunner, assistant gunner (loader) and ammunition bearer. The breech is hinged on the right side, and has to be swung open to load the round. It is then swung closed and when the rifle is fired, the rear end of the shell case breaks up and is blown out of the back of the breech block. On the left side of the barrel, near the sight and trigger assemblies, is an asbestos heat shield to protect the gunner&#x27;s shoulder and neck from the heat of the barrel when firing.

It is capable of maintaining a sustained fire rate of one round per minute, but the weapon could also be rapid fired at an increased rate of one round every six seconds (10 rpm) by a well trained crew. The rapid firing is limited to five rounds, with a mandatory 15 minute cool-off period afterward.

The M49A1 sub-caliber device, which uses NATO 7.62 mm rounds, is typically used for zeroing the sight and for qualifying purposes. The sight is visually zeroed by setting crossed strings over the gun barrel opening (a rubber loop and notches at the end of the barrel facilitate holding the string in the correct position), then looking through the barrel of the sub-caliber device (and crossed strings) and setting the fixed stadia, reticle sight to the same target. The sub-caliber rounds can then be used to further refine the zero and to qualify.

== Ammunition ==
Ammunition for the 90 mm rifle was issued in complete fixed cartridges. The term &quot;fixed&quot; means that the projectile and the cartridge case are crimped together. This ensures correct alignment of the projectile and the cartridge case. It also permits faster loading because the projectile and the cartridge case are loaded as one unit. The rear end of the cartridge case is made of frangible material that is completely destroyed when fired. The projectiles used are pre-engraved with a rifling band, that is, the rotating bands are cut to engage the rifled bore both to trap gases and to spin-stabilize the projectile.

=== TP M371 practice round ===
The TP M371 is a practice round for the M371A1 HEAT round. It has the high explosive filler replaced with inert ballast to keep it at the same weight and flight properties. The nose cap contains a smoke pellet to mark the point of impact.

* Cartridge weight: 9.25 lb (4.2 kg)
* Cartridge length: 28.10 in (714 mm)
* Projectile weight: 6.75 lb (3.06 kg)
* Muzzle velocity: 700 ft/s (213 m/s)
* Maximum effective range: 437 yd (400 m)
* Fuse: PIBD M530A1

=== M371A1 HEAT round ===
The M371A1 round utilizes a special fin-stabilized projectile which employs the shaped charge principle to defeat armor. It does not depend upon the warhead&#x27;s velocity at the moment of impact for its effect, relying instead on the focusing effect of the shape of its explosive filler. The explosive charge collapses a conical metal liner inside the warhead into an extremely high-velocity superplastic jet. This superplastic jet is capable of penetrating steel armor to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the explosive charge. The end of the projectile is a long and narrow stand-off of a length that allows the HEAT warhead to achieve maximum effect against the target.

The M371A1 HEAT round is used primarily against armor. It can also be used against secondary targets such as gun emplacements and pillboxes with excellent results. It is capable of penetrating 1.15 ft (350 mm) of armor plate (steel), 3.5 ft (1.1 m) of packed soil, or 2.5 ft (0.8 m) of reinforced concrete.

* Maximum effective range: 437 yd (400 m)
* Fuse: PIBD M530A1

=== M590 Anti-personnel Canister ===
The &quot;Antipersonnel (Canister) Cartridge M590 (XM590E1)&quot; or M590 cartridge is a flechette round designed for close-in defense against massed infantry attacks. The cartridge consists of an aluminum cartridge case crimped to an aluminum canister. The canister consists of a thin-walled, deep-drawn, aluminum body that contains a payload of 2,400 eight-grain (0.5 g), low-drag, fin-stabilized, steel-wire flechettes. When the canister leaves the muzzle, the pressure ruptures the canister along inscribed score marks to release the flechettes, which disperse in a cone angle of approximately 8 degrees.

In early 1998, cousins Marcus and Eric Bischoff joined the band as vocalist and bassist, respectively. With this lineup, Consense recorded a second demo, which led to a contract with Deeds of Revolution Records. The band began the recording of their debut EP &quot;In Battle...&quot; in summer 1998, but decided on renaming for a second time to Heaven Shall Burn before the EP&#x27;s release. The EP was released through Deeds of Revolution Records in late 1998, and a split album with label mates Fall of Serenity was released in 1999.

<text>Jean-Drapeau station is a Montreal Metro station in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the 4 - Yellow Line. It is situated on the Saint Helen&#x27;s Island in the Saint Lawrence River.

== Overview ==
The station was constructed in open cut as part of the enlargement of Saint Helen&#x27;s Island to host Expo 67. The official opening of the station took place on April 1, 1967. In the first four weeks, it served only the construction workers of the Expo site. Île Sainte-Hélène station finally opened to the public on April 28, 1967, the day after the official opening of Expo 67.

The station was designed to handle large crowds, with a side platform design and large staircases to a ground level concourse. During Expo 67, the station handled over 60,000 passengers an hour. 

The station now serves the various attractions on Saint Helen&#x27;s Island and Notre Dame Island - including Jean-Drapeau Park, the La Ronde amusement park and the Montreal Casino, as well as events like the Canadian Grand Prix at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. This station was the least busy in the network in 2020 and 2021, with the COVID-19 pandemic closing and later reducing the capacity of most of these points of interest.

In May 2001, the station was renamed Jean-Drapeau after Jean Drapeau, mayor of Montreal from 1954 to 1957 and 1960 to 1986, who is often given credit for the construction of the Metro, and for securing both Expo 67 and the 1976 Summer Olympics. The park in which the station sits had been renamed Parc Jean-Drapeau in 1999.

=== Accessibility ===
The station was made accessible in November 2019 with the construction of two elevators. Despite being one of the lesser used stations on the network, elevators were installed due to low technical complexity and low cost of installation. , none of the other stations on the Yellow line are accessible. This effectively negates the elevator’s purpose. However, construction work is currently underway at Berri-UQAM to allow accessible access to the Yellow line platforms, and in turn, the rest of the system.

=== Artwork ===

Painted concrete murals by the station architect Jean Dumontier depict the mythological Titan Atlas holding up the roof of the station. Dumontier was the first architect of the metro to create his own artworks for stations of his own design.

In 1997, the operator of the Lisbon Metro gifted a granite sculpture by Portuguese artist to the STM, to commemorate 30 years since the opening of the Montreal Metro and Expo 67, as well as the Portuguese community in the city. However, the high artwork was too large for any metro station. The artwork was installed instead in Parc Jean-Drapeau, located close to the station on Île Sainte-Hélène.

<doc id="1315787" wikidata="Q1869604" url="?curid=1315787" title="Longueuil–Université-de-Sherbrooke station">
<text>Longueuil station, officially Longueuil–Université-de-Sherbrooke station, is a Montreal Metro station in Longueuil, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and is the southern terminus of the Yellow Line. It is connected to a campus of Université de Sherbrooke, as well as the largest bus station in Greater Montreal, Terminus Longueuil.

It is one of the busiest stations on the Metro network, with 40% of public transit users from the South Shore using the Yellow Line in the morning peak.

== Overview == 

The Yellow Line was not part of the original plans of Montreal&#x27;s Metro network, with the line proposed and approved in 1963 to serve the Expo 67 site and connect to the growing South Shore. The suburb of Longueuil contributed $3.3 million towards the construction of the line. The station opened in April 1967 along with the rest of the Yellow Line.

It is a normal side platform station, with a ticket hall installed directly at platform level on the departure platform. As a result, a new fare must be purchased to switch platforms. Longueuil–Université-de-Sherbrooke is directly connected to Terminus Longueuil bus station, and is also connected to several neighbouring buildings through skywalks. This station has underground city access to the Université de Sherbrooke, Université de Montréal and Université Laval’s campuses, as well shopping, office and retail complexes.

The 1967 station building was a single storey building, connected directly to the bus terminal. A large commercial building was subsequently built above the station. 

In 2010, the new campus for Université de Sherbrooke Longueuil was opened to the east of the station, with direct underground city access to the station. In the 2020s, the building above the station was demolished, to be replaced by a 30 storey mixed-use development above the station including residential condominiums, offices and a hotel. This is part of an effort by Longueuil City Council to develop the area around the Metro station, resulting in 8,500 new homes. 

In 2022, the STM&#x27;s Universal Accessibility Report noted that preliminary design work to make the station accessible was underway. STM plan to work with developers to allow the construction of elevators. Local campaigners have pushed to make the station accessible, noting high ridership levels and connections across the South Shore.

==Origin of name==
When the Yellow Line was being constructed, the station was known as Rive-Sud. The station opened as Longueuil, after the city where it is located. It was renamed Longueuil–Université-de-Sherbrooke on September 26, 2003, to reflect the fact that the Université de Sherbrooke has a campus nearby. (Each Montreal-area university has its name in the nearest Metro station.) Nevertheless, most Montrealers still use the station&#x27;s original name when referring to this station.

==Connections==

The station is connected to Terminus Longueuil, the largest bus station in Greater Montreal. The bus station has 42 platforms, with bus routes from Longueuil, adjacent municipalities and across Quebec.

Nearly 2,000 parking spaces are available at the station.

==Nearby main intersections==
The station is located at the junction of two major roads ( Route 132 and Route 134) and one freeway ( Autoroute 20), near the Jacques Cartier Bridge.

<doc id="1315801" wikidata="Q4681170" url="?curid=1315801" title="Addington, New Zealand">
<text>Addington is a major suburb of Christchurch, New Zealand. It is sited south-west of the city centre.

As an inner city suburb, Addington has a mix of residential, retail and light industrial properties.

==Geography==
Addington is sited between the suburbs of Spreydon and Riccarton, with Blenheim Road providing the boundary to Riccarton. The cluster of the shops in the suburb of Spreydon also provide a clear boundary between the suburbs. To the east of the suburb is Sydenham and to the west is Middleton.

==History==
===19th century===

For the first decade after the founding of Christchurch in 1850, Addington was farmland, consisting of large rural sections. In the early 1860s the railway was surveyed through the area and subdivision of the larger sections began. Factories moved in; wool and grain sheds opened; and with the industry came residential development for workers.

Development continued throughout the 19th century. The city&#x27;s sale yards opened in 1874 and the railway workshops were moved to Addington in 1880. By the time the show grounds were opened in 1887, Addington had become an important suburb in the industrial and social life of Christchurch. In 1874 the Addington Prison was built under the guidance of Benjamin Mountfort in Lincoln Road. The prison closed in 1999 and the Mountfort cell block and remaining perimeter walls are a Heritage New Zealand Historic Place Category 2 and is now a hostel. 

The suburb was named for the country residence of Archbishop John Sumner, one of the leading members of the Canterbury Association, and who was buried in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Addington in England.

===20th century===
The New Zealand Railways Department&#x27;s Addington Workshops were situated in Addington until their closure in the 1990s. The historic concrete water-tower is the only remnant of the workshops. The tower has served as the centrepoint for the Tower Junction shopping complex. 

A new Christchurch railway station at Addington opened in 1994 to replace the former station on Moorhouse Avenue. The station mainly serves the TranzAlpine which carries passengers on the coast-to-coast journey from Christchurch to Greymouth.

Addington was the home of the oldest blending plant in the Southern Hemisphere until it was demolished after sustaining some damage in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The demolition of the plant sparked some controversy as the plant had been lined up to be carefully taken apart in an attempt to save Oregon timber valued at over $600,000.

==Demographics==
Addington comprises four statistical areas. Addington North is primarily industrial, with the Main South Line running through it. Addington West and Addington East are residential.

<text>Allan Aubrey Boesak (born 23 February 1946) is a South African Dutch Reformed Church cleric, politician and anti-apartheid activist. He was sentenced to prison for fraud in 1999 but was subsequently granted an official pardon and reinstated as a cleric in late 2004.

Along with Beyers Naudé and Winnie Mandela, Boesak won the 1985 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award given annually by the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights to an individual or group whose courageous activism is at the heart of the human rights movement and in the spirit of Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s vision and legacy.

==Theologian, cleric and activist==
Originally from Kakamas, Boesak became active in the separate Coloured branch of the Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk and began to work as a pastor in Paarl. He became known then as a liberation theologian, starting with the publication of his doctoral work (&quot;Farewell to Innocence&quot;, 1976). For the next decade or so, he continued to write well-received books and collections of essays, sermons, and so on. One of Boesak&#x27;s anti-apartheid speeches was sampled by British electronica group The Shamen on their album &quot;En Tact&quot;.

Boesak was elected as president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches in 1982, a position he held until 1991.

He rose to prominence during the 1980s as an outspoken critic and opponent of the National Party&#x27;s policies and played a major anti-apartheid activist role as a patron of the United Democratic Front (UDF) from 1983 to 1991. In 1991, Boesak was elected chairman of the Western Cape region of the African National Congress (ANC).

Boesak resigned from the Dutch Reformed Church in 1990 after details of an extramarital affair with television presenter Elna Botha emerged; they later married.

In 2004, Boesak came out in favour of same-sex marriage in South Africa, a year before the country&#x27;s Constitutional Court ruled that the denial of marriage to gay people was discriminatory and violated the country&#x27;s constitution. In 2008, while serving as the Moderator of the Cape Synod of the Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa, to the shock of many senior church leaders, Boesak announced that he was going to resign all of his positions within the church because of its discriminatory position on homosexuality and gay and lesbian people. He invoked the anti-apartheid 1986 Belhar Confession, which lambasts all forms of discrimination, to say that the church should welcome gays and lesbians, begin to perform gay marriage ceremonies, and appoint gay clergy.

In 2008, Boesak publicly challenged the South African leadership to remember why the country had set out to join all races and create a non-racial South Africa. In the annual Ashley Kriel Memorial Youth Lecture, he suggested that the ANC was well down the slippery slope of ethnic preferences and &quot;had brought back the hated system of racial categorization.&quot; In December 2008 he left the ANC to join the Congress of the People Party. In reaction, the ANC leaked a memorandum written by Boesak, detailing how he had discussed different roles he could play to help the organisation and stating that his preferred choice was the post of South African ambassador to the United Nations.

The same month saw Boesak voicing his views on the Zimbabwe crisis, calling on citizens of the stricken country to rise up in opposition to President Robert Mugabe and his authoritarian ZANU-PF ruling party. He also censured Thabo Mbeki for failing in his role as the Southern African Development Community&#x27;s official mediator to heed the churches&#x27; call for a peace-keeping force.

He also called for a revaluation of affirmative action, describing the way it was used in the Western Cape as &quot;totally inexcusable&quot;. 

In June 2013, Christian Theological Seminary and Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana appointed Boesak as the Desmond Tutu Professor for Peace, Global Justice, and Reconciliation Studies, a new four-year position held jointly with both institutions.

==Controversies==
After being replaced as the ANC party leader for Western Cape province, Boesak was compensated by Mandela with an appointment as ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva. A few weeks prior to commencing duties in this post, the first hint of corruption surfaced.

The allegation were into the use of foreign aid given to the Foundation for Peace and Justice charity setup by Boesak. The DanChurchAid (Danish Church Aid) approached Johannesburg law firm Bell Dewar to investigate the use of a $1 million donation made in 1985 (c.a. R3 million at the time) . For six weeks Boesak held out while the scandal was aired in the press. Only when the Office for Serious Economic Offences began its own investigation was he finally persuaded to resign from the foreign ministry.

A further complaint was made by Archbishop Tutu, who called in police to investigate what had happened to a donation of 423,000 rands made by the American singer Paul Simon, which Tutu had passed on to Boesak&#x27;s foundation. &#x27;We are distressed and angry&#x27;, he said in a statement, &#x27;that money ... set aside for child victims of apartheid cannot be accounted for immediately&#x27;.

After a three-month investigation, the Johannesburg law firm issued a 600-page report damning of Boesak&#x27;s conduct. Boesak, the report said, had &#x27;enriched himself substantially&#x27; by diverting funds to buy a luxury house and to pay for an inflated salary, vacations, his second wedding and his new wife&#x27;s business debts. Only a quarter of the foundation&#x27;s income had gone to projects intended by Scandinavian donors to help apartheid victims. Boesak&#x27;s response was to deny all responsibility, to blame his staff and to claim that he was a victim of racism. It was at the start of this trial that the phrase &quot;struggle bookkeeping&quot; was coined. The term was used to justify struggle icons&#x27; use and abuse of international donor funding for private purposes. 

Meanwhile, the government had asked one of its own legal advisers to investigate. The adviser produced a three-page report which attempted to pick holes in the law firm&#x27;s report and went on to clear Boesak of misconduct. The response of the Johannesburg law firm was to describe the government report as &#x27;preposterous&#x27; and &#x27;absurd&#x27; and to issue an eighteen-page rebuttal, rejecting it point by point.

But without waiting for the work in progress by the Office for Serious Economic Offences to conclude, Mandela duly proclaimed Boesak innocent. &#x27;The government has investigated the allegations against Dr Boesak and found they were baseless&#x27;, he declared. He went on to praise Boesak as &#x27;one of the most gifted young men in the country&#x27; who deserved a &#x27;high diplomatic post&#x27;. Boesak pronounced himself vindicated, demanded a public apology from DanChurchAid and offered his services to the government.

In the resulting public controversy, Mandela and the government were accused of covering up corruption, engaging in political cronyism and undermining the course of justice. The outcry eventually died down, and Boesak did not get a government job.

Brought to trial on charges of fraud and theft regarding the donation by Paul Simon the court stated: &quot;The court a quo found that the appellant had committed fraud by representing to the other trustees that only R423 000 was available to the Trust when in fact R682 261.21 was available. The appellant was accordingly convicted on count 4. Furthermore, the court held that the appellant stole the difference of R259 161.21. This led to his conviction on count 5. The appellant&#x27;s defence to both charges, in the court a quo and in this Court, was that he, and not the Children&#x27;s Trust, was entitled to receive the sum of R259 161.21.&quot;

Boesak was charged and found guilty of fraud on 24 March 1999. He was jailed in 2000 and released in 2001, having served just over one year of his three-year sentence.

Although Boesak applied for a presidential pardon from Thabo Mbeki after his release, it was not granted, as the government felt that he had not admitted that he had committed an offence. However, on 15 January 2005, it was announced that he had received a presidential pardon and that his criminal record would be expunged.

Boesak has written a book on his 30 years as an activist – &quot;Running with Horses: Reflections of an Accidental Politician&quot; – which was published in late March 2009. Boesak said that in his book he will explain why the banning of UDF affiliates meant the money could not be accounted for. Boesak declined to testify in his trial in 1999. He maintains that keeping this silence was one of the main reasons for his conviction.

==Politics==
Boesak joined the new Congress of the People party in December 2008, and was selected in February 2009 as the party&#x27;s premier candidate for the Western Cape in the 2009 Provincial and National Elections. In November 2009, Boesak resigned from Congress of the People.

<doc id="1315808" wikidata="Q7696558" url="?curid=1315808" title="Eurasian Singaporeans">
<text>Eurasian Singaporeans is a term that refers to Singaporeans of mixed European–Asian descent. 

The term, which includes – but is not limited to – the creole and indigenous Kristang people, who form a distinct sub-group within the Eurasian community with their own separate language, culture and identity. The Asian ancestry of Eurasians traces to British Malaya, British India, Portuguese India, the Dutch East Indies and French Indochina to other colonies while their European ancestry trace back primarily to Western Europe, particularly the British Isles, although Eurasian settlers to Singapore in the 19th century also came from other European colonies. When the European maritime powers colonised Asian countries from the 16th to 20th centuries, they brought into being a new group of commingled ethnicities known historically as Eurasians.

Early Europeans were primarily male and often had children with local women, as they were usually not accompanied by their womenfolk on their journey to Asia. Initially, the offspring of such a union were brought up as an appendage of European culture, enjoying further advantages not generally accorded to the rest of the local Asian people. In time, as colonial attitudes hardened, Eurasians were largely cast aside by the European authorities and treated much like the rest of the local population, with many of them eventually supporting home rule and independence movements.

==European ancestry==

===Romans and Italians===
The first documented Europeans to visit Southeast Asia were the Romans and Italians. In 166 AD, a Roman mission travelled to China via modern day Vietnam, bringing presents of elephant tusk, rhinoceros horn, and tortoise shell from Southern Asia. Archaeological evidence supports the claim in the Weilüe and Book of Liang that Roman merchants were active in northern Vietnam. Between 1275 and 1292, Marco Polo spent 17 years as an emissary of Kublai Khan, visiting tributary kingdoms in modern day Indonesia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. In the 1320s, Odoric of Pordenone visited Borneo, Champa, and Java. In the 1420s, the Venetian merchant and explorer Niccolo de&#x27; Conti married an Indian woman, and travelled extensively in modern day Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam.

===Of Portuguese descent===
Before the arrival of the Dutch, English and French in Asia, the first Europeans to land and seize territory in Asia were the Portuguese. Portuguese spice-traders first sailed to Malacca in 1509, having already established settlements in Goa and other parts of India. Portuguese explorers and conquerors were accompanied by the first Jesuit priests to Southeast Asia via Goa in Portuguese India. Afonso de Albuquerque, the viceroy of India, conquered Malacca (today just a few hours&#x27; drive from Singapore) in 1511, while Jesuit Francis Xavier, (a Basque Spaniard serving the Portuguese Crown) arrived in Malacca in 1545. The creole/indigenous descendants of mixed marriages between Portuguese colonisers and local Malay residents are today called the Jenti Kristang, with their own distinctive language, the Kristang language. Many are descended from individuals who lived in Malacca or other parts of Malaya. Others have ancestors who lived in Java or other parts of Indonesia as a result of being expelled from Malacca after the Portuguese were forcibly ejected from Malacca by the Johore-Dutch alliance in 1641. A few Macanese people of Cantonese-Portuguese ancestry from Macau are also living in Singapore.

====Kristang====
Kristang Eurasians have their own fully separate and natural creole and indigenous culture, identity and language from all other Eurasians and are especially distinct from those who are the offspring of more recent immigrants and expatriates of European and Asian origin (who are also commonly called &quot;Eurasians&quot; in Singapore). The same or similar distinction exists between on the one hand those first- or second-generation Eurasians who typically would share the ethnic identity of one parent more closely, that parent typically not being of Kristang or Portuguese-origin and on the other hand multi-generation(i.e. typically third-generation, fourth-generation and fifth-generation, etc) Eurasians who typically might have at least some distant Kristang-speaking or Iberian-origin ancestry, and many of whom would associate with some Kristang or Portuguese-origin cultural practices (e.g. Kristang songs and Portuguese-origin dances like &quot;Jinkli Nona&quot;) and dine on Kristang Eurasian dishes like Devil&#x27;s curry or &quot;curry debal&quot; in Kristang. As a general rule, first or second-generation Eurasians typically do not have any Kristang-speaking ancestry, do not speak Kristang, generally do not adopt Kristang or Portuguese-origin cultural practices and cues and are less familiar with Kristang Eurasian cuisine, language and history. Simply put, first-generation Eurasians are people whose parents are not Eurasians. Multi-generation (typically third-generation, fourth-generation and fifth-generation, etc) Eurasians are people whose parents or forefathers are themselves Eurasians. Before the twenty-first century, the Kristang were generally disdained and demeaned by other Eurasian groups, being often seen as illiterate, coarse, primitive, backward, unrefined and hypersexual.

===Of Dutch descent===
In 1602, a Dutch trading company called the &quot;Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie&quot; or VOC (literally &quot;United East Indies Company&quot; but better known in English as the Dutch East India Company) was created to conduct trade in the area east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan. In establishing their numerous trade stations spanning across Asia, the Dutch created independent settler societies in each of their colonies, where Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia) became the administrative centre and rendezvous point for the company&#x27;s Asian shipping traffic.

Between 1602 and 1795, the VOC fitted out some 4,700 ships which carried more than a million Europeans to Singapore. More than 70 percent of the one million passengers never actually returned to Europe, making Asia their new home. These early seafarers were not only made up of Dutch, but also included English, Germans, French Huguenots, Italians, Scandinavians and other Europeans who were employed by the VOC. In time, many were assimilated into Dutch colonies situated throughout Asia (though primarily in modern Indonesia) where they were stationed and became part of the respective communities.

Intermarriages between VOC employees and locals were encouraged, which led to the creation of communities of Dutch descendants. Today, there are only five surviving coherent and large communities who are descended from those early intermarriages. They are the Cape Coloureds (South Africa), Basters and Oorlam (Namibia), Burghers (Sri Lanka), and Indos (Indonesia). Other Dutch groups have persisted as a strain among the Anglo-Burmese and Kristang. The Dutch transferred Malacca to the British in 1825 in exchange for territory in Sumatra. The British colonial administration encouraged migration away from Malacca and as a result many Eurasians and other people moved north to thriving Penang (where other Eurasians fleeing Phuket or moving from Kedah also settled) and later south to Singapore as it grew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Dutch descendants in Malaysia and Singapore are primarily made up of Eurasians originating from Malacca, as well as others who emigrated from the East Indies, India and Sri Lanka. Leo and Hilda Campbell were Dutch Burghers who arrived in Singapore from Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) in 1910. The couple planned to migrate to Australia like many Eurasians but due to Hilda suffering a stroke, they remained in Singapore.

===Of British and Irish descent===

The British were the most important Europeans in colonial Singapore, as they were the colonial rulers of the island. A number of British settlers arrived after its colonial status changed in 1867. Interracial marriage was very common in colonial days. Even men who had European wives sometimes had local paramours. European women who moved to Southeast Asia tended to die young. British men took Asian partners and their offspring would be Eurasian. Some who had British nationality preferred to settle in Britain or other parts of the Commonwealth, especially Australia. Many British and other European men of retirement age, instead of going back to cold Europe, would settle in Australia with Asian women, with fewer staying on in Singapore. Apart from being warmer than Europe, Australia was less judgemental than Europe or colonial Singapore to mixed marriages and mixed offspring. Independent Singapore&#x27;s second President, Benjamin Sheares, was a Eurasian of English lineage. E. W. Barker, the former Law Minister, was of mixed- Portuguese, Irish, Japanese, Scottish, Malay and German descent. Author Rex Shelley was of mixed English, Portuguese, Malay and Buginese ancestry. National swimmer Joseph Schooling is a third-generation Singaporean, and is of Eurasian ethnicity. His parents are Colin and May Schooling. May is a Chinese Malaysian and a Singapore permanent resident; while Colin, a businessman, was born in Singapore. Colin&#x27;s grandfather was a British military officer who married a local Portuguese-Eurasian in Singapore. The last name Schooling is believed to be an anglicised surname that originated in Germany.

===Of other European descent===
Other Eurasians in Singapore have parents or are descended from individuals who originated from various parts of Western Europe and its former colonies such as in the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa or elsewhere. There are also some Filipino people of partial Spanish descent. Former Nominated Member of Parliament Eunice Olsen&#x27;s father is of Swedish and Portuguese descent. His grandfather married a Chinese woman in Shanghai and brought her to Singapore. Geraldene Lowe&#x27;s mother’s family was called Luth and came from Schleswig-Holstein, then part of Denmark. During Bismarck’s unification of Germany, they headed to Asia and Australia and married people from various nationalities.

==Asian ancestry==

===Of Chinese descent===
Olympic gold medallist swimmer Joseph Schooling is a Eurasian, as is his father Colin Schooling. His mother May Schooling is a Chinese-Malaysian while his father is of British, Swedish, Kristang and Portuguese descent.

===Of Malay and Indonesian descent===
Author Rex Shelley was of mixed English, Portuguese, Malay and Buginese ancestry.

===Of Japanese and Korean descent===

Other Eurasians in Singapore have parents or are descended from individuals who originated from Japan, Korea or other parts of East Asia. An example is TV personality and presenter Stephanie Carrington, who is half White American and half Korean.

==Double-barrelled race classification in official documents==

Since January 2010, the Government in Singapore has allowed the double-barrelling of race classification by parents of different races when they register their children. A child may be registered, for instance, as Malay-Caucasian or Caucasian-Chinese. Before 2010, the government required children to register as a single race, which was required to be the father&#x27;s. The added flexibility is in response to increasing demographic diversity driven by immigration and more multi-cultural marriages.

==Culture and traditions==

===Languages and Kristang (Portuguese-based creole)===
English is generally spoken as a first language by almost all Eurasians in Singapore. A number of Eurasians speak Asian languages like Malay, Chinese (Mandarin or other Sinitic Languages) or Tamil as a second or third language. Like many Singaporeans, Eurasians will commonly speak Singlish. Some of the elder generation of Kristang Eurasians, typically those who have a Portuguese surname or are of Kristang-speaking descent, speak the Portuguese creole known as &quot;Cristão&quot; or &quot;Papia Kristang&quot; (Speaking Kristang) – the Kristang language at home and within their small community. Kristang is a dying patois and is only spoken by a small minority of Eurasians.

===Religion and education===
The Eurasian community in Singapore includes people that belong to different religions and to no religion, but most of them are Christians, mostly Catholic, with religious celebrations like Christmas typically being an integral part of their lifestyle. Many Eurasians in Singapore have been educated in Catholic mission schools like St Joseph&#x27;s Institution. Protestant Eurasians in Singapore include Anglicans (Episcopals), Presbyterians, Methodists, Lutherans and Evangelicals. Eurasians looked upon an English education as a passport to a better life in colonial Singapore and so their children were among the first to enrol in the earliest English language schools when they were set up. They attained the highest literacy rate among the local groups here. This enabled them to secure comfortable employment, in both public and private sectors, following in the footsteps of their fathers and as a family tradition for the future generations.

===Eurasian cuisine===
Eurasian culinary traditions include (a beef stew), mulligatawny soup (&quot;mulligatani&quot; in Kristang), shepherd&#x27;s pie, vindaloo (&quot;vin d&#x27;arlo&quot; in Kristang) and curry devil (aka &quot;kari debal&quot;, &quot;curry debal&quot; or &quot;devil&#x27;s curry&quot;). Desserts include putugal and sugee cake made with semolina, a dessert that is also associated with the Eurasians, but also with the Peranakan Chinese. Pineapple tarts are also a much-loved dessert, often served at Christmas in Eurasian homes. While the pineapple tart origins are elusive, its fascinating history can be traced back to the Eurasian community, as it combines a unique blend of culinary influences - the pineapple, which was introduced to Asia in the 16th century by the Spanish and Portuguese, made into a jam that is blended with Southeast Asian spices like the star anise, cloves and cinnamon, and baked in a pastry form that applies baking techniques introduced by the Portuguese.

===Prominence in the media, entertainment and fashion industries===
Eurasians are prominent in the media, entertainment and fashion industry and are sought after because of their mixed look. In Singapore, Eurasian models are sometimes called &#x27;Pan-Asians&#x27; for their mixed appearance. Apart from displaying certain Singaporean beauty standards, a common belief among those in the advertising industries of both Singapore and Malaysia is that a Eurasian model can appeal to different ethnic groups of Asian origin and thus there would be no need to create different advertisements to target different groups. For example, an advertisement featuring a Malaysian-Eurasian face could be used in places like Sri Lanka, Nepal, Thailand or Singapore because non-Eurasian Malaysians with their diverse origins could pass off as a Sri Lankan, Nepalese, Thai or Singaporean.

In media and entertainment, father and son Brian and Mark Richmond, Vernetta Lopez and Jean Danker are well-known radio personalities.

Eurasians in Singapore have also made their mark in the artistic and cultural domains. Jeremy Monteiro is a renowned jazz musician and Cultural Medallion winner. Rex Shelly was an award-winning writer known for his novels that feature the Eurasian community in Singapore and Malaysia.

===&#x27;Eurasiana - A Musical Tribute&#x27;===
In June 2009, &#x27;Eurasiana - A Musical Tribute&#x27; marking the 90th anniversary of the Eurasian Association was performed at the Esplanade Concert Hall. It was a showcase of Eurasian music, dance and culture in Singapore. Also performing was the 50-piece Singapore Pop Orchestra led by Maestro Iskandar Ismail.

==Places associated with Eurasians==
Soon after the founding of Singapore by Stamford Raffles in 1819, people from other trading centres in Asia including Eurasians came to Singapore. Wealthy Eurasians set up home along Waterloo Street and Queen Street in the area between Bras Basah Road and Middle Road, not far from today&#x27;s Singapore Management University. The types of houses that they lived in included shophouses, two-storey houses, terrace houses and bungalows. These were typically owned by well-to-do merchants and traders. The houses on Queen Street also consisted of shophouses that were occupied by non-Eurasian coolies. The living conditions in these shophouses were poor but at least the coolies could live close to where they worked. These houses on Queen Street were owned by the more well-to-do Eurasians. Nearby were Catholic schools like St Joseph&#x27;s Institution and the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus as well as other well-known schools that used to be located in the vicinity. A number of buildings and churches of the period in the vicinity still stand today. Today, few Eurasians can be found residing in the Waterloo Street and Queen Street area.

Eurasian families moved out from the enclaves to other locations such as the government quarters in Bukit Timah, the countryside areas in Serangoon and Upper Serangoon, and the then coastal region of Tanjong Katong. There were even kampongs (Malay for “villages”) along Haig Road and Siglap Road that had a concentration of Eurasian families. Another Eurasian enclave known as Little England was located in the area bounded by Farrer Park, Norfolk Road and Rangoon Road. The roads in the area were all named after English counties and towns. Eurasians today can now be found spread thinly across the island in both private and public housing. In past times, many Eurasians lived in the Katong area, as did prominent tour guide Geraldene Lowe in her youth. Katong is commonly considered Singapore&#x27;s main Eurasian enclave because of some history, modern Eurasian literature and the present location of the Eurasian Association, it is more of a Peranakan Chinese enclave.

The leading association for Eurasians in Singapore is the Eurasian Association at 139 Ceylon Road in Katong. The Eurasian Association has played a major role in uniting the community and developing a stronger shared identity. It also a self-help group which serves the Eurasian community in Singapore. It has expanded the definition of Eurasian to include any person of mixed European and Asian parentage. Previously, only persons whose fathers were of European origin or who had European surnames were considered Eurasian. As of the end of 2013, there were 2,128 members of the Eurasian Association of Singapore.

The Singapore Recreation Club facing the Padang, Singapore near City Hall, founded by several Eurasian men, is considered to a social and sports club that is popular amongst the Eurasians in Singapore. E.W. Barker played sports like cricket and hockey for the Singapore Recreation Club (SRC) between 1934 and 1941, when the SRC was almost the strongest team in Singapore.

==Eurasians during the Japanese occupation==
During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, Europeans and Eurasian Singaporeans were generally spared the harsher treatments by the Japanese than other racial groups; however, many of them became an increasing nuisance for their activist efforts, in particular the Catholic societies, who fostered strong community bonds with the local Chinese. From December 1943 to April 1944, a combination of a collapsing currency, rising food and continued social activism culminated in the reactionary and punitive land acquisition strategy which relocated about 400 Roman Catholic Chinese and 300 European/Eurasian families (of which most were land-owners and many Chinese households also ran small businesses or shop-keeps from their homes) that forcibly acquired land and fixed property from homeowners in exchange for an equal area of dry land two miles from the town of Bahau in Negeri Sembilan state in Malaya. Propagandised in the ironic manner of sending them off to live happier, better lives as a purely Catholic community where they could run their own affairs despite the reality that it was meant as a punishment. The responsibility for administering the affairs of the settlement was mockingly bestowed to prominent activist for Chinese welfare under occupation Roman Catholic bishop Monseigneur Adrian Devals. On his own accord, Dr Charles Joseph Pemberton Paglar, President of the Eurasian Welfare Association visited the settlement frequently to bring much needed medical and other supplies as well as give the populace moral strength. Although many of the settlers were educated through missionary schools, and many of the landowners had practised limited subsistence farming on their properties in Singapore, the soil at the Bahau settlement was intentionally apportioned by the Japanese as it consisted of non-arable land where there was insufficient water for irrigation. While the Japanese kept to their policy of restraint against the Europeans and Catholics (mindful of their German and Italian allies), the measure was deliberately intended to result in hardship for the settlers. The entire process which resulted in the deaths of about 500 settlers was extensively concealed under propaganda which sought to portray the departure of Catholic families from Singapore as a willing venture. As many who were relocated were generally of higher social and economic status, the propaganda which depicted better lives, created a resentment in the local populace and misplaced sense of betrayal against those that had initially defended them against the Japanese. The perverse nature of the Japanese propaganda was highly effective and would have lasting ramifications of distrust between the local races and their former colonial protectors. Many suffered from malnutrition, as their subsistence farming attempts could not provide self-sufficiency. In addition, they were plagued by malaria and other diseases. An estimated 500 settlers lost their lives, including Bishop Devals who helped many others to survive the ordeal. After the Japanese surrendered to the British in August 1945, the survivors were allowed to return to Singapore however were not compensated for their land or property.

<text>Antônio Gonçalves Dias (; August 10, 1823 – November 3, 1864) was a Brazilian Romantic poet, playwright, ethnographer, lawyer and linguist. A major exponent of Brazilian Romanticism and of the literary tradition known as &quot;Indianism&quot;, he is famous for writing &quot;Canção do exílio&quot; (arguably the most well-known poem of Brazilian literature), the short narrative poem &quot;I-Juca-Pirama&quot;, the unfinished epic &quot;Os Timbiras&quot;, and many other nationalist and patriotic poems that would award him posthumously with the title of national poet of Brazil. He was also an avid researcher of Native Brazilian languages and folklore.

He is the patron of the 15th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.

==Biography==
Antônio Gonçalves Dias was born in Caxias on August 10, 1823, to a Portuguese father, João Manuel Gonçalves Dias and a &quot;cafuza&quot; mother, Vicência Ferreira. After completing his studies in Latin, French and Philosophy, he went in 1838 to Portugal to earn a degree in Law at the University of Coimbra. There he wrote his most remembered poem, &quot;Canção do exílio&quot;. He graduated in 1845 and returned to Brazil in the same year. He went to Rio de Janeiro, living there until 1854. There he wrote for newspapers, and began to write the drama &quot;Leonor de Mendonça&quot; in 1846 and his first poetry book, &quot;Primeiros Cantos&quot;, in 1847. It was very well-received, and Alexandre Herculano wrote an article praising it. Dias finished his play &quot;Leonor de Mendonça&quot; also in 1847, and tried to have it performed at the Conservatório de Música do Rio de Janeiro, but the play was not accepted.

In 1848, he wrote two more poetry books: &quot;Segundos Cantos&quot; and &quot;Sextilhas de Frei Antão&quot;. In 1849 he became professor of Latin and History at the Colégio Pedro II. In 1851, he published his last poetry book, &quot;Últimos Cantos&quot;. In the same year, he travelled to Northern Brazil, planning to marry 14-year-old Ana Amélia Ferreira do Vale, to whom he dedicated many of his most famous and beautiful love poems, such as &quot;Seus olhos&quot;, &quot;Leviana&quot;, &quot;Palinódia&quot; and &quot;Retratação&quot;. Ana Amélia was the cousin of Alexandre Teófilo de Carvalho Leal, who in his turn was the brother of Antônio Henriques Leal, a famous Brazilian journalist, writer, medician, biographer and historian known as the &quot;Plutarch of Cantanhede&quot;. (Both Alexandre and Antônio were very close friends with Dias, and Antônio would edit Dias&#x27; posthumous works in 1875, in 6 volumes.) However, the girl&#x27;s mother did not allow the marriage, quoting Dias&#x27; mestizo origins as a pretext. (This inspired his famous poem &quot;Ainda uma vez – adeus!&quot;.) Returning to Rio, he married Olímpia Carolina da Costa later on, having with her a stillborn daughter. Dias divorced Olímpia in 1856.

From 1854 to 1858, he went to Europe on special missions for the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, where he studied the state of public instruction in the educational institutions there. In 1856, in Leipzig, he published his three poetry books in a single volume entitled &quot;Cantos&quot;, wrote the first four cantos of the epic poem &quot;Os Timbiras&quot; (that he would leave unfinished) and also published a dictionary of Old Tupi. Returning to Brazil in 1860, he founded the magazine &quot;Guanabara&quot; alongside Joaquim Manuel de Macedo and Manuel de Araújo Porto-Alegre in 1849, and went on expeditions to Negro and Madeira Rivers, as a member of the Scientific Commission of Exploration. In 1862 he returned to Rio de Janeiro, but shortly after went to Europe again. In October 1863 he went to Lisbon, where he translated Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;The Bride of Messina&quot; and some poems by Heinrich Heine.

After a short stay in France, he decided to return to Brazil in 1864, in the ship &quot;Ville de Boulogne&quot;. However, the ship was wrecked on the Bay of Cumã, near the shores of Guimarães, Maranhão. All the passengers but Dias survived the tragedy; he was sleeping in his cabin belowdecks and did not wake up in time to see what was happening; thus he drowned.

Dias had a nephew who was also a poet, Teófilo Dias.

<text>Samir Azzouz (born 27 June 1986) is a Dutch national of Moroccan descent. He was convicted and incarcerated in Nieuw Vosseveld for participation in a criminal organization and punishable preparation of a terrorist crime by attempting to procure heavy firearms and planning terrorist attacks. He was also suspected to be closely related to the terrorist group the Hofstad Network, but has never been prosecuted for membership of the group. In 2006, he was sentenced to eight years&#x27; imprisonment, along with three other militant Islamists. In 2008, the Hague Court of Appeal sentenced Azzouz to nine years&#x27; imprisonment. In 2013, Azzouz was released from jail on license.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Azzouz was born in Amsterdam and grew up in Amsterdam Nieuw-West, an immigrant-dominated neighbourhood. He started on VWO (the highest level in the Dutch secondary school system, granting access to university), but left school before graduating. It was during his time in high school that he began following a radical form of Islam.

In January 2003, Azzouz was arrested in Ukraine. He and a friend were allegedly on their way to Chechnya to wage &#x27;jihad&#x27; against Russia. However, the 17-year-olds lacked proper passports and clothing and had to return to the Netherlands.

In October 2003, Azzouz and four others were arrested in the Netherlands. They were suspected of constituting a terrorist cell, but were released for lack of evidence.

On 30 June 2004, Azzouz was arrested again for the armed robbery of a supermarket. During a search of Azzouz&#x27;s house, police found what they believed to be evidence that Azzouz had been involved in planning several attacks on Dutch targets, such as Schiphol Airport and the nuclear power plant in Borssele. Police found maps of these targets, some chemicals used in explosives, such as fertilizer, and ammunition.

However, at trial, the judge concluded there was insufficient evidence to convict Azzouz on the charge of planning terrorist attacks. He possessed a homemade bomb, but this proved faulty since he had used the wrong type of fertilizer. He was convicted on the charge of illegal possession of firearms and sentenced to three months in jail, but was acquitted of the original terrorism charge.

===2005-present===
On 14 October 2005, Azzouz was arrested again on suspicion of attempting to procure heavy automatic firearms and explosives and planning terrorist attacks against national politicians and the headquarters of the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) in Leidschendam.

On 14 September 2006, the Dutch television program &quot;Nova&quot; broadcast parts of a video-testament of Samir Azzouz.

On 1 December 2006, he was sentenced to eight years&#x27; imprisonment, along with three other militant Islamists. He was held in Nieuw Vosseveld. On 2 October 2008, The Hague Court of Appeal sentenced Azzouz to nine years&#x27; imprisonment for participation in a criminal organization and punishable preparation of a terrorist crime.

On 6 September 2013, Azzouz was released from jail on license, though he was not allowed to associate with certain people, go to certain towns or leave the country.

<text>Agrostophyllum is a genus with about ninety species from the orchid family (Orchidaceae). The genus name is derived from the Greek words (&quot;grass&quot;) and (&quot;leaf&quot;), referring to the grass-like appearance of the leaves of some species.

These epiphytic orchids occur in tropical lowland forests, growing on trunks or branches of trees. They are found from the Seychelles, Madagascar, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia to the Pacific Islands. The center of diversity is to be found in New Guinea, with at least 45 species.

These orchids have elongate, frequently pendulous stems with dense leaves that overlap at their base. They show peculiar, ball-like inflorescences of many bracts, bearing small flowers.

==Sections==
There are four sections in this genus :

*&quot;Dolichodesme&quot; - elongated inflorescence which may have the form of a spike, but also may be partly branched as in a panicle.
*&quot;Agrostophyllum&quot; – Leaves somewhat longer; small flowers on a shortened apical head; a few species may only develop one or two flowers.
*&quot;Oliganthe&quot; - characterised by a much elongated rhizome and pendant sympodia. Leaves and flowers similar to those of the previous section.
*&quot;Appendiculopsis&quot; - slightly elongated, short creeping rhizomes; distichous, crowded, oblong leaves, at right angles with axis of stem, abruptly truncated at base, with a small petiole; terminal or lateral inflorescence; used to belong to the genus &quot;Appendicula&quot;.

<text>In linguistics, focus (abbreviated ) is a grammatical category that conveys which part of the sentence contributes new, non-derivable, or contrastive information. In the English sentence &quot;Mary only insulted BILL&quot;, focus is expressed prosodically by a pitch accent on &quot;Bill&quot; which identifies him as the only person whom Mary insulted. By contrast, in the sentence &quot;Mary only INSULTED Bill&quot;, the verb &quot;insult&quot; is focused and thus expresses that Mary performed no other actions towards Bill. Focus is a cross-linguistic phenomenon and a major topic in linguistics. Research on focus spans numerous subfields including phonetics, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and sociolinguistics.

==Functional approaches==
Information structure has been described at length by a number of linguists as a grammatical phenomenon. Lexicogrammatical structures that code prominence, or focus, of some information over other information has a particularly significant history dating back to the 19th century. Recent attempts to explain focus phenomena in terms of discourse function, including those by Knud Lambrecht and Talmy Givón, often connect focus with the packaging of new, old, and contrasting information. Lambrecht in particular distinguishes three main types of focus constructions: predicate-focus structure, argument-focus structure, and sentence-focus structure. Focus has also been linked to other more general cognitive processes, including attention orientation.

In such approaches, &quot;contrastive focus&quot; is understood as the coding of information that is contrary to the presuppositions of the interlocutor. The topic–comment model distinguishes between the topic (theme) and what is being said about that topic (the comment, rheme, or focus).

==Formalist approaches==
Standard formalist approaches to grammar argue that phonology and semantics cannot exchange information directly (&quot;See Fig. 1&quot;). Therefore, syntactic mechanisms including features and transformations include prosodic information regarding focus that is passed to the semantics and phonology. Focus may be highlighted either prosodically or syntactically or both, depending on the language. In syntax this can be done assigning focus markers, as shown in (1), or by preposing as shown in (2):

:(1) I saw [JOHN] f.
:(2) [JOHN] f, I saw.

In (1), focus is marked syntactically with the subscripted ‘f’ which is realized phonologically by a nuclear pitch accent. Clefting induces an obligatory intonation break. Therefore, in (2), focus is marked via word order and a nuclear pitch accent.

In English, focus also relates to phonology and has ramifications for how and where suprasegmental information such as rhythm, stress, and intonation is encoded in the grammar, and in particular intonational tunes that mark focus. Speakers can use pitch accents on syllables to indicate what word(s) are in focus. New words are often accented while given words are not. The accented word(s) forms the focus domain. However, not all of the words in a focus domain need be accented. (See for rules on accent placement and focus-marking). The focus domain can be either &quot;broad&quot;, as shown in (3), or &quot;narrow&quot;, as shown in (4) and (5):

:(3) Did you see a grey dog or a cat? I saw [a grey DOG] f.
:(4) Did you see a grey dog or a grey cat? I saw a grey [DOG] f.
:(5) Did you see a grey dog or a black dog? I saw a [GREY] f dog.

The question/answer paradigm shown in (3)–(5) has been utilized by a variety of theorists to illustrate the range of contexts a sentence containing focus can be used felicitously. Specifically, the question/answer paradigm has been used as a diagnostic for what counts as new information. For example, the focus pattern in (3) would be infelicitous if the question was ‘Did you see a grey dog or a black dog?’.

In (3) and (4), the pitch accent is marked in bold. In (3), the pitch accent is placed on &quot;dog&quot; but the entire noun phrase &quot;a grey dog&quot; is under focus. In (4), the pitch accent is also placed on &quot;dog&quot; but only the noun &quot;dog&quot; is under focus. In (5), pitch accent is placed on &quot;grey&quot; and only the adjective &quot;grey&quot; is under focus.

Historically, generative proposals made focus a feature bound to a single word within a sentence. Chomsky and Halle formulated a Nuclear Stress Rule that proposed there to be a relation between the main stress of a sentence and a single constituent. Since this constituent is prominent sententially in a way that can contrast with lexical stress, this was originally referred to as &quot;nuclear&quot; stress. The purpose of this rule was to capture the intuition that within each sentence, there is one word in particular that is accented more prominently due to its importance – this is said to form the nucleus of that sentence.
Focus was later suggested to be a structural position at the beginning of the sentence (or on the left periphery) in Romance languages such as Italian, as the lexical head of a Focus Phrase (or FP, following the X-bar theory of phrase structure). Jackendoff, Selkirk, Rooth, Krifka, Schwarzschild argue that focus consists of a feature that is assigned to a node in the syntactic representation of a sentence.
Because focus is now widely seen as corresponding between heavy stress, or nuclear pitch accent, this feature is often associated with the phonologically prominent element(s) of a sentence.

Sound structure (phonological and phonetic) studies of focus are not as numerous, as relational language phenomena tend to be of greater interest to syntacticians and semanticists. But this may be changing: a recent study found that not only do focused words and phrases have a higher range of pitch compared to words in the same sentence but that words following the focus in both American English and Mandarin Chinese were lower than normal in pitch and words before a focus are unaffected. The precise usages of focus in natural language are still uncertain. A continuum of possibilities could possibly be defined between precisely enunciated and staccato styles of speech based on variations in pragmatics or timing.

Currently, there are two central themes in research on focus in generative linguistics. First, given what words or expressions are prominent, what is the meaning of some sentence? Rooth, Jacobs, Krifka, and von Stechow claim that there are lexical items and construction specific-rules that refer directly to the notion of focus. Dryer, Kadmon, Marti, Roberts, Schwarzschild, Vallduvi, and Williams argue for accounts in which general principles of discourse explain focus sensitivity. Second, given the meaning and syntax of some sentence, what words or expressions are prominent?

===Prominence and meaning===

Focus directly affects the semantics, or meaning, of a sentence. Different ways of pronouncing the sentence affects the meaning, or, what the speaker intends to convey. Focus distinguishes one interpretation of a sentence from other interpretations of the same sentence that do not differ in word order, but may differ in the way in which the words are taken to relate to each other. To see the effects of focus on meaning, consider the following examples:

:(6) John only introduced Bill to SUE.

In (6), accent is placed on Sue. There are two readings of (6) – broad focus shown in (7) and narrow focus shown in (8):

:(7) John only [introduced Bill to SUE] f.
:(8) John only introduced Bill to [SUE] f.

The meaning of (7) can be summarized as &quot;the only thing John did was introduce Bill to Sue&quot;. The meaning of (8) can be summarized as &quot;the only person to whom John introduced Bill is Sue&quot;.

In both (7) and (8), focus is associated with the focus sensitive expression &quot;only&quot;. This is known as association with focus. The class of focus sensitive expressions in which focus can be associated with includes exclusives (&quot;only&quot;, &quot;just&quot;) non-scalar additives (&quot;merely&quot;, &quot;too&quot;) scalar additives (&quot;also&quot;, &quot;even&quot;), particularlizers (&quot;in particular&quot;, &quot;for example&quot;), intensifiers, quantificational adverbs, quantificational determiners, sentential connectives, emotives, counterfactuals, superlatives, negation and generics. It is claimed that focus operators must c-command their focus.

====Alternative semantics====

In the alternative semantics approach to focus pioneered by Mats Rooth, each constituent formula_1 has both an ordinary denotation formula_2 and a focus denotation formula_3 which are composed by parallel computations. The ordinary denotation of a sentence is simply whatever denotation it would have in a non-alternative-based system while its focus denotation can be thought of as the set containing all ordinary denotations one could get by substituting the focused constituent for another expression of the same semantic type. For a sentence such as (9), the ordinary denotation will be the proposition which is true iff Mary likes Sue. Its focus denotation will be the set of each propositions such that for some contextually relevant individual &#x27;x&#x27;, that proposition is true iff Mary likes &#x27;x&#x27;. 

:(9) Mary likes [SUE]f.

In formal terms, the ordinary denotation of (9) will be as shown below:

* formula_4.

Focus denotations are computed using the &quot;alternative sets&quot; provided by alternative semantics. In this system, most unfocused items denote the singleton set containing their ordinary denotations.

* formula_5
* formula_6

Focused constituents denote the set of all (contextually relevant) semantic objects of the same type.

* formula_7, where &quot;E&quot; is the domain of entities or individuals.

In alternative semantics, the primary composition rule is &quot;Pointwise Functional Application&quot;. This rule can be thought of as analogous to the cross product.

* Pointwise Functional Application: If formula_1 is a constituent with daughters formula_9 and formula_10 which are of type formula_11 and formula_12 respectively, then formula_13

Applying this rule to example (9) would give the following focus denotation if the only contextually relevant individuals are Sue, Bill, Lisa, and Mary

* formula_14

The focus denotation can be &quot;caught&quot; by focus-sensitive expressions like &quot;only&quot; as well as other covert items such as the squiggle operator.

====Structured meanings====

Following Jacobs and Williams, Krifka argues differently. Krifka claims focus partitions the semantics into a background part and focus part, represented by the pair:

::formula_15

The logical form of which represented in lambda calculus is:

::formula_16

This pair is referred to as a &quot;structured meaning&quot;. Structured meanings allow for a compositional semantic approach to sentences that involve single or multiple foci. This approach follows Frege&#x27;s (1897) Principle of Compositionality: the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its parts, and the way in which those parts are combined into structured meanings. Krifka’s structured meaning theory represents focus in a transparent and compositional fashion it encompasses sentences with more than one focus as well as sentences with a single focus. Krifka claims the advantages of structured meanings are twofold: 1) We can access the meaning of an item in focus directly, and 2) Rooth&#x27;s alternative semantics can be derived from a structured meaning approach but not vice versa. To see Krifka’s approach illustrated, consider the following examples of single focus shown in (10) and multiple foci shown in (11):

:(10) John introduced Bill to [SUE] f.
:(11) John only introduced [BILL] f to [SUE] f.

Generally, the meaning of (10) can be summarized as &quot;John introduced Bill to Sue and no one else&quot;, and the meaning of (11) can be summarized as &quot;the only pair of persons such that John introduced the first to the second is Bill and Sue&quot;.

Specifically, the structured meaning of (10) is:

::formula_17 where &quot;introd&quot; is the denotation of &quot;introduce&quot;, j &quot;John&quot;, b &quot;Bill&quot; and s &quot;Sue&quot;.

The background part of the structured meaning is; &quot;introd (j, b, x)&quot;; and the focus part is &quot;s&quot;.

Through a (modified) form of functional application (or beta reduction), the focus part of (10) and (11) is projected up through the syntax to the sentential level. Importantly, each intermediate level has distinct meaning.

===Focus marking===

It has been claimed that &quot;new&quot; information in the discourse is accented while &quot;given&quot; information is not. Generally, the properties of &quot;new&quot; and &quot;given&quot; are referred to as a word&#x27;s discourse status. Definitions of &quot;new&quot; and &quot;given&quot; vary. Halliday defines &quot;given&quot; as &quot;anaphorically&quot; recoverable, while &quot;new&quot; is defined to be &quot;textually and situationally non-derivable information&quot;. To illustrate this point, consider the following discourse in (12) and (13):

:(12) Why don’t you have some French TOAST?
:(13) I’ve forgotten how to MAKE French toast.

In (13) we note that the verb &quot;make&quot; is not given by the sentence in (12). It is discourse new. Therefore, it is available for accentuation. However, &quot;toast&quot; in (13) is given in (12). Therefore, it is not available for accentuation. As previously mentioned, pitch accenting can relate to focus. Accented words are often said to be in focus or F-marked often represented by F-markers. The relationship between accent placement is mediated through the discourse status of particular syntactic nodes. The percolation of F-markings in a syntactic tree is sensitive to argument structure and head-phrase relations.

====Selkirk and accent placement====

Selkirk develops an explicit account of how F-marking propagates up syntactic trees. Accenting indicates F-marking. F-marking projects up a given syntactic tree such that both lexical items, i.e. terminal nodes and phrasal levels, i.e. nonterminal nodes, can be F-marked. Specifically, a set of rules determines how and where F-marking occurs in the syntax. These rules are shown in (1) and (2):

:(14) Basic Rule: An accented word is f-marked.
:(15) Focus Projection:
::a. F-marking the head of a phrase licenses F-marking of the phrase.
::b. F-marking of the internal argument of a head licenses the F-marking of the head.
::c. F-marking of the antecedent of a trace left by NP or wh-movement licenses F-marking of the trace.

To see how (14) and (15) apply, consider the following example:

::Judy f [adopted f a parrot f] f] foc

Because there is no rule in (14) or (15) that licenses F-marking to the direct object from any other node, the direct object &quot;parrot&quot; must be accented as indicated in bold. Rule (15b) allows F-marking to project from the direct object to the head verb &quot;adopted&quot;. Rule (15a) allows F-marking to project from the head verb to the VP &quot;adopted a parrot&quot;. Selkirk assumes the subject &quot;Judy&quot; is accented if F-marked as indicated in bold.

====Schwarzschild and accent placement====

Schwarzschild points out weaknesses in Selkirk’s ability to predict accent placement based on facts about the discourse. Selkirk’s theory says nothing about how accentuation arises in sentences with entirely old information. She does not fully articulate the notion of discourse status and its relation to accent marking. Schwarzschild differs from Selkirk in that he develops a more robust model of discourse status. Discourse status is determined via the entailments of the context. This is achieved through the definition in (16):

:(16) Definition of given: An utterance of U counts as given if it has a salient antecedent A and
::a. if U is type e, then A and U corefer;
::b. otherwise: modulo formula_18-type-shifting, A entails the existential F-closure of U.

The operation in (16b) can apply to any constituent. formula_18-type-shifting &quot;is a way of transforming syntactic constituents into full propositions so that it is possible to check whether they are entailed by the context&quot;. For example, the result of formula_18-type-shifting the VP in (17) is (18):

:(17) [hums a happy tune]
:(18) formula_18&quot;x&quot;[&quot;x&quot; hums a happy tune]

Note that (18) is a full proposition. The existential F-closure in (16b) refers to the operation of replacing the highest F-marked node with an existentially closed variable. The operation is shown in (19) and (20):

:(19) formula_18&quot;x&quot;[&quot;x&quot; hums [a happy f tune f] f]
:(20) formula_18&quot;Y&quot;formula_18&quot;x&quot;[&quot;x&quot; hums &quot;Y&quot;]

Given the discourse context in (21a) it is possible to determine the discourse status of any syntactic node in (21b):

:(21)
::a. Sean [hummed a happy tune] VP
::b. Angie [hummed [Chopin’s Funeral March] f] VP

If the VP in (21a) is the salient antecedent for the VP in (21b), then the VP in (21b) counts as given. formula_18-type-shifed VP in (21a) is shown in (22). The existential F-closure of the VP in (21b) is shown in (23):

:(22) formula_18&quot;x&quot;[&quot;x&quot; hums a happy tune]
:(23) formula_18&quot;Y&quot;formula_18&quot;x&quot;[&quot;x&quot; hums &quot;Y&quot;]

(22) entails (23). Therefore, the VP of (21b) counts as given. Schwarzschild assumes an optimality theoretic grammar. Accent placement is determined by a set of violable, hierarchically ranked constraints as shown in (24):

:(24)
::a. GIVENness: A constituent that is not F-marked is given.
::b. Foc: A Foc-marked phrase contains an accent
::c. AvoidF: Do not F-mark
::d. HeadArg: A head is less prominent than its internal argument.

The ranking Schwarzschild proposes is seen in (25):

:(25) GIVENness, Foc » AvoidF » HeadArg

As seen, GIVENness relates F-marking to discourse status. Foc relates F-marking to accent placement. Foc simply requires that a constituent(s) of an F-marked phrase contain an accent. AvoidF states that less F-marking is preferable to more F-marking. HeadArg encodes the head-argument asymmetry into the grammar directly.

=====Responses=====

Recent empirical work by German &quot;et al.&quot; suggests that both Selkirk’s and Schwarzschild’s theory of accentuation and F-marking makes incorrect predictions. Consider the following context:

:(26) Are the children playing their game?
:(27) Paul took down their tent that they play their game in.

It has been noted that prepositions are intrinsically weak and do not readily take accent. However, both Selkirk and Schwarzschild predict that in the narrow focus context, an accent will occur at most on the preposition in (27) as shown in (28):

:(28) Paul took down their tent that they [play their game [in f t f] foc].

However, the production experiment reported in German &quot;et al.&quot; showed that subjects are more likely to accent verbs or nouns as opposed to prepositions in the narrow focused context, thus ruling out accent patterns shown in (28). German &quot;et al.&quot; argue for a stochastic constraint-based grammar similar to Anttila and Boersma that more fluidly accounts for how speakers accent words in discourse.

<doc id="1315852" wikidata="Q5267251" url="?curid=1315852" title="Devil's curry">
<text>Devil curry also known as curry Debal in Kristang is a very spicy curry flavoured with candlenuts, galangal, mustard seed and vinegar from the Eurasian Kristang (&quot;Cristão&quot;) culinary tradition in Malacca, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Indo-Dutch diaspora (where it is known as Ayam ore Daging Setan). It was historically served one or two days after Christmas and on other special occasions. 

Kristang cuisine blends the cuisines of Southeast Asia with a western-style cuisine inherited from Portuguese colonial rulers. Debal Curry traces its roots to the Goan Vindahlo which also features vinegar as an important component inherited from Portuguese culinary traditions. Other popular Kristang dishes include (a beef stew) and sugee cake.

== Etymology ==
In the original Kristang, &quot;Debal&quot; means &quot;leftover&quot;, as it is often served one or two days after Christmas and made out of leftovers from the Christmas meal. It is now however a regular menu item in Eurasian homes made from fresh ingredients. The similarity of the words debal and devil, probably paired with spiciness of the dish, lead to it being adopted into the English language as &quot;Devil curry&quot;. The term &quot;deviled&quot;, in reference to food is often used with spicy or zesty food, including foods prepared with mustard as an ingredient.

<doc id="1315857" wikidata="Q800858" url="?curid=1315857" title="Gunnersbury station">
<text>Gunnersbury () is an interchange station in Gunnersbury, London, situated on the District line of the London Underground and the Mildmay line of the London Overground. The station is located off Chiswick High Road (A315) and opened on 1 January 1869.

The station is located in Travelcard Zone 3. On the District line, the station is between and ; and on the Mildmay line, it is between and Kew Gardens.

==History==
The station was opened as Brentford Road on 1 January 1869 by the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR) on a new branch line to built from the West London Joint Railway starting north of Addison Road station (now ). The line ran through Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Hammersmith via a now closed curve and Grove Road station in Hammersmith (also now closed). A short connection was also made from the North &amp; South Western Junction Railway (N&amp;SWJR) line to meeting the L&amp;SWR line immediately north of the station. This line was served by the North London Railway (NLR).

Brentford Road station originally had four platforms; two on the line to Richmond and two serving a loop (the Chiswick Curve) which connected to the line through Kew Bridge station.

Between 1 June 1870 and 31 October 1870 the Great Western Railway (GWR) briefly ran services from to Richmond via Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (now the Hammersmith &amp; City line) tracks to Grove Road then on the L&amp;SWR tracks through Gunnersbury.

The station was given its current name in 1871.

On 1 June 1877, the District Railway (DR, now the District line) opened a short extension from its terminus at Hammersmith to connect to the L&amp;SWR tracks east of station. The DR then began running trains over the L&amp;SWR tracks to Richmond. On 1 October 1877, the Metropolitan Railway (MR, now the Metropolitan line) restarted the GWR&#x27;s former service to Richmond via Grove Road station.

The DR&#x27;s service between Richmond, Hammersmith and central London was more direct than the NLR&#x27;s route via , the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s or the MR&#x27;s routes via Grove Road station or the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s other route from Richmond via . From 1 January 1894, the GWR began sharing the MR&#x27;s Richmond service and served Gunnersbury once again, meaning that passengers from Gunnersbury could travel on the services of five operators.

Following the electrification of the DR&#x27;s own tracks north of in 1903, the DR funded the electrification of the tracks through Gunnersbury. The tracks on the Richmond branch were electrified on 1 August 1905. Whilst DR services were operated with electric trains, the L&amp;SWR, NLR, GWR and MR services continued to be steam hauled.

MR services were withdrawn on 31 December 1906 and GWR services were withdrawn on 31 December 1910 leaving operations at Gunnersbury to the DR (by then known as the District Railway), the NLR and L&amp;SWR. By 1916, the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s route through Hammersmith was being out-competed by the District to such a degree that the L&amp;SWR withdrew its service between Richmond and Addison Road on 3 June 1916, leaving the District as the sole operator over that route.

In 1932, the Chiswick Curve was closed and the tracks were later removed. The site of the curve is now known as a housing estate known as Chiswick Village.
On 8 December 1954 the station was damaged by a tornado which ripped off the roof and injured six people.

In the 1960s the station was redeveloped with just the two platforms it currently possesses. The London Overground and London Underground services share the same tracks.
==Services==
Gunnersbury currently has the following London Overground (Mildmay line) and London Underground (District line) services, which are operated by Class 378 and S7 Stock trains respectively:

;London Underground
Off-peak:
*6tph to Upminster
*6tph to Richmond

;London Overground
Off-peak (including Sundays):
*4tph to Stratford
*4tph to Richmond

==Arrangement==
London Underground is classed as an open access operator between Richmond and Acton Lane Junction with LU purchasing individual slots on the North London line from Network Rail.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 110, 237, 267, 440, H91 and night route N9 serve the station.

<doc id="1315861" wikidata="Q3097825" url="?curid=1315861" title="The Birds (band)">
<text>The Birds were an English rhythm and blues band, formed in 1964 in London. They recorded fewer than a dozen songs and released only four singles.

Starting out with a hard R&amp;B sound, they later began infusing it with Motown-style vocal harmonies. The best known former member of the Birds is Ronnie Wood playing lead guitar, who went on to join the Jeff Beck Group, the Creation, Faces and later the Rolling Stones.

==Career==
Several members of the Birds grew up in the same neighbourhood in Yiewsley, Middlesex, and began playing together in 1964, while still in their teens. At first calling themselves the Thunderbirds, they started out playing local clubs and a neighbourhood community centre, but they soon expanded to a larger club circuit. When they were hired to play on the same bill as Chris Farlowe, whose back-up band was also called the Thunderbirds, they shortened their name to the Birds – a decision which would have significant ramifications later.

Their hard R&amp;B sound was good enough to get them into a battle-of-the-bands contest held under the show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;. When the band made their first television appearance, they caught the eye of Decca record company executives. The ensuing recording contract resulted in their first two singles, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me&quot; and &quot;Leaving Here&quot;. The Birds seemed destined for stardom with their loud rhythm-and-blues based music, receiving equal billing with the Who at some concerts.

However, in the spring of 1965, the Los Angeles–based band the Byrds was dominating the UK Singles Chart with their folk-rock version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, released by the newly formed British CBS Records. When the Byrds arrived in England for their first British tour that summer, the Birds&#x27; manager, Leo de Clerck, took legal action to prevent them from using the name; the action failed, amid a flurry of national press and television coverage. The group parted ways with de Clerck soon afterwards.

After releasing the third Decca single in late 1965, the band moved to Reaction Records, whose director, Robert Stigwood, suggested they change their name to &quot;The Birds Birds&quot;, to distinguish themselves from the American band. In 1966, the band did a cameo appearance in the horror film &quot;The Deadly Bees&quot;, performing their song &quot;That&#x27;s All I Need you For&quot;, and an excerpt from their recording of &quot;How Can It Be&quot; was featured in the 1966 British horror film &quot;The Psychopath&quot;. By 1967 the group had disbanded. Both Gardner and Wood went on to join the Creation, with Gardner then joining Ashton, Gardner and Dyke.

In 2010, Ali McKenzie started to play gigs with the members of Small Fakers (a Small Faces tribute band), under the name the Birds. McKenzie died on 30 April 2021.

<text>The Sendeturm Dobratsch (Dobratsch Transmitter Tower) is a radio tower on the Dobratsch mountain, the easternmost peak of the Gailtal Alps near Villach in Carinthia, Austria. 

The transmitter was built in 1971 and succeeded a provisional facility on the lower Pyramidenkogel mountain near Klagenfurt. It consists of a concrete tower which carries a guyed steel tube mast on the top, similar to the Gerbrandy Tower in the Netherlands. The tower is located at an altitude of above sea-level, its total height is . The transmission facility can be reached by a private cable car from Bad Bleiberg.

The Dobratsch Transmitter Tower is used for directional radio services and FM broadcasting as well as for DVB-T transmission of several TV programmes. 125,000 watts ERP make it the strongest transmitter of Austria. It supplies virtually the entire state of Carinthia as well as adjacent regions in Styria, Italy (Friuli-Venezia Giulia) and Slovenia (Upper Carniola).

<doc id="1315883" wikidata="Q2273085" url="?curid=1315883" title="LNWR electric units">
<text>The LNWR electric units were ordered by the London and North Western Railway for its suburban services in London. The first cars, made with Siemens equipment, arrived in 1914, and these were followed by two larger batches of units with Oerlikon equipment. The trains were formed into 3-car units, with first and third class accommodation in open saloons. Following the 1923 grouping and absorption of the line into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), similar LMS electric units, but with accommodation in compartments, were purchased to run with the Oerlikon units in 1926 and 1932. The trains were all withdrawn by 1960.

==Service introduction==

The London and North Western Railway&#x27;s inner-suburban network encompassed the lines from London Broad Street to Richmond and London Euston to Watford and branch lines such as Watford to Croxley Green. With links to the District Railway at Earl&#x27;s Court and over the route to Richmond, and the Bakerloo line being extended over the Watford DC lines, the railway was electrified with 630 V DC fourth rails. The electricity was generated at the LNWR&#x27;s power station in Stonebridge Park and a depot built at Croxley Green. 

The first four electric multiple units used Siemens electrical equipment and were composed of a driving trailer third, composite trailer and driving motor third with four traction motors. The trains seated 38 first and 138 third class passengers in open saloons. These entered service on the West London Line route between Willesden and Earl&#x27;s Court in November 1914, although the LNWR had been operating services since May using stock borrowed from the District Railway.

==Oerlikon units==
The second batch of trains, 38 three-car sets and 5 spare motor cars, used Swiss Oerlikon equipment and was generally similar to the Siemens powered stock. The four traction motors were rated at and these trains seated 33 first and 130 third class passengers. The third class accommodation was a mixture of longitudinal seating and seats arranged in facing bays in pairs on either side of the gangway. The first class accommodation (downgraded to third class at the beginning of the Second World War), occupied two of the three saloons into which the intermediate car was divided, one being for smokers and the centre saloon for non-smokers. The saloons were separated by swing doors with frosted glass or bevelled plain glass glazing, the latter having an etched LNWR script decorative monogram. The first class seating was in facing pairs arranged 2+1 on either side of the gangway, and the general ambience was Edwardian-luxurious, with mahogany panelling. Above the seats were glazed frames which displayed photographs of landscapes and towns served by the London and North Western Railway; these were retained to the end.

Glazing consisted of large fixed lights with two small outward-opening lights above a transom; some were top-hinged and others side-hinged to provide alternative ventilation. Entrance doors were single-leaf sliding, and hand operated.

 For operation on the extension of the Bakerloo line, the LNWR and the London Electric Railway (LER) ordered new Watford Joint Stock, but were delayed by World War I, not arriving until 1920. The electrification of the line to was completed in 1922 and a further 75 three-car Oerlikon units and 3 spare motor cars were received.

After the 1923 grouping, the LNWR became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). In 1926 and 1932, further 3-car LMS electric units, similar to the LNWR electric units but with compartments, arrived to strengthen the London fleet.

==Numbering==
The LMS numbers of the Siemens stock were:
* DMBT, 28219–28222

The LMS numbers of the Oerlikon stock were:
* DMBT, 28000, 28223–28299 (28236 is missing from the list in the source)

==Operation==
The LNWR electric lines built up to a substantial operation, at its peak in the 1930s-50s period, and then ran into a major decline. The two basic main services were Euston to Watford Junction, and Broad Street to Richmond, the latter passing over the former at Willesden Junction station. In addition there was a substantial operation of Broad Street to Watford Junction trains via Primrose Hill, which shared significant sections of both main routes. There were lesser branches from Willesden Junction to Earls Court (closed during WWII), Watford to Rickmansworth (closed in 1952) and Watford to Croxley Green (closed in 1990). The Earls Court route was the normal operation for the four pioneer Siemens-equipped trains.

In an early 1950s timetable, there were substantial peak period electric services on the main routes. Departing between 5 pm and 6 pm there were four trains in the hour on Broad Street to Richmond (the &quot;North London line&quot;), five in the hour on Euston to Watford (the &quot;DC line&quot;), and seven in the hour on Broad Street to Watford. All these were scheduled for 6-car trains. A small number of the peak hour Watford line trains were operated at the northern end directly to Croxley Green instead of to Watford Junction. In addition certain trains from the Bakerloo Line of the Underground ran over the line from Queens Park to Harrow &amp; Wealdstone or Watford Junction. The services were not on a particularly regular interval basis as there was the need for them to interleave with many other operations, and each other; in addition, some trains were on a semi-fast basis, or skipped certain stations. The Croxley and Rickmansworth lines were normally operated by 3-car shuttle trains. The pre-war Earls Court trains had been similar.

The combined frequency of the electric trains from South Hampstead to Watford was thus about every five minutes, and the through Bakerloo trains were additional to this. This very substantial operation (compared to later years) was behind the installation of the pioneer automated signalling system in 1933, which lasted until 1988 when replaced by a conventional system, by which time services were substantially reduced. The 1933 signalling system had allowed scheduled headways of two minutes on the route.

==Liveries==
The units carried three liveries during their life. They entered service in the LNWR &quot;plum and spilt milk&quot; livery. During the LMS period, they operated in crimson livery fully lined-out to represent timber panelling. On nationalisation, over a period of about three years, they received Southern Green livery with the BR &quot;cycling lion&quot; emblem half-way along the lower side of the motor coaches and retained this until withdrawal.

==Rebuilding==
At least two motor coaches, M28247M and M28282M, were rebuilt with flush panels and windows with large radius curves to the lower corners, giving them a more modern appearance. The reason for this is unknown, but it may have been a war-damage repair.

==Withdrawal==
The Watford Joint Stock was replaced on Bakerloo line services in 1930–31, with the LMS retaining three sets for use on branch lines until 1946. The Siemens stock trains were stored after the withdrawal of passenger services over the West London Railway following bomb damage in 1940. In 1952, they were converted to prototype 25 kV AC overhead EMUs (Class AM1) and ran on the Lancaster-Morecambe-Heysham line until 1966. The Oerlikon stock trains were replaced between 1957 and 1960 by Class 501 units, and a motor car, DMBT No. 28249, is currently exhibited at the National Railway Museum, York. The LMS electric units were withdrawn in 1963.

<text>Prince Alexander Andreyevich Bezborodko (; 6 April 1799) was the chancellor of the Russian Empire from 1797 to 1799, and the chief architect of Catherine the Great&#x27;s foreign policy after the death of Nikita Panin.

==Early life==
Аleksander Bezborodko was born in Glukhov, Cossack Hetmanate, Russian Empire (now Hlukhiv, Ukraine) on into a family of Zaporozhian Cossack noble descent. His father, Andrey Bezborodko, was a general scribe (chancellor), while his mother, Eudokia, was a daughter of the general judge Mikhail Zabila.

He was educated at home and at Kiev-Mohyla Academy. Upon finishing his education, he entered the public service as a clerk in the office of Peter Rumyantsev, then the governor-general of Little Russia, whom he accompanied to the Turkish War in 1768. He was present at the engagements of Larga and Kagul, and at the storming of Silistria.

On the conclusion of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774, the field marshal recommended him to Catherine II, and she appointed him in 1775 her petition-secretary. He thus had the opportunity of impressing the empress with his brilliant gifts, the most remarkable of which were exquisite manners, a marvellous memory and a clear and pregnant style. At the same time he set to work to acquire the principal European languages, especially French, of which he became a master. It was at this time that he wrote his historical sketches of the Tatar wars and of Ukraine.

His activity was prodigious, and Catherine called him her . In 1780, he accompanied her on her journey through Novorossiya, meeting the emperor Joseph II, who urged him to study diplomacy. On his return from a delicate mission to Copenhagen, he presented to the empress &quot;a memorial on political affairs&quot; which comprised the first plan of a partition of Turkey between Russia and Austria. This document was transmitted almost word for word to Vienna as the Russian proposals. He followed this up by &quot;Epitomised Historical Information concerning Moldavia&quot;. For these two state papers he was rewarded with the posts of &quot;plenipotentiary for all negotiations &quot; in the foreign office and postmaster-general.

==Career under Catherine II==
From this time he was inseparably associated with Catherine in all important diplomatic affairs, though officially he was the subordinate of the vice-chancellor, Count Ivan Osterman. He wrote all the most important despatches to the Russian ministers abroad, concluded and subscribed all treaties, and performed all the functions of a secretary of state. He identified himself entirely with Catherine&#x27;s political ideas, even with that of re-establishing the Greek empire under her grandson Constantine. The empress, as usual, richly rewarded her comes with pensions and principalities. In 1786, he was promoted to the Governing Senate, and it was through him that the empress communicated her will to that august state-decoration. In 1787 he accompanied Catherine on her triumphal progress through South Russia in the capacity of minister of foreign affairs. At Kanev, he conducted the negotiations with the Polish king, Stanislaus II, and at Novaya Kaidaniya he was in the empress&#x27;s carriage when she received Joseph II.

The second Turkish War (1787–1792) and the Swedish war with Gustavus III (1788–1790) heaped fresh burdens on his already heavily laden shoulders, and he suffered from the intrigues of his numerous jealous rivals, including the empress&#x27;s latest favorite, A. M. Mamonov. All his efforts were directed towards the conclusion of the two oppressive wars by an honorable peace. The pause of Verela with Gustavus III (14 August 1790) was on the terms dictated by him. On the sudden death of Potemkin, he was despatched to Jassy to prevent the peace congress there from breaking up, and succeeded, in the face of all but insuperable difficulties, in concluding a treaty exceedingly advantageous to Russia (9 January 1792). For this service he received the thanks of the empress, the ribbon of St. Andrew, and 50,000 rubles.

On his return from Jassy, however, he found his confidential post of secretary of petitions occupied by the empress&#x27;s last favorite, Platon Zubov. He complained of this &quot;diminution of his dignity&quot; to the empress in a private memorial in the course of 1793. The empress reassured him by fresh honors and distinctions on the occasion of the solemn celebration of the peace of Jassy (2 September 1793), when she publicly presented him with a golden olive-branch encrusted with brilliants. Subsequently, Catherine reconciled him with Zubov, and he resumed the conduct of foreign affairs. He contributed more than any other man to bring about the downfall and the third partition of Poland, for which he was magnificently recompensed.

==Grand Chancellor of the Russian Empire==
But diplomacy by no means exhausted Bezborodko&#x27;s capacity for work. He had a large share in the internal administration also. He reformed the post-office, improved the banking system of Russia, regulated the finances, constructed roads, and united the Uniate and Orthodox churches. On the death of Catherine, Emperor Paul entrusted Bezborodko with the examination of the late empress&#x27;s private papers, and shortly afterwards made him a prince of the Russian Empire, with a correspondingly splendid apanage. On the retirement of Osterman he received the highest dignity in the Russian Empire – that of imperial chancellor.

Bezborodko was the only Russian minister who retained the favor of Paul to the last. During the last two years of his life, control of Russia&#x27;s diplomacy was entirely in his hands. His programme at this period was peace with all the European powers, revolutionary France included. But the emperor&#x27;s growing aversion to this pacific policy induced the astute old minister to attempt to &quot;seek safety in moral and physical repose.&quot; Paul, however, refused to accept his resignation and would have sent him abroad for the benefit of his health, had not a sudden stroke of paralysis prevented Bezborodko from taking advantage of his master&#x27;s kindness. 

He died in Saint Petersburg on 6 April 1799.

==Personal qualities==
In private life, Bezborodko was a typical Catherinian, corrupt, licentious, conscienceless and self-seeking. But he was infinitely generous and affectionate, and spent his enormous fortune liberally. His banquets were magnificent, his collections of pictures and statues unique in Europe. He was the best friend of his innumerable poor relatives, and the Maecenas of all the struggling authors of his day. Sycophantic he might have been, but he was neither ungrateful nor vindictive. His patriotism is as indisputable as his genius.

== Residences ==
===Bezborodko Palace in Saint Petersburg===
The Bezborodko Palace is located at Pochtamtsky Pereulok in Saint Petersburg.

The palace was built in 1783–1795 to a design by Giacomo Quarenghi. There emerged a palace designed according to the principles of Russian Classicism. While the façade of the mansion looked fairly modest, its interiors were notable for their resplendence. The interior decoration has partly survived till today. The façade however has changed much since its erection. Only a portico of four granite columns survived from the original façade. After the count&#x27;s death his heirs sold the palace to the Post-Office Department that adapted the building to its needs. In 1924 the building was given into the possession of the Museum of communications. During the siege it suffered badly from artillery bombardments and was closed for repair. The museum partly resumed its display only in 1950. In 1974 owing to a drastic state of the entire structure its major repair was started and the museum has returned to the building only thirty years later, in 2003.

===Bezborodko Dacha in Saint Petersburg===
The dacha is located at Sverdlovskaya Naberezhnaya in Saint Petersburg.

The dacha was built in 1783–1784 to a design by Giacomo Quarenghi. It is a central three-storey building with round turrets in the corners, joined with arched galleries to two symmetrical side wings. In the first half of the 19th century the side wings were linked by a chain railing held in the mouths of twenty-nine cast-iron lions. There used to be a large landscape park with pavilions.

<text>Save the Greenback is an organization of U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing employees and paper and ink suppliers opposed to phasing out the paper dollar. The group formed to counter the influence of the Coin Coalition. Their website was inactive as of July 2012.

Public opinion has tended to favor the dollar bill, although in 2000, the Government Accountability Office reported that a full implementation of the dollar coin could save $500 million a year.

== Americans for George ==
There was an online organization calling itself Americans for George. It was a public-relations campaign appearing to be a grassroots organization (an &quot;Astroturf group&quot;). Their website was also inactive as of July 2012.

==Portrayal in media==
In 2006 and 2007, auto manufacturer Kia Motors used this name in a car discount campaign. In the TV campaigns, the group was portrayed as a group similar to Greenpeace, with a mission to save money.

<text>Marc Ewing is an American computer engineer and entrepreneur. He is the creator and originator of the Red Hat brand of software, most notably the Red Hat range of Linux operating system distributions. He was involved in the 86open project in the mid-1990s.

==Early life==
The son of an IBM programmer, Marc Ewing attended computer camps as a child, and spent time learning to write programs for Apollo and Commodore computers. He graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 1992. While at CMU, he was known to wear a red hat. Because of his computer expertise, people would ask for help from the &quot;man in the red hat&quot;.

==Career==
Following his college education, Ewing began work as engineer at IBM. While at IBM, he spent substantial time customizing Linux workstation installations. From this work, he began the Red Hat Linux Project. Ewing and co-founder Bob Young named their software Red Hat after Ewing&#x27;s red hat.

At the height of the dot com bubble in 1999, Ewing briefly had a net worth of 900 million dollars.

Ewing left Red Hat, and co-founded the mountaineering-focused &quot;Alpinist&quot; quarterly publication in 2002. He later began competing in desert racing, and co-founded the Riot Racing team in 2008.

<text>Roots of Resistance was an anti-racist organization active in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from 1992 to 1996. The organization was formed shortly after a Vancouver demonstration in support of Rodney King during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, fusing an affinity group called Anarchists of Colour with Langara College&#x27;s students of colour collective, the Third World Alliance, and other activists. Roots of Resistance was composed of people of colour only, with members of African, Asian, First Nations and Latin American ancestry, including people of mixed-race.

Members of Roots of Resistance were of various left-wing political tendencies, from anarchism to Marxism, as well as divergent cultural and religious perspectives. Uniting the group was an anti-colonial and anti-capitalist critique, including support of First Nations sovereignty and opposition to global imperialism. Roots of Resistance also criticized parliamentary attempts to restrict immigration, and directly opposed neo-fascist activity, two important issues in early- to mid-1990s Canada.

Roots of Resistance&#x27;s people of colour-only membership was an organizational strategy developed to address racism from a position of strength and affinity, but also to reject what was seen as a white cultural hegemony within the radical left which effectively excluded people of colour and their perspectives. (This critique was aimed at, to name a few examples, the white-led left&#x27;s reduction of all matters of power to &quot;the class struggle&quot;; its &quot;generation gap&quot;-inflected suspicion of elders; its insensitivity to the importance of spirituality for some communities; its emphasis on counterculture over community; etc.)

These various prejudices of the white-dominated left were essentially challenged by the founding of an allied group with an all brown membership. Roots of Resistance frequently worked in coalition with white allies, and was not a separatist organization, nor was it anti-white. Roots of Resistance&#x27;s most newsworthy moments were its Anti-Canada Day demonstrations on 1 July, events designed to expose the colonialist and genocidal history of the Canadian state.

<doc id="1315924" wikidata="Q244581" url="?curid=1315924" title="576i">
<text>576i is a standard-definition digital video mode, originally used for digitizing 625 line analogue television in most countries of the world where the utility frequency for electric power distribution is 50 Hz. Because of its close association with the legacy colour encoding systems, it is often referred to as PAL, PAL/SECAM or SECAM when compared to its 60 Hz (typically, see PAL-M) NTSC-colour-encoded counterpart, 480i.

The &quot;576&quot; identifies a vertical resolution of 576 lines, and the &quot;i&quot; identifies it as an interlaced resolution. The field rate, which is 50 Hz, is sometimes included when identifying the video mode, i.e. 576i50; another notation, endorsed by both the International Telecommunication Union in BT.601 and SMPTE in SMPTE 259M, includes the frame rate, as in 576i/25.

== Operation ==
In analogue television, the full raster uses 625 lines, with 49 lines having no image content to allow time for cathode ray tube circuits to retrace for the next frame (see Vertical blanking interval). These non-displayed lines can be used to transmit teletext or other services. In the digital domain, only the visible 576 lines are considered.

Analogue television signals have no pixels; they are continuous along rastered scan lines, but limited by the available bandwidth. The maximal baseband bandwidth is around 6 MHz which, according to the sampling theorem, translates to about 720 pixels. This value is enough to capture all the original information present. In digital applications, the number of pixels per line is an arbitrary choice. Values above about 500 pixels per line are enough for a perceived quality equivalent to analogue free-to-air television; DVB-T, DVD and DV allow better values such as 704 or 720 (matching the maximum theoretical resolution of the original analogue system).

Colour information is stored using the YCbCr colour space (regardless of the original PAL or SECAM colour system) with 4:2:2 sampling and following Rec. 601 colourimetry.

== Usage ==
Originally used for conversion of analogue sources in TV studios, this resolution was adopted into digital broadcasting or home use.
In digital video applications, such as DVDs and digital broadcasting, colour encoding is no longer significant; in that context, 576i means only

* 576 frame lines
* 25 frames or 50 fields per second
* Interlaced video
* PCM audio (baseband)

The 576i video format can be transported by major digital television formats, ATSC, DVB and ISDB, and on DVD, and it supports aspect ratios of standard 4:3 and anamorphic 16:9.

== Progressive sources ==
When 576i is used to transmit content that was originally composed of 25 full progressive frames per second (576p25 or 576p/25), the odd field of the frame is transmitted first (this is the opposite to 480i). Systems which recover progressive frames or transcode video should ensure that this field order is obeyed, otherwise the recovered frame will consist of a field from one frame and a field from an adjacent frame, resulting in &#x27;comb&#x27; interlacing artifacts. Such progressive content can be marked using encoding flags, for example in DVDs or other MPEG2 based media.

== PAL speed-up ==
Motion pictures shot on film are typically intended to be played back at 24 frames per second. When telecined and played back at the PAL standard 25 frames per second, films run 4.1% faster than the original, and 4.2708% faster than the NTSC film standard 23. frames per second. This increase in speed also increases the pitch of the audio by about 70.672 cents. Digital conversion methods can correct for this increased speed and play the video back at its correct speed and pitch, at the expense of a decreased audio sample rate.

Some movie enthusiasts may prefer PAL over NTSC despite this increased speed, because the latter results in stutter, a visual distortion not present in sped-up PAL video, where different frames last for uneven amounts of time. This is generally not an issue on modern upconverting DVD players and personal computers, as they play back 23. fps video at its native frame rate.

Another method of converting 24 fps footage to 25 fps is the Euro pulldown, where every frame of the original footage is distributed into two fields, except every 12th frame which lasts for three fields. This preserves the pitch and sample rate of the audio, and the higher resolution of PAL video compared to NTSC, at the expense of more stuttery motion.

Yet another method is frame blending, which preserves smooth motion but leaves ghosting artifacts. This method has been criticized by some as looking amateurish.

PAL speed-up does not occur on footage intended for playback at 25 frames per second.

<doc id="1315925" wikidata="Q2293989" url="?curid=1315925" title="576p">
<text>576p is the shorthand name for a video display resolution. The &quot;p&quot; stands for progressive scan, i.e. non-interlaced, the &quot;576&quot; for a vertical resolution of 576 pixels (the frame rate can be given explicitly after the letter). Usually it corresponds to a digital video mode with a 4:3 anamorphic resolution of 720x576 and a frame rate of 25 frames per second (576p25), and thus using the same bandwidth and carrying the same amount of pixel data as 576i, but other resolutions and frame rates are possible. 

ITU-R Recommendation BT.1358 allows the following resolutions, coded as R&#x27;G&#x27;B&#x27; or YCBCR, with timings compatible with BT.656:

* 1024 x 576p (16:9 square pixel format)
* 960 x 576p
* 936 x 576p (based on 960 x 576p, blanking the first and last 12 pixels of each line)
* 768 x 576p (4:3 square pixel format)
* 720 x 576p (4:3 anamorphic)
* 704 x 576p (based on 720 x 576p, blanking the first and last 8 pixels of each line)
* 544 x 576p
* 480 x 576p

576p is considered standard definition for PAL regions. It can be transported by both major digital television formats (ATSC and DVB) and on DVD-Video (if limited to 25 fps). It is defined as a valid &quot;enhanced-definition television&quot; resolution in the SMPTE standard 344M. SMPTE 344M defines a 576p50 standard with twice the data rate of BT.601, using active pixels with horizontal blanking pixels.

== PAL ==
This resolution can be also named as &quot;PAL&quot;, for example in the context home video or gaming consoles, because of its relation with the analog color system using a similar number of scanlines. but 576p can be used to generate both PAL or SECAM interlaced analog signals (where both interlaced fields correspond to a unique frame).

== 576p50 ==
With doubled temporal resolution, 576p50 is considered &quot;enhanced-definition television&quot; (EDTV), regardless of the image being scaled the same way as an interlaced frame. In some countries, such as Australia, the 576p resolution standard is technically considered high-definition and was in use by the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS TV), eventually replaced by 720p for its high-definition subchannel; SBS later changed to using 1080i. The Seven Network initially used 576p for its high-definition subchannel, but now uses 1080i instead.

The frames are doubled (from a 25 frame source) on broadcast (to avoid flicker) for display devices that lack any kind of frame doubling ability. Widescreen 16:9 material has only the width scaled down to fit 720 pixels instead of an unscaled 1024 width.

<text>() are that invite humans toward death in certain aspects of Japanese religion and culture. have been described as monsters, helpers, and creatures of darkness. are used for tales and religions in Japanese culture.

==Japanese religion==
In Buddhism, there is the Mara that is concerned with death, the Mrtyu-mara. It is a demon that makes humans want to die, and it is said that upon being possessed by it, in a shock, one should suddenly want to die by suicide, so it is sometimes explained to be a . Also, in the Yogacarabhumi-sastra, a writing on Yogacara, a demon decided the time of people&#x27;s deaths. Yama, the king of the Underworld, as well as such as the Ox-Head and Horse-Face are also considered a type of .

In Shinto and Japanese mythology, Izanami gave humans death, so she is sometimes seen as a . However, Izanami and Yama are also thought to be different from the death gods in Western mythology. Some forms of Buddhism do not involve believing in any deities, so it is sometimes thought that the concept of a death god does not exist to begin with. Even though the and of Japanese Buddhist faith have taken humans&#x27; lives, there is the opinion that there is no &quot;death god&quot; that merely leads people into the world of the dead. In Postwar Japan, however, the Western notion of a death god entered Japan, and started to become mentioned as an existence with a human nature.
Generally, the word does not appear to be used in Japanese classical literature, and there are not many writings about them; however, going into the Edo period, the word can be seen in Chikamatsu Monzaemon&#x27;s works of and classical literature that had themes on double suicides.

In Hōei 3 (1706), in a performance of , concerning men and women who were invited towards death, it was written &quot;the road the god of death leads towards&quot;, and in Hōei 6 (1709), in , a woman who was about to commit double suicide with a man said, &quot;the fleetingness of a life lured by a god of death&quot;. It never became clear whether the man and woman came to commit double suicide due to the existence of a , or if a was given as an example for their situation of double suicide, and there are also interpretations that the word is an expression for the fleetingness of life.

Other than that, in Kyōhō 5 (1720), in a performance of &quot;The Love Suicides at Amijima&quot;, there was the expression, &quot;of one possessed by a god of death&quot;. Since the character was seller of paper, the character who confronted death wrote as , but there are also interpretations that Chikamatsu himself did not think about the existence of a .

==Classical literature==
In the classical literature of the Edo period, that would possess humans are mentioned. In the from Tenpō 12 (1841), there was a story titled . In this one, however, the was the spirit of a deceased person and had bad intent. Acting jointly with the malicious intent already within people who were living, those people were led on bad paths, which caused repeat incidents to occur at places where there was previously a murder incident (for example by causing the same suicide at places where people have hanged themselves before), and thus these are somewhat like a possession that would cause people to want to die. Similar to this, according to the essay of the Bakumatsu period titled , there were the that made people want to commit suicide through various means, namely hanging, as well as things told through folk religion such as and .

In the later Edo Period, the essay in Kaei 3 (1850) by the essayist Miyoshi Shōzan, the one titled &quot;upon possession by a shinigami, it becomes difficult to speak, or easier to tell lies&quot; was a story where a prostitute possessed by a invites a man to commit double suicide, and in the kabuki by Kawatake Mokuami in Meiji 19 (1886), a enters into people&#x27;s thoughts, making them think about bad things they have done and want to die. These are, rather than gods, more like (meaning ghosts and ), or evil spirits.

In the of classical , there was a programme titled , but this was something that was not thought of independently in Japan, but rather from adaptions of the Italian opera the and the Grimm Fairy Tale &quot;Godfather Death&quot;.

==Folk religion==
 are also spoken about in folk religion after the war. According to the mores of Miyajima, Kumamoto Prefecture, those who go out and return to attend to someone through the night must drink tea or eat a bowl of rice before sleeping, and it is said that a would visit if this was ignored.

In the Hamamatsu area, Shizuoka Prefecture, a would possess people and lead them to mountains, seas, and railroads where people have died. In those places, the dead would have a &quot;death turn&quot; (), and as long as there is nobody to die there next, they shall never ascend even if they were given a service, and it was said that people who were alive would be invited by the dead to come next. Also, it is ordinary to visit graves for the sake of Higan during noon or when the sun sets, but in the Okayama Prefecture, visiting the grave for Higan during sunrise without a previous time would result in being possessed by a . However, once one has visited the grave in sunset, then it would become necessary to visit the grave again during sunrise, to avoid a possessing one&#x27;s body. With this background of folk belief, it is also thought that sometimes people would consider the ghosts of the deceased, who have nobody to deify them, to be seeking companions and inviting people to join them.

<doc id="1315956" wikidata="Q662538" url="?curid=1315956" title="False premise">
<text>A false premise is an incorrect proposition that forms the basis of an argument or syllogism. Since the premise (proposition, or assumption) is not correct, the conclusion drawn may be in error. However, the logical validity of an argument is a function of its internal consistency, not the truth value of its premises.

For example, consider this syllogism, which involves a false premise:

* If the streets are wet, it has rained recently. (premise) 
* The streets are wet. (premise) 
* Therefore it has rained recently. (conclusion)

This argument is logically valid, but quite demonstrably wrong, because its first premise is false — a street cleaner may have passed, the local river could have flooded, etc. A simple logical analysis will not reveal the error in this argument, since that analysis must accept the truth of the argument&#x27;s premises. For this reason, an argument based on false premises can be much more difficult to refute, or even discuss, than one featuring a normal logical error, as the truth of its premises must be established to the satisfaction of all parties.

Another feature of an argument based on false premises that can bedevil critics, is that its conclusion can in fact be true. Consider the above example again. It may well be that it has recently rained and that the streets are wet. This does nothing to prove the first premise, but can make its claims more difficult to refute. This underlies the basic epistemological problem of establishing causal relationships.

Large language models often fail to appropriately answer questions based on false premises, but can be trained to respond correctly.

<doc id="1315959" wikidata="Q3445850" url="?curid=1315959" title="Royal Irish Regiment (1992)">
<text>The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and The Ulster Defence Regiment) (R IRISH) is a light infantry regiment of the British Army. The regiment was founded in 1992 through the amalgamation of the Royal Irish Rangers and the Ulster Defence Regiment. Their oldest predecessor, the 27th Regiment of Foot, was first raised in June 1689 to fight in the Williamite War in Ireland. Other notable regiments in their lineage include the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, Royal Irish Rifles and the Royal Irish Fusiliers (Princess Victoria&#x27;s).

The motto of the regiment is &quot;Faugh A Ballagh&quot; (Modern Irish: &quot;Fág an Bealach&quot;), derived from the Irish Gaelic phrase for &quot;Clear the Way&quot;. This originates from the Peninsular War when Ensign Edward Keogh of the 87th Regiment of Foot let out the cry while capturing a French Imperial Eagle at the Battle of Barrosa. The Regimental Headquarters of the Royal Irish Regiment has been Palace Barracks in County Down, Northern Ireland since moving there in 2008.

==History==
With an antecedence reaching back to 1688, the regiment was formed in 1992. The creation followed the Options for Change proposals which recommended the amalgamation of the Royal Irish Rangers and the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). Most of the membership of the new regiment came from the UDR. This produced an overwhelmingly Ulster Protestant regiment with eleven battalions:

*Regular Army – General Service
**1st Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment
**2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment
*Territorial Army
**4th Battalion, Royal Irish Rangers
**5th Battalion, Royal Irish Rangers
*Regular Army – Northern Ireland Resident Battalions (Home Service)
**3rd (County Down) Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment
**4th (County Fermanagh and County Tyrone) Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment
**5th (County Londonderry) Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment
**6th (County Armagh) Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment (former 2nd/11th Battalion UDR)
**7th (City of Belfast) Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment
**8th (County Tyrone) Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment
**9th (County Antrim) Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment

The Home Service battalions, permanently based in Northern Ireland, filled the role formerly occupied by the UDR, assisting the Royal Ulster Constabulary (with a focus on combating militant Irish republicanism), in Northern Ireland during Operation Banner. The 1st and 2nd Battalions could serve worldwide as general service battalions.

Because of its size, the regiment was removed from the King&#x27;s Division and existed within its own division of infantry. In August 1993, the two regular battalions were amalgamated as the 1st battalion.

In 2000 in Sierra Leone, whilst deployed to train government troops, eleven Royal Irish soldiers and their local army liaison officer were captured by the West Side Boys insurgents. Five hostages were later released and the remaining six were freed by the Special Air Service and The Parachute Regiment during Operation Barras: with the West Side Boys suffering severe casualties in the action.

The Colonel-in-Chief, the Duke of York presented the regiment new colours to St Patrick&#x27;s Church of Ireland Cathedral in Armagh on 16 June 2001: there is a plaque commemorating this event in the south aisle.

The 1st Battalion deployed to Iraq at the beginning of Operation Telic in March 2003, where they carried out operations in the south of the country. Its (now-retired) commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Tim Collins was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for distinguished service.

The number of Home Service battalions were reduced to three by April 2003:

*2nd Battalion – amalgamation of 7th and 9th Battalions
*3rd Battalion – amalgamation of 3rd and 8th Battalions
*4th Battalion – amalgamation of 4th and 5th Battalions

In 2005, the Provisional Irish Republican Army announced an end to its armed campaign. In response the British government announced the end of Operation Banner, and with it the disbandment of the Home Service battalions. A redundancy package was announced in March 2006. The Home Service battalions were awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC) by the Queen in Belfast on 6 October 2006. The home service battalions were declared non-operational in October 2006, and disbanded in July 2007. At the same time, the Royal Irish Rangers, then serving as the TA battalion, was renamed as 2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment.

The 1st Battalion returned from six months in Iraq on Op TELIC VI/VII in May 2006 having served in the Shaibah Logistics Base near Basra. Although the majority of the battalion was deployed around the MND(SE) area a single company was deployed to Baghdad.

Three platoons of the 1st Battalion (Barrosa, Somme and Ranger Platoons) deployed to Afghanistan in 2006, as part of 16 Air Assault Brigade and supported 3rd Parachute Regiment, the latter forming 9 Platoon, C Coy, 3 PARA. They were involved in some of the heaviest fighting during HERRICK IV. Lance Corporal Paul Muirhead, Lance Corporal Luke McCulloch and Fijian Ranger Anare Draiva were killed by the Taliban during HERRICK IV.

In summer 2007 the Regimental Headquarters moved from St Patrick&#x27;s Barracks, Ballymena to Palace Barracks, Belfast.

Both battalions deployed to Afghanistan in 2008, as part of 16 Air Assault Brigade. The 1st battalion provided Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams (OMLTs) to assist in training the Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan National Police (ANP), and the 2nd battalion were the first Territorial Army company strength grouping to provide OMLT training from NATO forces. They were also the first TA Company to fully man Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) within the green zone. One company of the 1st Battalion, attached to 2 PARA, named Ranger Company, undertook offensive operations in the Sangin area of Helmand Province. The 1st Battalion lost Ranger Justin Cupples to an improvised explosive device (IED) during HERRICK VIII.

Both battalions again deployed with 16 Air Assault Brigade to Afghanistan on HERRICK XIII from September 2010. Based in the southern part of Helmand, they lost Lance Corporal Stephen McKee, Ranger Aaron McCormick and Ranger David Dalzell during HERRICK XIII.

Under the Defence in a Competitive Age programme and subsequent Future Soldier, the 1st Battalion will transfer to the 16 Air Assault Brigade.

In memory of a 2006 battle in the Afghan town of Musa Qala, a new Regimental March, composed by Chris Attrill and commissioned by Larne Borough Council, was given to the regiment on Saturday 1 November 2008 in Larne, County Antrim, during an event in which the regiment was also presented with the &#x27;Freedom of the Borough&#x27;. This gives the regiment the right to march through the town with &quot;flags flying, bands playing and bayonets fixed&quot;. The March was named &quot;Musa Qala&quot;.

The uniform combines elements of the uniform of the Royal Irish Rangers with the harp-and-crown cap badge of the Ulster Defence Regiment.

<text>Treta Yuga (IAST: &quot;Tretā-yuga&quot;) (Devanagari: त्रेतायुग), in Hinduism, is the second and second-best of the four &quot;yugas&quot; (world ages) in a &quot;Yuga Cycle&quot;, preceded by &quot;Krita (Satya) Yuga&quot; and followed by &quot;Dvapara Yuga&quot;. &quot;Treta Yuga&quot; lasts for 1,296,000 years (3,600 divine years).

&quot;Treta&quot; means &#x27;a collection of three things&#x27; in Sanskrit, and is so called because during the &quot;Treta Yuga&quot;, there were three Avatars of Vishnu that were seen: the fifth, sixth and seventh incarnations as Vamana, Parashurama and Rama, respectively. The bull of Dharma symbolizes that morality stood on three legs during this period. It had all four legs in the &quot;Satya Yuga&quot; and two in the succeeding &quot;Dvapara Yuga&quot;. Currently, in the immoral age of &quot;Kali&quot;, it stands on one leg.

==Etymology==
&quot;Yuga&quot; (), in this context, means &quot;an age of the world&quot;, where its archaic spelling is &quot;yug&quot;, with other forms of &quot;yugam&quot;, , and &quot;yuge&quot;, derived from &quot;yuj&quot; (), believed derived from &quot;&quot; (Proto-Indo-European: &#x27;to join or unite&#x27;).

&quot;Treta Yuga&quot; () means &quot;the age of three or triads&quot;, where its length is three times that of &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;. During this period, the &quot;Dharma&quot; bull, which symbolizes morality, stands on three legs; (), () and (). 

&quot;Treta Yuga&quot; is described in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, &quot;Manusmriti&quot;, &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot;, &quot;Vishnu Smriti&quot;, and various Puranas.

==Duration and structure==
Hindu texts describe four &quot;yugas&quot; (world ages)⁠ in a &quot;Yuga Cycle&quot;, where, starting in order from the first age of &quot;Krita (Satya) Yuga&quot;, each &quot;yuga&#x27;s&quot; length decreases by one-fourth (25%), giving proportions of 4:3:2:1. Each &quot;yuga&quot; is described as having a main period ( &quot;yuga&quot; proper) preceded by its (dawn) and followed by its (dusk)⁠, where each twilight (dawn/dusk) lasts for one-tenth (10%) of its main period. Lengths are given in divine years (years of the gods), each lasting for 360 solar (human) years.

&quot;Treta Yuga&quot;, the second age in a cycle, lasts for 1,296,000 years (3,600 divine years), where its main period lasts for 1,080,000 years (3,000 divine years) and its two twilights each lasts for 108,000 years (300 divine years). The current cycle&#x27;s &quot;Treta Yuga&quot; has the following dates based on &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, the fourth and present age, starting in 3102BCE:

<text>The Hikayat Banjar () is the chronicle of Banjarmasin, Indonesia. This text, also called the History of Lambung Mangkurat, contains the history of the kings of Banjar and of Kotawaringin in southeast and south Borneo respectively.

The final part of the text dates from 1663 or slightly later; the first part is older. The text is 4787 lines long (120 pages quarto). A careful text edition alongside a detailed description of the literary and cultural-historical context was published by the Dutch philologist Hans Ras in 1968.

== Structure ==
Structurally the Hikayat Banjar can be divided in nine sections. The first story details the origin of the Hindu kingdom in southeast Borneo. The function of this story is clearly to give a model for the political organisation or the realm and to set the standards for court ceremony and etiquette. Then there follow eight sections giving in succession the story of:

* the first king and queen of the dynasty, followed by a piece of genealogy (kraton I)
* the first king of Negara Daha, followed by a piece of genealogy (kraton II)
* the first king of Banjarmasin, followed by a piece of genealogy (kraton III)
* the first king of Martapura, followed by a piece of genealogy (kraton IV)

== Different versions ==
The text of the Hikayat Banjar was written and rewritten several times. Of several that have been preserved; the &quot;Recension II&quot; version derives from an older version derived from oral tradition, whereas another variant at the Leiden University Library MS. Or. 1701, presents a more modern version.

<text>Theodore Roosevelt &quot;Hound Dog&quot; Taylor (April 12, 1915 – December 17, 1975) was an American Chicago blues guitarist and singer.

==Life and career==
Taylor was born in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1915, though some sources say 1917. He first played the piano and began playing the guitar when he was 20. He moved to Chicago in 1942.

Taylor had a condition known as polydactylism, which resulted in him having six fingers on both hands. As is usual with the condition, the extra digits were rudimentary nubbins and could not be moved. One night, while drunk, he cut off the extra digit on his right hand using a straight razor.

He became a full-time musician around 1957, but remained unknown outside the Chicago area, where he played small clubs in black neighborhoods and at the open-air Maxwell Street Market. He was known for his electrified slide guitar playing (roughly styled after that of Elmore James), his cheap Japanese Teisco guitars, and his raucous boogie beats. In 1967, Taylor toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival, performing with Little Walter and Koko Taylor.

Bruce Iglauer (then a shipping clerk for Delmark Records) tried to persuade his employer to sign Taylor to a recording contract after he heard Taylor with his band, the HouseRockers (Brewer Phillips on second guitar and Ted Harvey on drums), in 1970 at Florence&#x27;s Lounge on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. In 1971, having no success in getting Delmark to sign Taylor, Iglauer used a $2,500 inheritance to form Alligator Records, which recorded Taylor&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Hound Dog Taylor and the HouseRockers&quot;. The album was recorded in just two nights. It was the first release for Alligator, which eventually became a major blues label. Iglauer began managing and booking the band, which toured nationwide and performed with Muddy Waters, Freddie King, and Big Mama Thornton. The band became especially popular in the Boston area, where Taylor inspired the young George Thorogood. The album &quot;Live at Joe&#x27;s Place&quot; documents a performance in Boston in 1972.
The second release by Taylor and his band, &quot;Natural Boogie&quot;, recorded in late 1973, received greater acclaim and led to more touring. In 1975, they toured Australia and New Zealand with Freddie King and the duo of Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. Taylor&#x27;s third album for Alligator, &quot;Beware of the Dog&quot;, was recorded live in 1974 but was not released until after his death. Alligator also released, posthumously, &quot;Genuine Houserocking Music&quot; and &quot;Release the Hound&quot;. Bootleg live recordings also circulated after Taylor&#x27;s death.

Taylor died of lung cancer in 1975.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1984, Taylor was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. His induction statement included: &quot;He was not a virtuoso, nor a master technician. But the few things he could play, he could play like no one else could. He told writer Bob Neff the way he would like to be remembered: &#x27;He couldn’t play shit, but he sure made it sound good.&#x27;&quot;

In 1997, Alligator Records released &quot;Hound Dog Taylor: A Tribute&quot;, a 14-track tribute album in which Taylor&#x27;s songs are covered by Luther Allison, Elvin Bishop, Cub Koda (with Taylor&#x27;s band, the HouseRockers), Gov&#x27;t Mule, Sonny Landreth, and others. A &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; series compilation album followed in 1999.

A live recording by George Thorogood of Elmore James&#x27; &quot;The Sky Is Crying&quot; is dedicated to &quot;the memory of the late great Hound Dog Taylor&quot;. It is included on his album &quot;Live&quot; (1986); Thorogood also recorded Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Make It&quot; for his album &quot;More George Thorogood and the Destroyers&quot; (1980), &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot; for his album &quot;Ride &#x27;Til I Die&quot; (2003), and &quot;Give Me Back My Wig&quot; for his album &quot;The Hard Stuff&quot; (2006).

<text>Yvonne Trevino (born 18 January 1967) is a kickboxing and boxing champion from Peoria, Arizona, United States. She was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 2023.

== Career ==

On April 20, 1995, at the Aladdin Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada Trevino was invited for an opportunity to fight in the first all-women&#x27;s card for the new WIBF Women&#x27;s International Boxing Federation in her third boxing bout. Trevino caused what perhaps could be described as women&#x27;s boxing&#x27;s first major upset, technically knocking out the popular and well-known German fighter Regina Halmich ringside doctors stopped the fight after Regina suffered a major cut under her eye from a four-round, knockdown action. Trevino had suffered a broken left hand in the first round worried the fight would be stopped she continued on and became the new WIBF world Flyweight champion.

On April 16, 1997, after being inactive for about a year, Trevino accepted a nationally televised bout on ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports matched against Brenda Rouse, a fighter from the stable of well known professional boxer Tommy Morrison; the bout was stopped in the first round, after Rouse against the ropes failed to respond to a flurry of punches.

<text>Hazara Division is an administrative division of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. It is located along the Indus River and comprises eight districts: Abbottabad, Mansehra, Haripur, Battagram, Upper Kohistan, Kolai-Palas, Lower Kohistan, Torghar and most recently created Allai District.

== Location ==
Hazara Division is bordered by Malakand and Mardan Divisions to the west, Rawalpindi Division (Punjab) and Islamabad Capital Territory to the south, Azad Kashmir to the east, and Gilgit-Baltistan to the north.

== History ==
On the dissolution of West Pakistan in 1970, Hazara District and the two tribal agencies were merged to form the new Hazara Division with its capital at Abbottabad. The division was initially composed of two districts (Abbottabad, and Mansehra) but within a few years, Haripur district was spun off from Abbottabad District and Batagram District was spun off from Mansehra District.

Hazara remained a district until its conversion into a division in 1976. In October 1976, Mansehra was given the status of a full-fledged district, which consisted of Mansehra and Batagram tehsils. Subsequently, in July 1991, Haripur Tehsil was separated from Abbottabad and made into a district. Thus only the old Tehsil of Abbottabad remained, which was declared as Abbottabad District.

In 2000, administrative divisions were abolished and the fourth-tier districts were raised to become the new third tier of government in Pakistan. At abolition it contained the 8 districts:

Eventually, with all the administrative divisions being restored back in 2008, Hazara Division has returned.

== Demographics ==

According to the 2023 census, Hazara Division division had a population of 6,188,736.

== List of the Districts ==

<doc id="1315996" wikidata="Q1545458" url="?curid=1315996" title="Syndicate (1993 video game)">
<text>Syndicate is an isometric real-time tactical and strategic game from Bullfrog Productions created in 1993, and released for a variety of platforms beginning with the PC and Commodore Amiga. It is the first title in the &quot;Syndicate&quot; series. Set in a dystopian future in which corporations have replaced governments, &quot;Syndicate&quot; puts the player in control of a corporation vying for global dominance.

The game consists of a series of missions in which the player controls a team of cybernetically modified agents attempting to take control of a particular country. The agents must frequently overcome local police forces and heavily armed agents from rival syndicates to achieve mission objectives, which range from assassinations to capture or rescue of personnel. Agent armaments, cybernetic modifications and behavioral attributes can be controlled by the player to make them more suited for particular tasks.

The player corporation makes money through taxes gathered from occupied territories, which can be used to research and purchase more potent weaponry and cybernetic modifications. The player controls the level of taxation, with excessive taxation bringing the risk of revolt, requiring a further mission to re-capture the territory.

The game was critically acclaimed upon release, with particular praise for the realistic presentation, writing and violence of the gameplay. It cemented Bullfrog&#x27;s reputation following its early successes with the Populous series and Powermonger, and has appeared on several lists of the greatest video games of all time.

An expansion pack, &quot;&quot;, a sequel, &quot;Syndicate Wars&quot;, and a reboot &quot;Syndicate&quot; have also been released. The original game and expansion pack were re-released together in 1996 as Syndicate Plus.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay of &quot;Syndicate&quot; involves ordering a one to four-person team of cyborg agents around cities displayed in a fixed-view isometric style, in pursuit of mission goals such as assassinating executives of a rival syndicate, rescuing captured allies, &quot;persuading&quot; civilians and scientists to join the player&#x27;s company or killing all enemy agents.

As the player progresses through the game, they must manage the research and development of new weaponry and cyborg upgrades. The player has limited funds, requiring taxation of the conquered territories. Over-taxed territories may revolt, resulting in the loss of that territory and requiring the replay of that mission. The player begins the game with pistols, progressing through increasingly destructive weaponry that includes Uzis, miniguns, flamethrowers, sniper rifles, time bombs, lasers and the destructive Gauss gun. In addition, the player can use items such as medikits to heal their agents, scanners to locate pedestrians/vehicles and the &quot;Persuadertron&quot; to brainwash the player&#x27;s targets into blind obedience. 

==Plot==
The backstory of &quot;Syndicate&quot; is contained in the manual, instead of the game itself. As multinational corporations gained power and influence they came to exercise direct influence over the world&#x27;s governments, eventually replacing them, controlling the lives of people through commerce. One such &quot;megacorp&quot;, named EuroCorp, invented the &quot;CHIP&quot;, a device inserted into the neck which alters a person&#x27;s perception of the outside world, numbing their senses to the misery and squalor around them. It also opened the user to suggestion and manipulation by the megacorps. Before long the megacorps became corrupt crime Syndicates, fighting amongst each other for monopoly over CHIP manufacturing and control over populations.

The game puts the player in charge of a self-named corporation in a near-future cyberpunk-style world in the year 2096. The teams of up to four cyborg agents - who according to the game&#x27;s intro cutscene, are ordinary civilians who have been captured, cybernetically enhanced and reprogrammed. The agents are used in a series of missions, which include assassinations, infiltration, theft and &quot;persuasion&quot; (using a device called a Persuadertron to capture individuals of importance, or hordes of civilians, police and others to act as cannon fodder). New agents can also be Persuaded and added to the player&#x27;s roster, to replace those who have been injured or killed. Losing all agents results in a Game Over screen, as the player&#x27;s corporation sets the player&#x27;s control airship to self destruct and crash.

During the course of the game, the player establishes worldwide dominance with their established syndicate, one territory at a time, while engaging and eliminating rival syndicates (such as The Tao, Sphinx Inc., and The Castrilos) and putting down internal mutinies. The finale sees the squad eliminating wave upon wave of enemy agents on the Atlantic Accelerator research station: victory declares the dawn of a new Empire across the Earth.

==Release==
The game was first released in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1993 for the Amiga and PC DOS computers and was subsequently ported across to a wide variety of other formats. The DOS version used the standard 320x200 256-color resolution (Mode 13h) just for the planning and main menus, with the tactical simulation part rendered at 640x480 with only 16 colors. The higher resolution permitted finer detail in the graphics and allowed for the illusion that more than 16 colors were used by means of dithering. Similar graphics and same levels design were used in the Macintosh, 3DO, Atari Jaguar and RiscPC ports.

A separate version was made for the simpler, 16-bit consoles, as the hardware could not support the complexity of the original game. It contained new level design and different graphics, and was released for Sega Mega Drive and SNES. Later, it was released on the PlayStation Portable as part of &quot;EA Replay&quot;, a compilation of retro games released in the United States on November 7, 2006; this version is the SNES version and is executed on PSP by an emulator.

In January 2012, the DOS version of &quot;Syndicate&quot; was re-released, packaged with pre-configured versions of the DOSBox emulator for modern versions of Windows. In October 2012, the DOSBox version was made available for Mac OS X. In 2015, &quot;Syndicate&quot; was available for free on Electronic Arts&#x27; Origin platform.

An expansion pack named, &quot;&quot;, was subsequently released in 1993.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; criticized the lack of multiplayer, random research, poor AI, and repetitive missions. The magazine concluded that &quot;&quot;Syndicate&quot; is a polished and significant effort&quot; that would appeal to fans of other Bullfrog games but &quot;doesn&#x27;t quite offer the staying power of its predecessors&quot;. &quot;COMPUTE!&quot; noted, &quot;This isn&#x27;t a game to use as a morality lesson for the kids – it&#x27;s bloody, it requires you to be ruthless, and some people may take issue with the use of drugs to control your agents. But it&#x27;s a ball to play.&quot;

Jim Trunzo reviewed &quot;Syndicate&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #38 (1993), giving it a final evaluation of &quot;Very Good&quot; and stated that &quot;Think &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Think &quot;Robocop&quot;. Think cyberpunk to the max! You haven&#x27;t seen anything like &quot;Syndicate&quot; from Electronic Arts. This game is for neither for the timid nor the overly moral.&quot;

&quot;GamePro&quot; described the Genesis version as a &quot;clumsy translation&quot;, remarking that targeting and maneuvering are much more difficult with gamepad button combinations, and that the graphics aren&#x27;t clear enough for the player to make out essential details. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Genesis version of the game, and stated that &quot;Often the intense strategy games of the PC domain never make much of a 16bit game and &quot;Syndicate&quot; is a prime example.&quot;

The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; concurred that the Jaguar version was the best home console version of the game to date, but still clearly inferior to the PC version. They especially criticized the use of the Jaguar controller&#x27;s number pad, saying it made the controls needlessly complicated. &quot;GamePro&quot; instead actually praised the use of the Jaguar controller&#x27;s many buttons, but also remarked that the Jaguar version suffers from a hard-to-read display and sharp, erratic slowdown. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; disagreed with both of them, saying that the Jaguar version is &quot;as close to the original title as is possible without the use of a mouse.&quot; They applauded the game in general for its detailed gore and &quot;oppressive atmosphere.&quot;

&quot;Next Generation&quot; also published a positive review for the 3DO version, with the reviewer commenting, &quot;There&#x27;s been a version of this for nearly every system, and it has to be said this one takes a close second behind that found on PC. ... easily the best looking and smoothest controlling version for any home system.&quot; Despite this, he gave it a lower score than the Jaguar version. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the 3DO version of the game again, and stated that &quot;Of all the versions we&#x27;ve looked at, this is a close second behind the PC, noticeably better than the Jaguar, and miles ahead of the Genesis and Sega CD versions. Otherwise, it&#x27;s exactly the same.&quot;

&quot;GamePro&quot; gave the SNES version an overall positive review based on the depth of the gameplay, calling it &quot;a thinking man&#x27;s shoot-em-up game.&quot;

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Macintosh version of the game, and stated that &quot;players who enjoy being the Greedy, Amoral, Corporate Bastard are in for a satisfying depraved chunk of murder.&quot; Power Unlimited gave the PC version a score of 90% summarizing: &quot;Syndicate is a strategic action game with fantastic graphics. Like most Bullfrog games, it is slightly different from the rest. The attention to detail is especially commendable.&quot;

===Accolades ===

In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; ranked it as the 67th best PC game of all time, stating that &quot;it was just fun to mow down civilians in this strategic action game of futuristic gang warfare.&quot; That same year, &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 29th top game of all time for being &quot;fast, furious and tons of fun&quot; in spite of its complexity. Also in 1996, &quot;Syndicate&quot; was ranked as the seventh best Amiga game by &quot;Amiga Power&quot;. In 2010, UGO.com included the game on its list of 42 best games ever made. It was also included in the 2011 list of the best violent video games of all time by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; for the reason that &quot;few games have ever been so keen to have their protagonists murder civilians, burning them with flamethrowers, blowing them up with rocket launchers and simply mowing them down.&quot; That same year, Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the third best Amiga game. In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Syndicate&quot; as the 16th best computer game ever. The editors hailed it as &quot;slick, addictive, and one-of-a-kind gaming.&quot;&quot; That same year, &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; named it the 11th best computer game of all time. The editors wrote, &quot;Very few titles provide an atmosphere as dark and seductive as the one in &quot;Syndicate&quot;, and it strikes just the right balance between strategy and arcade blasting.&quot; In 1995, Total! ranked the game 37th on their Top 100 SNES Games writing: &quot;Bullfrog deliver heaps of moody atmosphere in this bleak futuristic shooter. It’s gripping and a little dangerous.&quot; In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the 3DO version 8th in its &quot;The GamesMaster 3DO Top 10.&quot; In the same magazine, they also ranked the game 22nd in their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Syndicate Wars&quot; is a 1996 direct sequel to &quot;Syndicate&quot;, featuring 3D graphics and released for the PC and PlayStation. Several attempts by Bullfrog to produce another &quot;Syndicate&quot; game were all ultimately abandoned. These canceled games included at least one for the PC and another for the PlayStation 2. The game was re-imagined by Starbreeze Studios as &quot;Syndicate&quot;, a first-person shooter released for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2012. A spiritual successor, &quot;Satellite Reign&quot;, was developed by some of the original staff.

<doc id="1315998" wikidata="Q5606248" url="?curid=1315998" title="Greg Sheridan">
<text>Gregory Paul Sheridan (born 1956) is an Australian foreign affairs journalist, author and commentator. He has written a number of books on politics, religion and international affairs and has been the foreign editor of &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper since 1992. He is a regular commentator on Australian television and radio, including for the ABC and Sky News Australia. The ABC describes Sheridan as &quot;one of Australia&#x27;s most respected and influential analysts of domestic and international politics.&quot;

==Early life and education==

Sheridan was born in Sydney in 1956 and grew up in a lower middle class Irish-Catholic family. They lived in a two bedroom flat in the western Sydney suburb of Lewisham, where he attended Christian Brothers&#x27; High School. The family later moved to Forestville on Sydney&#x27;s North Shore. At 15, Greg convinced his parents to allow him to go to the Redemptorist seminary at Galong in southern New South Wales to train as a priest; however, he only lasted a year at the institution and completed his high schooling at the Christian Brothers school St Pius X College at Chatswood in Sydney. According to friend and academic Karl Schmude, Sheridan&#x27;s early family life and university experiences gave him a grounding in politics, which steered him towards journalism.

In a review of Sheridan&#x27;s 2015 book &quot;God Is Good for You&quot;, author Gerard Henderson wrote that &quot;Bob (BAS) Santamaria was one of young Greg&#x27;s early heroes. Along with United States president J F Kennedy. In 1963, he became interested in politics. Every Sunday, the family tuned into BAS&#x27;s &quot;Point of View&quot; commentary program on Channel 9. And 1963 was the year of the Kennedy assassination. Half a century later, Sheridan&#x27;s politics have not changed much. Like Kennedy and Santamaria, he is an anti-communist and a social democrat. Sheridan is also a social conservative and was slow to embrace free market economics.&quot;

He sporadically attended Macquarie University and the University of Sydney over several years, but never graduated, finding it difficult to deal with lecturers with whom he disagreed. While pursuing his university education, he became involved in student politics. During this time, he befriended the future Liberal prime minister Tony Abbott. Sheridan and Abbott involved themselves in the opposition to the left-wing university politics of the 1970s, usually through involvement in the campus Democratic Club, which received support from Santamaria&#x27;s National Civic Council. Sheridan also served for a time as senior vice-president of the Sydney University Liberal Club, supporting Abbott standing for the students&#x27; representative council.

Sheridan&#x27;s 2015 book &quot;When We Were Young &amp; Foolish&quot; covers his university politics years. According to the book, his journalistic career began after he attended the Australian Union of Students (AUS) annual conference in Melbourne in 1977 with Tony Abbott. Of the experience, he wrote: &quot;Everything about the conference, and about AUS and student politics in those days, was undemocratic and full of intimidation ... All the violence in student politics, all of it, came from the left.&quot; He recounted leftist and anarchist attacks on Michael Danby and Peter Costello and Tony Abbott, and wrote that, after Abbott and the female member of their group were assaulted by leftists during the AUS conference, Sheridan and Abbott sought counsel from the influential lay Catholic Bob Santamaria for the first time. After the conference, Sheridan wrote an article about the violence which was published in &quot;The Bulletin&quot;: &quot;Whatever merit or otherwise my journalistic career may have had over the next 40 years, perhaps I owe it all to AUS&quot;, he wrote in &quot;When We Were Young &amp; Foolish&quot;. Sheridan later wrote some articles on the sciences academic conflict at Macquarie University.

After leaving university, Sheridan became an industrial organiser for a trade union and joined the Australian Labor Party.

==Career==
Sheridan was drawn to being a writer during his Sydney University years, at which time he had several articles published in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; magazine and elsewhere. He later said that he was drawn to journalism by &quot;a love of words and language, a love of controversy and intellectual debate, a desire to &#x27;use my gunpowder&#x27; and make a difference.&quot;

His career in journalism began at &quot;The Bulletin&quot; in the late 1970s. Covering the story of Vietnamese refugees after the Vietnam War sparked an interest in Asian and regional politics. Sheridan later wrote of his time at &quot;The Bulletin&quot;: &quot;It was astonishing good fortune for me to know all these people at &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. Trevor Kennedy, Bob Carr, Alan Reid, Sam Lipski, Malcolm Turnbull and the rest. It was a scintillating magazine under Trevor Kennedy&#x27;s editorship.&quot;

Sheridan joined the staff of &quot;The Australian&quot; and in 1985 became that newspaper&#x27;s first China correspondent. He later worked in Washington and Canberra before returning to Sydney as the newspaper&#x27;s foreign editor in 1992. He specialises in Asian and U.S. politics for &quot;The Australian&quot; and has interviewed presidents and prime ministers around the world.

He is a distinguished fellow of the Australia India Institute at the University of Melbourne. He has written four books on Asian politics, a book on Australia–U.S. relationships, as well as books on religion.

Since 2017, Sheridan has published books and articles on Christianity, beginning with an article in &quot;The Australian&quot; entitled &quot;Is God dead?&quot;, subtitled &quot;The West has much to lose by banishing Christianity&quot;. Sheridan told the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; that the article &quot;got the biggest readership of any article in the history of the paper since they&#x27;ve been able to measure these things&quot;. The following year, he published the book &quot;God Is Good for You: A Defence of Christianity in Troubled Times&quot;, which argued that &quot;God is true&quot;, and discusses the faith of high profile Australian politicians including Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott, John Howard, Kevin Rudd, Kim Beazley, Peter Costello, Kristina Keneally, Penny Wong, and Bill Shorten. The book became a bestseller.

==Personal life==

Sheridan is a Catholic, and has written two books on Christianity. According to Karl Schmude writing for &quot;Quadrant&quot;, &quot;Sheridan is more than a cultural Catholic. He actually believes; and he is deeply conscious of the springs of conviction that lie beneath a higher faith.&quot; He is married to Jasbir Kaur &quot;Jessie&quot; Sheridan, who practises the Sikh religion along with their three sons. He moved to Melbourne in 2006.

==Honours, reviews and recognition==

Sheridan was given an Officer of the Order of Australia Honour in 2016, with the citation, &quot;For distinguished service to print media as a journalist and political commentator on foreign affairs and national security, and to Australia&#x27;s bilateral relationships&quot;.

His profile on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Q+A program describes him as &quot;one of Australia&#x27;s most respected and influential analysts of domestic and international politics. He has written several books on Asia and Australia&#x27;s role in the region. He is also a keen observer of US international affairs and is on close terms with senior figures in Washington, London and other major foreign capitals.&quot;

Britain&#x27;s &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; has described Sheridan as &quot;a subtle thinker, a keen observer of the cultural climate and an engaging writer.

==Commentary==
Sheridan has written extensively on Australian, Asian and international politics, and is a regular commentator on Australian TV and radio.

===Whitlam Government===

Sheridan has written that the Whitlam Labor Government (1972-1975) was &quot;overall perhaps the worst government in Australian history&quot;, with government expenditure running &quot;wildly out of control&quot;.

===Fraser Government===
Sheridan&#x27;s career in journalism began during the Fraser government years. Sheridan was later critical of what he alleged was Malcolm Fraser&#x27;s political transformation to the left after leaving office, his embrace of anti-Americanism and what Sheridan describes as the &quot;myth-making of the legions of new admirers Fraser gained when he abruptly shifted from being a rightwinger to being a leftwinger.&quot; When Fraser died in 2015, Sheridan offered this general assessment:

===Hawke Government===
Following the death of Fraser&#x27;s successor Bob Hawke in 2019, Sheridan wrote that &quot;In foreign affairs and national security, Bob Hawke was a magnificently successful prime minister. He wasn&#x27;t perfect. He made mistakes. But the ledger is vastly in the black, hugely positive ... As a social democrat, [Hawke] hated dictatorship and knew that in the Cold War he was on the side of the US-led alliance of which Australia was an integral part.&quot;

===Other issues===
Sheridan has been a supporter of closer ties between Australia and its Southeast Asian neighbours, particularly Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia.

In his 1998 book &quot;Hidden Agendas&quot;, John Pilger criticised Sheridan for being a &quot;reliable ally&quot; of Indonesia&#x27;s Suharto dictatorship while serving as the foreign editor of &quot;The Australian&quot;. In particular, Pilger derided Sheridan&#x27;s defence of Indonesia after the critique of Suharto&#x27;s human rights records by the Clinton administration and the Australian Parliament&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Committee, following the Santa Cruz Massacre in East Timor. Sheridan said that &quot;even genuine victims frequently concoct stories.&quot;

In 2006, Sheridan called for the removal by Australia of Mari Alkatiri as Prime Minister of East Timor.

Sheridan supported the Australian government&#x27;s Anti-Terrorism Act 2005. He also argued in 2006 that George W. Bush will be judged &quot;one of the great presidents of the United States&quot;.

Prior to the 2016 US Presidential election, Sheridan consistently predicted that HilLary Clinton would beat Trump.

In June 2020 during the Black Lives Matter protests, Sheridan commented on Sky News Australia that there was no systemic racism in US. &quot;Most African Americans are middle class, and they don&#x27;t suffer daily, shocking racism&quot;, Sheridan said. &quot;I myself have lived in the United States on four separate occasions. And I never saw any racial confrontation. I never heard anyone make a racist remark.&quot;

Sheridan has criticised the ABC. In one column he wrote &quot;the ABC has become a relentless behemoth of unaccountable and vindictive power that persecutes designated enemies in a grievously unfair and unprofessional way&quot; which practices &quot;an irresponsible, vicious, bullying misuse of state power.&quot;

===ABC bias===

Sheridan is a regular panellist on ABC television and radio, however he has at times criticised the national broadcaster for bias. Sheridan was highly critical of the ABC&#x27;s antagonistic reporting of the case against Catholic Cardinal George Pell, who was acquitted by the full bench of the High Court of Australia in April 2020. Sheridan wrote for &quot;The Australian&quot;: &quot;the ABC has become a relentless behemoth of unaccountable and vindictive power that persecutes designated enemies in a grievously unfair and unprofessional way. Its campaigns against its enemies have a whiff of the Red Guards in China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution.&quot; Sheridan also criticised Victorian Labor Premier Dan Andrews for refusing to accept the High Court verdict, writing that he saw the Premier&#x27;s comments as the &quot;most irresponsible remarks made by a modern premier. In more than 40 years of journalism, I can recall no premier making remarks that could be interpreted as challenging the High Court in a criminal matter&quot;. Sheridan called columnist Andrew Bolt &quot;the bravest man in Australia&quot; for speaking out against the wrongful conviction of the Cardinal for sex abuse.
===Criticisms===
Reviewing Sheridan&#x27;s book &quot;Christians: the urgent case for Jesus in our world&quot;, Guy Rundle wrote, &quot;if Sheridan’s faith was of a real depth and ground, he wouldn’t have needed the black mass he helped plunge the Middle East into by his relentless cheerleading.&quot;

In 2019 Sheridan visited Poland and Hungary, paid for by the Polish government and a conservative think-tank, the Mathias Corvinus Collegium. He wrote articles praising the Polish and Hungarian governments. It has been argued Sheridan has been defending fascist governments.

<text>Delta Phi Beta (), is an American co-ed South Asian fraternity. It was established at the University of California, Berkeley in 1992. 

== History ==
Delta Phi Beta was established on June 15, 1992, at the University of California, Berkeley by South Asian and Asian American students. The fraternity was established as &quot;a reaction against the growing schism forming within the South Asian Community&quot; with hopes that &quot;South Asian people, regardless of religion or country, could communicate their different beliefs&quot;. It was the first South Asian (Indian) fraternity in the United States. 

== Symbols ==
Delta Phi Beta&#x27;s colors are blue and silver. Its symbol is the elephant. Its pillars are community involvement, cultural awareness, academic excellence, and social enhancement. 

== Activities ==
The fraternity hosts a variety of social events. The University of California, Los Angeles chapter co-sponsored a cultural conference on campus in 2005. It also held a Festival of India in 2006 that featured the Indian-American performers, including comedian Rasika Mathur and rapper Karmacy. 

== Philanthropy ==
The fraternity&#x27;s members participate in various service activities, including the Aga Khan Partnership Walk, Buddylimpics, Habitat for Humanity, and beach cleanups at Playa Del Rey. It members have also raised funds for the Ronald McDonald House Charities and LA Works. On ongoing philanthropy is funding the establishment two schools in impoverished rural area&#x27;s of India. Members also raised thousands of dollars for earthquake relief in India.

The &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; started its annual charity formal, Sahayaki, in 2001. In 2001, the proceeds from Sahayaki went to the India Development and Relief Fund. In 2003, proceeds supported ASHA-LA.

== Membership ==
Delta Phi Beta is co-ed.

<text>Gulu is a district in the Northern Region of Uganda. The regional headquarters are located in the city of Gulu, which is also the administrative capital of Northern Uganda. the district consists of two main divisions, Gulu West and Gulu East. 

==Location==
Gulu District is bordered by Lamwo District to the north, Pader District and Omoro District to the east, Oyam District to the south, Nwoya District to the southwest, and Amuru District to the west. The district headquarters in the city of Gulu are , by road, north of Uganda&#x27;s capital city, Kampala. The coordinates of the district are, near the city of Gulu are:02°49&#x27;50.0&quot;N, 32°19&#x27;13.0&quot;E (Latitude:2.830556; Longitude:32.320278).

==Overview==
As of November 2019, the district was one of the eight districts that constituted the Acholi sub-region, the historical homeland of the Acholi ethnic group. The district is composed of Aswa County and the Gulu Municipal Council. The economic activity of 90 per cent of the population in the district is subsistence agriculture.

The district has been the location of much of the fighting between the Ugandan army and the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army. Over 90 percent of the population has returned to their villages after more than two decades of living in what were known as &quot;Internally Displaced People Camps&quot;.

==Population==
The national census conducted in 2002 put the population at 193,337. In the 2014 national census and household survey, the population of Gulu District was enumerated at 275,613.

<doc id="1316017" wikidata="Q210523" url="?curid=1316017" title="Word stem">
<text>In linguistics, a word stem is a part of a word responsible for its lexical meaning. Typically, a stem remains unmodified during inflection with few exceptions due to apophony (for example in Polish, (&quot;city&quot;) and (&quot;in the city&quot;); in English, &quot;sing&quot;, &quot;sang&quot;, and &quot;sung&quot;, where it can be modified according to morphological rules or peculiarities, such as sandhi).

Uncovering and analyzing cognation between word stems and roots within and across languages has allowed comparative philology and comparative linguistics to determine the history of languages and language families. The term is used with slightly different meanings depending on the morphology of the language in question. For instance, in Athabaskan linguistics, a verb stem is a root that cannot appear on its own and that carries the tone of the word.

==Root vs stem==
By attaching the morpheme &quot;-ship&quot; to the root word &quot;friend&quot; (which some linguists call a stem, too), the new word &quot;friendship&quot; was synthesized. While an &quot;s&quot; can be attached to &quot;friendship&quot; to form &quot;friendships&quot;, it can not be attached to the root within it to form &quot;friendsship&quot;. A stem is a base from which all its inflected variants are formed. For example, the &quot;stabil-&quot; (a variant of &quot;stable&quot; unable to stand alone) is the root of the &quot;destabilized&quot;, while the stem consists of &quot;de·stabil·ize&quot;, including &quot;de-&quot; and &quot;-ize&quot;. The &quot;-(e)d&quot;, on the other hand, is not part of the stem.

Stem may either consist of a root (e.g. &quot;run&quot;) alone or a compound word, such as &quot;meatball&quot; and &quot;bottleneck&quot; (examples of compound nouns) or &quot;blacken&quot; and &quot;standardize&quot; (examples of compound verbs). The stem of the verb &quot;to wait&quot; is &quot;wait&quot;: it is the part that is common to all its inflected variants.
#&quot;wait&quot; (infinitive, imperative, present subjunctive, and present indicative except in the 3rd-person singular)
#&quot;wait&quot;s (3rd person singular simple present indicative)
#&quot;wait&quot;ed (simple past)
#&quot;wait&quot;ed (past participle)
#&quot;wait&quot;ing (present participle)

== Citation forms and bound morphemes ==
In languages with very little inflection, such as English and Chinese, the stem is usually not distinct from the &quot;normal&quot; form of the word (the lemma, citation, or dictionary form). However, in other languages, word stems may rarely or never occur on their own. For example, the English verb stem &quot;run&quot; is indistinguishable from its present tense form (except in the third person singular). However, the equivalent Spanish verb stem &quot;corr-&quot; never appears as such because it is cited with the infinitive inflection (&quot;correr&quot;) and always appears in actual speech as a non-finite (infinitive or participle) or conjugated form. Such morphemes that cannot occur on their own in this way are usually referred to as &quot;bound morphemes&quot;.

In computational linguistics, the term &quot;stem&quot; is used for the part of the word that never changes, even morphologically, when inflected, and a lemma is the base form of the word. For example, given the word &quot;produced&quot;, its lemma (linguistics) is &quot;produce&quot;, but the stem is &quot;produc-&quot; because of the inflected form &quot;producing&quot;.

== Paradigms and suppletion ==
A list of all the inflected forms of a word stem is called its inflectional paradigm. The paradigm of the adjective &quot;tall&quot; is given below, and the stem of this adjective is &quot;tall&quot;.
*tall (positive); taller (comparative); tallest (superlative)
Some paradigms do not make use of the same stem throughout; this phenomenon is called suppletion. An example of a suppletive paradigm is the paradigm for the adjective &quot;good&quot;: its stem changes from &quot;good&quot; to the bound morpheme &quot;bet-&quot;.
*good (positive); better (comparative); best (superlative)

== Oblique stem ==
Both in Latin and Greek, the declension (inflection) of some nouns uses a different stem in the oblique cases than in the nominative and vocative singular cases. Such words belong to, respectively, the so-called third declension of the Latin grammar and the so-called third declension of the Ancient Greek grammar. For example, the genitive singular is formed by adding &quot;-is&quot; (Latin) or -ος (Greek) to the oblique stem, and the genitive singular is conventionally listed in Greek and Latin dictionaries to illustrate the oblique.

===Examples===


English words derived from Latin or Greek often involve the oblique stem: &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

Historically, the difference in stems arose due to sound changes in the nominative. In the Latin third declension, for example, the nominative singular suffix &quot;-s&quot; is combined with a stem-final consonant. If that consonant was &quot;c&quot;, the result was &quot;x&quot; (a mere orthographic change), while if it was &quot;g&quot;, the &quot;-s&quot; caused it to devoice, again resulting in &quot;x&quot;. If the stem-final consonant was another alveolar consonant (&quot;t, d, r&quot;), it elided before the &quot;-s&quot;. In a later era, &quot;n&quot; before the nominative ending was also lost, producing pairs like &quot;atlas, atlant-&quot; (for English Atlas, Atlantic).

<doc id="1316018" wikidata="Q6460479" url="?curid=1316018" title="LYR electric units">
<text>The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) built suburban electric stock for lines in Liverpool and Manchester. The line between Liverpool to Southport began using electric multiple units (EMUs) on 22 March 1904, using a third rail 625 V DC. Additional trains were later built for this route, and in 1913 incompatible stock for the route to Ormskirk. Lightweight units were built to run on the Liverpool Overhead Railway.

The Southport units were replaced in the early 1940s; after regular through services onto the LOR were withdrawn the lightweight units were used on local Crossens services until 1945; the Ormskirk units were withdrawn in 1964.

In 1913, an experimental 3.5 kV DC overhead line system operated between Bury and Holcombe Brook in the Manchester area, and 1.2 kV DC with a side-contact third rail between Manchester Victoria and Bury. Electric services started in 1916, the Bury to Holcombe Brook route being converted in 1918. The cars were replaced in 1959/60.

==Liverpool==

===Liverpool to Southport===
Electrification of the Southport route was begun in 1902. It was increasingly popular for commuting and pleasure trips, but suffered from competition from the Cheshire Lines Railway. Electric traction was seen as cleaner than steam locomotives, and with coal prices rising, potentially cheaper. At the time, concerns were being expressed, especially in the railway press, that engineering developments in Britain was being overtaken by electrification projects in America and Switzerland. Preston-based Dick, Kerr and Company was responsible for the traction systems and the L&amp;YR built the rolling stock. A 625 V DC four-rail system was adopted. A live rail was outside the running rails from the centre of the track and above the top of the running rails. A return rail, cross-bonded to the running rails, was positioned centrally between the tracks. The route was long and gaps were left at 46 level crossings. The L&amp;YR built a power station at Formby, generating 7.5 kV AC, conveyed to four sub-stations by underground cables.

The first batch of trains were open saloons long and wide, initially in four-car sets. The two driving motor cars were third class, weighed powered by four motors. The traction current was controlled from driving cabs at both ends of the train. The two trailers were first class or third class and weighed . Doors were provided at the ends of the cars and electric lighting was installed. The trains had an automatic vacuum brake. The line between Liverpool Exchange and Southport opened on 22 March 1904. Seven trains an hour left Liverpool, one express and three stopping trains to Southport, and three terminating at . Electrification meant the journey time of stopping trains to Southport was reduced from 54 to 37 minutes. In 1905–6 a further eight motor coaches, six first-class trailers and six third-class trailers were built to slightly different design, followed by six more long motor coaches in 1910. To cope with the heavy traffic to the Grand National at , three trains of ten coaches were converted to allow them to be marshalled between the Southport direct-control motor coaches. The LY&amp;R stock began to be replaced by new stock in 1940, which became the British Rail Class 502 and all LYR examples had been withdrawn by 1942.

===Liverpool to Ormskirk===
The line to was electrified in stages, reaching Ormskirk in 1913, with different, incompatible EMUs. Initially, 12 third-class motor coaches with gangways on their outer ends and six third-class trailers were built, followed in 1910–14 by seven first-class and 23 third-class trailers, four driving trailer thirds, and eight motor coaches with motors. After the 1923 grouping the line was part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and in 1926–27, eleven LMS electric units were built for the Ormskirk route, not withdrawn until 1964.

===Liverpool Overhead Railway===
Connections were built with the Liverpool Overhead Railway (LOR) at to a new station beside LOR&#x27;s Seaforth Sands station and from the North Mersey Branch route to Aintree. From 2 July 1905, LOR trains began to run through to Seaforth &amp; Litherland. In 1906 the L&amp;YR electrified the line to . The L&amp;YR built special lightweight EMUs and from 1906 began running services over the LOR from Dingle to and Aintree. Regular services to Aintree were withdrawn in 1908, and after this special trains ran only twice a year, on Jump Sunday and the following Friday for the Grand National at Aintree Racecourse. Through services from Dingle to Southport were withdrawn in 1914, passengers changing at Seaforth &amp; Litherland. The trains were used on local services to Southport until 1945.

===Electric locomotive===
An experimental electric locomotive (rebuilt from a 2-4-2 steam locomotive) was introduced in 1912 for goods traffic and earned the nickname &quot;Beetle&quot;. This had four motors and could pick up current from the third rail on the main line or from overhead wires in Aintree and North Mersey yards. It was withdrawn and scrapped around 1919/20.

==Manchester==

===Holcombe Brook===
From 1913, an experimental electric service operated between Bury and Holcombe Brook. The equipment was provided by Dick, Kerr &amp; Co. of Preston, which was developing its products for overseas sales. It used was 3.5 kV DC overhead, and four cars, two driving motor brake thirds and two driving trailer thirds, were built at the LYR&#x27;s Newton Heath works. The motor cars had two motors, one and the other , and seated 75 passengers. The trailers seated 85 passengers. In 1918 the line was converted to the 1.2 kV DC system chosen for the Bury line and the cars stored before being converted into an experimental 4-car diesel-electric unit in 1927.

===Manchester to Bury===

After the Holcombe Brook service, the LYR decided to electrify the Manchester Victoria to Bury line using 1,200 V DC side-contact third rail, and originally a fourth rail was bonded to the running rails. The purpose of this unique third rail arrangement was to prevent the service being affected by ice forming on the live rail. Sixty-six cars were built at Newton Heath works, the electrical equipment having been supplied by Dick, Kerr &amp; Co. The cars were long, the driving motor cars weighing 54 tons and the trailer cars 29 tons. The stock was of all-metal construction, with steel framework and aluminium panelling for the sides and roof; the third class trailers seated 95 passengers, the motor cars 74 and the first class trailers 72. The trains were fitted with vacuum brakes.

The interiors of the cars were of open saloon design, with fixed and reversible seats – except in the first class carriage, where all seats were reversible. Doors were provided at the ends of the carriages; an unusual feature, though previously used on the original Liverpool-Southport trains, was that the doors were fitted inside an alcove so that they opened within the width of the train. The exits were fitted with particularly convenient handrails.

Although the Manchester Victoria to Bury line is less than 11 miles long, the trains had through corridor connections from end to end. Passengers were not provided with any means of stopping the train in an emergency, but could at least move into an adjacent carriage! Large emergency windows were provided, hinged at the top and opening outwards, a feature which the trains seem to have shared with the &quot;fireproof&quot; train developed by the LYR in 1914. There was no emergency lighting. The trains carried an oil lamp front and rear: the lamp at the front was in the centre when the train was carrying passengers and on the nearside of the buffer beam when it was working empty.

An electric bell system was provided for communication between guard and driver. There was a bell-push (operated by a key) at every door – a particularly convenient feature on the Bury to Holcombe Brook line, on which the guard, perhaps rather unusually in that era, collected the fares from passengers boarding at intermediate stations.

The trains are sometimes described as electrical multiple units (EMU&#x27;s), but this, in the normal sense of the term, is inaccurate. Each car was individually coupled to its neighbours, and the full line voltage (1.2 kV) passed the full length of the train. There was a driving cab at both ends of every car, including the trailers. This gave exceptional versatility in the formation of trains, which could range from two to five cars. The specified formations (all motor cars were 3rd class) were:

* Two-car: Motor and first-class trailer
* Three-car: Motor, first-class trailer and motor
* Four-car: Motor, first-class trailer, motor and third-class trailer
* Five-car: Motor, first-class trailer, motor, third-class trailer and motor

In practice, three-car trains were used on the Bury to Holcombe Brook line and, normally, five-car trains on the Manchester to Bury line – though from the mid-1950s onward 4-car trains, usually missing a motor car, were not uncommon. (These trains, though not necessarily in the precise formation shown above, would therefore frequently have a trailer leading.) It is doubtful if a two-car set, as specified, would have been viable: only the motor cars had current collectors, and a single motor car would almost certainly have failed to straddle the gaps in the live rail made necessary by the pointwork outside Victoria.

Controllers were normally operated automatically: the driver simply placed the handle in full series or full parallel and the train accelerated to the appropriate speed. Thus each motor car &quot;notched up&quot; and switched from series to parallel at its own speed.

Opening was delayed by World War I: the first public services ran on 17 April 1916, and 16 weeks later the steam trains were withdrawn. Electricity was generated at the LYR&#x27;s power station at Clifton Junction. (The station there is now known simply as Clifton.)

These units were withdrawn in 1959/60 and scrapped, being replaced by stock that became Class 504. Two bogies survived, which were used as temporary bogies in Bury depot when those of Class 504 units were removed for maintenance. When the depot closed in 1991, the bogies were scrapped.

===Battery electric shunter===
A four-wheeled, battery-electric shunter was built as a low priority job between 1917 and 1918 and used at Clifton power station. There are some claims it later operated in Scotland. It was noted at Derby Works in May 1946 and is understood to have operated at the Greenhill Sleeper Works in Derby from 1946.

<doc id="1316019" wikidata="Q744087" url="?curid=1316019" title="Wham!">
<text>Wham! were an English pop duo formed in Bushey in 1981 consisting of George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley. They were one of the most successful pop acts during the 1980s, selling more than 30 million certified records worldwide from 1982 to 1986. Associated with the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US, the singles &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot;, &quot;Careless Whisper&quot;, and &quot;Everything She Wants&quot; all topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Their 1984 Christmas hit &quot;Last Christmas&quot; has become a staple of the holiday season since its release, with all proceeds from the single going to charity. 

Influenced by funk and soul music and presenting themselves as disaffected youth, Wham!&#x27;s 1983 debut album &quot;Fantastic&quot; addressed the United Kingdom&#x27;s unemployment problem and teen angst over adulthood. Their second studio album &quot;Make It Big&quot; in 1984 was a worldwide pop smash hit, charting at number one in both the UK and the United States. In 1985, Wham! made a highly publicised ten-day visit to China, the first by a Western pop group. The event was seen as a major watershed moment in increasing friendly bilateral relations between China and the West.

In 1986, Wham! disbanded. Michael was keen to create music targeted at a more sophisticated adult market rather than the duo&#x27;s primarily teenage audience. Before going their separate ways, they released a farewell single, &quot;The Edge of Heaven&quot;, and a greatest-hits album titled &quot;The Final&quot;, along with a farewell concert entitled the Final.

==History==
Michael and Ridgeley met at Bushey Meads School in Bushey near the town of Watford in Hertfordshire. The two at first performed in a short-lived ska band called the Executive, alongside former school friends David Mortimer (later known as David Austin), Andrew Leaver, Tony Bywaters, Jamie Gould and Paul Ridgeley. When this group split, Michael and Ridgeley eventually formed Wham!. Ridgeley explained that the name originated from a need for &quot;something that captured the essence of what set us apart—our energy and our friendship—and then it came to us: Wham! Wham! was snappy, immediate, fun and boisterous too.&quot; British graphic design studio Stylorouge was credited with adding the exclamation mark to the name of the band.

Ridgeley and Michael worked persistently to get a foot in the door with recording executives. Ridgeley would frequently run into Mark Dean from Innervision Records at the Three Crowns Public House in Bushey Heath Hertfordshire, and hand him the band&#x27;s demo tape. In February 1982, Dean met with Michael and Ridgeley and offered them a recording deal. &quot;I&#x27;m going to offer Wham! a deal with my new label Innervision,&quot; Dean said. &quot;It&#x27;s not a huge thing, I&#x27;m taking a punt. I&#x27;d like you to have a crack at recording a single or two and we&#x27;ll see what happens from there.&quot;

Initially the pair wrote songs such as &quot;Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)&quot; and &quot;Club Tropicana&quot; together, but part way through the recording of their debut album &quot;Fantastic&quot;, the pair agreed that Michael was the stronger songwriter, and would take creative control. Still teenagers, they promoted themselves as hedonistic youngsters, proud to live a carefree life without work or commitment. This was reflected in their earliest singles which, part-parody, part-social comment, briefly earned Wham! a reputation as a dance protest group. The debut record to be released by the band was &quot;Wham Rap!&quot; in June 1982. The song charted at only No. 105. In September 1982, &quot;Young Guns (Go for It)&quot; was issued. Initially, it also stalled outside the UK Top 40 but the band got lucky when the BBC programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; scheduled them after another act unexpectedly pulled out of the show.

===Increasing success===
Wham!&#x27;s first manager was Bryan Morrison. The effect of Wham! on the public was felt from the moment they finished their debut performance of &quot;Young Guns (Go for It)&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Michael and Ridgley wore white espadrilles sockless, an open suede jacket and polo shirt, and rolled-up denim jeans. Ridgeley stood behind him, flanked by backing singers Dee C. Lee and Shirlie Holliman. Afterwards, the song shot into the Top 40 at No. 24 and peaked at No. 3 in December. The following year, Dee C. Lee began her work with Paul Weller in the Style Council, and was replaced by Helen &#x27;Pepsi&#x27; DeMacque. Holliman and DeMacque would later record as Pepsi &amp; Shirlie. Wham! followed up &quot;Young Guns (Go for It)&quot; with a reissue of &quot;Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)&quot;, &quot;Bad Boys&quot; and &quot;Club Tropicana&quot;. By the end of 1983, Wham! were competing against pop rivals Culture Club and Duran Duran as one of Britain&#x27;s biggest pop acts. Their debut album &quot;Fantastic&quot; spent two weeks at No. 1 in the UK album charts in 1983, but the album achieved only modest success in the US.

===Legal disputes with Innervision===
Soon after this, Ridgeley became conscious of legal problems with their initial contract at Innervision. While the legal battle raged, Innervision released a medley of non-single album tracks from &quot;Fantastic&quot;, entitled &quot;Club Fantastic Megamix&quot;. Wham! publicly denounced the release. After all the legal wrangling, Innervision settled out of court.

===Switch to Epic and continued success===
After the settlement, Innervision&#x27;s distributor, CBS Records, took over Wham!&#x27;s contract, placing them on the Columbia label in the U.S. and on Epic worldwide. Wham! returned in 1984 with a new album and an updated pop image. These changes helped to propel Wham!&#x27;s next single, &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot;, into the top ten of several countries around the world. It became their first U.S. and UK No. 1 single, accompanied by a video of the duo with Pepsi and Shirlie, all wearing Katharine Hamnett T-shirts with the slogans &quot;CHOOSE LIFE&quot; and &quot;GO GO&quot;.

The next single was &quot;Careless Whisper&quot;, featuring only Michael in the music video. In certain markets, including the U.S., the single was promoted as &quot;Wham! featuring George Michael&quot;, while most other markets it was credited to Michael as a solo act despite being written by both Michael and Ridgeley. The song was a ballad, marking a departure from previous releases. It reached No. 1, selling over 1.3 million copies in the UK. 

&quot;Careless Whisper&quot; marked a new phase in Michael&#x27;s career, as his labels began to somewhat distance him from the group Wham!&#x27;s playboy image. The next single was &quot;Freedom&quot; and was simply promoted as a Wham! single. Wham! used a video edited together from footage of their tour in China for &quot;Freedoms single release in the US, which was in July 1985. Their second album, &quot;Make It Big&quot;, climbed to No. 1 on the album charts and the band set off on an arena tour at the end of 1984.

The double A-side single &quot;Last Christmas&quot; / &quot;Everything She Wants&quot; became the highest-selling single ever to peak at No. 2 in the UK charts. It stayed at No. 2 for five weeks and, as of February 2020, was the 10th best-selling single of all time in the United Kingdom, selling over 1.9 million copies in the UK. Wham! donated all their royalties from the single to the Ethiopian famine appeal to coincide with the fund-raising intentions of Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; the song which kept them out of the top spot. Nevertheless, Band Aid&#x27;s success meant that Michael had achieved No. 1 status in the UK within three separate entities in 1984—as a solo artist, as one half of a duo, and as part of a charity ensemble. At the end of 1985, the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts listed &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot; as the No. 3 song and &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; as the No. 1 song of the year.

===China (1985)===
In March 1985, Wham! took a break from recording to embark on a lengthy world tour, including a ground-breaking 10-day visit to China, the first by a Western pop group. The China excursion was a publicity scheme devised by Simon Napier-Bell (one of their two managers; Jazz Summers being the other). It began with a concert at the Peoples&#x27; Gymnasium in Beijing in front of 12,000 people. They also played a concert in front of 5,000 in Canton. The two concerts were played without compensation. Wham!&#x27;s visit to China attracted huge media attention across the world. Napier-Bell later admitted that he used cunning tactics to sabotage the efforts of rock band Queen to be the first to play in China: he made two brochures for the Chinese authorities; one featuring Wham! fans as pleasant middle-class youngsters and one portraying Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury in typically flamboyant poses. The Chinese opted for Wham!.

British director Lindsay Anderson was engaged to accompany Wham! to China and make a documentary film about the visit. Anderson called his one-hour and 18 minute film &quot;If You Were There&quot;. In the final stages of editing, Anderson was dismissed by Wham!&#x27;s management, the editing team quit, and the film was re-edited, renamed and released as &quot;Wham! in China: Foreign Skies&quot;. According to a 2006 interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, Andy Stephens, manager for Michael, said that the film [Anderson&#x27;s version] was simply not good enough to be shown in public: &quot;It&#x27;s a dreadful film ... It&#x27;s 20 years old and it&#x27;s rubbish. Why on earth should we allow it to be shown?&quot; However, after viewing it in 2008, critic and journalist John Harris described it as &quot;a rich, poetic, panoramic portrait of China&#x27;s strangeness to the eyes of outsiders&quot;.

===Live Aid (1985)===
Sporting a beard, Michael appeared with Ridgeley onstage at Live Aid on 13 July 1985 (although they did not perform as Wham!). Michael sang &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; with Elton John, while Ridgeley joined Kiki Dee in the row of backing singers. In November, Wham! released the single &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; which went to No. 1 in the UK charts.

Around this time, Ridgeley began a relationship with Keren Woodward of Bananarama, and also took up the hobby of rally driving. &quot;Last Christmas&quot; was re-issued for the festive season and again made the UK Top 10, peaking at No. 6, while Michael took up offers he was starting to receive to add his voice to other artists&#x27; songs. He performed backing vocals for David Cassidy (&quot;The Last Kiss&quot;), and also for Elton John on his successful singles &quot;Nikita&quot; (UK No. 3) and &quot;Wrap Her Up&quot; (UK No. 12), on which he sang co-lead vocals.

===Break-up (1986)===
Michael was keen to create music targeted at a more sophisticated adult market rather than the duo&#x27;s primarily teenage audience, and therefore, he and Ridgeley officially announced the break-up of Wham! in the spring of 1986. Before going their separate ways, a farewell single &quot;The Edge of Heaven&quot;, and a greatest hits double album titled &quot;The Final&quot; would be forthcoming, along with a farewell concert at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium also entitled The Final. Announcing the break-up, Michael said: &quot;I think it should be the most amicable split in pop history.&quot;

The farewell single reached No. 1 in June 1986. &quot;Where Did Your Heart Go?&quot; was the group&#x27;s final single in the United States. The song was a cover of a Was (Not Was) song. 

While &quot;The Final&quot; was the duo&#x27;s last album release, it was not released in North America, Instead, Columbia released a pared down album called &quot;Music from the Edge of Heaven&quot; with some alternate tracks from The Final.

At Wembley Stadium on 28 June 1986, Wham! bid goodbye to their fans and each other with an emotional embrace at the end of its final concert. 72,000 people attended the eight-hour event, which included support artists, on a scorching hot day in London. The duo had been together for five years, selling over 28 million records and 15 million singles. &quot;Foreign Skies&quot;, the documentary of their tour of China, received its world premiere as part of the festivities.

===Post-Wham! and Michael&#x27;s death===
In January 1991, Ridgeley joined Michael on stage for a few songs at the encore of his performance at the Rock in Rio event at the Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 

Sony Music, the owners of CBS Records, released a greatest hits compilation in 1997 called &quot;The Best of Wham!: If You Were There...&quot;. Sony released another compilation in 2023 called &quot;The Singles: Echoes from the Edge of Heaven&quot;.

On 21 November 2009, there was a Wham!-themed night on television&#x27;s &quot;The X Factor&quot; in the UK. Michael later appeared on the show&#x27;s final episode, performing a duet of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; with finalist and eventual winner Joe McElderry. 

In 2012, Michael said that there was no truth in speculation that he and Ridgeley were set for a Wham! reunion to mark the 30th anniversary of the group&#x27;s first album.

Michael died from heart and liver disease at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire on Christmas Day 2016, at the age of 53. Upon hearing of Michael&#x27;s death, Ridgeley paid his respects on Twitter, saying, &quot;Heartbroken at the loss of my beloved friend Yog.&quot; Michael was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist in November 2023, with Ridgeley as the induction presenter.

<text>Freddie King (born Fred Christian; September 3, 1934December 28, 1976), also billed as Freddy King, was an American blues guitarist, singer and songwriter. He is considered one of the &quot;Three Kings of the Blues Guitar&quot; (along with Albert King and B. B. King, none of whom was a blood relative). Mostly known for his soulful and powerful voice and distinctive guitar playing, King had a major influence on electric blues music and on many later blues guitarists.

Born in Gilmer, Texas, King became acquainted with the guitar at the age of six. He started learning the guitar from his mother and his uncle. King moved to Chicago when he was a teenager; there he formed his first band the Every Hour Blues Boys with guitarist Jimmie Lee Robinson and drummer Frank &quot;Sonny&quot; Scott. As he was repeatedly being rejected by Chess Records, he got signed to Federal Records, and got his break with single &quot;Have You Ever Loved a Woman&quot; and instrumental &quot;Hide Away&quot;, which reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s rhythm and blues chart in 1961. It later became a blues standard. King based his guitar style on Texas blues and Chicago blues influences. The album &quot;Freddy King Sings&quot; showcased his singing talents and included the record chart hits &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Love Her with a Feeling&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Tore Down&quot;. He later became involved with producers who were more oriented to rhythm and blues and rock and was one of the first bluesmen to have a multiracial backing band at performances.
He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by ZZ Top in 2012 and into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1982. His instrumental &quot;Hide Away&quot; was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s list of &quot;500 Songs that Shaped Rock&quot;. He was ranked 19th in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2023 edition of 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.

==Biography==
===1934–1952: Early life===
Fred King was born in 1934 to Ella Mae King and J. T. Christian. When Freddie was 6 years old, his mother and his uncle taught him to play the guitar. In 1949, he and his family moved from Dallas to the South Side of Chicago.

In 1952, King started working in a steel mill. In the same year he married another Texas native, Jessie Burnett. They had seven children together.

===1952–1959: Move to Chicago and early works===
Almost as soon as he had moved to Chicago, King started sneaking into South Side nightclubs, where he heard blues performed by Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, T-Bone Walker, Elmore James, and Sonny Boy Williamson. King formed his first band, the Every Hour Blues Boys, with the guitarist Jimmie Lee Robinson and the drummer Frank &quot;Sonny&quot; Scott. In 1952, while employed at a steel mill, the eighteen-year-old King occasionally worked as a sideman with such bands as the Little Sonny Cooper Band and Earl Payton&#x27;s Blues Cats. In 1953 he recorded with the latter for Parrot Records, but these recordings were never released. As the 1950s progressed, King played with several of Muddy Waters&#x27;s sidemen and other Chicago mainstays, including the guitarists Jimmy Rogers, Robert Lockwood Jr., Eddie Taylor, and Hound Dog Taylor; the bassist Willie Dixon; the pianist Memphis Slim; and the harmonicist Little Walter.

In 1956 he cut his first record as a leader, for El-Bee Records. The A-side was &quot;Country Boy&quot;, a duet with Margaret Whitfield. The B-side was a King vocal. Both tracks feature the guitar of Robert Lockwood Jr., who during these years was also adding rhythm backing and fills to Little Walter&#x27;s records.

King was repeatedly rejected in auditions for the South Side&#x27;s Chess Records, the premier blues label, which was the home of Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, and Little Walter. The complaint was that King sang too much like B.B. King. A newer blues scene, lively with nightclubs and upstart record companies, was burgeoning on the West Side, though. The bassist and producer Willie Dixon, during a period of estrangement from Chess in the late 1950s, asked King to come to Cobra Records for a session, but the results have never been heard. Meanwhile, King established himself as perhaps the biggest musical force on the West Side. He played along with Magic Sam and reputedly played backing guitar, uncredited, on some of Sam&#x27;s tracks for Mel London&#x27;s Chief and Age labels, though King does not stand out on them.

===1959–1966: Federal Records===
In 1959 King got to know Sonny Thompson, a pianist, producer, and A&amp;R man for Cincinnati&#x27;s King Records. King Records&#x27; owner, Syd Nathan, signed King to the subsidiary Federal Records in 1960. King recorded his debut single for the label on August 26, 1960: &quot;Have You Ever Loved a Woman&quot; backed with &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Love Her with a Feeling&quot; (again credited as Freddy King). From the same recording session at the King Studios in Cincinnati, Ohio, King cut the instrumental &quot;Hide Away&quot;, which the next year reached number five on the R&amp;B chart and number 29 on the Pop chart, an unprecedented accomplishment for a blues instrumental at a time when the genre was still largely unknown to white audiences. It was originally released as the B-side of &quot;I Love the Woman&quot;. &quot;Hide Away&quot; was King&#x27;s melange of a theme by Hound Dog Taylor and parts by others, such as &quot;The Walk&quot;, by Jimmy McCracklin, and &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, as credited by King. The title of the tune refers to Mel&#x27;s Hide Away Lounge, a popular blues club on the West Side of Chicago. Willie Dixon later claimed that he had recorded King performing &quot;Hide Away&quot; for Cobra Records in the late 1950s, but such a version has never surfaced. &quot;Hide Away&quot; became a blues standard.

After their success with &quot;Hide Away&quot;, King and Thompson recorded thirty instrumentals, including &quot;The Stumble&quot;, &quot;Just Pickin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Sen-Sa-Shun&quot;, &quot;Side Tracked&quot;, &quot;San-Ho-Zay&quot;, &quot;High Rise&quot;, and &quot;The Sad Nite Owl&quot;. They recorded vocal tracks throughout this period but often released the tunes as instrumentals on albums.

During the Federal period, King toured with many notable R&amp;B artists of the day, including Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, and James Brown.

===1966–1974: Cotillion, Shelter, RSO Records===

King&#x27;s contract with Federal expired in 1966, by which time he had moved back to Dallas from Chicago, and his first overseas tour followed in 1967. His availability was noticed by the producer and saxophonist King Curtis, who had recorded a cover of &quot;Hide Away&quot;, with Cornell Dupree on guitar, in 1962. Curtis signed King to Atlantic in 1968, which resulted in two LPs, &quot;Freddie King Is a Blues Master&quot; (1969) and &quot;My Feeling for the Blues&quot; (1970), produced by Curtis for the Atlantic subsidiary Cotillion Records.

In 1969 King hired Jack Calmes as his manager, who secured him an appearance at the 1969 Texas Pop Festival, alongside Led Zeppelin and others, and this led to King&#x27;s signing a recording contract with Shelter Records, a new label established by the rock pianist Leon Russell and the record producer Denny Cordell and recorded at their studio, The Church Studio in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The company treated King as an important artist, flying him to Chicago to the former Chess studios to record the album &quot;Getting Ready...&quot; and providing a lineup of top session musicians, including Russell. Three albums were made during this period, including blues classics and new songs, such as &quot;Going Down&quot;, written by Don Nix.

King performed alongside the big rock acts of the day, such as Eric Clapton and Grand Funk Railroad (whose song &quot;We&#x27;re an American Band&quot; mentions King in its lyrics), and for a young, mainly white audience, along with the white tour drummer Gary Carnes, for three years, before signing with RSO Records. In 1974 he recorded &quot;Burglar&quot;, for which Tom Dowd produced the track &quot;Sugar Sweet&quot; at Criteria Studios in Miami, with the guitarists Clapton and George Terry, the drummer Jamie Oldaker and the bassist Carl Radle. Mike Vernon produced the other tracks. Vernon also produced a second album for King, &quot;Larger than Life&quot;,
for the same label. Vernon brought in other notable musicians for both albums, such as Bobby Tench of the Jeff Beck Group, to complement King.

===Death===
Nearly constant touring took its toll on King—he was on the road almost 300 days out of the year. In 1976 he began suffering from stomach ulcers. His health quickly deteriorated, and he died on December 28 of complications from this illness and acute pancreatitis, at the age of 42.

According to those who knew him, King&#x27;s untimely death was due to stress, a legendary &quot;hard-partying lifestyle&quot;, and a poor diet of consuming Bloody Marys because as he told a journalist, &quot;they&#x27;ve got food in them.&quot; King is buried at Hillcrest Memorial Park in Dallas, Texas.

==Musical style==
King had an intuitive style, often creating guitar parts with vocal nuances. He achieved this by using the open-string sound associated with Texas blues and the raw, screaming tones of West Side, Chicago blues. King&#x27;s combination of the Texas and Chicago sounds gave his music a more contemporary feel than that of many Chicago bands who were still performing 1950s-style music, and he befriended the younger generation of blues musicians. In his early career he played a solid-body gold-top Gibson Les Paul with P-90 pickups. He later played several slimline semi-hollow body Gibson electric guitars, including an ES-335, ES-345, and ES-355. He used a plastic thumb pick and a metal index-finger pick.

==Legacy==
By proclamation of the governor of Texas, Ann Richards, September 3, 1993, was declared Freddie King Day, an honor reserved for Texas legends, such as Bob Wills and Buddy Holly. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, and placed 15th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.

Several of King&#x27;s early 1960s instrumentals found their way into the repertoire of surf music bands: &quot;Those instrumental hits Freddy King had – &#x27;Hideaway&#x27;, &#x27;San-Ho-Zay&#x27;, &#x27;The Stumble&#x27; – [t]he way white kids were relating to it was like surf guitar in a way; instrumental music that you could dance to.&quot; One band that mixed R&amp;B and surf instrumentals occasionally included Jerry Garcia. He later explained: &quot;When I started playing electric guitar the second time, with the Warlocks, it was a Freddie King album that I got almost all my ideas off of, his phrasing really. That first one, &quot;Here&#x27;s Freddie King&quot;, later it came out as &quot;Freddie King Plays Surfin&#x27; Music&quot; or something like that, it has &#x27;San-Ho-Zay&#x27; on it and &#x27;Sensation&quot; and all those instrumentals&quot; (King&#x27;s 1961 instrumental album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Hide Away and Dance Away with Freddy King&quot;, was retitled &quot;Freddy King Goes Surfin&#x27; &quot; for a 1963 re-release).

According to music critic Cub Koda, King has influenced guitarists such as Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Lonnie Mack. In Michael Corcoran&#x27;s words, King &quot;merged the most vibrant characteristics of both [Chicago and Texas] regional styles and became the biggest guitar hero of the mid-sixties British blues revivalists, who included Eric Clapton, Savoy Brown, Chicken Shack, and Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac&quot;. Clapton said in 1985 that King&#x27;s 1961 song &quot;I Love the Woman&quot; was &quot;the first time I heard that electric lead-guitar style, with the bent notes ... [it] started me on my path.&quot; In a later interview with Dan Forte in &quot;Guitar World&quot;, he said of King&#x27;s guitar playing on his rendition of &quot;I Love The Woman&quot;: &quot;That just sent me into a complete kind of ecstasy, and it scared the shit out of me. I&#x27;d never heard anything like it, and I thought I&#x27;d never get anywhere near it. And I know now that I never will, but it was what immediately made me want to carry on.&quot; As &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; later wrote, &quot;Clapton shared his love of King with fellow British guitar heroes Peter Green, Jeff Beck and Mick Taylor, all of whom were profoundly influenced by King&#x27;s sharpened-treble tone and curt melodic hooks on iconic singles such as &#x27;The Stumble,&#x27; &#x27;I&#x27;m Tore Down&#x27; and &#x27;Someday, After Awhile.&#x27;&quot;

King was among many pioneering African-American blues musicians to embrace the British blues scene and tour its club circuit in the late 1960s. Robert Christgau credited King&#x27;s embrace of Britain with creating his renown as a pioneer of electric blues guitar. In Gary Graff&#x27;s &quot;MusicHound Rock&quot; (1996), the entry on King states: &quot;Although his reputation rests with his guitar, King also sang with an underrated, powerful style. His lasting influence has insured Freddie King&#x27;s recognition as one of the great postwar blues masters.&quot;

=== Appraisal of recording work ===
Recommending what albums of King&#x27;s music to hear, &quot;MusicHound Rock&quot; cited the 1993 Rhino compilation &quot;The Best of Freddie King&quot;, for focusing on &quot;the fruitful abundance&quot; of his recordings for King Records (1961–66), and the 1995 Black Top CD &quot;Live at the Electric Ballroom, 1974&quot;, for its &quot;blasting, ripping concert&quot; recording along with &quot;a rare pair of acoustic&quot; performances; &quot;Freddie King Is a Blues Master&quot; (1969) and &quot;My Feeling for the Blues&quot; (1970) were named records to avoid, as they &quot;both suffer from thin accompaniment, too little guitar and reedy vocals&quot;. John Swenson, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Jazz &amp; Blues Guide&quot; (1999), also recommended the Electric Ballroom recording, along with &quot;Home Cooking&#x27;s &quot;Live at the Texas Opry House&quot; (documenting a 1976 show in Houston)&quot;, saying they are &quot;the best antidotes to King&#x27;s lackluster studio work from these years&quot;.

In his only review of a King album, &quot;The Best of Freddie King&quot; (1975) by Shelter Records, Christgau wrote in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981) that the 1971–73 recordings are &quot;a bunch of Leon Russell and Don Nix boogies, [King&#x27;s] voice blurred, his guitar all fake and roll.&quot; He added that, while the guitarist had recorded some &quot;acute R&amp;B&quot; singles early in his career, he later &quot;coast[ed] for years&quot;. However, in a review of King&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Burglar&quot; for AllMusic, Joe Viglione called it &quot;entertaining and concise&quot; and believed the album &quot;stands as a solid representation of an important musician which is as enjoyable as it is historic&quot;.

<text>Acid Mothers Temple &amp; the Melting Paraiso U.F.O., commonly shortened to Acid Mothers Temple or AMT, is a Japanese rock band, the core of which formed in 1995. The band is led by guitarist Kawabata Makoto and early in their career featured many musicians and offshoot groups and collaborations, but by 2004 the line-up had coalesced with only a few core members and frequent guest vocalists.

The band has released albums frequently on a number of international record labels as well as the Acid Mothers Temple family record label, which was established in 1998 to document the activities of the whole collective.

==History==
Kawabata initially formed Acid Mothers Temple (originally &quot;Acid Mother&#x27;s Temple&quot;) with the intention of creating &quot;extreme trip music&quot; by editing and dubbing previous recordings, being influenced by progressive rock, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and krautrock. Kawabata, along with Koizumi Hajime, Suhara Keizo, and Cotton Casino formed the original Acid Mother&#x27;s Temple lineup as a group; however, the first recordings released were Kawabata&#x27;s own mixes and overdubs. The soul collective released two self-titled tapes on their eponymous label in 1997 before dropping the apostrophe from their name. They soon released their first self-titled album (see &quot;Acid Mothers Temple &amp; the Melting Paraiso U.F.O.&quot;). The group began to tour overseas in 1998.

The soul collective continued to tour and record, adding to the lineup drummer Ichiraku Yoshimitsu and guitarist Higashi Hiroshi. Several non-Acid Mothers shootoff bands formed, including Floating Flower, Nishinihon, and Tsurbami, while The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. played at sold-out shows and festivals all over North America, Japan, and Europe in the 2000s (decade). In 2002, the soul collective released four albums and two EPs in a three-month span while touring the United States, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, including South by Southwest in Austin, being selected as one of the top three groups performing.
Kawabata began his own solo offshoot, called Kawabata Makoto &amp; the Mothers of Invasion, in an attempt to create music with a more jazz feel. In 2002, along with Tsuyama Atsushi and Ichiraku Yoshimitsu, the group released their only album under this name.

In 2003, an incarnation of the soul collective called &quot;Acid Mothers Temple mode HHH&quot; was formed to tour Europe, consisting of Kawabata, Tsuyama, and Yoshida, a group who had played together as Seikazoku long before Acid Mothers Temple was formed. The same year, a collaboration of Acid Mothers Temple and Gong called &quot;Acid Mothers Gong&quot; performed at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

Soon after, in 2004, long-time vocalist and synthesizer player Cotton Casino left the group to concentrate on her own group and family while Acid Mothers Gong continued to tour. The group again released four albums in a three-month period, while another collaboration between Acid Mothers Temple and Afrirampo, Acid Mothers Afrirampo, released an album as well. Meanwhile, Acid Mothers Temple mode HHH renamed itself to Acid Mothers Temple SWR and released its own album.

In 2005, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Acid Mothers Temple, a new group called Acid Mothers Temple &amp; the Cosmic Inferno was formed, starting their first European tour in June, and consisting of Kawabata, Higashi Hiroshi, Tabata Mitsuru, Okano Futoshi, and Shimura Koji and releasing several albums. Acid Mothers Temple SWR continued to tour as well. Acid Mothers Temple &amp; the Incredible Strange Band was formed in 2006 by Tsuyama Akiko, Suhara Keizo, Aiko, Tsuyama Atsushi, and Kawabata Makoto. Kitagawa Hao joined The Cosmic Inferno as vocalist, though she left the soul collective after touring the United States in mid-2007. Tsuyama and Kawabata formed another offshoot in December 2006, Acid Gurus Temple, with Mani Neumeier of Guru Guru, which quickly changed its name to Acid Mothers Guru Guru.

The soul collective has also hosted its own yearly festival in Japan, appropriately titled Acid Mothers Festival, since 2002, which has been attended by Yamazaki Maso of Masonna, Afrirampo, Yoshida Tatsuya, Mani Neumeier, Kuriyama Jun, Ohpia, and Seiichi Yamamoto of Boredoms.

During their first Southamerican Tour in 2017 Acid Mothers Temple &amp; the Melting Paraiso U.F.O. met Argentine cult band Reynols. In Buenos Aires both groups went to a Studio to record together. In 2020 the album ACID MOTHERS REYNOLS &quot;Vol.1&quot; was released as LP by French label La Belle Brute and the same year the film &quot;Acid Mothers Reynols: Live and Beyond&quot; was presented documenting this historic meeting.

Acid Mothers Temple &amp; the Melting Paraiso U.F.O. traditionally tour Canada and the United States in the spring of every year, on a grueling schedule with very few days off, and continued this through 2019. Somewhat less frequently, they tour Europe in the autumn.

With regards to the often-confusing array of names for the different bands, Kawabata has explained:

<doc id="1316079" wikidata="Q69907" url="?curid=1316079" title="Hans von Tschammer und Osten">
<text>Hans von Tschammer und Osten (25 October 1887 – 25 March 1943) was a German sport official, SA leader and a member of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; for the Nazi Party of Nazi Germany. He was married to Sophie Margarethe von Carlowitz.

Hans von Tschammer und Osten led the German Sports Office &quot;Deutscher Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen&quot; (DRA) &quot;German Reich Commission for Physical Exercise&quot; after the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. In July the same year Hans von Tschammer was granted the title of &quot;Reichssportführer&quot;, &quot;Reich Sports Leader&quot;, and the whole sports sphere in Germany was placed under his control. He re-established the organization he led, transforming it into the Sports governing body of the Third Reich, &quot;Deutscher Reichsbund für Leibesübungen&quot; (DRL) &quot;Sports League of the German Reich&quot;. In December 1938 it was renamed &quot;Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen&quot; &quot;National-Socialist Sports League of the German Reich&quot;. Von Tschammer held the high-profile post of &quot;Reichssportführer&quot; until his death in 1943.

The name of today&#x27;s DFB-Pokal, Deutscher Fußball-Bund-Pokal &quot;German Football-Federation Cup&quot;, first contested in the 1934–35 season during von Tschammer&#x27;s tenure as &quot;Reichssportführer&quot;, was known as &quot;Hans von Tschammer und Osten-Pokal&quot; (&quot;Tschammerpokal&quot;) until it was last played in Nazi Germany in 1943. Many other innovative improvements regarding the organization of sports events that von Tschammer&#x27;s formidable Reich Sports Organ introduced, like the Olympic torch relay, are still in use today.

==Early life==

Hans von Tschammer und Osten was born in a family of landed gentry. After receiving a traditional upper-class education he went to fight at the front as an officer with the 6th Royal Saxon Infantry Regiment in the First World War. He was severely wounded in October 1914, resulting in the permanent paralysis of his right hand. He continued to serve in staff positions throughout the war, earning the Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd class. Leaving the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; in 1920 with the rank of , he returned to civilian life and became the agricultural manager on his ancestral estate. From 1923 to 1926 von Tschammer became the leader in Saxony of the Young German Order, one of the largest paramilitary groups in the Weimar Republic. 

==Nazi Party career==
In 1929 he joined the Nazi Party and became a member of the Party&#x27;s paramilitary organization, the SA, with the rank of SA-&quot;Standartenführer&quot;. In March 1932 he took over the leadership of the SA-&quot;Gruppe Mitte&quot; (Center Group) headquartered in Dessau and was promoted to SA-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot;. At the July 1932 German federal election, von Tschammer und Osten won a seat as a member of the German &quot;Reichstag&quot; from electoral constituency 10 (Magdeburg). He would remain a &quot;Reichstag&quot; deputy until his death.

After Adolf Hitler&#x27;s accession to power, von Tschammer was named &quot;Reichskommissar für Turnen und Sport&quot; (Reich Commissioner for Gym and Sports) of the German Sports Office &quot;Deutscher Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen&quot; (DRA) in April 1933. Although he had been a relatively unknown figure in German sports, von Tschammer saw as his goal the use of sports &quot;to improve the morale and productivity of German workers.&quot; Sporting skills were made a criterion for school graduation as well as a necessary qualification for certain jobs and admission to universities.

Von Tschammer disbanded the DRA, branded as a &quot;bourgeois entity&quot;, on 5 May 1933 (officially 10 May). He was then elevated to &quot;Reichssportführer&quot; on 19 July and the whole sports sphere in Germany was placed under his control. In January 1934, he was named the head of the &quot;Sportamt&quot; (Sports Office) of Strength Through Joy, the Nazi recreational organization. He replaced the DRA with a Nazi-oriented organization, the &quot;Deutscher Reichsbund für Leibesübungen&quot; (DRL) on 27 July 1934, to serve as the official sports governing body of Nazi Germany.

Von Tschammer was an active and able promoter of sports in Nazi Germany. He instituted the present-day German Football-Federation Cup. He also commissioned the publication of &quot;Sport und Staat&quot; (Sports and State), a massive four-volume Nazi propaganda report on the organized sports activities in the Third Reich. &quot;Sport und Staat&quot; was made by Arno Breitmeyer and Hitler&#x27;s personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann. This lavishly illustrated work had many pictures and information about the various Nazi organizations, i.e. SA, NSKK, Bund Deutscher Mädel, Hitler Jugend, etc. Printed in 1934 by the publishing house of the German Sports Aid Funds, a branch of the DRL, only volume one and two of a planned series of four volumes were published.

The aims of the promotion of sports in the Third Reich included hardening the spirit of every German as well as making German citizens feel that they were part of a wider national purpose. This was in line with the ideals of Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, the &quot;Father of physical exercises&quot;, who connected the steeling of one&#x27;s own body to a healthy spirit and promoted the idea of a unified, strong Germany. A more controversial aim was the demonstration of Aryan physical superiority. Under von Tschammer&#x27;s leadership, German Jewish athletes were systematically hindered by being denied adequate facilities and the opportunity to compete.
Hans von Tschammer und Osten enjoyed the Nazi sports festivals in which he took a keen interest as organizer. He appears often as a spectator in a white suit during the massive displays of Nazi pageantry.

On 17 August 1936, von Tschammer was appointed to the Prussian State Council by Prussian Minister President Hermann Göring. The 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin were held during von Tschammer&#x27;s tenure as &quot;Reichssportführer&quot; and President of the German Olympic Committee. He played a major role in the structure and organization of the Olympic Games together with Carl Diem, who was the former secretary of the Deutscher Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen (DRA). Von Tschammer entrusted the organization of the Fourth Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen to Karl Ritter von Halt, whom he named President of the Committee for the organization of the games. Von Tschammer would be later blamed by historians for enforcing a ban on non-Aryans in Germany&#x27;s Olympic team, a fact that was condemned internationally as a violation of the Olympic ethical code. But it is doubtful that he was the only one of the NSRL leaders behind that decision.

Despite his major role in the Olympics and in the world of sports of his time, von Tschammer never became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), a post he craved. In 1937 Karl Ritter von Halt was elected as member of the Executive Committee of the IOC instead of him. In January 1937, he was made head of the Sports and Physical Exercise Department in the Reich Ministry of the Interior and, in 1938, he was given the rank of State Secretary there. The same year he was promoted to SA-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;. However, von Tschammer&#x27;s influence began rapidly eroding, as war preparations diminished the influence of sports in Nazi Germany in favour of militarism.

Von Tschammer would never see the end of the organization he had led for so long, nor Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, for he died from pneumonia in Berlin in 1943. The assets he left behind were negligible for a man of his position. Von Tschammer was succeeded as &quot;Reichssportführer&quot; by Arno Breitmeyer.

<text>Consonant harmony is a type of &quot;long-distance&quot; phonological assimilation, akin to the similar assimilatory process involving vowels, i.e. vowel harmony.

==Examples==

===In Athabaskan languages===
One of the more common harmony processes is &quot;coronal harmony&quot;, which affects coronal fricatives, such as &quot;s&quot; and &quot;sh&quot;. Then, all coronal fricatives belong to the +anterior class (&quot;s&quot;-like sounds) or the -anterior class (&quot;sh&quot;-like sounds). Such patterns are found in the Dene (Athabaskan) languages such as Navajo (Young and Morgan 1987, McDonough 2003), Tahltan (Shaw 1991), Western Apache, and in Chumash on the California coast (Applegate 1972, Campbell 1997). In Tahltan, Shaw showed that coronal harmony affects three coronal fricatives, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;sh&quot; and the interdental &quot;th&quot;. The following examples are given by de Reuse: in Western Apache, the verbal prefix &quot;si-&quot; is an alveolar fricative, as in the following forms:

* &quot;a container and its contents are in position&quot;
* &quot;mushy matter is in position&quot;
* &quot;a load/pack/burden is in position&quot;
* &quot;three or more flexible objects are in position&quot;
* &quot;a slender flexible object is in position&quot;
* &quot;a solid roundish object is in position&quot;
* &quot;a flat flexible object is in position&quot;
* &quot;liquid matter is in position&quot;

However, when the prefix occurs before a verb stem that contains a post-alveolar affricate, the surfaces as the post-alveolar :

* &quot;three or more solid rigid inanimate objects are in position&quot;

Thus, all sibilant obstruents (fricatives and affricates) in these languages are divided into two groups, +anterior (, , ) and -anterior (, , ). In Navajo, as in most languages with consonant harmony, there is a constraint on the shape of roots (a well-formedness constraint) that is identical to the harmony process. All roots with sibilant affricates or fricatives have the same value for anteriority. Shaw (1991) provides a phonological analysis of this process, using data from research on Tahltan.

There are two interesting aspects of the process in Navajo. Firstly, morphemes that participate are domain-specific, only the last two domains are affected (conjunct + stem). Verbal morphemes from the outer or &#x27;disjunct&#x27; domain are not affected by the process: the process is morphologically conditioned. Secondly, the lateral affricate and fricative (, and ) appear with both values. Young and Morgan (1987) offer an extensive sets of examples of this type of morpheme alternation in Navajo.

===In Sanskrit===
A different example of coronal harmony, sometimes referred to as &quot;NATI rule&quot;, occurs in Sanskrit, where is retroflexed to if it is preceded by a retroflex continuant, mainly and , in the same word, even at a distance. The retroflexion spreads from left to right affecting any coronal nasal until the word boundary is reached. This phenomenon, however, is blocked whenever a coronal plosive is placed between / and . For instance, in the noun &quot;brāhmaṇa&quot; &quot;Brahmin priest&quot; (derived from the root &quot;*bṛh&quot; &quot;to make strong&quot; + the suffix &quot;-man-&quot; + the thematic vowel &quot;-a&quot;), the original coronal (IAST: &quot;n&quot;) of the action noun suffix &quot;-man&quot; changes to a retroflex (IAST: &quot;ṇ&quot;) due to consonant harmony triggered by (IAST: &quot;r&quot;). On the other hand, in the word अर्चन &quot;arcana&quot; &quot;homage, praising&quot; (from &quot;*ṛc&quot; &quot;to praise&quot; + &quot;-man-&quot; + &quot;-a&quot;) consonant harmony is prevented by the coronal stop (IAST: &quot;c&quot;) which blocks the assimilation.

===In Old Chinese===
Old Chinese probably had some constraint governing the shape of disyllables. According to modern reconstructions of Old Chinese phonology, type A and B syllables almost never co-occur in a disyllabic word. In the latest reconstruction of Old Chinese phonology proposed by Baxter and Sagart (2014), this type A vs. type B distinction can be traced back to the presence or the absence of pharyngealization respectively, cf. &lt; OC &quot;to bring into&quot; (type A) and &lt; OC &quot;to enter&quot; (type B) only differing by the [±pharyngeal] trait of the initial consonant. Onsets of type B syllables, lacking of pharyngealization, are subject to palatalization in Middle Chinese (indicated by a palatal medial &quot;-j-&quot; in Baxter&#x27;s notation), while type A pharyngealized onsets failed to palatalize. In many ancient disyllabic words type A and type B characters do not mix, there are almost solely bisyllabic morphemes either with type A syllables, such as:

* &lt; MC &lt; OC &quot;butterfly&quot;
* &lt; MC &lt; OC &quot;carefree&quot;
* &lt; MC &lt; OC &quot;beautiful and gentle (said of a woman)&quot;
or with type B syllables, including:
* &lt; MC &lt; OC &quot;Qilin&quot; (a mythical beast)
* &lt; MC &lt; OC &quot;cricket&quot;
* &lt; MC &lt; OC &quot;uneven, irregular&quot;

Such pattern seems to suggest the existence of some sort of pharyngeal harmony in Old Chinese. However, there are notable, though infrequent, exceptions to this tendency, manifesting in ancient compounds that are generally hard to analyze. From this list the following word is often mentioned:
* &lt; MC &quot;bjuwngH hwang&quot; &lt; OC &quot;Chinese phoenix, fabulous bird&quot;

===In Maghrebi Arabic===
Consonant harmony can also be observed in Moroccan Arabic and some southern dialects of Algerian Arabic in sequences of sibilants:
* as opposed to (&quot;two&quot;)
* as opposed to (&quot;sun&quot;)

===In other languages===
Various Austronesian languages have consonant harmony among the liquid consonants, with assimilating at a distance to or vice versa.

Guaraní shows nasal harmony, and certain affixes have alternative forms according to whether the root includes a nasal (vowel or consonant) or not. For example, the reflexive prefix is realized as oral before an oral stem like &quot;kill&quot;, but as nasal before a nasal stem like &quot;hit&quot;. The ã makes the stem nasal.

Some Finnish-speakers find it hard to pronounce both &#x27;b&#x27; and &#x27;p&#x27; in loanwords (, pub) and so they voice () or devoice () the entire word. It should, however, be noted that the distinction between the consonants is not native to Finnish. Native Finnish words do not use .

In the Ngeté-Herdé language of Cameroon, voicing of word-medial obstruents is strongly influenced by voicing of the word-initial consonant. Generally, all obstruents in a word are either voiced or voiceless.

<doc id="1316106" wikidata="Q138410" url="?curid=1316106" title="Total Eclipse of the Heart">
<text>&quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; is the lead single by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler from her fifth studio album, &quot;Faster Than the Speed of Night&quot; (1983) written and produced by Jim Steinman and recorded in 1982, released as a single by CBS/Columbia in 1983.

The song, a duet with Rory Dodd, became Tyler&#x27;s biggest career hit, topping the UK Singles Chart, and becoming the fifth-best-selling single in 1983 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the single spent four weeks at the top of the charts, keeping another Steinman penned song &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot; by Air Supply from reaching the top spot (a song Tyler would later cover in 1995), and it was &quot;Billboard&quot; number-six song of the year for 1983. The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.

Worldwide, the single has sales in excess of six million copies and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over one million copies after its release, updated to platinum in 2001 when the certification threshold changed. In 2015, the song was voted by the British public as the nation&#x27;s third favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV.

==Background and composition==
After her contract with RCA Records ended in 1981, Tyler found a new manager in David Aspden. After seeing Meat Loaf perform &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; live on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, she approached Meat Loaf&#x27;s writer, Jim Steinman, and asked him to be her producer. Tyler aimed to create an album utilizing the Wall of Sound production techniques of Phil Spector, and she believed that Steinman was the only person who could create the same sound, as Spector had mostly retired from the music business. Tyler visited Steinman in his apartment in New York in April 1982 with her manager, where she was presented with two tracks: &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&quot; and &quot;Goin&#x27; Through the Motions&quot;. She stated that had she not liked the songs Steinman played for her, he would have rejected Tyler&#x27;s invitation to collaborate. She returned to his studio apartment weeks later, where Steinman and Rory Dodd performed &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; for her. Steinman also hand-picked the recording band for the song, which included Dodd as a featured vocalist (the &quot;Turn around...&quot; refrain).

The lyric &quot;Turn around, bright eyes&quot; had originally appeared in Steinman&#x27;s 1969 college musical &quot;The Dream Engine&quot;. Steinman had originally written the song&#x27;s verse melody for his score to the 1980 film &quot;A Small Circle of Friends&quot;.

&quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; had to be shortened for radio play. Tyler did not believe that the song was radio-friendly at its full length; the song was reduced from seven minutes and two seconds to four minutes and thirty seconds.

The power ballad became Tyler&#x27;s highest-charting song in several countries, peaking at No. 1 in the United States, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom. At its peak, it sold 60,000 copies per day and approximately 6 million copies in total. It won the Variety Club award in the UK for best recording artist of 1983. The song also made number 82 of VH1&#x27;s top 100 love songs.

Tyler told &quot;Record Mirror&quot; that she thought the song was about &quot;someone who wants to love so badly she&#x27;s lying there in complete darkness.&quot;

Steinman said in an interview with &quot;Playbill&quot; about the inclusion of the song in his 1997 musical &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot;:with &#x27;Total Eclipse of the Heart&#x27;, I was trying to come up with a love song and I remembered I actually wrote that to be a vampire love song. Its original title was &#x27;Vampires in Love&#x27; because I was working on a musical of &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, the other great vampire story. If anyone listens to the lyrics, they&#x27;re really like vampire lines. It&#x27;s all about the darkness, the power of darkness and love&#x27;s place in the dark...He also told &quot;People&quot; that he thought Tyler sounded like John Fogerty and wrote the song &quot;to be a showpiece for her voice.&quot; Tyler described the song as &quot;a challenge [to sing],&quot; stating that she &quot;[doesn&#x27;t] like songs that anybody can sing. I like songs that need a lot of energy.&quot; After Steinman presented her with the song, she told &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;I just had shivers right up my spine...I couldn&#x27;t wait to actually get in and record it.&quot;

According to Meat Loaf, Steinman had written the song, along with &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot;, for Meat Loaf&#x27;s album &quot;Midnight at the Lost and Found&quot;; however, Meat Loaf&#x27;s record company refused to pay Steinman, and he wrote separate songs himself. &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; was given to Bonnie Tyler and &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot; to Air Supply. Tyler has denied this claim. &quot;Meat Loaf was apparently very annoyed that Jim gave that to me,&quot; Tyler stated. &quot;But Jim said he didn&#x27;t write it for Meat Loaf, that he only finished it after meeting me.&quot; Steinman said to &quot;People&quot; that he considered it &quot;an aria to me, a wagnerian-like onslaught of sound and emotion. I wrote it to be a showpiece for her voice.&quot;

In an interview with journalist Mick Wall shortly after the release of Meat Loaf&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose&quot;, Steinman stated: &quot;I didn&#x27;t write [Total Eclipse of the Heart] for anyone but Bonnie.&quot; Steinman believed that CBS were expecting him to write something similar to &quot;It&#x27;s a Heartache&quot;, but he had different ideas.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; was directed by Russell Mulcahy and was filmed at the Holloway Sanatorium, a large Victorian Gothic hospital near Virginia Water, Surrey, England. The surrealist video features Tyler clad in white, dreaming or fantasizing about students in a boys&#x27; boarding school. Young men are seen dancing and participating in various school activities and singing in a choir.

The video received two nominations at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Video Music Awards in 1983 for Best Performance by a Female and Most Effective Use of Symbolism.

A long-running urban legend is that the boy who appears throughout the video and who shakes Tyler&#x27;s hand at the end is former Italian footballer Gianfranco Zola. In a 2012 interview, Zola confirmed that he did not appear in the video.

In September 2023, the video exceeded one billion views on YouTube.

==Live performances==
Since the song&#x27;s release, Tyler has performed &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; in all of her concerts. &quot;I sing it much better now than I used to,&quot; she told &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. &quot;I think my voice is probably not as husky as it was, I think it&#x27;s mellowed a bit.&quot; The song was performed at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards, held at the Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, on 28 February 1984.

Bonnie Tyler sang &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; live on board a Royal Caribbean cruise ship during the solar eclipse of 21 August 2017, backed by DNCE.

Live recordings of Tyler performing the song have been released on her albums &quot;Bonnie Tyler Live&quot; (2006) and &quot;Live in Germany 1993&quot; (2011). Video performances have also been released on Tyler&#x27;s DVDs, &quot;Bonnie on Tour&quot; (2006) and the DVD edition of &quot;Live in Germany 1993&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Mike DeGagne from AllMusic retrospectively described &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; as &quot;one of the finest ballads ever to hit radio.&quot; He noted the &quot;lush instrumentation&quot; and said that Tyler&#x27;s voice &quot;produced the perfect type of &#x27;desperate lovelorn&#x27; effect to suit the romantic lyrics.&quot; He described Roy Bittan&#x27;s piano playing as &quot;dreamy&quot; and described Tyler&#x27;s voice as &quot;wonderfully gritty.&quot; Donald A. Guarisco, also from AllMusic, retrospectively reviewed &quot;Faster Than the Speed of Night&quot; and noted the song as an &quot;epic ballad&quot;, describing the whole album as &quot;rock at its most melodramatic.&quot; Jim Beviglia from &quot;American Songwriter&quot; said that Tyler&#x27;s raspy vocals helped to legitimize the &quot;melodrama inherent in the lyrics,&quot; and described the song as a &quot;garment-rending, chest-beating [and] emotionally exhausting ballad&quot; that suits the throes of a turbulent relationship.

==Impact==
In a 2013 UK survey, the song came first in a list of most popular songs to sing in the shower, above songs by Justin Bieber, Robbie Williams, One Direction and Elton John. In 2015, the song was voted by the British public as the nation&#x27;s third-favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV.

Due to the song&#x27;s lyrics comparing an ended romance with an eclipse, it often receives attention during solar and lunar eclipses. During the solar eclipse of 20 March 2015, Tyler&#x27;s version received a 214% increase of Spotify streams throughout the day. A similar impact was experienced during the solar eclipse of 21 August 2017, when Nielsen Music reported a 503% increase in record sales. Around that time, the song hit number one on the iTunes chart.

The song again reached No. 1 on the iTunes sales chart in the US during the solar eclipse of 8 April 2024. In the following week, Tyler re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Artist 100 chart at No. 79, and &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; entered the LyricFind Global chart at No. 25, the Canadian Digital Song Sales chart at No. 9, and the US Digital Song Sales Chart at No. 5.

==Other versions by Bonnie Tyler==
Since the original release in 1983, Tyler has re-recorded the song numerous times. In 2004, she released a duet version of the song with Peter Brocklehurst on his album &quot;For You&quot;. A solo version of the recording was released on her own studio album, &quot;Wings&quot;, the following year.

In January 2007, Tyler released another version of &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; in collaboration with British punk-electronic group BabyPinkStar. It peaked at no. 40 on the UK Independent Singles chart. In 2009, Tyler released a version of the song with Welsh choral group Only Men Aloud!. In 2011, Tyler re-recorded the song on an EP named after the song, released by Cleopatra Records. In 2013, another version of the song was released as a bonus track from her album &quot;Rocks and Honey&quot;, available exclusively on the UK iTunes Store.

In 2021, Tyler released a classical-dance version of the song on &quot;Classical 80s Dance&quot;, an album by German producer Alex Christensen and the Berlin Orchestra.

==Nicki French version==
English singer Nicki French released a hi-NRG remake of &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; in October 1994 that was also a worldwide hit. It was included on her debut album, &quot;Secrets&quot; (1995). The song originally peaked at No. 54 on the UK Singles Chart in 1994 but reached No. 5 after being re-issued in January 1995. In the United States, French&#x27;s version peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and it garnered frequent airplay on AC radio. It enjoyed greater success in Australia, spending four nonconsecutive weeks at No. 2. Elsewhere, the cover reached number 13 in New Zealand, number 16 in Canada, and peaked within the top 10 of several European countries.

===Background and release===
French had made her first dance version recording of &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; in 1994: she had purchased the Bonnie Tyler original as a teenager in 1983 and reacted negatively to the original suggestion that she (French) remake the song as a dance track — &quot;I thought, no, it&#x27;s too strong a song to go down the dance route. You know, it demeans it almost. But then I thought well, I&#x27;ll give it a go. And as soon as I heard the track, I thought it actually does work.&quot; The singer had been performing in London bands since the age of 12 and was given the chance to record a version when she received a phone call from a fellow British musician. French&#x27;s first recording of &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;, made with John Springate of the Glitter Band producing, came to the attention of Mike Stock and Matt Aitken, who produced their own recording of the song by French, and it was this version which appeared on the UK chart dated 15 October 1994 at No. 54. French would recall: &quot;I just thought oh well that was great...I&#x27;ve [worked with] Mike Stock and Matt Aitken and it was a dream come true...we tried and I had a great time...And then about two months later I had a call out of the blue from Mike saying the buzz will not die down on this track so we&#x27;re going to re-record the beginning...and we&#x27;re going to re-release it at the beginning of 1995.&quot;

According to French, her remake of &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; became popular in the UK and the US in distinct remixes: &quot;the slower version was the one that actually took a hold in the UK, where originally they started with the fast one and then decided to go with the [remix which began] in the same vein as the Bonnie Tyler version [and then] sped up when the chorus came in...In the US it was the [remix] which was fast all the way through.&quot; The single earned French two awards at the 1995 Hi-NRG Music Awards, in the categories for &quot;Single of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Female Vocal Performance&quot;. In 1996, the song was named &quot;Best Hi-NRG 12-inch of the Year&quot; at the International Dance Music Awards in Miami.

===Music video===
The song&#x27;s accompanying music video features French performing on a stage, in front of a giant, circular &quot;moon&quot; that occasionally draws up to eclipse itself. Smoke appear as &quot;clouds&quot; and she is backed up by a band and two female backup singers. Sometimes a dancer also performs in front of the &quot;moon&quot;. An alternate video also exists, set to the slower version of the song.

===Critical reception===
AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine remarked that French &quot;had a unexpected hit single with her dance-club, house-inflected cover&quot; of &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;. He added that &quot;although it was treated like a novelty at first, the version was as effective as the original and was a deserved success.&quot; Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; stated that the singer &quot;does a fair imitation of Bonnie Tyler on this bouncy hi-NRG/disco interpretation of the bombastic power ballad. U.K. and European punters already have warmly embraced this twirler, and odds are an even 50-50 for similar success here.&quot; American entertainment company &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; ranked French&#x27;s version number 26 in their &quot;The 101 Greatest Dance Songs of the &#x27;90s&quot; list in 2017. Steve Baltin from &quot;Cash Box&quot; felt that in the new version, &quot;only the radio edit retains the syrupy feel that made Tyler’s song such a smash. &#x27;Total Eclipse of the Heart&#x27; seems like it would be an odd choice for a dance cover, and this version confirms that suspicion... but it&#x27;s still a hit.&quot; Dave Sholin from the &quot;Gavin Report&quot; named it Record To Watch, writing, &quot;The song that never dies gets a &#x27;90s facelift and a tempo injection. Ten more believers.&quot; Robbie Daw from &quot;Idolator&quot; described it as a &quot;simmering dance rendition&quot;, including it in their &quot;The 50 Best Pop Singles of 1995&quot; list in 2015. In his weekly UK chart commentary, James Masterton said that it &quot;suffers from the inevitable dance beat tacked on and also the lack of Jim Steinman&#x27;s bombastic production that made the track such an epic in the first place.&quot; Pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; commented that &quot;away is the sandpaper vocal of Bonny Tyler , the edge now comes from the dance context put into the ballad. Needless to say it&#x27;s an upbeat song anno 1995. Top 10 in the UK.&quot;

==&quot;Si demain... (Turn Around)&quot;==

In 2003, Tyler re-recorded &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; as a bilingual duet with French singer Kareen Antonn. Produced by Faouze Barkati, Krem Barkati and Wallid Barkati, the track was named &quot;Si demain... (Turn Around)&quot;. It was released on 19 December 2003 by Yanis Records and appears on Tyler&#x27;s 14th studio album, &quot;Simply Believe&quot; (2004). The single topped the charts in Belgium and France.

===Background and release===
The release date for &quot;Si demain... (Turn Around)&quot; was brought forward by three weeks due to unprecendented demand after the track received pre-release radio airplay. Tyler and Antonn filmed the music video in Québec, Canada. Behind-the-scenes footage was released on Tyler&#x27;s concert film, &quot;Bonnie on Tour&quot; (2006).

Following the success of &quot;Si demain... (Turn Around)&quot;, Tyler and Antonn released a second duet, &quot;Si tout s&#x27;arrête (It&#x27;s a Heartache)&quot;, on 7 June 2004.

===Critical reception===
In reviews, critics praised &quot;Si demain... (Turn Around)&quot; for its inventive approach at re-recording a pre-established hit song. &quot;Platine&quot;, a French magazine, attributed the track&#x27;s success to an emerging trend of &quot;transborder duets&quot; in 2004. Music charts analyst Elia Habib noted that &quot;Si demain... (Turn Around)&quot; is the first bilingual chart-topping single since &quot;7 Seconds&quot; by Youssou N&#x27;Dour and Neneh Cherry in 1994. &quot;Music Actu&quot; stated the song was &quot;among the most popular singles of French public&quot; upon release, and noted its performance on the French singles chart.

===Chart performances and sales===
On the French SNEP Singles Chart, the single debuted at number 25 on 21 December 2003. It reached the top ten two weeks later and became number one in its fifth week. The single regained the number one spot on three occasions during the ten weeks at number one. It remained on the chart for 25 weeks, achieved Platinum status for over 500,000 copies sold, and was the fourth best-selling single of 2004 in France. &quot;Si demain... (Turn Around)&quot; is the only female duet number one single since the creation of French Top 50. It is also the single which made the biggest drop from number one, dropping directly to number ten. It also gave Bonnie Tyler the record of the longest time gap between top ten singles in France. Eighteen years passed between her hit &quot;If You Were a Woman (And I Was a Man)&quot; which reached number six in 1986 and of &quot;Si demain... (Turn Around)&quot;, hitting number one. The previous record, by Marc Lavoine, was 17 years old.

In Belgium (Wallonia), the song went to number one two weeks after its debut at number 21, and remained number one from 21 February to 10 April 2004, i.e. eight weeks. It stayed in the top 40 for 24 weeks. It was certified Platinum after eleven weeks on the chart. It was the second best-selling single of 2004 and totaled 31 weeks on the chart. In Switzerland, the single peaked at number seven for four weeks and remained on the chart for 34 weeks. &quot;Si demain... (Turn Around)&quot; was also broadcast on radio in Russia and Poland where it reached number one on local radios as well as on the main chart. The song was number six on the 2004 International List of French-speaking Music, compiled in collaboration with 122 radio stations throughout the world.

As of August 2014, the song was the 26th-best-selling single of the 21st century in France, with 508,000 units sold. However, when she participated in the French show &quot;La Méthode Cauet&quot;, Kareen Antonn affirmed that the single, then still ranked on the French Singles Chart, had exceeded the 700,000 sold copies. Worldwide, the song has sold more than 2 million copies (physical sales and digital downloads).

This was also the 6th literal video produced by professional video editor David A. Scott Jr.; the singer who performed for this re-dub was Scott&#x27;s friend Felisha Noble using the pseudonym Persephone Maewyn.

In 2010, Tyler appeared in an advertisement for MasterCard, performing a short parody of the song with its noted new lyric &quot;Turn around, Neville.&quot; She performed the original song in a similar advertisement for Westpac in 2012.

Munhoes was eliminated from the program, but the video of her performance went viral on the internet.

<text>Aḥmad bin Muḥammad bin Ibrāhīm bin Abū Bakr ibn Khallikān (; 22 September 1211 – 30 October 1282), better known as Ibn Khallikān, was a renowned Islamic historian who compiled the celebrated biographical encyclopedia of Muslim scholars and important men in Muslim history, &quot;Deaths of Eminent Men and the Sons of the Epoch&quot; (). Due to this achievement, he is regarded as the most eminent writer of biographies in Islamic history.

==Life==
Ibn Khallikān was born in Erbil on 22 September 1211 (11 Rabī’ al-Thānī, 608), into a family that claimed descent from Barmakids, an Iranian dynasty from Balkh.

His primary studies took him from Erbil, to Aleppo and to Damascus, before he took up jurisprudence in Mosul and then in Cairo, where he settled. He gained prominence as a jurist, theologian and grammarian. An early biographer described him as &quot;a pious man, virtuous, and learned; amiable in temper, in conversation serious and instructive. His exterior was highly prepossessing, his countenance handsome and his manners engaging.&quot;

He married in 1252 and was assistant to the chief judge in Egypt until 1261, when he assumed the position of chief judge in Damascus. He lost this position in 1271 and returned to Egypt, where he taught until being reinstated as judge in Damascus in 1278. He retired in 1281 and died in Damascus on 30 October 1282 (Saturday, 26th of Rajab 681).

<text>TeXShop is a free LaTeX and TeX editor and previewer for macOS. It is licensed under the GNU GPL.

==Details==
TeXShop was developed by American mathematician Richard Koch. It was modeled on NeXTstep&#x27;s bundled TeXview.app and developed for the then new macOS user interface Aqua and capitalized on the native PDF support of that version of the Macintosh operating system, which was itself based on NeXTSTEP&#x27;s successor OPENSTEP. Mitsuhiro Shishikura added a Macro editor, a magnifying glass for the preview window, and the ability to transfer mathematical expressions directly into Keynote presentations. Lacking the TeX eq → eps Service which TeXview afforded, other apps such as LaTeXiT.app were developed to provide Service support. TeXShop requires an existing TeX installation and is currently bundled with the MacTeX distribution.

The program (then version 1.19) won the 2002 Apple Design Award of &quot;Best Mac Open Source Port&quot; for its capability to display scientific and technical documents created in TeX format. In fact, TeXShop makes it possible, thanks first to &quot;pdfsync.sty&quot;, to switch back and forth between code and preview easily, jumping at a corresponding spot, simply by a CMD-click. From TeXShop 1.35 onward this also works with multipart documents, which are joined by &quot;\include&quot;.
Also, with version 1.35 TeXShop was extended with XeTeX support.

===Version History===
The MacOS &quot;Tiger&quot; version of TeXShop is capable of jumping from preview to code and vice versa without pdfsync.sty, using the PDF search technology built into Tiger.

Starting with version 2.18, TeXShop also has included support for SyncTeX. This technology also allows jumping from preview to code and vice versa without including any special style file,
but is much more reliable than PDF search, especially for documents that include mathematical formulae.

Version 2.26 in universal binary (PPC+x86) was released on 17 March 2009, requiring Mac OS X 10.4.3 or later with Mac OS X 10.5 recommended. Version 2.28 was released on 7 November 2009 as part of the TeX Live 2009 release of MacTeX.

For users of Mac OS X 10.2 and 10.3, Release 1.43 remains available (as well as v1.35e and 1.19 for 10.1.5 and earlier).

For users of Mac OS X 10.4 through 10.6, Release 2.47 remains available (10.5 or higher is strongly recommended).

As of Release 3.39, a new TeXShop dock icon, designed by Thiemo Gamma, has been used. In Finder, TeXShop documents will still use the original icon (designed by Jérôme Laurens and later re-constructed by William Adams for its use with retina displays) for associated LaTeX documents.

Available releases:

5.47: Intel and Arm, High Sierra through Sequoia (11/06/2024)

4.79: Sierra and above

4.44: Yosemite through Big Sur

2.47: Systems 10.4, 10.5, 10.6

<doc id="1316115" wikidata="Q26899515" url="?curid=1316115" title="Gregor Clegane">
<text>Gregor Clegane, nicknamed &quot;The Mountain That Rides&quot; or simply &quot;The Mountain&quot;, is a fictional character in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. In the books, the character is initially introduced in 1996&#x27;s &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;. He subsequently appeared in &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; (1998), &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (2000) and in &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; (2011).

A notorious knight and retainer to House Lannister, he is well known for his enormous size, prowess in battle, extremely cruel nature, and uncontrollable temper. He is the older brother of Sandor &quot;The Hound&quot; Clegane who has hated him ever since Gregor gruesomely scarred Sandor by shoving his face into a brazier when they were children. After being mortally wounded in a duel with Oberyn Martell, he is resuscitated by Qyburn via sinister means and becomes member of the Kingsguard and the personal bodyguard of Cersei Lannister.

In the HBO television adaptation, Clegane was originally portrayed by Australian actor Conan Stevens in season one, and by Welsh actor Ian Whyte in season two; Icelandic actor and world champion strongman Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson took over the role in season four and continued in the role until the final season.

== Character description ==
Ser Gregor Clegane is the head of House Clegane, a landed knight vassal to House Lannister, and is the older brother of Sandor Clegane. His enormous size and strength make him a fearsome warrior (in the novels he is nearly ) tall, and weighs over ), and he has earned a reputation for violence and brutality. When they were children, Gregor shoved Sandor&#x27;s face into a brazier for using his toy, gruesomely scarring him. Over the course of his service to Tywin Lannister, he has committed numerous war crimes, most infamously the rape and murder of the Targaryen royal family, but has repeatedly avoided punishment due to House Lannister&#x27;s power and influence over the Iron Throne. Clegane was one of the first Lannister soldiers to enter King&#x27;s Landing during its sack at the end of Robert Baratheon&#x27;s rebellion. He raped and murdered Princess Elia, after murdering her son Aegon by shattering the child&#x27;s head against a wall, a grudge House Martell still bears 14 years later at the onset of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;.

Gregor Clegane is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as Arya Stark and Cersei Lannister. Gregor is mostly a background character in the novels.

== Storylines ==
=== &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; ===
In &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, Tywin Lannister sends him to raid the Riverlands in retaliation for Catelyn Stark&#x27;s abduction of Tyrion. Beric Dondarrion is sent to arrest Gregor, but Gregor ambushes and kills him. He and his men continue raiding the Riverlands throughout &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;. When Tyrion Lannister demands a trial by combat in &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, the accuser Cersei Lannister chooses Gregor as her champion. Elia&#x27;s brother Oberyn Martell volunteers as Tyrion&#x27;s champion to expose Gregor as a murderer. Oberyn wounds Gregor with a poisoned spear, but the Mountain is ultimately victorious, admitting to murdering Elia and Aegon before crushing Oberyn&#x27;s skull. The dying Gregor is given to Qyburn for experimentation. Later Gregor&#x27;s skull is sent to Doran Martell and the Sand Snakes who question if it is really Gregor.

==== Robert Strong ====
Following Cersei&#x27;s walk of atonement, Qyburn presents Ser Robert Strong as Kingsguard&#x27;s newest member and Cersei&#x27;s champion for her upcoming trial by combat. Strong is of similar enormous stature as Gregor, and his body is completely covered in armor. Several characters have made comments about his unnatural behaviour and have theorized about who he could be, however he is currently not confirmed to be Ser Gregor.

=== &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; (TV adaptation) ===

==== Season 1 ====
Tywin Lannister sends Ser Gregor to raid the Riverlands. Beric Dondarrion is sent to arrest Gregor. When war breaks out, Gregor is given command of Tywin&#x27;s vanguard and left flank and leads his men through intimidation.

==== Season 2 ====
Ser Gregor is left to command Harrenhal in Tywin&#x27;s absence and to find and destroy &quot;The Brotherhood Without Banners&quot;, invoking the escape of Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie from Harrenhal. He later abandons Harrenhal after slaughtering the prisoners and is defeated by Edmure Tully at the Stone Mill, but manages to escape back to the Westerlands. Robb chides his uncle, having planned to draw the Mountain into a trap of his own making to be captured or killed.

==== Season 4 ====
Ser Gregor is chosen as Cersei&#x27;s champion for Tyrion&#x27;s trial by combat, and fights Oberyn Martell, Tyrion&#x27;s champion who wants to kill Gregor as revenge for the murder of his sister, Elia Martell. Oberyn inflicts several serious injuries on Clegane with his poisoned spear, but Gregor eventually kills Oberyn by crushing his skull, while admitting that he did rape Elia, killed her children and enjoyed it, before collapsing from his own injuries. It is later revealed that The Mountain has been poisoned with manticore venom, a poison with which Oberyn had laced his weapon, and that he is slowly dying. Cersei enlists ex-maester Qyburn to save him, though Qyburn claims that the procedure will &quot;change&quot; Clegane.

==== Season 5 ====
The procedure is seemingly a success as Ser Gregor returns to duty, now as a kingsguard, presenting himself as Cersei returns from her walk of shame. Though Qyburn&#x27;s treatment has changed his physical appearance and behavior, and seemingly made him completely mute, Qyburn explains that Ser Gregor - not naming him as such - has sworn a vow of silence and vowed to serve as Cersei&#x27;s personal bodyguard until all her enemies are destroyed and evil has been driven from the realm. He picks her up and carries her into Qyburn&#x27;s care, her demeanor visibly lifted.

==== Season 6 ====
Ser Gregor continues to act as Cersei&#x27;s bodyguard to intimidate all those who may bother or mock her. He also rips the head off of a Faith Militant with his bare hands when they try to take Cersei into their custody. After Cersei destroys the Great Sept of Baelor and retakes power, she has Gregor torture Septa Unella in revenge for torturing her during her time in prison.

==== Season 7 ====
Ser Gregor is still with Cersei as a member of the Queensguard. He is confronted by his brother Sandor &quot;The Hound&quot; Clegane in the season finale, where Sandor conveys an ominous message that he (Gregor) already knows who is coming for him and that he has always known.

==== Season 8 ====
Ser Gregor is present when Daenerys Targaryen arrives at King&#x27;s Landing with all her forces, demanding the release of her advisor Missandei and Cersei&#x27;s surrender. A defiant Cersei has Ser Gregor decapitate Missandei. Ser Gregor is killed in the penultimate episode when Cersei attempts to flee the Red Keep, meeting Gregor&#x27;s vengeful brother on their way down. Sandor quickly dispatches her guards and Gregor slays Qyburn as he insists upon obeying her, instead engaging in a sword duel with Sandor (whose presence seems to break his spell of loyalty). After stubbornly fighting his brother by any means available, and even penetrating his bared face with a dagger all the way through his skull (suggesting that Gregor is, in fact, dead and reanimated by magical means; see golem), Sandor finally tackles him into an unsteady wall as the Red Keep crumbles around them. The effort is finally successful, and both brothers fall out of the stairwell into a raging inferno below.

<doc id="1316116" wikidata="Q5556833" url="?curid=1316116" title="Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln">
<text>The sexuality of Abraham Lincoln has been the topic of historical speculation and research. No such discussions have been documented during or shortly after Lincoln&#x27;s lifetime; however, in the 19th century sexuality and same sex attraction were not often discussed. In recent decades (circa 1995), some writers have discussed purported evidence that he may have been homosexual.

Mainstream historians generally hold that Lincoln was heterosexual, noting that the historical context explains any of the supposed evidence. Lincoln had romantic ties with women, and he had four children in an enduring marriage to a woman. However, his intense bonds with men may or may not have had more meaning to them.

==Historical scholarship and debate==
Commentary on President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s sexuality has been documented since the early 20th century. Attention to the sexuality of public figures has been heightened since the gay rights movement in the late 20th century. In his 1926 biography of Lincoln, Carl Sandburg alluded to the early relationship of Lincoln and his friend Joshua Fry Speed as having &quot;a streak of lavender, and spots soft as May violets&quot;. &quot;Streak of lavender&quot; was period slang for an effeminate man and later connoted homosexuality. Sandburg did not elaborate on this comment. Historian and psychoanalyst Charles B. Strozier believes that it is unlikely for Sandburg to have used that phrase with homosexual implications, suggesting that he instead used the term to note &quot;Speed&#x27;s and Lincoln&#x27;s softer, more vulnerable sides, which shielded their vigorous masculinity&quot;.

In 1999, playwright and activist Larry Kramer claimed that he had uncovered previously unknown documents while conducting research for his work-in-progress, &quot;The American People: A History&quot;. Some were allegedly found hidden in the floorboards of the old store once shared by Lincoln and Joshua Speed. According to Kramer, the unseen documents reportedly provided explicit details of a relationship between Lincoln and Speed, and they currently reside in a private collection in Davenport, Iowa. Their authenticity, however, has been called into question by historians such as Gabor Boritt, who wrote, &quot;Almost certainly this is a hoax.&quot; C. A. Tripp also expressed his skepticism over Kramer&#x27;s discovery, writing, &quot;Seeing is believing, should that diary ever show up; the passages claimed for it have not the slightest Lincolnian ring.&quot;

In 2005, C. A. Tripp&#x27;s book, &quot;The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln&quot;, was posthumously published. Tripp was a sex researcher, a protégé of Alfred Kinsey, and was gay. He began writing &quot;The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln&quot; with Philip Nobile, but they had a falling out. Nobile later accused Tripp&#x27;s book of being fraudulent and distorted.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine addressed the book as part of a cover article by Joshua Wolf Shenk, author of &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a President and Fueled His Greatness&quot;. Shenk dismissed Tripp&#x27;s conclusions, saying that arguments for Lincoln&#x27;s homosexuality were &quot;based on a tortured misreading of conventional 19th century sleeping arrangements&quot;. But historian Michael B. Chesson said that Tripp&#x27;s work was significant, commenting that &quot;any open-minded reader who has reached this point may well have a reasonable doubt about the nature of Lincoln&#x27;s sexuality&quot;. 

In 2009, Charles Morris critically analyzed the academic and popular responses to Tripp&#x27;s book, arguing that much of the negative response by the &quot;Lincoln Establishment&quot; reveals as much rhetorical and political partisanship as that of Tripp&#x27;s defenders. In an earlier 2007 essay, Morris argues that in the wake of playwright Larry Kramer&#x27;s &quot;outing&quot; of Lincoln, the Lincoln Establishment engaged in &quot;mnemonicide&quot;, or the assassination of a threatening counter-memory. He put in this category what he called the methodologically flawed but widely appropriated case against the &quot;gay Lincoln thesis&quot; by David Herbert Donald in his book, &quot;We Are Lincoln Men&quot;.

Lincoln&#x27;s stepmother, Sarah Bush Lincoln, commented that he &quot;never took much interest in the girls&quot;. However some accounts of Lincoln&#x27;s contemporaries suggest that he had a strong but controlled passion for women. Lincoln was allegedly devastated over the 1835 death of Ann Rutledge. While some historians have questioned whether he had a romantic relationship with her, historian John Y. Simon reviewed the historiography of the subject and concluded that &quot;Available evidence overwhelmingly indicates that Lincoln so loved Ann that her death plunged him into severe depression. More than a century and a half after her death, when significant new evidence cannot be expected, she should take her proper place in Lincoln biography.&quot;

In her book &quot;Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln&quot;, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin argues:

Critics of the hypothesis that Lincoln was homosexual emphasize that Lincoln married and had four children. Scholar Douglas Wilson writes that Lincoln as a young man displayed robustly heterosexual behavior, including telling stories to his friends of his interactions with women.

Lincoln wrote a poem that described a marriage between two men, which included the lines:

This poem was included in the first edition of the 1889 biography of Lincoln by his friend and colleague William Herndon. It was expurgated from subsequent editions until 1942, when the editor Paul Angle restored it.

Tripp states that Lincoln&#x27;s awareness of homosexuality and openness in penning this &quot;bawdy poem&quot; &quot;was unique for the time period&quot; and that &quot;any ... nineteen or twenty year-old heterosexual male [would not have been able to write the poem].&quot; Lewis Gannett notes that the poem was &quot;a satirical poem, written to embarrass someone against whom Lincoln held a grudge&quot;.

== Marriage with Mary Todd Lincoln ==
Lincoln and Mary Todd met in Springfield in 1839 and became engaged in 1840. In what historian Allen Guelzo calls &quot;one of the murkiest episodes in Lincoln&#x27;s life,&quot; Lincoln called off his engagement to Mary Todd. This was at the same time as the collapse of a legislative program he had supported for years, the permanent departure of his best friend, Joshua Speed, from Springfield, Illinois, and the proposal by John Stuart, Lincoln&#x27;s law partner, to end their law practice. Lincoln is believed to have suffered something approaching clinical depression. In the book &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Preparation for Greatness: The Illinois Legislative Years,&quot; Paul Simon has a chapter covering the period, which Lincoln later referred to as &quot;The Fatal First&quot;, or January 1, 1841. That was &quot;the date on which Lincoln asked to be released from his engagement to Mary Todd&quot;. Simon explains that the various reasons given for the engagement being broken contradict one another. The incident was not fully documented, but Lincoln did become unusually depressed, which showed in his appearance. Simon wrote that it was &quot;traceable to Mary Todd&quot;. During this time, he avoided seeing Mary, causing her to comment that Lincoln &quot;deems me unworthy of notice&quot;.

Jean H. Baker, historian and biographer of Mary Todd Lincoln, describes the relationship between Lincoln and his wife as &quot;bound together by three strong bonds—sex, parenting and politics&quot;. In addition to the anti–Mary Todd bias of many historians, engendered by William Herndon&#x27;s (Lincoln&#x27;s law partner and early biographer) personal hatred of Mrs. Lincoln, Baker discounts historic criticism of the marriage. She says that contemporary historians have a misunderstanding of the changing nature of marriage and courtship in the mid-19th century, and attempt to judge the Lincoln marriage by modern standards. According to the book &quot;Lincoln the Unknown&quot;, Lincoln chose to spend several months of the year practicing law on a circuit that kept him living separately from his wife.

Baker states that &quot;most observers of the Lincoln marriage have been impressed with their sexuality&quot; and that &quot;male historians&quot; suggest that the Lincolns&#x27; sex life ended either in 1853 after their son Tad&#x27;s difficult birth or in 1856 when they moved into a bigger house, but have no evidence for their speculations. Baker writes that there are &quot;almost no gynecological conditions resulting from childbirth&quot; other than a prolapsed uterus (which would have produced other noticeable effects on Mrs. Lincoln) that would have prevented intercourse, and in the 1850s, &quot;many middle-class couples slept in separate bedrooms&quot; as a matter of custom adopted from the English.

Far from abstaining from sex, Baker suggests that the Lincolns were part of a new development in America of smaller families; the birth rate declined from seven births to a family in 1800 to around 4 per family by 1850. As Americans separated sexuality from childbearing, forms of birth control such as coitus interruptus, long-term breastfeeding, and crude forms of condoms and womb veils, available through mail order, were available and used. The spacing of the Lincoln children (Robert in 1843, Eddie in 1846, Willie in 1850, and Tad in 1853) is consistent with some type of planning and would have required &quot;an intimacy about sexual relations that for aspiring couples meant shared companionate power over reproduction&quot;.

Herndon, Lincoln&#x27;s law partner and biographer, attests to the depth of Lincoln&#x27;s love for Ann Rutledge. An anonymous poem about suicide published locally three years after her death is widely attributed to Lincoln. In contrast, his courting of Mary Owens was diffident. In 1837, Lincoln wrote to her from Springfield to give her an opportunity to break off their relationship. Lincoln wrote to a friend in 1838: &quot;I knew she was oversize, but now she appeared a fair match for Falstaff&quot;.

== Relationship with Joshua Speed ==

Lincoln met Joshua Fry Speed in Springfield, Illinois, in 1837, when Lincoln was a successful attorney and member of Illinois&#x27; House of Representatives. They lived together for four years, during which time they occupied the same bed during the night (some sources specify a large double bed) and developed a friendship that would last until Lincoln&#x27;s death. According to some sources, William Herndon and a fourth man also slept in the same room.

Historians such as David Herbert Donald point out that it was not unusual at that time for two men to share a bed due to myriad circumstances, without anything sexual being implied, for a night or two when nothing else was available. Lincoln, who had just moved to a new town when he met Speed, was also at least initially unable to afford his own bed and bedding; however, Lincoln continued sleeping in a bed with Speed for several years. A tabulation of historical sources shows that Lincoln slept in the same bed with at least 11 boys and men during his youth and adulthood.

There are no known instances in which Lincoln tried to suppress knowledge or discussion of such arrangements, and in some conversations, raised the subject himself. Tripp discusses three men at length and possible sustained relationships: Joshua Speed, William Greene, and Charles Derickson. However, in 19th-century America, it was not necessarily uncommon for men to bunk-up with other men, briefly, if no other arrangement were available. For example, when other lawyers and judges traveled &quot;the circuit&quot; with Lincoln, the lawyers often slept &quot;two in a bed and eight in a room&quot;. William H. Herndon recalled for example, &quot;I have slept with 20 men in the same room&quot;.

In the nineteenth century, most men were probably not conscious of any erotic possibility of bed-sharing, since it was in public. Speed&#x27;s immediate, casual offer, and his later report of it, suggests that men&#x27;s public bed-sharing was not then often explicitly understood as conducive to forbidden sexual experiments. In such public arrangements, they would not be alone.

Nevertheless, Katz says that such sleeping arrangements &quot;did provide an important site (probably the major site) of erotic opportunity&quot; if they could keep others from noticing. Katz states that referring to present-day concepts of &quot;homo, hetero, and bi distorts our present understanding of Lincoln and Speed&#x27;s experiences.&quot; He states that, rather than there being &quot;an unchanging essence of homosexuality and heterosexuality,&quot; people throughout history &quot;continually reconfigure their affectionate and erotic feelings and acts&quot;. He suggests that the Lincoln-Speed relationship fell within a 19th-century category of intense, even romantic man-to-man friendships with erotic overtones that may have been &quot;a world apart in that era&#x27;s consciousness from the sensual universe of mutual masturbation and the legal universe of &#x27;sodomy,&#x27; &#x27;buggery,&#x27; and &#x27;the crime against nature&#x27;&quot;.

Some correspondence of the period, such as that between Thomas Jefferson Withers and James Henry Hammond, may provide evidence of a sexual dimension to some secret same-sex bed-sharing. The fact that Lincoln was open about sharing a bed with Speed is seen by some historians as an indication that their relationship was not romantic. None of Lincoln&#x27;s enemies hinted at any homosexual implication.

Joshua Speed and Lincoln corresponded about their impending marriages, and Gore Vidal regarded their letters to each other as having evinced a degree of anxiety about being able to perform sexually on their wedding nights that indicated a homosexual relationship had once existed between them. Despite having some political differences over slavery, they remained in touch until Lincoln died, and Lincoln appointed Joshua&#x27;s brother, James Speed, to his cabinet as Attorney General.

In 2016, historian and psychoanalyst Charles B. Strozier published, &quot;Your Friend Forever, A. Lincoln: The Enduring Friendship of Abraham Lincoln and Joshua Speed,&quot; in which he examines their relationship. In 1982, Strozier had previously written &quot;Lincoln’s Quest for Union&quot;, in which there was a chapter that some had taken as support for the Lincoln gay thesis. Strozier concludes that the relationship was not homosexual and that Lincoln was straight.

== Relationship with David Derickson ==
Captain David Derickson of the 150th Pennsylvania Infantry was Lincoln&#x27;s bodyguard and companion between September 1862 and April 1863. They shared a bed during the absences of Lincoln&#x27;s wife, until Derickson was promoted in 1863. Derickson was twice married and fathered ten children. Tripp recounts that, whatever the level of intimacy of the relationship, it was the subject of gossip. Elizabeth Woodbury Fox, the wife of Lincoln&#x27;s naval aide, wrote in her diary for November 16, 1862, &quot;Tish says, &#x27;Oh, there is a Bucktail soldier here devoted to the president, drives with him, and when Mrs. L. is not home, sleeps with him.&#x27; What stuff!&quot; This sleeping arrangement was also mentioned by a fellow officer in Derickson&#x27;s regiment, Thomas Chamberlin, in the book &quot;History of the One Hundred and Fiftieth Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, Second Regiment, Bucktail Brigade&quot;. Historian Martin P. Johnson states that the strong similarity in style and content of the Fox and Chamberlin accounts suggests that, rather than being two independent accounts of the same events as Tripp claims, both were based on the same report from a single source. David Donald and Johnson both dispute Tripp&#x27;s interpretation of Fox&#x27;s comment, saying that the exclamation of &quot;What stuff!&quot; was, in that day, an exclamation over the absurdity of the suggestion rather than the gossip value of it (as in the phrase &quot;stuff and nonsense&quot;).

<doc id="1316121" wikidata="Q2577752" url="?curid=1316121" title="William A. Purtell">
<text>William Arthur Purtell (May 6, 1897 – May 31, 1978) was an American businessman and politician. A member of the Republican Party, he represented Connecticut in the United States Senate in 1952 and from 1953 to 1959.

==Biography==
William Purtell was born in a tenement neighborhood of Hartford, Connecticut. He was the son of Thomas Michael and Nora Mary (née O&#x27;Connor) Purtell, who were tobacco workers. He received his early education at St. Patrick&#x27;s School, and attended Hartford Public High School for two years before dropping out at age 15. He then worked as a janitor, water boy, and car checker for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.

During World War I, he served with the radio section of the U.S. Army Expeditionary Force in France, being discharged as a corporal in 1919. That same year, he married Katherine Elizabeth Cassidy; the couple had a son, William, and a daughter, Margaret.

==Business career==
After working as a salesman for ten years, Purtell co-founded the Holo-Krome Screw Corporation of West Hartford in 1929 and served as its president, treasurer, and general manager until 1952. He also served as president, treasurer, and general manager (1937-1944) and later chairman (1944-1947) of the Billings &amp; Spencer Company of Hartford. From 1938 to 1952, he served as vice-president, treasurer, and general manager of the Sparmal Engineering Corporation. He was also director of the Hartford Red Cross and one of the executive directors of the Connecticut State Prison.

Purtell unsuccessfully ran for the Republican nomination for Governor of Connecticut in 1950, losing to Congressman John Davis Lodge. He was one of the first political leaders in Connecticut to support General Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1952 presidential election.

==U.S. Senate==
In May 1952, Purtell won the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic incumbent William Benton for a seat in the United States Senate. However, when Connecticut&#x27;s other Democratic Senator, Brien McMahon, died in July of that year, Governor Lodge appointed Purtell to the Senate to fill the remainder of McMahon&#x27;s term. Thus, Purtell was in the unusual position of filling one Senate seat while running for another. Fellow Republican businessman Prescott Bush, the father of George H. W. Bush and the grandfather of George W. Bush, was later elected to McMahon&#x27;s seat. During his campaign against Benton, Purtell supported General Eisenhower&#x27;s campaign platform on &quot;Communism, corruption, and Korea.&quot; Benton accused Purtell of being so conservative that he &quot;makes Bob Taft look like a left-wing New Dealer.&quot; Still, Benton was defeated by Purtell by a margin of 88,788 votes, receiving 52% of the vote.

During his tenure in the Senate, Purtell co-sponsored an amendment to federal labor laws making discrimination by employers or labor organizations an unfair labor practice. In 1954, he expressed his support for the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s proposal for a government-conducted vote before a union could go on strike. Purtell voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. In 1958, Purtell was defeated for re-election by his Democratic opponent Thomas J. Dodd, a former Congressman and father of future Senator Chris Dodd, by a margin of 57%-42%.

==Later life and death==
Following his Senate career, Purtell resumed his manufacturing interests. He died at his home in West Hartford, at age 81. He is buried in Fairview Cemetery.

<text>XeTeX ( 
or ; see also Pronouncing and writing &quot;TeX&quot;) is a TeX typesetting engine using Unicode and supporting modern font technologies such as OpenType, Graphite and Apple Advanced Typography (AAT). It was originally written by Jonathan Kew and is distributed under the X11 free software license.

The last change to the source code was made on January 20, 2020, and there has been no further development since then.

Initially developed for Mac OS X only, it is now available for all major platforms. It natively supports Unicode and the input file is assumed to be in UTF-8 encoding by default. XeTeX can use any fonts installed in the operating system without configuring TeX font metrics, and can make direct use of advanced typographic features of OpenType, AAT and Graphite technologies such as alternative glyphs and swashes, optional or historic ligatures, and variable font weights. Support for OpenType local typographic conventions (codice_1 tag) is also present. XeTeX even allows raw OpenType feature tags to be passed to the font. Microtypography is also supported. XeTeX also supports typesetting mathematics using Unicode fonts that contain special mathematical features, such as Cambria Math or Asana Math as an alternative to the traditional mathematical typesetting based on TeX font metrics.

==Mode of operation==
XeTeX processes input in two stages. In the first stage XeTeX outputs an extended DVI (codice_2) file, which is then converted to PDF by a driver. In the default operating mode the codice_2 output is piped directly to the driver without producing any user-visible intermediate files. It is possible to run just the first stage of XeTeX and save the codice_2, although there are no viewers capable of displaying the intermediate format.

Two backend drivers are available to generate PDF from an codice_2 file:
* xdv2pdf, which uses ATSUI and QuickTime frameworks, and only works on Mac OS X.
* xdvipdfmx, a modified version of dvipdfmx, which uses FreeType. This driver works on all platforms.

Starting from version 0.997, the default driver is xdvipdfmx on all platforms. As of version 0.9999, xdv2pdf is no longer supported and its development has been discontinued.

XeTeX works well with both LaTeX and ConTeXt macro packages. Its LaTeX counterpart is invoked as codice_6. It is usually used with the codice_7 package, which provides a configurable interface for font selection, and allows complex font choices to be named and later reused.

XeTeX is bundled with TeX Live, MacTeX, MiKTeX and Lyx (see the History below for dates and versions).

==Example==
The following is an example of XeLaTeX source and rendered output. The typeface used is OFL-licensed font Linux Libertine. The text is to be processed by the command codice_6.

==Arabic support==

XeTeX also supports right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic. One way of rendering Arabic in XeTeX is to use the package arabxetex. In order to do so, the Arabic is placed inside the following:
\begin{arab}[utf]
.
\end{arab}
The following code illustrates this:

== Features ==
In bibliographic files (see below the BibTeX example) you can use Unicode entities and call them with their native scripting, for example \cite{Ekstrøm}, instead of a transliterated ASCII form like \cite{Ekstrom} which is mandatory using the pdfTeX engine.

% Encoding: UTF8
@ARTICLE(Ekstrom,
 AUTHOR = &quot;Author w&quot;,
 TITLE = &quot;{Ekstrøm title}&quot;,
 JOURNAL = &quot;Ekstr{\o}m Journal&quot;,
 YEAR = 1965,
 note = {Working with pdflatex}
 @ARTICLE(Ekstrøm,
 AUTHOR = &quot;Author Ekstr{\o}m&quot;,
 TITLE = &quot;{Ekstrøm title}&quot;,
 JOURNAL = &quot;Ekstrøm Journal&quot;,
 YEAR = &quot;1965&quot;,
 note = {Not working with pdflatex but with xelatex}


==History==

XeTeX was initially released for Mac OS X only in April 2004 with built-in AAT and Unicode support. In 2005 support for OpenType layout features was first introduced. During BachoTeX 2006 a version for Linux was announced, which was ported to Microsoft Windows by Akira Kakuto a few months later, and finally included into TeX Live 2007 for all major platforms. XeTeX is also supported by LyX since version 2.0 and shipped with MiKTeX since version 2.7.
As of the inclusion in TeX Live, XeTeX supports most macro packages written for LaTeX, OpenType, TrueType and PostScript fonts without any specific setup procedure.
Version 0.998 announced at BachoTeX 2008 supports Unicode normalization via the codice_9 command.
Version 0.9999, released in May 2013, switched from ICU Layout Engine to HarfBuzz for OpenType layout, and Graphite2 engine for Graphite layout, as well Core Text framework instead of ATSUI on Mac OS X.

<doc id="1316127" wikidata="Q714583" url="?curid=1316127" title="Terry Richardson">
<text>Terrence Richardson (born August 14, 1965) is an American fashion and portrait photographer. He has shot advertising campaigns for Marc Jacobs, Aldo, Supreme, Sisley, Tom Ford, and Yves Saint Laurent among others, and also done work for magazines such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;i-D&quot;, and &quot;Vice&quot;.

Since 2001, Richardson has been accused by multiple models of sexual misconduct. In 2017, brands and magazines that had worked with Richardson in the past began distancing themselves from him, and said they would no longer employ him. He has not actively worked as a photographer since 2018.

==Early life==
Richardson was born in New York City, the son of Norma Kessler, an actress, and Bob Richardson, a fashion photographer who struggled with schizophrenia and drug abuse. Richardson&#x27;s father was Irish Catholic and his mother is Jewish. Following the divorce of his parents, Richardson moved to Woodstock, New York, with his mother and stepfather, English guitarist Jackie Lomax. Richardson later moved to the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, where he attended Hollywood High School. 

He moved with his mother to Ojai, California, where he attended Nordhoff High School, when he was 16. Richardson originally wanted to be a punk rock musician rather than a photographer. He played bass guitar in the punk rock band The Invisible Government for four years. He played bass for a variety of other punk bands in Southern California including Signal Street Alcoholics, Doggy Style, Baby Fist and Middle Finger.

==Career==
Richardson&#x27;s mother reportedly gave him his first snapshot camera in 1982, which he used to document his life and the punk rock scene in Ojai. In 1992, Richardson quit music and moved to the East Village neighborhood of New York City, where he began photographing young people partying and other nightlife. It was in New York City that he had his first &quot;big break.&quot; 

His first published fashion photos appeared in &quot;Vibe&quot; in 1994. His &quot;Vibe&quot; spread was shown at Paris&#x27; International Festival de la Mode later that year. Following the showing, Richardson shot an advertising campaign for fashion designer Katharine Hamnett&#x27;s spring 1995 collection. The campaign was noted for images of young women wearing short skirts with their pubic hair showing.
Richardson then moved to London and worked for the magazines &quot;The Face&quot;, &quot;i-D&quot; and &quot;Arena.&quot;

Throughout his career, Richardson has shot the campaigns of fashion brands and designers such as: Marc Jacobs, Aldo, Supreme, Sisley, Tom Ford, and Yves Saint Laurent. He has also worked for magazines such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar.&quot;

Richardson has produced several campaigns for Diesel, including the &#x27;Global Warming Ready&#x27; which won a Silver Lion for Print at Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival in 2007. He has produced several private portraits for the company&#x27;s founder, Renzo Rosso. In September 2011, they hosted a mutual book launch together with fashion editor Carine Roitfeld, at Colette in Paris.

In 2012 Richardson embarked on his first solo exhibition at Los Angeles&#x27;s OHWOW Gallery, titled &quot;Terrywood.&quot; In May 2012, a video of model Kate Upton performing the Cat Daddy dance for Richardson in his studio went viral. In December 2012, Lady Gaga announced that Richardson was filming a documentary about her life. Gavin McInnes of &quot;Vice&quot; defended Richardson in 2004, saying his work was criticized by &quot;first-year feminist types.&quot;

=== Gallery shows ===

Richardson held his first gallery showing in 1998. The show, entitled &quot;These Colors Don&#x27;t Run&quot; and held at Alleged Gallery, coincided with the release of his first book entitled &quot;Hysteric Glamour.&quot; His work was later included in another show entitled &quot;Smile&quot; at Alleged Gallery. Richardson had his first Paris show at Galarie Emmanuel Perrotin in 1999. Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Feared by Men Desired by Women&quot; was shown at an exhibition at London&#x27;s Shine Gallery the following year.

&quot;Terryworld,&quot; an exhibition of Richardson&#x27;s work of the name, was shown in 2004 at Deitch Gallery in New York City. The Orange County Museum of Art showed Richardson&#x27;s work as part of a group show entitled &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; in 2005. &quot;Mom + Dad,&quot; a show exhibiting work from Richardson&#x27;s book of the same name, was held at Half Gallery in New York City in 2011. The same year, photographs from Richardson&#x27;s book &quot;Hong Kong&quot; were shown at Art Hong Kong. Richardson&#x27;s work was later shown at Los Angeles&#x27;s OHWOW Gallery. The exhibition was titled &quot;Terrywood&quot; and ran from February 24 to March 31, 2012.

=== Music videos ===
Richardson began directing music videos in the late 1990s. He directed videos for Death in Vegas and Primal Scream as well as alternate music video of the song &quot;Find a New Way&quot; by Young Love, and Whirlwind Heat&#x27;s &quot;Purple&quot; featuring models Susan Eldridge and Charlotte Kemp Muhl. He directed the music video for &quot;Red Lips&quot; by Sky Ferreira. He also makes a cameo appearance in Thirty Seconds to Mars&#x27;s video for &quot;Hurricane&quot;. 

The music video for &quot;Oldie&quot; by Odd Future was recorded during a photoshoot with Richardson and was published on March 20, 2012. Richardson can be seen in the video snapping photos of the collective while they party and play in front of a large white backdrop. On August 29, 2013, he directed Beyoncé in a music video at Coney Island for her single &quot;XO&quot;. He also directed &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; by Miley Cyrus. In late 2013 Richardson did the treatment on the music video for &quot;Do What U Want&quot; by Lady Gaga and R. Kelly from her third studio album titled &quot;Artpop&quot;, but the film was never released. On August 21, 2017, Richardson directed the Anitta music video, &quot;Vai Malandra&quot;, at Vidigal, Rio de Janeiro.

=== Style ===
There are several repeating themes in Richardson&#x27;s work, notably that of putting high-profile celebrities in mundane situations and photographing them using traditionally pedestrian methods, such as the use of an instant camera. His work also explores ideas of sexuality, with many of the pieces featured in his books &quot;Kibosh&quot; and &quot;Terryworld&quot; depicting full-frontal nudity and both simulated and actual sexual acts. Initially, many of Richardson&#x27;s subjects were shot before a white background but he eventually expanded to other backdrops. 

He is known for posing with his subjects, often giving them his trademark glasses so they may &quot;pretend to be him&quot; or, in the case of actress Chloë Sevigny, posing them in makeup and costume so that they look like him. Richardson counts Larry Clark, Nan Goldin, Diane Arbus and Robert Frank as early influences on his artistic style. His work has been praised by Helmut Newton.

Richardson described his style as, &quot;Trying to capture those unpremeditated moments when people&#x27;s sexualities come up to the surface.&quot;

Richardson is also known for his nonsexual portraiture. He has taken portraits of a wide variety of celebrities and politicians.

==Personal life==
=== Relationships and family ===
Richardson was married to model Nikki Uberti from 1996 to 1999. Richardson dated political staffer and businesswoman Audrey Gelman from 2011 until 2013.

He started dating his long-time photography assistant, Alexandra &quot;Skinny&quot; Bolotow in 2014. On March 19, 2016, Bolotow gave birth to twin boys. He has said it was &quot;the most intense, inspiring, , and humbling experience of my life.&quot; The couple married in 2017 in Taos, New Mexico.

He currently resides in Bearsville, New York.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 2010, Richardson became involved with RxArt, a charity that donates art to children&#x27;s hospitals.

== Sexual misconduct allegations ==
Since 2001, Richardson has been accused multiple times of using his influence in the fashion industry to sexually exploit models during photo shoots, including coercing them to engage in sexual acts with him.

Models with whom he has worked (including Rie Rasmussen and Jamie Peck) have accused Richardson of sexual misconduct, including exploitation.

In a 2010 interview at French Institute Alliance Française, Marc Jacobs said that Richardson is &quot;not ill-spirited&quot;. Richardson published a letter in 2014 in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; defending himself against the accusations. Richardson said that the allegations are false and that he considers himself &quot;considerate and respectful&quot; of his photography subjects. Models including Noot Seear, Daisy Lowe, and Charlotte Free have defended him.

In 2017, due to the allegations of Richardson&#x27;s sexual misconduct, many fashion brands and fashion magazines decided to no longer commission his work, including Valentino, Bulgari, and the Condé Nast magazines: &quot;Vogue,&quot; &quot;Glamour,&quot; &quot;Wired,&quot; &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and &quot;GQ.&quot; Following the professional repercussions, he has not actively worked since 2018.

<text>CB4 is a 1993 American satirical mockumentary black comedy film directed by Tamra Davis and starring Chris Rock. The film follows a fictional rap group named &quot;CB4&quot;, named after the prison block in which the group was allegedly formed (Cell Block 4). The movie primarily parodies gangsta rap and the rap group N.W.A, as well as taking inspiration from &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;. It contains short segments featuring celebrities and musicians such as Halle Berry, Eazy-E, Butthole Surfers, Ice-T, Ice Cube, Flavor Flav, and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal.

==Plot==
Albert Brown, an aspiring rapper and suburban kid who idolizes the gangsta rappers he sees on TV, decides to start a rap group with his friends, Euripides and Otis. Unfortunately, even though all three of them are talented, they have no connections and no image with which they can market themselves.

In order to get their name heard and build up a reputation, they appeal to local crime kingpin and nightclub owner Gusto, along with his sidekick and henchman 40 Dog, to ask for a spot on the bill at his club. During their meeting, by complete coincidence, the police rush in and throw Gusto in jail. Gusto believes that the trio set him up, swearing revenge when he is released from prison. Taking advantage of the situation, Albert steals his criminal background and identity, renaming himself &quot;MC Gusto&quot; while Euripides and Otis take the names &quot;Dead Mike&quot; and &quot;Stab Master Arson&quot;, respectively. Pretending to be newly released convicts, they form the hardcore gangsta rap group CB4 (Cell Block 4) and successfully sign with Trustus Jones, a local music mogul.

CB4 quickly becomes the hottest band on the charts with controversial hits like &quot;Sweat from My Balls&quot; and &quot;Straight Outta LoCash,&quot; and their rise to fame is documented by an aspiring director and his cameraman. However, an ambitious politician seeks to shut them down for obscenity charges, tensions between the group arise over one member&#x27;s gold-digging groupie girlfriend, Sissy, and the strain of the charade takes its toll on Albert&#x27;s family life and relationship with his wholesome girlfriend, Daliha. To compound this, the real Gusto escapes from prison and exacts his revenge by making Albert take part in a record store robbery, exposing his face to the CCTV cameras, and then taking the tape as a tool for blackmail so he can profit from Albert&#x27;s success.

CB4 breaks up, with Dead Mike becoming an Afrocentric rapper. At the same time, Stab Master Arson establishes himself as a successful DJ, leaving Albert to wallow in self-pity and his growing addiction to drugs. One day, he gets a call from Mike that Trustus is dead, having choked to death in terror while eating when Gusto pointed a gun at him in a restaurant. Fed up with Gusto taking everything he has, Albert decides to set up a sting operation to nab the gangster by having Sissy seduce him and then trading places with her to entrap Gusto so the police can arrest him and send him to prison for life.

Albert accepts that he is not a gangsta and makes a comeback under his own name. He persuades Mike and Stab Master Arson to reform the group, and they embark on a highly successful reunion tour.

==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack containing hip hop music was released on March 2, 1993, by MCA Records. It peaked at #41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #13 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

==Reception==
The movie had a mixed reception from critics. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that despite &quot;CB4&quot; having been &quot;one of the more adventurous of the recent African-American comedies, it still gets bogged down in those movie-movie formulas, those phony recipes for success.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Janet Maslin wrote that the film &quot;promises sharper satire than it actually delivers. Pandering a shade too avidly to the real rap audience, the film sometimes tries to use the same sexist, mean-spirited ethos it makes fun of.&quot;

The movie currently holds a rating of 52% &quot;Rotten&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 27 reviews.

===Box office===
The film ranked No. 1 at the box office in its opening weekend, with sales totaling $6,116,000 across 1,205 theaters. At the end of its domestic run it had grossed a total of $17,953,778. Chris Rock stated that the film&#x27;s budget was $6 million.

<text>Holly Sherwood is an American rock vocalist, best known for her work with Jim Steinman, providing both lead and backing vocals.

==Acting career==
At the age of three, Holly Sherwood began her professional career as the star of Procter and Gamble&#x27;s &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Reflects&quot; Ivory Soap commercials. As she grew, she and four of her sisters were cast in a production of Richard Rodgers&#x27; &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, which led to appearances in no less than eighteen other productions of the show. In 1966, she was cast in the Broadway revival of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, where her talent was noticed by the show&#x27;s composer Irving Berlin, who added a new song tailored to her abilities. This was followed by an appearance in the Los Angeles premiere of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;MASS&quot;.

Later in her career, she appeared on television in Steven Bochco&#x27;s &quot;Cop Rock&quot; for ABC, and was at one point part of the musical support for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, performing comical jingles; she also provided background vocals for Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s performance of &quot;Physical&quot;

==Recording career==
In March 1972, she embarked on a solo career with her first single, &quot;Day by Day&quot;, a cover of a song from the popular Broadway musical &quot;Godspell&quot; (which also incorporated a medley of two other numbers from the show), produced by Tony Orlando for Rocky Road Records. Her version went to #104 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart, and also charted in the United Kingdom. In 1973, she released the song &quot;Yesterday and You&quot;, a Top 30 single on the Easy Listening chart and #117 on the Bubbling Under chart.

In the late 1970s, she performed a duet with Leonard Coleman Boone called &quot;There&#x27;s No Me Without You&quot;, and was a part of the musical group Wondergap with Jim Ryan and Andy Goldmark, signed to A&amp;M Records. Later in her career, she recorded background vocals for Billy Joel and Kenny Loggins, sang with Cindy Bullens on the MCA release &quot;The Touch&quot;, and performed with Joe Cocker, Arlo Guthrie, and Pete Seeger (on his Hudson Valley Sloop tour, singing with the Rooster River Boys).

==Jim Steinman==
In 1983, Sherwood began an extended association with Jim Steinman when she performed background vocals for Bonnie Tyler on her smash hit album &quot;Faster Than the Speed of Night&quot;, produced by Steinman. Her voice can be heard on several tracks of the album including the international hit single &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; as well as the album&#x27;s six-and-a-half-minute title track in which Sherwood performed a distinctive &quot;vocal wail&quot; towards the end of the song. She became part of a group of regular background vocalists, including &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; veteran Rory Dodd and Eric Troyer, who appeared frequently on Steinman product during the 1980s, including tracks recorded by diverse artists such as Barry Manilow, Barbra Streisand, and Tyler, both performing and arranging background vocals.

===Fire Inc.===
Among other credits, Laurie Sargent of Face to Face, Dodd, Sherwood, and Troyer formed the nucleus of the impromptu band Fire Inc., created by Steinman to perform two songs he had written for Walter Hill&#x27;s &quot;rock and roll fable&quot; &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;. Sherwood&#x27;s performances with Laurie Sargent&#x27;s vocals on the songs &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot; and &quot;Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young&quot; were dubbed over Diane Lane&#x27;s in the movie.

===Pandora&#x27;s Box===
Steinman formed another group, Pandora&#x27;s Box, which released one album, &quot;Original Sin&quot;, in 1989. In addition to background vocals, Sherwood sang lead on the track &quot;Good Girls Go to Heaven (Bad Girls Go Everywhere)&quot;, later covered by Meat Loaf on his album &quot;Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell&quot;. According to Steinman, she also recorded a demo of &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot;, later a hit for Celine Dion in 1996, in connection with this album, but her take was passed over in favor of fellow vocalist Elaine Caswell&#x27;s.

==Later life==
According to the publicly accessible portion of her LinkedIn profile, Sherwood later went on to work as a screenplay writer for Sherwood Scott Artists LLC, based in New Mexico, for 20 years and lives on the East Coast.

She also briefly owned The Sherwood Gallery, which featured a collection of rare artwork.

As of now, she has no plans to make an album of her own.

<doc id="1316138" wikidata="Q599193" url="?curid=1316138" title="High Fens">
<text>The High Fens (; ; ), which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in Liège Province, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of northwestern Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park &quot;Hohes Venn-Eifel&quot; (), in the Ardennes. Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (watered only by precipitation, instead of surface water, as the appellation “fens” would imply), both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park.

In 1966, the European Council awarded the &quot;Diploma of Conservation&quot; to the High Fens, for their ecological value. In 2008, Belgium has added the High Fens to its tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage sites.

==Geography==

The High Fens, established as a reserve in 1957, with their high altitude and unique location, consist mainly of raised bogs, and low, grass- or wood-covered hills, moorland and forest. The provincial capital of Liège is to its west, the German border is to the east and the dark forested hills of the Ardennes surround the southern part. The park stretches between Eupen in the north, Monschau in the east, Spa in the west and Malmedy in the south. It stretches north of Malmedy as far as Eupen and marks the end of the Ardennes proper. It is contiguous with the Eifel hills, which stretch east from the German border to form the large Deutsch–Belgischer Naturpark. Signal de Botrange located in the Haute Fagnes is marked by a Telecom Tower erected over an older artificial, earthen mound with stone steps that was built to raise a small part of the broad plateau from . Large urban centres in the vicinity of the reserve are Eupen, Verviers, Spa and Malmedy.

Part of the High Fens reserve remains closed during the spring breeding season of the endangered black grouse (&quot;Tetrao tetrix&quot;). During the summer there is a risk of fire in the forest area. Boardwalks cross the bogs, permitting access across these areas. Paths lead to many areas of the park, and there are signposts to guide visitors through the park. The nature reserve of the High Fens is coordinated under the Nature Division and Forests of the Walloon Region.

===Climate===
The reserve is one of the wettest and coldest parts of Belgium. It is frequently shrouded in mist and low cloud. It has a subalpine climate with strong winds and fierce winters, which are occasionally subarctic. The Fagnes plateau intercepts clouds brought by the prevailing Atlantic winds, and this results in copious precipitation, with an average of of rain per year. However, beneath the fragile composition of the overlying soils are rocky beds and clay that prevent infiltration of water and thus create the conditions for wetlands, marshes and bogs.

The highest and lowest annual rainfall recorded are and respectively, with maximum on a single day of on 7 October 1982 at the Signal de Botrange. The maximum snowfall recorded at Signal de Botrange was in 1953. The maximum number of frost days (when the temperature remains below ) in a year is reported to be 158 days and the minimum is 70 days. The lowest temperature recorded was in 1942, but it was in 1952 at Baraque-Michel.

Several rivers have their sources in the High Fens: the Vesdre, Hoëgne, Warche, Gileppe, Eau Rouge, Amblève, Our, Kyll, and Rur. In winter all the water sources freeze into snow making the High Fens one of the best ski resorts in Belgium. During winter the swamps appear as if &quot;wrapped in white fluffy snow shawl&quot;.

===Zoning===
The region has been zoned under a 1992 regulation into specific areas to manage access for visitors and tourists. These areas are designated as Zones B, C, and D. Zone B is open to the public daily, with specific regulations: bicycles and dogs are prohibited, visitors must stay on designated tracks, waste must be disposed of in trashcans only, and silence must be maintained. Zone C can be visited only accompanied by a guide authorised by the park administration. However no access to this zone is allowed from mid-March to late June, when an endangered species, the black grouse, breeds here. Zone D is a totally protected reserve area, with no access to the public.

==Flora and fauna==

In the High Fens the habitats of many plants and animals typically found further north or in the mountains, result from the geology and relief, the harsh climate, high rainfall, long and cold winters and low average temperatures in the region.

The High Venn&#x27;s plateau thus is rich in flora and fauna some of which have become rare and threatened in the last more than three centuries. The heathers and turf moors in the reserve have a significant role to maintain biodiversity for the rare and threatened flora and fauna as it ensures regulation of the water balance and maintains value of the landscape. However, since the 17th century, peat cutting, drainage, inappropriate spruce plantations, infestation of the ground by the purple moor-grass, a herb, had caused problems for the ecology of the region. These negative aspects are now being rectified by special projects titled &quot;Life-Nature Project&quot;.

===Flora===
The common heather or &quot;Calluna&quot;, a small bush of height is grazed by sheep and also has healing qualities; the bilberry, in the family Ericaceae, is a shrub found at an altitude of 500 m (around 1600 feet); the rootless peat mosses (&quot;Sphagnum&quot;) of about grow at a year and form the basic turf moors through the buildup of organic matter; cotton grass, a perennial plant in wet regions; sundew (&quot;Drosera rotundfolia&quot;) found in the acid turfs of the reserve which are carnivores and consumes insects. The logo of the park is the seven-petalled flower of Chickweed-Wintergreen (&quot;Lysimachia europaea&quot;), not to be confused with other plants with similar names such as Chickweed (&quot;Cerastium&quot; spp.) or Wintergreen (&quot;Gaultheria&quot; spp.).

===Fauna===

Faunal species recorded are: the wild boar, roe deer, hen harrier, black grouse, wood mouse, grasshopper warbler, great grey shrike, meadow pipit, European stonechat and northern wheatear. The black grouse, a protected species, is found in small numbers. It is a sedentary bird. The male species has black plumage with a red wattle above the eyes while the female species has a brown plumage with black, grey and white stripes and possesses a light forked tail. Vertebrates, spiders and insects reported in the reserve are: orvet (&quot;Anguis fragilis&quot;), &quot;Odonata Orthoptera&quot;, &quot;Heteroptera Lepidoptera&quot;, diptera, crustaceans, myriapods and shellfish.

==Fires==

As the habitat consists of bogs, fire is a major hazard during the drought period, when the Fens are closed except for a small area near . Triangular signs painted in red are fixed at the fire hazard locations. In April 2011 in a fire that broke out in the High Fens of land were destroyed. It is said to be the biggest ever fire in the Fens and 300 firefighters supported by a helicopter were involved in dousing and controlling the fires.

==Activities==
The winter sports activities allowed in the Fens in specified area and outside conserved area of the fens are skiing, bicycling and trekking. Cross-country skiing in the High Fens is permitted on specified forest tracks which are located in the outskirts or even outside the nature reserve. Hiking trails have been reorganized outside the parks reserved areas. The walk routes would be limited to undergrowth adjacent to nature reserve. Bicycle routes have been specified outside the nature reserve in nearby forests. The subalpine climate may change to subarctic condition and hence when taking adventure walks in the night through the park it could be hazardous unless one is properly equipped for taking such a risk.

==Monument==
Another notable monument is at Gèyeté (Gayetay) within the municipal boundary of Sart and Jalhay; it is in memory of eight American airmen who were the crews of two Douglas C-47 Skytrains from 50th Troop Carrier Squadron that collided in flight on 6 April 1945 due to fog. The memorial consists of a three-bladed propeller erected on a quartzite pedestal, with a cross erected next to it with the inscription &quot;For the American airmen.&quot;

<text>The Money Lenders is a 1981 book on finance by British journalist Anthony Sampson. It looks at the history of banking from the Renaissance to a meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. in 1980, with an emphasis on the interaction of finance with international diplomacy.

The bank discusses the formative years of three Wall Street giants: The Chase Manhattan, Citibank and the Bank of America. The book then discusses the creation of Federal Reserve system in 1913, the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the successive years of the Great Depression.

The book was largely inspired by the work of the Brandt Commission on &quot;North–South relations.&quot; Mr. Sampson served as editorial advisor to the chairman, Willy Brandt, on that commission.

&quot;The Money Lenders&quot; begins with a vivid description of the scene in the lobby of the Sheraton Washington Hotel during that 1980 IMF meeting, which Sampson labels &quot;the most superior of all salesmen&#x27;s conventions.&quot;

<doc id="1316143" wikidata="Q4582222" url="?curid=1316143" title="1985 Brixton riot">
<text>The Brixton riot of 1985 started on 28 September in Lambeth in South London. It was the second major riot that the area had witnessed in the space of four years, the last in 1981. It was sparked by the shooting of Dorothy &quot;Cherry&quot; Groce by the Metropolitan Police, while they sought her 21-year-old son Michael Groce in relation to a robbery and suspected firearms offence; they believed Michael Groce was hiding in his mother&#x27;s home.

After two days of riots, photo-journalist David Hodge had died, 43 civilians and 10 police officers were hurt. Amongst a number of fires, one building had been destroyed, 55 cars had been burnt out, and 58 burglaries had been committed including acts of looting.

In March 2014, the police eventually apologised for the wrongful shooting of Mrs Groce. In July of the same year, an inquest jury concluded that eight separate police failures had contributed to Mrs Groce&#x27;s death, for which the then Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe subsequently &quot;apologised unreservedly for our failings&quot; to the family.

==Background==

Some of the community of Lambeth, after the 1981 Brixton riot, did not trust the Metropolitan Police, with many people, especially from African-Caribbean population, upset about the institutional racism of the police force.

Twenty-one-year-old Michael Groce was one of six children born to Dorothy &quot;Cherry&quot; Groce, who had migrated to the area from Jamaica when she was in her early teens. From aged six much of his life was spent in residential care, brought up in Tinworth House, on a rough housing estate in Vauxhall. Michael was involved with street gangs, and had been exposed to guns during his childhood. He spent time in and out of prison throughout his life, and by 1985 had accrued 50 convictions and 15 different spells in prison.

After being released from prison two months before, whilst out on licence Michael became concerned with a turf-war between local street gangs. Subsequently, given a gun for protection by a friend, a few days before the riots Michael was in an argument with his girlfriend at his mother&#x27;s house, and in a fit of anger fired the gun into a wardrobe. Shortly afterwards, he heard a knock on the door and went down to answer it, finding a police officer enquiring if he was Michael Groce. He attempted to close the door, but after the police officer would not let him, Michael put the gun into the officer&#x27;s mouth. After the officer left, Michael cleaned and stored the gun and then fled to his sister&#x27;s home.

==Raid on Cherry Groce&#x27;s house==
On the morning of Saturday 28 September 1985, a group of police officers raided Cherry Groce&#x27;s house on Normandy Road, Brixton, including an armed CID officer, searching for suspected armed robber Michael Groce. Mrs Groce was in bed, whilst three of her six children were in residence when the police entered the house with force. During the raid, Mrs Groce was shot and seriously injured; after an extensive search, the police did not find Michael Groce. An ambulance was called, and by the time it had arrived a small crowd had gathered outside the house. Mrs Groce was taken to St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in central London.

==Riots==
As word of the shooting spread throughout the community, rumours persisted that Mrs. Groce had in fact been killed in the raid. The group that had gathered outside her house grew to over 60, and then moved to the local district police station, where they began chanting &quot;murderers&quot; and anti-police slogans, demanding disciplinary action against the officers involved.

However, hostility between the largely black crowd and the largely white police force quickly escalated into a series of mild street battles. These then developed into elongated skirmishes in the areas of Brixton Road and Acre Lane, where the first two of a total of 55 cars over the following 48 hours were burnt out. In response the police deployed the first 50 officers in riot gear in the afternoon, who approached rioters whilst banging their truncheons on their riot shields. Through force which involved a number of reported unprovoked attacks on local passers-by and accredited members of the media, the police cordoned off the area around the police station on Brixton Road, and then cleared the surrounding shopping district.

That evening, the police lost control of the area for approximately 48 hours. In the subsequent riot, severe injuries were sustained by both sides, with police injured as they were attacked by young black and white youths equipped with bricks and wooden stakes. After further skirmishes, the rioters built a defensive wall out of upturned cars across the Brixton Road, which were set alight at various times. From behind this wall, the rioters threw petrol bombs at the police, and looted local shops. As darkness fell on Coldharbour Lane, groups of men gathered and were stopping cars, opening doors and seizing the keys, expelling their occupants and then setting the cars on fire. One furniture shop, spanning the junction of Gresham Road, Barrington Road and Coldharbour Lane, was set on fire. The fire rapidly spread to the residential flats on the higher levels of the 4-storey building, and it was only by singular good fortune and heroic action of residents in rescuing one elderly gentleman that all escaped without loss of life or serious injury. Police later stated that they made 149 arrests that evening, mostly for violence, 20 for burglary and theft and two for petrol bombing.

In the aftermath, photo-journalist David Hodge died a few days later as a result of an aneurysm, after being attacked by gang of looters he was trying to photograph. In total over 50 people were injured, 200 arrests were made, one building and dozens of cars were destroyed, and several shops had been looted.

In a press conference on 30 September, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Wells described the shooting of Mrs Groce as tragic, and whilst recognising the resultant &quot;genuine feelings, particularly those of the relatives and friends of Mrs Groce&quot;, blamed the riots on &quot;an unruly criminal element.&quot;

===Subsequent riots: Peckham, Toxteth and Tottenham===
On 30 September in Peckham, south London, black youths began throwing petrol bombs and setting shops alight. A major fire at a carpet warehouse off Peckham High Street was reported.

On 1 October 1985, 10 people (including three police officers) were injured in a second riot in Toxteth on 1 October 1985, after crowds stormed the district&#x27;s streets and stoned and burnt cars in response to the arrest of four local black men in connection with a stabbing. Merseyside Police Operational Support Division was deployed into the area to restore order and were later criticised by community leaders and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool, Derek Worlock, for their &quot;over zealous and provocative tactics&quot;, which included the drumming of batons on riot shields.

One week later, another serious conflict, sparked by similar circumstances, broke out between the Metropolitan Police and mainly black residents of North London&#x27;s Tottenham district in what became known as the Broadwater Farm riot.

==Aftermath==

===Cherry Groce===
On her arrival at hospital, surgeons found that the bullet had penetrated Mrs Groce&#x27;s lung and exited through her spine, paralysing her from the waist downwards. She was hospitalised for over a year, and in hospital-based rehabilitation for a further year; friends within the local community looked after her children. With Mrs Groce permanently paralysed and only able to get around in a wheelchair, and after further rehabilitation, she and her family were allocated a new bungalow in which to live.

The police officer who shot Mrs Groce, Detective Inspector Douglas Lovelock, was prosecuted but eventually acquitted of malicious wounding. Mrs Groce later received over £500,000 in compensation from the Metropolitan Police, but with no admission of liability.

In 2011, Mrs Groce contracted an infection which led to kidney failure. She was treated at King&#x27;s College Hospital, but she died on Easter Sunday, and was buried in May 2011.

In 2012 a blue plaque was installed at Cherry Groce&#x27;s former home at 22 Normandy Road.

====Inquest====
After the death of Cherry Groce, the district coroner announced that a judicial inquest was to be held into her death, scheduled for June 2014. Simon Israel reporting for Channel 4 News revealed on 21 March 2014 that separate pathologists working on behalf of both the family and the police, both independently concluded that there was a causal link between the shooting and the death of Mrs Groce.

With both the Metropolitan Police and former Inspector Douglas Lovelock both to be represented at the inquest by Queen&#x27;s Counsel, the Legal Aid Agency refused the Groce family funds on the grounds that &quot;there are no new issues.&quot; The family subsequently started a petition, and appealed directly to Prime Minister David Cameron for Legal Aid to support them at the inquest, supported by the Labour MP for Streatham, Chuka Umunna. The decision was subsequently overturned on 11 April 2014 by a ministerial discussion through the Ministry of Justice.

On 10 July 2014, the jury at Southwark Coroner&#x27;s Court returned a verdict that concluded that eight separate police failures had contributed to Mrs Groce&#x27;s death, and that her &quot;subsequent death was contributed to by failures in the planning and implementation of the raid&quot;. Pathologist Dr Robert Chapman testified that during his post-mortem examination he had found metal fragments from the bullet still lodged in the base of her spine, which had contributed to her being more susceptible to debilitating illnesses. The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe subsequently &quot;apologised unreservedly for our failings&quot; to the family for the years of suffering, stating that the Metropolitan Police operation had been inadequate, failed to carry out its responsibilities properly, and that it was &quot;inexcusable&quot; that it had taken so long for the police to acknowledge these failings.

===Michael Groce===

After three days of hiding, Michael learnt via the television news about the shooting of his mother and the riots. He quietly turned himself in to the police the following day, accompanied by solicitor Paul Boateng. Michael was then interviewed at Scotland Yard in relation to an armed robbery at a jeweller&#x27;s shop in Royston, Hertfordshire on 10 September, and later released on police bail. On 26 September, he was charged at Waterloo police station with illegal possession of a sawn-off shotgun, for which he subsequently received a three-year suspended sentence. He was never charged with any offence associated with the armed robbery or the riots.

Michael wrote his mother an apology in the form of a poem, subsequently published in &quot;The Voice&quot; newspaper. Michael attempted to help the community recover; he ran a youth football team, trying to provide a fun alternative to crime.

Today a reformed character, Michael is a published poet who runs poetry, personal development and motivational workshops in schools under the project title &quot;Cherry Blossoms&quot;, and gives talks to dissuade others from making mistakes similar to those that he made.

===Metropolitan Police Service===
Following the trial of Inspector Lovelock, a review of firearms procedures within the Metropolitan Police led to new policy which authorised only centrally-controlled specifically trained specialist squads to be armed. This included parts of Special Branch, but excluded others including CID officers.

In March 2014, almost 29 years after the events and almost three years after her death, the Metropolitan Police publicly apologised to Cherry Groce&#x27;s family for her wrongful shooting.

=== Redskins mascot ===

For more than 60 years, the Redskin name had been a part of the Lancaster Central School District. But on March 16, 2015, the Lancaster School Board voted to discontinue the use of the nickname &quot;Redskins&quot;. Starting in 2001, the U.S. Commission of Civil Rights advocated for non-Native American schools to avoid using images and references that could have a negative prejudice or bias against Native American people. With this, the Lancaster School District started to slowly phase out the Redskin name by doing things such as ordering uniform&#x27;s without any reference to the mascot name. The school district than announced it would make a decision in the 2017–2018 school year, but this came with opposition as some people wanted this timeline to be accelerated. During the school&#x27;s spring lacrosse season, the Akron, Niagara Wheatfield and Lake Shore school districts boycotted Lancaster lacrosse games due to a large amount of Native American athletes on each of their respective teams. Due to these actions, the Lancaster School Board decided to immediately make a decision regarding the district&#x27;s mascot name. In reaction to this decision to change Redskin name, there were some protests, including one by students of the Lancaster School District. About 10% of the student body of the Lancaster School District participated in a walkout in response of the name change on March 19, 2015. These protests weren&#x27;t successful as the district was dedicated to its decision. Although previously scheduled for May 27, on June 2 and 3 of 2015 the students of the Lancaster High School, Lancaster Middle School, and William Street School voted for the new mascot name. The students were given seven choices to vote on: the Lancaster Alphas, the Lancaster Dragons, the Lancaster Jaguars, the Lancaster Knights, the Lancaster Legends, the Lancaster Pride, and the Lancaster Red Hawks. With receiving 1,106 votes out of 3,072 total votes, it was announced on June 3 that the winning mascot name was the Lancaster Legends. The Legends logo was designed by an 8th grader named Korissa Gozdziak. To conclude this process, the Lancaster School Board finalized the new mascot name on June 8, 2015.

<text>Adenophora is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae, the bellflowers. Plants of this genus are known commonly as ladybells. Most of the species in the genus are native to eastern Asia, with a few in Europe. Many are endemic to either China or Siberia.

==Description==
These plants are perennial herbs, often with thick, fleshy roots. The stem usually grows erect from a caudex. There are usually several basal leaves borne on long petioles. The leaves on the stem are alternately arranged in most species. Flowers are solitary or borne in cymes. The corolla of the flower is bell-shaped, funnel-shaped, or tubular, with five lobes. The corollas of most species are blue. There is a characteristic nectar disc at the base of the stamens.

<text>RMC Group plc (formerly &quot;Ready Mixed Concrete Limited&quot;) was a ready mixed concrete, quarrying and concrete products company headquartered in Egham, United Kingdom. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, but was acquired by Cemex of Mexico in 2005.

==History==
The Company was founded in 1930 by the Danish civil engineer Kjeld Ammentorp as &quot;Ready Mixed Concrete Limited&quot; in Bedfont. In 1952, Ready Mixed Concrete of Australia reversed into its UK rival and began to expand. During 1962, the company was listed for the first time on the London Stock Exchange.

During 1979, the company created Thorpe Park in Staines, Surrey, via the redevelopment of one of its disused quarries as a leisure park once quarrying activity had been completed. Up until 1998, RMC Group operated Thorpe Park, at which point it was sold to The Tussauds Group, owner of Alton Towers and nearby Chessington World of Adventures.

Throughout the early 1990s, RMC Group, akin to its numerous domestic competitors, pursued expansion within the European market. In December 1990, it established a joint venture with Isle of Man Assurance to undertaken land purchases. During September 1995, it was announced that RMC Group would take full control of its German subsidiary via a £356 million transaction to buy the outstanding 36.4 per cent stake. One year later, the company entered into a unsuccessful bidding war for the Midlands-based aggregates firm Ennemix against the French industrial group Lafarge.

In early 1996, despite a downturn in demand (which was partially attributed to a decrease in road-related work), RMC Group successfully enacted a price rise. Around this time, as a result of recently introduced legislation, RMC Group (along with other British-based aggregates firms) was compelled to diversity into waste management and recycling activities. During 1997, the company reported strong financial results; it also mooted plans to launch a new concrete operation in India.

During August 1998, RMC Group sold its builders&#x27; merchant chain, Hall &amp; Co, to the building materials firm Wolseley in exchange for £121 million. The firm&#x27;s fiscal performance continued to be negatively impacted by a downturn in the German market during the latter half of 1998. During early 1999, RMC Group stated that it had held discussions towards the potential acquisition of Scancem AB, although the German firm Heidelberg Materials ultimately emerged as the victor.

In early 2000, the company completed the acquisition of one of its suppliers, the British cement producer Rugby Group, in exchange for £850 million. This acquisition was stated to achieve £30 million in savings every year. That same year, CEO Peter Young was replaced by Stuart Walker.

During 2005, RMC Group was acquired by Cemex of Mexico for £2.3 billion; the transaction created the third largest cement producer in the world, behind Lafarge and Holcim.

<text>Dingalan , officially the Municipality of Dingalan (; ), is a municipality in the province of Aurora, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 27,878 people.

Dingalan has several caves, of which the Lamao Caves are the best known. The rough shoreline and very high waves of Dingalan make it attractive to surfers. Dingalan is nicknamed &quot;Gateway to Southern Tagalog&quot; as it is bordered by Quezon Province (in the south), which is part of Southern Tagalog, of which Aurora was a part; Aurora was a sub-province of Quezon.

==History==

Early settlers recounted that Dumagat tribes inhabited the territory now known as Dingalan. The names of most landmarks and places in this municipality were said to have been given by the aborigines. It is believed that the name “Dingalan” is a Dumagat word which means “by the River of Galan” because the territory straddles fifteen (15) rivers and streams which show the abundance of water.

Another story is also believed that there were two Dumagat brothers named Ding and Allan who were hunting animals in the forest. They were shouting at each other’s name as they went astray away from each other hence the name DINGALAN.

In the early 1900s, settlers from Quezon, Nueva Ecija, and Ilocos started to migrate to Dingalan. They were generally lowland cultivators in search of arable land. In-migration heightened in the 1930s when Don Felipe Buencamino started his logging and sawmill operations. Soon after, inter-marriages among Tagalogs, Ilocanos, Pampangos (Kapampangans), and Bicolanos enriched the cultural stock of settlers.

During World War II, Dingalan was occupied by the Japanese imperial forces. The Japanese took over the operation of sawmills and cut timber to construct their barracks and garrisons. The Dingalan-Gabaldon highway was originally built (1942-1945) as a logging road. On the verge of defeat in 1945, the Japanese used Dingalan Bay as an “exit point” when they retreated.

The strategic location of Dingalan Bay for military purposes was rediscovered after the RP-US Mutual Defense Treaty of 1951, when the municipality became the Training Ground in 1957 for the South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) as well as the United States Seventh Fleet. Dingalan also became a site of the RP-US Balikatan Military Exercises for three (3) consecutive years from 1982-1984.

Dingalan was recognized as a municipal district on June 16, 1956 under Republic Act 1536 with an initial population of 2,000 residents. Prior to that, Dingalan was merely a sitio of Barrio San Luis, Municipality of Baler, Tayabas (now Quezon) Province. Dingalan became a regular municipality on June 16, 1962 by virtue of Republic Act No. 3490.

From the 1930s to 1990s, logging was the main driver of Dingalan’s economy and the principal magnet to migrants. In the 1970s, three logging companies operated in Dingalan namely; Dingalan Wood Industries Corporation (DWICO), South Eastern Timber Corporation (SETIC) of Mr. Roberto Gopuansoy, and Inter-Pacific Forest Resources Company. They obtained a combined allowable cut of 169,416 cubic meters of lumber per annum, roughly equivalent to 4,500 fully loaded ten-wheeler trucks each year.

Because of relentless logging between 1930 and 1995, Dingalan today has only 2% of its original old growth dipterocarp forest. More than 10% of the area is denuded or devoid of trees. Its rate of deforestation is faster than the country’s average of 1.4% per year. The brownish color of Dingalan’s river channels reveals the extent of soil erosion and siltation resulting from the loss of adequate tree cover upstream.

==Geography==
According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the municipality has a land area of , constituting of the total area of Aurora.

Dingalan is from Manila and from Baler. It is bounded on the north by San Luis, west by Gabaldon, General Tinio, and Doña Remedios Trinidad, south by General Nakar, and east by the Benham Rise or Plateau and Philippine Sea.

It is a small town with one main cemented road with branching alleys. Further south of the town proper are the barangays of Aplaya, Butas na Bato, Matawe, Ibona, Dikapanikian and Umiray. The premier barangay north of the town is Paltic. All of the barangays are located on the seashore, except for Poblacion and two barangays located in the mountains. The whole town is mountainous due to the Sierra Madre. The Umiray River separates the town from Quezon Province.

The National Government has an ongoing move to transfer Municipality of Dingalan to become part of Nueva Ecija Province for the reason that the said municipality is geographically and strategically within the said Province. This was favored by most of the residents was opposed by the Provincial Government of Aurora. One reason is that you must travel via the province of Nueva Ecija before reaching the province of Aurora, which is especially difficult during disasters. It is more economical and practical to deliver Dingalan to the province of Nueva Ecija.

===Barangays===
Dingalan is politically subdivided into 11 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

<doc id="1316173" wikidata="Q838962" url="?curid=1316173" title="Agile gibbon">
<text>The agile gibbon (Hylobates agilis), also called the black-handed gibbon, is an Old World primate, and is a part of the gibbon family. It is native to Indonesia, specifically, on the island of Sumatra. The agile gibbon can also be found in Malaysia, and southern Thailand. As appointed by the IUCN Red List, this species is endangered, and mainly due to the destruction of their habitat and pet trade.

==Taxonomy==
The species is generally thought not to have subspecies, but some experts recognise a mountain form and a lowland form.
* Mountain agile gibbon, &quot;Hylobates agilis agilis&quot;
* Lowland agile gibbon, &quot;Hylobates agilis unko&quot;

==Description==
The agile gibbon has fur varying in color from black to red-brown. The brow is white, and the male can be recognized by his white or light-grey cheeks. Additionally, the male is slightly larger than the female. The agile gibbon weighs from with an average of , though in captivity it can reach . It has a head and body length of . Like all gibbons, it is tailless.

==Behaviour==
With its long arms they swing on branches, brachiating at a fast pace. Like all gibbons, it lives in monogamous pairs in a strictly enforced territory, which is defended with vigorous visual displays and songs. The diet of the agile gibbon is generally frugivorous but have also been observed eating leaves, flowers, and insects.

Females give birth to a single offspring after seven months&#x27; gestation. The young gibbon is weaned at barely 2 years of age. When fully mature, at about 8 years, it leaves its family group in order to look for a mate.

==Distribution and habitat==
The agile gibbon is found on Sumatra southeast of Lake Toba and the Singkil River, in a small area on the Malay Peninsula, and south Thailand near the Malaysian border. It predominantly lives arboreally in rain forests and rarely comes to the ground.

<doc id="1316189" wikidata="Q157361" url="?curid=1316189" title="Androsace">
<text>Androsace, commonly known as rock jasmine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae, second only to &quot;Primula&quot; in the number of species. It is predominantly Arctic–alpine, with many species in the Himalayas (where the genus originated), the mountains of central Asia, the Caucasus, and the southern and central European mountain systems, particularly the Alps and the Pyrenees.

Plants of this genus are sometimes known as rock jasmines or fairy candelabras, and are widely cultivated for their dense cushions covered in white or pink flowers. There are roughly 110 species.

These plants have small entire or toothed leaves which form a basal rosette.

==Taxonomy==
Recent molecular studies show that the genera &quot;Douglasia&quot; (found in north-western North America and easternmost Siberia), &quot;Pomatosace&quot; (an Himalayan endemic) and &quot;Vitaliana&quot; (a European endemic) are nested within &quot;Androsace&quot;. Phylogenetic studies have also demonstrated that the ancestor of &quot;Androsace&quot; first appeared about 35 Mya ago and was most probably an annual species.

=== New species described in 2021 ===
A group of scientist disentangled the morphology and ecology of &quot;Androsace&quot; genius in the French Alps and described three new species in 2021:

* &quot;Androsace vesulensis&quot; in the &quot;A. alpina&quot; group, endemic of the Mont Viso.
* &quot;Androsace saussurei&quot; and &quot;A. delphinensis&quot; in the &quot;A. pubescens&quot; group, which grow on siliceous substrate and are endemic to Mont Blanc and Central Alps respectively.

==Cultivation==
The following species have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. All are mat-forming evergreen perennials.
*&quot;A. lanuginosa&quot; (woolly rock jasmine) - lilac pink
*&quot;A. sempervivoides&quot; (sempervivum-leaved rock jasmine) - mauve pink
*&quot;A. studiosorum&quot; (rock jasmine) - deep pink

<text>Robert Storm Petersen (19 September 1882 – 6 March 1949) was a Danish cartoonist, writer, animator, illustrator, painter and humorist. He is known almost exclusively by his pen name Storm P. 

==Biography==
He was the son of a butcher and grew up in Copenhagen in a lower middle class environment. After interrupted studies at the Academy of Art, he worked as a free-lance painter, illustrator and cabaret entertainer. Already during World War I he was a well-known artist, and from about 1920 onward he was almost a national &quot;institution&quot; as a humorist, partly because of his versatile interests. His first comic strip was printed in 1906, in the Danish tabloid &quot;Ekstra Bladet&quot;. He was for many years connected to the Copenhagen newspaper &quot;Berlingske Tidende&quot; as a comic writer and cartoonist.

As a humorist, Storm P. is related to British and American humor, with a strong touch of craziness and absurdity. Often his starting point is a plain Copenhagen jargon, combined with a Danish down-to-earth homespun philosophy and all kinds of fun and comedy; the common man&#x27;s unimpressed comments on a crazy world.

Though normally loved by most of his countrymen, Storm P. has also been criticised for being too toothless and petit bourgeois. In spite of his social background and interest of poor milieus, he very seldom shows deeper social criticism or revolutionary opinions; the dramatic age in which he lived left rather small stamps on his work. On the other hand he was no staunch giggler; many of his paintings deal with death, sorrow and macabre themes. He painted the victims of social injustice and misery, often with a strong touch of compassion. Melancholy and fear are not unknown to him, but his official appearance was optimistic.

==Drawings and paintings==
Petersen left about 60,000 drawings and 100 paintings of varied quality. His drawings are very often illustrated jokes, or series of a theme besides artist sketches. Among his favourite themes are the vagabonds – who are portrayed as dressed-up petty philosophers – and the circus milieu that he regarded with much warmth.

He is perhaps best known for his Storm P. machines, comic drawings of machines that perform very simple tasks through an unnecessarily complex and usually humorous series of actions. Other cartoonists who are known for similar machine drawings are Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson. Besides that, he illustrated many books, often written by congenial authors – Mark Twain, Jerome K. Jerome and G. K. Chesterton, among others.

As a painter he is clearly influenced by names like Edvard Munch and Toulouse-Lautrec, but often with an independent naivist touch. Later on, Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky seem to have been an inspiration in spite of his often outspoken ridiculing of modern art. Among his many themes are &quot;extérieurs&quot; from Paris. &quot;La Morgue&quot; (1906) and &quot;Kultur&quot; (1908) are two of his most well known paintings.

==Author==
As an author, he wrote many short stories and tales, often parodies on detective stories or melodramas, small snap-shots from the Copenhagen lower middle class milieu, absurd and surrealistic tales or, especially, &quot;monologues&quot; put into the mouth of bums, artists, etc. Special kinds of tales were the monologues put into the mouth of his own dog, &quot;Vor ven Grog&quot; (1926–1935), in which he let the dog reflect on life, death and daily life, sometimes with a light touch of sadness and pity within the humour.

==Comics==
Storm P. is also well known in Denmark as the author of a number of comic strips (titles in Danish):

* &quot;De tre små mænd og nummermanden&quot; (&quot;The Three Small Men and the Number Man&quot;) 1913–1923 is a play with situations: three little men making mad pranks leading to success or failure, all accompanied by an even smaller man who delivers the numbers of the strip.

*&quot;En underlig Mand&quot; (&quot;A Strange Man&quot;) from the 1930s was an absurdist strip cartoon about a man who reacts illogically and solves problems in an unexpected way.

* &quot;Peter og Ping&quot; (&quot;Peter and Ping&quot;), 1922–1949 was his greatest success, a comic strip about a small citizen and his friend (or adopted son) Ping, a speaking penguin. Their experiences in Copenhagen, spiced by Ping&#x27;s absurd expressions and jokes, were extremely popular and even led to the foundation of a Ping Club for children. It also caused some international attention and was sold to Great Britain.

* &quot;Dagens flue &quot;(&quot;The Daily Fly&quot;) that started in 1939 were drawings illustrating humorous philosophical jokes which often contained a deeper meaning.

==Theater work==
Storm P. was also an occasional freelance actor and performed in several early Danish silent movies. He later acted in stage comedies to supplement his income. In 1920 Petersen created the first Danish animated cartoon titled &quot;Tre små mænd&quot; (&quot;Three Small Men&quot;). He also designed scenery for ballets and plays.

==Tribute==
*In 1982 he was featured on a Danish Postal stamp.
*On 19 September 2013, Google celebrated his 131st birthday with a Google Doodle in Denmark.

==Revymuseet==
Storm P. Museum now Revymuseet is located at Frederiksberg. Storm P. Museum first opened its doors to the public in 1977.
The museum building is housed in a former police station which dates back to the mid-1880s. The museum features expressionistic watercolors and oil painting together with a comic strip library, sound clips, photographs, films and newspaper clippings. The museum also hosts a variety of changing exhibitions and educational activities.
==Quotes==

* &quot;Life is a circus: you go in, bow, run around, bow again and leave.&quot;
* &quot;– What is your opinion of the world situation? – Nothing, something got in my eye.&quot;
* &quot;There is something fishy about art that needs to be explained.&quot;
* &quot;We human beings are strange creatures – we have to go underground because we have invented the aeroplane. (1939)&quot;
* &quot;Statistics is much like a streetlight. Not very enlightening, but nice for supporting you&quot;
* &quot;&quot;I&#x27;d like to buy a return ticket, please&quot; – &quot;to where?&quot; – &quot;here!&quot;&quot;
* &quot;It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future,&quot; (this phrase is also sometimes, mistakenly, attributed to Yogi Berra).

== Location ==

Tsing Yi station is located in the northeastern quarter of the island of the same name, slightly to the west of Kowloon and mainland Hong Kong. To the west is Tsing Yi Town Park, while the Tsing Yi Sports Ground lies to the south. Otherwise, much of the area is residential with a number of educational establishments nearby.

=== Transit-oriented development ===

As with other MTR stations, Tsing Yi is a prime site for transit-oriented development by the MTR Corporation, whose properties division develops land above and in the vicinity of its stations. Owing to its ideal location between Kowloon and Lantau Island, MTR Properties has heavily invested in commercial and residential development around Tsing Yi, the most prominent of this investment being Maritime Square, a large shopping centre extending from the station, and the residential estate Tierra Verde, which lies on top of the station. Maritime Square contains of retail space, while the Tierra Verde complex comprises twelve residential towers and a total of 3,500 flats.

== Morning Express service ==

The MTR offers Morning Express services to allow passengers to take the Airport Express from Tsing Yi to Kowloon or Hong Kong station. Commuters wishing to get to work faster can use their Octopus card at dedicated gates for HK$25. This offer is available every day except Sundays and public holidays from 7 am to 10 am.

== Station layout ==

The station has four stories above ground level. The ground floor has a taxi stand outside and has access to the concourse on the first floor. The concourse is integrated with the Maritime Square shopping centre. The second floor houses the Tung Chung line platform for trains heading for Hong Kong station, and the third floor houses the Tung Chung line platform for services towards Tung Chung station. At the Airport Express departure and arrival platforms, there is a free WiFi hotspot available. Unlike at Kowloon and Hong Kong stations, in-town check-in facilities and free Airport Express shuttle buses are not available at this station.

As with other Airport Express stations, the Airport Express and Tung Chung line are separated with a different paid area for the Airport Express, thus passengers changing between two lines must go downstairs and past through floor U1, and then go upstairs again. In Tsing Yi station, the 4 platforms are constructed in a stacked arrangement, with platforms 1 and 3 above platforms 2 and 4. Platform 2 is only used to allow passengers coming from Hong Kong International Airport or to disembark, except between 7 am and 10 am on Mondays to Saturdays, when Morning Express services are available. Platform 2 has a different font (Bahnschrift) for the livery.
