==History==
===Legend===

In the research work &quot;Guinobatan Through the Times,&quot; the following version of the legend is stated:
* In a region on Mayon&#x27;s slopes lay a village. It was dotted with huts whose roofs were made of &quot;nipa&quot;, as well as with a number of stone houses. In the village was a church, and inside the belfry was a Golden Bell. So great was the bell that when rung, the sound could be heard from miles away. The sound could even reach the land of the Moros. The Moros, made curious by the sound of the bell, sent spies so that they would know what kind of bell was producing so loud and peculiar a sound. The spies were amazed and surprised to find out that the townspeople rang was made of pure gold. They went back to the land of the Moros eager to report their findings to their superiors. Motivated by greed, the Moros assembled a squad to plunder the bell. When they arrived at the village, they pillaged the community and torched houses. They attempted to force the people to tell them where the Golden Bell was. Their attempts failed. Many were still able to flee. The fleeing townsfolk knew where the bell was, and they hid the bell underneath the roots of trees. However, an old man was left in the village. As he was the only person left in the town; Moros tortured him so that he would tell the raiders where the Golden Bell was. The old man, however, did not know. Finding no use for the old man, the Moros killed him. They tried to pursue the townspeople, but they were too far away to be captured. Instead, they went to the woods in search of the Golden Bell. They uprooted every tree underneath which they believed the Golden Bell was hidden. Their efforts proved futile. Hence, with empty hands the Moros went back to their land, while the townspeople went back to the village to rebuild their lives, which had always been under threat from Moro pillagers and natural calamities; from bad harvests and oppressive &quot;encomienderos&quot;. The townspeople also kept the valued Golden Bell safe from anyone who tried to steal it. Seeing the uprooted trees, the townsfolk named their area “Guinobatan” meaning “a place where trees were uprooted.” So ends the legend.

Some versions also state that the town&#x27;s name is derived from &quot;Ginabutan&quot;, meaning &quot;a place where trees or plants were uprooted.&quot;

===History under foreign rule===
Luis Née, a botanist, reached Bicol in January 1792, accompanying the expedition of Capt. Alejandro Malaspina. Née explored towns near Mayon and including the area now known as Guinobatan. He noted that &quot;trees grew in exuberance making the foothills impenetrable in many parts.&quot;

Dr. Leonilo RC. Palacio of Guinobatan&#x27;s Republic Colleges mentioned in an essay entitled &quot;Guinobatan and its Church&quot; that &quot;in 1672, the Parish of Guinobatan was already mentioned in books as a &quot;visita&quot; of the Municipality of Camalig.&quot;

In 1890, the title of the &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; was changed to &quot;Capitan Municipal&quot;. The Municipal Law of 1894 guaranteed that the term of the local executive would be extended from two years to four years. Also among the salient provisions of the law was the election of 12 &quot;vocale&quot;s, equivalent to today&#x27;s councilors. In 1895, the Colegio de San Buenaventura was also built, making Guinobatan the centre for higher education in Albay.

&quot;Cabeza&quot;s and &quot;principale&quot;s elected the &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; until 1863. Until 1847, Guinobatan belonged to Camarines. During the said year, the towns of Quipia, Camalig and Donsol (now in Sorsogon) were ceded to Albay, in exchange for the towns of the Partido de Lagonoy. From 1730 to 1818, the town transferred from one place to another. In 1730, it was on a site now called Binanuahan. From there, it was the relocated to Bubulusan. During the eruption of 1814, citizens opted to evacuate to higher ground, in Mauraro.

===American colonization===
During the Philippine Revolution and the Philippine–American War (1898-1911), most of the schoolhouses built by the Spaniards were destroyed by constant artillery fire, most of which came from the Americans. As part of the &quot;pacification&quot; campaign of the Americans, engineers and architects were sent to the Philippines to oversee the construction of public works. Engr. Edward K. Bourne and famed urban planner Daniel Burnham, among other American architects and engineers, were instructed to go to Manila. In response, the Philippine Commission passed &quot;Act No. 268&quot; which created the Bureau of Architecture and Construction of Public Buildings. Mr. Bourne was appointed as its head. In 1907, the Philippine Assembly was formed. Angel Roco of Mauraro, Guinobatan represented Albay in the Assembly. The same year, Assemblyman Isauro Gabaldon of Nueva Ecija authored an act which appropriated million between 1907 and 1915 for &quot;construction of schoolhouses of strong materials in barrios with guaranteed daily attendance of not less than sixty pupils…&quot; Passing into law as &quot;Act No. 1801&quot;, the act became known as the &quot;Gabaldon Act&quot;. Among the salient provisions was that no school could receive more than unless the municipality to which the school belonged contributed at least 50% of the total amount granted to the school by the Gabaldon Act. The Gabaldon Act stipulated that only on land owned by the municipality could schools be constructed. Fifty-one &quot;Gabaldons&quot; were completed by 1911, and by 1916, four hundred five more were constructed. Among those completed between 1911 and 1916 was Guinobatan Central School blg. 1 or the Guinobatan East Central School&#x27;s Gabaldon Building.

Potenciano Gregorio&#x27;s Bikol language musical composition &quot;Sarung Banggi&quot; premiered at the town fiesta in Guinobatan in August 1910.

<doc id="1325720" wikidata="Q1399488" url="?curid=1325720" title="Thomas J. Walsh">
<text>Thomas James Walsh (June 12, 1859March 2, 1933) was an American lawyer and Democratic Party politician from Helena, Montana who represented Montana in the US Senate from 1913 to 1933. He was initially elected by the state legislature, and from 1918 on by popular vote, in keeping with the requirements of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Walsh had a national reputation as a liberal. He died before he could serve President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt, who chose him as his Attorney General.

==Background==
Walsh was born in Two Rivers, Wisconsin on June 12, 1859, the son of Irish Catholic immigrants, Bridget (Comer) and Felix Walsh; his father was an active Democrat and was elected as a member of the local school board.

Walsh taught school while attending the University of Wisconsin Law School. He graduated in 1884 and was admitted to the bar. He moved to Redfield, Dakota Territory to practice law. In August 1889, he married Elinor McClements (1859–1917). They had a daughter, Genevieve, born in 1890.

Moving to the state capital of Helena, Montana in 1890, Walsh established a law practice that specialized in personal injury cases and cases involving water rights and copper mining.

==Career==
Walsh became a leader in Democratic Party politics in Helena and attended numerous local, county and state conventions as a delegate. He was defeated in a 1906 election for the United States House of Representatives and a 1910 race for the U.S. Senate. Walsh was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1908, 1912, 1916, 1920, 1924, 1928, and 1932. He was the permanent chairman of the 1928 and 1932 conventions.

In 1912, Walsh won a state legislative election for U.S. Senate. He was repeatedly re-elected, and served from 1913 until his death in 1933. He emerged as a spokesman for President Woodrow Wilson in the Senate and supported the graduated income tax, farm loans, and women&#x27;s suffrage.

Walsh managed Wilson&#x27;s western campaign against Charles Evans Hughes during the 1916 presidential election, and was credited with helping Wilson win a narrow re-election victory. Unlike many Irish Catholics, who did not want the United States to ally with the United Kingdom, Walsh supported Wilson&#x27;s foreign policy and voted for war against Germany in 1917. In 1919, he supported Wilson&#x27;s peace plans and the League of Nations.

Walsh ran for re-election in 1918. In a three-way election that included him, former State Representative Oscar M. Lanstrum as the Republican nominee, and US Representative Jeannette Rankin as the National Party nominee, Walsh narrowly won a second term.

In his re-election in 1924, he defeated Republican Frank Bird Linderman by a solid margin. In 1930, Walsh ran for re-election and defeated Albert J. Galen in a landslide.

During his tenure in the Senate, Walsh gained fame for his legal ability in the Judiciary Committee and speaking ability on the floor.

In the 1920s, Walsh headed the Senate investigation into the Teapot Dome scandal that involved top officials of the administration of President Warren G. Harding. He was chairman of the Democratic National Convention in New York in 1924 and in Chicago in 1932. Walsh opposed child labor and supported women&#x27;s suffrage and, unlike most other Catholics, Prohibition. On December 18, 1927 Senator Walsh introduced a plan to investigate the country&#x27;s electric industry. The investigation done by the Federal Trade Commission would continue through 1935 and eventually result in four of the most important laws governing the electric industry in the 20th century including the breakup of most of the large holding companies that formed during the 1920s.

In 1933, Walsh was nominated for Attorney General by incoming President Franklin Roosevelt. In late February, he secretly married wealthy Cuban widow Mina Nieves Perez Chaumont de Truffin in Havana, Cuba. Less than a week later, he died while &quot;en route&quot; by train to Washington for Roosevelt&#x27;s inauguration, allegedly poisoned by his new wife.

His funeral service was held in the Chamber of the United States Senate, and he was interred at Resurrection Cemetery in Helena.

<text>Martin van Drunen (born 1966) is a Dutch death metal vocalist who started out in the band Pestilence. In this band, he also performed the bass duties live. He recorded two albums with them, &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; and &quot;Consuming Impulse&quot;. After his departure from Pestilence, van Drunen joined Asphyx as the singer and bass player in 1990 (in 1992, he would abandon his position as bass player to focus solely on vocals) and recorded six studio albums in total. He performed the vocals on Comecon&#x27;s second album &quot;Converging Conspiracies&quot; in 1993 and then formed his own band called Submission. In 1995, he was asked to replace Karl Willetts in the UK death metal band Bolt Thrower. He did two tours with them, but never recorded an album.

In 2006, an &quot;all-star&quot; death metal band by the name Hail of Bullets was formed with van Drunen doing vocals, ex-Houwitser bass player Theo van Eekelen, Gorefest drummer Ed Warby and both Thanatos guitarists Paul Baayens and Stephan Gebédi. In May 2008, they released an album called &quot;…Of Frost and War&quot;. In 2009, van Drunen performed guest vocals on The Project Hate MCMXCIX&#x27;s album &quot;The Lustrate Process&quot;. In October 2010, Hail of Bullets released their second album &quot;On Divine Winds&quot;.

<doc id="1325728" wikidata="Q7874971" url="?curid=1325728" title="USS Undine (1863)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Undine&quot; was a &quot;tinclad&quot; steamer in the United States Navy in 1864, during the American Civil War. She was captured on 30 October and put in service with the Confederates, but was not renamed before being burned, 5 days later, to prevent re-capture.

&quot;Undine&quot; was built in 1863 at Cincinnati, Ohio, as &quot;Ben Gaylord&quot;. She was purchased by the Navy at Cincinnati on 7 March 1864 and commissioned there in April.

==Civil War operations==
&quot;Undine&quot; joined the Mississippi Squadron and, in May 1864, was deployed in the Mississippi River between Fort Adams and Natchez, Mississippi. She soon left the Mississippi and operated during early July in the Tennessee River in support of Union forces ashore. While standing off Clifton, Tennessee, &quot;Undine&quot;, Acting Master John L. Bryant in command, struck a snag and partially sank on 25 July. Her crew was able to transfer the ship&#x27;s guns ashore to defend Clifton from Confederate attack before taking measures to raise the vessel. &quot;Undine&quot; was successfully refloated on 1 August after the arrival of the pump steamer &quot;Little Champion&quot; on 31 July.

&quot;Undine&quot;, , and transports &quot;City of Pekin&quot;, &quot;Kenton&quot;, and &quot;Aurora&quot; left Clifton on 9 October on an expedition to capture Eastport, Mississippi. This operation was launched to prevent cavalry forces under Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest from crossing the Tennessee River at Eastport and to provide an outpost against an expected advance of General Hood. However, the Union force was ambushed by shore batteries on 10 October as it landed troops near Eastport. After a heated, 30-minute exchange with the batteries, &quot;Undine&quot; and &quot;Key West&quot; evacuated troops caught ashore in the withering crossfire and escorted the disabled transports back downstream. The battered expedition returned to Paducah, Kentucky, at sundown on 12 October.

After repairs were completed, &quot;Undine&quot; resumed patrol and reconnaissance duty along the Tennessee River. On 30 October, she convoyed the transport &quot;Anna&quot; from Johnsonville, Tennessee, to Sandy Island. While returning to Johnsonville, Acting Master Bryant heard artillery reports coming from the river below Sandy Island and ordered &quot;Undine&quot; turned about to investigate. Near Paris Landing, &quot;Undine&quot; was again ambushed. Transports &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Cheeseman&quot; soon joined her and engaged the Confederates. Three hours later, both transports were disabled, and &quot;Undine&quot; was out of ammunition and crippled by a broken engine. Bryant hauled down his flag and surrendered &quot;Undine&quot;, &quot;Venus&quot;, and &quot;Cheeseman&quot;. He was later exonerated by a board of inquiry.

The Confederates wasted little time putting the captured Union vessels to use. While patrolling the Tennessee River on 2 November, &quot;Key West&quot; and engaged &quot;Undine&quot; and &quot;Venus&quot;. &quot;Venus&quot; was retaken, but &quot;Undine&quot; escaped, badly damaged, to the protection of Confederate batteries at Reynoldsburg Island. There, she was burned by the Confederates on 4 November to prevent her recapture by Union gunboats attacking the island.

==Post Civil War==
After the Civil War, the hulk of &quot;Undine&quot; was one of several in the Tennessee River ordered raised or wrecked on 20 June 1865. Two 24 pounder howitzers were recovered from the vessel later that month.

In 2000, a group called &quot;Raise the Gunboats&quot; in Benton County, Tennessee attempted to salvage the remaining portions of the &quot;Undine&quot;. The group has had mixed success, with some artifacts from the gunboat recovered as well as a derrick boat from the turn of the century.

<doc id="1325729" wikidata="Q1086823" url="?curid=1325729" title="Christopher Lawford">
<text>Christopher Kennedy Lawford (March 29, 1955 – September 4, 2018) was an American author, actor, and activist. He was a member of the prominent Kennedy family, and son of English actor Peter Lawford and Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Kennedy Lawford, who was a sister of President John F. Kennedy. He graduated from Tufts University in 1977 and earned a Juris Doctor degree from Boston College in 1983. He later earned a master&#x27;s certificate in Clinical Psychology from Harvard University and was a lecturer on drug addiction.

After struggling with addiction for 17 years, he became an actor, performing in several movies and television shows for over 20 years. He wrote several books, based on his own experience, about addiction and recovery. He also traveled around the U.S. speaking about his experiences with addiction for 20 years, and was a public health campaigner, working with organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN), and for the U.S. federal government.

==Early life and education==
Lawford was born on March 29, 1955, in Santa Monica, California. He was named for Saint Christopher and because his mother liked the name. He was the eldest child and only son of actor and &quot;Rat Pack&quot; member Peter Lawford (1923–1984) and Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Kennedy Lawford (1924–2006), who was President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s sister. His three younger sisters were Sydney Lawford McKelvy (born 1956), Victoria Pender (born 1958), and Robin Lawford (born 1961). Lawford described himself as a &quot;second-string Kennedy&quot; because he did not get as much attention as his cousins. His parents divorced in 1966; Patricia Lawford moved from California to New York City with her son and daughters.

Before his parents&#x27; divorce, Lawford attended St. Martin of Tours Elementary School in Los Angeles, where at the age of 8, he was informed about his uncle John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. After moving to New York City with his mother, he attended the Middlesex School, a prep school in Concord, Massachusetts. He graduated from Tufts University in 1977 and earned a J.D. degree from Boston College Law School in 1983. He failed the Massachusetts bar exam. He later earned a master&#x27;s certificate in Clinical Psychology from Harvard University, and lectured on drug addiction at Harvard, Columbia University, and other colleges.

===Drug and legal issues===

In 1969, the year after his uncle Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated, when Lawford was 14, he was introduced to LSD by his peers at school. He was addicted to alcohol, cocaine, uppers, downers, and &quot;any other drugs he could buy&quot; for the next 17 years. During that time, he was &quot;in and out of hospitals and arrested three times&quot;, including in 1980, for impersonating a doctor in Aspen, Colorado in order to purchase prescription medication. The charges were later dropped when Lawford completed his probation. In 2000, Lawford was diagnosed with hepatitis C, which he contracted due to his years of drug use.

Lawford briefly attended Fordham Law School, but dropped out after a few months due to his dependency on heroin. In April 1984, the same year his father Peter Lawford died at the age of 61, after years of alcohol and drug abuse, Lawford&#x27;s cousin and best friend David Kennedy, and third oldest son of Robert Kennedy, who also battled substance abuse issues, died of a drug overdose at the age of 28. David&#x27;s death prompted Lawford to seek professional help for his issues. In 1986, at the age of 30, Lawford entered rehab and got treatment for his drug addiction. Lawford remained clean and sober until his death in 2018.

==Career==
===Acting===

Lawford chose to become, like his father, an actor in the mid-1980s, after realizing that a law career would not suit him. He performed in commercials in Boston for two years, and then he and his wife moved to Southern California in 1988 so that he could pursue an acting career. He worked in film and television for over 20 years. His acting credits included the sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot; and the drama &quot;The O.C.&quot; . In 2003, he had a brief stint on the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;, but was best known for playing Philip &quot;Charlie&quot; Brent, Jr. on &quot;All My Children&quot; from 1992 to 1995.

===Writing===
Lawford wrote several books &quot;that described his efforts to recover from drug addiction&quot;. In 2005, he published his memoir, &quot;Symptoms of Withdrawal&quot;, in which he recounted decades of &quot;better living through chemistry&quot;. In 2009, he wrote &quot;Moments of Clarity&quot;, a compilation of first-person recollections by famous addicts, including Ed Begley, Jr., Alec Baldwin, Buzz Aldrin, Richard Dreyfuss, Martin Sheen, Judy Collins, and musician and federal prisoner Dejuan Verrett. The book was dedicated to Lawford&#x27;s cousin David Kennedy, and another cousin, Patrick J. Kennedy, wrote the introduction. Lawford told interviewer Connie Martinson that although writing &quot;Moments of Clarity&quot; was &quot;difficult&quot; and he did not want to do it, the book was &quot;meant to happen&quot;.

In 2013, Lawford published &quot;Recover to Live: Kick Any Habit, Manage Any Addiction&quot;, in which he interviewed 100 addiction specialists and described treatments for alcohol and drug dependence, gambling, sex and porn, eating disorders, smoking, and hoarding. In 2014, he published &quot;What Addicts Know: 10 Lessons From Recovery To Benefit Everyone&quot;; Dr. Drew Pinsky wrote the foreword. Lawford&#x27;s final book about addiction and recovery was 2016&#x27;s &quot;When Your Partner Has an Addiction&quot;, &quot;a how-to manual for people who want to stay with their addicted partners&quot;, which he co-authored with psychotherapist Beverly Engel.

Lawford also wrote a book about dealing with hepatitis C, called &quot;Healing Hepatitis C&quot;, which he co-wrote with Diana Sylvestre in 2009.

===Activism===
Lawford traveled around the U.S. speaking about his experiences with addiction for 20 years. He was a public health campaigner, and worked with the World Health Organization (WHO), the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, and the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, and was a public advocacy consultant to Caron Treatment Centers, an organization that ran treatment programs. In 2001, Lawford founded and was CEO of the Global Recovery Initiative, a not-for-profit organization that &quot;seeks to remove barriers and provide opportunities for people in recovery&quot;.

Lawford also worked with the United Nations (UN). In March 2010, he traveled to Ukraine on behalf of the UN, to participate in a discussion with health officials and advocates about &quot;issues related to hepatitis C (Hep C) prevention in Ukraine&quot;, and to raise awareness. In 2011, was named a Goodwill Ambassador on Drug Dependence Treatment and Care, in 2012, was involved in a campaign against opiate use in Afghanistan, and served on the UN&#x27;s Office on Drugs and Crime. His cousin, former Rhode Island congressman Patrick J. Kennedy, said about Lawford: &quot;Chris was one of those people who had a way of telling stories that lifted people&#x27;s perceptions and judgments of those who suffer from the disease of addiction&quot;.

==Personal life==
Lawford was romantically linked to Elizabeth Taylor in 1973. He married and divorced three times. From 1984 to 2001, he was married to Jeannie Olsson, an ad-sales assistant for &quot;New York Magazine&quot;. They had three children, David Christopher Kennedy Lawford (named after his cousin David Kennedy), Savannah Rose Lawford, and Matthew Peter Valentine Lawford..

==Death==

On September 4, 2018, after experiencing a medical emergency while at a yoga studio, Lawford died of a heart attack in Vancouver, British Columbia. At the time, he had been living with his girlfriend in Vancouver where he was working toward opening a recovery center. Patrick Kennedy told the Associated Press that Lawford had been doing &quot;hot yoga, which he did often, but the strain of it &#x27;must have been too much for him at that point&#x27;&quot;. Lawford&#x27;s cousins Maria Shriver, Patrick Kennedy, and Kerry Kennedy took to Twitter after his death, honoring Lawford&#x27;s work in addiction recovery.

<doc id="1325731" wikidata="Q78189229" url="?curid=1325731" title="Observance of Christmas by country">
<text>The observance of Christmas around the world varies by country. The day of Christmas, and in some cases the day before and the day after, are recognized by many national governments and cultures worldwide, including in areas where Christianity is a minority religion which are usually found in Africa and Asia. In some non-Christian areas, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. Hong Kong); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday.

Christmas traditions for many nations include the installing and lighting of Christmas trees, the hanging of Advent wreaths, Christmas stockings, candy canes, setting out cookies and milk, the creation of Nativity scenes depicting the birth of Jesus Christ and giving gifts to others. Christmas carols may be sung and stories told about such figures as the Baby Jesus, Saint Nicholas, Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Christkind or Grandfather Frost. The sending and exchange of Christmas card greetings, observance of fasting and special religious observances such as a midnight Mass or Vespers on Christmas Eve, the burning of a Yule log, and the giving and receiving of presents are also common practice. Along with Easter, Christmas is one of the most important periods on the Christian calendar, and is often closely connected to other holidays at this time of year, such as Advent, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, Saint Nicholas Day, Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day, New Year&#x27;s, and the Feast of the Epiphany.
Many national governments recognize Christmas as an official public holiday, while others recognize it in a symbolic way but not as an official legal observance. Countries in which Christmas is not a formal public holiday include Afghanistan, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bhutan, Cambodia, China (excepting Hong Kong and Macau), the Comoros, Iran, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Laos, Libya, the Maldives, Mauritania, Mongolia, Morocco, North Korea, Oman, Qatar, the Sahrawi Republic, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Taiwan (Republic of China), Tajikistan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Yemen. Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is not a public holiday but is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the secular aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees.

Christmas celebrations around the world can vary markedly in form, reflecting differing cultural and national traditions. Among countries with a strong Christian tradition, a variety of Christmas celebrations have developed that incorporate regional and local cultures.

== Africa ==
=== Ethiopia and Eritrea ===

Christmas Day, known as Ledet in Eritrea and Gena in Ethiopia, is celebrated on 7 January (27 Tahsas of the Ethiopian calendar). Many Christians in Eritrea and Ethiopia observe a 40-day fast before the holiday, culminating in dawn church services on Christmas morning. The day features vibrant musical celebrations with priests in ceremonial robes performing rituals, including dancing and drumming. A traditional hockey-like game called gena is played in the afternoon, with the community leader awarding a prize to the winner. Most Ethiopians don a traditional &quot;shamma&quot;, a thin, white cotton wrap with brightly colored stripes across the ends. The celebration is followed by the three-day festival of Timkat, starting on 19 January, which commemorates the baptism of Jesus Christ.

=== Nigeria ===
Christmas Day is a public holiday in Nigeria which is always marked by the emptying of towns and cities of Nigerians who have been successful returning to their ancestral villages to be with family and to bless those less fortunate. As the towns and cities empty, people jam the West African markets to buy and transport live chickens, goats and cows that will be needed for the Christmas meals.

On Christmas Eve, traditional meals are prepared according to the traditions of each region. Nigerians as a whole tend to prepare various meats in large quantities. In the south, a dish called jollof rice is served with stews of various meats along with boiled beans and fried plantains; in the north, rice and stew as well as &quot;tuwon shinkafa&quot;, a rice pudding served with various meat stews, is preferred. In the north several local desserts are also made which are rarely found in other parts of Nigeria. An alternative in both regions (but more favored in the south) is a pepper soup with fish, goat, or beef which may also be served with fufu (pounded yam). Served with this food are an array of mainly alcoholic drinks such as the traditional palm wine or various local and imported beers and wines; children and women may be served locally-made soft-drink equivalents instead.

Gift giving in Nigeria often involves money and the flow of gifts from the more fortunate to the less fortunate. After the &quot;successful&quot; visitors have come from their towns, cities, and even overseas, they are given time to settle in. Afterwards, local relatives begin approaching them asking for assistance of some kind, whether financial or not. Financial donations and elaborately wrapped gifts may be given out at lavish parties, weddings, and ceremonies; sometimes the money is scattered in the air to be grabbed by the others or stuck onto the sweaty foreheads of those dancing.

Religion in Nigeria is about equally divided between Christians and Muslims.

===Senegal===
Christmas is a popular holiday in the Muslim-majority country of Senegal.

=== South Africa ===
Christmas in South Africa is a public holiday celebrated on 25 December. Many European traditions are maintained, despite the distance from Europe.

Christmas trees are set up in homes and children are given presents in their stockings. Traditional &#x27;fir&#x27; Christmas trees are popular. On Christmas Eve children leave a stocking of milk and cookies out for Santa Claus, who brings them gifts. Towns and cities have Carols by Candlelight at the beginning of the festive season where groups of people come together to sing Christmas carols and donate toys and clothing to needy children.

The Christmas meal can include mince pies, turkey, gammon, beef tongue, turducken, corned beef, green salad, roast beef, or a barbecue outdoors. The meal is finished with Christmas pudding, ice cream, or trifle. Christmas crackers are used to make noise.

Despite Christmas occurring at the height of the Southern Hemisphere summer, wintry motifs common to the Northern Hemisphere are popular.

=== Ghana ===
In Ghana, Christmas, known locally as &quot;Bronya&quot;, is celebrated on 25 December, with both 25 and 26 December recognized as public holidays. Ghanaian Christians typically observe Christmas by attending church services on 25th December. Children often wear specially-bought or sewn Christmas attire(locally called &quot;b, which brings them joy.

Secular Ghanaians also partake in Christmas celebrations by attending events organized by prominent Ghanaian secular musicians, playwrights, comedians, filmmakers, and other entertainers.

Overall, Ghanaians view Christmas as an opportunity to share gifts, enjoy traditional dishes such as fufu, banku, and jollof, and spend time with family and friends. Additionally, many contribute to the happiness of others by donating to orphanages.

=== Tanzania ===
Christmas is a public holiday in the Christian majority country. Many people irrespective of religion go out and buy new clothes, which is customary for most public holidays, or go to the beach, cinema and other entertainment venues. Religious Christians will go to church to worship, then gather with their family and community to eat. In the cities, natural or plastic Christmas trees may be decorated. The film Jesus is shown on public televisions as is customary in Tanzania during any Christian holiday.

== Americas ==
=== Caribbean ===

==== Bahamas ====
Junkanoo festivals are held Boxing Day, 26 December and again on New Year&#x27;s Day. It is a local cultural event dating back to its African heritage featuring goat skin drums, cowbell and brass instruments, singing, and choreographed dancers dressed in traditional handmade colourful costumes.

Bahamian Christmas foods include benny cake, coconut cake, flour cake from Acklins and Cat Island, fruit cake, baked ham and turkey, traditional peas and rice, baked macaroni, coleslaw, plantains, fried fish, boiled fish (Nassau Grouper and snappers) and Johnny cake. Drinks like eggnog, lemonade and local beers (Kalik and Sands) are also served on Christmas.

==== Cuba ====
Cuba has a long tradition of celebrating Christmas. Families used to gather at the dining table, and used to go to mass after dinner.
The Communist Regime led by Fidel Castro abolished the paid Christmas holiday in 1969, citing that workers were needed to continue the sugar harvest. In 1998, the Regime declared December 25 a leisure day, as requested by Pope John Paul II as a condition to visit the country. It is a one-day public holiday and it is celebrated only in the evening.

==== Jamaica ====

Radio stations play Christmas carols as early as October, both reggae-style and some international. Jamaicans paint their houses and hang new curtains for Christmas. Pepper lights, the local name for Christmas lights, go up even on trees.

Junkanoo or John Canoe is a traditional Christmas celebration in Jamaica, influenced by African heritage. This includes street dancing and a great parade through the streets with Jamaicans dressed in colorful masquerade costumes and masks. The traditional Jamaican Christmas meal includes ackee, saltfish, breadfruit, fried plantains, boiled bananas, freshly squeezed fruit juice and tea for breakfast; chicken, curried goat, stewed oxtail, rice and gungo peas for dinner. For dessert, sorrel drink and a Jamaican rum fruitcake along with red wine are served in many homes.

Many people attend church for Christmas Eve or Christmas morning worship service. Some people go to the Christmas Eve Grand Market to walk with family and friends and shop until 2 or 3 a.m. Christmas Day. Some British Christmas traditions have stayed in Jamaica, like Father Christmas, roast beef or lamb dinners, and Boxing Day.

=== Central America ===

==== El Salvador ====
Christmas in El Salvador carries a strong meaning that brings families together. In El Salvador children celebrate Christmas by playing with firecrackers, fountains, such as the small (&#x27;little volcanos&#x27;) and sparklers, (&#x27;little stars&#x27;). Teenagers and young adults display bigger fireworks or Roman Candles. Families also have parties in which they dance and eat. 
Santa Claus is known for appearing in TV and print ads, but people ask children if they already wrote a letter to little baby Jesus. Traditional Salvadoran Christmas dishes are sautéed turkey sandwiches in a baguette with lettuce and radishes, Salvadoran tamales, and sweet bread for dessert. Drinks include hot chocolate, pineapple juice, Salvadoran horchata, Salvadoran cherry horchata, and coffee. 

==== Guatemala ====
On Christmas in Guatemala, people dress up in an ornamental hat, called a , and dance in a line. As with much of the country&#x27;s culture, the celebration includes Spanish and Mayan elements.

=== North America ===
Christmas is observed widely on 25 December. Governments recognizing the holiday include those of the United States, where it is a federal holiday for federal employees and a legal holiday in the respective states; Canada, where it is a nationwide statutory holiday; Mexico, where it is also a nationwide statutory holiday; and several others.

==== Canada ====
Christmas Day is one of five Canadian statutory holidays observed nationwide, and Boxing Day is a federal holiday that is also observed in select provinces. Christmas Eve is not a statutory holiday in any jurisdiction, but many businesses and government entities individually choose to close early or for the entire day on December 24. In the Canadian provinces where English is the predominant language, Christmas traditions are largely similar to those of the United States, with some lingering influences from the United Kingdom and newer traditions brought by immigrants from other European countries. Mince pies, plum pudding, and Christmas cake are traditionally served as Christmas dinner desserts, following the traditional meal of roast turkey, stuffing, potatoes, and winter vegetables. Christmas table crackers are not uncommon and, in some parts of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, Christmas traditions include mummers.

North American influences on Christmas are evident in the hanging of stockings on Christmas Eve, to be filled by Santa Claus. However, Canadian children believe that the home of Santa Claus is located at the North Pole, in Canada, and, through Canada Post, address thousands of letters to Santa Claus each year, using the postal code designation &quot;H0H 0H0&quot;. The tradition of decorating Christmas trees, whether fresh-cut or artificial, was introduced to Canada in 1781, originally by German soldiers stationed in Quebec during the American Revolution, and are now common in private homes and commercial spaces throughout most of Canada.

As Canada is a cold, dark country in winter, lights are often put up in public places and on commercial and residential buildings in November and December. Many communities have celebrations that include light events, such as the Cavalcade of Lights Festival in Toronto, the Montreal Christmas Fireworks, or the Bright Nights in Stanley Park, Vancouver. A national program, Christmas Lights Across Canada (later renamed to Winter Lights Across Canada), illuminates Ottawa, the national capital, and the 13 provincial and territorial capitals.

In the province of Quebec, Christmas traditions include &quot;réveillon&quot;, &quot;Père Noël&quot; (&#x27;Father Christmas&#x27;), and the &quot;bûche de Noël&quot; (Yule log), among many others. A traditional dish for the is &quot;tourtière&quot;, a savoury meat pie, and gifts are opened during , often following Midnight Mass.

The Royal Christmas Message from the Canadian monarch is televised nationwide in Canada, the occasion being an observance which unites Canadians with citizens of the other Commonwealth countries worldwide. The observation of Boxing Day on the day following Christmas Day is a tradition practiced in Canada, as it is in many other Anglophone countries, although not in the United States. In Canada, Boxing Day is a day (or the beginning of a few days) of deeply discounted sale prices at retail stores which attract large numbers of shoppers in search of bargains.

Christmas is known as &quot;Quviasukvik&quot; in the territories of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and Yukon and the areas of Nunavik, Nunatsiavut and NunatuKavut and the Inuit celebrate it as their New Year.

==== Greenland ====
Christmas in Greenland – an island who Hans Egede under the Danish crown brought Lutheranism to in the 16th century – is usually celebrated on the evening of 24 December and the days of the 25th and 26th. The Christmas season begins on the first day of Advent, which is the fourth Sunday before Christmas day, when Christmas trees are put up and decorated, and villages also put a large Christmas tree on a nearby hill. Christmas is known as &quot;Quviasukvik&quot; and the Inuit celebrate it as their New Year.

==== Mexico ====
Christmas is a statutory holiday in Mexico and workers can have the day off with pay. Mexico&#x27;s Christmas is filled with over 30 traditions found only within Mexican Christmas. Over nine days, groups of townspeople, in a tradition called the Posadas, go from door to door in a fashion of when the parents of the unborn baby Jesus Christ looked for shelter to pass the night when they arrived at Bethlehem, and are periodically called inside homes to participate in the breaking of a candy-filled piñata.

Mexican Christmas festivities start on December 12, with the feast of La Guadalupana (Our Lady of Guadalupe), and end on January 6, the Feast of the Epiphany. Since the 1990s, Mexican society has embraced a new concept linking several celebrations around the Christmas season into what is known as the Guadalupe-Reyes Marathon. At midnight on Christmas, after Midnight Mass, many families place the figure of baby Jesus in their (Nativity scenes), as the symbolic representation of Christmas as a whole, in homes. In the center and south of Mexico, children receive gifts on Christmas Eve and on January 6, they celebrate the Feast of the Epiphany, when, according to tradition, the Three Wise Men brought gifts to Bethlehem for Jesus Christ. Santa Claus (or Santa Clos, as he is known in Mexico) is who brings the children their gifts, but traditionally on that night the Three Wise Men will fill the children&#x27;s shoes with candies, oranges, tangerines, nuts, and sugar cane, and sometimes money or gold, symbolizing the very gifts they gave to the Baby Jesus in Bethlehem during his infancy and a reflection of his future destiny as saviour of the world. January 6 is marked by big parties and events.

As in Guatemala, the presence of indigenous communities has added many elements to Mexican Christmas, thus celebrations may include Aztec/Nahuan and Mayan influences.

==== United States ====


Christmas is a widely celebrated festive holiday in the United States, and Christmas Day is officially recognized as a federal holiday by the U.S. government. In select years, Christmas Eve is declared by the president via executive order to be a federal holiday as well, the latest such directive having been for December 24, 2024. The Christmas and holiday season begins around the end of November with a major shopping kickoff on Black Friday, the day after the U.S. holiday of Thanksgiving, though the period during which Christmas decorations are present and thematically appropriate music is playing in stores sometimes extends into the period between Halloween and Thanksgiving. Many schools and businesses are closed during the period between Christmas and the New Year&#x27;s Day holiday, which is a time commonly used to spend time with family and close friends. Most decorations are taken down by New Years or Epiphany. Other observances considered part of the season (and potentially included in non-denominational holiday greetings like &quot;Happy Holidays&quot;) include Hanukkah, Yule, Epiphany, Three Kings Day, and other celebrations. December 26, popularly referred to as Boxing Day or Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day elsewhere in the Western world, is only known widely as the &quot;Day after Christmas&quot; in the U.S., and is observed in a number of states under that name, but is not a federal holiday. Christmas is known as &quot;Quviasukvik&quot; in the state of Alaska and the Inuit, the Yupik, the Aleut and the Iñupiat celebrate it as their New Year.

The interiors and exteriors of houses are decorated during the weeks leading up to Christmas Eve. Christmas tree farms in the United States and Canada provide families with trees for their homes, many opting for artificial ones, but some for real ones. The Christmas tree usually stands centrally in the home, decorated with ornaments, tinsel, and lights, with an angel or a star symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem at the top.

Christmas Eve is popularly described as &quot;the night before Christmas&quot; in the poem actually titled &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot;. Better known as Santa Claus, he is said to visit homes while children are sleeping during the night before Christmas morning. The fireplaces in many homes have been replaced by electric fireplaces, but the yule log has remained a tradition. Christmas stockings are hung on the mantelpiece for Santa Claus to fill with little gifts (&quot;stocking stuffers&quot;). It is tradition throughout the United States for children to leave a glass of milk and plate of Christmas cookies for Santa Claus nearby.

Presents the family will exchange are wrapped and placed near the tree, including presents to be given to pets. Friends exchange wrapped presents and tell each other not to open presents before Christmas. Grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, siblings and occasionally guests from out of town are entertained in the home or else visited. Wrapped presents are most commonly opened on the morning of Christmas Day; however, some families choose to open all or some of their presents on Christmas Eve, depending on evolving family traditions, logistics, and the age of the children involved; for example, adults might open their presents on Christmas Eve and minor children on Christmas morning, or everyone might open their gifts on Christmas morning. Others follow the tradition of opening family-exchanged gifts on Christmas Eve night, followed by opening of the presents Santa brought on Christmas morning. Children are normally allowed to play with their new toys and games afterwards.

The traditional Christmas dinner usually features either roasted turkey with stuffing (sometimes called dressing), ham, or roast beef. Potatoes, squash, roasted vegetables and cranberry sauce are served along with tonics and sherries. A variety of sweet pastry and egg nog sprinkled with cinnamon and nutmeg are served in the United States. Certain dishes such as casseroles and desserts are often prepared with a family recipe. Sometimes, families also partake in a religious tradition, such as the consumption of a Christmas wafer in Christian families of European ancestry. Fruits, nuts, cheeses and chocolates are enjoyed as snacks.

Other traditions include a special church service on the Sunday before Christmas and Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. Candlelight services are held earlier in the evening for families with children, and special Christmas services may be held earlier in the season for people who may be traveling out of town closer to the holiday. A re-enactment of the Nativity of Jesus called a Nativity play is another tradition.

Christmas-related tourist attractions, such as the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and elaborate animated department store Christmas windows in New York City are heavily visited by tourists from all over the world. Christmas music can be heard in the background. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir is one whose annual carol singing is well-recognized. Christmas symphony orchestra and choral presentation such as Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; and performances of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; ballet are attended. Local radio stations may temporarily switch format to play exclusively Christmas music, some going to an all-Christmas format as early as mid-October. A few television stations broadcast a Yule Log without interruption for several hours. News broadcasts and talk shows feature Christmas-themed segments, emphasizing fellowship and goodwill among neighbors. Of particular note is the observance of Christmas for military families of soldiers and sailors serving abroad, on both sides of the Canada–U.S. border. The Los Angeles Lakers have made it a tradition, since they relocated from Minneapolis prior to the 1960-61 NBA season, to have a home game on Christmas. As of 2008, the NBA now schedules five games on Christmas, usually including classic rivalry games as well as a rematch of the previous season&#x27;s NBA Finals.

=== South America ===

==== Brazil ====
Christmas Day on December 25 is a national holiday in Brazil. Because Brazil lies in the Southern Hemisphere, Brazilians celebrate Christmas in the summer. In the small cities in the entire country, as well as in the largest cities, such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Recife, Salvador, Fortaleza, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Goiânia, Brasília, Manaus, Belém, Natal and Belo Horizonte, the celebrations resemble in many ways the traditions in Europe and North America, with the Christmas tree, the exchanging of gifts and Christmas cards, the decoration of houses and buildings with electric lights and the nativity scene. Despite the warm tropical summer weather, some incongruences such as decorations with themes of winter and snow are not uncommon. In some cities such as Guarapuava, there are decoration contests, when judges go to houses to look at the decorations, inside or outside of the house, and decide the most beautiful house. Christmas Eve is the most important day. Unlike in the North American and Anglo-Saxon tradition, Christmas takes action mainly near midnight, usually with big family dinners, opening of gifts and the celebration of the (&#x27;Rooster&#x27;s Mass&#x27;) in churches throughout the nation.

Many Brazilians decorate their homes with a Christmas Tree. There is no rule, and the parents can decorate it by themselves as a surprise to the kids, or they can do it together. In addition to the Christmas tree, many families set up a (nativity scene) as the main decoration. Nativity scenes are very popular in Brazil, and can be seen everywhere including churches and popular places around the town. Like many other countries, Christmas dinner in Brazil is normally served late in the evening on Christmas Eve around 10 or 11 p.m. The meal often includes farofa stuffing, assortments of fruit, fried cod, and roast turkey with a dessert called &quot;rabanada&quot;. Along with their meals, Brazilians typically drink champagne, wine, and fruit punch. Typically after they eat, many Brazilians attend a Midnight Mass service or watch the Pope&#x27;s television broadcast celebration of &quot;Midnight Mass in Rome&quot; with family and friends.

The Christmas season typically starts in late November or early December, after the celebration of the Feast of Our Lady of Aparecida (October 12) and All Souls&#x27; Day (November 2). The holiday spirit begins to rise with the start of Advent, which is observed on the four Sundays leading up to Christmas. Many Brazilian cities, especially major urban centers like Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, start putting up Christmas lights and decorations around this time, with public events such as Christmas tree lighting ceremonies and nativity scenes.

The festive mood continues through Christmas Eve (December 24), which is the main day for family gatherings, a large meal, and the exchange of gifts. The celebrations often extend through the New Year and conclude on January 6, Epiphany or Dia de Reis (Three Kings&#x27; Day), when Brazilians commemorate the visit of the Magi to the baby Jesus.

In some regions, the Christmas season may even begin as early as November, with malls and commercial centers decorating and hosting events.

==== Colombia ====

Christmas is a public holiday in Colombia and is primarily a religious celebration. Presents are brought by (Baby Jesus).

While Christmas decorations may be put up as early as the beginning of November, the unofficial start of Colombian Christmas festivities takes place on December 7, &quot;Día de las Velitas&quot;, or &#x27;Day of the Candles.&#x27; At night, the streets, sidewalks, balconies, porches, and driveways are decorated with candles and paper lanterns, which illuminate cities and towns in a yellow glow to honor the Immaculate Conception on the following day, December 8. In many cities, and even in small rural towns, neighborhoods get together and decorate their whole neighborhood or street, turning streets into virtual &quot;tunnels of light&quot;. Many radio stations and local organizations hold contests for the best display of lights, making the competition for the best light show a serious event. The city of Medellín has become a popular tourist destination during the holiday season because of its Christmas lights. Activities such as musical events and firework displays are planned by cities and held during this time. Individually launched fireworks were a common item during the Christmas season in Colombia, often going on at any time of the day in many cities. However, a recent ban has decreased the individual use of fireworks, and now only cities or towns are able to hold firework displays.
December 16 is the first day of the Christmas Novena, a devotion consisting of prayer said on nine successive days, the last one held on Christmas Eve. The Novena is promoted by the Catholic Church as a staple of Christmas, and is very similar to the &quot;posadas&quot; celebrated in Mexico. It is a call for an understanding of the religious meaning of Christmas, and a way to counter the commercialism of the Christmas season. Individual traditions concerning the Novena may vary, but most families set up a (manger scene), sing religious Christmas carols called &quot;villancicos&quot; accompanied by tambourines, bells, and other simple percussion instruments, and read verses from the Bible as well as an interpretation which may change from year to year. Novenas serve as religious gatherings as well as learning environments for young children since kids have a central and active role in the celebration of the Novenas (they read prayers, sing, and play instruments guided by their family). From December 16 to 24, games called are played after having made a &quot;pinky promise&quot; deciding the prize for the winner and the punishment for the loser. The games include (&#x27;Talk but don&#x27;t answer&#x27;), (&#x27;Give but don&#x27;t receive&#x27;), (&#x27;Straw in the mouth&#x27;), (&#x27;Three feet&#x27;), (&#x27;Stolen kisses&#x27;), and (&#x27;Yes or no&#x27;). Churches offer dawn and nightly masses during the nine days of the novena, culminating with the &quot;Misa de Gallo&quot; (&#x27;Rooster&#x27;s Mass&#x27;) on Christmas Eve at midnight.

Christmas Eve is the most important day of Christmas in Colombia. Families and friends get together to pray the last novena and wait until midnight to open the presents, parties are held until sunrise on Christmas Day, kids stay up late playing with their new presents, and fireworks fill the skies. Families gather around meals, music, and singing. Because Christmas Eve is the most important day, little occurs on December 25. Families join Christmas Day mass although it is not nearly as festive as Christmas Eve.

The , or the Day of the Innocents, falls in the Christmas season, on December 28. The day commemorates the innocent infants (called the innocent ones) who were said to have been killed by King Herod in fear of the power of the newborn baby, Jesus. January 6, the day of the Revelation of the Magi (Epiphany), is called (from The Three Magi), used to be a day of gift-giving, but is celebrated less now since gifts are given mostly around Christmas Eve today. Some families still give presents, and it is also the day when godparents give Christmas presents.

==== Uruguay ====

Christmas Day, December 25, is a public holiday in Uruguay, although it is officially called &quot;Family Day&quot; since the separation of church and state at the beginning of the 20th century. However, the celebration is known as (Christmas). The Christmas and holiday season begins on December 8 (Feast of the Immaculate Conception), the day on which the Christmas tree is traditionally set up and Christmas decorations are put up in homes, shops and streets, including, in many homes, the or (nativity scene). In many cities, Christmas markets are set up where toys, clothes, decorations and food are sold.

In addition to traditional Christmas decorations, it is common among Uruguayan Christians to put up a balcony banner with an illustration of the nativity scene that reads &quot;Christmas with Jesus&quot;. These banners were launched in 2016 as part of a campaign carried out by the Catholic Church in Uruguay to &quot;raise awareness about the true meaning of the holiday&quot; in a highly secular country. Pope Francis welcomed the initiative and was photographed with one in the Vatican City.

The celebrations begin at nightfall on Christmas Eve (December 24), with family gatherings where traditionally they eat &quot;asado&quot;, &quot;vitél toné&quot;, and desserts such as &quot;turrón&quot; and &quot;panetone&quot;, which were incorporated into Uruguayan culture due to European Immigration to the country. At the stroke of midnight, people flock to the streets to enjoy fireworks and light firecrackers; meanwhile, (Santa Claus) leaves, next to the Christmas trees, gifts that the children asked for in letters that they left throughout the month in shopping centers and other places where he is seen. There is also an exchange of gifts between family and friends.

Because Uruguay lies in the Southern Hemisphere, Christmas is celebrated in summer, which is why open-air music festivals are held from noon on the 24th, and early morning until the 25th, mainly in coastal cities such as Montevideo and Punta del Este, which receives a large number of tourists from neighboring countries. On Christmas Day the whole population has the day off to be with their family and friends, so public transport, malls and offices are closed down.

==== Venezuela ====
In Venezuela, Christmas is celebrated as a religious occasion. As in Colombia, the presents are brought by (Baby Jesus) instead of (Santa Claus), who still has an important role during this season.

The Christmas season starts as early as October 1, and ends in mid-January. Christmas decorations and songs become more prominent as Christmas nears. 

In many cities, small rural towns and neighborhoods get together for the , night festivals where children go and play with skateboards, roller blades and bicycles. These events are usually sponsored by the local parish church, where neighbors organize themselves and sell typical Christmas food, hot chocolate, hallaca, cookies, etc. Also, still in some neighborhoods is the &quot;parranda&quot;, where people go caroling from house to house, singing and receiving food and drinks, this tradition is rooted among Afro-Venezuelans with origins in Africa. The same tradition, though called &quot;Paradura del Niño&quot; exists in the Venezuelan Andes; however, the carolers carry an image of Baby Jesus. Children write request letters to Baby Jesus. The presents are sent by Baby Jesus at midnight, and most people have a party, which goes on until sunrise.

== Asia ==
=== Central Asia ===

==== Uzbekistan ====
Christmas is not an official holiday in Uzbekistan. Out of a population of 35 million, approximately 2.2 percent is Russian Orthodox. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, this number has continued to decline as ethnic Russians and other Orthodox Christians emigrate to Russia and other countries. The Christians of Uzbekistan celebrate Christmas on December 25 in the Julian calendar used by the church, which falls on 7 January in the common Gregorian calendar.

Much like in the rest of the Soviet Union, Christmas was largely erased from the calendar during much of the 20th century under the Soviets&#x27; anti-religious policies, but many traditions survived having been transplanted to New Year&#x27;s. Christmas is still eclipsed by New Year&#x27;s Day in Uzbekistan, which remains a major holiday even among Christians.

Christmas symbols and decorations similar to those found in Europe or the US can be seen on the streets of larger cities, but for a majority of the population Christmas is simply a part of New Year celebrations. Many people, including Muslims, decorate a Christmas tree, even though they do not celebrate Christmas and call the tree New Year&#x27;s tree ().

==== Kazakhstan ====
In 2005, Christmas was declared an official holiday in Kazakhstan, and today the holiday is observed by many people in the country regardless of their religion or ethnicity.

=== East Asia ===

==== China ====

In China, December 25 is not a legal holiday. However, it is still designated as a public holiday in China&#x27;s special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, former colonies of the United Kingdom and Portugal respectively.

In the mainland, the small percentage of Chinese citizens who consider themselves Christians unofficially, and usually privately, observe Christmas. Many other individuals celebrate Christmas-like festivities even though they do not consider themselves Christians. Many customs, including sending cards, exchanging gifts, and hanging stockings are very similar to Western celebrations. Commercial Christmas decorations, signs, and other symbolic items have become increasingly prevalent during the month of December in large urban centres of mainland China, reflecting a cultural interest in this Western phenomenon, and, sometimes, retail marketing campaigns as well.

===== Hong Kong =====
In Hong Kong, where Christmas is a public holiday, many buildings facing Victoria Harbour will be decorated with Christmas lights. Christmas trees are found in major malls and other public buildings, and in some homes as well, despite the small living area. Catholics in Hong Kong can attend Christmas Mass.

Hong Kong was deeply influenced by British and Western culture during the colonial era. Christmas is one of the most valued festivals in Hong Kong after Lunar New Year. The Christmas atmosphere is also stronger than most countries in Asia. Both Christmas Day on December 25 and Boxing Day on 26th are public holidays. On Boxing Day on the 26th, there is no holiday and no supplementary holiday. The custom of celebrating Christmas in the early years was not extensive. It was not common until the 1970s, when the society of Hong Kong stabilized, that the number of people celebrating Christmas began to increase. Although Christians account for only one-eighth of the population of Hong Kong, the Christmas Day atmosphere is still strong. The public generally sees this annual holiday as a big day for vacation, travel, carnival, pastime, dating or making friends. Halloween decorations on interior and exterior walls of many shopping malls are quickly removed after October 31, and Christmas decorations and lighting are put up in mid-November. The facades of buildings on both sides of Victoria Harbour, Tsim Sha Tsui and Central are all decorated with Christmas lights. Christmas trees can be seen everywhere, and a giant 15-meter-high Christmas tree is erected in the Statue Square, Central. Many citizens start related activities in early December, such as attending Christmas parties, having Christmas dinners and exchanging Christmas gifts. Protestant and Catholic religious leaders in Hong Kong publish Christmas announcements on Christmas Eve. Although December 24, the day before Christmas, is not a holiday, some businesses let employees and bosses off work early, and the stock market only opens in the morning on that day. Christmas Eve at night is the climax of the festive atmosphere. Tsim Sha Tsui, Causeway Bay and Lan Kwai Fong in Central are crowded with people enjoying Christmas lights and carnivals. Churches and chapels hold Midnight Mass that evening, and some Protestants and Catholics attend religious gatherings. Most shops, restaurants and entertainment venues are still open during Christmas, while public transportation, such as the MTR and buses, is available overnight on Christmas Eve. All primary and secondary schools, kindergartens and tertiary institutions in Hong Kong will have Christmas holidays. Most primary and secondary schools usually hold the Christmas Party on December 20 or 21, and then Christmas holidays until New Year&#x27;s Day, so Christmas and Lunar New Year is the longest consecutive holiday throughout the year except summer vacation. The student organizations of colleges and universities will also hold Christmas parties from mid-December. Students at colleges and universities usually do not need to attend classes from Christmas Day to New Year&#x27;s Day. Hong Kong citizens use the Christmas holidays to meet friends, family or friends for gatherings, shopping and pastimes, while young people like to spend holidays as a couple or find partners during the holiday, like another Valentine&#x27;s Day. In addition, people in Hong Kong generally think that Christmas gifts must be opened until Boxing Day on December 26; this day is also referred to as &quot;gift opening day&quot;, but in fact, most people open their Christmas gifts as early on Christmas Eve or Christmas morning, and there is no habit of opening Christmas gifts until Boxing Day on the 26th. Some children write to Santa Claus; the letters are sent to the &quot;Undeliverable mail&quot; department of the Post Office, and the staff of the department responds as Santa Claus to each letter. In addition, some people celebrate Christmas with the Winter Solstice until New Year&#x27;s Day.

===== Macau =====
Christmas is a public holiday in Macau. Its traditions are mostly influenced by the Portuguese since the territory was a colony of Portugal until December 20, 1999. Casinos in Macau remain open on Christmas Day. Christmas masses in Macau&#x27;s Catholic churches are held in either Chinese, Cantonese, English or Portuguese.

==== Japan ====
Encouraged by commerce, the secular celebration of Christmas is popular in Japan, though Christmas is not a national holiday. Gifts are sometimes exchanged. Christmas parties are held around Christmas Day; Japanese Christmas cake, a white sponge cake covered with cream and decorated with strawberries, is often consumed and Stollen cake, either imported or made locally, is widely available. Christmas lights decorate cities, and Christmas trees adorn living areas and malls. Christmas Eve has become a holiday for couples to spend time together and exchange gifts. A successful advertising campaign in the 1970s made eating at KFC around Christmas a national custom. Its chicken meals are so popular during the season that stores take reservations months in advance.

===== History =====
The first recorded Christmas in Japan was a mass held by Jesuit missionaries in Yamaguchi Prefecture in 1552, while it is not impossible that unrecorded celebrations were held before this date, starting in 1549 when Saint Francis Xavier arrived in Japan. Christianity was banned throughout Japan in 1612. However, a small enclave of Kakure Kirishitan (&#x27;hidden Christians&#x27;) continued to practice underground over the next 250 years.

Christianity in Japan along with Christmas reemerged in the Meiji period. Influenced by America, Christmas parties were held and presents were exchanged. The practice slowly spread, but its proximity to the New Year&#x27;s celebrations makes it a smaller focus of attention. It became a popular celebration for non-Christians during 1900s after the Russo-Japanese War. During World War II, all celebrations, especially American, were suppressed. From the 1960s, with an expanding economy, and influenced by American TV, Christmas became popular. Many songs and TV series present Christmas as romantic, for example &quot;Last Christmas&quot; by Exile. The birthday of the previous emperor, Akihito, on December 23 is or was a national holiday. Businesses soon close for the New Year&#x27;s holidays, reopening after January 3.

==== Mongolia ====
Christmas is not an official holiday in Mongolia. Though the country is mainly Tibetan Buddhist, there are Christian churches that hold evening services and concerts. The Mongolians celebrate the New Year with Christmas trees and dozens of parties.

==== South Korea ====
Christmas is a public holiday in South Korea.

Christmas traditions are generally mixed with Korean culture and cuisine, and Christmas is especially celebrated by the Christian community (Protestants and Catholics alike), treated as a Christian counterpart to certain Korean fall festivities wherein family members visit relatives during the holiday, with Hanbok or Western attire prevalent even in holiday services.

==== Taiwan ====
As only around 5% of the population are actually Christian, Christmas is not usually celebrated as a religious event in Taiwan. Before 2001, December 25 used to be a national holiday, as that was the Constitution Day, the day on which the Constitution of the Republic of China was signed in 1947. In recent years, the secular celebration of Christmas has gained popularity in Taiwan. Christmas parties are held and gifts are sometimes exchanged. Major cities and shopping malls are now decorated with Christmas lights and trees in December to celebrate the festival. One of the most popular Christmas events in Taiwan is Christmasland in New Taipei City organized by the New Taipei City Government, consisting of major Christmas celebration activities and art installations. A series of activities such as the family garden party, Christmas parade carnival and Christmas Eve concert are often held; the programme varies slightly from year to year.

=== South Asia ===

==== Bangladesh ====
Christmas is known as (&#x27;Big Day&#x27;) in Bengali. Pitha, cookies and cake are prepared by Bangladeshi Christians during Christmas. Christmas is a one-day public holiday. On Christmas Eve, churches hold a large dinner called that includes pulau, egg korma, fish fry and vegetable curries. On Christmas Eve and Christmas morning, prayers are generally held in church. After prayers, carol performances happen. Bengali Christian churches are also decorated with lights and Christmas trees. Some Christians also decorate their homes for celebrations or visits, and give money or toys as gifts to children.

Christmas is also increasingly celebrated by other religions in Bangladesh, especially in urban areas. People celebrate by going to theme parks, zoos and museums, hosting small Christmas parties in restaurants and homes, or with gift-giving.

==== India ====

Christmas is a state holiday in India, although Christianity in India is a minority with only 2.3% of the population. Despite most Indians being Hindus, millions of Indians still celebrate Christmas as a secular holiday.

Christians, especially Catholics, attend Midnight Mass. Many Christian houses in India decorate with Christmas cribs and Christmas trees and hang brightly lit stars (symbolising the Bethlehem star) outside their houses. They distribute sweets and cakes to their neighbors. In many schools run by Christian missionaries and in some schools run by other religion trusts (including Hinduism, Islam, etc), the children actively participate in Christmas programs. Many government schools also have a tradition of Christmas celebrations. Christmas is also increasingly celebrated by other religions in India.
Christmas is known as (&#x27;Big Day&#x27;) in North and North-West India and people plant trees on this day.

==== Pakistan ====

Christianity in Pakistan constitutes the second largest religious minority community in Pakistan after Hindus. The total number of Christians is approximately 2,800,000 in 2008, or 1.6% of the population. Of these, approximately half are Roman Catholic and half Protestant. Christians celebrate Christmas by going from house to house singing carols, and in return the family offers something to the choir. The money collected from such carols is usually used for charity works or is given to the church. Homes are decorated with local Christmas handicrafts while artificial stars signifying the Star of Bethlehem are hung on rooftops. Special foods, such as the Allahabadi fruitcake, are eaten in Pakistan during the Christmas season. Christmas celebrations are also popular with the urban middle class in the country with hotels, cafes, restaurants and theme parks hosting festivities and special events.

=== Southeast Asia ===

==== Brunei ====
As of December 22, 2015, Christmas is completely banned in Brunei, but its expatriate and local Christian communities still celebrate it privately amongst themselves. The ban includes putting up Christmas trees, singing Christmas carols, Nativity plays, festive greetings, and even dressing as Santa Claus. Anyone caught will face up to five years in jail. Before the law was passed in 2014, non-Muslim expats were free to celebrate Christmas in Brunei.

==== Indonesia ====
Christmas in Indonesia (locally known as , from the Portuguese word for &#x27;Christmas&#x27;), is one of many public holidays in Indonesia, which approximately 16.5 million Protestants and 6.9 million Roman Catholics celebrate with various traditions throughout the country. In provinces with a majority or significant Christian population (Protestant and Catholic) such as North Sumatra, Jakarta, West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, North Kalimantan, North Sulawesi, West Sulawesi, Central Sulawesi, East Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, the whole Papua Island, and cities like Surabaya, Tangerang, Batam, Bandung, Rantepao, etc., the Christmas season is filled with ceremonies, festivals, and local foods. In big cities, many shopping centres, offices, some roads, and other commercial places feature decorations such as plastic Christmas trees and &quot;Sinterklas&quot; (derived from the Dutch word &quot;Sinterklaas&quot;) and his reindeer. Most local television channels broadcast Christmas musical concerts as well as annual national Christmas celebrations like concerts and Christmas shows which are held by the government. Like other countries, on Christmas Eve people go to church for &quot;misa&quot; and attend again the next morning. Exchanging gifts is a usual tradition for Christians in Indonesia. In addition to traditional foods, Christmas Day generally features cookies, like (pineapple tart), (from Dutch ), or &quot;putri salju&quot;.

==== Malaysia ====
Although Christmas is a public holiday in Malaysia, much of the public celebration is commercial in nature and has no overt religious overtones. Occasionally, Christian activist groups do buy newspaper advertisements on Christmas but this is largely only allowed in English newspapers and permission is not given every year. The advertisements themselves are usually indirect statements. There has been controversy over whether or not the federal government has exerted pressure on Malaysian Christians not to use Christian religious symbols and hymns that specifically mention Jesus Christ.

However, in East Malaysia, which covers northern Borneo, Christmas is a huge celebration due to large number of indigenous people who practise Christianity.

Celebrations in Christian majority districts in the states of Sabah and Sarawak can last until after New Year&#x27;s Day with families and political leaders hosting Open Houses, namely parties which are open to anyone.

Drinking of alcohol is widespread during this period and a call by a Muslim political party to ban alcohol was met with widespread outrage.

==== Philippines ====


Christmas in the Philippines, one of two predominantly Catholic countries in Asia (the other being East Timor), is one of the biggest holidays on the calendar and is widely celebrated. The country has earned the distinction of celebrating the world&#x27;s longest Christmas season, with Christmas carols heard as early as September 1 when the &quot;Ber months&quot; season traditionally begins. The season is officially ushered in by the nine-day dawn masses that start on December 16. Known as the &quot;Misas de Aguinaldo&quot; (&#x27;Gift Masses&#x27;) or &quot;Misa de Gallo&quot; (&#x27;Rooster&#x27;s Mass&#x27;) in the traditional Spanish, these masses are more popularly known in Tagalog as the , and are held in Catholic parishes and chapels nationwide. Usually, aside from the already legal holidays which are Rizal Day (December 30) and New Year&#x27;s Eve (December 31), other days in close proximity such as Christmas Eve (December 24), (December 28), and Epiphany (traditionally, January 6 but now on the first Sunday of January) are also declared non-working days.

As in many East Asian countries, secular Christmas displays are common both in business establishments and in public, including lights, Christmas trees, depictions of Santa Claus despite the tropical climate, and Christmas greetings in various foreign languages and various Philippine languages. Occasionally such displays are left in place even in summer, for example the &quot;parol&quot;, representing the Star of Bethlehem which led the Three Kings to the newborn Baby Jesus.

For Filipinos, Christmas Eve (; ) on December 24 is celebrated with the Midnight Mass, and immediately after, the much-anticipated – the traditional Christmas Eve feast. Family members dine together around 12 midnight on traditional fare, which may include: &quot;queso de bola&quot; (English: &#x27;ball of cheese&#x27;; this is actually edam cheese), (a hot chocolate drink), and &quot;jamón&quot; (Christmas ham), &quot;lechón&quot;, roast chicken or turkey, pasta, (stuffed &quot;bangus&quot; or chicken), &quot;pan de sal&quot;, and various desserts including cakes and the ubiquitous fruit salad. Some also open presents at this time.

On December 31, New Year&#x27;s Eve (; ), Filipino families gather for the or midnight meal – a feast that is also supposed to symbolize their hopes for a prosperous New Year. In spite of the campaign against firecrackers, many Filipinos still see these as the traditional means to greet the New Year. The loud noises and sounds of merrymaking are also supposed to drive away bad spirits. Safer methods of merrymaking include banging on pots and pans and blowing on car horns. Folk beliefs also include encouraging children to jump at the stroke of midnight in the belief that they will grow up tall, displaying circular fruit and wearing clothes with dots and other circular designs to symbolize money, eating twelve grapes at 12 midnight for good luck in the twelve months of the year, and opening windows and doors during the first day of the New Year to let in good luck.

Christmas officially ends on the Feast of the Three Kings ( in Spanish or in Tagalog), also known as the Feast of the Epiphany (Spanish: ). The Feast of the Three Kings was traditionally commemorated on January 6 but is now celebrated on the first Sunday after the New Year. Some children leave their shoes out in the belief that the Three Kings will leave gifts like candy or money inside. But the celebrations do not end there, since 2011, as mandated by the Catholic Church, they are on either the second Sunday of January or Monday after Epiphany in honor of the Lord Jesus&#x27;s baptism in the Jordan (the Solemnity of the Lord&#x27;s Baptism, or in Spanish ). The final salvo of these celebrations is marked by the feast of the Black Nazarene every January 9 in Manila and Cagayan de Oro, but can also, due to the celebrations in honor of the &quot;Santo Niño&quot; on the third and fourth Sundays of January in some places, even extend till the final weeks of that month, or through the first week of February before Valentine’s Day (particularly Candlemas).

==== Singapore ====
Christmas is a public holiday in Singapore that is widely celebrated. The Christmas season is also a popular period for shopping centres and businesses to conduct year-end sales and offer discounts and promotions that tie in with the festivities. The famous Singaporean shopping belt, Orchard Road, as well as the Marina Bay area, feature lights and other decorations from early November till early January. The Christmas light-up and decorated shopping malls along Orchard Road often attract numerous visitors, locals and tourists alike. Other than the light-up, other activities such as caroling, concerts and parades can also be experienced in Orchard Road. In addition, companies in Singapore usually arrange gift exchange programs on the last working day before Christmas.

==== Thailand ====

Christmas is not an official public holiday in Thailand and the majority of the population adheres to Theravada Buddhism, however it is celebrated by the Catholic and Protestant Christians of the country, as well as expats.

==== Vietnam ====
Christmas is not a national holiday but is becoming increasingly popular in Vietnam due to increasing exposure to Western culture and its non-religious glamour and commercial appeal. Vietnamese may be more accepting of corporate influence because for many, Christmas was never based on personal values to begin with. It is not a time to have dinner at home with family and show thanks for one another. Instead, it is a time to go out on the town, shop, and take pictures with friends in front of colorful displays, especially on December 24. This is the second most popular holiday after Vietnamese New Year, which occurs around one month after Christmas.

Christmas is reported to be banned in Vietnam&#x27;s Central Highlands, and in some cases observers have reported harassment by authorities including accusations of &quot;attempting to overthrow&quot; the regime.

=== West Asia ===

==== Armenia ====
Armenians usually celebrate Christmas on January 6. The reason for this unusual date emerges from ancient history. &quot;In the fourth century Roman Catholic Church, officials established the date of Christmas as December 25th.&quot; Before that time, Armenians celebrated Christmas (, , meaning &#x27;Holy Birth&#x27;) on January 6 as a public holiday in Armenia. It also coincides with the Epiphany. The Armenians denied the new Roman mandate regarding Christmas, and continued to celebrate both the Nativity and Jesus&#x27; baptism on January 6. When the Gregorian calendar was implemented in 1582, the Armenians rejected the reformed calendar and continued to follow the Julian Calendar. Today, only the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem still uses the Julian Calendar. Since the Julian calendar is thirteen days behind the Gregorian calendar, when the Armenians of Jerusalem celebrate Christmas on January 6 according to the Julian calendar, the Gregorian calendar counts the day as January 19.

Traditionally, Armenians fast during the week leading up to Christmas, avoiding all meat, eggs, and dairy products. Devout Armenians may even refrain from food for the three days leading up to Christmas Eve in order to receive the Eucharist on a &quot;pure&quot; stomach. Christmas Eve is particularly rich in traditions. Families gather for the Christmas Eve dinner (, ), which generally consists of rice, fish, (, a vegetable dish of green chard and chick peas), and yogurt/wheat soup (, ). Dessert includes dried fruits and nuts, including , which consists of whole shelled walnuts threaded on a string and encased in grape jelly, (a paper-like confection of grape jelly, cornstarch, and flour), etc. This lighter menu is designed to ease the stomach off the week-long fast and prepare it for the rather more substantial Christmas Day dinner. Children take presents of fruits, nuts, and other candies to older relatives. &quot;On the eve of the Feast of the Nativity and Theophany of The Lord Jesus Christ, the Jrakalouyts Divine Liturgy (the lighting of the lamps service) is celebrated in honor of the manifestation of Jesus as the Son of God (theophany)&quot;. In addition to the Christmas tree (, ), Armenians (particularly in the Middle East) also erect the Nativity scene. Christmas in the Armenian tradition is a purely religious affair. Santa Claus does not visit the nice Armenian children on Christmas, but rather on New Year&#x27;s Eve. The idea of Santa Claus existed before the Soviet Union and he was named (), but the Soviet Union had a great impact even on Santa Claus. Now he goes by the more secular name of Grandfather Winter (, ).

==== Assyrians ====
The Assyrians, the indigenous people of northwestern Iran, northern Iraq, northeastern Syria, and southeastern Turkey that belong to the Assyrian Church of the East, Ancient Church of the East, Syriac Orthodox Church, and Chaldean Catholic Church today celebrate Christmas on December 25. Assyrians colloquially call Christmas &quot;Eda Zora&quot;, meaning &#x27;little holiday.&#x27; It is officially called &quot;Eda d&#x27;Yalde&quot; which means &#x27;birthday holiday.&#x27; Traditionally, Assyrians fast (&quot;sawma&quot;) from December 1 until Christmas Day. In Iraq, for instance, on Christmas Eve, Assyrian families congregate outside of their house and hold lighted candles while a child reads aloud the nativity story. Then they all sing psalms over a bonfire made of thorn bushes. Folklore says that if the thorns burn to ashes, the family will have good luck. After the fire has been reduced to ashes, the family members will jump three times over the ashes and make a wish. The next day, on Christmas, &quot;as another bonfire burns in the churchyard, the bishops lead the service while carrying a figure of the baby Jesus. He blesses one person with a touch. That person touches the next person and the touch passes around until all have felt the touch of peace.&quot; Many Assyrians will attend the &quot;Shaharta,&quot; or midnight vigil before Christmas. On Christmas Day, when families gather together after the &quot;Shaharta&quot; or morning mass, &quot;raza d&#x27;mowlada d&#x27;maran,&quot; the fast is broken by eating traditional Assyrian foods such as &quot;pacha/reesh-aqle&quot; (meaning &#x27;from the head to the tail&#x27;), which is a boiled soup made of sheep or cow intestines, tongue, stomach, legs, and spices or &quot;harissa&quot;, a porridge made of ground wheat and chicken (both dishes are prepared usually overnight). These two dishes are only made twice a year: on Christmas and Easter. Traditional desserts eaten after the main course include &quot;killeche&quot;, a date and walnut-stuffed cookie, and &quot;kadeh&quot;, another stuffed pastry. After the feast is finished, Assyrians will visit the houses of family and friends to exchange Christmas greetings, saying, &quot;Eedokhon breekha&quot;, meaning &quot;May your feast be blessed.&quot; There, the host will serve tea, Turkish coffee, and &quot;killeche&quot; and &quot;kadeh&quot; to guests. Although Christmas is celebrated in a much more religious fashion, in recent years, families put up a small Christmas tree in the house.

==== Lebanon ====
Christmas is an official holiday in Lebanon. The Lebanese celebrate Christmas on December 25, except for Armenian Lebanese Christians who celebrate Christmas on January 6 (also an official holiday in Lebanon). Lebanese families come together and butcher a sheep for a Christmas Eve feast in honor of the birth of &quot;the shepherd&quot; Jesus Christ. On that night the head of the house passes around a piece of coal representing the sins before Christ. After the piece of coal has been passed around it is then set on fire. After Dinner, Lebanese Christians attend midnight mass. Santa Claus is known by the French name . Gifts are either dropped off at church or &quot;&quot; makes a personal appearance at the home.

==== Jordan ====

Jordanian Christians observe Christmas on December 25. The Muslim majority of Jordan also take part in Christmas as a holiday, and during this time shops and streets in Jordan are colorfully decorated.

==== Iraq ====
Christmas is celebrated by Christians in Iraq, and in 2018 it was declared an official state holiday for the first time. In recent years, an increasing number of Muslims have also started celebrating Christmas as a secular holiday. Christmas ceremonies are held in one of the world&#x27;s oldest Christian communities by a minority of Chaldeans.

==== Israel and Palestine ====

While Christmas is marked as a religious holiday in the State of Palestine, it is not listed in the official list of holidays in Israel – as it follows the Jewish calendar – but is celebrated by the Christian community in these two countries on its Gregorian Calendar date with focus on its religious significance and the fact that the land of Israel is where the story of Christmas is set as was written in the Bible.

The main focus of celebrations of the holiday is in Bethlehem in the Palestinian controlled-West Bank, just kilometers from Jerusalem, where the Church of the Nativity is located. It is celebrated thrice there:

* December 24 and 25 for the Catholics (Latins), who use the General Roman Calendar (Gregorian), and many Protestants;
* January 6 and 7 for the Greek Orthodox, together with the Syriac Orthodox, Ethiopian and Coptic Orthodox, who use the Julian calendar;
* January 18 and 19 for the Armenian Apostolic Church, which combines the celebration of the Nativity with that of the Baptism of Jesus into the Armenian Feast of Theophany on January 6, according to the early traditions of Eastern Christianity, but follows the rules of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem in its calculations (January 6 Julian style corresponds to January 19 Gregorian style).

Celebrations are held as well in Beit Sahour just meters away by some Protestant churches and other Christians – this town being the traditional site of the Annunciation to the Shepherds. Nazareth, where Mary and Joseph traditionally were, is also another focus for regional celebrations.

==== Saudi Arabia ====
Christmas is not an official holiday in Saudi Arabia. Until around the early 2010s, Christmas was banned in Saudi Arabia as it was and still is considered haram by Islamic authorities. A display of decorations can be found in certain indoor markets and malls.

==== Syria ====
Most Christians in Syria celebrate Christmas on the 25th of December although Armenians generally celebrate on the 6th of January and some other Orthodox Christians on the 7th of January. Christmas has been a public holiday in Syria since 1963.

==== Turkey ====
In Turkey, Christmas is observed mainly by the Eastern Orthodox Christian minority and not the Muslim majority. Though Turkey has no direct link to Christmas, it was home to Saint Nicholas, a 4th-century bishop in Anatolia (then part of the Byzantine Empire) and the inspiration for the folklore of Santa Claus.

==== United Arab Emirates ====
Christmas is not a public holiday in the United Arab Emirates, despite an observance celebrated with a convergence of Emirati culture and a small enclosed westernised population of Christian expats. A display of Christmas decorations, such as trees and figures of Santa Claus are put up after National Day on 2 December and can be seen in certain hotels, shops and malls.

== Europe ==
=== Central Europe ===
In countries of Central Europe (for this purpose, roughly defined as the German-speaking countries of Germany, Austria and Switzerland as well as the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Ukraine and possibly other places) the main celebration date for the general public is Christmas Eve (December 24). The day is usually a fasting day; in some places children are told they will see a golden pig if they hold fast until after dinner. When the evening comes, preparation of Christmas dinner starts. Traditions concerning dinner vary from region to region; for example, in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, the prevailing meal is fried carp with potato salad and fish (or cabbage) soup. However, in some places the tradition is porridge with mushrooms (a modest dish), and elsewhere the dinner is exceptionally rich, with up to 12 dishes. When Christmas comes around, children may receive presents from neighbors and house guests. House pets may also receive gifts.

After the dinner comes the time for gifts. Children usually find their gifts under the Christmas tree, with name stickers. An interesting example of the complicated history of the region is the &quot;fight&quot; between Christmas beings. During communism, when countries of Central Europe were under Soviet influence, communist authorities strongly pushed the Russian &quot;Ded Moroz&quot; (&#x27;Grandfather Frost&#x27;) in the place of Little Jesus. Now Santa Claus is gaining popularity, by means of advertising and Hollywood film production. Many people, Christians as well as people with just a Christian background, go to Roman Catholic Midnight Mass.

Other common attributes of Christmas in Central Europe include Christmas trees, mistletoe, Christmas garlands, and Bethlehem cribs.

In many areas of Central Europe, Saint Nicholas (, , , , , ), or Santa Claus, does not come for Christmas. He visits families earlier, on the dawn of Saint Nicholas Day on December 6, and for the well-behaved children he has presents and candy-bags to put into their well-polished shoes that were set in the windows the previous evening. Although he neither parks his sleigh on rooftops nor climbs chimneys, his visits are usually accompanied by a diabolic-looking servant named Krampusz (in Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia, Krampus; in Czech and Slovak regions he is simply , i.e. &#x27;devil&#x27;, without any name) who gives golden coloured birches for so called badly behaved children. In fact, all children get both gifts and golden birches (Hungarian: ) in their shoes, no matter how they behaved themselves.

==== Austria and Germany ====


In some German-speaking communities, particularly in Catholic regions of western and southern Germany, Switzerland, Austria, South Tyrol and Liechtenstein, as well as in other Catholic regions of Central Europe, the &quot;Christkind&quot; (literally &#x27;Christ child&#x27;) brings the presents on the evening of December 24 (&#x27;Holy Evening&#x27; or ). The Christkind is invisible; thus he is never seen by anyone. However, he rings a bell just before he leaves in order to let children know that the Christmas tree and the presents are ready.

It is a tradition to lavishly decorate a Christmas tree in the days directly before Christmas or on the morning of Christmas Eve. Late on Christmas Eve, after the bell rings, the tree is shown to the children and presents are exchanged.

In Protestant churches, there is a service in the late afternoon intended to immediately precede the Christmas Eve meal and the exchanging of gifts. This service, called , consists most often of scriptural readings, the Christmas Gospel from Luke 2, a (nativity play), favorite Christmas carols and festive music for organ and choirs. In some regions the tradition of &quot;Quempas&quot; singing is still popular. Some Lutheran churches also celebrate a candlelight service at midnight besides the Christmas Vespers in the afternoon or early evening.

Many Catholic churches also have a first Mass of Christmas, called , on about 4 p.m. for the children and parents to attend before the families return home for their meal. The crib is a very important part of the celebrations in Catholic areas, especially Bavaria.

===== Austria =====
In the largely Catholic Austria, Christmas markets are a long-standing tradition. In Vienna, for instance, one of the 20 so-called (sing. ) is held in the large square in front of City Hall. Innsbruck opens its romantic Christmas market in the narrow medieval square at the foot of the Golden Roof. In Salzburg, the Christmas market takes over the square in front of the cathedral with its picturesque stalls, while the tree vendors occupy Residenzplatz on the side of the huge Cathedral. However, almost every small town has its own Christmas market.

In Austria, Christmas trees play a very important part in Christmas celebrations. Every town sets up its own huge tree on the main square all decorated with electric candles, ornaments and various decorations resembling candies or other sweets and frequently there will be an extra one, adorned with breadcrumbs, for the birds. In families the tree is decorated with gold and silver ornaments or stars made out of straw, sweets and candy wrapped in tinfoil, gilded nuts, etc.

The feast of St Nicholas marks the beginning of Christmas in Austria. On Christmas Eve (December 24) the tree is lit for the first time and the whole family gathers to sing Christmas carols like &quot;&quot; (&quot;Silent Night&quot;). Gifts that are placed under the tree are opened after dinner on Christmas Eve. Austrian Christmas tradition has it that it is the Christ Child himself who decorates the Christmas tree on Christmas Eve and brings the children their Christmas presents, and it is to him that their letters and wish lists are addressed in the weeks before Christmas. The Christmas Eve dinner is the main event of the night often served with fried carp. &quot;Vanillekipferl&quot; are a common confectionary served during Christmas time, along with &quot;Zimtsterne&quot;, macaroons, and various kinds of gingerbread.

===== Germany =====


In Germany, Christmas traditions vary by region. Until the Reformation, Saint Nicholas Day was celebrated on December 6, and Saint Nicholas was the main provider of Christmas presents. Nicholas still puts goodies in children&#x27;s shoes on that day. Sometimes Saint Nicholas visits children in kindergarten, schools or at public events. They have to recite a short poem or sing a song in order to get sweets or a small gift. &quot;Knecht Ruprecht&quot; (&#x27;the servant Ruprecht&#x27;) – dressed in dark clothes with devil-like traits (usually noted as a long, bright red tongue and with a stick or a small whip in the hand) – sometimes accompanies St. Nicholas. His duty is to punish those children who have not behaved during the year. Usually he merely stands near Saint Nicholas as a warning to be good and polite. Nikolaus as well for some Glühwein for adults; there are also traditions connected with local firefighters, riders&#x27; associations and church congregations.

The Sorbs, a minority in Saxony and parts of Brandenburg with a language similar to Polish, have some specific traditions; e.g. in Jänschwalde, the or &quot;Janšojski bog&quot; (&#x27;gift child&#x27;), a girl dressed in local costume and veil, visits the neighbors and goes around with two companions the Wednesday before Christmas. Similar to Saint Nicholas, smaller presents like sweets are given and blessings provided; however, she remains silent. Another tradition in Saxony is related to the wooden toymaking in the Ore Mountains, especially Seiffen, which produces Christmas decorations such as the Christmas pyramid as well as toys year-round. Christmas letters may be addressed e.g. to Engelskirchen (&#x27;Angel&#x27;s church&#x27;) or Himmelpforten (&#x27;Heaven&#x27;s gate&#x27;) or other municipalities with similar names. After privatization, Deutsche Post kept the tradition of dedicated Christmas offices, one in each state, answering letters and requests from children.

Currently the actual Christmas gift-giving () usually takes place on Christmas Eve. This tradition was introduced by Reformer Martin Luther, as he was of the opinion that one should put the emphasis on Christ&#x27;s birth and not on a saint&#x27;s day and do away with the connotation that gifts have to be earned by good behavior. The gifts should be seen as a symbol for the gift of God&#x27;s grace in Christ. This tradition quickly became common in predominantly Catholic regions as well.

Gifts may be brought by the (&#x27;Christmas man&#x27;), who resembles either Saint Nicholas or the American Santa Claus, or by &quot;Christkindl&quot;, a sprite-like child who may or may not represent the baby Jesus. Until 1930, there was sort a north–south divide between the realms of the southern and Silesian and the Nordic . After the gifts are opened the children often stay up as late as they like, often till the early hours of the morning.

The Christmas tree is first put up and decorated on the morning of the 24th. The gifts are then placed under the tree. Christmas services in the church serve as well to exchange greetings with neighbors and friends. After an evening meal one of the parents usually goes into the room where the tree is standing, lights the candles and rings a little bell. Then the children are allowed to go into the candlelit room. In many families it is still customary to sing Christmas songs around the tree before opening the presents. Some families attend a midnight church service, , after the evening meal and gift-giving.

The culinary feast either takes place at supper on Christmas Eve or on the first day of Christmas. Traditions vary from region to region; carp is eaten in many parts of the country. Potato salad with frankfurter or wiener sausages is popular in some families. Another simple meal which some families favor, especially in regions where Christmas Eve still has the character of a fast day, is vegetable or pea soup. In some regions, especially in Schleswig-Holstein where Danish influence is noticeable, a roasted duck or goose filled with plums, apples and raisins is family tradition. In other regions, especially in Mecklenburg and Pomerania, many families prefer kale with boiled potatoes, special sausages and ham. Many families have developed new traditions for themselves and eat such meals as meat fondue or raclette. Many families in all parts of Germany bake a wide variety of Christmas cookies according to recipes typical for the family and the region.

 describes the hunting and forestry custom of providing a Christmas tree with food decorated for animals.

==== Czech Republic and Slovakia ====


Christmas Eve (December 24) is celebrated as &quot;/&quot;, which means &#x27;Generous Day&#x27;, and gifts are given in the evening. December 25 and 26 are public holidays in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia, but &quot;/&quot; (Christmas) is most commonly associated with the 24th.

According to tradition, gifts are brought by &quot;/&quot;, or &#x27;Baby Jesus&#x27;. Fish soup and breaded roasted carp with special homemade potato salad are a traditional dish for the dinner. In Slovakia, before eating, everyone exchanges Christmas greetings with each other by sharing a piece of Christmas wafer () with honey and walnuts. The components of a traditional dinner depend on the region, but one common Christmas dinner is cabbage soup () or lentil soup and breaded roasted carp with homemade potato salad or handmade gnocchi with poppy (). The gifts are surreptitiously placed under the Christmas tree (usually a spruce or pine and lately fir), usually just before or during dinner. Children have to wait for the ringing of a Christmas bell, one of the decorations on the Christmas tree – the sign that &quot;/&quot; (little Jesus) has just passed by – to run for the presents. That happens at the end of their Christmas dinner. There is a rich tradition of hard baked Christmas sweets (&quot;/&quot;).

Other Czech and Slovak Christmas traditions involve predictions for the future. Apples are always cut crosswise: if a perfect star appears in the core, the next year will be successful, while a distorted star means a bad year or illness, and a cross may suggest death. Girls throw shoes over their shoulders – if the toe points to the door, the girl will get married soon. Another tradition requires pouring some molten lead into water and guessing a message from its shapes.

In Catholic Slovakia, the tradition of &quot;Jasličkári&quot; involves young men dressed as shepherds or angels visiting their neighbors and presenting recitations and songs about the story of the birth of Jesus.

==== Hungary ====

The Christmas and gift-giving season starts relatively early compared to other cultures, with the Santa-like figure, or Hungarian version of Saint Nicholas, Mikulás (or Szent Miklós) traditionally visiting the homes of Hungarian children on the night of December 5, on the eve of Saint Nicholas Feast Day, December 6.

Although the role of gift-giver on Christmas Day itself is assigned to the Christ Child, on the night before Saint Nicholas Day Hungarian children traditionally place a boot on their windowsill waiting for Mikulás to come by and fill it with treats. In Hungary, celebrations begin with Christmas tree decoration and gift wrapping during the day on December 24; then comes a family dinner with traditional Christmas meals. In some parts of Hungary, a traditional fish soup, , is served at the Christmas Eve meal, although it is also consumed at other times of the year. The day is otherwise a fast day.

In the evening of Christmas Eve, or , the Angel or the Little (Baby) Jesus (Hungarian: or ) delivers the presents. This is the most intimate moment of Christmas, featuring a warmly lit Christmas tree and candles, soft Christmas music, family singing of Christmas or religious songs and gift opening. Nativity plays, called &#x27;playing Bethlehem&#x27; or ) are commonly put on by children and adults. A Christmas crib and a church are used as the scene. The actors go from house to house, and they receive gifts for their performance.

==== Poland ====

In the largely Catholic Poland, Christmas Eve begins with a day of fasting and then a night of feasting. The traditional Christmas meal is known as &quot;Wigilia&quot; (&#x27;The Vigil&#x27;), and being invited to attend a dinner with a family is considered a high honor.
On the night of Christmas Eve, the appearance of the first star in the sky is watched for, in remembrance of the Star of Bethlehem; it has been given the affectionate name of &quot;the little star&quot; or (the female counterpart of Saint Nicholas). On that evening, children watch the sky anxiously hoping to be the first to cry out, &quot;The star has come!&quot; After the appearance of the first star is declared, the family sits down at the dinner table.

According to tradition, bits of hay are spread beneath the tablecloth as a reminder that Christ was born in a manger. Others partake in the practice of placing money under the tablecloth for each guest, in order to wish for prosperity in the coming year. The dinner contains twelve dishes, one for each Apostle. In many homes, an extra place setting is set. The empty setting is symbolically left at the table for a lonely wanderer who may be in need of food, an angel, the Baby Jesus or the Holy Spirit should appear to share the feast.

Before eating, everyone exchanges Christmas greetings with each other. The supper begins with the breaking of the &quot;opłatek&quot; (Christmas wafer), in which everyone at the table breaks off a piece and eats it as a symbol of their unity with Christ. The is usually blessed by the presiding bishop, and stamped with a religious image such as the Nativity scene. A tradition exists among some families to serve twelve different dishes at symbolizing the Twelve Apostles, or perhaps, an odd number of dishes for good luck (usually five, seven, or nine). Some practice the superstition that an even number of people must be seated around the table.

A traditional supper in Poland includes fried carp and &quot;barszcz&quot; (beetroot soup) with &quot;uszka&quot; (translated as &#x27;little ears&#x27;, also known as meatless ravioli). The most common dishes are fish soup, with potato salad, pierogi, &quot;gołąbki&quot; filled with &quot;kasza&quot;, pickled herring and fruit kompot.
Carp provides a main component of the Christmas Eve meal across Poland: carp fillet, carp in aspic etc. Universal Polish Christmas foods are pierogi as well as some herring dishes, herring fillets, herring in aspic and for dessert, &quot;makowiec&quot; or noodles with poppy seeds. Often, there is a compote of dry fruits for a drink. Dishes beside fish are usually cabbage-, forest mushroom- (like &quot;Boletus&quot;) and poppy seed-based, with herring being very important. After supper the Star Man arrives attended by the Star Boys. They are dressed as Wise Men or animals or other figures. The Star Man examines the children in their catechism and rewards them with small presents if they do well, even if they need a bit of coaching. The Star Boys sing carols and are given a treat for their help. The feast begins with the appearance of the first star. The meal is followed by the exchange of gifts.
The remainder of the evening is given to stories and songs around the Christmas tree. In some areas of the country, children are taught that the &quot;Little Star&quot; brings the gifts. As presents are unwrapped, carolers may walk from house to house receiving treats along the way.

Christmas Eve ends with &quot;Pasterka&quot;, the Midnight Mass at the local church. The tradition commemorates the arrival of the Three Wise Men to Bethlehem and their paying of respect and bearing witness to the newborn Messiah. The custom of Christmas night liturgy was introduced in the Christian churches after the second half of the 5th century. In Poland that custom arrived together with the coming of Christianity. The next day (December 25) begins with the early morning mass followed by daytime masses. According to scripture, the Christmas Day masses are interchangeable allowing for greater flexibility in choosing the religious services by individual parishioners.

The following day is often spent visiting friends. The gift bearer varies. In some regions it is (Saint Nicholas), in others gives his gifts on December 6 and the gift bringer of the Christmas Eve is Gwiazdor (&#x27;star man&#x27;), Aniołek (&#x27;little angel&#x27;) or Dzieciątko (&#x27;baby Jesus&#x27;).

==== Romania and Moldova ====


Christmas () in Romania is on December 25 and is generally considered the second most important religious Romanian holiday after Easter. In Moldova, although Christmas is celebrated on December 25 like in Romania, January 7 is also recognized as an official holiday. Celebrations begin with the decoration of the Christmas tree during daytime on December 24, and in the evening (Christmas Eve, Romanian: ) (Father Christmas) delivers the presents.

The singing of carols is a very important part of Romanian Christmas festivities. On the first day of Christmas, many carolers walk through the streets of the towns and villages, holding a star made of cardboard and paper on which are depicted various scenes from the Bible. Romanian tradition has the smallest children going from house to house, singing carols and reciting poems and legends during the whole Christmas season. The leader of the group carries with him a star made of wood, covered with metal foil and decorated with bells and coloured ribbons. An image of the Nativity is painted on the star&#x27;s centre, and this piece of handiwork is attached to the end of a broom or other long stick.

Romanian food served during the holidays is a hearty multi-coursed meal, most of which consists of pork (organs, muscle, and fat). This is mainly a symbolic gesture for St. Ignatius of Antioch.

=== Eastern Europe ===

Since the 1880s, the Christmas customs of the Eastern Slavic countries have included a similar character known as &quot;Ded Moroz&quot; (&#x27;Grandfather Frost&#x27;). According to legend, he travels in a magical &quot;sanki&quot; — a decorated sleigh drawn by reindeer (or three white horses). With his young, blonde assistant &quot;Snegurochka&quot; (the &#x27;Snow Maiden&#x27;, said to be his granddaughter) at his side, he visits homes and gives gifts to good children (not true for former Yugoslavian countries). He only delivers presents to children while they are asleep, and unlike Santa, he does not travel down chimneys, coming instead to the front door of children&#x27;s homes. However, in Russia, children receive presents on New Year&#x27;s Day; Christmas is solely celebrated by Christians and on January 7.

This Ded Moroz is not identified nor in any way associated with Saint Nicholas of Myra (feast day, December 6), who is very widely revered in Eastern Europe for his clerical and charitable works as a bishop. In all likelihood, Ded Moroz is actually in Slavic tradition like Santa Claus, any connection to the original saint having long since disappeared.

==== Georgia ====
On calendars in Georgia, Christmas (, ) is celebrated on January 7 (December 25 on the Julian calendar). It is traditional in Georgia to go on Alilo (a modified pronunciation of &quot;alleluia&quot;), a mass walk in the streets, dressed in special clothing to celebrate and congratulate each other. Most members of the Alilo march are children and they are given sweets by the adults. The Alilo carols vary across the provinces of Georgia. In most songs these words are used: &quot;&quot; () – &#x27;on December 25 Christ was born in Bethlehem&#x27;. A local variant of the Christmas tree, called &quot;chichilaki&quot;, is made of soft wooden material with curled branches. Sometimes it is made of hazelnut branches carved into a Tree of Life-like shape and decorated with fruits and sweets. The Western custom of a Christmas tree () is also popular and has been imported through Russia. The Georgian equivalent of Santa Claus is known as (or in western Georgian dialects), literally meaning &#x27;Grandfather Snow&#x27;, and is traditionally portrayed with long white beard, dressed in chokha, the national costume, and wearing a fur cloak, .

==== Russia ====

As in some other Eastern Orthodox countries, and due to the 13-day difference between the newer Gregorian calendar and the older Julian calendars, Christmas is celebrated on January 7. Unlike its Western counterparts, Christmas is mainly a religious event in Russia. On Christmas Eve (January 6), there are several long services, including the Royal Hours and Vespers combined with the Divine Liturgy. The family will then return home for the traditional Christmas Eve &quot;Holy Supper&quot;, which consists of 12 dishes, one to honor each of the Twelve Apostles. Devout families will then return to church for the or All Night Vigil, or watch the national liturgy on television, which airs from Moscow&#x27;s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. On Christmas morning the – Divine Liturgy of the Nativity – is held, and families return to their local churches to attend. Since 1992 Christmas has become a national holiday in Russia, as part of the ten-day holiday at the start of every new year.

During the Soviet period, religious celebrations were discouraged by the officially atheist state. Christmas trees and related celebrations were gradually eradicated after the October Revolution. In 1935, in a surprising turn of state politics, the Christmas tradition was adopted as part of the secular New Year celebration. These include the decoration of a tree, or (spruce), festive decorations and family gatherings, the visit by gift-giving Ded Moroz ( &#x27;Grandfather Frost&#x27;) and his granddaughter, Snegurochka (, &#x27;the Snow Maiden&#x27;). Many of these were brought to Russia by Peter the Great after his Western travels in the late 17th century. 

Christmas is known as &quot;Quviasukvik&quot; in the federal subject of Chukotka, and is marked by the Chukchi, the Yupik and the Aleut as their New Year on December 24.

==== Ukraine ====

&quot;Sviata Vecheria&quot; or &#x27;Holy Supper&#x27; is the central tradition of the Christmas Eve celebrations in Ukrainian homes and takes place in most parts of the country – from many years on January 6 and from 2022 onwards on December 24. In Western Ukraine, especially in Carpathian Ruthenia, due to historical multi-culturism, until 2023 Christmas can be observed twice—on December 25 and January 7, often irrespective of whether the family belongs to Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the Roman Catholic Church, one of the Ukrainian Orthodox Churches, or one of the Protestant denominations. The Western Ukrainian tradition of two Christmas celebrations, since 2017, is also celebrated nationwide as well, however the traditions in the western regions, given the Russian invasion of Ukraine, would be standardized in 2022 for celebrations within the whole of the nation – and with the date finally unified in 2023 the Western Ukrainian form has become the official standard.

When the children see the first star in the eastern evening sky, which symbolizes the trek of the Three Wise Men, the may begin. In farming communities the head of the household now brings in a sheaf of wheat called the which represents the importance of the ancient and rich wheat crops of Ukraine, the staff of life through the centuries. means literally &#x27;grandfather spirit&#x27; and symbolizes the family&#x27;s ancestors. In city homes a few stalks of golden wheat in a vase are often used to decorate the table. The dinner table sometimes has a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in Bethlehem. A prayer is said and the father says the traditional Christmas greeting, , &#x27;Christ is born!&#x27;, which is answered by the family with which means &#x27;Let us glorify him!&#x27;. In some families the Old Slavic form is used. At the end of the the family often sings Ukrainian Christmas carols. In many communities the old Ukrainian tradition of caroling is carried on by groups of young people and members of organizations and churches calling at homes and collecting donations, a tradition carried on abroad by the diaspora. In many places, the caroling is resumed after the Christmas Eve vigil services.

Traditionally, Christmas Day opens for Ukrainian families with attendance in church services (Mass, worship service or Divine Liturgy). Ukrainian churches offer services starting before midnight on both Christmas Eve and on Christmas morning. Christmas supper, without Lenten restrictions, does not have as many traditions connected with it as . The old tradition in Ukraine of giving gifts to children on Saint Nicholas Day, December 6, has generally been replaced by the Christmas date and it is Father Frost who visits all the children in a sleigh pulled by only three reindeer instead of the 8 or 9 seen in the West during the holiday period.

=== Northern Europe ===
In much of Northern Europe, Christmas is celebrated on December 24 and is referred to as &quot;jul&quot; (see Yule), while December 25 is a relaxed day for visiting relatives. &quot;Yule&quot; may come from the Norse word , , meaning &#x27;wheel&#x27;, and Old English . The Norse believed that the Sun was a great wheel of fire that rolled towards and then away from the Earth.

==== Denmark ====

Danes celebrate on December 24, which is referred to as (literally &#x27;Yule evening&#x27;). An evening meal with the family consists of either roast pork, roast duck or roast goose and eaten with potatoes, plenty of gravy, and red cabbage or finely chopped kale boiled in butter. Caramelized potatoes are also an important part of the Danish Christmas dinner. For dessert rice pudding is traditionally served – composed largely of whipped cream and accompanied by lashings of black cherry sauce. The rice pudding also contains chopped peeled almonds, and a single whole peeled almond. Whoever finds the whole almond will have good luck for the coming year, and the lucky finder is entitled to a small gift, .
After the meal is complete, the family gathers around the Christmas tree and sings Christmas songs and hymns while holding hands and dancing in circles, and may even tour the house, still holding hands and singing. When the singing is complete, traditions vary. In some traditions, the family will select one child to hand out the presents. All children take turns handing out presents in other traditions.
Alternatively &quot;Santa Claus&quot;, &quot;Julemanden&quot;, will appear at the door in full costume with a large sack of presents over his shoulder. He will then distribute the presents, with the assistance of any children present, to their recipients. He should be offered suitable drink to keep him warm and cheerful on his onward journey, but do not expect loquacity – utterances are normally limited to loud and hearty laughs. Meanwhile, the presents are opened and this is followed by more snacks, candy, chips and, sometimes, a traditional Christmas drink called &quot;gløgg.&quot;

The Danish are somewhat famous for their (pl. )&quot;,&quot; literally meaning &#x27;Christmas lunch&#x27;, which includes various traditional Danish dishes, potentially accompanied by beer and snaps. These are popular and held within families, as well as by companies and other social groups. They would traditionally have taken place leading up to Christmas, but due to time constraints and stress during the Christmas month they are nowadays commonly held during November and January as well. The family , however, are normally held on Christmas Day and/or the Second day of Christmas (December 26).

Another more recent Danish tradition is the concept of television , special Christmas-themed, advent calendar-type television programmes with a daily episode shown on each of the first 24 days of December, thus culminating on &quot;&quot;. Several television stations produce their own, most, but not all of which are targeted at child viewers. Some of the television advent calendars become extremely popular and go on to be reprised in subsequent years.

In Denmark, Santa Claus is known as (literally &#x27;the Yule Man&#x27;) and is said to arrive in a sleigh drawn by reindeer, with presents for the children. He is assisted with his Yuletide chores by elves known as (or simply ), who are traditionally believed to live in attics, barns or similar places. In some traditions, to maintain the favor and protection of these , children leave out saucers of milk or rice pudding or other treats for them and are delighted to find the food gone on Christmas morning.

==== Estonia ====
In the weeks preceding Christmas or , children place a slipper in their windows and receive a piece of candy or some other sweets from visiting elves (). Estonians celebrate Christmas on December 24, which is referred to as (&#x27;Christmas Saturday&#x27;) and is by act of Parliament a public holiday in Estonia. Each year on this day, the President of Estonia declares the Christmas Peace and attends a Christmas service. The tradition was initiated by the order of Queen Christina of Sweden in the 17th century. Estonian children are visited by &quot;jõuluvana&quot; (&#x27;Santa Claus&#x27;) on Christmas Eve, and must sing songs or recite Christmas poems before receiving their gifts.

The evening meal typically includes pork with sauerkraut or Estonian sauerkraut with pork and barley (), baked potatoes, white and blood sausage, potato salad with red beet, and pâté. For dessert, Estonians eat gingerbread () and marzipan. The most highly regarded drinks during this time have been beer and mulled wine or &quot;glögi&quot; and (&#x27;glowing wine&#x27;). Estonians leave the leftover food from Christmas dinner on the table overnight, in hopes that the spirits of family, friends, and loved ones will visit and also have something to eat. It is also customary to visit graveyards and leave candles for the deceased.

December 25 or is a relaxed day for visiting relatives.

==== Finland ====


Christmas is an extensively prepared celebration centering on the family and home, although it has a religious dimension also. The Christmas season starts from December or even in late November, when shops began advertising potential Christmas gifts. Christmas decorations and songs become more prominent as Christmas nears, and children count days to Christmas with Advent calendars. Schools and some other places have the day before Christmas Eve (, December 23) as a holiday, but at the latest on Christmas Eve (, December 24), shops close early and stay closed until December 26. The main Christmas festivities are held on Christmas Eve on December 24, while Christmas Day () and the following day (, &#x27;St. Stephen&#x27;s Day&#x27;) are mandatory public holidays in Finland. Schools continue holidays up to the New Year.

The Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. It is a custom in many towns and cities. The most famous one of these declarations is on the Old Great Square of Turku, the former capital of Finland, at noon on Christmas Eve. It is broadcast on Finnish radio (since 1935) and television, and nowadays also in some foreign countries. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn (Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God&quot;) by a band of the Finnish Navy and a male choir and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll, in both Finnish and Swedish, the country&#x27;s two official languages:

: Tomorrow, God willing, is the most gracious feast of the birth of our Lord and Saviour, and therefore a general Christmas peace is hereby declared, and all persons are directed to observe this holiday with due reverence and otherwise quietly and peacefully to conduct themselves, for whosoever breaks this peace and disturbs the Christmas holiday by any unlawful or improper conduct shall be liable, under aggravating circumstances, to whatever penalty is prescribed by law and decree for each particular offence or misdemeanor. Finally, all citizens are wished a joyous Christmas holiday.

The ceremony ends with the Finnish national anthem &quot;Maamme&quot; and &quot;Porilaisten marssi&quot; played by the band, with the crowd usually singing when the band plays . Recently, there is also a declaration of Christmas peace for forest animals in many cities and municipalities, so there is no hunting during Christmas.

Finnish people clean their homes well before Christmas and prepare special treats for the festive season. A sheaf of grain, nuts and seeds are tied on a pole, which is placed in the garden for the birds to feed on. Spruce trees are cut or bought from a market and taken to homes on or a few days before Christmas Eve and are decorated. Candles are lit on the Christmas tree, which is traditionally decorated using apples and other fruit, candies, paper flags, cotton and tinsel, in addition to Christmas ornaments such as stars or baubles. Actual candles are no longer used, being replaced by incandescent or LED lamps. A star symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem is placed at the top of the tree. Just before the Christmas festivities begin, people usually take a Christmas sauna. The tradition is very old; unlike on normal days, when one would go to the sauna in the evening, on Christmas Eve it is done before sunset. This tradition is based on a pre-20th century belief that the spirits of the dead return and have a sauna at the usual sauna hours.

Afterwards, they dress up in clean clothes for the Christmas dinner or &quot;joulupöytä&quot;, which is usually served between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., or traditionally with the appearance of the first star in the sky. The most traditional dish of the Finnish Christmas dinner is probably Christmas ham, roast suckling pig or a roasted fresh ham, but some may prefer alternatives like turkey. Several sorts of casseroles, like rutabaga, carrot and potato casserole are traditional, and are almost always exclusively served on Christmas. Other traditional Christmas dishes include boiled codfish (soaked beforehand in a lye solution for a week to soften it) served snowy white and fluffy, pickled herring and vegetables. Prune jam pastries, plum or mixed fruit soup, rice porridge with cinnamon, sugar and cold milk, and sweets like chocolate are popular desserts. Christmas gifts are usually exchanged after Christmas Eve dinner. Children do not hang up stockings in Finland but &quot;Joulupukki&quot; visits the household, maybe with a &quot;tonttu&quot; to help him distribute the presents.

Christmas Day services begin early at six in the morning and people visit families and reunions are arranged on this day.

Boxing Day, or &quot;&quot; (Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day) is traditionally set aside for driving around the village (), to counterbalance the solemn and family-oriented part of Christmas.

==== Iceland ====
The Christmas or Yule (&quot;Jól&quot; in Icelandic) celebration in Iceland starts four Sundays before Christmas proper, which begins on December 24 (Advent) and ends thirteen days later on January 6. Traditionally, one candle is lit each Sunday until four candles are lit on the 24th. At 6:00 pm church bells ring to start the Christmas celebration. The religiously observant and/or traditional Icelanders will attend mass at this time while the secular Icelanders will begin their holiday meal immediately. After the meal is finished, they open gifts and spend the evening together. In Iceland people over the Yule holidays most often eat smoked lamb, ptarmigan and turkey. Pork is also very popular.

Thirteen days before December 24, children will leave their shoes by the window so that the Yule Lads can leave small gifts in their shoes. The Yule Lads are the sons of two trolls living in the Icelandic mountains. Each of the Yule Lads is known for a different kind of mischief (for example slamming doors, stealing meat, stealing milk or stealing the candles). The Yule Lads traditionally wear early Icelandic wool clothing but are now known for the more recognizable red and white suit.

Each home typically sets up a Christmas tree indoors in the living room with most decorating it on December 11. In addition to the decorations, presents are put underneath the tree. It is also a tradition in many homes to boil skate on the 23rd. The day is called Saint Thorlak Mass ().

During the holiday season, it is traditional for families to work together to bake small cookies to serve or give to guests. Most common are thin gingerbread cookies which are decorated in many different colors of glaze. Many families also follow the tradition of making (&#x27;leafbread&#x27;), which is a flat thin bread that is cut out using a special tool and folding technique.

The end of year is divided between two days – the Old Year&#x27;s Day () and the New Year&#x27;s Day (). At the night of the former and morning of the latter Icelanders shoot up fireworks blowing the old year away and welcoming the new one.

Thirteen days after the 24th Icelanders say goodbye to the Yule Lads and other mystical creatures such as elves and trolls. There are bonfires held throughout the country while the elves, Yule Lads, and Icelanders dance together before saying goodbye until the next Christmas.

==== Norway ====


The major day of celebration in Norway, as in most of Northern Europe, is December 24. Although it is legally a regular workday until 4:00 p.m., most stores close early. Church bells chime in the Christmas holiday between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. In some families, the Christmas story from Luke 2 will be read from the old family Bible. The main Christmas meal is served in the evening. Common main dishes include pork rib, &quot;pinnekjøtt&quot; (pieces of lamb rib steamed on a grid of birch wood). Many people also eat lutefisk or fresh, poached cod. Rice porridge is also popular (but most commonly served as an early lunch rather than for the main Christmas dinner), an almond is often hidden in the porridge, and the person who finds it wins a treat or small gift. In some parts of Norway it is common to place porridge outside (in a barn, outhouse or even in the forest) to please . In many families, where the parents grew up with different traditions, two different main dishes are served to please everyone. If children are present (and they have behaved well the last year), (Santa Claus) pays a visit, otherwise gifts are stored under the Christmas tree.

For a lot of Norwegians, especially families, television is an important part of the earlier hours of Christmas Eve. Many Norwegians do not feel the Christmas spirit until they have watched the Czech-German fairy tale &quot;Three Wishes for Cinderella&quot; (Norwegian title: ), the Disney Christmas cavalcade &quot;From All of Us to All of You&quot; the Norwegian fairytale movie &quot;Reisen til Julestjernen&quot; or the comedy sketch &quot;Dinner for One&quot;, known in Norway as (The Countess and the Butler) and which is broadcast on (little Christmas Eve, December 23). Attending one of the many stage productions of &quot;Putti Plutti Pott and Santa&#x27;s Beard&quot; is also a very popular tradition.

December 25 is a very quiet and relaxed day. Church services are well attended. The old tradition of a very early morning service before breakfast has been replaced in most areas by a service in the later morning. Afterward, many families get together for a large festive meal.

December 26 is also a day of many festivities. Cinemas, night clubs and bars are full, and there are many private gatherings and parties, where all kinds of traditional Christmas cookies and sweets are enjoyed. Fatty, tasty dinners are also part of it. The time between Boxing Day and New Year&#x27;s Eve is called &quot;romjul&quot;. During this time children in some parts of Norway dress up as and – &#x27;Christmas goat&#x27; – in their neighborhoods and sing Christmas carols to receive treats, much the same way as in the American Halloween. January 6 (the 13th day of Christmas) is commonly regarded as the end of Christmas, while some end Christmas on the 20th day, and some even at Candlemas.

==== Sweden ====



The pre-Christian holiday of Yule, or &quot;jól&quot;, was the most important holiday in Scandinavia and Northern Europe. Originally the observance of the winter solstice, and the rebirth of the sun, it brought about many practices that remain in the Advent and Christmas celebrations today. The Yule season was a time for feasting, drinking, gift-giving, and gatherings, but also the season of awareness and fear of the forces of the dark. Swedish Christmas celebrations begin with the first of Advent. Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day (locally known as ) is the first major Christmas celebration before Christmas itself. The eldest daughter arising early and wearing her Lucy garb of white robe, red sash, and a wire crown covered with whortleberry-twigs with nine lighted candles fastened in it awakens the family, singing &quot;Santa Lucia&quot;, serving them coffee and saffron buns (St. Lucia buns), thus ushering in the Christmas season.

Schools elect students to play the part of Lucia and her maids, and a national Lucia is elected on national television from regional winners. The regional Lucias will visit shopping malls, old people&#x27;s homes and churches, singing and handing out , gingerbread cookies.

Boys take part in the procession as well, playing different roles associated with Christmas. Some may be dressed in the same kind of white robe, but with a cone-shaped hat decorated with golden stars, called (&#x27;star boys&#x27;); some may be dressed up as &quot;tomtenissar&quot;, carrying lanterns; and some may be dressed up as gingerbread men. They participate in the singing and also have a song or two of their own, usually , which tells the story about Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr, caring for his five horses.
Electric candles and glowing stars are placed in almost every window in the month of December in Sweden. Although December 25 () is a Swedish public holiday, December 24 is the day when Santa Claus (or simply &quot;Tomte&quot;) brings the presents. Although not a public holiday, Christmas Eve is a &quot;de facto&quot; holiday in the sense that most workplaces are closed, and those who work, for instance in shops or care homes, get extra wages as a compensation.

The was originally a small invisible Christmas house gnome or dwarf from Nordic mythology, who watched over the house and its inhabitants. An old superstition still calls for feeding the on Christmas Eve with a small bowl of porridge. If a bowl of porridge is not laid out for him somewhere in or outside the house, he will bring bad luck to everyone in the house the next year. The modern is a version of Santa Claus in red clothes and white beard, except that he does not enter the house through the chimney, but knocks on the door and asks &quot;&quot; (&#x27;are there any nice children here?&#x27;)

Christmas is, as everywhere else, an occasion celebrated with food. Almost all Swedish families celebrate on December 24 with a Christmas table, called Christmas smörgåsbord (&quot;julbord&quot;), a display of several Christmas food items. Almost all have Christmas ham, (&quot;julskinka&quot;) accompanied by other Christmas dishes, such as small s, pickled herring, spareribs, small hot dogs, lutfisk, pork sausage, salmon, Janssons frestelse (potato casserole with anchovy), and rice pudding. The Christmas is served with julmust and beverages like mulled wine, Christmas beer or snaps. A Scandinavian speciality is the &quot;glögg&quot; (mulled and spiced wine with almonds and raisins), which is served hot in small cups. The different dishes of the may vary throughout Sweden, from south to north. Businesses traditionally invite their employees to a dinner or lunch in the weeks before Christmas, and people go out privately to restaurants which also customarily offer julbord during December.

Examples of candies and treats associated with Christmas are marzipan, toffee, &quot;knäck&quot; (quite similar to butterscotch), nuts and fruits: figs, chocolate, dates and oranges decorated with cloves.

Television also plays a big role, many families watch the Disney Christmas special (&quot;From All of Us to All of You&quot;), &quot;Karl Bertil Jonssons julafton&quot; (animated short), or a re-run of the &quot;Svensson, Svensson&quot; episode &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Merry Christmas&#x27;) on the TV channel SVT1.

After the on December 24, the presents are distributed, either by or a family member, and usually from a sack or from under the Christmas tree where they have been lying all day or for several days.

Many Swedes still adhere to the tradition that each present should have a rhyme written on the wrapping paper, to hint at the contents without revealing them.

In older days a yule goat was an alternative to ; nowadays it is used as an ornament, ranging from sizes of to huge constructions like the giant straw Christmas Gävle goat, famous for frequently being vandalized or burnt down. If one has two families to celebrate Christmas with, it is common that one of the families move their celebrations to Christmas Day or the day before Christmas Eve (commonly referred to as &quot;little Christmas Eve&quot;).

After December 24, the Christmas celebrations have more or less come to an end. Some people attend the julottan, an early morning church service on December 25. This particular service was the main service of Christmas historically—nowadays, the Midnight Mass has become increasingly popular. Others attend a simpler service called &quot;Christmas Prayer&quot; in the afternoon of Christmas Eve; however, many Swedes do not attend church at all during Christmas as the country is very secular. Even so, most families do set up a (&#x27;Christmas Crib&#x27;). On January 13 (locally known as or &#x27;twentieth-day Christmas&#x27;), 20 days after Christmas, the Christmas celebrations come to an end and all Christmas decorations are removed.

=== Southern Europe ===

==== Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia ====
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, Christmas (, ) is celebrated mainly as a religious holiday. The festivities begin on Saint Nicholas&#x27;s Day on December 6 (in Slovenia) or Saint Lucy&#x27;s on December 13 depending on what region (in Croatia). Saint Lucy or Saint Nicholas brings children presents, and Saint Nicholas is said to be accompanied by Krampus who steals away the presents of bad children. This &quot;anti-Santa&quot; is said to have one cloven hoof, a handful of heavy chains, and a sack on his back to collect naughty children. In Croatia on Saint Lucy&#x27;s, families will plant wheat seeds in a bowl of shallow water, which will grow several inches by Christmas and are then tied together with a red, blue and white ribbon called &quot;.&quot;

On Christmas Eve (, (&#x27;holy eve&#x27;)), three candles representing the Trinity are lit and placed in the middle of the wheat; the glow symbolizes the soul of each person. On this day, the tree is decorated, the home is decked with greenery and the women prepare the Christmas meal. They also bake special types of bread: one is round inscribed with a cross on top known as the , another is made with honey, nuts and dried fruit called the Christmas Eve Bread (, ). In many villages, straw (which symbolizes Christ&#x27;s birth in the manger) is spread around the floors of the home for the Christmas Eve dinner. As is customary with Catholic people, meat is not consumed in Croatia, while in Slovenia it is. Instead of meat in Croatia and with other food in Slovenia, salad and fish is served, many choosing to eat the Dalmatian specialty , dried cod fish. The family then sprinkle holy water on their Yule log () which they light and watch. In villages, the is freshly cut that very morning by the father of the household while reciting traditional prayers. At the end of the meal, a piece of the &quot;&quot; is cut and dipped in wine and used to sprinkle on the candles to extinguish them, while reciting the Trinitarian formula (&quot;In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen&quot;).

Many families will go to a midnight mass on Christmas Eve and often another on Christmas Day. It is common for Christmas presents to be placed under the tree, to suggest that the Angel or the Baby Jesus () leaves them there while others are attending midnight mass. Presents are opened after the mass. Christmas is a day of celebrating with family; a large feast is prepared and traditional foods such as stuffed cabbage, turkey, pot roast, pita and smoked meat are served, along with various desserts such as &quot;fritule&quot;, potica (especially in Slovenia), strudel, and cookies.

Slovenes are also visited by another one of their (&#x27;three good men&#x27;), who bring presents in December: Saint Nicholas, Santa Claus and Dedek Mraz (&#x27;Grandfather Frost&#x27;). Families mostly celebrate New Year&#x27;s Eve at home with extended family members, friends, and sometimes neighbors. Women prepare cabbage sarma, which they will eat on January 1 to symbolize good fortune, and steak tartare, which they eat on New Year&#x27;s Eve on toast with butter. At midnight, people go outdoors to watch fireworks, while Dedek Mraz leaves presents under the tree. Epiphany on January 6 marks the end of the Christmas season.

==== Bulgaria ====
In Bulgaria, Christmas (, &quot;Koleda&quot; or more formally , , &#x27;Nativity of Jesus&#x27;) is celebrated on December 25 and is preceded by Christmas Eve (, ). Traditionally, Christmas Eve would be the climax of the Nativity Fast, and thus only an odd number of lenten dishes are presented on that evening. The table is usually not cleared after the dinner and until the next morning, to leave some food for the holy spirits – a custom which probably comes from pagan pre-Christian times. On that day, a Bulgarian budnik is set alight. On Christmas, however, meat dishes are already allowed and are typically served.

Among the Bulgarian Christmas traditions is &quot;koleduvane&quot;, which involves boy carolers (, ) visiting the neighboring houses starting at midnight on Christmas Eve, wishing health, wealth and happiness. Another custom is the baking of a traditional round loaf (, &quot;pita&quot;). The pita is broken into pieces by the head of the family and a piece is given to each family member, a valuable possession, and a piece for God. A coin is hidden inside the pita and whoever gets the coin will have luck, health, and prosperity in the coming year.

As in other countries, a Christmas tree is typically set up and the entire house is decorated. The local name of Santa Claus is (, &#x27;Grandfather Christmas&#x27;), with Dyado Mraz (, &#x27;Grandfather Frost&#x27;) being a similar Russian-imported character lacking the Christian connotations and thus popular during the Communist rule. However, it has been largely forgotten after 1989, when Dyado Koleda again returned as the more popular figure.

==== Greece and Cyprus ====
The festive period lasts from November 30 to January 6 (Epiphany) on the Greek calendar. December 25 and 26 are public holidays in Greece. In Greek, Christmas is known as &#x27; () and people wish Merry Christmas to each other, saying &#x27; (). Most families set up Christmas trees and shops have decorations and lights. Presents are placed under the Christmas tree and are opened on January 1, St Basil&#x27;s Day. In Greek tradition, St Basil of Caesarea is identified with Father Christmas, visiting children and giving presents; in other European traditions, Father Christmas is Saint Nicholas, and comes at Christmas. Christmas carols (Κάλαντα Χριστουγέννων /Κάλαντα Πρωτοχρονιάς) are sung by children who knock on doors very early in the morning on Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve to sing the carols (using the «τρίγωνο», a metallic triangular small instrument) and are compensated by sweets or money. The Christmas meal usually includes turkey, but may also include lamb or pork and desserts such as &quot;kourabies&quot; () and &quot;melomakarono&quot; (). Other Christmas and New Year foods include baklava, &quot;kataifi&quot; (pastry), and &quot;thiples&quot; (a kind of fried pastry).
On December 23 and 24 Christmas, brioches are made with a cross in the middle, and &quot; (, &#x27;egg rolls&#x27;), which are subsequently offered to the elderly and children. Children sing carols from house to house either before or on Christmas Day. People go to church early on Christmas morning, on December 25. Christmas morning after church, pork dishes and wine are served. Pork dishes are a hallmark of Greek Christmas, and the main meal of Christmas dinner takes place at noon. In many Greek cities and ports like Thessaloniki, Volos, Patra, and the Greek Islands, boats are decorated with Christmas decorations, and a large Christmas tree is decorated in many city and town central squares.

Some of the Christmas festivals in Greece are &quot; (), where all the residents of the city of Kastoria are delivered in a separate Dionysian revelry, accompanied by folk melodies and traditional music of the area.

==== Italy ====



Christmas in Italy (, ) begins on December 8, with the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the day on which traditionally the Christmas tree is mounted and ends on January 6, of the following year with the Epiphany (). The Italian term derives from the Latin , which literally means &#x27;birth&#x27;, and the greetings in Italian are (Merry Christmas) and (Happy Christmas).

The Feast of the Immaculate Conception () on December 8 is a national holiday in Italy. Christmas decorations, including the &quot;presepe&quot; (nativity scene), as well as the Christmas tree, are usually put up on this day. Some modern takes on this holiday involve them hanging vultures to symbolize the cleaning of their spirits.

Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day () is celebrated as a Catholic holiday in Sicily and the northern regions of Italy on the supposed shortest day of the year, which is December 13. Saint Lucy (Santa Lucia) is the patron saint of the city of Syracuse. Evening candlelight processions called the Parade of Light are conducted and are followed by the Feast of Saint Lucy. Sicilians pay tribute to a miracle performed by St. Lucy during a famine in 1582. At that time, she brought a flotilla of grain-bearing ships to starving Sicily, whose citizens cooked and ate the wheat without taking time to grind it into flour. Thus, on Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day, Sicilians do not eat anything made with wheat flour. Instead they eat cooked wheat called &quot;cuccìa&quot;.

Christmas is celebrated in Italy in a similar fashion to other Western European countries, with a strong emphasis given to the Christian meaning of the holiday and its celebration by the Catholic Church, also reinforced by the still widespread tradition of setting up the , a tradition initiated by Saint Francis of Assisi. It is quite common to attend Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve and practice the old custom of abstinence from meat on the day (but not fasting, which is observed by the Eastern Orthodox.) 

A popular Christmas Day dish in Naples and in Southern Italy is female eel or , which is a female eel. A traditional Christmas Day dish from Northern Italy is capon (gelded chicken). Abbacchio is more common in Central Italy. The Christmas Day dinner traditionally consists by typical Italian Christmas dishes, such as agnolini, cappelletti, Pavese agnolotti, capon, lamb, eel, panettone, pandoro, torrone, panforte, struffoli, mustacciuoli, bisciola, cavallucci, veneziana, pizzelle, zelten, or others, depending on the regional cuisine. Christmas on the 25th is celebrated with a family lunch, also consisting of different types of pasta and meat dishes, cheese and local sweets.

The ancient Christmas festival called Ndocciata is celebrated on December 8 and Christmas Eve in Agnone, Molise, with a parade of torches leading up to the &quot;Bonfire of Brotherhood&quot;. On Christmas Eve, in the squares of many towns of eastern Sicily, a large bonfire, , is lit to warm the Baby Jesus.

Traditions regarding the exchanging of gifts vary from region to region, as this might take place either on Christmas Eve or on Christmas Day. Presents for children are left underneath the Christmas tree either by Santa Claus (called &quot;Babbo Natale&quot;) or, according to older traditions, by Baby Jesus himself. In some regions children receive gifts earlier (at Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day) or later (on Epiphany).

In 1991, the Gubbio Christmas Tree, 650 meters high and decorated with over 700 lights, entered the Guinness Book of Records as the tallest Christmas tree in the world. December 26, (Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day, in Italian ), is also a public holiday in Italy. Festivities extend to the end of the year and then to the Epiphany.

In Italy, Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day became a public holiday in 1947, where previously it was a normal working day; the Catholic Church also celebrates it as a religious holiday, even if not as a precept, as it is in Germany and other German-speaking countries. The reason for the public holiday in Italy, not required by the Catholic Church despite the fame of the saint, is to be found in the intention of prolonging the Christmas holiday, creating two consecutive public holidays, which also happens in the case of Easter Monday, a non-religious holiday, but which only wants to lengthen Easter. Before 1947 the two days were working days, with banks and offices open.

On January 6 (Epiphany, in Italian ) decorations are usually taken down, and in some areas female puppets are burned on a pyre (called &quot;falò&quot;), to symbolize, along with the end of the Christmas period, the death of the old year and the beginning of a new one.
While gifts are now given at Christmas by an American-style Santa Claus as well, Italy holds fast to its tradition of native gift-givers. On the eve of the 6th, la Befana, the good Epiphany witch, is thought to ride the night skies on broomstick, bringing good children gifts and sweets, and bad ones charcoal or bags of ashes. In other areas it is the Three Wise Men who bring gifts, especially oranges symbolizing gold, and chocolate symbolizing their kisses to good children. In some municipalities, most famously in Milan, the custom of the (Three Kings&#x27; Procession) is elaborately celebrated with a parade welcoming the Wise Men, and the passing out of sweets. In other places such as Treviso, the day is celebrated with bonfires, the sparks of which are said to predict the future of the new year.

==== Malta ====
Christmas in Malta is a vibrant celebration that beautifully blends deep-rooted religious customs with joyful community festivities. The island’s rich cultural heritage shines through its unique traditions, which bring families and communities together during the season. 

; Nativity Cribs and Decorations
: One of the most cherished traditions in Malta during Christmas is the creation of elaborate nativity cribs (presepju). Families take great pride in crafting these displays, which often feature intricate scenes depicting the birth of Jesus. These cribs can be found in homes, churches, and public spaces, showcasing not only the Holy Family but also a variety of local characters and landscapes. Many cribs incorporate natural elements like moss and stones, and some even include moving parts or lights. The tradition of displaying a crib dates back to the 18th century and has become a central symbol of Maltese Christmas.
; Midnight Mass and Religious Celebrations
: Attending Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve is a significant event for many Maltese families. This solemn yet joyous service is often filled with beautiful hymns and prayers, culminating in the celebration of the Eucharist. A unique feature of the Mass is the Priedka tat-Tifel, where a child delivers a sermon, emphasizing innocence and purity. Following the Mass, families often gather to share festive meals and enjoy each other’s company, reinforcing the spirit of community and togetherness that defines the holiday season.
; Festive Foods and Sweets
: Food plays a vital role in Maltese Christmas celebrations, with families preparing a variety of traditional dishes. One popular dish is roasted capon, often served alongside seasonal vegetables. Sweet treats are also abundant, including qagħaq tal-għasel (honey rings) and kwareżimal, a spiced almond pastry typically enjoyed during Lent but also popular at Christmas. Another favorite is imqaret, deep-fried date-filled pastries that are a must-have during the festive season. These culinary delights not only satisfy the palate but also bring families together as they share recipes and cooking traditions passed down through generations.
; Community Celebrations and Processions
: In addition to family gatherings, Christmas in Malta is marked by vibrant community celebrations. Streets are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, creating a festive atmosphere throughout towns and villages. Processions featuring statues of Baby Jesus are common, drawing crowds who come to witness this beautiful display of faith and tradition. Local choirs often perform carols, adding to the joyful ambiance. These communal events foster a sense of belonging and highlight the importance of celebrating together as a community during this special time of year.

==== Portugal ====
An official holiday in Portugal, Christmas is widely celebrated and associated with family gatherings. Many who have moved to the urban centers of Lisbon or Porto, along with many who have emigrated to other countries, still travel to their hometown to spend Christmas Eve with their families. Before the (&#x27;Rooster&#x27;s Mass&#x27;) that celebrates the birth of Christ, families gather around the , the late supper held on Christmas Eve. The traditional dish is (dried codfish boiled with vegetables), although, in northern Portugal, the bacalhau is often replaced by octopus. The Christmas dinner usually ends with (golden slices), &quot;filhós&quot;, and (dreams), all variations of fried dough desserts. The traditional cake (king cake) is served on Epiphany. Although Santa Claus () is increasingly more popular, in some regions people still attest that (Baby Jesus) brings presents to children.

==== Serbia and Montenegro ====

In Serbia and Montenegro, Christmas (, or more formally ) is celebrated for three consecutive days, beginning with Christmas Day. The Serbian Orthodox Church uses the traditional Julian calendar, per which Christmas Day (December 25) falls on January 7. This day is called the first day of Christmas, and the following two are accordingly called the second, and the third day of Christmas. During this festive time, one is to greet another person with &quot;Christ is Born&quot; (), which should be responded with &quot;Truly He is Born&quot; (). The Serbian name for Christmas, , means &#x27;young, little God&#x27;.

This holiday surpasses all the others celebrated by Serbs, with respect to the diversity of applied folk customs and rituals. These may vary from region to region, some of them having modern versions adapted to the contemporary way of living. The ideal environment to carry them out fully is the traditional multi-generation country household.

In the morning of Christmas Eve a young, straight oak tree is selected and felled by the head of the household. A log is cut from it and is referred to as the &quot;badnjak&quot;. In the evening, the is ceremoniously put on the domestic fire that burns in the house&#x27;s fireplace called , whose hearth is without a vertical surround. The burning of the &#x27; is accompanied by prayers to God so that the coming year may bring much happiness, love, good fortune, riches, and food. Since most houses today have no &#x27; on which to burn a &quot;&quot;, it is symbolically represented by several leaved oak twigs. For the convenience of city dwellers, they can be bought at marketplaces or received in churches.

The dinner on this day is festive, copious and diverse in food, although it is prepared in accordance with the rules of fasting. Groups of young people go from house to house of their village or neighborhood, congratulating each other, singing, and making performances; this continues through the next three days. The Serbs also take a bundle of straw into the house and spread it over the floor, and then put walnuts on it. Before the table is served for dinner, it is strewn with a thin layer of straw and covered with a white cloth. The head of household makes the Sign of the Cross, lights a candle, and censes the whole house. The family members sit down at the table, but before tucking in they all rise and a man or boy among them says a prayer, or they together sing the troparion of the Nativity. After the dinner young people visit their friends, a group of whom may gather at the house of one of them. Christmas and other songs are sung, while the elderly narrate stories from the olden times.

On Christmas Day, the celebration is announced at dawn by church bells and by shooting. A big importance is given to the first visit a family receives that day. People expect that it will summon prosperity and well-being for their household in the ensuing year; this visit is often pre-arranged. Christmas dinner is the most celebratory meal a family has during a year. A special, festive loaf of bread is baked for this occasion. The main course is roast pork which is cooked whole by rotating it impaled on a wooden spit close to an open fire. Even though gift-giving is not necessarily a part of the tradition, a Santa Claus-inspired character called (translated as &#x27;Christmas friend&#x27;) sometimes takes his part in gift-giving, as Santa Claus is more traditionally connected to New Year&#x27;s celebrations. Gift-giving is, nevertheless, connected with the celebrations, being traditionally done on the three consecutive Sundays that immediately precede it. Children, women, and men, respectively, are the set gift-givers on these three days.

Since the early 1990s, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve. The course of these celebrations can be typically divided into three parts: the preparation, the ritual, and the festivity. The preparation consists of going and cutting down the tree to be used as the &#x27;, taking it to the churchyard, and preparing drink and food for the assembled parishioners. The ritual includes Vespers, placing the &#x27; on the open fire built in the churchyard, blessing or consecrating the &#x27;, and an appropriate program with songs and recitals. In some parishes they build the fire on which to burn the &#x27; not in the churchyard but at some other suitable location in their town or village. The festivity consists of getting together around the fire and socializing. Each particular celebration, however, has its own specificities which reflect traditions of the local community, and other local factors.

In Serbia, Montenegro and North Macedonia Christmas is celebrated on January 7. This is a result of their Orthodox Churches commemorating Christmas Day based on the Julian calendar, which is now 13 days behind the Revised Julian calendar (the other calendar used by certain Eastern Orthodox Churches, which is equivalent to the Gregorian calendar until 2100.)

==== Spain ====
Christmas is an officially recognized holiday in Spain. In most of Spain, the Christmas period () lasts from Christmas Eve (, that is, &#x27;Good Night&#x27;) on December 24 to Epiphany on January 6. Many homes and most churches display a Nativity scene, a Christmas tree, or both. The or (Nativity scene) has a long tradition and is present in many homes, schools and stores, while the Christmas tree is not traditional, but it has become very popular. In Catalonia on the 26th, (Saint Stephen) is celebrated with a family gathering.

In most of Spain (though not in a few areas, such as Catalonia), a large family dinner is celebrated on Christmas Eve () and can last until late in the night. There is a wide variety of typical foods one might find on plates across Spain on this particular night, and each region has its own distinct specialties. It is particularly common to start the meal with a seafood dish such as prawns or salmon, followed by a bowl of hot, homemade soup. The main meal will often consist of roast lamb, or seafood, such as cod or shellfish. For dessert, there is quite a spread of delicacies, among them &quot;turrón&quot;, a dessert made of honey, egg and almonds. Special dishes and desserts include shellfish and fish, marzipan, turkey with truffles, and &quot;polvorones&quot; (shortbread made of almonds, flour and sugar).

Even though there is still the traditional &quot;Misa del Gallo&quot; at midnight, few Spaniards continue to follow the old custom of attending.

In most of Spain, Christmas day was not associated with presents for children until recently; instead, the Three Magi brought the presents on the night of January 5, as they still do. Now children often receive some presents on Christmas Day or Christmas Eve, brought by (&#x27;Father Noel&#x27;), which is a non-traditional version of Santa Claus, as depicted in U.S. media, but in some regions there are other more traditional characters, for example, the Olentzero in the Basque Country.

In the evening of December 31 () there is also a large family feast. At 12:00 am on January 1 is very famous in Spain eat the Twelve Grapes (). Young people typically go out to a , a very big feast in bars and pubs, and they drink and dance until the next morning, when it is common to have churros with chocolate for breakfast. 

In the evening of January 5 a huge public parade or cavalcade () welcomes the Three Magi in the major cities of Spain. The parades are often televised. Children put their shoes in a balcony or window on the night of January 5 in the hope that the Three Wise Men will deliver them presents.

=== Western Europe ===

==== France and other French-speaking areas ====

Christmas in France ( on the French calendar) is celebrated mainly in a religious manner, though secular ways of celebrating the occasion also exist, such as Christmas decorations and carols. Children do not hang Christmas stockings but put their shoes by the fireplace or under the Christmas tree so (Father Christmas or Santa Claus) can give them gifts (a practice also among French-speaking Switzerland). Some families also attend Midnight Mass and decorate their homes with Nativity scenes depicting the birth of Jesus. Additional (&#x27;little saints&#x27;) may be added in the nativity scenes.

In France and in other French-speaking areas (see also Canada section), a long family dinner, called a &quot;réveillon&quot;, is held on Christmas Eve. The name of this dinner is based on the word (meaning &#x27;waking&#x27;), because participation involves staying awake until midnight and beyond. is generally of an exceptional or luxurious nature. Appetizers may include lobster, oysters, escargots or foie gras, etc. One traditional dish is turkey with chestnuts. in Quebec will often include some variety of &quot;tourtière&quot;. Dessert may consist of a &quot;bûche de Noël&quot;. In Provence, the tradition of the 13 desserts is followed, almost invariably including (a flavoured bread), dates, etc. Quality wine is usually consumed at such dinners, often with champagne or similar sparkling wines as a conclusion. Christmas carols may also be sung.

In Belgium (see also Flanders section), the monarch gives a televised speech to the nation on New Year&#x27;s Eve, in which the year&#x27;s national and international events are addressed, usually ending with a message of hope.

==== United Kingdom ====

In the United Kingdom Christmas decorations are put up in shops and town centres from early November. Many towns and cities have a public event involving a local or regional celebrity to mark the switching on of Christmas lights. Decorations in people&#x27;s homes are commonly put up from early December, traditionally including a Christmas tree, cards, and lights both inside and outside the home. Every year, Norway donates a giant Christmas tree for the British to raise in Trafalgar Square as a thank you for helping during the Second World War. Christmas carolers at Trafalgar Square in London sing around the tree on various evenings up until Christmas Eve and Christmas decorations are traditionally left up until the evening of January 5 (the night before Epiphany); it is considered bad luck to have Christmas decorations up after this date. In practice, many Christmas traditions, such as the playing of Christmas music, largely stop after Christmas Day.

Mince pies are traditionally sold during the festive season and are a popular food for Christmas. It is common in many UK households for children and adults to put up advent calendars in their homes, which may either contain chocolates or Christmas scenes behind their doors.

A common feature of the Christmas season is the Nativity play which is practiced in most primary and some secondary schools across the UK. This practice is becoming less common, and other plays may be performed instead with less overt religious tones. Midnight Mass is also celebrated by Anglicans, Catholics, and other denominations, and services take place in nearly all Church of England parishes on Christmas Eve.

On Christmas Eve, presents are supposedly delivered in stockings and under the Christmas tree by Father Christmas, who previously had been something like the Ghost of Christmas Present in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843), but who has now become mainly conflated with Santa Claus. The two names are now used interchangeably and are equally known to British people, though some distinctive features still remain. Many families tell their children stories about Father Christmas and his reindeer. One tradition is to put out a plate of carrots for the reindeer, and mince pies and sherry for Father Christmas to help him on his way.

The majority of families open their presents on the morning of Christmas Day, the Royal family being a notable exception, as they open their gifts on Christmas Eve, following German tradition introduced by the Hanoverians. Queen Victoria as a child made note of it in her diary for Christmas Eve 1832; the delighted 13-year-old princess wrote, &quot;After dinner ... we then went into the drawing-room near the dining-room ... There were two large round tables on which were placed two trees hung with lights and sugar ornaments. All the presents being placed round the trees..&quot;. Since the first commercial Christmas card was produced in London in 1843, cards are sent in the weeks leading up to Christmas, many of which contain the English festive greeting &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;.

On Christmas Day, a public holiday in the United Kingdom, nearly the whole population has the day off to be with their family and friends, so they can gather round for a traditional Christmas dinner, traditionally comprising a turkey with cranberries, brussels sprouts, parsnips, Yorkshire pudding and roast potatoes, quite like the Sunday roast, and followed by a Christmas pudding. During the meal, Christmas crackers, containing toys, jokes, and a paper hat are pulled. Attendance at a Christmas Day church service has become less popular in modern times, with fewer than 3 million now attending a Christmas Day Church of England service.

Television is widely watched. The monarch releases a royal message on Christmas Day, in the form of a short programme carried on radio and television. The messages typically reflect on topics such as the year&#x27;s events, the state of the royal family, and themes such as unity. The message averages 7 million viewers, and is often one of the most-watched programmes of the day on Christmas. The monarch&#x27;s speech, writes J.M. Golby and A.W. Purdue, has &quot;come to represent the unity of the nation at Christmas time&quot;.
The celebration of Boxing Day, on the day after Christmas Day, is a tradition practiced in the UK. It is a bank holiday, and if it happens to fall on a weekend then a special Bank Holiday Monday will occur. Top-level football competitions such as the Premier League have traditionally held fixtures on Boxing Day.

Other traditions include carol singing – many carols are sung by children on people&#x27;s doorsteps and by professional choirs – and sending Christmas cards. In public, there are decorations and lights in most shops, especially in town centres, and even in Indian and Chinese restaurants. Churches and cathedrals across the country hold masses, with many people going to midnight mass or a service on Christmas morning. Even though church attendance has been falling over the decades some people who do not go to church often think it is still important to go at Christmas, so Church attendance increases. Most theatres have a tradition of putting on a Christmas pantomime for children. The pantomime stories are traditionally based on popular children&#x27;s stories such as &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; and &quot;Aladdin&quot;, rather than being directly concerned with Christmas as such, although there is sometimes a link.

Public transport and vital transport services are closed-down on Christmas Day. The Christmas wind-down starts early, with last trains running out of the major cities as early as 19:00 on December 24. Bus, night bus, and underground services are also unavailable from about 21:00 hours. Individual transport companies start making announcements as early as October, and while one train operating company may choose to run no trains on Boxing Day another may run a limited Saturday service but totally close major stations.

===== England =====
In England, telling ghost stories, local legends, and other strange, bizarre, and fantastic &quot;winter stories&quot; (as Charles Dickens – author of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; – termed them) is a centuries-old tradition, to which William Shakespeare contributed with &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1623) but which was well known even before Shakespeare&#x27;s time. (In contrast, Ireland, Scotland, and the USA favor Halloween as a time for telling ghostly tales.) Colin Fleming details other contributors to this tradition in the &quot;Paris Review&quot;.

===== Wales =====
Wales has a tradition of singing &quot;caneuon plygain&quot;, which is done on the week before Christmas day.

===== Scotland =====
Christmas in Scotland was traditionally observed very quietly, because the Church of Scotland never placed much emphasis on the Christmas festival. However, in Catholic areas people would attend Midnight Mass or early morning mass before going to work. This tradition derives from the Church of Scotland&#x27;s origins including St Columba&#x27;s monastic tradition, under which every day is God&#x27;s day and there is none more special than another; thus Good Friday is not an official public holiday in Scotland. 
Christmas Day was commonly a normal working day in Scotland until the 1960s, and even into the 1970s in some areas. The New Year&#x27;s Eve festivity, Hogmanay, was by far the largest celebration in Scotland. The gift-giving, public holidays and feasting associated with mid-winter were traditionally held between December 11 and January 6. However, since the 1980s, the fading of the Church&#x27;s influence and the increased influences from the rest of the UK and elsewhere mean that Christmas and its related festivities have now surpassed Hogmanay and Ne&#x27;erday, New Year&#x27;s Day. The capital city of Edinburgh now has a traditional German Christmas market from late November until Christmas Eve and on the first Sunday in Advent a Nativity scene is blessed by the Cardinal Archbishop in the main square. Bannock cakes made of oatmeal are traditionally eaten at Christmas.

==== Ireland ====

Christmas in Ireland is the largest celebration of the Irish public holidays and lasts from December 24 to January 6, although many view December 8, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception as being the start of the season, as schools used to close on this day, making it a traditional Christmas shopping time. This is no longer compulsory and many schools stay open.

Almost the entire workforce is finished by lunchtime on Christmas Eve, or often a few days beforehand. Christmas Day and Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day are public holidays, and many people do not return to work until after New Year&#x27;s Day. In 2006, the total amount spent in Ireland to celebrate Christmas was €16 billion, which averages at approximately €4,000 for every single person in the country.

It is extremely popular on Christmas Eve to go for &quot;the Christmas drink&quot; in the local pub, where regular punters are usually offered a Christmas drink. Many neighbours and friends attend each other&#x27;s houses for Christmas drinks and parties on the days leading up to and after Christmas Day. Although religious devotion in Ireland today is considerably less than it used to be, there are huge attendances at religious services for Christmas Day, with Midnight Mass a popular choice. Most families arrange for their deceased relatives to be prayed for at these masses as it is a time of remembering the dead in Ireland. It is traditional to decorate graves at Christmas with a wreath made of holly and ivy. Even in the most undevout of homes in Ireland the traditional crib takes centre stage along with the Christmas tree as part of the family&#x27;s decorations. Some people light candles to signify symbolic hospitality for Mary and Joseph. Therefore, it is usual to see a white candle, or candle set, placed in several windows around people&#x27;s homes. The candle was a way of saying there was room for Jesus&#x27;s parents in these homes even if there was none in Bethlehem. It is traditional to leave a mince pie and a bottle or a glass of Guinness for Santa Claus along with a carrot for Rudolph on Christmas Eve.

Santa Claus, often known in Ireland simply as Santy or in Irish, brings presents to children in Ireland, which are opened on Christmas morning. Family and friends also give each other gifts at Christmas. The traditional Christmas dinner consists of turkey or goose and ham with a selection of vegetables and a variety of potatoes. Dessert includes Christmas pudding, Christmas cake, and mince pies with rich sauces such as brandy butter.

Christmas celebrations in Ireland finish with the celebration of Little Christmas also known as in Irish on January 6. This festival, which coincides with Epiphany, is also known as &quot;Women&#x27;s Christmas&quot; in Cork and Kerry.

==== Netherlands and Flanders ====
Christmas traditions in the Netherlands are almost the same as those in Dutch-speaking parts of Belgium (Flanders). The Dutch recognize two days of Christmas as public holidays in the Netherlands, calling December 25 (&#x27;first Christmas day&#x27;) and December 26 (&#x27;second Christmas day&#x27;). In families, it is customary to spend these days with either side of the family.

In Catholic parts of the country, it used to be common to attend Christmas Eve Midnight Mass; this custom is upheld, but mostly by the elder generation and by fewer people every year. Christmas Eve is these days a rather normal evening without any special gatherings or meals. On Christmas Day, throughout both Flanders and the Netherlands elaborate meals are prepared by the host or together as a family. It is also common to have meals where each guest prepares and brings one dish.

Christmas decorations start appearing in stores right after Sinterklaas. The week before Christmas is important to the retail trade because it is the biggest sales week in the country. Christmas songs are heard everywhere. The cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Eindhoven are the busiest cities in terms of entertainment on Christmas Day. Traditionally, people in the Netherlands and Flanders do not exchange gifts on Christmas, since this is already done during a separate holiday (Sinterklaas) a few weeks before Christmas. However, more and more people have in the 2000s and 2010s started to give presents on Christmas as well, possibly under the influence of commerce and from other countries where Christmas is celebrated with many presents (notably the US). In the north/east, the West Low German part of the Netherlands, some people will blow the Midwinter horns from Advent until Epiphany.

The Christmas season wraps up after the new year with Epiphany, or , on January 6. Children, especially in the north of the Netherlands, dress up as the Three Wise Men and travel in groups of three carrying lanterns, re-enacting the Epiphany and singing traditional songs for their hosts. In return they are rewarded with cakes and sweets. This practice is less common south of the great rivers. In the south and east of the Netherlands it is common practice to burn the Christmas trees of the community on a big pile on January 6 to celebrate the end of Christmas and the start of the new year.

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===
In Australia, as with all of the Southern Hemisphere, Christmas occurs during the height of the summer season. Christmas Day and Boxing Day (December 25–26) are recognized as national public holidays in Australia, and workers are therefore entitled to a day off with pay.

The Australian traditions and decorations are quite similar to those of the United Kingdom and North America, and similar wintry iconography is commonplace. This means a red fur-coated Santa Claus riding a sleigh, carols such as &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, and various snow-covered Christmas scenes on Christmas cards and decorations appear in the middle of summer. There have also been depictions of Christmas traditions tailored to Australian iconography, such as Santa partaking in activities such as surfing (in 2015, a world record was set on Bondi Beach for the world&#x27;s largest surf lesson, featuring 320 participants in Santa suits), parodies of traditional carols, and original songs such as Rolf Harris&#x27;s &quot;Six White Boomers&quot; (which depicts Santa Claus as using a ute pulled by kangaroos instead of reindeer and a sleigh).
A notable Christmas event in Australia is &quot;Carols by Candlelight&quot;—an annual concert and charity appeal benefiting the charity Vision Australia.

=== Fiji ===
=== Guam ===
Christmas is a public holiday in Guam and has its difference from traditional customs. 

The period of the holiday season to Christmas in Guam is celebrated with a fiesta. The celebration involves the annual Magof Nochebuena Peace Festival with a display of colourful lights and nativity scenes. A special tradition is the coconut Christmas tree, towering over 6 metres and made up of a thousand coconuts, painted by local community members.

=== New Zealand ===

Christmas Day and Boxing Day are both statutory holidays in New Zealand. While Boxing Day is a standard statutory holiday, Christmas Day is one of the three-and-a-half days of the year where all but the most essential businesses and services must close. Many of New Zealand&#x27;s Christmas traditions are similar to those of Australia in that they are a mix of United Kingdom and North American traditions conducted in summer. New Zealand celebrates Christmas with very little traditional Northern Hemisphere winter imagery. The pohutukawa (&quot;Metrosideros excelsa&quot;), which produces large crimson flowers in December, is an often used symbol for Christmas in New Zealand, and subsequently the pohutukawa has become known as the &quot;New Zealand Christmas tree&quot;.

=== Vanuatu ===
In Vanuatu, Christmas is a tropical affair, celebrated by a predominant community of Christians. The holiday is known as Bonane and involves traditional celebrations, including catchups with friends and family in their villages and the performance of religious songs in choirs.

<text>A rudraksha (IAST: &quot;&quot;) refers to the dried stones or seeds of the genus &quot;Elaeocarpus&quot; specifically, &quot;Elaeocarpus ganitrus&quot;. These stones serve as prayer beads for Hindus (especially Shaivas) and Buddhists. When they are ripe, &quot;rudraksha&quot; stones are covered by a blue outer fruit so they are sometimes called &quot;blueberry beads

The stones are associated with the Hindu deity Shiva and are commonly worn for protection and for chanting mantras such as Om Namah Shivaya (; ). They are primarily sourced from India, Indonesia, and Nepal for jewellery and malas (garlands) and valued similarly to semi-precious stones. &quot;Rudraksha&quot; can have up to twenty one &quot;faces&quot; (, ) or locules – naturally ingrained longitudinal lines which divide the stone into segments. Each face represents a particular deity.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Rudraksha&quot; is a Sanskrit compound word consisting of &quot;Rudra&quot;() referring to Shiva and &quot;&#x27;&quot;() meaning &quot;eye&quot;. Sanskrit dictionaries translate &#x27; () as eyes, as do many prominent Hindus such as Sivaya Subramuniyaswami and Kamal Narayan Seetha; accordingly, &quot;rudraksha&quot; may be interpreted as meaning &quot;Eye of Rudra&quot;.

== Description ==

=== Rudraksha tree ===
Of the 300 species of &quot;Elaeocarpus&quot;, 35 are found in India. The principal species of this genus is &quot;Elaeocarpus ganitrus&quot;, which has the common name of &quot;&quot;rudraksha&quot; tree&quot;, and is found from the Gangetic plain in the foothills of the Himalayas to Nepal, South and Southeast Asia, parts of Australia, Guam, and Hawaii.

These tree species typically found at higher altitudes, primarily in the Himalayan region, has become scarce in India due to its previous use in making railway sleepers. The finest quality seeds originate from specific altitudes in the Himalayas, where the soil, atmosphere, and environmental factors contribute to their unique vibration.

&quot;Elaeocarpus ganitrus&quot; trees grow to . They are evergreen trees which grow quickly, and as they mature their roots form buttresses, rising up near the trunk and radiating out along the surface of the ground.

=== Fruit ===

The &quot;rudraksha&quot; tree starts bearing drupes (fruit) in three to four years from germination. It yields between 1,000 and 2,000 fruits annually. These fruits are commonly called &quot;&quot;rudraksha&quot; fruit&quot;, but are also known as &quot;amritaphala&quot; (fruits of ambrosia).

The pyrena of the fruit, commonly called the &quot;pit&quot; or &quot;stone&quot;, is typically divided into multiple segments by seed-bearing locules. When the fruit is fully ripe, the stones are covered with a blue outer fleshy husk of inedible fruit. The blue colour is not derived from a pigment but is due to structural colouration. &quot;Rudraksha&quot; beads are sometimes called &quot;blueberry beads&quot; in reference to the blue colour of the fruit.

==== Chemical composition ====
&quot;Rudraksha&quot; fruits contain alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, steroids, triterpenes, carbohydrates, and cardiac glycosides. They also contain rudrakine, an alkaloid which had been discovered in &quot;rudraksha&quot; fruit in 1979.

=== Types of &quot;rudraksha&quot; beads ===

&quot;Rudraksha&quot; beads are described as having a number of facets or &quot;faces&quot; (&quot;mukha/mukhi&quot;) which are separated by a line or cleft along the bead. Typically, these beads possess between 1 and 21 faces, although instances of rudrakshas with up to 26–27 faces have been reported, albeit rarely. Those with a single face (&quot;ekamukha&quot;) are the rarest. A rudraskha with eleven faces is worn by renunciants, those who are married wear a two-faced bead and a five-faced bead is representative of Hanuman. Similarly different faces of rudrakshas are related with different deities and planets astrologically such as 2 faces associated with Moon, 3 faces with Mars, 4 faces with Mercury, 5 faces with Jupiter, 7 faces with Saturn and so on. Rudrakshas from Nepal are between and those from Indonesia are between . Rudraksha beads are most often brown, although white, red, yellow, or black bead may also be found.
Many types of stone are described. A savar is a type of rudraksha bead that is naturally conjoined, or attached to another bead. &quot;Gauri Shankar&quot; refers to two beads which are naturally conjoined. &quot;Ganesha&quot; refers to beads which have a trunk-like protrusion on their bodies. &quot;Trijuti&quot; refers to three beads that are naturally conjoined. Other rare types include &quot;veda&quot; (4 conjoined savars) and &quot;dvaita&quot; (2 conjoined savars).

== Uses ==

=== Religious uses in Indian-origin religions ===
The &quot;rudraksha&quot; is sacred to and popularly worn by devotees of Shiva. 
&quot;Rudraksha&quot; beads may be strung together as beads on a garland (&quot;&quot;) which can be worn around the neck. The beads are commonly strung on silk, or on a black or red cotton thread. Less often, jewellers use copper, silver or gold wires. The &quot;rudraksha&quot; beads may be damaged if strung too tightly. The Devi Bhagavata Purana describes the preparation of &quot;rudraksha&quot; garlands.

Hindus often use &quot;rudraksha&quot; garlands aids to prayer and meditation, and to sanctify the mind, body, and soul, much as Christians use prayer beads and rosaries to count repetitions of prayer. There is a long tradition of wearing 108 &quot;rudraksha&quot; beads in India, particularly within Shaivism, due to their association with Shiva, who wears &quot;rudraksha&quot; garlands. Most garlands contain 108 beads &quot;plus one&quot; because as 108 is considered sacred and a suitable number of times to recite a short mantra. The number 108 is sacred in many spiritual traditions, symbolising the universe’s completeness. The extra bead, which is called the &quot;meru&quot;, , or &quot;guru bead&quot;, helps mark the beginning and end of a cycle of 108 and has symbolic value as a &#x27;principle&#x27; bead. &quot;Rudraksha&quot; garlands usually contain beads in combinations 27+1, 54+1, or 108+1. The mantra Om Namah Shivaya, associated with Shiva, is often chosen for repetitions (&quot;japa&quot;) using &quot;rudraksha&quot; beads.

== History ==

=== In Hindu religious texts ===

==== Upanishads ====
Several late-medieval Upanishads describe the construction, wearing, and use &quot;rudraksha&quot; garlands as well as their mythological origin as the tears of Rudra.



==== Tirumurai ====
Like the Upanishads, the &quot;Tirumurai&quot; describes the wearing of &quot;rudraksha&quot; garlands and their use as prayer beads for chanting mantras. Accordingly, the Tirumurai identifies wearing a pair of rudraksha garlands as a sign of piety.

== Cultivation ==

=== Herbal and sacred groves ===

Ch. Devi Lal Rudraksha Vatika, is a grove dedicated to &quot;rudraksha&quot; which also has over 400 endangered ayurvedic medicinal herbs in Yamunanagar district of Haryana state in India.

&quot;Rudraksha&quot; is primarily cultivated in the foothills of the Himalayas, mainly in Nepal and India. The most popular varieties of &quot;rudraksha&quot; are found in the regions of Kathmandu, around Arun Valley Region in Nepal and Kulu, and Rameshwaram in India. There are several naturally occurring trees of &quot;rudraksha&quot;s in the alpine forests of Dhauladhar and lower Shivalik ranges of the Himalayas.

Groves are mostly found in Uttarakhand state of India.

<text>Blake Sennett (born September 22, 1973) is an American musician and actor who served as the lead guitarist for indie rock band Rilo Kiley, as well as the lead singer/lead guitarist for his alt-rock side project the Elected. Until 2017 he led Night Terrors of 1927 with Jarrod Gorbel. In addition to being a musician, Sennett was a teen actor, appearing on the television shows &quot;Salute Your Shorts&quot; and &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;. As an actor, Sennett originally went by the names Blake Soper and Blake Swendson.

== Early years ==
Sennett was born Blake Sennett Swendson in San Diego. He attended La Jolla High School with his future Rilo Kiley bandmate Pierre De Reeder. He met Rilo Kiley bandmate Jenny Lewis through Tara Subkoff in 1993. The two formed the band in 1998 and dated for several years, until ending their relationship after the release of &quot;The Execution of All Things&quot; in 2002.

In the early to mid-1990s, Sennett appeared in television shows primarily marketed toward teens. During this period he ended up playing two big supporting roles of Ronnie Pinsky on &quot;Salute Your Shorts&quot; and Joseph &quot;Joey the Rat&quot; Epstein on &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;. After &quot;Salute Your Shorts&quot; was canceled and his role on &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; was written off, Sennett switched gears and began to focus on music.

== Music ==
In the early 1990s, when Sennett was in high school, he played drums in a band called the Caustic Truth. Future Rilo Kiley bassist Pierre De Reeder was his bandmate. Sennett was kicked out of the band, and the remaining members kept his drums.

In 1996, he composed the score for the film &quot;Don&#x27;s Plum&quot;. Lewis was the female lead in the film. Because of a lawsuit brought by stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire, this film cannot be distributed in the United States or Canada. However, it was released in 2001 in Europe as a Region 2 DVD. This version contains Sennett&#x27;s original score, as well as the song &quot;Go Ahead,&quot; written by Sennett and Jenny Lewis in 1996. The song was included on Rilo Kiley&#x27;s first LP, Take-Offs and Landings (2001). Sennett has remained good friends with Maguire, Ethan Suplee, and Scott Bloom since the making of the film. He had previously starred with Ben Savage and Suplee on &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;.

In 2003, he founded a second band, the Elected, along with his good friend Mike Bloom.

In 2012, Blake Sennett founded Night Terrors of 1927 along with Jarrod Gorbel. The band released an EP titled &quot;Guilty Pleas&quot; in November 2013.

<text>The Manhattan School of Music (MSM) is a private music conservatory in New York City. The school offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees in the areas of classical and jazz performance and composition, as well as a bachelor&#x27;s in musical theatre.

Founded in 1917, the school is located on Claremont Avenue in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of New York City, adjacent to Broadway and West 122nd Street (Seminary Row). The MSM campus was originally the home to The Institute of Musical Art (which later became Juilliard) until Juilliard moved to the Lincoln Center area of Midtown Manhattan. The property was originally owned by the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum until The Institute of Musical Art purchased it in 1910. The campus of Columbia University is close by, where it has been since 1895. Many of the students live in the school&#x27;s residence hall, Andersen Hall.

==History==
===20th century===

Manhattan School of Music was founded between 1917 and 1918 by the pianist and philanthropist Janet D. Schenck. It was initially known as the &quot;Neighborhood Music School&quot;. Initially located at the Union Settlement Association on East 104th Street in Manhattan&#x27;s East Harlem neighborhood, the school moved into a brownstone building at East 105th Street. Pablo Casals and Harold Bauer were among the first of many distinguished artists who offered guidance to the school. Eventually, its name was changed to Manhattan School of Music.

In 1943, the artistic and academic growth of the school resulted in a charter amendment to grant the bachelor of music degree. Two subsequent amendments authorized the offering in 1947 of the master of music degree and, in 1974, the degree of doctor of musical arts. In 1956, Dr. Schenck retired and Metropolitan Opera baritone John Brownlee was appointed director, a title later revised to president. President Brownlee initiated the idea of relocating the school to the Morningside Heights neighborhood; his death occurred only months before his efforts were realized. In 1969, George Schick, Metropolitan Opera conductor, accompanist, and opera coach, succeeded Brownlee as president and led the school&#x27;s move to its present location. He created the opera program, while all other major school functions were managed by Senior Director Stanley Bednar.

John O. Crosby, founder and general director of the Santa Fe Opera, was appointed president in 1976. He was followed by Gideon W. Waldrop, who was appointed in 1986, and Peter C. Simon in 1989. On July 1, 1992, Marta Casals Istomin was named president, a position which she held until October 2005 when she retired.

Robert Sirota, former director of the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University, took over the presidency in 2005. He was succeeded by James Gandre, formerly of Roosevelt University, effective May 2013.

After a contentious union certification battle in 2009, the Precollege Faculty established ARTS-MSM, In 2012, nearly three years after the formation of the union, the school and union had not reached a collective bargaining agreement, leading to a leafletting campaign during the conservatory&#x27;s audition period that was accompanied by Scabby, the large inflatable rat frequently displayed by New York City labor unions to draw attention to allegedly unscrupulous employers. In 2024, the administration and union once again failed to reach a collective bargaining agreement.

==Performance venues==
Manhattan School contains multiple performance spaces, each dedicated to separate ensemble requirements. The largest is Neidorff-Karpati Hall, where all orchestral and large jazz ensemble concerts are held. Major renovation of the Hall was completed in November 2018.

<text>Uri Orlev (; 24 February 1931 – 26 July 2022) born Jerzy Henryk Orłowski, was a Polish-born Israeli children&#x27;s author and translator. He received the Hans Christian Andersen Award in 1996 for his &quot;lasting contribution to children&#x27;s literature&quot;, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Prize for Hebrew Literary Works in 1972 and the Bialik Prize for literature in 2006.

==Biography==
Uri Orlev was born in 1931 in Warsaw, Poland, the son of a physician. During World War II, his father was taken captive by the Russians and he lived with his mother in the Warsaw Ghetto until she was killed by the Nazis. A relative hid him and his brother in the ghetto until he was caught by the Germans and deported to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1943. As a prisoner in Bergen-Belsen, he wrote and recited poetry which would later be published by Yad Vashem in 2005. He survived the Holocaust and was liberated by the British Army in 1945. He and his brother emigrated to Israel and were placed in kibbutz Ginegar. They were joined by their father in 1954. After finishing high school on the kibbutz, Orlev served in the Israel Defense Forces as an infantryman. Upon completing his regular military service, Orlev returned to the kibbutz and began working in the cowsheds. He continued to serve as a reservist and subsequently fought in the Suez Crisis, Six-Day War, and Yom Kippur War.

While living and working at Ginegar, Orlev began imagining short stories. He typically spent his weekends travelling to and from Haifa to watch movies there along with a German-born kibbutznik named Shlomo. During their bus rides, Orlev told Shlomo his stories, who urged him to write them down. After writing a rough draft, Orlev was granted permission by the kibbutz to spend a year with the family of Eliyahu Soloveitchik, a man he&#x27;d met in Bergen-Belsen who was living near Haifa. While there, he continued writing his manuscript, which would become his book &quot;The Lead Soldiers&quot;. He returned to Ginegar where he resumed his cowshed work and had the book published in 1956.

In 1968, Orlev and his family moved to the Yemin Moshe neighborhood of Jerusalem. He began writing children&#x27;s literature as a profession and ended up publishing over 30 books, which are often biographical, about his childhood during the Holocaust or his early years in Israel, and from an accessible perspective for children. His books have been translated from Hebrew into 36 languages. Among his more famous works are &quot;Run, Boy, Run&quot;, &quot;The Island on Bird Street&quot; and &quot;The Lead Soldiers&quot;.

He was also a translator of Polish literature into Hebrew, such as &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; by Henryk Sienkiewicz.

Orlev appeared in the documentary film &quot;Life is Strange&quot; where he was interviewed about his books and life before World War II.

Orlev was twice married and had two sons, a daughter, and four grandchildren. One of his sons, Itamar Orlev, is also a writer and made his debut with the novel &quot;Bandit&quot; in 2015.

He died on 26 July 2022.

==Awards and critical acclaim==
The biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children&#x27;s books. Orlev received the writing award in 1996. The jury stated:

In 1972, he received the Prime Minister&#x27;s Prize for Hebrew Literary Works. In 2006, he was awarded the Bialik Prize for literature (jointly with Ruth Almog and Raquel Chalfi).

In the U.S., four books by Orlev have won the Batchelder Award in English-language translations by Hillel Halkin published by Houghton Mifflin. The annual American Library Association award recognizes the &quot;children&#x27;s book considered to be the most outstanding of those books originally published in a foreign language in a foreign country, and subsequently translated into English and published in the United States&quot;. The four American titles were &quot;The Island on Bird Street&quot;, &quot;The Man from the Other Side&quot;, &quot;The Lady with the Hat&quot;, and &quot;Run, Boy, Run&quot;, published from 1984 to 2003 by Houghton Mifflin, eventually by its Walter Lorraine Books imprint.

<text>Marcel Otte (born 5 October 1948) is a professor of Prehistory at the Université de Liège, Belgium. He is a specialist in Religion, Arts, Sociobiology, and the Upper Palaeolithic times of Europe and Central Asia. In the book &quot;Speaking Australopithecus&quot; (written together with the philologist Francesco Benozzo) he argues from the archaeological point of view Benozzo&#x27;s hypothesis that human language appeared with Australopithecus, between 4 and 3 million years ago.

Otte is one of the only advocates of the Paleolithic continuity theory, which states that Indo-European languages originated in Europe and have existed there since Paleolithic times. He first advocated that theory in work published in 1995.

<doc id="1325770" wikidata="Q7812567" url="?curid=1325770" title="Todd Pinkston">
<text>Todd Pinkston (born April 23, 1977) is an American football coach and former professional player who is the running backs coach for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He played five seasons professionally as a wide receiver with the Philadelphia Eagles where he caught 184 passes for 2,816 yards and 14 touchdowns. The Eagles went to the playoffs every year that he started, including an appearance in Super Bowl XXXIX. He also is the cousin of former offensive lineman Jason Pinkston. He was inducted to the Southern Miss Sports Hall of Fame in 2011. Todd Pinkston was inducted into the Scott County Sports Hall of Fame in his hometown of Forest, Miss., in 2015.

==Playing career==

===College career===
At the University of Southern Mississippi, where he joined the Theta Eta chapter of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity, he graduated as the school&#x27;s second all-time leading receiver with 149 catches for 2,366 yards and 22 touchdowns, including 48 receptions for 977 yards and 11 touchdowns as a senior.

===Professional career===

====Philadelphia Eagles====
Despite his success in college, Pinkston&#x27;s selection in the second round of the 2000 NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles raised some eyebrows due to his slight build. At 6 feet 3 inches tall, Pinkston reportedly weighed only 167 pounds at the time of the draft.

After seeing only slight action in 2000, Pinkston took over as a starter in 2001 following the release of Charles Johnson and Torrance Small. Partnering with James Thrash, Pinkston caught 42 balls for 586 yards and four touchdowns. In 2002, Pinkston enjoyed his best year. He hauled in 60 receptions for 798 yards and seven touchdowns. His performance that season earned him a five-year contract extension with the Eagles, which included a large signing bonus.

Pinkston&#x27;s numbers dipped slightly in 2003, but he was productive down the stretch and registered a key touchdown in a playoff game against the Green Bay Packers. Unfortunately, the next week, Pinkston was held catchless by Carolina Panthers cornerback, Ricky Manning Jr. Manning snagged three interceptions, and the Eagles lost the 2003 NFC Championship 14–3, the third consecutive defeat suffered by the team in the conference title game.

Criticism of Pinkston turned particularly harsh after a game against the Washington Redskins on December 12, 2004, when Pinkston was accused of giving up on a catchable pass across the middle. ESPN analyst Joe Theismann commented &quot;...this is a great way to lose your job as a receiver in the National Football League.&quot; However, later that half Pinkston was the recipient of an 80-yard pass from Donovan McNabb, furthering the paradox between his big play potential and his reluctance to run routes in traffic.

This negative publicity notwithstanding, Pinkston&#x27;s 18.8 yards-per-catch average for the 2004 regular season was exceeded by only one other NFL receiver with as many or more receptions than the 36 he recorded (Ashley Lelie of the Denver Broncos averaged 20.1), and his six catches gaining 40 or more yards was topped by only three other receivers (teammate Terrell Owens, who had nine, and Javon Walker of the Green Bay Packers and Dennis Northcutt of the Cleveland Browns with seven each).

After having made four receptions for 82 yards in Super Bowl XXXIX, Pinkston was forced to leave the game with leg cramps.

On August 5, 2005, Pinkston sustained a torn Achilles tendon in training camp practice, putting him out for the 2005 season.

During the 2006 pre-season, he was still hobbled from his Achilles injury, only catching one pass for four yards. On August 29, 2006, Pinkston was released by the Eagles following the acquisition of Donté Stallworth.

====Minnesota Vikings====
On September 3, 2006, Pinkston signed a one-year contract with the Minnesota Vikings, whose head coach, Brad Childress, was the former Eagles offensive coordinator. Pinkston was cut six days later on September 9.

====Washington Redskins====
On August 13, 2007, Pinkston, recovered from his Achilles injury, signed with the Washington Redskins, but failed to make the team&#x27;s final roster.

====NFL statistics====


==Coaching career==
Pinkston was hired by his former team, the Philadelphia Eagles, as a coaching intern during training camp and the preseason in 2009. He assisted wide receivers coach David Culley in coaching his unit. He also served as the receivers&#x27; coach at Petal High School located in Petal, Mississippi, just across the Leaf River from Hattiesburg. He was the wide receiver&#x27;s coach for Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, Tennessee from 2016 to 2021.

On March 17, 2023, Pinkston was hired as the running backs coach for the Kansas City Chiefs. Pinkston became a Super Bowl champion when the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25–22 in Super Bowl LVIII.

<doc id="1325784" wikidata="Q1455597" url="?curid=1325784" title="Piano key frequencies">
<text>This is a list of the fundamental frequencies in hertz (cycles per second) of the keys of a modern 88-key standard or 108-key extended piano in twelve-tone equal temperament, with the 49th key, the fifth A (called A4), tuned to 440 Hz (referred to as A440). Every octave is made of twelve steps called semitones. A jump from the lowest semitone to the highest semitone in one octave doubles the frequency (for example, the fifth A is 440 Hz and the sixth A is 880 Hz). The frequency of a pitch is derived by multiplying (ascending) or dividing (descending) the frequency of the previous pitch by the twelfth root of two (approximately 1.059463). For example, to get the frequency one semitone up from A4 (A4), multiply 440 Hz by the twelfth root of two. To go from A4 up two semitones (one whole tone) to B4, multiply 440 twice by the twelfth root of two (or once by the sixth root of two, approximately 1.122462). To go from A4 up three semitones to C5 (a minor third), multiply 440 Hz three times by the twelfth root of two (or once by the fourth root of two, approximately 1.189207). For other tuning schemes, refer to musical tuning.

This list of frequencies is for a theoretically ideal piano. On an actual piano, the ratio between semitones is slightly larger, especially at the high and low ends, where string stiffness causes inharmonicity, i.e., the tendency for the harmonic makeup of each note to run sharp. To compensate for this, octaves are tuned slightly wide, stretched according to the inharmonic characteristics of each instrument. This deviation from equal temperament is called the Railsback curve.

The following equation gives the frequency (Hz) of the th key on the idealized standard piano with the 49th key tuned to A4 at 440 Hz:
:formula_1
where is shown in the table below.

Conversely, the key number of a pitch with a frequency (Hz) on the idealized standard piano is:
:formula_2

==List==


Values in bold are exact on an idealized standard piano. Keys shaded gray are rare and only appear on extended pianos. The normal 88 keys were numbered 1–88, with the extra low keys numbered 89–97 and the extra high keys numbered 98–108. A 108-key piano that extends from C0 to B8 was first built in 2018 by Stuart &amp; Sons. (Note: these piano key numbers 1-108 are not the keys in the equations or the table.)

<doc id="1325810" wikidata="Q1241818" url="?curid=1325810" title="Vega Island">
<text>Vega Island () is an island in Antarctica, long and wide, which is the northernmost of the James Ross Island group and lies in the west part of Erebus and Terror Gulf. 
It is separated from James Ross Island by Herbert Sound and from Trinity Peninsula by Prince Gustav Channel.

==Location==

Vega Island is in Graham Land, to the southeast of the Trinity Peninsula, which is the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
Erebus and Terror Gulf is to the east.
James Ross Island is to the south, and the Ulu Peninsula of James Ross Island is to the west, separated from Vega Island by the Herbert Sound.
The Prince Gustav Channel separates it from Corry Island and Eagle Island to the north.
Cape Gordon is at the east end of the island.

==Sailing directions==
The US Defense Mapping Agency&#x27;s &quot;Sailing Directions for Antarctica&quot; (1976) describes Vega Island as follows:
==Name==
Vega Island was named by Dr. Otto Nordenskjöld, leader of the Swedish Antarctic Expedition (SwedAE; 1901–04), apparently for the ship &quot;Vega&quot; used by his uncle, Baron A.E. Nordenskjold, in making the first voyage through the Northeast Passage between 1878 and 1879.

== Geology ==

Vega Island is a volcanic island of the James Ross Island Volcanic Group. As can be observed in limited outcrops, Vega Island consists of the deeply eroded volcanic deposits of tuff cones and lava-fed, volcanic deltas. So far, these volcanic deposits have been dated at being 2, 2.67, and 5.42 Ma. They rest upon well-bedded sandstones and mudstones ranging in age from Cretaceous to Paleogene periods. These sedimentary strata outcrop near the islands&#x27;s base and as bluffs along its shoreline.

The lava-fed, volcanic deltas formed by the eruption of lava from a volcanic vent into a glacial lake formed by the prior melting of the ice cap in which the lake was contained. Initially, the underwater eruption resulted in volcanic breccia and basaltic pillow lava. As the volcanic deposits built up, the volcanic vent rose above lake level and erupted subaerially forming tuff cones and lava-feed, volcanic deltas that built out into the glacial lake. The basaltic lava flows form a caprock along the northwest shore, which forms an impermeable layer that results in about sixty waterfalls on warm days.

In Vegas Island, the Cretaceous sediementary strata outcrops primarily in Cape Lamb and False Island Point. The oldest Cretaceous strata consists of minor outcrops of highly bioturbated silty mudstones to silty sandstones of the Herbert Sound Member of the Santa Marta Formation. Widely exposed and overlying it are of fine-grained strata in Lamb Member of the Snow Hill Island Formation. The youngest exposed Cretaceous strata in Vegas Island belong to the Sandwich Bluff Member of the López de Bertodano Formation. This member consists of of a variety of sedimentary rock types, including thin conglomerates, pebbly sandstones, sandstones and mudstones, and contains slump sheets, hummocky cross-stratification and rare rootlet horizons. The Sandwich Bluff Member is exposed almost entirely along the flanks of Sandwich Bluff in an outcrop that is approximately long by wide.

==Paleontology==
The exposed Cretaceous strata make Vega Island is an important site for paleontology. The Cape Lamb Member of the Snow Hill Island Formation contains an extraordinarily abundant and diverse marine invertebrate macrofauna. This macrofauna is dominated by ammonoids (mostly &quot;Gunnarites antarcticus&quot;), nautiloids, bivalves (mostly Pinna sp.), crustaceans, and serpulid worms. Fossil wood is also abundant in these strata along with a large variety of trace fossils preserved within concretions. the fossil bones of dinosaurs (&quot;Iguanodontidae&quot;) and birds (&quot;Charadriiformes&quot;) have been found in the Cape Lamb Member. The López de Bertodano Formation exposed at Sandwich Bluff is also an important locality for its fossils of high-latitude, latest Cretaceous terrestrial plants and vertebrates in the Southern Hemisphere. Vertebrate fossils found there include the fossils of mosasaurs, plesiosaurs (&quot;Mauisaurus sp.&quot;), dinosaurs (&quot;Hadrosauridae&quot;), and birds (&quot;Polarornis sp.&quot; and &quot;Vegavis iaai&quot;).

==Northern features==
Northern features, from west to east, include:

=== Keltie Head===
A rounded headland with vertical cliffs which rise to a small ice dome high, forming the northwest end of Vega Island. 
Discovered by the SwedAE under Otto Nordenskjöld, 1901-04, and named by him for Sir John Scott Keltie, Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, 1892-1915.

===Sandwich Bluff===
A flat-topped mountain, high, broken sharply at its west side by a steep dark bluff standing slightly west of center on Vega Island. 
Discovered by the SwedAE under Otto Nordenskjöld, 1901-04. 
Charted in 1945 by the FIDS, and so named because a horizontal snow-holding band of rock breaks the western cliff giving it the appearance of a sandwich when viewed from the north.

===Vertigo Cliffs===
Spectacular, near vertical cliffs on the north coast of Vega Island. 
The cliffs rise to about high and extend west for from Cape Well-met, broken by a cirque near the west end. 
Named allusively by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1987.

===Cape Well-met===
A dark, conspicuous headland near the center of the north side of Vega Island, close south of Trinity Peninsula. 
Cape Well-met was discovered and named by the SwedAE, 1901-04-
The name commemorates the long delayed union at this point of a relief party under Doctor Johan Gunnar Andersson and the winter party under Doctor Otto Nordenskjöld after twenty months of enforced separation.

===Cape Gordon===
A jagged headland high high, forming the east end of Vega Island. 
Discovered by a British expedition 1839-43, under James Clark Ross, and named by him for Captain William Gordon, RN, a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty

==Southern features==
Southern features, from west to east, include:
===Cape Lamb===
A cape which forms the southwest tip of Vega Island.
It was discovered by the SwedAE, 1901-04, under Otto Nordenskjöld. 
It was resighted in 1945 by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS), and named after Ivan Mackenzie Lamb (1911-90), botanist on the FIDS staff at Port Lockroy, 1944; at Hope Bay, 1945; leader of biological expedition to Melchior Islands, 1964-65.

===Léal Bluff===
A rounded bluff rising to high, inland from Cape Lamb in the southwest part of Vega Island. 
It was named by the Argentine Antarctic Expedition after Mayor Jorge Leal, deputy leader at the Argentine Esperanza Base in 1947.

===False Island Point===
A headland long and wide, which is connected by a low, narrow, almost invisible isthmus to the south side of Vega Island. 
First sighted in February 1902 and charted as an island by the SwedAE under Otto Nordenskjöld. 
It was determined to be a part of Vega Island in 1945 by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS), who applied this descriptive name.

===Pastorizo Bay===
A bay wide, indenting the south side of Vega Island just west of Mahogany Bluff. 
The name appears on an Argentine chart of 1959.

===Mahogany Bluff===
A rocky bluff southwest of Cape Gordon, forming the east side of Pastorizo Bay. 
So named by UK-APC because of the striking deep red-brown color of the bluff.

<text>The Bournonville method is a ballet technique and training system devised by the Danish ballet master August Bournonville.

==Overview==
August Bournonville trained with his father Antoine Bournonville and other notable French ballet masters. He was heavily influenced by the early French school of ballet, which he preserved in his teaching and choreography, when the traditional French methods began to disappear from European ballet. What is considered today to be the &quot;Bournonville style&quot; is essentially the unfiltered 19th century technique of the French school of classical dance.

The technique features very basic use of arms, usually keeping them in preparatoire position. Perpetual use of simple diagonal epaulements. Vocabulary for men is essentially varied forms of beats. Pirouettes are taken with a low développé into seconde, then from seconde, for outside turns, and with a low développé into 4th for inside turns. Also common are the dramatic use of fifth position bras en bas (preparatory position) for beginning and ending movements. The style has many recognizable poses such as pointe derriere one arm in 5th, the other a la taille (at the waist), with a touch of epaulement.

==Characteristics==
*The guiding principle of the Bournonville method is that the dancer should perform with a natural grace, dramatic impact and harmony between body and music
*Graceful epaulement, with the upper body usually twisting towards the working foot, to draw attention to and emphasise the movement.
*Lowered eye-line to give the impression of kindness, not raised with the expression of being proud.
*The eyes naturally follow the moving leg.
*Great attention is paid to the shape and placement of the arms. Arms are held in front of the body in all positions, so as to be anatomically correct.
*Feet are low in the &quot;cou de pied&quot; position, with the toe of the working foot behind the ankle of the standing leg.
*Pirouettes are performed with a low leg position, a result of the long skirts worn by ladies during his time.
*Bournonville method is noted for developing quick footwork, as required by Bournonville&#x27;s choreography
*There should be no visible effort. Even the largest, most dramatic steps should be performed in an understated manner.
*There should be a visible contrast between the speed of the legs and the grace of the arms and torso. The legs are the rhythm, the arms are the melody

<doc id="1325828" wikidata="Q1598049" url="?curid=1325828" title="Solution-focused brief therapy">
<text>Solution-focused (brief) therapy (SFBT) is a goal-directed collaborative approach to psychotherapeutic change that is conducted through direct observation of clients&#x27; responses to a series of precisely constructed questions. Based upon social constructivist thinking and Wittgensteinian philosophy, SFBT focuses on addressing what clients want to achieve without exploring the history and provenance of problem(s). SF therapy sessions typically focus on the present and future, focusing on the past only to the degree necessary for communicating empathy and accurate understanding of the client&#x27;s concerns.

SFBT is a future-oriented and goal-oriented interviewing technique that helps clients &quot;build solutions.&quot; Elliott Connie defines solution building as &quot;a collaborative language process between the client(s) and the therapist that develops a detailed description of the client(s)&#x27; preferred future/goals and identifies exceptions and past successes&quot;. By doing so, SFBT focuses on clients&#x27; strengths and resilience.

==General introduction==
The solution-focused brief therapy approach grew from the work of American social workers Steve de Shazer, Insoo Kim Berg, and their team at the Milwaukee Brief Family Therapy Center (BFTC) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A private training and therapy institute, BFTC was started by dissatisfied former staff members from a Milwaukee agency who were interested in exploring brief therapy approaches then being developed at the Mental Research Institute (MRI) in Palo Alto, California. The initial group included married partners, Steve de Shazer and Insoo Berg, and Jim Derks, Elam Nunnally, Judith Tietyen, Don Norman, Marilyn La Court and Eve Lipchik. Their students included John Walter, Jane Peller, Michele Weiner-Davis and Yvonne Dolan. Steve de Shazer and Berg, primary developers of the approach, co-authored an update of SFBT in 2007, shortly before their deaths. SFBT evolved from the Brief Therapy that was practiced at MRI.

The solution-focused approach was developed inductively rather than deductively; Berg, de Shazer and their team spent thousands of hours carefully observing live and recorded therapy sessions. Any behaviors or words on the part of the therapist that reliably led to positive therapeutic change on the part of the clients were painstakingly noted and incorporated into the SFBT approach. In most traditional psychotherapeutic approaches starting with Freud, practitioners assumed that it was necessary to make an extensive analysis of the history and cause of their clients&#x27; problems before attempting to develop any sort of solution. Solution-focused therapists see the therapeutic change process radically differently and informed by the observations of de Shazer, which recognize that although &quot;causes of problems may be extremely complex, their solutions do not necessarily need to be&quot;.

SFBT might be best defined by what it does not do because SFBT presents an innovative and radically different approach from traditional psychotherapy. Traditional psychotherapy looks at how problems happen, manifest, and resolve. The problem-solving approach is influenced by the medical model, where the symptoms are assessed to diagnose and treat the malady. Outside of SFBT, the almost universal belief is that the clinician must define and understand the problem to help. To do this, the practitioner must develop some information about the nature of problems that they will help resolve and ask questions about the client&#x27;s symptoms. The more common problem-solving approach includes a description of the problem, an assessment of the problem, and plan and execute interventions to resolve or mitigate the impact of the problem. This is followed by an evaluation determining the success of the intervention and follow-up if necessary.

SFBT posits that a therapist can help clients resolve their problems without identifying the details or source problem and completely avoids exploring the details and context of the problem. SFBT believes that an assessment of the problem is entirely unnecessary. Focusing on the problem actually may serve to shift the client away from the solution. This is because SFBT fundamentally believes that the nature of the solution can be completely different from the problem. So instead, SFBT focuses on building solutions by conceptualizing a preferred future with clients. SFBT is all about finding alternatives to the problem, not identifying and eliminating the problem.

SFBT is strengths-based and supports clients&#x27; self-determination. Using the client&#x27;s language, SFBT uses the client&#x27;s perspective and fosters cooperation. The focus on the strengths and resources of clients is a factor in why some social workers choose SFBT.

SFBT is designed to help people change their lives in the fastest way possible. By finding and amplifying exceptions, change is efficient and effective. Treatment usually lasts less than six sessions, and it can work in about two sessions. Its brevity and its flexibility have made SFBT the choice of intervention for many health care settings. Interventions in a medical setting many times need to be brief. Agencies also choose SFBT because its efficiency translates into monetary savings.

== History ==
Solution-focused brief therapy is one of a family of approaches, known as systems therapies, that have been developed over the past 50 years or so, first in the US, and eventually evolving around the world, including Europe. The title SFBT, and the specific steps involved in its practice, are attributed to husband and wife Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg, two American social workers, and their team at the Brief Family Therapy Center (BFTC) in Milwaukee, US. Core members of this team were Jim Derks, Elam Nunnally, Marilyn LaCourt, and Eve Lipchik as well as students Pat Bielke, Dave Pakenham, John Walter, Jane Peller, Elam Nunnally, Alex Molnar, and Michele Weiner-Davis. Wallace Gingerich and Gale Miller joined a few years later as research assistants.

In the 1970s, de Shazer, Berg and colleagues conducted Brief Family Therapy at Family Service of Milwaukee, a community agency, and installed one-way mirrors to observe sessions with clients to study which activities were most beneficial for the clients. The group of therapists used to meet in the couple&#x27;s home, where a therapist saw clients pro bono in the living room while the others observed, after which they would discuss their thoughts together in a bedroom. In 1978, when the administration disallowed the one-way mirrors, de Shazer and Berg put together a team of practitioners and students and founded the Brief Family Therapy Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to continue their work. The result was the eventual development of SFBT.
BFTC served as a research center to study, develop, and test techniques of psychotherapy to find those that are most efficient and effective with clients. Besides mental health professionals, the team included educators, sociologists, linguists, engineers and philosophers. Steve de Shazer, the director of BFTC, referred to this group as a &quot;therapeutic think tank&quot;. Over time people began to request training, so BFTC became a research and training center.

SFBT has its roots in brief family therapy, a type of family therapy practiced at the Mental Research Institute (MRI). In the 1970s, de Shazer, the primary creator of SFBT, studied the work done at MRI and founded BFTC to serve as &quot;the MRI of the Midwest&quot;. John Weakland at MRI influenced him to develop simple techniques in brief goal-focused therapy, and at MRI he was introduced to the work of Milton Erickson which ultimately had a significant influence on the development of SFBT.

In 1982 there was the watershed moment where the founders of SFBT, Berg, de Shazer, and their team transformed their brief therapy practice to become solution-focused. A family came to be treated at the Milwaukee Brief Family Therapy. During the assessment, the family provided a list of 27 problems. The team was at a loss as to what to suggest the family try to do differently. They suggested that the family come back with a list of things they want to continue to happen. The effectiveness of this spontaneous intervention led to the understanding that the solution is not necessarily related to the problem. This was the beginning of solution-focused brief therapy.

SFBT practice began to be popularized starting in the late 1980s and experienced tremendous growth in its first 15–20 years. Their work in the early 1980s built on that of a number of other innovators, among them Milton Erickson and the group at the MRI – Gregory Bateson, Donald deAvila Jackson, Paul Watzlawick, John Weakland, Virginia Satir, Jay Haley, Richard Fisch, Janet Beavin Bavelas and others. SFBT gained tremendous popularity in the UK in the late 1990s and the 2000s. At that time, it also spread worldwide to be a leading brief therapy, with many agencies adopting SFBT as their only modality. It is now one of the most popular psychotherapeutic modalities globally.

== SFBT practice ==

In SFBT, practitioners employ conversational skills to facilitate a discussion focused on solutions, as opposed to dwelling on problems. The questions themselves serve as the intervention, directing clients toward a mindset that fosters positive change and reduces negative emotions. These questions help clients reinterpret their experiences, enabling them to recognize potential for change where they might not have seen it before.

The primary tools of the solution-focused approach are questions and compliments. SFBT therapists refrain from making interpretations and rarely confront clients. Instead, they concentrate on identifying clients&#x27; goals and developing a detailed description of life when the goal is reached, and the problem is either resolved or managed satisfactorily. To devise effective solutions, they examine clients&#x27; life experiences for &quot;exceptions,&quot; or moments when some aspect of their goal was already happening to some extent.

SFBT therapists believe personal change is constant. By helping clients identify positive directions for change and focusing on changes they wish to continue, SFBT therapists assist clients in constructing a concrete vision of a preferred future.

One way to understand SFBT is through the acronym MECSTAT, which stands for Miracle questions, Exception questions, Coping questions, Scaling questions, Time-out, Accolades, and Task [39]. SFBT questions prompt clients to discuss their preferred future and describe what would be different when the problem is solved or managed. The &quot;miracle question&quot; is one such tool, asking clients to imagine that their problem was miraculously solved without their knowledge and to identify the first clues that would indicate the problem is resolved.

Therapists also ask questions that focus on previous solutions or &quot;exceptions&quot; to the problem. In SFBT, exceptions are times when the problem is less severe or better managed. Identifying exceptions helps build solutions by highlighting what is working in clients&#x27; lives. By discovering and amplifying minor exceptions to the problem, therapists encourage clients to do more of what already works.

When seeking exceptions, the practitioner does not attempt to convince the client of their significance. Instead, the therapist adopts a genuinely curious stance and asks the client to explain the exception&#x27;s importance. Therapists must maintain a not-knowing stance, which can be challenging for emerging SFBT practitioners.

SFBT practitioners use tools such as starting sessions with the question &quot;What&#x27;s been better since we last talked?&quot; to help clients identify exceptions. Scaling questions are another tool, using a scale to measure clients&#x27; progress toward their goals. Clients are asked to provide details about times when the problem was less severe or absent and to identify behaviors that work for them.

SFBT sessions are highly structured, following a specific format and employing formulated interviewing techniques. However, adhering to the underlying philosophy of SFBT is considered more important than strictly following the techniques. Central to SFBT is the belief that clients are the experts in their lives and possess the knowledge necessary to achieve their goals. Therapists are considered experts in asking questions that evoke the change process.

In authentic SFBT practice, resistance is rarely encountered. Maintaining a curious and not-knowing stance is vital for effective SFBT. Despite its apparent simplicity, SFBT is difficult to master. It requires disciplined practice, which can be challenging for many practitioners. As a result, some may only use components of SFBT instead of adhering to pure SFBT, often due to the difficulty in transitioning from a problem-focused stance. Conversely, new SFBT trainees may struggle with being overly optimistic and not genuinely validating clients&#x27; pain. This may be because concentrating on newly learned SFBT skills and techniques takes focus away from being present with the client.

Authentic SFBT practice demands that therapists remain highly attuned to clients&#x27; verbal and non-verbal communication, adapting their questions to better understand and engage with the client&#x27;s perspective. By doing so, SFBT practitioners can effectively facilitate client movement toward their goals and preferred futures.

== Evidence-based status ==
In the early days of the model, critics often said that SFBT does not have enough research. In 2000 a review of SFBT research just showed preliminary evidence of the efficacy of SFBT. However, in 2010 the SFBT research grew to a level where the evidence was promising, and today several meta-analyses show SFBT to be effective with internalizing issues. SFBT has a robust, broad, and growing evidence base and is recommended for use when deemed a good fit for the client and their problem.

SFBT has been examined in two meta-analyses and is supported as evidenced-based by numerous federal and state agencies and institutions, such as SAMHSA&#x27;s National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs &amp; Practices (NREPP). The conclusion of the two meta-analyses and the systematic reviews, and the overall conclusion of the most recent scholarly work on SFBT, is that solution-focused brief therapy is an effective approach to the treatment of psychological problems, with effect sizes similar to other evidenced-based approaches, such as CBT and IPT, but that these effects are found in fewer average sessions, and using an approach style that is more benign.

== Applications ==
SFBT is very adaptable to many settings because it helps the clients create custom-made interventions for themselves, and the client is always considered to be the expert. Even the practitioner&#x27;s language is taken from the words the client uses to describe their life and preferred future. The result is that SFBT provides interventions that are perfectly matched with the clients&#x27; way of understanding and acting. Techniques such as the miracle question can be adapted to make them more culturally relevant and come across in ways more empathetic and supportive based on the culture and needs of the population being served.

SFBT works well with children and families and can be applied to many family-related situations. It is effective with adolescents, pregnant and postpartum women, couples, and parents. SFBT was shown to be effective for families in the child welfare system, with case management in social welfare programs, financial counseling, and with therapy groups.

SFBT has been applied to many settings, including education and business settings including coaching. and counselling. It is effective in schools and with college students. It was successfully used with populations in jails, inpatient addiction rehab centers, inpatient psychiatric facilities, and in a wide range of medical settings. It has been helpful with treating family members of patients with serious illnesses.

SFBT is effective with people in many countries and cultures, including people from Turkey, Chile, Iran, and China. A systematic review showed it to be effective with Latinos.

SFBT works in treating people who experienced trauma. It has been suggested to use with patients that are suicidal or in crisis, families coping with suicide, and patients with eating disorders substance use disorders, and obesity. It was also suggested as a promising intervention for individuals with a brain injury and was helpful with those with intellectual disabilities. It has even been documented to have been successfully used with a patient in a psychotic crisis.

SFBT is effective in treating clients with depression. It has been shown to be effective in helping increase self-esteem, hope, good behavior, and social competence among adolescents and children. It has been suggested that SFBT&#x27;s ability to engender hope is what makes it effective for patients suffering from depression as the presence of hope is shown to have an inverse relationship with depression.

Workers with child protective services report in a qualitative study that SFBT training and supervision was helpful for them to work in a more cooperative and strength-based way and improved the overall mood and atmosphere of their encounters. There are models designed for child protection services that incorporate aspects of SFBT because SFBT alone is thought to be insufficient for child protective services because a more authoritative approach is necessary.

<text>In the French courts during the 17th Century, ballet first begins to flourish with the help of several important men: King Louis XIV, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Pierre Beauchamps, and Molière. The combination of different talents and passions of these four men shaped ballet to what it is today.

==Early history==

===Louis XIV===

Louis XIV, the King of France from 1643 to 1715, was a ballet enthusiast from a young age. In fact his birth was celebrated with the &quot;Ballet de la Felicite&quot; in 1639. As a young boy, he was strongly supported and encouraged by the court, particularly by Italian-born Cardinal Mazarin, to take part in the ballets. He made his debut at age 12 in the &quot;Ballet de Cassandre&quot; in 1651. Two years later in 1653, the teenage king starred as Apollo, the sun god, in &quot;Ballet Royal de la Nuit&quot; (Royal Ballet of the Night). His influence on the art form and its influence on him became apparent. His fancy golden costume was not soon forgotten, and his famous performance led to his nickname, the Sun King. In the ballet, he banishes the night terrors as he rise as sun at dawn. His courtiers were forced to worship him like a god through choreography. They were made clear of the glory of King Louis XIV and that he had absolute authority both on and off the dance floor. The ballets that young King Louis performed in were very different from ballets performed today. The form of entertainment was actually called &quot;ballets d&#x27;entrées&quot;. This refers to the small divisions, or &quot;entries,&quot; that the ballets were broken up into. For example, &quot;Le Ballet de la Nuit&quot;, comprised over forty of such entries, which were divided into four &quot;vigils&quot; or parts. The whole spectacle lasted 13 hours.

Throughout his reign, Louis XIV worked with many influential people in his court dances. He worked alongside poet Isaac de Benserade, as well as designers Torelli, Vigarani and Henry de Gissey, which made fashion and dance closely interlinked. Possibly his greatest contribution to the French court was bringing composer/dancer Jean-Baptiste Lully. Louis supported and encouraged performances in his court as well as the development of ballet throughout France. Louis XIV was trained by Pierre Beauchamp. The King demonstrated his belief in strong technique when he founded the Académie Royale de Danse in 1661 and made Beauchamp leading ballet master. King Louis XIV&#x27;s and France&#x27;s attempt to keep French ballet standards high was only encouraged further when in 1672 a dance school was attached to the Académie Royale de Musique. Led by Jean-Baptiste Lully, this ballet company is known today as the Paris Opera Ballet.

The king was very exacting in his behavior towards his dancing. In fact, he made it a daily practice to have a ballet lesson every day after his morning riding lesson. As the French people watched and took note of what their leader was doing, dancing became an essential accomplishment for every gentleman. Clearly ballet became a way of life for those who were around King Louis XIV. If one looked at the culture of seventeenth-century France, one saw a reflection of an organized ballet that was choreographed beautifully, costumed appropriately, and performed with perfect precision. Louis XIV retired from ballet in 1670.

===Jean-Baptiste Lully===
Perhaps one of the most influential men on ballet during the seventeenth century was Jean Baptiste Lully. Lully was born in Italy, but moved to France where he quickly became a favorite of Louis XIV and performed alongside the king in many ballets until the king&#x27;s retirement from dance in 1670. He moved from dancer for the court ballets to a composer of such music used in the courts. By the time he was thirty, Lully was completely in charge of all the musical activities in the French courts. Lully was responsible for enlivening the rather slow stately dances of the court ballets. He decided to put female dancers on stage and was also director of the Académie Royale de Musique. This company&#x27;s dance school still exists today as part of the Paris Opera Ballet. Since dancers appeared in the first performances the Opera put on, the Paris Opera Ballet is considered the world&#x27;s oldest ballet company. When Lully died in 1687 from a gangrenous abscess on the foot which developed after he stuck himself with the long staff he used for conducting, France lost one of the most influential conductors and composers of the seventeenth century. However, Lully did not work alone. In fact, he often worked in collaboration with two other men that were equally influential to ballet and the French culture: Pierre Beauchamps and Molière.

===Pierre Beauchamps===
Beauchamps was a ballet master who was deeply involved with the creation of court ballets in the 1650s and 1660s. However, Beauchamps began his career as the personal teacher to Louis XIV. He is also credited with coming up with the five fundamental foot positions from which all balletic movements move through. Beauchamps techniques were taught throughout France in secondary schools as well as by private teachers. Contemporary dancers would astonish Beauchamps at their ability to have 180-degree turnout. Beauchamps dancers wore high-heeled shoes and bulky costumes which made turnout difficult and slight. 

One of the first things that Lully and Beauchamps worked together on was &quot;Les Fêtes de l&#x27;Amour et de Bacchus&quot;, which they called &quot;opéra-ballet&quot;. The &quot;opéra-ballet&quot; is a form of lyric theatre in which singing and dancing were presented as equal partners in lavish and spectacular stagings. The &quot;Les Fêtes de l&#x27;Amour et de Bacchus&quot;, one of their first and most famous collaborations, consisted of excerpts from court ballets linked by new &quot;entrées&quot; stages by Beauchamps. Customarily, King Louis and courtiers danced in the court ballets; however, in this new form of entertainment, the &quot;opéra-ballet&quot;, all of the dancers were professionals. Beauchamps not only collaborated with Lully, but he also had the great privilege to partner with Molière during his lifetime. 

Beauchamps also originated the Beauchamp–Feuillet notation, which provided detailed indications of the tract of a dance and the related footwork. Starting in 1700, hundreds of social and theatrical dances were recorded and widely published in this form. Although this has been superseded in modern times by even more expressive notations, the notation is sufficiently detailed that, along with contemporary dancing manuals, these dances can be reconstructed today

===Molière===
Molière was a well-known comedic playwright during that time period. He and Beauchamps collaborated for the first time in 1661, which resulted in the invention of &quot;comédie-ballet&quot;. His invention of &quot;comedies-ballets&quot; was said to be an accident. He was invited to set both a play and court ballet in honor of Louis XIV, but was short of dancers and decided to combined the two productions together. This resulted in &quot;Les Facheux&quot; in 1661. This and the following &quot;comédie-ballets&quot; were considered the most important advance in baroque dance since the development of Renaissance geometric figures. One of the most famous of these types of performances was &quot;Le Bourgeois gentilhomme&quot;, which is still performed today and continues to entertain audiences. The idea behind a &quot;comédie-ballet&quot; was a combination of spoken scenes separated by balletic interludes; it is the roots for today&#x27;s musical theatre. Many of Molière&#x27;s ballets were performed by Louis XIV. According to Susan Au, the king&#x27;s farewell performance was Molière&#x27;s &quot;Les Amants magnifiques&quot; in 1670. Not only were these types of performances popular in the courts, but they helped transition from courtiers being the dancers to using actors and professional dancers, soon to be known as ballerinas. The &quot;comédie-ballets&quot; helped to bring understanding between the court and the commoners as the transition from court ballets to a more common place ballet occurred.
With Molière writing the dialogue and directing, Beauchamps choreographing the ballet interludes, and Lully composing the music and overseeing the coming together of all the dancers and actors, these three giants of men worked together to create many beautiful pieces of art for King Louis XIV.

<text>Russian ballet () () is a form of ballet characteristic of or originating from Russia.

==Imperial Russian ballet==
Ballet had already dawned in Russia long before start of the 17th century as per the previous publications by certain authors. In this respect Anna Kuchta posits that ballet was first performed in Russia around 1673. While the first recorded ballet performance is believed to be in the 16th century around 1581, the Tsarist control and isolationism in Russia allowed for little influence from the West. It wasn&#x27;t until the rise of Peter the Great that Russian society opened up to the West. St. Petersburg was erected to embrace the West and compete against Moscow&#x27;s isolationism. Peter the Great created a new Russia which rivaled the society of the West with magnificent courts and palaces. His vision was to challenge the west. Classical ballet entered the realm of Russia not as entertainment, but as a &quot;standard of physical comportment to be emulated and internalized – an idealized way of behaving.&quot; The aim was not to entertain the masses of Russians, but to cultivate new Russian people. 
Empress Anna (1730–1740) was devoted to ostentatious amusements (balls, fireworks, tableaux), and in the summer of 1734 ordered the appointment of Jean-Baptiste Landé as dancing master in the military academy she had founded in 1731 for sons of the nobility. In 1738, he became ballet master and head of the new ballet school, launching the advanced study of ballet in Russia, and winning the patronage of elite families. France provided many leaders such as Charles Didelot in St. Petersburg (1801–1831), Jules Perrot (1848–1859) and Arthur Saint-Léon (1859–1869).

In the early 19th century, the theaters were opened up to anyone who could afford a ticket. A seating section called a &quot;rayok&quot;, or &#x27;paradise gallery&#x27;, consisted of simple wooden benches. This allowed non-wealthy people access to the ballet, because tickets in this section were inexpensive.

One author describes the Imperial ballet as &quot;unlike that of any other country in the world ...&quot; The most prestigious of the ballet troupes were those attached to the state-supported theatres. The directors of these companies were personally appointed by the tsar, and all the dancers were, in a sense, Imperial servants. In the theatre, the men in the audience always remained standing until the tsar entered his box and, out of respect, after the performance, they remained in their places until he had departed. Curtain calls were arranged according to a strict pattern: first, the ballerina bowed to the tsar&#x27;s box, then to that of the theater director, and finally to the general public.

== Influence of Russian Ballet on Global Dance Culture ==
The influence of Russian ballet extends far beyond its national borders, significantly shaping global dance culture. With the establishment of prestigious ballet companies such as the Ballets Russes in the early 20th century, Russian ballet introduced innovative choreography and performance techniques to international audiences. This influence was particularly notable in Paris, where the Ballets Russes captivated the public and inspired a new generation of dancers and choreographers. Russian ballet&#x27;s emphasis on technical precision, expressive movement, and dramatic storytelling has become a cornerstone of classical ballet training worldwide. The cross-cultural exchange fostered by Russian ballet has enriched the global dance community, making it a vital contributor to the evolution of ballet as an art form.

== Ballets Russes ==
By the early 1900s, the Russian ballet went beyond its borders and infiltrated Paris. It had become its own force and was distinctly Russian, while still being embraced by the Parisian society. In 1903 Ivan Clustine, a Russian dancer and choreographer who had started his career at the Bolshoi Theatre, was appointed Maître de ballet at the Paris Opera. Clustine&#x27;s hiring promoted a frenzy of questions about his nationality and choreographic agenda: &quot;His hiring was thought a direct attempt by the Opera to imitate the Russian company; even he thought as much, maintaining, not without despondency, that inspiration too often came from the north: &#x27;A revolution! A method that people often apply in the country of the tsars.&#x27; Clustine, although acknowledging his nationality with pride, harbored none of the revolutionary intentions that some thought an inevitable consequence of being Russian.&quot;

The Parisians, while denying adoption of the backwards Russian troupe, had distinct Russian influence in their theater. &quot;Despite Clustine&#x27;s protestations, several features of the Opera&#x27;s post-1909 ballets, along with its institutional conventions and balletic policy, appeared to betray a Russian influence.&quot; The stigma of Russian brutality and force was applied even in Paris. While their style was not only being accepted in Paris, but implemented in Paris theaters, the Ballets Russes were still considered dangerous, even in the theatre of performing art. &quot;The Ballets Russes, at base, became a metaphor for invasion, an eternal force that could engulf and control, could penetrate the membrane of French society, culture and even art itself.&quot; The embracing of Russian ballet in the Paris society became a point of contention and French nationalism collided with Russian determination. Questions arose about the Russian intention in the Paris theaters under the title &quot;cultural politics&quot; including &quot;the delimitation of boundaries, the preservation of identity and the nature of relational engagements.&quot;

== Impact of the Ballets Russes ==
As early as the 1900s, the Russian ballet had ventured beyond its domestic sphere and enthralled spectators in Paris, an important development. To cement Russian influence in Paris, Ivan Clustine, a Russian dancer, and choreographer originally from the Bolshoi Theatre was appointed as the Paris Opera’s Maître de ballet in 1903. When Clustine was appointed, more doubts concerning his nationality and its influence on his creativity arose due to many people’s view of Clustine’s appointment as the Paris Opera’s attempt to establish a ballet company following the model of the Russian ballet company. However, Clustine professed pride in his nationality and there are apparent carry-overs of the Russian influence in the productions of the Opera post 1909 and a few organisational structures. While the society of Paris fought against the incursion of what was referred to as ‘Russian ballet,’ it is possible to argue that though to a certain extent, the French theater culture embraced some ideas of Russian spirit and many aspects of the so-called ‘Russian ballet. This was not a mere theatrical group that staged ballets, no, Ballets Russes was a symbol of cultural and art interchange. Based on these concerns, it becomes evident how, as Russian ballet emerged into the global sphere and as the Russian influence grown stronger in other countries, it elicited debates on issues such as cultural imperialism, assimilation, and performance in the global realm.

== Ballet companies ==
The first ballet company was the Imperial School of Ballet in St. Petersburg in the 1740s. Sergey Diaghilev, (1872–1929), an enormously important figure in the Russian ballet scene, founded the ballet company Ballets Russes in 1909. Diaghilev intervened in every aspect of ballet – direction, production, lighting, scenery, and performance. He headquartered his ballet company in Paris. A protégé of Diaghilev, George Balanchine, founded the New York City Ballet in 1948. Today, the Kirov Ballet company (now known as the Mariinsky Ballet) and the Bolshoi company are two world-renowned Russian ballet companies that tour the world.
*Mariinsky Ballet (formerly Kirov ballet)
*Bolshoi Ballet

Other Russian ballet companies include:

*Ballets Russes, founded in 1909
*Moscow State Academy of Choreography, commonly known as The Bolshoi Ballet Academy, founded in 1773
*Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet, founded in 1738 as the Imperial Ballet School
*Saint Petersburg Eifman Ballet, founded in 1977
*Mikhailovsky Theatre Ballet, founded in the 1930s
*Perm Theatre Ballet, founded in 1896
*Novosibirsk Theatre Ballet, founded in 1945
*Russian State Ballet of Siberia, founded in 1978

A number of companies have been called, or included in their name, &quot;Moscow Ballet&quot;.

==Methods==
Several methods exist in Russian ballet. The most widely used is the Vaganova method, named after the ballerina and teacher Agrippina Vaganova.

==Notable dancers==

Many dancers in the style of Russian ballet have gone on to reach worldwide acclaim. Notable dancers include:

<text>Gurúè (also spelt Gurué; known before independence as Vila Junqueiro) is a town located in the northern part of Mozambique, near the center of the province of Zambezia. It serves as the principal town of Gurué District, and is Mozambique&#x27;s largest tea estate. According to the 2007 census, the town had a population of 145,466, an increase from the 99,335 inhabitants counted in the 1997 census.

== History ==

=== Portuguese rule ===
The name Gurúè is said to be local tribal dialect (Lomwe) for &quot;porco do mato&quot; (peccary), or the name of a local tribal chief. Gurúè was founded and named by the Portuguese in the 19th century and developed as a major tea producing town starting in the 1930s. The Portuguese authorities promoted a thriving economic climate and local tea companies become major players in the industry. SDZ Cha, Chá Moçambique, Companhia da Zambézia, Chá Gurúè and Plantações Manuel Saraiva Junqueiro were the major tea companies headquartered in the town. With good natural attractions - Namuli mountain range (2419 m), large tea plantations (&quot;chá&quot; in Portuguese), and rivers, leading tea brands, such as Cha St Antonio, Cha Murrace, &quot;Chá Moçambique&quot;, &quot;Chá Licungo&quot;, &quot;Chá Gurúè&quot;, and &quot;Chá Montebranco Junqueiro&quot;, achieved international recognition – most of the production was exported to the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. Other agricultural activities were developed as well. In the 1940s, over 300 Portuguese lived in the small town of Gurúè which gravitated around the tea aristocracy who provided all the amenities for the entire working population, including a private small airline to the largest cities on the coast, like Nampula, and the port city of Quelimane, the capital of Zambezia, in Portuguese East Africa. After the death of tea tycoon Manuel Saraiva Junqueiro, in an airplane crash, the town of Gurúè was renamed Vila Junqueiro in October 1959. By the late 1950s the town had grown, the cinema was founded and TAZ airline (Transportes Aéreos da Zambézia) increased its flights in the town&#x27;s airfield. Under Portuguese administration the town expanded harmoniously in terms of urbanism and architectural landscape.

=== After independence from Portugal ===
After the independence of Mozambique from Portugal in 1975, Vila Junqueiro returned to its original name, Gurúè, and started a process of deep deterioration and economic and social decline. The exodus of the Portuguese, the eruption of the Mozambican Civil War (1977-1992) and the effects of FRELIMO&#x27;s communist ideology, transformed the once thriving town in a few years.

== Geography ==
Gurué is located in the North of the Zambezia province, 350 km from the next international Airport in Blantyre, Malawi and also 350 km from Quelimane or Nampula, two of Mozambique&#x27;s biggest cities.
It is located at longitude 37 degrees 1 minute East and latitude 15 degrees 30 minutes South.

=== Climate ===
Gurúè has a temperate climate. Summers have temperatures in the range of 30 °C to 34 °C. Winters have temperatures in the range of 17 °C to 20 °C. Like in tropical climates, winter is usually referred to as the dry season, while summer is called the rainy season. Gurué&#x27;s climate has much more rainfall than most of the rest of the province due to the effect of the mountains that surround the town. It creates a microclimate which is unusually cool and wet and therefore good for growing tea.

== Economy ==
Gurúè&#x27;s economy depends mainly on the tea plantations (90%), though other plantation types can also be found such as coffee, fruit, etc. Most people also have small subsistence farms to supplement their irregular salaries.

== Demographics ==
According to Mozambique&#x27;s Government 1997 census, Gurúè&#x27;s population was estimated at 99,335 and in the 2007 census at 145,466. Most people in the area speak Lomwe.

== Transportation ==
Gurúè can be reached by car. One aerodrome is available for small aero planes. At present some South African investors engaged in Macadamia nuts use the aerodrome. Chartered planes could land at Gurue. The roads were tarred and in good condition until the floods of 2015.

== Wildlife ==
A 1998 birding expedition to Gurúè re-discovered the country&#x27;s only endemic bird, Namuli apalis, unseen since it was discovered in 1932. It is now known to be thriving in forests in this area.
According to a recent University of Cape Town scientific expedition &quot;in a land of many natural treasures, Namuli (a mount near Gurúè, with 2419m and being the second highest mountain in Mozambique) is the jewel in the crown&quot; and &quot;a high-priority site for birds in Africa&quot;.

SDZ Cha, one of the tea plantation companies, maintain amidst their estate a small patch of rainforest, preserving the pristine nature. They also have some camp huts which are rented out for tourists.

<text>Mordechai Meirovitz (born 1930 in Romania) is an Israeli telecommunications expert and games maker.

Meirovitz invented the code-breaking board game &quot;Master Mind&quot;. After being rejected by leading games companies, he sparked the interest of a Leicester-based company, Invicta Plastics, which restyled and renamed the game. Released in 1971, the game sold over 50 million sets in 80 countries, making it the most successful new game of the 1970s.

In Israel, the game is marketed as &quot;Bul pgi&#x27;a&quot; ().

<text>The Marquis of Kensington was a British studio project from the end of the 1960s. It consisted of Robert Wace, then manager of The Kinks, and the record producer Mike Leander (1941–1996). While the project&#x27;s vocals are Wace&#x27;s, Leander was featured on the single covers. Wace wanted to remain incognito.

The duo released three singles:
*&quot;The Changing Of The Guard&quot; / &quot;Reverse Thrust&quot; (instrumental) (May 1967)
*&quot;Sister Marie&quot; / &quot;Flash&quot; (instrumental) (Feb 1968)
*&quot;It Might As Well Rain Until September&quot; / &quot;Folks In The City&quot; (Nov 1968)
In 1970, a cover of &quot;Flash&quot; by Italian instrumentalist Mario Battaini reached number 11 in the Dutch Top 40. He had released the song as The Duke of Burlington.

<text>AppleTalk Remote Access (ARA) was a protocol stack that allowed AppleTalk to be run over modems. It became a fairly major product for Apple Computer in the early to mid-1990s when their first portable and laptop computers were available (and very popular). ARA slowly disappeared in the late 1990s when TCP/IP took over the vast majority of networking needs, notably remote access.

Most networking protocols have strong &quot;layering&quot; that separates the various jobs inside the protocol into different pieces of software. This allows them to be run on top of any hardware by replacing the lowest level of the &quot;stack&quot;, the hardware drivers. For instance, IP can be made to run on a variety of Ethernet cards or even Token Ring with little effort. For slower speeds, like on modems, things become somewhat more difficult, as the protocols often have invisible assumptions about timing and performance that make it inefficient on links with very limited bandwidth.

AppleTalk included several protocols that made this even more difficult. In particular, AppleTalk had several internal tasks for discovery and naming that ran all the time and made the protocol &quot;chatty&quot;. This added to the bandwidth problems, making it even less efficient in this case.

Thus ARA was considerably more complex than similar solutions for IP, replacing many parts of the AppleTalk stack and seriously modifying others. As a result, ARA was quite large, larger than the basic AppleTalk stack, and somewhat memory hungry. It was also slow, a problem it shared with IP at similar speeds. Nevertheless, ARA was the only protocol available for remote access on the Mac, and also shared the typical Apple properties of being easy to install, set up and run. It became a fairly profitable product on its own, and was sold widely in stores.

The introduction of SLIP and the increased use of IP on the Macintosh led to some infighting within Apple as the profits from ARA were reduced. This led Apple to place their IP remote access software in ARA as well, although this had the side effect of making various freeware implementations much more popular. As support for TCP/IP was added, the product line became known as Apple Remote Access. Later versions supported AppleTalk connections over ARAP and TCP/IP connections over PPP.

ARA remained important, if somewhat less so, product for Apple into the late 1990s. In Mac OS X it is no longer required, as Apple has migrated the vast majority of its networking software to IP, and includes remote access software for free.

<doc id="1325866" wikidata="Q64966" url="?curid=1325866" title="Martin Noth">
<text>Martin Noth (3 August 1902 – 30 May 1968) was a German scholar of the Hebrew Bible who specialized in the pre-Exilic history of the Hebrews and promoted the hypothesis that the Israelite tribes in the immediate period after the settlement in Canaan were organised as a group of twelve tribes arranged around a central sanctuary on the lines of the later Greek and Italian amphictyonies. With Gerhard von Rad he pioneered the traditional-historical approach to biblical studies, emphasising the role of oral traditions in the formation of the biblical texts.

==Life==

Noth was born in Dresden, Kingdom of Saxony. He studied at the universities of Erlangen, Rostock, and Leipzig and taught at Greifswald and Königsberg.

From 1939 to 1941 and 1943–45, Noth served as a German soldier during World War II. After the war he taught at Bonn, Göttingen, Tübingen, Hamburg, and University of Basel. He died during an expedition in the Negev, Israel.

==Influence==
Noth first attracted widespread attention with &quot;Das System der zwölf Stämme Israels&quot; (&quot;The Scheme of the Twelve Tribes of Israel&quot;, 1930), positing that the Twelve Tribes of Israel did not exist prior to the covenant assembly at Shechem described in the Book of Joshua.

&quot;A History of Pentateuchal Traditions&quot; (1948, English translation 1972) set out a new model for the composition of the Pentateuch, or Torah. Noth supplemented the dominant model of the time, the documentary hypothesis, seeing the Pentateuch as composed of blocks of traditional material accreted round some key historical experiences. He identified these experiences as &quot;Guidance out of Egypt&quot;, &quot;Guidance into the Arable Land&quot;, &quot;Promise to the Patriarchs&quot;, &quot;Guidance in the Wilderness&quot; and &quot;Revelation at Sinai&quot;, the details of the narrative serving to fill out the thematic outline. Later, Robert Polzin showed that some of his main conclusions were consistent with arbitrary or inconsistent use of the rules that he proposed.

Even more revolutionary and influential, and quite reorienting the emphasis of modern scholarship, was &quot;The Deuteronomistic History&quot;. In this work, Noth argued that the earlier theory of several Deuteronomist redactions of the books from Joshua to Kings did not explain the facts, and instead proposed that they formed a unified &quot;Deuteronomic history&quot;, the product of a single author working in the late 7th century.

Noth also published commentaries on all the five books of the Pentateuch: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Noth considered that the book of Deuteronomy was more closely related to the following books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings (&quot;The Deuteronomistic History&quot;). This theory is widely accepted today, and provides the framework for current research on the historical books of the Old Testament.

<text>Pliosauroidea is an extinct clade of plesiosaurs, known from the earliest Jurassic to early Late Cretaceous. They are best known for the subclade Thalassophonea, which contained crocodile-like short-necked forms with large heads and massive toothed jaws, commonly known as pliosaurs. More primitive non-thalassophonean pliosauroids resembled plesiosaurs in possessing relatively long necks and smaller heads. They originally included only members of the family Pliosauridae, of the order Plesiosauria, but several other genera and families are now also included, the number and details of which vary according to the classification used.

The distinguishing characteristics are a short neck and an elongated head, with larger hind flippers compared to the fore flippers, the opposite of the plesiosaurs. They were carnivorous and their long and powerful jaws carried many sharp, conical teeth. Pliosaurs range from 4 to 10 meters or more in length. Their prey may have included fish, sharks, ichthyosaurs, dinosaurs and other plesiosaurs.

The largest known species are &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; and &quot;Pliosaurus macromerus&quot;; other well known genera include &quot;Rhomaleosaurus&quot;, &quot;Peloneustes&quot;, and &quot;Macroplata&quot;. Fossil specimens have been found in Africa, Australia, China, Europe, North America and South America.

Many very early (from the Early Jurassic and possibly Latest Triassic, i.e. Rhaetian) primitive pliosauroids were very like plesiosauroids in appearance and, indeed, used to be included in the family Plesiosauridae.

==Name==

Pliosauroidea was named by Welles in 1943. It is adapted from the name of the genus &quot;Pliosaurus&quot;, which is derived from the Greek (), meaning &quot;more/closely&quot;, and () meaning &quot;lizard&quot;; it therefore means &quot;more saurian&quot;. The name &quot;Pliosaurus&quot; was coined in 1841 by Richard Owen, who believed that it represented a link between plesiosauroids and crocodilians (considered a type of &quot;saurian&quot;), particularly due to their crocodile-like teeth.

==Classification==

===Taxonomy===


The taxonomy presented here is mainly based on the plesiosaur cladistic analysis proposed by Hilary F. Ketchum and Roger B. J. Benson, 2011 unless otherwise noted.

===Phylogeny===

Pliosauroidea is a stem-based taxon that was defined by Welles as &quot;all taxa more closely related to &quot;Pliosaurus brachydeirus&quot; than to &quot;Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus&quot;&quot;. Pliosauridae and Rhomaleosauridae are stem-based taxa too. Pliosauridae is defined as &quot;all taxa more closely related to &quot;Pliosaurus brachydeirus&quot; than to &quot;Leptocleidus superstes&quot;, &quot;Polycotylus latipinnis&quot; or &quot;Meyerasaurus victor&quot;&quot;. Rhomaleosauridae is defined as &quot;all taxa more closely related to &quot;Meyerasaurus victor&quot; than to &quot;Leptocleidus superstes&quot;, &quot;Pliosaurus brachydeirus&quot; or &quot;Polycotylus latipinnis&quot;&quot;. The cladogram below follows a 2011 analysis by paleontologists Hilary F. Ketchum and Roger B. J. Benson, and reduced to genera only.

==Large pliosauroids==
In 2002, the discovery of a very large pliosauroid was announced in Mexico. This pliosauroid came to be known as the &quot;Monster of Aramberri&quot;. Although widely reported as such, it does not belong to the genus &quot;Liopleurodon&quot;. The remains of this animal, consisting of a partial vertebral column, were dated to the Kimmeridgian of the La Caja Formation. The fossils were found much earlier, in 1985, by a geology student and were at first erroneously attributed to a theropod dinosaur by Hahnel. The remains originally contained part of a rostrum with teeth (now lost).

In August 2006, palaeontologists of the University of Oslo discovered the first remains of a pliosaur on Norwegian soil. The remains were described as &quot;very well preserved, as well as being unique in their completeness&quot;. The large animal was determined to be a new species of &quot;Pliosaurus&quot;. In the summer of 2008, the fossil remains of the huge pliosaur were dug up from the permafrost on Svalbard, a Norwegian island close to the North Pole. The excavation of the find is documented in the 2009 History television special Predator X.
On 26 October 2009, palaeontologists reported the discovery of potentially the largest pliosauroid yet found. Found in cliffs near Weymouth, Dorset, on Britain&#x27;s Jurassic Coast, the fossil had a skull length of . Palaeontologist Richard Forrest told the BBC: &quot;I had heard rumours that something big was turning up. But seeing this thing in the flesh, so to speak, is just jaw dropping. It is simply enormous.&quot; It was determined that the specimen belonged to a new species that scientists named &quot;Pliosaurus kevani&quot;. 

In December 2023, the recent discovery of a pliosaur skull on the Dorset coast was described as &quot;one of the most complete specimens of its type ever discovered&quot;. The discovery and research of the skull was covered in the PBS documentary &quot;Attenborough and the Jurassic Sea Monster&quot; hosted by David Attenborough.

<text>Deflection routing is a routing strategy for networks based on packet switching which can reduce the need of buffering packets. Every packet has preferred outputs along which it wants to leave the router, and when possible, a packet is sent along one of these outputs. However, two or more packets may want to leave along the same output (which is referred to as a &quot;contention among packets&quot;), and then only one of the packets may be sent along the link, while the others are sent along available outputs, even though the other links are not preferred by the packets (because, for instance, those links do not yield shortest paths).

Depending on the rate of incoming packets and the capacity of the outgoing links, deflection routing can work without any packet buffering. Of course, it is always possible to simply drop packets in a network with a best-effort delivery strategy.

<text>During the heyday of rail transportation in the first half of the 20th century, Chicago, Illinois, reigned as the undisputed railroad center of the United States and was served by six intercity train terminals at its peak. With the decline of passenger rail in the United States, service was consolidated at Union Station with inter-city Amtrak trains. Commuter railroad Metra continues passenger service at LaSalle Street Station, Millennium Station, and Ogilvie Transportation Center, as well as Union Station. Three Metra services are operated by the Union Pacific Railroad, while another is operated by the BNSF Railway. The South Shore Line, an independent commuter/interurban line operates out of Millennium Station. Most of the terminals that were in the downtown area were called the &quot;Chicago Loop&quot;. Ogilvie Station and Union Station were west of the Chicago River and the Loop; Wells Station was north of the river and the Loop.

The table below shows all railroads that have served downtown Chicago and what terminal they used.

Services partially replaced by or wholly discontinued with Amtrak or Metra are marked in Bold.

NOTE: From 1883 to 1892, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad had a depot between Madison and Monroe Streets, trackage rights via the Illinois Central Railroad.

The New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (&quot;Nickel Plate Road&quot;) used the Illinois Central Railroad local station at 22nd Street in 1882, and the B&amp;O depot in 1883.

Future tenants of Dearborn Station used the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad depot at 12th and State between 1880 and 1885.

The Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway used its own depot before gaining access to 12th and State depot in 1882.

The Chicago, Terre Haute and Southeastern Railway, later part of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (&quot;Milwaukee Road&quot;), never had passenger service in the Chicago area.

The Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad and the Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad used tracks of the Chicago &quot;L&quot;, specifically the Loop Elevated and Wells Street Terminal.

The Chicago and Joliet Electric Railway had a terminal at Archer Avenue and Cicero Avenue.

In the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire, a C&amp;NW freight depot at State and Water Streets was used as a temporary passenger depot since Wells Street Station had burned.

&quot;Canal Street&quot; refers to two depots: the C&amp;NW depot (former Chicago, St. Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad) and the original Galena and Chicago Union Railroad depot (later used by the Chicago and Milwaukee Railway). Both burned in 1871, only the C&amp;NW depot was rebuilt.

<text>Ernst Freiherr Stromer von Reichenbach (born on 12th of June, 1871 in Nürnberg, died on 18th of December, 1952 in Erlangen) was a German paleontologist best remembered for his expedition to Egypt, during which the discovery of the first known remains of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was made. 

Stromer described several discoveries made in Egypt, including a few dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period discovered in Egypt (&quot;Aegyptosaurus,&quot; &quot;Bahariasaurus&quot;, and &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;), an enigmatic theropod (&quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot;) and a giant crocodilian (&quot;Stomatosuchus&quot;).

In 1929 fossil bird genus &quot;Stromeria&quot; (now included in the genus &quot;Eremopezus&quot;) were named in Stromer’s honour by Kálmán Lambrecht. Smith et al. (2001) also named the sauropod &quot;Paralititan stromeri&quot; in his honour. 

Many of the fossils discovered by Stromer were destroyed during World War II, leaving today’s scientists only a few photographs of the previously existing specimens to rely on.

==Biography==
Ernst Stromer had an aristocratic standing in German society (the &quot;Freiherr&quot; in his name roughly equals &quot;baron&quot; in English); his father had been the mayor in his home city of Nuremberg, and his ancestors had been lawyers, courtiers, scientists, architects, and other leaders. Stromer did not support the Nazi party.

Ernst Stromer was married to Elisabeth Rennebaum (1886-1977) in 1920 and had three sons (Ulman, Wolfgang, and Gerhart), all of whom served in the German army during World War II . Two died during the conflict, while the third, Wolfgang, was taken prisoner by the Soviets and was believed to have died until he was returned to Germany in 1950.

== Egypt Expedition==

===Arrival===

On 7 November 1910, Stromer arrived in Alexandria, Egypt, aboard the Norddeutscher Lloyd steamship &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. After a two-day setback imposed by a temporary quarantine, the expedition set out by train to arrive in Cairo the next day.

After checking into the hotel in Cairo, Stromer found a letter of welcome waiting for him at the post office from the director of the Geological Survey of Egypt. Stromer visited the office of George Steindorff, a reputable German Egyptologist, as a matter of courtesy and to plan the future expedition.

On 14 November, Stromer went to meet with John Ball, the founder of the Desert Survey Department of the Geological Survey of Egypt. In that year, the survey had published the first topographic map of Egypt and was finishing a geological map that was to be published in 1911. Both sources were invaluable to Stromer, now planning his upcoming expedition to Bahariya, an area of the Western Desert that was little known.

Richard Markgraf, a German guide who lived South of Cairo, met Stromer during the winter of 1901–1902 and got along very well. Markgraf was Stromer&#x27;s &quot;Sammler&quot;, or fossil collector, for 10½ years, and became Stromer&#x27;s friend. Markgraf, however, was often ill. It is unclear whether the cause was malaria, intestinal bleeding from typhoid, or chronic amebic dysentery.

The plan for the expedition contained three parts; first, Stromer and Markgraf would travel northwest from Cairo to Wadi el Natrun. After exploring the area for a few weeks, they would return to Cairo, replenish their supplies, and afterward head south to Luxor to explore the eastern slopes of the Nile Valley. The last part of the expedition would be spent exploring the Bahariya Oasis.

=== Beginning of the expedition ===
Stromer and Markgraf began the expedition with the goal of discovering fossil mammals to support Stromer’s theory of an African origin of humanity.

Stromer&#x27;s 1910 journals from Wadi el Natrun reveal that he worked all through the day, hiking for miles, climbing hills, and hammering pieces of rock from outcroppings throughout the valley. He discovered sharks&#x27; teeth, broken shells of ancient turtles, and the occasional jaw of a prehistoric crocodile. Despite these discoveries, his failure to uncover ancient mammals left him disappointed and he returned to Cairo.

Markgraf, who stayed in Wadi el Natron after Stromer’s return to Cairo, discovered the skull of &quot;Libypithecus markgrafi&quot;.

The second stage of the expedition took them to a location far up the Nile in December. This location yielded little success.

The third stage of the expedition was delayed due to Markgraf becoming ill and being unable to proceed to the Bahariya Oasis. Stromer found a dragoman who could function as a guide and translator.

On 3 January 1911, the expedition left for the Western Desert. The caravan was significantly slowed as they had to find grazing areas for the camels because one of the team members hadn’t bought fodder for the animals.

After more than a week of walking, they arrived in the Bahariya Oasis on January 11, 1911. Due to the inaccuracy of the understanding of the geologic history of the Bahariya Oasis in 1911, Stromer erroneously believed the oasis to date to the Eocene rather than Cretaceous.

=== Discoveries ===
On 14 January, the weather eased and the expedition was able to begin. That first day, Stromer was able to find a fossilized shark vertebrae, fish teeth, and some petrified wood. On January 18, he found &quot;three large bones which I attempt to excavate and photograph. The upper extremity is heavily weathered and incomplete [but] measures 110 cm long and 15 cm thick. The second and better one underneath is probably a femur [thighbone] and is wholly 95 cm long and, in the middle, also 15 cm thick. The third is too deep in the ground and will require too much time to recover.&quot; He also discovered that morning an ischium (one of the pelvic bones of a dinosaur), another vertebrae with &quot;a convex end,&quot; and what he described as &quot;a gigantic claw&quot;. He cut up his mosquito netting and soaked them in a flour and water paste, covering the two larger bones in this wrapping.
He moved the expedition to the area near Gebel Hammad the next day. Several dinosaur, fish, and shark bones were found there, but after little more was recovered, they packed up and, two days later, left for the village of Ghauraq.

On 18 February 1911, Stromer began his long trip back to Germany where he would describe his finds including the large spinosaurid, &quot;Spinosaurus aegypticus&quot;, and the carcharodontosaurid, &quot;Carcharodontosaurus saharicus&quot;.

== Destruction of Stromer&#x27;s collection==
In 1944, towards the end of World War II, the vast majority of Stromer&#x27;s fossil collection—including the only known (though incomplete) skeletons of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Aegyptosaurus&quot;—was destroyed when the museum in which it was held in Munich was bombed by the British Royal Air Force during a raid.

<text>The SR N15X class or &quot;Remembrance&quot; class were a design of British 4-6-0 steam locomotives converted in 1934 by Richard Maunsell of the Southern Railway from the large LB&amp;SCR L class 4-6-4 tank locomotives that had become redundant on the London–Brighton line following electrification. It was hoped that further service could be obtained from these locomotives on the Southern&#x27;s Western Section, sharing the duties of the N15 class locomotives. The locomotives were named after famous Victorian engineers except for &quot;Remembrance&quot;, which was the LBSCR&#x27;s memorial locomotive for staff members who died in the First World War.

In their new form the locomotives were similar in outline to the N15 class, though suffered from the expectation amongst crews that they were an improved version of this type. Despite this, their ability to accelerate well was put to good use on cross-country trains between main lines. The class saw service into nationalisation in 1948. All had been withdrawn by 1957, with none preserved.

== Background ==

In the early 1930s, with the impending electrification of the Southern Railway&#x27;s Central Section (the former LB&amp;SCR lines), the question arose as to what to do with the relatively new and powerful LB&amp;SCR designs. Maunsell looked at the possibility of converting the LB&amp;SCR “Remembrance” or L class 4-6-4 tanks built by L. B. Billinton between 1914 and 1922. These Baltics had proved to be capable machines on the Brighton line, although their relatively low boiler pressure (), the excessive difference between &quot;first valve&quot; and &quot;second valve&quot; on the regulator, and more particularly their small () piston valves in relation to their large () cylinders were a significant limitation, precluding their use on any other part of the Southern system. The limited coal and water capacity also limited their range, though adequate for the short runs on the Brighton line. The decision was taken to rebuild them into more conventional 4-6-0 tender locomotives.

==Conversion==

All seven of the Billinton L Class locomotives entered Eastleigh works in 1934 for rebuilding, each leaving the works the same year. Conversion into the 4-6-0 tender type, entailed removing the trailing bogie, water tanks, and bunker, shortening the mainframes and fitting new cabs; these were of the side-window variety already used on the Lord Nelson class. At the same time there was a revision of the locomotives&#x27; front end arrangement incorporating a &quot;King Arthur&quot; N15 type of blast pipe and chimney; boiler pressure was increased to , whilst the piston diameter was marginally decreased from to . 

The class received bogie tenders from Robert Urie&#x27;s S15 class and Southern-type smoke deflectors on either side of the smokebox. The result was classified N15X, the suffix corresponding to the old LBSCR designation for a rebuilt/modified locomotive. The conversion process created a locomotive that was similar in appearance to the N15 &quot;King Arthur&quot; class as modified by Maunsell in the 1920s.

===Naming the locomotives===

Two of the locomotives retained their original names: number 2333 &quot;Remembrance&quot; and 2329 &quot;Stephenson,&quot; whilst the other members of the L class, were newly named after famous railway engineers. The new locomotive names were suggested by Maunsell&#x27;s assistant, Harry Holcroft, and were distributed as thus:

2327 &quot;Trevithick&quot;, 
2328 &quot;Hackworth&quot;, 
2329 &quot;Stephenson&quot;, 
2330 &quot;Cudworth&quot;, 
2331 &quot;Beattie&quot;, 
2332 &quot;Stroudley&quot;, 
2333 &quot;Remembrance&quot;

2333 &quot;Remembrance&quot; retained its name as it had been the LBSCR&#x27;s designated memorial to employees lost in the First World War. However the original LBSCR nameplates were straight for water tank mounting, necessitating new rounded plates to fit over the central wheel splashers (see colour plate in infobox above).

== Operational details ==

The rebuilding caused a certain amount of controversy among footplate crews, with some maintaining that one could not make so many changes and have a reliable locomotive at the end of the process. The class suffered on the South Western section from the expectation that they were an improved version of the N15 &quot;King Arthur&quot; class. Once this misconception was overcome, the class came into their own on the Basingstoke services, where their ability to accelerate well was put to good use. However, the rebuilds gained a reputation for rough riding and relatively poor efficiency when compared to the N15s, and were dissimilar in performance to the original L class locomotives, making them unpopular with crews. Because of this, the class was used on secondary duties, cross-country and inter-regional trains around Basingstoke rather than the heavy London to Exeter expresses for which they were intended. 

Several of the class were loaned to the Great Western Railway between 1942 and 1944 to assist in bolstering freight power, of which there was an acute shortage on that railway during the Second World War. The class saw use after nationalisation in 1948, but with increasing numbers of Bulleid Pacifics able to take over their duties the &quot;Remembrance&quot; class began to be withdrawn from service during the mid-1950s. &quot;Hackworth&quot; was the first to be withdrawn, in 1955, and finally &quot;Beattie&quot; in 1957. The early withdrawal of the class ensured that none were preserved.

==Accidents and incidents==
*In 1940, No. 2328 Hackworth was at the Nine Elms shed when it and LSWR T14 No. 458 and four LSWR Class N15 express engines which included 751 Etarre, No. 755 The Red Knight, No. 775 Sir Agravaine, and No. 776 Sir Galagars suffered air raid damage. The T14 engine was scrapped while the other engines were eventually repaired.
*On 23 December 1955, locomotive No. 32327 &quot;Trevithick&quot; was hauling a passenger train that ran into the rear of another at Woking, Surrey. The locomotive was deemed beyond economic repair and was scrapped at Eastleigh Works, Hampshire.

== Livery and numbering ==

=== Southern===

Under Southern ownership, the &quot;Remembrances&quot; were originally painted in Maunsell&#x27;s Olive Green livery as seen above, with &quot;Southern&quot; and the locomotive&#x27;s number on the tender tank. Wartime service under the Southern saw the locomotives painted in black livery with &quot;Sunshine Yellow&quot; lettering. Numbers allocated to the locomotives were 2327 to 2333. After the war, the locomotives were turned out in Bulleid&#x27;s Southern Railway Malachite Green livery with &quot;Sunshine Yellow&quot; lettering.

===British Railways===

After nationalisation in 1948, the locomotives&#x27; initial livery was a slightly modified Southern Malachite Green livery, where &quot;British Railways&quot; replaced &quot;Southern&quot; in &quot;Sunshine Yellow&quot; lettering on the tender sides. From 1949, the class was turned out in British Railways mixed-traffic black livery with red and cream lining. The British Railways crest was placed on the tender water tank sides. Numbering was in the 32xxx series, as numbers 32327 to 32333.

<text>Heihe (; ; Russian: Хэйхэ) is a prefecture-level city of northern Heilongjiang province, China, located on the Russian border, on the south bank of the Amur (Heilong) River, across the river from Blagoveshchensk. At the 2020 census, 1,286,401 people lived in the prefecture-level city of whom 223,832 lived in the built-up area (&quot;or metro&quot;) made of Aihui District.

Heihe marks the northeast terminus of the diagonal Heihe–Tengchong Line, which is sometimes used to divide China into east and west.

==History==
Heihe, formerly Aihui or Aigun, is one of the five oldest cities in Heilongjiang, along with Qiqihar, Yilan, Acheng and Hulan. Human beings started to settle in Heihe region as early as the Paleolithic Age. Later it became home to local tribes. During the Qing dynasty, Heihe was the first place troops sent to Heilongjiang were stationed. The predecessor of today&#x27;s Heihe was the town established by the indigenous Ducher people of the Amur Valley in the mid-1650s. It was established some south of the modern city site (in today&#x27;s Aihui District) and was known as Aigun, Heilongjiang, or Saghalien Ula. (The two last names both mean &quot;the Black Dragon River&quot; - the name for the Amur River in Chinese and Manchu, respectively).

After the Ducher were evacuated by the Qing to the Sungari or Hurka in the 1650s, the Ducher town was probably vacated. However, in 1683-85 the Manchus re-used the site as a base for their campaign against the Russian fort of Albazin. Aigun was the capital (the seat of the military governor) of Heilongjiang from 1683 to 1690, before the capital was moved to Nenjiang (Mergen). After the capture of Albazin in 1685 or 1686, the Qing governor relocated the town to a new site on the right (southwestern) bank of the Amur, about 3 miles downstream from the original. The new site occupied the location of the former village of the Daurian chief named Tolga. The city became known primarily under its Manchu name Saghalien Ula hoton (Manchu: &quot;sahaliyan ula hoton&quot;) and Chinese name Heilongjiang Cheng (), which both mean &quot;Black River City&quot;. Later the governor office was transferred to Qiqihar. However, Aigun remained the seat of the Deputy Lieutenant-General (Fu dutong), responsible for a large district covering much of the Amur Valley within the province of Heilongjiang as it existed in those days. 

Aigun was visited around 1709 as a part of a nationwide Sino-French cartographic program by the Jesuits Jean-Baptiste Régis, Pierre Jartoux, and Xavier Ehrenbert Fridelli, who found it a stronghold, serving as the base of Manchus controlling the Amur River basin.
The Aigun Treaty was concluded at Aigun in 1858. According to this treaty, the left bank of the Amur River was conceded to Czarist Russia.

After the Xinhai Revolution, Aigun became the county seat of the newly created Aigun County by the Republic of China.
On November 15, 1980, Heihe City was established, administering two county-level cities and three counties including Beian, Wudalianchi, Nenjiang, Sunwu and Sunke. Aihui County was abolished, being merged into the Heihe City.

==Geography==
Heihe is located at the South bank of the Amur, opposite to the city of Blagoveshchensk in Russia&#x27;s Amur Oblast. Its jurisdictional area stretches for , which spans from 124° 45&#x27; to 129° 18&#x27; E longitude and 47° 42&#x27; to 51° 03&#x27; N latitude. Domestically, Heihe City borders Da Hinggan Ling Prefecture to the north, Yichun to the southeast, Suihua to the south, Qiqihar to the southwest, and Hulunbuir (Inner Mongolia) to the west. The Amur has formed the Sino-Russian border since the 1858 Aigun Treaty and 1860 Treaty of Peking. The area north of the Amur had previously belonged to Imperial China.

===Climate===
Heihe experiences a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dwb&quot;), but &quot;Dwa&quot; in the south of the prefecture, with long, bitterly cold, windy, but dry winters due to the influence of the Siberian high, and warm, wet summers, due to the East Asian monsoon. Based on data from 1981 to 2010, the monthly daily mean temperature in January, the coldest month, is , and July, the warmest month, averages , with an average annual temperature . Close to two-thirds of the annual precipitation falls in the months of June to August. Extreme temperatures have ranged from to .

==Administrative divisions==
==Transportation==

The transportation to and from Heihe is as follows:

*Highways
** China National Highway 202: Heihe–Dalian via Harbin, Jilin City and Shenyang
** Provincial highways: Heihe–Mohe, etc.
** Blagoveshchensk–Heihe Bridge, completed at the end of 2019, is a 2-lane highway bridge over the Amur to link Blagoveshchensk and Heihe.
*Railway (China Railway): Heihe–Bei&#x27;an to Harbin, Qiqihar and Daqing
*Air: Heihe Aihui Airport

The world&#x27;s first international cable car to Blagoveshchensk has also been proposed to open in 2022.

==Energy==
West of Heihe, there is an HVDC back-to-back station for realizing an interconnection between the power grids of Russia and China with 750 MW transmission capacity.

==Tourism==

Heihe has tourist attractions such as Amur River and and , where people can take a trip to local volcanoes. The Old City of Aigun is a famous historical scenic spot, in which the Treaty of Aigun between China and Russia was signed in the 19th century.

==Sport==
Heihe University () has requested the Russian bandy club SKA Neftyanik to send a coach, offering a one-year contract.

<text>These are the results for the men&#x27;s individual trampoline competition, one of two events of the trampoline discipline contested in the [[gymnastics at the 2004 Summer Olympics]]. The qualification and final rounds took place on August 21 in the Olympic Indoor Hall in Athens.

==Results==

===Qualification===
Sixteen gymnasts competed in the qualification round by performing a compulsory routine followed by a free routine. For the compulsory routine (#1), each gymnast received a score from 0.0 to 10.0 from each of the five execution judges, with the highest and lowest scores being dropped. The free routine (#2) had a similar format but included a difficulty score, determined by two difficulty judges, which was added to the three kept scores from the execution judges. The scores from the two routines were summed to give the total score and the eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final.

===Final===
The eight qualified gymnasts performed a single free routine with the same scoring format as in the qualification round.

<text>Huma County (; Manchu: Hūmar Siyan; ) is a county in the far north of the Heilongjiang province, People&#x27;s Republic of China. The county seat is located on the right (southwestern) bank of the Amur River, a few kilometers upstream from the fall of the Huma River (formerly also known as Houmar) into the Amur. 
It is under the administration of the Daxing&#x27;anling Prefecture.

The opposite side of the Amur River is in Amurskaya Oblast&#x27;, Russia, where there is a village with the same name in Russified form, &quot;Kumara&quot; ()

== History ==
Kumarsk, the predecessor of the present-day Huma, was a fortified Russian town in the Amur River region, founded in 1652 by Yerofey Khabarov and his companions, during his retreat from Achansk, corresponding to the present-day Khabarovsk, where he was besieged by Manchu and Daur allied forces.

On 13 March 1655, the Komar fortress, defended by the ataman Onufriy Stepanov and his 500 Cossacks, was besieged by a Qing army led by Ming&#x27;andali () consisting of 10,000 men. The outnumbered defenders repulsed several assaults. The defeated Manchu lift the siege the following month (on 3 April 1655). The town was ceded to Qing Empire after the treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689.

== Administrative divisions ==
Huma County is divided into 2 towns, 5 townships and 1 ethnic township. 
;2 towns
* Huma ()
* Hanjiayuan ()
;5 townships

;1 ethnic township
* Baiyinna Oroqen ()

==Climate==
Huma County has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwb&quot;) with very warm, humid summers and severely cold, extremely dry winters. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, and although temperatures consistently average above from May to September, the annual mean, at , is low enough to form sporadic permafrost on sheltered sites, which is unusual for areas with this climatic classification. More than 70% of the annual precipitation occurs from June to September. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 52% in May and July to 70% in February, sunshine is generous and the area receives 2,581 hours of bright sunshine annually.

<doc id="1325905" wikidata="Q681359" url="?curid=1325905" title="George Bonham">
<text>Sir Samuel George Bonham, 1st Baronet (Chinese Translated Name 般咸, 文咸 or 文翰) (7 September 1803 – 8 October 1863) was a British colonial governor, who became the 4th Governor of the Straits Settlements and the 3rd Governor of Hong Kong.

==Early life==
Samuel George Bonham was born in Faversham, Kent on 7 September 1803. He was the son of Captain George Bonham, of the maritime service of the East India Company. His mother, Isabella, the daughter of Robert Woodgate, was his father&#x27;s second wife. He had one sister, also called Isabella, who married the Belgian count Ferdinand d&#x27;Oultremont.
His father drowned in 1810.

When he was fifteen, he started working for the East India Company in Bencoolen, Sumatra.

==Governor of Straits Settlements==
Bonham became deputy to the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Kenneth Murchison, in 1833. However, as Murchison was away from Southeast Asia for much of his governorship, Bonham was in effect responsible for the administration of the Straits Settlements. He took over from Murchison as Governor on 18 November 1836, a post he held until January 1843. He first governed from Penang, but later made Singapore the permanent residence of the Governor. During his governorship, Singapore grew in commercial importance as well as strategic significance as it supplied provisions for warships on their way to the Opium War in China. He was involved in the partial abolition of bond slavery, and provided a ship to combat piracy in the region. In an attempt to reduce the cost of administration, he reduced the number of senior officials from 19 to 8.

==Governor of Hong Kong==
After a period of service with the East India Company, Bonham was appointed Governor of Hong Kong and plenipotentiary and superintendent of trade in China on 21 March 1848. During his tenure Bonham cut government spendings to balance the budget and also stimulated the Real Estate market in order to increase government income. His method of increasing government income eventually became the major source of income for the Hong Kong government a century later.

Bonham was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in April 1848.

Bonham was known for his calm demeanor and gentle nature. It was due to these qualities that he gained the trust of the British Government and the good relationship of many Hong Kong people.

In 1850, upon his request to the Viceroy, a successful expedition was conducted against the pirates in the neighborhood of Hong Kong, and Bonham attempted to open direct communication with the central government at Peking, and in furtherance of this object sent Mr Medhurst to the Hai River with a dispatch, but the effort proved fruitless.

In 1853 after fall of Nanjing in 1853 during the Taiping Rebellion, the British became fearful of their foreign concession in Shanghai. After realizing the potential danger, Bonham called for a volunteer force to be created in Shanghai which would ultimately become the Shanghai Volunteer Corps which would participate in the Battle of Muddy Flat. 

Bonham retired from the position of Governor in Hong Kong in April 1854 and returned to England.

==Baronet of Malmesbury==
In November 1850 Bonham was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) as a reward for his services in China, and following his return to England a Baronetcy was conferred upon him on 27 November 1852.

==Personal life==
In 1846, Bonham married Ellen Emelia Barnard, the eldest daughter of Thomas Barnard. They had one son, George Francis Bonham (28 August 1847 – 31 July 1927), who succeeded to the Baronetcy. Bonham&#x27;s wife died in 1859 and he survived her until 8 October 1863, dying aged 60, of undisclosed causes. He was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

==Legacy==
Fort Canning Hill in Singapore was formerly named after Bonham as (Malay: Sir Bonham&#x27;s Hill), as was Bonham Street near Raffles Place, Singapore. Bonham Road and Bonham Strand on Hong Kong Island were also named after him.

<text>Robert Conrad Flynn (born Lawrence Matthew Cardine; July 19, 1967) is an American musician best known as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for heavy metal band Machine Head. Flynn formed the band along with Adam Duce, Logan Mader and Tony Costanza after leaving Bay Area thrash band Vio-lence.

== Life and career ==
Flynn was born Lawrence Matthew Cardine in Oakland, California. Flynn cited Black Sabbath as his biggest influence and the reason he plays guitar. Other influences include Bay Area thrash metal bands like Exodus, Metallica, Slayer and hardcore punk/crossover thrash groups such as Dead Kennedys, D.R.I., and Suicidal Tendencies.

Flynn joined the thrash metal band Forbidden (originally Forbidden Evil), while in his graduating year at American High School. He played in this band from 1985 to 1987. He wrote four songs which appeared on their debut album, &quot;Chalice of Blood&quot;, &quot;Forbidden Evil&quot;, &quot;As Good As Dead&quot;, and part of &quot;March into Fire&quot;, but left before an album was released to join local thrash metal rivals Vio-lence, alongside Phil Demmel. Flynn then went on to form Machine Head, with the debut album &quot;Burn My Eyes&quot;.

In January 2005, he was selected as one of the four team captains of Roadrunner United, an act to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Roadrunner Records. Flynn wrote, produced and recorded guitar on four songs, these were &quot;The Rich Man&quot;, &quot;Independent (Voice of the Voiceless)&quot;, &quot;Army of the Sun&quot; and &quot;The Dagger&quot; and on the latter he sang and wrote lyrics alongside Howard Jones of Killswitch Engage.

Machine Head&#x27;s album &quot;The Blackening&quot; (2007) climbed to number 54 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; after appearing on the charts only two weeks previously; it was also nominated for a Grammy Award, making it by far the band&#x27;s most successful album. On June 11, 2007, Flynn received the Metal Hammer 2007 Golden God Award. In honor of Debbie Abono and Ronnie James Dio, Flynn recorded and released for free online a cover of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Die Young&quot;. Abono managed Flynn and Phil Demmel when they were members of Vio-lence.

In December 2013, Flynn and fellow Machine Head guitarist Phil Demmel collaborated with online education site JamPlay.com to put together a series of guitar lessons for aspiring guitarists and members of JamPlay.

Flynn had a break-in at his house in which several items, including guitars, were stolen. One guitar, the Washburn 333 or &quot;Dimebolt&quot;, was given to him by Dimebag Darrell. In 2016, the &quot;Dimebolt&quot; guitar was returned to Flynn. Machine Head debuted at number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with &quot;Unto the Locust&quot; the band&#x27;s highest performance. They also debuted at number 5 on the German music chart. The album has sold over 100,000 copies in the United States.

==Personal life==
Flynn is married and has two sons. He is an atheist.

==Equipment==
Flynn used two Ibanez strat styled guitars in the early days of Machine Head, a white one used in 1992 until 1993, and a black one covered with stickers which he used to record &quot;Burn My Eyes&quot;, which was stolen from his home in 2010 along with a Washburn Dimebolt which Dimebag Darrell had once given to him. For the Burn My Eyes tour he used a Gibson Explorer and a Jackson Soloist. He used these guitars for &quot;The More Things Change...&quot;, after which he switched to a Gibson SG. His Dimebolt and all the guitars that were stolen were returned to him by a woman who bought a storage unit, which either belonged to the person that stole them or she received them from the person that stole them.

For &quot;The Burning Red&quot;, he began using a Gibson Flying V, which became synonymous with him after this period. In 2002, just before the recording of &quot;Through the Ashes of Empires&quot; he began using his ESP SP210 baritone guitar. For &quot;The Blackening&quot; tour he used a custom ESP flying V which was identical to, and often mistaken for a Gibson V. By &quot;Unto the Locust&quot; he was using a more modified version of his earlier ESP/Gibson V, with this one having mirror inlays of the Machine Head logo on the fretboard and headstock.

Flynn had signed a deal with Epiphone in which he could get signature models based closely on his designs with ESP. His new guitar for this period was the Epiphone Love Death Baritone Flying V, along with a custom Explorer, which he occasionally used on the Locust tour. For the &quot;Bloodstone &amp; Diamonds&quot; era, Flynn has so far been using several Epiphone Flying V&#x27;s, including an alternate version of the Love Death V, with this one having a tremolo bar. Currently he uses both his Love Death models, a satin black V, and a glossy black V with white binding and a white pickguard.
In January 2015, Flynn posted a picture on his Instagram page, showing his red BC Rich Warlock along with his Gibson SG from 1997, announcing that he was bringing them out of retirement and bringing them on the US leg of the Bloodstone &amp; Diamonds tour.

Other gear includes a modified Peavey 5150 and an Electro Harmonix Deluxe Electric Mistress flanger pedal.

<text>The Battle of Chippawa, also known as the Battle of Chippewa, was a victory for the United States Army in the War of 1812, during its invasion on July 5, 1814, of the British Empire&#x27;s colony of Upper Canada along the Niagara River. This battle and the subsequent Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane demonstrated that trained American troops could hold their own against British regulars. The battlefield is preserved as a National Historic Site of Canada.

==Background==
Early in 1814, it was clear that Napoleon was defeated in Europe, and seasoned British veteran soldiers from the Peninsular War would be redeployed to Canada. The United States Secretary of War, John Armstrong Jr., was eager to win a victory in Canada before British reinforcements arrived there.

Major General Jacob Brown was ordered to form the Left Division of the Army of the North. Armstrong intended him to mount an attack on Kingston, the main British base on Lake Ontario, with a diversion by militia across the Niagara River to distract the British. He had drawn up alternative orders for a major attack across the Niagara, possibly as a contingency plan, but probably to mislead the British through deliberate leaks. Brown thought that he was being presented with two possible plans, and was free to choose between them. Although Brigadier General Edmund P. Gaines tried to persuade Brown to make the attack on Kingston, Brown was unable to gain cooperation from Commodore Isaac Chauncey (commanding the American naval squadron based at Sackets Harbor, New York), which he considered essential for such an attack across Lake Ontario. Chauncey was waiting for new warships to be completed in the shipyard at Sackets Harbor and refused to make any move before the middle of July. Brown made the attack across the Niagara the main focus of his forces.

===Scott&#x27;s Camp of Instruction===
Armstrong had also directed that two &quot;Camps of Instruction&quot; be set up, to improve the standards of the regular units of the United States Army. One was at Plattsburgh, New York, under Brigadier General George Izard. The other was at Buffalo, New York, near the head of the Niagara River, under Brigadier General Winfield Scott.

At Buffalo, Scott instituted a major training program. He drilled his troops for ten hours every day, using the 1791 Manual of the French Revolutionary Army. (Prior to this, various American regiments had been using a variety of different manuals, making it difficult to manoeuvre any large American force). Scott also purged his units of any remaining inefficient officers who had gained their appointments through political influence rather than experience or merit, and he insisted on proper camp discipline including sanitary arrangements. This reduced the wastage from dysentery and other enteric diseases which had been heavy in previous campaigns.

There was only one major deficiency; Scott had been unable to obtain enough regulation blue uniforms for his men. Although they had been manufactured and sent to the northern theater, they had been diverted to Plattsburgh and Sackets Harbor. The United States Army&#x27;s commissary general, Callender Irvine, hastily ordered 2,000 uniforms to be made and despatched to Buffalo for Scott&#x27;s other units, but because there was insufficient blue cloth, short jackets (roundabouts) of gray cloth were used instead. When Scott received the gray roundabouts, he gathered up the blue coatees belonging to his brigade and gave them to the 21st US Infantry (one of the units in Brigadier General Eleazer Wheelock Ripley&#x27;s brigade), because &quot;the black coatees of the 21st are a disgrace to the uniform and soldier of the army of the United States&quot; (G.O. 16, Winfield Scott, May 24, 1814).

===Niagara campaign===
By early July, Brown&#x27;s division was massed at the Niagara, in accordance with Armstrong&#x27;s alternate orders. Without cooperation from Chauncey, a direct attack on Fort George at the mouth of the Niagara was impossible. Nor was it possible to land large numbers of troops on the southern side of the Niagara Peninsula and advance on Burlington to cut off the British on the Niagara River, because the American squadron on Lake Erie (and the regular troops at Detroit) had been diverted to attempt the recapture of Fort Mackinac on Lake Huron. Armstrong suggested that Brown should therefore capture and hold Fort Erie, opposite Buffalo, while waiting for Chauncey to ready his squadron. Brown assented, but was prepared to push much further than the immediate vicinity of Fort Erie.

On July 3, Brown&#x27;s army, consisting of the regular brigades commanded by Scott (with 1,377 men) and Ripley (with 1,082 men), and four companies of artillery numbering 327 men under Major Jacob Hindman, easily surrounded and captured Fort Erie which was defended only by two weak companies under Major Thomas Buck. After a brigade of 750 volunteers from the militia under Brigadier General Peter B. Porter and 600 Iroquois arrived on July 4, Scott began advancing north along the portage road alongside the Niagara River. A British covering force under Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Pearson was easily driven back before they could destroy any of the bridges or block the road with fallen trees.

Late in the day, Scott encountered British defences on the far bank of Chippawa Creek, near the town of Chippawa. After a brief exchange of artillery fire, Scott withdrew a few miles to Street&#x27;s Creek. Here he planned to give his troops a belated Fourth of July parade the next day, while Brown manoeuvred other units to cross the Chippawa upstream.

Opposed to Scott was the Right Division of the British Army in Upper Canada, under Major General Phineas Riall. Riall believed that Fort Erie was still holding out, and the Americans would therefore have detached large numbers of troops to mask it, leaving only 2,000 men to face his division. He may also have believed that his opponents were militia but was comparatively new to command in Canada and relied on information from Lieutenant Colonel John Harvey, the deputy adjutant general for the forces in Upper Canada, that even the United States regulars were of poor quality. Riall determined to cross the Chippawa River and mount an attack to drive the Americans back across the Niagara and relieve Fort Erie.

==Battle==
Early on July 5, British light infantry, militia and Indians crossed the Chippawa ahead of Riall&#x27;s main body and began sniping at Scott&#x27;s outposts from the woods to their west. (Some of them nearly captured Scott, who was having breakfast in a farmhouse.) Brown ordered Porter&#x27;s brigade and Indians to clear the woods. They did so, but they met Riall&#x27;s advancing regulars and hastily retreated.

Scott was already advancing from Street&#x27;s Creek. His artillery (Captain Nathaniel Towson&#x27;s company, with three 12-pounder guns) deployed on the portage road and opened fire. Riall&#x27;s own guns (two light 24-pounder guns and a 5.5-inch howitzer) attempted to reply, but Towson&#x27;s guns destroyed an ammunition wagon and put most of the British guns out of action.

Meanwhile, Scott&#x27;s troops deployed into line with the 25th U.S. Infantry on the left near the woods, the 11th U.S. Infantry and 9th U.S. Infantry in the centre and the 22nd U.S. Infantry on the right with Towson&#x27;s guns. At first, Riall was under the impression that the American line was composed of grey-clad militia troops, whom the professional British soldiers held in much contempt. He expected the poorly trained soldiers to fall back in disarray after the first few volleys. But the American line held steady under British artillery fire.

The British infantry, with the 1st (Royal Scots) Foot and the 100th Foot leading and the 8th (King&#x27;s) Foot in reserve, advanced in line, becoming disordered over the grassy, uneven ground. This slowed them and put them under fire from the American artillery for longer. Riall sacrificed the advantage of greater firepower (versus advancing in column) by ordering his infantry to fire only one volley before closing with the bayonet. As the 1st and 100th Regiments moved forward, their own artillery had to stop firing to avoid hitting them. Meanwhile, the American gunners switched from firing roundshot to firing canister. Once the opposing lines had closed to less than 100 yards, Scott advanced his wings, forming his brigade into a &quot;U&quot; shape which allowed his flanking units to catch Riall&#x27;s advancing troops in a heavy crossfire.

Both lines stood and fired repeated volleys; after 25 minutes of this pounding Riall, his own coat pierced by a bullet, ordered a withdrawal. The 1/8th, which had been moving to the right of the other two regiments, formed line to cover their retreat. As they in turn fell back, three British 6-pounder guns came into action to cover their withdrawal, with two more 6-pounders firing from the entrenchments north of the Chippawa. Scott halted his brigade, although some of Porter&#x27;s Iroquois pursued the British almost to the Chippawa.
===Casualties===
The American official casualty return stated the loss as 60 killed, 249 wounded and 19 missing.

British losses had been heavy; the 100th Regiment, which held the centre, was reduced to &quot;...one Captain &amp; 3 subalterns doing duty, with 250 effective men&quot;. The official casualty return gave 148 killed, 321 wounded and 46 missing. However, 20th century research by Canadian archivist Douglas Hendry has demonstrated that the British casualty return for Chippawa marked down many men as killed who had in fact been captured, and that of 136 British regulars who were supposed to have been killed, only 74 actually died. The official return gave 12 Canadian militiamen killed but Donald Graves has determined that 18 actually died. A U.S. Army document signed by Assistant Inspector-General Azariah Horne states the Americans had captured 3 officers and 72 &quot;rank and file&quot; of the British regulars who were wounded and 9 British regulars, 1 &quot;captain of the Indians&quot;, 1 Indian chief and 4 Indian warriors who were not wounded. Two British officers, Captains Bird and Wilson, appear in the official casualty list in the &quot;wounded&quot; category with additional information that they have also been taken prisoner. The actual British loss at Chippawa therefore appears to have been 74 regulars, 18 Canadian militiamen and 16 Indian warriors killed; 303 British regulars (not including Captains Bird and Wilson, who come under the &#x27;wounded prisoners&#x27; category), 16 Canadian militiamen and an unknown number of Indian warriors wounded; 75 British regulars (including Captains Bird and Wilson) wounded and captured by the Americans; 9 British regulars, one officer of the British Indian Department and 5 Indian warriors taken prisoner unwounded. A further 9 British soldiers and 9 Canadian militiamen appear to have deserted. This gives a grand total of 108 killed, 319 wounded, 75 wounded prisoners, 15 unwounded prisoners and 18 missing.

==Aftermath==
Two days after the battle, Brown completed his original intended maneuver and crossed the Chippawa upstream of Riall&#x27;s defenses, forcing the British to fall back to Fort George. It was not possible to attack this fortified British position because Commodore Chauncey was still failing to support the American army on the Niagara peninsula. No reinforcements or siege artillery could be brought to Brown&#x27;s army. At the same time, the British were able to rush reinforcements to the Niagara front and soon became too strong for Brown to risk a direct attack. Eventually, a series of feints and maneuvers led to the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane a few weeks later.

==Legacy==

The Battle of Chippawa proved the worthiness of American regulars when pitted against their British counterparts, and the fearsome effectiveness of American marksmanship:The best test of British and American military qualities, both for men and weapons, was Scott&#x27;s battle of Chippawa. Nothing intervened to throw a doubt over the fairness of the trial. Two parallel lines of regular soldiers, practically equal in numbers, armed with similar weapons, moved in close order toward each other, across a wide open plain, without cover or advantage of position, stopping at intervals to load and fire, until one line broke and retired. **** Marksmanship decided the result, and the returns proved that the American fire was superior to that of the British in the proportion of more than fifty per cent if estimated by the entire loss, and of two hundred and forty-two to one hundred if estimated by the deaths alone.It is generally considered that Riall, although misled as to the strength of the American forces and their quality advanced overconfidently, and his mistaken tactics led to the heavy British casualties.

The 25th Infantry was later combined with the 27th, 29th and 37th Infantry Regiments to form the 6th Infantry Regiment. The 6th Infantry&#x27;s motto is &quot;Regulars, by God&quot; from this battle.

Ten active regular infantry battalions of the United States Army (1–2 Inf, 2-2 Inf, 1–3 Inf, 2–3 Inf, 4-3 Inf, 1–5 Inf, 2–5 Inf, 1–6 Inf, 2–6 Inf and 4–6 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of American infantry regiments (the old 9th, 11th, 19th, 21st, 22nd and 23rd Infantry Regiments) that were at the Battle of Chippawa.

The Corps of Cadets of the United States Military Academy at West Point wear gray parade uniforms, but the assertion that they were adopted in commemoration of Scott&#x27;s troops at Chippawa appears to be a legend, possibly started by General Scott himself. The reasons given in 1815 for its selection were simply that it wore well and was considerably cheaper than the blue one.

The site is preserved in the Chippawa Battlefield Park, a unit of the Niagara Parks Commission, with a battle monument and interpretive plaques south of Niagara Falls in the town of Chippawa, Ontario. The site of the battle was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1921.

Chippewa Square in Savannah, Georgia, is named for the battle.

<doc id="1325921" wikidata="Q295325" url="?curid=1325921" title="AMS Euler">
<text>AMS Euler is an upright cursive typeface, commissioned by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) and designed and created by Hermann Zapf with the assistance of Donald Knuth and his Stanford graduate students. It tries to emulate a mathematician&#x27;s style of handwriting mathematical entities on a blackboard, which is upright rather than italic. It blends very well with other typefaces made by Hermann Zapf, such as Palatino, Aldus and Melior, but very badly with the default TeX font Computer Modern. All the alphabets were implemented with the computer-assisted design system Metafont developed by Knuth. Zapf designed and drew the Euler alphabets in 1980–81 and provided critique and advice of digital proofs in 1983 and later. The typeface family is copyright by American Mathematical Society, 1983. Euler Metafont development was done by Stanford computer science and/or digital typography students; first Scott Kim, then Carol Twombly and Daniel Mills, and finally David Siegel, all assisted by John Hobby. Siegel finished the Metafont Euler digitization project as his M.S. thesis in 1985.

The AMS Euler typeface is named after Leonhard Euler.

First implemented in METAFONT, AMS Euler was first used in the book &quot;Concrete Mathematics&quot;, which was co-authored by Knuth and dedicated to Euler. This volume also saw the debut of Knuth&#x27;s Concrete Roman font, designed to complement AMS Euler. The Euler Metafont format fonts were converted to PostScript Type 1 font format by the efforts of several people, including Berthold Horn at Y&amp;Y, Barry Smith at Bluesky Research, and Henry Pinkham and Ian Morrison at Projective Solutions. It is now also available in TrueType format.

==Reshaping Euler==
In 2009, AMS released version 3.0 of AMS fonts, in which Hermann Zapf reshaped many of the Euler glyphs, with implementation and assistance from Hans Hagen, Taco Hoekwater, and Volker RW Schaa.

The updated version 3.0 was presented to Donald Knuth on his birthday, January 10, 2008.

These updates were designed to work with the metrics for version 2.2, so no changes to the .tfm files were needed. Since the updates were made directly to the Type 1 files, the (incompatible) Metafont sources have been removed from the distribution.

The reshaped version has been released under the OFL.

Neo Euler is largely based on the above, but with OpenType math features added.

<doc id="1325923" wikidata="Q2916558" url="?curid=1325923" title="Orbit (gum)">
<text>Orbit, referred to as Extra in the UK and Freedent in Europe, is a brand of sugarless chewing gum from the Wrigley Company. In the United States, where it was re-launched in 2001, it is sold in cardboard boxes with 14 individually wrapped pieces per package. In the UK, where it was launched in 1899 it was originally sold as a traditional long-stick gum, later replaced by the same format as the US.

Orbit White, packaged in blister packs of 20 pieces, was released to compete with Cadbury Adams&#x27; Trident White gum in 2001.

== History ==
Orbit was originally released in 1899. It was launched in 1944 in the United States as a replacement brand by Wrigley due to rationing of gum-making ingredients in World War II. The brand was discontinued after the war ended, when Wrigley&#x27;s three established gum brands, Juicy Fruit, Wrigley&#x27;s Spearmint and Doublemint, returned to the US market.

The gum was reintroduced 30 years later in 1976, when it was introduced in Germany, Switzerland and The Netherlands. This marked the first time that a sugar-free gum was marketed under the Wrigley name. The brand was later introduced in other countries, including Canada, Australia, the UK, Norway, Poland, Israel and Serbia.

The gum returned to American shelves in the late 1970s, but was removed from the shelves in the 1980s due to a suspicion that the sweetener might cause cancer. The gum was relaunched in the US in 2001.

Orbit gum is now sold in the UK as Wrigleys Extra, alongside the &#x27;real&#x27;, hard shell Extra gum.

== Advertising ==
The US advertising campaign for Orbit centered on the Orbit Girl, a British accented character who always showed up to &quot;dirty&quot; and awkward situations wearing all white, a scarf, and a smile. Vanessa Branch played the Orbit Girl from 2001 to 2010, when she was replaced by Farris Patton, who played the Orbit Girl from 2010 through 2014.

In 2014, Orbit moved to a more global approach to marketing, replacing the Orbit Girl, and with a new commercial with Sarah Silverman to kick off its new campaign: &quot;Eat. Drink. Chew Orbit.&quot; to emphasize the benefits of chewing gum after eating and drinking.

In the UK and Ireland the Orbit name was replaced by Extra in 2015, with the same 14-piece package. In 2019 the replacement was applied in Germany as well.

<text>Steven Lee Nelson (born April 26, 1951) is an American former professional football player and high school coach. He played as a linebacker for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL) from 1974 to 1987. He served as the head coach at Curry College in Milton, Massachusetts from 1998 to 2005, compiling a record of 64–22.

Nelson was a three-sport athlete at Anoka High School, in Anoka, Minnesota, earning letters in football, basketball and baseball. As a senior, Nelson was selected as captain, team MVP and to the all-state team in football. Nelson went on to college at North Dakota State University and graduated in 1974 after being named a two-time All-American, team captain and MVP in football.

He was selected by the Patriots in the second round of the 1974 NFL draft. He was selected to the Pro Bowl three times in 1980, 1984, and 1985 and his #57 jersey was retired by the Patriots. He is credited with helping the Patriots reach Super Bowl XX versus the Chicago Bears.

Nelson played linebacker for the Patriots from 1974 to 1987 and became the nucleus of the Patriots defense. Nelson was voted to three Pro Bowls and recorded more than 100 tackles nine times during his career. He led the Patriots in tackles in eight of his 14 seasons, including an unofficial team record of 207 in 1984. He finished his career with 1,776 total tackles. After retirement, he coached for the Patriots and later built Curry College into a perennial power. In 1993, Nelson was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame.

More recently, Nelson has become a familiar football analyst on local television and radio. He currently works as a business development executive for Lighthouse Computer Services, Inc., a Lincoln, RI-based technology company. In September 2011, Nelson was named to the inaugural class of the Anoka High School Hall of Fame. He currently resides in Middleboro, MA with his wife Angela and his five daughters, Cameron, Caitlin, Casey, Kelli, and Grace.

<doc id="1325927" wikidata="Q6759837" url="?curid=1325927" title="Margaret Ridley Charlton">
<text>Margaret Charlton (10 December 1858 – 1 May 1931) was a pioneering Canadian medical librarian who was instrumental in founding the Association of Medical Librarians, which became the Medical Library Association in 1907. She was the association&#x27;s first secretary.

== Early life ==
She was born on December 10, 1858, in La Prairie, Quebec, a small town on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River near Montreal. She was christened Margaret Anne but later changed her second name to Ridley, to honour her descent from the family of the martyred Bishop Nicholas Ridley, who was burnt at the stake in Oxford in 1555.

In addition to being a librarian, she was also a literary journalist and wrote several historical sketches, book reviews and wrote two books with her friend Caroline Augusta Fraser.

==Career==
The McGill University Medical Library was founded on August 27, 1823. It was part of the university&#x27;s Faculty of Medicine and, as was common practice in the 19th and early 20th centuries, a faculty member held the title of &quot;Librarian&quot;. Charlton, who had recently completed a summer course at Amherst College in the newly developed field of librarianship, and is thought to have studied under Melvil Dewey, came to this library in 1895. She was appointed to be the library&#x27;s first Assistant Librarian in 1896. She remained at the McGill Medical Library in this position until 1914, when she resigned under less than happy circumstances, and moved to Toronto as Librarian of the Academy of Medicine.

Charlton was probably the first person with any formal library training to work at McGill University. Her interest in wider library issues was demonstrated shortly after she arrived, as she was reimbursed $55 for the expense of attending a meeting of the American Library Association in Chicago in 1896. The following year, the British and Canadian medical associations held a joint meeting in Montreal, and it was probably here that Charlton first met prominent Canadian physician William Osler. Osler had graduated from McGill in 1872, and after postgraduate studies in Europe he had returned as a faculty member. He left McGill in 1884 to go to the University of Pennsylvania and by 1897 was at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Osler was always interested in, and supportive of, libraries and had served on the Faculty&#x27;s Library Committee while at McGill. He was almost certainly eager to meet the newly appointed assistant librarian of his alma mater.

It was most likely due to this 1897 meeting that William Osler and Margaret Charlton became involved in the formation of the Association of Medical Librarians, founded on May 2, 1898, by four librarians and four physicians who met in the office of the Philadelphia Medical Journal, at the invitation of its editor, George M. Gould, M.D. The object of the Association was the fostering of medical libraries and the maintenance of an exchange of medical literature among its members. Membership was limited to librarians representing medical libraries of at least 500 volumes, with regular library hours and attendance. Miss Charlton served as the Association&#x27;s first Secretary from 1898 to 1903 and again from 1909 to 1911, after it had become (in 1907) the Medical Library Association. One of the other founding members, Marcia Crocker Noyes (who was to become the first woman and first non-physician President of the Association in 1933), writes of Margaret Charlton as follows:

:&quot;Miss Charlton was the one person who indirectly brought the Association into being from speaking with Dr. Osler. She had belonged to the American Library Association. Their problems were not our problems, and she felt lost and that time was wasted, yet she had striven for contact with those doing just the sort of work she was doing. And so she suggested to Dr. Osler that it would be a fine thing if the Medical Libraries could do the same thing the American Library Association was doing.&quot; (Bulletin of the Medical Library Association, 23 (1934): page 33.)

==Later life==
In 1922 she left the Academy of Medicine, also under less than happy circumstances, and returned to Montreal to live with her sisters. She died there on May 1, 1931, and is buried, with her mother and two of her three sisters, in Mount Royal Cemetery. (Grave H31 in section H.)

==Awards in Her Honor==
Margaret Ridley Charlton Award for Outstanding Achievement

At the winter 2004 meeting of the Canadian Health Libraries Association /Association des bibliothèques de la santé du Canada Board of Directors, it was decided to rename the Award for Outstanding Achievement in honour of Margaret Ridley Charlton.

==Legacy==
In November 2000, Charlton was proposed to the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada as a &quot;person of national historic significance&quot;. This board, created in 1919, is responsible for making such recommendations to the Canadian government, and in late 2002 it supported the proposal. In September 2003 the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Sheila Copps, approved the Board&#x27;s recommendation, and Charlton has been added to the list of approximately 600 other &quot;persons of national historic significance&quot;. In 2006 a Government of Canada plaque honouring her accomplishments was unveiled at the McGill University Life Sciences (formerly Medical) Library and this was erected outside the McIntyre Medical Sciences Building in November 2012 where it is in close proximity to similar plaques to her contemporaries William Osler and Maude Abbott.

<text>Bob Nolan (born Clarence Robert Nobles; April 13, 1908 – June 16, 1980, name changed to Robert Clarence Nobles in 1929) was a Canadian-born American singer, songwriter, and actor. He was a founding member of the Sons of the Pioneers, and composer of numerous Country music and Western music songs, including the standards &quot;Cool Water&quot; and &quot;Tumbling Tumbleweeds.&quot; He is generally regarded as one of the finest Western songwriters of all time. As an actor and singer he appeared in scores of Western films.

==Early years==
Nolan was born April 13, 1908, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada to Harry Nobles and Flora Elizabeth Hussey Nobles. The couple separated in 1915, and Flora raised her two little boys in Winnipeg.

In the summer of 1916, Flora temporarily moved her children to her husband&#x27;s parents&#x27; home in Hatfield Point, New Brunswick, but due to the machinations of his father, Nolan never saw his mother again.

In the summer of 1919, Nolan went to live with his aunt in Boston, Massachusetts. There he attended The Belmont School until 1921, when, at the age of thirteen, he moved to Tucson, Arizona, to live with his father Harry, a United States Army officer. He attended Safford Junior High School until 1922, then transferred to Roskruge Junior High. In high school he was an average student, was a member of the Arion Club choral group, and excelled in athletics. He graduated from Tucson High School in May 1928.

On July 7, 1928, less than two months after he graduated high school, Nolan married his high school sweetheart, 16-year-old Tennie Pearl Fields. Thirteen months later, daughter Roberta Irene was born to them, but the marriage foundered almost from the beginning.

After he left school, Nolan drifted around the country, finding work where he could and always writing songs. He took a lifeguard job in Los Angeles in 1929. His father had changed his name to Nolan and it was as Bob Nolan that he began a career as a singer on the Chautauqua tent-show circuit and as a lifeguard in Santa Monica.

==Sons of the Pioneers==

In September 1931, Nolan answered a classified ad in &quot;The Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot; that read &quot;Yodeler for old-time act, to travel. Tenor preferred.&quot; The band was The Rocky Mountaineers, led by a young singer named Leonard Slye, who would later change his name to Roy Rogers. After listening to the tall, slender, tanned Nolan sing and yodel, Slye hired Nolan on the spot. Although he stayed with the group only a short time, he stayed in touch with Slye.

In 1934, Nolan co-founded the Sons of the Pioneers with Leonard Slye and Tim Spencer. The singing group became very popular and produced numerous recordings for Columbia, Decca, and RCA Victor.

The Sons of the Pioneers began performing Nolan&#x27;s original songs on a nationally syndicated radio show. &quot;Tumbling Tumbleweeds&quot; became their signature tune and a Western standard, and was one of the first songs the group recorded when it signed with Decca in 1934. In the coming years, The Sons of the Pioneers recorded many other Nolan songs, including &quot;Way Out There&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s a Roundup in the Sky&quot;, &quot;One More Ride&quot;, and &quot;Cool Water&quot;, which became one of the group&#x27;s most famous recordings.

In 1937, Leonard Slye took the name Roy Rogers and was forced by his new employers, Republic Pictures, to leave the group. The Pioneers continued to function as a cooperative partnership, with no formal leader, until they rejoined Rogers at Republic in 1941. Nolan reluctantly became the group&#x27;s front man because his face and voice were the most recognizable in the group.

==Film career==

In 1934, Nolan began his career in film as the singing voice for Ken Maynard in the 1934 film &quot;In Old Santa Fe&quot;. In 1935, the Sons of the Pioneers appeared in their first full-length Western movie &quot;The Old Homestead&quot;. That same year they signed with Columbia Pictures to provide the music for the western films of Charles Starrett. The deal was far from lucrative (they were paid $33 apiece to appear in each film, and Nolan and Spencer each received $10 for every original song), but the worldwide exposure was beneficial to the group.

Nolan appeared in at least 88 Western films, first for Columbia Pictures and later with cowboy stars Gene Autry and Roy Rogers. With the Sons of the Pioneers, he made guest appearances in high-budget films like &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot; and &quot;Rhythm on the Range&quot; with Bing Crosby. He also appeared in the Walt Disney short, &quot;Melody Time&quot;.

Nolan had strong featured roles in the Charles Starrett westerns, often playing the second lead. Columbia&#x27;s president Harry Cohn took an interest in Nolan, and issued three edicts: he ordered Nolan to have his nose fixed; he decided that Nolan&#x27;s singing voice in the early Starrett pictures was not a polished baritone and should be dubbed by other singers; and he wanted to groom Nolan to star in his own movies. Nolan grudgingly went along with Cohn&#x27;s first two directives but turned down the chance to be a movie star. Movie fans (who knew Nolan&#x27;s singing voice from records and radio) urged Columbia to use Nolan&#x27;s own voice, which was finally heard on screen in 1940.

In 1941, Columbia disbanded the close-knit Starrett unit temporarily, freeing the Sons of the Pioneers to join Roy Rogers at Republic Pictures. Nolan and the group appeared as his musical sidekicks in numerous films through 1948. Their last film together was &quot;Night Time in Nevada&quot;. In many of these films, Nolan was featured in prominent supporting roles with significant dialogue. Republic once offered Nolan his own cowboy film series, which he declined.

On June 11, 1942, Nolan married Clara Brown, whose slight stature led to her being nicknamed P-Nuts. They met at the Columbia Drugstore on Sunset and Gower near the Columbia Studio lot. P-Nuts had come to Hollywood in search of stardom, but found work instead at the drugstore, where Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers frequently had lunch and where Nolan would work on his song lyrics.

==Later years==

In 1949, Nolan retired from show business and began a semi-secluded life as a songwriter. He returned to record with the Sons of the Pioneers in 1956, at the insistence of RCA Victor executives who wanted to capitalize on Nolan&#x27;s TV exposure in the old Rogers westerns.

In 1971, Nolan was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 1980, at the age of 72, Nolan recorded his last LP album &quot;Bob Nolan: The Sound of a Pioneer&quot;.

Nolan died on June 16, 1980, in Newport Beach, California, of a heart attack. At his request, his ashes were scattered in Red Rock Canyon in the Nevada desert.

On July 27, 1980, many of his friends and former colleagues gathered at Rex Allen&#x27;s Diamond X ranch in Calabasas, California, to honor him musically. Among those who attended the memorial were Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, the current Sons of the Pioneers, and the Reinsmen.

<doc id="1325932" wikidata="Q7106994" url="?curid=1325932" title="Osler Library of the History of Medicine">
<text>The Osler Library, a branch of the McGill University Library and part of ROAAr since 2016, is Canada&#x27;s foremost scholarly resource for the history of medicine, and one of the most important libraries of its type in North America. It is located in the McIntyre Medical Sciences Building in Montreal.

==Collection==
The nucleus of the Library is the collection of 8,000 rare and historic works on the history of medicine and allied subjects presented to the Faculty of Medicine of McGill University by Sir William Osler (1849–1919). Sir William&#x27;s original collection is described in the printed catalogue, &quot;Bibliotheca Osleriana&quot;, and information on the whole of the printed collection and much of the manuscript collections is listed in the McGill University online catalogue. Since the opening of the Library in 1929, the collection has continued to grow by purchase, gift, and transfer (particularly, in the latter case, of older health-related books from McGill&#x27;s former Medical Library and Life Sciences Library.)

In addition to the Osler Library&#x27;s holdings of rare and old books, there is a strong circulating collection of current secondary works and modern editions of historic texts, as well as a reference collection, archives and manuscripts, portraits and artifacts. In particular, the Osler Library has a large collection of incunabula (over 150 volumes), an outstanding collection of editions of the works of Sir Thomas Browne (author of &quot;Religio Medici&quot;, the 17th-century classic), and a collection of some 30,000 19th-century French medical theses, primarily from Paris.

The total number of works currently housed in the library is approximately 100,000, and includes books old and new, as well as &quot;periodicals about the history of the health sciences and related areas&quot;. The library also includes an important archival collection, both in scope (more than 200 archival fonds) and in content, documenting the history and the development of medicine and its teaching from the 19th century.

==History==
Percy Erskine Nobbs designed the Osler library for the Strathcona Medical Building (now the Strathcona Anatomy and Dentistry Building), and the library officially opened there in May 1929. In 1965, both the contents of the library and the interior oak paneling and shelving were moved to their present location within the newly built McIntyre Medical Sciences Building. At that time the &quot;Wellcome Camera&quot; was added to the library with the financial assistance of the Wellcome Trust. Initially most of the windows on the first floor of the Camera were provided with stained-glass coats-of-arms; one for each of the twelve Canadian universities which then had medical faculties. In 1985 four additional coats-of-arms were added; only the coat-of-arms of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine is currently missing. The Osler Library was further expanded and renovated in 2001-02 and in 2014. In summer 2018 the roof terrace above the library caught fire. Though the library and archives were not harmed by fire, the area suffered water damage and the collection was moved to McGill&#x27;s McLennan-Redpath Library complex while the building underwent repairs. There was some discussion about the library remaining in the McLennan-Redpath building but, in late 2021, McGill&#x27;s Principal announced that the Library would return to the McIntyre Medical Sciences Building - the collections were moved back there in summer 2022 and it re-opened to users in September 2022.

In the design of the Osler Library everything has been subordinated to the books themselves; those in the Osler Room are arranged in full view behind glass cabinetry. The fittings and furnishings of the Osler Library were designed by architects Percy Nobbs &amp; George Taylor Hyde. The stained glass window in the Osler Room depicts the staff and serpent, symbols of healing associated with the Greek god Asclepius, and a held-out book representing the university.

After their deaths, the ashes of both Sir William and Lady Osler were placed in a niche within the library so that they continue to be surrounded by Sir William&#x27;s favourite books.

==Partnerships and collaboration==

The McGill University Library is a member of the Association of Research Libraries, Canadian Association of Research Libraries, and is a contributor to the Open Content Alliance. In January 2016, Osler Library of the History of Medicine started contributing material to the Medical Heritage Library.

<text>The Near South Side is a community area of Chicago, Illinois, United States, just south of the downtown central business district, the Loop. The Near South Side&#x27;s boundaries are as follows: North—Roosevelt Road (1200 S); South—26th Street; West—Chicago River between Roosevelt and 18th Street, Clark Street between 18th Street and Cermak Road, Federal between Cermak Road and the Stevenson Expressway just south of 25th Street, and Clark Street again between the Stevenson and 26th Street; and East—Lake Michigan.

Along Lake Shore Drive, the Near South Side includes some of Chicago&#x27;s best-known structures: Soldier Field, home of the NFL&#x27;s Chicago Bears; McCormick Place, Chicago&#x27;s primary convention center; the Museum Campus, which contains the Field Museum, the Shedd Aquarium, and the Adler Planetarium; and Northerly Island. The area is currently undergoing a major residential and mixed-use redevelopment.

==History==

The Near South Side is one of the most dynamic of Chicago&#x27;s communities. It has undergone a metamorphosis from a Native American homeland to a blue collar settlement, to an elite socialite residential district, to a center for vice, to a slum, to a public housing and warehouse district, and finally to the home of a newly gentrified residential district.

===Beginnings and continuous change===
The Near South Side was initially noted for wagon trails winding through a lightly populated bend of Lake Michigan. It was on one of these trails that the Fort Dearborn Massacre occurred in 1812. This area was first populated by settlers working for the Illinois &amp; Michigan Canal, who subsequently worked in the lumber district. Proximity to the railroads attracted light manufacturing and shops. In 1853, the community was absorbed by the extension of the city limits to 31st Street; in the same period, the Illinois Central Railroad was built into Chicago. In 1859, a South State Street horse-drawn streetcar line, linking the area to downtown, attracted wealthy families to the area. By the time of the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, it was home to some of the city&#x27;s finest mansions and most elite social families, and in the 1890s the railroad&#x27;s Central Station opened at 12th Street. However, by the start of the 20th century, rapid transit evolved and many families moved slightly farther from the Loop business district. The railroads brought warehouses and light manufacturing. Michigan Avenue between 14th Street and 22nd Street became an auto row. The &quot;Levee&quot; vice district of brothels and gambling dens around Cermak Street and State Street prospered until 1912. Burnham Park and several accompanying institutions were built in the 1910s and 1920s. World War I and post World War I Great Migration settlers moved in and created the low-rent &quot;Black Belt&quot;. Urban renewal and public housing projects later replaced some of the slums. In the 1940s, some of the city&#x27;s slums were on the Near South Side.

===Century of Progress===
The Century of Progress International Exposition was the name of the World&#x27;s Fair held on the Near South Side lakefront from 1933 to 1934 to celebrate the city&#x27;s centennial. The theme of the fair was technological innovation over the century since Chicago&#x27;s founding. More than 40 million people visited the fair, which symbolized for many hope for Chicago and the nation, then in the midst of the Great Depression.

===Modern day===

West of Lake Shore Drive, much of the Near South Side, in the middle of the twentieth century, consisted largely of railroad tracks and interchanges until the 1960s, when middle-class housing developments were built in the community area. In 1977, George Halas surrendered of railyards for redevelopment as Dearborn Park apartments, townhouses and accompanying tree-lined walkways. In 1988, the second phase of Dearborn Park construction began between State St. and Clark St., south of Roosevelt Rd. A housing boom emerged in the 1990s and continues to the present day with the construction of many new condominium and apartment towers.

Construction of the Central Station development commenced in 1990. This was a mixed-use development on of former rail yards and air rights east of Indiana Avenue between Roosevelt Road and 18th Street. Simultaneously, loft conversion spread to the warehouses and light manufacturing structures along the major north-south Avenues of Michigan, Indiana, and Wabash, which returned them to residential properties 100 years after the flight of the elite Chicago socialites. Among the prominent buildings are One Museum Park and One Museum Park West along a redeveloped Prairie Avenue.

==Parks and museums==

Landfill use created Burnham Park and Northerly Island in the 1920s and 1930s along Lake Michigan. The Field Museum of Natural History, Soldier Field, Adler Planetarium and the John G. Shedd Aquarium were constructed on this newly reclaimed land at this time. Later, Merrill C. Meigs Field Airport was built. Northerly Island connects to the rest of the Museum Campus through a narrow isthmus along Solidarity Drive dominated by Neoclassical sculptures of Kościuszko, Havliček and Nicolaus Copernicus.

The newly developed Central Station area includes three park areas. Mark Twain Park lies between South Indiana Avenue and Lake Shore Drive at 15th Place. Daniel Webster Park is bounded by 14th Street, South Indiana Avenue and townhouse developments. The Grant Park Extension lies east of One Museum Park and South of Roosevelt. The developers donated for one park to the city and developed the other two as part of its approval process. The donated tract protects the northward view of Grant Park.

=== McCormick Place ===
Fairs and exhibitions held on the lakefront sites created demand for an exhibition hall. In 1960, construction was begun on McCormick Place, a huge exposition and convention complex at 23rd Street and Lake Shore Drive named for newspaper magnate Robert R. McCormick. The original building burned in 1967, and was rebuilt and reopened in 1971 at the behest of mayor Richard J. Daley. Large expansions were added in 1986, 1997 and 2007. The current redevelopment includes greatly expanded hotel accommodation. McCormick Place also houses the Arie Crown Theater, and it is the annual location for the Chicago Auto Show.

===Historic structures===

The area includes the Prairie Avenue Historic District (with both the John J. Glessner House and the Henry B. Clarke House) and the historic (former) R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons printing company building (which now houses network routers and switches for much of the city). The Glessner House, which is perhaps the best known historic structure in this district, is now a museum. William Wallace Kimball&#x27;s home was the long time headquarters of the United States Soccer Federation. Formerly, several important residences were located in this region. Additionally, the Fort Dearborn Massacre sculpture was on the property of the George Pullman residence as a tribute to the massacre, which occurred in the neighborhood. Many of the Prairie Avenue families worship at the historic Second Presbyterian Church on South Michigan Avenue in the heart of the district.

Adler Planetarium, R.R. Donnelley and Sons Co. Calumet Plant, Henry B. Clarke House, Coca-Cola Company Building (on Wabash), Field Museum of Natural History, John J. Glessner House, William W. Kimball House, Maxwell-Briscoe Automobile Company Showroom, Quinn Chapel AME Church, Harriet F. Rees House, Reid House, St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital Complex, Second Presbyterian Church, Shedd Aquarium, Soldier Field, and Wheeler-Kohn House are all located in the community area and are all listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Raymond M. Hilliard Center Historic District, Motor Row District, and Prairie Avenue District are districts largely within the community area that are also listed on the NRHP.

==Redevelopment==

Beginning in the mid-1990s, factories started being replaced with or converted to loft condominiums. The redevelopment continued through the early 2000s decade. South Loop residential development has expanded to the Dearborn Park neighborhood (between State and Clark Streets South of Roosevelt Road). The new Central Station neighborhood is the site of major mixed use development that includes One Museum Park, One Museum Park West, numerous residential condominiums and luxury townhomes. This development is built on of former rail yards and air space rights east of Indiana Avenue between Roosevelt Road and 18th Street that include the former location of the Central Station terminal. Also, a wave of loft conversions in Printer&#x27;s Row that has spread to major North-South Avenues such as Michigan, Wabash, and Indiana is making them residential streets again in this neighborhood after a century of other uses. The planned development has expanded from 69 to and includes properties between Michigan and Indiana Avenues. In 2006, the Prairie District Neighborhood Alliance, a non-profit organization was formed to provide representation for thousands of South Loop residents, including the Prairie District, Central Station and Museum Park, Motor Row, the South Michigan Ave Corridor, as well as other areas of the Near South Side.

==Streets==
Lake Shore Drive was reconstructed in 1996 so that it no longer cut through the Museum Campus. Previously, the northbound lanes ran east of Soldier Field. After reconstruction, both northbound and southbound lanes ran west of Soldier Field.

Its northern boundary (Roosevelt Road) marks the end of consecutively named east–west streets. East–west streets north of Roosevelt Road have street names, except between State Street and Michigan Avenue. There are two block-long 8th and 11th Streets and a four-block 9th Street. Most streets south of Roosevelt simply use street numbers. Streets in this neighborhood from 13th to 26th are mostly numbered. Cullerton Street (20th Street) and Cermak Road (22nd Street) are two of the few named east–west cross streets. Numbering continues southward in Chicago into the upper hundreds at a pace of 8 blocks per mile.

==Politics==
The Near South Side community area has supported the Democratic Party in the 2012, 2016, and 2020 presidential elections. In the 2020 presidential election the 4th Ward, which includes the Printer&#x27;s Row subsection of the community area, cast 26,003 votes for Joe Biden and 1,799 votes for Donald Trump (92.24% to 6.38%). The 3rd Ward, which comprises the majority of the remainder of the Near South Side, cast 25,182 votes for Joe Biden and 2,559 votes for Donald Trump (89.53% to 9.10%). In the 2016 presidential election, the Near South Side cast 9,761 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 1,425 votes for Donald Trump (83.43% to 12.18%). In the 2012 presidential election, the Near South Side cast 9,252 votes for Barack Obama and cast 2,253 votes for Mitt Romney (79.33% to 19.32%).

==South Loop/Printer&#x27;s Row overlap==

Because neighborhood line drawing is sometimes imprecise, there is some confusion regarding where the South Loop neighborhood (which incorporates Printer&#x27;s Row) begins and ends. Some sources do not define its northern boundary, while defining its southern boundary as Cermak Street (22nd Street) and its western boundary as Canal Street. The Prairie District Neighborhood Alliance, a not-for-profit neighborhood organization, has grown to provide support and representation to thousands of residents living in and around the South Loop and Near South Side of Chicago, including the Prairie Avenue District, Central Station and Museum Park, Motor Row and the South Michigan Avenue corridor, but the organization does not exclude those that are part of the broader South Loop and Near South Side community. The Greater South Loop Association represents residents living between Congress to the North, the Chicago River to the west and the Stevenson Expressway (approximately 25th Street) to the south. South Loop Neighbors serves residents only as far south as &quot;approximately&quot; 15th Street and as far west as the river. Fodor&#x27;s has its own definition of the South Loop as the area bounded by Cermak, Michigan Avenue, the Chicago River, and Congress Parkway-Eisenhower Expressway.
The South Loop is described as the neighborhood immediately south of &quot;the Loop&quot;, yet &quot;the Loop&quot; has multiple meanings. The Loop is a community area bounded by the Chicago River, Lake Michigan and Roosevelt Road. However, the term is also used to refer to the specific area bounded by the circular portion of the Chicago &quot;L&quot;, which goes as far south as Van Buren Street or Congress Avenue (and this is described as the northern border of Printer&#x27;s Row and the South Loop). Some primary sources cite Printer&#x27;s Row and the South Loop as part of the Near South Side community area. This transit-related area is the northern portion of the community area. Saying it is south of the former places it in the Near South Side, while saying it is part of the latter places it in the Loop. The Official City of Chicago Loop Map supports the latter.

<doc id="1325940" wikidata="Q2865886" url="?curid=1325940" title="Anarchism and the arts">
<text>Anarchism has long had an association with the arts, particularly with visual art, music and literature. This can be dated back to the start of anarchism as a named political concept, and the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon on the French realist painter Gustave Courbet. In an 1857 essay on Courbet, Proudhon set out a principle for art, which he saw in the work of Courbet, that it should show the real lives of the working classes and the injustices working people face at the hands of the bourgeoisie.

The French novelist Émile Zola objected to Proudhon advocating freedom for all in the name of anarchism, but then placing stipulations on artists as to what they should depict in their works. This opened up a division in thinking on anarchist art which is still apparent today, with some anarchist writers and artists advocating a view that art should be propagandistic and used to further the anarchist cause, and others that anarchism should free the artist from the requirements to serve a patron and master, allowing the artist to pursue their own interests and agendas. In recent years the first of these approaches has been argued by writers such as Patricia Leighten and the second by Michael Paraskos.

Significant writers on the relationship between art and anarchism include Proudhon, Peter Kropotkin, Herbert Read, Alex Comfort, George Woodcock, David Goodway, Allan Antliff and Cindy Milstein. Despite this history of a close relationship between art and anarchism, some anarchist writers such as Kropotkin and Read have argued that in an anarchist society the role of the artist would disappear completely as all human activity would become, in itself, artistic. This is a view of art in society that sees creativity as intrinsic to all human activity whereas the effect of bourgeois capitalism has been to strip human life of its creative aspects through industrial standardisation, the atomisation of production processes and the professionalisation of art through the education system.

For some writers, under anarchism artists would not disappear as they would continue to provide an anarchist society with a space in which to continue imagining new ways of understanding and organising reality as well as a space in which to face possible fears. This is similar to Noël Carroll&#x27;s theory of the function of horror stories and films in current society: &quot;Art-horror is the price we are willing to pay for the revelation of that which is impossible and unknown, of that which violates our conceptual schema.&quot;

== Overview ==
About anarchism and the arts, historian David Goodway wrote:
Anarchism had a significant influence on French Symbolism of the late 19th century, such as that of Stéphane Mallarmé, who was quoted as saying, &quot;Je ne sais pas d&#x27;autre bombe, qu&#x27;un livre.&quot; (I know of no bomb other than a book.) Its ideas infiltrated the cafes and cabarets of turn-of-the-century Paris (see the Drunken Boat #2).

Oscar Wilde&#x27;s 1891 essay &quot;The Soul of Man under Socialism&quot; has been seen as advocating anarchism. Oscar Wilde &quot;stated in an interview that he believed he was &#x27;something of an Anarchist&#x27;, but previously said, &#x27;In the past I was a poet and a tyrant. Now I am an anarchist and artist.

Many American artists of the early 20th century came under the influence of anarchist ideas, while others embraced anarchism as an ideology. The Ashcan School of American realism included anarchist artists, as well as artists such as Rockwell Kent (1882–1971) and George Bellows (1882–1925) who were influenced by anarchist ideas. Abstract expressionism also included anarchist artists such as Mark Rothko and painters such as Jackson Pollock, who had adopted radical ideas during his experience as a muralist for the Works Progress Administration. Pollock&#x27;s father had also been a Wobbly.

David Weir has argued in &quot;Anarchy and Culture&quot; that anarchism only had some success in the sphere of cultural avant-gardism because of its failure as a political movement; cognizant of anarchism&#x27;s claims to overcome the barrier between art and political activism, he nevertheless suggests that this is not achieved in reality. Weir suggests that for the &quot;ideologue&quot; it might be possible to adapt &quot;aesthetics to politics,&quot; but that &quot;from the perspective of the poet&quot; a solution might be to &quot;adapt the politics to the aesthetics.&quot; He identifies this latter strategy with anarchism, on account of its individualism. Weir has also suggested that &quot;the contemporary critical strategy of aestheticizing politics&quot; among Marxists such as Fredric Jameson likewise results from the demise of Marxism as a state ideology. &quot;The situation whereby ideology attempts to operate outside of politics has already pointed Marxism toward postmodernist culture, just as anarchism moved into the culture of modernism when it ceased to have political validity.&quot;

Late 20th century examples of anarchism and the arts include the collage works by James Koehnline, Johan Humyn Being, and others whose work was being published in anarchist magazines such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Fifth Estate&quot;. The Living Theatre, a theatrical troupe headed by Judith Malina and Julian Beck, were outspoken about their anarchism, often incorporating anarchistic themes into their performances.

In the 1990s, anarchist interest in the DIY movement and anarcho-punk subcultures also led to the rise of anarchist involvement in creating mail art – &quot;art which uses the postal service in some way&quot; – as well as in the zine movement. Some contemporary anarchists make art in the form of flyposters, stencils, and radical puppets.

== Visual art ==

=== 19th-century realism ===
Visual art was considered one of the most important aspects of anarchist activity from the birth of anarchism, with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon writing on his friend and contemporary Gustave Courbet in the essay &quot;Du Principe de l&#x27;art&quot;, published 1865, that &quot;The task of art is to warn us, to praise us, to teach us, to make us blush by confronting us with the mirror of our own conscience.&quot; Courbet also went on to paint Proudhon on several occasions. Similarly Courbet himself wrote in 1850:

=== Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism ===

Among the Impressionists, the artist Camille Pissarro is known to have had strong anarchist sympathies which led him to recommend to his children that they change their surnames to avoid being associated with his political beliefs. Pissarro&#x27;s anarchism brought him into contact with the younger artists who formed the Neo-Impressionist group, particularly Paul Signac, Henri-Edmond Cross, Charles Angrand, Théo van Rysselberghe and Maximillien Luce, who were active in anarchist circles, particularly those of the political activist Jean Grave, who encouraged other anarchist activists to embrace the potential of art to further their cause. In their collaborations they established a tripartite relationship between art and anarchism, still debated to this day, in which the artist could be employed for direct propagandistic purposes, or could show images of the true condition of the proletariat, or, more controversially, envision future realities towards which an anarchist revolution might aspire. It is in this latter context that the bucolic images of the south of France by artists such as Cross and Signac can be viewed as anarchist paintings.

=== Cubism and futurism ===
Patricia Leighten has shown that Spanish cubist painter Juan Gris was an artist with strong anarchist sympathies, although she argues this is only evident in his overtly political cartoons. She suggests his cubist still lives deliberately eschewed anarchist subject matter so that he &quot;self-consciously drained his paintings of political import, avoiding such anarchist subjects as prostitutes and neutralised his radical style.&quot; However, drawing on the principle established by Neo-Impressionist artists such as Cross and Signac, that anarchist art can also involve visualising alternative realities for an anarchist society, Michael Paraskos has criticised this reading of Gris&#x27;s paintings, saying that this form of anarchism seems to demand that &quot;artists conform to a predetermined template to define their work as radical. Cartoons of prostitutes are anarchist; paintings of bottles, playing cards and fruit are not.&quot;

Though typically not associated with futurism, anarchism had some minor influence on Futurism. Carlo Carrà&#x27;s best known work was &quot;The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli&quot;, painted in 1911. In the 1912 catalogue for the Futurists&#x27; first Parisian exhibition, Umberto Boccioni remarked &quot;the sheaves of lines corresponding to all the conflicting forces, following the general law of violence&quot; which he labeled &quot;force lines&quot; encapsulating the Futurist idea of physical transcendentalism. Mark Antliff has suggested that this futurist aesthetic was &quot;designed to involve the spectator in the very politics that led to Italy&#x27;s intervention in World War I and, ultimately, to the rise of Fascism in Italy.&quot; The art historian Giovanni Lista has identified this aesthetic as first appearing in the anarcho-syndicalist current, where Marinetti encountered the Sorelian &quot;myths of action and violence&quot;.

The individualist anarchist philosopher and poet Renzo Novatore belonged to the leftist section of futurism alongside other individualist anarcho-futurists such as Dante Carnesecchi, Leda Rafanelli, Auro d&#x27;Arcola, and Giovanni Governato.

=== Surrealism ===

Surrealism was both an artistic and political movement with aims at the liberation of the human being from the constraints of capitalism, the state, and the cultural forces that limit the reign of the imagination. From its origins individualist anarchists like Florent Fels opposed it with his magazine &quot;Action: Cahiers individualistes de philosophie et d&#x27;art&quot;. However faced with the popularity of surrealism Fels&#x27; magazine closed in 1922. The movement developed in France in the wake of World War I with André Breton (1896–1966) as its main theorist and poet. Originally it was tied closely to the Communist Party. Later, Breton, a close friend of Leon Trotsky, broke with the Communist Party and embraced anarchism, even writing in the publication of the French Anarchist Federation.

By the end of World War II the surrealist group led by Breton had decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote &quot;It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself.&quot; &quot;Breton was consistent in his support for the francophone Anarchist Federation and he continued to offer his solidarity after the Platformists around Fontenis transformed the FA into the Federation Communiste Libertaire. He was one of the few intellectuals who continued to offer his support to the FCL during the Algerian War (1954–1962) when the FCL suffered severe repression and was forced underground. He sheltered Fontenis whilst he was in hiding. He refused to take sides on the splits in the French anarchist movement and both he and Peret expressed solidarity as well with the new FA set up by the synthesist anarchists, and worked in the Antifascist Committees of the 1960s alongside the FA.&quot;

=== Post-war modernism ===
In the period after World War II the relationship between art and anarchism was articulated by a number of theorists including Alex Comfort, Herbert Read and George Woodcock. Although each wrote from perspectives supportive of modernist art they refused to accept the position put forward by Clement Greenberg that modernist art had no political, social or narrative meaning, a view that would have curtailed an anarchist reading of modern art. In his study on the relationship between modern art and radical politics, Social Radicalism and the Arts, Donald Drew Egbert argued that in fact, modern artists were often most at home with an anarchist understanding of the position of the place of the artist in society than either a de-politicised Greenbergian or a Marxist understanding of the role of art.
=== Contemporary art ===
In contemporary art anarchism can take diverse forms, from carnivalesque street art, to graffiti art and graphic novels, to various traditional forms of art, including painting, sculpture, video and photography.
== Music ==

A number of performers and artists have either been inspired by anarchist concepts, or have used the medium of music and sound in order to promote anarchist ideas and politics. French singers-songwriters Léo Ferré and Georges Brassens are maybe the first to do so, in the fifties and beyond.

Punk rock is one movement that has taken much inspiration from the often potent imagery and symbolism associated with anarchism and Situationist rhetoric, if not always the political theory. In the past few decades, anarchism has been closely associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Indeed, many anarchists were introduced to the ideas of Anarchism through that symbolism and the anti-authoritarian sentiment which many punk songs expressed.

Anarcho-punk, on the other hand, is a current that has been more explicitly engaged with anarchist politics, particularly in the case of bands such as Crass, Poison Girls, (early) Chumbawamba, The Ex, Dead End, Flux of Pink Indians, Rudimentary Peni, The Apostles, Riot/Clone, Conflict, Oi Polloi, Sin Dios, Propagandhi, Citizen Fish, Bus Station Loonies etc. Many other bands, especially at the local level of unsigned groups, have taken on what is known as a &quot;punk&quot; or &quot;DIY&quot; ethic: that is, Do It Yourself, indeed a popular Anarcho-punk slogan reads &quot;DIY not EMI&quot;, a reference to a conscious rejection of the major record company. Some groups who began as &#x27;anarcho-punk&#x27; have attempted to move their ideas into a more mainstream musical arena, for instance, Chumbawamba, who continue to support and promote anarchist politics despite now playing more dance music and pop influenced styles. The Folk Punk genre also heavily explores anarchist ideas in an inherently DIY fashion. Pat the Bunny, Ramshackle Glory, The Taxpayers, Mischief Brew, and Days N Daze are examples of thematically anarchist folk punk bands.

Techno music is also connected strongly to anarchists and eco-anarchists, as many of the events playing these types of music are self-organised and put on in contravention of national laws. Sometimes doors are pulled off empty warehouses and the insides transformed into illegal clubs with cheap (or free) entrance, types of music not heard elsewhere and quite often an abundance of different drugs. Other raves may be held outside, and are viewed negatively by the authorities. In the UK, the Criminal Justice Bill (1994) outlawed these events (raves) and brought together a coalition of socialists, ravers and direct actionists who opposed the introduction of this &#x27;draconian&#x27; Act of Parliament by having a huge &#x27;party&amp;protest&#x27; in the Centre of London that descended into one of the largest riots of the 1990s in Britain. Digital hardcore, an electronic music genre, is also overtly anarchist; Atari Teenage Riot is the most widely recognized digital hardcore band. Both Digital Hardcore, Techno and related genres are not the sole preserve of anarchists; people of many musical, political or recreational persuasions are involved in these musical scenes.

Heavy metal bands such as Sweden&#x27;s Arch Enemy and Germany&#x27;s Kreator have also embraced anarchistic themes in their lyrics and imagery. The genre of folk punk or &quot;radical folk&quot; has become increasingly prevalent in protest culture, with artists like Johnny Hobo and the Freight Trains openly asserting anarchist beliefs. Negativland&#x27;s &quot;The ABCs of Anarchism&quot; includes a reading of material from Alexander Berkman&#x27;s &quot;Now and After&quot; and other anarchist-related material in a sound collage.

Paul Gailiunas and his late wife Helen Hill co-wrote the anarchist song &quot;Emma Goldman&quot;, which was performed by the band Piggy: The Calypso Orchestra of the Maritimes and released on their 1999 album &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Calypso: Songs of Love and Liberation&quot;. After Helen and Paul moved to New Orleans, Paul started a new band called The Troublemakers and re-released the song &quot;Emma Goldman&quot; on their 2004 album &quot;Here Come The Troublemakers&quot;. Proclaiming the motto &quot;It&#x27;s your duty as a citizen to troublemake,&quot; other songs on the album include &quot;International Flag Burning Day.&quot;

&quot;The Charter of the Forest ,&quot; which invented the genre of &quot;Read-Opera,&quot; is a combination poetic-musical work which espouses anarchist ideas of opposition to hierarchy, as well as being highly influenced by a Tolstoyan commitment to nonviolence.

<text>The Nanjing City (南京城, Nanjing Cheng, literally Nanjing City), or translated as the Walled city of Nanjing, etc., refers to the historical core of Nanjing city enclosed in the Nanjing City Wall built in the early Ming dynasty. The area is about 55 square kilometers. Presently, parts of Qinhuai, Jianye, Gulou and Xuanwu districts of Nanjing are in the enclosed area. Around the City there are waters, rivers or lakes, along with the city wall.

The present Nanjing City Wall was built in Ming dynasty. The Stone City built in 333 BCE in Warring States period is located in the western part of present Nanjing City, and at that time it was the county town of Jinling. The Stone City was rebuilt by Wu during Three Kingdoms, and later the Kingdom of Wu renamed the city Jianye and made it the capital. In Eastern Jin dynasty, the capital city was renamed Jiankang. In Ming dynasty, it renamed Nanking.

The imperial palace site is located in eastern part of the Nankin city. Nanjing Museum is beside it. The observatory site is located on the Qintian Mountain (or Jiming Mountain) in middle north. Gulou Square, lying at the foot of the mountain, is the city center. Not far from Gulou, near the east-west trend ridge from the mountain to Stone Mountain (or Qingliang Mountain), there are many cultural institutions, and also universities and colleges, most of which have added new campuses outside the city in recent years. Xinjiekou, another city center, is a typical central business district, with numerous businesses including various financial firms, stores, restaurants, hotels, entertainment places concentrated there. Several big hospitals are located near Gulou - Xinjiekou area. Presidential Palace is also in the area. The southern area is called Chengnan (城南, the city southern parts), or sometimes called Lao Chengnan (Old Chengnan). Lao Chengnan may also refer to people that have lived in Chengnan for generations and speak old Nankin accent. Many old buildings remain in Chengnan, especially the historical architectures centered on Fuzimiao. Branches of Qinhuai River flow through the city and along the city wall.

Broadly speaking, Nanjing city represents the whole administrative area of Nanjing, including both urban and rural area. Sometimes Nanjing city indicates urban area of Nanjing main city, and in this circumstance generally the term Nanjing Shiqu () is used. Nanjing Zhu Chengqu (Nanjing Main City Area, 南京主城區) is a frequently used phrase, which means the enclosed Nanjing City and the urban area around it. Another frequently used phrase, Nanjing Metropolitan Region (Nanjing Dushi Quan, 南京都市圈), includes Nanjing and surrounding cities and areas, with acreage over 60 thousand km2 and population over 30 million.

In 2001, 60% urban people of Nanjing, i.e., 1.5 million people lived inside the Nanjing City, just a similar population size of Nanking (Jiankang) in Jin dynasty 1600 years ago. After rapid expanding in recent years, the urban area of Nanjing is more than 1000 km2, near 20 times larger than the Nanjing City. The total administrative area of Nanjing is about 6600 km2.

<doc id="1325947" wikidata="Q1761035" url="?curid=1325947" title="Softail">
<text>A softail (shortened form of &quot;soft tail&quot;) motorcycle intentionally looks like vintage motorcycles with a rigid hard-tail frame that has a triangle of steel tubes at the rear axle, as on a bicycle frame, but on a Softail these tubes are actually a triangular swingarm, with the shock absorber(s) hidden, as opposed to clearly visible regular twin shocks on both sides of the rear wheel on standard bikes. Since the introduction of the Harley-Davidson &quot;FXST Softail&quot; in 1983 as a registered trademark of the Motor Company, &quot;softail&quot; has become a genericized trademark for other models of cruiser motorcycles with rear suspensions hidden for retro style reasons. This was done even though the rear wheel was often hidden behind bags or exhaust pipes.

==History==
The first rear suspensions on motorcycles were introduced before World War I, and many companies offered fully suspended motorbikes before World War II, but most designs were either expensive, prone to wear and tear, or added more instability than comfort or better roadholding, especially when damping was insufficient. The models that remained hard tails offered suspended bicycle-like seats for a minimum of rider comfort. After World War II, imported British bikes with rear suspension and good handling became popular. Harley-Davidson replaced the &quot;Springer&quot; leading link fork in 1949 with a telescopic hydraulically dampened &quot;Hydra Glide&quot; front fork that offered more travel, a design that is still state-of-the-art today. After the all-new entry-level 1952 Harley-Davidson Model K adopted the by now standard rear swingarm with twin shock absorbers, the Big Twin FL continued to rely on the big suspended seat until the 1958 &quot;Duo Glide&quot; got twin shocks, too. 

===Hardtail cult following===
In the 1950s and 1960s, customized motorcycles appeared, many of them based on old Harleys, like surplus US Army Harley-Davidson WLA, or other brands, and often with hard tail frames rather than suspended ones. While the earlier bobbers still used the suspended single seat, the 1960s choppers had a small seat cushion directly on the hard tail frame, giving the rider a position much lower and rearward than on stock Harleys, which at the time were mainly ridden by Police officers. This position was without doubt uncomfortable, but it looked cool and gave the rider a tough guy, outlaw image. Some other obsolete and risky features were still used for coolness, like the so-called suicide clutch that was operated by left foot, with the left hand working a jockey shift, or the kick starter, even after electric starters were available. Even the front brake was removed for a good clean look, like on the more famous of the &quot;Easy Rider&quot; Harleys, the &quot;Captain America&quot;. As seen in the movie, these hard tails were not easy to ride on bad roads and could be painful if sat on over bumps such as railway crossings. Even after suspension was available for over 20 years, in the 1970s many riders preferred these old style tough guy frames, and even new hard tail frames were made by aftermarket companies. 

In 1970, Harley only had the big twin full-dresser touring bike, the FLH Electra Glide, and the small XL Sportster. With the FX Super Glide, the Big Twin Harley-Davidson Shovelhead engine was offered without the extras of the E-Glide, and with the narrow front end of the Sportster, later offered as the FXRS Low Rider. By the end of the decade, the FXWG Wide Glide was kind of a factory chopper, with a wide telescopic fork like on the FLH, narrow 21 inch wheel, buckhorn handle bar, bobbed fender, a small sissy bar, and even flames paint job. It still had twin shocks, though, and many bikers wanted the clean look of the hard tail frame, with the frame forming a straight line from the steering head to the rear axle.

===Introduction of the FXST Softail===
Bill Davis, an avid Harley rider and engineer from St. Louis, Missouri, designed his softail in the mid-1970s. His first design, which he worked on in 1974 and 1975, had a cantilever swingarm like on vintage Vincent Motorcycles that pivoted at the bottom and sprung at the top with the springs and shock absorber hidden under the seat. Davis then built a prototype based on his 1972 Super Glide. He patented the design and arranged to meet Willie G. Davidson August 1976. Davidson was impressed, but made no commitments, and six months later, said Harley-Davidson was interested but would not use the design at that time.

In April 1980, Harley-Davidson started work on its own rear suspension design that would have the look of a hard-tail motorcycle. The job was given a low priority until later in the year it was transferred to Jim Haubert Engineering, a firm that Harley-Davidson contracted yearly to custom build motorcycles and prototypes. Haubert built a prototype using his own rear suspension design that closely followed the look of the earlier Harley rigid frames. This version was completed enough for review by Harley-Davidson in January 1981.

Davis continued to develop the design, switching the pivot and the springing points around so that the springs and shock absorber were under the frame and the pivot point was at the top of the triangular swingarm. This allowed the traditional horse shoe shaped Harley-Davidson oil tank to be placed under the seat. Davis attempted to produce the new design independently as the Road Worx Sub-Shock, but the partnership he had put together for this purpose collapsed. Harley-Davidson executive Jeffrey Bleustein contacted Davis shortly afterward and began negotiations to buy Davis&#x27;s design. Davis sold his patents, prototype, and tooling to Harley-Davidson in January 1982. 

After further testing and development, Davis&#x27;s design was introduced in June 1983 as the 1984 Harley-Davidson FXST Softail. This basically was an FXWG Wide Glide, but instead of the visible twin shocks, the softail swingarm was used, with the shocks hidden under the gearbox, which at the time was still 4-speed with kickstarter and chain. Other companies had introduced rear suspension designs with invisible shocks, but for performance reasons. The Harley Softail was the first modern motorcycle intentionally designed to look as if it was decades older. Between gearbox and seat, the rather dull asymmetric battery box (right side) and black oil tank (left side) was replaced by the symmetric horse-shoe shaped chrome oil tank around the battery in the middle, another feature of the old hard tail era. 

In addition, Harley had just completed the &quot;buy back&quot; from AMF, and had developed the all-aluminium Harley-Davidson Evolution engine that was more reliable that the Shovelhead, and had heads that looked like square versions of the round Panheads. It was first offered in the Softail, and helped making it a success. 

==Other Harley-Davidson Softails==
From 1986 onwards, Harley offered the Heritage Softail that copies the look of the 1950s Hydra Glide full dresser, with big front wheel, big head lights plus additional lights, big fenders, floor boards, saddle bags, windshield. By 1988, even the Springer front fork that was discontinued in 1948 was offered again, as a modern design with better bushings and a central damper. Even Heritage Springers were offered, that looked like the 1936 to 1947 Knuckleheads. 

There have been many Harley-Davidson models with the Softail frame, including the Softail Standard, Custom, Springer Softail, Heritage Softail, Heritage Springer, Night Train, Deluxe, Deuce, Fat Boy, Softail Slim, the Dark Custom Cross Bones, the Dark Custom Blackline and Breakout. With the exception of the Deuce, which has a longer tank, these motorcycles have the same engines, transmissions, and frames, differing mainly in the fork, wheels, and accessories.

===Front forks===
The Softail model line has multiple front fork configurations. Historically, they have had Springer leading link forks, reminiscent of the sprung front-ends that were used before the Hydra-Glide in 1949. The FXST designation is used for 21&quot; front wheel bikes or when the Springer fork is used with a 21&quot; wheel, while the FLST designation is used for 16&quot; front wheel bikes or when the Springer fork is used with a 16&quot; wheel.

===Engines===
Because Softail models do not have rubber-mounted engines, they transmit more of the engine&#x27;s vibration to the rider than the Touring or Dyna models (which have rubber engine mounts). To compensate, later Softail models used a counterbalanced version of the Twin Cam engine, the 88B, instead of the regular Twin Cam engine used in the Touring and Dyna models. This counterbalanced engine was enlarged to 96B and 103B before it was replaced by a variant of the Harley-Davidson Milwaukee-Eight engine for the 2018 model year.

=== New Softail from 2018 onwards ===

In 2017, Harley unveiled a completely redesigned Softail frame for the 2018 model year, the first major change since the introduction of the Twin Cam engine in 2000. The 2018 Softail frame uses a differently shaped swingarm suspended by a single rear shock absorber, mounted underneath the seat in a similar fashion to the original Haubert and Davis designs. Harley claims that the new chassis is significantly stiffer and lighter than the previous-generation Softail and Dyna platforms, the latter being discontinued with some of its models being carried over to the new Softail chassis. The 2017 Street Bob 103 ci was dyno tested and made and at the rear wheel. The new 2018 Street Bob 107 ci makes and at the rear wheel. The 114 ci motor such as in the 2018 Heritage Classic produces and at the rear wheel.

=== Customizing ===
The Softail is the most popular Harley-Davidson model family for heavy customizing and is often used for show bikes. Many aftermarket manufacturers around the globe have specialized in Softail parts &amp; accessories like wheels, fenders or tanks to change the look of the custom motorcycle. Harley-Davidson also started an Inspiration Gallery to show their latest factory custom parts on all new models - many have their origin in CVO Softails, which are handmade Limited-Editions of the regular models.

<doc id="1325949" wikidata="Q334640" url="?curid=1325949" title="Tautomer">
<text>In chemistry, tautomers () are structural isomers (constitutional isomers) of chemical compounds that readily interconvert. The chemical reaction interconverting the two is called tautomerization. This conversion commonly results from the relocation of a hydrogen atom within the compound. The phenomenon of tautomerization is called tautomerism, also called desmotropism. Tautomerism is for example relevant to the behavior of amino acids and nucleic acids, two of the fundamental building blocks of life.

Care should be taken not to confuse tautomers with depictions of &quot;contributing structures&quot; in chemical resonance. Tautomers are distinct chemical species that can be distinguished by their differing atomic connectivities, molecular geometries, and physicochemical and spectroscopic properties, whereas resonance forms are merely alternative Lewis structure (valence bond theory) depictions of a single chemical species, whose true structure is a quantum superposition, essentially the &quot;average&quot; of the idealized, hypothetical geometries implied by these resonance forms.

The term &quot;tautomer&quot; is derived .

== Examples ==
Tautomerization is pervasive in organic chemistry. It is typically associated with polar molecules and ions containing functional groups that are at least weakly acidic. Most common tautomers exist in pairs, which means that the hydrogen is located at one of two positions, and even more specifically the most common form involves a hydrogen changing places with a double bond: . Common tautomeric pairs include:
* ketone – enol: , see keto–enol tautomerism
* enamine – imine: 
**cyanamide – carbodiimide
**guanidine – guanidine – guanidine: With a central carbon surrounded by three nitrogens, a guanidine group allows this transform in three possible orientations
* amide – imidic acid: (e.g., the latter is encountered during nitrile hydrolysis reactions)
**lactam – lactim, a cyclic form of amide-imidic acid tautomerism in 2-pyridone and derived structures such as the nucleobases guanine, thymine, and cytosine
* imine – imine, e.g., during pyridoxal phosphate catalyzed enzymatic reactions 
*nitro – &quot;aci&quot;-nitro (nitronic acid): 
* nitroso – oxime: 
* ketene – ynol, which involves a triple bond: 
* amino acid – ammonium carboxylate, which applies to the building blocks of the proteins. This shifts the proton more than two atoms away, producing a zwitterion rather than shifting a double bond: 
*phosphite – phosphonate: between trivalent and pentavalent phosphorus.

==Prototropy==
Prototropy is the most common form of tautomerism and refers to the relocation of a hydrogen atom. Prototropic tautomerism may be considered a subset of acid-base behavior. Prototropic tautomers are sets of isomeric protonation states with the same empirical formula and total charge. Tautomerizations are catalyzed by:
* bases, involving a series of steps: deprotonation, formation of a delocalized anion (e.g., an enolate), and protonation at a different position of the anion; and
* acids, involving a series of steps: protonation, formation of a delocalized cation, and deprotonation at a different position adjacent to the cation).
Two specific further subcategories of tautomerizations:
*Annular tautomerism is a type of prototropic tautomerism wherein a proton can occupy two or more positions of the heterocyclic systems found in many drugs, for example, 1&quot;H&quot;- and 3&quot;H&quot;-imidazole; 1&quot;H&quot;-, 2&quot;H&quot;- and 4&quot;H&quot;- 1,2,4-triazole; 1&quot;H&quot;- and 2&quot;H&quot;- isoindole.
*Ring–chain tautomers occur when the movement of the proton is accompanied by a change from an open structure to a ring, such as the open chain and cyclic hemiacetal (typically pyranose or furanose forms) of many sugars. (See .) The tautomeric shift can be described as H−O ⋅ C=O ⇌ O−C−O−H, where the &quot;⋅&quot; indicates the initial absence of a bond.

== Valence tautomerism ==
Valence tautomerism is a type of tautomerism in which single and/or double bonds are rapidly formed and ruptured, without migration of atoms or groups. It is distinct from prototropic tautomerism, and involves processes with rapid reorganisation of bonding electrons.
A pair of valence tautomers with formula C6H6O are benzene oxide and oxepin.

Other examples of this type of tautomerism can be found in bullvalene, and in open and closed forms of certain heterocycles, such as organic azides and tetrazoles, or mesoionic münchnone and acylamino ketene.

Valence tautomerism requires a change in molecular geometry and should not be confused with canonical resonance structures or mesomers.
== Inorganic materials ==

In inorganic extended solids, valence tautomerism can manifest itself in the change of oxidation states its spatial distribution upon the change of macroscopic thermodynamic conditions. Such effects have been called charge ordering or valence mixing to describe the behavior in inorganic oxides.
==Consequences for chemical databases==
The existence of multiple possible tautomers for individual chemical substances can lead to confusion. For example, samples of 2-pyridone and 2-hydroxypyridine do not exist as separate isolatable materials: the two tautomeric forms are interconvertible and the proportion of each depends on factors such as temperature, solvent, and additional substituents attached to the main ring.
Historically, each form of the substance was entered into databases such as those maintained by the Chemical Abstracts Service and given separate CAS Registry Numbers. 2-Pyridone was assigned [142-08-5] and 2-hydroxypyridine [109-10-4]. The latter is now a &quot;replaced&quot; registry number so that look-up by either identifier reaches the same entry. The facility to automatically recognise such potential tautomerism and ensure that all tautomers are indexed together has been greatly facilitated by the creation of the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) and associated software. Thus the standard InChI for either tautomer is codice_1.

<text>The Medical Library Association of Great Britain and Ireland was founded in 1908 and held two annual meetings. Its first formal meeting was held in Belfast in July 1909 (during the meetings of the British Medical Association) and its second, in London, in 1910 (also in conjunction with the meetings of the British Medical Association.) No written record of its activities after 1911 has been found.

William Osler was one of the founders, in 1898, of the Medical Library Association in North America (initially called the Association of Medical Librarians) and served as its President from 1901-04. Osler moved to England in 1905 as he had been appointed Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University. Shortly after his arrival he was also involved in the formation of the short-lived British equivalent and he was elected the new Association&#x27;s President in 1909.

The proceedings of the Association&#x27;s 1909 meeting were published as a separate publication and are the first eight pages of Volume 1 of the &quot;Proceedings of the Medical Library Association of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;. A copy of this publication is in the Osler Library of McGill University in Montreal where Part 1 is Osler 7206. Part 2 of Volume 1 (pp. 9–19) is the Presidential Address by William Osler (Osler 3576 No. 286). Osler&#x27;s Presidential Address - entitled &quot;The medical library in post-graduate work&quot; - was originally published in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, October 2, 1909, pp. 925–8. No further issues of the &quot;Proceedings&quot; were published.

It appears that the Osler Library copy of the &quot;Proceedings of the MLA-GBI&quot; may be a final proof copy as it contains proof-reader&#x27;s corrections but, to date, no other copy has been found for comparison. A copy of these &quot;Proceedings&quot; is at </text><links>

<text>The Near West Side, one of the 77 community areas of Chicago, is on the West Side, west of the Chicago River and adjacent to the Loop. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 started on the Near West Side. Waves of immigration shaped the history of the Near West Side of Chicago, including the founding of Hull House, a prominent settlement house. The near west side comprises several neighborhoods. In the 19th century railroads became prominent features. In the mid-20th century, the area saw the development of freeways centered in the Jane Byrne Interchange.

The area is home to the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Chicago-Kent College of Law, and City Colleges&#x27; Malcolm X College. the United Center, the Illinois Medical District, Union Station, Ogilvie Station, and the Jane Byrne Interchange are also located in the community area.

== Neighborhoods ==

===West Loop===

The West Loop lies along the western bank of the Chicago River. It generally includes the districts of Fulton River, Fulton Market, and Greektown. It is approximately bounded by Grand Avenue on the north, Ashland Avenue on the west, the Eisenhower Expressway on the south, and the Chicago River on the east. Popular restaurants line Randolph Street, including Girl and the Goat by Stephanie Izard, and Leña Brava, founded by Rick Bayless who has since departed the establishment. The area has experienced rapid gentrification. A former manufacturing and warehousing area, many of the buildings have been converted to loft condominiums, restaurants, bars, and art galleries. Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Harpo Studios were located on Randolph Street; the site is now the recently constructed corporate headquarters of McDonald&#x27;s.

==== Fulton River District and Fulton Market ====

The Fulton River District makes up the north east area of the Near West Side, on the Chicago River just west of the Loop. The related Fulton Market area extends west of the Kennedy Expressway as far as Union Park. The district is a former manufacturing and current transportation corridor turned mixed-use commercial and residential neighborhood. The neighborhood includes warehouses that have been converted to loft condominiums, new construction high rise condominiums and apartments, high rise and mid rise business offices, retail and restaurants. The Fulton River District is the home of the Ogilvie Transportation Center (formerly Chicago &amp; North Western Station), a major commuter rail terminal. The neighborhood is known for the aroma of chocolate emanating from the Blommer Chocolate Company.

==== Greektown ====

Greektown is a restaurant and nightlife corridor along Halsted Street between Van Buren and Madison Streets. In the late 19th century Greek immigrants settled the area and competed with nearby Italians for business and jobs.

The area previously bustled with Greek restaurants but has seen Greek influence decrease as inhabitants moved to Chicago suburbs. Greektown is home to the National Hellenic Museum, the nation&#x27;s leading museum dedicated to the significant cultural contributions of Greek people.

=== Little Italy ===
The neighborhood between the Illinois Medical District and UIC&#x27;s east campus is known as Little Italy. An Italian community developed in the late nineteenth century.

Italians never actually constituted a majority in the polyglot area, but the neighborhood is still home to several Italian-American landmarks, such as the Shrine of Our Lady of Pompei and the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame, as well as Italian-American social clubs. Taylor Street is home to the Italian restaurants Rosebud, Francesca&#x27;s, Pompei and Al&#x27;s No. 1 Italian Beef. There are other schools in this neighborhood. For example, Village Leadership Academy (VLA).

Part of the Italian-American population of the neighborhood was displaced in the 1960s and 70s by the construction of UIC&#x27;s east campus. The university is the source of the current name for the area.

The 1980 novel &quot;Paper Fish&quot; by Tina De Rosa takes place in this community.

=== University Village/Maxwell Street ===

University Village is a neighborhood consisting of residential and retail properties. University Village, along with other major developments such as University Commons and University Station, is conveniently located near the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) campus, the medical district, and Maxwell Street.

The blocks around the intersection of Maxwell and Halsted Streets, the heart of University Village, once served as a weekly outdoor market. The area was also a center in the development of the Chicago Blues in the mid-twentieth century. The Market was moved twice in the 1990s and 2000s, and continues on Des Plaines Street. In the 2000s, UIC led a redevelopment of the area, which included new dormitories, parking garages, commercial buildings, and housing.

The borders are 16th Street to the south, the Dan Ryan Expressway to the east, Racine Avenue to the west, and Harrison Street to the north. Taylor Street is part of University Village.

=== South Water Market ===
Chicago&#x27;s original produce market sat along the south side of the Chicago River, west of what is now Michigan Avenue. Incoming vessels could bring fruits and vegetables from the states located around the Great Lakes. This market became known as South Water Market because of its location.

By the 1920s, the market was congested and overcrowded. The City of Chicago built new streets parallel to the Chicago River and moved the market to the neighborhood, alongside the St. Charles Air Line. The three-story buildings were originally designed by the architects Fugard &amp; Knapp.

On July 10, 2003, the Chicago Planning Commission granted their approval on the sale of the produce market for a cost of approximately $36 million to Enterprise Companies of Chicago redevelop into retail and housing.

=== Illinois Medical District ===

The Illinois Medical District is one of the largest medical districts in the United States, and the largest in the state. John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County (formerly known as Cook County Hospital), one of the largest county-run hospitals in the U.S. and inspiration for the TV shows &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, is located here. The District had its start in the 1870s when Cook County Hospital, Rush Medical College, and the College of Physicians and Surgeons were established on the Near West Side following the great Chicago fire of 1871. The cornerstone for the Medical Center was the building of Cook County Hospital in 1876. In 1877, Rush Medical College erected a building next to County at Harrison and Wood. Presbyterian Hospital (affiliated with Rush) was built in 1883. The University of Illinois at Chicago&#x27;s origins in the District can be traced to the College of Physicians and Surgeons, founded in 1881. In 1917, the State acquired the vacated West Side Park located at Polk and Wolcott for the university.

The district is also home to University of Illinois Medical Center, Rush University Medical Center, Rush University, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, UIC College of Dentistry, UIC College of Pharmacy, Jesse Brown VA, The Neuropsychiatric Institute, Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center, Chicago Lighthouse, Illinois Forensic Science Center, West Side CDC, the Chicago Children&#x27;s Advocacy Center, the Chicago office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, Chicago Department of Public Health and the Cook County Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office.

=== Tri-Taylor ===

The Tri-Taylor neighborhood lies directly west of the Illinois Medical District. The neighborhood area roughly resembles a triangle with the Eisenhower Expressway, Ogden Avenue, and industrial railroad tracks west of Western Avenue as the borders. The neighborhood is traditionally an extension of the Little Italy neighborhood to its east, although it has consistently been one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Chicago as it was situated on the borders of African American, Irish, Hispanic, and Italian areas. It is a residential area for students from UIC. The neighborhood is also home to the Chicago Technology Park research center as well as the West Side Center for Disease Control, the office for the Medical Examiner of Cook County, and Chicago Hope Academy (a private Christian high school that opened in the former St. Callistus School in 2005).

===United Center area===

The United Center opened its doors in 1994, replacing Chicago Stadium, which was located on the opposite side of Madison Street. The United Center is the home arena for the Chicago Bulls and Blackhawks. The United Center hosts over 200 events per year and has drawn over 20 million visitors since its opening. The venue can seat between 20,000 and 25,000 people, depending on the event. A statue of Michael Jordan stands in the &quot;atrium&quot;. The area around the United Center used to be known for its notoriously high crime rate and housing projects off Lake Street and Damen known as the Henry Horner Homes, also known as &quot;the Hornetz nest&quot;.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation Chicago Field Office is at 2111 W. Roosevelt Road.

==Transportation==
===Private transportation===
Interstates 290 and 90 both run through the Near West Side. Their interchange is a major transportation hub for the region. The southern and western boundaries of the area are defined by busy rail-road tracks. The St. Charles Air Line, at the area&#x27;s southern edge is also a major passenger train route.

===Public transportation===

There are many bus routes in the area.

For rapid transit, the area is served by the Blue, Green, and Pink Lines on the Chicago &quot;L&quot;. The Lake Street Elevated, the portion of the Green Line running through the area, has been in operation since 1893. The Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad, another company that built the &quot;L&quot;, opened several branches of rapid transit in the area in 1895 and 1896. These branches included the Logan Square, Garfield Park, and Douglas Park branches, which all converged into the Metropolitan main line at Marshfield station in the area. The Garfield Park branch and main line were replaced by the Congress Line in the 1950s, which continues as part of the Blue Line. The Logan Square branch was replaced in revenue service by the Milwaukee-Dearborn subway in 1951, but was retained for non-revenue linkage to the rest of the &quot;L&quot; system as the &quot;Paulina Connector&quot;; it was renovated in the 2000s and reactivated as part of the Pink Line in 2006. The Douglas Park branch was part of the Blue Line until it was joined with the Connector to become a part of the Pink Line.

Union and Ogilvie stations, major terminals for Metra and Amtrak trains, are on the eastern edge of the Near West Side. The Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad (AE&amp;C), an interurban, used the Garfield Park branch and Metropolitan main line&#x27;s tracks in the area to access downtown from 1905 to 1953; however, within Chicago it only boarded westbound passengers and alighted eastbound passengers lest it compete with the &quot;L&quot;.

==Economy==
Orbitz has its headquarters in the Citigroup Center in the Near West Side.

McDonald&#x27;s moved its headquarters to West Loop in 2018.

PepsiCo&#x27;s Chicago offices are in the Near West Side. Aeroméxico operates the Chicago Downtown Location on the first floor at 954 West Washington Boulevard.

The Consulate-General of Mexico in Chicago is located at 204 South Ashland Avenue.

Previously, Trizec Properties&#x27;s headquarters and Chicago-area offices were in 10 S. Riverside Plaza.

Crane High School previously served as the zoned high school for the Near West Side. CPS announced in 2012 that Crane was to be converted into a magnet school for medical sciences. Whitney M. Young Magnet High School is also in the Near West Side.

Washington Irving School is located in Tri-Taylor. In the 2000–2001 school year, of the area children who attended CPS schools (the figure does not include those who attended private schools nor charter schools), 69% attended Irving. By the 2013–2014 school year this declined to 46%, and Linda Lutton of &quot;WBEZ&quot; stated that Irving &quot;is largely ignored by the families who live here.&quot; As of that school year, 80% of Irving students originated from outside of the school&#x27;s attendance zone, and according to Lutton it was &quot;a neighborhood school in name only.&quot;

Moses Montefiore Academy, a CPS special school for at-risk youth, was located in the Near West Side.

<text>Young Lives vs Cancer, the operating name for &quot;CLIC Sargent&quot;, is a charity in the United Kingdom formed in 2005. Young Lives vs Cancer is the 12th largest cancer charity in the UK with a focus on children, young people and their families. Its care teams provide specialist support across the UK.

Young Lives vs Cancer supports people from diagnosis onwards and aims to help the whole family deal with the impact of cancer and its treatment, life after treatment and, in some cases, bereavement.

The charity also undertakes research into the impact of cancer on children and young people. It uses this evidence to raise awareness and to seek to influence government and policy-makers, and those who provide public services across the UK.

==History==
CLIC Sargent was formed in 2005 after a successful merger between Cancer and Leukaemia in Childhood (CLIC) and Sargent Cancer Care for Children. Sargent was set up in 1967 in memory of conductor Sir Malcolm Sargent who died of cancer.

The charity began operating under a new name - &quot;Young Lives vs Cancer&quot; - in May 2021, the tagline already in use by the charity.

== Chief executive ==
Young Lives vs Cancer&#x27;s chief executive is Rachel Kirby-Rider, who took over from Kate Lee in March 2020. Rachel Kirby-Rider had previously worked for the organisation as the Director of Income and Engagement for 5 years before being appointed.

== Awareness and fundraising ==
Young Lives vs Cancer&#x27;s main fundraising and awareness event is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month in September. People also fundraise through runs, cycles and other events.

<text>Puxi (, &quot;Phu上-shi平&quot;, &quot;Huangpu West Bank&quot;) is the historic center of Shanghai, China, and remains the home of approximately 48% of Shanghai&#x27;s residents in an area of 288 km2. &quot;Puxi&quot; is distinguished from &quot;Pudong&quot; to its east, which is separated from it by the Huangpu River. Despite the growing importance of Pudong&#x27;s Lujiazui area, Puxi remains Shanghai&#x27;s cultural, residential and commercial center.

Administratively, Puxi consists of a number of districts including Yangpu, Hongkou, Putuo, Changning, Xuhui, Jing&#x27;an and Huangpu.

==Culture and entertainment==
Puxi is, along with Pudong, the entertainment and cultural center of Shanghai.

Puxi has the most emblematic shopping centers and cultural centers. The main shopping centers (including East Nanjing Pedestrian Road, Central Huaihai Road, Qipu Road Apparel City, and Xujiahui), the major bar streets (Hengshan, Maoming, and Julu Roads), the Shanghai Zoo and cultural centers such as The Bund, the Shanghai Grand Theatre, and the Shanghai Museum are all located in Puxi.

On the other hand, Pudong has the most emblematic parks and skyscrapers. For instance, the biggest park in all of Shanghai, the Century Park, is located in Pudong. Shanghai Disneyland Park is too located in Pudong. Pudong also has the tallest skyscrapers such as the Oriental Pearl Tower, the Shanghai World Financial Center and the Shanghai Tower (the tallest skyscraper in Shanghai).

==Corresponding Administrative Zones==

==Transportation==
Shanghai&#x27;s older airport, Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, is located in Puxi. All international flights, including regional flights to Hong Kong and Macao, were moved to Shanghai Pudong International Airport when the latter opened in 1999. From October 2007, a limited number of international flights will commence from Hongqiao.

Almost all lines on the Shanghai Metro (with the exceptions of Lines 5 and 6) pass by Puxi.

Pudong and Puxi are connected by several tunnels, four major bridges, and Lines 2, 4, 7, 8 and 9 on the Shanghai Metro.

The Shanghai railway station and Shanghai South railway station are also located in Puxi.

<text>The 101st Grenadiers was a regiment of the British Indian Army.

==1778–1878==
The regiment was formed in 1778 after six grenadier companies (two companies each from the three battalions of the Bombay Army) were combined to form a composite battalion. During the First Mahratta War, the grenadier companies fought against the Mahratta Empire and was engaged in the Battle of Talegoan. In recognition of its conduct, the unit became a permanent unit, titled the 8th Regiment of Bombay Sepoys.

In 1783 the regiment&#x27;s title was amended to become the 8th Grenadier Regiment of Bombay Sepoys, known informally as the Bombay Grenadiers. The regiment thus gained the claim to be the oldest grenadier regiment in the British Empire; the British Army&#x27;s Grenadier Guards did not gain its Grenadier title until after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

Meanwhile, the Regiment took part in the numerous Mysore Wars. In 1783, the regiment formed part of the Mangalore garrison, which the Tipu Sultan&#x27;s Mysore Army besieged. The garrison held out for nine months before negotiating a settlement which permitted it safe passage back to British territory. Its actions earned the regiment the battle honour &quot;Mangalore&quot;. The regiment later gained the White Horse of Hanover, emblem of the Royal House of Hanover, as its cap badge. The regiment&#x27;s second battle honour, &quot;Mysore&quot; for its involvement in the last of the Mysore wars, between 1789 and 1792.

The regiment raised a 2nd Battalion in 1793 and became the 1st Grenadier Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry. The 2nd Battalion would, in 1824, be separated from the 1st Grenadiers to become the 2nd Grenadier Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry (later the 102nd King Edward&#x27;s Own Grenadiers). The regiment helped to besiege the fort of Bharatpur from December 1825 to its capture on 18 January 1826. In 1843, the 1st Grenadiers served in the Scinde War, being engaged at Hyderabad in March. The war&#x27;s conclusion brought about the annexation of Scinde. The regiment was extensively employed during the First Anglo-Sikh War and was present at the decisive Battle of Sobraon in February 1846.

==The Second Afghan War==
After the outbreak of the Second Afghan War, the Bombay Grenadiers found itself initially employed initially in the vicinity of the Bolan Pass. It was not until March 1880 that the battalion, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Horace Anderson, entered Afghanistan as an element of a British-Indian column intent on quelling a revolt by Ayub Khan, the ruler of Herat, who sought to depose the British-backed Amir of Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman Khan. At the Battle of Maiwand, on 27 July 1880, the Bombay Grenadiers and its column, under Brigadier George Burrows were attacked by an Afghan force of up to 25,000 men.

The British began the battle with an artillery barrage that the Afghans responded to via their own artillery at about 11:20 am; the Grenadiers were on the left flank of the British-Indian force and were in an exposed position that saw them take the brunt of the Afghan barrage, sustaining significant casualties. Shortly after noon, the Afghan infantry began the attack and the Grenadiers were heavily involved in the attempts to repulse the constant attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the Afghans. At about 1:00 pm the &quot;Grenadiers&quot; confronted a large group of Afghans and at about 2:30 pm two companies of Jacob&#x27;s Rifles, who had been positioned to the left of the Grenadiers, were attacked; they eventually wavered in the face of such an overwhelming force, straight into the ranks of the Grenadiers. The battery of the Royal Horse Artillery subsequently withdrew and the Grenadiers, as well as the rest of the Indian forces, fled towards the 66th Foot, the sole British infantry regiment present. The column&#x27;s cavalry attempted to restore some stability to the situation but to no avail. Parts of the Grenadiers and Jacob&#x27;s Rifles withdrew to Mahmudabad while the 66th Foot and the rest of the Grenadiers withdrew towards Khig; there, the 66th made a gallant last stand in a garden, fighting to the last man.

The battle had been a devastating defeat for the British-Indian forces: over 1,100 casualties had been sustained, but they had inflicted over 7,000 casualties upon the Afghan forces. The Grenadiers commanding officer (CO) was severely wounded during the battle and his life was saved by Risaldar Dhonkhul Singh of the 3rd Bombay Light Cavalry. The British-Indian survivors eventually made it back to British-held Kandahar. The city was soon besieged by Afghan rebels until a relief force, led by Major-General Roberts, arrived from the capital city, Kabul, on 31 August.

==Third Burmese War==
In 1885 the Regiment took part in the Third Burmese War – the last war between the British and Burma. The war saw Upper Burma annexed and the end of Burmese independence. The Regiment gained its last Theatre Honour of the 19th Century for its involvement in the war, &quot;Burma 1885–87&quot;.

==20th century==
In 1901 the Regiment deployed to the British territory of Aden (now part of the Yemen), also having its name changed to the 1st Grenadier Bombay Infantry. In 1903 the Regiment was renumbered to become the 101st Grenadiers. Elements of the Regiment saw service during operations in 1902–05 to quell an uprising by Dervishes, led by their sultan Diiriye Guure. During operations in Somaliland, Captain George Murray Rolland won the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions at Daratoleh on 22 April 1903. The operations against the &#x27;Mad Mullah&#x27; did not conclude until 1905 with the signing of a peace agreement—the Mullah gained some territory in Italian Somaliland. The Mullah reneged on this agreement when he resumed hostilities against the British in 1907, and would continue to do so until 1920.

==First World War==
The First World War began in August 1914, a war that pitted the British Empire, France and their Allies against Germany and its allies. During the conflict, the Regiment saw service in Africa and the Middle East. The 101st raised a 2nd Battalion in 1917 which saw service in Egypt; it was disbanded in 1921.

The Regiment took part in operations in German East Africa from the beginning of the campaign there in November 1914. There, the British encountered a formidable opponent in the form of Paul Erich von Lettow-Vorbeck. The 101st took part in the initial landings and the Battle of Tanga. This was a German victory, that saw the British and Indian forces, including the 101st, sustain significant casualties that compelled them to retreat back to their ships. The 101st had however shown stubborn resistance when other units broke.

In January 1915, a company of the 101st took part in the Battle of Jassin that saw both sides sustain heavy casualties which compelled von Lettow-Vorbeck to avoid pitched battles with the British forces. Due to this defeat, the British garrison in Jassin surrendered, after no relief force had arrived, with nearly 300 British and Indians troops taken prisoner, including the company of the 101st, but were subsequently released on parole with the pledge that they would have no further participation in the war.

One company of the Regiment acted with the 5th Light Infantry in another attempt to capture Tanga in July 1916. The port—which had, for the most part, been abandoned—was, indeed, successfully captured. Some of von Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s forces had remained to snipe at the Indian forces; these snipers proved to be quite a deadly nuisance that required intense patrolling to remove the threat. For the &quot;Regiment&#x27;s&quot; involvement in the campaign it was awarded the Theatre Honour &quot;East Africa 1914–16&quot;.

The 101st later saw service in the Middle East in the Palestine theatre – this theatre was the second largest, in terms of troop numbers, after the Western Front. Their opposition was the Ottoman Empire that controlled Palestine, and was an ally of Germany. The Regiment took part in the attempts to capture the important port of Gaza and by the end of December 1917 the Allies were in control of much of Palestine, including the symbolic capture of Jerusalem. In July 1918 the &quot;Regiment&quot; took part in the Ghurabeh raid that saw intense fighting and over 100 Ottomans taken prisoner. The Regiment later took part in the Megiddo Offensive – the World War I equivalent of the German Blitzkrieg during World War II – and took part in the attempts to capture Nablus. The Ottomans signed an Armistice with the Allies on 30 October. The First World War finally ended on 11 November 1918 with the signing of the Armistice between the Allies and Germany.

==Post-War==
Soon after the war, the regiment deployed to British Somaliland, where operations against Hassan and his followers had resumed. The campaign, which encompassed the army, Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force, succeeded in defeating Hassan in 1920, after two decades of conflict.

In accordance with the Indian Army reforms of 1922, the 101st amalgamated with five other regiments to form six battalions of the 4th Bombay Grenadiers; the 101st became the 1st Battalion of the new regiment. The battalion had the distinction of being allowed to have its own cap badge. After Indian gained independence in 1947, the 4th Grenadiers were allocated to the Indian Army and retitled The Grenadiers. The Battalion which had once been the 101st transferred to the Brigade of the Guards in 1952, becoming its 2nd Battalion (2 Guards).

<doc id="1325983" wikidata="Q3413774" url="?curid=1325983" title="String Quartet No. 15 (Schubert)">
<text>The String Quartet No. 15 in [[G major]], D. 887, was the last quartet written by Franz Schubert in June 1826. It was posthumously published in 1851, as Op. 161. The work focuses on lyrical ideas and explores far-reaching major and minor modes, which was uncommon to this degree in his compositions. Schubert reinforced this with a range of dynamic contrast and use of texture and pizzicato. The structural form of the movements in this quartet are somewhat ambiguous due to Schubert&#x27;s focus on lyricism rather than traditional harmonic structure.

==Analysis==

The four movements of the quartet are:

# Allegro molto moderato (G major)
# Andante un poco moto (E minor)
# Scherzo. Allegro vivace – Trio. Allegretto (B minor)
# Allegro assai (G major)

The length of performance of the quartet is about 50 minutes, if all repeats are observed. 

===I. Allegro molto moderato===

The first movement is based around a motive of chromatic descending fourths within alternating major and minor modes. The main lyrical theme of the movement which begins with a sixteenth note pickup to a dotted eighth note will be heard in many variations throughout the rest of the movements of the quartet. The first movement features extensive tremolo, which also leads into the repeat of the exposition. While many composers deconstruct a theme to smaller and smaller parts, Schubert is known for his lyricism and instead continually expands the theme.

This may include the use of a motive in triplets to connect the first and second main groups of this sonata form; the second group opens, exactly as happens in the later-written String Quintet and similar to the technique in some works by Beethoven — not in the dominant key but with a quiet theme in the mediant, B-flat, with rhythm not quite the same as that of the lyrical theme that slowed matters down early on (bar fourteen, again), and adding to the texture with pizzicato accompaniment. There is a triplet-dominated, agitated transition and the same theme is heard, now in D, with triplet accompaniments; the triplets, not the theme, continue to the end of the exposition, and descend gradually from D down to G major for the repeat, or for the second ending and the beginning of the development, where continuity means the continued rustling of quiet strings, building for a bit by exchanging with more energetic passages, then bringing in faster versions of the dotted rhythms of the main themes. The climax of the development leads to a particularly quiet recapitulation, much varied at its opening from what we had heard originally. In the coda the opening of the quartet, both its rhythm and its major/minor exchanges, get a further chance to play themselves out.

There is a remarkably innovative harmonic passage in the first movement. Between mm. 414 and 429 Schubert prolongs G major with an equal subdivision of the octave using major thirds. Passing seventh chords in the bass provide a smooth linear progression connecting these major thirds, the result of which is a whole tone descent in the bass-voice, in this case the cello. The following major third prolongations occur: G(mm. 414-416) E-flat (mm. 417-418) B(mm. 419-420) G(mm. 421-422) E-flat(423-426). In measure 426 Schubert enharmonically reinterprets this dominant-seventh structure, resolving it as a German augmented 6th, thus proceeding bVI-V-I in mm. 427-429.

===II. Andante un poco moto===

The dramatic slow movement contains much in the way of a march rhythm and sudden upward violin glissandos followed by drops to the lowest string, and again much use of tremolo. This movement utilizes dramatic variations of ideas between subsequent episodes. The first episode containing a harmonically static solo in the cello accompanied by pizzicato. It abruptly shifts to a fortissimo episode in m. 43 reinforced by way of unisons in rhythms and octaves. This dramatic return of the theme from the first idyllic one is unlike the resolution of the theme in the first movement.

=== III. Scherzo. Allegro vivace – Trio. Allegretto ===
The scherzo is light-textured, fleet for much of its span, foreshadowing those of Mendelssohn. The trio is a mild accompanied duet, first between cello and first violin, then first violin and viola, then again cello and first violin. The trio&#x27;s theme played by the cello is a reiteration of the second movement theme, also played by the cello. The third movement can be seen as a replication in form from the preceding movement. Here the scherzo and trio trade themes and in the second movement the theme and episodes similarly trade themes.

===IV. Allegro assai===

The finale continues the ambiguous form of the preceding movements in an extended movement where it is unclear if the movement is in sonata or rondo, G major or G minor. The opening theme has more rapid extremes in its exchanges between major and minor modes than that of the first movement. The rhythms are reminiscent of a tarantella, as with that of the previous quartet — which the movement resembles in some capricious qualities.

The quartet was first published no later than 1852, by Diabelli of Vienna.

==Cultural legacy==
In Woody Allen&#x27;s 1989 comedy-drama &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;, parts of the Allegro molto moderato (including the dotted rhythm of the opening) are used as a dramatic measure during several scenes that form central parts of the &#x27;crimes&#x27; plot.

In &quot;Gramophone&quot;, Stephen Johnson referred to the work as Schubert&#x27;s greatest string quartet, and speculated that it is heard less frequently than the composer&#x27;s previous two quartets not because of lower quality but because it is less accessible.

<doc id="1325989" wikidata="Q2340921" url="?curid=1325989" title="Paul Baloff">
<text>Pavel Nicholas &quot;Paul&quot; Baloff (born Pavel Nikolayevitch Balchishkov, , April 25, 1960 – February 2, 2002) was an American singer, best known as the original lead vocalist of the thrash metal band Exodus. He was fired from Exodus shortly after the release of the band&#x27;s 1985 debut album &quot;Bonded by Blood&quot;, and sang with various other bands before rejoining Exodus in 1997. Baloff died of a stroke in 2002. He was of Russian descent.

==Biography==
===Formation of Exodus (1981–1983)===
Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett and Baloff met at a North Berkeley house party in 1981 and became fast friends due to their shared admiration for punk rock and the new wave of British heavy metal. Baloff joined Exodus in 1982 as lead vocalist to complete the lineup, which included Hammett, guitarist Gary Holt, drummer Tom Hunting and bassist Geoff Andrews.

===Bonded by Blood and firing (1984–1991)===
Exodus recorded their first album &quot;Bonded by Blood&quot; in the summer of 1984. Audio engineering college student Mark Whitaker, who had attended high school with Baloff, oversaw management and record production for the band at the time. 1984 concert photos from Exodus shows at Aquatic Park&#x27;s Eastern Front Metal Festival (with Slayer and Suicidal Tendencies) and Ruthie&#x27;s Inn (with Megadeth and Slayer) were included on the album sleeve inserts. Originally titled &quot;A Lesson in Violence&quot;, the album was not released until April 1985 amidst creative and business setbacks.

Shortly after touring for Bonded by Blood, Baloff was fired from the band for &quot;personal and musical differences&quot;, although he still had writer credits on their next album, &quot;Pleasures of the Flesh&quot;. He was replaced by Steve &quot;Zetro&quot; Souza, who had previously been the lead vocalist for Legacy, an early incarnation of Testament. Baloff went on to form the band Piranha. He sang in several bands in the San Francisco Bay area including Piranha, Hirax, and Heathen.

===Return to Exodus (1991–2000)===
After a few dormant years of Exodus&#x27; extended hiatus, Baloff briefly reunited with Holt and Hunolt to reform Exodus in 1997. They released a live album titled &quot;Another Lesson in Violence&quot;. The group disbanded again shortly after, in part due to a falling out with record label Century Media over the way the live album was promoted, and over an aborted attempt at a live concert video that was filmed but never released due to a financial dispute.

===Exodus&#x27; second reformation and death (2001–2002)===
In 2001, Exodus reformed once again. There was talk of recording a new studio album and the band continued to play local shows in and around the San Francisco Bay Area.

In February 2002, Baloff had a stroke that left him in a coma, and he died after being removed from life support. He was 41 years old. Former vocalist Steve Souza was recruited back into the band to finish the rest of their concert commitments. Although it appeared to outsiders that with Baloff&#x27;s death, Exodus would cease to exist, guitarist Gary Holt was determined to release a new studio record. The result was 2004&#x27;s &quot;Tempo of the Damned&quot;, which is dedicated to Baloff&#x27;s memory.

==Legacy==
In October 2008, Exodus released a re-recording of their 1985 debut album &quot;Bonded by Blood&quot; entitled &quot;Let There Be Blood&quot;. Gary Holt released the following statement about the band&#x27;s decision to revisit their debut album: &quot;After many years in the planning and discussion stage, we have finally completed the re-recording of &#x27;Bonded By Blood&#x27;. We have decided to call it &#x27;Let There Be Blood&#x27; and it is our way of paying homage to [late singer] Paul Baloff by showing how relevant these songs we had written together still are. We aren&#x27;t trying to replace the original; that&#x27;s impossible anyway. We are just giving these songs the benefit of modern production. It&#x27;s something we talked about before Paul&#x27;s death and it&#x27;s always been important to us to do. We were super excited about entering the studio once again to record these classics, and now it&#x27;s back to writing the next studio record!&quot;

On February 4, 2012, a Paul Baloff Memorial Reunion Concert was held at the Oakland Metro Opera House. Former and current members included Kirk Hammett, Rick Hunolt, Gary Holt, Geoff Andrews, Lee Altus, Rob Dukes, Tom Hunting and Jack Gibson. It was the first time they have all played together since 1983.

<doc id="1325994" wikidata="Q1457205" url="?curid=1325994" title="Softdisk">
<text>[[Softdisk]] was a software and Internet company based in Shreveport, Louisiana. Founded in 1981, its original products were disk magazines (which they termed &quot;magazettes&quot;, for &quot;magazine on diskette&quot;). It was affiliated and partly owned by paper magazine &quot;Softalk&quot; at founding, but survived its demise.

The company has been known by a variety of names, including &quot;Softdisk Magazette&quot;, &quot;Softdisk Publishing&quot;, &quot;Softdisk, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Softdisk Internet Services&quot;, &quot;Softdisk, L.L.C.&quot;, and &quot;Magazines On Disk&quot;.

Softdisk is most well known for being the former workplace of several of the founders of id Software.

==Publications==

Publications included &quot;Softdisk&quot; for the Apple II; &quot;Loadstar&quot; for the Commodore 64; &quot;Big Blue Disk&quot; (later &quot;On Disk Monthly&quot; and &quot;Softdisk PC&quot;), &quot;The Gamer’s Edge&quot;, and &quot;PC Business Disk&quot; for the IBM PC; &quot;Diskworld&quot; (later &quot;Softdisk for Mac&quot;) and &quot;DTPublisher&quot; (specializing in desktop publishing) for the Apple Macintosh; &quot;Softdisk G-S&quot; for the Apple IIGS; &quot;Softdisk for Windows&quot; for Microsoft Windows, published from 1994–1999; and &quot;Shareware Spotlight&quot;, a short-lived publication featuring the best Shareware offerings for IBM PC compatibles. By the late 1990s, these publications were discontinued, although &quot;Loadstar&quot; had a continued life as an independent company catering to a cult following of Commodore buffs.

===&quot;Big Blue Disk&quot;===
&quot;Big Blue Disk&quot; was a monthly disk magazine that was published by Softdisk for IBM PC and compatibles that began publication in 1986. It required 256k of memory. Softdisk was sued by IBM for trademark infringement over the use of the name &quot;Big Blue&quot; in 1989.

==Standalone programs and Gamer&#x27;s Edge==
Softdisk is most famous for being the former workplace of several of the founders of id Software, who worked on a short-lived game subscription product, &quot;Gamer&#x27;s Edge&quot;. &quot;Gamer&#x27;s Edge&quot; was a monthly PC game disk started in 1990 by John Romero. The disk&#x27;s developers were John Carmack, John Romero, and Adrian Carmack. Tom Hall, then a programmer who worked in the Apple II department of Softdisk, would come in at night to help with the game design. Lane Roathe was the editor.

These developers later left Softdisk to found id Software. To complete their contractual obligation to Softdisk, the developers built several more games for Softdisk, including &quot;Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion&quot;, &quot;Rescue Rover&quot;, &quot;Hovertank 3D&quot;, &quot;Rescue Rover 2&quot;, &quot;Tiles of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;Catacomb 3D&quot; and &quot;Keen Dreams&quot; (the &quot;lost&quot; episode of the &quot;Commander Keen&quot; series). Softdisk later hired a new team to create new titles using the game engines of the earlier games, including the later founders of JAM Productions who created &quot;Blake Stone&quot;. This connection led to Softdisk being mentioned extensively in the earlier parts of the id chronicling book &quot;Masters of Doom&quot;.

Also, some of the earliest employees of Origin Systems worked there before moving on: Greg Malone (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Windwalker&quot;), Dallas Snell (&quot;The Quest&quot; and &quot;Ring Quest&quot;), Joel Rea (&quot;The Quest&quot; and &quot;Ring Quest&quot;), and Alan Gardner (&quot;Windwalker&quot;, &quot;Ultima VI&quot;). Malone also later worked as a producer for 3D Realms.

Softdisk continued to publish video games into the mid-1990s, most notably &quot;In Pursuit of Greed&quot;, based on an alpha version of the Doom engine derived from &quot;Shadowcaster&quot;, and &quot;Alien Rampage&quot;, based on the original &quot;Ravager&quot; side-scroller once being developed by Apogee.

==Current state==
Since 1995, Softdisk had been an Internet service provider, web hosting service, and Internet developer as well, and this eventually became their primary area of business. They offered local dialup service in the Shreveport area, and Web hosting and development services.

As of 2006, their website redirected to that of Bayou Internet, which had taken over their Internet operations. The downloadstore.com site formerly owned and operated by Softdisk was later run by Flat Rock Software, which also published former Softdisk product Screen Saver Studio and most of the Gamer&#x27;s Edge titles (as well as on GOG.com). The source code for &quot;Catacomb&quot;, &quot;Catacomb 3D&quot; and &quot;Hovertank 3D&quot; was released by Flat Rock in June 2014 under the GNU General Public License in a manner similar to those done by id and partners.

<doc id="1326001" wikidata="Q3135364" url="?curid=1326001" title="High Cross, Leicestershire">
<text>High Cross is the name given to the crossroads of the Roman roads of Watling Street (now the A5) and Fosse Way on the border between Leicestershire and Warwickshire, England. A naturally strategic high point, High Cross was &quot;the central cross roads&quot; of Anglo-Saxon and Roman Britain. It was the site of a Romano-British settlement known as Venonae or Venonis, with an accompanying fort.

High Cross has marked several frontiers through history. In the Iron Age the area is believed to have been the frontier between the Corieltauvi and Dobunni tribes. In the Roman era, the Fosse Way delimited Roman settlement in the early period of occupation. In the later Anglo-Saxon period, Watling Street was the border between the Viking controlled Danelaw and Saxon territory. Reflecting this, the boundaries of four parishes (boundaries which began to be established from the Anglo-Saxon period or even earlier) still meet today at High Cross, while the border between Leicester and Warwickshire, established in the early 11th century, reflects the Danelaw boundary.

==Location==
High Cross is located eight miles from the point (at Lindley Hall Farm in Fenny Drayton) today identified by the Ordnance Survey as the geographical centre of England. High Cross is the midpoint on the main watershed of England: it is situated above three river valleys. The Avon flows southwest to the Severn Estuary and the Irish sea at Bristol; the Anker flows West; and the Soar flows North. Both the Soar and the Anker, via the Trent and then the Humber, flow ultimately to the North Sea at Kingston on Hull.

As denoted by its name, High Cross is at the top of a hill. An account of the site in a popular magazine of 1827 claimed that, &quot;The ground here is so high, and the surrounding country so low and flat, that it is said, fifty-seven churches may be seen from this spot by the help of a glass [telescope].&quot; This extensive area of relatively flat land is, on the Warwickshire side, between Rugby and Bedworth/ Nuneaton, referred to by geographers as the &quot;High Cross Plateau.&quot;

==Roman Era: Venonae==

While the exact point of the Roman Fosse Way and Watling Street junction is unknown, historians agree to its location around the current meeting point of the two roads, High Cross. The Roman name &quot;Venonae&quot; (also sometimes &quot;Venonis&quot; or &quot;Venoni&quot;) is known from the Antonine Itinerary, a contemporary register of the stations and distances along various Roman roads likely produced at the end of the third century. The etymology of the name Venonae is uncertain. 

Venonae may have been the meeting point for Roman regiments in their final battle against Boudica, sometimes called &#x27;The Battle of Watling Street&#x27; which would have been fought nearby.

===The Roman Settlement===
The first Roman structure at High Cross was a fort, located about 1km to the North West from the current High Cross, dating to the first few years of the Roman occupation (AD 44-47). This was in the period when the Fosse Way represented the limits (if not a formal frontier) of Roman colonisation. The fort predated the Roman construction of Watling Street in the 60sAD, which built over some of the structures of the fort. The fort had two entrances on the North West and south-east sides with a timber gateway on the South East. There was a turf rampart, 3 meters wide and V-shaped ditch. &quot;Internal features located were the cobbled intervallum-street [a perimeter street that ran around the ramparts], part of a barrack-building, and a water-tank near the east angle&quot;. The fort was discovered in the late 1960s from the air by the pioneer of aerial archaeology, Kenneth St Joseph.

A settlement around the current High Cross site evolved somewhat later than the fort with evidence showing &quot;continuous Romano-British occupation from the late-first to the fourth centuries A.D.&quot; Historians of the seventeen and eighteenth century reported very extensive, visible Roman ruins around High Cross, leading to belief that Venonae was a major Roman settlement. However, modern archaeology, undertaken since the start of the 20th century, has found more limited evidence. Historians today usually describes Venonae as a &quot;small town.&quot; A 2004 map of the Roman settlement based on the archaeological fieldwork shows - as well as the fort - two enclosures and fortifications in the immediate area around the crossroads and remains of a villa 450 metres due east of the crossroad. 

==Eighteenth century monument==

A stone monunent at High Cross was built in 1712. Funded by the local landowner, the Earl of Denbigh, it celebrated the victories against France by the Duke of Marlborough as well as marking the centre of Roman Britain. It consisted of four Doric columns with an orb and cross above. It was struck by lightning in 1791 and only the plinth remains today. The stone monument was preceded by a wooden cross and was the site of a medieval gibbet.

The two Latin inscriptions on either side the monument have been translated as:

==High Cross today==
In modern times, this section of Watling Street is now a dual carriageway section of the A5, the southern part of the Fosse Way is a B road, and the northern route of the Fosse is now a track which is a part of a long-distance path called the Leicestershire Round.

Four civil parish boundaries meet at High Cross: the Warwickshire parishes of Wibtoft and Copston Magna (historically part of Monks Kirby parish) and the Leicestershire parishes of Sharnford and Claybrooke Parva (historically part of the single Claybrooke parish with the closely adjacent village of Claybrooke Magna).

High Cross is depicted on the coat of arms of Blaby District Council, which is the local authority for the area. Two black diagonal lines on the shield represent Fosse Way and Watling Street.

<text>Arthur John Shawcross (June 6, 1945 – November 10, 2008), also known as The Genesee River Killer, was an American serial killer active in Rochester, New York from 1972 through 1989. Shawcross&#x27;s first known murders took place in his hometown of Watertown, New York, where he killed a young boy and a girl. Under the terms of a plea bargain, he was allowed to plead guilty to one charge of manslaughter, for which he served 14 years of a 25-year sentence.

Shawcross killed most of his victims in 1988 and 1989 after being granted an early parole, which later led to controversy. A food service worker, Shawcross trawled the streets of Rochester in his girlfriend&#x27;s 1984 Dodge Omni (later using her 1987 Chevrolet Celebrity), looking for prostitutes to kill. Shawcross died on 10 November 2008, while serving a prison sentence of 250 years for his crimes, at the age of 63. Dr. Michael H. Stone, professor of psychiatry at Columbia University and an authority on violent behavior, identified Shawcross as &quot;one of the most egregious examples of the unwarranted release of a prisoner&quot; in his book &quot;The Anatomy of Evil&quot;.

==Early life==
Arthur John Shawcross was born in Kittery, Maine, the first of four children of Arthur Roy Shawcross and Elizabeth &quot;Bessie&quot; (&quot;Betty&quot;) Yerakes Shawcross. His family moved to Watertown, New York, when he was young.

Shawcross said throughout his childhood, he was a frequent bed-wetter (which is one part of the Macdonald triad). He later claimed his mother performed oral sex on him for several years starting when he was aged 7, and that during junior high school he had sexual relations with his sister. Shawcross had a reputation at school as a bully and would frequently act out violently. He dropped out of high school in 1960.

In April 1967, at age 21, Shawcross was drafted into the United States Army. At this time, he divorced his first wife and gave up his rights to their 18-month-old son, whom he never saw again. He served one tour of duty with the 4th Supply and Transport Company of the 4th Infantry Division in Vietnam. He later boasted of grotesque combat exploits, such as &quot;beheading mama-sans and nailing their heads to trees as a warning to the Vietcong&quot; and engaging in cannibalism; in reality, he never served in a combat position.

After the war, Shawcross was stationed at Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma, as an armorer. His second wife Linda experienced several aspects of his disturbing behavior, especially his penchant for starting fires; an Army psychiatrist told her that Shawcross derived sexual arousal from setting fires, another part of the triad.

==Return to New York==
After his discharge from the Army, Shawcross moved with Linda from Oklahoma to Clayton, New York. Linda would soon divorce him, after which he began committing crimes such as arson and burglary. Shawcross&#x27;s offenses earned him a five-year sentence at Attica Correctional Facility, and later Auburn Correctional Facility. After serving 22 months, he was granted an early release in October 1971, in part due to his role in the rescue of a correctional officer during a prison riot. Shawcross returned to his hometown of Watertown, New York, eventually getting a job with the Watertown Public Works Department and marrying for the third time.

On May 7, 1972, he raped and killed his first known victim, 10-year-old Jack Owen Blake, after luring the boy into a wooded area in Watertown. Blake&#x27;s body was not found until authorities received a tip by telephone on September 5. On September 2, just prior to the body&#x27;s discovery, Shawcross raped and killed eight-year-old Karen Ann Hill, who had been visiting Watertown with her mother for the Labor Day weekend. He was arrested the next day.

A grand jury indicted Shawcross for murder in Hill&#x27;s death. On October 17, 1972, he was allowed to plead guilty to a lesser charge of first degree manslaughter for both deaths and was sentenced to an indeterminate term with a maximum of 25 years at Attica Correctional Facility. In November he was transferred to Green Haven Correctional Facility.

Jefferson County District Attorney William McClusky explained the plea bargain by stating that other than Shawcross&#x27;s confession to police, there was no direct evidence linking him to the Blake killing. McClusky also suggested Shawcross could have argued at trial that he was under &quot;extreme emotional disturbance,&quot; and a jury would have been likely to arrive at a verdict of manslaughter.

After Shawcross was in prison for fourteen years, inexperienced prison staff and social workers concluded that Shawcross was &quot;no longer dangerous&quot;, disregarding the warnings of psychiatrists who had assessed Shawcross as a &quot;schizoid psychopath.&quot; He was released on parole in April 1987.

Shawcross had difficulty settling down, as neighbors would protest his presence and employers would refuse to hire him. He first moved to Binghamton, New York, then relocated to Delhi with a girlfriend, Rose Marie Walley. When Delhi residents became aware of Shawcross&#x27; presence, the couple moved to nearby Fleischmanns, only to be met with hostility there as well. In late June 1987, Shawcross&#x27; parole officer moved him and Walley into a transient hotel in Rochester, but failed to notify local authorities of this action. In mid-October, Shawcross and Walley found more permanent lodgings at 241 Alexander Street in Rochester.

==Second series of murders==
In March 1988, Shawcross began murdering again, primarily targeting prostitutes in the Rochester area, before his capture less than two years later. He was convicted of eleven murders, with a twelfth not officially ascribed to him. The victims were:


All the victims were murdered in Monroe County except for Gibson, who was killed in neighboring Wayne County. Retired detective Robert Keppel has argued that the detectives investigating the case over-relied on the concept of &quot;modus operandi&quot;, at times searching for multiple suspects due to small differences in the profiles of each victim.

On January 5, 1990, two days after June Cicero&#x27;s body was discovered by aerial surveillance, police arrested Shawcross. He had been spotted by an eyewitness and a police surveillance team standing near his car, apparently masturbating on a bridge over Salmon Creek near where Cicero&#x27;s body had been dumped.

==Trial and conviction==
In November 1990, Shawcross was tried by Monroe County First Assistant District Attorney Charles J. Siragusa for the ten murders in Monroe County. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, with testimony from forensic psychiatrist Dorothy Lewis that he had brain damage, multiple personality disorder (now known as dissociative identity disorder) and post-traumatic stress disorder, and had been sexually abused as a child. Lewis also claimed that Shawcross moved into a separate internal personality named &quot;Bessie&quot; when he killed, arguing for him to be institutionalized rather than being returned to the prisons system.

In response to the defense&#x27;s claim that Shawcross&#x27;s actions were the product of post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his war service, FBI criminal profiler Robert K. Ressler reviewed the claim on behalf of the prosecution before the trial. Ressler wrote that &quot;[Shawcross&#x27;s] claim of having witnessed wartime atrocities was patently outrageous and untrue.&quot; Prosecution psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz testified that Shawcross had antisocial personality disorder. It was later determined that Shawcross had a cyst pressing on the temporal lobe of his brain, as well as scarring on his frontal lobes areas that are responsible for decision-making and self-control.

==Imprisonment==

Shawcross was incarcerated at the Sullivan Correctional Facility in Fallsburg, New York, where he was held until his death.

In 2003, Shawcross was interviewed by British reporter Katherine English for a documentary on cannibalism. He bragged about slicing out and eating the vulvae of three victims, but refused to discuss his earlier claim of eating the genitals of his first victim, Jack Blake.

==Death==
Officials said 63-year old Shawcross complained of a pain in his leg on the afternoon of November 10, 2008. He was taken to Albany Medical Center where he went into cardiac arrest, and died shortly thereafter. He was pronounced dead at 9:50 p.m.

<text>Donald Eugene Conley (November 10, 1930 – July 4, 2017) was an American professional baseball and basketball player. He pitched for four teams in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1952 to 1963. Conley also played as a forward in the 1952–53 season and from 1958 to 1964 for two teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is the 2nd person (Otto Graham) to win championships in two of the four major American sports: one with the Milwaukee Braves in the 1957 World Series and three with the Boston Celtics from 1959 to 1961.

== Early life ==
Conley was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma. While still young, his family moved to Richland, Washington. He attended Richland High School, where he played multiple sports. He reached the all-state team in baseball and basketball and was the state champion in the high jump.

Conley attended Washington State University, where (as he told &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in 2004) students &quot;kidnapped&quot; him during a recruiting visit in an effort to convince him to matriculate. In 1950 he played on the Cougar team that reached the College World Series. In basketball, Conley was twice selected honorable mention to the All-America team, leading the team in scoring with 20 points per game. He was a first-team All-PCC selection in 1950.

During the summer, Conley pitched semiprofessional baseball in Walla Walla, Washington, in which scouts from almost every Major League Baseball team came to recruit him. He also was getting contract offers to play professional basketball from the Minneapolis Lakers and the Tri-Cities Blackhawks. At first he declined the offers, saying that his family didn&#x27;t want him to sign any professional contracts until he finished school. But the offers were getting bigger, and in August 1950 he signed a professional contract with the Boston Braves for a $3,000 bonus.

== Minor league career ==
Conley attended spring training in 1951 and was assigned to Hartford of the Eastern League by the request of former Braves star Tommy Holmes, who was managing the club. After a month, Conley had a record of five wins and only one loss and was praised by observers in the league, saying that he had the best fastball since former pitcher Van Lingle Mungo played in the league in 1933. On June 10, he threw a one-hitter against Schenectady Blue Jays, giving up the lone hit in the seventh inning. Holmes was promoted to manager of the Braves on June 25, and was replaced by future Baseball Hall of Famer Travis Jackson.

By August 1, Conley had a record of 16 wins with only three losses, leading the league. He was unanimously selected to the Eastern League All-Star team on August 29. He received the Eastern League MVP award that season after he became the first player in Hartford history to win twenty games in a single season.

In the beginning of the 1952 season, Conley, along with fellow rookies George Crowe and Eddie Mathews, was invited to spring training with a chance of making the roster. Around that time, the United States Army was drafting for the Korean War. Many major and minor league players were selected to fight in the war, depleting team rosters. Conley was deferred because of his height (6&#x27;8&#x27;), which was above the Army maximum height for a soldier.

==Major league career==
Conley&#x27;s debut with the Boston Braves was April 17, 1952, versus the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Braves&#x27; third game of the regular season. Conley started and faced a lineup that included four future members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Roy Campanella, Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese and Duke Snider. In four innings, Conley gave up four runs on 11 hits and two walks, taking the loss as the Dodgers prevailed 8–2. Conley lost his next three starts through early May, ending the season with an 0–4 record and a 7.82 ERA.

Conley returned to the majors in 1954 with the Milwaukee Braves, going 14–9 in 28 games with a 2.82 ERA, making the National League All-Star team and finishing third in Rookie of the Year voting behind Wally Moon and Ernie Banks, with Conley&#x27;s Braves teammate Hank Aaron finishing fourth.

The following season in 1955, Conley was named to the All-Star game again, completing the season with an 11–7 record with a 4.16 ERA. Conley pitched for the Braves through 1959, compiling a record of 42–43 including an 0–6 record in his final season in Milwaukee.

In his lone postseason appearance in the 1957 World Series on Oct. 5 against the New York Yankees, Conley pitched innings in relief of starter Bob Buhl, surrendering a two-run home run to Mickey Mantle as the Yankees went on to win the game 12–3; but with the Braves winning the series in seven games.

In the spring of 1959 with the Celtics in a playoff push, Conley delayed reporting to spring training with the Milwaukee Braves, prompting the team to trade Conley on March 31 to the Phillies. Conley made his third and final All-Star game with the Phillies, going 12–7 with a 3.00 ERA, with his season ending on August 19 after he was hit by a pitch while batting, breaking his hand.

After new contract talks bogged down on December 15, 1960, the Phillies traded Conley to the Red Sox; when he debuted with the Red Sox on April 28 against the Washington Senators, Conley became the first athlete to play for three professional teams in the same city along with the Celtics and his short stint with the Boston Braves in 1952. In three seasons with the Red Sox through 1963, Conley had a 29–32 record, with the win total including the final start of his major league career on Sept. 21, 1963, going six innings against the Minnesota Twins in an 11–2 victory.

In 11 seasons pitching for the Braves, Phillies and Red Sox, Conley posted a 91–96 record with 888 strikeouts and a 3.82 ERA in 1588.2 innings.

Conley was an above average hitter for a pitcher, posting a .192 batting average (105-for-548) with 33 runs, 19 doubles, 5 home runs and 45 RBI in 276 games. Defensively, he was below average, recording a .944 fielding percentage, which was 14 points lower than the league average at his position.

Conley was the winning pitcher in the 1955 All-Star Game and was selected for the 1954 and 1959 games.

Conley was the last living player to have played for both the Boston Red Sox and Boston Braves.

== Professional basketball career ==
In the middle of his first season of professional baseball, Conley agreed to sign with the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the struggling American Basketball League (1925–55).

On April 26, 1952, the Boston Celtics selected Conley with the 90th pick of the NBA draft. Playing 39 games as a rookie in the 1952–53 NBA season, Conley averaged about 12 minutes a game for a Celtics team that went 45–26 in the regular season under Red Auerbach. Conley did not play in the Celtics&#x27; two playoff series that season, with the team losing 3–1 in the Eastern Division finals to the New York Knicks.

After a five-year hiatus to focus on baseball with the Milwaukee Braves, Conley returned to the Celtics for the 1958–59 season, again seeing limited usage at about 13 minutes a game for a team that swept the Minneapolis Lakers 4–0 in the NBA finals. Conley averaged 4.2 points and 5.4 rebounds during the regular season and 4.9 points and 6.8 boards in the playoffs. Conley would have his best year as a Celtic the following season, averaging nearly 19 minutes a game during the regular season to score 6.7 points while hauling in 8.3 rebounds on average over 71 games in the regular season. The Celtics repeated as NBA champions with a 4–3 finals win over the St. Louis Hawks, with Conley roughly duplicating his regular-season averages during the playoffs.

Conley would play on one more championship Celtics team during the 1960–61 season, culminating in a 4–1 defeat of the Hawks. Conley skipped the following NBA season while pitching for the Red Sox, then joined the New York Knicks where he averaged 9.0 points and 6.7 rebounds in 70 games during the 1962–63 season, before his minutes dropped precipitously the following year which was his last in the NBA.

In six seasons in the NBA, Conley averaged 5.9 points and 6.3 rebounds per game in 16.5 minutes of playing time. Conley&#x27;s No. 17 would subsequently be assigned to John Havlicek and then retired by the Celtics in recognition of Havlicek&#x27;s career.

&quot;When I look back, I don&#x27;t know how I did it, I really don&#x27;t&quot;, Conley was quoted saying in 2008 by the Los Angeles Times, on playing two professional sports in tandem. &quot;I think I was having so much fun that it kept me going. I can&#x27;t remember a teammate I didn&#x27;t enjoy.&quot;

When Abe Saperstein&#x27;s American Basketball League (1961–62) was born in 1961, Tuck Tape Company owner Paul Cohen purchased a franchise, gave it the Tapers name, and placed it in Washington, D.C.; the team played its games in the Washington Coliseum. Conley signed with the team. While with the Tapers, Conley often accompanied Cohen on sales calls for his company and gained industry experience.

Conley played in the Eastern Professional Basketball League (EPBL) for the Hartford Capitols and New Haven Elms from 1966 to 1969. He was selected to the All-EPBL Second Team in 1968. Conley served as head coach of the Elms during the 1968–69 season and the Capitols during the 1969–70 season; he accumulated an 0–8 record overall.

Conley is one of 13 athletes to have played in both the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball. The thirteen are: Danny Ainge, Frank Baumholtz, Hank Biasatti, Conley, Chuck Connors, Dave DeBusschere, Dick Groat, Steve Hamilton, Mark Hendrickson, Cotton Nash, Ron Reed, Dick Ricketts and Howie Schultz.

== Retirement ==
After his retirement from professional sports, Conley started working for a duct tape company in Boston, Massachusetts. After a year working there, the owner of the duct tape company died. Conley later founded his own paper company, Foxboro Paper Company, which he owned for 36 years until he retired from the business.

The Washington Sports Hall of Fame included Conley in its 1979 class of inductees.

Until December 2009, Conley lived in Clermont, Florida, where he played golf and watched the Orlando Magic play in his free time. He moved to his vacation home in Waterville Valley, New Hampshire, in 2010.

Conley died of congestive heart failure at his home in Foxborough, Massachusetts on July 4, 2017.

== Personal life ==
Conley&#x27;s mother was of Cherokee heritage and stood tall. Eugene was a citizen of the Cherokee Nation.

In the spring of 1951, Conley married Kathryn Dizney whom he met the previous fall. They had three children and seven grandchildren. In 2004, his wife released a biography of Conley called &quot;One of a Kind&quot; that chronicled his life in both baseball and basketball and related how his family dealt with his being gone for most of the year.

In the days following July 27, 1962, Conley made headlines after exiting a Red Sox team bus that was stuck in New York City traffic with teammate Pumpsie Green to find a restroom, with the bus driver subsequently driving away without the players on board. As Conley recollected the episode in a 2004 interview with the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;: &quot;So we got off and went in this bar, and when we came back out, Pumpsie said, &#x27;Hey, that bus is gone,&#x27; and I said, &#x27;We are, too!&#x27;&quot; Conley and Green checked into a hotel, with Green rejoining the team the next day in Washington, D.C., but Conley taking a hiatus during which he attracted media attention in attempting to fly to Jerusalem. As told by Conley, Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey fined him $1,500 with the promise he would refund the money at the end of the season if Conley rededicated himself to the team; Yawkey fulfilled the promise in September.

<text>Ziauddin Barani (‎; 1285–1358 CE) was an Indian political thinker of the Delhi Sultanate located in present-day Northern India during Muhammad bin Tughlaq and Firuz Shah&#x27;s reign. He was best known for composing the Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi (also called &quot;Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi&quot;), a work on medieval India, which covers the period from the reign of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq to the first six years of the reign of Firoz Shah Tughluq; and the &quot;Fatwa-i-Jahandari&quot; which promoted a hierarchy among Muslim communities in the Indian subcontinent, although according to M. Athar Ali it was not based on race or even like the caste system, but taking as a model of Sassanid Iran, which promoted an idea of aristocracy through birth and which was claimed by Persians to be &quot;fully in accordance with the main thrust of Islamic thought as it had developed by that time&quot;, including in the works of his near-contemporary Ibn Khaldun.

==Life==
Barani was born in 1285, to an Indian Muslim family native to Baran, (now Bulandshahr) in northern India, hence his nisba &quot;Barani&quot;. His ancestors had immigrated to Baran from the Indian town of Kaithal, Haryana. His father, uncle, and grandfather all worked in high government posts under the Sultan of Delhi. His maternal grandfather Husam-ud-Din, was an important officer of Ghiyas ud din Balban and his father Muwayyid-ul-Mulk held the post of &quot;naib&quot; of Arkali Khan, the son of Jalaluddin Firuz Khalji. His uncle Qazi Ala-ul-Mulk was the &quot;Kotwal&quot; (police chief) of Delhi during the reign of Ala-ud-Din Khalji. Barani never held a post, but was a &quot;nadim&quot; (companion) of Muhammad bin Tughlaq for seventeen years. During this period he was very close to Amir Khusro. After Tughlaq died, he fell out of favor. In &quot;Exile&quot; he wrote two pieces dealing with government, religion, and history, which he hoped would endear him to the new sultan, Firuz Shah Tughluq. He was not rewarded for his works and died poor in 1357.

His gravestone lies in the courtyard of Nizamuddin Auliya&#x27;s dargah in Delhi, at the entrance of the &quot;dalan&quot; of Mirdha Ikram, and near the tomb of Amir Khusrau.

==Works==

===Fatwa-i-Jahandari===
The &quot;Fatwa-i-Jahandari&quot; is a work containing the political ideals to be pursued by a Muslim ruler in order to earn religious merit and the gratitude of his subjects. It is written as nasihat(advices) for the Muslim kings.
His fatwa would condone segregation of the Muslim &quot;ashraf&quot; upper castes and &quot;ajlaf&quot; low castes, in addition to the &quot;azral&quot; under-castes or the converted Muslims who are regarded as &quot;ritually polluted&quot; by the ashraf. Muzaffar Alam argues that, contrarily to what many think, through this aristocratic view of power he doesn&#x27;t follow secular models (Iranian or Indian), &quot;rather, the interests of the Muslim community define the contours of his ideas on the heredity question&quot;, as he saw that during times of political troubles &quot;frequent changes within ruling classes lead to the ruination of illustrious Muslim families&quot;, and thus preserving these upper class families, themselves at such place for diverse administrative or military qualities, would lead to the advent of more capable rulers and in the longer run help Muslim interests, Alam to conclude that this hierarchization &quot;was a conscious choice exercised by Barani to serve the narrowly sectarian interests of the early Islamic regime in India&quot;.

The work delves into aspects of religion and government and the meeting of those two, as well as political philosophy. He notes:
Barani&#x27;s &quot;Fatwa-i-Jahandari&quot; provides an example of his views on religion. He states that there is no difference between a Muslim king and a Hindu ruler, if the Muslim king is content in collecting &quot;jizya&quot; (poll-tax) and &quot;khiraj&quot; (tribute) from the Hindus. Instead, he recommends that a Muslim king should concentrate all his power on holy wars and completely uproot the &quot;false creeds&quot;. According to him, a Muslim king could establish the supremacy of Islam in India only by slaughtering the Brahmins. He recommends that a Muslim king &quot;should make a firm resolve to overpower, capture, enslave and degrade the infidels.&quot;

At the same time, the book makes it clear that the kings of the Delhi Sultanate did not hold similar views. Barani rues that they honoured and favoured the Hindus, and had granted them the status of dhimmis (protected persons). The Muslim kings appointed Hindus to high posts, including governorships. Barani further laments that the Muslim kings were pleased with the prosperity of Hindus in their capital Delhi, even when poor Muslims worked for them and begged at their doors.

=== Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi ===
The &quot;Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi&quot; or &quot;Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi&quot; (Firuz Shah&#x27;s History) (1357) was an interpretation of the history of the Delhi Sultanate up to the then-present Firuz Shah Tughlaq. Then interpretation noted that the sultans who followed the rules of Barani had succeeded in their endeavors while those that did not, or those who had sinned, met the Nemesis.

But, though Barani refers many times to the sources of information, he did not consult his contemporary works. This resulted in the sketchy description of Ala-ud-Din Khalji’s wars in Chittor, Ranthambhor and Malwa and the Deccan campaigns of Malik Kafur. The later medieval historians, Nizam-ud-Din Ahmad, Badaoni, Ferishta and Haji-ud-Dabir depended upon the &quot;Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi&quot; for their account of history of the period covered in this work. Abdul Haq Dehlvi in his &quot;Akhbar-ul-Akhyar&quot; depended upon the work for the biographical sketches of Nizam-ud-Din Auliya and the other Sufi saints.

;Zawabit

Barani categorized the law into two kinds, the Shariat and the Zawabit. The Zawabit were the state laws formulated by the monarch in consultation with the nobility in the changed circumstances to cater to the new requirements which the Shariat was unable to fulfill.

The Zawabit, he said must be in the spirit of the Shariat and enumerated four conditions for its formulation as guidelines. They are-

* The Zawabit should not negate the Shariat.
* It must increase the loyalty and hope among the nobles and common people towards the Sultan
* Its sources and inspiration should be the Shariat and pious Caliphs
* If at all it had to negate the Shariat out of exigencies, it must follow charities and compensation in lieu of that negation

<text>Stavies () is a small village in the southern part of Crete, Greece. This village is built at a height of 240 m above sea-level, on the south edge of the valley of Messara and is mentioned in the Archives of Chandax in 1370. It is possible that the name Stavies has its origin in the Italian name Stavia, a town destroyed in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD. After the destruction of their village, refugees could have landed in Crete and built the present village.

It belongs to the municipality of Gortyna, former municipality of Kofinas, and nearby villages are Fournofarago, Dionysi and Vagionia. Its population approximates to 300 persons. The area is mainly agricultural and a large variety of high quality products are produced. Some of which are the famous Cretan olive oil and various products of grapes like wine, raisins, various types of vegetables (cabbages, lettuces, potatoes, pole beans etc.) and a local alcoholic drink named raki (&quot;Ρακί&quot;).

In relation to its size, Stavies is one of the few villages in the area that has more than one olive oil factory.

<text>Open Network Computing (ONC) Remote Procedure Call (RPC), commonly known as Sun RPC is a remote procedure call system. ONC was originally developed by Sun Microsystems in the 1980s as part of their Network File System project.

ONC is based on calling conventions used in Unix and the C programming language. It serializes data using the External Data Representation (XDR), which has also found some use to encode and decode data in files that are to be accessed on more than one platform. ONC then delivers the XDR payload using either UDP or TCP. Access to RPC services on a machine are provided via a &quot;port mapper&quot; that listens for queries on a well-known port (number 111) over UDP and TCP.

ONC RPC version 2 was first described in published in April 1988. In June 1988 it was updated by . Later it was updated by , published in August 1995. , published in May 2009, is the current version. All these documents describe only version 2 and version 1 was not covered by any RFC document. Authentication mechanisms used by ONC RPC are described in RFC 2695, RFC 2203, and RFC 2623.

Implementations of ONC RPC exist in most Unix-like systems. Microsoft supplied an implementation for Windows in their (now discontinued) Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX product; in addition, a number of third-party implementation of ONC RPC for Windows exist, including versions for C/C++, Java, and .NET (see external links).

In 2009, Sun relicensed the ONC RPC code under the standard 3-clause BSD license, which was reconfirmed by Oracle Corporation in 2010 following confusion about the scope of the relicensing.

<text>The Stupids are a fictional family which appear in a series of children&#x27;s books written by Harry Allard and James Marshall. The Stupids draw their humor from the fact that they are incompetent to the point of confusing the most simple concepts and tasks.

==Controversy==
&quot;The Stupids&quot; series of books rank number 62 on the American Library Association&#x27;s list of 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of the entire 2000&#x27;s decade. Challengers of the books claim that they describe families in a derogatory manner and may encourage children to be disobedient. They also claim that they promote low self-esteem and negative behavior.

== Books in the series ==
* &quot;The Stupids Step Out&quot; (1974)
* &quot;The Stupids Have a Ball&quot; (1978)
* &quot;The Stupids Die&quot; (1981)
* &quot;The Stupids Take Off&quot; (1989)

== Film version ==

In 1996, a film version was released starring Tom Arnold, directed by John Landis; It was a box office disappointment. The film details the family&#x27;s pursuit of their trash, which they believe to be stolen, and the &quot;conspiracy&quot; they uncover in the process. The film was also panned by many film critics.

<text>Mahallat () is a city in the Central District of Mahallat County, Markazi province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.

== History ==

In ancient times it was an important location for Zoroastrianism. It has a cold climate, and strong winds during spring and summer. The city is one of the major producers and exporters of flowers in Iran. Every September the city holds a flower festival. In addition, the area surrounding the city is rich with travertine deposits, which are refined into tiles in nearby factories.

There are remains of Hellenistic architecture from Alexander the Great&#x27;s time in Mahallat as well as fire temple ruins dated from the Zoroastrianism era. The city is famous for a large warm water spring flowing from mountains in the North into the plain areas of the South, which are used for agriculture as well as the urban water supply. There are also hot springs not far from the city which have been a source of local tourism since ancient times due to its assumed medical benefits. The dialect spoken in Mahallat is a version of a larger branch of dialects spoken in central Iran (Yazd, Isfahan, Khonsar) with several words having a noticeable connection to old Persian.

Mahallat was formerly divided into three major parts. The northern part was Mahallat-e Bala, the area of the Sadat-e Mahallat, the families descending from the prophet Mohammad. In the middle Mahallat-e Ghaleh, originally a vast open space with fields, but in the 18th century two brothers from Sabzevar and their soldiers and servants built castles and developed the area. The family was later known as Amiri, Amirkhani, Elahi, Majidi, Nasseri, Norouz Nasseri and Khosrovani (Mahallati). The southern part was named Mahallat-e Pain and this was where the Aga Khan built his huge castle.

==Demographics==
===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 35,319 in 10,285 households. The following census in 2011 counted 40,582 people in 12,635 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 43,245 people in 14,266 households.

== Notable people ==

Born in Mahallat were:
*Hajj Sayyah Mahallati, the first Iranian to become a US citizen
*Aga Khan II, a religious leader
*Mohsen Sadr (Sadr ol-Ashraf II), prime minister and senator
*General Parviz Khosrovani, deputy prime minister and founder and first president of the famous Taj Sports Club (Taj Football Club), later known as Esteghlal Football Club.

<doc id="1326049" wikidata="Q7636398" url="?curid=1326049" title="Sullivan Correctional Facility">
<text>Sullivan Correctional Facility was a New York State maximum security prison correctional facility for male prisoners located in Fallsburg, New York. It is operated by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. New York State announced its official closure date as November 6, 2024, with the inmates currently housed to be transferred to other facilities within New York State by that time.

Sullivan is located on an 850-acre (3.4 km2) stretch of land that also contains Woodbourne Correctional Facility, a medium-security prison. The state appropriated funding for Sullivan after the loss of Rikers Island as a state facility in 1980 (the facility was returned to New York City). The buildings were built on a sharp upslope overlooking the Neversink River valley.

In order to build access roads to the prison, the New York State Department of Correctional Services purchased the Lebowitz Pine View Hotel, the 62 acre (0.25 km2) adjoining property, in 1983. Originally, some prisoners from the Woodbourne facility were transferred and housed in the hotel buildings, which were operated as a Woodbourne annex until the completion of Sullivan in 1985. It operated as a minimum security Sullivan annex until 2010 when the annex portion was closed.

Sullivan houses between 560 and 580 inmates in four pods, arranged in a circle. Eighty-six percent of those inmates are being incarcerated for committing violent felonies, and 60% are serving life sentences

Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison, a not-for-profit organization was founded to provide college education to incarcerated people in an effort to help reduce recidivism and poverty, while strengthening families and communities. In 1998, as part of the get-tough-on-crime campaign, state and federal funding for college programs inside prison was stopped. Understanding the positive effects of education in the transformation and rehabilitation of incarcerated people, inmates at Sing Sing Correctional Facility reached out to religious and academic volunteers to develop a college-degree granting program. Under the leadership of Dr. Anne Reissner, Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison was founded to restore college education at Sing Sing through private funding. Hudson Link now runs pre-college and college degree programs at Fishkill, Greene, Sing Sing, Sullivan, and Taconic Correctional Facilities.

==Notable inmates==

* David Berkowitz – the &quot;Son of Sam&quot; serial killer who terrorized New York City in 1977, serving 6 life sentences in Shawangunk Correctional Facility
* Nicholas Brooks, killed his girlfriend Sylvie Cachay – sentenced to 25 years to life.
* Robert Chambers – the &quot;Preppie Killer&quot; serving a 19-year sentence on a drug charge. Chambers was housed at Shawangunk Correctional Facility until his release in July 2023.
* Ronald DeFeo Jr. – killed his entire family and sparked the writing of &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;. Serving 6 concurrent sentences of 25 years to life, he died on March 15, 2021.
* Abraham Hirschfeld – New York parking garage magnate convicted of hiring a hitman to kill his business partner of 40 years. Sentenced to 3 years, served 2. He was released in 2002, and died in 2005.
* Larme Price – serving a life sentence for murdering four immigrants in 2003, with the motivation being revenge for the September 11 attacks.
* Arthur Shawcross – the Genesee River Killer, died November 10, 2008.

<doc id="1326050" wikidata="Q10783" url="?curid=1326050" title="Valdemorillo">
<text>Valdemorillo is a Spanish town and municipality located in the Community of Madrid. The municipality, with a population of 13,453 inhabitants (INE 2022), includes, in addition to the town of Mojadillas, El Paraíso, Pino Alto Cazadero Real, Pino Alto Sector Sur, Jarabeltrán, Puentelasierra, La Esperanza, Montemorillo, Parque de las Infantas, La Pizarrera, Mirador del Romero, Los Barrancos and Cerro Alarcón shared with Navalagamella and Ampliación Cerro Alarcón. In the municipality is located part of the reservoir of Valmayor.

== History ==
Since the late middle ages and up to the early 19th century, when it became part of the province of Madrid, Valdemorillo belonged to the land of Segovia, originally as part of the &quot;sexmo&quot; of Casarrubios.

== Geography ==
It limits the north with this locality, to the west with Robledo de Chavela and Navalagamella, to the east with Colmenarejo and to the south with Villanueva de la Cañada and Quijorna.

Among its main population centers are the urbanizations: Mojadillas, El Paraiso, Pino Alto, Jarabeltrán, Puentelasierra, Las Charquillas, La Esperanza, Montemorillo, Parque de las Infantas, La Pizarrera, Mirador del Romero, Mirador de Pino Alto, Los Barrancos, Valmayor and Cerro Alarcón I and II, the latter shared with Navalagamella. Its most important roads are the M-600, which connects El Escorial with Navalcarnero, and the M-510, which runs from Galapagar to Chapinería.

Valdemorillo is one of the maximum suppliers of drinking water in the Community of Madrid. In this town, part of the Valmayor reservoir is located, which also floods the municipalities of El Escorial and Colmenarejo. It is the second reservoir with the highest storage capacity in the Madrid region, after El Atazar.

Its term is partially included in the Regional Park of the middle course of the Guadarrama River and its surroundings. It is also part of the tourist itinerary known as the Imperial Route of the Community of Madrid, built around the roads used by Felipe II on his travels from Madrid to the Monastery of El Escorial.

== Festivities and traditions ==

The town is famous for celebrating the first bullfighting fair of the year, which takes place at the beginning of February, within the major festivals of San Blas. This fair, which officially opens the bull season in Spain, takes place in the La Candelaria bullring, inaugurated in 2003.

The town has as patrons San Blas and La Candelaria (2 and 3 February), chosen only by the coincidence of their festivity with the arrival, in 1574, of the royal procession carrying the mortal remains of Emperor Carlos I, on the way to the Monastery of El Escorial, reason why it is included in the so-called Imperial Route of the Community of Madrid.

<doc id="1326064" wikidata="Q819497" url="?curid=1326064" title="Peak of eternal light">
<text>A peak of eternal light (PEL) is a hypothetical point on the surface of an astronomical body that is always in sunlight. Such a peak must have high latitude, high elevation, and be on a body with very small axial tilt. The existence of such peaks was first postulated by Beer and Mädler in 1837. The pair said about the lunar polar mountains: &quot;...many of these peaks have (with the exception of eclipses caused by the Earth) eternal sunshine&quot;. These polar peaks were later mentioned by Camille Flammarion in 1879, who speculated that there may exist at the poles of the Moon. PELs would be advantageous for space exploration and colonization due to the ability of an electrical device located there to receive solar power regardless of the time of day or day of the year, and the relatively stable temperature range.

Detailed lunar topography collected by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) suggests that no points on the Moon receive perpetual light during both the winter and summer. However, there are points on crater rims which have very extended periods of sunlight.

==On the Moon==

===Orbital survey===
The ESA SMART-1, NASA &quot;Clementine&quot; and JAXA &quot;SELENE&quot; spacecraft made maps of the lunar poles that have been used to identify sites receiving eternal light. The orbiting craft monitored the lighting at the poles and looked for seasonal variations, as well as mapping the relief so that peaks of eternal light could be identified topographically.

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter then took a data set including 24,000 wide-area camera and 31,500 narrow-angle camera images within 2° of the poles. These were used to construct high-resolution maps that reveal illuminated terrain under varying lighting conditions.

===Lunar north pole===
Based on images from the &quot;Clementine&quot; lunar mission, a team from Johns Hopkins University suggested that four locations along the rim of the Peary crater are candidates for peaks of eternal light. This crater lies near the north pole of the Moon. &quot;Clementine&quot;″s images were taken during the northern summer, however, and did not address illumination of these peaks during the winter, when the Sun is below the horizon. Further data from the &quot;SELENE&quot; spaceprobe determined that one peak at Peary Crater receives sunlight for 89% of a lunar year.

===Lunar south pole===

The lunar south pole is situated in a huge depression, leading to 16 km altitude differences over the region. Careful analysis of imagery and topographic conditions on the lunar South Pole by teams from NASA and the ESA revealed a small number of illuminated ridges within 15 km of the pole, each of them much like an island of no more than a few hundred meters across in an ocean of eternal darkness, where a lander could receive near-permanent lighting (for ~70–90% of the southern lunar winter, and likely all of the southern lunar summer).

The Malapert Mountain region, on the rim of the Malapert crater 122 km from the lunar south pole on the Earth-facing side, may also have high levels of illumination. One study estimates the Malapert Mountain region to receive less than full sunlight 11% of the time. Sunlight exposure varies by year due to the Moon&#x27;s orbit being 1.5° off-plane with the Sun. 2005 estimates of sunlight coverage of the Malapert Mountain region found only six partially lit or unlit events that year: 0–159 hours of complete sunset per event and 41–199 hours of complete or partial sunset per event. A later study using a combination of both &quot;Clementine&quot; imaging and &quot;SELENE&quot; topographical data estimated only 74% of full sunlight for the year 2020. This study found that two points only ~8 km from each other along a straight ridge extending from Shackleton Crater at the Lunar South Pole are illuminated a combined ~94% of a lunar year. This is because both points cast shadows upon each other during different times of the lunar year, and only a few times of darkness occur when further peaks throw shadows over both of these points simultaneously.

The data set from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter shows that some sites on the rim of Shackelton remain illuminated for 94% of a lunar year. The longest all three Shackleton outposts are eclipsed is 43 h.

=== In culture ===

* &quot;Moon Temple&quot; planned for a peak of eternal light on Shackleton crater&#x27;s rim to address future needs (such as spiritual accommodation) of people living on the Moon
** — European Space Agency artist in residence Jorge Mañes Rubio created initial design
** — corresponding artifacts were created by the ESA Advanced Concepts Team

However, in 1999, six years after his disappearance, Fiza, fed up of living with uncertainty, resolves to search for her brother. Fiza decides to use whatever means she can—the law, media, and even politicians—to find her brother, which brings her into contact with various characters and situations. She also learns that Amaan was reprimanded by a police officer when he asked him to save his life and was asked to go to Pakistan for same shocking him and later was later attacked, but escaped. While his lover Shehnaaz who kept waiting for him all these years marries Salim due to family pressure. On the basis of Amaan&#x27;s eye matching a terrorist, Fiza&#x27;s friend Anirudh Roy concludes that Amaan might have joined a terrorist group in Rajasthan borders.

She finds him in Rajasthan borders and is horrified to learn that he has joined a terrorist group. He narrates how he survived riots and the horrendous views he witnessed amidst this and how Murad Khan involved him in his terrorist group after saving his life. She forces him to come home, and he finally reunites with their mother. Soon Amaan learns of Anirudh&#x27;s romantic feelings for Fiza and his desire to marry her and always be with their family. After realising the purity of Anirudh&#x27;s love towards Fiza, Amaan approves him to approach her and requests that he always stand by his family. Amaan tries to find a job as he doesn&#x27;t want to be a burden on his sister and mother but is repeatedly rejected due to his shady past. Due to this, his allegiance and thoughts make him want to return to the terrorist network, led by Murad. A confrontation with two men who harass Fiza leads Amaan to reveal his involvement with the terrorist network to his sister, mother, and the police. His mother&#x27;s grief of losing her innocent son as a terrorist eventually led her to kill herself.

Fiza tries once more to find her brother, with Anirudh&#x27;s help.

Amaan is sent on a mission to kill two powerful politicians who use people on the basis of religion and approached Fiza too once for same reason when she was on her quest to find Amaan; when he does succeed in assassinating them, his own terrorist group tries to kill him. He escapes, and Fiza follows him. They confront each other, and with the police closing in on him, Amaan asks Fiza to kill him stating he can never feel proud of his life but wants a dignified end to his life by death through her hands.

==Production==
Khalid Mohammed originally wanted to have Ram Gopal Varma direct this movie when he finished the script and had Urmila Matondkar in mind for the central role of Fiza, which was eventually played by Kapoor. Although Kapoor plays Roshan&#x27;s older sister in this film, he is 5 months older than her in real life. Originally, the role played by Roshan was supposed to be a minor one. But after his debut film &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot; (2000) became a blockbuster overnight, Mohammed panicked. He knew expectations were high because of Roshan, so he increased the length of his role. Many scenes like his workout, and an extra song were added to suit Roshan&#x27;s new status of a superstar. Additionally, the film was set to be an artistic film. But Mohammed decided to commercialize the film due to pressure from the distributors. A dance number for Kapoor was added, in addition to the park scene with Johnny Lever.

==Reception and awards==
The film was critically acclaimed and did well at the box office. Critics praised the lead performances. Kapoor in particular was applauded for her performance as a disillusioned sister.

Vinayak Chakravorty from &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, writing, &quot;&quot;Fiza&quot; is more than just about Mohammed&#x27;s foray into film-making. It is about Kapoor proving a point as an actress of some substance. It is about Roshan&#x27;s establishing that he doesn&#x27;t need maximum footage or glitz to impress. It is about the return after a hiatus of the ever-delightful Bachchan.&quot; Mimmy Jain of &quot;The Indian Express&quot;, in a positive review, wrote, &quot;&quot;Fiza&quot; is the kind of movie that every critic prays will never come his way. For a critic&#x27;s job, after all, is to criticize. And &quot;Fiza&quot; offers little scope for criticism.&quot; She further noted Kapoor for delivering &quot;a superbly flawless performance&quot;. Sanjeev Bariana of &quot;The Tribune&quot; labelled the film &quot;only a little above average&quot;, but was highly appreciative of the performances. Suman Tarafdar of &quot;Filmfare&quot; gave a positive review of the film and Kapoor&#x27;s acting, and Chaya Unnikrishnan of &quot;Screen&quot; praised the performances and concluded that &quot;Fiza&quot; &quot;does live upto the expectations&quot;. &quot;Screen&quot; magazine&#x27;s critic Chaya Unnikrishnan, while disappointed with the film&#x27;s second half, described it as &quot;a mature film&quot; and commended the performances. Dinesh Raheja of &quot;India Today&quot; praised the performances but concluded: &quot;&quot;Fiza&quot; remains watchable for its captivatingly-captured sequences within a close-knit family. But, the big picture it wants to capture remains underdeveloped.&quot;

In May 2010, &quot;Fiza&quot; was one of the 14 Hindi films selected by the Film Society of Lincoln Center to be screened as part of a section called &quot;Muslim Cultures of Bombay Cinema&quot; which aims to &quot;celebrate and explore the rich influence of Muslim cultural and social traditions on the cinema of Bombay to the present&quot;.

&quot;Fiza&quot; was banned from screening in Malaysia.

== Music ==
Initially, A. R. Rahman was approached to compose the music for the film, but he declined citing date issues. However he agreed to compose one song which became &quot;Piya Haji Ali&quot;, while rest of the songs were composed by Anu Malik. He later composed for the director&#x27;s next, &quot;Tehzeeb&quot; (2003). For the background score of &quot;Fiza&quot;, Rahman suggested his associate Ranjit Barot. Barot composed the score. The album was one of the most popular soundtracks of the year. It features popular songs like &quot;Aaja Mahiya&quot;, &quot;Aankh Milaoongi&quot;, &quot;Tu Fiza Hai&quot; and &quot;Mehboob Mere&quot;. &quot;Mehboob Mere&quot; was performed by Sushmita Sen as an Item number. At the 46th Filmfare Awards, Malik received a Best Music Director nomination for the soundtrack of the film. for his work on this album.

== Synopsis ==

Saraswati Batra (Waheeda Rehman) is the widowed mother of Om (Anil Kapoor), Jai (Fardeen Khan), and Jagadish (Abhishek Bachchan). Om is responsible and provides the income for the whole family. He works in a music company owned by his friend, Shekhar Malhotra (Parmeet Sethi). Jai is very ambitious (he wants to construct the world&#x27;s fastest car) and is studying in the United States. His education is paid for by Om, for which he has taken a loan from Shekhar Malhotra. Jagadish is a college student who is very good with computers. Jai soon returns home after Om and his mother convince him.

They all want different things, and soon Om and Jai marry. Om marries the bubbly Ayesha (Mahima Chaudhry), an MTV VJ, and Jai marries Neetu (Urmila Matondkar), the daughter of a rich NRI. Jagadish is in love with Pooja (Tara Sharma), who is from Bangalore; they meet at a college festival. When Jai clashes with Om&#x27;s values, they drift apart.

Soon Jai receives a promotion back in the United States and leaves with Neetu. Jagadish is caught computer hacking after trying to help a friend get the answers to a test, and Om throws him out of the house as a result. Om, Ayesha, and his mother have to leave the house after Om failed to pay the loan covering it. The three brothers are separated. Eventually, they all come together at the house auction to buy it back. Om is at the auction to see the winner and is surprised when Jagadish shows up to bid. He reveals that he used his hacking skills to create a program to block hackers instead. Jai comes at the end of the auction and bids more, which he got by selling his engine for the fastest car, and realizes that his future is in India, not in the United States. He doesn&#x27;t have enough, so the three brothers combine their money to win back the house, but it isn&#x27;t enough. Finally, it is revealed that the CEO of the company, who Jagadish made the hacking program for, bid for the house and won.

<doc id="1326084" wikidata="Q2628944" url="?curid=1326084" title="Daniel Camargo Barbosa">
<text>Daniel Camargo Barbosa (22 January 1930 – 13 November 1994) was a Colombian serial killer and rapist. He is one of the most prolific serial killers in history and is believed to have raped and murdered at least 72 young girls in Colombia and Ecuador during the 1970s and 1980s.

Barbosa was stabbed to death in prison by a fellow inmate in 1994.

==Early life==
Camargo&#x27;s mother died before he had even reached the age of one and his father was overbearing and emotionally distant. Afterwards his father married another woman, Dioselina Fernandez, who had fertility problems. This caused his new stepmother to become abusive to Daniel, humiliating him in various ways. She dressed him up as a girl and then forced him to go to school dressed that way; his peers and classmates made fun of him. Despite this humiliation, Daniel stood out as a great student at the León XIII school in Bogotá with a reported IQ of 116. However, his desire to continue studying was hampered when he was forced to drop out of school to help his family financially.

==Crimes and imprisonment==
He was first arrested in Bogotá in 1958 for petty theft.

Camargo had a de facto union with a woman named Alcira and had two children with her. He fell in love with another woman, Esperanza (age 28), whom he planned to marry, but then found out that she was not a virgin. This became the root of Camargo&#x27;s fixations. He and Esperanza formed an agreement that he would stay with her if she aided him in finding other virgin girls to rape. Thus began a period of their partnership in crime. Esperanza was Camargo&#x27;s accomplice, luring young girls to an apartment under false pretenses and then drugging them with sodium seconal sleeping pills so that Camargo could rape them. Camargo committed five rapes in this way, but did not kill any of the girls. The fifth child that they abused in this way reported the crime, and both Camargo and Esperanza were arrested and taken to separate prisons. Camargo was convicted of sexual assault in Colombia on 10 April 1964.

A judge sentenced him to three years in prison, and Camargo was initially grateful for the perceived leniency of the judge, swearing to repent and mend his ways. However, a new judge was given precedence over the case and Camargo was sentenced to eight years in prison. This provoked Camargo to rebellious anger. He served his full sentence, and was then released.

In 1973 he was arrested in Brazil for being undocumented. Due to a delay in sending Camargo&#x27;s criminal records from Colombia, he was deported and released with his false identity. When he returned to Colombia, he took up a job as a street vendor in Barranquilla selling television monitors. One day when passing by a school, he kidnapped a 9-year-old girl, murdering her after committing rape so that she could not inform the police as his previous victim had done. This was his first known assault involving murder.

Camargo was arrested on 3 May 1974 in Barranquilla, Colombia, when he returned to the scene of the crime to recover the television screens that he had left beside the victim. Even though it is believed that he raped and killed more than 80 girls in Colombia, Camargo was imprisoned in Colombia after being convicted of raping and killing a 9-year-old girl. He was initially sentenced to 30 years in prison, but this sentence was reduced to 25 years, and he was interned in the prison on Gorgona Island on 24 December 1977.

==Escape from Colombia to Ecuador==
In November 1984 Camargo escaped from Gorgona prison (known as the Colombian Alcatraz) in a primitive boat after having carefully studied the ocean currents. The authorities assumed that he died at sea and the press reported that he had been eaten by sharks. He eventually arrived in Quito, Ecuador. He then traveled by bus to Guayaquil on 5 or 6 December 1984. On 18 December he abducted a 9-year-old girl from the city of Quevedo, in the province of Los Ríos, Ecuador. The next day a 10-year-old girl also disappeared.

From 1984 to 1986, Camargo committed a series of at least 54 rapes and murders in Guayaquil. The police at first believed that all the deaths were the work of a gang, not understanding that one man could have killed so many. Camargo slept on the streets, and lived off the money he gained by reselling ballpoint pens. Occasionally he supplemented his income by selling clothing or small valuables belonging to his victims.

==Modus operandi==
Camargo selected helpless, young, lower-class girls in search of work and approached them, pretending to be a foreigner who needed to find a Protestant pastor in a church on the outskirts of town. He explained that he had to deliver a large sum of money, which he showed them as proof, and he offered them a reward if they would accompany him to show him the way. He pretended that he was a stranger to the area, and hinted at the possibility of the girls getting a job at the factory. No one was suspicious of an older man accompanying a girl or young woman who could be his granddaughter. Camargo would then enter into the woods, claiming to be looking for a shortcut in order to avoid arousing suspicion in his victims. If the girls did grow suspicious and drew back, he did not prevent them from leaving. Camargo raped his victims before strangling them, sometimes stabbing them when they resisted. After his victims were dead, he left their bodies in the forest.

==Arrest==
Camargo was arrested by two policemen in Quito on 26 February 1986, only a few minutes after he had murdered a 9-year-old girl named Elizabeth. The policemen were on patrol and approached him at the height of the avenue Los Granados, thinking that he was acting suspiciously. They found that he was carrying with him a bag containing the bloody clothes and clitoris of his latest victim, and a copy of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; by Dostoyevsky. He was taken into custody and later moved to Guayaquil for identification. When he was arrested he gave a false name, Manuel Bulgarin Solis, but he was later identified by María Alexandra Vélez who was one of his rape victims that had escaped.

Daniel Camargo calmly confessed to killing 72 girls in Ecuador since escaping from the Colombian island prison. He led authorities to the dumping grounds of those victims whose bodies had not yet been recovered. The bodies had been dismembered. While he told the Ecuadorian authorities of the locations of the bodies and how the sadistic crimes were committed, he showed no feelings of remorse. After raping his victims, he had hacked, slashed and crushed the girls with a machete. He gave a cynical explanation for choosing children. He wanted virgins &quot;because they cried&quot;; this apparently gave him greater satisfaction. According to Camargo, he killed because he wanted revenge on women&#x27;s unfaithfulness. He hated them for not being what he believed women were supposed to be.

==Interview==
In June 1986 Francisco Febres Cordero, a journalist for the newspaper &quot;Hoy&quot; (Today), managed to arrange an interview with Camargo. It was difficult to get the interview due to the police blocking all access to Camargo, and the fact that Camargo himself demanded a large fee before he would let himself be interviewed. The journalist pretended to be part of a group of psychologists that were allowed access to the prisoner, allowing him to ask Camargo searching questions without arousing his suspicion.

==Sentence==
Camargo was convicted in 1989 and sentenced to 16 years in prison, the maximum sentence available in Ecuador at the time. While serving his sentence in the Garcia Moreno de Quito jail, he claimed to have converted to Christianity. In this penitentiary he was imprisoned with
Pedro Alonso López (also dubbed &quot;the Monster of the Andes&quot;), who is believed to have raped and killed as many as 300 girls in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.

==Death==
On 13 November 1994, Camargo was stabbed to death in prison by Geovanny Noguera, who was a nephew of one of his victims. He was 64 years old at the time of his death.
