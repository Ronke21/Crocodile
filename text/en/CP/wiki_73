<text>Dominance and submission (D/s) is a set of behaviors, customs, and rituals involving the submission of one person to another in an erotic episode or lifestyle. It is a subset of BDSM. This form of sexual contact and pleasure has been shown to please a minority of people.

Physical contact is not necessary, and D/s can be conducted anonymously over the telephone, email, or other messaging systems. In other cases, it can be intensely physical, sometimes crossing into sadomasochism. In D/s, both parties take pleasure or erotic enjoyment from either dominating or being dominated. Those who take the superior position are called &quot;dominants&quot;—&quot;Doms&quot; (regardless of gender) or &quot;Dommes&quot; (female)—while those who take the subordinate position are called &quot;submissive&quot;, or &quot;subs&quot;. A &quot;switch&quot; is an individual who plays either role. Two switches together may negotiate and exchange roles several times in a session. The term &quot;dominatrix&quot; usually refers to a female sex worker who dominates others for pay while the term &quot;maledom&quot; is used for a sexually dominant male in BDSM practices.

== History ==
The dominant–submissive relationship fits within the overarching term BDSM and its lifestyle. &quot;BDSM&quot; stands for &quot;bondage and discipline&quot; (B&amp;D), &quot;domination and submission&quot; (D&amp;S), and &quot;sadism and masochism&quot; (S&amp;M). Many misconceptions of this relationship and its associated activities come from the fact that early theorists conceptualized that sadomasochism and BDSM behavior were a symptom of psychopathology. It was thought that people who participated in this type of sexual play disregarded safety and consent, which influenced the diagnosis, classification, and perception of this type of relationship. These misconceptions of all participants of BDSM having disordered tendencies have related to the definition and criteria for sadomasochism in the DSM-5. Therefore, many in the BDSM community do not fit the criteria.

It is possible that this community of BDSM participants was formed in the early 18th century, and maybe even before. For example, the dominant–submissive partnership has been shown in early versions of the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;. Not only is it shown in literature but also in the actions of ancient rulers that would participate in sexually sadistic torture, role play, and finally the assertion of their dominance over subjects. Their actions show severe sadomasochism as well as the early-onset behaviors of the community.

The relationship between a dominant and submissive revolves around consent and guidelines. Within the world of BDSM, consent is a core focus and requirement because it is what separates sexual sadism from coercive sexual sadism disorder in the DSM-5. Sexual sadism disorder and sexual masochism disorder have been changed in order to differentiate between consensual and non consensual partners. As well as meeting the new criteria to be classified as one or the other, for example, the person being diagnosed must be experiencing personal distress about their paraphilia rather than distress coming from society&#x27;s disapproval. The growth of dominant and submissive behavior, sadomasochism, and other BDSM activity is evident through its history, from ancient times through the separation from disorder to consensual-community participant.

== Overview ==
Dominance and submission have a long history in human culture and civilization. In human sexuality, this has broadened to include voluntarily chosen roles and activities that express dominance and submission. The proportion of the population which partakes in D/s activities is difficult to ascertain as the statistics vary widely depending on the particular study, date of publication, and country where the research has taken place.

A 1985 study suggested that about 30 percent of participants in BDSM activities are females, and the rest are males. A study by the California Graduate Institute in 2008 found that 61 percent of men were exclusively or mainly dominant (26 percent were exclusively or mainly submissive), while 69 percent of women were exclusively or mainly submissive (30 percent were exclusively or mainly dominant).

A study in 2008 found that only 2.2% of men and 1.3% of women had participated in a BDSM activity in the previous year. In 2017, a Belgian study of BDSM interest in the general population, with a sample size of 1,027, found that 46.8% of the total sample had ever performed at least one BDSM-related activity. An additional 22% had fantasized about it, and 12.5% performed at least one BDSM-related activity on a regular basis.

A 2019 publication states that a minority of the population engages or fantasizes about BDSM activity. A national study with 2,800 participants showed that about 14% of men and 11% of women had participated in some sort of BDSM related activity and from those results, it was concluded that approximately 10% of adults have joined in some part of the sexual behavior.

A &quot;safeword&quot; is usually given to the submissive partner to prevent the dominant from overstepping physical and emotional boundaries. It is usually a code word, series of code words or other signal used to communicate physical or emotional state, typically when approaching, or crossing, a boundary. Safewords can have differing levels of urgency - some may bring a scene to an outright stop, whereas others may indicate that a boundary is being approached. A safeword may be used by the Dominant as well as the Submissive if they feel things have gone too far and are uncomfortable continuing.

D/s may be ritualized or freeform. It is usually a negotiated lifestyle, with people discussing their wishes, limits, and needs in order to find commonality. A D/s relationship may be sexual or non-sexual, long- or short-term, and intimate or anonymous. Most adherents search for the essential intensity, trust, and intimacy that are required to make any deep relationship possible.

Based on gender (of the dominant or submissive), D/s can be divided into the following sub-types:
* Female dominance
* Female submission
* Male dominance
* Male submission

==Terminology==

BDSM is the sexual practices of bondage and pain / torture , dominant and submissive, as well as sadomasochism.

D/s participants often refer to their activity as &quot;play&quot;, with an individual play session being called a &quot;scene&quot;. In addition to &quot;dominant&quot; and &quot;submissive&quot; a &quot;switch&quot; is a person who can take either role. The dominant and submissive relations pertain to two people who play with psychological, emotional, and/or physical dominance. Most of the time in sexual relationships like this there is some sort of power exchange through their physical interaction. A scene between two switches can involve trading off the dominant and submissive roles, possibly several times. In contrast, the terms &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; refer to the active (agent) and passive (patient) roles, respectively. In a given scene, there is no requirement that the dominant also be the top, or that the submissive be the bottom, although this is often the case.

The term vanilla refers to normative (&quot;non-kinky&quot;) sex and relationships, the vanilla world being mainstream society outside of the BDSM subculture. The term comes from vanilla ice cream being considered the &quot;default&quot; flavor.

The term &quot;power exchange&quot; refers to the empowerment of the dominant by the submissive&#x27;s surrender to his/ her control. Power exchange is consensual and in reality, it is the submissive that has the underlying control during the relationship exchange. The dominant is attempting to satisfy the submissive&#x27;s kinks and desires.

The terms &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; are used as verbs or nouns to describe the physical play of SM but with less of a focus of the &quot;sadist&quot; and &quot;masochist&quot; part of the activity. They can be used as synonyms for &quot;dominant&quot; and &quot;submissive&quot;.

The term &quot;dungeon&quot; is used as a reference to a space/room designated for sadomasochism play. It can also be used to describe a club where these activities take place. It can also be a place to practice kinks safely and learn how to carry out activities and play.

The term &quot;dungeon monitors&quot; is used as a description of well-trusted BDSM members that volunteer to monitor dungeons and look out for infractions, distress, or any other form of misconduct or non-consent.

The term &quot;flogger&quot; is used to describe a tool or whip used in sexual scenes. The action of flogging refers to impact play. Usually made of leather with a hard handle and multiple long flat strands attached. The term can also be used to describe the person holding the specialized whip.

===Linguistic conventions===
Some people in the D/s world capitalize words and names that refer to dominants, and do not capitalize those that refer to submissives, hence the capitalization of D/s; others do not. It was popularized in internet chatrooms, to make it easier to identify the orientation of the writer or the person being written about.

Also, some submissives eschew personal pronouns, instead referring to themselves as &quot;this slave&quot; or &quot;Master Bob&#x27;s girl&quot;. This is sometimes considered an expression of modesty, but it is an entirely optional method of depersonalizing a submissive during &quot;play&quot;. It may have roots in the military, where new recruits are required to refer to themselves as &quot;this recruit&quot;, rather than &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me&quot;.

==D/s relationship styles==


There can be any number of partners in a D/s relationship: one dominant may have several submissives, who may in turn dominate others, or a submissive may have multiple dominants. Relationships may be monogamous or polyamorous. Romantic love is not necessarily a feature in D/s: partners might be very much in love or have no romantic relationship at all. Some D/s relationships are sexual, others completely chaste.

Fantasy role play can be an element, with partners taking classic dominant or submissive roles, or classic authority-figure roles such as teacher and student, police officer and suspect, or parent and child. Animal play, where one partner takes the role of owner or caretaker and the other takes the part of a pet or animal, can also be D/s play.

A classic example of a D/s role is the &quot;sissy&quot; maid, where an adult male dresses in cartoonish female clothing and performs stereotypical female chores such as housecleaning or serving tea. Cross-dressing in D/s does not always involve a desire to be sissified or made into caricatures of women or to serve: for example, others may desire to be made as beautiful as possible and interact on a &quot;girlfriend-to-girlfriend&quot; non-sexual basis.

Variation in D/s is virtually limitless and the activities take many forms, and may be combined with other forms of BDSM. These variations may include:

* professional – Dominatrix
* Maledom
* resistance play – forcing the submissive to do something against their will as an intense form of power play
* domestic servitude or consensual slavery
* enforced chastity of the submissive
* sexual slavery
*fetishes – such as foot fetish, boot worship, uniforms, smoking, latex and other items can be fetishes. 
* humiliation (breast humiliation for its size and shape, clitoris and labia size humiliation, humiliation for not having curvy or big buttocks and hips, small penis humiliation, verbal humiliation)
* dehumanization (e.g., pony, puppy or animal roleplay)
* objectification (human furniture): (e.g., submissive&#x27;s body used as footstool, or sub&#x27;s mouth used as spitting bowl and cigarette ashtray)
* cross-dressing
* whipping
* corporal punishment
* trampling
* human toilet – golden showers
* cuckquean
* feminization
* cuckold
* bondage (sexual)
* public humiliation

==Safety==
There are some risks commonly associated with D/s concerning both physical and mental health. Some examples are:
* Physical health complications such as bruising, broken skin, nerve damage due to tight bondage, burns due to hot wax play, or blood-borne pathogen exposure during needle play.
* In rare cases, death may occur when the participants engage in activities that have the potential to cause serious physical injury. The most common activity associated with accidental death is erotic strangulation. A study by Bunzel et al. showed that between 1993 and 2017 more death occurred from auto-erotic activities than from partnered activities, and men were more likely to die in both cases than women. 
* Negative emotional states during or after partaking in D/s activities

==Consent and contracts==

Consent is a vital element in all psychological play, and consent can be granted in many ways. Some employ a written form known as a &quot;Dungeon negotiation form&quot;, for others a simple verbal commitment is sufficient. Consent can be limited both in duration and content. There are many versions of consent but mainly it is the knowledge between the partnership of who plays the dominant role and who plays the submissive. The commitment of knowing who afflicts and receives the pain, bondage, torture, and/or humiliation. As well as the fact that all erotic experiences are performed in a safe, legal, and consensual practice as well as benefiting both parties. The consensual practice is what helps distinguish BDSM participants from a psychiatric diagnosis of a sexual disorder. The community of BDSM has adopted the saying &quot;Safe, Sane, Consensual&quot; (SSC) and &quot;Risk-Aware Consensual Kink&quot; (RACK) and a new addition &quot;Caring, Communication, Consent, and Caution&quot; (4Cs). Consent has also been categorized into three groups: surface, scene, and deep consent. Surface consent has been defined as a simple yes or no. Scene consent has been described as including parameters of a top/ bottom negotiation and agreement of a play scene. While deep consent involves the mental capacity of the bottom (submissive) and the awareness of the top that the bottom is able to use a safeword. The BDSM community have a simple code of conduct concerning the boundaries of safety and negotiation to ensure consensual BDSM.

Negotiation in terms of the sexual scenes is required to ensure that the BDSM play is enjoyable and safe for both parties involved. The discussion of what activities are available and the mutual definition of the play is the only way both the dominant and submissive will be able to comfortably perform. There is a complexity to negotiation depending on the trust and emotional attachment the partners have towards each other, the more familiarity between the two the less negotiation needed. The extent of negotiation depends on the partner&#x27;s involvement, for example, less risk behavior the less negotiation needed.

Safewords are verbal codes both partners can recognize as the end or altering of activities done in a BDSM scene. It is an important asset to continue the consent through the relationship and scene itself. The use of a safeword at any time, regardless of the intensity of the scene, usually signifies the end to a scene, or activity and possible withdrawal of consent completely. Within the community of BDSM, there are universal safewords used according to traffic lights and known as &quot;house safewords&quot;. Red means stop everything, yellow means slow down and to not go any further, and green meaning go and continue with more intensity. There are also possibilities where speaking is not an option and so there are &quot;silent safewords&quot; that are simple gestures that represent stopping an activity, for example, clapping hands, snapping fingers, or any action showing the scene must end. The use of safewords and the abode of them go hand and hand with consent and negotiation. All of it ensures a safe space where both participants are able to enjoy the sexual play.

The BDSM community takes consent very seriously and promotes safe play. They provide many resources so people may learn how to respect consent, such as education, information, and safety. They also provide public playrooms with dungeon monitors to make sure the rules are kept and followed. They have consequences for people who break the built trust and disobey the rule of consent and boundaries. Some punishments include being blacklisted from the community and labeled as a &quot;predator.&quot; Being blacklisted includes being personally ridiculed by individual members, as well as exclusion from play parties, clubs, and organizations held by the community.

Although they take all the precautions to the events, coercion and sexual assault still occur inside and outside the community. There are many forms to this that include, knowingly violating consent, accidental violations, and misunderstandings from the lack of communication towards definitions and agreed-upon activities. The National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (NCSF) is an educational organization that is driven to propose positive and safe sex that was founded in 1997. They conducted a survey with 4,598 participants in BDSM and 1,307 of them reported being touched without consent. Out of the participants, 26% reported they were attacked by a predator and 33% said they were coerced. 81% of the sample said that during the activity they wanted it to stop. It is important to include that participants of BDSM are not more likely to be coerced or sexually assaulted, there is no significant relationship between the two. That being said just because someone participates in a dominant and submissive relationship does not mean they will eventually be sexually assaulted or coerced.

Consensual non-consensuality is a mutual agreement to act as if consent has been waived within safe, sane limits. It is an agreement that consent is given in advance, sometimes without foreknowledge of the exact actions planned, though within defined limits subject to a safeword, reasonable care, common sense, or other restrictions. The consent is given with the intent of its being irrevocable under normal circumstances. As such, it is a show of extreme trust and understanding and is usually undertaken only by partners who know each other well, or otherwise agree to set clear, safe limits on their activities.

It is not unusual to grant consent only for an hour or for an evening. When a scene lasts for more than a few hours, it is common to draft a &quot;scene contract&quot; that defines what will happen and who is responsible for what. It is a good way to work out what all the parties want and usually improves the experience. Some contracts can become quite detailed and run for many pages, especially if a scene is to last a weekend or more.

For long term consent, a &quot;slave contract&quot; may be drawn up. Slave contracts are simply a way for consenting adults to define the nature of their relationship and clarify personal boundaries, and are not intended to carry legal force.

After a slave contract is drafted, some celebrate the event with a &quot;collaring ceremony&quot;, in which the local D/s community is invited to witness the commitment made in the document. Some ceremonies become quite elaborate, and can be as involved as a wedding or any similar ritual.

==Equipment and accessories==


Some people maintain a special room or area, called a dungeon or playroom, that contains special equipment, such as shackles, handcuffs, whips, queening stools, and spanking benches or a Berkley horse, for example, used for play scenes, or they may visit a BDSM club that maintains such facilities.

=== Collars ===

Many submissives in a submissive relationship wear a collar to indicate their submissive status and commitment. It can be much like a wedding band, except that only the submissive partner wears one. The traditional collar is a neck band in leather or metal, chosen, designed, and even crafted by the dominant partner. Some subs may wear a &quot;symbolic collar&quot;, often a bracelet or ankle chain, which is more subdued than the traditional collar and can pass in non-BDSM situations. It is not uncommon for a sub to have several collars for special occasions. Collars are integral for animal roleplay.

Many people—for example, some in the punk rock and goth subcultures—wear collars for other reasons, such as fashion. So, one cannot assume that all people wearing collars are involved in BDSM. Members of the furry fandom may also wear collars as a part of costuming or as fashion. Use of collars in the sexual aspects of furry lifestyle may or may not be connected to BDSM, depending on the individual&#x27;s preferences.

==Art and culture==
===Literature===

One of the most famous works in this area is Leopold von Sacher-Masoch&#x27;s &quot;Venus im Pelz&quot; (&quot;Venus in Furs&quot;, 1869), in which the protagonist, Severin, persuades a woman, Wanda, to take him on as her slave, serves her, and allows her to degrade him. The book has elements of both social and physical submission, and is the genesis of the term &quot;masochism&quot; coined by the 19th-century psychiatrist Krafft-Ebing.

<doc id="1343964" wikidata="Q7592555" url="?curid=1343964" title="St Augustine Gospels">
<text>The St Augustine Gospels (Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, Lib. MS. 286) is an illuminated Gospel Book which dates from the 6th century and has been in the Parker Library in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge since 1575. It was made in Italy and has been in England since fairly soon after its creation; by the 16th century it had probably already been at Canterbury for almost a thousand years. It has 265 leaves measuring about 252 x 196 mm, and is not entirely complete, in particular missing pages with miniatures.

This manuscript is the oldest surviving illustrated Latin (rather than Greek or Syriac) Gospel Book, and one of the oldest European books in existence. Although the only surviving illuminations are two full-page miniatures, these are of great significance in art history as so few comparable images have survived. &quot;When this manuscript was made, Latin was still generally spoken, and Jerome [author of the Vulgate translation, of which this text is a copy], who died in 420, was then no more distant in time than (say) Walter Scott or Emily Brontë are to us.&quot;

The Church of England calls the book the Canterbury Gospels, though to scholars this name usually refers to another book, an 8th-century Anglo-Saxon gospel book written at Canterbury, now with one portion in the British Library as &quot;Royal MS 1 E VI&quot;, and another in the Library of Canterbury Cathedral.

==History==
The manuscript is traditionally, and plausibly, considered to be either a volume brought by St Augustine to England with the Gregorian mission in 597, or one of a number of books recorded as being sent to him in 601 by Pope Gregory the Great – like other scholars, Kurt Weitzmann sees &quot;no reason to doubt&quot; the tradition. The main text is written in an Italian uncial hand which is widely accepted as dating to the 6th century – Rome or Monte Cassino have been suggested as the place of creation. It was certainly in England by the late 7th or early 8th century when corrections and additions were made to the text in an insular hand. The additions included &quot;tituli&quot; or captions to the scenes around the portrait of Luke, not all of which may reflect the intentions of the original artist.

The book was certainly at St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, Canterbury in the 10th century, when the first of several documents concerning the Abbey were copied into it. In the late Middle Ages it was &quot;kept not in the Library at Canterbury but actually lay on the altar; it belonged in other words, like a reliquary or the Cross, to Church ceremonial&quot;. The manuscript was given to the Parker Library, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge as part of the collection donated by Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury in 1575, some decades after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. It was traditionally used for the swearing of the oath in the enthronements of new Archbishops of Canterbury, and the tradition has been restored since 1945; the book is taken to Canterbury Cathedral by the Parker librarian of Corpus for each ceremony. The Augustine Gospels have also been taken to Canterbury for other major occasions: the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1982, and the celebrations in 1997 for the 1,400th anniversary of the Gregorian mission. In 2023 the Gospels were carried in the procession at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla. As far as is known it is the first time they have been used in a coronation. The book was open at the page with the portrait of Saint Luke.

The manuscript was rebound at the British Museum in 1948–49 with plain oak boards and a spine of cream alum-tawed goatskin.

== Text ==
The manuscript is &quot;more or less the oldest substantially complete copy&quot; of Jerome&#x27;s translation of the Gospels. His late-4th-century Vulgate gradually replaced the earlier Vetus Latina (&quot;Old Latin&quot;) text used by Christians in the Roman Empire. A 1933 analysis of the St Augustine Gospels by Hermann Glunz documented around 700 variants from the standard Vulgate: most are minor differences of spelling or word order, but in some cases the scribe chooses readings from the Vetus Latina. This supports the St Augustine connection, as Gregory the Great, the supposed donor, wrote in his &quot;Moralia&quot; that he was using the more fluent Vulgate, except for certain passages where he found the Old Latin more suitable, and his &quot;Forty Homilies on the Gospels&quot; opts for the older translation in the same places as the St Augustine Gospels.

==Miniatures==

The manuscript once contained evangelist portraits for all four Evangelists, preceding their gospel, a usual feature of illuminated Gospel books, and at least three further pages of narrative scenes, one following each portrait page. Only the two pages preceding Luke have survived. However the surviving total of twenty-four small scenes from the &quot;Life of Christ&quot; are very rare survivals and of great interest in the history of Christian iconography, especially as they come from the old Western Empire – the only comparable narrative Gospel cycles from manuscripts in the period are Greek, notably the Rossano Gospels, and Sinope Gospels, or the Syriac Rabbula Gospels. The equivalent Old Testament cycles are more varied however, including the Greek Vienna Genesis and Cotton Genesis, the Latin Ashburnham Pentateuch, the Quedlinburg &quot;Itala&quot; fragment, and some others.

The miniatures have moved further from classical style than those in the Greek manuscripts, with &quot;a linear style which not only flattens the figure, but begins to develop a rhythmic quality in the linear design which must be seen as the beginning of a process of intentional abstraction&quot;. For another historian, the figures in the small scenes have &quot;a linear form which we immediately perceive to be medieval&quot; and &quot;are no longer paintings, but tinted drawings. The same tendency is exhibited in the treatment of the architecture and ornament; the naturalistic polychrome accessories of a manuscript like the Vienna Dioscurides are flattened and attenuated into a calligraphic pattern.&quot;

The subject of the influence of the miniatures on later Anglo-Saxon art has often been raised, though in view of most of the presumed picture pages of this manuscript now being lost, and the lack of knowledge as to what other models were available to form the Continental post-classical aspects of the Insular style that developed from the 7th century onwards (with Canterbury as a major centre), all comments by art historians have necessarily been speculative. It is clear from the variety of styles of evangelist portraits found in early Insular manuscripts, echoing examples known from the Continent, that other models were available, and there is a record of an illuminated and imported &quot;Bible of St Gregory&quot; at Canterbury in the 7th century. Later works mentioned as probably influenced by the Augustine Gospels include the Stockholm Codex Aureus and the St Gall Gospel Book. In general, though evangelist portraits became a common feature of Insular and Anglo-Saxon Gospel books, the large number of small scenes in the Augustine Gospels were not seen again until much later works like the Eadwine Psalter, made in the 12th century in Canterbury, which has prefatory pages with small narrative images in grids in a similar style to the Augustine Gospels.

===Evangelist portrait of Luke===
Of the four portrait pages, only that for Luke survives (Folio 129v). He is shown sitting on a marble throne, with a cushion, in an elaborate architectural setting, probably based on the scaenae frons of a Roman theatre – a common convention for Late Antique miniatures, coins and Imperial portraiture. The pose with the chin resting on a hand suggests an origin in classical author portraits of philosophers – more often evangelists are shown writing. Above a cornice sits the winged ox, Luke&#x27;s evangelist&#x27;s symbol. The pediment has an inscription with a hexameter from the &quot;Carmen Paschale&quot; by the 5th-century Christian poet Coelius Sedulius (Book 1, line 357): &quot;Iura sacerdotii Lucas tenet ore iuvenci&quot; – &quot;Luke holds the laws of priesthood in the mouth of the young bull&quot; (&quot;iuvencus&quot; meaning also &quot;young man&quot;). 
More unusually, twelve small scenes drawn from Luke, mostly of the &quot;Works of Christ&quot; (who can be identified as the only figure with a halo), are set between columns in the architectural frame to the portrait. This particular arrangement is unique in surviving early evangelist portraits, though similar strips of scenes are found in ivory book-covers from the same period. The scenes themselves probably drew from a now-destroyed fresco cycle of the &quot;Life of Christ&quot; in Santa Maria Antiqua in Rome.

The scenes, many of which were rarely depicted in art from later medieval periods, include:
* &quot;The Annunciation to Zechariah&quot; (left, top, Luke 1, 8–20), as he officiates at the Temple
* &quot;Christ among the Doctors&quot; (left, 2nd down, Luke 2, 43–50) which omits Saint Joseph, probably from lack of space; Mary enters to the left.
* &quot;Christ preaching from the boat&quot; (left, 3rd down, Luke 5, 3)
* &quot;The Calling of Peter&quot; (left, 4th down, Luke 5, 8)
* &quot;The Miracle of the son of the widow of Naim&quot;, (left, 5th down, Luke 7, 12–16) at the &quot;gate of the city&quot;.
* &quot;The Calling of Matthew&quot;, a very rare scene (left bottom, Luke 5, 27–32).
* &quot;...And behold a certain lawyer stood up, tempting him and saying, Master, what must I do to possess eternal life?&quot; (right, top: Luke 10, 25)
* &quot;...a certain woman from the crowd, lifting up her voice, said to him...&quot; (right 2nd down, Luke 11, 27–28): &quot;extollens vocem quaedam mulier de turba&quot;.
* &quot;The Miracle of the Bent Woman&quot; (right 3rd down, Luke 13, 10–17), though labelled with text from Luke 9, 58: &quot;Foxes have holes&quot; (see below).
* The one leper out of the ten (?), Luke 17, 12–19
* &quot;The Healing of the Man with Dropsy&quot; (Luke 14, 2–5)
* &quot;The Calling of Zacchaeus&quot; (right, bottom), who had climbed a tree to see Christ better (Luke 19, 1–10).

The captions in the margins, added later, probably in the 8th century from the handwriting, name the scenes or are quotations or near-quotations from the Vulgate text of Luke identifying them. For example, the top right caption reads: &quot;legis peritus surrexit temptans illum&quot; or &quot;[a] lawyer stood up, tempting him&quot;, from Luke 10, 25. The caption two below this one may misidentify the scene depicted, according to Carol Lewine. Even those, like Francis Wormold, who support the caption, admit the scene could not be so identified without it. The caption reads:&quot;Ih[esu]s dixit vulpes fossa habent&quot;, a paraphrase of the start of Luke 9, 58 (and Matthew 8, 20): &quot;et ait illi Iesus vulpes foveas habent et volucres caeli nidos Filius autem hominis non habet ubi caput reclinet&quot; – &quot;Jesus said to him: The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests: but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.&quot; The image shows Jesus blessing a bent figure, which could match the quotation, or a miracle.

===Passion scenes===

A full-page miniature on folio 125r prior to Luke contains twelve narrative scenes from the &quot;Life of Christ&quot;, all from the Passion except the &quot;Raising of Lazarus&quot;. This was included because, following John 11.46 ff. it was considered the immediate cause of the Sanhedrin&#x27;s decision to move against Christ. As in the few other surviving cycles of the &quot;Life&quot; from the 6th century, the Crucifixion itself is not shown, the sequence ending with &quot;Christ carrying the Cross&quot;. However at least two further such pages once existed, at the start of other Gospels. Luke is the third gospel, so a panel preceding the Gospel of John might well have completed the Passion and Resurrection story, and two others covered the earlier life of Christ. The scenes around Luke&#x27;s portrait notably avoid the major episodes in Christ&#x27;s life such as his Nativity, Baptism and Temptation, probably reserving these scenes for other grid pages.

Compared to other cycles of the time, such as that in mosaic at the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna, the Passion scenes show an emphasis on the suffering of Christ that was probably influenced by the art of the Eastern Empire and shows the direction Western depictions were to follow in subsequent centuries.

From top left the twelve scenes shown, some of which have captions, are:
* Christ&#x27;s entry into Jerusalem
* Last Supper, the earliest Western image to show the moment of the first Eucharist, rather than the betrayal of Judas.
* Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane
* Raising of Lazarus
* Washing of feet
* Betrayal of Christ
* Arrest of Jesus
* Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus
* Mocking of Christ
* Pontius Pilate washes his hands
* Christ led from Pilate,
* Simon of Cyrene helps Christ carrying the Cross

In contrast to the scenes around the portrait, all of these scenes except &quot;Christ led from Pilate&quot; were to remain very common in large narrative cycles throughout the Middle Ages and beyond. The difficulty of identifying many of the episodes of the &quot;Works&quot; from Luke demonstrates one of the reasons why scenes from the period of Christ&#x27;s ministry became increasingly less common in medieval art. Another reason for this was the lack of feast-days celebrating them. The two scenes at the top of the central column on the &quot;Passion&quot; page, in contrast, feature in the gospel reading set for Maundy Thursday, and most of the scenes on this page are easily identified. The &quot;Raising of Lazarus&quot;, with the body in its white winding-cloth, was one miracle that was easily recognised in images, and remained in the usual repertoire of artists. The Hand of God in the &quot;Agony in the Garden&quot; is the earliest surviving example of the motif in this scene.

<text>Commodore Lewis Warrington (3 November 1782 – 12 October 1851) was a United States Navy officer who saw action during the First Barbary War and the War of 1812 and temporarily served as the secretary of the Navy.

==Life and career==
Born at Williamsburg, Virginia on 3 November 1782, Warrington was the illegitimate son of Rachel Warrington and Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau, who was stationed in Williamsburg during the winter of 1781–1782, following the battle of Yorktown. The matter of his parentage has long been confused by historians and writers, as other French officers, such Louis-François-Bertrand du Pont d&#x27;Aubevoye de Lauberdière, recorded flirtations with a number of Williamsburg&#x27;s women, including Rachel Warrington and her sister Cecilia, at the same time. However, more recent research has discovered extended unsuccessful attempts by members of his mother&#x27;s family to persuade Rochambeau to openly acknowledge his child, along with indications that Rochambeau offered to legitimize his son after Warrington had achieved success and notoriety.

He briefly attended the College of William &amp; Mary before accepting an appointment as a midshipman in the Navy on 6 January 1800. His first duty, aboard the frigate &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, took him to the West Indies, where his ship cruised with a squadron during the last year of the Quasi-War with France. His ship appears to have engaged in one action near the end of the cruise. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1801, she took the French privateer &quot;La Jeune Creole&quot;.

Following the cessation of hostilities with France, Midshipman Warrington remained in the Navy. His ship spent most of 1801 in ordinary at Norfolk, Virginia. The following year, Warrington was transferred to the frigate &quot;President&quot; for service in the Mediterranean against the Barbary pirates. Over the next five years, he remained with the Mediterranean Squadron, serving successively aboard the &quot;President&quot;, &quot;Vixen&quot;, and &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Promoted to lieutenant in February 1807, he returned home to assume command of a gunboat at Norfolk. In 1809, Lt. Warrington voyaged to Europe aboard the &quot;Syren&quot; as a dispatch courier. He next served a tour of duty in &quot;Essex&quot;.

When the War of 1812 with the British Empire began in June 1812, Warrington was aboard the frigate USS &quot;Congress&quot; serving as the ship&#x27;s first lieutenant while she patrolled the North Atlantic. During his tour of duty aboard &quot;Congress&quot;, she made two cruises, capturing nine British prizes off the east coast of the United States during the first and four off the Atlantic seaboard of South America during the second.

Promoted to Master Commandant in July 1813, he took command of the sloop-of-war USS &quot;Peacock&quot; later in the year. On 12 March 1814, he put to sea with his new command bound for the naval station at St. Mary&#x27;s, Georgia. After delivering supplies to that installation, he encountered the Royal Navy brig &quot;Epervier&quot; off Cape Canaveral, Florida. &quot;Peacock&quot; emerged victorious from a brisk 45-minute exchange with &quot;Epervier&quot;, killing 8 and wounding 15 of her crew and capturing the ship. For his role in the victory, Warrington received the Thanks of Congress in the form of a Congressional Gold Medal, and of the state of Virginia in the form of a gold-hilted sword. He was also elected an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati.

Warrington took his prize into Savannah, Georgia, and then embarked upon his second cruise on 4 June. On that voyage, which took him to the Grand Banks, the Irish coast, the Shetland Islands, and the Faroe Islands, he took fourteen British prizes.

After returning via the West Indies to New York, Warrington took &quot;Peacock&quot; on her third and final war cruise. His sloop-of-war stood out of New York with the &quot;Hornet&quot; and &quot;Tom Bowline&quot; on 23 January 1815, sailed around the Cape of Good Hope, and entered the Indian Ocean. Unaware that peace had been concluded in December 1814 at Ghent, Belgium, Warrington led his ships on another foray against British commerce. After taking three British prizes in the Indian Ocean, he entered the East Indies in search of more targets. On 30 June, he encountered the East India Company brig &quot;Nautilus&quot; in the Sunda Strait and attacked her, despite having been told that peace had been concluded. After a sharp, unequal action which cost &quot;Nautilus&quot; 15 men including her first lieutenant, she surrendered to Warrington. Warrington then released the prize and started for home. &quot;Peacock&quot; arrived back in New York on 30 October 1815.
In 1816, he commanded &quot;Macedonian&quot; briefly for a voyage to Cartagena, Spain, to convey there Christopher Hughes, the representative of the United States at negotiations over the release of some Americans imprisoned by Spanish authorities. In 1819 and 1820, Captain Warrington commanded &quot;Java&quot;, followed by &quot;Guerriere&quot; in 1820 and 1821. Each ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron during his tenure as her commanding officer. Captain Warrington returned home and received orders to duty at the Norfolk Navy Yard. In February 1825, he relieved David Porter as commander of the West Indian Squadron during the latter stages of the piracy suppression campaign and thereafter bore the title, commodore.

In 1826, Warrington served as one of three commissioners on a panel charged with selecting a site on which to establish a new South Atlantic fleet. The panel selected Pensacola, Florida - site of the first permanent European settlement in North America in the year 1559 - and Warrington was ordered to Pensacola where he was charged with overseeing the construction of a new navy yard. Warrington established a village adjacent to the new navy yard and gave it his name. Warrington Village remained occupied until the 1930s when the property was transitioned for use in naval aviation and the residents were relocated. Many residents moved just outside the navy base, and established a New Warrington. Today, the diverse community is known simply as Warrington. In 1829, Lewis Warrington was promoted and returned to Norfolk for a decade as commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard. In 1840, he was reassigned to Washington for another two years as commissioner on the Navy Board. After the 1842 reorganization of the Navy Department, Warrington became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks.

On 28 February 1844, he took over temporarily the duties of the Secretary of the Navy after Secretary Thomas W. Gilmer died as a result of wounds received when the large cannon &quot;Peacemaker&quot; exploded during a firing demonstration on board &quot;Princeton&quot; at Washington. Near the end of March, Warrington relinquished those duties to the new secretary, John Y. Mason, and resumed his former assignment. In 1846, he became Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, which office he held until his death on 12 October 1851. He was buried at Congressional Cemetery at a service attended by President Millard Fillmore, members of the Cabinet, and a crowd of other dignitaries.

==Text of Congressional Gold Medal==
:Friday, 21 October 1814

:Resolution, expressive of the sense of Congress relative to the victory of the &quot;Peacock&quot; over the &quot;Epervier&quot;.

:Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That the President of the United States be requested to present to Captain Lewis Warrington, of the sloop of war &quot;Peacock&quot;, a gold medal, with suitable emblems and devices, and a silver medal, with like emblems and devices, to each of the commissioned officers, and a sword to each of the midshipmen, and to the sailing master of the said vessel, in testimony of the high sense entertained by Congress of the gallantry and good conduct of the officers and crew, in the action with the British brig &quot;Epervier&quot;, on the twenty-ninth day of April, in the year one thousand eight hundred and fourteen, in which action the decisive effect and great superiority of the American gunnery were so signally displayed.

==Legacy==
Three ships in the United States Navy have been named USS &quot;Warrington&quot; for him.

<text>Thursday October Christian II was a Pitcairn Islands political leader. He was the grandson of Fletcher Christian and son of Thursday October Christian, and mother, Teraura. He was also known as &quot;Doctor&quot;, &quot;Duddie&quot; or &quot;Doodie&quot;. He spent several years on Norfolk Island but returned to Pitcairn in 1864. Christian was three quarters Polynesian.

He was the fifth Magistrate of the Pitcairn Islands, holding the office in 1844, 1851, 1864, 1867, 1873–1874, 1880 and 1882. Everyone named Christian on Pitcairn is descended from him; a number of family branches, however, left Pitcairn permanently and settled on Norfolk Island.

He married Mary Young, granddaughter of Ned Young, on 24 March 1839.

<doc id="1343973" wikidata="Q1232627" url="?curid=1343973" title="Nevada Smith">
<text>Nevada Smith is a 1966 American Western film directed by Henry Hathaway and starring Steve McQueen, Karl Malden, Brian Keith, Arthur Kennedy and Suzanne Pleshette. The film was made by Solar Productions in association with and released by Paramount Pictures.

The movie is a prequel to &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot;, a highly successful film from two years earlier based on the 1961 Harold Robbins novel. In that film, Alan Ladd played an older version of Nevada Smith, the character McQueen plays in this film.

&quot;Nevada Smith&quot; depicts Smith&#x27;s first meeting with another &quot;Carpetbaggers&quot; character, Jonas Cord Sr, and delves into Nevada Smith&#x27;s background as summarized in a scene from the original film.

==Plot==
In the 1890s American West, outlaws Bill Bowdre, Jesse Coe and Tom Fitch seek to rob Max&#x27;s father of the gold they believe he has. When it becomes evident that there is none, they torture and brutally kill the white father and Kiowa mother of young Max Sand. Max sets out to avenge their deaths.

While traveling in the desert, Max uncovers a rusty old gun. Coming upon Jonas Cord, a traveling gunsmith, Max tries to rob him. Cord, recognizing that Max&#x27;s revolver is non-functional, convinces Max he has failed. Max tells Cord about his vengeful journey. Cord, empathetic, shelters him and teaches him to shoot. Max hunts the killers, who have since separated. He tracks down Jesse Coe to Abilene, Texas. With help from Neesa, a Kiowa dance hall girl, he identifies and confronts Coe in a saloon. A knife fight ensues in a nearby corral. Coe is killed, but Max is severely wounded. Neesa takes him to her tribe&#x27;s camp and nurses him back to health. Soon after, they become lovers.

Once recovered, Max continues his pursuit. He learns that Bowdre is in a prison camp located deep within Louisiana&#x27;s swamps. Max deliberately commits a bank robbery to be sent to the same prison as Bowdre. Max persuades Bowdre to escape with him, planning to kill him in the swamp. Pilar, a local Cajun girl working in the rice fields near the convicts&#x27; camp, agrees to help Max. Unaware of Max&#x27;s plan to kill Bowdre, she obtains a boat and navigates the trio through the swamp. The boat capsizes early on, and Pilar is bitten by a poisonous snake. Max kills Bowdre, but Pilar eventually succumbs to the venom of the snakebite.

Max has escaped and is now hunting Fitch, the last murderer. Still blinded by revenge, Max infiltrates Fitch&#x27;s gang, calling himself Nevada Smith. Fitch knows Max Sand has killed Coe and Bowdre and is coming for him. Although Fitch accepts Nevada into the gang, he is wary. As the gang rides out to commit a gold-transport robbery, Max is spotted by Cord, who calls out his name. Max ignores him and the gang rides on. Fitch now suspects one of his men is Max. As the gang greedily scoops up the stolen gold, Max watches from a hill. Fitch, realizing Smith is actually Sand, grabs his share and flees. Max pursues him and corners him at a creek. Fitch tries shooting Sand while pretending to surrender, but Sand, faster, shoots Fitch&#x27;s hand.

Fitch gives up and wants Max to quickly kill him. Max shoots Fitch several more times, inflicting painful but non-fatal wounds. As Fitch lies in the creek, bleeding profusely, Max demands Fitch beg for his life. Fitch calls Max a coward for refusing to kill him. Max decides Fitch is not worth killing and rides away as Fitch continues shouting at Max to kill him.

The music is by Alfred Newman and the cinematography, shot in Eastmancolor and Panavision, by Lucien Ballard.

&quot;Nevada Smith&quot; was shot in approximately 46 different locations in the Inyo National Forest, in parts of Southern California and Southwestern Nevada, and in the Owens Valley of Southern California in the Eastern Sierra Mountains. The swamp scenes were filmed in Krotz Springs, Louisiana.

== Reception ==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; holds a score of 50% based on 8 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film is &quot;stifled by uneven acting, often lethargic direction, and awkward sensation-shock values&quot;, and that &quot;overlength serves to dull the often spectacular production values&quot;.

<text>Deontic logic is the field of philosophical logic that is concerned with obligation, permission, and related concepts. Alternatively, a deontic logic is a formal system that attempts to capture the essential logical features of these concepts. It can be used to formalize imperative logic, or directive modality in natural languages. Typically, a deontic logic uses &quot;OA&quot; to mean &quot;it is obligatory that A&quot; (or &quot;it ought to be (the case) that A&quot;), and &quot;PA&quot; to mean &quot;it is permitted (or permissible) that A&quot;, which is defined as formula_1.

In natural language, the statement &quot;You may go to the zoo OR the park&quot; should be understood as formula_2 instead of formula_3, as both options are permitted by the statement. When there are multiple agents involved in the domain of discourse, the deontic modal operator can be specified to each agent to express their individual obligations and permissions. For example, by using a subscript formula_4 for agent formula_5, formula_6 means that &quot;It is an obligation for agent formula_5 (to bring it about/make it happen) that formula_8&quot;. Note that formula_8 could be stated as an action by another agent; One example is &quot;It is an obligation for Adam that Bob doesn&#x27;t crash the car&quot;, which would be represented as formula_10, where B=&quot;Bob doesn&#x27;t crash the car&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;deontic&quot; is derived from the (gen.: ), meaning &quot;that which is binding or proper.&quot;

==Standard deontic logic==
In Georg Henrik von Wright&#x27;s first system, obligatoriness and permissibility were treated as features of &quot;acts&quot;. Soon after this, it was found that a deontic logic of &quot;propositions&quot; could be given a simple and elegant Kripke-style semantics, and von Wright himself joined this movement. The deontic logic so specified came to be known as &quot;standard deontic logic,&quot; often referred to as SDL, KD, or simply D. It can be axiomatized by adding the following axioms to a standard axiomatization of classical propositional logic:

: formula_11
: formula_12
: formula_13

In English, these axioms say, respectively:

* If A is a tautology, then it ought to be that A (necessitation rule N). In other words, contradictions are not permitted.
* If it ought to be that A implies B, then if it ought to be that A, it ought to be that B (modal axiom K).
* If it ought to be that A, then it is permitted that A (modal axiom D). In other words, if it&#x27;s not permitted that A, then it&#x27;s not obligatory that A.

&quot;FA&quot;, meaning it is forbidden that &quot;A&quot;, can be defined (equivalently) as formula_14 or formula_15.

There are two main extensions of SDL that are usually considered. The first results by adding an alethic modal operator formula_16 in order to express the Kantian claim that &quot;ought implies can&quot;:

: formula_17

where formula_18. It is generally assumed that formula_16 is at least a KT operator, but most commonly it is taken to be an S5 operator. In practical situations, obligations are usually assigned in anticipation of future events, in which case alethic possibilities can be hard to judge. Therefore, obligation assignments may be performed under the assumption of different conditions on different branches of timelines in the future, and past obligation assignments may be updated due to unforeseen developments that happened along the timeline.

The other main extension results by adding a &quot;conditional obligation&quot; operator O(A/B) read &quot;It is obligatory that A given (or conditional on) B&quot;. Motivation for a conditional operator is given by considering the following (&quot;Good Samaritan&quot;) case. It seems true that the starving and poor ought to be fed. But that the starving and poor are fed implies that there are starving and poor. By basic principles of SDL we can infer that there ought to be starving and poor! The argument is due to the basic K axiom of SDL together with the following principle valid in any normal modal logic:

:formula_20

If we introduce an intensional conditional operator then we can say that the starving ought to be fed &quot;only on the condition that there are in fact starving&quot;: in symbols O(A/B). But then the following argument fails on the usual (e.g. Lewis 73) semantics for conditionals: from O(A/B) and that A implies B, infer OB.

Indeed, one might define the unary operator O in terms of the binary conditional one O(A/B) as formula_21, where formula_22 stands for an arbitrary tautology of the underlying logic (which, in the case of SDL, is classical). 

=== Semantics of standard deontic logic ===
The accessibility relation between possible world is interpreted as &quot;acceptability&quot; relations: formula_23 is an acceptable world (viz. formula_24) if and only if all the obligations in formula_25 are fulfilled in formula_23 (viz. formula_27).

=== Anderson&#x27;s deontic logic ===
Alan R. Anderson (1959) shows how to define formula_28 in terms of the alethic operator formula_16 and a deontic constant (i.e. 0-ary modal operator) formula_30 standing for some sanction (i.e. bad thing, prohibition, etc.): formula_31. Intuitively, the right side of the biconditional says that A&#x27;s failing to hold necessarily (or strictly) implies a sanction.

In addition to the usual modal axioms (necessitation rule N and distribution axiom K) for the alethic operator formula_16, Anderson&#x27;s deontic logic only requires one additional axiom for the deontic constant formula_30: formula_34, which means that there is alethically possible to fulfill all obligations and avoid the sanction. This version of the Anderson&#x27;s deontic logic is equivalent to SDL.

However, when modal axiom T is included for the alethic operator (formula_35), it can be proved in Anderson&#x27;s deontic logic that formula_36, which is not included in SDL. Anderson&#x27;s deontic logic inevitably couples the deontic operator formula_28 with the alethic operator formula_16, which can be problematic in certain cases.

==Dyadic deontic logic==
An important problem of deontic logic is that of how to properly represent conditional obligations, e.g. &quot;If you smoke (s), then you ought to use an ashtray (a). &quot; It is not clear that either of the following representations is adequate:

: formula_39
: formula_40

Under the first representation it is vacuously true that if you commit a forbidden act, then you ought to commit any other act, regardless of whether that second act was obligatory, permitted or forbidden (Von Wright 1956, cited in Aqvist 1994). Under the second representation, we are vulnerable to the gentle murder paradox, where the plausible statements (1) &quot;if you murder, you ought to murder gently&quot;, (2) &quot;you do commit murder&quot;, and (3) &quot;to murder gently you must murder&quot; imply the less plausible statement: &quot;you ought to murder&quot;. Others argue that &quot;must&quot; in the phrase &quot;to murder gently you must murder&quot; is a mistranslation from the ambiguous English word (meaning either &quot;implies&quot; or &quot;ought&quot;). Interpreting &quot;must&quot; as &quot;implies&quot; does not allow one to conclude &quot;you ought to murder&quot; but only a repetition of the given &quot;you murder&quot;. Misinterpreting &quot;must&quot; as &quot;ought&quot; results in a perverse axiom, not a perverse logic. With use of negations one can easily check if the ambiguous word was mistranslated by considering which of the following two English statements is equivalent with the statement &quot;to murder gently you must murder&quot;: is it equivalent to &quot;if you murder gently it is forbidden not to murder&quot; or &quot;if you murder gently it is impossible not to murder&quot; ?

Some deontic logicians have responded to this problem by developing dyadic deontic logics, which contain binary deontic operators:

: formula_41 means &quot;it is obligatory that A, given B&quot;
: formula_42 means &quot;it is permissible that A, given B&quot;.

(The notation is modeled on that used to represent conditional probability.) Dyadic deontic logic escapes some of the problems of standard (unary) deontic logic, but it is subject to some problems of its own.

==Other variations==
Many other varieties of deontic logic have been developed, including non-monotonic deontic logics, paraconsistent deontic logics, dynamic deontic logics, and hyperintensional deontic logics.

==History==

===Early deontic logic===
Philosophers from the Indian Mimamsa school to those of Ancient Greece have remarked on the formal logical relations of deontic concepts and philosophers from the late Middle Ages compared deontic concepts with alethic ones.

In his &quot;Elementa juris naturalis&quot; (written between 1669 and 1671), Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz notes the logical relations between the &quot;licitum&quot; (permitted), the &quot;illicitum&quot; (prohibited), the &quot;debitum&quot; (obligatory), and the &quot;indifferens&quot; (facultative) are equivalent to those between the &quot;possibile&quot;, the &quot;impossibile&quot;, the &quot;necessarium&quot;, and the &quot;contingens&quot; respectively.

===Mally&#x27;s first deontic logic and von Wright&#x27;s first &quot;plausible&quot; deontic logic===
Ernst Mally, a pupil of Alexius Meinong, was the first to propose a formal system of deontic logic in his &quot;Grundgesetze des Sollens&quot; (1926) and he founded it on the syntax of Whitehead&#x27;s and Russell&#x27;s propositional calculus. Mally&#x27;s deontic vocabulary consisted of the logical constants formula_43 and formula_44, unary connective formula_45, and binary connectives formula_46 and formula_47.
: * Mally read formula_48 as &quot;A ought to be the case&quot;.* He read formula_49 as &quot;A requires B&quot; .* He read formula_50 as &quot;A and B require each other.&quot;* He read formula_43 as &quot;the unconditionally obligatory&quot; .* He read formula_44 as &quot;the unconditionally forbidden&quot;.
Mally defined formula_46, formula_47, and formula_44 as follows:
: Def. formula_56Def. formula_57Def. formula_58
Mally proposed five informal principles:
: (i) If A requires B and if B requires C, then A requires C.(ii) If A requires B and if A requires C, then A requires B and C.(iii) A requires B if and only if it is obligatory that if A then B.(iv) The unconditionally obligatory is obligatory.(v) The unconditionally obligatory does not require its own negation.
He formalized these principles and took them as his axioms:
: I. formula_59II. formula_60III. formula_61IV. formula_62V. formula_63
From these axioms Mally deduced 35 theorems, many of which he rightly considered strange. Karl Menger showed that formula_64 is a theorem and thus that the introduction of the ! sign is irrelevant and that A ought to be the case if A is the case. After Menger, philosophers no longer considered Mally&#x27;s system viable.

The first plausible system of deontic logic was proposed by G. H. von Wright in his paper &quot;Deontic Logic&quot; in the philosophical journal &quot;Mind&quot; in 1951. (Von Wright was also the first to use the term &quot;deontic&quot; in English to refer to this kind of logic although Mally published the German paper &quot;Deontik&quot; in 1926.) Since the publication of von Wright&#x27;s seminal paper, many philosophers and computer scientists have investigated and developed systems of deontic logic. Nevertheless, to this day deontic logic remains one of the most controversial and least agreed-upon areas of logic.
G. H. von Wright did not base his 1951 deontic logic on the syntax of the propositional calculus as Mally had done, but was instead influenced by alethic modal logics, which Mally had not benefited from. In 1964, von Wright published &quot;A New System of Deontic Logic&quot;, which was a return to the syntax of the propositional calculus and thus a significant return to Mally&#x27;s system. (For more on von Wright&#x27;s departure from and return to the syntax of the propositional calculus, see &quot;Deontic Logic: A Personal View&quot; and &quot;A New System of Deontic Logic&quot;, both by Georg Henrik von Wright.) G. H. von Wright&#x27;s adoption of the modal logic of possibility and necessity for the purposes of normative reasoning was a return to Leibniz.

Although von Wright&#x27;s system represented a significant improvement over Mally&#x27;s, it raised a number of problems of its own. For example, &quot;Ross&#x27;s paradox&quot; applies to von Wright&#x27;s deontic logic, allowing us to infer from &quot;It is obligatory that the letter is mailed&quot; to &quot;It is obligatory that either the letter is mailed or the letter is burned&quot;, which seems to imply it is permissible that the letter is burned. The &quot;Good Samaritan paradox&quot; also applies to his system, allowing us to infer from &quot;It is obligatory to nurse the man who has been robbed&quot; that &quot;It is obligatory that the man has been robbed&quot;. Another major source of puzzlement is &quot;Chisholm&#x27;s paradox&quot;, named after American philosopher and logician Roderick Chisholm. There is no formalisation in von Wright&#x27;s system of the following claims that allows them to be both jointly satisfiable and logically independent:
* It ought to be that Jones goes (to the assistance of his neighbors).
* It ought to be that if Jones goes, then he tells them he is coming.
* If Jones doesn&#x27;t go, then he ought not tell them he is coming.
* Jones doesn&#x27;t go

Several extensions or revisions of Standard Deontic Logic have been proposed over the years, with a view to solve these and other puzzles and paradoxes (such as the Gentle Murderer and Free choice permission).

==Jørgensen&#x27;s dilemma==
Deontic logic faces Jørgensen&#x27;s dilemma. This problem is best seen as a trilemma. The following three claims are incompatible:
* Logical inference requires that the elements (premises and conclusions) have truth-values.
* Normative statements do not have truth-values.
* There are logical inferences between normative statements.
Responses to this problem involve rejecting one of the three premises.

# Input/output logics reject the first premise. They provide inference mechanism on elements without presupposing that these elements have truth-values.
# Alternatively, one can deny the second premise. One way to do this is to distinguish between the norm itself and a proposition about the norm. According to this response, only the proposition about the norm (as is the case for Standard Deontic Logic) has a truth-value. For example, it may be hard to assign a truth-value to the argument &quot;Take all the books off the table!&quot;, but formula_28(&quot;Take all the books off the table&quot;), which means &quot;It is obligatory to take all the books off the table&quot;, can be assigned a truth-value, because it is in the indicative mood.
# Finally, one can deny the third premise. But this is to deny that there is a logic of norms worth investigating.

<text>Elex Media Komputindo is a publishing company in Indonesia that publishes books, comics, magazines, novels and other print media. Established on January 15, 1985, Elex Media Komputindo is a subsidiary of Kompas Gramedia Group. Elex is headquartered in Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta.

Elex Media Komputindo is known as the pioneer of manga publishing in Indonesia, and is now one of the largest comic publishers in Indonesia.

== History ==
Established in 1985, Elex Media initially published various electronic and computer-themed books. The founder of Kompas, Jakob Oetama, was interested in the potential of manga during his visit to Japan in the late 1980s. In 1991, Elex Media plunged into the manga publishing industry with the publication of Kyoko Mizuki&#x27;s &quot;Candy Candy&quot; manga, originally published by Kodansha. Other manga like &quot;Kungfu Boy&quot;, &quot;Doraemon&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; began to follow. The decision of the New Order government to allow the establishment of private television stations was also influential in the spread of outside culture, including the manga. Various private television stations licensed and broadcast Japanese anime which also influenced the interest of comic and manga lovers in Indonesia. Indonesian local comics began to appear in 1994 with the publication of the &quot;Imperium Majapahit&quot; (Majapahit Empire) by Jan Mintaraga. Elex Media began to adopt the Japanese manga style publishing in 1995 and applied it to local comics in 2001. As of December 2008, almost 7500 comic volumes had been published.

Elex Media established their adult manga imprint, Level Comics in 2005. Their manga titles including &quot;20th Century Boys&quot;, &quot;Homunculus&quot;, &quot;Vagabond&quot;, &quot;Shin Angyo Onshi&quot;, and &quot;Soul Eater&quot;. They also adopted the age rating system for its readers. All adult-themed comics and manga are published under the Level Comics label, while Elex Media is responsible for publishing comics in all age categories or teenagers. In determining the age rating of an individual comic, Elex Media doesn&#x27;t follow the rating standards in Japan, but rather the suitability of the comic for readers in Indonesia. Elex Media doesn&#x27;t publish comics or manga with blatant pornography. In August 2009, Elex Media established Romic (euROpean coMIC line). The book titles included in this category are &quot;Lucky Luke&quot;, &quot;Smurf&quot;, &quot;Michel Vaillant&quot;, &quot;Yakari&quot;, and &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot;.

==Magazines==

<doc id="1343987" wikidata="Q440717" url="?curid=1343987" title="John N. Mather">
<text>John Norman Mather (June 9, 1942 – January 28, 2017) was a mathematician at Princeton University known for his work on singularity theory and Hamiltonian dynamics. 

== Biography ==
He was descended from Atherton Mather (1663–1734), a cousin of Cotton Mather. His father, Norman Mather, was a Princeton University professor of electrical engineering.

He spent his undergraduate years at Harvard University (BA 1964) and his graduate years at Princeton University (Ph.D. 1967). 

In 1969, after two years spent at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques, Mather was appointed Associate Professor at Harvard University. He was promoted to Full Professor in 1971. 

In 1974 Mather accepted a visiting Professorship at Princeton University, joining his father on the University faculty. His position was converted to a Full Professorship the following year.

He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences beginning in 1988. He received the John J. Carty Award of the National Academy of Sciences in 1978 (for pure mathematics) and the George David Birkhoff Prize in applied mathematics in 2003. He also received the Brazilian Order of Scientific Merit in 2000 and the Brouwer Medal from the Royal Dutch Mathematical Society in 2014.

== Contributions ==
His early work dealt with the stability of smooth mappings between smooth manifolds of dimensions &quot;n&quot; (for the source manifold &quot;N&quot;) and &quot;p&quot; (for the target manifold &quot;P&quot;). He determined the precise dimensions &quot;(n,p)&quot; for which smooth mappings are stable with respect to smooth equivalence by diffeomorphisms of the source and target (i.e., infinitely differentiable coordinate changes).

Mather also proved the conjecture of the French topologist René Thom that under topological equivalence smooth mappings are generically stable: the subset of the space of smooth mappings between two smooth manifolds consisting of the topologically stable mappings is a dense subset in the smooth Whitney topology. His notes on the topic of topological stability are still a standard reference on the topic of topologically stratified spaces.

In the 1970s, Mather switched to the field of dynamical systems. He made the following main contributions to dynamical systems that deeply influenced the field.

1. He introduced the concept of Mather spectrum and gave a characterization of Anosov diffeomorphisms.

2. Jointly with Richard McGehee, he gave an example of collinear four-body problem which has initial conditions leading to solutions that blow up in finite time. This was the first result that made the Painlevé conjecture plausible.

3. He developed a variational theory for the globally action minimizing orbits for twist maps (convex Hamiltonian systems of two degrees of freedom), along the line of the work of George David Birkhoff, Marston Morse, Gustav A. Hedlund, et al. This theory is now known as Aubry–Mather theory.

4. He developed the Aubry–Mather theory in higher dimensions, a theory which is now called Mather theory. This theory turned out to be deeply related to the viscosity solution theory of Michael G. Crandall, Pierre-Louis Lions et al. for Hamilton–Jacobi equation. The link was revealed in the weak KAM theory of Albert Fathi.

5. He announced a proof of Arnold diffusion for nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems with three degrees of freedom. He prepared the technique, formulated a proper concept of genericity and made some important progresses towards its solution.

6. In a series of papers, he proved that for certain regularity &quot;r&quot;, depending on the dimension of the smooth manifold &quot;M&quot;, the group Diff(&quot;M&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) is perfect, i.e. equal to its own commutator subgroup, where &quot;Diff(M, r)&quot; is the group of &quot;C^r&quot; diffeomorphisms of a smooth manifold &quot;M&quot; that are isotopic to the identity through a compactly supported &quot;C^r&quot; isotopy. He also constructed counterexamples where the regularity-dimension condition is violated.

Mather was one of the three editors of the Annals of Mathematics Studies series published by Princeton University Press.

<doc id="1343989" wikidata="Q727090" url="?curid=1343989" title="Dorival Caymmi">
<text>Dorival Caymmi (; April 30, 1914 – August 16, 2008) was a Brazilian singer, songwriter, actor, and painter active for more than 70 years, beginning in 1933. He contributed to the birth of Brazil&#x27;s bossa nova movement, and several of his samba pieces, such as &quot;&quot;Samba da Minha Terra&quot;, &quot;Doralice&quot; and &quot;Saudade da Bahia&quot;, have become staples of &quot;música popular brasileira&quot; (MPB). Equally notable are his ballads celebrating the fishermen and women of Bahia, including &quot;Promessa de Pescador&quot;, &quot;O Que É Que a Baiana Tem?&quot;, and &quot;Milagre&quot;&quot;. Caymmi composed about 100 songs in his lifetime, and many of his works are now considered to be Brazilian classics. Both Brazilian and non-Brazilian musicians have covered his songs.

Ben Ratliff of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Caymmi was &quot;perhaps second only to Antônio Carlos Jobim in &#x27;establishing a songbook of [the 20th] century&#x27;s Brazilian identity.&#x27;&quot; Throughout his career, his music about the people and culture of Bahia influenced Brazil&#x27;s image in the eyes of both Brazilians and foreigners. Caymmi was married to Brazilian singer Stella Maris for 68 years, and the couple&#x27;s children, Dori, Danilo, and Nana, are also prominent musicians. Each debuted professionally by accompanying Caymmi onstage and in recordings. In 2014, Caymmi&#x27;s granddaughter Alice also began a musical career.

==Early life==
Caymmi was born in Salvador, Bahia, to Durval Henrique Caymmi, the great-grandson of an Italian immigrant, and Aurelina Soares Caymmi, a native Bahian. He had two younger sisters, Dinahir and Dinah, and a younger brother, Deraldo. His father, a civil servant, often played the piano, guitar, and mandolin at home, and his mother, a housewife, sang regularly. He participated in his church&#x27;s choir for much of his childhood. At age 13, he left school to work as a journalist at Bahian newspaper &quot;O Imparcial&quot;. When &quot;O Imparcial&quot; went out of business two years later, he took up work as a street vendor.

Although he never formally studied music, Caymmi taught himself to play guitar in the late 1920s and began to compose, sing, and play his own songs on Bahian radio programs around 1930. He first achieved widespread recognition in 1933, when he composed the song &quot;O Que É Que a Baiana Tem?&quot; (&quot;What Is It About Bahian Women?&quot;) for singer Carmen Miranda. In 1936, at age 22, he won a songwriting contest at Salvador&#x27;s annual Carnaval celebration. His prize was a pink satin lampshade. Despite his early musical success, he moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1938 with intentions to pursue a law degree and to return to working as a journalist. While employed there by the newspaper &quot;Diários Associados&quot;, he spent his spare time composing and singing songs on the radio show &quot;Dragão da Rua Larga&quot;. His popularity began to grow with the show&#x27;s audience.

==Career==

===Overview===
Many of Caymmi&#x27;s lyrics pay homage to the lifestyle, beaches, fishermen, and women of his native Bahia. He drew much of his inspiration from music indigenous to northeastern Brazil, especially Afro-Brazilian music and samba. He recorded for more than five decades and released about 20 albums, sometimes singing and playing guitar as a soloist and at other times accompanied by bands and orchestras. Although active for the better part of the 20th century, Caymmi wrote only about 100 songs. Despite having a relatively small body of work, Caymmi held a reputation for composing songs of exceptional quality. He occasionally collaborated with Jobim, who called him a &quot;universal genius&quot; and Brazil&#x27;s greatest composer. Many contemporary Brazilian artists, including Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil and Beth Carvalho cite Caymmi as a significant influence on their music.

===Chronology===

&quot;O Que É Que a Baiana Tem?&quot;&quot; gained even more fame in Brazil when Miranda performed it in the 1939 film &quot;Banana da Terra&quot;, and it was this song that garnered her international attention and helped launch her career. After this success, Caymmi began to focus more on making music, and he wrote songs that appeared in other Brazilian films. In late 1939, he signed with Odeon Records and recorded his first three singles, &quot;Rainha do Mar/Promessa de Pescador&quot; (&quot;Queen of the Sea/Promise of the Fisherman&quot;), &quot;Roda Pião&quot; (&quot;Spinning Wheel&quot;), and &quot;O Que É Que a Baiana Tem?/A Preta do Acarajé&quot; (&quot;What Is It About Bahian Women?/The Black Beauty Who Sells Acarajé&quot;). He came to more attention in the early 1940s when he performed as a regular on the Brazilian radio network &quot;Rádio Nacional&quot;. He recorded &quot;Samba da Minha Terra&quot; (&quot;Samba of My Homeland&quot;) in 1940 and &quot;A Jangada Voltou Só&quot; (&quot;The Raft Returned Alone&quot;) in the following year. In 1944, he performed his own &quot;Acontece Que Eu Sou Baiano&quot; (&quot;It Just So Happens That I&#x27;m Bahian&quot;) in the movie &quot;Abacaxi Azul&quot; (&quot;Blue Pineapple&quot;). In the late 1940s, he was a member of the samba-canção movement largely founded by his sometime creative rival, composer Ary Barroso. Other prominent Brazilian musicians of the day covered several of his songs, including Dick Farney, who famously recorded Caymmi&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Marina&quot; (1944) in 1947. In 1957 Caymmi wrote &quot;Suíte do Pescador&quot;, which appeared in the film &quot;The Sandpit Generals&quot;.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Jobim, João Gilberto, and others who contributed to the birth of the bossa nova style collaborated with Caymmi and often referenced his work when composing their own pieces. During this era, Gilberto covered several of Caymmi&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Rosa Morena&quot;&quot; (&quot;Dark-skinned Rose&quot;) and &quot;Saudade da Bahia&quot; (&quot;Longing for Bahia&quot;). Jobim was particularly enamored of Caymmi&#x27;s music, and the two grew to be close friends. American lyricist Ray Gilbert translated Caymmi&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Das Rosas&quot;&quot; into English in 1965, and it was released in the United States as &quot;...and Roses and Roses&quot;. The song was recorded by Brazilian vocalist Astrud Gilberto and by American singers Andy Williams and Perry Como. Williams&#x27;s version became a hit, and as a result, Caymmi was invited to spend four months in Los Angeles, where he performed, filmed a television show, and recorded an LP record.

===Collaboration with Jorge Amado===

Caymmi was a lifelong friend of Bahian author Jorge Amado, and in 1945, he set one of Amado&#x27;s politically driven poems to music to aid the senatorial campaign of Luís Carlos Prestes. In the late 1970s, Caymmi again took inspiration from Amado when he composed &quot;Modinha para a Gabriela&quot; (&quot;A Little Song for Gabriela&quot;), a musical adaptation of Amado&#x27;s novel &quot;Gabriela, Cravo e Canela&quot; (&quot;Gabriela, Cloves and Cinnamon&quot;). Perhaps the best known product of Caymmi and Amado&#x27;s collaboration is the song &quot;É Doce Morrer no Mar&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s Sweet to Die in the Sea&quot;), which the two wrote over dinner one night at Amado&#x27;s home. Other songs they co-wrote include &quot;Beijos pela Noite&quot; (&quot;Kisses Through the Night&quot;), &quot;Modinha para Teresa Batista&quot; (&quot;A Little Song for Teresa Batista&quot;), &quot;Retirantes&quot; (&quot;Migrants&quot;), and &quot;Essa Nega Fulô&quot; (&quot;This Feisty Dark Lady&quot;).

==Awards and honors==
In 1968, to thank Caymmi for bringing international attention to Brazilian music and culture, the governor of Bahia presented Caymmi with a house in Salvador, and so he returned to live in his hometown for a short period of time. In 1972, Caymmi was awarded the Order of Merit of the State of Bahia, an order given to Bahian residents for excellent service to the state. In Caymmi&#x27;s case, the service was bringing pride and honor to Bahian people through the widespread dissemination of his music about life there. On Caymmi&#x27;s 70th birthday, in 1984, French Minister of Culture Jack Lang presented him with the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, a French order that recognizes significant contributors to the fields of art and literature, in Paris. The following year, a new street named &quot;Avenida Dorival Caymmi&quot; (Dorival Caymmi Avenue) opened in Salvador. In 1986, Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s famed &quot;Mangueira&quot; samba school based its Carnaval performance on Caymmi&#x27;s life and work, and the school won the annual parade-style samba competition. In 2015, his tribute album &quot;Centenário Caymmi&quot; (&quot;Caymmi Centennial&quot;) was nominated for Best MPB Album at the 16th Annual Latin Grammy Awards.

==Personal life==
Although Caymmi earned his fame through music, he was also known to a lesser degree for his paintings. From 1943 to 1945, he regularly attended a drawing and painting class at the Escola de Belas Artes, a fine arts school in Rio de Janeiro. Even after discontinuing his formal study, he painted for the rest of his life. He practiced Candomblé, an Afro-Brazilian religion characterized by belief in spirit-gods and ritualistic practices involving mediumship. Candomblé was his father&#x27;s religion, and Caymmi gradually involved himself more with it as an adult, when his friends invited him to accompany them to religious ceremonies and parties. Caymmi was also a naturist, and when he was in Bahia, he liked to bathe nude in the &quot;Lagoa do Abaeté&quot; (Abaeté Lagoon) with a group of friends. He stated to the newspaper &quot;Valor Econômico&quot;: &quot;We rolled around in palm leaves and slipped through the mountains of sand. Some people didn&#x27;t like this, but most understood that we weren&#x27;t naked for unclean reasons.&quot;

===Marriage===

While working at &quot;Rádio Nacional&quot; in 1939, he met Brazilian vocalist Adelaide Tostes, who is better known by her stage name Stella Maris, and the two married in 1940. Tostes responded to a 1994 press query about Caymmi&#x27;s habit of frequenting bars with a short story: &quot;One night I went to look for him in a bar ... He was surrounded by women. I went in and slammed a table. A glass broke. The bouncer came, and I punched Caymmi&#x27;s face. Then I left cussing. I thought he was involved with drugs, but it wasn&#x27;t the case. He was with the tramps.&quot; Despite such incidents, however, they remained together for 68 years, until his death in 2008. The couple had three children, Nana, Dori, and Danilo, all of whom followed their father into musical careers.

===Politics===
Although Caymmi rarely incorporated political messages into his music, he often spoke bitterly about the government&#x27;s corruption. Jorge Amado, his close friend, was sent into exile for several years after he publicly criticized the country&#x27;s rulers during the period of military dictatorship. In 1994, Caymmi said, &quot;I have concluded that to act as a citizen in Brazil today is to live a joke. It&#x27;s the same as playing the lotto, dreaming about nonsense, trying to get rich when you are 80.&quot;

==Death==
Dorival Caymmi died at age 94 of kidney cancer and multiple organ failure on August 16, 2008, at his home in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro. His granddaughter, Stella, who wrote a biography about him in 2001, said, &quot;He did not know that he had cancer, and he did not want to know. He did not ask much about this. He was first hospitalized in 1999. My grandfather went through with treatment, but he did not want to know anything about the illness. He acted with serenity every day, and because of that, we respected this wish.&quot;

==Reception and legacy==

Brazilian singer and composer Carlos Lyra praised Caymmi&#x27;s style for its &quot;suave and romantic colloquialism&quot;. In a 1994 anthology of Caymmi&#x27;s work, Antônio Carlos Jobim wrote in the introduction, &quot;Dorival is a universal genius. He picked up the guitar and orchestrated the world.&quot; In 2001, &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist Ben Ratliff wrote that Caymmi was &quot;perhaps second only to Antônio Carlos Jobim in &#x27;establishing a songbook of this century&#x27;s Brazilian identity.&#x27;&quot; On the day of Caymmi&#x27;s death in 2008, Brazilian composer and musician Tom Zé said, &quot;It&#x27;s difficult to comprehend just how valuable a CD of Caymmi&#x27;s beach songs from the 1940s is.&quot; Also around the time of Caymmi&#x27;s death, President of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva called him &quot;one of the founders of Brazilian popular music&quot;. Several of Caymmi&#x27;s contemporaries, including Gal Costa and Olivia Hime, have recorded tributes to him.

==Discography==

<doc id="1343996" wikidata="Q15402063" url="?curid=1343996" title="Religious profession">
<text>In the Catholic Church, a religious profession is the solemn admission of men or women into consecrated life by means of the pronouncement of religious vows, typically the evangelical counsels.

== Usage ==
The 1983 Code of Canon Law defines the term in relation to members of religious institutes as follows:
By religious profession members make a public vow to observe the three evangelical counsels. Through the ministry of the Church they are consecrated to God, and are incorporated into the institute, with the rights and duties defined by law.
Catholic canon law also recognizes public profession of the evangelical counsels on the part of Christians who live the eremitic or anchoritic life without being members of a religious institute:

A hermit is recognized in the law as one dedicated to God in a consecrated life if he or she publicly professes the three evangelical counsels, confirmed by a vow or other sacred bond, in the hands of the diocesan bishop and observes his or her own plan of life under his direction. 
== Procedure ==
Religious profession can be temporary or perpetual: &quot;Temporary profession is to be made for the period defined by the institute&#x27;s own law. This period may not be less than three years nor longer than six years.&quot;

&quot;When the period of time for which the profession was made has been completed, a religious who freely asks, and is judged suitable, is to be admitted to a renewal of profession or to perpetual profession; otherwise, the religious is to leave.&quot;

Conditions for making a temporary religious profession are a minimum age of 18 years, completion of a regular novitiate, freedom of choice on the part of the person making the profession, and acceptance by the superior after a vote by the superior&#x27;s council. Additional conditions for making perpetual profession are a minimum age of 21 years and the completion of at least three years of temporary profession.

Religious profession is often associated with the granting of a religious habit, which the newly professed receives from the superior of the institute or from the bishop. Acceptance of the habit implies acceptance of the obligation of membership of the religious institute as well as the associated vows.

==History==

The origins of religious profession date from the time when Christians were recognized in the Church as followers after perfection in the practice of religious life. Third-century ascetics, called in Greek &quot;asketai&quot;, and in Latin &quot;confessores&quot;, are early examples of a religious profession. Eusebius of Caesarea (&quot;Church History&quot;, III, xxxvii) numbers among the ascetics the most illustrious pontiffs of the first ages, St. Clement of Rome, St. Ignatius of Antioch, St. Polycarp, and others. After these, in the fourth century, come the hermits and monks, followed in the eleventh century by the canons regular, in the thirteenth century by the mendicant orders, in the sixteenth by the clerks regular, and lastly by the members of religious congregations. Profession for a long time was made by clothing with the religious habit: the aspirant could personally put on the habit or receive it, with or without ceremony, from the abbot or from the bishop. This clothing laid upon him the obligation of poverty and chastity more as a natural consequence of a donation or consecration to God than as arising from formal vows, which did not exist at that time (cf. St. Basil, Regulæ fusius tractatæ resp. ad 14 interrogat. in P. G., XXXI, 949–52).

The community life, established under Schenoudi, the great disciple of St. Pachomius, added an explicit promise of fidelity to certain precepts. St. Benedict added an express promise of stability, and obedience to the superior. These last promises denoted obligations created in addition to those implied by taking the habit. The first formula, which expressly mentions poverty and chastity, is that of the Constitutions of Narbonne, promulgated in 1260 by St. Bonaventure for the Friars Minor. Then the constitutions of the Minims and clerks regular expressly mention the three essential vows of the religious life, as well as those superadded on account of the special ends of their orders. This discipline is common to religious orders and congregations. Finally the regulations (Normæ) of 1901, published in explanation of the present practice of the Holy See, do not permit in new congregations any but the three essential vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.

In the Decretal, &quot;Quod votum,&quot; unic. De veto et voti redemptione (iii, 15) in 6°, Boniface VIII declared authoritatively that the vow of chastity, consecrated by the reception of major orders, or by religious profession in an approved institute, created a diriment impediment to marriage. Some communities of tertiaries not belonging to an approved order were the first to introduce profession accompanied by simple vows, which is now the ordinary practice in the more recent congregations.

The &quot;Annals of the Order of St. Benedict&quot; (vol. I, p. 74) in the year 537 recognized among the Greeks three classes of religious: the novices, who wore the simple tunic; the perfect, clothed with the pallium; and the more perfect invested with the cuculla, or hood attached to a short cloak, covering the shoulders, which was considered the special emblem of the religious life. In certain monasteries of the East, a distinction was made between persons wearing the short habit, mikroschemoi, and those wearing the long habit, megaloschemoi, a distinction against which St. Theodorus the Studite protested in his epistles (I, ep. x, in P. G., XCIX, 941–2), and which is still found among the Schismatic Coptic monks (see Kathol. Missionen 1 Oct., 1910, p. 7 sqq.). St. Ignatius of Loyola laid down that in his order there should be a simple profession, followed by more or less frequent renewal of vows until such time as the candidate should be prepared for the solemn or definitive profession; this under Pius IX and Leo XIII has become the common law of all religious orders.

<doc id="1344008" wikidata="Q5757" url="?curid=1344008" title="Simeulue Regency">
<text>Simeulue Regency () is a regency in the Aceh special region of Indonesia. It occupies the whole island of Simeulue (Pulau Simeulue), 150 km off the west coast of Sumatra, which with its many small offshore islands covers a land area of . It had a population of 80,674 at the 2010 census and 92,865 at the 2020 census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 97,118 (comprising 49,780 males and 47,338 females).

With its isolated geographic location and its linguistic difference from mainland Aceh, Simeulue has not been affected by the turmoil of conflicts in mainland Aceh between the Indonesian government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM, ). There has been no major GAM activity on the island.

== Administration ==

Simeulue was originally a part of West Aceh Regency but was split off on 4 October 1999 to become its own regency with the hope that the island&#x27;s development would improve. The seat of the regency is the town of Sinabang, situated on a bay (&quot;Laut Sinabang&quot;) on the northeast coast of the island.

The island was badly affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the subsequent tsunami, whose epicentre was directly north of the island, and between the island and the mainland of Sumatra.

The regency was divided at 2010 into eight districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), but two additional districts (Teupah Tengah and Simeulue Cut) were created in 2012. All are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 census and 2020 census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of villages (&quot;kampong&quot;) and the number of offshore islands (of which just two are inhabited) in each district, and its post code.
Notes: (a) including Lasia Island and Batu Island to the southeast of Simeuleu. &lt;br&gt;(b) of which the island of Pulau Siumat is inhabited. (c) of which the island of Pulau Teupah is inhabited. 
&lt;br&gt;(d) The 2010 population of the Teupah Tengah District is included in the figure for the Simeulue Timur District, from which it was cut out in 2012.
&lt;br&gt;(e) The 2010 population of the Simeulue Cut District is included in the figure for the Simeulue Tengah District, from which it was cut out in 2012.

===Villages===
Administrative villages (&quot;kampong&quot;) listed for each district:

== Demographics ==
The people of Simeulue are similar to the people in the neighboring Nias Island, speaking 3 languages (Devayan, Sigulai and Leukon) which are distinctly different from the languages spoken in mainland Aceh. The vast majority (99.7% in 2020) of the people of Simeulue are Muslim.

== Earthquakes ==
Simeulue was close to the epicenter of the 9.3 magnitude 26 December 2004 earthquake, but loss of life was surprisingly low, mainly because the people are familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis in this seismically active region and so knew to leave the coast after the earthquake. A major earthquake and tsunami hit Simeulue in 1907, killing many of its inhabitants. Many died when they rushed to the beach after seeing the water recede, exposing the coral and fish. They went to collect the fish, not realizing that the water would come back. Those who survived told the story of the 1907 &quot;semong&quot;, the local word for tsunami, to their children. It is largely because of this oral history that many in Simeulue say that they knew what to do when the 26 December 2004 earthquake and tsunami struck. In the fishing village of Kariya Vhapi on the NW shore of Simuelue, the 26 December 2004 tsunami was approximately 2 m high when it went through the village completely destroying all buildings.

On 28 March 2005 an 8.7 magnitude stuck with its epicenter just off the south end of Simeulue Island. During the earthquake, Simeulue rose at least six feet on the western coast; this left the flat top of its coral reefs above high tide level leaving it dry and dead. On the east coast, the land was submerged, seawater flooding fields and settlements. At the village of Kariya Vhapi the 28 March 2005 tsunami was smaller than the one the previous December and did not damage the village; however it did overtop a 3.2 m high beach berm. In Sinabang the 28 March 2005 earthquake and subsequent fire destroyed 50 to 60 percent of the downtown area and significantly damaged the port facility. At Sinabang the uplift was less than further north being &quot;only&quot; 40 cm.

On 20 February 2008 at 03:08 PM local time, Simeulue suffered a 7.4 magnitude earthquake.

On 11 April 2012 at 04:38 PM local time, Simeulue suffered an 8.6 magnitude earthquake.

==Environment==
Much of the north-western half of the island has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. It contains forested hills up to an elevation of 576 m, as well as two freshwater lakes. The Simeulue scops-owl is endemic to the island.

<text>The Chevrolet Cobalt is a compact car introduced by Chevrolet in 2004 for the 2005 model year. The Cobalt replaced both the Cavalier and the Toyota-based Geo/Chevrolet Prizm as Chevrolet&#x27;s compact car. The Cobalt was available as both a coupe and sedan, as well as a sport compact version dubbed the Cobalt SS. Like the Chevrolet HHR and the Saturn ION, it was based on the GM Delta platform.

A Pontiac version was sold in the United States and Mexico under the G5 name for 2007–2009. It was sold as the Pontiac G4 in Mexico for 2005–2006 and as the Pontiac G5 in Canada for its entire run (where it was briefly known as the Pontiac Pursuit and later Pontiac G5 Pursuit). The G5 replaced the Cavalier-related Pontiac Sunfire. While the Cobalt was available as a 2-door coupe and a 4-door sedan in all markets it was offered in, the G5 was only available as a coupé in the United States while a sedan version was sold alongside the coupé in Canada and Mexico.

As with their predecessors, all Cobalts and its Pontiac equivalents were manufactured at GM&#x27;s plant in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico and Lordstown, Ohio. The United States Environmental Protection Agency classified the Cobalt as a subcompact car.


==First generation (2004)==
===Specifications===
The front suspension was independent with MacPherson struts, while a semi-independent torsion beam was used in the rear. The wheelbase was , longer than its competitors, and the width was . Weight was average in-class, at for the coupe and for the sedan. For 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency fuel economy was increased to city/ highway with automatic transmission, and city/ highway with manual transmission. The engine output was increased to .

===Year-to-year changes===
* 2005: Initially released with the L61 2.2 Ecotec in-line 4 cylinder with DOHC and 4 valves per cylinder putting out at 5600 RPM, and at 4000 RPM. Later in the year a Cobalt SS coupe was added to the line-up, fitted with the LSJ, Eaton M62 supercharged version of the 2.0 Ecotec engine. With a relatively high 9.5:1 compression ratio and 12.0 PSI of boost, it develops at 5600 RPM and at 4000 RPM. This delivered lively performance of 0-60MPH in 6 seconds and a standing qtr of 14.4 seconds.
* 2006: A naturally aspirated SS was added to the lineup. This car was equipped with the LE5 2.4 Ecotec engine with VVT on the intake and exhaust and a 10.4:1 compression ratio developing at 6200 RPM and at 4800 RPM. This provided performance of 0-60MPH in about 7.1 seconds and standing quarter time of 15.6s. The LS became the base model while the LT was marketed as a mid-range package; the top level trim was now the LTZ. In addition, as with most other GM vehicles that year, GM&#x27;s Mark of Excellence symbol was added to both front fenders near the doors.
* 2007: The 2.2L engine was retuned and now developed at 5600 RPM and at 4200 RPM while retaining the same fuel economy. Other changes include a new console, new steering wheel and new radio head unit that features an audio input jack. In addition, all models now used a 5x110 wheel bolt pattern, except the LS and LT1 which retained the 4x100 bolt pattern. In addition, the 2007 model year marked the introduction of a new 32-bit computer that replaced the 16-bit unit from 2006.
* 2008: The 2.4 L naturally aspirated, high-output SS coupe and SS sedan were renamed to just &quot;Sport Coupe&quot; and &quot;Sport Sedan&quot; respectively. The 2.4 engine is also now rated with slightly less power but more torque at @ 6200 RPM and @ 4800 RPM. At mid-year, fuel economy was improved to city, highway on the LS and 1LT, coupe and sedan models with manual transmission; now labeled with XFE badging (X-tra Fuel Economy). XM Radio, side-impact air bags for improved safety, and MP3 player were now standard instead of optional. StabiliTrak stability control system was introduced. Other changes included the adding and removal of several exterior and interior colors. The new facelifted Cobalt SS 2-dr coupe launched near the end of May 2008 with the LNF version of the Ecotec engine replacing the LSJ. This turbocharged 2.0 liter engine with direct injection and VVT and a compression ratio of 9.2:1 has maximum boost of , delivering at 5300 rpm and of torque from 2500 to 5250 rpm. The SS turbo was quick, with a 0-60MPH time of just 5.5 seconds and quarter mile of about 14 seconds.
* 2008 (Special Edition &quot;Revolution&quot; Package): The special edition package for the Cobalt was introduced on August 16, 2008, which featured all the options that were available on the previous SS models except the turbocharged 2.0 engine. Instead it was once again built with the 2.4 naturally aspirated engine similar to the Cobalt Sport models. The special edition package could come with a sunroof, GM ground effects kit, the Getrag F23 5-speed manual transmission, and additionally the 5 lug wheel hubs that the SS editions featured. The special editions all had a &quot;Special Edition&quot; badge and came with unique variations of colors, and racing stripes.
* 2009: The 2.4 L naturally aspirated &quot;Sport Coupe and &quot;Sport Sedan&quot; models were both deleted, along with the 2.2 L L61 engine. Both were replaced by the 2.2 L LAP engine which featured dual VVT and 10.0:1 compression ratio thus providing better fuel economy and more power ()@6100RPM. Also, a 2.0 LNF Turbo SS sedan was added to the lineup. Three exterior colors were changed, and an interior color deleted. Bluetooth capabilities were added. An option for a reconfigurable performance display available on the SS coupe, could read out various engine output data and alter performance settings. 
* 2009 (Team Canada Edition Package): For Canada, a &quot;Team Canada Edition Package&quot; was offered beginning in 2009 and continuing into the 2010 model year for the LT.
* 2010: The car was replaced by the Chevy Cruze. In Canada, the Team Canada Edition Package was now standard on all LT models, and side-impact head curtain air bags were finally standard on all models.

===Safety===
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) the Cobalt receives an overall top score of &quot;Good&quot; for front collisions.
However, it receives a &quot;Poor&quot; overall score for side impacts without side curtain airbags, and an &quot;Acceptable&quot; overall score with side curtain airbags. In 2008, side curtain airbags became standard, but the Cobalt&#x27;s structure remains the same and consequently in structure/safety category of the IIHS&#x27;s side impact test the Cobalt receives a &quot;Marginal&quot; score. Side airbags are limited to the curtain type; torso type side airbags are unavailable. According to the IIHS&#x27;s injury measurements taken from the side impact test, the driver&#x27;s torso is given a &quot;Marginal&quot; score.

The IIHS also found 2005-08 model year Cobalts had the highest fatality rate in the small 4 door car class, with 117 deaths per million registered years compared to its class average of 71.

2010 NHTSA sedan crash test:
* Frontal Driver: 
* Frontal Passenger: 
* Side Driver: 
* Side Rear Passenger: 
* Rollover: 

Before 2009 the Cobalt only offered stability control as an option on Sport models.

===Defects and recalls===
In early 2007, 98,000 Cobalt coupes from the 2005–06 model years were recalled after it was discovered they did not meet federal safety requirements because of a lack of adequate padding in a specific area of the vehicle&#x27;s trim. This resulted in an unacceptable vulnerability to head injuries, though GM claimed the vulnerability would only affect motorists not wearing a seat belt.

On March 2, 2010, GM announced a recall of 1.3 million compact cars in North America, including the Chevrolet Cobalt, because of power steering problems. GM implemented the repair on older models before fixing more recent models, as the car was replaced by the Chevrolet Cruze in late 2010. The Pontiac G5 and its international variants were also affected, though GM had already ended production of the Pontiac brand by that point.
On September 28, 2012, GM announced a recall of 40,859 cars including the Chevrolet Cobalt from the 2007-09 model year because of a potential fuel leak. Although the recall was limited to five states, vehicles from other southern states were covered for repair when summer heat caused cracks in the fuel reservoir assembly. The fuel vapor leak could be detected during hot days by a gasoline smell in the vicinity of the car.

Faulty ignition switches in the Cobalts, which cut power to the car while in motion, were eventually linked to many crashes resulting in fatalities, starting with a teenager in 2005 who drove her new Cobalt into a tree. The switch continued to be used in the manufacture of the vehicles even after the problem was known to GM. On February 21, 2014, GM recalled over 700,000 Cobalts for issues traceable to the defective ignition switches. In May 2014 the NHTSA fined the company $35 million for failing to recall cars with faulty ignition switches for a decade, despite knowing there was a problem with the switches. Thirteen deaths were linked to the faulty switches during the time the company failed to recall the cars.

===Engines===
===Sales===
===Pontiac G5===

The Pontiac G5 was a rebadged version of the Chevrolet Cobalt.

In Canada, a rebadged variant of the Cobalt called the Pontiac Pursuit was sold from 2005 to 2006 as a sedan only. In 2006, another version of the vehicle was released in Canada, now called the Pontiac G5 Pursuit, and it was now available as both a sedan and a coupe. In Mexico, the vehicle was called the Pontiac G4 and was sold as both a sedan and a coupe from 2005 to 2006. 

In the United States, the Pontiac G5 went on sale in 2006 as a 2007 model, serving as the replacement for the Pontiac Sunfire, and was only available as a coupe. In Canada and Mexico, the Pontiac G5 went on sale in early 2007 as a 2007 model, available as both a sedan and coupe. 

General Motors discontinued the Pontiac G5 in the United States in 2009, and it was discontinued in Canada and Mexico in 2010. The Chevrolet Cruze served as a replacement for both the Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5.

===Replacement===

In 2009, Chevrolet launched the Cobalt&#x27;s eventual successor, the Chevrolet Cruze (based on the new Delta II platform), in Europe, with launches in other markets (including the US) following in 2010. The Cobalt ended production on June 23, 2010. With the discontinuation of the Pontiac brand by GM in 2010, the Buick Verano is marketed as the G5&#x27;s successor in Canada, while the Cruze serves as a de facto replacement for the Pontiac G5 in the United States.

==Second generation (2011)==

In 2011, General Motors Brazil introduced a new model bearing the Cobalt name in the Brazilian market. This Cobalt replaced the aging local Chevrolet Astra. The car is equipped with a 1.4 Econo.Flex engine. Although sporting a similar front end style, it is not directly related to the Chevrolet Agile, since it shares the overall underpinnings with the 2011 Chevrolet Sonic, while the Agile is derived from the considerably older Opel Corsa B, from 1993.

Chevrolet had no plans to bring the Cobalt to the North American market, which already had the Chevrolet Sonic and Chevrolet Spark as the subcompact cars in the continent. In GM Brazil&#x27;s line-up, it is situated above the Chevrolet Prisma and below the Chevrolet Cruze.
In January 2013, the Cobalt was launched in the Russian market, where it was imported from Uzbekistan. There, it was offered with a 1.5-liter engine, producing and . The Cobalt was retired in Russia in December 2015, when Chevrolet decided to minimize its presence only to its iconic models. However, in late 2016, it was reintroduced under the new Ravon marque as the Ravon R4.

The Chevrolet Cobalt was assembled in Colombia too. It was equipped with a simple range of two versions and a single 1.8-liter 8-valve 106-horsepower engine. With a very discreet commercial performance and a taxi variant, its production in the Colombian market ended in early 2016.
The Cobalt received a facelift in late 2015 for the 2016 model year. Its main rivals are the Nissan Versa and the Renault Logan.

In Brazil, production ended in late 2019, with 2020 being the final model year. The Cobalt has been succeeded by the Chevrolet Onix Plus sedan, which achieved higher sales upon its launch in 2019.

After UzAuto phased out the Ravon brand in 2020, the Ravon R4 was once again renamed the Chevrolet Cobalt. The Cobalt / R4 made by UzAuto never received the 2015 facelift seen in other markets.

<text>Bangladesh became a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) on 26 June 2000, and played its first Test match against India later that year. Before then, it had been an associate member of the ICC since 1977, competing in six ICC Trophies, the leading One Day International (ODI) competition for non-Test playing nations. The country has enjoyed some success in ODI&#x27;s and Twenty20 Internationals (T20I) since its promotion, but has struggled to perform in the Test match arena. Recent years have seen the nation improve tremendously however, and it is beginning to establish itself as a powerful force in the cricketing world.

<doc id="1344026" wikidata="Q7646941" url="?curid=1344026" title="Sursum Corda (Washington, D.C.)">
<text>Sursum Corda (Latin: &quot;lift up your hearts&quot;) is a small neighborhood located in Washington, D.C. It is located in the city’s Northeast and Northwest quadrants. The irregularly shaped neighborhood is bounded by New Jersey Avenue NW, New York Avenue NW &amp; NE, Massachusetts Avenue NW &amp; NE, First Street NW, N Street NW, Florida Avenue NE, Delaware Avenue NE, 2nd Street NE, and the train tracks (both Amtrak/freight and Metro) at NoMa-Gallaudet-U station. 

The neighborhood draws its name from the &quot;Sursum Corda Co-operative Apartments&quot;, a 199-unit low-income housing complex constructed in 1968. The area became a notorious open-air drug market plagued by violence and poverty in the 1980s. After a notorious 2004 murder in the neighborhood, demolition and complete renovation of the low-income housing in Sursum Corda was announced in 2007. Little of the redevelopment happened, although extensive demolition occurred.

==History==
Residential neighborhoods north of Massachusetts Avenue underwent a prolonged decay in the first half of the 20th century. Controversial urban renewal plans of the 1950s and 1960s called for massive demolition of the area, part of it comprising the old Irish American neighborhood of Swampoodle. However, the were only partially executed.

===Sursum Corda Co-operative===
Various Masonic and religious organizations took advantage of loan programs of the recently created U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to build housing for some of the displaced households. A group of Catholic activists from the nearby Gonzaga College High School and the parish of St. Aloysius conceived of a new urban village to house some of the households displaced by the demolitions. They also received support from the D.C. Public Housing Authority and the then-Senator from New York, Robert F. Kennedy.

The leading organizer and founder of the Cooperative was Eugene L. Stewart, an alumnus of Georgetown University. In 1965, Stewart was approached as a member of the Georgetown Alumni Association and asked if the Association would become involved by sponsoring a low income housing project. The idea presented to him was for students and alumni to assist with tutoring the poor and their children in the community. Stewart presented the ideas to the Alumni Board of Governors, but the plan was rejected. He formed Sursum Corda, Inc. and oversaw the construction of the Sursum Corda Cooperative.
Construction on the new development began in 1967. It was named &quot;Sursum Corda&quot;, a Latin expression meaning &quot;Lift up your hearts&quot; (which is intoned at the start of the Eucharistic Prayer during the Mass). The original plan called for 155 resident-owned and 44 rental townhouses on four acres (16,000 m2), arranged on courtyards and alleys around a horseshoe-shaped street (1st Terrace, L Place, and 1st Place NW) to promote a sense of community. The style was quite unusual for public housing of the era, in that the neighborhood was largely closed off, presaging some of the HOPE VI rehabilitation plans. The units offered amenities such as air conditioning, washer and dryer units, and kitchen garbage disposals. Rents were originally fixed at 25 percent of the residents&#x27; income.

A group of nuns from the religious institute of the Religious of the Sacred Heart (R.S.C.J.) were among the first residents, aiming to support and minister to the new residents. Father Horace McKenna, a Jesuit priest at St. Aloysius Church at Gonzaga College High School and well-known advocate for the poor, established a program to bring Georgetown University undergraduate students to tutor children in the neighborhood, a program which continues to the present day. McKenna Walk NW is named for him.

Disadvantageous tax laws led to neglect of the properties, and the arrival of crack cocaine in the 1980s sent the neighborhood into a steep decline. Its layout made it difficult to police, and consequently an ideal drug market and frequent battleground for street gangs. Despite the efforts of the Tenants Association, it became associated with poverty and crime. Even the nuns were driven away, the last departing in the early 1990s.

===Other community landmarks===
The Sursum Corda neighborhood also contains the Julius Hobson Plaza Condominiums (named for Julius Hobson, a civil rights activist and member of the first elected Council of the District of Columbia), the Severna Apartments, Sibley Plaza, the Turnkey, and the Tyler House Apartments. Sibley Plaza and the Turnkey are both owned by the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA), while the DeSeverna and Tyler House Apartments contain large numbers of units subsidized by the DCHA.

Local landmarks include the Walker-Jones Education Campus (preschool through eighth-grade) on New Jersey Avenue NW between Pierce and L Streets NW and its associated athletic field and basketball courts; the K Street Farm (a good farm managed by Walker-Jones teachers) on the northwest corner of K Street NW and New Jersey Avenue NW; and the Northwest One Neighborhood Library (built in 2009).

==Neighborhood redevelopment==
On January 23, 2004, 14-year-old Jahkema &quot;Princess&quot; Hansen was murdered in the Sursum Corda Co-operative. Hansen was involved with 28-year-old Marquette Ward, a known drug dealer. On January 18, 2004, Ward shot and killed 21-year-old Mario J. Evans in a hallway at the Temple Court Apartments for refusing to sell him a discounted drug. Hansen and an 18-year-old girl witnessed the murder. Ward, worried that Hansen would talk to the police, paid 22-year-old Franklin Thompson $8,000 to kill Hansen. While Hansen ate dinner at a friend&#x27;s apartment in the Sursum Corda Co-op on January 23, Thompson burst into the apartment and opened fire, wounding a 12-year-old girl. Hansen fled through the apartment. Thompson chased her and shot her twice in the head. Thompson and Ward were both convicted of first-degree murder in 2006.

Hansen&#x27;s murder, which &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called &quot;heinous&quot; and &quot;execution-style&quot;, shocked many residents of the city and drew attention to the terrible housing conditions and severe crime occurring in the neighborhood. It also prodded city officials to spur redevelopment in the area.

===Northwest One project===
Determined to change the Sursum Corda neighborhood, the government of the District of Columbia announced a plan to tear down the Sursum Corda Co-op, the Golden Rule housing and retail complex, the Temple Court Apartments, and other nearby buildings and construct a $700 million mixed use housing, office, and retail center for low-income residents. The city said that William C. Smith &amp; Co., Jair Lynch Partners, Banneker Ventures, and Community Preservation Development would lead the project. Dubbed Northwest One, the project would build 1,630 units (spread among apartments, condominiums, and townhouses), rebuild of retail space, add of office space, and construct a health clinic (to be run by Unity Health Clinic). Northwest One would triple the residential density of the area, and increase low-income housing to 571 units from 410 units. An additional $45 million in city funds would be used to rebuild Walker-Jones Elementary School and construct a new branch library in the area.

Little actual redevelopment occurred, although most of the buildings were demolished. The Sursum Corda co-operative declined to participate in the redevelopment. But the owners of other structures, such as the Golden Rule complex (owned by Bible Way Temple, a nearby church) did. Temple Court Apartments was the largest housing complex in the area, with 520 units. But the Bush Companies, which owned Temple Court, wanted to back out of the federal and city government-subsidized low-income housing plans and wanted to convert its units to market-rate housing. The District of Columbia exercised eminent domain over Temple Court, seizing it and ensuring it would not block the Northwest One plan. Demolition of the participating structures occurred in 2008, with residents dispersed to other public housing projects in the city. In 2009, the redeveloped Walker-Jones Education Campus and the Northwest One Neighborhood Library opened. But then redevelopment stopped. DCHA never assigned anyone to oversee the project, which left no one to push the developers to fulfill their agreement. DCHA itself was required to move from its headquarters at 1133 North Capitol Street NE to vacate and demolish its own headquarters to make way for the planned new housing, but the agency never did so. DCHA then lost the blueprints for the project, and only relocated them in June 2013. DCHA then discovered—after it had demolished the building—that the Temple Court Apartments were built with a mortgage insured by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. This $3.9 million insurance policy required that only subsidized housing could be built on the Temple Court land, but the Northwest One project envisioned market-rate, office, and retail use there. Mayor Adrian Fenty and Mayor Vincent C. Gray both pledged to resolve the issue, but never did. Only two of the many planned Northwest One buildings were constructed. One was the 2M Street Apartments at 2 M Street NE. Built with $16.8 million in DCHA funds, only 93 of its 314 units are subsidized for low-income residents. The other was the Severna Apartments, owned and built by Bible Way Temple. The $15.7 million building (constructed with $1.9 million in DCHA funds) opened in 2011. All of its units are for low-income residents.

The construction of the nearby NoMa - Gallaudet University Metro station and a surge in property values sparked redevelopment of the area.

===New Sursum Corda project===
In August 2015, Sursum Corda Cooperative Association announced it had partnered with Winn Development Co. and adjacent private landowners in the neighborhood to redevelop the Sursum Corda co-op and the surrounding of land into a new high-density, mixed use housing development. The development, which will occur in two phases, will contain more than 1,100 apartments, six times the co-op&#x27;s current capacity. Five buildings, with of residential space, of retail space, and 800 parking spaces, will be constructed on two parcels. The first phase, constructed on the parcel at L and 1st Streets NE, will contain three buildings of 164 units, 166 units, and 100 units. The second phase, located at the site of the current Sursum Corda Co-operative Apartments, will see two buildings of 339 units and 373 units.

Starting in November 2018, Toll Brothers development began demolition paving the way for the re-development.

<text>The Passaic and Harsimus Line, part of Conrail Shared Assets Operations, serves freight in northeastern New Jersey. It takes trains from the Northeast Corridor and Lehigh Line near Newark Liberty International Airport northeast and east into Jersey City. It is part of CSX&#x27;s main corridor from upstate New York to the rest of the east coast.

== Route description ==

The line begins at a junction with Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor at Lane Interlocking . near Waverly Yard . It runs next to the Northeast Corridor, just to the east, along what was originally Track 0 (the old P&amp;H Branch east of the yard is now abandoned).

After about a mile, the Greenville Secondary splits to the east to the Lehigh Valley Railroad Bridge, and the P&amp;H Line passes under the Lehigh Line and turns east. Access to the Lehigh Line eastbound is provided from the Greenville Branch via a track into the Oak Island Yard ; another track leaves the Oak Island Yard to join the P&amp;H Line headed northbound.

After crossing the Passaic River on the Point-No-Point Bridge , the P&amp;H Line passes over PATH and turns east, parallel to PATH. A track splitting just before the overpass accesses the area south of PATH. The P&amp;H Line then heads east through West Hudson and then across the Harsimus Branch Lift Bridge over the Hackensack River to Marion Junction , where the Northern Running Track goes north, with most rail traffic.

The P&amp;H Line past Marion Junction is now a secondary connection through the Journal Square Transportation Center to the National Docks Branch via a short section of the former River Line. The former River Line in Hoboken and Weehawken is now used for the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail.

==History==
The P&amp;H Line, before passing to Conrail, was the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s P&amp;H Line. Before that, it was the Waverly and Passaic Branch south of the bridge over PATH, the PRR&#x27;s main line from there to the River Line, and the Harsimus Branch where track no longer exists, east along the Harsimus Stem Embankment to Harsimus Cove.

<doc id="1344037" wikidata="Q471713" url="?curid=1344037" title="Peter Enckelman">
<text>Peter Mikael Enckelman (born 10 March 1977) is a Finnish former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. Enckelman represented Finland and played for TPS Turku, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Cardiff City, St Johnstone, Heart of Midlothian and IFK Mariehamn.

== Club career ==

=== Aston Villa ===
Born in Turku, Varsinais-Suomi, Enckelman signed for his first English club, Aston Villa, from his hometown team, TPS Turku, in February 1999 for a fee of around €1 million (1,7m + 4,3m Finnish markka). He made his debut during a 3–1 defeat against Arsenal on 11 September 1999 as a second-half substitute, his first start coming three days later against Chester City in the League Cup.

After David James left the team, Enckelman was pleased when he was called upon in some of the later fixtures, as he expected to be seeing some more first-team action. However, the signing of former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel put a considerable damper on things, as, apart from the matches in Aston Villa&#x27;s Intertoto Cup campaign of that season, he was left with virtually no playing time. It was only when Graham Taylor took over as manager that Enckelman was installed as first choice keeper, as Schmeichel was sold to Manchester City.

Enckelman was the culprit for a defensive error in a hotly contested local derby (Birmingham City v Aston Villa (3–0) on 16 September 2002); as Olof Mellberg took a quick defensive throw-in to the keeper, Enckelman took his eye off the ball and as he was unable to control it, it slid under his foot and rolled in to the goal. There is some debate over whether the goal should have stood, as the laws state that a goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in. The ball was adjudged to, yet did not appear, to scrape against the studs of his boot. Enckelman has stated on numerous occasions that he did not touch the ball prior to it entering the net. The incident led to further controversy when a rival fan charged onto the pitch and approached Enckelman, before making an offensive gesture directly to his face. The fan was later arrested and jailed, and Enckelman was praised for his refusal to retaliate.

=== Blackburn Rovers ===
Enckelman was sold to Blackburn Rovers in 2004 for £150,000. At Blackburn, he was considered second choice behind Brad Friedel, and on 19 May 2008 after making just three appearances in four years, he was told that his contract with the club would not be renewed.

=== Cardiff City ===

On 10 January 2008, he joined Football League Championship side Cardiff City on loan until the end of the 2007–08 season becoming Cardiff&#x27;s third loan goalkeeper of the year after Ross Turnbull and Kasper Schmeichel. He made his debut for Cardiff on 29 January as a substitute in a 3–1 victory over Queens Park Rangers after Michael Oakes was forced to be taken off after taking a blow to the face. He remained the club&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper for the rest of the season, playing in four of the club&#x27;s FA Cup matches, including the 2008 FA Cup Final, but a mistake from Enckelman resulted in the only goal of the game for opponents Portsmouth.

==== 2008–09 season ====

Enckelman was released on his return to Blackburn at the end of the season and signed a two-year deal with Cardiff. Despite spending his loan spell as first choice goalkeeper, he started the 2008–09 season as second choice goalkeeper to loanee Tom Heaton. On 23 September, he made his first appearance of the season in a 1–0 loss to Swansea City in the League Cup, the first South Wales derby to take place in seven years. His first league appearance of the season came on 22 November when he replaced Tom Heaton during a 2–1 defeat against Plymouth Argyle after Heaton sustained a calf injury. In the following match, Enckelman was handed a start in place of Heaton and went on to remain unbeaten for over ten matches, including keeping a clean sheet during a 0–0 draw in the fourth round of the FA Cup against Arsenal when forced to undergo a knee operation. It was originally thought that the injury would keep him out for two months but Enckelman&#x27;s knee failed to respond to the surgery meaning he would miss the remainder of the season.

==== 2009–10 season ====
The following season, Enckelman faced another challenge to be the number one goalkeeper at Cardiff with the signing of Scottish international David Marshall from Norwich City. After sharing goalkeeping duties during pre-season, he started the season on the bench behind Marshall before making his first appearance of the season in a 3–1 win over Dagenham &amp; Redbridge in the first round of the League Cup. On 28 November 2009, Enckelman was involved in car crash but made a &quot;lucky escape&quot;, he made his first league appearance the following day, playing 45 minutes coming on as a second-half substitute for David Marshall. At the end of the season, he was one of five players released by the club.

=== St Johnstone ===
On 7 August 2010, Enckelman appeared as a trialist for St Johnstone in their friendly match against Real Valladolid, keeping a clean sheet in the process. Two days later, Enckelman agreed to join the club, signing a two-year deal. He made his debut for the club in a 1–1 draw against Hearts on 14 August 2010. At St Johnstone, he immediately became a first choice goalkeeper. At the beginning of the season, Enckelman made a bad start and was relegated to the substitution bench after two matches. In his first season, Enckelman faced competition from Graeme Smith to take the first choice. In the end, Enckelman managed to win the spot. Despite the following season when Smith left and Alan Mannus arrived, Enckelman managed to retain his first choice throughout the season. Enckelman made an impressive penalty save from Kris Commons and won 1–0 against Celtic, keeping a clean sheet on 22 August 2011. After the match, Enckelman said the game was his best match. He saved another penalty from Jamie Hamill in a 2–1 win at Hearts on 3 December 2011. After the 2011–12 season, Enckelman was released by the club after his contract expired. After his release, Enckelman went on a trial at Preston and played in a friendly match in a 2–0 win over Southport on 14 July 2012.

=== Heart of Midlothian ===
On 17 August 2012, Enckelman signed a short-term deal with Hearts, until January 2013. Hearts signed Enckelman as cover after Mark Ridgers suffered an injury playing for the Scotland under-21 team. After being on the bench as cover for first choice Jamie MacDonald, Enckelman made his debut, coming on in the 14th minute for McDonald after he collided with Charlie Mulgrew. However, he lost his debut when Georgios Samaras scored through Enckelman&#x27;s legs to give Celtic the lead 1–0 and the game stayed that way until the final whistle. After the match, Enckelman expressed &#x27;disappointment&#x27; that he could have saved the shot from Samaras. Enckelman did not make another appearance for Hearts and he was released at the end of his contract in January 2013.

=== Return to Finland ===
On 13 June 2013, it was announced that Enckelman had signed a short-term contract with Veikkausliiga side IFK Mariehamn, returning to his native Finland after spending 14 years abroad.

== International career ==
Enckelman was capped 15 times by the Finland national under-21 team, before being capped on 12 occasions by the Finland national team from 2000 to 2010.

== Personal life ==
He is the son of Göran Enckelman, also a former Finland international goalkeeper. He has a keen interest in motorsport, and in January 2007 the &quot;Encke Sport&quot; team was announced with plans to contest the British Touring Car Championship. This never happened, but the team has competed in smaller racing classes.

<doc id="1344039" wikidata="Q948839" url="?curid=1344039" title="Equisetum fluviatile">
<text>Equisetum fluviatile, the water horsetail or swamp horsetail, is a vascular plant in the horsetail family Equisetaceae. It is a perennial herbaceous pteridophyte that reproduces using spores.

== Description ==
The green stems grow 50–150 cm tall and 2–8 mm thick. The leaf sheaths are narrow, with 15-20 black-tipped teeth. Many, but not all, stems also have whorls of short ascending and spreading branches 1–5 cm long, with the longest branches on the lower middle of the stem. The side branches are slender, dark green, and have 1–8 nodes with a whorl of five scale leaves at each node.

The water horsetail has one of the largest central hollow of the horsetails, with 80% of the stem diameter typically being hollow.

The stems readily pull apart at the joints, and both fertile and sterile stems look alike.

The water horsetail is most often confused with the marsh horsetail &quot;E. palustre&quot;, which has rougher stems with fewer (4–8) stem ridges with a smaller hollow in the stem centre, and longer spore cones 2–4 cm long.

== Reproduction ==
The water horsetail reproduces both by spores and vegetatively by rhizomes. It primarily reproduces by vegetative means, with the majority of shoots arising from rhizomes. Spores are produced in sporangia in blunt-tipped cones at the tips of some stems. The spore cones are yellowish-green, 2,5 cm long.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The water horsetail ranges throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, from Eurasia south to central Spain, Italy, the Caucasus, China, Korea and Japan, and in North America from the Aleutian Islands to Newfoundland, south to Oregon, Idaho, northwest Montana, northeast Wyoming, West Virginia and Virginia.

It commonly grows in dense colonies along freshwater shorelines or in shallow water in ponds, swamps, ditches, and other sluggish or still waters with mud bottoms.

This horsetail is sometimes seen as an invasive species because it is very hardy and tends to overwhelm other garden plants unless it is contained. When planting, it is best to plant them with the rhizome in a container.

==Uses==

=== Domestic ===
The water horsetail has historically been used by both Europeans and Native Americans for scouring, sanding, and filing because of the high silica content in the stems.

Early spring shoots were eaten. Poorer Roman classes at times ate them as a vegetable, despite not being very palatable or nutritious.

=== Medical and agricultural ===
Medically it was used by the ancient Greeks and Romans to stop bleeding and treat kidney ailments, ulcers, and tuberculosis, and by the ancient Chinese to treat superficial visual obstructions. 

According to Carl Linnaeus, reindeer, which refuse ordinary hay, will eat this horsetail, which is juicy, and that it is cut as fodder in the north of Sweden for cows, with a view to increasing their milk yield, but that horses will not touch it. It has also been used as a feed for livestock in Finland and is considered valuable, even better than many cultivated hays.

Horsetails absorb heavy metals from the soil, and are often used in bioassays for metals.

==Taxonomy==
Linnaeus was the first to describe water horsetail with the binomial &quot;Equisetum sylvaticum&quot; in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; of 1753. In the same work, he also described the unbranched form of the plant as a separate species, &quot;E. limosum&quot;.

The name Doris is derived from the noun for a gift, δῶρον, from Proto-Indo-European *déh₃rom of the same meaning.

== Function ==
When not associated with a god, Doris represented the fertility of the ocean, goddess of the rich fishing-grounds found at the mouths of rivers where fresh water mingled with the brine.

== Family ==
Being an Oceanid meant she was a sister of the river gods. By her husband Nereus, Doris was the mother of Nerites and mother to the fifty Nereids, including Thetis, Amphitrite and Galatea.

==Namesake==
Doris Cove in Antarctica is named after the goddess.

<doc id="1344043" wikidata="Q60518" url="?curid=1344043" title="Barisan Sosialis">
<text>Barisan Sosialis () was a political party in Singapore. It was formed on 29 July 1961 and officially registered on 13 August 1961 by left-wing members of the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) who had been expelled from the PAP. The prominent founding members of the Barisan were Lee Siew Choh and Lim Chin Siong. It became the biggest opposition party in Singapore in the 1960s and the 1980s.

The main objectives of the Barisan included eradicating colonialism, establishing a united independent and democratic Malayan nation comprising the Federation of Malaya and Singapore and introducing an economic system to promote prosperity and stability in society. The party was merged into the Worker&#x27;s Party in 1988.

==Background==
Since its formation, the PAP was divided into the conservative-technocratic Lee Kuan Yew camp and the left-wing camp led by Lim Chin Siong. The common ground of anti-colonialism and independence of Singapore was the basis for the co-operation between the two camps. Differences in their mass bases also encouraged such co-operation. During the early years, the left-wing camp mainly commanded support from the Chinese masses, rural people and trade unions, while support for Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s camp was mainly found in the English-educated community. With the support of the working class, the PAP won the third-most seats in the 1955 election and formed the main opposition. In 1959, with the support of the trade unions, the PAP won the election and formed the Government under Lee Kuan Yew. However, the two camps were ideologically and politically different in nature. During its formative years, the left-wing members already showed their dissatisfaction with the policies carried out by Lee Kuan Yew and his failure to fulfill his promises to help secure the release of the left-wing political detainees. Finally, the contentious issue of merger with Malaysia triggered the split within the PAP.

On 27 May 1961, Tunku Abdul Rahman, Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, suggested the creation of a new Malaysia state consisting of the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. The reactions towards merger within the PAP were divided. The merger with Malaysia was supported by the Lee Kuan Yew camp as a means of assuring Singapore&#x27;s future security and prosperity, while opposed by the left-wing camp as the merger was seen as an attempt to &quot;wipe out the left-wing forces in Singapore&quot; (&quot;Interview with Dr Lee Siew Choh&quot;).

The rupture within the PAP was widened by the Hong Lim and Anson By-Elections in 1961. Displeased with the PAP government&#x27;s refusal to abolish the Internal Security Council (ISC), refusal to back down the merger plan and refusal to release the remaining political detainees, the PAP left-wingers abandoned support for their own candidates in favour of Ong Eng Guan (in Hong Lim) and David Marshall (in Anson), which led to the PAP&#x27;s defeat in the two by-elections.

After the Anson by-election, the left-wing camp planned to oust Lee Kuan Yew from the party but they worried that their actions would cause the British to hold up plans for Singapore&#x27;s independence. As a result, the left-wingers had a meeting with Lord Selkirk, the British Commissioner-General at Eden Hall, which was later known as the &quot;Eden Hall Tea Party&quot;. At the meeting, the left got assurance from Selkirk that Britain was committed to independence and would not intervene militarily to maintain control after the overthrow of Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s government.

==Formation==
On 20 July 1961, Lee Kuan Yew called an emergency meeting of the Legislative Assembly to vote on a motion of confidence in the Government. Twenty-seven assemblymen voted for the government and twenty-four, including thirteen of PAP left-wingers, either abstained or voted against the motion of confidence. The thirteen PAP left-wingers who abstained from voting were then expelled from the PAP. The expelled members, including Lim Chin Siong, Sidney Woodhull and Fong Swee Suan, then proceeded to form an opposition party, the Barisan Sosialis. After the split, 35 branch committees out of 51 and 19 of 23 paid organising secretaries of the PAP went over to the Barisan.

The Barisan was officially inaugurated on 17 September 1962, with Lim Chin Siong as its secretary-general and Dr Lee Siew Choh as chairman. Its founding slogan was &#x27;genuinely full internal self-government&#x27; through merger with Malaya and it shared the same aim with the PAP-&#x27;the creation of an independent, democratic, non-communist, socialist Malaya&#x27;. The main objectives of the new party were presented in following four statements:

# To eradicate colonialism and set up a united national independent state comprising the Federation of Malaya and Singapore
# To establish a democratic Government of Malaya based on universal adult suffrage of all those who are born in or owe their allegiance to Malaya
# To bring into being an economic system that will endure a prosperous, stable and just society
# To mobilise all sections of the people for the building of a Malayan nation

==Merger issue==

While the Barisan didn&#x27;t oppose the merger with Malaya, the party campaigned vigorously against the PAP government&#x27;s merger terms with the Federation of Malaya. According to the merger terms agreed by the PAP government, Singapore would retain its autonomy in education and labour at the expense of the rights of Singapore citizens and seats in the new Federal Parliament. The Barisan Socialis wanted the Singapore citizens to automatically become Malayan citizens with proportional representation in the Federal Parliament. At the end, the PAP government advocated that a referendum should be held to test popular support for the merger. The Referendum Bill on the merger incorporated proposals and amendments from the Barisan, David Marshall, Ong Eng Guan and SPA-UMNO. Three offered options A, B, C respectively proposed by the PAP, David Marshall and the SPA-UMNO. However, the Barisan appealed to voters to cast blank votes on the referendum stating that no option correctly expressed Barisan&#x27;s thoughts and the three options would &quot;sell out Singapore&quot;. This move had been anticipated by the PAP government; a clause had been inserted within the Referendum Ordinance stating that voters who cast blank votes were unable to make a decision themselves and they must necessarily follow the majority. That is, the blank votes would be automatically counted together with whichever of the options that won the majority. The Referendum on Merger was held on 1 September 1962, and the results were:

* Option (A): 397,626 votes (71%)
* Option (B): 9,422 votes (1.7%)
* Option (C): 7,911 votes (1.4%)
* Blank votes: 144,077 votes (25%)

Option A won the majority, with the Barisan defeated.

==Reasons for decline==

===Operation Coldstore===

Tunku Abdul Rahman was worried about the impact of Singapore&#x27;s leftist influence in a unified Malaysia. He demanded that Singapore&#x27;s political opposition be arrested as a condition of merger. The PAP was hesitant about the arrests as they could damage the PAP&#x27;s popularity in Singapore. However, the Brunei Revolt of 8 December 1962 gave the PAP a &#x27;heaven sent opportunity&#x27; to justify the arrests. The Barisan&#x27;s open support of the Brunei revolt gave the PAP an excuse that the arrests were to prevent possible communist subversion and safeguard the security and safety in Singapore.

On 2 February 1963, the ISC launched a crackdown against leftists and their supports. Under the action, code-named Operation Coldstore, 107 people including political, trade unionists and student leaders who had shown support for the Brunei Revolt were detained. Among those detainees, half of them were Barisan central leaders. Operation Coldstore was a fatal blow to the Barisan.

Operation Coldstore almost paralysed the Barisan because of the detention of its major leaders including Lim Chin Siong. However, remaining Barisan leaders did not give up their struggle. On 22 April 1963, Lee Siew Choh and remaining Barisan activists launched the &quot;City Hall Battle&quot;. They marched from the Barisan&#x27;s headquarter in Victoria Street to the steps of City Hall to protest the mass arrests in February and presented a petition to the Prime Minister in protest against the &#x27;ill treatment&#x27; of the detainees. The protest was put down and seven party leaders including Lee Siew Choh were arrested.

===1963 general election defeat===
After Operation Coldstore and ensuing protests, major cadres of Barisan were detained or put on long trials. These events severely diminished the strength of the Barisan, which prevented the party from effectively taking part in the 1963 general elections, and the party was eventually defeated in the elections. The 1963 elections ended with a clear victory of PAP winning thirty-seven of the fifty-one seats. The Barisan won thirteen, and the remaining seat fell to Ong Eng Guan who contested under the banner of the United People&#x27;s Party.

After the elections, the Malaysian Government took a series of actions to further debilitate the Barisan. On Malaysia Day on 16 September 1963, the security authorities decided to launch two further crackdowns on the &quot;left-wing&quot; extremists. In those September and October operations, &quot;some fifteen leaders of the Communist United Front&quot; were rounded up. Some student activists from Nanyang University were soon arrested for alleged subversive activities. In late August 1963, seven trade unions under Singapore Association of Trade Unions (SATU) controlled by the Barisan, were served notices by the Government to show cause why they should not be deregistered. On 30 October, the seven unions which were supposed to close down were eventually struck off the register. In October, the government dissolved two of Barisan&#x27;s most effective ancillary associations, The Singapore Rural Residents&#x27; Association and Singapore Country People&#x27;s Association.

===Intra-party strife===

====National Service====
Soon after Malaysia was formed, alarmed by Indonesia&#x27;s confrontation and rebel activities in the Borneo territories, the central parliament in Kuala Lumpur passed legislation which required all youth between the age of 18 and 25 to register for National Service. The left-wingers regarded this action as a government move &quot;to counter the left-wing movement&quot; However, within the left-wing camp, there were two different strategies to campaign against the National Service scheme supported by two schools led respectively by Chen Hock Wah, who was a member of the CPM and Lee Siew Choh, who was Chairman of Barisan. Chen Hock Wah proposed a two-step policy called &quot;Principled Registration&quot; or &quot;Registration under Protest&quot;. The first step was not to stop persons affected being registered. The second step was to tell the persons affected not to present themselves for rollcall if they were actually mobilised for active service after registration. On the other hand, the camp led by Lee Siew Choh advocated a boycott of the law and proposed affected persons should not even register in the first place. A great quarrel broke out in Barisan and Chen&#x27;s strategy obtained majority support. Finally, Lee Siew Choh, together with seven other founding members resigned from the party attributing his resignation to the difference between him and other leaders. The party was split wide open, though Lee was persuaded to resume his chairmanship of Barisan on 9 March 1965.

====Singapore&#x27;s separation from Malaysia====
The Barisan had fought against the merger with Malaysia, however, upon the declaration of Singapore&#x27;s independence from Malaysia in 1965, leaders of Barisan declined to recognise the independence of Singapore. Lee Siew Choh, chairman of Barisan attacked the independence obtained by Singapore, stating that it was not genuine and released public slogans of &quot;Crush Malaysia&quot;, &quot;Phony Independence&quot;, and &quot;Boycott Parliament&quot;. Reaction towards Singapore&#x27;s independence within the left-wing camp was again divided. Lim Huan Boon, who was a member of the Communist Party of Malaya and one of Barisan&#x27;s representatives in the Legislative Assembly recognised the independence of Singapore stating that there was no such thing as phony or half independence. Lim Chin Siong, another leader of Barisan who was in detention, also considered Singapore&#x27;s independence to be genuine.

Taking the view that there was neither true national independence nor parliamentary democracy, Barisan began to boycott Parliament and elections. In October 1966, the Barisan had all its remaining representatives in Parliament resign their seats and started what they called an extra-parliamentary struggle. An editorial in &quot;The Straits Times&quot; commented that the Barisan chose the wrong time to launch an extra-parliamentary struggle:

&quot;To give up the constitutional arena, at a time when none other exists, is very much like giving up politics altogether&quot;.

The departure from the parliament arguably sealed the fate of Barisan.

===Final days===
By 1967, Barisan had been depleted and its declining fortunes was seen in the contraction of its membership. Within three years from 1963 to 1966, the number of its branches had shrunk to 33 from 36 with only 22 effective. In contrast, the PAP maintained its 51 branches throughout the three years. The Barisan boycotted the General Elections in 1968 and allowed the PAP to win all 51 seats in the Parliament.

Barisan returned to contest the 1972 general election. However, it failed to win any seat in this and subsequent elections. It was clear that Barisan was no longer in a position to function effectively as a political party. In May 1988, the Barisan was dissolved into the Workers&#x27; Party of Singapore to strengthen the opposition and applied for dissolution. The application was denied approval as Barisan&#x27;s constitution required all its branches to agree to the dissolution but none were left. Hence, it was left dormant since.

==Communist debate==
From the perspective of the PAP government, the Barisan was a communist-controlled organisation which Lee Kuan Yew labelled as a &quot;main open front communist organization&quot; The ISC stated that the Barisan activists were indeed communist-inspired and the Barisan was controlled by the Communists to sabotage the formation of Malaysia.

Although admitting that they adopted Communist tactics for the anti-colonial cause because, at the time, such tactics would gather mass support, Lim Chin Siong refuted the Communist label attached to him and the Barisan. He claimed:

&quot;Let me make it clear, once and for all, that I am not a Communist, or a Communist front-man, or, for that matter, anybody&#x27;s front-man.&quot;

&quot;I was an MBA League member, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I was a communist...MBA is far from MCP...Study the Manifesto of the PA; it was more anti-colonial and more communist in doctrine...Of course during that time, the largest surviving party in Malaya was MCP and PAP was relatively new, so it was inevitable the thinking was influenced by communism.&quot; (&quot;Interview with Lim Chin Siong&quot;)

It may have been possible that the Barisan was merely inspired by successful Communist movements elsewhere to end colonialism and to mobilise the masses, and there is uncertainty about whether the Barisan was Communist controlled or not.

&quot;It is not clear whether the Barisan is merely a front for the Communist Party and its executive in Singapore, the Town Committee, or whether it is a party which is willing to accept Communist support, though the ultimate objective did not call for the creation of a Communist political system nor the establishment of a beachhead for the Chinese People&#x27;s Republic.&quot;

<text>Richard Howly (1740 – December 1784), sometimes spelled Howley, was an American planter and lawyer from Liberty County, Georgia. He served briefly as the governor of Georgia in 1780, as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1780 and 1781, and as chief justice of Georgia in 1782 and 1783.

==Early life==
Little is known about Howley&#x27;s early life. In 1775 he married Sarah Fuller of Charleston, South Carolina, the widow of William Fuller and mother of two daughters. Subsequently, the couple had two daughters of their own, only one of whom reached adulthood.

==Revolutionary War==
When the Revolution began, Howley was practicing law in Sunbury, where he also owned a small plantation and a few slaves. He was not prominent in the early stages of the Revolution in Georgia. Savannah fell to the British on December 29, 1778, and Colonel Augustine Prevost began a siege of Sunbury. When Fort Morris surrendered in January 1779, Howley and his family fled to Augusta.

The British occupied eastern Georgia, and fighting moved into the back country. Georgia Whigs, openly divided into radical and conservative factions since the infamous duel in May 1777 between patriot leader Button Gwinnett and Lachlan McIntosh, vied for political leadership as they tried to convene a new assembly in Augusta. After selecting an executive council to govern the sections of the state still under Whig control, this council, dominated by conservative Whigs, elected John Wereat president on August 6, 1779. Howley was associated with the radical Whig faction and a close ally of George Walton who, after the joint American and French siege of Savannah failed in October 1779, was sent to Augusta to hold new elections. Backed by Howley, George Wells, and their back country supporters, Walton organized a rival assembly in November 1779. This body elected Walton governor and Walton, Howley, and three others delegates to the Continental Congress, in effect ousting Wereat from power. Within two months, Walton departed for Philadelphia. The assembly elected Howley governor on January 4, 1780 and empowered him to act on behalf of the government even if forced into exile. During these uncertain times he called on Georgians to be steadfast in their support of independence. As British raids increased, the council directed Howley to flee to the Carolinas. Howley and several council members transported the state archives and some paper money to New Bern, North Carolina. On July 1, 1780 he was among those listed under the British Disqualifying Act.

==Political life==
Howley took his seat in Congress in July 1780. He assisted in obtaining a new loan from France. His primary interest, however, was to guard against peace proposals that would allow Britain to retain control of Georgia. With Walton and William Few, he published &quot;Observations upon the Effects of Certain Late Political Suggestions by the Delegates of Georgia&quot;.

Howley lost his re-election bid to Congress and returned to Georgia. He was elected to the Georgia General Assembly in 1782. He was able to acquire confiscated Tory property being sold in Chatham and Liberty counties. Aedanus Burke turned down an offer to become chief justice of Georgia, and in October 1782 Howley was appointed pro tempore chief justice. He represented Liberty County in the general assembly during 1783 and 1784, after which he moved his residence to Savannah.

==Death==
A devout Roman Catholic, Howley journeyed to St. Augustine in December 1784 to receive sacraments of penance and holy communion that were not available in Georgia. While there, he wrote to Bishop Echevarrio of Cuba requesting that priests from Florida be sent to administer sacraments to Catholics in Georgia. Apparently ill when he returned from Florida, Howley died at his residence in Savannah.

<text>George Wimpey was a British construction firm that typically worked in the civil engineering and housebuilding markets. It was, during the 1970s, the largest homebuilder active in the UK. 

Established in 1880 and originally based in Hammersmith, the company&#x27;s early activities were orientated around its road surfacing contractor role, as well as civil engineering, such as the construction of the White City Stadium complex and similar facilities. Following the death of George Wimpey in 1913, the business was acquired from the Wimpey family by Godfrey Mitchell in 1919. Mitchell would head the company for over half a century, making several key decisions such as to enter the private housebuilding sector during the 1920s. During 1934, George Wimpey went public on the London Stock Exchange; however, an unusual ownership scheme was enacted, under which the charitable Tudor Trust held about half of the firm&#x27;s shares, an arrangement that lasted for several decades.

Throughout the Second World War, Wimpey contributed to the war effort through the construction of numerous airfields, factories, and other facilities to meet Britain&#x27;s needs. After the war, the company secured substantial work from various local authorities to produce houses. It played a leading role in the use of no-fines concrete construction to produce new homes. Throughout the 1950s and the following two decades, Wimpey&#x27;s building and civil engineering divisions expanded substantially, not just domestically but internationally as well, to the point that the firm became one of Britain&#x27;s larger international contractors. A return to private homebuilding and a series of lucrative opportunities, particularly in the Middle East, had fuelled the company&#x27;s growth. However, following the stepping down of Mitchell, the company appeared to lose direction and Wimpey&#x27;s fiscal performance suffered during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The early 1990s would see substantial changes, ranging from a reorganisation that replaced the traditional regional model to instead orient around key business activities to the disposal of several non-core business sectors. During 1995, Wimpey and rival company Tarmac agreed to the transference of the former&#x27;s construction and minerals divisions in exchange the latter&#x27;s housing division (largely McLean Homes). In the following years, McAlpine Homes was acquired from Alfred McAlpine while Laing Homes was also purchased from John Laing. Accordingly, Wimpey became increasingly centred around the housebuilding market. In July 2007, Wimpey merged with Taylor Woodrow to create Taylor Wimpey, the largest homebuilder in the UK.

==History==

===Early years===
The business was founded by George Wimpey and Walter Tomes as a stone working partnership in 1880 in Hammersmith. The company built the first Hammersmith Town Hall in 1896, and went on to lay the foundations for the first &quot;electric tramway&quot; in London in the late 1890s. The company also built the White City Stadium complex, which included a series of pavilions and gardens for the Franco British Exhibition of 1908, as well as an 80,000-seat Olympic stadium for the 1908 Olympic Games.

===The Mitchell Era===

During 1913, George Wimpey died at the age of 58; his family put the business up for sale six years later. Godfrey Mitchell, who had served in the Royal Engineers during the First World War, purchased the firm and decided to retain the Wimpey name. Mitchell would serve as George Wimpey&#x27;s executive chairman for over 50 years and prove to be decisive in the company&#x27;s fortunes during this time.

In the interwar period, Mitchell built up a fleet of steamrollers and took contracts for both public and private paving jobs, a considerable proportion of this work coming from new housing estates. Mitchell observed that the company could make more money as a developer than just as a contractor; having first tested this with his own money, Mitchell initiated the company&#x27;s first residential development, the Greenford Park Estate, during 1928. By 1930, Wimpey was building around five hundred houses per year, rising to a peak of 1,370 during 1934.

However, the company&#x27;s private housebuilding activities were abruptly ceased at the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, throughout which Wimpey concentrated on defence-related undertakings. Accordingly, it built 93 facilities, ranging from aerodromes and factories to army camps. By the end of the conflict, it had become one of the country&#x27;s largest contractors.

In the immediate post war period, building controls prevented any substantial return to private housebuilding and Wimpey turned instead to the local authority market and, by the early 1950s, Wimpey was building 18,000 houses per year on behalf of various local authorities. Wimpey was pre-eminent in the use of no-fines concrete construction (concrete made without sand) in both high and low rise housing; this technique was particularly valuable amid a shortage of bricks and several other standard building materials. It was also expanding its building and civil engineering divisions, particularly overseas where it became one of the larger international contractors. The end of building controls in 1954 allowed Wimpey to re-enter the private housing market. It did so in a substantial way through its regional structure, becoming the country&#x27;s first national housebuilder; by 1972, Wimpey was building private houses at an annual rate of 12,500, some three times the rate of its nearest competitor.

Although Wimpey experienced rising profits in the 1970s, which was largely attributed to its Middle East contracting, the group was beginning to lose direction. While Godfrey Mitchell retired as Chairman in 1973, he remained a director and a dominant figure in the company&#x27;s operations until his eventual retirement from the Board in 1981 following his 90th birthday. Operational control was diffused between four joint managing directors, and the regions rather than the centre were the dominant force. Unlike some of the newer housebuilders, Wimpey&#x27;s housing was mixed in operationally with its construction business. Volumes declined and, by the end of the 1980s, private housing sales were down to around 5,000 houses per year.

===Acquisitions and Merger===
The 1990s was a difficult period for the business, particularly in light of the economic consequences of the early 1990s recession; both the housebuilding and civil engineering sectors were hit heavily, leading to a loss of £112 million being recorded in 1992, although profitability did quickly recover. A reorganisation of Wimpey&#x27;s structure, centred around key business areas, rather than geographic regions, was conducted. Furthermore, a few non-core businesses, such as its waste management activities, were divested while various properties held by the firm were written down or sold, decreasing the size of the group somewhat.

Despite the company&#x27;s initial attempts to change this trend, private housing had remained contractor dominated by this time. A major turning point came in November 1995 when the Board announced a radical solution: Wimpey was to transfer its construction and minerals divisions to Tarmac in return for the latter&#x27;s housing division (largely McLean Homes). Thereafter, Wimpey was once again selling 12,000 private houses per year.

Two more major housing acquisitions followed, both divisions of contractors seeking to focus on their core contracting business. In August 2001, McAlpine Homes was acquired from Alfred McAlpine, bringing with it a 4,000 houses per year business; during the following year, Wimpey also bought the 1,200 houses per year Laing Homes from John Laing. 

In March 2007, the company announced plans for a £6 billion nil premium merger with Taylor Woodrow, to be called Taylor Wimpey. The merger was effected by means of a scheme of arrangement, leaving the original Taylor Woodrow shareholders with 51% of the new Taylor Wimpey. Taylor Woodrow provided the new chairman and finance director, while the chief executive and the managing director came from Wimpey.

==Tudor Trust==
When Mitchell took George Wimpey public in 1934, he set up a unique ownership scheme wherein the charitable Tudor Trust held about half of the firm&#x27;s shares. This arrangement had considerable benefits to the business, making it less beholden to other shareholders and making Wimpey a difficult target for a potential hostile takeovers; however, it did hinder the raising of further capital from shareholders. the company&#x27;s management would periodically meet with representatives of the Tudor Trust to discuss the direction of the business. The Tudor Trust later diluted its stake to 5% (as a result of a rights issue) from 34%, which was in itself steadily reduced over the years. Just before the Taylor Wimpey merger on 2 July 2007, the Tudor Trust no longer held a reportable interest in its own name in George Wimpey, such interest being below the declarable 3% threshold.

==Operations==
Clifford Chetwood was appointed to head Wimpey in 1982. The company then had over 40,000 employees and annual revenue of £1 billion, divided between a large number of British subsidiaries. Over the next ten years, Chetwood set out to convert these into three principle divisions, Homes, Construction, and Minerals, the aim being to create divisional autonomy and responsibility.

===United Kingdom housebuilding===
George Wimpey homes in the United Kingdom were sold under three distinct brands: the core &#x27;George Wimpey&#x27; brand, the &#x27;Laing Homes&#x27; brand, which had previously been used solely in the South East and Midlands, and the affordable &#x27;G2&#x27; brand launched in 2006. In the 1970s, George Wimpey became the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest private house builder, selling 106,440 homes in the decade, and in the 1980s, George Wimpey began to reinforce Wimpey Homes as a brand, focusing on quality compact housing. Advertising, featuring the famous Wimpey cat, ensured Wimpey Homes became a household name in house building.
By 2002, there were four brands: Wimpey Homes, McLean Homes, McAlpine Homes and Laing Homes. Under the leadership of the current chief executive, Peter Redfern, (who was then head of housing), the operations were merged, and ‘Wimpey Homes’, ‘McLean Homes’ and ‘McAlpine Homes’ were replaced with ‘George Wimpey’ under a new three-dimensional purple and orange squares corporate identity. Laing Homes was retained due to its more upmarket status and its greater brand recognition. This brand disappeared in June 2008, as a result of the merger with Taylor Woodrow.

During 2006, George Wimpey launched an affordable &#x27;G2&#x27; brand, focussing on one and two bedroom luxury apartments. Its prime target markets were value-conscious first time buyers and key workers.

===Sponsorship===
George Wimpey was the Main Sponsor of St Johnstone F.C. until 2008/09, when George Wimpey and Taylor Woodrow merged.

===Wimpey Construction===
Wimpey Construction was one of the leading construction businesses in the United Kingdom, Canada and the Middle East, engaging in a wide range of building and civil engineering activities. Major non-housing construction projects have included:

*the White City Stadium completed in 1908

===Wimpey Minerals===
Wimpey Minerals was one of the largest aggregate, coated stone and construction material producers, with significant operations in the United Kingdom and United States, and smaller operations overseas.

===North American operations===
George Wimpey also had operations in the United States trading under Morrison Homes, which was acquired in 1984 when it was based in San Francisco, Northern California. George Wimpey later added to its US operations with the acquisition of Richardson Homes of Denver, Colorado in 2001.

Morrison Homes was initially founded in Seattle in 1905 by C.G. Morrison and moved to northern California in 1946. Operations were extended to cover Phoenix, Central Valley, Sacramento, Denver, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, Orlando, Sarasota, Tampa, Reno, Austin, Dallas Fort Worth and Houston.

==Musical reference==
Along with Sir Robert McAlpine and John Laing, Wimpey is mentioned in the opening preamble to the 1960 Dominic Behan satirical Irish ballard, McAlpine&#x27;s Fusiliers.

<text>Tywardreath (; , meaning &quot;House on the Beach&quot; (or Strand)) is a small hilltop village on the south coast of Cornwall, England, United Kingdom, about north west of Fowey. It is located in a sheltered spot overlooking a silted-up estuary opposite Par and near the beach of Par Sands. It is on the Saints&#x27; Way path.

Tywardreath was featured by Daphne du Maurier in her novel &quot;The House on the Strand&quot;. Although this was a fictional tale of drug-induced time-travel, the history and geography of the area was carefully researched by du Maurier, who lived in a house called Kilmarth (, meaning &quot;horses&#x27; ridge&quot;), to the south. It also appears in her 1946 novel &quot;The King&#x27;s General&quot;.

The seal of the borough of Tywardreath was a Shield of Arms, a saltire between four fleurs-de-lis, with the legend &quot;Tywardreath&quot;. The arms are derived from those of the priory: the saltire for St Andrew, the patron of the priory and parish church; the fleur-de-lis for the French mother house at Angers.

Tywardreath was recorded in the Domesday Book (1086) when it was one of 28 manors held by Richard from Robert, Count of Mortain. There were 2 hides of land and land for 12 ploughs. One virgate of land was held by Richard with 4 ploughs and 7 serfs; 8 villeins and 18 smallholders had the rest of the land with 3 ploughs. There were 6 acres of woodland and 100 acres of pasture. The manor was valued at £2 though it had formerly been worth £4.

Although the civil parish is shown under Tywardreath and Par, there is an electoral ward (which also includes Par) shown under the name of &quot;Tywardreath&quot; only. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 4,897.

==Tywardreath Priory==

The settlement grew out of a Benedictine priory established at around the time of the Norman conquest. Founded from the Abbey of SS Sergius and Bacchus, Angers in France, it was founded to contain only about seven monks, the endowment being sufficient for that number. The house was poor but powerful in the area, controlling the port of Fowey and having lands scattered over Cornwall. Being regarded as an alien priory subject to a French mother house, the Crown frequently took it into its &#x27;protection&#x27;, taking all its temporal income for itself, as the alien houses&#x27; loyalty to the English crown was suspect, and they were sending profits from their English lands to &quot;enemies&quot; abroad. The Crown&#x27;s action transferred the money from the coffers of a French abbot to those of an English king. The result was a poor, demoralised monastery, devoid of its monks, who were expelled in the early 1400s. A slow revival from about 1406 brought English monks into the house, and it regained its prestige and much of the property it had lost, having become &#x27;denizen&#x27;, i.e. naturalised as English. However, by 1535 and the &quot;Valor Ecclesiasticus&quot; the priory was valued at less than £200 annually, and like many others it was suppressed by the Crown in 1536. Nothing survives of the monastery today, except some carved stones in the parish church, next to where the priory stood. Attempts are being made to explore the site using modern archaeological methods. A modern story (Methuen&#x27;s &#x27;Little Guide - Cornwall, July 2016) implausibly explains the lack of remains of the priory by saying the last prior shipped the stone back to France.

===Corrody in Tywardreath Priory===
A corrody was an annual charge on the priory&#x27;s income, originally a voucher issued by the priory to pay board and lodging of founders whilst visiting, and later monetised and used by kings as transferable pensions. In 1486 Henry VII recommended his servant William Martyn for a corrody of 5 marks (£3 6s. 8d.) a year charged on the manors of Tywardreath and Trenant. A corrody, no doubt the same one, was held in this Priory in 1509 by Hugh Denys of Osterley (died 1511), Groom of the King&#x27;s Close Stool to Henry VII. On the death of Denys, Henry VIII transferred the corrody (&quot;in the King&#x27;s gift by death of Hugh Denys&quot;) to John Porth, another courtier.

==St Andrew&#x27;s Church==
St Andrew&#x27;s Church was first dedicated in 1343 but was extensively rebuilt, at a cost of £3,000, reopening on 8 September 1880. With the exception of the tower and arcade the church was rebuilt by the architect Richard Coad of Liskeard. The new organ was supplied by Hele &amp; Co, of Plymouth. The tower houses a peal of six bells. Memorials include those to the Harris family, active in the English Civil War. Philip Rashleigh, of Menabilly, the famous mineralogist and MP for Fowey, is buried here. In 1880 following the rebuild, the bench ends of the Rashleigh aisle recorded the history of the family from Jonathan Rashleigh of 1338, and the many Cornish and Devon families they have married into.

==Historic estates==
There is a Cornish cross outside the northwest angle of Tregaminion chapel. Another cross is also in the chapel grounds; this was found in 1889 in use as a footbridge in Lostwithiel.

Andrew Langdon (1994) records five crosses in the parish of Tywardreath. These are two at Tregaminion, two at Menabilly and Trenython Cross. The crosses at Menabilly are Methrose Cross and Barrs Cross. The former was originally in the parish of Luxulyan and the latter on the boundary of the parishes of St Sampson and Lanlivery. Trenython Cross was found in 1898 by John Gott, Bishop of Truro; it was re-erected in the grounds in 1987.

===Menabilly===

Within the parish is the historic estate of Menabilly, long the seat of the Rashleigh family, in 1873 the largest landowners in Cornwall.

At Tregaminion was a private chapel belonging to the Rashleighs of Menabilly.

===Trenython===
Outside the village on the road up to Castle Dore is Trenython Manor (, meaning &quot;the gorse farm&quot;). It was originally built for Colonel Peard in thanks from Garibaldi for support during his Italian struggle. For 15 years from 1891 it was the bishop&#x27;s palace for the Diocese of Truro. For half of the 20th century it was a railway convalescent home.

A local paper at the time reported: &quot;Trenython, the seventh Railwaymen&#x27;s convalescent home, was opened by Viscount Churchill, chairman of the GWR. It has accommodation for 85 men – the cost of refurbishment about £25,000 – and the architect was Mr B. Andrew of St Austell. The two Egyptian Pillars standing sentinel inside the front door had originated from the Temple of Ephesus and are thousands of years old. Trenython is to be a self-contained institution with its own water supply, own electric system and own sewerage system.&quot; Today Trenython Manor is a country house hotel.

==Cornish wrestling==
Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, were held at Tywardreath in a field adjoining the New Inn.

==Freemasonry==
Tywardreath has a single storey Masonic Centre at the junction of Southpark Road and Woodland Road. The building is owned by Saint Andrew Lodge No. 1151 and is home to nine Masonic bodies, including four Craft Lodges; a Royal Arch chapter; a Mark lodge; a Royal Ark Mariners lodge; an Allied Masonic Degrees council and an Irish council of Knight Masons making it one of the most active Masonic centres in Mid Cornwall.

<text>The United People&#x27;s Party was a political party in Singapore, formed by the former People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) leader Ong Eng Guan in 1961. 

After it won a seat in the Legislative Assembly (won by Ong Eng Guan), in the 1963 General Elections, the party&#x27;s existence was in doubt as Singapore was knocked out of the Malaysian federation by Malaysia. In June 1965, Ong resigned from his seat and the seat was subsequently won back by the PAP in the by-election. By the 1968 election, the party had dissolved.

<doc id="1344086" wikidata="Q5354902" url="?curid=1344086" title="Elections in China">
<text>Elections in the People&#x27;s Republic of China occur under a one-party authoritarian political system controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Direct elections, except in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, occur only at the local level people&#x27;s congresses and village committees, with all candidate nominations preapproved by the CCP. By law, all elections at all levels must adhere to the leadership of the CCP.

Since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, elections have been highly constrained by the CCP&#x27;s monopoly on power, limitations on free speech, and party control over nominations. Elections are not pluralistic as no opposition is allowed. Rory Truex, a researcher of Chinese politics at Princeton University, states that &quot;the CCP tightly controls the nomination and election processes at every level in the people&#x27;s congress system...the tiered, indirect electoral mechanism in the People&#x27;s Congress system ensures that deputies at the highest levels face no semblance of electoral accountability to the Chinese citizenry.&quot;

Local people&#x27;s congresses are directly elected under the control of the CCP. All higher levels of people&#x27;s congresses up to the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC), the highest organ of state power, are indirectly elected by the people&#x27;s congress of the level immediately below. Candidate nominations at all levels are controlled by the CCP, and CCP&#x27;s supreme position is enshrined in the country&#x27;s constitution.

==Electoral system==

=== Direct elections ===
People&#x27;s congresses of cities that are not divided into districts (), counties (), city districts (), towns (), townships (), and lastly ethnic townships (), are directly elected. Additionally, village () committee members and chairpersons are directly elected.

====Local People&#x27;s Congresses====
Under the electoral law of 1 July 1979, nomination of candidates for direct local elections (in counties, townships, etc.) can be made by the CCP, the various other political parties, mass organizations, or any voter seconded by at least 10 other voters. The final list of electoral candidates must be worked out through &quot;discussion and consultation&quot; or primary elections, which officially is conducted by an election committee in consultation with small groups of voters; though the candidates are chosen by CCP officials in practice. Election committee members are appointed by the standing committees of the people&#x27;s congresses at the corresponding level. The process used for competitive races is known as the &quot;three ups and three downs&quot; (, ). According to the Chinese government, the &quot;three ups and three downs&quot; process is supposed to operate as follows:

* the election committee collates all of the nominations, checks them, and publishes the list of nominees and their basic details (first &quot;up&quot;). The published list is given to groups of electors, comprising the voters in each geographical or institutional electorate for discussion (first &quot;down&quot;);
* the views of the groups of electors are conveyed via group representatives at a committee meeting, in order to reduce the number of candidates (second &quot;up&quot;). The views of different elector groups and the discussions at the committee meeting are then conveyed to voters, and their views are sought (second &quot;down&quot;); and
* the views of the groups of electors are once again collated and reported to the election committee which, by reference to the views of the majority of electors, determine the final list of candidates (third &quot;up&quot;). The list of names and basic details is published by electorate (third &quot;down&quot;).

The number of candidates for a direct election should be 1.3 to 2 times the number of deputies to be elected. Where the people&#x27;s congresses above the county level elect deputies at the next higher level, the number of candidates should be 1.2 to 1.5 times the number of deputies to be elected. Voting is done by secret ballot, and voters are entitled to recall elections.

Eligible voters, and their electoral districts, are chosen from the family () or work unit ( or ) registers for rural and urban voters, respectively, which are then submitted to the election committees after cross-examination by electoral district leaders.

Deputies are elected from either single-member districts or multi-member districts using a modified form of block combined approval voting in which a voter is allowed as many votes as there are seats to be filled (only one option may be selected per candidate), with the option to vote for or against a candidate, or abstain. The maximum number of deputies per district is three deputies, and each district within the same administrative region must have approximately an equal number of people. Candidates must obtain a majority of votes to be elected. If the number of candidates to receive over 50% of the vote is more than the number of deputies to be elected, only those who have obtained the highest vote up to the number of seats available win. A tied vote between candidates is settled with a run-off election. If the number of deputies elected is less than the number of deputies to be elected, a run-off election is held to fill the remaining seat(s). In the run-off election, the candidate(s) who receives the most votes is elected a local deputy; however, a candidate has to win at least one-third of the votes in the run-off to be elected. Vacancies are filled using by-elections.

====Heads of Local People&#x27;s Governments====
Heads of People&#x27;s Governments are formally elected by the People&#x27;s Congress of that level pursuant to the Organic Law on Local People&#x27;s Congresses and Governments, but the heads of township governments have been experimentally elected by the people through various mechanisms. There are several models used:

* direct nomination and election ()
* direction election ()
* two ballots in three rounds ()
* competition based on mass recommendation ()
* nomination and election by the masses ( or ; literally &quot;sea election&quot;)
* public recommendation and public election ()
* vote of confidence ()

====Village chiefs====

After taking power in 1978, Deng Xiaoping experimented with direct democracy at the local level. Villages have been traditionally the lowest level of government in China&#x27;s complicated hierarchy of governance. Under the Organic Law of Village Committees, all of China&#x27;s approximately 1 million villages are expected to hold competitive, direct elections for sub-governmental village committees. A 1998 revision to the law called for improvements in the nominating process and enhanced transparency in village committee administration. The revised law also explicitly transferred the power to nominate candidates to villagers themselves, as opposed to village groups or CCP branches.

Many have criticized the locally elected representatives as serving as &quot;rubber stamps&quot;, with the local CCP secretaries still holding the ultimate power, though during some eras the Communists have flirted with the idea of potentially allowing some competition. In the early 1980s, a few southern villages began implementing &quot;Vote for your Chief&quot; policies, in which free elections are intended to be held for the election of a village chief, who holds a lot of power and influence traditionally in rural society. Many of these multi-candidate elections were successful, involving candidate debates, formal platforms, and the initiation of secret ballot boxes. Initial reforms did not include universal suffrage. Such an election comprises usually no more than 2000 voters, and the first-past-the-post system is used in determining the winner, with no restriction on political affiliation. The elections, initially held every three years but later changed to five, are always supervised by a higher level of government, usually by a county-level government. Part of the reason for these early elections was to shift the responsibility of ensuring good performance and reduced corruption of local leaders from the Chinese bureaucracy to the local villagers.

Since 2018, the central authorities in the CCP officially called for the &quot;yijiantiao&quot; () model, in which the village committees and the CCP village committees to have the same membership, with both led by the CCP village committee secretary. It announced in a five-year plan in 2018 that one-third of the more than 500,000 &quot;administrative villages&quot; were already following this system, and called for at least half of the village leaderships to follow this system. This had led to tighter vetting of candidates, involving blocking activists and others deemed to transgress political sensitivities.

A 2022 study conducted by the American Economic Association delved into the implementation of village elections in rural China and the eventual decline in village autonomy in later years. The researchers posited that this decline is linked to bureaucratic capability. As the administrative capacity at the village level strengthens, autocratic figures curtail the influence of elected bodies to reassert control.

===Indirect elections===
People&#x27;s Congresses of provinces (), directly administered municipalities (), and cities divided into districts () are indirectly elected by the People&#x27;s Congress of the level immediately below. Governors, mayors, and heads of counties, districts, townships and towns are elected by the respective local People&#x27;s Congresses. Presidents of people&#x27;s courts and the regional prosecutors general of people&#x27;s procuratorates are elected by the respective local People&#x27;s Congresses above the county level.

====Local People&#x27;s Governments====
The Local People&#x27;s Congress at each administrative level—other than the village level in rural areas, which hold direct elections—elects candidates for executive positions at that level of government and the Chairmen/Chairwomen of their regional People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committees.

====National People&#x27;s Congress====
The National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) has 2,977 members, elected for five year terms. Deputies are elected (over a three-month period) by the people&#x27;s congresses of the provinces of China, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, as well as by electoral college in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, and by the armed forces which function as at-large electoral districts. Generally, seats are apportioned to each electoral district in proportion to their population, though the system for apportioning seats for Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army differ. No electoral district may be apportioned fewer than 15 seats in the NPC.

The NPC elects and appoints the following personnel:

* President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China
* Vice President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China
* Chairperson of the Central Military Commission (PRC)
* Director of the National Supervisory Commission
* President of the Supreme People&#x27;s Court
* Procurator-General of the Supreme People&#x27;s Procuratorate

The NPC also appoints the premier of the State Council based on the president&#x27;s nomination, other members of the State Council based on the premier&#x27;s nomination, and other members of the Central Military Commission based on the CMC chair&#x27;s nomination.

== Party control ==
Elections in China occur under a political system controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), with all candidate nominations preapproved by the CCP. CCP regulations require members of the People&#x27;s Congresses, People&#x27;s Governments, and People&#x27;s Courts to implement CCP recommendations (including nominations). Elected leaders remain subordinate to the corresponding CCP secretary, and most are appointed by higher-level party organizations.

There are a small number of independent candidates for people&#x27;s congress, particularly in neighborhoods of major cities, who sometimes campaign using Weibo. Independent candidates are strongly discouraged and face government intervention in their campaigns. In practice, the power of parties other than the CCP is eliminated. Because none of the minor parties have independent bases of support and rely on CCP approval for appointment to positions of power, none have true political power independent of the CCP. Whereas there are CCP committees in people&#x27;s congresses at all levels, none of the other parties operate any form of party parliamentary groups.

==Legislation==
The first electoral law was passed in March 1953, and the second on 1 July 1979. The 1979 law allowed for ordinary voters to nominate candidates, unlike the 1953 law which provided no such mechanism. The 1979 law was revised in 1982, removing the reference to the ability of political parties, mass organizations, and voters to use &quot;various forms of publicity&quot;, and instead instructing that the &quot;election committees should introduce the candidates to the voters; the political parties, mass organizations, and voters who recommend the candidates can introduce them at group meetings of the voters&quot;. In 1986, the election law was amended to disallow primary elections.

Traditionally, village chiefs were appointed by the township government. The Organic Law of Village Committees was enacted in 1987 and implemented in 1988, allowing for direct election of village chiefs instead. The 2020 revisions to the electoral law mandated that all elections at all levels must adhere to the leadership of the CCP.

== International rankings ==
China is the 3rd least electorally democratic country in the world and second least electoral democratic country in Asia according to 2023 V-Dem Democracy indices. Freedom House rates the People&#x27;s Republic of China as 0 out of 4 for freedom of the electoral process.

==Criticism==
The performed elections in China do not meet free and fair election criteria such as ballot access and political media access. Freedom of political speech and freedom of political assembly are all severely restricted by the government. The general Chinese public has virtually no say on how the top leaders of the country are elected. Political censorship is widespread and political dissent is harshly punished in the country.

<text>Stahlhammer (German for &quot;Steel Hammer&quot;) is a Neue Deutsche Härte band from Austria that formed in 1992. They incorporate elements from hardcore, groove metal, industrial metal and symphonic metal into their songs. The band has to this date released six albums, where the majority of songs are in German. Their latest album is &quot;Opera Noir&quot;, which was released in March 2006.

== History ==
Stahlhammer is one of the most popular bands to ever come out of Austria. The band name was originally going to be &quot;Eisenherz&quot;, but copyright laws for the German &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; stories prohibited this, though this later became the name of their fourth album. Their first album &quot;Killer Instinkt&quot;, released in 1995, became widely known throughout Austria and Germany due to the success of their video for the Pink Floyd cover &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;. Among Stahlhammer&#x27;s several covers is a metal-styled version of MC Hammer&#x27;s famous hit &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot;.

<doc id="1344090" wikidata="Q1650555" url="?curid=1344090" title="Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant">
<text>The Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant is located on the Tennessee River near Decatur and Athens, Alabama, on the north side (right bank) of Wheeler Lake. The site has three General Electric boiling water reactor (BWR) nuclear generating units and is owned entirely by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). With a generating capacity of nearly 3.8 gigawatts, it is the third most powerful nuclear power plant in the United States, behind the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant in Arizona and the Vogtle Nuclear Power Plant in Georgia, and the most powerful generating station operated by TVA.

==History==
The nuclear power plant is named after a ferry that operated at the site until the middle of the 20th century. (Brown&#x27;s Ferry)
Browns Ferry was TVA&#x27;s first nuclear power plant; its approval occurred on June 17, 1966 and construction began in September 1966. In 1974, the time of its initial operation, it was the largest nuclear plant in the world. It was the first nuclear plant to use units capable of generating more than 1 gigawatt of power. The lake provides main cooling, and 7 additional Mechanical Draft &quot;helper&quot; cooling towers assist during limitations on water temperature. The 600 ft concrete chimney vents gases.

In 2006, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) renewed the licenses for all three reactors, extending their operation for an additional twenty years past their original 40-year licensing period.

TVA employs 1,500 people at the plant, making it the second largest employer in Limestone County, Alabama after only the Toyota-Mazda factory near Greenbrier

During the January 2024 Snowstorms, the Browns Ferry Plant reached its capacity of 3,954Mw, and was serving 2 million customers within the Tennessee Valley area.

== Power uprates ==
On August 16, 2017, the NRC approved TVA&#x27;s request for a 14.3% uprate of each reactor&#x27;s output. Each unit&#x27;s gross electrical output was 1,155 MWe (1,101 MWe net), but after power uprates during refueling outages in Fall 2018 for Unit 1, Spring 2019 for Unit 2, and Spring 2018 for Unit 3, the gross electrical output for each unit was increased to 1,310 MWe (1,256 MWe net). The uprate for Unit 3 was completed in July 2018, and in January 2019 for Unit 1. The final uprate, for Unit 2, was completed in August 2019, completing the $475 million project.

The electrical power increase of each unit was facilitated by the maximum operating thermal output of each reactor being increased from 3,458 MWth to 3,952 MWth.

== Electricity Production ==
The graph represents the annual electricity generation at the site in GWh.

== Unit 1 ==
Unit 1 is a 1,256 MWe net BWR/4 built by General Electric. Construction started on Unit 1 on September 12, 1966 and first powered up for testing on December 20, 1973. Commercial operation began on August 1, 1974. It was licensed to operate through December 20, 2013. Unit 1 was shut down for a year after a fire in 1975 damaged the unit. The unit was subsequently repaired and operated from 1976 through March 3, 1985, when all three Browns Ferry units were shut down for operational and management issues.

Starting in 2002, TVA undertook an effort to restore Unit 1 to operational status, spending $1.8 billion USD to do so. The NRC approved the restart of Unit 1 on May 15, 2007 and the reactor was brought up to criticality on May 22. During initial testing after restart, on May 24, 2007, a leaky hydraulic control pipe in the turbine hall burst, spilling about of non-radioactive fluid, and the newly restarted reactor was temporarily powered down. Reactor power-up and tests resumed on May 27 and the unit started supplying power to the electricity supply grid on June 2, 2007, reaching full power on June 8. The Browns Ferry restart was estimated to pay for itself in five years.

On May 4, 2006, NRC issued a renewed license, adding twenty years to operate through December 20, 2033.

Unit 1 generated 9,801 GWh of electricity in 2017, achieving a capacity factor of 101.62%.

=== Unit 1 fire ===

On March 22, 1975 a fire started when a worker using a candle to search for air leaks accidentally set a temporary cable seal on fire. At Browns Ferry, foamed plastic, covered on both sides with two coats of a flame retardant paint, was used as a firestop. The fire spread from the temporary seal into the foamed plastic, causing significant damage to the reactor control cabling in the station.

An NRC bulletin explained the circumstances of the fire.

The fire started in the cable spreading room at a cable penetration through the wall between the cable spreading room and the reactor building for Unit 1. A slight differential pressure is maintained (by design) across this wall, with the higher pressure being on the cable spreading room side. The penetration seal originally present had been breached to install additional cables required by a design modification. Site personnel were resealing the penetration after cable installation and were checking the airflow through a temporary seal with a candle flame prior to installing the permanent sealing material. The temporary sealing material was highly combustible, and caught fire. Efforts were made by the workers to extinguish the fire at its origin, but they apparently did not recognize that the fire, under the influence of the draft through the penetration, was spreading on the reactor building side of the wall. The extent of the fire in the cable spreading room was limited to a few feet from the penetration; nonetheless, the presence of the fire on the other side of the wall from the point of ignition was not recognized until significant damage to cables related to the control of Units 1 and 2 had occurred.

This later resulted in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission making significant additions to the standards for fire protection through the publication of 10CFR50.48 and Appendix R. According to the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, the newly restarted Unit 1 does not comply with these standards. Unit 3 was not affected by the accident. This event was pivotal not just for firestopping in the nuclear field, but also in commercial and industrial construction. While the nuclear field went to installations of silicone foam, a wider array of firestops became prevalent in non-nuclear construction.

== Unit 2 ==
Unit 2 is a 1,259 MWe net BWR/4 built by General Electric that originally came online on August 2, 1974, and is licensed to operate through June 28, 2034. Unit 2 generated 8,396 GWh of electricity in 2017, achieving a capacity factor of 86.81%.

Unit 2 returned to service in 1991, after all three reactors were shut down in 1985. During a drought in August 2007, Unit 2 was shut down for one day because water temperature in the Tennessee River rose too high for the water to be used for cooling and then discharged back into the river.

Beginning in 2005 Unit 2 was loaded with BLEU (Blended Low Enriched Uranium) recovered by the DOE from weapons programs. This fuel contains quantities of U-236 and other contaminants because it was made from reprocessed fuel from weapons program reactors and therefore has slightly different characteristics when used in a reactor as compared to fresh uranium fuel. By making use of this fuel, which would otherwise have been disposed of as waste, the TVA is saving millions of dollars in fuel costs and accumulating a database of recycled uranium reactions in LWR use.

== Unit 3 ==
Unit 3 is a 1,260 MWe net BWR/4 built by General Electric that originally came online on August 18, 1976 with a capacity of 1,105 MWe net, and is licensed to operate through July 2, 2036. Unit 3 returned to service in 1995 after all three units were shut down in 1985 for maintenance and repairs. Unit 3 generated 9,651 GWh in 2017, achieving a capacity factor of 99.70%. The power update of 155 MWe was completed in July 2018.

==Additional incidents==

===March 19, 1985===
TVA decided to shut the entire plant down and keep it shut down indefinitely in order to focus on making improvements to all three units in order to bring it back into regulatory compliance following extremely negative assessments from the NRC.&lt;ref name=&quot;GAO/RCED-87-141&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Unit 2 finally resumed operation on May 24, 1991, with Unit 3 following it on November 1, 1995, although Unit 1 did not resume operation until June 2, 2007.

===May 10, 1986===
Cooling tower #4 (which was wide, long, and four stories tall) was destroyed in a fire caused by sparks from the electrical cooling fans in the tower hitting the abnormally dry redwood slats within the tower on May 10, 1986. During normal operation, water was kept flowing near-continuously over the redwood slats within the tower, but after close to two months of inactivity, the slats were very dry and extremely flammable. $5 million of damage was done.

===May 23, 1996===
Cooling tower #3 (which was in the process of being refurbished at the time) was heavily damaged in a fire on May 23, 1996, with about 80% of the tower destroyed.

=== August 19, 2006 ===
At 11:05 AM on August 19, 2006, Unit 3 was manually scrammed due to loss of both the 3A and 3B Reactor Recirculation pumps. The initial investigation found the Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) microprocessors non-responsive. The root cause of the event was that the VFD controls malfunctioned due to excessive traffic on the connected plant Integrated Control System (ICS) network. Corrective actions included installing network firewalls that limit the connections and traffic to the VFD controllers.

===April 27, 2011===

At 5:01 PM on April 27, 2011, all three reactors scrammed due to loss of external power caused by a tornado in the vicinity of the plant. Control rod insertion and cooling procedures operated as designed with no physical damage or release of radiation. Diesel backup generators provided power after a brief period of outage. An NRC Unusual Event, the lowest level of emergency classification, was declared due to loss of power exceeding 15 minutes. Additionally, a small oil leak was found on one generator. Due to widespread transmission grid damage from the storms, Browns Ferry was unable to produce power for the grid and significant blackouts occurred throughout the Southeastern United States.

=== January 2015 ===
A drain line leaked 100-200 gallons of water containing tritium levels above acceptable EPA drinking water standards. The leak was fixed within three hours of when it was discovered and was largely contained within the plant area.

=== May 2015 ===
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that 5 contract workers failed to conduct roving fire watch patrols as required by NRC. As a result, Tennessee Valley Authority was fined $140,000 for failing to maintain adequate fire watches in 2015 at Browns Ferry.

== Surrounding population ==

The 2010 U.S. population within of Browns Ferry was 39,930, an increase of 12.3 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. In 2020, the population within was about 1.4 million, an increase of 43 percent since 2010. Cities within 50 miles include Huntsville (28 miles to city center).

== Seismic risk ==
According to an NRC study using geological data from 1989 to 2008 which was published in August 2010, the estimated risk of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to reactor one was 1 in 270,270, and for reactors two and three, the risk was 1 in 185,185.

<text>David Yelldell (born October 1, 1981) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a goalkeeper and serves as an assistant coach for Sonnenhof Großaspach. Born in Stuttgart, Germany, he was capped for the United States national team.

==Club career==
Yelldell was the first choice goalkeeper for TuS Koblenz until suffering a knee ligament injury which kept him out of the final four matches of the 2009–10 2. Bundesliga season, when the club were relegated to the 3. Liga.

He signed with MSV Duisburg before the 2010–11 season and made his competitive debut for the club in a first round DFB-Pokal match against VfB Lübeck on August 13, 2010.

The next season saw him signing with Bundesliga giants Bayer Leverkusen. He made his debut and sole competitive appearance for the club in a first round DFB-Pokal match, a 4–3 surprise defeat at Dynamo Dresden on July 30, 2011.

==International career==
Born to a German mother and an African American father who was in the U.S. military, Yelldell holds dual citizenship and would have been eligible to play international soccer for either the United States or Germany. He was first called up by the US team in 2011 for a friendly against Argentina. He earned his first national team cap three days later, on March 29, 2011, in another friendly against Paraguay, replacing Marcus Hahnemann at half time. Despite not conceding during his time of play, the US lost this meeting 1–0.

<doc id="1344124" wikidata="Q3422662" url="?curid=1344124" title="Red Baron II">
<text>Red Baron II is a video game for the PC, developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line. It is the follow-up to the flight simulation &quot;Red Baron&quot;, released in 1990. &quot;Red Baron II&quot; was released in December 1997. A patch was released in 1998 that added support for 3D acceleration and renamed the game to Red Baron 3D. &quot;Red Baron 3D&quot; was also released as a retail product.

==Gameplay==
The game features four modes of play: Fly Now (a quick combat mode); Single Mission, which includes several missions and a mission generator to create new ones; Campaign mode, which features one of the only truly dynamic campaigns in a modern flight simulator and which replicates combat on the Western Front of Europe from 1916 through 1918; and peer-to-peer online play.

The game features many German, British, and French combat aircraft of World War I, and features pseudo-realistic flight physics and mechanics such as weapon malfunction, flak, engine damage, and pilot injury.

==Reception==
&quot;Red Baron II&quot; received above-average reviews. &quot;Next Generation&quot; called it &quot;a fine addition to the series, and despite small, technical shortcomings, it establishes itself as one of the most entertaining flight experiences on the market today.&quot;

The game was nominated for the &quot;Best Sim Game&quot; award at the &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot; Awards for 1997, which went to &quot;Jane&#x27;s Longbow 2&quot;.

In 2004, the staff of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; nominated the game&#x27;s &quot;Full Canvas Jacket&quot; mod for their 2003 &quot;Flight Simulation of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of Flight&quot;.

==Coupon==
Some copies of the game included a coupon for 75 cents off a 12-inch Red Baron pizza. In 2014, YouTube user Clint Basinger of Lazy Game Reviews found the coupon bundled in with the game and, after finding out the coupon had no expiration date, took the coupon to a Food Lion and bought himself a Red Baron pizza with the coupon.

==&quot;Red Baron 3D&quot;==
Red Baron 3D is a patch for Red Baron II which improves graphics and mechanics of the game and gives full multiplayer support. Red Baron 3D features 22 different flyable World War I aircraft, along with 18 other types flown by AI pilots.

===Reception===
&quot;Red Baron 3D&quot; received more favorable reviews than &quot;Red Baron II&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; said of the game, &quot;If you&#x27;ve ever hankered to climb into an open cockpit and do battle with the early knights of the sky, this is your baby. All you need is a leather helmet, a pair of goggles, and a white silk scarf.&quot;

The single-player campaign of Red Baron 3D received particular acclaim, with critics commending the game&#x27;s realistic portrayal of aerial combat and the various missions players were tasked with completing. The game&#x27;s AI was also noted as being challenging and unpredictable, keeping players engaged and on their toes throughout the campaign.

The game was nominated for &quot;Simulation of the Year&quot; at &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best &amp; Worst of 1998 Awards, which went to &quot;European Air War&quot;.

<text>Terminal Aérea metro station is a Mexico City Metro station in Venustiano Carranza, Mexico City. It is an underground station with two side platforms, serving Line 5 (the Yellow Line), between Oceanía and Hangares stations. The station serves the Mexico City International Airport and the nearby (neighborhoods) of Peñón de los Baños and Moctezuma 2ª sección along Boulevard Puerto Aéreo.

Terminal Aérea metro station opened on 19 December 1981, providing northwestward service toward Consulado metro station and eastward service toward Pantitlán metro station. The station&#x27;s pictogram features an airliner and a control tower, reflecting its proximity to the airport&#x27;s Terminal 1. Inside, there are six murals painted by David Lach. In 2019, the station had an average daily ridership of 18,389 passengers, ranking it the 96th busiest station in the network and the fourth busiest of the line.

==Location and layout==

Terminal Aérea is an underground metro station on Boulevard Puerto Aéreo, in Venustiano Carranza borough, in eastern Mexico City. It is located approximately away from the entrance to the Gate A of the Terminal 1 at Mexico City International Airport. 

Terminal Aérea metro station has two exits leading to Boulevard Puerto Aéreo, but none directly to the airport. The east exit is at the corner with Calle Aeropuerto Civil, in Colonia Peñón de los Baños, while the west entrance is found between Calle Norte 33 and Calle Oriente 33 in Colonia Moctezuma 2ª sección. On their &quot;Policy Review of Mexico&quot;, the OECD criticized the station for not having proper signage and for not being designed for travelers as they &quot;must negotiate over 110 steps&quot; to reach it. 

Within the system, the station lies between Oceanía and Hangares. The area is serviced by the Terminal 1 Metrobús station, belonging to Line 4, Line 4 (formerly Line G) of the trolleybus system, Routes 43 and 200 of the network, by Route  of the city&#x27;s public bus system, and the airport&#x27;s people mover, Aerotrén.

==History and construction==

Line 5 of the Mexico City Metro was built by Cometro, a subsidiary of Empresas ICA. Its first section, where Terminal Aérea station is located, was opened on 19 December 1981, running from Pantitlán to Consulado stations.

Terminal Aérea metro station was built with Santo Tomás marble floors, travertine marble walls, and stucco plafond. The track between Oceanía and Terminal Aérea stations spans , and descends from the grade level to the underground level, with a 4.9% slope at the time of its opening. For the opposite section toward Hangares, which is long, the tunnel was built with slurry walls using the Milan method.

Near the station, in Colonia Peñon de los Baños, workers found the remains of mammoths, bison, horses, camels, birds, and fishes, as well as a Teotihuacan settlement.

===Name and pictogram===
Before the station was built, Mexico City International Airport was serviced by the Aeropuerto station on Line 1 (the Pink line), located 15 blocks away to the south. After the Terminal Aérea metro station was constructed, many people continued to disembark at Aeropuerto station due to its confusing name and the station&#x27;s airliner silhouette pictogram. It was not until 1997 that the station was renamed &quot;Boulevard Puerto Aéreo&quot;, and the logo was updated to feature a logo of a bridge with a dome below, reflecting local landmarks. The pictogram for Terminal Aérea metro station depicts an airliner in front of a control tower instead.

===Incidents===
On 4 May 2015, a train crashed at Oceanía metro station when a train coming from Terminal Aérea crashed with another one parked at the end of the platforms. The crash was caused by a brake failure, coupled with heavy rain and hail. Terminal Aérea station was temporarily closed for repairs after the crash. 

Since 1981, subsidence caused by rain had increased the slope between both stations to at least 7%. To address the sinkings, a  tunnel extension was planned but canceled due to budget constrains. Instead, an roof that cost Mx$65 million was built to prevent the tracks from getting wet and reduce the risk of trains sliding.

From 1 to 16 March 2020, Terminal Aérea, Hangares, and Pantitlán stations were closed due to a gasoline leak at a surface petrol station.

===Ridership===
According to the data provided by the authorities, before the impact of the pandemic on public transport, commuters averaged per year between 15,700 and 18,400 daily entrances between 2014 and 2019; the station had a ridership of 6,712,062 passengers (18,389 passengers per day) passengers in 2019, marking an increase of 74,719 passengers compared to 2018. In 2019 specifically, Terminal Aérea metro station ranked as the 96th busiest of the system&#x27;s 195 stations and the line&#x27;s fourth busiest.

==Landmarks==
Terminal Aérea station has six murals painted by Mexican artist David Lach in 1981, becoming the first person to do it inside the Mexico City Metro. Four murals, titled &quot;Paisajes cálidos y fríos&quot;, are located on the platform&#x27;s headwalls, &quot;with Cálidos&quot; on the southern walls and &quot;Fríos&quot; on the northern walls. According to Lach, the red and green colors represent direction and temperature. The other two murals, &quot;Tlaltilco&quot; (in the east lobby) and &quot;Cuitzeo&quot; (in the west lobby), blend elements of  culture with contemporary Mexican imagery.

Near the station, a pedestrian bridge known as &quot;MacPuente&quot; is used as an informal observation deck where people gather to watch airplanes land and take off.

<doc id="1344135" wikidata="Q5863844" url="?curid=1344135" title="J. L. Garvin">
<text>James Louis Garvin (12 April 1868 – 23 January 1947) was a British journalist, editor, and author. In 1908, Garvin agreed to take over the editorship of the Sunday newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot;, revolutionising Sunday journalism and restoring the paper, which was facing financial troubles at the time, to profitability in the process.

==Youth and early years in journalism==
The youngest of two children, Garvin was born in Birkenhead. His father, Michael Garvin, was an impoverished Irish labourer who died at sea when Garvin was two, leaving him to be raised by his mother Catherine. Though a voracious reader, he left school at the age of thirteen and worked first as a messenger, then as a clerk. His elder brother, Michael, became a teacher; his status as the family&#x27;s primary source of income led them to move, first in 1884 to Hull, then to Newcastle five years later.

Despite undergoing examination to join the civil service, from an early age Garvin yearned to become an editor. As a teenager he contributed letters and articles to the &quot;Eastern Morning News&quot; and the Dublin &quot;Weekly Freeman&quot;, much of which reflected his early advocacy for Home Rule. In 1891, Garvin applied to Joseph Cowen for a position at the &quot;Newcastle Evening Chronicle&quot;. Given a position as a proof-reader and occasional contributor, Garvin spent the next eight years honing his skills as a journalist, with Cowen serving as his mentor and father-figure. Yet Garvin yearned for a larger stage, and by the end of the decade he became a regular (though anonymous) contributor to the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot;, then edited by W. L. Courtney.

Garvin&#x27;s ambition extended beyond Newcastle, however. Through his association with Courtney, Garvin gained a position as a leader-writer for the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in 1899. Moving to London, his writings on politics and literature soon earned him renown. By now his politics had changed, as he became a unionist and a follower of Joseph Chamberlain. In 1904, Garvin accepted the editorship of &quot;The Outlook&quot;, a weekly publication which was being turned into a platform for the promotion of Chamberlain&#x27;s scheme of tariff reform. Though &quot;The Outlook&quot; quickly saw a rise in circulation and influence, its failure to turn a profit led to the paper&#x27;s sale and Garvin&#x27;s exit two years later.

==Pre-war editorship of &quot;The Observer&quot;==

Soon after his departure from &quot;The Outlook&quot;, Garvin was approached by newspaper magnate Lord Northcliffe. Though he turned down a financially lucrative offer to write for Northcliffe&#x27;s flagship publication, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, in 1908 Garvin agreed to take over the editorship of the historic Sunday newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot;. First published in 1791, the paper had recently faced financial troubles that led to its acquisition by Northcliffe. Within eighteen months, Garvin had reshaped &quot;The Observer&quot;, revolutionising Sunday journalism and restoring the paper to profitability in the process.

With the Unionist Party still recovering from its massive defeat in the general election of 1906, Garvin soon emerged as a dominant figure in Unionist politics. Using &quot;The Observer&quot; as a platform, he denounced the budget introduced by Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George in 1909, and he encouraged the Unionist-dominated House of Lords to veto it. As the question of Home Rule for Ireland increasingly overshadowed British politics, Garvin advocated a federalist solution to the problem.

By 1911, a rift had emerged between Garvin and Northcliffe over the critical issue of tariff reform. When their dispute became public, the press baron agreed to sell the paper to William Waldorf Astor, who accepted Garvin&#x27;s proposal to assume editorship on condition that Garvin edit the Astor-owned &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; as well. In 1915, Astor gave the two papers to his son, Waldorf as a birthday gift; Waldorf Astor then sold the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, which allowed Garvin to leave his position with that paper and focus on editing &quot;The Observer&quot;.

==First World War==
Despite being an admirer of German culture, Garvin was alarmed by the growing challenge the country posed to Britain in international politics. Through his friendship with First Sea Lord Admiral John Fisher, he gained access to inside information on naval matters which he used to inform editorials calling for a greater naval construction programme. When war broke out in 1914, Garvin embraced Britain&#x27;s involvement in the conflict. He was close to many people in power, most notably Fisher (who left retirement to return to his former position as First Sea Lord soon after the start of the conflict), Lloyd George, and Winston Churchill, and he enjoyed considerable influence during this period.

Yet the conflict brought great personal tragedy to Garvin. At the start of the war his only son Roland Gerard Garvin (known to his family as &quot;Ged&quot;) enlisted with the South Lancashire Regiment and was shipped to France. Though subsequently assigned a staff position, Ged transferred back to a combat posting soon after the start of the Somme campaign and was killed in a night assault on German line in late July. Heartbroken at the loss, Garvin never recovered from Ged&#x27;s death, and it shaped many of his attitudes to subsequent events.

Despite his bitterness towards the Germans, Garvin believed in the need for a just settlement of the war. Soon after the armistice he published his first book, &quot;The Economic Foundations of Peace&quot;, in which he called for a lenient treaty and Anglo-American co-operation as the cornerstone for an effective League of Nations. When the punitive terms of the Treaty of Versailles were published, he denounced it in an editorial as leaving the Germans &quot;no real hope except in revenge.&quot;

==Later years==
In 1921, Garvin moved from London to Beaconsfield. From there, in a home once owned by Edmund Burke&#x27;s agent he continued to edit &quot;The Observer&quot;, and he began work on a biography of his hero Joseph Chamberlain. Though three volumes of the Chamberlain biography were published in the early 1930s, Garvin never wrote the final fourth volume, and the project was completed after his death by Julian Amery. During this period Garvin also served as editor-in-chief of the fourteenth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1926–1932).

Yet Garvin&#x27;s stature as a man of letters masked his declining influence during this period. Working from Beaconsfield cut him off from much of the political life of the British capital. A new generation of British politicians emerged with whom Garvin had few connections. Alarmed by Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in Germany, he pushed for a programme of rearmament. He also became an advocate of appeasement, both of Hitler to buy time for rearmament, and Benito Mussolini in an effort to win the Italian leader&#x27;s support for an alliance.

Saddened by the outbreak of war in September 1939, Garvin nonetheless was a strong supporter of the war effort. Heartened by Churchill&#x27;s return to the Admiralty, Garvin offered unflinching support for his old friend after he became Prime Minister in May 1940. Such support created a rift between Garvin and Astor. Though the two had been of like mind regarding appeasement, Astor opposed the concentration of war powers in Churchill&#x27;s hands. Adding to the tension was Astor&#x27;s son David, whose attempts to inject a more liberal tone into the newspaper were viewed by Garvin as an effort to criticise the Prime Minister. As a result, when Garvin published an editorial in February 1942 in support of Churchill remaining in office as Minister of Defence as well as Prime Minister, the Astors viewed it as a breach of their contract and requested Garvin&#x27;s resignation.

Garvin was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1941 New Year&#x27;s Honours List. He had previously declined honours from Lloyd George in 1918, and Ramsay MacDonald in 1929.

Garvin quickly received, and accepted, an offer from Lord Beaverbrook to write a weekly column for his newspaper the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;. Switching to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in January 1945, Garvin continued to write a weekly column until just prior to his death from pneumonia at the age of 78.

==Personal life==
Garvin was married twice. In 1894 he married Christina Ellen Wilson, who bore him his son Ged and four daughters: Viola, Una, Katherine, and Ursula. After Christina&#x27;s death in 1918, Garvin married Viola Woods (née Taylor), the former wife of Unionist politician Maurice Woods.

<doc id="1344139" wikidata="Q5283122" url="?curid=1344139" title="Distributed Objects Everywhere">
<text>Distributed Objects Everywhere (DOE) was a long-running Sun Microsystems project to build a distributed computing environment based on the CORBA system in the &#x27;back end&#x27; and OpenStep as the user interface. First started in 1990 and announced soon thereafter, it remained vaporware for many years before it was finally released as NEO in 1995. It was sold for only a short period before being dropped (along with OpenStep) in 1996. In its place is what is today known as Enterprise JavaBeans.

== Background ==
In the early 1990s the &#x27;next big thing&#x27; in computing was to use desktop microcomputers to display and edit data being provided by mainframes and minicomputers. Although a number of methods for this sort of access already existed, the division of labor was not at all even. For instance, SQL required the workstation to download huge data sets and then process them locally, whereas use of terminal emulators left all of the work to the server and provided no GUI.

It seemed that the proper split of duties would be to have a cooperative set of objects, the workstation being responsible for display and user interaction, with processing on the server. Standing in the way of this sort of solution was the massive differences in operating systems and programming languages between platforms. While it might be possible to build such a system that would work on any one combination of workstation and server, the same solution would not work on any other system.

Oddly, the differences between any two programming languages on a single platform was almost as great. Each language had its own format for passing parameters into procedure calls, the file formats that they generated were often quite different. In general terms, it was not always possible to write different portions of a program in different languages, although doing so often has real utility. The problem was not so acute on minicomputers and mainframes where the vendor often specified standards for their libraries, but on microcomputers the programming systems were generally delivered by a variety of 3rd party companies with no interest in standardization.

Nevertheless, this problem was being addressed in the early 1990s through the introduction of various shared library systems. These were actually intended to ease resource use on smaller platforms, by allowing a number of programs using a common resource, like the GUI, to share a single copy of code instead of each loading a separate copy into memory. As a side effect of being able to be called from many programs, these systems also defined a standard way to call them, using an interface definition language, or IDL, to allow any language on the platform to understand the code inside the library.

Extending these systems to support remote procedure calls behind the scenes was seen as a natural evolution, providing a solution to the client/server programming problem. At the time there were a number of major projects to deliver such a system, including IBM&#x27;s System Object Model (SOM/DSOM), NeXT&#x27;s Portable Distributed Objects, Microsoft&#x27;s Component Object Model (COM/DCOM) and many CORBA flavors. Sun, attempting to position itself as the future IBM in terms of backoffice support, felt they had to attack this market as well.

== Spring, DOE, OpenStep, NEO ==
Sun&#x27;s solution was based on work in their Spring operating system, which used intercommunicating objects for almost all programming tasks. Modifying this to work under a &#x27;traditional&#x27; Unix like Solaris was not all that difficult, although Unix makes the assumption that all programs run locally, and an interface for remote access had to be added. For this, DOE added an object request broker (ORB) that ran on the backoffice servers, listening for DOE requests and handing them off to the proper program to be handled. During development, CORBA became a key buzzword in the industry. This prompted a delay while the ORB was re-engineered for CORBA support. Under the CORBA model, different objects, like those from DOE or SOM, would be able to interact by sharing a common interface.

A bigger problem for Sun is that they had no integrated desktop object programming solution. Although C++ object libraries were becoming common on some platforms, their own SunOS (later known as Solaris) operating system and associated SunView and X window systems were &#x27;plain C&#x27; based, while their newer NeWS windowing environment was based on a network-extensible object oriented dialect of PostScript.

In order to supply a comprehensive and flexible object programming solution, Sun turned to NeXT and the two developed OpenStep. The idea was to have OpenStep programs calling DOE objects on Sun servers, providing a backoffice-to-frontoffice solution on Sun machines. OpenStep was not released until 1993, further delaying the project.

By the time DOE, now known as NEO, was released in 1995, Sun had already moved on to Java as their next big thing. Java was now the GUI of choice for client-side applications, and Sun&#x27;s OpenStep plans were quietly dropped (see Lighthouse Design). NEO was re-positioned as a Java system with the introduction of the &quot;Joe&quot; framework, but it saw little use. Components of NEO and Joe were eventually subsumed into Enterprise JavaBeans.

Although distributed objects, and CORBA in particular, were the &quot;next big thing&quot; in the early 1990s, by the second half of the decade interest in them had essentially disappeared. Web-based applications running entirely on the server became the new &quot;next big thing&quot;, and the need for a powerful display system on the client side faded, largely replaced by lightweight GUIs based on HTML and JavaScript (&quot;Browser User Interfaces&quot;).

<text>Silviu Brucan (born Saul Bruckner; 18 January 1916 – 14 September 2006) was a Romanian communist politician. 
He became a critic of the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaușescu. After the Romanian Revolution, Brucan became a political analyst.

==Early life==
He was born in Bucharest to wealthy Jewish parents living in Berzei Street, near Matache Măcelaru Market. His father was a wholesale wool merchant who imported fabrics from England in the aftermath of World War I, suits of fine English fabrics being a luxury item that was popular among the Romanian bourgeoisie that was rising in the wake of an economic boom. He attended the German-language &quot;Evangelische Schule&quot; of Luterană Street and the Saint Sava National College.

In 1929 came the Wall Street Crash, leading to the Great Depression and a slump in the luxury industry, including English clothes. As a result, Brucan&#x27;s father&#x27;s shop in Șepcari Street went bankrupt, and the Brucan family was left penniless. They moved into a modest apartment on Vlad Țepeș Street. Brucan&#x27;s father found a job as a fabric expert working for a German merchant, but as that was not enough to feed a family of six, Silviu Brucan began giving private lessons to pupils of wealthy families, thus gaining access to the world of the rich landowners and industrialists. In his memories, Brucan said that the sharp contrast between the world of luxury of the privileged classes and the misery of those who worked hard all day to earn a living and the feeling of social injustice strongly influenced him.

As a social outcast (his father had been indicted for fraudulent bankruptcy) and as a Jew in the 1930s, he was prevented by the Iron Guard supporters from formally studying at the University of Bucharest. Nevertheless, with the help of some friends, he attended some courses at the university, such as the lectures of historian Nicolae Iorga, the philosopher Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, the aesthetician Tudor Vianu, and the philosopher Nae Ionescu.

==Early activism==
Brucan joined the left-wing movement at the age of 18. He was attracted by the opinions found in leftist and antifascist weekly newspapers such as &quot;Stînga&quot; (The Left), &quot;Era Nouă&quot; (New Era) and &quot;Cuvîntul Liber&quot; (Free Word). Brucan joined communist groups, which organized &quot;cultural evenings&quot; at the houses of some supporter. There, he met literate communist supporters such as Alexandru Sahia. He began reading Marxist literature and soon was co-opted into party operations, being asked to hide some illegal party documents (speeches at a Comintern meeting in Prague) at his home.

In 1935, the moderate left-wing &quot;Dimineața&quot; newspaper was competing against &quot;Universul&quot;, a nationalist right-wing newspaper. To eliminate his rival, the owner of &quot;Universul&quot;, Stelian Popescu, began an anti-Semitic campaign (the owners of &quot;Dimineața&quot; were Jews) leading to fascists burning copies of the newspaper and associated posters. The communist and socialist youth organized vigilante groups to defend the newsstands. In his memoirs, Brucan stated that he was part of one of the left-wing groups defending the newsstands at Gara de Nord, and was involved in a fight with Iron Guard supporters, sustaining a severe head injury.

He subsequently worked as a journalist, first writing a fashionable social column at &quot;Gazeta de seară&quot;, then working as a proofreader at &quot;Adevărul Literar&quot; Brucan met Aurel Alicu, a leader of the National Peasant Youth, with whom he started in 1937 a weekly called &quot;Dacia Nouă&quot;, having writers from both the traditional parties (National Liberal and National Peasants Party) and from left-wing circles (Miron Constantinescu, Corneliu Mănescu, Roman Moldovan, and Victor Iliu). The newspaper was published for a year until the Octavian Goga government shut it down.

In late 1938, he was conscripted, serving at a border guard unit at the frontier with Bulgaria, where he was acquainted with both komitadji extremists who attacked Romanian outposts, the Aromanian colonists in Southern Dobruja, and the Middle Eastern smugglers who illegally crossed the border with hashish or opium.

During World War II, Brucan lived in the attic of a house in a quiet area in Cotroceni, working as an illegal press worker for the Communist Party&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Scînteia&quot;. In 1943, he was arrested by a police agent who accidentally noticed him on Buzești Street, recalling his face from a photograph of a fellow Communist who had been previously arrested. However, as the police could not find any incriminating evidence, he was released a few days later.

==After the 23 August 1944 coup==
In September 1944, upon Romania&#x27;s exit from the Axis camp and the onset of Soviet occupation, he was named the general secretary of &quot;Scînteia&quot; (the deputy editor in chief to Leonte Răutu), the official newspaper of the Communist Party.

As long as the other newspapers still were published, &quot;Scînteia&quot; competed with them for the readers and Brucan, with the rest of the editors, tried to make a professional newspaper. However, Brucan recounts that as party newspapers and independent newspapers were forcibly closed, one by one, by the new communist authorities, the &quot;Scînteia&quot; journalists became office clerks working 9 to 5 and writing ideological editorials for the indoctrination of the workers, who were &quot;full of hope for a glorious future&quot;.

As editor of &quot;Scînteia&quot;, he supported the prison sentences of Iuliu Maniu, Gheorghe I. Brătianu, and Corneliu Coposu (&quot;see Tămădău Affair&quot;). He also supported the repression of anti-communist journalists, such as Radu Gyr and Pamfil Șeicaru, asking for the death penalty for the latter.

During this period, Brucan&#x27;s wife, the Stalinist Alexandra Sidorovici (with whom he had three children: daughter Anca, and sons Dinu and Vlad), became a public prosecutor of the Romanian People&#x27;s Tribunals, which allowed her to ask for death sentences for many war criminals; the sister of Teofil Sidorovici, she was a member of the &quot;nomenklatura&quot; of the Communist government.

For a short while (1948–1949), Brucan was Professor of Journalism at the University of Bucharest, although he never graduated from college.

A close collaborator of Communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Brucan, along with Sorin Toma and Mihail Roller, was among the prominent party ideologues of the group that was co-ordinated by Leonte Răutu after the late 1940s and into the 1950s.

==Ambassador to the United States==
A loyal Soviet agent, Brucan was ambassador of Romania to the United States in 1955. He used the experience as the basis of a book that he co-authored with Sidorovici (a virulent attack on American institutions). He was the Permanent Representative of Romania to the United Nations between 1959 and 1962 as well as the head of Televiziunea Română.

==Conflict with Ceaușescu==
According to his declarations after the fall of Ceaușescu, Brucan became an opponent of the new leadership around Ceaușescu progressively from the 1960s. Initially, upon news that Ceaușescu had been appointed general secretary, he reportedly considered renouncing his political career to focus on an office at the university, but he was persuaded by Emil Bodnăraș to remain an activist. He was a professor of Scientific Socialism at the Bucharest Faculty of Medicine. According to Brucan himself, he faced a period of financial insecurity and began work as a translator to cover his expenses. He also sent several works, subject to censorship at home, to be published in the United States. They showed his move towards reformism that he advocated to be applied inside the Eastern Bloc.

In 1987, after sending an anti-Ceaușescu declaration to the foreign press (to the BBC, the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, and United Press International), a relatively mild criticism for the violent repression of the Braşov Rebellion, he was sentenced to house arrest. At the time, Brucan had won the approval of Soviet authorities, which had already engaged in &quot;Perestroika&quot; policies and had been extended informal protection by the Soviet embassy in Bucharest, allowing him a relevant degree of freedom.

With the help from , the chief of the Securitate, he was issued a passport, and in 1988, despite being expelled from the party, he spent six months in the United States, where he was in contact with the United States Department of State, headed by George P. Shultz. Brucan also claimed to have been invited to Moscow by Soviet politicians Mikhail Gorbachev and Anatoly Dobrynin, who endorsed criticism of Ceaușescu and a Romanian version of &quot;Glasnost&quot;. Based on the personal testimonies of Gorbachev&#x27;s adviser, scholar Vladimir Tismăneanu has disputed all of Brucan&#x27;s account.

The fact that Ceaușescu allowed Brucan freedom of movement shows that Ceaușescu was not subjecting him to the same restrictions as to common dissidents, especially because of the interest about the safety of Brucan by both the Soviet Union (by making sure that the &quot;Pravda&quot; correspondent in Bucharest would keep close contact with him) and the governments of Great Britain and the United States by inviting him as a special guest in their countries.

==&quot;Letter of the Six&quot;==

In March 1989, together with five other Communist dignitaries (Gheorghe Apostol, Alexandru Bârlădeanu, Grigore Răceanu, Corneliu Mănescu and Constantin Pîrvulescu), he signed the open letter known as &quot;Scrisoarea celor șase&quot;(&quot;The Letter of the Six&quot;).

The document, which was immediately broadcast on Radio Free Europe and Voice of America, was a left-wing critique of Ceauşescu&#x27;s policies, and it led to the swift arrest and interrogation of the signatories by the Securitate and then to their exile and house arrest at various locations. The Securitate depicted Brucan as one of several &quot;hostile, inveterate elements&quot; and &quot;the agent of foreign imperialist secret services&quot;. Although lacking in actual popular support, the letter was argued to be among the most important and influential acts of opposition and a notorious break with the traditions of strict obedience and party discipline.

Brucan was sent to a location on the outskirts of Bucharest, in Dămăroaia, the reason for his subsequent colloquial moniker, &quot;The Oracle of Dămăroaia&quot;. Despite increased pressure, most of the contributors to the protest refused to withdraw their statement. Brucan later accused Apostol of having given in to pressures.

==During and after the Revolution==
Brucan was part of the National Salvation Front (FSN) during the Romanian Revolution, joining its Provisional Council and its executive committee. As a member of the council, he was also involved in selecting Roman for the office of Premier.

He was a member of the council (together with Ion Iliescu, Petre Roman and some generals, including Nicolae Militaru) who decided to put the Ceaușescu couple on trial at the site in which they were being held in Târgoviște. That was due to the fear that Securitate snipers might attack the barracks and free them. According to the testimony of Petre Roman, Brucan was among those who insisted for Nicolae and Elena Ceauşescu to be executed immediately after the trial, a claim that was denied by Brucan.

When it was decided that the 10-point programme be read on national television on 22 December, according to Dumitru Mazilu, Brucan wanted it to include a clause that Romania would honour its obligations under the Soviet-controlled Warsaw Pact.

In early January, Brucan made an assurance that the FSN had no intention of turning into a political party but would support some candidates. However, only three weeks later, he supported the transformation of the FSN into a political party, arguing that otherwise, there would be a &quot;political vacuum&quot; that the new political parties would be unable to fill.

After public allegations, Brucan resigned from the FSN in February 1990, claiming that he had accomplished his mission to restore stability in Romania and to put the country on a course toward multi-party elections. His prediction that the FSN would win the elections by more than 90%, supported the already-wide suspicions of falsified ballots.

Early that year, he had been the host of investor George Soros at the Group for Social Dialogue, a Romanian NGO that had been formed around the intellectual élite of the previous regime.

He did not wish to run in the 1990 elections but to be &quot;just the adviser&quot; of now-President Iliescu. Nevertheless, he later issued a vocal criticism of President Iliescu.

In 1990, Brucan contended that Romanians would need 20 years to become accustomed to democracy. That claim became well known in Romania.

On the eve of the day of the first free post-communist elections (20 May 1990), Brucan argued that the 1989 Revolution was not anticommunist but only against Ceauşescu, not the communism of the 1950s and 1960s. He said that Iliescu made a &quot;monumental&quot; mistake in &quot;conceding to the crowd&quot; and banning the Romanian Communist Party.

As a supporter and activist of Soviet autopoiesis, Brucan also had important contributions to transatlantic geopolitics and the emergence of Eurasianism as a geopolitical concept.

==Later life==
From the late 1990s, Brucan hosted a news commentary program on the ProTV network (&quot;Profeții despre trecut&quot; - &quot;Foretellings on the Past&quot;), initially together with Lucian Mândruță. During his final years, he was also a columnist for &quot;Ziarul Financiar&quot;.

In 1998, he was brought to court by Vasile Lupu, a leader of the Christian-Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚCD) and a deputy for Iași County. Speaking on his show, Brucan had called Lupu &quot;astute to the square&quot; and &quot;trained Securitate informant&quot; and indicated that &quot;any good-faithed National Peasantist who still views himself as a party colleague with Vasile Lupu is self-excluding himself from the PNȚCD&quot;. In 2002, courts decided in Lupu&#x27;s favour, and Brucan was found guilty of calumny. Brucan was required to pay Lupu the sum of 30 million lei as compensation.

At the age of 90, Brucan underwent a seven-hour stomach operation on 4 September 2006. Despite an initial good recovery from surgery, his condition suddenly worsened on 13 September, and he died the following day of cardiac arrest. Following his wishes, he was cremated at the Vitan-Bârzești Crematorium.

==Legacy==
Writing in 2006, Vladimir Tismăneanu criticized Brucan, arguing that, despite his renunciation of Communism, Brucan had continued to support authoritarianism in public life and to display a taste for intrigue, and that he had attempted to transform the FSN into a &quot;big party&quot;, virtually replacing the PCR. (The claim that FSN was leftist is dubious at best.)Tismăneanu pointed out Brucan&#x27;s post-1990 opposition to Mircea Răceanu, who had been imprisoned for espionage under Ceauşescu, and who was later rehabilitated by Romanian courts. He has also contended that memoirs authored by Brucan showed little remorse, if not at all, for his early involvement in support of political repression.

According to Victor Neumann, Brucan&#x27;s role in the Bucharest episode of the 1989 Revolution had apparently helped indirectly the original and virtually unrelated revolt in Timișoara, especially by preventing a more violent repression against it, but it was never explained. He also argued that Brucan&#x27;s group of former inner-Party dissidents was, in the eyes of the uninformed public at large, the only &quot;credible alternative&quot; at the time, and cited Brucan&#x27;s own statement: &quot;The train had arrived in the station and we were the only ones who could get on it. What were we to say, that we will not get on? We did it&quot;. Overall, Neumann contended, Silviu Brucan&#x27;s political and diplomatic expertise, as well as his adaptability, had made this old Stalinist the &quot;ideologist of political transformations in 1989 Romania&quot;, and had contributed to the supremacy of left-wing discourse in the years following the Revolution (in regard to the latter point, he cited Brucan arguments, which challenged the existence of the right-wing themes in the ideological makeup of the 1989 movement).

<text>Commander Carlyon Wilfroy Bellairs (15 March 1871 – 22 August 1955) was a British Royal Navy officer and politician.

Bellairs was born at Gibraltar, the son of Lieutenant-General Sir William Bellairs, KCMG, and Blanche St. John Bellairs.

He was a Lieutenant of the Royal Navy, and was placed on the retired list 15 March 1902.

In the 1906 general election he was elected to Parliament for King&#x27;s Lynn as a Liberal, but in October 1909 crossed the floor to sit as a Liberal Unionist.
In the January 1910 general election he unsuccessfully stood for election at West Salford and in December 1910 was also defeated at Walthamstow.

In 1911 Bellairs was married to Charlotte, daughter of Colonel H. L. Pierson of Long Island, USA.
From 1913 he was a member of the London County Council as Municipal Reform Party member for Lewisham, resigning on 17 April 1915.

He returned to Parliament as Conservative member for Maidstone at a by-election in February 1915, and was re-elected for the Maidstone division of Kent in 1918.
He retired from Parliament at the 1931 general election, having declined a baronetcy in 1927.

Charlotte Bellairs died in 1939. Carlyon Bellairs lived at 10 Eaton Place, London and Gore Court, Maidstone, Kent, and was a member of the Carlton Club and the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb. He died in Barbados in 1955 aged 84.

Carlyon Bellairs bequeathed his Barbados home, called Seabourne, as a research institute dedicated to the study of marine biology. McGill University in Montreal, Canada, founded Bellairs Research Institute in 1954 on the property. The institute has been expanded since, but the original house can still be seen close to shore and is often used as accommodation for visiting academics.

<text>Fonte do Bastardo is a parish in the municipality of Praia da Vitória on the island of Terceira in the Portuguese Azores. The population in 2011 was 1,278, in an area of . It contains the localities Canada dos Picos, Fonte do Bastardo, Lajedo, Nogueira, Recanto, Regêlo, Ribeira Seca de Baixo, Ribeira Seca de Cima and São José.

History

Fonte do Bastardo, located on the southern slopes of Serra do Cume on Terceira Island in the Azores, was established in the early 16th century. The village grew around freshwater springs in Ribeira dos Lagos, which became a vital resource for early settlers and a site of pilgrimage for people from nearby towns. By the mid-16th century, the village housed about seventy families.

The community&#x27;s first church, dedicated to Santa Bárbara, was built on a promontory near Pico da Bagacina but was largely destroyed by an earthquake, leaving only its chapel and cemetery. Masses were temporarily held at the Chapel of São José until it too was destroyed by a quake in 1801. For over a century, villagers used the ruins of the original church for religious services until a new church was completed in 1904 with the support of a wealthy expatriate, Francisco Soares de Oliveira.

Fonte do Bastardo is known for its innovative spirit, introducing the island&#x27;s first windmill, public bus service, bullfighting arena, and a cooperative established in 1975. The village also achieved recognition through its championship volleyball team.

The origin of the name &quot;Fonte do Bastardo&quot; remains a mystery. Theories suggest it may refer to an illegitimate child of a prominent settler or noble, a figure exiled to the island, or perhaps a legendary or heroic individual associated with the area&#x27;s development. This unresolved history adds an air of mystique to the village, intertwining factual accounts with local lore.

<text>John &quot;Liver-Eating&quot; Johnson, born John Jeremiah Garrison Johnston (July 1, 1824 – January 21, 1900), was a mountain man of the American Old West.

==Biography==
Johnson is said to have been born with the last name Garrison, in the area of the Hickory Tavern near Pattenburg, New Jersey. During the Mexican–American War he served aboard a fighting ship. After striking an officer, he deserted, changed his name to John Johnston, and traveled west to try his hand at gold digging in Alder Gulch, Montana Territory. He also became a &quot;woodhawk&quot;, supplying cord wood to steamboats.

Rumors and legends about Johnson are common. Perhaps chief among them is that in 1847, his wife, a member of the Flathead American Indian tribe, was killed by a young Crow man and his fellow hunters, which prompted Johnson to embark on a vendetta against the tribe. According to historian Andrew Mehane Southerland, &quot;He supposedly killed and scalped more than 300 Crow Indians and then devoured their livers&quot; to avenge the death of his wife, and &quot;as his reputation and collection of scalps grew, Johnson became an object of fear.&quot;

Accounts say that he would cut out and eat the liver of each Crow killed. This led to his being known as &quot;Liver-Eating Johnson&quot;. One tale ascribed to Johnson (while other sources ascribe it to Boone Helm) is that while on a foray of over in the winter to sell whiskey to his Flathead kin, he was ambushed by a group of Blackfoot warriors. The Blackfoot planned to sell him to the Crow, his mortal enemies. He was stripped to the waist, tied with leather thongs and put in a teepee with one guard. Johnson managed to break through the straps. He then knocked out the guard with a kick, took his knife and scalped him. He escaped into the woods and fled to the cabin of Del Gue, his trapping partner, a journey of about .

Eventually, Johnson made peace with the Crow, who became &quot;his brothers&quot;, and his personal vendetta against them finally ended after 25 years and scores of slain Crow warriors. However, the West was still very violent and territorial, particularly during the Plains Indian Wars of the mid-19th century. Many more Indians of different tribes, especially but not limited to the Sioux and the Blackfoot, would know the wrath of &quot;Dapiek Absaroka&quot; Crow killer and his fellow mountain men.

Johnson joined Company H, 2nd Colorado Cavalry, of the Union Army in St. Louis in 1864 as a private and was honorably discharged the following year. During the 1880s, he was appointed deputy sheriff in Coulson, Montana, and a town marshal in Red Lodge, Montana. In his time, he was a sailor, scout, soldier, gold seeker, hunter, trapper, woodhawk, whiskey peddler, guide, deputy, constable, and log cabin builder, taking advantage of any source of income-producing labor he could find. His final residence was in a veterans’ home in Santa Monica, California, where he died on January 21, 1900. His body was buried in a Los Angeles veterans&#x27; cemetery. However, in 1974, after a six-month campaign by 25 seventh-grade students and their teacher, who did not believe he should be laid to rest among urban sprawl, Johnson&#x27;s remains were relocated to Cody, Wyoming. His epitaph reads &quot;No More Trails&quot;.

&quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot; is a 1972 film by Sydney Pollack starring Robert Redford depicting his life.

<doc id="1344161" wikidata="Q958639" url="?curid=1344161" title="Glencolmcille">
<text>Glencolmcille or Glencolumbkille () is a small district on the Atlantic coast of southwest County Donegal in Ireland. Named after Saint Colm Cille (Columba), it is also a civil parish in the historic barony of Banagh. Glencolmcille is in the &quot;Gaeltacht&quot;, and while it remains an Irish-speaking community, English has been steadily replacing Irish as the main language, with only 34% of residents speaking Irish on a daily basis in 2002. The village of Cashel is the main settlement in the district.

==History==
The earliest recorded names for the district were &quot;Glend&quot; (meaning simply &#x27;Glen&#x27; or &#x27;Valley&#x27;) and &quot;Senglenn&quot; (meaning &#x27;Old Glen&#x27; or &#x27;Old Valley&#x27;). The district later became known as &quot;Gleann Cholm Cille&quot;, probably in the fifteenth-century. This later, and current, name means &#x27;Valley of Colm Cille&#x27;. The district&#x27;s current name was first fully recorded only in 1532, when it was written in Maghnas Ó Domhnaill&#x27;s &quot;Betha Colaim Chille&quot; (&quot;Life of Colm Cille&quot;) as being: &quot;ag tSenglenda a crich Ceneoil Conill ris a raiter Glend Colaim Cilli aniug&quot; (&#x27;at the river of &quot;Seanghleann&quot; [Old Glen] in the territory of the &quot;Cenél Conaill&quot;, which is called &quot;Gleann Cholm Cille&quot; today&#x27;). Saint Colm Cille, or Columba, is one of Ireland&#x27;s three patron saints (along with Saint Patrick and Saint Brigid). He and his followers supposedly lived in the valley for a time and the ruins of several of their churches can still be seen there.

The district was once famous as being the parish of The V. Rev. James Canon McDyer (1910–1987), who championed the rights of rural people and helped establish community-based industries in the area. 
A parish council (&quot;Comhairle Paróiste Ghleann Cholm Cille&quot;) has been functioning in Glencolmcille since the 1930s, to look after the interests and needs of the residents. Members are elected to this body every four years by the residents of the Glencolmcille church area.

===Historic sites===
Four sites make up National Monument #139:

* Glencolumbkille Cashel () — A penitential station, also called Glencolumbkille Turas (Irish for &quot;journey&quot;). Every 9 June the local people go through 15 &quot;stations.&quot; It begins at a court cairn, constructed 3000 BC. The pilgrim circles the cairn three times sunwise, while praying, places his/her back to the stone, then renounces the World, the Flesh, and the Devil.
* Glencolumbkille Church () — A holy well is located in Beefan townland.
* Malin Beg () — Church of St Kevin and ringfort.
* Malin More () — A portal tomb dated to c. 2000 BC.

==Culture==
Glencolmcille was home to the Dublin-born artist Kenneth King, whose works depict naval and merchant shipping, coastline and lighthouses.

British composer Sir Arnold Bax made many extended visits there between 1904 and the early 1930s. Apparently, Bax composed much of his music and wrote many of his poems and stories while staying there. He describes the district and its villages, and the life of its inhabitants, in his autobiography &quot;Farewell My Youth&quot;:
There are a number of natural sites nearby, such as the Slieve League (&quot;Sliabh Liag&quot;) cliffs, The Silver Strand (&quot;An Tráigh Bhán&quot;) at Malin Beg (&quot;Málainn Bhig&quot;), and Glen Head (&quot;Cionn Ghlinne&quot;) itself.

At the centre of one of the largest &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; areas, the district is known as the home of Oideas Gael, an Irish-language learning institute established in 1984 to promote the Irish language and culture. The district also has a petrol station, grocer, post office, folk village, woollen mill, hill walking and accommodation centre, restaurant, &quot;village cafe&quot; and two pubs (often with Irish fiddle music).

Films shot on location in Glencolmcille include &quot;The Railway Station Man&quot;, 1992, starring Julie Christie, Donald Sutherland and John Lynch.

<doc id="1344164" wikidata="Q747385" url="?curid=1344164" title="Data-flow diagram">
<text>A data-flow diagram is a way of representing a flow of data through a process or a system (usually an information system). The DFD also provides information about the outputs and inputs of each entity and the process itself. A data-flow diagram has no control are no decision rules and no loops. Specific operations based on the data can be represented by a flowchart.

There are several notations for displaying data-flow diagrams. The notation presented above was described in 1979 by Tom DeMarco as part of structured analysis.

For each data flow, at least one of the endpoints (source and / or destination) must exist in a process. The refined representation of a process can be done in another data-flow diagram, which subdivides this process into sub-processes.

The data-flow diagram is a tool that is part of structured analysis and data modeling. When using UML, the activity diagram typically takes over the role of the data-flow diagram. A special form of data-flow plan is a site-oriented data-flow plan.

Data-flow diagrams can be regarded as inverted Petri nets, because places in such networks correspond to the semantics of data memories. Analogously, the semantics of transitions from Petri nets and data flows and functions from data-flow diagrams should be considered equivalent.

==History==
The DFD notation draws on graph theory, originally used in operational research to model workflow in organizations, and in computer science to model the flow of inputs and outputs across computations. DFD originated from the structured analysis and design technique methodology in the middle of the 1970s. It was first proposed by Larry Constantine, and popularized by Edward Yourdon, Tom DeMarco, Chris Gane and Trish Sarson, who enriched the diagramming technique with different notations, data dictionary practices and guidance for the hierarchical decomposition of processes. 

The primary aim of data-flow diagrams in the context of structured design was to build complex modular systems, rationalizing the interdependencies across different modules. Data-flow diagrams (DFD) quickly became a popular way to visualize the major steps and data involved in software-system processes. DFDs were usually used to show data flow in a computer system, although they could in theory as well be applied to business process modeling. DFDs were useful to document the major data flows or to explore a new high-level design in terms of data flow.

== DFD components ==

DFD consists of processes, flows, warehouses, and terminators. There are several ways to view these DFD components.

Process

The process (function, transformation) is part of a system that transforms inputs to outputs. The symbol of a process is a circle, an oval, a rectangle or a rectangle with rounded corners (according to the type of notation). The process is named in one word, a short sentence, or a phrase that is clearly to express its essence.

Data flow

Data flow (flow, dataflow) shows the transfer of information (sometimes also material) from one part of the system to another. The symbol of the flow is the arrow. The flow should have a name that determines what information (or what material) is being moved. Exceptions are flows where it is clear what information is transferred through the entities that are linked to these flows. Material shifts are modeled in systems that are not merely informative. Flow should only transmit one type of information (material). The arrow shows the flow direction (it can also be bi-directional if the information to/from the entity is logically dependent—e.g. question and answer). Flows link processes, warehouses and terminators.

Warehouse

The warehouse (datastore, data store, file, database) is used to store data for later use. The symbol of the store is two horizontal lines, the other way of view is shown in the DFD Notation. The name of the warehouse is a plural noun (e.g. orders)—it derives from the input and output streams of the warehouse. The warehouse does not have to be just a data file but can also be, for example, a folder with documents, a filing cabinet, or a set of optical discs. Therefore, viewing the warehouse in a DFD is independent of implementation. The flow from the warehouse usually represents reading of the data stored in the warehouse, and the flow to the warehouse usually expresses data entry or updating (sometimes also deleting data). The warehouse is represented by two parallel lines between which the memory name is located (it can be modeled as a UML buffer node).

Terminator

The terminator is an external entity that communicates with the system and stands outside of the system. It can be, for example, various organizations (e.g. a bank), groups of people (e.g. customers), authorities (e.g. a tax office) or a department (e.g. a human-resources department) of the same organization, which does not belong to the model system. The terminator may be another system with which the modeled system communicates.

== Rules for creating DFD ==
Entity names should be comprehensible without further comments. DFD is a system created by analysts based on interviews with system users. It is determined for system developers, on one hand, project contractor on the other, so the entity names should be adapted for model domain or amateur users or professionals. Entity names should be general (independent, e.g. specific individuals carrying out the activity), but should clearly specify the entity. Processes should be numbered for easier mapping and referral to specific processes. The numbering is random, however, it is necessary to maintain consistency across all DFD levels (see DFD Hierarchy). DFD should be clear, as the maximum number of processes in one DFD is recommended to be from 6 to 9, minimum is 3 processes in one DFD. The exception is the so-called contextual diagram where the only process symbolizes the model system and all terminators with which the system communicates.

== DFD consistency ==
DFD must be consistent with other models of the system—entity relationship diagram, state-transition diagram, data dictionary, and process specification models. Each process must have its name, inputs and outputs. Each flow should have its name (exception see Flow). Each Data store must have input and output flow. Input and output flows do not have to be displayed in one DFD—but they must exist in another DFD describing the same system. An exception is warehouse standing outside the system (external storage) with which the system communicates.

== DFD hierarchy ==
To make the DFD more transparent (i.e. not too many processes), multi-level DFDs can be created. DFDs that are at a higher level are less detailed (aggregate more detailed DFD at lower levels). The contextual DFD is the highest in the hierarchy (see DFD Creation Rules). The so-called zero level is followed by DFD 0, starting with process numbering (e.g. process 1, process 2). In the next, the so-called first level—DFD 1—the numbering continues For example, process 1 is divided into the first three levels of the DFD, which are numbered 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. Similarly, processes in the second level (DFD 2) are numbered 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3, and 2.1.4. The number of levels depends on the size of the model system. DFD 0 processes may not have the same number of decomposition levels. DFD 0 contains the most important (aggregated) system functions. The lowest level should include processes that make it possible to create a process specification for roughly one A4 page. If the mini-specification should be longer, it is appropriate to create an additional level for the process where it will be decomposed into multiple processes. For a clear overview of the entire DFD hierarchy, a vertical (cross-sectional) diagram can be created. The warehouse is displayed at the highest level where it is first used and at every lower level as well.

<doc id="1344171" wikidata="Q2344119" url="?curid=1344171" title="French phonology">
<text>French phonology is the sound system of French. This article discusses mainly the phonology of all the varieties of Standard French. Notable phonological features include the uvular r present in some accents, nasal vowels, and three processes affecting word-final sounds:

* liaison, a specific instance of sandhi in which word-final consonants are not pronounced unless they are followed by a word beginning with a vowel;
* elision, in which certain instances of (schwa) are elided (such as when final before an initial vowel);
* (resyllabification) in which word-final and word-initial consonants may be moved across a syllable boundary, with syllables crossing word boundaries:

An example of the above is this:
*Written: &quot;&quot;
*Meaning: &quot;We left the window open.&quot;
*In isolation: 
*Together: 

==Consonants==

Phonetic notes:
* are laminal denti-alveolar , while are dentalised laminal alveolar (commonly called &#x27;dental&#x27;), pronounced with the blade of the tongue very close to the back of the upper front teeth, with the tip resting behind lower front teeth.
* Word-final consonants are always released. Generally, are voiced throughout and are unaspirated.
* is usually apical alveolar but sometimes laminal denti-alveolar . Before , it can be realised as retroflex .
* In current pronunciation, is merging with .
* The velar nasal is not a native phoneme of French, but it occurs in loan words such as , or . Some speakers who have difficulty with this consonant realise it as a sequence or replace it with . It could be considered a separate phoneme in Meridional French, e.g. pain (&#x27;bread&#x27;) vs. penne (&#x27;quill&#x27;).
* The approximants correspond to the close vowels . While there are a few minimal pairs (such as &#x27;s/he rented&#x27; and &#x27;law&#x27;), there are many cases where there is free variation.
*Belgian French may merge with or .
* Some dialects of French have a palatal lateral (French: &quot;l mouillé&quot;, &#x27;wet l&#x27;), but in the modern standard variety, it has merged with . See also Glides and diphthongs, below.
* The French rhotic has a wide range of realizations: the voiced uvular fricative , also realised as an approximant , with a voiceless positional allophone , the uvular trill , the alveolar trill , and the alveolar tap . These are all recognised as the phoneme , but and are considered dialectal. The most common pronunciation is as a default realisation, complemented by a devoiced variant in the positions before or after a voiceless obstruent or at the end of a sentence. See French guttural r and map at right.
* Velars and may become palatalised to and before , and more variably before . Word-final may also be palatalised to . Velar palatalisation has traditionally been associated with the working class, though recent studies suggest it is spreading to more demographics of large French cities.

===Geminates===
Although double consonant letters appear in the orthographic form of many French words, geminate consonants are relatively rare in the pronunciation of such words. The following cases can be identified.

The geminate pronunciation is found in the future and conditional forms of the verbs (&#x27;to run&#x27;) and (&#x27;to die&#x27;). The conditional form &quot;il mourrait&quot; (&#x27;he would die&#x27;), for example, contrasts with the imperfect form &quot;il mourait&quot; (&#x27;he was dying&#x27;). Most modern speakers have reduced to in other words, such as &quot;il pourrait&quot; (&#x27;he could&#x27;). Other verbs that have a double orthographically in the future and conditional are pronounced with a simple : &quot;il pourra&quot; (&#x27;he will be able to&#x27;), &quot;il verra&quot; (&#x27;he will see&#x27;).

When the prefix combines with a base that begins with &quot;n&quot;, the resulting word is sometimes pronounced with a geminate and similarly for the variants of the same prefix &quot;im-&quot;, &quot;il-&quot;, &quot;ir-&quot;: 
* (&#x27;innate&#x27;)
* (&#x27;immortal&#x27;)
* (&#x27;illegible&#x27;)
* (&#x27;irresponsible&#x27;)

Other cases of optional gemination can be found in words like (&#x27;syllable&#x27;), (&#x27;grammar&#x27;), and (&#x27;illusion&#x27;). The pronunciation of such words, in many cases, a spelling pronunciation varies by speaker and gives rise to widely varying stylistic effects. In particular, the gemination of consonants other than the liquids and nasals is &quot;generally considered affected or pedantic&quot;. Examples of stylistically marked pronunciations include (&#x27;addition&#x27;) and (&#x27;intelligence&#x27;).

Gemination of doubled and is typical of the Languedoc region, as opposed to other southern accents.

A few cases of gemination do not correspond to double consonant letters in the orthography. The deletion of word-internal schwas (see below), for example, can give rise to sequences of identical consonants: &quot;là-dedans&quot; (&#x27;inside&#x27;), &quot;l&#x27;honnêteté&quot; (&#x27;honesty&#x27;). The elided form of the object pronoun &quot;l&#x27;&quot; (&#x27;him/her/it&#x27;) is also realised as a geminate when it appears after another &quot;l&quot; to avoid misunderstanding:
*&quot;Il l&#x27;a mangé&quot; (&#x27;He ate it&#x27;)
*&quot;Il a mangé&quot; (&#x27;He ate&#x27;)
Gemination is obligatory in such contexts.

Finally, a word pronounced with emphatic stress can exhibit gemination of its first syllable-initial consonant:
*&quot;formidable&quot; (&#x27;terrific&#x27;)
*&quot;épouvantable&quot; (&#x27;horrible&#x27;)

===Liaison===
Many words in French can be analyzed as having a &quot;latent&quot; final consonant that is pronounced only in certain syntactic contexts when the next word begins with a vowel. For example, the word (&#x27;two&#x27;) is pronounced in isolation or before a consonant-initial word (&quot;deux jours&quot; → &#x27;two days&#x27;), but in &quot;deux ans&quot; (→ &#x27;two years&#x27;), the linking or liaison consonant is pronounced.

==Vowels==

Standard French contrasts up to 13 oral vowels and up to 4 nasal vowels. The schwa (in the center of the diagram next to this paragraph) is not necessarily a distinctive sound. Even though it often merges with one of the mid front rounded vowels, its patterning suggests that it is a separate phoneme (see the subsection Schwa below).

The table below primarily lists vowels in contemporary Parisian French, with vowels only present in other dialects in parentheses.

While some dialects feature a long distinct from and a distinction between an open front and an open back , Parisian French features only and just one open vowel realised as central . Some dialects also feature a rounded , which has merged with in Paris.

In Metropolitan French, while is phonologically distinct, its phonetic quality tends to coincide with either or .

===Close vowels===
In contrast with the mid vowels, there is no tense–lax contrast in close vowels. However, non-phonemic lax (near-close) appear in Quebec as allophones of when the vowel is both phonetically short (so not before ) and in a closed syllable, so that e.g. &quot;petite&quot; &#x27;small ()&#x27; differs from &quot;petit&quot; &#x27;small ()&#x27; not only in the presence of the final but also in the tenseness of the . Laxing always occurs in stressed closed syllables, but it is also found in other environments to various degrees.

In Metropolitan French, are consistently close , but the exact height of is somewhat debatable as it has been variously described as close and near-close .

===Mid vowels===
Although the mid vowels contrast in certain environments, there is a limited distributional overlap so they often appear in complementary distribution. Generally, close-mid vowels () are found in open syllables, and open-mid vowels () are found in closed syllables. However, there are minimal pairs:
* open-mid and close-mid contrast in final-position open syllables:
*: (&#x27;was going&#x27;), vs. (&#x27;gone&#x27;);
* likewise, open-mid and contrast with close-mid and mostly in closed monosyllables, such as these:
*: (&#x27;young&#x27;), vs. (&#x27;fast&#x27;, verb),
*: (&#x27;rock&#x27;), vs. (&#x27;hoarse&#x27;),
*: (&#x27;Rhodes&#x27;), vs. (&#x27;[I] lurk&#x27;),
*: (&#x27;apple&#x27;), vs. (&#x27;palm&#x27;),
*: (&#x27;good&#x27;, feminine), vs. (&#x27;Beaune&#x27;, the city).

Beyond the general rule, known as the &quot;loi de position&quot; among French phonologists, there are some exceptions. For instance, and are found in closed syllables ending in , and only is found in closed monosyllables before , , and .

The Parisian realization of has been variously described as central and centralized to before , in both cases becoming similar to .

The phonemic opposition of and has been lost in the southern half of France, where these two sounds are found only in complementary distribution. The phonemic oppositions of and and of and in terminal open syllables have been lost in almost all of France, but not in Belgium or in areas with an Arpitan substrate, where and are still opposed as and .

===Open vowels===
The phonemic contrast between front and back is sometimes no longer maintained in Parisian French, which leads some researchers to reject the idea of two distinct phonemes. However, the back is always maintained in Northern French, but only in final open syllables, (lawyer) , but in final closed syllables, the phoneme is fronted to , but it is always long, (pasta) . The distinction is still clearly maintained in many dialects such as Quebec French.

While there is much variation among speakers in France, a number of general tendencies can be observed. First of all, the distinction is most often preserved in word-final stressed syllables such as in these minimal pairs:
: → (&#x27;stain&#x27;), vs. → (&#x27;task&#x27;)
: → (&#x27;leg&#x27;), vs. → (&#x27;paste, pastry&#x27;)
: → (&#x27;rat&#x27;), vs. → (&#x27;short&#x27;)

There are certain environments that prefer one open vowel over the other. For example, is preferred after and before :
: (&#x27;three&#x27;),
: (&#x27;gas&#x27;).

The difference in quality is often reinforced by a difference in length (but the difference is contrastive in final closed syllables). The exact distribution of the two vowels varies greatly from speaker to speaker.

Back is much rarer in unstressed syllables, but it can be encountered in some common words:
: (&#x27;castle&#x27;),
: (&#x27;past&#x27;).

Morphologically complex words derived from words containing stressed do not retain it:
: → (&#x27;aged&#x27;, from → )
: &quot;rarissime&quot; → (&#x27;very rare&#x27;, from → ).

Even in the final syllable of a word, back may become if the word in question loses its stress within the extended phonological context:
: &quot;J&#x27;ai été au bois&quot; → (&#x27;I went to the woods&#x27;),
: &quot;J&#x27;ai été au bois de Vincennes&quot; → (&#x27;I went to the Vincennes woods&#x27;).

===Nasal vowels===
The phonetic qualities of the back nasal vowels differ from those of the corresponding oral vowels. The contrasting factor that distinguishes and is the extra lip rounding of the latter according to some linguists, and tongue height according to others. Speakers who produce both and distinguish them mainly through increased lip rounding of the former, but many speakers use only the latter phoneme, especially most speakers in northern France such as Paris (but not farther north, in Belgium).

In some dialects, particularly that of Europe, there is an attested tendency for nasal vowels to shift in a counterclockwise direction: tends to be more open and shifts toward the vowel space of (realised also as ), rises and rounds to (realised also as ) and shifts to or . Also, in some regions, there also is an opposite movement for for which it becomes more open like , resulting in a merger of Standard French and in this case. According to one source, the typical phonetic realization of the nasal vowels in Paris is for , for and for .

In Quebec French, two of the vowels shift in a different direction: → , more or less as in Europe, but → and → .

In the Provence and Occitanie regions, nasal vowels are often realized as oral vowels before a stop consonant, thus reviving the otherwise lost in other accents: quarante → .

Contrary to the oral , there is no attested tendency for the nasal to become central in any accent.

===Schwa===
When phonetically realised, schwa (), also called &quot;e &quot; (&#x27;dropped e&#x27;) and &quot;e &quot; (&#x27;mute e&#x27;), is a mid-central vowel with some rounding. Many authors consider its value to be , while Geoff Lindsey suggests . state, more specifically, that it merges with before high vowels and glides:
: → (&#x27;clarity&#x27;),
: → (&#x27;workshop&#x27;),
in phrase-final stressed position:
: &quot;dis-le !&quot; → (&#x27;say it&#x27;),
and that it merges with elsewhere. However, some speakers make a clear distinction, and it exhibits special phonological behavior that warrants considering it a distinct phoneme. Furthermore, the merger occurs mainly in the French of France; in Quebec, and are still distinguished.

The main characteristic of French schwa is its &quot;instability&quot;: the fact that under certain conditions it has no phonetic realization.
* That is usually the case when it follows a single consonant in a medial syllable:
*: → (&#x27;to call&#x27;),
* It is occasionally mute in word-final position:
*: → (&#x27;door&#x27;).
* Word-final schwas are optionally pronounced if preceded by two or more consonants and followed by a consonant-initial word:
*: &quot;une porte fermée&quot; → (&#x27;a closed door&#x27;).
* In the future and conditional forms of &quot;-er&quot; verbs, however, the schwa is sometimes deleted even after two consonants:
*: &quot;tu garderais&quot; → (&#x27;you would guard&#x27;),
*: &quot;nous brusquerons [les choses]&quot; → (&#x27;we will precipitate [things]&#x27;).
* On the other hand, it is pronounced word-internally when it follows more pronounced consonants that cannot be combined into a complex onset with the initial consonants of the next syllable:
*: → (&#x27;scoundrel&#x27;),
*: &quot;sept petits&quot; → (&#x27;seven little ones&#x27;).

In French versification, word-final schwa is always elided before another vowel and at the ends of verses. It is pronounced before a following consonant-initial word. For example, &quot;une grande femme fut ici, &quot; in ordinary speech, would in verse be pronounced , with the enunciated at the end of each word.

Schwa cannot normally be realised as a front vowel () in closed syllables. In such contexts in inflectional and derivational morphology, schwa usually alternates with the front vowel :
: → (&#x27;to harass&#x27;), with
: &quot;il harcèle&quot; → (&#x27;[he] harasses&#x27;).

A three-way alternation can be observed, in a few cases, for a number of speakers:
: → (&#x27;to call&#x27;),
: &quot;j&#x27;appelle&quot; → (&#x27;I call&#x27;),
: → (&#x27;brand&#x27;), which can also be pronounced .

Instances of orthographic that do not exhibit the behaviour described above may be better analysed as corresponding to the stable, full vowel . The enclitic pronoun , for example, always keeps its vowel in contexts like &quot;donnez-le-moi&quot; → (&#x27;give it to me&#x27;) for which schwa deletion would normally apply (giving *), and it counts as a full syllable for the determination of stress.

Cases of word-internal stable are more subject to variation among speakers, but, for example, &quot;un rebelle&quot; (&#x27;a rebel&#x27;) must be pronounced with a full vowel in contrast to &quot;un rebond&quot; → or (&#x27;a bounce&#x27;).

===Length===
Except for the distinction still made by some speakers between and in rare minimal pairs like (&#x27;to put&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;teacher&#x27;), variation in vowel length is entirely allophonic. Vowels can be lengthened in closed, stressed syllables, under the following two conditions:

*, , , and the nasal vowels are lengthened before any consonant: (&#x27;dough&#x27;), (&#x27;sings&#x27;).
*All vowels are lengthened if followed by one of the voiced fricatives—, , , (not in combination)—or by the cluster : / (&#x27;sea/mother&#x27;), (&#x27;crisis&#x27;), (&#x27;book&#x27;). However, words such as &quot;(ils) servent&quot; (&#x27;(they) serve&#x27;) or (&#x27;pie&#x27;) are pronounced with short vowels since the appears in clusters other than .

When such syllables lose their stress, the lengthening effect may be absent. The vowel of is long in &quot;Regarde comme elle saute !&quot;, in which the word is phrase-final and therefore stressed, but not in &quot;Qu&#x27;est-ce qu&#x27;elle saute bien !&quot; In accents wherein is distinguished from , however, it is still pronounced with a long vowel even in an unstressed position, as in &quot;fête&quot; in &quot;C&#x27;est une fête importante.&quot;

The following table presents the pronunciation of a representative sample of words in phrase-final (stressed) position:

===Devoicing===
In Parisian French, the close vowels and the mid front at the end of utterances can be devoiced. A devoiced vowel may be followed by a sound similar to the voiceless palatal fricative :
: &quot;Merci.&quot; → (&#x27;Thank you.&#x27;),
: &quot;Allez !&quot; → (&#x27;Go!&#x27;).

In Quebec French, close vowels are often devoiced when unstressed and surrounded by voiceless consonants:
: &quot;université&quot; → (&#x27;university&#x27;).
Though a more prominent feature of Quebec French, phrase-medial devoicing is also found in European French.

===Elision===
The final vowel (usually ) of a number of monosyllabic function words is elided in syntactic combinations with a following word that begins with a vowel. For example, compare the pronunciation of the unstressed subject pronoun, in &quot;je dors&quot; (&#x27;I am sleeping&#x27;), and in &quot;j&#x27;arrive&quot; (&#x27;I am arriving&#x27;).

===Glides and diphthongs===
The glides , , and appear in syllable onsets immediately followed by a full vowel. In many cases, they alternate systematically with their vowel counterparts , , and such as in the following pairs of verb forms:
:&quot;nie&quot; ; (&#x27;deny&#x27;)
:&quot;loue&quot; ; (&#x27;rent&#x27;)
:&quot;tue&quot; ; (&#x27;kill&#x27;)
The glides in the examples can be analyzed as the result of a glide formation process that turns an underlying high vowel into a glide when followed by another vowel: → .

This process is usually blocked after a complex onset of the form obstruent + liquid (a stop or a fricative followed by or ). For example, while the pair &quot;loue&quot;/&quot;louer&quot; shows an alternation between and , the same suffix added to &quot;cloue&quot; , a word with a complex onset, does not trigger the glide formation: &quot;clouer&quot; (&#x27;to nail&#x27;). Some sequences of glide + vowel can be found after obstruent-liquid onsets, however. The main examples are , as in &quot;pluie&quot; (&#x27;rain&#x27;), , as in &quot;proie&quot; (&#x27;prey&#x27;), and , as in &quot;groin&quot; (&#x27;snout&#x27;). They can be dealt with in different ways, as by adding appropriate contextual conditions to the glide formation rule or by assuming that the phonemic inventory of French includes underlying glides or rising diphthongs like and .

Glide formation normally does not occur across morpheme boundaries in compounds like &quot;semi-aride&quot; (&#x27;semi-arid&#x27;). However, in colloquial registers, &quot;si elle&quot; (&#x27;if she&#x27;) can be pronounced just like (&#x27;sky&#x27;), or &quot;tu as&quot; (&#x27;you have&#x27;) like &quot;tua&quot; (&#x27;[(s)he] killed&#x27;).

The glide can also occur in syllable coda position, after a vowel, as in (&#x27;sun&#x27;). There again, one can formulate a derivation from an underlying full vowel , but the analysis is not always adequate because of the existence of possible minimal pairs like (&#x27;country&#x27;) / (&#x27;paycheck&#x27;) and (&#x27;abbey&#x27;) / (&#x27;bee&#x27;). Schane (1968) proposes an abstract analysis deriving postvocalic from an underlying lateral by palatalization and glide conversion ( → → ).

==Stress==
Word stress is not distinctive in French, so two words cannot be distinguished based on stress placement alone. Grammatical stress is always on the final full syllable (syllable with a vowel other than schwa) of a word. Monosyllables with schwa as their only vowel (, , , etc.) are generally clitics but otherwise may receive stress.

The difference between stressed and unstressed syllables in French is less marked than in English. Vowels in unstressed syllables keep their full quality, regardless of whether the rhythm of the speaker is syllable-timed or mora-timed (see isochrony). Moreover, words lose their stress to varying degrees when pronounced in phrases and sentences. In general, only the last word in a phonological phrase (&quot;mot phonétique&quot;) retains its full grammatical stress (on its last full syllable).

===Emphatic stress===
Emphatic stress is used to call attention to a specific element in a given context such as to express a contrast or to reinforce the emotive content of a word. In French, this stress falls on the first consonant-initial syllable of the word in question. The characteristics associated with emphatic stress include increased amplitude and pitch of the vowel and gemination of the onset consonant, as mentioned above. Emphatic stress does not replace, but occurs in tandem with, grammatical stress.
*&quot;C&#x27;est parfaitement vrai&quot;. (&#x27;It&#x27;s perfectly true.&#x27;; no emphatic stress)
*&quot;C&#x27;est parfaitement vrai.&quot; (emphatic stress on &quot;parfaitement&quot;)

For words that begin with a vowel, emphatic stress falls on the first syllable that begins with a consonant or on the initial syllable with the insertion of a glottal stop or a liaison consonant.
*&quot;C&#x27;est épouvantable.&quot; (&#x27;It&#x27;s terrible.&#x27;; emphatic stress on second syllable of &quot;épouvantable&quot;)
*&quot;C&#x27;est épouvantable !&quot; (initial syllable with liaison consonant )
*&quot;C&#x27;est épouvantable !&quot; (initial syllable with glottal stop insertion)

==Intonation==

French intonation differs substantially from that of English. There are four primary patterns:

*The continuation pattern is a rise in pitch occurring in the last syllable of a rhythm group (typically a phrase).
*The finality pattern is a sharp fall in pitch occurring in the last syllable of a declarative statement.
*The yes/no intonation is a sharp rise in pitch occurring in the last syllable of a yes/no question.
*The information question intonation is a rapid fall-off from a high pitch on the first word of a non-yes/no question, often followed by a small rise in pitch on the last syllable of the question.

<text>Awards and decorations of the National Guard are presented to members of the National Guard and sometimes to members of the state defense forces in addition to regular United States military decorations. Each of the state governments of the United States maintains a series of military decorations for issuance to members of the National Guard, with such awards presented under the authority of the various state adjutants general.

Active or reserve federal forces veterans who subsequently serve in the National Guard wear all federal awards first, then state awards. Those National Guard soldiers and airmen who subsequently serve in the active or reserve federal forces of the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or United States Air Force (i.e., as active duty or reserve members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard) may not continue to wear and display such decorations on a military uniform, unless such activation is under Title 32 status. Active duty regulations allow federal soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines to accept but not to wear state awards.

Most states authorize the wear of other states&#x27; awards if a soldier or airman has earned awards from a state or territory to which he or she is not presently assigned. The order of precedence is typically the presently assigned state, followed by awards from the District of Columbia, then other states by their order of admission.

The following is a list of National Guard decorations, as issued by each of the fifty United States; Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia.

<doc id="1344186" wikidata="Q7726780" url="?curid=1344186" title="College of St. Scholastica">
<text>The College of St. Scholastica (CSS) is a private Benedictine college in Duluth, Minnesota, United States. It was founded in 1912 by a group of pioneering Benedictine Sisters and enrolled about 3,000 students as of 2023. The college offers a liberal arts education and is located on 186 wooded acres overlooking Lake Superior. Saint Scholastica was a Christian hermit traditionally regarded as the founder of the Benedictine nuns.

==History==

The College of St. Scholastica owes its existence to the combining of two forces: Benedictine missionaries and the settlement of Duluth. In 1892, Mother Scholastica Kerst and 28 sisters arrived from St. Joseph, Minnesota, to spearhead the establishment of a Benedictine motherhouse and an academy, known as the Sacred Heart Institute, in Duluth.

The school and convent were located at Munger Terrace before growth required a move to a new facility at Third Avenue East and Third Street. Named Sacred Heart Institute, the high school continued to grow rapidly. Duluth&#x27;s rapid expansion led to another move in 1909 to its present location.

Mother Scholastica&#x27;s vision for the college can be summed up in this quote attributed to her: &quot;My dream is that someday there will rise upon these grounds fine buildings like the great Benedictine abbeys. They will be built of stone: within their walls higher education will flourish.&quot;

The school expanded its course offerings in 1912 to include a junior college and changed its name to its current moniker, the College of St. Scholastica. The college started with only six students and 52 courses offered in eight departments in its first year. Academic leadership and research were stressed early as an integral part of the college&#x27;s commitment to Benedictine values.

In 1924, the college became a four-year liberal arts institute with an enrollment of 68. The school&#x27;s first baccalaureate degrees were granted in 1926. In 1969, it became a fully coeducational institution.

As a Benedictine institution, the college is affiliated with the Order of Saint Benedict. Its endowment stands at more than $89.9 million.

===Symbols===
The shield of the college shows a lily, blooming with three flowers symbolizing the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity. The base of the lily is enclosed by a crescent, the heraldic symbol of the Virgin Mary, and the purity of Christian teaching. Symbolizing the college, a book occupies the center of the field, bearing the motto of St. Scholastica. It is adapted from the second part of the Book of Proverbs line &quot;Her ways are ways of beauty, and all her paths are peace,&quot; and reads in Latin, &quot;.&quot;

== Campuses ==
In addition to the main campus in Duluth, St. Scholastica has sites in St. Cloud, St. Paul and embedded sites in Brainerd, Austin, Cloquet, Inver Grove Heights, Rochester and a virtual campus.

The Duluth campus is home to most undergraduate students. The 186-acre campus is set on a hill overlooking Lake Superior. Campus buildings include: Tower Hall, the Science Center, Our Lady Queen of Peace Chapel, Burns Wellness Commons, the 500-seat Mitchell Auditorium, the College Library, the St. Scholastica Theatre, Somers Residence Hall, and nine apartment complexes. A new Health Science Center housing graduate health science programs opened for classes in 2016. The building is at 940 Woodland Ave. in the BlueStone development, about a mile from the main campus.

===Library===
The college library provides over 350,000 print and electronic books, full-text journal databases, interlibrary loan services, laptops, wireless Internet access, group study rooms, and quiet study space. It is located on the upper floors of the Romanesque-styled Our Lady Queen of Peace Chapel building. Along with the library, the college archives preserves the written and visual history of the college, as well as housing special collections such as the papers of James Franklin Lewis.

===Tower Hall===

Tower Hall is St. Scholastica&#x27;s castle-like central building. Its origins date to a picnic in around 1907, when the Diocese of Duluth&#x27;s Bishop James McGolrick commented that the top of the hill at the college&#x27;s current site was a perfect location for a building. According to the historic records of Sister Agnes Somers, McGolrick and a group of students and sisters climbed to the top of the hill and placed a pile of stones, symbolizing the cornerstone of what would eventually become Tower Hall. In 1906, architects Anton Werner Lignell and Frederick German were hired to draw the plans for the school, Villa Sancta Scholastica Academy, and the motherhouse. Mother Scholastica Kerst disapproved of the plans due to potential defects in the building&#x27;s design, and the two architects were fired from the project in 1908; it was taken over by Franklin Ellerbe. The following year saw the groundbreaking and start of construction for Tower Hall. Its first unit was completed in 1909. That September, 75 students from the Institute of the Sacred Heart were relocated to what was then called Villa St. Scholastica. Tower Hall was completed in 1928, and had two towers, a north to south axis of 375 feet, turrets at each end, recessed fenestration, and Tudor towers flanking the façade.

Sharing the campus are St. Scholastica Monastery, home of the Benedictine Sisters; and the Benedictine Health Center and Westwood Assisted Living Facility, which provide experiences for many of the college&#x27;s health science and behavioral arts and sciences students.

In September 2012, the college&#x27;s Centennial year, St. Scholastica opened a 40,000 square-foot addition to its existing 125,000 square-foot Science Center. The addition includes seven laboratories for chemistry and biochemistry, six faculty-undergraduate student research areas, two classrooms for pre-laboratory meetings and general class use, faculty offices, an atrium-style gathering area, a greenhouse, and state-of-the-art environmental and sustainable technologies throughout, including for storage of chemicals and treatment of hazardous waste.

== Academics ==
The college awards bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s degrees, and doctoral degrees, and has a student-to-faculty ratio of 14:1. Undergraduate majors include liberal arts and science programs as well as pre-professional programs. Graduate degrees are offered in health professions, education, technology, business, and social work.

All first-year students take part in a program called Dignitas (Dignity). The program&#x27;s goals are that participants will accept and value the challenges and responsibilities involved in being a first-year college student, reflect on issues from various perspectives, and make connections with the larger community. A combination of course material, co-curricular activities, and common experiences is intended to prepare students for learning both during and after college.

In its 2025 rankings, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the university&#x27;s undergraduate program 259th (tied) among 436 national universities.

<text>Lagos de Moreno () is a city and municipality in the State of Jalisco, Mexico. Lagos is located in the region of Los Altos de Jalisco, within the macroregion of the Bajío, one of the most highly developed areas in Latin America. Lagos de Moreno is occasionally known as the &quot;Athens of Jalisco&quot;, owing to the numerous writers and poets who were born there.

Lagos de Moreno was founded as Villa Santa Maria de los Lagos on March 31, 1563, by Don Hernando Martel, an Andalusian conquistador. The town was the economic and cultural center of a region that eventually attracted many ranchers. By 1600 there were over 20,000 cattle in the region. Santa Maria continued growing both physically and culturally, and by the 1800s, the town was elevated to a city and renamed to Lagos de Moreno in honor of Pedro Moreno. Lagos de Moreno was the site of the signing of several important political documents, the two identically named but unrelated &quot;Convenios de Lagos&quot;. The arts flourished in the city during the latter half of the 19th century, but this literary boom decreased somewhat after the Mexican Revolution, especially during the 1940s. Recently, Lagos de Moreno has become an important cultural and tourist destination thanks to its rich history and architecture, some of which still stands from the 17th century.

As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 111,569, making it the 6th largest city in the state of Jalisco. The municipality had a population of 172,403 in 2020. It includes many other outlying small communities, the largest of which are Paso de Cuarenta (San Miguel de Cuarenta) and Los Azulitos.

== Etymology ==
The conquistador Hernando Martel gave Lagos de Moreno its original name, Villa de Santa Maria de los Lagos (Town of Saint Mary of the Lakes). The town&#x27;s name was derived from Saint Mary, the townspeople&#x27;s chosen patron saint, and the numerous lakes that used to be scattered across the valley. The town was renamed on April 9, 1829, as Lagos de Moreno in honor of Mexican independence hero Pedro Moreno, who was born in the city.

==History==

=== Pre-hispanic era ===
The origins of Lagos de Moreno date to its founding as Pechichitlán or Teziziatlan by Ahnuvic VII in about 1028 BCE. Then the city served as a capital for the Chichimecatlalli fiefdom. In the 12th century, semi-nomadic Guachichiles occupied the valley and dominated an extensive area stretching from present-day San Juan de los Lagos to southern Coahuila. Before the colonization of Mexico began, indigenous culture thrived in this area, with notable pre-Hispanic architecture being established at Rincón de Mesa, Sauceda, and El Maguey.

=== Colonial era ===
After the fall of the Aztec Empire, explorers set out to explore the western frontier in the Bajio Region. The Spanish expansion in Nueva Galicia was slowed down by several tribes in the vicinity, such as the semi-nomadic Chichimecas and the Guachichiles. To the east of Pechititan, the Guamares inhabited the Guanajuato area, and to the west, the Zacatecos lived. The Zacateco caudillos (chiefs), Xiconaqui and Custique, along with the Chichimecas, struck down multiple Spanish invasions from 1550 to 1590 in the well-known Chichimeca War.

However, encomenderos gradually occupied the Bajio. The first Spaniard to build a hacienda in the &quot;Laguense&quot; valley was Don Diego de Ibarra. Even so, in 1551, a group of Chichimecas attacked his ranch (La Sauceda and San Antonio) and killed all his animals. The constant raids in the area made, for the time being, made settlement of the Lagos region impossible.

==== Founding of Lagos ====

After decades of constant combat and raids, the first Spanish authorities of the region were appointed; the priest of Teocaltiche and the Mayor of Teocaltiche had the region stretching from Teocaltiche to the Lagos valley as their jurisdiction. Later, the Royal Audiencia of Nueva Galicia ordered the Mayor of Teocaltiche, Don Hernando Martel from Seville, to establish a town in the vicinity of Pechichitan. The new settlement was founded jointly with the first priest and vicar of the local parish, father Juan de Cuenca Virues, who also participated in the official founding of the Real Comanja mine in 1561. As such, on March 31, 1563, &quot;Villa de Santa María de los Lagos&quot; was founded by Martel and Cuenca, along with around 100 Spanish noble families.

Development

The residents of Santa Maria chose the Virgin Mary as the namesake of their town and Saint Sebastian as a minor patron saint. The settlement and its surroundings became quite appealing to ranchers; by 1600 around 20,000 head of cattle were active in the Lagos valley, facilitating the eventual creation of the charreria-style rodeo. The increasing population of the area contributed to the naming of the first ordinary Mayor of Santa Maria de los Lagos, the miner Pedro Marfil from Guanajuato. Marfil would be succeeded by Gonzalo Vazquez Baladez, the first and only clergyman to-date to serve as mayor of the town.

The town continued to grow steadily in the 17th century, benefiting from the general prosperity of the Golden Age of the Spanish Empire. In 1615, a new jail was inaugurated, and 1621 saw the construction of a third parish temple with a tower that would be completed by 1685. Religious buildings were created often during this period; the Convent of the Poor Capuchins of Saint Joseph was founded and the construction of the Parish Church of Our Lady of the Assumption and the Temple of Our Lady of the Rosary began during this time.

==== Mexican War of Independence ====
Santa Maria de los Lagos, like the rest of New Spain, underwent rapid political change in the early 1800s. Local lawyer Francisco Primo de Verdad y Ramos spoke openly to the colonial authorities, advocating for Mexican independence. However, he soon died under mysterious circumstances in the dungeon of the Mexico City Trustee building. In the initial phase of the war, Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla visited Santa Maria de los Lagos and provided religious services there, and recruited some families for the fight against the forces of the Spanish Viceroy.

=== Independence to present ===

In 1823, the &quot;Convenio de Lagos&quot; (Agreement of Lagos) was signed in Santa Maria by Nicolas Bravo, Pedro Celestino Negrete, and Luis Quintanar, establishing the Free and Sovereign State of Jalisco. On March 27, 1824, Santa Maria was given the title of city. On April 9, 1829, the city was renamed as Lagos de Moreno in memory of insurgent General Pedro Moreno (1775–1817), a founding father of Mexico who led forces against Spanish authorities in the Mexican War of Independence.

In 1855, a second and similarly titled &quot;Convenio de Lagos&quot; (Agreement of Lagos) was signed in Lagos de Moreno, in which Manuel Doblado and Antonio de Haro y Tamariz recognized the Plan of Ayutla, thus joining the movement to topple conservative President Antonio López de Santa Ana. During the Reform War, Lagos de Moreno changed hands between liberal and conservative forces multiple times until an eventual liberal victory in 1861.

During the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s, residents of Lagos de Moreno like Mariano Azuela and Francisco Guerrero Ramirez joined the fighting. In the subsequent Cristero War, the nearby Mesa Redonda was the site of a battle between federal troops and rebel forces.

In 1963, Lagos de Moreno celebrated the 400th anniversary of its founding. In recent times, the city has received several important titles. It has been named an Area of Historical Monuments by the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) in 1989, a World Heritage Site on the Camino Real &quot;Tierra Adentro&quot; by UNESCO on August 1, 2010, and &quot;Pueblo Mágico&quot; by SECTUR on November 16, 2012.

==Geography==

=== Climate ===
Lagos de Moreno has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cwb&quot;) with mild temperatures year round. Temperatures are generally similar for any given month, but daily high and low fluctuations can be very sharp in the winter due in part to the city&#x27;s altitude and its uneven surroundings. Winters are mild with an average maximum temperature of in January although nighttime temperatures are often cold, with an average minimum temperature of . Many days are sunny, averaging around 15-19 clear days per month and precipitation is low. Nighttime temperatures regularly fall below but extended periods of frost are rare.

The Bajio&#x27;s two main seasons are the rainy season and the dry season. The rainy season, which runs from June to October, sees an increase in precipitation and humidity, with July and August being the months with the most precipitation.

Lagos is located in the region of Los Altos de Jalisco, within the macroregion of the Bajío, one of the most highly developed areas in Latin America. The city&#x27;s vicinity is quite mountainous and hilly, with the nearby Mesa Redonda being a particularly notable formation.

=== Flora and fauna ===
The nearby Mesa Redonda is home to many unique species of flora. There, two species of cactus endemic only to Jalisco flourish, with one of these species only being endemic to the Mesa Redonda, particularly its very steep slopes, protecting it from predators.

Many animals call the Lagos valley home, with fauna including hares, rabbits, deers, and boars. Residents of nearby ranches have commented on the presence of coyotes and snakes in rural areas. Areas like the Mesa Redonda have been utilized by locals to gather vegetables straight from nature, particularly prickly pear cacti.

<doc id="1344196" wikidata="Q6527022" url="?curid=1344196" title="Leopold Maxse">
<text>Leopold James Maxse (11 November 1864 – 22 January 1932) was an English amateur tennis player and journalist and editor of the conservative British publication, &quot;National Review&quot;, between August 1893 and his death in January 1932; he was succeeded as editor by his sister, Violet Milner. He was the son of Admiral Frederick Maxse, a Radical Liberal Unionist, who bought the &quot;National Review&quot; for him in 1893. Before the Great War, Maxse argued against liberal idealism in foreign policy, Cobdenite pacifism, Radical cosmopolitanism and, following the turn of the century, constantly warned of the &#x27;German menace&#x27;.

==Life==
Maxse was educated at Harrow School and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he took no degree. While at the latter institution he was elected President of the Cambridge Union Society. He was a close friend of journalist and neo-Jacobite Herbert Vivian at Cambridge, and both were frequent visitors at Oscar Browning&#x27;s apartment. He married Kitty Lushington (the model for Virginia Woolf&#x27;s Mrs Dalloway), at St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, Cobham in 1890. Maxse as a child had frequently visited France and via his father, he became as a young man an &quot;intimate&quot; friend with Georges Clemenceau.. 

Maxse was deeply involved in the Dreyfus affair and almost single-handedly via the &quot;National Review&quot; made the affair a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; in the United Kingdom. Between June 1898-November 1899, the &quot;National Review&quot; ran at least least articles per month about the Dreyfus affair. In August 1898, Maxse in what was described as &quot;a brilliant piece of sheer detective genius&quot; was the first to expose as a forgery the documents offered up by the war minister Jacques Marie Eugène Godefroy Cavaignac that supposedly proved the guilt of Captain Alfred Dreyfus. Maxse was firmly convinced of the innocence of Captain Dreyfus, whom he described as the victim of an anti-Semitic conspiracy and was relentless in championing his cause. At a time of Anglo-French tensions caused by the Fashoda Incident, the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, expressed the wish that Maxse cease annoying the French government with his claims there was an anti-Semitic conspiracy to frame Dreyfus as a spy for Germany and the real spy was another French Army officer, Ferdinand Esterhazy. Maxse ignored Salisbury&#x27;s request and continued with his Dreyfusard campaign. Maxse sought to win the sympathy of the readers of the &quot;National Review&quot; by publishing in English translation the letters written by Dreyfus from his prison cell on Devil&#x27;s Island to his wife and vice versa. Unlike other British newspapers like the &quot;Times&quot;, Maxse in the &quot;National Review&quot; engaged in the &quot;whodunit&quot; aspect of the affair, treating the case as a mystery to be solved along with colorful references to spies, veiled women, mysterious deaths and forgeries. 

He was a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb, but would then go on to be one of the most prominent and influential of the tory Die-Hards.

The &quot;National Review&quot; did not gain a distinct voice until the early part of the twentieth century. In 1903 Maxse became an ardent supporter of Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s Tariff Reform proposals. The &quot;National Review&quot; then became the most prominent ideological mainstay of the right-wing of the Conservative Party for two decades, and would flail those members of the Conservative Party who showed the slightest sign of equivocating on support for the House of Lords, the Union, and the Empire in the required manner. In 1911 he conducted the &quot;B.M.G.&quot; (Balfour Must Go) campaign which resulted in Arthur Balfour resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party, showing that Maxse had become a force to be reckoned among Conservative opinion makers.

Maxse supported the Entente, demanded rearmament and a strong policy against the German Empire, which he considered to be the greatest threat to the British Empire. Maxse eagerly welcomed the Great War, but was critical of the government&#x27;s failings. From 1917 he supported the National party against the Conservative Party leadership, whom he regarded as subservient to David Lloyd George and who would, therefore, keep him in high office.

Maxse argued that the 1918 victory against Germany gave the Allies a fleeting opportunity to destroy German power. He viewed the Treaty of Versailles as ineffectual towards that aim and blamed Allied politicians, Lloyd George especially, for bowing to President Wilson&#x27;s pressure to make the treaty less harsh. Maxse believed Germany was still able to restore itself as the dominant European power. 

Maxse vehemently opposed the League of Nations: in his view the League was a &quot;front-bench affair hurriedly adopted and recklessly advocated simply and solely to please President Wilson&quot;. He claimed Hindenburg and Ludendorff controlled Germany from behind-the-scenes, regardless of which politician was in office, and that it was unnecessary to appease Germany to prevent her from going Bolshevik because Prussian militarism was still the dominant force.

The Allied intervention in Russia, aimed at overthrowing the Bolsheviks, was supported by Maxse, not just because he disliked Bolshevism but because he wanted Russia to resume her pre-revolution role of being an anti-German power. Maxse was also pro-French and pro-Polish. During 1920–1922, Maxse attacked Lloyd George for failing to &quot;f[i]ght for a...greater France, support...Poland, sustain...Bohemia, nourish...Rumania [and] uphold our allies in Russia&quot;.

He became an outspoken critic of British Zionism, condemning attempts to occupy Palestine.

Maxse would lose influence with the advent of Stanley Baldwin as leader of the Conservative Party.

<doc id="1344202" wikidata="Q725416" url="?curid=1344202" title="Glenn Roeder">
<text>Glenn Victor Roeder (13 December 1955 – 28 February 2021) was an English professional football player and manager.

As a player, Roeder played as a defender for Arsenal, Leyton Orient, Queens Park Rangers, Notts County, Newcastle United, Watford and Gillingham. He also represented the England national B team.

His managerial career included spells with numerous clubs including Gillingham, Watford, West Ham United, Newcastle United (with whom he won the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup) and Norwich City. It was while he was at West Ham United that he was initially diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2003. He later acted as a managerial advisor for Stevenage.

==Playing career==
Roeder was born in Woodford, Essex, on 13 December 1955 and played for Gidea Park Rangers and Essex and London schools, joining Arsenal as a schoolboy in December 1969 and then Orient in August 1972 after being released by Arsenal. He made his name as a classy ball-playing defender who was a member of the Orient playing squad in the Second Division during the 1970s that reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1978. He transferred to Queens Park Rangers for £250,000 in August 1978 where he made 181 senior appearances and captained the team to the 1982 FA Cup Final against Tottenham, missing the replay due to suspension, and to the Second Division title in 1983.

Roeder was one of the first players famed for using the step over -the Roeder shuffle- a technique Roeder claimed, his father taught him as a child.

Roeder had a brief loan spell at Notts County. Roeder transferred to Newcastle United for £125,000 in December 1983, where he was captain and made 219 senior appearances during five years at the club, winning promotion from the Second Division in 1984. He joined Watford on a free transfer in July 1989, making 78 senior appearances in two years, and later returned to the renamed Leyton Orient, playing eight games in 1992, before a six-game stint to finish his playing career at Gillingham, whom he had joined as player-manager in November 1992.

==Managerial and coaching career==

===Gillingham===
Roeder spent one season as player-manager of Gillingham, during which time he led the side to 10 wins in 37 games and saw them finish second from bottom of the Football League, escaping relegation after winning against bottom club Halifax Town in the penultimate fixture of the season. He resigned in July 1993 to take over at Watford.

===Watford===
After Steve Perryman left to join Tottenham Hotspur, Roeder was hired as the new manager of his former club Watford at the start of the 1993–94 season. However, Watford were fined £10,000 for an illegal approach, and ordered to pay Gillingham a further £30,000 in compensation. In his second season with Watford he almost took the side to the play-offs, eventually finishing just two places outside them. However, he was sacked in February 1996 as the side were struggling at the bottom of the First Division. His replacement, Graham Taylor, was unable to prevent the side from being relegated. During his time at Vicarage Road he signed Kevin Phillips from local Hertfordshire team, Baldock Town for only £10,000.

===Burnley===
Roeder followed his tenure at Watford by taking a season away from the limelight, assuming a back seat role as Chris Waddle&#x27;s assistant manager at Burnley. The partnership did not prove to be successful and the pair narrowly avoided steering Burnley into the bottom tier of English football. Only a home victory over Plymouth Argyle on the last day staved off relegation. Roeder proved to be both an unpopular and controversial figure to the Burnley fans, hitting a low point when he was reported to have said that star player Glen Little was &quot;not fit to lace the boots&quot; of manager Chris Waddle. Roeder left his role at Burnley alongside Waddle when the pair departed the club after only a single season in charge.

===England===
Roeder then worked as a coach under Glenn Hoddle for the England national team, before West Ham manager Harry Redknapp offered him an opportunity in club football again in 1999.

===West Ham United===
West Ham manager Harry Redknapp initially appointed Roeder as a coach and scout at the club in 1999. However at the end of the 2000/2001 season Redknapp left the club following a dispute over transfer funds, and the Hammers&#x27; failed in their attempts to attract Steve McClaren and then Alan Curbishley. Unexpectedly Roeder was appointed manager. The appointment was opposed by some supporters, who had expected a bigger name to replace Redknapp. Roeder received a £15 million transfer kitty, and guided West Ham to seventh in his first season in charge. He signed David James from Aston Villa, Tomáš Řepka from ACF Fiorentina for £5.5 million, and Don Hutchison from Sunderland for £5 million, a club record fee at the time, and made permanent the transfer of Sebastien Schemmel who had impressed on loan the prior season. The club started the season poorly, James was injured on international duty before he could make an appearance for the club, and several other regulars continued to miss large portions of the season while Repka was sent off twice in the first 5 games of the season. However the club recovered to finish in 7th position in Roeders first season in charge, with young player Jermain Defoe making an immediate impact up front with Frederic Kanoute and Schemmel going on to win the Hammer of the Year award.

The 2002–03 season started off similarly poorly as West Ham struggled with injuries to their forwards and midfielders leaving them with Defoe as their main, and often the only fully fit, forward. West Ham had spent no money over the summer, their only significant permanent signing being free agent Gary Breen who had impressed at the 2002 World Cup for Ireland. West Ham were bottom at Christmas with only 3 wins and a half dozen draws to their name. At that time no team had ever avoided relegation from that position. The board made limited funds available after Christmas, and the January signings of Rufus Brevett, Les Ferdinand and loan of Lee Bowyer on a short-term deal helped to improve the clubs form, winning 4 and drawing 3 of their next 10 games. Roeder had a dispute with striker Paolo Di Canio after he substituted Di Canio in a match against West Bromwich Albion due to injury. Di Canio subsequently missed all but two of the remaining games of the season.

In April 2003 Roeder collapsed due to a brain tumour and was replaced by Trevor Brooking for the final three games of the season. Despite the late rally that saw West Ham win 7, draw 4 and lose 3, West Ham were relegated with a record number of 42 points, 2 points behind a Bolton Wanderers team they had lost to with 4 games to go.

Roeder returned to work in July 2003, stating he had &quot;unfinished business&quot;. In the 2003 close season, many of West Ham&#x27;s star players, such as Trevor Sinclair, Frédéric Kanouté and Joe Cole left the club as a result of relegation. Cole refused the offer of a new contract and moved to Chelsea. Roeder was sacked by West Ham in August 2003, following a defeat to Rotherham United. He had managed only three league games of the new season with West Ham now playing in the second tier. The season started with a 2–1 away win against Preston North End. However after a home goalless draw against Sheffield United on 16 August 2003, the team were jeered from the pitch. He was again replaced by Trevor Brooking as manager.

===Newcastle United===
After nearly two years out of the game, he returned to football in June 2005 when he was named youth-development manager of Newcastle United. After Graeme Souness was sacked as Newcastle manager in February 2006, Roeder was appointed caretaker manager, with striker Alan Shearer, then still also a player, as his assistant. He was able to turn the Magpies&#x27; season around, rescuing them from near the foot of the table to finish seventh in the Premier League with a place in the Intertoto Cup. Freddy Shepherd, Newcastle United&#x27;s chairman, consequently named Roeder as first in line to become full-time manager at the club, on condition that Newcastle obtain dispensation from the FA Premier League to allow Roeder to continue without the mandatory UEFA Pro Licence. Newcastle claimed exceptional circumstances as Roeder was halfway to gaining the licence when he suffered his brain tumour. The Premier League at first rejected Newcastle&#x27;s request on 3 May 2006 in accordance with UEFA rules which would not allow Roeder the position. Freddy Shepherd however lobbied the backing of all 19 other premier league club chairmen and they voted in favour of Roeder being allowed to gain the correct licence while in the job. Roeder was named as Newcastle&#x27;s permanent manager on 16 May, signing a two-year contract with the club.

On 1 June 2006, Roeder appointed Kevin Bond as his assistant. Roeder had worked with Bond at West Ham where Bond was a scout. Roeder believed the two of them would work well together, however Bond&#x27;s contract at the club was terminated after allegations he was prepared to take bungs for players whilst at Portsmouth. On 22 October 2006, Roeder announced that ex-Middlesbrough player and recent care-taker manager of West Brom, Nigel Pearson would be his new assistant manager.

Under Roeder, Newcastle won the 2006 Intertoto Cup by virtue of being the furthest placed team to advance from the Intertoto Cup into the UEFA Cup. This made Roeder the first manager to win a trophy for Newcastle since 1969. After the 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United at home on 4 November 2006, there was a fan protest outside St. James&#x27; Park, that was shown live on Sky Sports channel PremPlus. However, notably much of the fans&#x27; criticism was directed at the chairman, Freddy Shepherd, and not specifically at the manager himself. Roeder&#x27;s fortune didn&#x27;t improve, as Newcastle&#x27;s league form was inconsistent, due in large part to first-team player injuries and having to rely on inexperienced players from United&#x27;s Youth Academy to compete at top flight level, with Newcastle maintaining a mid-table position. After guiding Newcastle to just one win in ten games, Roeder was summoned to an emergency board meeting on 6 May 2007. It was revealed he had resigned with immediate effect.

Roeder won 45% of his matches, enough in a single season to qualify for European competition. Sam Allardyce who had resigned from Bolton Wanderers just weeks before, was named as his replacement on 15 May 2007.

===Norwich City===
In October 2007, Roeder joined Championship side Norwich City, signing a contract until 2010, with Norwich bottom of the division and four points adrift of safety. His first game in charge was on 4 November in the East Anglian derby against Ipswich Town, a match that ended 2–2. His first win came in the home game against Coventry City (24 November), which he followed up with a first away win of the season for Norwich in the 3–1 defeat of Blackpool (27 November), who previously had not lost at home that season. He then guided the team out of the relegation zone with a series of wins. Roeder began an overhaul of the squad in the January transfer window, releasing players such as Julien Brellier and David Střihavka. He made the loan signing of Matty Pattison permanent and also renewed the loan deals for Ched Evans and Mo Camara. Roeder also made four further loan signings including Matthew Bates, Keiran Gibbs, Alex Pearce and James Henry. Despite a poor run of form through February and March, Roeder kept Norwich in the Championship for another season, though survival was not confirmed until a 3–0 home win against QPR in the penultimate fixture of the season.

On 25 July 2008, Roeder was fined £1,000 and given a suspended two-match touchline ban at a FA disciplinary hearing after criticising referee Andy D&#x27;Urso following a 2–1 defeat to Bristol City at Ashton Gate Stadium on 29 March. Both Roeder and assistant Lee Clark reacted angrily to Bristol City being awarded a 91st minute free kick from which they scored the winner. Clark was given a one-match touchline ban and fined £500 for his part in the incident. They were both warned by The FA about their future conduct.

In May 2008 a few days after the last game of the season Roeder decided not to renew Darren Huckerby&#x27;s contract which angered many supporters as they were unable to give him a proper sendoff. Roeder brought in a number of loan players in the summer. Norwich made a difficult start to the 2008–09 season although there were some good results including a 5–2 win against top of the table Wolves in October. After that result, however, Norwich entered a poor run of form. A 2–0 win against local rivals Ipswich in the East Anglian Derby at the start of December helped to briefly relieve the pressure on Roeder, however after this Norwich won one further league game under his management against bottom of the league Charlton at Carrow Road in December. January began with a draw away at Charlton in the FA cup and a loss to Sheffield United. When the team lost the FA Cup third round replay 1–0 at Carrow Road against Charlton, who had not won in 18 games, Roeder was sacked the following day.

===Sheffield Wednesday advisor===
In April 2015 he joined Sheffield Wednesday, together with Adam Pearson, to work alongside Stuart Gray. The arrangement was terminated in December 2015.

===Stevenage managerial advisor===
In March 2016, Roeder was appointed a managerial advisor at Stevenage to Darren Sarll. He left Stevenage on 18 March 2018 after Sarll was sacked with the club 16th in EFL League Two.

==Death==
Roeder died on 28 February 2021, aged 65, in Newmarket, Suffolk, after an 18-year battle with a diagnosed brain tumour.

<doc id="1344210" wikidata="Q7339069" url="?curid=1344210" title="Rizal Day">
<text>Rizal Day (, ; ) is a Philippine national holiday commemorating life and works of José Rizal, a national hero of the Philippines. It is celebrated every December 30, the anniversary of Rizal&#x27;s 1896 execution at Bagumbayan (present-day Rizal Park) in Manila.

==History==
Rizal Day was first instituted with a decree dated December 20, 1898, signed by President Emilio Aguinaldo in Malolos, Bulacan, celebrating December 30, 1898, as a national day of mourning for Rizal and all the victims of the Spanish colonial rule of the Philippines. Daet, Camarines Norte was the first town to follow the decree, building a monument designed by Lt. Col. Antonio Sanz, led by Sanz and Lt. Col. Ildefonso Alegre, and financed by the townsfolk of Camarines Norte and the rest of the Bicol Region. Finished in February 1899, the three-tiered stone pylon inscribing Rizal&#x27;s novels &quot;Noli Me Tangere&quot; and &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot;, and Morga, for Antonio de Morga, author of &quot;Sucesos de las islas Filipinas&quot;, a book about the early days of the Spanish colonization in the Philippines.

With the victory of the Americans against the Spaniards in the Spanish–American War, the Americans took control of the Philippines. In an effort to demonstrate that they were more pro-Filipino than the Spaniards, the American Governor-General William Howard Taft in 1901 named Rizal a Philippine national hero. A year later, on February 1, 1902, the Philippine Commission enacted Act No. 345, which made December 30 a public holiday.

== Prohibited acts and activities during the commemoration of Rizal Day ==
To underscore the solemnity of the event, President Elpidio Quirino signed Republic Act No. 229 into law on June 9, 1948, which prohibits cockfighting, horse racing and jai-alai every December 30. The law also requires that flags across the country remain at half staff throughout the day and that every city and municipality in the Philippines should hold a solemn commemoration in their respective areas.

Those contravening Republic Act No. 229 shall be liable to a fine not exceeding or imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both, at the discretion of the court. If the offender holds the position of mayor in a municipality or city, an additional penalty of suspension from office for a duration of one month shall apply.

== Ceremonies ==

Rizal Day ceremonies are held at Rizal Park in Manila. This is usually held early in the morning, led by the president and vice president, and involves the raising of the national flag at Independence Flagpole, followed by a flypast by the Philippine Air Force and the laying of a wreath at the Rizal Monument. The president also usually has a year-end address that is first broadcast on this holiday.

Rites are also held elsewhere in the country, with the chief executive of a province, city, or town presiding. These rites are similar to the one in Manila, and most often include flag-raising, speeches, and wreath-laying ceremony at the locale&#x27;s own monument to Rizal.

==Rizal Days in history==
On his Rizal Day address on December 30, 1937, President Manuel L. Quezon declared through Commonwealth Act No. 184 the adoption of Tagalog as the national language. Under Japanese occupation during World War II, the Rizal Day program of 1942 attended by Benigno Aquino Sr., and President Jose P. Laurel included the recital of Rizal&#x27;s final poem &quot;Mi último adiós&quot; in Japanese and the inauguration of the KALIBAPI.

Rizal Day also doubled as the inauguration day of the incoming president, beginning in 1941 when President Quezon began his second term. Presidents usually chose Independence Grandstand (now known as Quirino Grandstand) as the inauguration venue because it faces the spot where Rizal was buried, and also the site of the independence ceremony in 1946, according to historian Manuel L. Quezon III. In the inauguration of Ramon Magsaysay after winning the 1953 presidential election via a landslide, around 300,000 to 500,000 people attended the ceremonies. With the approval of the 1973 constitution, inauguration days were moved to June 30.

On the centenary of Rizal&#x27;s death on December 30, 1996, the program included retracing Rizal&#x27;s last steps from his cell at Fort Santiago to the execution site, followed by a reenactment of his death and the customary flag-raising.

On December 30, 2000, local terrorists, with the backing of Jemaah Islamiyah, bombed five areas in Metro Manila, killing 22 and injuring 100.

== Changing the day of commemoration ==
Being that December 30 is sandwiched between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day, National Historical Commission chairperson Ambeth Ocampo pushed for the moving of Rizal Day from December 30 to June 19, Rizal&#x27;s birth. This would allow students to participate in commemoration activities as opposed to it being held on December 30 which is in the middle of the Christmas school break. The House of Representatives approved on its third reading a bill that would have changed it to June 19 on December 10, 2008, but was not acted in time by the Senate after the 14th Congress ended its session and was thus not enacted.

Additionally, Rizal&#x27;s birth anniversaries in 1958, 1959, 1961 to 1965, and 2011 (observed on June 20) were declared as public holidays observed nationwide. June 19 is also annually marked as a special non-working holiday in his home province of Laguna.

<doc id="1344212" wikidata="Q6526847" url="?curid=1344212" title="Leopard kung fu">
<text>Leopard kung fu is style of southern Chinese martial arts and is one of the Five Animal styles.

==History==

It was supposedly created by Jue Yuan with help from Bai Yufeng and Li Sou.

==Features of the style==
The emphasis of leopard is speed and angular attack. The leopard does not overwhelm or rely on strength, as does the tiger, but instead relies on speed and outsmarting its opponent. The power of the style derives from its aggressive speed. 

The leopard practitioner will focus on elbows, knees, low kicks, and leopard punches. Leopard kung fu is a hit, damage and run style designed to overcome superior forces with inferior resources. Counter attacks are sudden, indirect and short, with the aim of landing a debilitating technique.

The primary goals whilst learning the Leopard style are:

# Develop the speed of one&#x27;s muscles for external strength.
# Teaching patience so as to attack when the moment calls for it.
# Using the leopard punch for penetration.
# Training the lower body for enhanced springing power.

The leopard style was founded on the creators&#x27; observation of the movements of the leopard in the wild, and therefore practitioners of the style imitate these movements. Leopard style is geared towards the use of one to three technique combinations that cause a lot of damage, disorientating or even blinding the attacker. Blocking is wasted in Leopard – the style can best be summed up with the phrase: &quot;Why block when you can hit?&quot;. It does not rely on rooted stances, and would only assume a stance whilst attacking in order to launch at the opponent. The hit-and-run strategy of the leopard style, something especially effective against larger opponents, is unique to the animal.

The primary weapon is the leopard fist, which can be likened to a half-opened fist. The primary striking surface is the ridge formed by folding the fingers at the first phalangeal joint; the secondary striking surface is the palm hand. Some of the most well-known strikes include the &quot;&quot;Phoenix Eye&quot;, a punch to the pressure points near the eye and temple done by using only the knuckle of the index while the rest of the fingers are kept in a usual fist form. The leopard fist can also be modified by slightly lifting the fingers to form a claw, the &quot;Leopard Claw&quot;&quot; can be used to rake, slash, and tear at the face and throat of an assailant.

The leopard style is thought to be a midway point between the Tiger and Crane styles, in that it focuses on strength and height.

An interesting technique of the leopard is the ability to simultaneously block and strike the opponent. This is not commonly used in the harder martial arts (like the other Shaolin styles, for example). The sheer speed of the leopard is a defining characteristic of the style.

<doc id="1344213" wikidata="Q1483961" url="?curid=1344213" title="Nephoscope">
<text>A nephoscope is a 19th-century instrument for measuring the altitude, direction, and velocity of clouds, using transit-time measurement. This is different from a nephometer, which is an instrument used in measuring the amount of cloudiness.

==Description==
A nephoscope emits a light ray, which strikes and reflects off the base of a targeted cloud. The distance to the cloud can be estimated using the delay between sending the light ray and receiving it back:

==Mirror nephoscope==

Developed by Carl Gottfrid Fineman, this instrument consists of a magnetic compass, the case of which is covered with a black mirror, around which is movable a circular metal frame. A little window in this mirror enables the observer to see the tip of the compass needle underneath. On the surface of the mirror are engraved three concentric circles and four diameters; one of the latter passes through the middle of the little window. The mirror constitutes a compass card, its radii corresponding to the cardinal points. On the movable frame surrounding the mirror is fixed a vertical pointer graduated in millimeters, which can be moved up and down by means of a rack and pinion. The whole apparatus is mounted on a tripod stand provided with leveling screws.

To make an observation, the mirror is adjusted to the horizontal with the leveling-screws, and is oriented to the meridian by moving the whole apparatus until the compass needle is seen through the window, to lie in the north-south line of the mirror (making, however, allowance for the magnetic declination). The observer stands in such a position as to bring the image of any chosen part of a cloud at the center of the mirror. The vertical pointer is also adjusted by screwing it up or down and by rotating it around the mirror until its tip is reflected in the center of the mirror. As the image of the cloud moves toward the circumference of the mirror, the observer moves his head so as to keep the tip of the pointer and the cloud image in coincidence. The radius along which the image moves gives the direction of the cloud&#x27;s movement, and the time required to pass from one circle to the next its relative speed, which may be reduced to certain arbitrary units.

This instrument is, however, not very easy to use, and gives only moderately accurate measurements.

==Comb nephoscope==

Developed by Louis Besson in 1912, this apparatus consists of a horizontal bar fitted with several equidistant spikes and mounted on the upper end of a vertical pole which can be rotated on its axis. When an observation is to be made, the observer places himself in such a position that the central spike is projected on any chosen part of a cloud. Then, without altering his position, he causes the &quot;comb&quot; to turn by means of two cords in such a manner that the cloud is seen to follow along the line of spikes. A graduated circle, turning with the vertical pole, gives the direction of the cloud&#x27;s motion.

It is read with the aid of a fixed pointer. Moreover, when the apparatus is once oriented, the observer can determine the relative speed of the cloud by noting the time the latter requires to pass from one spike to the next. If the instrument stands on level ground, so that the observer&#x27;s eye is always at the same height, and if the interval between two successive spikes is equal to one-tenth of their altitude above the eye-level of the observer, one only needs to multiply the time required for the cloud to pass over one interval by 10 to determine the time the cloud travels a horizontal distance equal to its altitude.

Besson revived an old method, invented by Bravais for measuring the actual height of clouds. The apparatus in this case consists of a plate of glass having parallel faces, mounted on a graduated vertical circle which indicates its angle of inclination. A sheet of water, situated at a lower level, serves as a mirror to reflect the cloud. The water is contained in a reservoir of blackened cement surrounded by shrubbery, and is only a small fraction of an inch in depth, so that the wind may not disturb its level surface.

The observer, having mounted the glass plate on the horizontal axis of a theodolite set on a window-sill some 30 or 40 feet above the ground, places his eye close to it and adjusts its inclination so that the images of a cloud reflected in the plate and in the sheet of water coincide. Then from a curve traced once for all on a sheet of plotting paper he reads off the altitude of the cloud corresponding to the observed angle on the glass plate. The curve is plotted from simple trigonometrical calculations.

At the Observatory of Montsouris, the degree of cloudiness, i. e., the amount of the whole sky covered with clouds at a given moment, is determined by means of the nephometer, also devised by Besson. This consists of a convex glass mirror, a segment of a sphere, about twelve inches in diameter, in which is seen the reflection of the celestial vault divided into ten sections of equal area by means of lines engraved on the glass. As shown in the front page engraving, the meteorologist observes through an eyepiece fixed in an invariable position with respect to the mirror, which latter turns freely on a vertical axis. The observer, whose own image partly obstructs sections 8, 9. and 10, notes the degree of cloudiness in the sections numbered 1 to 7. The cloudiness of each section is estimated on a scale of 0 to 10: zero meaning no clouds and 10 entirely overcast. The observer would then rotate the mirror and eyepiece 180 degrees and observes the cloudiness in sections 7, 5, and 2, which represent the regions of the sky that at the first observation corresponded to sections 8, 9, and 10.

==Grid nephoscope==
The grid nephoscope is a variation of the comb nephoscope, invented in Norway.

==Russian nephoscope==
Mikhail Pomortsev invented a nephoscope in Russia in 1894.

<text>E-minis are futures contracts that represent a fraction of the value of standard futures. They are traded primarily on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. As of April, 2011, CME lists 44 unique E-mini contracts, of which approximately 10 have average daily trading volumes of over 1,000 contracts.

Some E-mini contracts provide trading advantages, including high liquidity, greater affordability for individual investors due to lower margin requirements than the full-size contracts, and round-the-clock trading 23.25 hours a day from Sunday afternoon to Friday afternoon. Under U.S. tax law, E-minis may qualify as 1256 Contracts, and benefit from several tax advantages as well.

The risk of loss is also amplified by the higher leverage.

== Symbology ==
Most E-mini futures expire quarterly (with the exception of agricultural products), in March, June, September, and December. An E-mini future symbol is formed by starting with the root symbol and adding the expiration month letter (the same as for futures) and the last digit of the expiration year. For example, the E-mini S&amp;P 500 expiring in December 2012 has the symbol ESZ2.

== E-mini contracts ==
The table below lists some of the more popular E-mini contracts, with the initial and maintenance margins required by CME. Note that individual brokers may require different margin amounts (also called performance bonds).

==E-mini options==
Options on E-minis exist for the E-mini S&amp;P 500 and the E-mini NASDAQ-100.

Corbin&#x27;s mother gave him his middle name in honor of author Sir James M. Barrie. He played football briefly in eighth grade, but soon moved to the arts, including acting and ballet classes. He graduated from Monterey High School in Lubbock, Texas. Corbin studied theater arts at Texas Tech University in Lubbock. 

At 21, he joined the U.S. Marine Corps, served two years, and then returned to Texas Tech.

==Career==
Corbin began his career in the 1960s as a Shakespearean actor, but today is more likely to be seen in the role of the sheriff, military leader, or some other authority figure, though on occasion, he has portrayed murderous villains. To moviegoers, he is well remembered as General Beringer in &quot;WarGames&quot;, John Travolta&#x27;s uncle Bob Davis in &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;, Clint Eastwood&#x27;s costar in &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot;, and Roscoe Brown, July Johnson&#x27;s bumbling deputy in the acclaimed Western &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;.

From 1979 until 1984, Corbin appeared in several episodes of &quot;Dallas&quot; as Sheriff Fenton Washburn. In 1983, he co-starred in the television miniseries &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;. Corbin played Mary Carson&#x27;s stockman Pete, who teaches the Clearys&#x27; sons how to shear sheep on their aunt&#x27;s gigantic Australian sheep station, Drogheda. Also in 1983, Corbin played Merit Sawyer in the television series &quot;Boone&quot;, cancelled after 10 episodes. Corbin&#x27;s role was as a stern father to the young actor Tom Byrd, who played Boone Sawyer, an aspiring singer.
From 1990 to 1995, Corbin portrayed former astronaut and local business leader Maurice Minnifield on &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, for which he received an Emmy Award nomination.

In 1994, Corbin narrated the acclaimed TV documentary &quot;MoonShot&quot;, telling the story of the 1960s space race from the first-person viewpoint of Mercury Seven astronaut Deke Slayton. From 2007 to 2012, Corbin appeared in the recurring role of Clay Johnson, father of Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson on &quot;The Closer&quot;.

Corbin played the role of General Carville in consecutive video games developed by Westwood Studios: in 1998, &quot;Red Alert: Retaliation&quot;; in 2000, &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2; and in 2001, Command &amp; Conquer: Yuri&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

In 2003, Corbin co-starred with &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; castmate John Cullum in &quot;Blackwater Elegy&quot;, a short film written by Matthew Porter and co-directed by Porter and Joe O&#x27;Brien.

From 2003 to 2009, Corbin played Whitey Durham, the basketball coach for the Tree Hill Ravens on the drama series &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;. He also had a role in 2007&#x27;s &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;. 

Corbin lost most of his hair in the 1990s due to alopecia areata. Since then, he has played various roles with a shaved head, wearing a cowboy hat, or occasionally wearing a full toupee. 

Corbin is the signature voice of radio station KPLX in Fort Worth, Texas, and has also voiced trailers and promotions for CMT and various other country radio stations. In 2014, he became the spokesman for the Texas Veterans Land Board. He also played a role in the Netflix series &quot;The Ranch&quot;. 

In 2020, Corbin had a recurring guest role as Everett Acker in &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;.

==Personal life==
Corbin has won many cutting-horse competitions. Much of his spare time is spent riding horses and tending to cattle on his small ranch near Fort Worth. He has volunteered his time to charity for many years, including rodeos and being spokesman for the National Alopecia Areata Foundation. In 2006, he participated in the Lubbock centennial.

In September 2011, Corbin was given a lifetime achievement award by the Estes Park Film Festival in Estes Park, Colorado. The Texas Film Hall of Fame inducted Corbin into its membership on March 8, 2012. In 2014, he was inducted into the National Multicultural Western Heritage Museum.

<text>There have been three creations of &quot;baronetcies&quot; for people with the surname Dunn; all three were in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom.

The first was settled on William Dunn, of The Retreat in the Parish of Lakenheath in the County of Suffolk on 29 July 1895, after whom the Sir William Dunn Professor of Biochemistry and the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at Oxford University are named. This creation became extinct upon his death in 1912.

A second creation was made on 25 June 1917 for Sir William Henry Dunn, of Clitheroe in the County Palatine of Lancaster, Lord Mayor of London. This creation became extinct upon the death of the second baronet in 1971.

The third and final creation was on 13 January 1921 for James Hamet Dunn, of Bathurst in the Province of New Brunswick in Canada, the Canadian financier and industrialist. This creation became extinct in 1976.

==Dunn baronets, of Clitheroe (1917)==
*Sir William Dunn, 1st Baronet (1856–1926)

*Sir Philip Gordon Dunn, 2nd Baronet (26 October 1905 – 20 June 1976). Dunn was an Anglo-Canadian businessman, landowner and farmer. He was the second child and only son of the wealthy Canadian financier and steel magnate Sir James Hamet Dunn, 1st Baronet, and his first wife, Gertrude Paterson Price. He had four sisters, as well as a half-sister, the artist Anne Dunn, from his father&#x27;s second marriage. In 1933, Dunn married Lady Mary Sybil St. Clair-Erskine, daughter of James St Clair-Erskine, 5th Earl of Rosslyn, with whom he had two daughters: Serena Mary (born 28 April 1934), who married Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild; and Nell Mary, Mrs. Jeremy Sandford (born 9 June 1936), who became a playwright and author. The baronetcy became extinct on Dunn&#x27;s death in 1976.

<doc id="1344252" wikidata="Q1967746" url="?curid=1344252" title="National Solidarity Party (Singapore)">
<text>The National Solidarity Party (abbreviation: NSP) is an opposition political party in Singapore.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The NSP was founded by a group of middle-class businessmen and women on 6 March 1987. The founding president and secretary-general of the party were Kum Teng Hock and Soon Kia Seng respectively. Kum was a former member of the ruling People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) while Soon was the ex-chairman of the Singapore Democratic Party.

According to its 1995 manifesto, the main political objective of the NSP was to organise and maintain a democratic movement that would ensure the solidarity and establishment of a just political system and standard of living. The party believed in a multi-party political system so that the rights and interests of the people could be proportionately represented. The NSP also aimed to establish an open and freely competitive economic environment that would provide sufficient opportunities for local enterprises. Today, the NSP continues to strive for these values. It continues to promote the establishment of a multi-party political system as well as a pro-business economic environment.

NSP made their political debut in the 1988 general election, and has contested in every election since. NSP also had contested in the 1992 by-election for the constituency of Marine Parade GRC, which was led by then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.

===As member of Singapore Democratic Alliance===
Ahead of the 2001 general election, the NSP became a founding member of the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA), along with the Singapore Justice Party (SJP), the Singapore People&#x27;s Party (SPP) and the Singapore Malay National Organization (PKMS). The Chairman of the alliance was the SPP leader and then-Member of Parliament (MP) for Potong Pasir, Chiam See Tong (who was the SDA&#x27;s only candidate-elect until 2011).

On the polling day, the party&#x27;s then-secretary General Steve Chia, who contested the Chua Chu Kang Single Member Constituency but defeated with a vote share of 34.6%, was the highest percentage secured by a losing opposition candidate at the election, and Chia assumed his Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) post, becoming the first non-Workers&#x27; Party (WP) NCMP to do so.

However, despite Chia losing his election but increased his margin to 39.63% in the 2006 general election, he lost his position as a NCMP and did not return to Parliament (the highest percentage among losing candidates was for the WP team of Aljunied GRC at 43.9%; party&#x27;s chairman Sylvia Lim succeeded Chia for the NCMP role).

===Party rebuild and the 2011 general election===
In 2007, the NSP decided to withdraw from the SDA with a view to &quot;explore new possibilities through wider latitude to manoeuvre, re-engineer, and rebuild the NSP&quot;. Sebastian Teo also took over the leadership of the party from Steve Chia. The party acquired a new collective colour of orange for their activity jersey as a sign of vitality, rebirth and unity, and the newsletter underwent a transformation and adopted the new name &quot;North Star&quot;.

In the 2011 election, the party fielded the most candidates of all Opposition parties for the election, with 24 candidates contesting in four Group Representation Constituencies (Chua Chu Kang GRC, Jurong GRC, Marine Parade GRC and Tampines GRC), and four Single Member Constituencies (Mountbatten SMC, Pioneer SMC, Radin Mas SMC and Whampoa SMC; the latter is currently defunct). This election saw a boost in electoral support for the NSP, notably receiving endorsement from the newly formed Reform Party along their supporters. The party was led by then Secretary-General Goh Meng Seng (a former WP candidate, and currently the leader for People&#x27;s Power Party), and saw introductions to prominent candidates, which include Nicole Seah, Hazel Poa, Tony Tan Lay Thiam and Jeanette Chong-Aruldoss.

However, despite fielding notable candidates such as former MP Cheo Chai Chen and entrepreneur Hazel Poa, the undefinable branding took a huge toll on the party by a lack of a strong party brand, as the party was defeated in all eight of the contested constituencies; Goh resigned from his post shortly after the election.

===General Election 2015===
The party expressed intention to contest five constituencies (MacPherson, Marine Parade, Pioneer, Sembawang and Tampines), but the party shortly dropped out on MacPherson and Marine Parade, citing the possibility of multi-cornered contests that were likely to dilute the votes from the incumbent opposition WP and reducing the chance for a more diverse Parliament.

The party later changed their mind a few days later, and announced their intention to contest MacPherson SMC citing closeness with the constituency as they had contested there in the prior election. In a response, a few party members, such as acting secretary-general Hazel Poa and a CEC member Fazli Talip, resigned from NSP, citing that they were strongly opposed on a very controversial decision to contest MacPherson. The party initially fielded Chia as the candidate, but he later withdrew on 23 August due to the online abuse that received from him, and the party eventually chose Cheo as a candidate. Prior to the election, few members had earlier resigned, which members include Nicole Seah and Jeanette Chong-Aruldoss, who later joined WP and SPP, respectively.

During the campaigning period, Cheo drew public outcry on an interview citing MacPherson&#x27;s incumbent Tin Pei Ling&#x27;s status as a new mother was &quot;her weakness&quot; and saying that she might spend more time focusing on her child than on her constituents, and later claimed it as a joke. On 8 September, Tampines GRC candidate Choong Hon Heng&#x27;s rally on booing PAP had gone viral.

The party failed to win any of the constituencies, and Cheo had his S$14,500 electoral deposit forfeited as a consequence of garnering less than 12.5% of the valid votes cast for MacPherson (215 or 0.82%).

Earlier, Lim Tean was appointed as acting-secretary general following Poa&#x27;s resignation, but resigned from his post and left NSP in May 2017, and formed his new party, Peoples Voice, in October 2018.

===General election 2020===
The party fielded a total of 10 candidates and contested Sembawang and Tampines in the 2020 elections. The party also expressed interest in contesting MacPherson and Pioneer, but both withdrew and respectively backed the People&#x27;s Power Party and Progress Singapore Party. Ahead of elections, Steve Chia also resigned from NSP and participated the Singapore People&#x27;s Party and became the new secretary-general a year later.

On polling day on 10 July, the party neither won any GRCs, but improved their both shares for popular vote and overall vote share by 25.27% and 3.53% to 33.15% and 3.76%, respectively. Former NSP and now-PSP member Hazel Poa however fell short on being elected in the West Coast GRC (whose team led by former PAP MP and 2011 presidential candidate Tan Cheng Bock) in about a 4% margin, but by-virtue on having the best performing result among losing candidates, Poa became a Non-constituency Member of Parliament along with Leong Mun Wai.

===The Coalition===
In 2024, NSP joined Singapore United Party, Red Dot United and former SDA partner SPP to form The Coalition. This new alliance will not be officially registered but partners will contest the next election under their own party tickets while collaborating their efforts.

==Ideology==
In late-2007, the NSP formulated a set of political objectives and mission statements. According to its website, these are:

Political Ideology: The National Solidarity Party believes in a multi-political system that upholds economic progress and nation-building as the twin pillars of a strong and vibrant Singapore where the supremacy of the citizenry is respected and the natural rights of every individual may be enjoyed in harmony with a fair and equitable society.

Mission Statements: NSP exists to uphold democracy and to provide constructive policies. The Party positively promotes the establishment of a multi-party political system. It envisions to be a credible and caring political party in the pursue of rational and responsible politics in the interest of Singapore and Singaporeans.

Core Values: 
* The Right to Dignity
* Respect for Diversity
* Service to Society

<doc id="1344253" wikidata="Q1325217" url="?curid=1344253" title="Flubber (film)">
<text>Flubber is a 1997 American science-fiction comedy film directed by Les Mayfield (who had previously directed the John Hughes scripted remake, &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;) and written by Hughes and Bill Walsh. A remake of &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot; (1961), the film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and stars Robin Williams, Marcia Gay Harden, Christopher McDonald, Ted Levine, Raymond J. Barry, Wil Wheaton and Clancy Brown, with Jodi Benson providing a voice. The film grossed $178 million worldwide and received negative reviews from critics. In selected theaters, the &quot;Pepper Ann&quot; episode &quot;Old Best Friend&quot; was featured before the film.

==Plot==

Absentminded professor Philip Brainard is developing a new energy source, hoping to save Medfield College from closure. His preoccupation with his research has caused him to miss two wedding dates, much to the ire of his fiancée, college president Sara Jean Reynolds. On their third attempted wedding day, Brainard is approached by his former partner Wilson Croft of rival Rutland College, who has profited from stealing his ideas and now intends to steal Sara.

While preparing for the wedding, Brainard has a breakthrough with the help of his robot assistant Weebo, who is secretly in love with him. Their experiment results in a sentient green goo with enormous elasticity and kinetic energy, which wreaks havoc on the neighborhood before the professor recaptures it. Weebo classifies the substance as &quot;flying rubber&quot;, leading Brainard to christen it &quot;Flubber&quot;. Working on Flubber into the following morning, Brainard realizes too late that he has again missed his own wedding. A heartbroken Sara refuses to hear his explanation, leaving Brainard determined to prove Flubber&#x27;s worth and win her back.

Medfield College&#x27;s wealthy sponsor Chester Hoenicker, who is threatening to close the school, sends his henchmen Smith and Wesson to persuade Brainard to give Hoenicker&#x27;s entitled son Bennett a better grade. Brainard, too busy experimenting with Flubber, unknowingly subdues the goons with a Flubber-coated golf ball and bowling ball. Brainard also uses Flubber to enable his vintage Ford Thunderbird to fly, and overhears Wilson make a flirtatious bet with Sara about Medfield&#x27;s upcoming basketball game against Rutland.

Struggling to confess her feelings for the professor, Weebo creates a holographic human version of herself and tries to kiss a sleeping Brainard, but he awakens with another idea for Flubber. Sneaking into the vacant basketball arena, he tests the effects of Flubber on a basketball and his shoes, allowing him to bounce incredibly far. At the game, he secretly applies Flubber to the abysmally unskilled Medfield team, enabling them to beat Rutland, but his attempt to win back Sara fails. Meanwhile, a mischievous Weebo releases Flubber to dance around the house.

Returning home, Brainard talks to Weebo, declaring that his absentmindedness is due to his love for Sara. Weebo, putting the professor&#x27;s happiness before her own, shows Sara footage of Brainard&#x27;s declaration, and the couple reconciles. Brainard demonstrates Flubber&#x27;s abilities to Sara, but Hoenicker has discovered Flubber&#x27;s profitable potential, offering to buy it and forgive the college&#x27;s debt. Brainard and Sara refuse, making a deal with the Ford Motor Company instead and saving the school. Hoenicker sends Smith and Wesson to raid Brainard&#x27;s house, where Weebo attempts to fend them off but is destroyed as they steal Flubber.

Mourning the loss of his beloved robot, Brainard discovers a farewell video from Weebo along with a backup of herself, her &quot;daughter&quot; Weebette. Brainard and Sara confront Hoenicker under the guise of selling him additional Flubber, and discover he is in league with Wilson. Unleashing Flubber, Brainard and Sara defeat Wilson, the Hoenickers, and their henchmen. Sometime later, Brainard saves Medfield from closing with Flubber and the happy couple finally have a successful wedding and embark on their honeymoon to Hawaii in the flying Thunderbird with Weebette and Flubber.

==Production==
Filming began in 1996 in San Francisco on Treasure Island in Building 180 and Hangar 3. Sets constructed there included the basketball court, a duplicate of the Professor&#x27;s house, where some exterior and all interior shots were produced, a separate set portraying the basement of the house, and Hoenicker&#x27;s library. Many exterior shots of Brainard&#x27;s house were shot in San Jose at a home that was temporarily modified, including the addition of an observatory on the roof.

Sara Jean&#x27;s office, Hoenicker&#x27;s living room, and most exterior campus shots were produced at a private girls&#x27; high school on the San Francisco peninsula. The exterior shot of the Rutland gym was shot at Stanford. Some scenes were filmed on campus at San Jose State University in Washington Square Hall during production in 1997. The shot of the Professor and Sara Jean floating through the clouds in the Thunderbird was filmed at the former Mare Island Naval facility in Vallejo, California. Other scenes were filmed at the University of the Pacific, Stockton.

===Gag homages===
Many gags are embellishments from the 1961 film; John Hughes rewrote the original Bill Walsh screenplay (based on Samuel W. Taylor&#x27;s short story &quot;A Situation of Gravity&quot;, originally published in the May 22, 1943, issue of &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine). Although Walsh died in 1975, he received posthumous credit for this script.

==Release==
&quot;Flubber&quot; was released on VHS and Laserdisc on April 21, 1998. The DVD was released on June 16 of the same year, with the film&#x27;s original theatrical trailer as a bonus feature.

==Reception==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Flubber&quot; grossed $93 million in the United States and Canada, and $85 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $178 million.

The film opened alongside &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, and was projected to gross around $32.5 million in its five-day Thanksgiving opening weekend. It went on to debut to $26.7 million (and a total of $36.4 million over the five), topping the box office. It fell 58% to $11.3 million in its second weekend, remaining in first.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Flubber&quot; holds an approval rating of 24% based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 4.1/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;With its overactive focus on special effects and tiresome slapstick, &quot;Flubber&quot; squanders the immense talent of its cast and crew.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

<doc id="1344259" wikidata="Q5321525" url="?curid=1344259" title="E-mini S&amp;P">
<text>E-mini S&amp;P, often abbreviated to &quot;E-mini&quot; (despite the existence of many other E-mini contracts) and designated by the commodity ticker symbol &quot;ES&quot;, is a stock market index futures contract traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The notional value of one contract is 50 times the value of the S&amp;P 500 stock index; thus, for example, on December 04, 2024, the S&amp;P 500 cash index closed at 6,098.50, making each E-mini contract a $304,925 bet.

==History and structure==
The contract was introduced by the CME on September 9, 1997, after the value of the existing S&amp;P contract (then valued at 500 times the index, or over $500,000 at the time) became too large for many small traders. The E-mini quickly became the most popular equity index futures contract in the world. The original (&quot;big&quot;) S&amp;P contract was subsequently split 2:1, bringing it to 250 times the index. Hedge funds often prefer trading the E-mini over the big S&amp;P since the older (&quot;big&quot;) contract still uses the open outcry pit trading method, with its inherent delays, versus the all-electronic Globex system for the E-mini. The current average daily implied volume for the E-mini is over $100 billion, far exceeding the combined traded dollar volume of the underlying 500 stocks.

Following the success of this product, the exchange introduced the E-mini NASDAQ-100 contract, at one fifth of the original NASDAQ-100 index-based contract, and many other &quot;mini&quot; products geared primarily towards small speculators, as opposed to large hedgers.

In June 2005 the exchange introduced a yet smaller product based on the S&amp;P, with the underlying asset being 100 shares of the highly-popular SPDR exchange-traded fund. However, due to the different regulatory requirements, the performance bond (or &quot;margin&quot;) required for one such contract is almost as high as that for the five times larger E-mini contract. The product never became popular, with volumes rarely exceeding 10 contracts a day.

The E-mini contract trades from Sunday to Friday 5:00pm – 4:00pm (Chicago Time/CT) with a 15-minute trading halt from 3:15pm to 3:30pm CT. From 4:00pm to 5:00pm is a daily maintenance period.

==Outsized trades==

According to US government investigations, the sale of 75,000 E-mini contracts by a single trader was the trigger to cause the 2010 Flash Crash. According to the SEC/CFTC report, the firm &quot;accidentally instructed its trading program to dump them all in a series of sell orders over 20 minutes, rather than spreading the sell orders out over a much longer time period&quot;. This claim was later addressed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, not mentioning any &quot;accident&quot; and implying the program was a methodical hedge whose execution generated &quot;less than 9% of the volume during the&quot; twenty minutes.

On December 7, 2016, multiple buyers purchased around 16,000 E-mini S&amp;P 500, in what was described as a series of stop orders triggered by a single contract trading at 2225.00. The contracts traded as stops, traded &quot;all ... at the same nanosecond&quot;, were valued at $1.8 billion. The sequence of trades at new highs was prelude to a sharp market rally for the balance of the day and the two succeeding days. It was the biggest E-mini trade by more than a factor of two in 2016 and attracted comparison to the 2010 flash-crash trade.

<text>Sir Clinton Edward Dawkins, (2 November 1859 – 2 December 1905) was a British businessman and civil servant.

==Life==
Dawkins was born in London, the third son of Clinton George Dawkins, one time Consul-General in Venice, descended from the Dawkins family of Over Norton Park. His grandfather Henry Dawkins, MP for Aldborough, married the daughter of Gen. Sir Henry Clinton. He was educated at Cheltenham College and Balliol College, Oxford.

He succeeded Alfred Milner as private secretary to Chancellor of the Exchequer George Goschen in 1889. He later served overseas as undersecretary for finance in Egypt from 1895 to 1899. His final role was as financial advisor to Lord Curzon, Governor-General of India in 1899.

During 1899, he accepted an offer from the financier John Pierpont Morgan of full partnership in the London branch of his firm, J. S. Morgan &amp; Co., where he remained until his death in 1905. He was a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb.

In recognition of Dawkins&#x27; work in chairing a Committee reviewing the Administration of the War Office, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and invested as such by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902. He had been made a Companion (CB) of the same order in November the previous year.

In 1902 Dawkins purchased the country estate of Sir Walter Rockcliff Farquhar at Polesden Lacey. Dawkins was involved in the remodelling of the house at the centre of the estate.

Dawkins died from heart disease on 2 December 1905. He was survived by his wife Louise, daughter of Charles Johnston, and his daughter Dorothy. He was cremated and his ashes spread at Brookwood Cemetery on 6 December.

He was the three-times great uncle to British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. Much like his descendant, well known as an advocate of atheism, Sir Clinton Dawkins was known for being a strident positivist at Balliol. The Balliol rhyme published about him reads:

<doc id="1344269" wikidata="Q1637581" url="?curid=1344269" title="Hundred Reasons">
<text>Hundred Reasons are an English alternative rock band formed in London, England, in 1999. It consists of Colin Doran (vocals), Larry Hibbitt (guitar, vocals), Andy Gilmour (bass), and Andy Bews (drums).

After releasing &quot;EpOne&quot;, &quot;EpTwo&quot;, and &quot;EpThree&quot; between 2000 and 2001, Hundred Reasons issued their debut full-length album, &quot;Ideas Above Our Station&quot;, in 2002, to critical acclaim and commercial success. The album yielded the singles &quot;I&#x27;ll Find You&quot;, &quot;If I Could&quot;, &quot;Silver&quot;, and &quot;Falter&quot;, and was followed by &quot;Shatterproof Is Not a Challenge&quot; in 2004. After being dropped by Columbia Records, the band signed with V2 Records and released their third studio album, &quot;Kill Your Own&quot;, in 2006. Guitarist and vocalist Paul Townsend departed following the release and was replaced by Ben Doyle for the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Quick the Word, Sharp the Action&quot; (2007).

Following years of inactivity, Hundred Reasons played tenth-anniversary shows in 2012 and briefly reunited again for two shows in 2014. After regrouping in 2021, they issued their fifth album, &quot;Glorious Sunset&quot;, in 2023.

Hundred Reasons have had six top-40 hit singles and two top-20 hit albums.

==Career==
===Formation and first releases: 1999–2004===
Hundred Reasons was formed in London, England, in 1999. By 2001, they had released three EPs: &quot;EpOne&quot;, &quot;EpTwo&quot;, and &quot;EpThree&quot;, as well as a split EP with the American punk rock band Garrison.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Ideas Above Our Station&quot;, was released in 2002. It peaked at No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart, achieved Gold status, with sales of over 118,000 copies, and spawned several Top 40 hits on the UK Singles Chart.

Their second album, &quot;Shatterproof Is Not A Challenge&quot;, was released in 2004. Despite successful tours and achieving Silver status with sales of more than 65,000 copies within four months, Hundred Reasons were dropped by Sony BMG in June 2004.

===Subsequent releases and lineup change (2005–2009)===
Hundred Reasons signed to V2 Records in September 2005 and issued their third studio album, &quot;Kill Your Own&quot;, in 2006. In August of that year, it was announced on the band&#x27;s official website that guitarist and vocalist Paul Townsend would be leaving the band. He was replaced by Ben Doyle of the Lucky Nine.

In October 2007, the band published their fourth album, &quot;Quick the Word, Sharp the Action&quot;. Less than a month later, V2 Records was purchased by Universal Records and left the band without a label once more. They re-released a remastered version of &quot;Quick the Word, Sharp the Action&quot; in 2009.

===Hiatus and reunion shows (2009–2014)===
After the re-release of &quot;Quick the Word, Sharp the Action&quot;, Hundred Reasons went on an extended hiatus. Reflecting on this period in an interview with &quot;NME&quot; in 2022, Doran stated: &quot;After &quot;Quick the Word&quot;, personally for me that felt like it was going to be it. I&#x27;m quite pragmatic and I think it had some good songs on it, but it wasn&#x27;t what I would call our best record. Things were on a bit of a downward turn, to be open and frank about it. We just ended up, not necessarily dissolving the band but everybody had to go and find other things to do. Those things took over, then weeks turned into months, which turned into years. Larry was building his career as a producer, I was in education and doing stuff like that, Bews was living in America which made rehearsal quite different, and Andy was in another band at the time called Freeze Atlantic.&quot;

In April 2012, the band announced that they would be performing songs from their first album, &quot;Ideas Above Our Station&quot;, at both Banquet Records&#x27; Big Day Out and 2000Trees, and that they had been rejoined by Paul Townsend. Hell Is for Heroes drummer Joe Birch performed with them that summer.&quot;

On 8 May, it was revealed that Townsend would not be performing with the band after all.

In 2014, Hundred Reasons reunited once more to play the Sonisphere Festival.

===&quot;Glorious Sunset&quot; (2022–present)===
On 25 October 2022, the band announced that they would be releasing their first new music in fifteen years, with a single called &quot;Glorious Sunset&quot;. A full-length album, also titled &quot;Glorious Sunset&quot;, came out on 24 February 2023.

<doc id="1344277" wikidata="Q337224" url="?curid=1344277" title="Academia Brasileira de Letras">
<text>The Academia Brasileira de Letras (ABL; English: &quot;Brazilian Academy of Letters&quot;) is a Brazilian literary non-profit society established at the end of the 19th century. The first president, Machado de Assis, declared its foundation on Tuesday, 15 December 1896, with the by-laws being passed on Thursday, 28 January 1897. On Tuesday, 20 July of the same year, the academy started its operation.

According to its statutes, it is the pre-eminent Portuguese council for matters pertaining to the Portuguese language. The ABL is considered the foremost institution devoted to the Portuguese language in Brazil. Its prestige and technical qualification gives it paramount authority in Brazilian Portuguese, even though it is not a public institution and no law grants it oversight over the language. The academy&#x27;s main publication in this field is the Orthographic Vocabulary of the Portuguese Language (&quot;Vocabulário Ortográfico da Língua Portuguesa&quot;) which has five editions. The &quot;Vocabulary&quot; is prepared by the academy&#x27;s Commission on Lexicology and Lexicography. If a word is not included in the &quot;Vocabulary&quot;, it is considered not to exist as a correct word in Brazilian Portuguese.

Since its beginning and to this day, the academy is composed of 40 members, known as the &quot;immortals&quot;. These members are chosen from among citizens of Brazil who have published works or books with recognized literary value. The position of &quot;immortal&quot; is awarded for the lifetime. New members are admitted by a vote of the academy members when one of the &quot;chairs&quot; become vacant. The chairs are numbered and each has a Patron: the Patrons are 40 great Brazilian writers that were already dead when the ABL was founded; the names of the Patrons were chosen by the Founders as to honour them &quot;post mortem&quot; by assigning patronage over a chair. Thus, each chair is associated with its current holder, her or his predecessors, the original Founder who occupied it in the first place, and also with a Patron.

The academicians use formal gala gilded uniforms with a sword (the uniform is called &quot;fardão&quot;) when participating in official meetings at the academy. The body has the task of acting as an official authority on the language; it is charged with publishing an official dictionary of the language. Its rulings, however, are not binding on either the public or the government.

==History==
===Foundation===
The initiative to establish the ABL was taken by and was realised in preparatory meetings that began on 15 December 1896, under the presidency of Machado de Assis. The statuses of the Brazilian Academy of Letters and the membership of the 40 founding fathers were approved at these meetings, on 28 January 1897. On 20 July of the same year, the inaugural session was held at the &quot;Pedagogium&quot;&#x27;s facility in the centre of Rio de Janeiro.

Without appointed headquarters or financial resources, the solemn meetings of the academy were held at the hall of the Royal Portuguese Cabinet of Reading, at the premises of the former National Gymnasium and at the Noble Hall of the Ministry of the Interior. The joint sessions were held at the law firm of Rodrigo Octávio, the ABL&#x27;s first secretary&#x27;s, at Quitanda Street, 47.

In 1904, the academy obtained the left wing of the Brazilian Silogeo, a governmental building that housed other cultural institutions. It remained there until moving to its own headquarters in 1923.

===Petit Trianon===
In 1923, thanks to the initiative of its president at the time, Afrânio Peixoto and of the then-French ambassador, Raymond Conty, the French government donated the French Pavilion building to the academy. The building had been built for the Independence of Brazil&#x27;s Centenary International Exposition by the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel, between 1762 and 1768 and was a replica of the Petit Trianon of Versailles.

These facilities have been inscribed as Brazilian Cultural heritage since Monday, 9 November 1987, by the State Institute of Cultural Heritage (INEPAC), of the Municipal Secretary of Culture of Rio de Janeiro. To the present day, its halls continue to host regular meetings, solemn sessions, commemorative meetings and inauguration sessions of the new academics, as well as the traditional Thursdays&#x27; tea. They are also open to the public for guided tours or for special cultural programs, such as chamber music concerts, book launches, conference cycles and theatre plays.

In the buildings&#x27; first floor hall stands the decorated marble floor, a French crystal chandelier, a large white porcelain vase from Sèvres and four English bas-reliefs. Inside the building, the following premises stand out:

* the Noble Hall, where the solemn sessions take place;
* the French Hall, where the new members traditionally remain alone, in reflection;
* the Room, where an oil painting on canvas of a collective of nineteenth-century writers and intellectuals, by the painter Rodolfo Amoedo, is depicted;
* the Hall of the Founders, decorated with period furniture and paintings by Candido Portinari;
* the Machado de Assis Room, decorated with the writer&#x27;s desk, books and personal belongings, such as portrait by painter Henrique Bernardelli;
* the Hall of Romantic Poets, which holds bronze busts of Castro Alves, Fagundes Varela, Gonçalves Dias, Casimiro de Abreu and Álvares de Azevedo, by Brazilian-Mexican sculptor Rodolfo Bernardelli.

On the second floor, one can find the Sessions Room, the Library the Tea Room. The Tea Room is the academics&#x27; meeting point before the Plenary Session, on Thursdays. The Library is used by scholars and researchers and holds a collection of Manuel Bandeira.

===Dictatorship===
During periods like the Vargas&#x27; totalitarian dictatorship or the Brazilian military government, the academy&#x27;s neutrality in choosing proper members dedicated to the literary profession was compromised with the election of politicians with few or no contributions to literature, such as ex-president and dictator Getúlio Vargas in 1943. The academy is also accused of not having defended culture expression and freedom of speech during both Vargas&#x27; Era and during the military dictatorship. Both of these ruling periods imposed heavy censorship on Brazilian culture, including Brazilian literature.

==Characteristic==
According to its statutes, the academy aims to promote the &quot;culture of the national language&quot;. It comprises 40 effective and perpetual members, known as &quot;immortals&quot;. These members are Brazilian citizens with published works of relevant literary value. Besides these members, the ABL also comprises 20 correspondent members.

All members go through a solemn session, in which dress the academy&#x27;s official garment for the first time. During the ceremony, the new member makes a speech remembering her or his predecessor and all previous members that occupied the chair.

The ABL, which was a traditionally male institution, elected its first female member on Friday, 4 November 1977 – the novelist Rachel de Queiroz. This groundbreaking election of the novelist opened the path for other female members. The academy currently has three women members (7.5% of its total membership).

===Nowadays===
Thanks to revenues over $ 4 million a year, the academy is financially stable. It owns a skyscraper with 28 floors (&quot;Palácio Austregésilo de Athayde&quot;) in the centre of Rio, which the academy rents for office space, generating 70% of its current revenue. The rest comes from rental of other buildings, which were inherited from book editor , in 1917, and from other financial investments. This comfortable situation allows the payment of a &quot;jeton&quot; to each academician.

The academy annually awards several literary prizes:
* the Prêmio Machado de Assis, the most important literature prize in the country, awarded for lifework;
* the ABL prizes for poetry, fiction, drama, essays, history of the literature and for children&#x27;s literature;
* the José Lins do Rego prize, an extraordinary commemorative prize awarded in 2001
* the Afonso Arinos prize, an extraordinary commemorative prize awarded in 2005.

The academy also publishes a literary periodical, the Brazilian Review (&quot;Revista Brasileira&quot;), with quarterly editions.

==Orthographic Vocabulary==

The academy&#x27;s main publication in this field is the &quot;Orthographic Vocabulary of the Portuguese Language&quot; (&quot;Vocabulário Ortográfico da Língua Portuguesa&quot;) of which there are five editions. The &quot;Vocabulary&quot; is prepared by the ABL&#x27;s Commission on Lexicology and Lexicography. If a word is not included in the &quot;Vocabulary&quot;, it is considered not to exist as a correct word in Brazilian Portuguese.

The &quot;Orthographic Vocabulary&quot;, however, is not a dictionary, as it contains words and their grammatical categories, but not the definition or meaning of the words listed. Thus, unlike the French Academy, the Royal Spanish Academy and other foreign institutions dedicated to the care of a national language, the Brazilian Academy of Letters hasn&#x27;t published an official dictionary. It has, however, published a School Dictionary of the Portuguese Language (&quot;Dicionário Escolar da Língua Portuguesa&quot;), with students as its target customers, in 2009.

The ABL does plan to publish a full and official Dictionary. For the time being, however, other dictionaries such as the &quot;Aurélio&quot; and the &quot;Houaiss&quot; remain more prestigious than the &quot;School Dictionary&quot;, in spite of the fact that the latter is sometimes marketed by booksellers as the &quot;ABL&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, due to its being authored by the academy. Both the &quot;Houaiss&quot; and the &quot;Aurélio&quot; Dictionaries, however, were first compiled by members of the academy Antônio Houaiss and Aurélio Buarque de Holanda Ferreira, respectively. The preparation of an official dictionary of the Portuguese language is a stated goal of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.

<text>Taco Management LLC, doing business as Taco Bueno, is a U.S.-based, quick service restaurant chain specializing in Tex-Mex-style cuisine. The company is headquartered in Farmers Branch, Texas, in the Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan area. Its first location opened in Abilene, Texas in 1967. The food chain has locations in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. 

==History==
Taco Bueno was founded in 1967 by Bill R. Waugh, an art graduate from Abilene Christian University. The first store was located in Abilene, Texas.

In 1981, British food manufacturer Unigate paid $32.5 million to acquire Taco Bueno.

In 1996, Taco Bueno was sold to Carl&#x27;s Jr.&#x27;s franchisor CKE Restaurants.

In 2001, the private investment group Jacobson Partners purchased the chain for $72.5 million to help aid CKE Restaurants in a debt battle.

On August 10, 2005, Palladium Equity Partners announced the purchase of Taco Bueno from Jacobson Partners. At the same time, John Miller was appointed CEO of Taco Bueno. In 2011, Ed Lambert became CEO of Taco Bueno, LP., followed by Mike Roper in 2015.

In fall 2015, Taco Bueno announced its first delivery expansion collaboration with mobile app Tapingo.

In early December 2015, Taco Bueno was purchased by TPG Growth, a division of the Fort Worth private-equity firm TPG Capital.

On April 28, 2017, season eight, episode seven of the CBS show &quot;Undercover Boss&quot;, debuted with the CEO of Taco Bueno going into the field to several Taco Bueno locations.

As of April 2018, Mike Roper who had left in late 2017, was replaced as CEO by Omar Janjua, who subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 6, 2018, for reorganization and continued operation, and also agreed to be acquired by Dallas-based Sun Holdings, which already owned or controlled over 800 various other fast food franchise locations, for an undisclosed amount. An affiliate of Sun Holdings, Taco Supremo, assumed Taco Bueno&#x27;s outstanding debt and supplied $10 million in working capital to reorganize and revitalize the business. On January 15, 2019, Taco Bueno emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In mid-June 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the chain opened its first Houston-area location in Katy.

<doc id="1344309" wikidata="Q6135424" url="?curid=1344309" title="James Hamet Dunn">
<text>Sir James Hamet Dunn, 1st Baronet (29 October 1874 – 1 January 1956) was a Canadian financier and industrialist during the first half of the 20th century. He is recognized chiefly for his 1935 rescue and subsequent 20-year presidency and proprietorship of Algoma Steel.

==Early life==
Dunn was born in the village of St. Peter&#x27;s, now amalgamated into Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada. His father owned a shipbuilding company whose fortunes had been all but wiped out by the sharp decline in the demand for wooden ships, and died when he fell into the harbour when James was an infant. His widowed mother, who was a particularly devout member of St. Luke&#x27;s Presbyterian church, raised him on her meager earnings as a telegraph clerk. The bereft family also had help from the Fergusons, owners of a large farm, where his mother exchanged household duties for room and board. In his posthumous biography, boyhood and lifelong friend Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook remarks on Dunn&#x27;s exposure to the Shorter Catechism and the creed of John Knox through his mother&#x27;s devotion. Specifically, Beaverbrook mentions the responses to Questions 74 and 75 (which explicitly command that wealth be acquired only by lawful means) as formative influences on the young Dunn.

From childhood, James Dunn was a voracious reader with an excellent memory. After completing his schooling, he left home to find employment and for a time he worked as a deckhand for an American shipping company on Lake Michigan. After this, he made his way to the east coast where he was employed by a manufacturing company in Lynn, Massachusetts. However, before long he returned home took a job as a clerk at the law firm of George Gilbert, where he worked alongside Richard Bedford Bennett, led him to the decision to apply to Dalhousie University Law School in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The small amount of money he had been able to save was not nearly enough to cover his education costs and Dunn worked at a variety of part-time jobs to pay his way through university, including a position in the university library. He graduated in 1898, then worked as a lawyer in Halifax before setting up a law practice in Edmonton, Alberta. Within a short time, Dunn was drawn to the booming economy of Montreal, Quebec where he landed a position with one of the city&#x27;s prominent law firms.

==The stockbroker==
James Dunn became involved in the legal aspects for underwriting activities for companies being listed on the Montreal Stock Exchange and in 1902 he established the J.H. Dunn &amp; Co. stock brokerage company. With $20,000.00 borrowed from his father-in-law, he acquired a seat on the stock exchange. Canadian business at the time was still heavily dependent on investment money from the British financial markets and Dunn became an expert at raising foreign capital for the underwriting of securities as well as selecting the right places to invest. Articulate, outspoken, and with a personality that commanded respect, Dunn had already made contacts with a number of influential people, including a number of railroad executives, one of the most powerful group of entrepreneurs of the day.

As a stockbroker, Dunn&#x27;s company put together a stock issue for William Van Horne, the former president of Canadian Pacific Railway. Van Horne had invested in the Cuba Railroad Company and wanted to raise capital for his &quot;Havana Electric Company&quot; venture. Already a close friend of fellow New Brunswickers, Max Aitken (the future Lord Beaverbrook) and a bright young lawyer named Richard Bennett, Dunn&#x27;s brokerage work led to even more business connections with some of the elite of corporate Canada, including George Alexander Drummond, Henry Pellatt and the up-and-coming Izaak Walton Killam. As well, he would become a friend and admirer of the very successful American engineer-turned-entrepreneur, Frederick Stark Pearson.

However, the London financial markets were the centre of the economic universe and encouraged by Pearson, in 1905 James Dunn made the decision to take up residency in London. There he ran a new merchant bank in partnership with the Swiss investment dealer, C.L. Fischer, all the while working in conjunction with his Montreal brokerage.

At a time of rapid development in mechanized industry, as a result of large hydro-electric projects, shrewd investments, underwritings and stock promotions, James Dunn was soon a wealthy man. Dunn&#x27;s brokerage house underwrote Pearson&#x27;s ventures and sufficient capital was raised to allow Pearson to create a massive business empire that included the São Paulo Tramway, Light and Power Company in Brazil, the Mexico North Western Railway, the Mexican Tramway Company, and the Mexican Light and Power Company in Mexico, the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company and the British American Nickel Company (BANCo) in Canada.

All was not easy and as a director of the Sovereign Bank in Canada that fell victim to the stock market crash of 1907, he experienced severe financial difficulties. Added to this, mismanagement kept hidden by the officers running his Montreal brokerage house, one of whom committed suicide when his discrepancies were revealed, caused Dunn more financial grief. In 1913, his partner Fischer disappeared and went to ground leaving him with monstrous debts, as their firm was a partnership, not a limited liability vehicle, but he managed courageously and with help from his creditors to cover them all. Nine years later, Dunn forgave Fischer when the latter was &quot;in virtual destitution&quot;, even to the point of giving him a job.

Because of a crucial need for nickel steel during the early years of First World War, the BANCo was expropriated by the British government and they delegated Dunn to reorganize it. In the process of that task, Dunn obtained the North American rights for the Hybinette process, which uses an electrolytic process to refine nickel. Dunn was instrumental in building the refinery at Deschenes, Quebec, across the river from Ottawa. BANCo had purchased the shares of the Dominion Nickel-Copper Company in 1913; its forerunner had been organized in 1907 by the Booth and O&#x27;Brien interests in the Sudbury Basin. It was they that projected the underground workings of the Murray Mine, but none of their projects reached completion until the advent of BANCo. In 1917 ground was broken in Copper Cliff for a BANCo smelter, and on 17 January 1920 the furnace turned out its first matte. BANCo was liquidated in July 1924 because of post-war competition from Inco and the Mond Nickel Company. 

At the height of the Great War in 1915, his associate Pearson was killed when the Germans sank the RMS Lusitania. Despite these setbacks, he would quickly recoup and go on to become a multi-millionaire. It is reported that Dunn partnered with the Belgian financier Alfred Loewenstein in several business ventures, the duo emerging with more than £1,000,000 profit from their 1920s investment in British Celanese alone.

Dunn&#x27;s close friendship with Max Aitken continued after the wealthy New Brunswicker also chose to live in England. Still very much in touch with his roots, after a 1911 fire destroyed the bells of Christ Church Cathedral in Fredericton, James Dunn donated the replacements for the original 1849 five-ton bells. The First World War provided him with a number of business opportunities and to the ability to serve Britain. For his World War I efforts, he was created a baronet in the 1921 New Year Honours.
During his lifetime Dunn became a major industry leader rivaling even the Rothschilds as a central figure in British finance. Although he lived primarily in England during his stockbroking years and maintained a villa in France, Dunn frequently traveled to Canada to spend time at his fishing camp on the Nigadoo River not far from his birthplace.

==Algoma Steel==
A number of Sir James Dunn&#x27;s Canadian investments were in Northern Ontario mining ventures and he began a business relationship with Algoma Steel, a company in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Founded by Francis Clergue, Algoma Steel had been taken over by Philadelphia, Pennsylvania investors after its 1903 bankruptcy. Overly dependent on the production of rail tracks, the steel company suffered through numerous problems and in 1908 Dunn had partnered with a British group of investors who included Robert Fleming to cooperate with an American consortium to form the Lake Superior Investment Co. to acquire Algoma Steel. Although Dunn&#x27;s role at the time was important, he was still only a minority player and the American investors had control.

Algoma Steel went through years of ups and downs, marked by a lack of strong leadership, and in 1935 the company was again forced into receivership, and with it went the city: a plaintive cry for help from the mayor to Dunn details the ordeal. This time, at the age of 61, Dunn engineered a takeover so that he became the sole controlling shareholder thereby allowing him to take the tough but necessary reorganization measures to restore profitability to the steel maker. To accomplish this, he raised capital by negotiating bank loans, selling his beloved art collection and taking stock instead of income. As Algoma Steel&#x27;s president and chairman of its board of directors, he successfully turned it into one of the largest steel mills of the day and for more than twenty years guided the fortunes of the company he would eventually make into one of the most profitable producers in Canada.

However, all was not sweetness and light for the first several years of his presidency: for example, in July 1937, the Bank of Montreal called in its loans—in a repetition of events that had destroyed Algoma under Clergue in 1907—but Morris W. Wilson of the Royal Bank stepped in to save the day. As Minister for Aircraft Production in wartime Britain, Beaverbrook would appoint Wilson in 1940 to manage his North American ministry.

Dunn&#x27;s intestinal fortitude is responsible for his claim to at least two significant innovations in the industry. Hematite ore was the foundation of the steel industry in 1935, and it was indeed exploited by Algoma. Next to a hematite deposit owned by Algoma was a mountain more than 1,000 feet high but it contained a low-grade ore called siderite. The experts unanimously declared that Dunn, who wanted to exploit this mountain of siderite, was mad. Nowhere else in the world was an ore of this grade in commercial use. In the early months of 1939, a pilot process seemed to indicate success, but in order to be ascertained it would require full production. Dunn carried the investment through to the end and a positive result was his reward. The next innovation which Dunn developed into production at Algoma was then known as the &quot;Sink-Float process&quot;. The need for innovation was due to the exhaustion of ore supplies at the Helen mine. The process, which had been established at Broken Hill Proprietary by Guillaume Daniel Delprat at the turn of the century because of a similar exhaustion, had been tried once or twice in the US but on ore quite different from that at the Victoria. No Canadian mines had developed this technique; no large-scale equipment was available for experimentation and so the pilot plant would be uncertain and expensive. The gamble was a success, and Dunn pioneered again. The Victoria mine was able for a time from 1945 to supplant the Helen mine, while the latter changed from an open-pit to, in 1949, an underground operation.

During the Second World War, the company benefited from the huge demand for steel by the military; however, financial calls from his associates, who needed or wanted to liquidate positions as a result of the French collapse, bedeviled Dunn, who retained in the end his Algoma shares and nothing else. Even then, he mortgaged them to his stockbroker friends. The benefit from a subsidized price for sinter, granted at the corporate nadir of 1935 by the provincial government of Mitchell Hepburn, was cancelled in 1942 by the Conant government. At times Dunn&#x27;s relationship with the federal government minister in charge of the war effort, C. D. Howe was difficult; Beaverbrook relates a story in which he had to calm Winston Churchill because Howe or Mackenzie King, in the dark days of October 1940, had shredded Dunn&#x27;s reputation. Howe threatened Dunn on 26 October 1940 with effective expropriation under the War Measures Act and the National Resources Mobilization Act: the government might obtain control of &quot;trading, exportation, importation, production and manufacture&quot; works, and require him &quot;to place [himself], [his] services and [his] property at the disposal of His Majesty in right of Canada, as may be deemed necessary or expedient for securing the public safety, the defence of Canada, the maintenance of public order, or the efficient prosecution of the war, or for maintaining supplies or services essential to the life of the community.&quot; A letter to Churchill from Beaverbrook, who at the time was in the former&#x27;s Ministry, was enough to secure the person and property of Dunn, but his health suffered ill effects, as presently will be related. The week after Dunn had a major surgery, Howe struck again. This time, Howe telephoned on 12 April 1943 to Wilson at the Royal Bank: if Howe&#x27;s steel experts (likely the same experts Dunn had wrongfooted in the siderite development) were right, either Dunn must stand down from his Chairmanship of Algoma, or he would be forced to expropriate. Many precedents had accumulated over three years, both in the UK and Canada. But Wilson and his Royal Bank stood firm and refused to countenance this extreme. Wilson instead asked for disclosure of the government file, and Howe&#x27;s bluff was shot. By August 1943, a vice-president at Algoma was removed and the way forward was clear.

Dunn and Howe later became friends, and Howe even acquired a summer manor next door to the Dunn estate, &quot;Dayspring&quot;, at the seaside resort of St. Andrews in New Brunswick. Howe even served as an Executor of Dunn&#x27;s estate.

It was during the war that Dunn had two major health crises brought on by old age. These required hospital stays of 17 days and five weeks respectively. He and Christoforides, who throughout was by his side day and night, succeeded by artful means in keeping both stays from the press. Shortly after the end of the first bout with adversity, he married her.

==Canada Steamship Lines==

In 1944, Dunn was invited to serve on the board of directors of Canada Steamship Lines (CSL), whose ore carriers were an important transporter of ore and coal for the Algoma Steel plant which operated under a geographical disadvantage to its more southerly competitors. Unhappy over CSL&#x27;s policy of prioritizing service to his steel mill&#x27;s competition on the lower section of the Great Lakes, with backing from a Winnipeg, Manitoba businessman plus the Montreal publishing magnate, John Wilson McConnell, James Dunn quietly set about buying up shares of the shipping line. He secured a line of credit from the Bank of Montreal and through Earle McLaughlin at the Royal Bank of Canada he raised a war chest that saw him gain effective control of Canada Steamship Lines in 1951. This was followed up by the acquisition of another shipping line with cargo vessels capable of cost-effective delivery of Algoma Steel&#x27;s products to the southern markets. Within a few years, Dunn was exporting iron ore from his Algoma Ore Properties Limited to American buyers.

==Art collection==

Sir James Dunn had been an avid art collector for many years. He was introduced to this pastime by van Horne in 1908, and purchased three paintings by Goya before 1911, and a Velazquez by 1912. Dunn was pained when forced by the Fischer debacle to liquidate his art collection in 1914. The transaction included 13 paintings and included Holbein, Bronzino, Manet and El Greco.

Dunn commissioned seventeen portraits of participants at the Versailles Conference by Sir William Orpen, amongst whom were Woodrow Wilson and George Barnes. At the height of the depression, commissioned another dozen, this time of his friends like Lord Greenwood, Lord Castlerosse and Lord Beaverbrook, by a down-on-his-luck Sickert.

In the late 1940s, he and Christofor, Lady Dunn, developed a friendship with Salvador Dalí. The artist went on to paint the portraits of the couple (Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation)(Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation) which are now on permanent display at the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton, New Brunswick along with one of Dalí&#x27;s greatest pieces, the &quot;&quot;Santiago el Grande&quot;.&quot; As well, the art gallery received other works of art that the Dunns collected including a 1650 painting by Jakob van Loo titled &quot;&quot;A Gentleman&quot; and the Augustus John picture, &quot;Dorelia&quot;&quot; as well as John&#x27;s portrait of Sir James Dunn.

==Personal==
In 1901, James Dunn was married to Gertrude Paterson Price, the daughter of a prosperous Quebec City lumber dealer. They had five children before divorcing in 1926:
#Mona Dunn (–1928). Widely described as &#x27;the most beautiful girl in England&#x27; she became at 17 when he met her in Paris in 1919 the mistress of Lord Birkenhead, who was then Lord Chancellor in the Coalition Cabinet of David Lloyd George. She married in 1925 Edmund Tattersall, a war hero of the 5th Dragoon Guards with whom she had in May 1927 a daughter, Monica. Her portrait by William Orpen hangs in the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, and may be viewed on their web-site. Her early death on 19 December 1928 from peritonitis was a crushing blow to her father. It became the subject of an occasional poem by Shane Leslie, which was published by the Ashendene Press.
#Sir Philip Gordon Dunn, 2nd Baronet Dunn (1905–1976), who was father of two daughters: the author Nell Dunn, and Serena Dunn, later Lady Rothschild.
#Kathleen Mabel Dunn (1907–1969) - she married in 1947 Colonel Sir Robert Philip Wyndham Adeane, O.B.E. (1905–79), kt., of Babraham Hall.
#Joan Molesworth Dunn (1908–1982) who married 1928 (and was divorced 1 November 1929 by) Hubert Duggan, an MP, and stepson of Lord Curzon. Upon her divorce she lost custody of an infant child born on 5 August 1929. She next married her lover Anthony Jenkinson, who subsequently committed suicide in October 1935. She married last in 1943, Charles Dutton, 7th Baron Sherborne.
#Brigid Leila Dunn (1919–1991)

Following the divorce from his first wife in 1926, Sir James Dunn married Irene Clarice Richards, the former wife of Francis Archibald Kelhead Douglas, 11th Marquess of Queensberry. The 1928 death of his daughter Mona Dunn from his first marriage sent him into a state of depression and for a time he thought about cutting back on his business activities and returning home to his native New Brunswick. However, in 1929, his new wife gave birth to a daughter, Anne, who lifted his spirits a great deal. Anne Dunn grew up to be an artist, studying under Henry Moore and in Paris, France with Fernand Léger and at the Académie Julian. Nevertheless, Dunn and his second wife divorced in 1942 following which he married his long-time personal secretary, Marcia Anastasia Christoforides. Thirty-six years his junior, &quot;Christofor&quot; as she was nicknamed, was very bright, intensely loyal, and a devoted partner. James Dunn would seek her input on most every business matter for the rest of his life.

Although a workaholic, enjoyed luxury and maintained an active social life. He was one of the first businessman to acquire a Douglas DC-3 as a private business aircraft, in which he traveled frequently between his homes in Europe and Canada. He kept a vast wine cellar from the vineyards of France and frequented New York City, especially Broadway where he was a friend of television host Ed Sullivan.

It was for his service in the Great War that Dunn was knighted in the 1921 New Year&#x27;s List of Honours. Dunn functioned as a sort of emissary for two Prime Ministers. He first responded when Asquith asked him (and members of the Asquith family) in the autumn of 1914 to write a report on the Army hospital service behind the lines in France. Next, he negotiated with Jacob Borreson an agreement that all of the nickel mined by the Kristiansand Nickel Company of Norway would be sent to Canada for smelting and refining. The British government obtained a virtual blockade on the supply of nickel to Germany, which was forced to purchase nickel from afar (with all the risk entailed by a distant supply) at inflated &quot;spot&quot; prices. Lloyd George requested a situation report from Dunn on the disrupted supply of foodstuffs from Norway, Sweden and Denmark; Dunn&#x27;s plans for increasing the supply were sound and worked admirably in practice.

In 1949, Dunn was made a King&#x27;s Counsel in Quebec by Maurice Duplessis. He was a made a member of the bar in five provinces. On 15 August 1950, he was made a Freeman of the City of Bathurst, and in November 1954 the same honour was bestowed by St. Andrews, New Brunswick. The University of New Brunswick, Dalhousie University, St. Francis Xavier University, Laval University and Queen&#x27;s University all granted him honorary degrees. Sault Sainte Marie awarded him the Freedom of the City.

In January 1956 at the age of 81, after a heart ailment of less than a week Dunn died at his home in St. Andrews, New Brunswick. In commemoration of his birthday, in the same year, Lady Dunn privately published &quot;The Ballad of a Bathurst Boy: 1874-1956,&quot; a celebration of her late husband&#x27;s life in verse. Printed by the University of New Brunswick Press in Fredericton, NB, it was sent to friends and family of Dunn. His widow sold the 10,000 acre camp he had acquired near his birthplace the next year. One source places this parcel on Dunn Road near Allardville, New Brunswick.

Lord Beaverbrook (Max Aitken) published in 1961 a detailed biography of his late friend, titled &quot;Courage: The Story of Sir James Dunn&quot;. The most complete telling of Dunn&#x27;s life and business career is available in Duncan McDowall&#x27;s, &quot;Steel at the Sault: Francis H. Clergue, Sir James Dunn and the Algoma Steel Corporation 1901-1956&quot; (Toronto:University of Toronto Press, hb 1984 &amp; pb 1988).

At the time of his death, Dunn was president of Algoma Ore Properties Ltd, Cannelton Coal and Coke Company, Fiborn Limestone Company, and Canadian Furnace Company.

==Legacy==

As a result of the very substantial taxes on the estate left by Sir James Dunn and Nova Scotia&#x27;s Izaak Walton Killam who had died the year before in 1955, the government of Canada was able to create and provide an endowment for the Canada Council for the Arts. Dunn also left a very significant estate to his last wife who fulfilled his wishes and made numerous contributions to charitable, cultural, and educational works.

Perhaps Dunn&#x27;s most significant legacy was the discovery of a productive ore near Bathurst, which was exploited by as many as 700 men for half a century from 1953: One of the annual scholarships, that were provided by Dunn in 1947 to the University of New Brunswick, was awarded to a Master&#x27;s student by the name of A.B. Baldwin, who discovered the ore as his thesis work and thus &quot;greatly enlarged the bounds of provincial prosperity&quot;. In fact, Dunn had specified in the deed that the scholarship was to be awarded for only New Brunswick geological work; Baldwin, who was originally interested in samples from Quebec&#x27;s North Shore, was led by the Dunn gift to examine ore from New Brunswick.

As used here, the James Hamet Dunn legacy includes not only the bequests of his estate, but also significant charitable gifts that he made during his lifetime, and may no longer exist. Two examples from his hometown suffice to demonstrate his essence:
*The &quot;James Hamet Dunn Hospital&quot; in West Bathurst, New Brunswick was consumed by flames in February 1953 after more than forty years&#x27; existence. The hospital initiated in northern New Brunswick a school for nurses.
*In May 1931, the &quot;Our Lady of Lourdes of the Lady Dunn Institution&quot; sanatorium for the care of tuberculosis patients was opened north of Bathurst. It was managed by the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph, and later demolished to become the state-financed Chaleur Regional Hospital.

A number of foundations, buildings and academic Chairs bear (or bore) his name including:
*the &quot;Sir James Dunn Jubilee Scholarship&quot; at Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax, Nova Scotia;
*the &quot;Sir James Dunn Wildlife Research Fund&quot; of the University of New Brunswick;
*the &quot;Sir James Dunn Residence&quot; at the University of New Brunswick, Saint John campus
*at Saint Thomas University, Fredericton, New Brunswick:
**the &quot;Sir James Dunn Hall&quot; and
**the &quot;Sir James Dunn Student Lounge&quot;
* at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia:
** a chair in Law;
**the &quot;Sir James Dunn Law Library&quot;,
**the &quot;Sir James Dunn Building&quot; for Physics &amp; Atmospheric Science, and
**the &quot;Sir James Dunn Theatre&quot; at the Arts Center;
* at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick:
**the &quot;Sir James Dunn Chair in Geology&quot; and
**the &quot;Sir James Dunn Building&quot; for the computer science, mathematics and physics departments;
*the &quot;Sir James Dunn Animal Welfare Centre&quot; at the University of Prince Edward Island;
* at Queen&#x27;s University:
**a Chair in mining.
In addition, Sir James Dunn has been honoured with numerous buildings and institutions bearing his name such as:
*The &quot;Sir James Dunn Academy&quot;, a high school in St. Andrews, New Brunswick funded after his death by his last wife;
*The &quot;Sir James Dunn Collegiate and Vocational School&quot; in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario;
*The &quot;Sir James Dunn&quot;, a bulk carrier ship (Hull #109) launched in 1951, for Canada Steamship Lines;
*The &quot;Sir James Dunn Public School&quot; in Wawa, Ontario, once Algoma&#x27;s source for iron ore;
* the &quot;Lady Dunn Hospital&quot; in Michipicoten (now Wawa, Ontario);
*The &quot;Sir James Dunn Highland Guard of Honor&quot; the only highland cadet guard in the Canadian Cadet Movement, attached to 333 RCACS Fredericton NB.

Sir James was a member of the committee that built and opened London&#x27;s first public golf courses in Richmond Park, which were opened in 1923 and 1925.

<text>Gabriel Sagard, OMR (&quot;fl.&quot; 1614–1636) was a French lay brother and member of the Recollects, a reform branch of the Order of Friars Minor known for its strict poverty. He was among the first Christian missionaries to New France, and is notable for his writings on the colony and on the Hurons (or Wendat).

Sagard&#x27;s origins, and the dates of his birth and death are obscure. Some historians say he was christened Théodat, others believe that Théodat was his religious name, which, however, is less likely as his signature on his works is under the name of Gabriel (see illustration).

Sagard arrived in New France 28 June 1623. He was sent to accompany Father Nicholas Viel, where they joined four other members of their Order who had been there since 1615, led by Father Denis Jamet. In August, Sagard traveled to a Huron village on the southern shore of Lake Huron, where he began his missionary work and study of the Huron language. In July 1624, he was ordered by his superiors to return to France. All record of him ends some time around 1636. Sagard seems to have either left the Order or he may simply have died while still a friar. Sagard worked with the Hurons.

Sagard is remembered for his writings on New France and the Hurons-Wyandot people, &#x27; (Paris, 1632). His&#x27; (1636) included a revised and expanded &#x27; and&#x27; (Dictionary of the Huron Language). An English translation of &quot;&quot; by historian George M. Wrong was published by the Champlain Society in 1939 as &quot;Sagard&#x27;s long journey to the country of the Hurons&quot;. It is available online at the Champlain Society website. An authoritative edition of the dictionary of the Huron language was edited by John Steckley and published in 2009.

In 2022, environmental historians Jennifer Bonnell and Sean Kheraf cited Gabriel Sagard – and specifically his description of giving a French domestic cat, which was exotic and non-indigenous creature North America, to his Indigenous Wendat hosts in 1632. They suggested that Sagard&#x27;s gift functioned as both a &quot;tool of diplomacy&quot; and a &quot;creature of empire&quot; and that it also &quot;illustrate[d] the methodological challenges at the heart of the [growing] field of animal history.&quot;

The geographic township of Sagard in Quebec, Canada, was named in his honour.

<doc id="1344322" wikidata="Q6376171" url="?curid=1344322" title="Katharine Coman">
<text>Katharine Ellis Coman (November 23, 1857 – January 11, 1915) was an American social activist and professor. She was based at the women-only Wellesley College, Massachusetts, where she created new courses in political economy, in line with her personal belief in social change. As dean, she established a new department of economics and sociology.

Among other admired works, Coman wrote &quot;The Industrial History of the United States&quot; and &quot;Economic Beginnings of the Far West: How We Won the Land Beyond the Mississippi&quot;. She was the first female statistics professor in the US, the only woman co-founder of the American Economics Association, and author of the first paper published in &quot;The American Economic Review&quot;. A believer in trades unionism, social insurance and the settlement movement, Coman travelled widely to conduct her research, and took her students on field trips to factories and tenements. She shared a home with poet Katharine Lee Bates.

== Early life ==
Coman was born in 1857 to Martha Ann Seymour Coman (1826–1911) and Levi Parsons Coman (1826–1889) in Newark, Ohio. Her mother had graduated from an Ohio female seminary, and her father had been educated at Hamilton College, and thus Coman received much of her early education at home. She attended the University of Michigan for two years, left college to teach in Ottawa, Illinois for two years, and then returned to university. She earned a Bachelor of Philosophy (PhB) degree in 1880, one of only a handful of women to do so. She was influenced by the work of John Stuart Mill, which is evident in her later work as economist and historian. Coman attended lectures about socialism while traveling in London. Later in her career, she was influenced by Alfred Marshall (1890), Francis Amasa Walker (1883), and social Darwinism. While at the University of Michigan, Coman studied under Professors Charles Kendall Adams of the German Historical School; James Burrill Angell, then president of the university; and Henry Carter Adams, a renowned statistician.

== Wellesley College ==

After earning her PhB, she joined the faculty at Wellesley College, a newly established private college for women in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Angell recommended her for the position, noting her talent for teaching. She first taught English rhetoric, and in 1881 became an instructor in history. In 1883, she was promoted to full professor of history. Because Coman believed that economics could address social problems, she urged the Wellesley administration to offer courses on the subject, and in 1883, she taught the college&#x27;s first political economy class. Coman was the first American woman to teach statistics and Wellesley became the only American women&#x27;s college to offer statistics courses before 1900.

Coman developed and taught several new courses in economics, history, and rhetoric, including Statistical Study of Economic Problems, Industrial History of the United States, and Conservation of Our Natural Resources, all framed by sociological insights related to social justice. To teach students about the practicality of applying economic theory to real world economic and social problems, Coman escorted her students on field trips to Boston&#x27;s tenement houses, labor union meetings, factories, and sweatshops. In 1885, at the age of 28, she became professor of history and economics. That same year, she turned down the offer of a position as dean of women at the University of Michigan, stating that she preferred to remain at Wellesley and continue teaching. She was acting dean from 1899 to 1900, during which time she established a new department of economics and sociology, becoming its head in 1900.

According to historian Melinda Ponder, Coman was a popular teacher. Two of her students, Helen Frances Page Bates and Helen Laura Sumner Woodbury, were among the first American women to earn PhDs in economics. Woodbury is recognized as an important historian of labor and a noted economist, while Helen Bates became a noted social worker.

She retired from full-time teaching at Wellesley in 1913, becoming professor emeritus. In writing about the farewell dinner held in her honor, the &quot;New York Times&quot; said: &quot;Miss Coman has been so closely associated with the history and development of Wellesley for so long a time that her loss is felt very deeply by the whole college.&quot; Coman continued to research and write until her death in 1915.

Coman&#x27;s papers are held by the Wellesley College Archives. In 1921, the college established the Katharine Coman Professorship of Industrial History to honor her service.

== Notable works ==
Coman and Elizabeth Kendall coauthored the 1902 book &quot;A Short History of England for School Use&quot; based on research that Coman conducted in England between 1886 and 1894. Coman published &quot;The Industrial History of the United States&quot; in 1910, the first industrial history of the United States. It was reprinted nine times before 1915. Her 1911 article, &quot;Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation,&quot; was the first article published in the newly formed journal &quot;The American Economic Review&quot;.

Her 1912 work &quot;Economic Beginnings of the Far West: How We Won the Land Beyond the Mississippi&quot; was considered by contemporaneous scholars to be her magnum opus, and &quot;one of the most important fruits of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.&quot; The book outlined the economic history of the American West. 

In this work, Coman describes the historical economic processes that led to the Far West coming under the control of settlers. She found that settlers were more economically successful than explorers, traders, trappers, and indigenous peoples because the settlers built permanent settlements, reproduced at a higher rate, and established networks of collaboration.

Settlement movement activist Jane Addams, a close friend, urged Coman to research social insurance programs in Europe in order to establish similar programs in the United States. Coman studied social insurance in England, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden, but poor health prevented her from continuing her research. Her manuscript, &quot;Unemployment Insurance: A Summary of European Systems&quot; was published after her death in 1915.

== Social activism ==
Coman was passionate about social and economic issues, especially women&#x27;s education, poverty, immigration, and labor. Throughout her life, she was active in social reform movements, especially the labor movement and the settlement movement. She served as the president of the electoral board and chair of the standing committee of the National College Settlements Association in 1900. Coman organized a group of immigrant women who worked in Boston sweatshops, naming the group an &quot;Evening Club for Tailoresses,&quot; and attempted to found a tailor shop that could have been an alternative to sweatshops. She assisted in organizing the 1910 Chicago garment workers&#x27; strike, which involved 40,000 factory workers. Coman also worked with the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League. Working with her economist and sociologist friend Emily Greene Balch and other women, Coman co-founded Denison House in 1892, a college women&#x27;s settlement house located in Boston, serving as its first chair. Denison House provided a center for Boston&#x27;s labor activists, and is thought to be the first settlement house on the East Coast.

== Personal life ==

For 25 years, Coman lived in a &quot;Boston marriage&quot; with Wellesley professor and poet Katharine Lee Bates, the author of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;. Such partnerships were so common among Wellesley faculty that they were called &quot;Wellesley marriages&quot;. Coman and Bates shared a house they named &quot;the Scarab&quot; with Bates&#x27; mother, Cornelia, and her sister, Jeannie. The women reportedly enjoyed life together as family. Coman frequently traveled for her research on economic history; she visited Europe, the American West, Scandinavia, and Egypt. Bates accompanied her on many of these trips. Some scholars believe the two women were a lesbian couple.

== Breast cancer and death ==
Coman first discovered a lump in her left breast in the fall of 1911 and underwent two surgeries in the following months. At the time, medical doctors did not understand the nature of breast cancer, its causes or its treatments, so the prognosis for Coman was poor. Coman died at home in January 1915 at the age of 58. At the time of her death, Coman had been working on an industrial history of New England.

During Coman&#x27;s illness, friends of her and Bates — many of them also in &quot;Wellesley marriages&quot; — took Coman out for walks and visits, and invited her to stay at their country homes. They prepared meals for Coman and Bates, brought flowers and fresh vegetables, and performed tasks and services to keep Coman&#x27;s spirits up. Bates chronicled Coman&#x27;s illness in her diary, noting hospital visits, surgical procedures, and details about Coman&#x27;s pain and suffering. According to cancer historian Ellen Leopold, in the days after Coman&#x27;s death, Bates wrote a memorial to her that was designed to be circulated privately among the women&#x27;s close friends and family. Leopold believes that the book, &quot;For Katharine Coman&#x27;s Family and Innermost Circle of Friends&quot;, is the first breast cancer narrative in American literature. Near the end of Coman&#x27;s life, the two women exchanged loving farewells through reciting poems and psalms to each other. Several years after Coman&#x27;s death, Bates continued to mourn and to recall Coman&#x27;s suffering. In 1922, Bates published a book of poems about Coman&#x27;s illness, &quot;Yellow Clover: A Book of Remembrance&quot;. The book&#x27;s title emerged from the fact that the &quot;two Katharines,&quot; as the women were known, would send each other sprigs of yellow clover as tokens of affection.

== Assessment ==
A review of Coman&#x27;s book &quot;Economic Beginnings of the Far West: How We Won the Land Beyond the Mississippi&quot; (1912) in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; stated that &quot;the author is one of those new women who have shown what may be accomplished in the way of research by method and industry and a great deal of enthusiasm.&quot; In a 1913 review of her book, economist Thomas Nixon Carver praised Coman&#x27;s narrative style and lively prose. Also writing in 1913, economist Frederic Paxson criticized the book, arguing that there were factual errors and inaccurate citations, and that the data for the book were already widely available in university research libraries. Paxson does credit Coman with having prepared an extensive bibliography and for providing extensive notes. The two-volume book is today hailed as a classic and was reprinted twice; Macmillan in 1925, and Kelly in 1969. The University of Michigan &quot;Naming Project&quot; notes that she was one of the first historians to use local newspaper articles and government documents as primary sources in her teaching and writing.

Gerald F. Vaughn, a contemporary economist writing in 2004, proposes that Coman was America&#x27;s first female institutional economist. Vaughn notes other important facts about Coman that frame her as a pioneer for women academics, including the fact that at the time, the discipline and profession of economics was dominated by men. She was the only woman among the group of economists who founded the American Economic Association in 1885 and she was the first American woman to become a statistics professor. Vaughn notes that her contributions to economics and social history went beyond being the &quot;first woman,&quot; for example writing the first article to be published in &quot;The American Economic Review&quot; and authoring the first industrial history of the US. Coman&#x27;s extensive work on the processes of institutional change in the American West made her an influential industrial historian and &quot;The Industrial History of the United States&quot; was widely used as a textbook for decades.

In 2011, &quot;The American Economic Review&quot; commemorated its first hundred years by publishing a list of the top twenty articles in the journal&#x27;s history. Coman&#x27;s 1911 article &quot;Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation,&quot; published in 1911, was the first article published by the journal and was reprinted in the 2011 issue. The article analyzed water rights, access, and availability. Also in this issue of &quot;The American Economic Review&quot;, economist Gary D. Libecap noted that Coman&#x27;s work continued to be relevant, particularly for scholars interested in the economics of climate change. Elinor Ostrom, an American political economist, believes that Coman&#x27;s article continues to provide &quot;insight into the problems of collective action related to irrigation in the American West.&quot;

<text>Naimur Rahman Durjoy (born 19 September 1974) is a Bangladeshi politician and retired cricketer. He is the former Jatiya Sangsad member from the Manikganj-1 constituency representing the Bangladesh Awami League party.

Durjoy served as the first captain of Bangladesh national cricket team. At international level, he played 8 Test and 29 ODI matches for the team.

==Cricket career==
A right arm off spinner, Durjoy was a member of Bangladesh&#x27;s 1997 ICC Trophy winning side. He became his country&#x27;s inaugural Test captain when he led Bangladesh on their Test debut, against India in 2000. Durjoy took 6 wickets for 132 runs in India&#x27;s first innings, including the wickets of legendary cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly. However, a loss of form saw him lose the captaincy the following year and also his spot in the side.

After his retirement in 2002, Durjoy became the president of the Cricketers&#x27; Welfare Association of Bangladesh.

==Political career==
On 26 November 2023, Awami League announced the final list of its 298 candidates to contest the 2024 national election which did not include Durjoy.

On 3 September 2024, almost a month after the fall of the Awami League government, Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission decided to launch an investigation into corruption allegations against Durjoy accusing him of money laundering, irregularities in projects, and illegally amassing wealth. The day after, on 4 September, he resigned from the board of the directors of Bangladesh Cricket Board.

==Personal life==
Durjoy is married to Farhana Rahman Happy.

<doc id="1344337" wikidata="Q1708743" url="?curid=1344337" title="Joslin Diabetes Center">
<text>Joslin Diabetes Center is the world&#x27;s largest diabetes research center, diabetes clinic, and provider of diabetes education. It is located in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Among the Harvard Medical School affiliated institutions, Joslin is unique in its sole focus on diabetes. Joslin has the world&#x27;s largest team of board-certified physicians treating diabetes and its complications, as well as the largest staff of Certified Diabetes Educators anywhere in the world. Joslin also supports the world&#x27;s largest diabetes research team with more than 40 faculty investigators and more than 300 researchers.

Roberta Herman, M.D., is currently Joslin&#x27;s President and CEO.

==History==
Joslin has helped revolutionize the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diabetes, most notably by improving the survival rate of babies born to women with diabetes, developing sight-saving laser surgery, devising treatments to reduce amputation, and uncovering ways to predict who will develop diabetes. It was named after Elliott P. Joslin, an American doctor and pioneer in the study of diabetes.

Some notable historic milestones include:
* 1949: Priscilla White, M.D., a founding member of Joslin Clinic, introduces the White Classification of Diabetic Pregnancies. This pioneering concept classifies patients according to their level of risk and tailors their treatment protocol accordingly. When Dr. Priscilla White joined Joslin&#x27;s practice in 1924, only 56 percent of babies born to diabetic mothers survived; 50 years later when she retired, that rate had jumped to more than 90 percent.
* 1967: A laser treatment (Ruby laser photocoagulation) is developed by William Beetham, M.D., and Lloyd M. Aiello, M.D., which within the next five years revolutionizes the care of diabetic retinopathy, a potentially blinding complication of diabetes.
* 1976: Joslin researchers perfect the A1C test, paving the way for this blood test to assess blood glucose control over a two- to three-month period.
* 1980s: Basic research at Joslin shows that type 1 diabetes evolves over a period of years, presenting hope that a means may be found to prevent autoimmune destruction of the pancreas’ beta cells before they stop producing insulin.
* 1980s: C. Ronald Kahn and his team defines the molecular mechanism of insulin action and how it is altered in insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes and obesity.
* 1989: George King, M.D., and colleagues demonstrate that high blood glucose levels activate protein kinase C (PKC), part of a major signaling pathway that causes cellular changes in the eye, kidney and arteries that lead to diabetic complications.
* 1996: A molecular pathway (called NF-κB) is identified in fat and the liver that is activated by obesity (and a fatty diet) and causes the insulin resistance that can lead to type 2 diabetes (Steven E. Shoelson, M.D., Ph.D.).
* 1998: Joslin Vision Network—a telemedicine technology developed at Joslin—found to produce images of the retina just as accurately as standard equipment, but without having to dilate the pupil. Remote sites across the United States can now access Joslin&#x27;s expertise in diabetic eye disease diagnosis and treatment.
* 2002: The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study shows people with elevated blood glucose levels who are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes can reduce their risk by 58 percent through sustained modest weight loss and increased moderate-intensity exercise, such as walking 30 minutes daily.
* 2003: Researchers discover that early signs of kidney disease (microalbuminuria) can be reversed back to normal with proper medical screening and diabetes control.
* 2006: Joslin researchers find that specific genes can determine both obesity and body-fat distribution in humans.
* 2009: Researchers in the lab of C. Ronald Kahn discover that brown fat is present in some adults, providing a new target for the treatment of obesity.

==Clinical Services==

Some of the clinical programs at Joslin include:

Beetham Eye Institute: The Beetham uses advanced diagnostics, laser treatment, cataract and retinal surgery, vision rehabilitation, and novel therapies to help preserve the eyesight of diabetic patients.

Adult Clinic Care Joslin has a reputation for pioneering care and support of pediatric patients with diabetes and their families. The pediatric staff includes board-certified endocrinologists, pediatric diabetes nurse educators, pediatric nutritionists, child psychologists, a social worker, and a child life specialist.

Pediatric Clinic Care Joslin has a reputation for pioneering care and support of pediatric patients with diabetes and their families. The pediatric staff includes board-certified endocrinologists, pediatric diabetes nurse educators, pediatric nutritionists, child psychologists, a social worker, and a child life specialist.

Multicultural Health Clinics: In response to the fact that Latinos and Asian Americans develop diabetes at a much higher rate, Joslin established clinics for these patient populations. They offer culturally sensitive care and bilingual staff.

Patient EducationJoslin has the largest staff of Certified Diabetes Educators anywhere in the world. Specialists work with patients one-on-one, or through a variety of programs and classes. Educators work as part of the diabetes care team to provide coordinated, sequenced learning activities.

Nephrology Section: Joslin provides the educational, medical, and emotional support needed to manage all forms of kidney disease, which impacts a significant number of people with diabetes. The goal is to detect, delay, and potentially reverse the effects of diabetes on the kidneys as early as possible.

Joslin also offers specialty programs in cardiovascular disease, mental health and counseling services, peripheral neuropathy, obesity, insulin pump therapy, diabetes and pregnancy, diabetes and aging, hypoglycemia, sexual function and disorders of the feet.

Joslin has a number of initiatives aimed at developing and providing culturally-competent diabetes education, such as the Latino Diabetes Initiative and the Asian American Diabetes Initiative.

==Research==
Many important improvements in diabetes care were developed at Joslin. These include recognition that tight blood glucose control can slow or prevent diabetes complications, creation of treatment protocols to enable women with diabetes to have healthy babies, the identification of markers for pre-diabetes, and pioneering laser surgery for diabetic eye disease. Joslin researchers have won awards and recognition from the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, and the American Diabetes Association, among many others.

<text>Pro-Pain is an American heavy metal band based in New York City, formed in 1991 by vocalist and bassist Gary Meskil and drummer Dan Richardson, both former members of Crumbsuckers. 

== History ==
Their debut album &quot;Foul Taste of Freedom&quot; was released in 1992, displaying hardcore punk and rap metal influences, after which the band was signed to Roadrunner Records, who reissued the album the following year. Their second album &quot;The Truth Hurts&quot; was initially banned due to the sleeve artwork, featuring a picture of a stitched-up woman after an autopsy.

The band has released several more albums with a varying line-up over the years, with Meskil being the only constant member. The self-produced album &quot;Act of God&quot; saw the band signed to Nuclear Blast Records after they had relocated to Sarasota, Florida. The same label released &quot;Round 6&quot; in 2000 and the live album &quot;Road Rage&quot; in 2001. In 2004, they released their first album for Candlelight Records, &quot;Fistful of Hate&quot;. Tom Klimchuck left the band in 2011 due to &quot;unexpected circumstances regarding some potentially serious health issues.&quot; He had since been replaced by Adam Phillips of Indorphine, who stayed until 2019 when current guitarist Greg Discenza replaced him. On 3 July 2017, Gary Meskil was the victim of a robbery and attempted murder in Belgium while on tour with Pro-Pain in support of their 2015 album &quot;Voice of Rebellion&quot;. Pro-Pain remains active as of 2022, and they are currently working on their follow-up to &quot;Voice of Rebellion&quot;.

<doc id="1344346" wikidata="Q1320224" url="?curid=1344346" title="Osaka Exchange">
<text>, renamed from , is the largest derivatives exchange in Japan, in terms of amount of business handled. 

, the Osaka Securities Exchange had 477 listed companies with a combined market capitalization of $212 billion. The Nikkei 225 Futures, introduced at the Osaka Securities Exchange in 1988, is now an internationally recognized futures index. In contrast to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which mainly deals in spot trading, the Osaka Securities Exchange&#x27;s strength is in derivative products. The OSE is the leading Derivatives Exchange in Japan and it was the largest futures market in the world in 1990 and 1991. According to statistics from 2003, the Osaka Securities Exchange handled 59% of the stock price index futures market in Japan, and almost 100% of trading in the options market. Osaka Securities Exchange Co., which listed on its Hercules market for startups in April 2004 is the only Japanese securities exchange which went public on its own market.

==History==

The birthplace for futures transactions: Dōjima Rice Exchange ( 
The origin of securities exchanges stems from the Edo period, when an exchange for rice and crops was established in Osaka, which at the time was the economic center of Japan. Each prefecture set up its own warehouses in Osaka for shipping &amp; preservation of their rice (to be taxed by the government), and sold to merchants. One of the most famous merchants was &quot;Yodoya&quot;, which was based in the southern part of the Yodoyabashi area. Some other merchants gradually gathered to create one market. This market was called &quot;Yodoya-Komeichi&quot;, and was the first securities exchange in the nation.

Later on, this market was moved to Dōjima in 1697. The so-called &quot;Dōjimakomekaisho&quot;, was a physical market that traded in rice-tickets or physical rice. In 1716, Cho-gomai transactions were introduced and recognized by the government in 1730 — this is said to be the origin of futures transactions in Japan.

In July 2006 OSE launched their newest futures contract the Nikkei 225 mini, which is one tenth of the size of the original Nikkei 225 Futures contract and highly popular among Japanese individual investors. 

In September 2007 OSE established evening session for Stock Index Futures and Options.The trading hours is from 16:30 to 19:00 (JST (7:30-10:00 in UTC). In July 2012 a planned merger with the Tokyo Stock Exchange was approved by the Japan Fair Trade Commission. Today, despite its name, trading for Osaka Stock Exchange takes place in Tokyo.

<doc id="1344358" wikidata="Q554543" url="?curid=1344358" title="Georgi Kinkladze">
<text>Georgi Kinkladze (, ; born 6 July 1973), also spelled Georgiou, or Giorgi, or shortened to Gio, is a Georgian former footballer who played as a playmaking midfielder.

Born in the Georgian capital Tbilisi, his first professional club was Mretebi Tbilisi. In Georgia he won three league titles and two cups with Dinamo Tbilisi, and was named national player of the year twice. He first came to international prominence with his performances for the Georgian national team against Wales in 1994 and 1995.

Kinkladze transferred from Dinamo Tbilisi to English Premier League club Manchester City in 1995, where his dribbling ability and spectacular goals made him a cult hero, winning the club&#x27;s Player of the Year award in two consecutive seasons. Kinkladze stayed with Manchester City despite relegation to the Football League First Division in 1996, but the club continued to decline, and after a second relegation in 1998 he joined Dutch champions Ajax. With his national team, he won the Malta International Football Tournament 1998.

Kinkladze was unable to settle in the Netherlands, and returned to England with Derby County a little over a year later. He spent four years at Derby, making nearly 100 appearances. After leaving Derby in 2003, he became a journeyman footballer, having unsuccessful trials at several clubs before joining Cypriot club Anorthosis in 2004, where he won a league championship medal. He finished his playing career with Russian club Rubin Kazan in 2006.

==Early life==
Georgi Kinkladze was born on 6 July 1973 in Tbilisi, Georgia, which was then part of the Soviet Union. As a child, he lived in the Didube district of the city with his father, Robinzon (an engineer), his mother Khatuna (a teacher) and his elder sister. Robinzon was keen to see his son succeed as a footballer, sometimes making him walk around the family home on his knees to strengthen his legs, and enrolled him for Dinamo Tbilisi&#x27;s junior side when he was six years old. Khatuna disapproved of some of her husband&#x27;s methods, instead taking Georgi to lessons in &quot;mtiuluri&quot;, a traditional Georgian ballet. Over the next few years, Kinkladze played in Dinamo Tbilisi&#x27;s youth teams, progressing as far as the reserve team, where he played alongside Shota Arveladze, who would later become his teammate at both senior and international level.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
When Georgian football formed leagues independent of Soviet competition in 1989, a family friend arranged for Kinkladze to move to Mretebi Tbilisi, the first openly professional club in the Soviet Union. Mretebi Tbilisi were a smaller club playing at a lower level, but the move gave Kinkladze the opportunity to play first team football instead of playing for Dinamo&#x27;s second team. Kinkladze made his professional debut aged 16, and immediately became a first team regular. In 1991 Kinkladze&#x27;s Mretebi won the Pirveli Liga, and won promotion to the highest division following a play-off.

After a season in the top flight with Mretebi, Kinkladze was signed by Dinamo Tbilisi, the team he represented as a youth, for one million roubles. In September 1992, shortly after signing for Dinamo, Kinkladze made his senior international debut, aged 19. The match, against Azerbaijan, was the Georgian national side&#x27;s fourth since breaking from the Soviet Union in 1991. Kinkladze&#x27;s youth-level teammate Shota Arveladze also played in the match, and Kinkladze provided an assist for a goal by Arveladze.

In Kinkladze&#x27;s first season at the club, Dinamo won a league and cup double. However, due to the ongoing Georgian Civil War, during 1993 the Dinamo Tbilisi management sought to put their players in a more stable environment. As part of this, Kinkladze was sent on loan to 1. FC Saarbrücken in Germany. Kinkladze made his Saarbrücken debut in a 2. Bundesliga match against Tennis Borussia Berlin, a 2–2 draw on 4 March 1994. He was unable to settle into the side at Saarbrücken, rarely playing a full 90 minutes, and was sent off in a 1–3 defeat to Hertha Berlin. At the end of the season, Kinkladze returned to Tbilisi to resume his career in Georgia, where he was named the national Player of the Year for 1993. Dinamo president Merab Jordania was still uncomfortable with Kinkladze playing in Georgia amid political instability, and offered the player to Atlético Madrid for approximately £200,000; they gave him a trial, but no contract. He then trained with Real Madrid&#x27;s reserves, where he caught the eye of Boca Juniors scouts, who took him to Argentina for a month&#x27;s loan. Kinkladze met his childhood hero Diego Maradona, but did not gain a permanent contract, as manager Silvio Marzolini regarded him as too similar to Boca&#x27;s Argentine international playmaker Alberto Márcico.

In September 1994, Kinkladze was part of the Georgian team that played Moldova in Tbilisi. Italian clubs became interested in Kinkladze after seeing footage of his performance, and the Italian press nicknamed Kinkladze the &quot;Rivera of the Black Sea&quot;, but no concrete attempts to sign him took place. It was not until Manchester City chairman Francis Lee saw the recording that negotiations for a permanent move abroad occurred. Enthused by Kinkladze&#x27;s display, Lee contacted Jordania, securing an agreement that Manchester City would have first refusal should Dinamo wish to sell the player.

Two months later, Kinkladze scored his first international goal as Georgia defeated Wales 5–0. Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall later said of the game &quot;They murdered us... [Kinkladze] was different class and the best player on the pitch by a mile.&quot; When the teams met again at Cardiff Arms Park, scouts from several clubs saw Kinkladze score the only goal of the game with a 20-yard (18 m) chip over Southall. In his last season with Dinamo, the team once again won the double. Kinkladze had scored 14 goals in 21 appearances, and clubs from several countries expressed interest in signing him. Jordania kept true to his agreement with Lee, and on 15 July 1995, Kinkladze signed for Manchester City. The fee was generally reported as £2 million. After initial difficulties obtaining a work permit, Kinkladze made his debut for Manchester City against Tottenham Hotspur in a 1–1 draw on 19 August 1995.

===Manchester City===
Manchester City&#x27;s form was poor during the 1995–96 season. The team failed to win a single league game in the first three months of the season, but Kinkladze quickly became a popular figure. Kinkladze&#x27;s first goal for the club occurred in a 1–0 win against Aston Villa, following a one-two with Niall Quinn. Kinkladze was initially homesick, as he was living in a hotel and spoke little English. In an effort to resolve his homesickness, his mother moved to Manchester to provide him with familiar food. By the time Manchester City travelled to Middlesbrough on 9 December 1995, press and supporters regarded Kinkladze as the star player of the Manchester City side. The match against Middlesbrough was billed as a contest between Kinkladze and the Brazilian playmaker Juninho. Kinkladze scored the opening goal with a solo effort, but the match ended 4–1 to Middlesbrough. However, the Middlesbrough fans subsequently voted Kinkladze the &quot;Best Opposing Player of the Season&quot;. On 16 March 1996, Kinkladze scored a particularly spectacular goal in a 2–1 win against Southampton. Kinkladze beat five players before the ball over Southampton goalkeeper Dave Beasant. The goal won BBC programme Match of the Day&#x27;s &quot;Goal of the Month&quot;, and placed second in the programme&#x27;s &quot;Goal of the Season&quot; competition.

On the final day of the season, Manchester City were relegated to the First Division, prompting transfer speculation linking Kinkladze to a number of clubs including Barcelona, Internazionale, Liverpool, and Celtic. However, he opted to stay at Manchester City, where he had been named Player of the Year for 1995–96. The 1996–97 season proved a turbulent one for Manchester City, and over the course of the season, Kinkladze played for five different managers. With Keith Curle no longer at the club, Kinkladze became the main penalty taker, and also scored a number of goals from free-kicks, including a 35-yard (32 m) effort against Swindon Town described by English newspaper &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; as &quot;like a missile&quot;. In the First Division, Kinkladze frequently had two or even three opposing players assigned to man mark him. Several teams chose to combat Kinkladze&#x27;s playmaking skill with robust tackles; in one such match on 11 January 1997, against Crystal Palace, Kinkladze had to be stretchered off following a challenge by David Hopkin. Manchester City finished the season well below the promotion places, and again, there was speculation that Kinkladze would leave the club. At the final match of the season on 3 May 1997, a 3–2 win against Reading, Manchester City supporters campaigned to keep Kinkladze at the club, even though he was not playing in the match, due to injury. The campaign even extended to the half-time advertisements on the scoreboard, the &quot;adverts&quot; being messages from supporter groups who had paid to display them. Kinkladze was named Player of the Year for the second consecutive season, and one month after the season ended, he announced his intention to stay at the club by signing a new three-year contract. Kinkladze used the proceeds from his new contract to buy a Ferrari, though the car caused consternation among club officials. Their fears were realised on 29 October 1997, when Kinkladze lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a motorway bridge in Hale. Kinkladze received back injuries requiring 30 stitches, and missed two matches as a result.

Manchester City&#x27;s downward trajectory toward the Second Division continued in the 1997–98 season, and on 17 February 1998, manager Frank Clark was sacked. His replacement, Joe Royle, was appointed City manager on 18 February 1998. He had a reputation for playing defensive midfielders, which led to his Everton team being nicknamed the &quot;Dogs of War&quot;. Royle viewed Kinkladze as an unaffordable luxury in a relegation battle, and in his first board meeting as Manchester City manager, he opened proceedings with the words &quot;We have to sell Kinkladze&quot;. After playing the first two games under Royle, a 1–2 loss on 18 February against Ipswich Town, and a 3–1 win against Swindon Town on 23 February, Kinkladze sustained an ankle injury, which sidelined him for a month. He made his return at Port Vale on 14 March, despite having taken little part in training in the preceding week. Port Vale were a team with a physically robust approach, and used the muddy conditions to their advantage. Kinkladze was played out of position on the right wing, much to his displeasure, and gave a performance that the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; summarised as &quot;barely noticeable&quot;. Vale defeated City 2–1, and Royle severely criticised Kinkladze for a lack of effort, dropping him for the next six games. In 2005, Royle explained his view of Kinkladze in his autobiography: &quot;To the supporters he was the only positive in all that time. To me, he was a big negative. I am not saying that City&#x27;s ills were all down to Kinkladze, but there was too much about the whole Kinkladze cult phenomenon that wasn&#x27;t right ...too often since his arrival, the team had under-performed. I couldn&#x27;t help deducing that contrary to popular opinion, he would be my weak link not my strong one.&quot; With two games remaining, Manchester City were in the relegation places, and Kinkladze was restored to the starting lineup for the home match against Queens Park Rangers (QPR). The QPR team contained Vinnie Jones, who had a violent reputation and played using the axiom &quot;if their top geezer gets sorted out early doors, you win&quot;. Jones tried to apply his philosophy to Kinkladze, even targeting him in the tunnel before the start of the match. Kinkladze opened the scoring with a free kick, but City could not maintain their lead. Defending described by &quot;The Observer&quot;&#x27;s reporter as a &quot;calamity&quot; culminated in an unusual own goal from Jamie Pollock, and meant the match ended in a 2–2 draw. City were relegated for the second time in three seasons despite a final day 5–2 win against Stoke City. In total, Kinkladze made 119 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 22 goals. He played regular international football during this period of his career, including in a 0–0 draw with three-time World Cup winners Italy.

===Ajax===
Following transfer negotiations which had been ongoing in the final months of the season, Kinkladze left Manchester City for Dutch club Ajax for £5 million. The move brought a reunion with Shota Arveladze, with whom he shared a house in Amsterdam. However, Kinkladze&#x27;s spell at Ajax proved unsuccessful. He was originally signed as a replacement for Jari Litmanen, but Litmanen stayed at Ajax as his proposed move to Barcelona fell through. As a result, Kinkladze played in an unfamiliar left-wing position. His league debut for Ajax came in a 2–0 win against Willem II on 23 August 1998, but he made few starts. To compound matters, manager Morten Olsen was sacked early in the season, and a disagreement with replacement Jan Wouters resulted in Kinkladze losing his place in the team. &quot;I could have been Maradona and he wouldn&#x27;t have changed the system to accommodate me&quot;, Kinkladze recalled later. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t playing football and that made my life hell.&quot; He immediately started to look elsewhere. Several English top-flight clubs showed interest in signing him, but were discouraged by work permit issues. His lack of regular playing time also resulted in him losing his place in the Georgian national team. Having failed to established himself in the first team and struggling with a succession of injuries, he made just 12 appearances for Ajax in his first season.

Kinkladze was not issued a squad number for his second season, and was made to train with the reserve team. In September 1999, Kinkladze held transfer talks with Sheffield United, but no move materialised. Two months later, a return to England was secured in the form of a loan move to Derby County.

===Derby County===

As Kinkladze was not playing regular international football when he signed for Derby, he was not automatically entitled to a work permit, but a review panel gave him special dispensation, due to his previous contribution to English football. He made his debut on 28 November 1999, coming on as a substitute for Avi Nimni in a 1–2 loss against Arsenal, the first of 14 loan appearances. He scored his first Derby goal on 4 March 2000 in a 4–0 win against Wimbledon. At the end of the season, the loan move was made permanent. The transfer fee of £3 million set a club record that stood until 2007.

Kinkladze missed the start of the 2000–01 season due to a hernia operation, to the disappointment of Smith, who expected him to become a leading figure at the club. He returned to the side as a substitute against Middlesbrough on 6 September 2000. With Derby 3–0 down, Kinkladze and Malcolm Christie were introduced in a double substitution. The pair then proved influential as Derby came back to draw the match 3–3. During the next four months, Kinkladze was sometimes a starter and sometimes a substitute, rotating with Stefano Eranio, until a groin injury sustained in the return match with Middlesbrough kept Kinkladze out for two months. Over the season, Kinkladze &quot;showed little of the brilliance he was bought in to deliver&quot; and was named Derby&#x27;s biggest disappointment of the season by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. The match against Leeds United on 23 September 2000 was a rare success for him. He came on as a substitute with 17 minutes remaining and levelled the game 1–1 with a solo goal two minutes later, jinking between two defenders before curling a left-foot shot beyond the goalkeeper. Derby struggled for most of the season, but avoided relegation. Kinkladze stayed at the club, since his injuries and inability to prove himself led to a lack of serious offers. Around this time, he married Louise Tai, a . Louise then became a member of the Orthodox Church and was christened in Tbilisi, receiving a new name – Mariam. Their first child, Saba, was born in October 2001.

For Kinkladze, the start of the 2001–02 season followed a similar pattern to the previous season, comprising a mixture of starts and substitute appearances. Jim Smith resigned from his managerial position at Derby on 7 October 2001, leaving Kinkladze, a Smith favourite, bitterly disappointed. The appointment of new manager Colin Todd signalled a change in the club&#x27;s playing style. Todd did not favour flair players, and Kinkladze made only a single substitute appearance in Todd&#x27;s first two months in charge. Frustrated by a lack of opportunities, Kinkladze took the unusual step of using his lawyer to arrange a meeting with Todd to discuss his exclusion from the first team. Todd reacted by telling Kinkladze he could leave the club if he was unhappy. According to Kinkladze&#x27;s agent, Manchester City, as well as Spanish clubs Valencia, Mallorca and Málaga, were all interested in signing Kinkladze. However, Todd was sacked on 14 January 2002 with Derby second from bottom of the Premier League, and John Gregory was appointed as manager on 30 January 2002. Kinkladze stayed at the club, playing regular first team football in the remainder of the season, but Derby continued to struggle, and Kinkladze endured relegation for the third time in his career. The club, who were £35 million in debt, started an end-of-season clear-out to reduce their annual £17 million wage bill. Derby&#x27;s actions included off-loading of some of the highest earners, and the manager informed Kinkladze that he had no future at the club. However, Kinkladze, whose contract ended in summer 2003, was reluctant to leave the club and turned down a move to Turkish champions Galatasaray.

As the club continued its attempts to terminate Kinkladze&#x27;s contract, he trained with the reserve team up to 29 September 2002, missing Derby&#x27;s first five matches of the 2002–03 season. He was brought back to the first team following two defeats, introduced as a substitute after an hour&#x27;s stalemate against Stoke City on 31 August. His introduction proved crucial in turning the game into a 2–0 win for Derby, as he took part in the build-up of both goals. He then missed a number of matches through injuries, featuring in around half of Derby&#x27;s games in the remainder of 2002. In October 2002, Georgian national team manager Aleksandr Chivadze unexpectedly omitted Kinkladze and captain Georgi Nemsadze from the team for their match against Russia, causing a stir in Georgia. Kinkladze, surprised and disappointed, said: &quot;When I was out of form, he constantly phoned me, asked me about my play and called me to the team. Now I&#x27;m fit, scoring goals, but he didn&#x27;t call me and even didn&#x27;t phone.&quot; Both Kinkladze and Nemsadze returned to the starting line-up for the next European Championship qualifying match on against Ireland. By January, because of the financial crisis at Derby, Kinkladze had not been paid for more than three months. He intended to quit, but although his agent admitted interest from German side Hamburg and a second enquiry from Galatasaray, no move transpired and he remained at the club. He played for Derby more often in the second half of the season, and his form resulted in him being named the supporters Player of the Year. Derby finished the season in the bottom half of the table, and needed to reduce costs for the next season as their Premier League parachute payments had ended. As a result, Derby offered Kinkladze a one-year contract, but on a wage one third of that of his previous contract. Kinkladze decided to turn down this contract extension proposal, desiring a move to a more successful club with a chance of winning trophies. To this end, he held talks with Liverpool in May 2003. As contract negotiations with Derby did not reach a positive conclusion, Kinkladze left the club.

Without a club during pre-season, Kinkladze trained with Portsmouth, where his former manager Jim Smith was on the managing staff. He played for Portsmouth in one pre-season friendly, but Portsmouth decided instead to sign another former Manchester City playmaker, Eyal Berkovic. Over the next few months, he was linked with moves to Scottish clubs Dundee and Celtic but none resulted in a contract offer.

He also joined Leeds United on trial, playing for the reserve team to earn a permanent contract, however after he reportedly turned up late to training sessions, then manager Eddie Gray ended Kinkladze&#x27;s trial spell.

As a consequence, he had to train individually and lost his place in the national team again, this time before the return match against Russia. In December 2003, Kinkladze went for a one-week trial at Panathinaikos, following an invitation from Giannis Vardinogiannis, the owner of the Greek club. However, at the end of the trial, the club decided not to sign him. Six months later, he was linked with a move to Russian club Shinnik Yaroslavl, but again, he was not offered a contract.

===Anorthosis===
Kinkladze&#x27;s year and a half spell without a club came to an end in October 2004. Kinkladze&#x27;s former international teammate Temuri Ketsbaia was player-manager at financially troubled Cypriot team Anorthosis. Ketsbaia gave his old friend a chance to rebuild his career, offering him a contract to play for Anorthosis. He made his debut against title contenders APOEL on 21 November and marked it with a fine goal. He scored once more in a 5–0 home victory against Olympiakos Nicosia, and in February he was recalled to Georgia&#x27;s squad for the friendly against Lithuania. His contract was initially only for one season, but the club extended it for another year. Anorthosis ended the season successfully by winning the Cypriot championship and earned a place in the qualifying rounds of 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, where, thanks to the club&#x27;s good run, Kinkladze played five times. He started both legs of a 2–1 first round aggregate win against Dinamo Minsk, was twice a substitute in a 3–2 second round aggregate win against Süper Lig runners-up Trabzonspor, and played the full 90 minutes in a 1–2 third round home defeat against Rangers. His display against Rangers caught the attention of Rubin Kazan’s manager Gurban Berdiýew, who invited him to join the Russian club. On 22 August 2005, Kinkladze played his last game for Anorthosis against Omonia in the Cypriot Super Cup and two days later, on the day of the second leg of the tie against Rangers, he left to close a deal with Rubin. Ketsbaia said regarding the departure: &quot;I don&#x27;t want players who have no wish to play for Anorthosis. As far as I&#x27;m concerned the Kinkladze chapter is now closed.&quot;

===Rubin Kazan===
Anorthosis and Rubin reached an agreement on 26 August. Kinkladze signed a contract until the end of the season, becoming the most decorated Georgian footballer to play in the Russian Premier League. He made his debut for Rubin the next day, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–2 defeat against FC Rostov. On a personal level the debut was a successful one; his corner kick was headed into the net by Vitalijs Astafjevs for Rubin&#x27;s goal. He had less remarkable performances in the next two games and was substituted both times. This did not affect Berdyev&#x27;s faith in him, and at a post-match press conference he defended Kinkladze: &quot;He needs time. He is an experienced player who, I think, will help the team.&quot; The next game for Rubin was a 5–1 away win against low-ranked Terek Grozny, and Kinkladze made a considerable contribution to it, scoring two goals and making two assists. Against Tom Tomsk, he was less successful. Kinkladze missed a late penalty, denying Rubin a vital victory. After the match Berdyev claimed he made a mistake in his choice of penalty taker.

Despite his misgivings Berdyev kept Kinkladze in the team, where he was used as one of three offensive midfielders in a 4–2–3–1 formation. Kinkladze, with his technical style and inclination for improvisation, brought more variety to the attacking play of the team, in contrast to the restrained style of play that Berdyev favoured. He provided an assist in four consecutive matches. The most important of these was against Zenit St. Petersburg, in a match that decided a place in the following year&#x27;s UEFA Cup. Subsequently, he received a recall to the Georgian national squad for friendlies against Bulgaria and Jordan. However, a muscle strain meant he missed both national team games and Rubin&#x27;s final league match. He ended the 2005 season with seven assists and two goals in nine appearances for Rubin.

Rubin delayed in offering Kinkladze a contract extension, leading Anorthosis to make an attempt to re-sign him early in the pre-season, but Kinkladze rejected the offer as he wished to stay at Rubin. By late December, Rubin expressed a desire to retain him but contract talks were delayed due to family reasons, and it took until mid-January for a new one-year contract to be agreed.

During his successful 2005 season, 32-year-old Kinkladze said he hoped to play on well into his thirties. The 2006 season, however, was his last. He sustained an injury in Rubin&#x27;s first competitive match, a 1–0 cup match defeat against Shinnik which proved to be the last time he played a full match. A recurrence of an old injury meant he was sidelined for longer than expected, only making his return to full training in late May. Kinkladze continued to struggle to maintain fitness, making five further appearances for Rubin, two of which were starts. A match against Rostov on 20 August 2006 was the last of Kinkladze&#x27;s playing career. In September, he was called to the Georgia national team but did not play or appear on the substitutes&#x27; bench. A short time later he had to undergo another course of medical treatment. He also passed a thorough medical examination, the results of which were reported as the deciding factor for his future at the club. In October, he was an unused substitute just once; he and his compatriots were the subject of criticism from Rubin&#x27;s general director who announced to the press &quot;there are questions about the Georgians in the team regarding their training and attitude to football&quot;. In November, Kinkladze again suffered an injury and missed the remainder of the season.

After a disappointing year for Kinkladze, Rubin decided not to renew his contract. In January 2007, he held talks with his previous club, Anorthosis, but the transfer never materialised. In an interview in August 2007 Kinkladze&#x27;s former international teammate Malkhaz Asatiani confirmed that Kinkladze had finished his career and settled in Moscow. Kinkladze later worked as a sports agent, and in August 2011 returned to his former club Anorthosis, where he was employed as sports director until an amicable departure in June 2012.

Kinkladze participated in Rangers Weekend of Legends II on 26 March 2023

==Style of play==
Kinkladze&#x27;s position was as a playmaking midfielder, typically playing further forward than the rest of the midfield. The main aim of the role is to create goalscoring chances, suiting a creative player like Kinkladze. Dribbling ability was generally viewed as one of Kinkladze&#x27;s strongest attributes, and his jinking runs with the ball resulted in some spectacular goals, most notably his &quot;Goal of the Month&quot; against Southampton. Set piece ability was another of Kinkladze&#x27;s strengths; he regularly took corners and free kicks. He also took penalties; seven of his Manchester City goals were scored from the spot, though he stopped taking penalties for the club following two consecutive misses in the 1997–98 season. Two of his nine goals for Georgia were also penalties.

Weaker points of Kinkladze&#x27;s game were those related to defending. He was not noted for tackling, which sometimes caused frustration for his managers; Colin Todd remarked wistfully in 2001 that &quot;Georgi has to understand that there is an art to tackling&quot;. Unwillingness to tackle and accusations of a lack of effort were also the source of Joe Royle&#x27;s omission of Kinkladze from his Manchester City side.

On occasions, Kinkladze played as a second striker, a role with less positional responsibility. Periods when Kinkladze was used in this way included Frank Clark&#x27;s first months as Manchester City manager, and alongside Fabrizio Ravanelli at Derby County. Though a left-footed player, he did not perform well when played as a left winger, and publicly expressed his distaste for playing in the position.

Over the course of his career he was Georgian Player of the Year twice, won the Club Player of the Year three times at English clubs, and has been described by a Russian football history as the brightest Georgian talent of the 1990s. In 2005, he placed third in a BBC poll to find Manchester City&#x27;s all-time &quot;cult hero&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Decatur was a demonstration conducted from October 26 to October 29, 1864, as part of the Franklin-Nashville Campaign of the American Civil War. Union forces of 3–5,000 men under Brigadier-General Robert S. Granger prevented the 39,000 men of the Confederate Army of Tennessee under General John B. Hood from crossing the Tennessee River at Decatur, Alabama.

==Background==
General John B. Hood was marching through northern Alabama on his way to an invasion of Union-held Tennessee. His army had departed northwest from the vicinity of Atlanta, Georgia, in late September 1864, hoping their destruction of Union supply lines would lure Major-General William T. Sherman&#x27;s Union army into battle. Sherman pursued Hood as far as Gaylesville, Alabama, but decided to return his army to Atlanta and instead conduct a March to the Sea through Georgia. He gave responsibility for the defense of Tennessee to Thomas at Nashville.

Hood departed from Gadsden, Alabama, on October 22, en route to Guntersville, Alabama, where he planned to cross the Tennessee River. However, he later learned from cavalry Brigadier-General Phillip Roddey that crossing place was strongly guarded, while Decatur, forty miles west, was said to be &quot;lightly guarded&quot;. Concerned over the possibility of Federal gunboats destroying any pontoon bridge he might deploy, along with the absence of Forrest&#x27;s horsemen to bring him intelligence, Hood changed his course to Decatur.

==Battle==

When Hood arrived at Decatur on October 26, he found a Federal infantry force of 3,000 to 5,000 men defending an entrenched line that included two forts and 1,600 yards of rifle pits; a much heavier force than Roddey had believed. Two Federal gunboats patrolled the river. General George Thomas, in Nashville, sent supplies and reinforcements to Decatur along with orders to &quot;defend Decatur to the last extremity.&quot; On October 27, Hood arranged his army as it arrived to encircle Decatur. Meanwhile, the Union continued to pour reinforcements into Decatur which arrived just in time to fill gaps in the wavering Union lines. The next morning, he sent Confederate skirmishers through a dense fog to a ravine within 800 yards of the main fortifications. At about noon, a Federal regiment drove the skirmishers out of the ravine, capturing 125 men. &quot;With the soldiers hungry and supplies scarce&quot;, Hood knew he could not afford the casualties from a full-scale assault and decided to cross the Tennessee River elsewhere. He marched further the west and crossed near Tuscumbia, Alabama, where Muscle Shoals prevented interference by the Federal gunboats.
