<doc id="1311770" wikidata="Q325255" url="?curid=1311770" title="Patrick Bateson">
<text>Sir Paul Patrick Gordon Bateson, (31 March 1938 – 1 August 2017) was an English biologist with interests in ethology and phenotypic plasticity. Bateson was a professor at the University of Cambridge and served as president of the Zoological Society of London from 2004 to 2014.

==Education==
Bateson was educated at Westminster School and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in zoology in 1960 and a PhD for research on animal behaviour supervised by Robert Hinde.

==Career and research==
Bateson was a biologist who specialised in researching the behaviour of animals and how it is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. He was a world authority on imprinting in birds – the process of learning to recognise their parents and members of their own species – and his work led to new principles in behavioural development.

Bateson devised original experiments that showed how characteristics of imprinting depend on the bird&#x27;s early life experiences. Bateson&#x27;s investigation of learning in birds has led to greater understanding of the neural basis of memory. He had an interest in how developmental and behavioural processes influence evolution.

Bateson was concerned with the ethics of using animals in research and the analysis of animal pain and suffering. This led to a study exploring the effects hunting with hounds had on red deer, an inquiry into dog breeding, and a review of the use of animals in research.

Previous academic positions include a Harkness Fellowship at Stanford University and ten years as head of the Cambridge sub-department of Animal Behaviour. Bateson served five years as biological secretary to the Royal Society and fifteen years as provost of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, retiring from both in 2003. He retired from his Cambridge Chair in 2005.

Bateson published on such topics as ethology, animal welfare, behavioral development and evolution.

===Awards and honours===
Bateson was knighted for services to science in the 2003 Birthday Honours list. He received an Honorary Doctor of Science (ScD) degree from the University of St Andrews and an honorary fellowship from Queen Mary University of London.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1983. In 2014 he received the Frink Medal from the Zoological Society of London.

==Personal life==
Patrick Bateson&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s cousin was the geneticist William Bateson. Patrick&#x27;s daughter is Melissa Bateson, also a professor of ethology, at Newcastle University. Patrick Bateson was an atheist. He died on 1 August 2017 at the age of 79.

He was the youngest of three sons born to Margaret (née Irvine), (1920–2015), a classically trained pianist, and Lawrence Peter Fogelberg, (1911–1982), a band director at Woodruff High School in Peoria, at Pekin Community High School in Pekin, Illinois, and at Bradley University in Peoria. Fogelberg&#x27;s mother was a Scottish immigrant and his father was of Swedish descent.

Fogelberg often related his story of his father having allowed him to &quot;conduct&quot; the Bradley University school band at age 14. In 1981, Fogelberg released the song &quot;Leader of the Band&quot;, which was written for and inspired by his father.

Using a Mel Bay course book, Fogelberg taught himself to play a Hawaiian slide guitar that his grandfather had given him. He also learned to play the piano. At age 14, he joined a band, The Clan, which covered The Beatles. His second band was another cover band, The Coachmen, who, in 1967, released a single with both tracks written by Fogelberg, recorded at Golden Voice Recording studio in South Pekin, Illinois, and released on the Ledger Record label: &quot;Maybe Time Will Let Me Forget&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to Lose Her&quot;.

After graduating from Woodruff High School in 1969, Fogelberg studied theater arts and painting at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He began performing as a solo acoustic player at a local coffeehouse, &quot;The Red Herring&quot;, which is where he made his first solo recordings as part of a folk festival in 1971. He was discovered by Irving Azoff, who started his music management career promoting another Champaign-Urbana act, REO Speedwagon. Azoff sent Fogelberg to Nashville, Tennessee, to hone his skills. There he became a session musician and recorded his first album with producer Norbert Putnam. In 1972, Fogelberg released his debut album &quot;Home Free&quot; to a lukewarm response, although it eventually reached platinum status.

He performed as an opening act for Van Morrison in the early 1970s.

==Career==
WZZQ, a radio station in Jackson, Mississippi, gave &quot;Home Free&quot; a lot of airplay and some local promoters secured the City Auditorium in Jackson for a concert. They sold out the show in ten days and when they called Fogelberg&#x27;s agent to let him know the show sold out, he was in disbelief because Fogelberg had been playing in clubs with less than 100 people in attendance, whereas the City Auditorium had 2,500 seats. On February 22, 1974, this show was broadcast and recorded by WZZQ and can be found on YouTube.

Fogelberg&#x27;s second effort was successful – the 1974 Joe Walsh-produced album &quot;Souvenirs&quot;. The song &quot;Part of the Plan&quot; became his first hit. Fogelberg also received contributions from the Eagles throughout the album. He had toured with the Eagles during this time. After &quot;Souvenirs&quot;, he released a string of gold and platinum albums, including &quot;Captured Angel&quot; (1975) and &quot;Nether Lands&quot; (1977).

His 1978 &quot;Twin Sons of Different Mothers&quot; was the first of two collaborations with jazz flutist Tim Weisberg, which found commercial success with songs such as &quot;The Power of Gold&quot;. 

&quot;Phoenix&quot;, from 1979, reached the top 10, with &quot;Longer&quot; becoming a #2 pop hit in 1980 and peaking at number 59 on the UK Singles Chart – his sole entry on that chart. This LP eventually sold two million copies. It was followed by a Top 20 hit &quot;Heart Hotels&quot;. The album also reached number 42 on the UK Albums Chart, likewise his only entry on that chart.

In 1980, Fogelberg appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; with his song &quot;Times Like These&quot;. He performed live on television for the first time.

&quot;The Innocent Age&quot;, released in October 1981, was Fogelberg&#x27;s critical and commercial peak. The double album included four of his biggest hits: &quot;Same Old Lang Syne&quot;, &quot;Hard to Say&quot;, &quot;Leader of the Band&quot;, and &quot;Run for the Roses&quot;. He drew inspiration for &quot;The Innocent Age&quot; from Thomas Wolfe&#x27;s novel &quot;Of Time and the River&quot;. A 1982 greatest hits album contained two new songs, both of which were released as singles: &quot;Missing You&quot; and &quot;Make Love Stay&quot;. In 1984, he released the album &quot;Windows and Walls&quot;, containing the singles &quot;The Language of Love&quot; and &quot;Believe in Me&quot;.

Fogelberg released &quot;High Country Snows&quot; in 1985. Recorded in Nashville, it showcased his and some of the industry&#x27;s best talent in bluegrass. Vince Gill, Ricky Skaggs, Doc Watson, Jerry Douglas, David Grisman, Chris Hillman, and Herb Pedersen contributed to the record. In a world he defined as &quot;life in the fast lane&quot;, Fogelberg described the music as &quot;life in the off-ramp&quot;. In late 1985, he switched gears and took to the road with a group of musician friends, including Joe Vitale, Paul Harris, Tino Gonzales, Jeff Grossberg and Rick Rosas, playing blues in small clubs throughout Colorado as Frankie and the Aliens, covering songs by Cream and Muddy Waters, among others. 1987 heralded a return to rock with &quot;Exiles&quot;, an album that contained &quot;What You&#x27;re Doing&quot;, a throwback to the old Stax Records sound made famous in Memphis during the 1960s. &quot;The Wild Places&quot;, an album whose theme was the preservation of nature, was released in 1990 followed by a tour. His live &quot;Greetings From The West&quot; album, and full-length concert film (with interview segments) of the same name, were released in 1991.

&quot;River of Souls&quot;, released in 1993, was Fogelberg&#x27;s last studio album for Sony Records. In 1997, the box set &quot;Portrait&quot; encompassed his career with four discs, each highlighting a different facet of his music. In 1999, he released a Christmas album, &quot;The First Christmas Morning&quot;, and in 2003, &quot;Full Circle&quot; showcased a return to the folk-influenced 1970s soft rock style of music.

In May 2017, a live album of Fogelberg&#x27;s performance at Carnegie Hall, championed by his wife, sourced from a 1979 tape made by his touring sound company, was released. It peaked at No. 71 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart on June 10, 2017, becoming the first of Fogelberg&#x27;s live albums to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 chart.

== Personal life ==
Fogelberg was married three times: to Maggie Slaymaker from 1982 to 1985, to Anastasia Savage from 1991 to 1996 and to musician Jean Marie Mayer from 2002 until he died in 2007.

From the early 1980s until his cancer diagnosis, Fogelberg lived near Pagosa Springs, Colorado, on a working ranch, which housed a recording studio that he built. He also owned a home in Maine on Deer Isle, overlooking Eggemoggin Reach.

=== Cancer diagnosis and death ===
In May 2004, Fogelberg was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. After undergoing therapy, his cancer went into partial remission. In August 2005, Fogelberg announced the success of his cancer treatments. However, his cancer returned and on December 16, 2007, Fogelberg died at home in Deer Isle, Maine, at the age of 56. Fogelberg was cremated and his ashes were scattered on Eggemoggin Reach (from his song, &quot;The Reach&quot;) off the coast of Maine.

In 2009, Fogelberg&#x27;s widow, Jean Fogelberg, produced &quot;Love in Time&quot;, a collection of 11 previously unpublished songs that Fogelberg had asked her to release after his death. &quot;Love in Time&quot; became the first Dan Fogelberg album to chart since &quot;River of Souls&quot; in 1993, reaching number 117 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 on October 10, 2009.

== Legacy ==
In tribute to Dan and his father Lawrence Fogelberg, Peoria renamed Abington Street in the city&#x27;s East Bluff neighborhood &quot;Fogelberg Parkway&quot;. The street runs along the northeast side of Woodruff High School, Fogelberg&#x27;s alma mater and where his father was a teacher and bandleader. Fogelberg Parkway continues to the intersection of N. Prospect and E. Frye, the location of the convenience store where Fogelberg ran into his high school sweetheart one Christmas Eve – as described in the song &quot;Same Old Lang Syne&quot;. A group of Fogelberg fans created a memorial garden in Riverfront Park in 2010.
In 2017, ten years after the singer&#x27;s death, Jean Fogelberg released &quot;Dan Fogelberg - Live at Carnegie Hall&quot; which immediately became a fan favorite. That same year, she released a CD tribute to Dan&#x27;s work, &quot;A Tribute to Dan Fogelberg&quot;, with performances by his old friend and producer Joe Walsh with Eagles, Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood, Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Jimmy Buffett, Michael McDonald, Randy Owen, Donna Summer, Boz Scaggs, Dobie Gray, the Zac Brown Band, and other artists. Seven years in the making, the tribute CD was co-produced by Jean, with major assistance from Dan Fogelberg&#x27;s friend, producer and arranger Norbert Putnam; Fogelberg&#x27;s longtime friend and manager, Irving Azoff; and Denver music promoter Chuck Morris. In conjunction with the tribute CD, Fogelberg was inducted into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame at its &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot; induction concert at Fiddler&#x27;s Green Amphitheater on Fogelberg&#x27;s birthday, August 13, 2017.

&quot;Part of the Plan&quot; is a musical using the music of Fogelberg. Starring Harley Jay and Kate Morgan Chadwick, it opened on September 8, 2017, at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center (TPAC) in Nashville. Written by Kate Atkinson &amp; Karen Harris of K-Squared Entertainment, the new musical played nineteen performances in TPAC&#x27;s James K. Polk Theatre in September 2017 and swept the 2017 Broadway World Regional Awards with 15 wins including BEST NEW WORK
and BEST MUSICAL.

My Morning Jacket frontman Jim James has cited Fogelberg as a musical favorite and an influence, with &quot;Leader of the Band&quot; being the first single he ever bought. James&#x27; home studio features a Trident Series 80 recording console that formerly belonged to Fogelberg. Garth Brooks has stated that Fogelberg influenced his music. &quot;There are songs that people say are the soundtrack of your life... In college, I would take out my Dan Fogelberg records and would read a passage (of lyrics) from Fogelberg&#x27;s work and go about my day. That was an artist who changed my life, who made me change where I wanted to go and the music I wanted to play and thus, led me here.&quot;

<doc id="1311798" wikidata="Q878748" url="?curid=1311798" title="2005–06 Chilean general election">
<text>General elections were held in Chile on Sunday, 11 December 2005 to elect the president and members of the National Congress. None of the four presidential candidates received an absolute majority, leading to a runoff election between the top two candidates — Michelle Bachelet from the Coalition of Parties for Democracy and Sebastián Piñera from National Renewal — on Sunday, 15 January 2006. Bachelet was victorious with 53.49% of the vote. She succeeded President Ricardo Lagos on 11 March 2006, for a period of four years, after Congress reformed the Constitution in September 2005 and reduced the term from six years.

==Electoral system==
The president was elected using the two-round system. All of the 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies were contested, while 20 out of 38 seats in the Senate were up for election (even-numbered regions and the metropolitan region). Deputies serve for a period of four years, while senators serve for a period of eight years. Reelection is permitted.

A unique binomial system was used for election of Chamber of Deputies. These system rewards coalition slates. Each coalition could run two candidates for each electoral district&#x27;s two Chamber seats. Typically, the two largest coalitions in a district divided the seats, one each, among themselves. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second-place coalition by a margin of more than two-to-one did the winning coalition gain both seats. with seats allocated using the simple quotient.

==Presidential candidates==
===Michelle Bachelet (Socialist Party of Chile)===
Bachelet, who led in every major poll, served as Health Minister before President Lagos named her as Chile&#x27;s first female Defense Minister in 2002. She was supported by the Coalition of Parties for Democracy, which has governed Chile since 1990. The coalition groups four parties: the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), the Party for Democracy (PPD), the Socialist Party (PS), and the Social Democrat Radical Party (PRSD).

Up until May 2005 two candidates vied for the coalition&#x27;s nomination: Soledad Alvear (PDC) and Michelle Bachelet (PS). A primary was scheduled to be held on 31 July 2005, to choose the nominee. Political polls in Chile indicated that either candidate would trounce the right-wing Alliance nominee Joaquín Lavín in a two-person race. The political atmosphere changed, however, when another &quot;Alianza&quot; candidate came to the scene: businessman Sebastián Piñera from the center-right National Renewal. This led, among other reasons, to the withdrawal of Soledad Alvear from the &quot;Concertación&quot; nomination on 24 May 2005.

===Tomás Hirsch (Humanist Party)===
Hirsch, a Humanist, ran as his party&#x27;s nominee for president for 1999 obtaining 0.5%. On this election he ran with the support of the political pact Juntos Podemos Más (&quot;Together We Can Do More&quot;), which is made up mainly of the legally constituted Communist and Humanist parties plus other political groups and social organizations. In previous elections the candidates presented independently by the pact&#x27;s parties were consistently in third place, behind the two major coalitions, and holding poll numbers in the single-digit level.

To elect a single candidate a national public survey was held on 28 May 2005. On 5 June 2005, an assembly elected Humanist Tomás Hirsch as their final candidate. Other pre-candidates included: Julián Alcayaga (Committee for the Defense of Copper) and Nicolás García (Block for Socialism). Two candidates withdrew before the survey and gave their support to Hirsch: Tomás Moulian (Communist) and Manuel Jacques (Christian Left). One candidate withdrew before the assembly: Jorge Pavez (Social Force).

===Joaquín Lavín (Independent Democratic Union)===
Lavín ran as the Alliance&#x27;s nominee for president in 1999, losing in a tight 2000 runoff to Lagos. Considered for a long time prior to the 2005 election as the Alliance&#x27;s unique candidate, as the contest drew nearer, however, his public persona began to lose credibility, perhaps due to a mediocre mayorship of the Santiago municipality the previous years, and his candidacy began to lose steam, to the point that it was called into question. RN, the Alliance&#x27;s other party, decided to compete with Lavín with a candidate of their own (Piñera), breaking up the Alliance&#x27;s unity in the election.

===Sebastián Piñera (National Renewal)===

Piñera was proclaimed a candidate by the National Renewal party on 14 May 2005. His nomination caused discomfort within the Independent Democratic Union (UDI—its fellow coalition party member), as both parties were supposed to support Lavín as the single coalition candidate. A primary proposed by UDI to elect a single candidate representing the Alliance was rejected by RN. Piñera&#x27;s nomination was welcomed by the public and won quick support in opinion polls.

===Rejected candidacy===
The independent Mapuche candidate Aucán Huilcamán registered his nomination on 12 September, but it was rejected three days later by the Electoral Commission (&quot;Servicio Electoral&quot;) due to his failure to obtain the minimum number of signatures required by law for an independent candidacy. Huilcamán appealed using the argument that in the past parliamentary election there was a law created specifically to help the candidates of the Christian Democracy Party re-register their candidacies. After the support given to Huilcamán by other candidates, the government sent a bill to Congress, with immediate discussion, to extend the time of registration; a bill that would have also helped 17 other candidacies that were rejected by the Electoral Service. Nonetheless the bill was rejected by a lack of quorum, denying Huilcamán a possible place in the ballot.

==Parliamentary election==
The Chamber of Deputies prior to this election was composed of 62 CPD deputies (23 Christian Democrats, 20 PPD, ten Socialists, six PRSD and three independents), 57 APC deputies (31 UDI, 18 RN and eight independents) and one independent (off-pact).

The Senate prior to this election was composed of 38 directly elected senators and nine non-elected senators (institutional senators, or senators for life). Among the elected, 20 seats are held by the CPD (eleven Christian Democrats, five Socialists, three PPD and one PRSD) and 18 by the APC (six independents, six UDI and six RN). A constitutional reform in 2005 eliminated non-elected senators starting on 11 March 2006, the day the newly elected senators were sworn in.

Of the Senate seats being contested, eleven were held by the CPD (ten Christian Democrats and one Socialist) and nine by the APC (four independents, three UDI and two RN).

==Campaign==
===Debates===
There were two scheduled debates between the presidential candidates during the first round, both including all four candidates. A third televised debate was dismissed by the respective campaign teams. However, during the second debate, Tomás Hirsch said he was open to a third debate.

The first debate, titled &quot;Foro Presidencial: Chile 2005&quot;, organized by the Latin American station CNN en Español and the local Canal 13, took place on 19 October, at 10 p.m., at Espacio Riesco in Santiago. It ran for one hour, giving each candidate ten minutes to answer seven questions, giving priority to national issues. There was no studio audience. It was hosted by Glenda Umaña (CNN en Español) and Constanza Santa María (Canal 13).
The second debate took place on 16 November at 10 p.m., at the CasaPiedra venue in Santiago. It was organized by Anatel (National Television Association), and was broadcast by Canal 13, TVN, Megavisión and Chilevisión, with TVN in charge of production. Running for one hour and 40 minutes, a question was asked to each candidate by a panel of four journalists. The four candidates were seated behind desks on stage, instead of standing at podiums as they had done in the first debate.

Prior to the second round, Bachelet and Piñera held a televised debate on 4 January 2006, which was organized by Anatel and broadcast by the four main over-the-air television channels. A Time Research poll showed that Bachelet was the winner of the debate with 49%, against 41% for Piñera. On the other hand, another poll, by El Mercurio-Opina, showed that Piñera won the debate with 43.3% of the preferences against 42.9% for Bachelet.

Piñera offered Bachelet to hold a second debate before the election, to discuss regional issues, but this was rejected by Bachelet&#x27;s campaign team. Bachelet also turned down a radio debate with Piñera.

==Opinion polls==


Opinion polls released after Sebastián Piñera&#x27;s entrance and Soledad Alvear&#x27;s withdrawal showed Michelle Bachelet leading the right-wing candidates (Piñera and Joaquín Lavín) by a wide margin, but below the 50% plus 1 vote needed to win the election, a situation that would lead to a runoff in which, according to the same polls, she would comfortably defeat any of the two right-wing candidates. Some analysts commented that in some of these polls Bachelet would indeed have obtained an absolute majority in the first round, if blanks were discarded and undecided votes were evenly distributed among candidates. However, later opinion polls released nearer the election showed a decline of Bachelet in favor of Piñera and Tomás Hirsch, showing more clearly that the election would be decided in a runoff.

The first opinion poll released after the first round, published by El Mercurio-Opina on 18 December, had Bachelet with 42.8%, Piñera with 37.5% and 19.7% undecided. Later opinion polls showed similar results, except for one poll showing Piñera above Bachelet by 1%. The polls released showed on average that Bachelet maintained an advantage over Piñera above 5%, but with a large number of voters (18%) still undecided or that would not declare a preference. If this last percentage was removed from the vote, then Bachelet, the polls showed, would have won the presidency by a margin above 7%, which was accurate with the final results of the election.

==Results==
===President===
The first government announcement regarding election results came at 6:30 p.m. local time (21:30 GMT), and included information from around 12% of polling stations counted. Subsequent preliminary results were announced during the day by the Interior Ministry undersecretary and published on a special Internet site. These results indicated that the election was to be decided in a runoff on 15 January 2006, in which Michelle Bachelet would face Sebastián Piñera. Official and final results, validated by the Electoral Tribunal (Tricel), were published on the &quot;Diario Oficial&quot; (official gazette) on 27 December 2005, and made the runoff election official.

On election day, at 9:30 p.m. local time, before the third preliminary results were announced, Joaquín Lavín conceded a second-place defeat in the election and said he would support Sebastián Piñera in the runoff election. Later in the day, JPM candidate Tomás Hirsch said he would nullify his vote in the upcoming runoff; an opinion which was objected by the pact&#x27;s Communist wing, which said they would support Bachelet if five proposals delivered to her were accepted and incorporated into the candidate&#x27;s government program; these proposals dealt with changing the electoral system and granting workers more rights.

The runoff election between Michelle Bachelet and Sebastián Piñera took place on 15 January 2006.

Final results were announced on 30 January 2006, by the Electoral Tribunal. They indicated that Michelle Bachelet won the presidency with 53.49% of the votes classified as valid, 51.98% of the total votes cast, and 45.28% support of registered voters.

Sebastián Piñera conceded defeat immediately following a government announcement made on election day that included results from 97.52% of ballot boxes counted.

<doc id="1311805" wikidata="Q2147678" url="?curid=1311805" title="Unlimited Saga">
<text>Unlimited Saga is a 2002 role-playing video game developed and published by Square (rebranded as Square Enix in 2003) for the PlayStation 2 as the ninth game in the &quot;SaGa&quot; series. It was released in 2002 in Japan and 2003 in North America and Europe; its European version was published by Atari Europe. The story follows seven characters as they explore mysteries connected to the Seven Wonders, artifacts left by an ancient civilization said to be capable of triggering a golden age. Battles carry over the skill-based levelling systems and nonlinear structure of earlier &quot;SaGa&quot; titles, with an exploration structure similar to a board game.

Production at Square&#x27;s Product Development Division 2 lasted two years, involving a staff of fifty people. Several staff members returned from earlier entries including series creator Akitoshi Kawazu as producer and director, designer Kyouji Koizumi, and composer Masashi Hamauzu. The characters were designed by newcomer Yusuke Naora, with veteran artist Tomomi Kobayashi contributing promotional art. Kawazu wanted to get back to the basics of game design and evoke the style of the earliest &quot;SaGa&quot; games, placing focus on the battle system and having several elements mimic tabletop role-playing games. The graphics were designed in partnership with Adobe Systems to create a combination of 3D models and 2D artwork.

&quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; was first announced in 2002, and was supplemented with several guidebooks that detailed its systems and explored the game world&#x27;s lore. It was a commercial success in Japan, selling over half a million units in that region; it sold a further 130,000 in the West. It saw a polarized response between Japan, where it was met with praise, and the West. In English reviews, the music was met with general praise, while its graphics and unorthodox gameplay saw mixed to negative reactions. Feedback from the title influenced the production of both &quot;Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; is a role-playing video game where players take on the role of seven different protagonists, playing through the narratives in a nonlinear style. Gameplay is split between two modes; town exploration that includes story sections and interacting with facilities, and exploring environments while encountering enemies and environmental hazards. Town facilities are represented with icons on an illustrated background, with selecting an icon opening the facility and potentially triggering a story section delivered in a comic book style. During the game, players will explore towns which can be used to gather information and purchase goods to aid them on their journey before exploring outside environments and dungeons. Specific services in towns include the Blacksmith, which sells and forges weapons and accessories. A scenario-specific Carrier&#x27;s Guild has a ranking system, raised by performing delivery missions. The party can either save at a town, or perform a quick save while exploring. Upon exiting town, the party is either transported to the area of a quest, or can select previously explored areas on a world map.

Dungeon and environmental exploration plays out in a style similar to a board game; the player character is represented as a static sprite on a map that is revealed as the player explores, with unexplored areas being named with a series of question marks. Each move or action being equivalent to a turn. While exploring, an illustration in the top right hand corner of the screen shows the environment the party is in. The goal of missions in these areas is to reach a goal, either a story event, another town, or some other location within the map. The amount of turns taken by the player is recorded. Some missions have turn limits, with the player being returned to a town if they reach that limit. Moving into a new part of the map can trigger an event such as a battle or trap, or hold an item the party can search for and retrieve. While unlocking chests or avoiding traps, the player triggers the Reel, an options wheel that spins until the player halts it, triggering an action. Enemies shift position with each turn, and some spaces have hiding areas allowing the party to avoid battle if they choose.

When a battle is triggered, the party is unable to flee, either having to defeat the enemy or be defeated in battle. During battles, a player party of up to five on-screen characters fight enemies in a themed arena. The player is given five turns per round, with actions selected for up to that many characters per turn. Characters have two types of health: Health Points (HP), which is used for skills and special abilities, and Life Points (LP), which is their underlying health and is lowered if their HP bar drops to zero. If the scenario protagonist runs out of LP, the game ends and must be restarted from the last save. Both HP and LP are fully recovered when the party reaches a town, and can be recovered to varying degrees outside battle by resting for a turn. While HP level can rise, each character&#x27;s LP level is set from the game&#x27;s beginning. As in exploration, the Reel system plays a part, with the player&#x27;s chosen icon on the Reel impacting the type and power of a character&#x27;s move. The player can choose to have five individual actions, or &quot;Hold&quot; the action so they are chained together to create combination attacks. Combination attacks can be triggered by a single character using multiple skills or attacks in one turn, or multiple characters chaining their attacks together. An attack chain can be broken by enemies if their attack phase comes in the middle of the party&#x27;s turn.

While characters do not earn experience points in battle, completing missions can increase a character&#x27;s maximum HP, weapons have unique abilities, and skills are unlocked by equipping different types of items to a character&#x27;s growth tree at the end of a mission. New weapon techniques can also be learned during battle at random. Weapons have a limited durability, and after a set number of uses will break and become unusable. Durability can be raised by using certain items, or reworking the weapon at the Blacksmith. Magical abilities called Arts are learned by characters with tablet items. If an Art is used in battle, players will be invited to invest points into raising the power of that Art, unlocking an Art&#x27;s use with a weapon. Withdrawing points from the Art will cause the character to lose their higher abilities. Some character types can use spirits called Familiars, which are element-themed spirits equipped to characters who can perform specific skills.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; takes place in an unnamed fantasy world. Scattered across the world are the Seven Wonders, giant structures from a time called the &quot;Golden Age&quot; linked to an ancient battle against chaotic forces. Key to the world&#x27;s backstory is Iskander, a warrior king who conquered half the known world and founded a capital bearing his name near one of the Seven Wonders. In the game&#x27;s backstory, the Seven Wonders were created as research devices by the Arcanians, a race created as the original humanity by the world&#x27;s Creator. Their experiments in the Seven Wonders were with Chaos, a dangerous energy force. Chaos&#x27;s influence prompted the Creator to destroy the Arcanian&#x27;s civilization, banishing Chaos and causing the Creator to vanish. In the present, the Seven Wonders are attributed the power to bestow a new Golden Age.

The storylines follow seven different characters—Laura, Judy, Ventus, Ruby, Mythe, Kurt and Armic—who each face a person using the power of the Seven Wonders. Laura is a former pirate who after the death of her husband finds new meaning protecting a wandering prince. Judy is a young witch-in-training who goes on a quest to save her grandfather after he is trapped in a mirror by an old rival. Ventus is a courier looking for the man who killed his brother years before. Ruby is the powerless sister of a fortune teller who ends up caught in her affairs. Mythe is a lady&#x27;s man who becomes smitten with the picture of a mysterious woman. Kurt is a former noble knight who defies his family to find adventure and discover the truth behind a curse gauntlet he wears. Armic is a laid-back, slow-witted member of the Chapa people sent to find the items necessary for a rain-making ritual as his people are suffering from a prolonged drought.

In Ruby&#x27;s scenario, the party includes the now-immortal Iskander, who became an omnipotent being through learning the Creator&#x27;s secrets from Arcanian survivors. A key event in the game is the Festival, a celebration in memory of Iskander and his immediate successors Lord Dixon and his wife Regina. All the characters come together and can interact during this period. Each scenario reveals the antagonists to have been tempted, directly manipulated by, or be intent on using the manifested Chaos, which the chosen protagonist defeats and banishes once again.

==Development==
&quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; was developed by Square, which handled development for multiple role-playing series including &quot;SaGa&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. Development lasted two years, and involved a staff of around fifty people from Square&#x27;s Product Development Division 2. Many of the staff were veterans of the &quot;SaGa&quot; series. Series creator Akitoshi Kawazu produced and directed, Kyouji Koizumi returned as battle designer from the &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot; games, and recurring staff member Jyunichi Shinomiya acted as lead writer. As with other games in the series, Kawazu chose a non-traditional way of designing the game. He stated, &quot;As far as &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; is concerned, we said let&#x27;s tackle the basics of game design once again. We didn&#x27;t try to emphasize the realistic details, but rather symbolize, and cut out the parts we didn&#x27;t need. We thought, let&#x27;s dare to do a &#x27;not express&#x27; thing and we calmly [stuck] to that route.&quot; Despite the non-traditional approach, the team built on their previous game development structures when creating &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot;. During its early production, it was planned for an unnamed handheld console. When production of that console was cancelled, production was moved to the PlayStation 2. &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; saw the series&#x27; debut on that platform.

The game&#x27;s art director was Yusuke Naora, who had just finished work on &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. After completing his work there, Naora was considering leaving Square and going overseas to study art to keep up with other artists coming into the industry, but was unable to for unspecified reasons. At this point, Kawazu invited Naora onto the production team. Naora accepted, as he &quot;wanted to try new things&quot; within the &quot;SaGa&quot; series. The character designs were created by Naora, with additional character and monster artwork by Yuichi Shiota and Toshiaki Matsumoto. Naora was originally only assigned as background designer, but Kawazu wanted a &quot;challenging&quot; design for the characters, so requested Naora to design them. Regular series artist Tomomi Kobayashi created character art for the game based on Naora&#x27;s design. While working from another artist&#x27;s work, Kobayashi put her own spin on the designs, creating the illustrations around the primary color of each character. The visual theme for the cast was &quot;flowers&quot;, with each character being given a key colour based on a flower.

For the graphics, Square partnered with Adobe Systems to create &quot;Sketch Motion&quot; during battles. Using programs such as Photoshop and After Effects, hand-drawn 2D designs were combined with 3D models to create a unique hybrid look. The style of the opening movie, which featured the lead characters depicted using cel-shaded graphics like a &quot;moving watercolor&quot;, was suggested by Naora. The CGI opening, a first for the &quot;SaGa&quot; series, was animated by Square&#x27;s dedicated studio Visual Works. The animation lead was Takeshi Nozue, who would later work on several notable Visual Works projects including &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot;. The use of Adobe tools managed to cut down on production time for the visuals and opening, as the layers and effect filters made previously labour-intensive aspects of animation easy.

When designing &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot;, Kawazu wanted to go back to the mechanical roots of the early portable titles, deciding to create a game that focused almost entirely on its battle system. The &quot;Reel&quot; system was based on rolling a dice in a tabletop role-playing game. The board game-like gameplay and progression was intended by Kawazu as an evolution of his work on &quot;Wild Card&quot;, a role-playing game for the WonderSwan. The decision made &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; stand out from the rest of the &quot;SaGa&quot; franchise, which were traditional role-playing games. While there were internal worries about the gameplay&#x27;s unconventional tone and abstruse nature, Kawazu used his seniority within Square to produce the project. The basic narrative structure of seven major threats facing the world was created by Kawazu early in production, with the finer details being included later. Iskandar was to have been an eighth main character, confronting all the threats and joining the narrative together, but Kawazu scrapped the eighth narrative and incorporated existing concepts into Ruby&#x27;s narrative. Kawazu thought up Ventus&#x27;s narrative after seeing the narrative and gameplay concepts for &quot;The Bouncer&quot;.

===Music===

The music was composed by Masashi Hamauzu, while synthesizer programming was done by Ryo Yamazaki. The two previously collaborated on the soundtrack for &quot;SaGa Frontier 2&quot; after the departure of previous series composer Kenji Ito. Because the game uses streaming audio, it was possible for the sound team to use real acoustic instrument sounds in place of a synthesizer. Three pieces, including &quot;March in C&quot;, were written for full orchestra. Live recording of ensembles of tracks such as &quot;Feel Uneasy About the Wonders&quot; and &quot;Battle Theme IV&quot; pitted solo instruments against one another to create what Hamauzu considered a Latin sound. The ending vocal piece &quot;Soaring Wings&quot; was written specifically for singer Mio Kashiwabara. &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; features five-channel surround sound support from Dolby&#x27;s Pro Logic II. The game&#x27;s soundtrack consists of 58 songs spanning two discs. It was released on January 22, 2003. Due to fan demand, the album went through two reprints.

==Release==
&quot;Unlimited SaGa&quot; was announced by Square in July 2002. The game was one of five selected to form part of a promotional lottery campaign by Sony, where two random players of each title would go on journeys to areas of the world similar to settings in the games. For &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot;, the reward would have been a trip to Rome due to the shared presence of ancient city ruins. Due to tensions between the United States and Iraq at the time and the consequent risks of a terrorist attack, the campaign was cancelled. It was a prominent and popular addition to the 2002 Tokyo Game Show. The game released in Japan on December 19, 2002, by Square. It launched in a standard edition and a Limited Edition with unique artwork, which included a special booklet about the game&#x27;s world and a soundtrack CD. Shortly after the game&#x27;s release, Square finalized its merger with Enix to become Square Enix.

&quot;Unlimited SaGa&quot; was Square Enix&#x27;s first release in South Korea, published on June 19, 2003, by the local branch of Electronic Arts. The game was fully localized with native text and voice acting. The ending theme &quot;Soaring Wings&quot; was also localized under the name &quot;Nalgae&quot;, performed by Yonshin Pak. The new song was supervised by Hamauzu and Yamazaki. Hamauzu did not have Pak imitate or emulate the original song, but worked with her to adapt it into Korean, changing its tone and allowing her to sing at a comfortable pitch. Recording for &quot;Nalgae&quot; took place in April 2003.

A number of books were published by DigiCube. &quot;Unlimited Saga Material Collection: Lead to the Destiny&quot;, an artbook containing illustrations from Kobayashi, was released on December 12 prior to the game&#x27;s release. &quot;Unlimited Saga: The First Guide Book for Beginners&quot; released parallel to the game, covering the opening of each scenario. &quot;Unlimited Saga: Visual Arts Collection&quot; released on February 14, 2003, containing reproduced in-game artwork and designs. A full guidebook containing gameplay tips and staff interviews, &quot;Unlimited: Saga - Book of Disassembly&quot;, was released by Studio BentStuff on March 28. It was a highly extensive book, and included additional backstory and a novella written by Benny Matsumaya. Its comprehensiveness was due to fan feedback in Japan about the abstruse elements of the game and its world. A set of postcards and posters was released by Square via DigiCube&#x27;s distribution service. &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; was originally connected to the setting of the anime series &quot;Final Fantasy: Unlimited&quot;, but these plans were shelved during production. Kawazu later said that many of the similarities were coincidental due to his work on both projects.

A Western release was announced in February 2003. The game was among those shown by Square Enix at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo, alongside a number of other titles including &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot;, and &quot;Drakengard&quot;. In North America, the game was published on June 17, 2003. To promote &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; in North America, Square Enix held the &quot;Hall of Valor&quot; contest beginning on the game&#x27;s release date and ending on July 27. It consisted of three challenges where players would have to send in answers to difficult questions related to the game. Prizes included products by electronics manufacturer Denon. The European version was released on November 7, 2003, by Atari Europe. &quot;Unlimited Saga Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; was released in Europe and included a bonus DVD titled &quot;Eternal Calm Final Fantasy X-2: Prologue&quot;. The English dub was recorded by A.D. Vision. Actress Tiffany Grant, who voiced one of the protagonists, said it was unusual for video games to be voiced in the Houston area where A.D. Vision was based, and it only happened because Square Enix hired A.D. Vision for the dubbing. The dub was directed by Kawazu and Kyle C. Jones.

==Reception==

&quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; entered the Japanese sales charts at number 3 behind &quot;Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire&quot;, selling 196,471 copies, and ended the year with over 270,000 copies sold in Japan. By the end of Square Enix&#x27;s fiscal year in May 2003, the game had sold 560,000 copies in Japan. This made it the second best-selling title from their 2002 library behind &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;. For selling over half a million copies, Sony Computer Entertainment awarded the game a Gold Award during the 9th Annual PlayStation Awards on June 29, 2003. In the West, the game sold a further 100,000 units in North America, and 30,000 in Europe.

The game has seen a polarised response in Japan and the West; while Japanese press gave it high scores and praise, many Western critics gave it middling to low scores compared to earlier &quot;SaGa&quot; titles. Review aggregate website &quot;Metacritic&quot; showed a negative reaction from Western reviewers. The battle system saw opinions ranging from mixed at its implementation, to frustrated with its complex nature. Several critics noted the game&#x27;s experimental nature. The graphics also met with a mixed response due to their implementation, though several lauded their quality. By contrast, the soundtrack and visuals met with general acclaim.

&quot;Famitsu&quot; lauded the title for its new mechanics, which challenged the role-playing player base, and awarded it the publication&#x27;s Silver Award. &quot;1Up.com&quot; felt the game was too unforgiving for beginners due to a lack of in-game tutorials and steep learning curve. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; was very negative, with the three reviewers all faulting the gameplay, with one citing it as unfair for players. &quot;GamePro&quot; disliked both its non-linear structure and control scheme, which made exploration harder for the reviewer. Brad Shoemaker of &quot;GameSpot&quot; summed up the game as &quot;the flawed sum of its disparate parts&quot;, citing a lack of cohesion and polish in its gameplay and presentation, and finding the story lacking.

Christian Nutt of &quot;GameSpy&quot; was extremely negative about the game, calling it one of the worst RPGs he had played in many years, faulting almost every element of the title. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Jeremy Dunham said that the title was not for everybody due to its gameplay experimentation. Martin Kitts of &quot;PlayStation Official Magazine – UK&quot; was more forgiving of the game as he felt it was aimed at an audience who enjoyed a challenging experience, but still felt it was too abstruse and difficult for casual gamers, saying it would have worked better on the original PlayStation. Nich Maragos, writing for &quot;GMR&quot;, felt that the game had promise, but was undermined by poor execution on several of its mechanics and concepts.

Prior to its release, &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; was recognized by the Computer Entertainment Supplier&#x27;s Association in its Game Awards Future category at the organization&#x27;s annual event. RPGamer called &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; the &quot;biggest letdown&quot; of 2003 in their annual RPGamer Awards. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; called it the 25th Worst Game Of All Time. In 2012, &quot;1Up.com&quot; would include &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; on its list of &quot;Underwhelming RPGs with Overwhelming Soundtracks&quot;, with writer Bob Mackey calling it &quot;a shame&quot; that the music was likely neglected due to the game&#x27;s divisive mechanics. In a 2015 article on the &quot;SaGa&quot; series for &quot;USGamer&quot;, Jeremy Parish cited &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; as the game where Kawazu took his board game influences and unconventional style to an extreme.
==Legacy==

Speaking about the game&#x27;s mixed reaction in the West, Kawazu attributed it to expectations for a more traditional role-playing experience. The mixed reactions and internal wishes from staff would also lead to Kawazu developing &quot;Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song&quot;, a remake of &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot; for the PS2, with Naora returning to redesign the cast for the remake. Due to Kawazu&#x27;s commitments to other projects within the company including the &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot; subseries, &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; was the last original &quot;SaGa&quot; title for twelve years. That next title, &quot;&quot;, was partially built by Kawazu using feedback from &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot;. Following the remastered release of &quot;SaGa Frontier&quot;, Kawazu stated that a remaster of &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; was being considered.

<text>Tina Maze (; born 2 May 1983) is a retired Slovenian World Cup alpine ski racer. She is the most successful Slovenian ski racer in history with a career that culminated with two gold medals at the 2014 Winter Olympics. Maze was awarded the title of the Slovenian Sportswoman of the Year in 2005, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015, and with her four medals she is the most decorated Slovenian athlete at the Winter Olympics.

Maze started her career as a giant slalom specialist, but later competed in all five alpine skiing disciplines. She is one of seven female racers who has won in all five World Cup disciplines and one of three to do so in a single season. Maze is the 2014 Olympic champion in downhill and giant slalom and the 2015 world champion in downhill and combined. She was also the world champion in giant slalom in 2011 and super-G in 2013.

Maze won a total of 26 World Cup races during her career, and won the World Cup overall title in 2013. In that season, she won 11 races and tallied a record number of World Cup points – 2414, beating the previous record of Hermann Maier of 2000 points from the 2000 season. She also won the super-G and giant slalom titles, and finished first in the combined event (although no globe was awarded) and finished second in slalom and downhill. Maze also improved Maier&#x27;s previous record of podium finishes in a single season (22) with 24 podiums.

==Career==
===Early years===
Maze made her World Cup debut at age 15 in Slovenia in January 1999, in a giant slalom race at Maribor. During her early World Cup seasons, Maze competed in slalom, giant slalom, and super-G, but scored World Cup points only in the first two disciplines. At the 2001 World Championships, Maze&#x27;s best result was a 16th place in slalom. In January 2002, Maze won her first podium, a second place in giant slalom in Maribor. At the 2002 Winter Olympics in the United States, Maze finished twelfth in the giant slalom in her Olympic debut at Park City, Utah.

===2003–2004 seasons===
On 26 October 2002, Maze won her first World Cup race at the season opener in Sölden, Austria. She shared the giant slalom win with Nicole Hosp of Austria and Andrine Flemmen of Norway in the first-ever a three-way tie in a World Cup race. Maze finished the 2003 season on the 38th place in the overall standings with 190 points, all in giant slalom. At the 2003 World Championships, she finished 5th in giant slalom. 

In the 2004 season, Maze scored one podium, a runner-up position in giant slalom, and finished 33rd in the overall standings with 244 points. She scored her first points in super-G and started competing in downhill races.

===2005–2008 seasons===

The 2005 season was a successful season for Maze as she won 3 giant slalom races and scored two super-G podiums, both 3rd places. She finished the season 10th in the overall standings with 650 points: 366 in giant slalom, where she finished fourth. At the 2005 World Championships Maze finished sixth in super-G and 10th in the combined. 

In the 2006 season, Maze won one giant slalom race and two more podiums, a third place in giant slalom and a runner-up position in super-G. She finished the season 14th in the overall standings with 525 points and scored World Cup points in all disciplines for the first time. At the 2006 Winter Olympics, Maze competed in the giant slalom and super-G events, where she finished 12th and 39th, respectively.

The 2007 season was not as successful for her as the previous two seasons, with only 3 top 10 finishes. She finished the season 30th in the overall standings with 268 points. At the 2007 World Championships, Maze&#x27;s best result was a 14th place in super-G. 

In February 2008, Maze won her first downhill in St. Moritz, Switzerland, which was the first downhill victory won by a Slovenian female skier. It was also her first non-giant slalom victory. She finished the 2008 season 28th overall with 287 points.

===2009–2010 seasons: The breakthrough===

Following the declining results in the 2007 and 2008 seasons, Maze decided to break with the national ski team and founded her personal &quot;Team to aMAZE&quot; with her coach and partner Andrea Massi. This move turned out to be a decisive step in Maze&#x27;s career as her results began to improve significantly. In the 2009 Alpine Skiing World Cup, Maze scored two wins, both in giant slalom, in Maribor, Slovenia, and in Åre, Sweden. She also won three more podiums, finishing second in downhill and was third twice in super-G. At the 2009 World Championships in Val-d&#x27;Isère, France, Maze won a silver medal in giant slalom, her first medal in a &quot;big competition.&quot; In that race, she was only 15th after the first run but excelled in the second, &quot;because she was angry.&quot; In addition to the silver medal, Maze finished 14th in the downhill and fifth in the super-G. Maze concluded the 2009 season sixth in the overall standings with 852 points, her best result to that date. She also finished third in the giant slalom standings. 

In the 2010 season, Maze won one giant slalom race and had runner-up finishes in slalom and giant slalom. That season, Maze had fifteen top 10 results and finished fourth in the overall standings. Again, she finished third in the giant slalom standings. 

Maze was the flag bearer for Slovenia at the opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She won two silver medals – in super-G and giant slalom at Whistler. These were the first silver medals at Winter Olympics for independent Slovenia (athletes only won bronze medals before 2010). Maze was fifth in the super combined, ninth in slalom, and 18th in downhill.

===2011–2012 seasons===

Maze began the 2011 season strong with several good results and podiums. That season, she won the first races in her career in super combined (Tarvisio, Italy) and slalom (Lenzerheide, Switzerland). She finished on podium six more times. Maze finished the 2011 season third in the overall standings with 1139 points. 

At the 2011 World Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, Maze won the silver medal in the super combined and the gold medal in the giant slalom. She finished 5th in the slalom and downhill, and 11th in the super-G. 

The 2012 season was a very interesting one as Maze had no victories but had ten podium finishes. She finished the season second in the overall standings with 1402 points, behind Lindsey Vonn of United States.

===2013: The record breaking season===
Maze started the 2013 season with a win in giant slalom in Sölden, Austria. She then won the 2nd giant slalom in Aspen, United States, followed by two wins in St.Moritz, Switzerland, both in giant slalom and super combined. She then won again in giant slalom in Courchevel, France making it 4 wins out of the first 4 races in this discipline. She collected 11 podiums till the New Year, with five wins, two 2nd and four 3rd places, gaining a sizable lead in the overall standings. She also broke the records for most points in a calendar year (2,180) and most podiums (19) in a calendar year. Her first victory in super-G on 13 January 2013 in St. Anton made her a member of the small group of all-event winners in alpine skiing. On 26 January, Maze finished second in giant slalom in Maribor to clinch her first World Cup title in GS, then won the slalom the following day. 

On 24 February, she won the second super combined of the season in Méribel, France, and secured the overall World Cup title with nine races remaining. Despite having the most points in super combined standings, the crystal globe for this discipline is no longer awarded due to a lack of events.

On 1 March, Maze finished second in super-G in Garmisch, her 19th podium of the season, breaking the previous ladies&#x27; record. The next day, she won the downhill to record a win in all disciplines in a single season, previously accomplished by only two female skiers. In this race, Maze also surpassed 2,000 World Cup points in a single season and therefore broke Hermann Maier&#x27;s record from the 2000 season, which was exactly 2,000 points. The last downhill race of the season at the World Cup finals was cancelled, so Maze finished as runner-up in the downhill standings, a single point behind Lindsey Vonn, whose season had ended in February after a knee injury at the World Championships. The last super-G race was also cancelled and Maze won the super-G title. In the last race, a giant slalom on 17 March, she gained her eleventh victory of the season and finished with a record 2,414 points. 

Maze broke various statistical records in this season. They include the highest number of podiums in a single season (24, record previously held by Hermann Maier (22) and by Hanni Wenzel and Pernilla Wiberg for ladies (18)), highest number of top 5 finishes (31, previously Hermann Maier and Pernilla Wiberg (24)), highest number of points after first 10 races (677, previously Katja Seizinger, 643), highest percent of possible points won (69%, previously 61% by Pernilla Wiberg), and the highest point difference to the second-placed skier (1313, compared to 743 for Hermann Maier and 578 for Lindsey Vonn). In fact, Maze collected more World Cup points than second and third skier combined. Maze finished on podium in all Giant slalom events of the season, a feature previously achieved only by Vreni Schneider in the 1989 season. She is also the only woman to remain at the top of the overall ranking throughout the season – a feature only achieved at men&#x27;s Cup by Bode Miller. In addition to the overall title, Maze won the super-G and giant slalom titles, finished at the top of the combined list by winning both races in the season, and finished second in the downhill and slalom listing. The titles went to Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin, respectively. She also came extremely close to sweeping all 6 titles, losing the downhill title to Vonn by a mere 1 point with the seasons final race cancelled due to bad weather, and where Maze would have needed only a top 15 finish to pass the injured Vonn. Shiffrin needed to beat Maze in the seasons final slalom race to steal away the season slalom title from points leader Maze, and overcome an over second deficit on Maze after the first run to do so.

Maze came to the 2013 World Championships in Schladming, Austria, as a favorite. At the time, she was the leader in the World Cup standings in three of the five disciplines (giant slalom, super-G, and super combined), second in slalom and third in downhill. Several former alpine skiers stated that she is capable of winning a medal in every single discipline. In the first race at Planai, Maze won the gold medal in super-G and three days later won the silver medal in super combined. She then finished seventh in downhill, won another silver medal in giant slalom, and took fifth in slalom. 

In October 2013, Maze was awarded the Skieur d&#x27;Or Award by members of the International Association of Ski Journalists for her record-breaking performances during the previous season, thereby becoming the first Slovenian skier to receive the honour since its inception in 1963.

===2014 season===

Maze started the 2014 season less successfully, with one victory and three more podiums before the Winter Olympics in February. The decline in results was partially attributed to the change of the coach from the previous season, when Walter Ronconi replaced Livio Magoni. In January 2014, Ronconi was replaced by Mauro Pini, who, according to Maze&#x27;s team, brought a positive change to the team.
Following the Olympics, Maze won two more podiums, two third places. At the end of the season, she was completely exhausted and finished the last races with difficulties, having fulfilled her goals with two Olympic gold medals. She won a third place in the downhill standings and finished 4th overall. 

At the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, Maze finished fourth in the super combined at Rosa Khutor. The second event was the downhill, where Maze tied for first place with Dominique Gisin of Switzerland. This was the first gold medal for Slovenia at any Winter Olympics and the first time that a gold medal was shared at an Olympic alpine skiing event. Maze finished fifth in super-G, won another gold in the giant slalom, and was eighth in the slalom. Following her Olympic success, Maze was nominated for the Laureus Award for the second year in a row.

===2015 season===

The start of the 2015 season was stronger than the previous year&#x27;s for Maze. Winning three races and four additional podiums, Maze came to the 2015 World Championships in Vail / Beaver Creek, Colorado, United States, as the overall World Cup leader and was, as in 2013, seen as a potential candidate to win a medal in all five disciplines. She took silver in the super-G race, continued with winning gold both in downhill and super-combined and then finished 5th in giant slalom and 8th in slalom, what was her best overall performance at World Championships. 

Following the World Championships, Maze was tired and did not finish any of the two races in Maribor, which meant that she started to lose advantage over Anna Fenninger. Final races of the season were a close battle between Maze and Fenninger. Maze won six more podiums until the end of the season and was leading 18 points in the overall standings before the last race but Fenninger won the last giant slalom and defended her overall title from the 2014 season. Maze finished the season second, with her second-highest number of season points. She also finished third in the slalom, super-G, and downhill standings. At the end of the season, Maze hinted that she may retire from competitive sport in the following months.

===Retirement===

In May 2015, Maze announced that she would take a break from the sport for a year, not competing in the 2015–16 season and focusing on her studies instead. On 20 October 2016 in Sölden, Maze announced her retirement from competitive skiing. She officially concluded her career on 7 January 2017 at the giant slalom race in Maribor, at the venue where she made her World Cup debut in 1999.

<doc id="1311821" wikidata="Q725855" url="?curid=1311821" title="Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard">
<text>Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard FRS (8 April 1817 – 2 April 1894) was a Mauritian physiologist and neurologist who, in 1850, became the first to describe what is now called Brown-Séquard syndrome.

==Early life==
Brown-Séquard was born at Port Louis, Mauritius, to an American father and a French mother. He attended the Royal College in Mauritius, and graduated in medicine at Paris in 1846. He then returned to Mauritius with the intention of practising there, but in 1852 he went to the United States. There he was appointed to the faculty of the Medical College of Virginia where he conducted experiments in the basement of the Egyptian Building.

He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1854.

==Later life==
He returned to Paris, and in 1859 he migrated to London, becoming physician to the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic. There he stayed for about five years, expounding his views on the pathology of the nervous system in numerous lectures which attracted considerable attention. In 1864 he again crossed the Atlantic, and was appointed professor of physiology and neuropathology at Harvard. He relinquished this position in 1867, and in 1869 became professor at the École de Médecine in Paris, but in 1873 he again returned to America and began to practice in New York City. While in New York, his daughter, Charlotte Maria was born.

Finally, he went back to Paris to succeed Claude Bernard in 1878 as professor of experimental medicine in the Collège de France, and he remained there until his death, which occurred in 1894 at Sceaux, France. He was buried in Paris at the Cimetière du Montparnasse.

Brown-Séquard was quite a controversial and eccentric figure, and is also known for claiming, at age 72, rejuvenated sexual prowess after subcutaneous injection of extracts of animal testis. Thousands of men tried the therapy. The endocrinologist Robert B. Greenblatt wrote that this therapy could not have possibly worked because, unlike the thyroid gland, the testes do not store the hormones they produce and, therefore, obtaining a therapeutic dose of testosterone directly from animal glands &quot;would require about one-quarter ton of bull&#x27;s testes.&quot; It was later confirmed experimentally that his method did not yield active amounts of testosterone. The positive response by many men is now thought to have been a placebo effect, but apparently this was &quot;sufficient to set the field of endocrinology off and running.&quot;

In 1886 Brown-Séquard was elected to the Board of the Sugar Club. He also was a member of the Royal Society of London.

==Works==

Brown-Séquard was a keen observer and experimentalist. He contributed largely to our knowledge of the blood and animal heat, as well as many facts of the highest importance on the nervous system. He was the first scientist to work out the physiology of the spinal cord, demonstrating that the decussation of the fibres carrying pain and temperature sensation occurs in the cord itself. His name was immortalised in the history of medicine with the description of a syndrome which bears his name (Brown-Séquard syndrome) due to the hemisection of the spinal cord, which he described after observing accidental injury of the spinal cord in farmers cutting sugar cane in Mauritius.

Far more important is that he was one of the first to postulate the existence of substances, now known as hormones, secreted into the bloodstream to affect distant organs. In particular, he demonstrated (in 1856) that removal of the adrenal glands resulted in death, due to lack of essential hormones. At age 72, at a meeting of the &quot;Societé de Biologie&quot; in Paris, Brown-Séquard reported that hypodermic injection of a fluid prepared from the testicles of guinea pigs and dogs leads to rejuvenation and prolonged human life. It was known, among scientists, derisively, as the &quot;Brown-Séquard Elixir&quot;. A Vienna medical publication quipped dismissively: &quot;The lecture must be seen as further proof of the necessity of retiring professors who have attained their threescore and ten years.&quot;

Brown-Séquard&#x27;s research, published in about 500 essays and papers, especially in the &quot;Archives de Physiologie&quot;, which he helped to found in 1868 along with Jean-Martin Charcot and Alfred Vulpian, cover a very wide range of physiological and pathological subjects.

In the late 19th century Brown-Séquard gave rise to much controversy in the area of supposed inheritance of acquired characteristics. In a series of experiments on guinea pigs extending from 1869 to 1891, Brown-Séquard observed that a partial severing of the spinal cord, or a complete severing of the sciatic nerve, was followed after a few weeks by a peculiar morbid state resembling epilepsy. The offspring of the animals operated on were frequently decrepit, and a certain number showed a tendency to the so-called epilepsy. Some scientists considered these observations evidence for Lamarckian inheritance. However, Lamarck himself had rejected the inheritance of characteristics acquired by means other than their exercise or atrophy in response to environmental stimuli. His experiments are now considered anomalous; alternative explanations for his observations have been suggested. One proposed explanation was that the experiment showed a disease being induced in the parent and transmitted to the offspring.

<doc id="1311824" wikidata="Q2261960" url="?curid=1311824" title="Shoebox Zoo">
<text>Shoebox Zoo is a fantasy television series made in a collaboration between BBC Scotland and various Canadian television companies. It is mostly live-action, but with CGI used for the animal figurines. It was first broadcast in 2004, by CBBC. The series was broadcast in the United States by the Showtime network and in Jamaica by CVM Television.

==Series overview==
The series was conceived by then-BBC Scotland director Claire Mundell and television director Justin Molotnikov in 2002, and then further developed by Brian Ward. The series was co-produced by Toronto-based company Blueprint Entertainment, founded by John Morayniss, who previously worked at Alliance Atlantis, where he helped produce another CBBC programme &quot;Ace Lightning&quot;. The series consists of twenty-six episodes, split between two seasons made up of thirteen episodes each. The titular Shoebox Zoo were computer generated by Alias Systems Corporation, the characters designed with Celtic mythology and artwork in designs. Paul Kavanagh, a BBC post production animator, aided in the character designs.

===Setting===
&quot;Shoebox Zoo&quot; mixes Scottish, Celtic, and later, Native American mythology. The first season is set primarily in Edinburgh and other historic locations, while the second season moves to Denver, Colorado, though the season was shot in Canada. The series&#x27; protagonist, Marnie McBride, an eleven-year old Scottish-American girl moves to Edinburgh with her father Ross following the unexpected death of her mother Rosemary. On her birthday, Marnie receives a shoebox containing four carved toy animals from a junk shop owner. Marnie discovers she can magically bring the toys to life, referred to collectively as the Shoebox Zoo. The four are in fact humans transformed into toys by their master, Michael Scot, an immortal alchemist and wizard, for stealing his magical codex, the Book of Forbidden Knowledge.

In the series&#x27; backstory, Michael Scot lived in 12th century Scotland, where he crafted the Book of Forbidden Knowledge, containing his scholarly work on alchemy and magic. However, the book contained black magic forged from Michael&#x27;s pride and ambition. He created the series&#x27; antagonist, Juan Roberto Montoya de Toledo, a shapeshifting homunculus, using the book&#x27;s magic. However, Toledo was rejected by Michael, inspiring him to seize the book&#x27;s power and conquer the world. Michael&#x27;s four students - Edwin, Bruno, Ailsa, and his own son Wolfgang - steal the book to hide it from Toledo, though Wolfgang takes it out of spite towards his negligent father. The book is lost, Michael transforming the four into toys and putting them to sleep until a prophesied Chosen One, identified as Marnie, possesses magic to awaken them and find the book.

The second season further expands the backstory. After being lost at sea, the Book of Forbidden Knowledge washed ashore in Colorado in 1811, discovered by Marnie&#x27;s ancestor Angus McBride, an explorer, who gave the book to the local Lakota people led by Chief Stonebear in exchange for marrying his daughter. Discovering the book&#x27;s magic to be evil, Stonebear and other chieftains made preparations to destroy the book, casting it down the Falls of Faith, and designed the Arrow of Truth and Bow of Wisdom to vanquish its magic. The book disappeared into history once again, though Stonebear&#x27;s descendants were aware of its location in the Denver forests.

===Synopsis===
The first season begins with Marnie McBride&#x27;s eleventh birthday. She and her father Ross visit a junk shop, where the shopkeeper gives Marnie a shoebox containing four carved toy animals. Marnie awakens the Shoebox Zoo from their centuries-long slumber and begrudgingly accepts to quest to find the Book of Forbidden Knowledge and transform the toys back to humanity. Michael watches over her from Tantallon Castle, his ancestral home, while Toledo serves as an antagonistic force, aided by McTaggart, actually a mole working for Michael. Toledo poses as John Roberts, Marnie&#x27;s schoolmate, but his identity is exposed. Wolfgang, jealous that Marnie became Michael&#x27;s heir apparent, sides with Toledo to act as a spy. Marnie&#x27;s late mother Rosemary serves in a pivotal role throughout the first season, once considered a potential chosen one by Michael when she briefly owned the toys, but did not possess the magic to awaken them. However, Rosemary appears as a ghost in the series, possessing knowledge of the book and events of the past.

Marnie and the toys follow a series of clues across Scotland, eventually discovering the book hidden in the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s library. Wolfgang is revealed as a spy, but betrays Toledo upon making amends with his father. Toledo assaults Marnie&#x27;s home, accompanied by Los Contrarios, evil twins of the Shoebox Zoo fashioned by Toledo&#x27;s magic. However, when they are destroyed and Marnie refuses to surrender the book, Toledo retaliates by casting Wolfgang into a fire, killing him. Marnie eventually discovers the book is in fact a copy, designed to contain Toledo&#x27;s magic. Toledo is seemingly defeated, and Marnie experiences a vision, learning the real book was sent out to sea and lies somewhere in the United States of America.

In the second season, Marnie and the Shoebox Zoo fly to Denver, Michael and McTaggart aiding them from afar. Marnie stays with her maternal grandparents, and is aided by her best friend Kyle Stone, a descendant of Chief Stonebear. Kyle&#x27;s grandfather, Nathaniel, the spiritual medicine man of the Lakota people, aids Marnie, along with Hunter, a Native American spirit who can manifest in a horse-shaped ceremonial dancing stick. Michael learns of a second prophecy in which the book will be obtained by the malevolent Dawn Queen, who will use its magic to corrupt mankind. Toledo rises as a ghost, murders Michael, transforms a captured McTaggart into a weasel, and possesses the Dawn Queen&#x27;s mortal self, Aurora Dexter, an ambitious television medium. Needing clues to find the book, Ailsa suggests contacting Marnie&#x27;s mother in the afterlife. However, Marnie is slowly corrupted by the book&#x27;s magic and plots to use it to resurrect her mother altogether.

Marnie summons Wolfgang&#x27;s ghost to lead her to the book&#x27;s location, taking her to the Falls of Faith. Edwin and Ailsa free McTaggart who battles Toledo but is sent plummeting down the falls to his death. Marnie finds the book beneath her grandfather&#x27;s woodshed, containing an electric generator which channels the book&#x27;s energy, but Toledo steals it. Aurora, now the Dawn Queen, restores Toledo&#x27;s body but enslaves him. Marnie makes the decision to destroy the book using the Bow of Wisdom and Arrow of Truth, but the toys fear losing their one opportunity to regain their humanity. Aurora and Toledo plot to unleash the book&#x27;s magic on live television.

Marnie resurrects Wolfgang to complete a binding spell designed to suppress the book&#x27;s magic, and the group confront Aurora, using the Nathaniel&#x27;s sacred bundle to weaken her magic. Marnie then teleports herself to the Falls of Faith, firing the Arrow of Truth down it, which destroys the book, Toledo, and frees Aurora from her evil persona. At the end of the series, Marnie, now twelve years old, leaves the Shoebox Zoo in the same junk shop her mother found them in years before. In the closing moments, the series&#x27; narrator approaches and awakens the toys for his own unseen quest.

An 11-year old American-Scottish girl who moves from Denver, Colorado to Edinburgh following her mother&#x27;s death, Marnie discovers she has magical powers and is the Chosen One, destined to find the Book of Forbidden Knowledge. At first moody and reluctant to take on her role, Marnie embraces her destiny, coming to terms with her mother&#x27;s passing. &quot;Shoebox Zoo&quot; was Endicott-Douglas&#x27; first acting role in television.
* Jason Connery as Ross McBride, Marnie&#x27;s widowed father who works as a librarian at the University of Edinburgh.
** Connery also cameos Angus McBride, Marnie&#x27;s ancestor, who marries Stone Bear&#x27;s daughter in 1811.
* Peter Mullan as Michael Scot, an eleven-hundred year old wizard and alchemist, and Wolfgang&#x27;s estranged father. Based on the historical figure, Michael created both the Book and Toledo in his pursuit for power, corrupted by his own dark intents, leading to many of the events that set up the series&#x27; backstory. Although cantankerous, he is wise and mentors Marnie in both magical and personal issues, coming to acknowledge his own sins in the process.
* David McKay as William McTaggart, Michael Scot&#x27;s loyal manservant, cursed with immortality for his part in the Book&#x27;s theft and loss.
* Tony Donaldson as Professor Juan Montoya de Toledo, the series&#x27; antagonist. A shapeshifting homunculus created by Scot, Toledo seeks to acquire the Book to conquer the world and prove his superiority to his creator. He is suave and manipulative, but short-tempered and sociopathic. Due to his shapeshifting abilities, Toledo takes on the form of several disguises, including:
** Maxi Moffat as John Roberts, Marnie&#x27;s classmate.
** Kirsty Elkin as Dr. Joanna Robertson, a psychiatrist.
* Yudii Mercredi as Kyle Stone, Marnie&#x27;s friend of Lakota descent. Kyle is a descendant of Chief Stone Bear, possessing his own powers called &quot;horse magic&quot;, destined to succeed his grandfather Nathaniel as the local medicine man.
* Gordon Tootoosis as Nathaniel Stone, Kyle&#x27;s grandfather and a medicine man.
* Natascha Girgis as Aurora Dexter, an antagonist in the second season. A television medium from Valentine, Nebraska, Aurora is destined to become the Dawn Queen, a malevolent entity who is prophesied to use the Book&#x27;s dark magic to corrupt mankind. Toledo possesses her to ensure the prophecy comes to pass.
* Rik Mayall as Edwin, the pompous, self-proclaimed leader of the Shoebox Zoo, transformed into a metal toy eagle. His name and inability to fly is a nod to Olympic ski jumper Eddie the Eagle.
* Alan Cumming as Bruno, a kind-hearted though woolly-minded toy bear made of stone.
* Siobhan Redmond as Ailsa, a cynical and distrusting golden toy adder.
* Simon Callow as Wolfgang Scot, Michael&#x27;s son, transformed into a wooden toy wolf, who carries a deep resentment towards his father.
** Callows also voices Hunter, a free-spirited Native American spirit who materialises in a horse-shaped dancing stick. He repeatedly introduces himself as &quot;Sunkwaki, Spirit of the Horse Dance, son of Wakangli, war horse of Chief Inkpaduta, loyal servant of Wakan Tanka, etc.&quot;
* Bill Paterson as the Storyteller, the series&#x27; narrator. In the final episode, it is implied this unseen character inherits the Shoebox Zoo as their next master.

===Recurring characters===
* Krystina Coates as Laura, Marnie&#x27;s best friend in Edinburgh.
* Sean Young as Stewart, a school bully.
* Fergus Nimmo as Dougie, a school bully, who eventually becomes Marnie&#x27;s friend.
* Kelsey Collins as Becky Dexter, Aurora&#x27;s daughter.
* Paul Coeur as Bobby Campbell, Marnie&#x27;s maternal grandfather.
* Valerie Ann Pearson as Dorothy Campbell, Marnie&#x27;s maternal grandmother.
* Sammy Simon as Chief Stone Bear, Kyle and Nathaniel&#x27;s ancestor, who hid the Book in the Denver forests.
* Frances Low as Ms. McKay, Marnie&#x27;s teacher in Edinburgh.
* Dorothy Duffy as Ms. Arnot, a fellow teacher.
* Sanjeev Kohli as Mr. Kasmani, the bungling headteacher of Marnie&#x27;s school.

<doc id="1311825" wikidata="Q294587" url="?curid=1311825" title="Sega AM2">
<text>previously known as is a video game development team within the Japanese multinational video game developer Sega. Yu Suzuki, who had previously developed arcade games for Sega including &quot;Hang-On&quot; and &quot;Out Run&quot;, was the first manager of the department.

AM2&#x27;s first game produced was 1992&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;, followed by the highly popular &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; and &quot;Daytona USA&quot;. Through the remainder of the 1990s, they developed more arcade titles and focused on fighting and racing games. AM2 was placed under the management of CSK Research Institute in 2000, and a year later became SEGA-AM2 Co., Ltd. Their development of &quot;Shenmue&quot; was over budget and cost millions of dollars, and despite positive reviews and good sales was unable to become profitable.

Suzuki was promoted and left AM2 in 2003; Hiroshi Kataoka became the head of AM2. A year later Sega was acquired by Sammy Corporation and AM2 was merged back into Sega. Since, the team has continued work on arcade games such as &quot;Border Break&quot; and the &quot;Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA&quot; series, as well as smartphone games in Japan. Several games produced by Sega AM2 have influenced and innovated the video game industry from a technical and developmental perspective.

== History ==

=== Precursors to AM2: Yu Suzuki and Studio 128 ===

Yu Suzuki joined Sega in 1983 as a programmer. At the time Suzuki joined Sega, there was only one development division at the company. In his first year, he created a 2D boxing game called &quot;Champion Boxing&quot; for Sega&#x27;s first home game console, the SG-1000. According to Suzuki, the executive staff at Sega found the game so impressive that they released it in arcades as-is by simply installing an SG-1000 into an arcade cabinet. He was promoted to project leader while still in his first year at the company. Suzuki&#x27;s next project was the motorcycle racing game &quot;Hang-On.&quot; To accomplish his desire to make a 3D game despite technological limitations at the time, he specified the design of Sega&#x27;s new Super Scaler arcade system board, which utilized 16-bit graphics and sprite-scaling. &quot;Hang-On&quot; was very popular at launch and sold well for Sega. Suzuki&#x27;s success followed with additional titles &quot;Space Harrier&quot;, &quot;Out Run&quot;, and &quot;Enduro Racer&quot;. He and his team relocated to &quot;Studio 128&quot;, a more private location where &quot;After Burner&quot; and &quot;Power Drift&quot; were developed. He also worked on development of &quot;G-LOC: Air Battle&quot; and the R360 arcade cabinet. Developer Toshihiro Nagoshi joined Sega in 1989 as a designer with Suzuki&#x27;s team.

=== Establishment of AM2 and years as a department ===

Some time after the release of &quot;Power Drift&quot;, Sega began to separate the amusement division into the Amusement Machine Research and Development teams, or AM teams. Suzuki was made general manager of Research and Development No. 2, or Sega AM2. According to Suzuki, Sega employed approximately 600 people in research and development, and that AM2 began as a group of around 100 people. He has also stated the reason for this separation was the advent of advanced computer graphics technology. Around the time of AM2&#x27;s formation, Suzuki&#x27;s team moved back into the main office, then to an annex a short walk from the office. Even so, Suzuki worked with a desire of secrecy, so much so that Sega president Hayao Nakayama was denied entry on one occasion.

The first project developed by AM2 was &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;. While development began with 10 people on &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;, it finished with 25 workers on the project for a year, and the Model 1 arcade system board on which it runs took approximately three years. AM2 also ported the game for the Sega Genesis. &quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that AM2 &quot;single-handedly chang[ed] the perception of polygons in a gaming environment&quot; with &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;.

After the release of &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;, AM2 split into two teams; one began work on &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, while another started on &quot;Daytona USA&quot;. According to Suzuki, he wanted to develop a game with multiple joint movements, such as a soccer or rugby game. Finding that the Model 1 was not powerful enough to handle this many motions, Suzuki resorted to a game with only two moving characters at a time. With the massive success of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; in the industry at the time, he made the decision to make a 3D fighting game to compete. In developing the game, Suzuki identified the need for the game to be realistic, yet fun to play. &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; became a huge success in Japan, and its Sega Saturn port sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio with the console itself.

For &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, Nagoshi was director and chief designer, while Suzuki served as producer. The concept for the game was suggested by Tom Petit, head of Sega Enterprises USA, as a way to debut Sega&#x27;s new Model 2 arcade system board. Sega mandated that &quot;Daytona USA&quot; had to be better than &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, a game made by Namco. To accurately depict Daytona International Speedway, the developers used satellite imagery and sent staff to photograph the track; Nagoshi walked a full lap to get a feel for the banking in the corners. &quot;Daytona USA&quot; was released in Japan in August 1993, and worldwide in March 1994. AM2 ported the game to Saturn in April 1995. The Saturn port was a launch title in the West. &quot;Daytona USA&quot; was highly popular in arcades, and the twin cabinet was one of three 1995 recipients of the American Amusement Machine Association&#x27;s Diamond Awards, which are based strictly on sales achievements. In a 2002 report, Sega reported it to be one of the most successful arcade games of all time.

Over the course of the remainder of the 1990s, Suzuki&#x27;s primary concern in arcades were the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series and working as a producer for other titles. Subsequently, AM2 released &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; for the Model 2. Produced in twelve months, &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; was an even greater success in Japan than its predecessor. In a 1996 interview, Suzuki stated in an interview his philosophy to be not an imitator, but a pioneer in the arcade industry. He also described the palm tree logo of AM2 as representing reliance and peace of mind. Further titles developed in the end of 1990s included &quot;Virtua Cop 2&quot;, &quot;Fighting Vipers&quot;, &quot;Daytona USA 2: Battle on the Edge&quot;, and &quot;SpikeOut&quot;. &quot;Daytona USA 2&quot; and &quot;SpikeOut&quot; made use of the Model 3 system board.

=== AM2 of CRI and SEGA-AM2 Co., Ltd. ===
In April 2000, CSK Research Institute (CRI) took management over AM2. CRI was a subsidiary of CSK Corporation, which was Sega&#x27;s parent company at the time, and had previously published &quot;Aero Dancing&quot;. The new division became known as &quot;AM2 of CRI&quot;, and Suzuki remained in charge. Also in 2000, Sega restructured its arcade and console development teams into nine semi-autonomous studios headed by the company&#x27;s top designers. Sega&#x27;s design houses were encouraged to experiment and benefited from a relatively lax approval process. During the development of &quot;Shenmue&quot;, Nagoshi requested and was granted his own studio, leaving AM2.

AM2 developed what Sega hoped would be the Dreamcast&#x27;s killer app in &quot;Shenmue&quot;, a &quot;revenge epic in the tradition of Chinese cinema.&quot; The action-adventure game involved the quest of protagonist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father&#x27;s murder, but its main selling point was its rendition of the Japanese city of Yokosuka, which included a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game. Incorporating a simulated day/night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects (also introducing the Quick-time event in its modern form), &quot;Shenmue&quot; went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million. Originally planned as the first installment in an 11-part saga, &quot;Shenmue&quot; was eventually downsized to a trilogy. According to Sega of America president Peter Moore, &quot;Shenmue&quot; sold &quot;extremely well&quot;, but the game had no chance of making a profit due to the Dreamcast&#x27;s limited installed base. The high amount &quot;Shenmue&quot; went over budget was also a factor in the game&#x27;s lack of profitability. Its sequel, &quot;Shenmue II&quot;, &quot;was completed for a much more reasonable sum&quot;.In addition to the mixed reception for &quot;Shenmue&quot;, IGN&#x27;s Travis Fahs stated that &quot;the [Dreamcast] era wasn&#x27;t as kind to [AM2] as earlier years&quot;—citing (among others) &quot;F355 Challenge&quot; as an &quot;acclaimed&quot; arcade game that &quot;didn&#x27;t do much at home&quot;, and Genki&#x27;s port of &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot; as inferior to the arcade version, &quot;which was already a couple years old and never as popular as its predecessors.&quot; The &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series would experience a &quot;tremendous comeback&quot; with the universally acclaimed &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot;—which saw a console release exclusively on PlayStation 2. In Japanese arcades, &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; proved to be highly influential with its VF.NET system, paving the way for arcade games with network features. The quest mode of &quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot; on PlayStation 2, used AI mined from players in Japan playing through VF.NET.

In 2001, AM2 of CRI was renamed to SEGA-AM2 Co., Ltd. After serving as a producer on &quot;Virtua Cop 3&quot; and &quot;OutRun 2&quot;, Suzuki left AM2 on October 1, 2003, in order to start a new studio with Sega, called Digitalrex. He was promoted to non-executive board director. Hiroshi Kataoka was placed in charge of AM2. Kataoka, who had led research and development at AM2 for a year, had worked on numerous projects for Sega and Yu Suzuki&#x27;s division as old as &quot;Space Harrier&quot; to &quot;Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution&quot;. Makoto Osaki became AM2&#x27;s head of development, reporting to Kataoka. At the same time as the changes, a number of Sega&#x27;s studios were merged. However, AM2 did not merge with any other studio.

=== Merge into Sega and years since ===

During mid-2004, Sammy Corporation bought a controlling share in Sega and created the new company Sega Sammy Holdings, an entertainment conglomerate. Since then, Sega and Sammy became subsidiaries of the aforementioned holding company, with both companies operating independently, while the executive departments merged. Prior to the acquisition by Sammy, Sega began the process of re-integrating its subsidiaries into the main company, which was completed by October 2004. Sega would also restructure the development studios again, consolidating the divisions further into the Global Entertainment, Amusement Software, and New Entertainment R&amp;D divisions.

AM2 continued to develop games after the merger. &quot;Virtua Fighter 5&quot; was released in 2007. An upgrade, &quot;Virtua Fighter 5 R&quot;, was released the following year. The last release of the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; franchise was the console port of &quot;Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown&quot;, the final iteration of the game. &quot;Ghost Squad&quot;, in the style of &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, received an arcade and a Wii release in 2008. AM2 has developed games for the &quot;Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA&quot; series, as well as a number of free-to-play smartphone games in Japan, such as &quot;Soul Reverse Zero&quot;. Some titles have been developed for consoles as well, such as &quot;Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Mega 39’s&quot; for Nintendo Switch. AM2 became involved with the &quot;Hatsune Miku&quot; license with items for &quot;Virtua Fighter 5 R&quot; and the racing game &quot;R-Tuned: Ultimate Street Racing&quot;. When the PSP game &quot;Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA&quot; was in development, it was decided that AM2 would develop an arcade version as well as develop the holographic imagery for &quot;Hatsune Miku&quot;&quot;&#x27;s&quot; live concerts. The visuals for these projects were based on the &quot;Virtua Fighter 5 engine&quot;. Makoto Osaki called this period the most stressful for him since &quot;Shenmue&quot;.

A major success for AM2 has been the &quot;Border Break&quot; franchise. The game was partly developed because the development team felt envious of the &quot;Virtua Fighter 5&quot; team and wanted to develop a competitive game as well. The arcade release in 2009 was continuously updated, with releases &quot;Border Break Union&quot; in 2012, &quot;Border Break Scramble&quot; in 2015, and &quot;Border Break X&quot; in 2017—with a PlayStation 4 version released in 2018. In 2019, &quot;Border Break&quot; celebrated its 10th Anniversary. Other titles from AM2 to get long-term support in arcades are &quot;Quest of D,&quot; &quot;Sega Network Taisen Mahjong MJ,&quot; &quot;and Shining Force Cross.&quot; Hiroshi Kataoka likened the basic enjoyability of these network-based arcade games to those of an MMO, but collectible cards and a community differentiated these from the usually solitary MMO experience on PC. According to Sega Amusement International CEO Paul Williams, these type of core games are only possible in Japan due to Sega owning their own chains and being able to kickstart an online infrastructure. The latest effort, &quot;Soul Reverse,&quot; was born out of the desire to create a fantasy version of &quot;Border Break.&quot; It lasted a year, launching in 2018 with its network features shutting down in 2019. The game was not well received by the Japanese arcade player base. It took four years to produce. Currently running arcade games with AM2 staff working on them are &quot;KanColle Arcade&quot;, &quot;Fate/Grand Order Arcade&quot; as well as an updated version of &quot;Virtua Fighter 5&quot;, &quot;Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown&quot;, co-developed with Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.

As of 2014, Hiroshi Kataoka was still in charge of AM2. Currently he is an executive for Sega supervising arcade engineers and the technology backend of games developed at the engineering division.

== Games ==
AM2 has several arcade and video game series they develop, including &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, &quot;OutRun&quot;, &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, &quot;Virtua Striker&quot;, &quot;Fighting Vipers&quot;, and &quot;Shenmue&quot;. Other titles developed by the studio include &quot;Scud Race&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot;, &quot;18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker&quot;, &quot;F355 Challenge,&quot; &quot;Outtrigger (video game)&quot;, and &quot;Soul Reverse&quot;. AM2 has also developed smartphone games in Japan. Of AM2&#x27;s games, the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series is &quot;the highest grossing game in Japan arcades.&quot; The &quot;Hatsune Miku: Project Diva&quot; series has sold over 6 million units as of 2018. As of March 2012, the game &quot;Border Break&quot; has grossed JP¥8.1 billion from arcade machine sales, equivalent to more than US$100 million.

Journalists have praised AM2 as having a &quot;legendary&quot; status in game development, in particular under Yu Suzuki. According to Aaron Souppouris of &quot;Engadget&quot;, AM2 in the past developed games that defined their genres, and called the department Sega&#x27;s &quot;most-storied division&quot;. While lamenting the changes in development focus in recent years, Souppouris called the &quot;Hatsune Miku&quot; series &quot;admittedly excellent&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Edge&quot; called Suzuki &quot;the legendary head of AM2, Sega&#x27;s core coin-op operation&quot;. Also in 1995, &quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that AM2&#x27;s unusual repeated success came from its ability to release high-quality games on a regular basis. IGN&#x27;s Travis Fahs stated that &quot;[f]or as long as SEGA has had internal studios, AM2 has been the favorite son of the arcade division... Without AM2, SEGA would not have been able to dominate the arcades the way that they did.&quot; Video game researcher Ken Horowitz has stated that AM2 became the most well-known of Sega&#x27;s in-house development teams and that the studio produced &quot;ground-breaking classics&quot;.

<doc id="1311829" wikidata="Q173973" url="?curid=1311829" title="Swissair Flight 306">
<text>Swissair Flight 306, a Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle III, named &quot;Schaffhausen,&quot; was a scheduled international flight from Zürich to Rome, via Geneva. It crashed near Dürrenäsch, Aargau, on 4 September 1963, shortly after take-off, killing all 80 people on board.

== Timeline ==

Zurich Airport was in dense fog when the plane was due to take off at 06:00 UTC. At 06:04 the flight was allowed to taxi to runway 34 behind an escorting vehicle. At 06:05 the crew reported that they would taxi halfway down runway 34 to inspect the fog and then return to the take off point. This was done using high engine power in order to disperse the fog. Around 06:12 the aircraft returned to runway 34 and was allowed to take off, which it did 06:13, and started to climb to flight level 150 (about ), its cruising height.

Four minutes later people on the ground noticed a white trail of smoke coming from the left side of the aircraft. Shortly after, a long flame erupted from the left wing. Around 06:20 the aircraft reached a height of about . It then began to descend, entering a gentle left turn before losing height more quickly. It then went into a final, steep dive.

At 06:21 a Mayday message was issued. At 06:22 the aircraft crashed into the ground on the outskirts of Dürrenäsch, approximately from Zürich Airport.

== Probable cause ==

The aircraft&#x27;s brakes overheated due to the application of full engine power during taxiing. This caused the magnesium wheels to burst, one of them on the runway prior to departure. Upon retraction of the landing gear, the hydraulic lines in the gear bay were damaged. This was caused either by the wheels that had exploded, or the bursting of the other wheel rims during the climb. Subsequently, spilled hydraulic fluid ignited when it came in contact with the overheated landing gear rims. The fire damaged the gear bay, followed by the wing. The data from the airplane&#x27;s flight recorder combined with a lack of radio calls from the crew suggested that they likely began experiencing difficulties at 06:18. Irregularities in the data beginning roughly two minutes later indicated that the fire was causing electrical problems, while wreckage analysis suggested that parts of the airplane were detaching &quot;with increasing frequency&quot; around this time. The left engine had shut down prior to the crash; whether this was from crew action or a failure caused by the fire is unknown. The cause for the final loss of control was not conclusively determined. The rigidity of the left wing and rear fuselage, the integrity of the hydraulic flight control system, and the elevator control unit were all noted as possible areas the fire may have affected in the final portion of the flight to an extent which would have caused a rapid loss of control.

==Result==
As a result of this accident, all Caravelles were modified to use non-flammable hydraulic fluids.

== Casualties and aftermath ==
There were 74 Swiss nationals on board as well as two Americans (one dual citizenship with Iran), one Briton, one Egyptian (Olympic rower Ibrahim Abdulhalim), one Israeli, and one passenger was either from Belgium or Austria.

This crash severely affected the small village of Humlikon in the Canton of Zürich: 43 of its 217 citizens (20% of the population) had boarded the plane to visit a farm test site near Geneva. Among those who perished were the entire local council, all members of the local school board, and the village&#x27;s post office clerk. A number of children who were orphaned were looked after at home by relatives, and six of these children had to move, all but one of whom went to live with relatives nearby. 

Further problems arose with the upkeep of the local farms, but people from the nearby villages helped. Apprentices came from local firms, students, firemen, soldiers, boy scouts, railroad workers and policemen, as well as volunteer school children, and even from abroad to help. Approximately 600 tons of potatoes were harvested manually, corn was threshed and the new crop seeds were sown in time. Just over a month after the crash, a new council was elected by the 52 remaining eligible voters.

<text>Jakks Pacific, Inc. is an American toy manufacturer founded in January 1995. The company is best known for producing licensed action figures, playsets, dolls, plush toys and dress-up sets.

The company was co-founded by Jack Friedman, who had previously founded the toy and video game companies LJN and THQ. Friedman presided over the company, until retiring as CEO and chairman after March 31, 2010, a month before his death on May 3, 2010.

==History==

Jack Friedman and Stephen Berman co-founded Jakks Pacific in January 1995.

<text>Dattātreya Rāmachandra Bēndre (31 January 1896 – 26 October 1981), popularly known as Da Rā Bēndre, is generally considered the greatest Kannada lyric poet of the 20th century and one of the greatest poets in the history of Kannada literature. A pioneering poet of Kannada&#x27;s &quot;Navōdaya&quot; movement and a leading figure in the linguistic renaissance of Kannada in the region of North Karnataka (then part of the Bombay Presidency), Bendre forged a new path in Kannada literature and modern Kannada poetry through his original use of &quot;desi&quot; Kannada, particularly Dharwad Kannada – the form of Kannada spoken in the North Karnataka region of Dharwad. The richness, originality, and euphony of his poetry, his preternatural feel for the Kannada language, and his charismatic personality would result in him being hailed as a &quot;Varakavi&quot; (lit. &#x27;boon-gifted poet-seer&#x27;) by the Kannada people. In a poetic journey that spanned almost 70 years (~ 1914 – 1981), Bendre engaged continuously in what he called &quot;Kāvyōdyōga&quot; or &#x27;The High Yoga of Poetry&#x27;.

A multidisciplinary genius, his library is said to have held books spanning 102 subjects, including Quantum Physics, Mathematics, and Physiology. 
From very early on, Bendre published his poetry as &quot;Ambikātanayadatta&quot; (). Often mistaken for a pseudonym or pen name (in the western sense), Bendre described Ambikatanayadatta as the &quot;universal inner voice&quot; within him that dictated what he, Bendre, then presented in Kannada to the world.

In 1973, Bendre was awarded the Jnanapitha, India&#x27;s highest literary award, for his 1964 poetry collection, &quot;Naaku Tanti&quot; (ನಾಕು ತಂತಿ) (). Recognized as Karnataka&#x27;s &quot;Kavikula Tilaka&quot; (&quot;Crown-jewel among Kannada Poets&quot;) by Udupi&#x27;s Adamaru Matha, he would also be called a &quot;Kāvya Gāruḍiga&quot; (~ poet-sorcerer) for his ability to create magical poetry. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1968 and made a fellow of the Sahitya Akademi in 1969.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Dattatreya Ramachandra Bendre was born into a Chitpavan Brahmin family in Dharwad, Karnataka. He was the eldest son of Ramachandrabhatta and Parvatibai (nee Ambavva). The Bendres, also known as Thosars for some time, originally belonged to Kumbaru, a village in the Colaba district of Maharashtra, but a series of migrations which took them to Kalasi, Nasik and Tasgaon would see them finally settle down, along with the Lagu family, their patrons, in Shirahatti, a town that was formerly part of the princely state of Sangli and is now a part of Gadag district, Karnataka.

Bendre&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Appashastri (called Appabhatta) (1840–1914), was a &quot;Dashagranthi&quot; (&quot;Master of ten volumes of sacred lore&quot;) who composed several kirtans in Marathi. He was also a Vedic scholar who wrote a treatise on the Arya metre, titled &quot;Chhandodaharana&quot;. Appabhatta took &quot;Sanyasa deeksha&quot; in his old age, Later he died in Shirahatti still his Samadhi is in &quot;killa oni&quot; ( Fort area) of shirahatti. Bendre&#x27;s father, Ramachandra Bendre (?–1907), was a Sanskrit scholar who died of scrofula when Bendre was only 12 years old. Bendre&#x27;s mother Parvatibai (name before marriage was Ambavva), who died in 1924, was Ramachandra Bendre&#x27;s second wife. She was the youngest child of her mother, Godubai.

Bendre&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Godubai, was related to the Dixit family of Naragund on her father&#x27;s side and the Natu family of Mulagund on her husband&#x27;s side. Extraordinarily strong-willed, she confronted being cast out by her in-laws following her husband&#x27;s death (in 1887–88) by moving, on her own, to Dharwad with her newborn child (Bendre&#x27;s mother, Ambavva) and her two older daughters. Over there, she set up a &quot;khanavali&quot; (eatery) to support herself and her three daughters. Later in life, given her son-in-law Ramachandra Bendre&#x27;s ill-health and early death, she became a substantial provider (along with Ramachandra Bendre&#x27;s brother) for her daughter&#x27;s family of four sons also. Consequently, Bendre would grow up under the aegis of his mother and grandmother. In his autobiographical essay titled &#x27;The High Yoga of Poetry&#x27;, Bendre says that &quot;deprived by fate of my father&#x27;s and his family&#x27;s closeness, it was by direct observance of my mother&#x27;s and grandmother&#x27;s conduct that I realised my manhood.&quot; In a poem he wrote in his seventies, Bendre would pay tribute to Godubai&#x27;s courage by remembering her as someone who has &quot;fed him [on] tiger&#x27;s milk&quot;.

The oldest of four boys, Bendre completed his primary and high school education in Dharwad. Matriculating in 1913, he joined Fergusson College, Pune, and graduated in 1918 with a BA in Sanskrit and English. While in Pune, he lived with Bandopant Bendre, his father&#x27;s younger brother. With no children of his own, Bandopant would, until the end of his life, act as a great support to his older brother&#x27;s wife and children. Upon finishing his BA, Bendre returned immediately to Dharwad, where he became a teacher at the &quot;Victoria High School&quot;, thereby transforming into &quot;Bendre Maastaru&quot; (ಬೇಂದ್ರೆ ಮಾಸ್ತರ), a title he held for the rest of his life.

=== College years ===

Bendre left for pune in 1913 to attend Fergusson College. Joining him was Shridhar Khanolkar, a classmate from his very first day of primary school. A poet himself, Khanolkar too would return to Dharwad after his BA and work alongside Bendre at &quot;Victoria High School&quot;. Bendre would &quot;with affection&quot; dedicate his 1938 poetry collection &quot;ಉಯ್ಯಾಲೆ (Uyyaale)&quot; to Khanolkar&#x27;s friendship and encouragement and their warm relationship would last until Khanolkar&#x27;s death in 1965.

During his years in Pune, Bendre came in contact with Professor B. V. Patwardhan. Patwardhan had taught at the Basel Mission High School in Dharwad and was an influential person in Pune&#x27;s literary circles. Through Patwardhan&#x27;s cousin, K. R. Paranjape, Bendre would come to know Ram Ganesh Gadkari (Govindagraja), a pioneering poet of modern Marathi literature. While in college, Bendre would also become very involved in the &#x27;Sharada Mandal&#x27;, a group built by Prabhakar Hari Khadlikar and his friends. The Mandal was dedicated to the promotion of national identity and the mother tongue. This &#x27;Sharada Mandal&#x27; would serve as a model for (and sow the seed of) the famous &quot;ಗೆಳೆಯರ ಗುಂಪು (Geleyara Gumpu)&quot;, the &quot;literary circle&quot; that Bendre would put together in the years following his return to Dharwad.

=== Young Poet ===
Bendre&#x27;s first published poem was &quot;Tutoori&quot; (Trumpet). This poem was probably inspired by the Marathi poet&#x27;s Keshavasuta&#x27;s &quot;Tutaari&quot; – but there are important differences between the two. Bendre&#x27;s poem is a lot shorter and lacks the revolutionary ardour of Keshavasuta&#x27;s poem. It is possible that Bendre felt a kinship with Keshavasuta based on their common admiration for Keats. Govindagraja too might have exercised an influence on Bendre: the similarity in theme between &#x27;Raatrige (To the Night) and &#x27;Manatali Divasa Ratra&#x27; makes this a plausible supposition. However, in the total context of Bendre&#x27;s poetry, the influence of modern Marathi poetry is limited. Bendre himself was of the opinion that the influence of Marathi poetry on modern Kannada poetry was negligible. Indeed, Bendre had his own views about &quot;influence&quot;. In his opinion, &quot;it is not imitation of theme or style that elevates a poet or his poetry. [He] must constantly meditate on the lives of great souls&quot;. Drawn deeply to Sri Aurobindo&#x27;s idea of &#x27;Fourfold Beauty&#x27;, Bendre would come to see the world and the universe in terms of the number four. (His naming his poetry collection &quot;Four Strings&quot; is evidence of this.) This &quot;idea of four&quot; included what Bendre called his &quot;guruchatururmukha&quot; or &quot;the four faces of the guru&quot;. For Bendre, these four gurus were the Irish mystic and poet, A.E., the Lebanese poet-philosopher, Khalil Gibran, &quot;Gurudeva&quot; Rabindranath Tagore, and the Indian revolutionary and seer, Sri Aurobindo. According to Bendre, A.E. showed him a new way of experiencing nature while Gibran deepened his awareness of the metaphorical depth of the avatara concept. Tagore, who was an earlier and much wider influence than either A.E. or Gibran, helped Bendre develop a strong sense of community besides &quot;teaching [him] to love [his] mother&quot; through the exquisite poems of &#x27;The Crescent Moon&#x27; collection. In an early poem of praise titled &quot;Gurudeva&quot;, Bendre calls Tagore &#x27;the world&#x27;s eye&#x27;. But Sri Aurobindo&#x27;s was the greatest and longest-lasting influence. In his early years, his introduction to Sri Aurobindo was through the articles in &quot;Arya&quot; regarding &quot;The Future Poetry&quot;. These articles would inspire Bendre to work towards the creation of a mantra-like poetry himself. In later years, his visit to the Pondicherry Ashram for a &quot;darshana&quot; of Sri Aurobindo and The Mother would make a profound impression and influence the trajectory of his post-1956 poetry.

=== Public Recognition, Publication, and Elevation to &quot;Varakavi&quot; Status ===
Unlike poets like Tagore and Yeats and certainly unlike Keats, Shelley, and Rimbaud, Bendre&#x27;s recognition as a poet came rather late, when he was in his early 30s. Though he began writing poetry in his late teens, published his first poem when he was twenty, and his first book (titled &quot;Krishṇakumaari&quot;, a mid-length narrative poem) came out in 1922, it was only after the public reading of his poem &quot;Hakki Haarutide Nodidiraa&quot; at the Belagavi Sahitya Sammelana in 1929 that he became famous, almost overnight. Like Masti Venkatesh Iyengar would say later, &quot;...it is impossible now to describe the ecstasy [the poem&#x27;s] listeners felt that day. [While] that one reading was hardly sufficient to understand the various meanings the poem suggested, it was enough to astonish the thousand-strong audience. It was clear to everyone of standing in the &quot;poetry world&quot; that here was a new poet whose poetic &quot;shakti&quot; (~power) was his very own.&quot; This performance would be followed by the release of Bendre&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;Gari&quot; in 1932. Like Shankar Mokashi Punekar says in his wonderful essay about Bendre&#x27;s poetry, to read the poems in the &quot;Gari&quot; collection is to see &quot;how much further along Bendre has cartwheeled in the ten years since [the publication of] &quot;Krishṇakumaari&quot;&quot;.

This profound change in Bendre&#x27;s poetry was not lost on critics. Despite their unfamiliarity with the Dharwad dialect that Bendre had used in &quot;Gari&quot; (and which he would soon come to master completely), critics like V. Seetharamaiah and Ti. Nam. Sri praised the collection, with Ti. Nam. Sri even going so far as to say that some poems in it were &quot;deserving of a place in world literature&quot;. The publication of &quot;Gari&quot; would cause the floodgates to open, as it were, and the river of lyric poetry that rushed forth – in the form of the collections &quot;Moorthi mattu Kaamakastoori&quot; (1934), &quot;Sakheegeeta&quot; (1937), &quot;Uyyaale&quot; (1938), and &quot;Naadaleele&quot; (1938) – would overwhelm the Kannada literary world with its newness, innovation, and originality. At the same time, it would appeal to the common people through its inherent &quot;naada&quot; (~ euphony) and musicality. Writing the foreword to &quot;Naadaleele&quot;, Masti, whose keen critical sense had taken note of Bendre&#x27;s work as early as 1926 and been stirred to actively support it after the Belagavi performance of 1929, would note that Bendre&#x27;s poetry &quot;[is] not simply promising but [has] achieved fulfillment&quot;.

In an essay written examining Bendre&#x27;s &quot;poetics&quot;, Shankar Mokashi offers an excellent presentation of the idea of a &quot;varakavi&quot;. He says, &quot;...[t]his is an important description of an important experience! The simultaneous blossoming of [the] necessary words and rhyme with the blossoming of an idea [in the poet&#x27;s mind] is the experience of very very few poets. ... But that this is part of creation in poetry is evidenced by the poetry of Valmiki, Shelley and supported by the theory of &quot;expressionism&quot; put forth by the Italian philosopher, Croce. We can also look to understand this [inner experience] through a number of Bendre&#x27;s poems and the experience of other poets. Basically, what we are saying is that no sooner does a feeling and a word enter the poet&#x27;s mind than a rhyme, a rhythm, and a euphony descend simultaneously. ... This is a very piquant matter. This experience is at the root of the distinction made between the &quot;narakavi&quot; and the &quot;varakavi&quot; (the earthbound-poet and the heaven-touched poet) in our ancient poetics. In a &quot;varakavi&quot;, feeling-euphony-word descend in effortless simultaneity and take on form singly-doubly-triply.&quot;

=== The Evolution of Bendre&#x27;s Poetry ===
According to G.S Amur, the evolution of Bendre&#x27;s poetry can be seen as having happened over three phases. Amur calls the first phase the &quot;early experimental phase&quot; and avers that it spanned from about 1917 to 1923. The second phase is what he calls &quot;the first flowering&quot;, which began in 1923 and continued until 1956. The third phase, per Amur, began in 1956 and lasted until Bendre&#x27;s death in 1981. Amur calls this phase &quot;the second flowering&quot;. Given Bendre&#x27;s voracious interest in everything under the sun, it is not surprising that these phases present themselves as a mix of continuity and change.

The elements of growth and change in Bendre&#x27;s poetry can be seen understood in terms of theme, form, and imagery. The early phase, despite being one of experimentation, nonetheless referenced several of Bendre&#x27;s central poetic concerns and can be thought of as having laid the ground for the poetry that was to come. For instance, there is an &quot;aspirational&quot; quality to the poems of this phase: several poems are suffused with an idealism that desires a regional and national awakening as well as a poetic inspiration. The form and language of Bendre&#x27;s earliest poems (including &quot;Krishṇakumaari&quot;) are reasonably conventional. However, the poems of &quot;Gari&quot; show the first signs of Bendre&#x27;s experiments with Dharwad&#x27;s &quot;earthy&quot; vulgate as well as his preoccupation with &quot;naada&quot; or euphony. The themes that dominate the poetry of this first flowering are too varied to count and span the human experience. Nothing is excluded; all life is a &quot;leele&quot; (divine play) in which &quot;nothing is fruitless&quot;. Or, as Mokashi Punekar says, Bendre &quot;was a true &quot;bhaavageetakaara&quot; (lyric poem creator)&quot; – in the sense that everything was &#x27;material&#x27; for a &quot;bhaavageeta&quot; or a lyric poem. This phase involved endless experimentation and resulted in some of the finest lyric poetry produced in modern Kannada literature. The poetry of the final phase may be called &quot;the visionary phase&quot;. In this phase, we see Bendre looking to explore the roots of language (or &quot;vak&quot;) and its four degrees (or manifestations) as described in Indic poetics – &quot;vaikari&quot;, &quot;madhyama&quot;, &quot;pashyanti&quot;, and &quot;parā&quot; – and to create new poetic forms capable of articulating his vision. In a bid to achieve the quality of the mantra, Bendre experimented with a variety of metres including Vedic metres.

=== Ambikatanayadatta ===
The phenomenon of &quot;Ambikatanayadatta&quot; is an especially interesting one, but one that has been seldom discussed in critical appraisals regarding Bendre and his poetry. In his autobiographical essay, Bendre says that &quot; this name [Ambikatanayadatta] is not some sobriquet meant to conceal the name &#x27;Bendre&#x27;. In a poem with that name, you can find clues that illuminate [the phenomenon&#x27;s] piquancy. Right by this poem&#x27;s side is the poem &#x27;ನಾನು (I)&#x27;.&quot; Like the last two lines of the poem &quot;ನಾನು (I)&quot; say: &quot;&quot;The Nārayaṇa of the lotus-heart has himself turned into the mortal &quot;Datta&quot; / as &quot;Ambikātanaya&quot; he mirrors in Kannada the universe&#x27;s inner voice.&quot; Bendre&#x27;s mother&#x27;s name was Ambika (known affectionately as Ambavva) and &quot;Ambika_tanaya_datta&quot; means &quot;Datta, Son of Ambika&quot;.

Perhaps the only critic who has seriously attempted to understand the phenomenon of Ambikatanayadatta is Shankar Mokashi Punekar. In one of his essays following Bendre&#x27;s death, he writes: &quot;Has Bendre gone heavenwards? Yes. But it is impossible for &#x27;Ambikatanayadatta&#x27; to ever leave this earth, this language, this town of Sadhanakeri. To paraphrase Bendre, his poems are living and breathing examples of recipients of the &#x27;Ambikatanayadatta&#x27; touch. Occasionally, this touch used to happen in [Bendre&#x27;s] dreams. In his poems, [Bendre] has put such lines [that came to him in dreams] within quotation marks. Once in a while, when a couple of stanzas came after much effort, the &#x27;Ambikatanayadatta&#x27; that flashed [within] would come and, relieving Bendre of his burden, move forward with sure-footed swiftness.&quot; In the concluding part of the same essay, Punekar says that &quot;Bendre&#x27;s mother tongue was Marathi. However, his Marathi poems do not even &quot;reach the knee-height&quot; of his Kannada poems. But the Marathi people must not consider these words an &#x27;insult&#x27;. [Because] while Bendre&#x27;s mother tongue was Marathi, Ambikatanayadatta&#x27;s mother tongue was Kannada. &quot;He&quot; was a Kannadiga. [This cannot be explained] Only those who get what I mean will get it.&quot;

Punekar&#x27;s description fits well with Bendre&#x27;s own estimation of Ambikatanayadatta and his conviction that it was &quot;the universal inner voice&quot; within him. For example, in his foreword to &quot;Gari&quot;, his very first collection of poems, he says: &quot;I have talked so far of my poems. This is simply a matter of habit. In truth these are not my poems; they are Kannada&#x27;s poems. The Kannada-language&#x27;s incorporeal voice is actualizing itself through a thousand throats. That my throat is one among this thousand is itself my blessing. That I am one among the group of poets singing in the dawn of Kannada&#x27;s renaissance is itself my source of pride. For if it were not so, why should anybody care about my poems? To say &#x27;my poems&#x27; or &#x27;his poems&#x27; is fallacious; for Kannada to lay claim to these poems is the truth.&quot; Later, many years after he had earned the &quot;varakavi&quot; honorific and was secure in his position as the doyen of modern Kannada poetry, he would say in the foreword to &quot;Naaku Tanti&quot;: &quot;...to all those &quot;sahrudaya&quot;s who have continued to welcome the poems of &#x27;Ambikatanayadatta,&#x27; &#x27;Bendre&#x27; conveys his gratitude: that his scribesmanship is not simply a waste, that his happy, wanton singing is not completely fruitless.&quot; In addition to these writings, stories of Bendre going up on stage and conveying &quot;Bendre&#x27;s salutations to the great poet Ambikatanayadatta&quot; are also in circulation.

=== Marriage and Family life ===
Bendre married Lakshmibai (nee Rangoobai) (1906–1966) in 1919 in Ranebennuru. He was 23 at the time and Lakshmibai was 13. They would go on to have nine children and stay married for 47 years until Lakshmibai&#x27;s death in 1966.

To Bendre, marriage was its own form of &quot;sadhana&quot;. With Bendre unemployed for long durations between 1924 and 1942, the burden of managing the family and finances fell on Lakshmibai who bore them stoically. The primary reason for this &quot;&quot;jangama&quot; life&quot;, as Bendre called it, was his imprisonment (in 1932) by the British government on charges of sedition. The excuse given was that his poem &quot;Narabali&quot; (Human Sacrifice) was a poem that could possibly incite violence. Despite having to stay in jail for only three months (and having to spend another nine months under house arrest), the British government&#x27;s injunction that &quot;nobody [was] allowed to employ Bendre for up to eight years after his release&quot; meant giving up the hope of any permanent job during that period. All these misfortunes meant that Lakshmibai was taxed with keeping the family fed and clothed on the little money that Bendre was able to bring home. It is worth mentioning that Masti was a great help to Bendre in these years, both as a friend and financially. He appointed Bendre the (unofficial) editor of his magazine, &quot;Jeevana&quot;, and paid him a monthly sum to help him tide through those years. Bendre would always remain grateful for Masti&#x27;s generosity and come to think of and refer to him as &quot;aṇṇa&quot; (big brother).

Although she had been educated only up to the fourth grade, Bendre involved Lakshmibai in his poetry and she was always the first one to listen to Bendre&#x27;s poems. In 1937, Bendre wrote his famous &quot;Sakheegeeta&quot;, a descriptive account of his married life up to that point. In it, he refers to his wife Lakshmibai as his sakhee, a first in Kannada literature (and possibly Indian literature). In the foreword to the poem, Bendre says that he has &quot;let spread the happy-sad vine of the ordinary married life upon the trellis of [his] personal experience.&quot; Written in a metre of his own invention, the poem is especially striking for its (rooted) universality and for its prolific use of non-Sanskritized Kannada.

The Bendres&#x27; married life was a difficult one. They were unfortunate enough to lose six of their nine children. One of them, Ramachandra, a budding poet himself, died of an infection at 20, on the cusp of manhood and just when he was beginning to be the dependable support his parents were looking for. The elegy Bendre composed for Rama (as he was known) is considered one of the greatest poems of its kind in Kannada. Another poem, &quot;ನೀ ಹೀಂಗ ನೋಡಬ್ಯಾಡ ನನ್ನ (Don&#x27;t Look at Me This Way)&quot;, written as a lament at the loss of his daughter Lalitha, is one of 20th-century Kannada literature&#x27;s most popular as well as critically acclaimed song-poems.

Lakshmibai&#x27;s constitution was not strong and she suffered periodically from illnesses. According to her younger son (of the two who survived), Dr. Vamana Bendre, the loss of Ramachandra plunged her into a despondence she was never quite able to overcome. With Bendre&#x27;s job never being well-paying, Lakshmibai stoically endured a life of hardship. Her memory, though, has been immortalized in a number of Bendre&#x27;s &#x27;love poems&#x27;. In an especially touching gesture, Bendre dedicated his dazzling Kannada translation of Kalidasa&#x27;s Meghadoota to Lakshmibai, calling her his &quot;Lakshmi of good fortune&quot; and asking that she &quot;accept this garland made of pearls picked from Kalidasa&#x27;s sea&quot; and &quot;become a partner in his prosperity&quot;.

In some ways, despite the western cultural mores that underpin the statement, it would not be wrong to say that Bendre, through his art, brought to life Eliot&#x27;s assertion that &quot;the more perfect the artist, the more completely separate in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates; the more perfectly will the mind digest and transmute the passions which are its material&quot;. There is no doubt that while Bendre the man suffered, the creative mind (Ambikatanayadatta?) digested and transmuted Bendre&#x27;s suffering into some of the finest lyric poetry in modern Kannada. Or to say it using Bendre&#x27;s own words, &quot;&quot;rasika&quot;, let my troubles stay my own / I will give you just their song! / And if that melts your sugar-heart / send drops of sweetness back along!&quot;

Lakshmibai finally passed away on 17 August 1966, after another illness. Deeply saddened by Lakshmibai&#x27;s death (at a time when things were finally beginning to look up financially), Bendre found solace in the company of Swami Nityananda of Vajreshvari. He would, some years later, address his departed &quot;sakhee&quot; in his &quot;Matte Shravana Bantu&quot; collection (1973), where he returned to the metre of &quot;Sakheegeeta&quot; to narrate the story of his boyhood and youth up until he married his &quot;sakhee&quot;.

Dr. Vamana Bendre (1935–2017), Panduranga Bendre (1929–2004), and Mangala (b. 1939) were the only children of Bendre&#x27;s who lived to be adults. Upon Bendre&#x27;s death in 1981, Dr. Vamana Bendre took over as his &#x27;literary executor&#x27; and edited the 18-volume &quot;Audumbaragaathe&quot;, a compilation of all of Bendre&#x27;s poetry and prose writings. With his siblings Panduranga Bendre and Mangala and his colleague K.S. Sharma, Dr. Vamana Bendre was also responsible for the creation of the &quot;Ambikatanayadatta Vedike&quot;, a platform to promote Bendre&#x27;s work. With the help of a grant from the Karnataka government, a portion of Bendre&#x27;s &#x27;Shrimaata&#x27; home was used to build the &#x27;Bendre Bhavana&#x27; as a memorial to the Ambikatanayadatta, the poet.

===Bendre and Dharwad===
According to Bendre himself, his relationship with Dharwad was an umbilical one. His affection for Dharwad and its people and the inspiration he drew from it has been compared to the inspiration Lake District provided Wordsworth. Closer home, it has been compared to the Adikavi Pampa&#x27;s affection for his beloved Banavasi (which, says Pampa in one verse, he wishes to be reborn in, if only as a little bee.) With his firm belief in the &quot;mother principle&quot;, Bendre would address the land of Dharwad as &quot;Dharawada taayi&quot; or &#x27;Mother Dharawada&#x27; and ask her, when he had to go away for a period on work, to await his coming like she would her child&#x27;s. Having grown up in different homes in Dharwad, he would settle in a house (gifted to him by his uncle, Bandopant Bendre) in the Sadhanakeri area of Dharwad and make the area famous through his famous song-poem &quot;Baaro Saadhanakerige&quot;.

Here is an account by Keerthinath Kurtakoti, who along with Shankar Mokashi and G.S Amur is considered one of the three finest critics of Bendre&#x27;s poetry, of Bendre&#x27;s relationship with Dharwad and its people. &quot;It was when I was ... filming a documentary of Bendre that this idea of the relationship Bendre had with Dharwad struck me of a sudden. [That is] the style of Dharwad&#x27;s development is the style of Bendre&#x27;s poetry. Dharwad&#x27;s culture is a mixture of folk-culture and city-culture. Bendre had once heard someone say that Dharwad&#x27;s natural beauty – in particular, its rains and its lush greenness – was capable of making anybody who lived there a poet. In the foreword he wrote to Chennaveera Kanavi&#x27;s &quot;Nela-Mugilu&quot; poetry collection, Bendre would answer this by saying that &quot;despite Dandeli&#x27;s thick forests having more rain and greenness than Dharwad, not a single poet has come out of the region&quot;. Now it might seem astonishing that a poet who has immortalized Dharwad&#x27;s scenic beauty in his poetry has such little faith in the inspiring power of the region&#x27;s natural beauty. But it is only the Dharwad people&#x27;s &quot;divine vigour&quot; that Bendre has faith in. He has, with his own eyes, seen how Dharwad has put back and rebuilt the Kannada [language and culture] that at the beginning of this century was lying waste. He has himself participated in this rebuilding.&quot; ... Every inch of the Dharwad land has revealed its history to Bendre. For him, both the classical and the modern have to present themselves through Dharwad [alone].&quot;

=== Post-retirement years, old age, and death ===
Upon his retirement from D.A.V College, Solapur, in 1956, Bendre returned to Sadhanakeri. Fortunately for him, no sooner did he return than he was made the adviser to the Dharwad branch of Akashvani. This was, in large part, thanks to the generosity and foresight of P.M. Lad, the then Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. During his stint there, Bendre wrote a great deal for A.I.R, including a number of radio plays, of which only a few have been published so far. Meanwhile, his association with a publisher friend, Bhalachandra Ghanekar, led to the publication of five new books of poetry. These books were soon combined into a single-volume and published in 1957 under the title &quot;Aralu-Maralu&quot;. The collection would win the Sahitya Academy award in 1958.

In 1965, Bendre, who also wrote poetry and prose in Marathi, received the Kelkar Prize for &quot;Samvada&quot;, a selection of his Marathi prose writing. In 1966, Bendre turned 70. The event was marked by a grand celebration in Shirahatti, his ancestral hometown.

This period also saw Bendre receive with a number of well-deserved honours. The University of Mysore gave him an Honorary Doctorate in 1966 and Karnatak University followed suit in 1968. 1968 was also the year that he received the Padma Shri from the Government of India. Elected a Fellow of the Sahitya Akademi in 1969, he was awarded India&#x27;s highest literary award, the Jnanapitha, in 1974. Kashi Vidyapitha presented him with his third Honorary Doctorate in 1976.

Through all of this, Bendre&#x27;s &#x27;High Yoga of Poetry&#x27; continued unabated and he brought out eleven collections of poetry between 1957 and 1978. As was his wont from the very beginning, he continued to mingle with all kinds of people, accept invitations to speak from all over, and talk uninterruptedly for hours together.

Towards the end of his life, Bendre became deeply absorbed in numbers. Interested from early on itself in numbers and their representation, the theory of Sankhya, and the Katapayadi system, they now became his central concern. In fact, he was known to waylay hapless travellers and hold forth for hours about this or that new idea regarding numbers that had come to him. When Dom Moraes visited Bendre in 1976, he found him completely immersed in numbers. He was still a &quot;Gārudiga&quot;, but the &quot;Gārudi&quot; had been replaced by a calculator. &quot;Only great poets&quot;, wrote Moraes, &quot;have such interests and ideas as Dr. Bendre.&quot;

Bendre died in Mumbai&#x27;s Harkishandas hospital on 26 October 1981, aged 85. He was cremated that very evening in accordance with Hinduism&#x27;s last rites. His ashes were later taken to Dharwad where a procession gathered to mourn and celebrate Karnataka&#x27;s and Dharwad&#x27;s favourite poet.

==Critical reception, influence, and legacy==
Bendre is widely recognized the greatest and most influential Kannada poet of the 20th century, by his peers of the Navodaya period, younger contemporaries, and the later poets of the Navya, Bandaya, Dalit, and other movements. While he has been criticized by some for the lack of &quot;social concern&quot; in his poetry and others have called the poetry of the post-&quot;Naaku Tanti&quot; period incomprehensible and &quot;meaningless wordplay&quot;, there is near-unanimous agreement about the originality and inventiveness of his poetry, his position as the trailblazer of modern Kannada poetry, and his remarkable use of the Kannada language. The well-known critic, L. S. Seshagiri Rao, has written that it is &quot;doubtful that anybody in Kannada&#x27;s literary history has explored the Kannada language as comprehensively as Bendre&quot;. In an essay written a few years before Bendre&#x27;s death, Gopalkrishna Adiga, often called the leader of Kannada&#x27;s Navya movement, would say that, &quot;After Pampa and Naranappa, nobody has grasped the very quick of the Kannada language and, strumming the language&#x27;s life-chord itself, written poetry the way [our] Bendre has.&quot; He would add in the same essay that, no matter what differences of opinion one might have with Bendre, &quot;he is the &quot;guru&quot; of every poet writing [in Kannada] now. ... There is no poet who has not, either directly or indirectly, come within the sphere of his influence. That he showed the way [forward] not just to imitators but to poets possessed of great talent themselves or that he nourished their poetry [with his own] is a matter of importance. Bendre is the most important poet-creator of this century. Every poet writing now is a child, grandchild, or great-grandchild of Bendre&#x27;s poetry. ... Not only has Bendre&#x27;s poetry become a part of our culture, it has become one with our essence.&quot;

V. K. Gokak, a younger contemporary of Bendre&#x27;s, one of the members of Bendre&#x27;s &quot;Geleyara Gumpu&quot;, and himself a Jnanapitha awardee, confesses in his book, &quot;Bendre: Poet and Seer&quot;, that it was Bendre&#x27;s acquaintance that ensured &quot;[Gokak&#x27;s] muse did not perish in the deserts of Indo-Anglian verse&quot; and goes on to say that &quot;Bendre&#x27;s poetry has ushered in a tradition of its own in modern Kannada literature ... [his] poetic style has an intricate pattern of its own ... [his] is an epic style harnessed to [sic] lyric uses ... every great modern writer illustrates [the synthesis of India and Europe, ancient and modern culture, science and art] in his own way ... and this is what Bendre does [which puts him] among the best writers that the modern world has produced.&quot;

Interestingly, Bendre&#x27;s remarkable poetry for responsible for the critical development of three of Kannada&#x27;s best-known thinkers, viz. Keertinath Kurtakoti, Shankar Mokashi, and G.S Amur. Each of these younger-by-a-generation contemporaries of his used his poetry as the whetstone to sharpen their critical acumen on. In doing so, each of them made a notable contribution to modern Kannada criticism. In particular, their insights about Bendre include Mokashi&#x27;s statement that &quot;of those [Kannada] poets to whose study one may capably and successfully devote a whole lifetime, Shri Bendre is the most modern ... his is a poetry that may be thought of as &#x27;out-topping knowledge&#x27;&quot;.

Meanwhile, G.S Amur writes in his Sahitya Akademi award-winning book, &quot;Bhuvanada Bhaagya&quot;, that &quot;no matter what criteria we use to measure Bendre&#x27;s poetry – vision, richness of language, the ability to create images, the successful use of metre, the variety of poetic style, it is evident that his poetry stands shoulder to shoulder with the poetry of any epic poet who has [ever] lived.&quot; In the book he wrote for the Sahitya Akademi, Amur concludes by saying that &quot;the &quot;bhaavageeta&quot; was [Bendre&#x27;s] chief mode of expression but in his hands it assumed many forms, from a folk lyric to &quot;Mantra&quot; [sic] and expressed itself in a variety of a rhythms and an amazing range of symbolic imagery. He was undoubtedly the greatest lyrical poetic genius of the century.&quot;

Written as early as 1962, Kurtakoti&#x27;s essay, on the other hand, offers us an understanding of the influence that Bendre&#x27;s poetry would have on 20th century Kannada poetry and beyond. Kurtakoti says that &quot;from every point of view, Bendre is the leading poet of the age. Later critics can discuss the merits of Bendre&#x27;s own poetry and the style of its beauty in more detail. For the time being, all we can is this: that Bendre&#x27;s poetry is rich in a way that does justice to the Kannada language&#x27;s natural rhythms, to the present-day&#x27;s sensibilities, and to the inner-essence of the Kannada literary tradition. In this fashion, his Kannada poetic creation has given new life to the Kannada poetic tradition. When Bendre first began to write poetry, there was nothing before him [to model his poetry on]. But the poets of the future will have Bendre&#x27;s poetry [to refer to] ... this alone tells us clearly of the importance of Bendre&#x27;s poetry.&quot;

Bendre himself was not unaware of the depth, range, and brilliance of his poetry. In his foreword to &quot;Naaku Tanti&quot;, he speaks about &quot;the poetry of wordly effort and the poetry of yogic effort&quot; and says that &quot;we must not by holding on tight to the ignorance and egotism of ordinariness give it up to the curse of petrification&quot; before adding that &quot;complexity and incomprehension are the result of one&#x27;s natural sensibilities. It is only through comprehensive learning that old bonds can be shaken off, and new relationships created.&quot; In another essay of his, he says &quot;The process of understanding literature is a living, breathing process. It may take centuries even. Understanding me is left to the future&quot;. Having said this, he quotes Bhavabhuti&#x27;s famous &quot;time is endless and the world is large&quot; statement in the foreword to his 1972 collection &quot;Vinaya&quot; and goes on to say that the statement is the maxim a poet has to live by until his readers garner the necessary &quot;cultural capital&quot; that is needed to understand his work. &quot;A critical examination of the work of a &quot;born poet&quot; can only be done by a &quot;born&quot; [literary] critic.&quot;

Bendre&#x27;s legacy as a popular poet remains secure, mostly on account of the immense popularity of Kannada&#x27;s bhaavageete tradition and his play with the Kannada language&#x27;s sound. His poetry, including his post-&quot;Naaku Tanti&quot; work, also continues to attract new writers and critics. Like Shankar Mokashi once said of Ambikatanayadatta, &quot;[he] will live on forever in Shri Bendre&#x27;s work. He will remain a favoured son of the world. As Shri Bendre himself once said about poetry: &#x27;Oh vision seen by the men of god!&#x27; To have known such a man of god is our good fortune; to attempt to understand him is futile: like &quot;Gommata&quot;, &#x27;ಅತ್ಯತಿಷ್ಠತ್ ದಶಾಂಗುಲಂ&#x27; (अत्यतिष्ठत् दशाङ्गुलं) – he stands ten &quot;angula&quot;s above us all.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In 1972, film director and playwright Girish Karnad directed a Kannada documentary film, &quot;Da Ra Bendre&quot;, for the Government of Karnataka. The script was written by Keertinath Kurtakoti. Bendre is also the primary character of the semi-fictional novel &quot;Dharawadada Dattu Master&quot; by N. K. Kulkarni.

<doc id="1311836" wikidata="Q7348019" url="?curid=1311836" title="Rob Newman (comedian)">
<text>Robert Newman (born 7 July 1964) is an English comedian, author and political activist. Newman found mainstream fame with &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot; before forming a successful partnership with one of the programme&#x27;s other comedians, David Baddiel, in the early 1990s.

In 1993, Newman and Baddiel became the first comedians to play and sell out the 12,000-seat Wembley Arena in London. Newman&#x27;s first speaking appearance was with Third World First (now known as People and Planet), the student political organisation.

== Early life and education==

Newman was adopted into a working-class family who lived in a Hertfordshire village. His adoptive father died when he was nine. Newman attended a comprehensive school, received poor A-level grades and was not offered a place at university until two years later, when he was admitted to Selwyn College, Cambridge, to read English on the strength of an essay about T. S. Eliot.

Newman has worked as a farmhand, warehouse-man, house-painter, teacher, mail-sorter, social worker and mover.

==Comedy career==
Newman began his comedy career as an impressionist in the late 1980s before gaining fame when he appeared alongside fellow Cambridge alumni David Baddiel, Hugh Dennis and Steve Punt in the BBC radio and TV programme &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot; (1989–92). The title referred to the main campaigner for &quot;moral decency&quot; on television, Mary Whitehouse. With &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot; Newman and Baddiel had become &quot;unlikely pin-ups as, in the early 1990s, comedy was being fêted as &#x27;the new rock and roll&#x27;,&quot; leading to their series, &quot;Newman and Baddiel in Pieces&quot; (1993).

The partnership with Baddiel was widely reported as being fraught with tension. Unlike most double acts, their shows (both on TV and stage) were characterised by the two alternately delivering monologues, rarely appearing together except in sketches (most famously, &quot;History Today&quot;). During the &quot;Live and in Pieces&quot; tour, relations deteriorated further and the Wembley Arena show was their last appearance together.

After the break-up, the two men took wildly differing career paths. While Baddiel became part of the &quot;new lad&quot; phenomenon of the mid-1990s, fronting shows like &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot;, Newman largely disappeared from public life, reappearing with solo work marked by a clear social conscience and anti-establishment views. He covered the anti-globalisation Seattle protests of 1999 for the UK&#x27;s Channel 4 News. He has been politically active with Reclaim the Streets, the Liverpool Dockers, Indymedia and People&#x27;s Global Action.

His later work is characterised by a very strong political element. It parallels the work of contemporaries such as Mark Thomas. In 2001, with actress Emma Thompson, he called for a boycott of the Perrier Comedy Award, because Perrier is owned by Nestlé who market powdered baby milk in developing countries; an alternative competition called the Tap Water Awards was set up the following year. In 2003, Newman toured with &quot;From Caliban to the Taliban&quot;, which was released on CD and DVD. In 2005, the show &quot;Apocalypso Now or, from P45 to AK47, How to Grow the Economy with the Use of War&quot; debuted at the Bongo Club during the 2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. &quot;Apocalypso Now&quot; toured nationally, sometimes as part of a double-bill where Newman was joined by Mark Thomas. The show was filmed at the Hoxton Hall in Hoxton, east London and shown on More4 under the title &quot;A History of Oil&quot;, with a later release on CD and DVD. A mixture of stand-up comedy and introductory lecture on geopolitics and peak oil, in &quot;Apocalypso Now&quot; Newman argues that twentieth-century Western foreign policy, including World War I, should be seen as a continuous struggle by the West to control Middle Eastern oil. Newman draws from Richard Heinberg&#x27;s book &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over: Oil, War, and the Fate of Industrial Societies&quot; as source material for portions of the show dealing with peak oil.

In 2006, Newman performed a new show, &quot;No Planet B or, The History of the World Backwards&quot;, at the Tricycle Theatre in Kilburn, north-west London. In 2007, the BBC commissioned a six-part series, &quot;The History of the World Backwards&quot; based on &quot;No Planet B&quot;, for transmission on BBC Four. The script of the stage version show is accessible on Newman&#x27;s official website.

In 2015, his BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Robert Newman&#x27;s Entirely Accurate Encyclopaedia of Evolution&quot; attempted to challenge some of the concepts of Richard Dawkins&#x27;s book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;. It won the &quot;Best Scripted Comedy with a Live Audience&quot; award at the 2017 BBC Audio Drama Awards.

==Writing==
Newman co-wrote &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience Encyclopedia&quot; (1991), with David Baddiel, Hugh Dennis, and Steve Punt.

He has written four novels: &quot;Dependence Day&quot; (1994); &quot;Manners&quot; (1998); &quot;The Fountain at the Centre of the World&quot; (2003); and &quot;The Trade Secret&quot; (2013).

In 2015 his book &quot;The Entirely Accurate Encyclopaedia of Evolution&quot;, based on his stand-up show &quot;Robert Newman&#x27;s New Theory of Evolution&quot;, was published by Freight Books.

In April 2017 his book &quot;Neuropolis&quot; was published by HarperCollins.

===&quot;The Fountain at the Centre of the World&quot;===
Dwight Garner, an editor of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, reviewed &quot;The Fountain at the Centre of the World&quot; favourably, saying &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised, in fact, if [it] became the talismanic &quot;Catch-22&quot; of the anti-globalisation protest movement, the fictional complement to Naomi Klein&#x27;s influential exposé &quot;No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies&quot;&quot;.

Newman&#x27;s process of writing the book was the subject of a 2008 BBC Two television documentary entitled &quot;Scribbling&quot;.

<text>Gimbel Brothers (known simply as Gimbels) was an American department store corporation that operated for over a century, from 1842 until 1987. Gimbel patriarch Adam Gimbel opened his first store in Vincennes, Indiana, in 1842. In 1887, the company moved its operations to the Gimbel Brothers Department Store in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It became a chain when it opened a second, larger store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1894, moving its headquarters there. At the urging of future company president Bernard Gimbel, grandson of the founder, the company expanded to New York City in 1910.

The company is known for creating the oldest Thanksgiving parade, the Gimbels Thanksgiving Day Parade, originating in 1920 in Philadelphia. Gimbels was also considered the chief rival of Macy&#x27;s with their feud popularized in American culture. As of 1930, Gimbels had grown to 20 stores, whose sales revenue made it the largest department store chain in the world. The company expanded to a peak of 53 stores by 1965, and closed in 1987 with 35 stores in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Connecticut.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

The company was founded by a young Bavarian Jewish immigrant, Adam Gimbel, who opened a general store in Vincennes, Indiana. After a brief stay in Danville, Illinois, Gimbel relocated in 1887 to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which was then a boomtown heavily populated by German immigrants. The new store quickly became the leading department store there. However, with seven sons, Adam Gimbel saw the opportunity to expand elsewhere.

In 1894, Gimbels—then led by the founder&#x27;s son, Isaac Gimbel—acquired the Granville Haines store (originally built and operated by Cooper and Conard) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and in 1910, opened another branch in New York City. With its arrival in New York, Gimbels prospered, and soon became the primary rival to the leading Herald Square retailer, Macy&#x27;s, whose flagship store was located a block north. This rivalry entered into the American popular argot as &quot;&quot;, an idiom used to brush off any query about matters the speaker didn&#x27;t wish to divulge. To distinguish itself from Herald Square neighbors, Gimbels&#x27; advertising promised more: &quot;Select, don&#x27;t settle.&quot;

Gimbels became so successful that in 1922 the chain went public, offering shares on the New York Stock Exchange (though the family retained a controlling interest). The stock sales provided capital for expansion, starting with the 1923 purchase of across-the-street rival Saks &amp; Co., which operated under the name Saks-34th Street; with ownership of Saks, Gimbel created an uptown branch called Saks Fifth Avenue. Moving into radio, Gimbels purchased WGBS in New York and WIP in Philadelphia. In 1925, Gimbels entered the Pittsburgh market with the purchase of Kaufmann &amp; Baer&#x27;s, acquiring WCAE in the deal. Although expansion spurred talk of the stores becoming a nationwide chain, the Great Depression ended that prospect. Gimbel did increase the number of more upscale (and enormously profitable) Saks Fifth Avenue stores in the 1930s, opening branches in Chicago, Boston and San Francisco.

=== Success ===
By 1930, Gimbels had seven flagship stores throughout the country and sales of $123 million ($ billion today) across 20 stores; this made Gimbel Brothers Inc. the largest department store corporation in the world. By 1953, sales had risen to $300 million ($ billion today). In 1962, Gimbels acquired Milwaukee competitor Schuster&#x27;s, and in that region operated stores from both chains for a while as Gimbels Schuster&#x27;s. By 1965, Gimbel Brothers Inc. consisted of 53 stores throughout the country, which included 22 Gimbels, 27 Saks Fifth Avenue stores, and four Saks 34th St.

==== Gimbels and the middle class ====
Gimbels&#x27; principles and merchandise sought to reflect the ideals of middle class America. Their principles consisted of &quot;courtesy, reliability, good value, and enlightened management&quot;. By using middle class values Gimbels attracted shoppers to a store that also could fit their budgets. Keeping the store plain and less extravagant than some of its competitors, Gimbels used the slogan &quot;the customer pays for fancy frills.&quot; Gimbels was about the product, not the aesthetics. By offering a wide range of cutting-edge technology in its merchandise, Gimbels reflected the ideals held by the middle class of staying up to date with technologies and carrying new appliances and merchandise at an affordable price.

==== Merchandise ====
Gimbels Department Store offered a variety of merchandise and products, including home appliances, outdoor equipment, furniture, clothing, and much more. With multiple floors in its flagship stores, each floor offered a given category of merchandise. The Philadelphia Gimbels specifically offered fine jewelry, men&#x27;s clothing, women&#x27;s clothing, children&#x27;s clothing, furniture, toys, art supplies, and appliances for the house. This store also contained The Gimbel Auditorium, Television Headquarters, a salon, and music center. With a wide variety of options Gimbels was a one stop shop that made shopping easy and accessible.

==== Publicity ====
Despite its limited presence, Gimbels was well-known nationwide, in part because of the carefully cultivated rivalry with Macy&#x27;s, but also thanks to an endless stream of publicity. The New York store received considerable attention as the site of the 1939–1940 sale of art and antiquities from the William Randolph Hearst collection. Gimbels also gained publicity from the 1947 film &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;, the 1967 film &quot;Fitzwilly&quot;, and was frequently mentioned as a shopping destination of Lucy Ricardo and Ethel Mertz on the hit 1950s TV series &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

The Slinky made its debut at the northeast Philadelphia Gimbels store. The Philadelphia Gimbels was also the first department store in the world to move customers from floor to floor via the escalator.

==== Gimbels Thanksgiving Day Parade ====

The idea of a department-store parade originated in 1920 with Gimbels Department Store in Philadelphia with the parade now known as the 6abc Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade. The Gimbel family saw the parade as a way to promote holiday shopping at its various store locations. Macy&#x27;s did not start a parade until 1924. When Gimbels ceased operating in 1986, television station WPVI assumed responsibility for the parade, with sponsorship by Reading, Pennsylvania–based Boscov&#x27;s. Currently, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts is the chief sponsor of the parade.

=== Acquisition and closure ===
Brown &amp; Williamson, the American subsidiary of British American Tobacco, a diversified conglomerate based in Louisville, Kentucky, acquired Gimbels in 1973. Brown &amp; Williamson also owned Marshall Field&#x27;s (purchased in 1982), Frederick &amp; Nelson, The Crescent stores, and Kohl&#x27;s (purchased in 1972). Brown &amp; Williamson later created the BATUS Retail Group as a subsidiary company for its retail holdings.

BATUS initially left the Gimbels chain in the four autonomous divisions that had been established under Gimbel family ownership: Gimbels New York, Gimbels Philadelphia, Gimbels Pittsburgh, and Gimbels Milwaukee. Each division operated independently of each other in advertising and buying. Each division offered their own charge card which could only be used at Gimbels stores in the same division. In 1983, Gimbels New York and Gimbels Philadelphia were combined into a single entity, Gimbels East, in an attempt to reduce corporate overhead.

Deciding that Gimbels was a marginal performer with little potential for increased profitability, BATUS in 1986 decided to close its Gimbels division and sell its store properties. Some of the more attractive branches were taken over by Stern&#x27;s (Allied Stores), Pomeroy&#x27;s (Allied Stores), Kaufmann&#x27;s (May Department Stores), or Boston Store. The cornerstone of the chain, the downtown Milwaukee store where Adam Gimbel had first found success (and supposedly the most profitable Gimbel store), was handed to BATUS sister division Marshall Field&#x27;s, but eventually closed in 1997.

== Store divisions ==
Gimbels flagship stores were located in New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee.

=== New York flagship store ===
The Gimbels New York City flagship store was located in the cluster of large department stores that surrounded Herald Square, in Midtown Manhattan. Designed by architect Daniel Burnham, the structure, which once offered of sales space, has since been modernized and entirely revamped. When this building opened, on September 29, 1910, a major selling point was its many doors leading to the Herald Square New York City Subway station. Due to such easy access, by the time Gimbels closed in 1986, this store had the highest rate of &quot;shrinkage&quot;, or shoplifting losses, in the world. Doors also opened to a pedestrian passage under 32nd Street, connecting Penn Station to the 34th Street (New York City Subway) and 33rd Street (PATH) stations. This Gimbels Passageway was closed in the 1990s for security reasons during a period of high crime.

The structure was converted in 1989 to A&amp;S Plaza, a mall named for its anchor department store, a midtown branch of Brooklyn&#x27;s A&amp;S. The store became a Stern&#x27;s in 1995, and the mall was renamed Manhattan Mall. The anchor store closed in 2001 and the space was subdivided within the mall, while the upper levels were converted to offices. A new JCPenney anchor store opened in 2009, in the lower two levels. That anchor store closed in 2020 and by 2021 all stores in the mall had closed, and the building served only as office space.

The building that housed a Gimbels branch at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue remains, but has been converted to apartments.

=== Philadelphia flagship ===
The Philadelphia flagship opened in 1893 when the Gimbel brothers bought the bankrupt Haines and Company dry goods store at Ninth and Market Streets. The store gradually expanded eastward to Eighth Street. In 1927 an extension south to Chestnut Street was completed and the store now comprised an entire city block, making it for a time the largest department store in the world. In 1977 Gimbels moved to The Gallery mall across Market Street. The original buildings were demolished in 1979-1980 except for the 1927 addition which was converted to professional office spaces, primarily a data center and medical offices. The Gallery location closed in 1986.

=== Pittsburgh flagship ===
In Pittsburgh, Starrett &amp; van Vleck designed the downtown flagship of the Gimbels Department Store, which was built in 1914 at 339 Sixth Avenue. After Gimbels ceased operations in the late 1980s, the building sat vacant for several years and was redeveloped in the 1990s for retail, home to, among other shops, the first Barnes &amp; Noble to open in Pittsburgh. In 2002, another redevelopment changed the building to offices, and is now home to the Heinz 57 Center. In 1997, it was added to the list of historic landmarks by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation.

=== Relationship to Saks ===
Saks was founded by Horace Saks in New York City. In 1923, Gimbels purchased Saks, which became a subsidiary of Gimbel Brothers, Incorporated, a publicly traded company. Adam Long Gimbel, grandson of the founder of Gimbels, Adam Gimbel, turned Saks into a national brand. In 1973, Brown &amp; Williamson, who later formed BATUS Inc., acquired Gimbel Bros. and the Saks Fifth Avenue brand. BATUS closed Gimbels in 1986, and subsequently sold Saks to Investcorp S.A. in 1990.

<text>Shapiro, and its variations such as Shapira, Schapiro, Schapira, Sapir, Sapira, Spira, Spiro, Sapiro, Szapiro/Szpiro in Polish and Chapiro in French (more at &quot;See also&quot;), is a Jewish Ashkenazi surname.

== Etymology ==
The surname is derived from Spira, the medieval name of Speyer in Germany; compare with Spire, the French name for that city. Other name variants based on the city name &quot;Spira&quot; include Spira, Spire, Spiro, Spear, Szpir, Szpiro, Spero, Sapir, Sapiro, Chapiro and Sprai. The Jewish community of Speyer was one of three leading cities central to the development of Ashkenazi culture, referred to as the , an acronym based on the names of the cities of Speyer/Spira, Worms and Mainz. The family name Speyer (based on the modern German name for the same city) has also become a well-known surname that was spread by Jews from Frankfurt to England, the United States and Canada in the late 19th and early 20th century.

<doc id="1311841" wikidata="Q2185932" url="?curid=1311841" title="Stonesfield">
<text>Stonesfield is a village and civil parish about north of Witney in Oxfordshire, and about 10 miles (17 km) north-west of Oxford. The village is on the crest of an escarpment. The parish extends mostly north and north-east of the village, in which directions the land rises gently and then descends to the River Glyme at Glympton and Wootton about to the north-east. South of Stonesfield, below the escarpment, is the River Evenlode which touches the southern edge of the parish. At the centre of Stonesfield stands the 13th-century church of St James the Great as well as a Wesleyan chapel, Stonesfield Methodist Church, slightly further west. The village is known for Stonesfield slate, a form of Cotswold stone mined particularly as a roofing stone and also a rich source of fossils. The architecture in Stonesfield features many old Cotswold stone properties roofed with locally mined slate along with some late 20th-century buildings and several properties under construction. The 2011 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 1,527.

==Name==
The Domesday Book of 1086 records Stonesfield as , meaning &quot;fool&#x27;s field&quot;. It was still spelt &quot;Stunsfield&quot; as late as 1712 and &quot;Stuntesfield&quot; in 1854 before mutating to its present place name under the influence of the fame of the Roman mosaic discovered in one of its fields, its slate quarries, and the dinosaur fossils discovered there.

==Geology==

Stonesfield is on the Taynton Limestone Formation, a type of Cotswold stone that until the 20th century was mined as a roofing stone called Stonesfield slate. It is common on roofs of older buildings in the Cotswolds and Oxfordshire. Many of the older buildings of the University of Oxford have Stonesfield slate roofs. The quarries were also one of Britain&#x27;s richest sources of Middle Jurassic vertebrate fossils. 

==History==

Under Roman rule, a road was constructed from Watling Street just north of the former Catuvellauni capital Verlamion (Roman Verulamium and modern St Albans) to the Dobunni capital Corinium (modern Cirencester), probably incorporating older British trails. Because Fosse Way continued to Aquae Sulis (Bath), known as Aquamannia in the early Middle Ages, this major thoroughfare became known as Akeman Street. The portion of the road passing just southeast of Stonesfield is now preserved as part of the Oxfordshire Way. Due east of the modern village, a major Roman villa was built just north of the road, probably in the 3rd or 4th century although coins as early as the 1st-century reign of Vespasian were possibly discovered nearby. It has been variously identified as the home of a wealthy Romanized Briton, the estate of an officer of the Romano-British rebel Allectus, and the estate of an officer of Count Theodosius and his imperial dynasty. About south of Stonesfield, on the other side of the River Evenlode and in the next parish, the remains of the North Leigh Roman Villa survive in the care of English Heritage.
Lying near Oxford University, Stonesfield&#x27;s slate quarries produced the first fossils to be formally identified as those of a non-avian dinosaur. A partial femur found in 1676 was published by Robert Plot as belonging to a Roman war elephant and then to a Biblical giant; the specimen was lost but later identified from Plot&#x27;s illustration and description as belonging to a megalosaur. Other Stonesfield fossils were acquired by the physician Christopher Pegge, the chemist John Kidd, and the geologist William Buckland. With guidance by the French anatomist Georges Cuvier, Buckland eventually realized they came from a bipedal lizard-like carnivore unlike any now living, publishing his description in 1824 with the name &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, the &quot;great Fossil Lizard of Stonesfield&quot;. The fossils used by Buckland are now displayed at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Other species later found at Stonesfield include the crocodile &quot;Steneosaurus&quot;, the pterosaur &quot;Rhamphocephalus&quot;, and the type specimens of the theropod genus &quot;Iliosuchus&quot; and the quadruped &quot;Stereognathus&quot;. This last species belongs to the cynodont clade, a form of protomammal.

On 25 January 1712, a tenant farmer named George Handes or Hannes rediscovered the old Roman villa while plowing the Chesthill Acre fields. He tricked his landlord, Richard Fowler of Great Barrington, Gloucestershire, into allowing him to dig around his fields before revealing what he had found, leading to a prolonged dispute over ownership and the rights to income from the many visitors who came from Oxford and abroad. Ultimately, three large mosaics were uncovered, the largest of which featured the Roman god Bacchus holding a thyrsus and riding a panther. Oxford academics and their guests destroyed these, removing fragments piecemeal as souvenirs, although Thomas Hearne, Bernard Gardiner, and others created illustrations and descriptions while it was still largely whole and the Ashmolean Museum was able to acquire some hypocaust flue-tiles and the base of a pillar. The antiquaries William Stukeley and Richard Gough blamed the destruction on the tenant&#x27;s maliciousness and &quot;the mob, who refused to pay for seeing it&quot;; the owners were also accused of salting the site with additional coins from other sources once they saw the profit from their original discoveries. The site was neglected after the initial interest waned, however, as late as 1780 the antiquarian Daines Barrington reported that the mosaic found in 1712 survived &quot;in tolerable preservation&quot;. Around that time, a second excavation took place, revealing a smaller room and parts of the villa&#x27;s baths. The careless enclosure of Stonefield&#x27;s common lands in 1801 caused the site of the Roman villa to be divided among 3 different owners, who seem to have quickly removed the last of the known ruins. By 1806, Gough&#x27;s new edition of William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; reported it &quot;destroyed, except some of the borders... and part of the corners&quot;; James Brewer&#x27;s 1813 &quot;Beauties of England and Wales&quot; noted that even the relics on the Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s new land had not been preserved; and John Yonge Akerman found it &quot;totally destroyed&quot; by 1858. Despite George Allen&#x27;s interest in aerial archaeology around Oxfordshire, he never bothered to photograph the site.

==Church and chapels==

===Church of England===

The Church of England parish church of St James the Great was built in the 13th century. Surviving Early English features from that period include the chancel arch, north chapel, south aisle, arcade and piscina and most of the west tower. Decorated Gothic remodelling in the 14th century includes the piscina and south windows of the chancel, the north window and west arch of the north chapel and the east window of the south aisle. The octagonal font is also 14th-century. In the 15th century the west tower was increased in height.

Between the chancel and north chapel is a screen that is partly Perpendicular Gothic. The Perpendicular Gothic east window in the chancel is 15th-century. Fragments of 15th-century stained glass survive in the window, including a figure that has a 14th-century head and may represent Saint Peter, and symbols of the evangelists St John and St Mark. In the west window of the west tower is late-15th-century stained glass of four family coats of arms. In one of the south windows of the chancel is 16th-century stained glass of two coats of arms: one of a manorial family and the other of the Worshipful Company of Mercers. There is also mid-16th-century stained glass of two family coats of arms in one of the 17th-century south windows of the clerestory. The Jacobean pulpit was made in 1629.

In 1743 a clock was installed in the church. It was said to have been made for a local manor house in 1543, and transferred to the church after the house was demolished. The clock has since been moved from Stonesfield, rebuilt, and installed at Judd&#x27;s Garage at Wootton. In 1825 the north aisle was greatly enlarged, opening directly into the nave without an arcade. This greatly changed the interior of the church, and in the 20th century the architectural historians Jennifer Sherwood and Sir Nikolaus Pevsner condemned the change as &quot;lunatic&quot;. Other 19th-century changes include the addition of the south porch, possibly during a restoration in 1876. The vestry was added in 1956. The church is a Grade II* listed building St James&#x27; parish is now part of the Benefice of Stonesfield with Combe Longa.

===Methodist===
Stonesfield Methodist Church is a Wesleyan chapel with capacity for 100 people, located at the junction of Boot Street and High Street.

The current church was first opened for worship in July 1867 and still remains in use today. The current Reverend is Rev Rose Westwood, Witney and Farringdon Circuit Superintendent and Minister for Long Hanborough, Charlbury, Stonesfield, and Sutton Churches.

The church contains a four and a half octave single keyboard organ with foot pedals and seven stops. It bears two plaques recording two last members who helped arrange for its purchase and installation; both plaques are dedicated to the Glory of God 30 April 1966.
==Economic and social history==

For centuries the parish had one main open field for arable farming: Home Field, which was east of the village. Three others, Church Field, Callowe, and Jenner&#x27;s Sarts, were much smaller, and an early 17th-century survey records that not every farmer had strips in Church Field. In 1232 the parish almost doubled in size by acquiring King&#x27;s Wood, a nearby detached part of Bloxham parish. It was in this wood that people from Stonesfield created Callowe by clearing woodland, a process called assarting. By the time of the Hundred Rolls in the 1270s, every tenant in Stonesfield held assarted land.

By the first decade of the 17th century Stonesfield had at least four fields. Church Field is taken to be ancient like Home Field, but Jenner&#x27;s Sarts was created by felling in Gerner&#x27;s Wood. It is not clear whether this field is the same as that called Gannett&#x27;s Sarte in another source. By 1792 very little of Stonesfield&#x27;s common land had been enclosed, and most of it was still worked by arable strip farming. By 1797 most of this had been enclosed and converted to pasture. Some common land remained in the parts of the parish closest to the village, but this was enclosed in a land award of 1804.

==Amenities==
===Public houses===
Over the years Stonesfield has had between seven and ten pubs; however, since 2010 only one has remained open.

==== The White Horse ====

The White Horse, Stonesfield&#x27;s final pub, is at the top of the village green on The Ridings. The pub has served the community since its opening in 1876, despite an extended period of closure between 2020 and 2023. Previously called the White Lion, from 1847 its licensee was John Lardner, who lived in one of the three cottages making up the pub&#x27;s buildings. Following John&#x27;s death in September 1865 the licence was transferred to his son, Henry Lardner, in October 1865. This was the first mention of the name &#x27;White Horse&#x27;. The White Horse was sold at auction after it was advertised on 28 October 1876. The listing had the description:

&#x27;A stone-built and slated free public house, called or known by the name of &quot;The White Horse,&quot; situate in the village of Stonesfield, and containing 2 front rooms, tap room, pantry, scullery, cellar 3 bed rooms, and 1 attic; together with the 2 Cottages adjoining (but unoccupied). Detached are a Brew-house, large Shop with extensive cellarage underneath, Stable, Barn, Wagon Hovel, Cow Shed, Poultry Pen, Piggery, and Cattle Yard; together with capital Garden Ground at the back and in the front of the house.
The Outgoings are Quit Rents amounting to 1s. yearly.&#x27;

From 1876 to 1907 various landlords took on the role of running the pub until the licence was passed on to the Oliver family. The family ran it from 1907 under Edward Oliver until 1962 under Minnie Oliver. The &quot;Witney Gazette&quot; referenced Vivian and Emily Miles&#x27; retirement from the pub&#x27;s ownership in June 1977. During the 1980s Nigel Bishop ran the White Horse. During this period, much like Sturdy&#x27;s Castle on the Banbury Road (A4260) and the King&#x27;s Head in the centre of Woodstock, the White Horse Inn became a &#x27;Spud Pub&#x27;. After a period of closure between 2001 and 2005, it was bought by a Londoner called Richard Starowki. He restored the pub and reopened it in 2006. Three years later, in 2009, John Lloyd bought the pub from Starowki. 

During the March 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in England, the pub was forced to close. The owner, John Lloyd, listed it for sale that July. Local residents formed a community benefit society to attempt to raise money to save the pub via a shared ownership concept. £430,000 was eventually raised. Despite this, a private sale took place in early 2021. The new owner said he planned to reopen the pub; however, concerns arose from his background as a property developer. The pub was bought by the community in 2023 and reopened as a pop-up pub. The pub was then closed for repair and refurbishment in January 2024, with a plan to fully reopen later in the year. On 1 June 2024, Craig Tipper and his business partner Barbara took over tenancy over the pub, with the aim of creating “a proper pub that’s accessible to everyone”. On Friday 14 June 2024, The White Horse was fully reopened as a community-owned pub, with a new website and menu.

==== The Black Head ====

Originally named The Black Boy, The Black Head was a pub on Church Street. The pub burnt down in around 1850 during the ownership of Thomas Stewart. This was the cause of the name change to The Black Head when it was rebuilt soon afterwards, the name sticking until the pub ceased trading in 2010. During the 21st century the pub was owned by the Nomura Bank of Japan, owner of the Wellington Pub Company. Its latest owner applied in 2012 and 2014 for planning permission to turn the Black Head into a private house. The building is now a private residence.
==== The Chequers ====
The Chequers is another pub in the village that is now a private residence. It was on the south of Laughton&#x27;s Hill and was allegedly a popular pub with entertainers travelling through Stonesfield. The Chequers was open from 1753 until 1847.

==== The Maltster and Shovel ====
The Maltster &amp; Shovel, on High Street, was open from 1831 to 1939 and is now also a private residence.

==== The Marlborough Arms ====

A public house which now forms part of Prospect Villa, The Marlborough Arms, opened on the Woodstock Road in 1838 and served customers until 1875.

==== The Rose and Crown ====
The Rose &amp; Crown also previously stood on the High Street; however, it was demolished in 1958 to make way for a new school playground and, 34 years later, five low-cost houses were built there.
==== The Swan Inn ====
The Swan Inn is thought to have been up the Tewer and served from around 1865 until 1877, although evidence is limited especially compared to the other Stonesfield pubs.

==== The Churchill Arms ====
The Churchill Arms is another public house with limited information regarding its details. The &quot;Oxford Journal&quot; mentioned the pub in 1826 and 1828 regarding the auction of an &#x27;estate at Stonesfield&#x27;.

==== The Boot Inn ====
The Boot Inn was also among Stonesfield&#x27;s previous pubs. Mr Vivian Miles and his wife, Emily, ran the pub from 1952 until 1962 before taking ownership of the White Horse Inn up the road for a further 15 years.

==== The Pick and Hammer ====
The Pick and Hammer pub is said to have been at the bottom of Well Lane. Records are also limited in regard to this pub; however, the cottage gained notoriety in the 1990s from a police incident involving a search for the body of a murdered woman. Michael Morton, a millionaire and architect by trade, was jailed for seven years in 1997 following his conviction for the murder of Gracia, his 40-year-old wife.

===Other amenities===

==== Village hall and Stonesfield Sports and Social Club ====

Stonesfield Village Hall is at the end of Field Close, next to the library, play park, and football pitch. Stonesfield Sports &amp; Social Club opened on 23 July 1995 after 10 years of fundraising £65,000 for an extension to the village hall. The Main Hall can accommodate up to 200 people. The community hall contains a stage, small 50-capacity club room, kitchen and has a car-parking area outside. Stonesfield Parish Council meetings are regularly held at the village hall. The library next door, Stonesfield Library, is a small community library run by Oxfordshire County Council and supported by the Friends of Stonesfield Library (FoSL).
==== Sports pitch and playground ====
The adjacent sports pitch accommodates cricket and football matches as well as three tennis courts in the far north corner. This is the home ground of Stonesfield Strikers F.C., a youth football club with a number of mixed-sex and girls-only teams.

During this time the shop was voted best Oxfordshire village shop in 2006. The shop is now run by Mathon Sabapathy and his wife. The shop now contains a Royal Mail post office following its move from next to St James the Great Church. Adjacent to the shop is a hairdresser called Salon Copenhagen.

==== Callow Farm Shop ====

The farm shop was run by Dave Holloway and offered a range of produce ranging from home reared meat to freshly harvested vegetables however it was well known for its free range Bronze Christmas Turkeys which are still sold every Christmas. The farm shop permanently closed on 30 April 2015, mainly due to financial pressures. The holiday accommodation remains functional.

==== St James’ Centre ====
Found on the High Street opposite Stonesfield Primary School and behind St James the Great Church, The St James’ Centre, previously the village school, is used for exhibitions, workshops, education classes for adults, meetings, family gatherings, fundraising events and children’s parties. The centre belongs to Stonesfield Parish Church and sits on the edge of the church’s grounds. The modernised centre includes a main hall, kitchen, sitting room, patio, 3 smaller rooms, garden, and a car park.

==== Allotments ====
Stonesfield Allotment Association, chaired by Jon Gordon, controls the allotments within the village. Churchfield Allotment is an allotment in the south of Stonesfield extending down into Stonesfield Common. The allotment&#x27;s plot is about in length by in width. Having raised over £3000, in February 2019 the allotment holders helped to instal the infrastructure needed for four new water troughs to be installed to supply the allotment with fresh water via the Thames Water network. The second, slightly smaller allotment plot is the Woodstock Road site located in the north east reaches of Stonesfield, surrounded by fields.

==== 1st Stonesfield Scouts ====

1st Stonesfield Scouts are a Beaver, Cubs and Scout group running in Stonesfield since 1948. The group caters for local children between the ages of 6 and 14 and has over 100 members with some getting put on a waiting list due to high demand. The Stonesfield Scout Hut, known as Andy&#x27;s Den, was in Stonesfield Common’s woods at Stockey Bottom and could be found by taking a path off Church Fields opposite St James the Great Graveyard in the south west of Stonesfield. The scout hut was originally temporary wartime accommodation at RAF Bicester. In 1958 it was dismantled and transported via lorry to its new location. The site was demolished and cleared in late 2019 due to factors such as asbestos related health concerns, rodent infestations, and inadequate facilities. The group now aim to build a new Outdoor Education and Environmental Wellbeing Centre, fundraising for a target of £175,000.

==== The &quot;Stonesfield Slate&quot; ====

The &quot;Stonesfield Slate&quot;, often known simply as the &quot;Slate&quot;, is Stonesfield&#x27;s monthly village magazine named after the famous slate found in the village. It is produced and delivered by volunteers. All residents of the village have the option of being delivered a copy every month for free although physical copies are also available at the village shop and library and a digital archive of all issues can be found on Stonesfield&#x27;s official Parish Council website. The Bodleian Library, who believe the Slate to be one of the longest running local magazines, keeps copies of the publication for its archive.

The &quot;Slate&quot; was founded in December 1976 by Gordon Rudlin who wanted a newsletter which gave details about village events as he kept hearing about things after they had taken place. There have been four publishers since 2020. Richard and Dale Morris took over from Gordon in January 1998 and held the publisher role for the next seven years, bringing the publication fully into the digital age. Jenny and Simon Haviland were presented with a framed Stonesfield slate on 29 February 2020 to celebrate the 500th issue of the publication and recognise their efforts as publishers of the magazine since 2004. In response to the Havilands stepping down, Diane and Paul Bates took over as publishers from January 2020. The front page of each issue formerly had the words &quot;With or without offence to friends or foes We sketch your world exactly as it goes.&quot; Since the personal computer hadn&#x27;t been invented yet, the &quot;Slate&quot; was originally typed on a mimeograph stencil on a manual typewriter. To get the project going, Rudlin asked the Village Hall committee and various village residents for sponsorship and to volunteer as editors, typists, printers and deliverers. For many years Rachel Sherlaw Johnson&#x27;s illustrations were included in small otherwise empty spaces in each issue of the magazine. On 15 June 1990 the publication won a certificate of merit in the Oxfordshire Village Ventures Competition 1988–89. The &quot;Slate&quot; had a full page photographic cover for the first time to celebrate the start of the new millennium. It was by luck that it happened to snow the day of the deadline for that issue. January 2009 is the only other time a photographic cover has been used.

==== Other ====
There was previously a skittle alley at the top of Pond Hill on The Ridings, next to The White Horse pub. Its owner, John Lloyd, received opposition to his plans to turn it into a house next to the pub which he also owned. The skittle alley is no longer present.

Stonesfield also has a Women&#x27;s Institute; meetings are held monthly in Stonesfield Village Hall.

<text>Gibraltar Point national nature reserve is an area of about on the coast of Lincolnshire, England.

The reserve is owned by Lincolnshire County Council and East Lindsey District Council and is administered by the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve comprises two parallel ridges of sand dunes—the &quot;east dunes&quot; and the &quot;west dunes&quot;—separated by about half a kilometre (550 yards) of salt marsh; and an area on the seaward side with further salt marsh and sand, shingle and muddy beaches. The reserve extends for a distance of about along the coast, from the southern end of Skegness to the northern corner of The Wash (Gibraltar Point itself is at the southernmost tip, and marks the point where the North Sea coast turns southwest towards Boston). A golf course occupies much of the west dunes (the inland side) at the Skegness end of the area. Gibraltar Point is an area of coastal deposition—at the end of the 18th century the west dunes were by the shore, but they are now a kilometre inland.

In 2016 a new visitor centre opened at the southern end of the reserve to replace the previous one which had been damaged by Cyclone Xaver. There are numerous paths around the area, and several artificial lakes and hides. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust also owns an old farm and land just inshore of the west dunes at the southern end of the reserve, again with an artificial lake and hides. Revenue from car parks assists in the upkeep of the area.

Gibraltar Point is part of the twice daily inshore waters forecast in the extended form of the Shipping Forecast broadcast on BBC Radio 4.

The reserve&#x27;s importance is recognised by its various designations:
*SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest)
*NNR (national nature reserve)
*Ramsar wetland site (wetland of international importance)
*SPA (Special Protection Area).

==Flora and fauna==
===Birds===
The reserve is home to a great variety of birdlife, mostly wildfowl, waders and gulls. The geography of the area, at the northern mouth of The Wash, makes the reserve very popular with migrant birds and many nationally rare species have been recorded. A total of 325 bird species have been recorded at the site as of 2021, the highest such total for any site in Lincolnshire. Recently, these have included black stork, pallid harrier, caspian tern, red-flanked bluetail and rustic bunting during 2015, and broad-billed sandpiper, black-winged pratincole and great reed warbler in 2014.

Notable breeding birds at the site include little tern, common shelduck, ringed plover, oystercatcher and common redshank, whilst the site is of international significance for overwintering wader species such as oystercatcher, grey plover, red knot, sanderling and bar-tailed godwit. Nationally important numbers of ringed plover also overwinter.

The site is home to a bird observatory, which has studied bird migration in the area since April 1949.
===Flora===
Gibraltar Point has the northernmost colony of sea heath in Britain.

<text>Inter-Integrated Circuit Sound (I²S, pronounced &quot;eye-squared-ess&quot;) is a serial interface protocol for transmitting two-channel, digital audio as pulse-code modulation (PCM) between integrated circuit (IC) components of an electronic device. An I²S bus separates clock and serial data signals, resulting in simpler receivers than those required for asynchronous communications systems that need to recover the clock from the data stream. Alternatively, I²S is spelled I2S (pronounced eye-two-ess) or IIS (pronounced eye-eye-ess). Despite a similar name, I²S is unrelated to I²C.

==History==
The protocol standard was introduced in 1986 by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors) and was first revised June 5, 1996. The standard was last revised on February 17, 2022 and updated terms &quot;master&quot; and &quot;slave&quot; to &quot;controller&quot; and &quot;target&quot;.

== Details ==

As shown in the diagram, the protocol requires the following lines:
* Serial clock (SCK), a.k.a. bit clock (BCLK).
* Word select (WS); a.k.a. left-right clock (LRCLK) or frame sync (FS). 0 = Left channel, 1 = Right channel
* Serial data (SD), a.k.a. SDATA, SDIN, SDOUT, DACDAT, ADCDAT

The protocol may also include the following lines:
* Master clock (typically 256 x LRCLK); not part of the standard, but is commonly included for synchronizing the internal operation of the analog/digital converters 
* A multiplexed data line for upload

The bit clock pulses once for each discrete bit of data on the data lines. The bit clock frequency is the product of the sample rate, the number of bits per channel and the number of channels. So, for example, CD Audio with a sample frequency of 44.1 kHz, with 16 bits of precision and two channels (stereo) has a bit clock frequency of:

:44.1 kHz × 16 × 2 = 1.4112 MHz

The word select clock lets the device know whether channel 1 (WS = 0) or channel 2 (WS = 1) is currently being sent, because I²S allows two channels to be sent on the same data line. It is a 50% duty-cycle signal that has the same frequency as the sample frequency. For stereo material, the I²S specification states that left audio is transmitted on the low cycle of the word select clock and the right channel is transmitted on the high cycle. It is typically synchronized to the falling edge of the serial clock, as the data is latched on the rising edge. The word select clock changes one bit clock period before the MSB is transmitted. This enables, for example, the receiver to store the previous word and clear the input for the next.

Data is signed, encoded as two&#x27;s complement with the MSB (most significant bit) first. This allows the number of bits per frame to be arbitrary, with no negotiation required between transmitter and receiver.

== As an audio interconnect ==
In audio equipment, I²S is sometimes used as an external link between a CD player or digital audio streaming device and an external digital-to-analog converter, as opposed to a purely internal connection within one player box. This may form an alternative to the commonly used AES/EBU, Toslink or S/PDIF standards.

The I²S connection was not intended to be used via cables, and most integrated circuits will not have the correct impedance for coaxial cables. As the impedance adaptation error associated with the different line lengths can cause differences in propagation delay between the clock line and data line, this can result in synchronization problems between the SCK, WS and data signals, mainly at high sampling frequencies and bitrates. As the I²S bus doesn&#x27;t have any error detection mechanism, this can cause significant decoding errors.

There is no standard interconnecting cable for this application. Some manufacturers simply provide three BNC connectors, an 8P8C (&quot;RJ45&quot;) socket or a DE-9 connector. Others like Audio Alchemy (now defunct) used DIN connectors. PS Audio, Musica Pristina and Wyred4Sound use an HDMI connector. Dutch manufacturer Van Medevoort has implemented Q-link in some of its equipment, which transfers I²S over 4 RCA connectors (data, MCK, LRCK, BCK).

<doc id="1311849" wikidata="Q430967" url="?curid=1311849" title="Edward Ruscha">
<text>Edward Joseph Ruscha IV (, &quot;roo-SHAY&quot;; born December 16, 1937) is an American artist associated with the pop art movement. He has worked in the media of painting, printmaking, drawing, photography, and film. He is also noted for creating several artist&#x27;s books. Ruscha lives and works in Culver City, California.

==Early life and education==
Ruscha was born into a Roman Catholic family in Omaha, Nebraska, with an older sister, Shelby, and a younger brother, Paul. Edward Ruscha, Sr. was an auditor for Hartford Insurance Company. Ruscha&#x27;s mother was supportive of her son&#x27;s early signs of artistic skill and interests. Young Ruscha was attracted to cartooning and would sustain this interest throughout his adolescent years. Though born in Nebraska, Ruscha lived some 15 years in Oklahoma City before moving to Los Angeles in 1956 where he studied at the Chouinard Art Institute (now known as the California Institute of the Arts) under Robert Irwin and Emerson Woelffer from 1956 through 1960. While at Chouinard, Ruscha edited and produced the journal &quot;Orb&quot; (1959–60) together with Joe Goode, Emerson Woelffer, Stephan von Huene, Jerry McMillan, and others. As a result, &quot;Orb&quot; became one of the U.S.&#x27; first recorded alternative newspapers.

In 1961, Ruscha spent seven months traveling through Europe. After graduation, Ruscha took a job as a layout artist for the Carson-Roberts advertising agency in Los Angeles.

By the early 1960s he was well known for his paintings, collages, and photographs, and for his association with the Ferus Gallery group, which also included artists Robert Irwin, John Altoon, John McCracken, Larry Bell, Ken Price, and Edward Kienholz. He worked as layout designer for &quot;Artforum&quot; magazine under the pseudonym &quot;Eddie Russia&quot; from 1965 to 1969 and taught at UCLA as a visiting professor for printing and drawing in 1969. He is also a lifelong friend of guitarist Mason Williams.

==Work==
Ruscha achieved recognition for paintings incorporating words and phrases and for his many photographic books, all influenced by the deadpan irreverence of the Pop Art movement. His textual, flat paintings have been linked with both the Pop Art movement and the beat generation.

===Early influences===
While in school in 1957, Ruscha chanced upon then unknown Jasper Johns&#x27; &quot;Target with Four Faces&quot; in the magazine &quot;Print&quot; and was greatly moved. Ruscha has credited this artist&#x27;s work as a source of inspiration for his change of interest from graphic arts to painting. He was also impacted by John McLaughlin&#x27;s paintings, the work of H.C. Westermann, Arthur Dove&#x27;s 1925 painting &quot;Goin&#x27; Fishin&quot;&#x27;, Alvin Lustig&#x27;s cover illustrations for New Directions Press, and much of Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s work. In a 1961 tour of Europe, Ruscha came upon more works by Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, R. A. Bertelli&#x27;s &quot;Head of Mussolini&quot;, and &quot;Ophelia&quot; by Sir John Everett Millais. Some critics are quick to see the influence of Edward Hopper&#x27;s &quot;Gas&quot; (1940) in Ruscha&#x27;s 1963 oil painting, &quot;Standard Station, Amarillo, Texas.&quot; In any case, &quot;Art has to be something that makes you scratch your head,&quot; Ruscha said.

===Southern California===

Although Ruscha denies this in interviews, the vernacular of Los Angeles and Southern California landscapes contributes to the themes and styles central to much of Ruscha&#x27;s paintings, drawings, and books. Examples of this include the publication &quot;Every Building on the Sunset Strip&quot; (1966), a book of continuous photographs of a two and one half mile stretch of the 24 mile boulevard. In 1973, following the model of &quot;Every Building on the Sunset Strip&quot;, he photographed the entire length of Hollywood Boulevard with a motorized camera. Also, paintings like &quot;Standard Station&quot; (1966), &quot;Large Trademark&quot; (1962), and &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1982) exemplify Ruscha&#x27;s kinship with the Southern California visual language. Two of these paintings, &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;Large Trademark&quot; were emulated out of car parts in 2008 by Brazilian photographer Vik Muniz as a commentary on Los Angeles and its car culture.

His work is also strongly influenced by the Hollywood film industry: the mountain in his Mountain Series is a play on the Paramount Pictures logo; &quot;Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights&quot; (1962) depicts the 20th Century Fox logo, while the dimensions of this work are reminiscent of a movie screen; in his painting &quot;The End&quot; (1991) these two words, which comprised the final shot in all black-and-white films, are surrounded by scratches and streaks reminiscent of damaged celluloid. Also, the proportions of the &quot;Hollywood&quot; print seems to mimic the Cinemascope screen (however, to make the word &quot;Hollywood&quot;, Ruscha transposed the letters of the sign from their actual location on the slope of the Santa Monica Mountains to the crest of the ridge).

Ruscha completed &quot;Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights&quot; in 1961, one year after graduating from college. Among his first paintings (&quot;SU&quot; (1958–1960), &quot;Sweetwater&quot; (1959)) this is the most widely known, and exemplifies Ruscha&#x27;s interests in popular culture, word depictions, and commercial graphics that would continue to inform his work throughout his career. &quot;Large Trademark&quot; was quickly followed by &quot;Standard Station&quot; (1963) and &quot;Wonder Bread&quot; (1962). In &quot;Norm&#x27;s, La Cienega, on Fire&quot; (1964), &quot;Burning Gas Station&quot; (1965–66), and &quot;Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Fire&quot; (1965–68), Ruscha brought flames into play. In 1966, Ruscha reproduced &quot;Standard Station&quot; in a silkscreen print using a split-fountain printing technique, introducing a gradation of tone in the background of the print, with variations following in 1969 (&quot;Mocha Standard&quot;, &quot;Cheese Mold Standard with Olive&quot;, and &quot;Double Standard&quot;).

In 1985, Ruscha begins a series of &quot;City Lights&quot; paintings, where grids of bright spots on dark grounds suggest aerial views of the city at night. More recently, his &quot;Metro Plots&quot; series chart the various routes that transverse the city of Los Angeles by rendering schematized street maps and blow-ups of its neighborhood sections, such as in &quot;Alvarado to Doheny&quot; (1998). The paintings are grey and vary in their degrees of light and dark, therefore appearing as they were done by pencil in the stippling technique. A 2003 portfolio of prints called &quot;Los Francisco San Angeles&quot; shows street intersections from San Francisco and LA juxtaposed one over the other.

===Word paintings===
As with Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, his East Coast counterparts, Ruscha&#x27;s artistic training was rooted in commercial art. His interest in words and typography ultimately provided the primary subject of his paintings, prints and photographs. The very first of Ruscha&#x27;s word paintings were created as oil paintings on paper in Paris in 1961. He began to isolate monosyllables — ACE, BOSS, HONK, OOF — without additional imagery against solid backgrounds.

Since 1964, Ruscha has been experimenting regularly with painting and drawing words and phrases, often oddly comic and satirical sayings alluding to popular culture and life in LA. When asked where he got his inspiration for his paintings, Ruscha responded, &quot;Well, they just occur to me; sometimes people say them and I write down and then I paint them. Sometimes I use a dictionary.&quot; From 1966 to 1969, Ruscha painted his &quot;liquid word&quot; paintings: Words such as &quot;Adios&quot; (1967), &quot;Steel&quot; (1967–9) and &quot;Desire&quot; (1969) were written as if with liquid spilled, dribbled or sprayed over a flat monochromatic surface. His gunpowder and graphite drawings (made during a period of self-imposed exile from painting from 1967 to 1970) feature single words depicted in a trompe l&#x27;oeil technique, as if the words are formed from ribbons of curling paper. Experimenting with humorous sounds and rhyming word plays, Ruscha made a portfolio of seven mixed-media lithographs with the rhyming words, &quot;News, Mews, Pews, Brews, Stews, Dues, News&quot; (1970).

In the 1970s, Ruscha, with Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer, among others, began using entire phrases in their works, thereby making it a distinctive characteristic of the post-Pop Art generation. During the mid-1970s, he made a series of drawings in pastel using pithy phrases against a field of color. He also congreagated with artists including George Condo. In the early 1980s he produced a series of paintings of words over sunsets, night skies and wheat fields. In the photo-realist painting &quot;Brave Men Run In My Family&quot; (1988), part of the artist&#x27;s &quot;Dysfuntional Family&quot; series, Ruscha runs the text over the silhouetted image of a great, listing tall ship; the piece was a collaboration with fellow Los Angeles artist Nancy Reese (she did the painting, he the lettering). In a series of insidious small abstract paintings from 1994 to 1995, words forming threats are rendered as blank widths of contrasting color like Morse code. Later, words appeared on a photorealist mountain-range series which Ruscha started producing in 1998. For these acrylic-on-canvas works, Ruscha pulled his mountain images either from photographs, commercial logos, or from his imagination.

From 1980, Ruscha started using an all-caps typeface of his own invention named &quot;Boy Scout Utility Modern&quot; in which curved letter forms are squared-off (as in the Hollywood Sign) This simple font is radically different from the style he used in works such as &quot;Honk&quot; (1962). Beginning in the mid-1980s, in many of his paintings black or white &#x27;blanks&#x27; or &#x27;censor strips&#x27; are included, to suggest where the &#x27;missing&#x27; words would have been placed. The &#x27;blanks&#x27; would also feature in his series of Silhouette, Cityscapes or &#x27;censored&#x27; word works, often made in bleach on canvas, rayon or linen.

===Surrealism===
Paintings like &quot;Angry Because It&#x27;s Plaster, Not Milk&quot; (1965) and &quot;Strange Catch for a Fresh Water Fish&quot; (1965) are exemplary works from Ruscha&#x27;s group of paintings from the mid-1960s that take the strict idea of literal representation into the realm of the absurd. This body of work is characterized by what the artist termed &quot;bouncing objects, floating things,&quot; such as a radically oversized red bird and glass hovering in front of a simple background in the work and have a strong affinity to Surrealism, a recurring theme in the artist&#x27;s career. The fish plays a prominent role throughout the series and appears in nearly half of the paintings. Another frequent element is Ruscha&#x27;s continuous depiction of a graphite pencil – broken, splintered, melted, transformed.

===Odd media===
In his drawings, prints, and paintings throughout the 1970s, Ruscha experimented with a range of materials including gunpowder, vinyl, blood, red wine, fruit and vegetable juices, axle grease, chocolate syrup, tomato paste, bolognese sauce, cherry pie, coffee, caviar, daffodils, tulips, raw eggs and grass stains. &quot;Stains&quot;, an editioned portfolio of 75 stained sheets of paper produced and published by Ruscha in 1969, bears the traces of a variety of materials and fluids. In the portfolio of screenprints &quot;News, Mews, Pews, Brews, Stews, Dues&quot; (1970), produced at Editions Alecto, London, rhyming words appear in Gothic typeface, printed in edible substances such as pie fillings, bolognese sauce, caviar, and chocolate syrup. Ruscha has also produced his word paintings with food products on moiré and silks, since they were more stain-absorbent; paintings like &quot;A Blvd. Called Sunset&quot; (1975) were executed in blackberry juice on moiré. However, these most vibrant and varied organic colorings usually dried to a range of muted greys, mustards and browns. His portfolio &quot;Insects&quot; (1972) consists of six screen prints – three on paper, three on paper-backed wood veneer, each showing a lifelike swarm of a different meticulously detailed species. For the April 1972 cover of ARTnews, he composed an Arcimboldo-like photograph that spelled out the magazine&#x27;s title in a salad of squashed foods. Ruscha&#x27;s &quot;Fruit Metrecal Hollywood&quot; (1971) is an example of the artist&#x27;s use of unusual materials, this silkscreen of the &quot;Hollywood&quot; sign is rendered in apricot and grape jam and the diet drink Metrecal on paper.

===Motifs in light===
Notably different from many of Ruscha&#x27;s works of the same period, most obviously in its exclusion of text, his series of &quot;Miracle&quot; pastel drawings from in the mid-1970s show bright beams of light burst forth from skies with dark clouds. An overall glow is created by the black pastel not being completely opaque, allowing the paper to shine through. In the 1980s, a more subtle motif began to appear, again in a series of drawings, some incorporating dried vegetable pigments: a mysterious patch of light cast by an unseen window that serves as background for phrases such as &quot;WONDER SICKNESS&quot; (1984) and &quot;99% DEVIL, 1% ANGEL&quot; (1983). By the 1990s, Ruscha was creating larger paintings of light projected into empty rooms, some with ironic titles such as &quot;An Exhibition of Gasoline Powered Engines&quot; (1993).

===Commissioned works===
Ruscha&#x27;s first major public commissions include a monumental mural at the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego (1966) and a seventy-panel, 360-degree work for the Great Hall of Denver Public Library in Colorado (1995). Created as part of a public-art commission, &quot;The Back of Hollywood&quot; (1976–77) was made from a large sheet of sateen on a billboard and situated opposite the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, designed to be read in the rear-view mirror of a moving car. In 1985 Ruscha was commissioned to design a series of fifty murals, &quot;WORDS WITHOUT THOUGHTS NEVER TO HEAVEN GO&quot; (a quotation from &quot;Hamlet&quot;), for the rotunda of Miami–Dade Public Library (now the Miami Art Museum) in Florida, designed by architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee.

In 1989, Ruscha decorated a pool for his brother Paul at his house in Studio City, Los Angeles, with a supersized luggage label: on a black tiled background are the words Name, Address and Phone, complete with dotted lines.

In 1998, Ruscha was commissioned to produce a nearly thirty-foot high vertical painting entitled &quot;PICTURE WITHOUT WORDS&quot;, for the lobby of the Harold M. Williams Auditorium of the Getty Center. He produced another site-specific piece, three 13-by-23-foot panels proclaiming &quot;Words In Their Best Order&quot;, for the offices of Gannett Company publishers in Tysons Corner, Virginia, in 2002. The artist was later asked by the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum to create two large-scale paintings that flank his &quot;A Particular Kind of Heaven&quot; (1983), which is in the museum&#x27;s collection, to form a spectacular, monumental triptych. For his first public commission in New York in 2014, Ruscha created the hand-painted mural &quot;Honey, I Twisted Through More Damn Traffic Today&quot; for a temporary installation at the High Line.

In 2008, Ruscha was among four text-based artists that were invited by the Whitechapel Gallery to write scripts to be performed by leading actors; Ruscha&#x27;s contribution was &quot;Public Notice&quot; (2007). To celebrate the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA)&#x27;s 75th anniversary, Ruscha was one of the artists invited to collaborate with the museum on a limited-edition of artist-designed T-shirts. Ruscha is regularly commissioned with works for private persons, among them James Frey (&quot;Public Stoning&quot;, 2007), Lauren Hutton (&quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot;, 1987), and Stella McCartney (&quot;Stella&quot;, 2001). In 1987, collector Frederick Weisman had Ruscha paint the exterior of his private plane, a Lockheed JetStar. The summer 2012 campaign of L.A.-based fashion label Band of Outsiders featured Polaroid shots of Ruscha. In 2020, Ruscha produced the cover art and typography of Paul McCartney&#x27;s album &quot;McCartney III&quot;. In 2022, he teamed up with (RED) and Gagosian Gallery to create a limited-edition silk twill scarf—featuring his drawing &quot;Science Is Truth Found&quot; (1986)—to help provide more equitable access to COVID-19 relief. In 2023 he created the cover art for the Beatles single &quot;Now and Then.&quot;

===Books===

Between 1962 and 1978, Ruscha produced sixteen small artist&#x27;s books:
* &quot;Twentysix Gasoline Stations&quot;, 1963
* &quot;Various Small Fires&quot;, 1964
* &quot;Some Los Angeles Apartments&quot;, 1965
* &quot;Every Building on the Sunset Strip&quot;, 1966
* &quot;Thirtyfour Parking Lots&quot;, 1967
* &quot;Royal Road Test&quot;, 1967 (with Mason Williams and Patrick Blackwell)
* &quot;Business Cards&quot;, 1968 (with Billy Al Bengston)
* &quot;Nine Swimming Pools and a Broken Glass&quot;, 1968
* &quot;Crackers&quot;, 1969 (with Mason Williams)
* &quot;Real Estate Opportunities&quot;, 1970
* &quot;Babycakes with Weights&quot;, 1970
* &quot;A Few Palm Trees&quot;, 1971
* &quot;Records&quot;, 1971
* &quot;Dutch Details&quot;, 1971
* &quot;Colored People&quot;, 1972
* &quot;Hard Light&quot;, 1978 (with Lawrence Weiner)
Later book projects include:
* &quot;Country Cityscapes&quot;, 2001
* &quot;ME and THE&quot;, 2002
* &quot;Ed Ruscha and Photography&quot;, 2004 (with Sylvia Wolf)
* &quot;OH / NO&quot;, 2008
* &quot;Dirty Baby&quot;, 2010 (with Nels Cline and David Breskin)

In 1968, Ruscha created the cover design for the catalogue accompanying a Billy Al Bengston exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. For the &quot;Documenta 5&quot; catalogue in 1972, he designed an orange vinyl cover, featuring a &quot;5&quot; made up of scurrying black ants. In 1978, he designed the catalogue &quot;Stella Since 1970&quot; for the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. &quot;Leave Any Information at the Signal&quot;, a volume of Ruscha&#x27;s writings, was published by MIT Press in 2002. In 2010, Gagosian Gallery and Steidl published Ruscha&#x27;s version of Jack Kerouac&#x27;s novel &quot;On the Road&quot; in an edition of 350.

Ruscha&#x27;s artist books have proved to be deeply influential, beginning with Bruce Nauman&#x27;s &quot;Burning Small Fires&quot; (1968), for which Nauman burned Ruscha&#x27;s &quot;Various Small Fires and Milk&quot; (1964) and photographed the process. More than forty years later, photographer Charles Johnstone relocated Ruscha&#x27;s &quot;Twentysix Gasoline Stations&quot; in Cuba, producing the portfolio &quot;Twentysix Havana Gasoline Stations&quot; (2008). A recent homage is &quot;One Swimming Pool&quot; (2013) by Dutch artist Elisabeth Tonnard, who re-photographed one of the photographs from Ruscha&#x27;s &quot;Nine Swimming Pools and a Broken Glass&quot; (1968) and enlarged it to the size of a small swimming pool, consisting of 3164 pages the same size as the pages in Ruscha&#x27;s original book. The pages of this &#x27;pool on a shelf&#x27; can be detached to create the life-size installation.

===Photography===
Photography has played a crucial role throughout Ruscha&#x27;s career, beginning with images he made during a trip to Europe with his mother and brother in 1961, and most memorably as the imagery for more than a dozen books that present precisely what their titles describe. His photographs are straightforward, even deadpan, in their depiction of subjects that are not generally thought of as having aesthetic qualities. His &quot;Products&quot; pictures, for example, feature boxes of Sunmaid raisins and Oxydol detergent and a can of Sherwin Williams turpentine in relatively formal still lifes. Mostly devoid of human presence, these photographs emphasize the essential form of the structure and its placement within the built environment. Ruscha&#x27;s photographic editions are most often based on his conceptual art-books of same or similar name. Ruscha re-worked the negatives of six of the images from his book &quot;Every Building on Sunset Strip&quot;. The artist then cut and painted directly on the negatives, resulting in photographs that have the appearance of a faded black-and-white film. The &quot;Tropical Fish&quot; series (1974–75) represents the first instance where the photographic image has been directly used in his graphic work, where Ruscha had Gemini G.E.L.&#x27;s house photographer Malcolm Lubliner make photographs of a range of common domestic objects.

===Films and documentaries===
In the 1970s, Ruscha also made a series of largely unknown short movies, such as &quot;Premium&quot; (1971) and &quot;Miracle&quot; (1975). With the assistance of a Guggenheim Fellowship, Ruscha arranged in &quot;Premium&quot; a scenario which he first projected in his photo-book &quot;Crackers&quot; from 1969 and subsequently transformed into a film which features Larry Bell, Leon Bing, Rudi Gernreich, and Tommy Smothers. &quot;Miracle&quot; contains the essence of the artist&#x27;s same-named painting, inasmuch as the story is told of a strange day in the life of an auto mechanic, who is magically transformed as he rebuilds the carburetor on a 1965 Ford Mustang. The movie features Jim Ganzer and Michelle Phillips. In 1984, he accepted a small role in the film &quot;Choose Me&quot; directed by his friend Alan Rudolph, and in 2010, he starred in Doug Aitken&#x27;s film &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot;. Artist Tom Sachs&#x27; 2018 short film &quot;Paradox Bullets&quot; stars Ruscha in the role of a hiker lost in the desert and guided only by the voice of Werner Herzog.

Ruscha was featured in Michael Blackwood&#x27;s film documentary &quot;American Art in the Sixties&quot;. He appeared in &quot;L.A. Suggested by the Art of Edward Ruscha&quot;, a 1981 documentary by Gary Conklin shot at the artist&#x27;s studio and desert home. Interviews with Ruscha are included in the documentaries &quot;Dennis Hopper: The Decisive Moments&quot; (2002), &quot;Sketches of Frank Gehry&quot; (2005), &quot;The Cool School&quot; (2008), &quot;Iconoclasts&quot; (2008), and &quot;How to Make a Book with Steidl&quot; (2010), among others.

==Exhibitions==

===Birth of &quot;Pop Art&quot;===
In 1962 Ruscha&#x27;s work was included, along with Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Dowd, Phillip Hefferton, Joe Goode, Jim Dine, and Wayne Thiebaud, in the historically important and ground-breaking &quot;New Painting of Common Objects&quot;, curated by Walter Hopps at the Pasadena Art Museum. This exhibition is historically considered one of the first &quot;Pop Art&quot; exhibitions in America.

Ruscha had his first solo exhibition in 1963 at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1966, Ruscha was included in &quot;Los Angeles Now&quot; at the Robert Fraser Gallery in London, his first European exhibition. In 1968, he had his first European solo show in Cologne, Germany, at Galerie Rudolf Zwirner. Ruscha joined the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1970 and had his first solo exhibition there in 1973.

===Retrospectives===
In 1970 Ruscha represented the United States at the Venice Biennale as part of a survey of American printmaking with an on-site workshop. He constructed &quot;Chocolate Room,&quot; a visual and sensory experience where the visitor saw 360 pieces of paper permeated with chocolate and hung like shingles on the gallery walls. The pavilion in Venice smelled like a chocolate factory. For the Venice Biennale in 1976, Ruscha created an installation entitled &quot;Vanishing Cream&quot;, consisting of letters written in Vaseline petroleum jelly on a black wall. Ruscha was the United States representative at the 51st Venice Biennale in 2005, showing the site- and occasion-specific a painting cycle &quot;Course of Empire&quot;. He was interviewed about the pavilion and its curation by Linda Norden and Donna De Salvo in Sarah Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Seven Days in the Art World&quot;.

He has been the subject of numerous museum retrospectives, beginning in 1983 with the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (traveling to the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Vancouver Art Gallery, the San Antonio Museum of Art, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), the Centre Georges Pompidou in 1989, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in 2000, and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in 2001. In 2004, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney mounted a selection of the artist&#x27;s photographs, paintings, books and drawings that traveled to the Museo Nazionale delle Arti del XXI Secolo, Rome and to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.

In 1998, the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles organized a retrospective solely devoted to Ruscha&#x27;s works on paper. In 2004, The Whitney Museum of American Art exhibited a second Ruscha drawing retrospective, which traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and then to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.

In 1999, the Walker Art Center mounted &quot;Edward Ruscha: Editions 1959-1999&quot;, a major retrospective of the artist&#x27;s prints, books, and graphic works, which number well over 300. The show travelled to the LACMA in 2000. Ruscha coauthored the catalogue raisonné with Walker curator Siri Engberg. In July 2012, &quot;Reading Ed Ruscha&quot; opened at the Kunsthaus Bregenz in Austria.

In 2006, an exhibition of Ruscha&#x27;s photographs was organized for the Jeu de Paume in Paris, the Kunsthaus Zürich, and the Museum Ludwig in Cologne.

In October 2009, London&#x27;s Hayward Gallery featured the first retrospective to focus exclusively on Ruscha&#x27;s canvases. Entitled &quot;Ed Ruscha: Fifty Years of Painting&quot;, the exhibition sheds light on his influences, such as comics, graphic design, and hitchhiking. The exhibition travelled to Haus der Kunst, Munich, and the Moderna Museet, Stockholm. &quot;Ed Ruscha: Road Tested&quot;, opened at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas in January 2011. The Hammer Museum in Los Angeles prepared an exhibition with Ruscha inspired by Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot;, which opened in mid-2011 (traveled to Denver Art Museum, Colorado in December 2011 and Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, Florida in May 2012).

In 2016, there was a large 99 piece exhibit of Ruscha&#x27;s paintings and prints in San Francisco&#x27;s M. H. de Young Memorial Museum. The exhibit, &quot;Ed Ruscha and the Great American West&quot;, focuses primarily on how the artist drew inspiration from the American West. In 1956, Ruscha drove from his home in Oklahoma to Los Angeles where he hoped to attend art school. While driving in a 1950 Ford sedan, the 18 year old artist drew inspiration from dilapidated gas stations, billboards, and telephone poles cross the great expanse of the land. This inspiration from the American West across Route 66 stuck with Ruscha his whole life. The artists paintings of the West reflect both symbolic and ironic renditions of how we imagine the West.

In 2018, The Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas presented &quot;Ed Ruscha: Archaeology and Romance&quot;, featuring more than 150 objects drawn from the Ransom Center&#x27;s Edward Ruscha Papers and Art Collection.

From September 2023 to January 2024, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City exhibited the retrospective &quot;ED RUSCHA / NOW THEN&quot; featuring over 200 works across mediums, including &quot;The Chocolate Room&quot;.

===Curating===
In 2003, Ed Ruscha curated &quot;Emerson Woelffer: A Solo Flight&quot;, a survey of the work of the late Los Angeles-based Abstract Expressionist, for the inaugural exhibition of the Gallery at REDCAT (Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater). In 2012, Ruscha was invited to curate &quot;The Ancients Stole All Our Great Ideas&quot; at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, the first exhibition in a series for which internationally renowned artists were invited to work with the national art and natural history collections.

==Collections==
In 2000, the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts, a branch of Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, acquired Ruscha&#x27;s complete graphic archive of 325 prints and 800 working proofs. The museum bought the archive and negotiated for impressions of future prints for $10 million, with funds provided by San Francisco philanthropist Phyllis Wattis. Another major collection of Ruscha&#x27;s prints was compiled by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 2003, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles acquired the &quot;Chocolate Room&quot;, then worth about $1.5 million. In 2004, the Whitney Museum acquired more than 300 photographs through a purchase and gift from the artist, making it the principal repository of Ruscha&#x27;s photographic oevre. The gift, purchased from Larry Gagosian, includes vintage photographs that Ruscha took on a seven-month European tour in 1961. In 2005, Leonard A. Lauder purchased &quot;The Old Tool &amp; Die Building&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Old Trade School Building&quot; (2005) for the Whitney, both of which were part of &quot;The Course of Empire: Paintings by Ed Ruscha&quot; at the Venice Biennale. Ruscha is represented by 33 of his works in the permanent collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art owns 25 Ruscha paintings, works on paper, and photographs; the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden has 21 Ruschas in its permanent collection; and the Art Institute of Chicago has more than 40 works by the artist in their collection. Ruscha also has small collections of books and lithographs in the Utah Museum of Fine Arts in Salt Lake City, Utah and in Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art in Montsoreau, France.

Ruscha&#x27;s private collectors have in the past included Leonardo DiCaprio, Owen Wilson and Jay-Z.

==Recognition==
Fellow artist Louise Lawler included Ruscha in her piece &quot;Birdcalls&quot; (1972/2008), an audio artwork that transforms the names of famous male artists into a bird song, parroting names such as Artschwager, Beuys, and Warhol in a mockery of conditions of privilege and recognition given to male artists at that time. The muralist Kent Twitchell painted an 11,000-square-foot mural in Downtown Los Angeles to honor Ruscha entitled the &quot;Ed Ruscha Monument&quot; between 1978 and 1987. The mural was preserved until 2006 when it was illegally painted over. The band Talking Heads Ruscha&#x27;s eponymous 1974 painting for their&quot;Sand in the Vaseline&quot; compilation album. The band Various Cruelties, based around Liam O&#x27;Donnell, was named after Ruscha&#x27;s painting of the same name of 1974.

Between 2006 and 2012, Ruscha served on the board of trustees of the Museum of Contemporary Art (MoCA) in Los Angeles where he had previously been included in eight special exhibits. In 2012, he was the honoree of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art&#x27;s Art + Film gala; in a speech, the museums&#x27;s director Michal Govan paid tribute to the artist, quoting the novelist J. G. Ballard: &quot;Ed Ruscha has the coolest gaze in American art.&quot; Ruscha was elected to a three-year term on the board of trustees of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2013. From 2015 until 2019, Ruscha also served on the board of Desert X; he resigned over the board&#x27;s decision to collaborate on an exhibition in Saudi Arabia.

In 2009, Ruscha&#x27;s &quot;I Think I&#x27;ll...&quot; (1983) from the collection of the National Gallery was installed at the White House. In 2010, during British prime minister David Cameron&#x27;s first visit to Washington, President Barack Obama presented him with a signed two-color lithograph by Ruscha, &quot;Column With Speed Lines&quot; (2003), chosen for its red, white and blue colors. Obama gave Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott a similar lithograph during his visit to the White House in 2014. Ruscha&#x27;s &quot;Screaming in Spanish&quot; (2013) was installed in the entry hall of the residence of the United States Ambassador to Spain in Madrid.

==Art market==
As early as 2002, the oil on canvas word painting &quot;Talk About Space&quot; (1963), a takeoff on the American billboard in which a single word is the subject, was expected to sell for $1.5 million to $2 million from a private European collection. It was eventually sold for $3.5 million at Christie&#x27;s in New York, a record for the artist. In 2008, Eli Broad acquired Ruscha&#x27;s &quot;liquid word&quot; painting &quot;Desire&quot; (1969) for $2.4 million at Sotheby&#x27;s, which back then was 40 percent under the $4 million low estimate. A navy blue canvas with the word &quot;Smash&quot; in yellow, which Ruscha painted in 1963, was purchased by Larry Gagosian for $30.4 million at a 2014 Christie&#x27;s auction in New York. His word painting &quot;Hurting the Word Radio #2&quot; (1964) sold by L.A. collectors Joan and Jack Quinn to an anonymous bidder at Christie&#x27;s for a record-shattering $52.5 million with fees in 2019.

&quot;Burning Standard&quot; (1968) from the collection of Alan and Dorothy Press, which sold for $22.2 million with fees at Christie&#x27;s New York in 2023, is the most valuable of Ruscha gas station paintings to sell at auction to date.

&quot;Angry Because It&#x27;s Plaster, Not Milk&quot; from 1965, which had been shown at Ferus Gallery that year, was sold by Halsey Minor to Gagosian Gallery for $3.2 million at Phillips de Pury &amp; Company, New York, in 2010. From the same series, &quot;Strange Catch for a Fresh Water Fish&quot; (1965) made $4.1 million at Christie&#x27;s New York in 2011.

Ruscha&#x27;s classic prints, published as multiples, command up to $40,000 apiece.

==Personal life==
Ruscha is married to Danica Ruscha, &quot;née&quot; Knego (known as Danna). They met in 1965, wed in 1967, separated in 1972, filed for divorce in 1976, divorced in 1978, and remarried in 1987. The couple has two children, Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Ruscha Jr., a son, and Sonny Bjornson, a daughter. In the late seventies, Ruscha bought land about ten miles from Pioneertown, California; he later built a house there.

During the time he and Danna were apart, Ruscha dated actresses Candy Clark, Samantha Eggar, Diane Keaton, Lauren Hutton, and Michelle Phillips.

According to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), Ruscha donated $12,500 to the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton in September 2016.

==Legacy==
In 2011, the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Getty Research Institute acquired over seventy photographs by Ruscha as well as his &quot;Streets of Los Angeles&quot; archive, including thousands of negatives, hundreds of photographic contact sheets, and related documents and ephemera. A portion of the material will go to the Getty as a promised gift from the artist. The &quot;Streets of Los Angeles&quot; archive acquired by the Getty Research Institute begins with the photographic and production material for Ruscha&#x27;s landmark 1966 book &quot;Every Building on the Sunset Strip&quot;, and includes the original camera-ready three-panel maquette used for the publication. This ongoing project subsequently evolved into a vast photographic archive that spans over four decades and documents many major Los Angeles thoroughfares, including Santa Monica Boulevard, Melrose Avenue, and Pacific Coast Highway, shot in 1974 and 1975, and more than 25 other Los Angeles streets that Ruscha photographed since 2007. In total, the archive comprises thousands of negatives, hundreds of photographic contact sheets, and related documents and ephemera.

In 2013, the Harry Ransom Center acquired a Ruscha archive comprising five personal journals filled with preliminary sketches and notes; materials related to the making of his artist&#x27;s book &quot;On The Road&quot; (2010); notes, photographs, correspondence and contact sheets relating to the creation and publication of his many other artist&#x27;s books; and materials relating to his short films &quot;Miracle&quot; (1975) and &quot;Premium&quot; (1971); his portfolios; and several art commissions. Ruscha himself donated a substantial portion of the archive to the Ransom Center.

<doc id="1311854" wikidata="Q371624" url="?curid=1311854" title="Judas of Galilee">
<text>Judas of Galilee, or Judas of Gamala, was a Jewish leader who led resistance to the census imposed for Roman tax purposes by Quirinius in the Judaea Province in 6 CE. He encouraged Jews not to register, and those that did were targeted by his followers. He is credited with beginning the &quot;fourth philosophy&quot; which Josephus blames for the war with the Romans in 66–73. These events are discussed by Josephus in &quot;The Jewish War&quot; and in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; and mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles.

In &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, Josephus states that Judas, along with Zadok the Pharisee, founded the Zealots, the &quot;fourth sect&quot; of 1st-century Judaism (the first three being the Sadducees, the Pharisees, and the Essenes). Josephus blames this fourth sect for the First Jewish–Roman War of 66–73. The Zealots preached that God alone was the ruler of Israel and urged that no taxes should be paid to Rome.

Several scholars, such as Gunnar Haaland and James S. McLaren, have suggested that Josephus&#x27;s description of the fourth sect does not reflect historical reality, but was constructed to serve his own interests. According to Haaland, the part covering the Zealots acts as a transition and an introduction to the excursion concerning the Jewish schools of thought, and to show that the Jewish War was incited by this faction. Similarly, McLaren proposes that Judas and his sect act as scapegoats for the war that are chronologically, geographically and socially removed from the priestly circles of Jerusalem (and Josephus himself).

Josephus does not relate the death of Judas but does report that Judas&#x27;s sons James and Simon were executed by procurator Tiberius Julius Alexander in about 46. He also claims that Menahem ben Judah, one of the early leaders of the Jewish Revolt in 66 CE, was Judas&#x27;s &quot;son&quot;, which some scholars doubt though Menahem may have been Judas&#x27;s grandson. Menahem&#x27;s cousin, Eleazar ben Ya&#x27;ir, escaped to the fortress of Masada where he became a leader of the last defenders against the Roman Empire.

Judas is referred to in Acts of the Apostles in which a speech by Gamaliel, a member of the Sanhedrin, identifies Theudas and Judas as examples of failed Messianic movements, and suggests that the movement emerging in the name of Jesus of Nazareth could similarly fail, unless he really was the Messiah.

<doc id="1311855" wikidata="Q3635378" url="?curid=1311855" title="Shivananda">
<text>Swami Shivananda (1854–1934), born Tarak Nath Ghosal, was a Hindu spiritual leader and a direct disciple of Ramakrishna, who became the second president of the Ramakrishna Mission. His devotees refer to him as Mahapurush Maharaj (Great Soul). Shivananda and Subodhananda were the only direct disciples of Ramakrishna to be filmed. He was a Brahmajnani (&quot;knower of Brahman or the Supreme Being&quot;). 
Shivananda introduced the celebration of the birthdays of his brother-monks. He was known to have laid the foundation stone of Shri Ramakrishna Temple at Belur Math, which was designed by Vijnanananda.

==Early life==
Shivananda was born in the village of Barasat in Bengal. His father was Ramakanai Ghoshal, a pious Brahmin who had a substantial income as a lawyer. He was a follower of tantra in his personal life. He and his first wife Vamasundari Devi, the mother of Tarak, provided free board and lodging to twenty-five to thirty poor students.
Ramakanai also knew Ramakrishna personally, as he used to visit Dakshineswar on matters of business.

After completing his school studies, Tarak took up a job with Mackinnon Mackenzie in Calcutta to help his father.

===Ramakrishna&#x27;s influence===

Tarak saw Ramakrishna for the first time at the house of Ramchandra Dutta in May 1880. A few days later he went to Dakshineswar to visit Kali Temple; from then he began to practise intense prayer and meditation under Ramakrishna&#x27;s guidance. He later wrote &quot;I have not yet come to a final understanding whether he [Ramakrishna] was a man or a superman, a god or the God Himself, but I have known him to be a man of complete self-effacement, master of the highest renunciation, possessed of supreme wisdom, and the supreme incarnation of love.&quot;

===Marriage===
Tarak married in 1881–82. His father could not afford a dowry for the marriage of his sister, as was usual; Tarak therefore agreed to marry a daughter of the prospective bridegroom&#x27;s family. Three years later his wife died and Tarak started living sometimes in a devotee&#x27;s house and sometimes in lonely places, till the Baranagar Math was started.

===Renunciation===
Tarak continued to visit Dakshineswar till Ramakrishna fell ill and was brought, first to the Shyampukur house and then later to the Cossipore Garden House. In Cossipore, Tarak joined with others including Narendranath Dutta, later known as Swami Vivekananda, to serve Ramakrishna.

After the death of Ramakrishna in 1886, the small group of direct disciples who decided to embrace monastic life gathered round in a dilapidated house in Baranagar; Tarak was one of the first to settle there. Thus began the Baranagar monastery of the Ramakrishna Math.

==Life of a Sannyasin (ascetic)==

===As a wandering monk===
During his itinerant period, Shivananda travelled throughout northern India. He went to Almora, where he was acquainted with a local rich man, Lala Badrilal Shah, an admirer of Ramakrishna&#x27;s disciples. During the latter part of 1893, Tarak also met E.T. Sturdy, an Englishman interested in theosophy, who later became an admirer and follower of Vivekananda after he met him in England.
He was inclined towards leading a contemplative life and went to the Himalayas several times. He also went to Amarnath in 1909 with Swami Turiyananda.

===Establishment of Ramakrishna Math and Mission===
Tarak&#x27;s itinerant life came to an end when Vivekananda returned to India in 1897. He went to Madras to receive Vivekananda, and came back with him to Calcutta.
Vivekananda sent Shivananda to Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, to spread Vedanta there. There he held classes on Gita and the Raja Yoga. He returned to the newly established Ramakrishna Math or monastery in Belur in 1898. 
In 1899 Shivananda, upon request from Vivekananda, helped in organising relief efforts when plague broke out in Calcutta. In 1900 he travelled with Vivekananda to Mayavati. There is a dormitory named, in his honour, Shivananda Dham in Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, Deoghar.
===Advaita Ashrama, Benaras===
In 1902, just before Vivekananda&#x27;s death, he went to Varanasi to start the Advaita Ashrama using the donation by Raja of Bhinga to Vivekananda. There he remained as head for seven years. Money was short, and they lived austerely. About this time, he translated Vivekananda&#x27;s Chicago lectures into local Hindi. He continued to look after the affairs of the Ashrama till 1909.

===Office-bearer of Ramakrishna Mission===
In 1910, he was elected vice-president of Ramakrishna Mission. Shivananda was also one of the original trustees of Belur Math. In 1917 when Baburam Maharaj (Swami Premananda) fell ill and died, his duties of managing the affairs of the Math and Mission fell on Shivananda.
In 1922, after the death of Swami Brahmananda, he became the second President of Ramakrishna Math and Mission. Like Brahmananda, he stressed meditation along with his daily work. He went to Dhaka and Mymensingh in what became East Bengal, and initiated many spiritual seekers.
In 1924 and 1927 he went on two long tours to the South, and established the Ramakrishna Math in Ootakamund and then later in Bombay and Nagpur. In 1925, he went to Deoghar and opened a new building for the local chapter of Ramakrishna Mission.

===The title of Mahapurush===
Tarak was married in his teens but, with the consent of his young wife, he lived an absolutely celibate life. and that&#x27;s why after the foundation of Belur Math, he came to be known as &#x27;Mahapurush Maharaj by Swami Vivekananda&#x27;, &#x27;Mahapurush&#x27; meaning &#x27;A Great Man&#x27;.

==Last years==
From 1930 on, Shivananda&#x27;s health broke down rapidly. In April 1933 he suffered a stroke and developed paralysis of one side. On 20 February 1934, a few days after Ramakrishna&#x27;s birthday, Shivananda died. The small room adjacent to the Old Shrine at Belur Math became known as the &#x27;Room of Shivananda&#x27;.
==Character and legacy==

===Work===
Under Shivananda&#x27;s presidency, the Ramakrishna Mission slowly expanded in other locations. He established centres in Ootacamund, Nagpur and Bombay. Centres were also opened in various foreign locations. In 1915, he established a Ramakrishna mission centre in Almora. He initiated many people after the death of Brahmananda.

===Quotes===
* &quot;It will not do to be restless. One has to get deeply absorbed in spiritual exercises; one must strengthen one&#x27;s spiritual attitude in one&#x27;s own mind. One may get a temporary enthusiasm by noticing someone else&#x27;s spiritual fervour, but then one must remember that all such men had to pass through hard struggle&quot;
*&quot;Behind work there should be meditation. Without meditation, work cannot be performed in a way which conduces to spiritual growth. Nor is work nicely performed without having a spiritual background&quot;

===Character===
Shivananda washed the soiled clothes of a sick inmate to his monastery in Benaras. He started a free nursery school for the poor children in Benaras.
After Brahmananda died, Shivananda refused to proclaim himself as president of Ramakrishna Mission because he considered himself as merely a representative of Brahmananda. He was in favour of disciplines in monastic life, and he himself practised them rigorously till he was physically unable to do.

<doc id="1311861" wikidata="Q831922" url="?curid=1311861" title="Organisation climate">
<text>Organisational climate (sometimes known as corporate climate) is a concept that has academic meaning in the fields of organisational behaviour and I/O psychology as well as practical meaning in the business world There is continued scholarly debate about the exact definition of organisational climate for the purposes of scientific study. The definition developed by Lawrence R. James (1943-2014) and his colleagues makes a distinction between &quot;psychological&quot; and &quot;organisational&quot; climate. &quot;&quot;Psychological&quot; climate is defined as the individual employee’s perception of the psychological impact of the work environment on his or her own well-being (James &amp; James, 1989). When employees in a particular work unit agree on their perceptions of the impact of their work environment, their shared perceptions can be aggregated to describe their &quot;organisational&quot; climate (Jones &amp; James, 1979; Joyce &amp; Slocum, 1984).&quot;Employees&#x27; collective appraisal of the organisational work environment takes into account many dimensions of the situation as well as the psychological impact of the environment. For instance, job-specific properties such as role clarity, workload and other aspects unique to a person&#x27;s specific job have a psychological impact that can be agreed upon by members of the organisation. Work group or team cooperation and effectiveness as well as leadership and organisational support are other dimensions of shared experience that factor into organisational climate. Surveys are the most common way of quantifying organisational climate. Aspects of climate that influence performance of specific sets of behaviours and outcomes can be measured, such as the &quot;climate for safety&quot; and the &quot;climate for innovation.&quot; Many instruments have been developed to assess numerous aspects of climate.

The shared perception approach emphasises the importance of shared perceptions as underpinning the notion of climate. Organisational climate has also been defined as &quot;the shared perception of the way things are around here&quot;. There is great deal of overlap in the two approaches.

== Cognitive schema approach ==
Cognitive representations of social objects are referred to as schemas. These schemas are a mental structure that represents some aspect of the world. They are organised in memory in an associative network. In these associative networks, similar schemas are clustered together. When a particular schema is activated related schemas may be activated as well. Schema activation may also increase the accessibility of related schemas in the associative network. When a schema is more accessible this means it can more quickly be activated and used in a particular situation. When related schemas are activated, inferences beyond the information given in a particular social situation may influence thinking and social behaviour, regardless of whether those inferences are accurate or not. Lastly, when a schema is activated a person may or may not be aware of it.

Two processes that increase the accessibility of schemas are salience and priming. Salience is the degree to which a particular social object stands out relative to other social objects in a situation. The higher the salience of an object the more likely that schemas for that object will be made accessible. For example, if there is one female in a group of seven males, female gender schemas may be more accessible and influence the group&#x27;s thinking and behaviour toward the female group member. Priming refers to any experiences immediately prior to a situation that caused a schema to be more accessible.

== Shared perception approach ==
Some researchers have pursued the shared perception model of organisational climate. Their model identifies the variables which moderate an organisation&#x27;s ability to mobilise its workforce in order to achieve business goals and maximise performance.

One of the major users of this model are departments of the Queensland State Government Australia. These departments use this model of climate to survey staff in order to identify and measure those aspects of a workplace which impact on: stress, morale, quality of worklife, wellbeing, employee engagement, absenteeism/presenteeism, turnover and performance.

While an organisation and its leaders cannot remove every stressor in the daily life of its employees, organisational climate studies have identified a number of behaviours of leaders which have a significant impact on stress and morale. For instance, one Queensland state government employer, Queensland Transport, has found that increasing managers&#x27; awareness of these behaviours has improved quality of work life employees and the ability of QT&#x27;s to deliver its organisational goals.

== Organisational climate versus organisational culture ==
Climate and culture are both important aspects of the overall context, environment or situation. Organisational culture tends to be shared by all or most members of some social group, is something that older members usually try to pass on to younger members, and shapes behaviour, structures, and perceptions of the world. Cultures are often studied and understood at a national level, such as the American or French culture. 

Culture includes deeply held values, beliefs and assumptions, symbols, heroes, and rituals. Culture can be examined at an organisational level as well. The main distinction between organisational culture and national culture is that people can choose to join a place of work, but are usually born into a national culture. Organisational climate, on the other hand, is often defined as the recurring patterns of behaviour, attitudes and feelings that characterise life in the organisation, while an organisation culture tends to be deep and stable. Although culture and climate are related, climate often proves easier to assess and change. At an individual level of analysis the concept is called individual psychological climate. These individual perceptions are often aggregated or collected for analysis and understanding at the team or group level, or the divisional, functional, or overall organisational level.

== Climate surveys ==
Theories of cognitive and neuropsychology and emotional intelligence provide additional scientific rationale for why leaders should improve stress and morale in the workplace to achieve maximum performance. Climate surveys can provide concrete evidence of how this works in action.

Organisational climate surveying enables the impact of human resource (HR) strategies to be evaluated to create HR return on investment (HRROI) calculations. This data has been found to be highly effective in changing the perspective of people-based initiatives as being an &quot;investment&quot; rather than a &quot;cost&quot; and transforming HR into a &quot;mission-critical strategic partner&quot; from its perception of &quot;personnel administration&quot;.

A number of studies by Dr Dennis Rose and colleagues between 2001 and 2004 have found a very strong link between organisational climate and employee reactions such as stress levels, absenteeism and commitment and participation.

A study has found that Hart, Griffin et al.&#x27;s (1996) organisational climate model accounts for at least 16% single-day sick leave and 10% separation rates in one organisation. Other studies support the links between organisational climate and many other factors such as employee retention, job satisfaction, well-being, and readiness for creativity, innovation and change. Hunter, Bedell and Mumford have reviewed numerous approaches to climate assessment for creativity. They found that those climate studies that were based on well-developed, standardised instruments produced far higher effect sizes than did studies that were based on locally developed measures.

<doc id="1311866" wikidata="Q8026540" url="?curid=1311866" title="Winterval">
<text>Winterval was a season of public events in Birmingham, England, organised by Birmingham City Council in each of two consecutive winters: first from 20 November to 31 December 1997, and then again from mid-October 1998 to mid-January 1999. The intention was to encourage people into the newly rejuvenated city centre, with secular and religious events marking religious and other occasions, including Christmas, during the relevant period. The name &quot;Winterval&quot; has since become used in the UK as shorthand for what are misrepresented as attempts to &quot;rebrand&quot; Christmas so as not to exclude non-Christians.

== 1997 ==
The name &quot;Winterval&quot; was a portmanteau of &quot;winter&quot; and &quot;festival&quot;, coined by the Council&#x27;s Head of Events, Mike Chubb. In October 2008 he explained:

The programme of events in 1997 included theatre and arts events; marking of Diwali; candlelit tours of Aston Hall; an outdoor ice rink; a German-style Christmas market; Christmas lights in the streets; and a New Year&#x27;s Eve Party. The front cover of the promotional brochure used the word &quot;Christmas&quot; three times and featured a photograph of the City&#x27;s official Christmas tree. Each of its six pages featured the word &quot;Christmas&quot; in text or images.

== 1998 ==
The extended Winterval the following year included: Hallowe&#x27;en; Guy Fawkes Night; Diwali; Ramadan and Eid; Hanukkah; Advent, Christmas, and Boxing Day; New Year&#x27;s Eve; and Chinese New Year.

Posters were displayed, advertising Christmas events, with the word &quot;Christmas&quot; in large type, and the &quot;Winterval 98&quot; logo only as a footnote.

Church of England leaders in Birmingham criticised the 1998 &quot;Winterval&quot; concept. Mark Santer, then Bishop of Birmingham, said in a message to his parishes that he &quot;laughed out loud&quot; when he learned of the concept of Winterval, which he considered to be &quot;a way of not talking about Christmas&quot; and &quot;a well-meaning attempt not to offend&quot;. He wondered whether Christianity had been censored. The Archdeacon of Aston called it &quot;a totally unnecessary example of political correctness to avoid sensitivities people simply do not have&quot;. The council responded that &quot;Christmas is the very heart of Winterval&quot;, saying that Christmas-themed events were prominent among those included in Winterval, and that Christmas-related words and symbols were prominent in its publicity material. While the Winterval season was longer than the Christmas season, Christmas was the focus of the relevant portion of Winterval, and a statement from Birmingham Council explained:

Neighbouring Solihull council invited Birmingham residents desiring a traditional Christmas to go there instead.

== Legacy ==
Birmingham City Council did not use the name &quot;Winterval&quot; after the 1998–9 season, but it persists as shorthand for any secular replacement for Christmas, used both by supporters and opponents of the traditional Christmas; it is also cited as a cautionary tale or urban legend by those who regard allegations of the existence of a &quot;war on Christmas&quot; as overblown.

On 8 November 2011 the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; issued a correction after using the term &#x27;Winterval&#x27; in an opinion piece by Melanie Phillips, which it ran on 26 September 2011, stating:

The lawyer and law correspondent David Allen Green, and the campaigner Inayat Bunglawala both included Winterval as an example in evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press. Green wrote:

The city of Waterford in Ireland has named its municipal mid-winter festivities &#x27;Winterval&#x27; since 2012 as an annual event that continues up to the present.

<text>Vija Celmins ( ; ; ; born October 25, 1938) is a Latvian American visual artist best known for photo-realistic paintings and drawings of natural environments and phenomena such as the ocean, spider webs, star fields, and rocks. Her earlier work included pop sculptures and monochromatic representational paintings. Based in New York City, she has been the subject of over forty solo exhibitions since 1965, and major retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London and the Centre Pompidou, Paris.

==Biography==
Vija Celmiņa was born on October 25, 1938, in Riga, Latvia. Upon the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, during World War II, her parents fled with her and her older sister Inta to Germany, then under the Nazi regime; after the end of the war, the family lived in a United Nations supported Latvian refugee camp in Esslingen am Neckar, Baden-Württemberg. In 1948, the Church World Service relocated the family to the United States, briefly in New York City, then in Indianapolis, Indiana. Sponsored by a local Lutheran church, her father found work as a carpenter, and her mother in a hospital laundry. Vija was ten, and spoke no English, which caused her to focus on drawing, leading her teachers to encourage further creativity and painting.

In 1955, she entered the John Herron School of Art in Indianapolis, where she has said that for the first time in her life, she did not feel like an outsider. In 1961 she won a Fellowship to attend a Summer session at Yale University, where she met Chuck Close and Brice Marden, who would remain close friends. It was during this time she began to study Italian monotone still life painter Giorgio Morandi, and painted abstract works. In 1962 she graduated from Herron with a BFA, and moved to Venice, Los Angeles, to pursue an MFA at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating in 1965. At UCLA, she enjoyed freedom, being far from her parents, leading to further artistic exploration. In 1978, she was an artist-in-residence, funded by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), at the Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art. She lived in Venice until 1980, painting and sculpting, and working as an instructor at the California State University, Los Angeles, the University of California, Irvine and California Institute of the Arts, in Valencia.

In 1981, following an invitation to teach at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, she moved permanently to New York City, wanting to be closer to the artists and art that she liked. She also returned to painting, which she had abandoned for twelve years, working during that time mainly in pencil. She later used woodcuts, and eraser and charcoal. Since that time, she has worked out of a cottage in Sag Harbor, New York, and a studio loft on Crosby Street in Soho, Manhattan. During the 1980s, she also taught at the Cooper Union and the Yale University School of Art.

==Work==
Working in California in the 1960s, Vija Celmins&#x27; early work, generally in photorealistic painting and pop-inspired sculpture, was representational. She recreated commonplace objects such as TVs, lamps, pencils, erasers and the painted monochrome reproductions of photographs. A common underlying theme in the paintings was violence or conflict, such as war planes, handguns and riot imagery. A retrospective of the 1964–1966 work was organized by the Menil Collection in cooperation with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2010. She has cited Malcolm Morley and Jasper Johns as influences in this period.

In the late 1960s through the 1970s, she abandoned painting, and focused on working in graphite pencil, creating highly detailed photorealistic drawings, based on photographs of natural elements such as the ocean&#x27;s or Moon&#x27;s surface, the insides of shells, and closeups of rocks. Critics frequently compare her laborious approach to contemporaries Chuck Close and Gerhard Richter, and she has cited Giorgio Morandi, a master of the pale grey still life, as a major influence. These works also share with Richter&#x27;s an apparent randomness and thus apparently dispassionate attitude. It is as if any photograph would do as a source for a painting, and the choice is apparently unimportant. This is of course not the case, but the work contains within it the impression that the image is chosen at random from an endless selection of possible alternative images of similar nature.

At the end of this period, from 1976 to 1983, Celmins also returned to sculpture in a way that incorporated her interest in photorealism. She produced a series of bronze cast, acrylic painted stones, exact replicas of individual stones she found along the Rio Grande in Northern New Mexico, with eleven examples held at MoMA. By 1981, she returned to painting, from this point forward working also with woodcuts and printing, and substantially in charcoal with a wide variety of erasers - often exploring negative space, selectively removing darkness from images, and achieving subtle control of grey tones.

From the early 1980s forward, Celmins focused on the constellations, moon and oceans using these various techniques, a balance between the abstract and photorealism. By 2000, she had begun to produce haunting and distinctive spider webs, again negative images in oil or charcoal, to much critical acclaim, with particular note of her meticulous surface development and luminosity. She has said that all these works are based on photographs, and she imparts substantial effort on the built-up surfaces of the images. In a 1996 review of her 30-year retrospective at London&#x27;s Institute of Contemporary Art, &quot;The Independent&quot; cited her as &quot;American art&#x27;s best-kept secret.&quot;

Critics have often noted that Celmins&#x27; works since the late 1960s - the moon scapes, ocean surfaces, star fields, shells, and spider webs, often share the characteristic of not having a reference point: no horizon, depth of field, edge or landmarks to put them into context. The location, constellation, or scientific name are all unknown - there is no information imparted.

From 2008, Celmins returned to objects and representative work, with paintings of maps and books, as well as many uses of small graphite tablets - hand held black boards. She also produced series prints of her now well-known waves, spiderwebs, shells and desert floors, many of which were exhibited at the McKee Gallery in June 2010. She recently released a new series of prints that includes both night sky and waves mezzotints. These prints were exhibited at the Matthew Marks Gallery in January, February, and March 2018 and the Senior &amp; Shopmaker Gallery in February and March 2018.

Her woodcuts of water can take a year to cut; she has commented that they &quot;remind us of &#x27;the complexity of the simplest things&#x27;&quot;.

==Solo exhibitions==
Celmins&#x27;s works have been the subject of over forty solo exhibitions around the world since 1966 (Los Angeles), hundreds of group exhibitions. After her longtime dealer, McKee Gallery in New York, announced its closing in 2015, Celmins is currently represented by Matthew Marks Gallery.

In 2020, the major career survey &quot;Vija Celmins&quot;, was organized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York and exhibited at the institution&#x27;s former space MET Brauer. Between 1992 and 1994, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, organized the artist&#x27;s mid-career retrospective. The show traveled to the Henry Art Gallery, University of Washington, Seattle; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.

== Group exhibitions ==
In 2022, the Hammer Museum at University of California, Los Angeles, organized the exhibition &quot;Joan Didion: What She Means&quot;, curated by The New Yorker theater critic Hilton Als. The show traveled to the Pérez Art Museum Miami in 2023, and works by Vija Celmins were included alongside artworks by 50 other contemporary artists such as Félix González-Torres, Ana Mendieta, Betye Saar, Maren Hassinger, Silke Otto-Knapp, John Koch, Ed Ruscha, Pat Steir, among others. In 2023, the Kunsthalle Hamburg hosted the exhibiton &quot;Vija Celmnis | Gerhard Richter. Double Vision&quot; (12 May 2023 - 27 August 2023), featuring a dialogue between the two artists.

<text>Kalavryta () is a town and a municipality in the mountainous east-central part of the regional unit of Achaea, Greece. The town is located on the right bank of the river Vouraikos, south of Aigio, southeast of Patras and northwest of Tripoli. Notable mountains in the municipality are Mount Erymanthos in the west and Aroania or Chelmos in the southeast. Kalavryta is the southern terminus of the Diakopto-Kalavryta rack railway, built by Italian engineers between 1885 and 1895.

==History==
Kalavryta is built near the ancient city of Cynaetha.

During the late Middle Ages, the town was the centre of the Barony of Kalavryta within the Frankish Principality of Achaea, until it was reconquered by the Byzantines in the 1270s. After that it remained under Byzantine control until the fall of the Despotate of the Morea to the Ottoman Turks in 1460. With the exception of a 30-year interlude of Venetian control, the town remained under Turkish rule until the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821, in whose early stages Kalavryta figures prominently: it was here that on 21 March 1821 the flag of the revolt was raised at the monastery of Agia Lavra by bishop Germanos III of Old Patras.

At the end of 1943, near Kalavryta, 81 German soldiers, led by Hauptmann Johannes Schober, were captured by Greek partisans. Four Germans were killed on the spot. Three were taken to hospital at Kalavryta but were later shot by the furious partisans. The rest were initially treated as prisoners of war until most were shot dead and some plunged over the cliff near Mazi from the force of the shots. Two German prisoners survived the execution and raised the alarm on the following day 8 December 1943.

On 13 December 1943, in retribution for the killing of the captured German soldiers, German troops perpetrated the Kalavryta massacre: they ordered all male residents of Kalavryta aged 14 years or older to gather in a field just outside the village. Some 1,300 women and children were locked in a school which was then set on fire while the men were looking on from a hill outside the village. Then 696 boys and men were machine-gunned; only 13 survived. After that, they burnt down the town before they left and the next day they burnt down the monastery of Agia Lavra, the birthplace of the Greek War of Independence. In total, 752 civilians were killed during &quot;Operation Kalavryta&quot;, a deliberate strategy by the Nazis in order to break the resistance by targeting civilians. After the war, the federal government of Germany offered gestures of atonement in the form of free school books for the high school, scholarships for orphans of the massacre and the building of a retirement home. However, German commanders, including Major Ebersberger who carried out the destruction of Kalavryta and Hauptmann Dohnert who led the firing party, were never brought to justice for their crimes.

The Kalavryta region also became the site of fighting during the Greek Civil War. On 11 April 1948, Kalavryta was seized by the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE) after the former overpowered the town&#x27;s garrison. DSE released 17 leftists held in the local gendarmerie building, while also emptying the national guard and United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration warehouses; taking 400 million drachmas and large quantities of food and military equipment in the process.

<text>Air Transat Flight 236 was a transatlantic flight bound for Lisbon, Portugal, from Toronto, Canada, that lost all engine power while flying over the Atlantic Ocean on August 24, 2001. The Airbus A330 ran out of fuel because of a fuel leak caused by improper maintenance. Captain Robert Piché, 48, an experienced glider pilot, and First Officer Dirk DeJager, 28, glided the plane to a successful emergency landing in the Azores, saving the lives of all 306 people (293 passengers and 13 crew) on board.

It was powered by two Rolls-Royce Trent 772B-60 engines each capable of delivering thrust. Leaving the gate in Toronto, the aircraft had of fuel on board, more than required by regulations.

At 04:38 UTC (almost four hours into the flight), the aircraft began to leak fuel through a fracture that had developed in a fuel line to the no. 2 (right) engine. At 05:03 UTC, more than four hours into the flight, the pilots noticed low oil temperature and high oil pressure on engine no. 2. Although these readings were an indirect result of the fuel leak, the pilots had no reason to consider that as a cause. Consequently, Captain Piché suspected they were false warnings and shared that opinion with Air Transat maintenance control centre in Montreal, which advised them to monitor the situation.

===Indications of a fuel problem===

#The fuel on board was decreasing at an unusual rate which was displayed in the Fuel-On-Board (FOB) quantity on the Engine Warning Display.
#The estimated fuel on board at destination would have been showing as decreasing indicating reduced fuel range. 
#The full forward transfer of the fuel in the trim tank was premature given the fuel load on departure from Toronto of . A prolonged, 19-minute TRIM TANK XFR memo between 05:11 and 05:30, and then the TRIM TANK XFRD memo between 05:30 and 05:33 would have displayed this information.

At 05:36 UTC, the pilots received a warning of fuel imbalance.

Rather than referring to the appropriate checklists, the crew actioned procedures from memory, and this resulted in the cross-feeding of fuel into an already leaking engine. 

The transferred fuel was lost through the fractured fuel line, which was leaking at about 13 tonnes per hour (more than 3.6 kg/s). This caused a higher-than-normal fuel flow through the fuel-oil heat exchanger, which in turn led to a drop in oil temperature and a rise in oil pressure for the no. 2 engine.

At 05:45 UTC, the pilots decided to divert to Lajes Air Base in the Azores. Initially there was a 14 degree heading deviation from their assigned heading of 230 degrees magnetic caused by the autopilot being in true heading mode. After 2 minutes Santa Maria Oceanic air traffic control radioed &quot;Transat 236 heavy maintain 230 magnetic heading&quot;. This transmission was not acknowledged, but the aircraft turned to the correct heading. They declared a fuel emergency with Santa Maria Oceanic air traffic control three minutes after the heading was corrected.

At 06:13 UTC, while still from Lajes and at , engine no. 2 flamed out from fuel starvation. Piché then initiated a descent to , which was the proper single-engine altitude for the weight of the plane at that time. Ten minutes later, the crew sent a mayday to Santa Maria Oceanic air traffic control.

Thirteen minutes later, at 06:26 UTC and about from Lajes Air Base, engine no. 1 also flamed out, requiring the plane to glide the remaining distance. Without engine power, the plane lost its primary source of electrical power. The emergency ram air turbine deployed automatically to provide essential power for critical sensors and flight instruments to fly the aircraft as well as enough hydraulic pressure to operate the primary flight controls (without which the aircraft would be uncontrollable). The aircraft lost hydraulic power for the flaps, alternate brakes, and spoilers. The slats would still be powered, while the primary brakes would be able to operate a limited number of times using pressure stored in the brake accumulator. With neither engine running, there was no source of bleed air to maintain cabin pressurization. Five minutes later, at 06:31 UTC, the oxygen masks dropped down in the passenger cabin.

Military air traffic controllers guided the aircraft to the airport with their radar system. The descent rate of the plane was about . They calculated they had about 15 to 20 minutes left before they would be forced to ditch in the ocean. The air base was sighted a few minutes later. Piché executed one 360° turn, and then a series of &quot;S&quot; turns, to dissipate excess altitude.

At 06:45 UTC, the plane touched down hard, around past the threshold of runway 33, at a speed around , bounced once, and then touched down again, roughly from the threshold. Maximum emergency braking was applied and retained, and the plane came to a stop after a landing run that consumed of the runway. Because the antiskid and brake modulation systems were inoperative, the eight main wheels locked up, the tires abraded and fully deflated within , and the wheels themselves were worn down to the axle journals during rollout.

Fourteen passengers and two crew members had minor injuries, while two passengers had serious injuries during the evacuation of the aircraft. The plane suffered structural damage to the main landing gear (from the hard touchdown and the abrasion of the locked wheels against the runway surface during the landing roll) and the lower fuselage (both structural deformation from the hard touchdown and various punctures from impact by pieces of debris shed from the main landing gear).

==Investigation==
The Portuguese Aviation Accidents Prevention and Investigation Department (GPIAA) investigated the accident along with Canadian and French authorities.

The investigation revealed that the primary causal factors of the accident were crew actions in mishandling a fuel leak in the number two engine.

The fuel leak resulted from fitment of an incorrect part to the hydraulics system by Air Transat maintenance staff as part of routine maintenance. The engine had been replaced with a spare engine, lent by Rolls-Royce, from an older model which did not include a hydraulic pump. Despite the lead mechanic&#x27;s concerns, Air Transat authorized the use of a part from a similar engine, an adaptation that did not maintain adequate clearance between the hydraulic lines and the fuel line. This lack of clearance, of the order of millimetres from the intended part, allowed chafing between the lines to rupture the fuel line, causing the leak. 

Air Transat accepted responsibility for the accident and was fined C$250,000 by the Canadian government, which was the largest fine in Canadian history.

The conclusions reached in the accident report revealed that:

*The flight crew did not detect that a fuel problem existed until the Fuel ADV advisory was displayed and the fuel imbalance was noted on the Fuel ECAM page.
*The crew did not correctly evaluate the situation before taking action.
*The flight crew did not recognize that a fuel leak situation existed and carried out the fuel imbalance procedure from memory, which resulted in the fuel from the left tanks being fed to the leak in the right engine.
*Conducting the fuel imbalance procedure by memory meant that the crew did not read the Caution note in the relevant checklist. Doing so might have caused the crew to consider timely actioning of the fuel leak procedure.
*Although there were a number of other indications that a significant fuel loss was occurring, the crew did not conclude that a fuel leak situation existed – not actioning the fuel leak procedure was the key factor that led to the fuel exhaustion.

Nevertheless, the pilots returned to a heroes&#x27; welcome from the Canadian press as a result of their successful unpowered landing. In 2002, Captain Piché was awarded the Superior Airmanship Award by the Air Line Pilots&#x27; Association.

== Aftermath ==
Following the accident investigation, the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) issued F-2002-548B, requiring a detailed fuel-leak procedure in the flight manual and the need for crews to be aware of this. This was later cancelled and replaced by F-2005-195. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued AD 2006-02-01, effective February 3, 2006, requiring new airplane flight manual procedures to follow in the event of a fuel leak for Airbus Model A330 and A340 aircraft.

The accident led to the DGAC and FAA issuing an airworthiness directive (AD), requiring all operators of Airbus models A318, A319, A320 and A321 narrow-body aircraft to revise their flight manuals, stressing that crews should ensure that any fuel imbalance is not caused by a fuel leak before opening the cross-feed valve. The AD required all airlines operating these Airbus models to make revisions to the flight manuals before any further flights were allowed. The FAA gave a 15-day grace period before enforcing the AD. Airbus also modified its computer systems; the on-board computer now checks all fuel levels against the flight plan. It now gives a clear warning if fuel is being expended beyond the specified fuel consumption rate of the engines. Rolls-Royce also issued a bulletin advising of the incompatibility of the relevant engine parts.

This was the longest passenger aircraft glide without engines. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service with Air Transat in December 2001, with the nickname &quot;Azores Glider&quot;. It was placed into storage on March 17, 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 18, 2021, the aircraft made its last flight with Air Transat and was subsequently returned to the lessor AerCap. The aircraft was re-registered as N271AD.

Margaret McKinnon, a postdoctoral psychology student at Baycrest Health Sciences in Toronto at the time, was a passenger on her honeymoon on Flight 236. She and her colleagues recruited 15 other passengers in a study of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), published in August 2014 in the academic journal &quot;Clinical Psychological Science&quot;, which compared details recalled by passengers with PTSD with those recalled by passengers without PTSD and with a control group.

==In popular culture==
* The events of Flight 236 were featured in &quot;Flying on Empty&quot;, a season-one (2003) episode of the Canadian TV series &quot;Mayday&quot; (called &quot;Air Emergency&quot; and &quot;Air Disasters&quot; in the U.S. and &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot; in the UK and elsewhere). The program begins with a title card announcing &quot;This is a true story. The flight crew, Airbus. and Air Transat declined to take part. The reconstruction is based on expert opinion and known facts about the flight.&quot;
* The flight was also included in a &quot;Mayday&quot; sixth season (2007) &quot;Science of Disaster&quot; special titled &quot;Who&#x27;s Flying the Plane?&quot; 
* MSNBC produced a report on the incident with the title &quot;On a Wing and a Prayer&quot;, which first aired in the U.S. on August 7, 2005.
* The story of Robert Piché is depicted in the 2010 French Canadian biographical drama film &quot;Piché: The Landing of a Man&quot; culminating with the events on Flight 236. Captain Piché is portrayed by both Genie Award-winning actor Michel Côté and his son Maxime LeFlaguais.

<text>Arno Funke (born 14 March 1950), alias Dagobert, is a reformed German extortionist, now an author.

==Life==

An automotive and sign painter by trade, Funke was later medically examined at trial and said to have minor brain damage likely from the fumes from his workspace. He began his criminal career in 1988 when he found himself needing a small amount of money to kickstart a new career as a sausage-vendor on Germany&#x27;s streets.

==Extortions==
Funke planted a small bomb in a KaDeWe department store in West Berlin, and phoned from East Berlin. At the time, East Berlin&#x27;s infrastructure and police services were often not integrated with their Western equivalents. He successfully extorted 500,000 DM. Having spent the money, Funke returned to extortion in 1992. This time he chose Karstadt, Germany&#x27;s largest department store. On 13 June, a bomb detonated in a shop in Hamburg. Funke set up a complex money transfer scheme, with a box attached magnetically to a train. In August, he escaped with the box, but it contained only a few hundred marks, otherwise being filled with scraps of paper. He continued to target Karstadt stores through 1993 and 1994, but did not obtain any further money. One of his bombs did $4.5 million in damage in the sporting section of Karstadt in Bremen.

For six years, the extortionist who had started calling himself &quot;Dagobert&quot; after the German name for Scrooge McDuck, baffled police and entertained the general public. Due to his careful precision and effort to eliminate any chance of anybody being hurt in his attacks, he was seen as a harmless prankster by many, and &quot;I am Dagobert&quot; T-shirt sales were brisk at kiosks throughout the city. When police released a tape of his voice in an attempt to trace him, a music group mixed it into a rap song dedicated to &quot;Dagobert&quot;, during his later trial he would explain that he wanted to be like the Disney character and &quot;swim in money&quot;.

To collect his blackmail payments, he would devise intricate mechanical devices that would speed along railroad tracks, have false bottoms and he continued to elude detection, though he barely eluded capture at the last minute several times, including once when a pursuing detective slipped on wet leaves and fell.

==End of criminal career==

He was finally caught on 22 April 1994, and sentenced to 7 years and 9 months imprisonment; the sentence was later increased to 9 years imprisonment on appeal. It was estimated that the police had spent nearly $20 million on his pursuit.

He was released on parole after serving 6 years and 4 months on 15 August 2000. The expected media frenzy caused authorities to actually release him a day early to avoid the crowds.

==Life afterwards==

He wrote a book in prison about his exploits and has held a job since 1998 as a cartoonist at a publishing house under a work-release program. In 2004 a British television studio created a special entitled &quot;The Heist&quot; which saw Funke teamed with Peter Scott, Mathew Bevan, Joey Pyle and Terry Smith (All celebrated criminals in different fields of expertise) in an attempt to &quot;steal&quot; a painting from the London Art Fair, steal a TVR Sagaris prototype and hold hostage a prize-winning racehorse whilst attempting to extort a ransom of the horse owner.
In 2013 he was in the TV &quot;Jungle Camp&quot;, the German version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;

<text>John Christopher Kunze (August 4, 1744 – July 24, 1807) was an American Lutheran minister, educator, author and theologian.

==Life==
Kunze was born in Artern, a town in the Kyffhäuserkreis district of the Electorate of Saxony, to Jahn Godfried Kunze, a farmer and innkeeper. In 1758, when his parents died, Kunze began studying at the orphanage in Halle, Germany. He received his classical training in the gymnasia at Rossleben and Merseburg, and then attended the University of Leipzig where he studied history, philosophy and theology. He worked as a teacher and an orphanage inspector before becoming ordained as a Lutheran minister.

In 1770, Kunze emigrated to Colonial America to serve as second pastor at St. Michael&#x27;s and Zion Lutheran churches in Philadelphia. In 1771, he married Margaretta Henrietta (1751–1831), daughter of Rev. Henry Muhlenberg . Kunze was an active and passionate educator and was a strong advocate for teaching the English language to his fellow German immigrants and Lutheran pastors. As a part of this mission, Kunze began a pre-theological school in Philadelphia in 1773.

In 1779, he succeeded Muhlenberg as pastor of Zion Lutheran Church, becoming the senior Lutheran minister in Philadelphia and an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the board of trustees of the University of Pennsylvania. In 1780, he stepped down from the board to become the professor of German and Hebrew languages. 

At the university, he and a fellow German Lutheran pastor, Justus Henry Christian Helmuth, tried unsuccessfully to establish a German language college within the university. While at the university, Kunze set foundations for what later developed into the field of &quot;Semitics&quot;, including the study of Hebrew and Arabic. The university conferred the Master of Arts degree on him in 1780, and the Doctor of Divinity degree in 1783.

In 1784, Kunze accepted a position at Trinity and Christ Church, a newly formed congregation in New York City, and also became Professor of Oriental Languages at Columbia College. That same year, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. In 1785, Kunze served as an official translator for the United States Congress. Kunze was fluent in five languages and had also studied medicine, astronomy, and numismatics.

In 1795, he published &quot;Hymn and Prayer Book, for the Use of such Lutheran Churches as use the English Language&quot;, the first Lutheran hymn book in the English language. He also translated Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism into English.

With the death of John Christopher Hartwick in 1796, Kunze became the founding director of Hartwick Seminary. As a steward of Hartwick&#x27;s estate, Kunze worked to establish a Lutheran seminary in America. Kunze had been Hartwick&#x27;s personal choice as director of the seminary. Prominent political and religious leaders Jeremiah Van Rensselaer and Frederick Muhlenberg convinced Kunze to direct the seminary and teach theology at his home in New York City. In 1816, the New York State Legislature incorporated the new school—the first Lutheran seminary in America—as a classical academy and theological seminary, in the town of Hartwick, New York.

In addition to his work as an educator, Kunze had a talent for bringing people together by creating scholarly and cultural organizations. Kunze helped create the Society for Useful Knowledge and he founded the German Society of New York with Baron Friedrich von Steuben. He also helped form the Ministerium of New York, an organization of local Lutheran ministers, and served as its president until his death on July 24, 1807. He is buried at the Evergreens Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

<text>the Notre Dame Fighting Irish

Robert Perry Golic (born October 26, 1957) is an American former professional football player, television actor, radio personality and sports commentator.

Golic played defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons from 1979 to 1992 with the New England Patriots, Cleveland Browns, and Los Angeles Raiders. He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, winning a national championship in 1977 and earning unanimous All-American honors. In wrestling, he was a two-time All-American.

He is the older brother of Mike Golic and uncle of Mike Golic Jr.

==Early life==
Golic was born in Cleveland, Ohio to Dorothy and Louis Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Golic. The Golics are of Slovenian descent. He has two brothers, Greg and Mike, who also played in the NFL.

Golic&#x27;s father also went by the nickname Bob; however, they are not named with the generational titles of junior or senior. The elder Golic had a 7-year professional playing career in the Canadian Football League from 1956 to 1962. He played for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Montreal Alouettes and Saskatchewan Roughriders. He won the Grey Cup with Hamilton in 1957. Louis Robert Golic died on Friday, June 28, 2013, from heart failure.

Golic attended St. Joseph&#x27;s High School, at the time an all-boys school in Cleveland, where he played high school football and wrestled.

As a high school wrestler, Golic won the Ohio high school heavyweight championship in 1975, beating Harold Smith of Canton McKinley, a future Olympian. He also defeated future NFL player Tom Cousineau from cross-town all-boys school rival St. Edward High School in the tournament semifinals. The match between Golic and Cousineau, who would go on to place third, has been called &quot;one of the most memorable&quot; in the tournament&#x27;s history. Cousineau would go to be two-time All-American at linebacker at Ohio State. Golic and Cousineau would eventually become teammates in the NFL with the Cleveland Browns.

==College career==
Golic received a football scholarship to attend the University of Notre Dame, where he also wrestled. He played for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team from 1975 to 1978. Golic was a member of the 1977 NCAA national champion football team. He was selected as a second-team All-American for the 1977 season, and a unanimous first-team All-American in 1978.

Golic was one of the nation&#x27;s top collegiate wrestlers while at Notre Dame, with a three-year record of 54–4–1, finishing third in NCAA meet in 1976 and fourth in 1977. He was named a two-time All-American for Notre Dame as a heavyweight wrestler, capturing fourth place at the 1977 NCAA tournament and third place in 1978. 

He graduated from Notre Dame in 1979 with a B.A. in management.

==Professional career==
The New England Patriots chose Golic, as a linebacker, in the second round (52nd pick overall) of the 1979 NFL Draft, and he played for the Patriots from to .

Golic was cut by the Patriots going into the 1982 season and claimed on waivers by the Cleveland Browns. The Browns moved him from Linebacker to Nose Tackle.

After seven years with the Browns, Golic relocated to the Los Angeles Raiders through Plan B Free Agency where he played his last four NFL seasons. Golic was a 3-time Pro Bowler (1985, 1986, 1987) while playing with the Cleveland Browns.

==Post-playing career==
After retiring from football, Golic pursued an acting career. His first appearance was in &quot;Coach&quot;, playing one of Hayden Fox&#x27;s former players who went on to an NFL career, but now confiding to Hayden he has cancer due to anabolic steroid use. He then appeared in &quot;Saved by the Bell: The College Years&quot;, arguably his best known role, playing the role of Mike Rogers, a retired San Francisco 49ers player who became the resident adviser of Cal U, the fictional college attended by the cast. He also appeared in the role for the NBC made-for-TV-movie &quot;Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas&quot; in 1994. From 1996 until 1998, Golic was one of the members of the original &quot;Home and Family&quot; when it aired on The Family Channel (now known as Freeform).

Golic also hosted sports talk radio programs and did sports reporting for TV stations in Los Angeles; had a stint on Britain&#x27;s late 80s–90s NFL coverage on Channel 4, opposite presenter Gary Imlach; served as analyst on NBC&#x27;s NFL coverage from 1994 to 1996; and was a commentator for TNN&#x27;s coverage of the short-lived XFL in 2001.

In 2004, Golic returned to Northeast Ohio to host the afternoon drive time radio talk show on WNIR 100.1 FM in Akron. He is also a football analyst for WOIO Channel 19 in Cleveland (CBS).

Golic opened a restaurant and bar in downtown Cleveland&#x27;s Warehouse District (&quot;Bob Golic&#x27;s Sports Bar &amp; Grille&quot;). The restaurant closed in June 2014.

Golic was the Vice President of Football Operations for the Lingerie Football League expansion team, the Cleveland Crush until operations were ceased in 2015.

==Personal life==

His nephews are Mike Golic Jr., himself a former football player turned radio host, and Jake, who entered Notre Dame in 2009.

Mike Golic is a spokesperson for Nutrisystem after losing more than 50 lbs on the diet; however, Bob Golic has outdone his younger brother, dropping more than 140 lbs and returning to his high school weight of 245 lbs.

<doc id="1311901" wikidata="Q1130943" url="?curid=1311901" title="Copacabana (song)">
<text>&quot;Copacabana&quot;, also known as &quot;Copacabana (At the Copa)&quot;, is a song recorded by Barry Manilow. Written by Manilow, Jack Feldman, and Bruce Sussman, it was released in 1978 as the third single from Manilow&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Even Now&quot; (1978). The same year, &quot;Copacabana&quot; appeared in the soundtrack album of the film &quot;Foul Play&quot;.

==Background==
The song was inspired by a conversation between Manilow and Sussman at the Copacabana Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, when they discussed whether there had ever been a song called &quot;Copacabana&quot;. After returning to the U.S., Manilow – who, in the 1960s, had been a regular visitor to the Copacabana nightclub in New York City – suggested that Sussman and Feldman write the lyrics to a story song for him. They did so, and Manilow supplied the music.

Lola Falana inspired the song&#x27;s famous lyric, &quot;Her name is Lola / She was a showgirl...&quot;

The song&#x27;s lyrics refer to the Copacabana nightclub as &quot;the hottest spot north of Havana&quot;. The story focuses on Lola, a Copacabana showgirl, and her sweetheart Tony, a bartender at the club. One night, an ostentatiously wealthy man named Rico takes a fancy to Lola, but Tony intervenes when Rico becomes aggressive. The ensuing brawl ends in a gun being fired; although it is initially unclear &quot;who shot who[m]&quot;, it soon becomes apparent that Tony has died. Thirty years later, the club has been transformed into a discotheque, but a middle-aged Lola remains in her showgirl attire, now a customer at the bar who &quot;drinks herself half blind&quot; lamenting the loss of her youth, her sanity and Tony.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Copacabana&quot; debuted on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top 40 chart on July 7, 1978, and peaked at number 8. It has also reached the Top 10 in Belgium, Canada, France and the Netherlands. Internationally, the song is Manilow&#x27;s third-greatest hit. The track was his first gold single for a song he wrote or co-wrote. Additionally, the song earned Manilow his first and only Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance in February 1979.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;a Latin beat, congas and added percussion, strings and horns make it unusual.&quot;

==Television film and musical==

In 1985, Manilow and his collaborators Bruce Sussman and Jack Feldman expanded the song into a full–length, made-for-television musical, also called &quot;Copacabana&quot;, writing many additional songs and expanding the plot suggested by the song.

This film version was then further expanded by Manilow, Feldman, and Sussman into a full-length, two-act stage musical, again titled &quot;Copacabana&quot;, which ran at the Prince of Wales Theatre on London&#x27;s West End for two years prior to a lengthy tour of the UK. An American production was later mounted that toured the US for over a year. Over 200 productions of the show have since been mounted worldwide.

<text>The Copacabana is a New York City nightclub that has existed in several locations. In earlier locations, many entertainers, such as Danny Thomas, Pat Cooper, and the comedy team of Martin and Lewis, made their New York debuts at the Copacabana. The Barry Manilow song &quot;Copacabana&quot; (1978) is named after, and set in, the club. The nightclub was used as a setting in the films &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, &quot;Tootsie&quot;, &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot;, &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot;, &quot;The French Connection&quot;, &quot;Martin and Lewis&quot;, &quot;Green Book&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;, &quot;The Irishman&quot;, and &quot;One Night in Miami&quot;. It was also used in several plays, including Barry Manilow&#x27;s &quot;Copacabana&quot;. Also, the musical film &quot;Copacabana&quot; (1947), starring Groucho Marx and Carmen Miranda, takes place in the Copacabana, as does the made-for-television film based on the Manilow song, in which Manilow himself starred.

==History==
===The 1940s to the 1960s===
The Copacabana (named after Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro) opened on November 10, 1940, at 10 East 60th Street in New York City. Although the name of Monte Proser was on the lease, he had a powerful partner: mob boss Frank Costello. Proser (1904–1973), a native Englishman, was a well-connected nightclub owner and press agent whose various clients included Walt Disney, Maria Montez, Mary Pickford, and the Ziegfeld Follies. Costello put Jules Podell on the scene to look after his interests; Podell had a police record and would not have been an acceptable front man for the business, and indeed, the club faced tax problems and a racketeering investigation in 1944. However, by 1948, such pressure had lessened; Proser was out, and Podell was the official owner.

The Copacabana had Brazilian decor and Latin-themed orchestras, while the menu featured Chinese food. The club was also known for its chorus line, &quot;The Copacabana Girls&quot;. As early as 1945 it also featured performances of &quot;sweet&quot; big-band music by Shep Fields and his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra which were broadcast live on the WOR Radio Network. 

Podell originally had a strict &quot;no blacks&quot; policy. In 1944, Harry Belafonte, then a member of the U.S. Navy, was denied entry with a date. Eventually, Podell was persuaded to change his policy and Belafonte returned in the 1950s as a headliner at the club. Sammy Davis Jr. shattered attendance records with his run in May 1964 and Sam Cooke performed there on July 8, 1964, resulting in the LP &quot;Sam Cooke at the Copa&quot;. In July 1965, the Supremes made their debut there, resulting in Motown Records booking the Temptations, Martha and the Vandellas, and Marvin Gaye to perform at the Copa over the next few years. The Supremes also recorded The Supremes at the Copa, a live album, there in 1965 that just missed the Top 10, peaking at #11. Marvin Gaye also recorded a live album, as did The Temptations. The Supremes, who proved to be the most successful of all the Motown acts, released &quot;The Supremes: Live at the Copa Expanded Edition&quot; in 2012, featuring the much-sought-after original repertoire.

Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis were frequent performers at the club and performed their last show there on July 25, 1956, which can be seen in the TV movie &quot;Martin and Lewis&quot; (2002).

This nightclub achieved a degree of notoriety due to a May 16, 1957, incident involving members of the New York Yankees. On that evening, teammates Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, Hank Bauer, Yogi Berra, Johnny Kucks, and Billy Martin, along with the wives of all but Martin, arrived at the nightclub to celebrate Martin&#x27;s birthday. Sammy Davis Jr. happened to be the headliner. During the performance, a group of apparently intoxicated bowlers started to interfere with Davis&#x27; act, even hurling racial slurs at him. This behavior incensed the Yankees, especially Martin, since his roommate was Elston Howard, the first black player to join the Yankees. Tensions erupted between the two groups, and the resulting fracas made newspaper headlines. Several of the Yankees were fined. One of the bowlers, a Bronx deli owner, ended up with a concussion and a broken jaw, and sued Bauer for aggravated assault; the case was thrown out for insufficient evidence. Martin was later traded from the Yankees to the Kansas City Athletics, with this incident cited as a main cause.

===The 1960s and the 1970s===
Until 1972, mafioso Joe Gallo operated the venue. It was closed for three years in 1973 after Jules Podell died; after it reopened in 1976, at the height of the disco era, it operated as a discothèque. Barry Manilow&#x27;s hit 1978 song &quot;Copacabana (At The Copa)&quot; referred to the club; the song later became the basis for the made-for-television film in which Manilow himself starred; as of February 2021, it was not known how much of the film&#x27;s shooting used it as an actual location.

===After the 1970s===
In 1992, then-owner Peter Dorn moved the club from its original location to 617 West 57th Street. Dorn charged landlord Nicola Biase with &quot;not liking Hispanics&quot;, the stated reason for the move.

In 2001, the club was forced to move for a third time to 560 West 34th Street and Eleventh Avenue on the west side of Manhattan, when its landlord terminated its lease early to build office towers on the site. Since then it has presented mostly hip-hop and salsa acts.

On January 20, 2007, the club announced that it would have to move by July 1 because its current location was condemned due to the construction of the extension of the 7 line of the New York City Subway, as well as the construction of the now-cancelled World Product Center. June 30 of the same year was the last night the club was open, with El Gran Combo performing there. From late 2007 until the club reopened in 2011, the club was sharing space with the Columbus 72 nightclub, which shares the same owners.

In April 2010, the club owners were approved for a liquor license to operate the club in a new location at 760–766 8th Avenue, on the second and third floors. In November 2010, the club owners were granted permission to allow dancing by restaurant patrons as well as the general public, not limited to private parties and catered events. On July 12, 2011, the club re-opened to the public in Times Square at 268 West 47th Street. The first performer at the new location was world-renowned salsa musician Willie Colón.

On May 26, 2020, the club announced that it had closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and that it planned to reopen in 2021 at another location. It eventually reopened in February 2022 at 625 West 51st Street under the direction of Ruben Cabrera.

==Outside New York City==
A second Copacabana—the first outside New York—was readied for a grand opening in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on September 13, 2012, in the historic Las Olas District at 219 S. Andrews Avenue. On January 24, 2013, the location closed.

<text>Copacabana is the main Bolivian town on the shore of Lake Titicaca. The town has a large 17th-century shrine, the Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana, dedicated to Our Lady of Copacabana, the patron saint of Bolivia. The town is a tourism destination in Bolivia. It is also known for its trout and quaint atmosphere. Built between Mount Calvario and Mount Niño Calvario, the town has approximately 6,000 inhabitants. Copacabana&#x27;s religious celebrations, cultural heritage and traditional festivals are well known throughout Bolivia. Boats leave for Isla del Sol, the sacred Inca island, from Copacabana. Copacabana is served by Copacabana Airport.

== History ==

During the wars of independence, the Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana was despoiled of most of its rich ornaments and gifts, and ruthless plundering by faithless custodians in the course of political disturbances has further contributed to impoverish it. The edifices, originally very handsome, are in a state of sad neglect. It is a shrine for pilgrims from Bolivia and southern Peru, and on 6 August, the feast of its patron saint, it is attended by thousands.

Before 1534, Copacabana was an outpost of Inca occupation among dozens of other sites in Bolivia. The Incas held it as the key to the very ancient shrine and oracle on the Island of Titicaca, which they had adopted as a place of worship, adopting the veneration with which it was held by the Aymaras from time immemorial. At Copacabana, there were minor shrines in which the ceremonies of the Incas were observed along with those of the original inhabitants. When the Spaniards first visited the Islands of Titicaca and Loati, in 1534 and 1538, the Andean Cosmovision were abandoned and the Dominicans made Copacabana the centre of their missions. Non-monastic priests then replaced them at the instigation of the Viceroy Francisco de Toledo, and finally the mission and its annexes were entrusted to the Augustinians in 1589.

In 1582, the grandson of Inca ruler Manco Kapac, struck by the sight of the statues of the Blessed Virgin which he saw in some of the churches at La Paz, tried to make one himself, and after many failures, succeeded in producing one of excellent quality, and it was placed at Copacabana as the statue of the tutelar protectress of the community. Many miracles have been attributed to it, and its fame has spread far beyond the limits of its surroundings to all five continents. It is kept in a special chapel, where local Aymaras, Bolivians and those from all over the world are untiring in their devotions.

During the Great Indigenous Uprising of 1781, while the church itself was desecrated, the &quot;Camarin&quot;, as the chapel is called, remained untouched and exempt from spoiling. Copacabana is the scene of often boisterous indigenous celebrations. On 2 February and 6 August, Church festivals are celebrated with indigenous dances that the clergy have not been able to suppress entirely. Copacabana is surrounded by pre-Columbian ruins of considerable interest.

==Climate==
Copacabana has a cold subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwc&quot;), a rare variant of this type of climate, but commonplace near most of Lake Titicaca. Similar to many areas with this climate, Copacabana features a markedly drier &quot;low-sun&quot; season. Because of the high altitude of Copacabana, the town is chilly throughout the course of the year. However, because Copacabana is located in the tropics, there are only slight variations in temperatures. While daytime temperatures hover around throughout the year, nighttime temperatures during the &quot;low-sun&quot; season are somewhat cooler than at other times of the year. It is not uncommon for temperatures to drop below freezing during the &quot;low-sun&quot; season.

<text>OGame is a browser-based, money-management and space-war themed massively multiplayer online browser game. &quot;OGame&quot; was created in 2002 and is produced and maintained by Gameforge. It is available in multiple languages, and different nationalities have their own communities. The game does not differ between the nationality communities except in rare cases. Players are generally informed of news, rule changes, or new versions through the official forums.

As of January 2011, OGame.org has a total of 52 universes, including ten universes using the new redesign. More are being added periodically. The Ogame prOgame universe (Universe 35) has been discontinued as an exclusive for paying members, so anyone may now sign up for it.

==Gameplay==
All &quot;OGame&quot; universes consist of three classifications: galaxies, systems, and planet slots (which break down to planets, moons, and debris fields). All universes have up to 9 galaxies, each with 499 (1-499) systems, which have 15 planet slots.

Each player starts with one planet at randomly assigned coordinates in slots 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, in a random system and galaxy. The first planet always consists of 163 fields, which determine how many building upgrades can be built on the planet, regardless of the slot in the player&#x27;s system. Originally, the player&#x27;s empire could consist of up to 9 planets in any unoccupied planet slot, but with the redesign, that cap was lifted, albeit with the requirement that each planet required two additional levels of research, with a progressive cost. All construction, research, and missions are performed and launched from a planet or moon. Development is done through using five resources: metal, crystal, deuterium, energy, and dark matter. There are different ways to obtain these resources, including mining, trading, and raiding. Players are ranked according to their points, with one point awarded for every thousand resource units invested in construction, research, ships, or defense. No points are given for unspent resources.

===Combat===
Unlike many other real-time strategy games, &quot;OGame&quot; does not give the player constant control of their spacecraft. Instead, the player sends the ship(s) to a location (using the game&#x27;s coordinate system) and what happens when the fleet arrives is beyond the player&#x27;s control; in &quot;OGame&quot;, combat is resolved when fleets and/or defenses meet. The combat takes place instantly and consists of 1 to 6 rounds. Fleet attacks are usually aimed to obtain other players&#x27; planetary resources, which is called raiding, although players may also initiate fleet attacks to destroy an opponent&#x27;s fleet and collect resources from the debris field created from the battle. Defenses are built to defend a planet against an attacking enemy fleet. If destroyed, 70 percent of defensive structures will be recovered after the battle. Destroyed ships are not recovered.

===Alliances===
An alliance is a group of players who have banded together and is mostly used for solidarity purposes. Alliances are created for players to protect each other from attacks, join together to raid other planets, or to promote free trade among members. Members of an alliance can use the Alliance Combat System, available in some universes, to synchronize fleet movements and missions with members of the same alliance and temporarily deploy a fleet on an ally&#x27;s planet. Alliances can utilize certain forums on the boards to instigate wars or truces between each other, as well as create their own alliance page in the game itself.

===Merchants===
Players can hire a merchant using dark matter to trade one resource type for another. The amount of resources traded is limited to the amount of free space in one&#x27;s storage buildings and the amount of dark matter the player has.

===Officers===
&quot;OGame&quot; offers four different Officers and a Commander, each costs a set amount of Dark Matter, obtained with in-game exploration or by paying money, to &#x27;hire&#x27; for either 1 week or 3 months. The names of the four different officers are the Engineer, the Geologist, the Technocrat and the Fleet Admiral. Each one improves certain elements of chance or resource production.

The Commander officer gives the user extra benefits such as an ad-free interface, a building queue, an improved galaxy view with added information, a message filter, extra shortcuts to enhance play and an &#x27;Empire&#x27; view. Empire view gives the player an interface which shows information about all planets, including mine and power plant levels and ships currently docked. Upgrades to buildings can be performed via the Empire view.

===Resources===
There are three main resources: Metal, Crystal and Deuterium.

The three main resources (Metal, Crystal, Deuterium) can be created via mines or money. There are separate mines for each resource which can be upgraded to produce the resources faster. These resources are used for making buildings, ships, defenses and for researching technology. To run the mines, energy is needed. Energy is produced by creating the following: solar plant, solar satellites (available via shipyard), and fusion reactor (converts a specified amount of deuterium into energy). These buildings can also be upgraded to produce more energy.

Dark Matter, however, cannot be created. Fleets can be sent out on expeditions to search for it. It can also be bought with real money. Dark Matter is used to &quot;call a trader&quot; who trades the main three resources, to buy an officer, or move an existing planet.

Deuterium is the most particularly valuable resource because it seconds as fuel for ships. The bigger the fleet of ships, the more fuel is required to travel certain distances. Players with large fleets will find themselves selling their Metal and Crystal to buy Deuterium, as Deuterium mines are very expensive to upgrade along with maintaining a large fleet.

===Expeditions===
Expeditions are fleets that go outside the system but not to another. Astrophysics is needed for expeditions. Expeditions can find resources and the valuable Dark Matter.

===Moons===
Moons are created when a debris field is large enough to form together. The largest debris fields will yield a maximum 20 percent chance of creating a Moon, and they will also create the Moons with the most available space. Players in an alliance will often give each other &quot;moonshots&quot; by attacking a certain number of ships purposefully left behind.

Once a planet has a Moon orbiting it, many more options are opened up for movement and tracking other ships. A Jump Gate can be built which allows players to send ships instantly from Jump Gate to Jump Gate. After a Jump Gate is used, there is an hour-long cooling period before it can be used again. A Sensor Phalanx also can be built, which tracks enemy ship movements in its range.

Building and upgrading on Moons uses fields just like planets, but Moons have far fewer fields to work with.

<text>Reminder software is a type of time management computer software that is designed to alert the user of important events that they have input to the program. Most programs provide a calendar or list view of events, as well as a reminding technique. Most common reminding techniques are pop-up dialog boxes and auditory alarms.

Events may include birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, various one-time events. Often the software comes with a set of pre-installed events (such as holidays) and allows the user to create custom events.

As software has made the transition to web services, a number of online reminder services have appeared. Users subscribed to those services usually receive their reminders by email or SMS. Context-aware reminder systems can set reminders based on the user&#x27;s current location.

<text>Fashion law deals with legal issues that impact the fashion industry. Fundamental issues in fashion law include intellectual property, business, and finance, with subcategories ranging from employment and labor law to real estate, international trade, and government regulation. Fashion law also includes related areas such as textile production, modelling, media, the cosmetics and perfume industries, questions of safety and sustainability, dress codes and religious apparel, consumer culture, privacy and wearable tech, and civil rights. Clothing laws varies by country.

==History==

Fashion has long been subject to legal regulation throughout history, from sumptuary laws that limit who can wear certain garments to trade restrictions and varying degrees of intellectual property protection. However, fashion law was not conceived as a distinct legal field until the mid- to late-2000s.

In May 2004, a group of French lawyers led by Annabelle Gauberti published a supplement entitled &quot;Droit du luxe&quot; (which translates into either &quot;law of luxury goods&quot; or &quot;luxury law&quot;) in the prestigious French legal magazine &quot;Revue Lamy Droit des Affaires&quot;. This supplement explored specific legal and tax issues at stake in the fashion and luxury goods sectors and was one of the earliest analyses of the interactions between the legal field and the fashion and luxury goods industries.

Professor Susan Scafidi offered the first course in Fashion Law at Fordham Law School in 2006, thus creating a new field of legal study. At the same time, Fashion Law courses for designers were developed by Guillermo Jimenez at the Fashion Institute of Technology and Deborah McNamara at Parsons School of Design. In 2008, Scafidi wrote that fashion law was only then starting to be recognized as a distinct area of law.

In 2010, the world&#x27;s first academic centre dedicated to fashion law, the Fashion Law Institute, launched with the support of Diane von Furstenberg and the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Since then a number of other institutions around the world have offered courses or programs in the area of fashion law. These include the University of Milan, the University of Insubria, the Instituto Brasileiro de Negócios e Direito da Moda, University at Buffalo Law School, Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, New York Law School, New York University, the Fashion Law Project at Loyola Law School, the Moda Hukuku Enstitusu in Turkey, the annual Fashion Law Week at Howard University, and McGill University Faculty of Law.
Fashion law has also developed into an established field of practice and study. In 2010, designer-turned-lawyer Brittany Rawlings led the first Fashion Law practice group dedicated entirely to issues that arise throughout the life of a fashion business. The New York City Bar Association has had a dedicated Fashion Law Committee since January 2011, and the New York County Lawyer&#x27;s Association has had a Fashion Law Subcommittee since September 2011.

While double-digit turnover growth is being generated by many companies involved in the fashion and luxury goods sectors, an increasing number of lawsuits are filed in this industry, and more legal practitioners are focusing their practice on this particular industry and sector. The international association of lawyers for the creative industries (ialci) was founded in 2013 during Paris Fashion Week. The goal of the association is to provide relevant, useful business and legal knowledge and solutions regarding the creative industries, including fashion and luxury goods.

==Segments of Fashion Law==

===Intellectual Property===
Intellectual property protection has been a substantial legal concern in fashion since the emergence of fashion brands in the 19th century. It has been the subject of congressional debate, multiple academic articles, and the first fashion law blog, as well as a major exhibit at the Fashion Institute of Technology Museum in New York. Key issues include:

*the scope of copyright protection, 
*trademark infringement and counterfeit goods,
*utility patents, particularly in connection with advances in technology, 
*the use of design patents as an alternative or supplement to copyright protection, and
*comparative international standards.

A prominent related issue has been cultural appropriation, such as the use of Native American or religious designs by commercial fashion brands.

===Financing and Corporate Structures===

Fashion law encompasses the broad spectrum of issues pertinent to starting and funding a fashion business, such as:

*the widespread use of factoring, 
*the influx of private equity investment, and 
*initial public offerings by major fashion brands.

===Manufacturing===

Legal issues in the production of clothing and accessories include:

*worker safety and other labor practices,
*garment district zoning, and 
*source indication.

===Marketing===

Legal issues addressed in connection with marketing include:

*labelling requirements, 
*licensing, and
*deceptive advertising.

===Retail===

Legal issues connected with the retail environment include:

*consumer data privacy and the security of credit card information, 
*discrimination based on racial profiling, and
*real-estate leasing and ownership.

===Ethics, Sustainability, and Economic Development===
Concerns pertaining to fashion ethics, sustainability and economic development have had a substantial impact on the industry, affecting both the legal framework and self-regulation initiatives. Important issues have included: 
*organic certification, 
*greenwashing,
*supply-chain monitoring and certification standards (including the Higg Index and SA8000 certification),
*the regulation of digitally altered images,
*fair trade fashion, and
*the impact of philanthropic initiatives and clothing donation programs.

===International Trade===

In addition to the international implications of issues noted above, fashion law also addresses other matters connected to international business transactions, including:

*grey market goods,
*import and export quotas,
*transfer pricing taxation, and
*customs duties.

===Modelling Law===

The legal status of models has become a prominent issue in fashion law, as exemplified by:

*The regulation of models&#x27; weight in places, such as Madrid, Milan, and Israel;
*New York&#x27;s enactment of a statute giving underage models protection under the state&#x27;s child labor law; 
*antitrust enforcement in relation to model pay-rates; and 
*efforts to curb fashion-related human trafficking.

<text>Thiele/Small parameters (commonly abbreviated T/S parameters, or TSP) are a set of electromechanical parameters that define the specified low frequency performance of a loudspeaker driver. These parameters are published in specification sheets by driver manufacturers so that designers have a guide in selecting off-the-shelf drivers for loudspeaker designs. Using these parameters, a loudspeaker designer may simulate the position, velocity and acceleration of the diaphragm, the input impedance and the sound output of a system comprising a loudspeaker and enclosure. Many of the parameters are strictly defined only at the resonant frequency, but the approach is generally applicable in the frequency range where the diaphragm motion is largely pistonic, i.e., when the entire cone moves in and out as a unit without cone breakup.

Rather than purchase off-the-shelf components, loudspeaker design engineers often define desired performance and work backwards to a set of parameters and manufacture a driver with said characteristics or order it from a driver manufacturer. This process of generating parameters from a target response is known as synthesis. Thiele/Small parameters are named after A. Neville Thiele of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and Richard H. Small of the University of Sydney, who pioneered this line of analysis for loudspeakers. A common use of Thiele/Small parameters is in designing PA system and hi-fi speaker enclosures; the TSP calculations indicate to the speaker design professionals how large a speaker cabinet will need to be and how large and long the bass reflex port (if it is used) should be.

==History==

The 1925 paper of Chester W. Rice and Edward W. Kellogg, fueled by advances in radio and electronics, increased interest in direct radiator loudspeakers. In 1930, A. J. Thuras of Bell Labs patented (US Patent No. 1869178) his &quot;Sound Translating Device&quot; (essentially a vented box) which was evidence of the interest in many types of enclosure design at the time.

Progress on loudspeaker enclosure design and analysis using acoustic analogous circuits by academic acousticians like Harry F. Olson continued until 1954 when Leo L. Beranek of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published &quot;Acoustics&quot;, a book summarizing and extending the electroacoustics of the era. J. F. Novak used novel simplifying assumptions in an analysis in a 1959 paper which led to a practical solution for the response of a given loudspeaker in sealed and vented boxes, and also established their applicability by empirical measurement. In 1961, leaning heavily on Novak&#x27;s work, A. N. Thiele described a series of sealed and vented box &quot;alignments&quot; (i.e., enclosure designs based on electrical filter theory with well-characterized behavior, including frequency response, power handling, cone excursion, etc.) in a publication in an Australian journal. This paper remained relatively unknown outside Australia until it was re-published in the &quot;Journal of the Audio Engineering Society&quot; in 1971. It is important to note that Thiele&#x27;s work neglected enclosure losses and, although the application of filter theory is still important, his alignment tables now have little real-world utility due to neglecting enclosure losses.

Many others continued to develop various aspects of loudspeaker enclosure design in the 1960s and early 1970s. From 1968 to 1972, J. E. Benson published three articles in an Australian journal that thoroughly analyzed sealed, vented and passive radiator designs, all using the same basic model, which included the effects of enclosure, leakage and port losses. Beginning in June 1972, Richard H. Small published a series of very influential articles on direct radiator loudspeaker system analysis, including closed-box, vented-box, and passive-radiator loudspeaker systems, in the &quot;Journal of the Audio Engineering Society&quot;, restating and extending Thiele&#x27;s work. These articles were also originally published in Australia, where he had attended graduate school, and where his thesis supervisor was J. E. Benson. The work of Benson and Small overlapped considerably, but differed in that Benson performed his work using computer programs and Small used analog simulators. Small also analyzed the systems including enclosure losses. Richard H. Small and Garry Margolis, the latter of JBL, published an article in the &quot;Journal of the Audio Engineering Society&quot; (June 1981), which recast much of the work that had been published up till then into forms suited to the programmable calculators of the time.

==Fundamental parameters==

These are the physical parameters of a loudspeaker driver, as measured at small signal levels, used in the equivalent electrical circuit models. Some of these values are neither easy nor convenient to measure in a finished loudspeaker driver, so when designing speakers using existing drive units (which is almost always the case), the more easily measured parameters listed under &quot;Small Signal Parameters&quot; are more practical:

*formula_1 – Equivalent piston area of the driver diaphragm, in square metres.
*formula_2 – Mass of the driver diaphragm and voice-coil assembly, including acoustic load, in kilograms. The mass of the driver diaphragm and voice-coil assembly alone is known as formula_3.
*formula_4 – Compliance of the driver&#x27;s suspension, in metres per newton (the reciprocal of its &#x27;stiffness&#x27;).
*formula_5 – The mechanical resistance of the driver&#x27;s suspension (i.e., &#x27;lossiness&#x27;), in N·s/m.
*formula_6 – Voice coil inductance, in henries (H) (typically measured at 1 kHz for woofers).
*formula_7 – DC resistance of the voice coil, in ohms.
*formula_8 – The product of magnetic flux density in the voice-coil gap and the length of wire in the magnetic field, in tesla-metres (T·m).

==Small signal parameters==

These values can be determined by measuring the input impedance of the driver, near the resonance frequency, at small input levels for which the mechanical behavior of the driver is effectively linear (i.e., proportional to its input). These values are more easily measured than the fundamental ones above. The small signal parameters are:

*formula_9 – Resonance frequency of driver
:formula_10
*formula_11 – Driver formula_12 at formula_9 considering electrical resistance formula_7 only
:formula_15
*formula_16 – Driver formula_12 at formula_9 considering driver nonelectrical losses only
:formula_19
*formula_20 – Total driver formula_12 at formula_9 resulting from all driver resistances
:formula_23
*formula_24 – Volume of air having the same acoustic compliance as driver suspension
:formula_25
:where formula_26 is the density of air (1.184 kg/m3 at 25 °C), and formula_27 is the speed of sound (346.1 m/s at 25 °C). Using SI units, the result will be in cubic metres. To convert formula_24 to litres, multiply by 1000.
*formula_5– Mechanical resistance of driver suspension
:formula_30
*formula_4 – Mechanical compliance of driver suspension
:formula_32

==Large signal parameters==

These parameters are useful for predicting the approximate output of a driver at high input levels, though they are harder, sometimes extremely hard or impossible, to accurately measure. In addition, power compression, thermal, and mechanical effects due to high signal levels (e.g., high electric current and voltage, extended mechanical motion, and so on) all change driver behavior, often increasing distortion of several kinds:

*formula_33 – Maximum linear peak (or sometimes peak-to-peak) excursion (in mm) of the cone. Note that, because of mechanical issues, the motion of a driver cone becomes non-linear with large excursions, especially those in excess of this parameter.
*formula_34 – Maximum physical excursion of the driver before physical damage. With a sufficiently large electrical input, the excursion will cause damage to the voice coil or another moving part of the driver. In addition, arrangements for voice coil cooling (e.g., venting of the pole piece, or openings in the voice coil former above the coil itself, both allowing heat dissipation with air flow) will themselves change behaviors with large cone excursions. 
*formula_35 – Thermal power handling capacity of the driver, in watts. This value is difficult to characterize and is often overestimated, by manufacturers and others. As the voice coil heats, it changes dimension to some extent, and changes electrical resistance to a considerable extent. The latter changes the electrical relationships between the voice coil and passive crossover components, changing the slope and crossover points designed into the speaker system. 
*formula_36 – Peak displacement volume, calculated by formula_36 = formula_1·formula_33

==Other parameters==

*formula_40 – The impedance of the driver at formula_9, used when measuring formula_11 and formula_16.
:formula_44
*formula_45 – The efficiency bandwidth product, a rough indicator measure. A common rule of thumb indicates that for formula_46, a driver is perhaps best used in a vented enclosure, while formula_47 indicates a sealed enclosure. For formula_48, either enclosure may be used effectively.
:formula_49
*formula_50 – The nominal impedance of the loudspeaker, typically 4, 8 or 16 ohms.
*formula_51 – The reference or &quot;power available&quot; efficiency of the driver, in percent.
:formula_52
:The expression formula_53 can be replaced by the value 5.445×10−4 m2·s/kg for dry air at 25 °C. For 25 °C air with 50% relative humidity the expression evaluates to 5.365×10−4 m2·s/kg.
:A version that is more easily calculated with typical published parameters is:
:formula_54
:The expression formula_55 can be replaced by the value 9.523×10−7 s3/m3 for dry air at 25 °C. For 25 °C air with 50% relative humidity the expression evaluates to 9.438×10−7 s3/m3.
*From the efficiency, we may calculate sensitivity, which is the sound pressure level a speaker produces for a given input:
:A speaker with an efficiency of 100% (1.0) would output a watt for every watt of input. Considering the driver as a point source in an infinite baffle, at one metre this would be distributed over a hemisphere with area formula_56 m2 for an intensity of formula_57 = 0.159155 W/m2. The auditory threshold is taken to be 10–12 W/m2 (which corresponds to a pressure level of 20×10−6 Pa). Therefore a speaker with 100% efficiency would produce an SPL equal to 10log(0.159155/10–12), which is 112.02 dB. 
:The SPL at 1 metre for an input of 1 watt is then: dB(1 watt) = 112.02 + 10·log(formula_51)
:The SPL at 1 metre for an input of 2.83 volts is then: dB(2.83 V) = dB(1 watt) + 10·log(8/formula_59) = 112.02 + 10·log(formula_51) + 10·log(8/formula_59)

==Qualitative descriptions==
; formula_9
: Resonance frequency of driver, measured in hertz (Hz). The frequency at which the combination of the energy stored in the moving mass and suspension compliance is maximum, and results in maximum cone velocity. A more compliant suspension or a larger moving mass will cause a lower resonance frequency, and vice versa. Usually it is less efficient to produce output at frequencies below formula_9, and input signals significantly below formula_9 can cause large excursions, mechanically endangering the driver. Woofers typically have an formula_9 in the range of 13–60 Hz. Midranges usually have an formula_9 in the range of 60–500 Hz and tweeters between 500 Hz and 4 kHz. A typical factory tolerance for the value of formula_9 is ±15%.

; formula_20
: A unitless measurement, characterizing the combined electric and mechanical damping of the driver. In electronics, formula_12 is the inverse of the damping ratio. The value of formula_20 is proportional to the energy stored, divided by the energy dissipated, and is defined at resonance (formula_9). Most drivers have formula_20 values between 0.2 and 0.5, but there are valid (if unusual) reasons to have a value outside this range.

; formula_16
: A unitless measurement, characterizing the mechanical damping of the driver, that is, the losses in the suspension (surround and spider). It varies roughly between 0.5 and 10, with a typical value around 3. High formula_16 indicates lower mechanical losses, and low formula_16 indicates higher losses. The main effect of formula_16 is on the impedance of the driver, with high formula_16 drivers displaying a higher impedance peak. One predictor for low formula_16 is a metallic voice-coil former. These act as eddy-current brakes and increase damping, reducing formula_16. They must be designed with an electrical break in the cylinder (so no conducting loop). Some speaker manufacturers have placed shorted turns at the top and bottom of the voice coil to prevent it leaving the gap, but the sharp noise created by this device when the driver is overdriven is alarming and was perceived as a problem by owners. High formula_16 drivers are often built with nonconductive formers made from paper or various plastics.

; formula_11
: A unitless measurement, describing the electrical damping of the loudspeaker. As the coil of wire moves through the magnetic field, it generates a current which opposes the motion of the coil. This so-called &quot;Back-EMF&quot; (proportional to formula_8 × velocity) decreases the total current through the coil near the resonance frequency, reducing cone movement and increasing impedance. In most drivers, formula_11 is the dominant factor in the voice coil damping. formula_11 depends on amplifier output impedance. The formula above assumes zero output impedance. When an amplifier with nonzero output impedance is used, its output impedance should be added to formula_7 for calculations involving formula_11.

; formula_8
: Measured in tesla-metres (T·m). Technically this is formula_88 or formula_89 (a vector cross product), but the standard geometry of a circular coil in an annular voice-coil gap gives formula_90. formula_88 is also known as the &#x27;force factor&#x27; because the force on the coil imposed by the magnet is formula_88 multiplied by the current through the coil. The higher the formula_88 product, the larger the force that is generated by a given current flowing through the voice coil. formula_88 has a very strong effect on formula_11.

; formula_24
: Measured in litres (L) or cubic metres, it is an inverse measure of the &#x27;stiffness&#x27; of the suspension with the driver mounted in free air. It represents the volume of air that has the same stiffness as the driver&#x27;s suspension when acted on by a piston of the same area (formula_1) as the cone. Larger values mean lower stiffness, and generally require larger enclosures. formula_24 varies with the square of the diameter. A typical factory measurement tolerance for formula_24 is ±20–30%.

; formula_2
: Measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg), this is the mass of the cone, coil, voice-coil former and other moving parts of a driver, including the acoustic load imposed by the air in contact with the driver cone. formula_3 is the cone/coil mass without the acoustic load, and the two should not be confused. Some simulation software calculates formula_2 when formula_3 is entered. formula_3 can be very closely controlled by the manufacturer.

; formula_5
: Units are not usually given for this parameter, but it is in mechanical &#x27;ohms&#x27;. formula_5 is a measurement of the losses, or damping, in a driver&#x27;s suspension and moving system. It is the main factor in determining formula_16. formula_5 is influenced by suspension topology, materials, and by the voice-coil former (bobbin) material.

; formula_4
: Measured in metre per newton (m/N). Describes the compliance (i.e., the inverse of stiffness) of the suspension. The more compliant a suspension system is, the lower its stiffness, so the higher the formula_24 will be. formula_4 is proportional to formula_24 and thus has the same tolerance ranges.

; formula_7
: Measured in ohms (Ω), this is the DC resistance (DCR) of the voice coil, best measured with the cone blocked, or prevented from moving or vibrating because otherwise the pickup of ambient sounds can cause the measurement to be unreliable. formula_7 should not be confused with the rated driver impedance, formula_7 can be tightly controlled by the manufacturer, while rated impedance values are often approximate at best. American EIA standard RS-299A specifies that formula_7 (or DCR) should be at least 80% of the rated driver impedance, so an 8-ohm rated driver should have a DC resistance of at least 6.4 ohms, and a 4-ohm unit should measure 3.2 ohms minimum. This standard is voluntary, and many 8-ohm drivers have resistances of ≈5.5 ohms, and proportionally lower for lower rated impedances.

; formula_6
: Measured in henries (H), this is the inductance of the voice coil. The voice coil is a lossy inductor, in part due to losses in the pole piece, so the apparent inductance changes with frequency. Large formula_6 values limit the high-frequency output of the driver and cause response changes near cutoff. Simple modeling software often neglects formula_6, and so does not include its consequences. Inductance varies with excursion because the voice coil moves relative to the pole piece, acting like a sliding inductor core, increasing inductance on the inward stroke and decreasing it on the outward stroke in typical overhung voice coil arrangements. This inductance modulation is an important source of nonlinearity (distortion) in loudspeakers. Including a copper cap on the pole piece, or a copper shorting ring on it, can reduce the increase in impedance seen at higher frequencies in typical drivers, and also reduce the nonlinearity due to inductance modulation.

; formula_1
: Measured in square metres (m2). The effective projected area of the cone or diaphragm. It is difficult to measure and depends largely on the shape and properties of the surround. Generally accepted as the cone body diameter plus one third to one half the width of the annulus (surround). Drivers with wide roll surrounds can have significantly less formula_1 than conventional types with the same frame diameter.

; formula_33
: Specified in millimetres (mm). In the simplest form, subtract the height of the voice-coil winding from the height of the magnetic gap, take the absolute value and divide by 2. This technique was suggested by JBL&#x27;s Mark Gander in a 1981 AES paper, as an indicator of a loudspeaker motor&#x27;s linear range. Although easily determined, it neglects magnetic and mechanical non-linearities and asymmetry, which are substantial for some drivers. Subsequently, a combined mechanical/acoustical measure was suggested, in which a driver is progressively driven to high levels at low frequencies, with formula_33 determined by measuring excursion at a level where 10% THD is measured in the output. This method better represents actual driver performance, but is more difficult and time-consuming to determine.

; formula_35
: Specified in watts. Frequently two power ratings are given, an &quot;RMS&quot; rating and a &quot;music&quot; (or &quot;peak&quot;, or &quot;system&quot;) rating, usually peak is given as ≈2 times the RMS rating. Loudspeakers have complex behavior, and a single number is really unsatisfactory. There are two aspects of power handling: thermal and mechanical. The thermal capacity is related to coil temperature and the point where adhesives and coil insulation melt or change shape. The mechanical limit comes into play at low frequencies, where excursions are largest, and involves mechanical failure of some component. A speaker that can handle 200 watts thermally at 200 Hz, may sometimes be damaged by only a few watts at some very low frequency, like 10 Hz. Power handling specifications are usually generated destructively, by long-term industry standard noise signals (IEC 268, for example) that filter out low frequencies and test only the thermal capability of the driver. Actual mechanical power handling depends greatly on the enclosure in which the driver is installed.

; formula_36
: Specified in litres (L). The volume displaced by the cone, equal to the cone area (formula_1) multiplied by formula_33. A particular value may be achieved in any of several ways. For instance, by having a small cone with a large formula_33, or a large cone with a small formula_129. Comparing formula_36 values will give an indication of the maximum output of a driver at low frequencies. High formula_33, small cone diameter drivers are likely to be inefficient, since much of the voice-coil winding will be outside the magnetic gap at any one time and will therefore contribute little or nothing to cone motion. Likewise, large cone diameter, small formula_33 drivers are likely to be more efficient as they will not need, and so may not have, long voice coils.

; formula_51
: Reference efficiency, specified in percent (%). Comparing drivers by their calculated reference efficiency is often more useful than using &#x27;sensitivity&#x27; since manufacturer sensitivity figures are too often optimistic.

; &quot;Sensitivity&quot;
: The sound pressure, in dB, produced by a speaker in response to a specified stimulus. Usually this is specified at an input of 1 watt or 2.83 volts (2.83 volts = 1 watt into an 8-ohm load) at a distance of one metre.

==Measurement notes—large signal behavior==
Some caution is required when using and interpreting T/S parameters. Individual units may not match manufacturer specifications. Parameters values are almost never individually taken, but are at best averages across a production run, due to inevitable manufacturing variations. Driver characteristics will generally lie within a (sometimes specified) tolerance range. formula_4 is the least controllable parameter, but typical variations in formula_4 do not have large effects on the final response.

It is also important to understand that most T/S parameters are linearized small signal values. An analysis based on them is an idealized view of driver behavior, since the actual values of these parameters vary in all drivers according to drive level, voice coil temperature, over the life of the driver, etc. formula_4 decreases the farther the coil moves from rest. formula_8 is generally maximum at rest, and drops as the voice coil approaches formula_33. formula_7 increases as the coil heats and the value will typically double by 270 °C (exactly 266 °C for Cu and 254 °C for Al), at which point many voice coils are approaching (or have already reached) thermal failure.

As an example, formula_9 and formula_24 may vary considerably with input level, due to nonlinear changes in formula_4. A typical 110-mm diameter full-range driver with an formula_9 of 95 Hz at 0.5 V signal level, might drop to 64 Hz when fed a 5 V input. A driver with a measured formula_24 of 7 L at 0.5 V, may show a formula_24 increase to 13 L when tested at 4 V. formula_16 is typically stable within a few percent, regardless of drive level. formula_11 and formula_20 decrease &lt;13% as the drive level rises from 0.5 V to 4 V, due to the changes in formula_8. Because formula_24 can rise significantly and formula_9 can drop considerably, with a trivial change in measured formula_2, the calculated sensitivity value (formula_51) can appear to drop by &gt;30% as the level changes from 0.5 V to 4 V. Of course, the driver&#x27;s actual sensitivity has not changed at all, but the calculated sensitivity is correct only under some specific conditions. From this example, it is seen that the measurements to be preferred while designing an enclosure or system are those likely to represent typical operating conditions. Unfortunately, this level must be arbitrary, since the operating conditions are continually changing when reproducing music. Level-dependent nonlinearities typically cause lower than predicted output, or small variations in frequency response.

Level shifts caused by resistive heating of the voice coil are termed power compression. Design techniques which reduce nonlinearities may also reduce power compression, and possibly distortions not caused by power compression. There have been several commercial designs that have included cooling arrangements for driver magnetic structures, which are intended to mitigate voice coil temperature rise, and the attendant rise in resistance that is the cause of the power compression. Elegant magnet and coil designs have been used to linearize formula_8 and reduce the value and modulation of formula_6. Large, linear spiders can increase the linear range of formula_4, but the large signal values of formula_8 and formula_4 must be balanced to avoid dynamic offset.

==Lifetime changes in driver behavior==
The mechanical components in typical speaker drivers may change over time. Paper, a popular material in cone fabrication, absorbs moisture easily and unless treated may lose some structural rigidity over time. This may be reduced by coating with water-impregnable material such as various plastic resins. Cracks compromise structural rigidity and if large enough are generally non-repairable. Temperature has a strong, generally reversible effect; typical suspension materials become stiffer at lower temperatures. The suspension experiences fatigue, and also undergoes changes from chemical and environmental effects associated with aging such as exposure to ultraviolet light, and oxidation which affect foam and natural rubber components badly, though butyl, nitrile, SBR rubber, and rubber-plastic alloys (such as Santoprene) are more stable. The polyester type of polyurethane foam is highly prone to disintegration after 10 to 15 years. The changes in behavior from aging may often be positive, though since the environment that they are used in is a major factor the effects are not easily predicted. Gilbert Briggs, founder of Wharfedale Loudspeakers in the UK, undertook several studies of aging effects in speaker drivers in the 1950s and 1960s, publishing some of the data in his books, notably &quot;Loudspeakers: The Why and How of Good Reproduction&quot;.

There are also mechanical changes which occur in the moving components during use. In this case, however, most of the changes seem to occur early in the life of the driver, and are almost certainly due to relaxation in flexing mechanical parts of the driver (e.g., surround, spider, etc.). Several studies have been published documenting substantial changes in the T/S parameters over the first few hours of use, some parameters changing by as much as 15% or more over these initial periods. The proprietor of the firm GR Research has publicly reported several such investigations of several manufacturers&#x27; drivers. Other studies suggest little change, or reversible changes after only the first few minutes. This variability is largely related to the particular characteristics of specific materials, and reputable manufacturers attempt to take them into account. While there are a great many anecdotal reports of the audible effects of such changes in published speaker reviews, the relationship of such early changes to subjective sound quality reports is not completely clear. Some changes early in driver life are complementary (such as a reduction in formula_9 accompanied by a rise in formula_24) and result in minimal net changes (small fractions of a dB) in frequency response. If the performance of speaker system is critical, as with high order (complex) or heavily equalized systems, it is sensible to measure T/S parameters after a period of run-in (some hours, typically, using program material), and to model the effects of normal parameter changes on driver performance.

==Measurement techniques==
There are numerous methods to measure Thiele-Small parameters, but the simplest use the input impedance of the driver, measured near resonance. The impedance may be measured in free air (with the driver unhoused and either clamped to a fixture or hanging from a wire, or sometimes resting on the magnet on a surface) and/or in test baffles, sealed or vented boxes or with varying amounts of mass added to the diaphragm. Noise in the measurement environment can have an effect on the measurement, so one should measure parameters in a quiet acoustic environment.

The most common (DIY-friendly) method before the advent of computer-controlled measurement techniques is the classic free air constant current method, described by Thiele in 1961. This method uses a large resistance (e.g., formula_161 = 500 to 1000 ohms) in series with the driver and a signal generator is used to vary the excitation frequency. The voltage across the loudspeaker terminals is measured and considered proportional to the impedance. It is assumed that variations in loudspeaker impedance will have little effect on the current through the loudspeaker. This is an approximation, and the method results in formula_12 measurement errors for drivers with a high formula_40 – the measured value of formula_40 will always be somewhat low. This measurement can be corrected by measuring the total voltage across the calibration resistor and the driver (call this formula_165) at resonance and calculating the actual test current formula_166. You may then obtain a corrected formula_40 = formula_168.

A second method is the constant voltage measurement, where the driver is excited by a constant voltage, and the current passing through the coil is measured. The excitation voltage divided by the measured current equals the impedance.

A common source of error using these first two methods is the use of inexpensive AC voltage meters. Most inexpensive meters are designed to measure residential power frequencies (50–60 Hz) and are increasingly inaccurate at other frequencies (e.g., below 40 Hz or above a few hundred hertz). In addition, distorted or non–sine wave signals can cause measurement inaccuracies. Inexpensive voltmeters are also not very accurate or precise at measuring current and can introduce appreciable series resistance, which causes measurement errors.

A third method is a response to the deficiencies of the first two methods. It uses a smaller (e.g., 10 ohm) series resistor and measurements are made of the voltage across the driver, the signal generator, and/or series resistor for frequencies around resonance. Although tedious, and not often used in manual measurements, simple calculations exist which allow the true impedance magnitude and phase to be determined. This is the method used by many computer loudspeaker measurement systems. When this method is used manually, the result of taking the three measurements is that their ratios are more important than their actual value, removing the effect of poor meter frequency response.

<text>Yu Hua (; born 3 April, 1960) is a Chinese author, he is widely considered one of the greatest living authors in China.

Shortly after his debut as a fiction writer in 1983, his first breakthrough came in 1987, when he released the short story &quot;On the Road at Age Eighteen&quot;. Yu Hua was regarded as a promising avant-garde or post-New Wave writer. Many critics also regard him as a champion for Chinese meta-fictional or postmodernist writing. His novels &quot;To Live&quot; (1993) and &quot;Chronicle of a Blood Merchant&quot; (1995) were widely acclaimed. Other works like &quot;Brothers&quot; (2005–06) received mixed reviews domestically, but positive reviews abroad.

Yu Hua has written five novels, six collections of stories, and three collections of essays. His works have sold around a total of nine million copies and have been translated into over 20 languages.

==Background==
Yu was born in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, on 3 April, 1960. Yu Hua&#x27;s parents worked as doctors, so his family lived in a hospital compound across from the mortuary. His childhood proximity to death shaped his later works. He practiced dentistry for five years before turning to fiction writing in 1983 because he didn&#x27;t like &quot;looking into people’s mouths the whole day.&quot; For Yu Hua, the Cultural Revolution took place from the ages of seven to seventeen. It is for this reason that many of his works include the violence and chaos that were prevalent at the time. In his own words, “a calm, orderly society cannot produce such great works,” which is why one of the distinctive characteristics of his work is his penchant for detailed descriptions of brutal violence.

Yu Hua is interested in the interplay of diverse meaning constructions, particularly between imagination and reality. Yu Hua&#x27;s personal life is deeply reflected in his writing as a direct influence from the socio-economic challenges throughout his youth. There are many elements in Yu Hua&#x27;s writings that could have been influenced by his life. He is considered to belong to the “generation of the 60s,” which refers to writers that spend their whole childhood and teenage years during the Cultural Revolution. He was born in Hangzhou, but he spent his formative years in the Wuyuan Township in Haiyan, a small town that has been thought to be fairly monotonous, but much of Yu Hua&#x27;s writing uses it as the setting behind his characters. Yu Hua has stated that writing makes him feel like he is going back to Haiyan; thus, many of Yu Hua&#x27;s writing uses Haiyan as a story setting. After failing to enter the university, Yu Hua took a one-year program to become a dentist. He was a dentist for 6 years but then started writing more seriously when he grew bored of that lifestyle.

Yu Hua has stated that his writing has been heavily influenced by both Franz Kafka and Yasunari Kawabata, among others. He stated that by reading Kawabata&#x27;s work, he understood that the point of writing was to show human feelings. However, there is also a deep connection that Yu Hua has with his country and its history. His writing reflects that. In an interview with The New Yorker, he stated that, “My writing is always changing, because my country is always changing, and this inevitably affects my views and feelings about things.”

Yu Hua&#x27;s personal life was heavily influenced by the changes that China has gone through, which is perhaps why many of his early texts often portray the world as cold and ruthless, marked by graphic descriptions of physical violence and bodily mutilation. He stated in an interview that he grew up in a time when China went through many different changes in a relatively short period of time. He said, “I grew up during the Cultural Revolution. Then came Reform and Opening and the economy’s explosive takeoff in the 90s, and then came the fantastic wildness of the new century and our worldview and our value system were both turned upside down.” He has also said that childhood experiences will impact the life of a writer.

In recent years, Yu Hua has dedicated many of his works about China itself, both aimed at China and East Asia, and then also the Western world. He also writes a monthly column for The New York Times in which he describes issues about China. Many of his writings have been known for their violence, but he is also known for some of his more intimate style. For example, he stated in an interview that the book “To Live” addresses “the cruelty and violence of the Cultural Revolution,” but that he also has “milder stories” like “The Boy in Twilight.” One of the key aspects of his writing is in dealing with the absurd. In an interview, he stated that “I am a realistic writer, and if my stories are often absurd, that’s simply because they are a projection of absurd realities.” As China has changed, he has started writing about the absurdities that come with it. In answering the criticisms that his writing is too violent, he responds that he is reflecting what he sees in reality, stating that “violence has long existed in my subconscious.”

== Writing style, themes and avant-garde ==

===Themes===
Heavily inspired and affected by the Cultural Revolution, the theme of modern Chinese history is prevalent in Yu Hua&#x27;s writing. Yu Hua&#x27;s work is very traditional, with psychologized storylines that investigate and illustrate the challenges of cultural disintegration and identity loss and his stories are often set in small towns during historical periods that he experienced including China under Chairman Mao&#x27;s rule, the Civil War and Cultural Revolution, and post Mao capitalist China. Childhood is also a theme which appears often in his stories, but does not consequently lighten the subject matter. Yu Hua is known for his brutal descriptions of violence, cruelty and death as well as themes surrounding &quot;the plight of China&#x27;s underclasses&quot; as seen in &quot;Chronicle of a Blood Merchant&quot;. 
When he began focusing on more chaotic themes in &quot;Brothers&quot;, Yu Hua admitted his belief that despite his past modeling after Kafka&#x27;s novels, &quot;the essential nature of writing was to free yourself. If the great masters can unfetter themselves, why can&#x27;t we?&quot; In this same work, he prides himself on his simultaneous expression of tragedy and comedy. Yu Hua also frequently engages in diverse attitudes of aesthetic modernity in his works, earning him the reputation of being a catalyst.

=== Style ===
Yu Hua has been influenced by magic realism and also incorporates pre-modern Chinese fiction elements into his work. He is known to use dark humour and strange modes of perception and description in his writing. The linguistic humour of Yu Hua&#x27;s novels is gray humour in extreme contrast, a kind of zero-degree emotional narration, and this humour often receives a surprisingly effective expression. He creates humour mainly through the context, the situation, the context of the times, and the national cultural tradition. He has been influenced by music, with a particular interest in classical, and the narrative structure of music; in fact, &quot;Chronicle of a Blood Merchant&quot; uses techniques borrowed from Yue opera&#x27;s style. He constantly draws from musical works when he composes his novels, using the characteristics of musical language to enrich his writing, thus making his fictional language full of musical rhythms, which is closely related to Yu Hua&#x27;s musical literacy and musical hobbies. He also gained inspiration for his literary creation from musical pieces. For example, repetition of words is a narrative style Yu Hua favours. It is an important method for him to portray his characters&#x27; character traits and psychological changes, achieving a focused and concise language expression through the clever use of repetitive language techniques.

Yu Hua&#x27;s work has been successful at constructing mysterious and rich literary universes in both fiction and non-fiction. As Yu Hua has said, &quot;Inevitably the novel involves China&#x27;s history, but I don&#x27;t intend to present history. My responsibility and interest as a writer lie in creating real people in my work, real Chinese people.&quot;

In the beginning of his career, he was not successful at gaining traction with readers due to the complexity of his work. He aimed to demonstrate the dark side of human psychology and society in a non-traditional way. He changed his style after he started to gain traction in the writing world and adjusted his work away from over-complexity due to readers finding his work difficult to understand. After his adjustments, he focused on injecting the right amount of modern ideologies into his work, which is primarily constructed on the narration of &quot;realistic societies&quot;.

Yu Hua&#x27;s writing style focuses on quality over quantity. Known by its complexity and unique linguistic styles, his style of writing and communication breaks the everyday rule of linguistics to form, in a sense, its own linguistic system. With its complex foundations, Yu Hua&#x27;s work has been successful at constructing mysterious and rich literary universes in both fiction and non-fiction.

=== Avant-garde ===
Yu Hua is a contemporary avant-garde writer formally introduced to the literary world with the publication of &quot;On the Road at Eighteen&quot;. This short story takes pains to highlight what the narrator sees, thinks and feels in moments of confusion and cruelty. It describes the feeling that the world has shredded its own integrity, and thus unveils a broken traditional view of reality based on surrealism.

Among avant-garde novelists, Yu Hua is exemplary in that he is able to combine the ludicrous together with poetic violence to challenge the philosophical idea of humanism. He is known for his delicacy and sharpness. As a pioneer writer, Yu Hua&#x27;s thinking in the face of reality and life is not to stay in some public imaginary happiness state, but to consciously pass through all kinds of ordinary happiness appearance, and to enter the more secret soul level to torture and question the original state of life. Thus, his novels rebel against the traditional writing mode and aesthetic style to a new height.

Yu Hua has deepened the rational reflection of human beings on the situation of their lives in the form of novels, which has caused a lot of shock and attention in the literary world and among the readers. Therefore, he has become the representative of the avant-garde novels in China. In the late 1980s, Yu Hua was regarded as one of the most promising avant-garde or post-trendy writers, and many critics considered him perhaps the best example of Chinese yuan novels or post-modern writing. In the late 1990s, he plowed through a series of short stories, novellas and novels in which his style seemed to shift slightly toward the traditional &quot;psychoanalytic&quot; narrative.

Yu Hua&#x27;s novels in this period make a deep and detailed analysis of human evil and violence, instinct and desire, tradition and history. It mainly reveals the evil of human nature and a series of cruel, violent and bloody events caused by the evil of human nature. &quot;1986&quot;, &quot;One Kind of Reality&quot;, &quot;The Inevitable&quot; and other early works are his almost brutal indifference tone of the real and detailed fictional violence, blood and death, so as to show the human nature of violence, desire and the desire of the impulse. 

==Works==
Note: titles have been translated into English from the original Mandarin Chinese.

===Short story collections===
Originally published in literary journals, these stories were subsequently anthologized in different collections in both Taiwan and Mainland China. The most complete collection of his stories to date is &quot;I Don&#x27;t Have My Own Name&quot; (2017), including 21 stories. It features his most notable short stories such as &quot;Leaving Home at Eighteen&quot;, &quot;Classical Love&quot;, &quot;World Like Mist&quot;, &quot;The Past and the Punishments&quot;, &quot;1986&quot;, &quot;Blood and Plum Blossoms&quot;, &quot;The Death of a Landlord&quot;, and &quot;Boy in the Twilight&quot; along with 13 other works. Other anthologies with these works include &quot;The April 3rd Incident&quot; (2018), translated by Allan H. Barr; &quot;The Past and the Punishments&quot; (1996), translated by Andrew F. Jones; &quot;Boy in the Twilight&quot; (2014), translated by Allan H. Barr; On the Road at Eighteen (1991); Summer Typhoon (1993); Shudder (1995); and the three volumes of &quot;Yu Hua&#x27;s Collected Works&quot; (1994), among others.

===Novels===

*&quot;Cries in the Drizzle&quot; (1992): In Yu Hua&#x27;s first published novel, which is a first-person reminiscence of the protagonist Sun Guanglin in China under the reign of Mao. As a black sheep in society and his own family, he observes the consequences of Communist rule from a unique perspective of a resentful teenager. Readers are given a chance to revisit the meanings of family, friendship, marriage, fate, sex and birth through a child&#x27;s perspective. The formatting and style of Yu Hua&#x27;s first published level can be described as a &quot;serpentine, episodic collection of anecdotes forming a kind of Maoist-era &quot;kinderscenen&quot;.&quot;
*&quot;To Live&quot; (1993): An exaggerated realist fiction depicts the protagonist Xu Fugui has been constantly suffering in his life. Yu Hua&#x27;s breakthrough novel follows the transformation of a landlord&#x27;s spoiled son witnessing the brutality and hardships of the Civil War and Cultural Revolution. The body of the book is formatted by the main character, Fugui, recounting his story to an unnamed narrator in the 1980s, while the story itself takes place between the Second-Sino Japanese War until the death of his last remaining relative. In order of appearance, his relatives are his parents, his wife Jiazhen, daughter Fengxia, son Youqing, son-in-law Erxi, and his only grandchild Kugen who is the last to die. Over the events of the book that follows the historical timeline of China under rule of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution, which lead to the many deaths in Fu Gui&#x27;s family as they experience poverty, illness, and the malpractice of medicine. The novel was originally banned in China due to its exaggerated realism writing style but was later named one of that nation&#x27;s most influential books.
*&quot;Chronicle of a Blood Merchant&quot; (1995) follows a struggling cart-pusher and portrays the hardships of life under the leadership of Mao&#x27;s China. Xu Sanguan, the cart-pusher, partakes in the illicit act of selling his blood to support his dysfunctional family during a period of famine from the Cultural Revolution. As the story develops, Xu Sanguan must put aside his bitterness towards his wife Xu Yulan and the illegitimate son she gave birth to, Yile, under the guise that he was Xu Sanguan&#x27;s child. The title &quot;Chronicle of a Blood Merchant&quot; refers to China&#x27;s Plasma Economy that took place in the years that Yu Hua was writing his sophomore novel.
*&quot;Brothers&quot; (2005): Described as &quot;an epic and wildly unhinged black comedy of modern Chinese society running amok&quot;, &quot;Brothers&quot; consists of two volumes following the childhood of two step-brothers during the Cultural Revolution and life in post-Mao, capitalist China. Baldy Li is the protagonist, a town scoundrel that evolves into the nation&#x27;s top entrepreneur. His rags to riches story opposes that of his step-brother Song Gang, who although is known for being so similar to his chivalrous and smart father, gets hit by the brunt of the Cultural Revolution and suffers as a wandering man who partakes in unlicensed cosmetic surgery practices in South China. These cosmetic surgeries eventually influence Baldy Li&#x27;s newly established beauty pageant, that only virgins can participate in. Over the many decades of the novel, Baldy Li begins an affair with Song Gang&#x27;s wife, Lin Hong, who he has admired for years. Later, the brothers are united to resolve their differences. The book was inspired by Yu Hua&#x27;s trip to the United States in 2003, during which he observed China prepare for hosting the Miss World competition from afar.
*&quot;The Seventh Day&quot; (2015): Yu Hua&#x27;s most recent novel takes the deceased as the protagonist and depicts what the deceased saw and heard within seven days after death. Yu Hua portrays an absurd and desperate real world and an afterlife opposite to it. The protagonist Yang Fei died at the age of forty-one without adequate money for a burial plot, is left to aimlessly roam the afterworld as a ghost. Over the course of seven days, he encounters the souls of friends, family and acquaintances who died before him. Through the narrative and experience of the deceased, the novel exposes the cruel and corrupt realities, such as men disguised in females in prostitution, violent demolition, post-disaster concealment of the death toll, the hospital disposes of dead babies as medical wastes, etc. While other facets of human rights that are encroached during Yang Fei&#x27;s exploration of limbo are police brutality, the violence of the sex industry, suicide, and the forced evictions of those suffering from poverty by the government. Yu Hua &quot;got the idea that death is not the end of life but just a turning point&quot; from living close to a mortuary as a child. &quot;The Seventh Day&quot; serves as a criticism to the class disparity in China, a disparity that is so severe it continues to exist even in the afterlife, as a result of government corruption and a &quot;country&#x27;s headlong affair with consumerism&quot;. Other facets of human rights that are encroached during Yang Fei&#x27;s exploration of limbo are police brutality, the violence of the sex industry, suicide, and the forced evictions of those suffering from poverty by the government.

===Essays===
*&quot;China in Ten Words&quot; (2011): In a collection of ten essays, titled after a word he has deemed representative of the culture and politics of modern China, Yu Hua describes a &quot;morally compromised nation,&quot; contrasting the Cultural Revolution events with post-Mao China&#x27;s rapid developments and even discussing the origins of current events and the 1989 pro-democracy protest; Yu Hua did not publish the Chinese version of the essays novel in China. The ten words are &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Leader&quot;, &quot;Reading&quot;, &quot;Writing&quot;, &quot;Lu Xun&quot;, &quot;Revolution&quot;, &quot;Disparity&quot;, &quot;Grassroots&quot;, &quot;Copycat&quot;, and &quot;Bamboozle&quot;. Using these words, Yu Hua conducts a recollection of historical and cultural events that have made China what it is today, intermixed with autobiographical accounts of growing up during the Cultural Revolution. Each essay explains why the titular term is particular in order to further understand a controversial China. Yu Hua states that this work is &quot;to bring together observation, analysis, and personal anecdote&quot; for a critique of contemporary China.

== Political views ==

=== Cultural Revolution ===
Most of Yu Hua&#x27;s novels are centred around the Cultural Revolution, either as the setting, a contextual reference, or as a literary device. Yu Hua was born in 1960, and his childhood memories are the Cultural Revolution. Yu Hua said, &quot;My novel creation is closely related to childhood and juveniles.&quot; Yu Hua&#x27;s description of the Cultural Revolution is indifferent, no matter whether it is describing violence or death. For example, the novel &quot;To Live&quot; uses an objective narrative style to describe the suffering of the Cultural Revolution. In &quot;Brothers&quot;, Yu Hua directly talks about what happened to a family during the Cultural Revolution. In these books, we can understand the harm of the Cultural Revolution to human nature and clearly understand the mistakes made during the Cultural Revolution.

==Reception==
Yu Hua is regarded as one of the greatest living Chinese writers. Jeffrey Wasserstrom of the &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot; wrote, &quot;When people ask me to suggest a novel dealing with the rise and rule of China&#x27;s Communist Party, I point them toward &quot;To Live&quot;, which is available in a lively translation by Michael Berry and presents pivotal stages of revolutionary history from the perspective of everyman characters, or &quot;Chronicle of a Blood Merchant&quot;, which has similar virtues and a slightly larger quotient of humor&quot;.

==Awards==
Yu Hua received the Grinzane Cavour Prize as his first award in 1998 for his novel &quot;To Live.&quot; Four years later, Yu Hua became the first Chinese writer to receive the James Joyce Award (2002). Originally published in 1993, &quot;To Live&quot; was then published in English in 2003 and earned him the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres of France in 2004. That same year, Yu Hua was awarded the Barnes &amp; Noble Discovery Great New Writers Award (2004) and in 2005, took home the Special Book Award of China. Since then, he has also won the Prix Courrier International (2008) for his novel &quot;Brothers&quot; which was also shortlisted for the Man Asian Literary Prize and won the Best Foreign Language Works Award of the 2022 Yasnaya Polyana Literary Award.

==TV and film adaptations==
Four of Yu Hua&#x27;s works have screen adaptations. &quot;To Live&quot; (1994) was directed by the highly esteemed Zhang Yimou, with Yu Hua himself participating in screenwriting. Though the screenplay was greatly altered it was still banned upon initial release. However, &quot;To Live&quot; swept awards at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. There are some notable changes within the narrative. One stark difference is Fugui&#x27;s career being in shadow puppetry rather than farming. Another great contrast is the death of Youqing being from a car accident involving himself and the Magistrate Chunsheng. The same novel was adapted by Zhu Zheng as a television drama in 2003, named after the protagonist &quot;Fu Gui&quot;. The movie and novel emphasize two ways of &quot;living&quot; through exposing harsh realities underneath the facade of life and pondering the significance of existing. The television adaptation followed the tragedies in the original storyline more closely, avoiding the casting of big names in order to effectively portray the simplicity of civilian life in revolution era China. Each have their own virtues, but the public seems to prefer the movie. In 2015, &quot;Chronicles of a Blood Merchant&quot; was adapted into a Korean language film, both directed by and starring actor Ha Jung-woo. A film adaptation of Yun Hua&#x27;s &quot;Mistakes by the River&quot; directed by Wei Shujun, &quot;Only the River Flows&quot;, was released in 2023.

<text>Swami Vijnanananda (born Hariprasanna Chattopadhyay; 30 October 1868 – 25 April 1938) was an Indian monk of Ramakrishna order, born in an upper-class family near Dakshineswar, and was a direct disciple of Ramakrishna. He was an engineer and worked as the District Engineer in the erstwhile State of United Provinces, India. He was a great scholar of Sanskrit with expertise in religio-philosophical works, astronomy, civil engineering etc. He spent considerable time in Allahabad (Prayag) centre of Ramakrishna Math. He became the President of Ramakrishna Mission in 1937. It was under his presidency and direct supervision that the Ramakrishna Temple at Belur Math was constructed and consecrated.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hariprasanna Chattopadhyaya was born on 30 October 1868, in a respectable family of Belgharia. He had, in all probability, first seen Ramakrishna on 15 September 1879 at Keshab Chandra Sen&#x27;s spiritual retreat at Belgharia. When studying in the first or second class of a High School, Hariprasanna saw Ramakrishna at Dewan Govinda Mukherji&#x27;s house. It was on 18 February 1883 that Hariprasanna, then a student of the St. Xavier&#x27;s College, went to Dakshineswar with his fellow students Sarat, later Saradananda (Sarat Maharaj), and Barada Pal. Ramakrishna showed great love and kindness towards Hariprasanna, which bound the latter indissolubly to the former. Hariprasanna took Ramakrishna to be his Master. He however saw the Master only a few more times in his life, as he was compelled to live at Bankipore in Bihar.
Hariprasanna&#x27;s guardians were not in favour of his meeting Ramakrishna. He stayed back in Dakshineswar one night upon request from the Master, and later he divulged that on that night Sri Ramakrishna granted him special spiritual favours. Vijnanananda later recalled: &#x27;As I approached the Master he asked me to stick out my tongue. When I did so, he drew a figure on it with his finger. My whole body began to tremble, and I felt an unspeakable bliss within.&#x27;
He was rebuked by his mother and elder sister for the transgression and could not go to see Ramakrishna for a long time, who sent Sarat to bring him along. Ramakrishna made him enter into a deep meditation and gave him intimate knowledge on various facets of spiritual lives.

===Student life===
As a student, Hariprasanna was very spirited and would be upset at the sight of any moral turpitude or social injustice. 
After passing the First Arts examination from Calcutta, Hariprasanna went to Bankipore in Bihar. He graduated from Patna college and went to study Civil Engineering in Pune. During this time Sri Ramakrishna died and Hariprasanna had a vision of Ramakrishna on the night he died. He completed his diploma in civil engineering (Licentiate in Civil Engineering or L.C.E) from Poona College of Science. He did not appear for his final examination deliberately in order to help a poor but meritorious student to secure a job, as in those days only the first or second ranked students could get a Government job and Hariprasanna&#x27;s classmates were of the opinion that he was to stand first or second. At that time, Hariprasanna was financially dependent on his elder sister&#x27;s husband. The next year, he passed the examination successfully and landed with a Government job.

===Pre-monastic life===
He started his Government service as the district engineer of Ghazipur, Uttar Province. Later he worked in Etawah, Meerut, Bulandshahr and other places. When he was staying in Etawah, Swami Subodhananda stayed with him and from him Hariprasanna got the information about the financial distress of Alambazar Math, and he contributed 60 rupees every month thereafter. Hariprasanna took up the job to save money for his mother&#x27;s future and after enough money was secured for his mother&#x27;s maintenance, he left the job to join the Alambazar monastery.

===Monastic life===

In the year 1896, shortly before Swami Vivekananda returned from the West, Hariprasanna joined the Alambazar Math and there he took his monastic vows and came to be known as Swami Vijnanananda. 
&quot;One of my boys in training has been an executive engineer, in charge of a district. That means a very big position here [in India]. He gave it up like straw!&quot; 
wrote Swami Vivekananda in a letter to Sister Nivedita on 20 June 1897, in the context of Hariprasanna&#x27;s renunciation. Vijnanananda accompanied Vivekananda on his trip to Rajputana and elsewhere. In 1899, he started working in constructing the buildings in Belur Math.
As a wandering monk he visited many places and came to Allahabad in 1900. Here a group of young students had started an organization called Brahmavadin club, for which they solicited his help. Vijanananda made Allahabad his permanent place, and he established a centre of Ramakrishna Mission. He found Ramakrishna Math in Muthiganj in 1908. He lived a life of great austerity, often cooking his own food and spending time in meditation.
In 1934, he was appointed as the Vice President of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission and in 1937, its president. During his last few years he travelled extensively and visited many centres of Ramakrishna Math, including those of Rangoon and Colombo.
The main Ramakrishna temple in Belur was started in 1935 and in view of the deteriorating health condition of Vijanananda, it was planned to have the installation ceremony just after the completion of the main shrine. On 14 January 1938, Vijanananda performed the dedication of the temple and the consecration of the marble image of Sri Ramakrishna. He paid only one more visit to Belur, on the occasion of Sri Ramakrishna&#x27;s birthday.
He returned to Allahabad, where he died on 25 April 1938.

There is a dormitory named, in his honour, Vijnanananda Dham in Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, Deoghar and also in Ramkrishna Mission Vidyapith, Purulia

===Major works===

Swami Vijanananda constructed the major buildings of Belur Math, as well as the embankment on the Ganges in front of the main temple. Vivekananda entrusted him with the responsibility of planning a big memorial temple dedicated to Ramakrishna, giving him specific instructions. The Swami, in consultation with a noted European architect of Calcutta, prepared a design of the proposed temple, which was approved by Vivekananda. The temple was planned to have unifying features from all major religions - Church, Mosque and Temple. The plan got shelved after Vivekananda&#x27;s death in 1902 owing to the paucity of funds. Thirty years after Vivekananda&#x27;s death, the temple plan was revived when an unexpected financial help was received from some devoted American students. The foundation stone of the temple was laid by Vijanananda, then Vice President of Ramakrishna Math and Mission, in July 1935. The main shrine was opened in his presence in 1938. Hariprasanna Maharaj also established the Ramakrishna Math and Mission in Allahabad and trained many novice monks there. He also supervised the construction of some of the buildings of Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service in Benaras as well as the Swami Vivekananda temple in Belur Math. He also provided valuable advice with regard to the construction of the other buildings of Ramakrishna Math.

===Spiritual visions===
While studying in Patna, Hariprasanna had a vision of Ramakrishna, which took place on the day of the latter&#x27;s passing away in Cossipore in Calcutta in 1886. While staying in Allahabad, he also had a vision of Swami Vivekananda on the day the latter died in 1902. He had several other spiritual visions in various places like Benaras, Kalighat, Sarnath and Triveni in Allahabad.

Vijanananda wrote several books in his lifetime. 
* &quot;Paramahamsa-charit&quot; (Hindi: Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsadev-ka Samkshipta Jivancharit aur Upadesh): This is Vijnanananda&#x27;s first book. It is also the first biography of Sri Ramakrishna written by one of his monastic disciples. It was written and published while he was staying at the Brahmavadin Club at Allahabad. The book was published in 1904.

===Character and legacy===
While Hariprasanna was in Government service, he had an uncommon integrity and sense of duty. He was also a great scholar and a voracious reader, and had varied intellectual interests. As a monk he normally did not deliver lectures but held informal discussions with devotees and disciples. He also had a great humour sense. Vijnanananda loved seclusion, was frugal in his speech, and avoided giving spiritual instructions. Only after becoming vice president, he initiated a large number of people.
In many things, he was just like an innocent child. His frankness was beyond comparison. The same trait made him a very plain-speaking person, but his straight words would not give offence to anyone.

====Teachings====
* One should not ask for anything from God, but remain satisfied with whatever He is pleased to give. If you ask for anything He will give a gift which is like a double-edged sword. Real welfare lies in using things properly; wrong use of things brings misfortune.
* Whatever situation one may be in, one can, to some degree, serve the motherland, serve the common people, and above all, serve God. Always have the good of the universe at heart and let this become a part of your daily prayer.
* One reason for the decadence of our country is that in the name of religion, people put forward harmful theories, as a result of which, people lose their faith in religion itself. Simplicity, faithfulness and purity of heart are called for.
* One who can detach his mind from material things will see the light of God and his presence in everything. Worldly attachment draws people away from God and scorch them in the wild fire of the world.

<text>William Carl Garner (June 1, 1915 – July 6, 2014) was an American engineer. He served as resident engineer of Greers Ferry Lake since its construction in 1959, and in that capacity, he organized a citizen cleanup of the area which expanded to the Carl Garner Federal Lands Cleanup Day. The attention the program has received has also made people more aware of the problem of litter and preservation of the environment during the entire year.

==Biography==

Garner was born in Moorefield, Arkansas, the son of Burton John Garner and Minnie Pearl Morgan. He was the first born out of six raised on a farm near Sulphur Rock, Arkansas. Carl attended Sulphur Rock High School and was salutatorian of his class when he graduated. Because of his basketball record he received a basketball scholarship from Arkansas College (now Lyon College), which he attended and graduated from in 1938 with a degree in economics. His first wife was Ruth Elizabeth Wade, daughter of Ernest Wade and Lizzie Estella Leggett. They were married September 18, 1940, and had a son. His second wife, Ima Jean &quot;Jean&quot; Reedy, also worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. They were married in 1972.

Garner&#x27;s 43-year career with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Little Rock Division, began in 1938 at Pocahontas, Arkansas. He worked in the survey, mapping, estimating, construction and operational branches in Missouri and Arkansas. Chief construction projects he worked on were Bull Shoals, Table Rock and Greers Ferry. In 1962 he became resident engineer in charge of operations and maintenance of the Greers Ferry Project, a position he held until his retirement in 1998.

Garner received numerous awards in recognition of his work. Some of them are: 1963-Social Service Award for preparation of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s dedication of the Greers Ferry Project and the guided tour following the dedication; 1967-President&#x27;s Citation, National Water Safety Congress for outstanding efforts in water safety; 1977-Corps of Engineers Meritorious Service Award and Bronze Medal; special appreciation awards from governors David Pryor and Bill Clinton, and Congressman Bill Alexander; 1979-Award of Excellence from Chief of Engineers as No. 1 Resident Engineer out of 440 Corps of Engineers lakes.

Garner is best known for his development of the Greers Ferry Lake recreational facilities. In 1969 he led the Greers Ferry Lake and Little Red River Tourism Association&#x27;s first-annual lake shore cleanup program, which has been nationally acclaimed, receiving the Keep America Beautiful Award twice and placing five times. In 1983 Carl Garner was named Arkansas Tourism Person of the Year. In 1984 the Keep America Beautiful first National Public Lands Cleanup Day launched, using the Greers Ferry Lake and Little Red River Tourism Association&#x27;s annual cleanup as its model. In 1983 the William Carl Garner Visitor Center opened near the dam, telling the story of the Little Red River and the dam development.

He was a fellow in the American Society of Civil Engineers, member of the U.S. Committee on Large Dams and National Trails Council, Vice-President and member of the National Water Safety Congress. Other than professional organizations he was a member of the Board of Associates of Arkansas College; Advisory Board of Foothills Vocational Tech School; Official Board of First United Methodist Church of Heber Springs; and the building committee and service on the Board of Governors for Cleburne County Hospital.

During Carl Garner&#x27;s more than 57 years of service to the Corps of Engineers in Arkansas, he headed preparations for the dedication of Greers Ferry Dam by President John F. Kennedy and introduced many families to the outdoors.

The William Carl Garner Visitor Center was named after him and is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Visitor Center for Greers Ferry Lake. The center is located on Highway 25 North just west of Greers Ferry Dam near Heber Springs, Arkansas.

He died July 6, 2014, in White County Medical Center in Searcy, White County, Arkansas. He was buried July 2014 in Cleburne County Memorial Gardens in Heber Springs, Cleburne County, Arkansas.

<doc id="1311951" wikidata="Q5227277" url="?curid=1311951" title="Data dredging">
<text>Data dredging (also known as data snooping or &quot;p&quot;-hacking) is the misuse of data analysis to find patterns in data that can be presented as statistically significant, thus dramatically increasing and understating the risk of false positives. This is done by performing many statistical tests on the data and only reporting those that come back with significant results.

The process of data dredging involves testing multiple hypotheses using a single data set by exhaustively searching—perhaps for combinations of variables that might show a correlation, and perhaps for groups of cases or observations that show differences in their mean or in their breakdown by some other variable.

Conventional tests of statistical significance are based on the probability that a particular result would arise if chance alone were at work, and necessarily accept some risk of mistaken conclusions of a certain type (mistaken rejections of the null hypothesis). This level of risk is called the &quot;significance&quot;. When large numbers of tests are performed, some produce false results of this type; hence 5% of randomly chosen hypotheses might be (erroneously) reported to be statistically significant at the 5% significance level, 1% might be (erroneously) reported to be statistically significant at the 1% significance level, and so on, by chance alone. When enough hypotheses are tested, it is virtually certain that some will be reported to be statistically significant (even though this is misleading), since almost every data set with any degree of randomness is likely to contain (for example) some spurious correlations. If they are not cautious, researchers using data mining techniques can be easily misled by these results. The term &quot;p-hacking&quot; (in reference to &quot;p&quot;-values) was coined in a 2014 paper by the three researchers behind the blog Data Colada, which has been focusing on uncovering such problems in social sciences research.

Data dredging is an example of disregarding the multiple comparisons problem. One form is when subgroups are compared without alerting the reader to the total number of subgroup comparisons examined.

==Types==

=== Drawing conclusions from data ===
The conventional statistical hypothesis testing procedure using frequentist probability is to formulate a research hypothesis, such as &quot;people in higher social classes live longer&quot;, then collect relevant data. Lastly, a statistical significance test is carried out to see how likely the results are by chance alone (also called testing against the null hypothesis).

A key point in proper statistical analysis is to test a hypothesis with evidence (data) that was not used in constructing the hypothesis. This is critical because every data set contains some patterns due entirely to chance. If the hypothesis is not tested on a different data set from the same statistical population, it is impossible to assess the likelihood that chance alone would produce such patterns.

For example, flipping a coin five times with a result of 2 heads and 3 tails might lead one to hypothesize that the coin favors tails by 3/5 to 2/5. If this hypothesis is then tested on the existing data set, it is confirmed, but the confirmation is meaningless. The proper procedure would have been to form in advance a hypothesis of what the tails probability is, and then throw the coin various times to see if the hypothesis is rejected or not. If three tails and two heads are observed, another hypothesis, that the tails probability is 3/5, could be formed, but it could only be tested by a new set of coin tosses. The statistical significance under the incorrect procedure is completely spurious—significance tests do not protect against data dredging.

=== Optional stopping ===

Optional stopping is a practice where one collects data until some stopping criteria is reached. While it is a valid procedure, it is easily misused. The problem is that p-value of an optionally stopped statistical test is larger than what it seems. Intuitively, this is because the p-value is supposed to be the sum of all events at least as rare as what is observed. With optional stopping, there are even rarer events that are difficult to account for, i.e. not triggering the optional stopping rule, and collect even more data, before stopping. Neglecting these events leads to a p-value that&#x27;s too low. In fact, if the null hypothesis is true, then &quot;any&quot; significance level can be reached if one is allowed to keep collecting data and stop when the desired p-value (calculated as if one has always been planning to collect exactly this much data) is obtained. For a concrete example of testing for a fair coin, see .

Or, more succinctly, the proper calculation of p-value requires accounting for counterfactuals, that is, what the experimenter &quot;could&quot; have done in reaction to data that &quot;might&quot; have been. Accounting for what might have been is hard, even for honest researchers. One benefit of preregistration is to account for all counterfactuals, allowing the p-value to be calculated correctly.

The problem of early stopping is not just limited to researcher misconduct. There is often pressure to stop early if the cost of collecting data is high. Some animal ethics boards even mandate early stopping if the study obtains a significant result midway.

=== Post-hoc data replacement ===
If data is removed &quot;after&quot; some data analysis is already done on it, such as on the pretext of &quot;removing outliers&quot;, then it would increase the false positive rate. Replacing &quot;outliers&quot; by replacement data increases the false positive rate further.

=== Post-hoc grouping ===
If a dataset contains multiple features, then one or more of the features can be used as grouping, and potentially create a statistically significant result. For example, if a dataset of patients records their age and sex, then a researcher can consider grouping them by age and check if the illness recovery rate is correlated with age. If it does not work, then the researcher might check if it correlates with sex. If not, then perhaps it correlates with age after controlling for sex, etc. The number of possible groupings grows exponentially with the number of features.

=== Hypothesis suggested by non-representative data ===
Suppose that a study of a random sample of people includes exactly two people with a birthday of August 7: Mary and John. Someone engaged in data dredging might try to find additional similarities between Mary and John. By going through hundreds or thousands of potential similarities between the two, each having a low probability of being true, an unusual similarity can almost certainly be found. Perhaps John and Mary are the only two people in the study who switched minors three times in college. A hypothesis, biased by data dredging, could then be &quot;people born on August 7 have a much higher chance of switching minors more than twice in college.&quot;

The data itself taken out of context might be seen as strongly supporting that correlation, since no one with a different birthday had switched minors three times in college. However, if (as is likely) this is a spurious hypothesis, this result will most likely not be reproducible; any attempt to check if others with an August 7 birthday have a similar rate of changing minors will most likely get contradictory results almost immediately.

=== Systematic bias ===

Bias is a systematic error in the analysis. For example, doctors directed HIV patients at high cardiovascular risk to a particular HIV treatment, abacavir, and lower-risk patients to other drugs, preventing a simple assessment of abacavir compared to other treatments. An analysis that did not correct for this bias unfairly penalized abacavir, since its patients were more high-risk so more of them had heart attacks. This problem can be very severe, for example, in the observational study.

Missing factors, unmeasured confounders, and loss to follow-up can also lead to bias. By selecting papers with significant &quot;p&quot;-values, negative studies are selected against, which is publication bias. This is also known as &quot;file drawer bias&quot;, because less significant &quot;p&quot;-value results are left in the file drawer and never published.

=== Multiple modelling ===
Another aspect of the conditioning of statistical tests by knowledge of the data can be seen while using the A crucial step in the process is to decide which covariates to include in a relationship explaining one or more other variables. There are both statistical (see stepwise regression) and substantive considerations that lead the authors to favor some of their models over others, and there is a liberal use of statistical tests. However, to discard one or more variables from an explanatory relation on the basis of the data means one cannot validly apply standard statistical procedures to the retained variables in the relation as though nothing had happened. In the nature of the case, the retained variables have had to pass some kind of preliminary test (possibly an imprecise intuitive one) that the discarded variables failed. In 1966, Selvin and Stuart compared variables retained in the model to the fish that don&#x27;t fall through the net—in the sense that their effects are bound to be bigger than those that do fall through the net. Not only does this alter the performance of all subsequent tests on the retained explanatory model, but it may also introduce bias and alter mean square error in estimation.

==Examples ==

=== In meteorology and epidemiology ===
In meteorology, hypotheses are often formulated using weather data up to the present and tested against future weather data, which ensures that, even subconsciously, future data could not influence the formulation of the hypothesis. Of course, such a discipline necessitates waiting for new data to come in, to show the formulated theory&#x27;s predictive power versus the null hypothesis. This process ensures that no one can accuse the researcher of hand-tailoring the predictive model to the data on hand, since the upcoming weather is not yet available.

As another example, suppose that observers note that a particular town appears to have a cancer cluster, but lack a firm hypothesis of why this is so. However, they have access to a large amount of demographic data about the town and surrounding area, containing measurements for the area of hundreds or thousands of different variables, mostly uncorrelated. Even if all these variables are independent of the cancer incidence rate, it is highly likely that at least one variable correlates significantly with the cancer rate across the area. While this may suggest a hypothesis, further testing using the same variables but with data from a different location is needed to confirm. Note that a &quot;p&quot;-value of 0.01 suggests that 1% of the time a result at least that extreme would be obtained by chance; if hundreds or thousands of hypotheses (with mutually relatively uncorrelated independent variables) are tested, then one is likely to obtain a &quot;p&quot;-value less than 0.01 for many null hypotheses.

== Appearance in media ==
One example is the chocolate weight loss hoax study conducted by journalist John Bohannon, who explained publicly in a &quot;Gizmodo&quot; article that the study was deliberately conducted fraudulently as a social experiment. This study was widespread in many media outlets around 2015, with many people believing the claim that eating a chocolate bar every day would cause them to lose weight, against their better judgement. This study was published in the Institute of Diet and Health. According to Bohannon, to reduce the &quot;p&quot;-value to below 0.05, taking 18 different variables into consideration when testing was crucial.

==Remedies==
While looking for patterns in data is legitimate, applying a statistical test of significance or hypothesis test to the same data until a pattern emerges is prone to abuse. One way to construct hypotheses while avoiding data dredging is to conduct randomized out-of-sample tests. The researcher collects a data set, then randomly partitions it into two subsets, A and B. Only one subset—say, subset A—is examined for creating hypotheses. Once a hypothesis is formulated, it must be tested on subset B, which was not used to construct the hypothesis. Only where B also supports such a hypothesis is it reasonable to believe the hypothesis might be valid. (This is a simple type of cross-validation and is often termed training-test or split-half validation.)

Another remedy for data dredging is to record the number of all significance tests conducted during the study and simply divide one&#x27;s criterion for significance (alpha) by this number; this is the Bonferroni correction. However, this is a very conservative metric. A family-wise alpha of 0.05, divided in this way by 1,000 to account for 1,000 significance tests, yields a very stringent per-hypothesis alpha of 0.00005. Methods particularly useful in analysis of variance, and in constructing simultaneous confidence bands for regressions involving basis functions are Scheffé&#x27;s method and, if the researcher has in mind only pairwise comparisons, the Tukey method. To avoid the extreme conservativeness of the Bonferroni correction, more sophisticated selective inference methods are available. The most common selective inference method is the use of Benjamini and Hochberg&#x27;s false discovery rate controlling procedure: it is a less conservative approach that has become a popular method for control of multiple hypothesis tests. 

When neither approach is practical, one can make a clear distinction between data analyses that are confirmatory and analyses that are exploratory. Statistical inference is appropriate only for the former.

Ultimately, the statistical significance of a test and the statistical confidence of a finding are joint properties of data and the method used to examine the data. Thus, if someone says that a certain event has probability of 20% ± 2% 19 times out of 20, this means that if the probability of the event is estimated &quot;by the same method&quot; used to obtain the 20% estimate, the result is between 18% and 22% with probability 0.95. No claim of statistical significance can be made by only looking, without due regard to the method used to assess the data.

Academic journals increasingly shift to the registered report format, which aims to counteract very serious issues such as data dredging and , which have made theory-testing research very unreliable. For example, &quot;Nature Human Behaviour&quot; has adopted the registered report format, as it &quot;shift[s] the emphasis from the results of research to the questions that guide the research and the methods used to answer them&quot;. The &quot;European Journal of Personality&quot; defines this format as follows: &quot;In a registered report, authors create a study proposal that includes theoretical and empirical background, research questions/hypotheses, and pilot data (if available). Upon submission, this proposal will then be reviewed prior to data collection, and if accepted, the paper resulting from this peer-reviewed procedure will be published, regardless of the study outcomes.&quot;

Methods and results can also be made publicly available, as in the open science approach, making it yet more difficult for data dredging to take place.

<doc id="1311957" wikidata="Q3675476" url="?curid=1311957" title="Chris Doleman">
<text>Christopher John Doleman (October 16, 1961 – January 28, 2020) was an American professional football defensive end who played in the National Football League (NFL). He spent the majority of his career with the Minnesota Vikings, and also played for the Atlanta Falcons and the San Francisco 49ers. Doleman was an eight-time Pro Bowl selection and a twice first-team All-Pro, recording 150.5 career sacks. He is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2012.

==Early life==
Doleman attended William Penn Senior High School in York, Pennsylvania, and graduated in 1980. He spent a postgraduate year at Valley Forge Military Academy in 1981.

==College career==
Doleman played football collegiately at the University of Pittsburgh. He was a star linebacker and defensive end for the Pitt Panthers from 1981 to 1984. He ended his career at Pitt with 25 sacks which was good for third all-time at the time of his departure. That total still ranks sixth in the Pitt annals.

==Professional career==
Doleman was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the first round (4th overall) of the 1985 NFL draft. He began his NFL career as an outside linebacker (OLB) in the Vikings&#x27; 3–4 defense, but for the 1987 season (Doleman&#x27;s third season) the team decided to switch to a 4–3 defense, which resulted in him being moved from his spot at OLB up to the defensive line to play as a defensive end. The move paid off for Doleman, who recorded 21 sacks in the 1989 season, the highest total recorded that season and the fourth-highest total ever. The 21 sacks in a single season was a Vikings record until Jared Allen recorded 22 sacks in 2011. Doleman later played for the Atlanta Falcons and the San Francisco 49ers before returning to the Vikings in 1999 for his final season.

He was a first-team All-Pro in 1987, 1989 and 1992. He garnered second-team All-Pro selections in 1990 and 1993.

In 2012, Doleman was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

==NFL career statistics==


==Personal life and death==
On January 25, 2018, Doleman had brain surgery for a condition which was later diagnosed as glioblastoma. On January 28, 2020, Doleman died from the disease at the age of 58. He was honored prior to kickoff at Super Bowl LIV five days later.

<doc id="1311960" wikidata="Q2337139" url="?curid=1311960" title="Ripley, Surrey">
<text>Ripley is a village and civil parish in Surrey, England. It is centred southeast of Woking, northeast of Guildford and southwest of London. Neighbouring villages Send and Send Marsh to the South-West and Ockham to the East have fewer shopping facilities.

==Geography==
Lying on the main road from London to Portsmouth (from the 1930s referred to as the A3), Ripley was the post town for the whole area (including Woking) from 1813 to 1865. With the coming of the railway to what was then Woking Common in 1838, Ripley&#x27;s importance diminished, and Woking became its post town in 1865. As motor traffic increased during the 1960s and the 1970s, the Portsmouth Road at Ripley became a notorious bottleneck, relieved by the building of the Ripley bypass in 1976. The A3 was renamed the B2215, and what has always been a major trunk road was expanded into six lanes north of Guildford, bypassing Send and Ripley.

==History==
The village has existed since Norman times – the chancel of the church of St. Mary Magdalen shows construction of circa 1160 there and supporting feet of fines and ecclesiastical records mention the village at the time. Ripley&#x27;s sister village of Send to the south-west was the governing parish over the village for over 700 years until 1878 when they became two separate ecclesiastical parishes; they became separate civil parishes in 1933.

==Amenities==

The village includes a coaching inn, the Talbot Inn, which dates back to 1453, as well as The Clockhouse (formerly Drake&#x27;s) restaurant, which has been awarded a Michelin star and 3 AA rosettes. The Anchor, on Ripley High Street, has 2 AA rosettes and is listed as a Michelin Guide Restaurant. The village high street includes two small supermarkets, cobblers and a bakery. The other pubs in the village are the Jovial Sailor on the western outskirts, The Ship Inn, The Seven Stars and The Half Moon.

Ripley has one private school, Ripley Court Preparatory School. The Ripley Church of England primary school is now shut.

==Ripley Farmers&#x27; Market==
Ripley has a monthly Farmers&#x27; Market on the second Saturday of each month, from 9am until 1pm. The market consists of, on average, 45 stalls.

==Notable buildings==
The village church of St Mary Magdalen has a fine Norman chancel and is a Grade II* listed building.

Among the more than 20 listed buildings and cottages in the village are Pinnocks Café the Ship Inn and Ye Old Sweet Shoppe, J Hartley Antiques, Sage Antiques (Green Cottage), the Clock House and the Old Pharmacy. This last building is a historical place of interest with a Blue Plaque located outside commemorating the production of penicillin for the first time in the UK and possibly the world, for civilian use, by Kenneth White in 1944. Cedar House and Tudor House (one joint property) is another listed building,

==In popular culture==
Ripley is mentioned in H. G. Wells&#x27; novels &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;The Wheels of Chance&quot;. The Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes short story &quot;The Naval Treaty&quot; includes a setting in Ripley.

==Famous residents==
Ripley is the birthplace of the rock/blues guitarist Eric Clapton.

Paul Weller is a long-term resident of Ripley and runs local recording studios Black Barn Studios.

==Sport==

===Cricket===
Cricket has been a popular sport in the village for 200 years and is played on the Green.

===Cycling===

====Cycling heritage====
In the 1870s, cycling also became a popular activity in the South of England and Ripley was a convenient distance from London so that many cyclists would stop there for a break at the Anchor Inn. Sisters Annie and Harriet Dibble encouraged the cyclists so much that, in some years in the following decade, their visitors&#x27; book was signed with over 7,000 names.

====Cycling routes today====
The 2012 Summer Olympics road races started at The Mall in central London, passed Richmond and extended into Surrey to the south via Hampton Court Palace, Weybridge, Byfleet, West Byfleet, Ripley, West Horsley and Dorking then returned to The Mall via Leatherhead, Oxshott, Hampton Court Palace and Kingston-upon-Thames.

Since then the Surrey 100 sportive and race have come through the village each July.

==Bonfire==
Since the 1930s a bonfire has been held on the Green to celebrate Guy Fawkes Night. It is a major local event with several thousand attending to see the bonfire, fireworks and funfair.

== Surrounds ==

This area has a number of short and long walks. Ripley Green is an integral part of the community and can be accessed from Newark Lane and the High Street. There is a village common and small woods which are surrounded by farmland. Walkers can walk down the River Wey from here and see views of Newark Priory.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

Originally a Newar foundation, Kirtipur is still a center of Newar culture. It has been merged with surrounding villages to form the municipality of Kirtipur with a population of 67,171. southern Part of Kirtipur is surrounded by ChampaDevi Hill. On Nepali new Year (Bishak 1) people around kathmandu Valley hike up to the Hill.

It has many temples, &quot;gumbas&quot; (Buddhist monasteries) and churches.

Due to the presence of Tribhuvan University, Kirtipur is a popular area for out-of-town students and professors to rent houses and they are major contributors to the local economy.

==History==
Kirtipur&#x27;s history dates from 1099 A.D. It was part of the territory of Lalitpur at the time of the invasion of the Kathmandu Valley by the Gorkhali king Prithvi Narayan Shah in the 18th century.
In 1767, Kirtipur was annexed to the Gorkhali kingdom by Prithvi Narayan Shah following the Battle of Kirtipur. He conquered the town on his third attempt, after entering it by trickery. After this, he cut off the noses of the people (both male and female) over 13 years of age in the city.

This was the site of an inspirational peaceful demonstration of the people in the 2006 mass uprising that overthrew the powers of the king. It is considered to be an anti-monarchy city due to its bitter history against the Shah dynasty whose modern founder conquered the city insultingly, which was followed by negligence of the administration and development by subsequent rulers.

==Places of interest==
===Bagh Bhairab===
Bagh Bhairab Temple is one of the most popular temples dedicated to the angry incarnation of lord Shiva in the form of an angry tiger. This god is regarded as the guardian of Kirtipur and the locals call it Ajudeu, a grandfather god. Bhairab, the most terrifying and awful form of Shiva, is the destroyer on one hand and the guardian on the other. Ceremonial rituals in relation to the important events of life such as rice-feeding, puberty, marriage and even the construction of houses cannot be done without propitiating this deity in most of the towns and cities of Nepal.
Bagh Bhairab is mainly worshiped by the Munsi Newars (Man Singh Pradhan). Each of the male family members, on a yearly basis, are supposed to take the chest of Bagh Bhairab turn by turn and keep it in a secret room and worship it twice a day. It is believed that any wrong method applying for worship might curse the individual. Denial for taking the chest home accounts for a fine equivalent to US$2000.

The present three storeyed temple of Bagh Bhairab, probably built in the 16th century, stands in the brick-paved rectangular courtyard with rest houses around it. Some small shrines and stone idols are spread over the courtyard. The main gate is at the southern side of the courtyard. There are two other gates on the eastern and western sides. The two roofs of the temple are made of tiles while the third is covered with gilt copper. Wooden posts with the carving of Hindu gods, and goddesses adorn the temple in addition to supporting its roof. They have been installed in between windows of the second storey, and the names of the carved deities have been finely cut out below them on the pedestals.

There are eighteen pinnacles: one on the first roof, six on the middle and eleven on the top. Beneath the eaves of the first roof there are very old but faded murals depicting the stories of Ramayan. Maha Bharat and the various manifestations of Durga, the mighty goddess. These paintings are frescoes in red with white plaster background. At the right side of the main gate of the temple there is Hifa Dyo, the god of blood sacrifice is allowed directly to Bagh Bhairab, all animal offerings here are made to this deity just like the animal sacrifices are made to Kumari, a stone idol, placed at the second gate in the left side of Chandeswori in Banepa and to the Chhetrapal which is at the very beginning of the final series of the steps to the temple of Khadga Jogini in Sankhu.

There are two torans over Hifa Dyo. They bear very fine cuttings of Asta-Matriks, Asta-Bhairabs and other gods and goddesses. In the western wall of the temple there is a hollow space regarded by the local people as Nasa Dyo, the god of music, and dance. Bagh Bhairab made of clay has been enshrined in the left side corner in the temple. The three glass-eyed tiger-god is tongue-less and tooth-less but covered with silver and copper plates and heavily ornamented. This deity as mentioned in the stone inscriptions has been called Bagheswor (the tiger god), Bhimsen Bhattarak(Bhimsen, the governing deity), Gudei Sthanadhipati (the lord in the form of tiger) and Ajudyo(the ancestral god).

The local people regard this deity as the embodiment of prudence, knowledge, productivity and strength to resist all evils. Hence, the auspicious ceremonies such as weddings, Bratabandha (rite of passage for adolescent boys), Pasni (rice-feeding) and other ritual performances in Kirtipur are done only after a ceremonial worship to this deity.

===Chilancho Stupa===
A Buddhist shrine is situated on the southern hill. Chilancho Vihar (monastery) is situated on the eastern side of Kirtipur, Nepal. It was made in the medieval period. An inscription of Nepal Samvat 635 (Licchavi Period) is found in this Chaitya. Therefore, it is one of the most important historical stupas of this region. In Nepal Bhasa, the word Chilan means immortal and the word Cho means Hill. Therefore, its literal meaning is the immortal god situated on the hill. The stupa is about  9.0-10.5 high on a quadrangular base. On all four sides, there are small chaityas. The dome is plastered white.
===Uma Maheshwor===
Uma Maheshwor temple (locally, Kwacho Dega) is one of the important heritage sites of Kirtipur. This pagoda-style three-storied temple is situated at the highest point (1414 m) of Kirtipur. Since this temple is at the top of the hill, one can enjoy picturesque view of the Kathmandu valley and mountains like Langtang, Dorge Lakkpa, Chobhu Bhamure, and Gaurishankar.

The temple was constructed in 1655 A.D. by Rautra Vishwanath Babu, a son of king Sidhhi Narsinga Malla. It was destroyed in an earthquake in 1832 A.D. After remaining dilapidated for about a century, it was restored in 1933 A.D. after it was again destroyed by an earthquake. Local people and government made a herculean effort to renovate it into the current state. The restoration process was completed only in 1982 A.D. In 2008 some work was done to preserve the arts of temple.

There is an artistic stone gate at the entrance. On each side of the stone staircase leading to the temple is a stone elephant, with sculptures of Bhimsen and Kuber as protectors of the temple. The main deities in this temple are standing Lord Shiva and Parvati. There are other images of deities like Sarasvati and Mahismardini on false doors around temple.

The wooden doors, pillars, and beams are crafted with artistic figures of different gods and goddess such as Astamatrika and Asta Bhairav. Similarly, erotic figures are also carved in wooden beams. According to archeologists, these figures on beams have tantric values.

The bell on the northern side of temple was cast in 1895 by Gillett &amp; Johnston Founders, Corydon. It was one of the four quarter bells of Ghantaghar of the central Kathmandu and was reallocated to this temple after the Ghantaghar was destroyed by the earthquake in 1933.

===Nagar Mandap Shri Kirti Bihar===
A Theravada Buddhist monastery built in traditional Thai architectural style, is situated near the entrance to the city.

<doc id="1311965" wikidata="Q3523409" url="?curid=1311965" title="The Wolfhounds">
<text>The Wolfhounds are an English noise pop band formed in Romford, Essex, in 1985 by David Callahan, Paul Clark, Andy Golding, Andy Bolton and Frank Stebbing, and originally active until 1990. The band reformed in 2005 and continues to write, record and play live, releasing new albums in 2014, 2016, and 2020.

==History==
The Wolfhounds began as a slightly askew indie pop/rock band: David Callahan would later describe them as &quot;pretty much a garage band but with a post-punk influence - more like The Fall crossed with The Stooges, with a bit of The Seeds thrown in.&quot; Collectively, they&#x27;d begun at an early age. Callahan: &quot;We would turn up to gigs and it would feel like everyone there was ten years older than us. Even our first reviews in the music papers were describing us as little kids. We were eighteen. The Kinks were seventeen when they started having hits, but this wasn&#x27;t what people were used to any more. They were used to people in their twenties and thirties. We were no-hopers who&#x27;d just left school and were working in warehouses and shops.&quot; Alongside Stebbing’s brother Simon and Bob Manton (both from The Purple Hearts), Clark and Callahan had previously played together in The Changelings, also known as &quot;The Change Lings&quot;, who mostly performed classic garage band covers from the &quot;Nuggets&quot; and &quot;Pebbles&quot; compilation classics: the band received a single photo review in &quot;Sounds&quot; and placed one song, recorded on a cassette player, on Hit Records&#x27; &quot;Garage Goodies Vol. 1&quot; compilation.)

The Wolfhounds signed to the Pink label in 1986. Their first EP &quot;Cut the Cake&quot; was well enough received for the &quot;NME&quot; to include them on their C86 compilation album, to which they contributed &quot;Feeling So Strange Again&quot;.

In 2022, Callahan recalled &quot;it didn&#x27;t occur to us to actually record something properly or do our best song. We figured we&#x27;d never record &quot;Feeling So Strange Again&quot; otherwise as it wasn&#x27;t one of our best songs. We&#x27;ll just throw it away on a tape. Who&#x27;s interested in a tape?... We already had &quot;The Anti-Midas Touch&quot; and &quot;Me&quot; potentially big singles if we&#x27;d had the money behind us. But we were dumb-asses... In the six or so hours we had to record that afternoon, we could have done (&quot;The Anti-Midas Touch&quot;) really well and it would have been on a tape that ended up selling tens of thousands.&quot; In spite of this, the band saw an abrupt and substantial spike in the number of people coming to their shows, and went on to play the C86 gig at the ICA, at which they went down very well.

After two more singles and a debut album, &quot;Unseen Ripples from a Pebble&quot;, on Pink, they briefly moved to Idea Records for the &quot;Me&quot; single, then rejoined Pink&#x27;s boss at his new label September Records. September soon evolved into Midnight Music which was the Wolfhounds&#x27; home for all subsequent releases.

Callahan has commented &quot;as soon as we got attention, there was some panic in the band, with a couple of members thinking that we needed to be more commercial. It seemed ridiculous to me - we didn&#x27;t have the chops for that. But we were a democracy, so that&#x27;s how it went for a while.&quot;

With original members Bolton and Clark replaced by David Oliver and Matt Deighton, the Wolfhounds&#x27; sound developed into a denser, less poppy sound. After a compilation of earlier material, second album proper &quot;Bright and Guilty&quot; was released in 1989, featuring the singles &quot;Son of Nothing&quot;, &quot;Rent Act&quot; and &quot;Happy Shopper&quot;. The sound progressed further with the albums &quot;Blown Away&quot; (also 1989) and &quot;Attitude&quot; (1990), which found them in Sonic Youth territory, interspersing raging guitars with elegant compositional exercises. This proved to be the final Wolfhounds release of the 80s, with the band splitting in early 1990.

Callahan has commented &quot;we put out three really good albums in the space of fifteen months that sounded like no-one else, and we even started to look good, but no-one gave a shit... People would say &quot;if this band was from Boston, they&#x27;d be massive&quot; and this kind of thing, but no-one was paying attention... We&#x27;d been through four labels in five years and it just wasn&#x27;t happening. We weren&#x27;t getting any more chances. We&#x27;d reached rock bottom. There was no way out.&quot;

Golding and Stebbing formed Crawl, while Callahan joined forces with former Ultra Vivid Scene member Margaret Fiedler in Moonshake. Matt Deighton formed Mother Earth.

==Reformation==
Over the years, Callahan had received offers to perform with or be interviewed about The Wolfhounds, but by that time had established himself as a freelance ornithologist and had no interest in revisiting his musical past. However, he was finally convinced into reforming The Wolfhounds in 2006 for a gig organised by Bob Stanley of Saint Etienne to play at the ICA in London, alongside Roddy Frame and Phil Wilson, to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the &quot;C86&quot; cassette.

Callahan: &quot;We started playing together and it actually worked. I won&#x27;t say it was like the old days. It was &quot;better&quot;... it seemed like something we should continue with because it felt like a creative enterprise immediately.&quot; This event proved to be a turnaround in Callahan&#x27;s attitudes: &quot;I said yes, and it had worked. So I made a decision to say yes to everything, regardless of whether I had the time or not. And I&#x27;ve done that ever since.&quot;

With an ongoing line-up of David Callahan (guitar/vocals), Andy Golding (guitar/vocals), Peter Wilkins (drums) and Richard Golding (bass), the reunited Wolfhounds have continued to play live, having been further re-energised when The Membranes asked them to be special guests at The Lexington in London. In March 2012 they played with Laetitia Sadier from Stereolab in support at a benefit to raise funds for the Timperley Frank Sidebottom memorial statue.
An EP called &quot;EP001&quot; was released on Vollwert-Records Berlin in April 2012 containing three songs that pre-date the band&#x27;s first single but that were never recorded satisfactorily at the time. Of these songs, &#x27;Skullface&#x27; has picked up a lot of radio play.

The band released several 7&quot; singles in 2013, compiled with the previous EP on &quot;Middle Age Freaks&quot;, released by Odd Box Records in 2014. Also in 2014 an anniversary limited-edition issue of &quot;Unseen Ripples from a Pebble&quot; (plus bonus tracks) was released by Optic Nerve Recordings.

In October 2016, the Wolfhounds released their fifth album proper, &quot;Untied Kingdom (...Or How to Come to Terms with Your Culture)&quot;. Louder Than War rated it 9/10. Sixth album &quot;Electric Music&quot; followed in 2020, which the same magazine declared was &quot;arguably their best&quot; so far.

The Wolfhounds&#x27; ongoing ethos is to play as a current creative act rather than an exercise in indie nostalgia. Callahan: &quot;We do occasionally throw an old song into the set, like &quot;The Anti-Midas Touch&quot;, but rather like a band like The Nightingales, we go around playing songs from our latest LP... That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s always been like for us. I was always inspired by the attitude of The Fall, where you&#x27;d go to see them promoting &quot;Dragnet&quot; but they&#x27;d already be playing &quot;Grotesque&quot;. Or Wire would play &quot;154&quot; when &quot;Chairs Missing&quot; had only just come out. I&#x27;m not ashamed of what I&#x27;ve done in the past, and I&#x27;ll reflect on it and incorporate bits of it. But I&#x27;m always looking forward. I want to die with lots of unfinished work sitting there, waiting to be dealt with.&quot;

==Solo==
Callahan, as David Lance Callahan, released a solo single &quot;Strange Lovers&quot; in 2019, followed by the album &quot;English Primitive I&quot; in 2021. Andy Golding, as Dragon Welding, released an eponymous LP in 2019, and second album &quot;Lights Behind The Eyes&quot; in 2021.

<doc id="1311977" wikidata="Q7374705" url="?curid=1311977" title="Royal Pharmaceutical Society">
<text>The Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPharmS or RPS) is the body responsible for the leadership and support of the pharmacy profession (pharmacists) within England, Scotland, and Wales. It was created along with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) in September 2010 when the previous Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain was split so that representative and regulatory functions of the pharmacy profession could be separated. Membership in the society is not a prerequisite for engaging in practice as a pharmacist within the United Kingdom. Its predecessor the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain was founded on 15 April 1841.

==History==
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society was founded on 15 April 1841 as the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, and headquartered at 17 Bloomsbury Square, London. Among its founding members were Jacob Bell and William Allen. The Northern British (Scottish) branch began the same year with nine founders including William Flockhart and John Duncan. From 1843, it had a royal charter that identified its chief objectives as the advancement of chemistry and pharmacy, the promotion of a system of education for its practitioners, and the legal protection of its members.

==Headquarters==

The headquarters of the society are on East Smithfield Road, located near Whitechapel and St Katharine Docks in London, UK. From 1976 until 2015 the Royal Pharmaceutical Society&#x27;s headquarters was in Lambeth on Lambeth High Street, London, UK.

== Membership ==

The Society currently offers five categories of membership:
* Member: Full membership is available to anyone who has ever been registered as a pharmacist in Great Britain, whether or not currently registered with the GPhC.
* Fellow: Fellowship may be conferred by the Society’s Panel of Fellows on pharmacists who have been members of the Society for at least 12 years and who have been deemed to have made outstanding original contributions. 
* Associate: Associate membership is open to two categories of person: (a) those registered elsewhere in the world who have never been registered in Britain; (b) those who have a recognized degree in pharmacy but have not yet registered as a pharmacist in Britain, either because they are still undergoing their preregistration trainings or because they are not working in a field of practice that requires registration with the GPhC.
* Student: Student membership is available to anyone studying for a degree in pharmacy at any institute recognized by the Society (in Britain or overseas).
* Pharmaceutical Scientist: Pharmacist scientist membership is available to anyone with a degree (or equivalent) in a subject related to the pharmacy who has worked for at least two years in a recognized area of the pharmaceutical sciences.

==President of the society==

* 2021 Claire Anderson 
* 2019 Sandra Gidley
* 2017 – 2019 Ash Soni
* 2016 – 2017 Martin Astbury
* 2014 – 2016 Ash Soni

== Publishing ==
The Society operates two divisions of RPS Publishing: 
* The Pharmaceutical Press publishes textbooks on a wide range of topics in pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences including the British National Formulary, the British National Formulary for Children and .
* PJ Publications publishes the weekly professional journal &quot;The Pharmaceutical Journal&quot; and the monthly &quot;Clinical Pharmacist&quot;.

==Royal Pharmaceutical Society Museum==
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain had a museum collection since 1842, which continues to be managed by the RPS at its offices in East Smithfield. A historical collection was established in 1937 and expanded in the 1940s–1960s by Agnes Lothian. The exhibits cover all aspects of British pharmacy history, and include:

*Traditional dispensing equipment
*Drug storage containers
*Fine &quot;Lambeth delftware&quot; dating from the 17th and 18th centuries
*Proprietary (brand name) medicines dating from the 18th century to the present day
*Bronze mortars
*Medical caricatures
*A photo archive

Since 2002, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society has concentrated on developing the collection of historical and contemporary proprietary medicines.

The museum is open to visitors and admission is free. Guided tours are available if booked in advance. In 1983 the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain donated over 10,000 historic specimens of materia medica, including crude drugs, herbarium sheets, and slides to the Kew Gardens. This material is now housed in the Economic Botany Collection (EBC) at Kew. The museum is a member of the London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine.

==Prizes and awards==
The RPS has six academic and professional awards for pharmacists at different stages of their career. These are:

*The Hanbury Medal
*The Harrison Medal
*Outstanding Pharmacy Early-career Researcher Award
*RPS Charter Medals
*RPS Fellowship and Honorary Fellowship
*The Daniel Thomas Award

==National Pharmacy Boards==
The three boards provide professional leadership and advocacy support for pharmacy practice in England, Scotland and Wales respectively. They are currently Chaired by Thorrun Govind, Andrew Carruthers and Cheryl Way respectively. The members of the boards are elected by the members of the society, but the members of the assembly are not. The members of the assembly are elected by members of the boards. The assembly is senior to the boards in terms of policy making.

<text>Chinju (Jinju) National University of Education () is one of several national universities of education in South Korea. It provides training to many planning on careers in the country&#x27;s public education system. The campus is located in Jinju City, South Gyeongsang province. The current president is Kim, Sung-gyu (김성규).

==Academics==
At the undergraduate level, the course of study is divided between general academics and study specific to teaching. The academic departments cover most of the recognized specializations of public-school teaching, namely: Computer Education, English Education, Elementary Education, Practical Arts Education, Fine Arts Education, Music Education, Physical Education, Science Education, Mathematics Education, Social Studies Education, Korean Education, and Ethics Education. Unlike other shifts where most timetables in Korea have already been set and cannot register for classes, Chinju (Jinju) National University of Education is free to register for classes from the first grade.

==History==
The main school was approved as a public school in Gyeongsangnam-do on March 31, 1923 and opened on April 24. In addition, in 1940, according to the policy of converting a public school into a government office, it was reorganized into a government-run Jinju School of Education on April 1. At that time, the main school was located at Jinju Agricultural School (currently Gyeongsang National University Chilam Campus) and has been in existence since it was moved to its current location in 1942. In 1961, a bill was enacted to train elementary school teachers at the level of beginner universities, and the opening ceremony and admission ceremony were held on March 8 in accordance with the establishment of Jinju Education University (Revised Ordinance No. 1133). In accordance with Article 120 of the 1983 Education Act and Paragraph 2 of the Supplementary Provisions of the same Act, this school was promoted to a four-year education university. In 1993, the name was changed from Jinju National University of Education to Jinju National University of Education in accordance with the National School Establishment Decree (Presidential Decree No. 13859) and it is still called the official name of the school to this day. The current local name is Jinju, but the name of the school is CNUE(Chinju National University of Education) because Jinju was written Chinju in the past, influenced by Revised Romanization of Korean(RRK). In the 2000s, various facilities were newly built, including the auditorium (2002), the second dormitory (2004), the affiliated elementary school multipurpose auditorium and swimming education center (2005), and the teacher education center (2007). The first lecture building, which is most frequently used by the members of the school, was newly built in 2011. Following Dr. Information-ju, the 5th president in 2007, Dr. Kim Sun-yu, the 6th president in 2011, and Dr. Choi Moon-sung, the 7th president in 2016, the 8th president Yoo Gil-han, who has been in office since 2020, marks a historic 100th anniversary.

== Mascot &#x27;CUE-T&#x27; ==
Jinju National University of Education (hereinafter referred to as Jinju National University of Education) has produced and released an emblem, mascot, and catchphrase to celebrate the 100th anniversary. The unveiled emblem is a design that emphasizes the 100th anniversary based on orange, the symbolic color of Jinju National University of Education, where the number 1 means torch and the number 00 connects the two to indicate infinity. Although it is now the 100th anniversary, it expresses social growth and the future creation of education through education that will continue forever. The catchphrase was selected through a contest to represent the meaning and values of the 100th anniversary of the opening of Jinju National University of Education in a core and implicative way and to show the vision of the future. The best catchphrase is &quot;100 Years of Roots, Dream of Future Education!&quot; It contains the meanings of realizing future educational dreams at Jinju National University of Education with a deep history of 100 years and the specific meanings of specialization (D), recovery (R), empathy (E), attitude (A), and change (M). The new mascot is a motif of a deer, a professor of Jinju National University of Education, and the horn of the deer represents CUE, an abbreviation for alternating school, and the character name is CUE-T, which combines CUE and Teacher of Jinju National University of Education. Deer is an animal with the character of a strong and strong in history, which well implies the role and value of Jinju University of Education as a teacher training university with the right personality and activity, and will be expressed in various promotional materials by adding familiar images.

<doc id="1311987" wikidata="Q445179" url="?curid=1311987" title="Old East Slavic literature">
<text>Old East Slavic literature, also known as Old Russian literature, is a collection of literary works of Rus&#x27; authors, which includes all the works of ancient Rus&#x27; theologians, historians, philosophers, translators, etc., and written in Old East Slavic. It is a general term that unites the common literary heritage of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine of the ancient period. In terms of genre construction, it has a number of differences from medieval European literature. The greatest influence on the literature of ancient Rus&#x27; was exerted by old Polish and old Serbian literature.

Most of the monuments of Old East Slavic literature have been preserved in the form of manuscripts. The most common type of manuscript was literary collections. Notebooks written by a single scribe could then be bound by the scribe or binder himself. Such collections can be of a certain (&quot;Zlatostruy&quot;, &quot;Izmaragd&quot;, &quot;Solemn&quot;, etc.) or indefinite content, reflecting the individual tastes and interests of one or another scribe who selected materials for himself or for his customer.

Unlike other traditionalist literatures, the Old East Slavic literature is characterized by syncretism, lack of clearly expressed poetological reflection, conscious rejection of rationalism and specification of theoretical knowledge. It differs from Byzantine literature by its emphasized irregularity, the blurring of genres and boundaries between the prosaic and the poetic, and the lack of a clear conceptual apparatus.

Voluminous works could be copied and intertwined into separate books: some letopises, works on world history, paterics, works of a liturgical nature, prologues, etc. Small compositions, for example, &quot;Praying of Daniel the Immured&quot; or the &quot;Tale of the Destruction of the Rus&#x27; Land&quot; did not make up separate books, but were distributed in collections.

== Origins ==
=== Pre-Christian period ===
The early examples of pre-Christian Old East Slavic Rus&#x27; literature should primarily include the oral epic: legends, myths and fairy tales. Most of the Old East Slavic oral folklore was recorded only in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Among the oral works, stories about the meeting of a person with an otherworldly force were particularly distinguished. Such a story by genre was divided into a &quot;bailichka&quot;, where a meeting with evil spirits is told on behalf of an &quot;eyewitness&quot;, and a &quot;byvalschina&quot;, an oral story about a case that allegedly took place in reality, without focusing on the personal testimony of the narrator. and &quot;byvalschina&quot; were often told in the villages to friends or children in order to wean them to walk far from home, and, according to Yevgeny Meletinsky, they became the prototype of &quot;scary fairy tales&quot;.
Later, a special type of druzhina poetry began to take shape – bylina, Rus&#x27; epic poems about heroic or mythological events or remarkable episodes of national history. In some ways, bylina are similar to skaldic poetry: both are divided into songs of praise and blasphemy and glorify some historical event. Bylina, as a rule, are written in tonic verse with two or four accents.

=== Early period: translated Apocrypha ===
Almost all the literature of Rus&#x27; – original and translated – was handwritten. Handwritten works were distributed by copying by scribes or ordinary people.

In Rus&#x27;, the apocrypha about the Last Judgment was especially popular. Among such works, a special place was occupied by the life of Basil the Younger, the second part of which (scenes from the vision of Vasily Gregory&#x27;s pupil about the Last Judgment and a lengthy story about Theodore) spread as independent works.

Later, the original Old East Slavic apocrypha began to be created, the most famous of which is &quot;The Walking of the Virgin through the Torments&quot;. Its plot is similar to the Greek &quot;Revelation of the Most Holy Theotokos&quot;, but it also has many original features: for example, pagans who worship , Veles and Perun are in the first circle of hell, and there are a number of anti-Semitic statements in the text itself.

According to the philosopher Sergei Bulgakov, the special popularity of apocryphal literature in Rus&#x27; is indicated by the fact that of the seven most important monuments of the Jewish apocalyptic (except for the books of the prophet Daniel), three were preserved exclusively in Old Slavonic translations.

=== Early original compositions ===
Presumably, both epics and folk tales were not recorded by contemporaries for the reason that Rus&#x27; inherited from the Byzantine Empire a ban on literary fiction and the presence of a purely artistic function in the works. Back in 1073, the compilers of the &quot;Izbornik Svyatoslav&quot; warned against worldly writings based on artistic imagination. Fiction developed only in the late period.
However, despite some limitations, scientific and artistic works had to answer questions related to natural history (the origin of the world, cosmology) and the development of human society (the settlement of peoples, the origin of power, the state, the meaning and purpose of human history).

The first original works in Kievan Rus&#x27; were instructive collections, which are the most common type of manuscripts (even after the beginning of printing in Russia in 1569, manuscripts have not lost their popularity). The scribe copied various works according to some attribute or genre in a notebook. Notebooks written by one scribe could then be bound by the scribe himself or the bookbinder into a separate book. The bookbinder could collect notebooks of different times and different scribes and connect them because they were of the same format or were combined by them according to content. Such collections are currently called convolutes. Such collections of teachings as Izmaragd, Golden Chain, Bee, Solemn, Zlatostruy (origins), Pchela (of Byzantine origin) were originally intended for home and monastic cell reading. Included in these is the Palea, a collection of several interconnected ancient Rus&#x27; works that set out Old Testament history, with additions from apocryphal monuments, as well as with theological reasoning.

Already in the early period of the development of Rus&#x27; literature, one can trace the understanding of Rus&#x27; not only as an ethno-political and religious community, but also as the Kingdom of Christ. In the Sermon on Law and Grace of the middle of the 11th century (the future Metropolitan, Hilarion of Kiev), the newly baptized Rus&#x27; people are called new. The perception of the people who were baptized in the &quot;last times&quot; (before the Last Judgment) as new, endowed with special grace, was characteristic of Rus&#x27;. The widespread idea of an imminent dreadful judgment was strongly reflected in the Old East Slavic literature of that period; ascetic creations and instructive literature became an introduction to soteriology (the doctrine of the salvation of the soul).

== Genres ==
As most modern researchers note, there is no clear division of literature into genres in ancient Rus&#x27;. There were only a few authors who clearly defined the genre of their works (among such were the monk Phoma, Nil Sorsky, Metropolitan Macarius, and the nameless author of &quot;The Tale of Mikhail Tverskoy&quot;). Thus, the lexeme &quot;Word&quot; (, also translatable as &quot;Tale&quot;, &quot;Lay&quot; or &quot;Discourse&quot;) often perceived as the name of a genre, could mean a didactic teaching, a chapter of a book, a conversation, a speech, articles of various content, etc.

Nevertheless, Nikita Tolstoy made an attempt to classify ancient Rus&#x27; literature; later, the classification was edited by Evgeny Vereshchagin (the latter version is somewhat different from Tolstoy&#x27;s):
* &quot;scriptural monuments&quot;: the Bible (Holy Scripture) and biblical apocrypha, see Bible translations into Church Slavonic 
* &quot;liturgical/euchographic&quot;: liturgical books and hymnographic monuments
* &quot;doctrinal&quot;: symbols, statements of faith, catechumens, polemical and ethical instructive teachings, interpretations
* &quot;preaching&quot;: oratory prose and gnostic literature
* &quot;hagiographic&quot;: lives of saints, laudatory words to saints, tales of acquisitions, transfer of relics and icons, miracles
* &quot;canonical and legal&quot;: statutes, Kormchaia Books, law books (Kievan Rus&#x27; law), contractual, spiritual, deeds, etc. letters
* &quot;memorial&quot;: letopises (including Rus&#x27; chronicles and Lithuanian–Belarusian chronicles), chronographs, descriptions of historical events, pilgrimages, travels
* &quot;scientific&quot;: encyclopedic collections
* &quot;household&quot;: private correspondence, inscriptions, epigraphy.

This classification does not distinguish between primary genres (for example, hagiographies) and unifying genres that include small works as source material (prologue, menaiat-chets, etc.). This difference is taken into account in the classification based on the systematics of Dmitry Likhachev, who distinguished between monumental and small genre forms. Nikolai Prokofiev gave the following classification:
* &quot;complex forms&quot;: letopises, chronographs, hagiographic collections, letters, etc.
* &quot;primary genres&quot;:
** &quot;epic genres&quot;
*** &quot;historical genres&quot;: lives of the saints, military tale, legend and walking
*** &quot;allegorical&quot;: parables
*** &quot;symbolic&quot;: miracle, vision, sign, divinatory literature
** &quot;lyrical genres&quot;: teaching, message, crying.
The most important feature of epic genres is the object of the image and lyrical purpose.

== Mathematics and cosmology ==
=== Mathematical-Easter essays ===
In the early period after the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27;, there was no special church calendar, and the Old Slavic calendar was not suitable for calculating church holidays. Therefore, many authors had to make their own calculations in their works, which ranked their works among not only Paschal, but also mathematical treatises. For complex calculations, &quot;schoty&quot; was often used.

The earliest mathematical work of Kievan Rus&#x27; is considered to be &quot;the doctrine of numbers&quot; by Kirik the Novgorodian, a treatise on the calculus of time, combining an essay on mathematics, chronology and Paschalistics.

However, later mathematical treatises did not receive a proper development in Kievan Rus&#x27;. Among the works equal to the &quot;doctrine of numbers&quot;, scientists include the &quot;Charter of military Affairs&quot; created in the 15th and 16th centuries, which set out the tasks of triangulation on the ground, and the &quot;Book of soshny writing&quot;, dedicated to land surveying. Later works include an extensive manuscript entitled &quot;Synodal No. 42&quot;, the first textbook in Rus&#x27; on theoretical geometry.

=== Cosmology works ===
The early cosmological works of Kievan Rus&#x27; were partially influenced by apocryphal writings, mixed with pre-Christian ideas about the structure of the world.

Thus, much attention is paid to the creation and structure of the world in two of the most significant early works: the Dove Book and &quot;About the whole creation&quot;. Both works have a complex structure and are probably based on Old East Slavic apocryphal legends that existed for the early period after the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

It is also interesting that in the &quot;Depth Book&quot;, as in two other ancient Rus&#x27; monuments – &quot;The Conversation of the Three Saints&quot; and &quot;The Conversation of Jerusalem&quot; – for some reason, whales are endowed with supernatural power. In the &quot;Conversation of the Three Saints&quot;, the Earth floats on top of the great sea on three large whales and 30 small whales; the latter cover 30 sea windows; &quot;The Conversation of Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;Depth Book&quot; connect the movement of the whale with the end of the world. According to the &quot;Depth Book&quot; — &quot;The Whale-fish is the mother of all fish. On the Whale-fish the earth is founded; when the Whale-fish turns, then our white light is finished (the end of all things will come)&quot;.

The so-called &quot;fortune-telling books&quot; (also &quot;divinatory books&quot;) can probably also be attributed to cosmological works, which are currently not officially assigned to any of the genres of Kievan Rus&#x27;. Fortune-telling books (&quot;Volkhovnik&quot;, &quot;Gromnik&quot;, &quot;Kolyadnik&quot;, &quot;Trepetnik&quot;, &quot;Enchanter&quot;, etc.) were mainly distributed secretly: they were copied, sewn into other books, and passed on by inheritance. Officially, the distribution of such literature was persecuted by the church; lists of forbidden (so-called renounced) books of Kievan Rus&#x27; were compiled, in which divinatory literature was equated with apocrypha.

== Theological literature ==
Very popular in ancient Rus&#x27; were the lives of saints (&quot;zhytie&quot;), a kind of genre of hagiography that describes the life, deeds and miracles of ancient Rus&#x27; saints, martyrs and miracle workers.
== Poetics ==

The scientist Alexander Panchenko refers to the earliest forms of Old East Slavic versification as the so-called &quot;penitential poems&quot; (the metrical nature of which is not yet clear), single poetic texts written by the monk of the Kirillo-Belozersky monastery Efrosin, as well as separate chapters &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; and the &quot;Tale of the Destruction of the Rus&#x27; Land&quot; containing a metric constant.

Despite this, versification in Kievan Rus&#x27; was most often not approved, because was considered inherent only in &quot;Latins&quot;. This position was most consistently expressed by Archpriest Avvakum: “Do not look for rhetoric and philosophy, or eloquence, but live with a sound true verb. Therefore, а rhetorician and philosopher cannot be a Christian. Alexander Panchenko pointed out that the Old East Slavic church poetry was strongly influenced by West Slavic, especially Polish literature. Simeon Polotsky, releasing his &quot;Rhymed Psalter&quot; (1680), wrote that in Moscow they loved &quot;the consonant singing of the Polish Psalter&quot;.

=== Syllabic verse ===

Some of the earliest representatives of Old East Slavic syllabic poetry are such poets as Karion Istomin, Simeon of Polotsk, Theophan Prokopovich, Antiochus Kantemir, Sylvester Medvedev and . The principle of syllabic symmetry was dominant. A twelve-syllable verse with a caesura after the fifth or sixth syllable was used; there are, for example, such complex schemes as: 5-6-8|8-6-5|7-7-4-5-3-5 (12 verses of Irmos &quot;...) or 8|5-5-5|8-8|5-5-5 (9 verses of Irmos &quot;...) There were also schemes where the number of syllables in each verse was a multiple of three (from St. Trinity, the sacred number &quot;three&quot; for Christians).

The detailed life in the monastery can be judged by the syllabic poem by Karion Istomin &quot;About speaking from people, how monks live in the monastery&quot;:

=== Acrostics ===

The acrostic form became very popular in Ancient Rus&#x27; poetics. It was also widely developed there. The earliest work in the genre of acrostic in ancient Russia is considered to be the , translated from Old Bulgarian. The acrostic in the Old East Slavic book poetry was also known in later times. Thus, the acrostic is found in one of the &quot;greetings&quot; of Karion Istomin to Tsarevich Alexey Petrovich:

Here the acrostic is &quot;Alexy Tsarevich live forever&quot; (; in the fourth verse in the original, the first letter is the Slavic &quot;xi&quot;).

== Kievan Rus&#x27; law, documentation ==
In Kievan Rus&#x27;, there were a number of canonical and legal statutes and rights. The special charters, judicial books, contractual, spiritual certificates and contribution certificates were common for the people and for the church. Most collections of Kievan Rus&#x27; law are strictly divided into civil and ecclesiastical. The exception is the Merilo Pravednoye, which is both a collection of church-canonical and civil legal legal nature.

=== Temporal law ===
The legal basis of the Kievan Rus&#x27; state was the Russkaya Pravda, Lithuanian statutes and Moscow Sidebniks. In 1649, the Sobornoye Ulozheniye was added to these written laws.

The so-called &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; (&quot;Rus&#x27; Justice&quot;) is of great importance for the study of Kievan Rus&#x27; law. The &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; is a collection of legal norms of Rus&#x27;, dated from various years, starting from 1016, the oldest Rus&#x27; legal code. The &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; contains the norms of criminal, compulsory, hereditary, family and procedural law. It is the main source for studying the legal, social and economic relations of Kievan Rus&#x27;. The &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; is similar to earlier European legal collections, such as Germanic law (the so-called &quot;Leges Barbarorum&quot;, &quot;laws of the barbarians&quot;), for example, the Salic law, a collection of legislative acts of the Frankish state, the oldest text of which dates back to the beginning of the 6th century.

The short version consists of the following parts:
* The Oldest Pravda or the truth of Yaroslav (Articles 1-18), 1016, is usually associated with the activities of Yaroslav the Wise;
* The Pravda of the Yaroslavichs (Izyaslav, Vsevolod and Svyatoslav, sons of Yaroslav the Wise, who were part of the Yaroslavich triumvirate) (articles 19–41), the youngest of the three princes Vsevolod is named before the middle Svyatoslav), does not have an exact date, often refers to 1072;
* Pokon virny (Article 42) – determination of the order of &quot;feeding&quot; of virniks (princely servants, collectors of vir-court fines), 1020s or 1030s;
* Urok to mostniks (Article 43) – regulation of the remuneration of bridge builders, or, according to some versions, bridge builders, 1020s or 1030s.

As many researchers have noted, the most ancient part of the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; (the oldest pravda) preserves the custom of blood feud, characteristic of the laws of pre-Christian Kievan Rus&#x27;, although it limits it to the circle of closest relatives. The lengthy version includes about 121 articles and consists of two parts-the Charter of Yaroslav Vladimirovich and the Charter of Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh. According to most researchers, the Lengthy Truth is based on the Short text, which was amended and supplemented, including those adopted during the Kiev reign of Vladimir II Monomakh.

=== Ecclesiastical law ===
With the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27;, church law arose. The most important source of church law in Kievan Rus&#x27; was the &quot;sudebniki&quot;, the most famous of which is the Zakon Sudnyi Liudem (the South Slavic legal Code of the 9th and 10th centuries, although some scholars consider it a reworking of some Byzantine and Jewish laws). However, most often in the ecclesiastical sphere of Kievan Rus&#x27;, they used &quot;kormchaia&quot; books, legal collections that contained both church rules and the decisions of the Roman and Byzantine emperors on the church.

From the translated Byzantine collections of ecclesiastical law in Kievan Rus&#x27;, nomocanons, &#x27;, &#x27;, and Zanon books (translation of Byzantine laws) were used. However, despite the widespread existence in the written tradition, Byzantine law did not have a significant application in legal practice, and its full reception did not occur. Rus&#x27; ecclesiastical law was based primarily on the ecclesiastical statutes issued by the knyazes, based on local law and only limited borrowing of Byzantine law.

Later, in 1551, the comprehensive religious collection Stoglav was created, combining the norms of judicial, criminal and ecclesiastical law. Stoglav tried to solve the following pressing issues:
* strengthening of church discipline among the clergy and the fight against the vicious behavior of representatives of the church (drunkenness, debauchery, bribery), usury of monasteries,
* unification of church rites and services,
* powers of the ecclesiastical court,
* combating the remnants of paganism among the population,
* strict regulation (and, in essence, the introduction of a kind of spiritual censorship) of the order of correspondence of church books, the writing of icons, the construction of Russian Orthodox Church buildings, etc.

&quot;Books of law&quot; and &quot;Merilo Pravednoye&quot;, one of the first Kievan Rus&#x27; collections of a civil and ecclesiastical-legal nature, contain both excerpts from Byzantine legislation and identical articles of Rus&#x27; origin, probably included in collections from an older one that did not come down to us of the collection of Kievan Rus&#x27; law.

<doc id="1311989" wikidata="Q2756178" url="?curid=1311989" title="Townsville Crocodiles">
<text>The Townsville Crocodiles were an Australian professional men&#x27;s basketball team based in the North Queensland city of Townsville. They competed in the National Basketball League (NBL) and played their home games at the Townsville Entertainment and Convention Centre. Between their inception in 1993 and their final season in 2015–16, the Crocodiles enjoyed financial stability and sustained community support, but on-court success eluded them.

== Team history ==
=== 1986–1992: Gaining admission into the NBL ===
Former Brisbane Bullets guard Mark Bragg, a Townsville resident, began campaigning to bring an NBL franchise to Townsville in the late 1980s. The franchise adopted the name of Townsville&#x27;s State League team, becoming the Townsville Suns. The NBL was ready to admit the Suns, along with fellow Queenslanders the Gold Coast Cougars, in 1990, but financial backing for the Suns&#x27; venue fell through.

Local government then got behind Bragg&#x27;s bid, and the Townsville Entertainment and Convention Centre was completed in time for the Suns&#x27; debut in February 1993.

=== 1993–1998: Early years ===
With Bragg at the helm as head coach, the Suns struggled during their debut season, but it only took five games before they recorded their first-ever NBL win, a victory over the Newcastle Falcons. Townsville broke the mould in 1993, becoming the first Australian team to hire an &#x27;import&#x27; player from a country other than the United States; Lithuanian player Rimas Kurtinaitis was a crucial part of the team during their debut season. The Suns finished 4–22 and took the wooden spoon.

Townsville would not reach the playoffs in its first six seasons, although they came perilously close in the 1997 season; needing only one win from their final six games to ensure a historic playoff appearance, the Suns went 0–6 after centre Clarence Tyson suffered a season-ending knee injury in Canberra. After a disappointing 1998 campaign, Mark Bragg was sacked as head coach. With 151 games played out of the Suns&#x27; 164, Jason Cameron was the only player to have played in all six Suns seasons.

Throughout, Townsville fans stuck by the team, ensuring the club set an Australian record for attendances; the Suns sold out their first 69 games at the &quot;Furnace&quot; (capacity 4,141), a streak that was only broken after the venue was expanded for the 1998 season.

=== 1998–2001: Name change and finals basketball ===
It was a very different team that took the court in the 1998/99 season. The team had been involved in a dispute with the NBA&#x27;s Phoenix Suns, who held the &quot;Suns&quot; trademark in Australia. Faced with the prospect of paying Phoenix royalties on merchandise sales, the team changed its name to the Townsville Crocodiles. New head coach Ian Stacker took the reins, and immediately attracted top-name talent like Australian Olympic player Sam Mackinnon, but it would take one more season before Townsville&#x27;s long-suffering fans saw playoff basketball.

The Crocodiles finished second in the NBL in 1999/2000 with a 22–6 record, meaning they got a first-round bye in the NBL playoffs. But they faced a battle-hardened Perth Wildcats team in the semi-finals, and were defeated 2–1 in front of their disappointed home fans. Perth would go on to win the championship.

The Crocs again went 22–6 the following year and, under the league&#x27;s new playoff system, eliminated both the Sydney Kings and the Victoria Titans. It came down to the grand final series, where the team lost 2 games to 1- 95–92 in the final game- after a thrilling fourth-quarter comeback by the Wollongong Hawks.

=== 2002–2006: Missed opportunities ===
Townsville missed the playoffs in 2002 and the 2003 season looked no better, but the Crocodiles strung together a 16-game winning streak to again finish second on the NBL ladder. (The streak equaled an NBL record.) Townsville lost the opening-round series 2–1 to Wollongong, but by virtue of NBL rules, got a second chance to advance; they were then finally eliminated by the eventual champion Sydney Kings.

After another disappointing season in 2005–06, Townsville head coach Ian Stacker&#x27;s contract was not renewed. The Crocodiles again failed to make the playoffs.

Trevor Gleeson was appointed coach and the team improved on their failed 2005–06 season by making the play-offs. They won their first final against one of the newcomers in the Singapore Slingers but lost their second to the Sydney Kings.

=== 2006–2009: Return to finals ===
2007–08 saw the Crocs struggle in their first ten games, only winning three matches. Before the season, the team was struggling with injuries to both 7-foot centre&#x27;s Ben Pepper (back) and Greg Vanderjagt (knee) along with swingman Bradley Sheridan (back). The team ended up losing newly signed import Rosell Ellis who suffered a freak of an injury when he tore his pectoral muscle during a weight session just after two matches. In those two matches saw Ellis get 27 points and 11 rebounds in both matches. The Crocs then brought in streetball legend Corey &#x27;Homicide&#x27; Wiliams which saw the Crocs turn back into a strong team. With also help from the crocs bench saw them finish the season in fifth place with a record of 17–13. But just like the 2006–07 season, saw the crocs win their first game against another newcomer Gold Coast Blaze but were once again saw them smashed by the team who finished one win higher than the Crocs in the Perth Wildcats 96–78.

The crocs have now made a push to make it to the top four in the 2008–09 season when they re-signed imports Williams and Ellis and also signings Brad Williamson and Steven Broom from the Brisbane Bullets and former Boomer Russell Hinder.

The 2008/09 season saw them struggle to have a full roster with Bradley Sheridan (ankles), Ben Pepper (personal reasons) and Steven Broom (shoulder) leaving the club before the season had even began. The local fans were able to rally behind the club to finish 5th. The Crocs were unable to make the grand final series as they were knocked out by eventual champions South Dragons.

=== 2013–2016: Financial troubles and disbandment ===
On 8 April 2013, the Crocodiles announced that Barrier Reef Basketball Pty Ltd was relinquishing its National Basketball League license, putting the Crocodiles&#x27; 2013–14 season in doubt. In September 2013, the Crocodiles re-entered the league as a community owned club under head coach, Shawn Dennis.

In June 2014, the Crocodiles announced that the Townsville RSL Stadium would be their new home court for the 2014–15 season. Following the 2014–15 season, the Crocodiles decided to place themselves into Voluntary Administration. On 21 May 2015, they re-entered the league for a second time after regaining control of the Deed of Company Arrangement and subsequently received NBL approval to re-enter the competition. The Crocodiles also announced that they would be returning to the Townsville Entertainment and Convention Centre for the 2015–16 season. In February 2016, the Queensland Police seized a compressed air launcher use by the team for over ten years to launch folded T-shirts into the crowd, after the device was deemed to be a category B weapon.

On 14 April 2016, the Crocodiles pulled out of the 2016–17 season due to financial pressures.
