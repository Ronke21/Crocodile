<text>Damien Michael Johnson (born 18 November 1978) is a Northern Irish football coach and former international player. Since 2019 he has been first team technical coach &amp; head of player development at Blackburn Rovers.

He began his career with Portadown in his native Northern Ireland from whom he signed as a trainee for Blackburn Rovers and spent seven years with the club, as well as spending time on loan with Nottingham Forest. He moved to Birmingham City in 2002, where he spent the next eight seasons and became the club&#x27;s captain. Johnson was transferred to Plymouth Argyle in 2010, spent the 2010–11 and 2011–12 season on loan to Huddersfield Town, and finished his playing career with Fleetwood Town in 2012–13.

He played for his country at schoolboy and youth levels before representing the Northern Ireland senior team over an eleven-year period, earning 56 caps.

==Club career==

===Blackburn Rovers===
His first English team was Blackburn Rovers, for whom Johnson signed as a trainee, from Portadown in 1997, making his debut in the League Cup on 30 September 1997, a 1–0 defeat to Preston North End, in which he picked up a yellow card.

Loaned to Nottingham Forest on 28 January 1998, Johnson played in five games, and, despite accruing a yellow card in his last February appearance, performed well for the team.

Blackburn won the 2002 League Cup final a few days before Johnson left the club. Despite not being part of the squad for the final Johnson had contributed to a few games earlier in the cup run, including scoring a goal against Manchester City.

===Birmingham City===
Having dropped down the pecking order at Blackburn and out of contract at the end of the season, Johnson signed for Championship club Birmingham City on 8 March 2002. The fee was officially undisclosed, but later reported on Birmingham&#x27;s website as £50,000.

In September 2004, he signed a new three-year contract. He was voted Birmingham&#x27;s Player of the Year for 2005–06.

Johnson was named the Birmingham City captain for the 2006–07 season but in one of his first games as captain, he angered fans when he first threw his captain&#x27;s armband and then his shirt on the floor when he was substituted late on. On 28 October, his jaw was broken in two places after he was elbowed in the face by West Bromwich Albion defender Paul Robinson. Despite the injury, he played on for the remaining 10 minutes of the match. He signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract in December, to run until the end of the 2009–10 season.

At the opening of the 2007–08 season Johnson injured a hamstring in a pre-season friendly. Further injuries followed, and he did not make his first league appearance of the season until 15 December, replacing the suspended Mehdi Nafti.

In all Johnson made 216 appearances for Birmingham City, with 150 of those in the Premier League.

===Plymouth Argyle===
Johnson joined Championship club Plymouth Argyle on a free transfer on 1 February 2010, signing a two-and-a-half-year contract. Birmingham manager Alex McLeish described him as &quot;always a terrier of a player [who] gave us fantastic commitment ... and played a significant part in us returning to the Premier League&quot;, and wished him all the best.

He scored his first goal for Argyle in his fourth appearance, on 16 February against Swansea City, and finished the season with two goals from 20 league matches.

===Huddersfield Town===

====2010–11 season====
On 5 August 2010, he joined Huddersfield Town on a season-long loan deal with a view to a permanent move. He made his Terriers debut two days later as a late substitute in the 3–0 win over Notts County at Meadow Lane. In December 2010, he suffered a cruciate ligament injury against Brighton which ruled him out for the remainder of the season. Johnson remained at the club until the end of the season to complete his rehabilitation and was nominated for the Player of the Year award. In all, he made 23 appearances.

====2011–12 season====
The club confirmed on 18 July 2011 that he was set to sign on another season-long loan deal, which was confirmed the next day. His second debut for the Terriers came in the 3–0 win against Sheffield United at Brammall Lane on 13 September 2011.

===Fleetwood Town===
On 7 June 2012, Johnson joined newly promoted League Two club Fleetwood Town. Just over a year later, on 9 October 2013, Johnson left the club by mutual consent.

==International career==
Johnson earned his first Northern Ireland call up on 29 May 1999, when he came on as a substitute in the 1–0 away win against the Republic of Ireland. Further appearances as substitute followed against Finland, Luxembourg, Malta, and Hungary, before he made his first full appearance versus Yugoslavia at Windsor Park, Belfast, in August 2000.

After a period when his international appearances were restricted by serious injury, Johnson made his 49th appearance for NI in the 3–0 World Cup Qualifying victory in San Marino on 11 February 2009, when he was the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Man of the Match&quot;.

On 29 July 2010, Johnson announced his retirement from international football after making 56 appearances for the team.

==Coaching career==

Following his retirement from football, Johnson went into coaching, completing his coaching qualifications and gaining experience assisting at various clubs including Everton.

===Blackburn Rovers===
In April 2015, Johnson returned to Blackburn Rovers, the club at which he began his English career, as U14 academy coach. After three months he was appointed U21 lead coach, a post which was redesignated professional development phase lead coach when the development squad began to compete at under-23 level. In July 2019 he was promoted to first team technical coach &amp; head of player development, a post he still held .

In July 2020, Northern Ireland manager Ian Baraclough added Johnson to his coaching team in addition to his duties at Blackburn, but Johnson gave up the role within a year for personal reasons. In February 2024, he and fellow coach David Lowe took temporary charge of Blackburn for their 3–1 Championship win over Stoke City while waiting for new manager John Eustace to take over formally.

<doc id="1339767" wikidata="Q2367685" url="?curid=1339767" title="What Goes On (Beatles song)">
<text>&quot;What Goes On&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, featured as the eighth track on their 1965 album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. The song was later released as the B-side of the US single &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, and then as the tenth track on the North America-only album &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;. It is the only song by the band credited to Lennon–McCartney–Starkey and the only song on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; that features Ringo Starr on lead vocals. The song reached number 81 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1966.

==Composition==
John Lennon wrote the song in early 1959, likely at 251 Menlove Avenue. The early version of the song is heavily inspired by Buddy Holly, and differed substantially from the &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; version with only the chorus being the same.

The Beatles nearly recorded the song in March 1963, but ultimately did not do so until November 1965 for &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. According to Lennon, &quot;it was resurrected with a middle eight thrown in, probably with Paul [McCartney]&#x27;s help&quot;. Barry Miles also claimed that McCartney and Starr combined for the middle eight. There is no formal middle eight in the song, although one chorus and one verse are extended; Musicologist and writer Ian MacDonald believes those longer sections were written by McCartney. Starr contributed to the lyrics, his first-ever composing credit on a Beatles song. When asked about his contribution Starr jokingly responded, &quot;[I wrote] about five words to &#x27;What Goes On&#x27; and I haven&#x27;t done a thing since.&quot; MacDonald and musicologist Walter Everett write that Starr&#x27;s contribution was the lyric &quot;Waiting for the tides of time&quot;. MacDonald calls these lines, &quot;pseudo-&quot;. The first pressing of the single accidentally omitted &quot;Starkey&quot; in the songwriting credit.

==Recording==
===&quot;From Me to You&quot; session, 1963===
On 5 March 1963, during a session for &quot;From Me To You&quot; and &quot;Thank You Girl&quot;, the Beatles wanted to record &quot;What Goes On&quot; and &quot;One After 909&quot; (then titled &quot;The One After 909&quot;). With only enough time remaining to record one more song, they opted for &quot;The One After 909&quot;. John Lennon and Paul McCartney recorded a demo of this version in 1963, but the song was not used until 1965 as Ringo Starr&#x27;s vocal piece for &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.

===&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; sessions, 1965===

Neil Aspinall recalls that McCartney made a multitrack home demo of the song in 1965: &quot;When Paul wanted to show Ringo how &#x27;What Goes On&#x27; sounded he made up a multi-track tape. Onto this went Paul singing, Paul playing lead guitar, Paul playing bass and Paul playing drums. Then Ringo listened to the finished tape and added his own ideas before the recording session.&quot;
The &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; version was recorded in one take, with overdubs, during a late-night session on 4 November 1965. George Martin produced, supported by engineers Norman Smith, Ken Scott and Graham Platt. Everett writes that Lennon&#x27;s guitar part is in the style of Steve Cropper and his &quot;Memphis &#x27;chick&#x27; rhythm part.&quot; He adds that George Harrison includes &quot;rockabilly string crossings, double-stops, and portamento neighbors.&quot; Starr likely recorded a guide vocal on the basic track, wiped over by his final vocal overdub. The original guide vocal can be heard through the drum mike during Starr&#x27;s solo and during the coda. As well, during the verse before the lead break after Starr sings &quot;tell me why,&quot; Lennon says, &quot;We already told you why!&quot;, in reference to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; from &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;.

Martin, assisted by Smith and Jerry Boys, mixed the song for mono and stereo on 9 November 1965. Harrison&#x27;s Gretsch Tennessean guitar is muted during the last two bars of the mono mix. Everett suggests this likely happened because the engineer meant to mute the vocal track but forgot that Harrison&#x27;s guitar was on that track as well.

==Release and reception==
The Beatles released &quot;What Goes On&quot; in both mono and stereo in the U.K. on the 3 December 1965 release &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. Capitol released the song as the B-side to the U.S. only single &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; on 21 February 1966. Despite being the B-side, the song entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for two weeks, reaching #81. Capitol pulled the track from the North American release of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and instead included it on the North American-only album &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;, released 20 June 1966. 

Critics have generally been unfavourable towards the song when comparing it with the others on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. Beatles writer Kenneth Womack asserts that the song is &quot;quite arguably the weakest and most incongruous track on the album.&quot; Professor of English and writer James M. Decker writes the song represents, &quot;a retrograde achievement lyrically,&quot; then adds, &quot;Lyrically formulaic and musically plain (though perhaps the &#x27;country&#x27; feel is offered as an arch parody of the lyrics), &#x27;What Goes On&#x27; anchors the Beatles in the very tradition that they are exploding during many other moments on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.&quot; MacDonald writes the song &quot;has the same sloppy country-and-western ambience as &quot;Act Naturally&quot;. For AllMusic, Richie Unterberger writes the song is an &quot;enjoyable if lightweight&quot; country &amp; western-flavoured entry in the Beatles catalogue. He praises Harrison&#x27;s guitar work, which &quot;again marks him as the finest disciple of Carl Perkins.&quot; Everett describes McCartney&#x27;s bass as &quot;soulful.&quot; He further writes that after &quot;What Goes On&quot;, the Beatles rockabilly style went &quot;into dormancy&quot;.

==Cover versions==
Sufjan Stevens recorded a cover of the song in 2005 for the compilation album, &quot;This Bird Has Flown – A 40th Anniversary Tribute to the Beatles&#x27; Rubber Soul&quot;. In a review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Rob Mitchum writes that Stevens takes Starr&#x27;s &quot;abysmal country tune&quot; and turns it into, &quot;a really good Sufjan Stevens song, arranged for the full Illinoisemaker band with choral interludes, diving strings, and a surprisingly gritty jam.&quot; Barry Walters of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine writes, &quot;Changing chords, rewriting melody, overhauling rhythms and resequencing large chunks of lyrics, the ever-ambitious Sufjan Stevens turns &#x27;What Goes On&#x27; inside out with an intricate stop-and-start arrangement that affirms &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;&#x27;s elastic strength.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was less favourable, describing Stevens track as, &quot;the only severe misstep in an album filled with good, generally pleasant covers.&quot;

==Personnel==
According to Ian MacDonald:
*Ringo Starr lead vocal, drums
*John Lennon harmony vocal, rhythm guitar
*Paul McCartney harmony vocal, bass guitar
*George Harrison lead guitar

<text>Roy Brown Ramírez (born July 18, 1945) is a Puerto Rican musician and singer.

== Early years ==
Brown&#x27;s father was an American naval officer and his mother a native of Puerto Rico. Brown was raised during turbulent times in the United States. Among the important issues of those days were racism, the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War. Most of these events went on to form an important part in his ideals and his way of thinking.

In the late-1960s Brown graduated from Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, later enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico. He enjoyed writing poems and while he was a student, he became actively involved in groups against the Vietnam War, poor living conditions, and especially in favor of the independence movement of Puerto Rico. Brown was also involved in the student disturbances which spread throughout the university, by participating in the protest and picket lines.

== First Recordings ==
During this period he recorded two albums, &quot;Yo Protesto&quot; (1970) and &quot;Basta Ya... Revolución&quot;. During that decade he also recorded: &quot;Roy Brown III&quot;, &quot;La Profecía de Urayoán&quot; and &quot;Distancias&quot;. Brown&#x27;s personal life started to suffer because of his political beliefs. He got into trouble with the police, his father and brother didn&#x27;t want anything to do with him and he was fired from his job in the university. His mother was also dying.

In the late-1970s, Brown moved to New York City and formed a group called Aires Bucaneros, with fellow musicians Zoraida Santiago, Carl Royce, Pablo Nieves, and Rucco Gandía, among others. The group traveled and performed in many countries such as Greece, Germany, Spain, Mexico, Ecuador, Cuba, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. He recorded &quot;Aires Bucaneros&quot; (1979), &quot;Casi Alba&quot; (1980), &quot;Nuyol&quot; (1983), &quot;Árboles&quot; (1987) and &quot;Balada de Otro Tiempo&quot; (1989). &quot;Arboles&quot; was produced by Silvio Rodríguez, in Cuba.

== Return To Puerto Rico ==
In 1988, Brown returned to Puerto Rico and held a concert at the University of Puerto Rico which completely sold out. The first time he held a concert alone at the same place in the 1970s, only thirteen people showed up.

Among Brown&#x27;s recordings in the 1990s were: &quot;Distancias en Vivo&quot; (1990), &quot;Nocturno&quot; (1991), &quot;Poetas Puertorriqueños&quot; (1992), and &quot;En Fuga&quot; (1995). In 1996, he released a two-disc album called &quot;Colección&quot; (1996) containing the best of his musical trajectory through the Puerto Rican music scene. In 1997, Silvio Rodríguez visited Puerto Rico and held a concert with Brown at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium, with a soldout audience of 19,000 people.

==Recording with Zoraida Santiago==
In 2000 Brown reunited with his Aires Bucaneros partner, Zoraida Santiago. Together they released the album, &quot;Bohemia&quot;. Showing signs of musical growth, Roy continued to release quality albums in the late-1990s and early-2000s with &quot;Poeta en San Juan&quot; (1999), &quot;Noche de Roy Brown&quot; (1999), &quot;Album&quot; (2000) and &quot;Balcon del Fin del Mundo&quot; (2004).

On June 7, 2003, Brown let WPKN FM of Bridgeport, Connecticut record his set in the historic Plaza de la Revolución in Lares, Puerto Rico. WPKN also recorded Roy&#x27;s &quot;Ofelia&quot; live from the Nuyorican Cafe in Old San Juan. On February 8, 2004, Brown held a concert in the Antonio Paoli Hall at the Luis A. Ferré Center of the Fine Arts in San Juan to celebrate his 35 years of music trajectory and the shows were all sold-out. Brown performs regularly in the Claridad festival, honoring Claridad, a Puerto Rican newspaper which advocates independence. Joan Manuel Serrat, Susana Baca, Fiel a la Vega, Cultura Profética, Celia Cruz and Lucecita Benítez are among the many artists that have recorded songs written by Roy Brown Ramírez.

==Recent events==
In 2006 Brown recorded an album, titled &quot;Que Vaya Bien&quot;, with Tao Rodríguez-Seeger from The Mammals and Tito Auger, the frontman for Puerto Rican rock group Fiel A La Vega. A single from this record, &quot;El Banquete de Los Sánchez&quot; (whose lyrics were based on an essay by Puerto Rican writer Luis Rafael Sánchez), was censored by some Puerto Rican radio stations due to the use of the slang term &quot;chicho&quot; (a love handle in Puerto Rican Spanish, but erroneously interpreted in this case as a verb tense for the slang term for sexual intercourse, &quot;chichar&quot;). Public backlash against the censorship attempt guaranteed radio airplay and good sales for the record (reportedly 30,000 copies in two months) during late 2006. After marrying Puerto Rican former tennis player Emilie Viqueira, Brown moved to Mayagüez, Puerto Rico (Viqueira&#x27;s birthplace), where he currently resides.

<doc id="1339803" wikidata="Q7337587" url="?curid=1339803" title="River Line (Conrail)">
<text>The River Line was a Conrail rail line located between Jersey City, New Jersey and Selkirk, New York, United States. It ran along the west side of the Hudson Palisades and, after passing through a tunnel at Haverstraw, New York, along the west bank of the Hudson River. It was previously the New York Central&#x27;s West Shore Railroad and Weehawken Branch. The River Line has since been split into several sections, following the 1999 division of Conrail assets between Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation.

The majority of the line is now the CSX River Subdivision, which runs from Control Point 2 (CP2) at the North Bergen Yard in North Bergen, New Jersey to Selkirk. The portion south of CP2, including the Weehawken Tunnel, is now part of NJ Transit&#x27;s Hudson–Bergen Light Rail. Freight trains continuing south of CP2 now use the Northern Running Track, a portion of a former Erie Railroad line that has been upgraded to handle the traffic. At Selkirk, the River Subdivision ends at the Castleton Subdivision, with the Port Subdivision continuing towards Albany. The Castleton Sub was built in 1924 as part of a bypass for through freight trains around Albany.

==Conrail&#x27;s defunct River Line and Weehawken Branch==

The River Line began at CP Waldo, at a junction with the Passaic and Harsimus Line (P&amp;H). The P&amp;H Line runs west through what was the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Bergen Hill Cut, just north of PATH, through a re-aligned Marion Junction.

At CP Nave, the River Line junctioned with the National Docks Secondary, which still runs south on the east side of the Hudson Palisades, with the Nave-Croxton Running Track running west through the old Erie Railroad&#x27;s Long Dock Tunnel. The junction only allowed trains coming to/from the south on the National Docks to continue to/from the north on the River Line.

North of CP Nave, the River Line entered Hoboken; it is now used for the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail (HBLR) north of this point. The HBLR runs around the west and north sides of Hoboken and into Weehawken, where it turns west through a tunnel to CSX&#x27;s North Bergen Yard, originally part of the New York Central&#x27;s West Shore Railroad.

From that point north, the River Line is still in use, but as CSX as the River Subdivision, north toward Albany, New York.

The Weehawken Branch was just east of the River Line, from somewhere in Jersey City north of CP Nave to Baldwin Avenue in Weehawken. It was operated by Conrail as a second track of the River Line.

The River Line was abandoned east and south of the Tonnelle Avenue overpass at the North Bergen yard. The short connection between the National Docks Secondary and the River Line was also abandoned, as was the Weehawken Branch.

===History===
The first bit of the River Line, splitting from the P&amp;H Line and passing over the National Docks, was built fairly-recently as a connecting track. North of there, the line was the New Jersey Junction Railroad to the Weehawken tunnel. Through the tunnel, it was the West Shore Railroad. Both of these lines were owned by the New York Central Railroad.

The Weehawken Branch was built and owned by the Erie Railroad. It originally passed through the middle of Hoboken, but was later realigned to the west side, right next to the New Jersey Junction Railroad.

<doc id="1339809" wikidata="Q3190585" url="?curid=1339809" title="6 Underground (song)">
<text>&quot;6 Underground&quot; is a song by the English band Sneaker Pimps from their debut studio album, &quot;Becoming X&quot; (1996). First released as a single in the United Kingdom in September 1996 by Clean-up Records, the song reached number 15 on the UK Singles Chart and had moderate radio airplay in the United States, where it was shipped to modern rock and dance stations in February 1997. After the song was used in the 1997 American film &quot;The Saint&quot;, radio stations began playing &quot;6 Underground&quot; more frequently. The single was re-released in May 1997, when it peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart. In the United States, the song peaked at number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart.

Both the song and the music video, directed by Toby Tremlett, feature Kelli Dayton (later known as Kelli Ali), the band&#x27;s lead singer at the time.

The cover artwork of the single uses a photograph of a Lego Space moonscape. The piece is from the Command Centre playset marketed by The Lego Group from 1978 to 1988. After the commercial success and popularity of the album version of the song, the group released several remixes, some of which became hits in dance clubs and radio stations with a dance format. The most popular version was the remix by Nellee Hooper (which appeared as a hidden track on the album and was depicted in the music video).

==Composition==
The horns and the harp melody at the beginning of the song are both sampled from &quot;Golden Girl&quot;, a track from the 1964 James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (the song plays during a scene when Bond discovers Jill Masterson covered in gold paint). The &quot;a-one two&quot; heard repeatedly in the Nellee Hooper version is sampled from De La Soul&#x27;s song &quot;Breakadawn&quot;.

Chris Corner said, &quot;It&#x27;s about death in a small town environment. You grow up in this shit town and you yearn to get out. A lot of artists, we just can&#x27;t survive in a place like that. So, the essence of that song is that living in a small town is like dying. For us it was a huge release to get out and to explore the world, to see what everything else is about. We all wanted that. You know, the northern industrial shithole. And that&#x27;s really what that song&#x27;s about.&quot;

==Critical reception==
In his review of the song, Simon Price from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote, &quot;Cliche of the year. Post-Portishead, post-Garbage. Girl singer. Polite trip hop and gentle junglism. Lamb. Moloko. Sneaker Pimps. The Stone Temple Pilots of The Bristol Sound, basically.&quot; In December 1996, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; ranked &quot;6 Underground&quot; number 30 in their list of &quot;Singles of the Year&quot;, adding, &quot;Smokier than Bill Hicks&#x27; bedroom, snakier than a python on a hairpin bend, a prime slice of easy sleaze that proved t**p h*p needn&#x27;t be two dirty words.&quot; In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it number 48 in their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Pop Songs of 1997&quot;, writing, &quot;Thank God for Nellee Hooper, the script doctor of &#x27;90s U.K. electronic pop, who stepped in to take the Sneaker Pimps&#x27; signature single to the next level — without him, there&#x27;s no sticky &quot;Uh, one, two&quot; hook making an already captivating trip-hop ballad absolutely unshakeable.&quot;

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;6 Underground&quot; was directed by Toby Tremlett, and made its debut on 14 January 1997. It uses the &quot;Nellee Hooper edit&quot; of the song. Throughout the video, which gives off a dark atmosphere, the camera focuses on Kelli Dayton singing in the middle of a dark room sitting in a dentist chair that she spins around. The camera follows Dayton as she slowly walks around the darkened room singing the song. There are also several smaller lit rooms with oval windows within the larger dark room, depicting different scenes such as a man dressed in black practicing various poses, a woman dressed in a nightgown who is vacuuming the floor, a young woman posing around a chair in a red tie shirt and black skirt, a toddler dressed in a costume pouring spaghetti from a jar and tossing it around the room, and an overweight man eating spaghetti while sitting in a recliner. The small rooms with the oval windows could depict a view into people&#x27;s private lives, and even a view into their souls. A can of worms is poured out by a band member. The other band members are usually seen lurking behind Dayton in this video, including in some scenes where the band is standing in one of the small, brightly lit rooms. At the end of the video, the people in the smaller rooms seem to freeze in place, and in the big room, the band poses at Dayton&#x27;s dentist chair, and then the lights go out.

<doc id="1339815" wikidata="Q1251875" url="?curid=1339815" title="Doug Stanhope">
<text>Doug Stanhope (born March 25, 1967) is an American stand-up comedian, author, actor, political activist and podcast host. His stand-up material favors caustic and often obscene observations of life in the style of Bill Hicks, which he delivers while consuming alcohol. Politically, he has favored libertarianism and once endorsed the Free State Project, a proposed political migration of at least 20,000 libertarians to a single low-population state to foster libertarian ideas.

==Early life==
Stanhope was born in Worcester, Massachusetts. His mother Bonnie was a waitress and his father Russ was head of the science department at Stanhope&#x27;s school. Bonnie quit drinking and divorced her husband when Stanhope was ten years old, and moved to Florida. Stanhope and his older brother Jeff lived with Russ.

In 1998, he persuaded Bonnie to live near him in West Hollywood, California. Later, she suffered from emphysema. In 2008, at her request, she wished for Stanhope to be involved in an assisted suicide with a mixture of cocktails and prescription morphine. Stanhope waited until the statute of limitations had expired for the ensuing credit card fraud before telling the story in his stand-up act and his second book.

At age 12, Stanhope&#x27;s school psychiatrist wrote a letter to his mother detailing his concern with Stanhope&#x27;s tendency to sketch gory images and adult-themed cartoons, suggesting he was &quot;in need of professional help&quot;. Stanhope quit school at fifteen. Among his early comedy influences were Monty Python and National Lampoon. Before he started comedy full-time, Stanhope worked in telemarketing, &quot;borderline legal stuff, trying to scam people basically&quot;.

Eventually Stanhope left Worcester and lived in Los Angeles for six months. Following this he moved around from Florida, back to Massachusetts, to Oceanside, California, back to Massachusetts again, to Idaho, before settling in Las Vegas. He now lives in Bisbee, Arizona.

==Career==
===1990s===
Stanhope began his stand-up comedy career in 1990 at age 23, first performing at an open mic night at a Las Vegas bar. He developed his act in Las Vegas before moving to Phoenix, Arizona, where he landed a gig as a house MC at a comedy club.

In 1995, he settled in West Hollywood which he &quot;hated [...] so much&quot; partly due to the slump in comedy acts at the time. Among his regular spots were the Hollywood Improv or The Comedy Store, before he became based in Playa del Rey and worked in clubs outside the city center. Around this time, he landed a development deal and &quot;flirted&quot; with the idea of producing a sitcom by co-writing a pilot episode with a writer of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. He later described the script as a &quot;piece of shit&quot;, and felt thankful it was never picked up. In 1995, Stanhope won the San Francisco International Comedy Competition against Dane Cook in a three-week contest.

===2000s===
In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in New York City, Stanhope received some criticism from audiences over his comments regarding the event. This included protests outside of his gigs and attacks on stage.

In July 2002, Fox aired back-to-back episodes of Stanhope&#x27;s hidden camera television show &quot;Invasion of the Hidden Cameras&quot;. The project began in 1999, with Stanhope writing and producing various pranks for it, before the network decided to withdraw its broadcast. Stanhope accused &quot;Spy TV&quot; of stealing half of his ideas and achieving good ratings as a result. He starred as one of the pranksters on &quot;Spy TV&quot;.

In August 2002, Stanhope won the Strathmore Press Award for his week-long run at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, as voted by 40 press critics. The prize was £1,000 and a feature in the British celebrity magazine &quot;OK!&quot;. Following the run, Stanhope signed with his longtime manager Brian Hennigan.

In 2003 and 2004, Stanhope co-hosted the fifth and sixth seasons of &quot;The Man Show&quot; with Joe Rogan. He agreed to the project in order to become more financially stable. Among the show&#x27;s segments included Stanhope lasting five rounds in a boxing match with Tonya Harding in which the Stanhope lost by decision, and his mother reviewing pornographic films. He hosted his own radio show on SIRIUS Satellite Radio in 2005. That year, Stanhope hosted &quot;Girls Gone Wild: America Uncovered&quot;.

In 2005, Stanhope moved to Bisbee, Arizona.

He appeared in the film &quot;The Aristocrats&quot;, telling a caustic joke to a baby.

Stanhope established a group of touring comics known as &quot;The Unbookables&quot; featuring such artists as Andy Andrist, and Brendon Walsh, among others. The Unbookables&#x27; first CD, &quot;Morbid Obscenity&quot;, was released in 2006.

In June 2006, Stanhope was booked to perform several shows at the Cat Laughs Comedy Festival in Kilkenny, Ireland. However, roughly ten minutes into his set, a joke about Irish men committing pedophilia because of the ugliness of Irish women caused a hostile reaction from the audience. The incident led to the cancellation of Stanhope&#x27;s remaining appearances at the festival. That August, he returned to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, agreeing to a full three-week residency. At one show, one of his routines sparked a violent affray with an angered audience member and the police were called in, causing Stanhope to leave the venue. He gained 5-star reviews from the press. On his opening night he took what was believed to be an ecstasy tablet that was handed to him by a member of the audience. At the 2008 Fringe, Stanhope announced A Day with Doug, an opportunity to spend an entire day with him for £7,349, the average amount that comedians lose when they are booked at one of the four biggest venues at the festival.

Stanhope announced his intention to seek election as the United States President in the 2008 election on the Libertarian Party ticket. He added: &quot;It seemed like a funny thing to do [...] But people were either amused or horrified at the idea of me representing their party&quot;. His focus was for &quot;individual freedom, self-government and making America fun again&quot;.

His live show was placed in the top 5 of the &quot;20 Best Live Shows of 2009&quot; by London&#x27;s &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper.

Stanhope&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;From Across The Street&quot;, was released on November 24, 2009.

===2010s===
In 2010, Stanhope recorded a series of vignettes for the British news show &quot;Newswipe with Charlie Brooker&quot;. In 2013, he did the same during &quot;Charlie Brooker&#x27;s Weekly Wipe&quot; as &quot;the voice of America&quot;. On November 17, 2010, Stanhope signed to rock and metal label Roadrunner Records to launch their new comedy label, Roadrunner Comedy. On May 3, 2011, the album was released: &quot;&quot;. This was supported with an international tour, which included a 25-night residency at the Leicester Square Theatre in London. By this time, Stanhope had won &quot;Time Out New York&quot; Best Comedy Performance award twice.

In 2011, in co-operation with the mayor of Reykjavík and comedian Jón Gnarr, Stanhope scheduled a performance in Iceland&#x27;s only maximum security prison, Litla-Hraun. The show took place on September 25. Also in 2011, Stanhope appeared on the FX series &quot;Louie&quot; as Eddie Mack, a comedian that Louis C.K. knew 20 years earlier when they first started performing, in the season 2 episode entitled &quot;Eddie&quot;, first aired on August 11, 2011. He spoke of his role: &quot;I tried to beg out of it. I said, I suck at acting. He had to talk me into trying&quot;, and auditioned online through Skype.

In 2012, Stanhope released his comedy special &quot;Before Turning the Gun on Himself&quot;, recorded in Salt Lake City. He took the show&#x27;s name from a phrase that he noted was commonly used on online news articles. Also in 2012, he impersonated John Lydon in a pre-taped radio interview with Mike Ragogna after the studio mistakenly called his number thinking it was Lydon&#x27;s.

On February 16, 2013, Stanhope debuted &quot;The Doug Stanhope Podcast&quot;, recorded out of his home in Bisbee, Arizona. In 2014, it was hosted by the All Things Comedy network.

In May 2013, an appeal initiated by Stanhope raised nearly $126,000 for Rebecca Vitsmun and her family whose home was destroyed by the 2013 tornado in Moore, Oklahoma. He said he did so in support of her declared atheism, saying he admired her courage in a predominantly Christian state.

In 2014, Stanhope announced on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; that he was working with Johnny Depp on a show. According to Stanhope, Depp befriended him in Europe and had an unknown project in mind for him. He had a supporting role in the 2014 Chris Rock film &quot;Top Five&quot;, playing a police officer.

Stanhope appeared on &quot;Bar Rescue&quot; as Jon Taffer&#x27;s guest to watch the recon of the Pomona, California, bar Friar Tucks in an episode called &quot;Storming the Castle&quot;.

In May 2015, Stanhope announced that he was writing a book about his life with his mother, an occasional subject in his comedy. The book, entitled &quot;Digging Up Mother: A Love Story&quot;, was released on May 10, 2016, and includes a foreword by Johnny Depp.

Stanhope filmed his comedy special &quot;No Place Like Home&quot; on November 21, 2015, at the Bisbee Royale in Bisbee. The film was produced by Johnny Depp.

In June 2016, actress Amber Heard sued Stanhope for his &quot;defamatory&quot; claim that she was blackmailing her ex-husband Johnny Depp. Heard dropped the lawsuit in the aftermath of her and Depp&#x27;s $7 million divorce settlement.

In 2017, Stanhope released his third book, &quot;This is Not Fame&quot;. It is a collection of stories about being an infamous comedian.

===2020s===
In 2020, Stanhope released his special, &quot;The Dying of a Last Breed&quot;, which was filmed at the Plaza Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. He also released his fourth book, &quot;No Encore for the Donkey&quot;.

In 2022, he announced a fall/autumn tour of the US and UK &amp; Ireland.

In 2023, Stanhope produced and starred in &quot;The Road Dog&quot; with his former partner Khrystyne Haje.

In 2024, Stanhope joined fellow comedians Brendon Walsh and Sean Green to launch the Get to the Points Podcast on Green&#x27;s Sports Gambling Podcast Network.

==Political activism==
Although Stanhope&#x27;s views have led people to believe that he is a liberal, he does not accept this characterization. Stanhope says that libertarianism was a phase he went through, but described himself as an anarchist in 2017.

In 2004, he endorsed the Free State Project, a proposed political migration of at least 20,000 libertarians to a single low-population state, in order to make the state a stronghold for libertarian ideas. According to Stanhope this is an idea &quot;that could produce tangible change in our lifetime.&quot;

In 2012, Stanhope originally supported Republican Ron Paul for the 2012 presidential election, but later endorsed Libertarian Gary Johnson.

In 2013, Stanhope appeared at a Bisbee, Arizona City Council Meeting to express his support for civil unions between gay couples following reports that local churches were planning to bus in local members to filibuster the vote. He stated &quot;I am not gay and I think marriage is stupid. I have no dog in this fight except human equality.&quot; The meeting started with a prayer led by a local preacher and Stanhope&#x27;s speech mentioned this, stating &quot;I thought it was absolutely abhorrent that this would open with a preacher preaching Jesus in a city function. I am shaking with rage...&quot; The measure to allow civil unions eventually passed with a 5–2 vote.

==Personal life==
In 2002, Stanhope and his girlfriend Renee Morrison staged a fake marriage ceremony in Las Vegas. He later said that it was &quot;mocking the institution of marriage&quot;, and that it was not legitimate. At one point, the two were expecting a child but opted for abortion, and Stanhope got a vasectomy. Stanhope dated comedian and former attorney Betsy Wise for 18 months. Around 2005 Stanhope met his current partner Amy &quot;Bingo&quot; Bingaman, who he has referred to as his girlfriend and wife, and they reside in Bisbee, Arizona. Stanhope is opposed to having children and cites overpopulation as a reason.

Stanhope is known for his heavy alcohol consumption and is a self-confessed drunk. In a 2011 interview, he said the last time he was sober on stage was in 2003. He is also known for dressing in thrift store clothing.

He describes himself as pro-choice and pro-drug. In an interview with PETA, Stanhope criticized the use of wild animals for entertainment purposes as well as the fur trade. He is an atheist and raised $125,000 for a 2013 Moore tornado victim who declared herself a non-believer on TV.

<doc id="1339822" wikidata="Q4860040" url="?curid=1339822" title="Bard High School Early College">
<text>Bard High School Early College (BHSEC) is a series of early college schools with multiple campuses in the United States, enrolling approximately 3,000 students across all campuses. The schools allow students to begin their college studies two years early, graduating with a Bard College Associate in Arts degree in addition to their high school diploma. Students complete their high school studies in the ninth and tenth grade, after which they begin taking credit-bearing college courses under the same roof. Unlike some dual-enrollment programs, students stay on the same campus for all four years, and both high school- and college-level courses are taught by the same faculty. Teachers at the Bard High School Early Colleges are both certified public school teachers as well as experienced academic scholars, often holding terminal degrees in their areas of study.

The first campus, Bard High School Early College Manhattan, opened in New York City in 2001 as a partnership between Bard College and various local public school systems. There are now eight Bard High School Early College campuses across the country. 

The Bard High School Early Colleges are part of a larger network of early college programs run by Bard College, called the Bard Early Colleges, which also include half-day programs in New Orleans, Louisiana; in partnership with the Harlem Children&#x27;s Zone in New York City; and in Hudson, New York.

==Admissions==
Applicants must maintain a B letter grade of 85 percent or higher to be considered. Bard has its own academic standards, and if a student meets them, they will be called to a one-on-one interview. In advance of their opening in the Bronx, the school&#x27;s admissions and diversity practices were called into question. This had been an issue in D.C., including addressing the city&#x27;s brain drain.

==History==
Founded in 2001 as a partnership of the New York City Department of Education and Bard College and funded in part by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bard High School Early College Manhattan was the first public Bard Early College with other foundations following. But the early college model and many of the teaching philosophies employed at the Bard Early Colleges were primarily developed at Bard College at Simon&#x27;s Rock, the oldest early college entrance program and only accredited four-year early college to date.

BHSEC Manhattan was the first school in the Gates Foundation&#x27;s Early College High School Initiative, which aims to improve education in the U.S. by introducing smaller public high schools that help remove barriers to college education by offering students a college education in a high school setting.

As of 2023, over 4,000 A.A. degrees have been awarded at BHSEC campuses. The schools have a 98% high school graduation rate and a 95% A.A. degree attainment rate. Many BHSEC graduates transfer their 60+ college credits to another college or university and finish their Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in two more years; others opt to study for three or four years in their subsequent institutions. 

==School structure==
By the end of their time at a BHSEC program, students have the ability to earn up to 60 Bard College credits.

===High school (9th &amp; 10th grades)===
In the BHSEC program, students spend what is traditionally ninth and tenth grade finishing the bulk of their high school work. Students are encouraged to take all required state testing by the end of 10th grade, when possible – in New York City, students take the five Regents exams required for the High School Regents diploma, which they receive in addition to the Associates of Arts degree from Bard College. 

===Early College Program (11th &amp; 12th grades)===
The two years spent in the college program are called &quot;Year 1&quot; and &quot;Year 2&quot;. As a college program, students may select their courses based primarily on their academic interests and preferences for certain professors, but they must also meet the college program&#x27;s core requirements.

==Recognition==
In 2009, President Barack Obama singled out BHSEC as the model for the future in his Centennial Speech to the NAACP:

We also have to explore innovative approaches such as those being pursued here in New York City; innovations like Bard High School Early College and Medgar Evers College Preparatory School that are challenging students to complete high school and earn a free associate&#x27;s degree or college credit in just four years.

<text>Mathew John Sadler (born 26 February 1985) is an English former professional footballer who is currently head coach of Walsall.

He played as a left-footed defender, capable of playing either at full-back or as a centre-back.

Sadler played in the Premier League and the Football League for Birmingham City. He spent most of his career in the Football League, for Northampton Town, Watford, Stockport County, Shrewsbury Town, Walsall, Crawley Town, Rotherham United and Oldham Athletic.

==Club career==
===Birmingham City===
Sadler was born in Birmingham, West Midlands. He began his career as a junior with Birmingham City. He made his first team debut on 2 October 2002 in a League Cup second round tie away at Leyton Orient, starting in the 3–2 win at Brisbane Road. A month later, he made his Premier League debut in a 3–1 home win over Bolton Wanderers, again as a starter.

On 21 November 2003, having not played for Birmingham that season, Sadler went on a two-month loan to Northampton Town, playing eight games, seven of which in the Third Division. In May 2004, signed a new contract to keep him at Birmingham. However, Sadler suffered ankle and foot problems.

On 7 February 2006, having not played for Birmingham since 28 December 2002 nor any team since 10 January 2004, Sadler made his return in a 2–1 home win over Reading in an FA Cup fourth round replay, coming on for Mathew Birley after 59 minutes. This was his only appearance until 1 April when he was in the first team to play Chelsea at home, a goalless draw. He stayed in the starting line-up for the remaining games, as the season ended with relegation. At the end of the 2005–06 season, Sadler was awarded the Radio WM Breakthrough Award at the club&#x27;s annual dinner. He also signed a two–year contract with the club.

In the 2006–07 season, Sadler began to be first team regular in the left-back position. However, Sadler suffered a groin injury in training, resulting him missing out for four matches. Sadler then made his return to the first team on 30 September 2006, playing 90 minutes, in a 1–1 draw against Leicester City. Sadler played a role in a match against Coventry City on 31 October 2006 when he provided assist for Nicklas Bendtner to score the only goal of the game with a win. After this, Sadler continued to be a first team regular in the left-back position for the remainder of the season until he was dropped from the first team ahead of the match in favour of Stephen Kelly against Barnsley on 9 April 2007. Manager Steve Bruce explained his decision to leave out Sadler of the squad. As a result, Sadler never played again for the remainder of the 2006–07 season, as Birmingham City were promoted back to the Premier League. Despite this, Sadler made thirty–six appearances. Nevertheless, Sadler then signed a three–year contract with the club, keeping him until 2010.

In the 2007–08 season saw Sadler suffered a knock and Achilles problem at the start of the season. After missing out the first two matches, Sadler made his first appearance of 2007–08 when he came on as a substitute for Fabrice Muamba in the 80th minute, in a 1–0 loss against West Ham United on 18 August 2007. Sadler then provided assist for Garry O&#x27;Connor in the 27th minute, in the first round of the League Cup, in a 2–1 win over Hereford United on 28 August 2007. However, Sadler struggled for the first team place after losing his left-back position to Franck Queudrue and Liam Ridgewell. As a result, Sadler was sent to play in the reserve. But in December, Sadler returned to the first team in the left-back position in his first league appearance since December, in a 2–1 loss against Newcastle United on 8 December 2007. However, on his next appearance against Reading, Sadler came under criticism when his back-pass short led to goalkeeper Maik Taylor brought down Stephen Hunt in the penalty box, leading Hunt to take the penalty himself and converted the penalty successfully. After the match, Taylor defended Sadler, stating he could one day bounce back.

After appearing one more appearance, Sadler was left out of the squad once again and attracted interests from clubs around England. Upon joining Watford, Sadler said it was an honour to play for Birmingham City, the team he grew up supporting, and regretted not playing enough games for the club.

===Watford===
Sadler joined Watford on 24 January 2008 for an initial fee of £750,000, rising to £900,000 depending on appearances. He signed a three-and-a-half-year contract.

Sadler made his Watford debut on 29 January 2008, making his first start for the club, in a 1–1 draw against Sheffield United. Despite the injury, Sadler was the regular in the first team for the remainder of 2007–08 season, making fifteen appearances.

In the 2008–09 season, Sadler started well, appearing for the first three matches to the start of the season until he suffered a lateral knee ligament injury. After missing out five matches, Sadler regained his first team place and then provided assist for Tamás Priskin to score the first goal of the game, in a 3–0 win over Southampton on 18 October 2008. Sadler, once again, sidelined when he suffered an injury that kept him out throughout November. Following his return, Sadler played against his former club, Birmingham City, on 6 December 2008, which saw Watford lost 3–2. Ahead of the match, Sadler stated he hope the club regain back to the Premier League. Sadler eventually fell from grace at Vicarage Road and made his final appearance for Watford on 26 December 2008 in a 2–4 home defeat to Bristol City. During the match, Sadler came under criticism when he conceded two goals before being substituted at half–time. As a result, Sadler was sent to play for the reserve for the remainder of the season and made fifteen appearances.

In 2009–10 season, Sadler remained on the sidelines. In October 2009, Sadler went on trial at Huddersfield Town Sadler played for the club&#x27;s reserve on 14 October 2009 against Grimsby Town&#x27;s reserve, where he provided assist on one of the goal, with a 3–1 win. However, Huddersfield Town decided against signing Sadler. After this, Sadler appeared seven times as an unused substitute. Sadler then joined Stockport County on loan in January 2010 and remained at Edgeley Park until the end of the League One season. His debut for the club took place on 30 January against Southampton. Sadler became a first team regular for the club, where he made twenty appearances. However, despite Sadler&#x27;s best effort, the club were later relegated to League Two.

Sadler joined League Two club Shrewsbury Town on 7 July 2010 on loan for six months. According to manager Graham Turner, the player seemed reluctant initially to play in the fourth tier of English football but was won over by the club&#x27;s ambition. Sadler made his Shrewsbury Town debut in the opening game of the season, in a 3 – 1 win over Bradford City. In the next game, Sadler played a role for the club when he provided assist for Matt Harrold to score the only goal in the game in a 1–0 win over Macclesfield Town. Since then, Sadler made an impressive display at Shrewsbury Town, having established himself in the first team and expressed interests of extending his loan spell at the club for the remainder of the season. On 6 January 2011 saw Sadler&#x27;s loan spell at Shrewsbury Town extended until the end of the season. During the match against Port Vale on 8 March 2011, Sadler controversially fouled Tom Pope in a penalty box, leading to a penalty kick converted successfully, which resulted a 2–2 draw. Despite this, Sadler went on to be an ever-present player in the League Two season to play every minute of every game for his club. Sadler played in two matches in the play–offs against Torquay United, but lost 2–0 in the first leg and drew 0–0 in the second leg.

At the end of the 2010–11 season, it was announced that Sadler was one of the three players released by the club.

===Walsall===
After a successful loan spell at Shrewsbury Town, Sadler joined Walsall on 27 June 2011 on a one–year contract. He hoped to make a new start after a lack of first-team opportunities at Watford. Sadler made his Walsall debut in the opening game of the season, a 1–0 win over Leyton Orient. Against Hartlepool United seven days later, Walsall took an early lead via Jon Macken&#x27;s penalty after Sadler was fouled; the match ended as a 1–1 draw. A few weeks into the season, manager Dean Smith dubbed him &quot;Mr Reliable&quot;, because &quot;He&#x27;s solid, dependable and gets forward. He knows the game, is intelligent and has a fantastic attitude.&quot;

Against Huddersfield Town on 5 November, Sadler crossed the ball for Jamie Paterson&#x27;s equaliser that ended a three-match losing streak. He was sent off for a second bookable offence against Charlton Athletic on 10 December, so was suspended for the FA Cup second round replay against Dagenham &amp; Redbridge which Walsall lost in a penalty shootout; it would remain the only match he missed all season. Around that time he spoke of how painful he found the team&#x27;s loss of form, which he took personally.

Facing Colchester United on 27 March 2012, in his 193rd league game (222nd in all competitions), Sadler scored his first senior goal, breaking what BBC Sport described as &quot;one of football&#x27;s longer droughts&quot;. The 3–1 win lifted Walsall out of the relegation places, and Florent Cuvelier&#x27;s equaliser against Huddersfield on 28 April from Sadler&#x27;s cross confirmed their safety. Sadler was voted player of the season by his team-mates and finished as runner-up to Andy Butler for the supporters&#x27; Player of the Year award, but despite Butler encouraging him to stay, he rejected Walsall&#x27;s offer of a two-year contract.

===Crawley Town===
On 8 June 2012, Sadler joined newly promoted League One side Crawley Town on a free transfer after turning down a new two–year contract with the club. He cited manager Sean O&#x27;Driscoll&#x27;s winning mentality as the reason he joined.

Sadler made his debut on 14 August, starting in a League Cup match as a left back against Championship side Millwall which ended 2–2, with Crawley winning 4–1 on penalties. Four days later, on 18 August 2012, Sadler made his league debut for Crawley Town, in the opening game of the season, in a 3–0 win over Scunthorpe United. Sadler then scored his first goal for the club on 5 March 2013, in a 1–1 draw against Carlisle United. In his first season at Crawley Town, Sadler went on to be an ever-present player in the League One season to play every minute of every game for his club, as he helped the club finish tenth place.

In the 2013–14 season, Sadler continued to regain his place in the first team, under the new management of Richie Barker. Sadler then score his first Crawley Town goal of the season on 17 August 2013, in a 2–1 loss against Rotherham United. Then on 21 September 2013, Sadler then provided assist for Emile Sinclair, in a 1–1 draw against Colchester United. Sadler made his 200th consecutive league appearance on 12 April 2014 against MK Dons. Like his first season at Crawley, Sadler was, once again, to be an ever-present player in the League One season to play every minute of every game for his club, as he helped the club finish fourteenth place.

At the end of the 2013–14 season, with his contract was about to run out, Sadler was among four players to be offered a new contract. However, due to weeks of delays, the club decided to withdraw the contract offer on Sadler and was released by the club in June. After leaving the club, Sadler was linked with a move to clubs around England and Scotland.

===Rotherham United===
Sadler joined newly promoted Championship side Rotherham United on a free transfer from Crawley Town on 17 June 2014. Upon joining the club, Sadler said he cannot wait to play in the Championship with the Rotherham United side.

After appearing five times in the pre–season friendly matches, it wasn&#x27;t until on 26 August 2014 for Sadler made his Rotherham United debut in the second round of the League Cup, which saw them lost 1–0 against Swansea City. However, this turns out to be his only appearance in the League Cup, before returning to Crawley in September on loan. He was linked with a loan move to Notts County and Crewe Alexandra. Sadler then had a run in the first team, which lead to extending his loan spell for another month. After extending his loan spell, Sadler continued to remain in the first team before returning to his parent club on 13 November 2015.

When his loan expired, he returned to Rotherham, and made no further first-team appearances until joining Oldham Athletic on a month&#x27;s loan in March 2015. Upon joining the club, Sadler was brought by Oldham Athletic as a replacement for Joseph Mills, who suffered a calf–injury. Sadler made his Oldham Athletic debut on 14 March 2015, in a 3–1 loss against Barnsley. Sadler then provided assist for Conor Wilkinson on 21 March 2015, to score the only goal in the game in a 1–0 win over Crewe Alexandra, to end the club&#x27;s three match losing streak. After making eight appearances for the club, Sadler returned to his parent club on 13 April 2015.

At the end of the 2014–15 season, Sadler was released by the club.

===Return to Shrewsbury===

Following his release from Rotherham, Sadler signed for former loan club Shrewsbury Town in League One, on a two-year contract in May 2015.

Sadler&#x27;s first game after signing for the club on a permanent basis came in the opening game of the season, in a 2–1 loss against Millwall. A regular in the side in the early part of the season, Sadler scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 defeat to Chesterfield, but lost his place in the first-team after a run of poor personal form. Having been recalled for an FA Cup first round victory at non-league Gainsborough Trinity, he was praised for his &quot;first class attitude&quot; and determination by manager Micky Mellon. Sadler later scored his second goal of the season on 26 April 2016, in a 2–1 loss against Walsall.

Following a change in management early in the following season, Sadler found himself playing more often in a central defensive role under Paul Hurst. He was named team-captain for the first time, in the absence of Abu Ogogo and Adam El-Abd, in February 2017, and went on to win the &quot;Player of the year&quot;, &quot;Players&#x27; player of the year&quot; and &quot;Player in the community&quot; awards at the conclusion of the season, after helping Shrewsbury avoid relegation to League Two. Sadler subsequently signed a two-year contract extension, committing him to the club until summer 2019.

Ahead of the 2017–18 season, Sadler was appointed club captain, alongside team captain Abu Ogogo, leading the team to both the EFL Trophy final and the 2018 EFL League One play-off final, although they ultimately finished as runners-up on both occasions.

Immediately after the final match of the 2018–19, Sadler revealed that he would be leaving the club at the end of his contract, having clocked up over 200 appearances in all competitions, over two separate spells.

===Return to Walsall===
On 11 July 2019, Sadler returned to former club Walsall following his release from Shrewsbury Town at the end of the 2018–19 season.

Sadler announced his retirement at the end of the 2021–22 season.

<doc id="1339827" wikidata="Q3108288" url="?curid=1339827" title="Dater Glacier">
<text>The Dater Glacier is a steep valley glacier in Antarctica, long and from wide, flowing northeast in a sinuous course from the eastern slopes of the Vinson Massif between Sullivan Heights and Veregava Ridge to Rutford Ice Stream which borders the eastern flank of the Sentinel Range, Ellsworth Mountains. At the lower end the Dater Glacier coalesces with the terminus of the Ellen Glacier, the two emerging from the Sentinel Range as one stream just north of the Flowers Hills.

The glacier was discovered by U.S. Navy Squadron VX-6 on photographic flights of 14–15 December 1959, and mapped from these photographs by the United States Geological Survey. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names after Henry M. Dater, a historian on the staff of the U.S. Antarctic Projects Officer and the U.S. Naval Support Force Antarctica.

<text>The Ellen Glacier is a glacier in the central Sentinel Range of the Ellsworth Mountains of Antarctica. It drains the eastern slopes of Mount Anderson and Long Gables and flows generally southeast for to Barnes Ridge, where it leaves the range and enters the south flowing Rutford Ice Stream.

It was first mapped by the United States Geological Survey from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1957–59, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Lieutenant Colonel Cicero J. Ellen of the U.S. Air Force, who was in command of many of the air operations when the South Pole Station was established by air drop in the 1956–57 season.

<doc id="1339845" wikidata="Q239714" url="?curid=1339845" title="Islamic Relief">
<text>Islamic Relief Worldwide is an international NGO and founded in the United Kingdom in 1984. It has international headquarters in Birmingham and a network of national offices, affiliated partners, registered branches and country offices spread over more than 40 countries.

The charity typically assists more than 10 million people each year through emergency response, and development programmes in areas including education, health and livelihood support. It also advocates on behalf of those in need, focusing particularly in its campaigns on climate change, the rights of women and girls, and supporting refugees and displaced people.

Islamic Relief has been registered with the Charity Commission of England and Wales since 1989 and is an independent, non-political non-governmental organisation (NGO). In 2023, Islamic Relief&#x27;s income was £274.6 million.

== History ==
Islamic Relief was founded in 1984 by Dr Hany El-Banna and fellow students from the University of Birmingham. From its first donation of 20p, the charity raised £100,000 to help those affected by the famine in Sudan. Since then, Islamic Relief has grown into an international humanitarian organisation with an annual income of hundreds of millions and a presence in more than 40 countries across Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and North America.

=== 1990s ===
In 1993, Islamic Relief worked with UK-based newspaper The Independent on an appeal to raise funds for relief efforts during the Bosnian War. The appeal raised £37,000 for Islamic Relief and supported aid delivery throughout the conflict, including during the Siege of Sarajevo.

In 1994, Islamic Relief became the first Muslim NGO to receive UK government funding when it was awarded £180,000 to support a training centre in North Kordofan, Sudan.

The following year, the charity was the first international relief agency on the ground delivering aid to the Chechen capital, Grozny, after war broke out in the territory. Islamic Relief supplied food, blankets, clothes and medicine to those affected by the fighting.

Islamic Relief became a signatory of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement&#x27;s Code of Conduct in 1999, committing to this international standard of how to provide aid to people affected by emergencies in a non-biased manner. Humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence are the code&#x27;s core principles.

=== 2000s ===
In 2002, Islamic Relief signed a Framework Partnership with the European Commission&#x27;s Humanitarian Aid department, recognising the charity&#x27;s capacity to deliver aid to a high standard.

Islamic Relief purports to have been one of the few international aid agencies assisting people in Iraq when war broke out in 2003, providing £9 million worth of aid to people in need.

In late 2004, Islamic Relief responded to the devastating Indian Ocean Tsunami, assisting some of the hardest-hit communities. It was Islamic Relief’s largest-scale emergency response at the time and marked the beginning of the organisation’s work in Indonesia.

In 2005, Islamic Relief launched its biggest-ever operation in the United States, supporting those affected by Hurricane Katrina. That same year, the charity joined the UK&#x27;s Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC). It remains a member, along with 14 other major charities.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, Islamic Relief launched a major relief and reconstruction operation in Pakistan after the country was hit by the worst floods in living memory at the time. Its work benefited some 428,000 people in more than 580 villages, the charity has reported.

2014 saw Islamic Relief begin a partnership with the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) – the first of its kind between global Islamic and Christian humanitarian organisations. The agreement formalised a programme of joint humanitarian project, policy, research and advocacy, focusing specifically on faith and protection issues.

The decade was punctuated by the conflicts in both Syria and Yemen which according to the United Nations has left a combined 29 million people as refugees.

=== 2020–present ===
The spread of COVID-19 impacted Islamic Relief&#x27;s work around the world, delaying some projects and prompting new emergency responses to cope with the fallout of the pandemic. The charity continued to deliver aid in a safe manner where possible and moved some of its activities and events online.

In 2020 the international federation of Islamic Relief entities launched a new global governance framework, establishing an International General Assembly from which representatives from around the world elect Islamic Relief Worldwide&#x27;s board of trustees.

In 2021, Islamic Relief was recertified against the prestigious Core Humanitarian Standard on Quality and Accountability (CHS), a rigorous standard made up of nine commitments designed to ensure charities best meet the needs of the communities they serve. At the time, Islamic Relief was one of only five UK-based charities to hold the full independent certification, which will last until May 2025. The charity was first certified against the CHS in 2017.

In 2022, Islamic Relief marked World Refugee Day with a joint conference with the LWF, and another of its close faith-based partners HIAS, on &#x27;Welcoming the Stranger&#x27;.

In 2022, the charity responded as devastating flooding swept across Pakistan. Islamic Relief provided food, water, shelter and other emergency items to affected people, continuing to support communities in the months that followed the disaster. By the end of the year, Islamic Relief had assisted over 1 million people and raised over £10 million to support communities affected by the flooding.

In 2023, Islamic Relief launched major responses and appeals to address crises including the Türkiye-Syria earthquake, the outbreak of conflict in Sudan and the unprecedented escalation in violence in Gaza.

The charity also published its new 10-year Global Strategy, laying out how it would seek to achieve three core outcomes: saving lives and reducing vulnerability to humanitarian crises, empowering communities to tackle poverty and vulnerability, and advocating for change to eliminate the global and local root causes of inequality.

==Islamic Relief&#x27;s work==

=== Vision and mission ===
Islamic Relief&#x27;s work is guided by the values and teachings of the Qur&#x27;an and Sunnah, the prophetic example. These shape the organisation&#x27;s five key values: &quot;ikhlas&quot; (sincerity), &quot;ihsan&quot; (excellence), &quot;rahma&quot; (compassion), &quot;adl&quot; (social justice), and &quot;amana&quot; (custodianship).

Islamic Relief serves communities in need regardless of race, political affiliation, gender or belief, working to provide lasting routes out of poverty and to empower individuals to transform their lives.

It envisages a caring world where communities are empowered, social obligations are fulfilled, and people respond as one to the suffering of others. It is committed to the principle of Do No Harm, striving to ensure aid is appropriate for the communities it serves, and to understand and minimise any potential negative impacts of aid delivery.

=== Humanitarian programmes ===
Islamic Relief responds to humanitarian crises around the world, aiming to reduce the impact of conflicts and natural disasters. The charity focuses on rapid response, providing emergency relief and protecting vulnerable people. It also helps communities and governments to prepare for future incidents through disaster risk reduction programmes.

Some of the major emergency interventions launched by Islamic Relief have included providing life-saving aid during the Bosnian War in the 1990s, providing medical assistance during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and managing refugee camps in Darfur, Sudan. The charity has also responded to devastating natural disasters including the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the Kashmir earthquake in 2005 and a severe drought in the Horn of Africa in 2011.

In 2023, Islamic Relief reported that it had delivered 326 humanitarian projects across 29 countries that year. The charities current emergency appeals include supporting communities uprooted by violence in Gaza and Sudan, delivering vital food aid to 2 million people at risk of famine and disease in Yemen each month, and assisting individuals and families grappling with the long-term effects of prolonged drought in the Horn of Africa.

Islamic Relief also runs annual seasonal programmes, including Ramadan and qurbani food distributions, and a winter programme through which blankets, fuel and other essentials are provided to help people in need survive the colder months. These programmes reach millions of people each year.

=== Development programmes ===
Islamic Relief&#x27;s development programmes aim to empower individuals and communities to emerge from poverty and become more self-reliant. The programmes focus on providing solutions to the challenges faced by those in need, and include climate adaptation, livelihood support, and orphan sponsorship.

In 2011, Islamic Relief began a Programme Partnership Agreement with the UK government&#x27;s Department for International Development, now the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, recognising the charity&#x27;s capacity to contribute to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Islamic Relief&#x27;s development strategy has been consistently aligned to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

In 2023, Islamic Relief reported that it carried out 334 development projects that year, reaching 4.6 million people. Individuals assisted through these projects included over 91,900 orphaned children supported through the Orphan Sponsorship Programme, more than 2.8 million lives saved and improved through healthcare interventions, and improved more than 967,000 people’s access to water, sanitation and hygiene services.

=== Advocacy and campaigning ===

==== Climate change ====
In August 2015, Islamic Relief launched the Islamic Declaration on Climate Change with GreenFaith and the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences. It called on Muslim communities to take an active role in climate action at local, national and international levels. The Declaration makes an Islamic faith-endorsed case for protecting the environment and was supported by global Muslim leaders.

In 2023, Islamic Relief assisted more than 205,000 people to adapt and build resilience to the negative impacts of climate change, and produced a report on the vital role local actors play in such interventions. 

==== Women and girls ====
In 2018, Islamic Relief announced a forthcoming Declaration of Gender Justice in Islam. The Declaration is a call to action against gender inequality from an Islamic faith perspective and seeks to tackle discrimination and harmful practices, especially against women and girls in Muslim communities.

The Declaration is expected to be launched publicly in late 2022 as part of a new global campaign to empower women and girls and tackle gender inequality. The Declaration and the campaign are part of Islamic Relief&#x27;s gender justice work, which includes tackling early and forced marriage, domestic violence and female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C). In 2023, Islamic Relief offices around the world invited men and boys to join efforts to combat FGM/C in a campaign aiming to address the root causes of the harmful practice by engaging men and boys as allies in transforming the social and gender norms that perpetuate FGM/C.

==== Refugees and displaced people ====
In 2013, Islamic Relief was one of several faith-inspired organisations to work with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees[CM9] on an inter-faith affirmation. The charity also campaigns to help implement the UN&#x27;s Global Compact on Refugees, an historic agreement that includes specific recognition of the role of faith-based organisations and local faith communities in welcoming those forced to flee their homes.

In 2023, Islamic Relief continued supporting refugees and displaced people around the world, including hundreds of Ukrainian refugees living in Poland.

==== Fundraising ====
Islamic Relief raises funds through various channels including online donations, charity shops, and corporate giving. In 2023, the charity reported that it had raised a record £274.6 million through fundraising.

Islamic Relief is also the founder of Charity Week – a student volunteer-led campaign to raise funds. In 2023, Islamic Relief report that over 600 educational institutions around the world signed up to take part in that year’s event, raising a record £2.7 million.

== Structure and governance ==
The Islamic Relief federation is made up of member offices, which carry out fundraising on a national level, and country offices, which coordinate and implement projects to serve communities in need. Islamic Relief Worldwide, based in the UK, is the international office of the Islamic Relief federation. It oversees global standards and coordinates and monitors the work of country offices.

In 2020 as part of a wide governance reform programme Islamic Relief created the International General Assembly (IGA). This is the highest body of the new Islamic Relief Worldwide governance structure and consists mainly of representatives elected by Islamic Relief member offices across five continents, creating a body that is truly globally representative. It is through this body that the board of trustees are elected which is inclusive of member offices and independent members.

== Affiliated organisations ==

=== TIC International Ltd ===
TIC International is a trading subsidiary of Islamic Relief. It supports the charity&#x27;s fundraising activities by recycling clothes and running a network of charity shops across the UK. It was set up in 1993 after Islamic Relief received an influx of clothes in response to emergency appeals. The Birmingham-based firm supports Islamic Relief&#x27;s journey towards &#x27;net zero&#x27; by recycling clothing that might otherwise be disposed of in landfill or in other ways that harm the environment.

In 2023, TIC converted 2,362 tonnes of unwanted clothing into income for Islamic Relief, either through re-selling high-quality items in the charity shops or through recycling to generate profits.

=== International Waqf Fund ===
The International Waqf Fund is Islamic Relief&#x27;s investment vehicle. It was established in 2001 to boost the long-term financial sustainability of Islamic Relief investments and to generate returns for social impact, known as waqf in Islamic terminology.

Waqf enables Islamic Relief to decrease its dependency on donations and grants, as the annual yield from waqf investments provides income that funds social impact programmes. In 2021, Islamic Relief said the International Waqf endowments fund grew to £8.6 million.

=== Humanitarian Academy for Development ===
Formerly known as the Islamic Relief Academy, the Humanitarian Academy for Development (HAD) re-launched in 2018 as a centre for learning and research to benefit the humanitarian sector.

As well as training Islamic Relief staff, HAD offers training to other humanitarian practitioners. In 2023, it ran several programmes aimed at strengthening the capacity of local civil society organisations in countries including Nigeria, Cambodia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

== Memberships and key partnerships ==
Islamic Relief is a member of the United Nations&#x27; Economic and Social Council and is a signatory to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement&#x27;s Code of Conduct. It is also a member of Bond and the Disasters Emergency Committee.

Islamic Relief is the co-owner of the International Civil Society Centre, a global action platform, and an affiliate member of the INGO Accountability Charter Company. The charity is also part of the global Make Poverty History coalition, which is campaigning to end extreme poverty.

Islamic Relief also makes up part of the Beyond 2015 coalition, which aims to influence the development framework that will replace the Millennium Development Goals. In 2014, it signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate in humanitarian work with the Lutheran World Federation (LWF), and in 2015 formed a partnership with the African Union to tackle chronic poverty on the continent.

The charity’s Annual Report 2023 lists its key partners as: Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD), Bond, CHS Alliance, Church of Sweden, Climate Action Network International, Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), Finn Church Aid, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), Gender and Development Network (GADN), Global Affairs Canada, Habitat for Humanity International, HelpAge, HIAS, Humanitarian Coalition, Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), International Civil Society Centre, International Council of Voluntary Agencies (ICVA), International Organisation for Migration (IOM), Islamic Development Bank, Joint Learning Initiative (JLI), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Lutheran World Federation, PARD, Network for Religious &amp; Traditional Peacebuilders (NRTP), Qatar Charity, Qatar Red Crescent, Save the Children UK, Sheikh Abdullah Al Nouri Charity Society, Shelter Box UK, Sida (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency), START Network, TZU Chi Foundation, UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), UN World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), World Vision, Zakat House.

==Controversies==

=== Alleged links to Hamas ===
In June 2014, Israel added Islamic Relief to a list of organisations banned from operating in the country, alleging that the charity was funding Hamas. The charity&#x27;s West Bank offices were raided, during which time computers were destroyed, files were confiscated, and an office safe was forcibly opened.

Islamic Relief denied the allegations and, in late 2014, an audit carried out by the leading global audit firm, KPMG, found no evidence of any link to terrorism. The Israeli government responded by stating its decision to declare Islamic Relief illegal was &quot;based on information that has been accumulated over years&quot; and claimed that Islamic Relief was &quot;a central player in the financing of Hamas.&quot;

Islamic Relief denies this allegation and continues to challenge the decision in Israeli courts.

=== Antisemitism ===
In July 2020, one of several directors at Islamic Relief, Heshmat Khalifa, resigned after &quot;The Times&quot; discovered he had made antisemitic remarks on his Facebook page in 2014 and 2015. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, then-CEO Naser Haghamed said he was &quot;appalled&quot; by the &quot;unacceptable posts,&quot; which included labelling Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi a &quot;pimp son of the Jews&quot; and calling the Israeli government the &quot;grandchildren of monkeys and pigs.&quot;

In late August 2020, Islamic Relief announced that its entire board would be resigning in a long-planned move that was described as &quot;a part of far-reaching governance reforms&quot; that had been over five years in the making.

In January 2021, the Charity Commission of England and Wales completed a compliance case into Islamic Relief, stating that it was &quot;satisfied that it [Islamic Relief] is making the necessary improvements in terms of the vetting of trustees, and ongoing oversight over their social media activities.&quot;

Later that month, an Independent Commission helmed by the former Attorney General for England and Wales Dominic Grieve concluded that &quot;the offensive views articulated by the former senior director and two former trustees did not in any way compromise the impartiality or integrity of the organization&#x27;s humanitarian programmes.&quot;

===Smear campaign===
In March 2023, a &quot;New Yorker&quot; investigation reported that the United Arab Emirates hired Alp Services, a Swiss private intelligence agency, to spread allegations of Islamic Relief ties to the Muslim Brotherhood in Western press outlets in 2020. The smear campaign led the German government to stop working with Islamic Relief, and caused the Dutch government to announce that it would not initiate a new funding partnership with Islamic Relief for an international interfaith project. It also interfered with Islamic Relief&#x27;s ability to transfer funds to crisis zones. Islamic Relief denies any links to the Muslim Brotherhood, stating that the charity is a &quot;purely humanitarian aid organisation&quot;.

=== Other controversies ===
In 2016, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that the banking group HSBC had decided to sever ties with Islamic Relief. The charity confirmed that in 2014 HSBC had invited it to &quot;end the relationship&quot; before doing so itself after the charity refused.

HSBC did not state publicly why the relationship had been terminated but said such decisions &quot;would typically include the type of activities the business is involved in, the jurisdictions in which it operates and the products and services it uses.&quot;

Islamic Relief said it was told that HSBC needed to &quot;manage the challenge&quot; posed by customers operating in &quot;high-risk jurisdictions&quot;. The charity called on banks to ensure their de-risking measures did not impact people in need of humanitarian aid.

In 2017, the government of Bangladesh was reported to have barred Islamic Relief from aiding the Rohingya people in Cox&#x27;s Bazar, but made no specific allegation. Islamic Relief was subsequently approved to operate in Cox&#x27;s Bazar. , the government of Bangladesh was working with Islamic Relief to aid Rohingya refugees.

<doc id="1339848" wikidata="Q17051612" url="?curid=1339848" title="New Zealand humour">
<text>New Zealand humour bears some similarities to the body of humour of many other English-speaking countries. There are, however, several regional differences.

== New Zealand comedy themes ==

=== Regional humour ===
New Zealand&#x27;s remote and agricultural nature is a regular comedy catalyst as seen in the character, the stereotypical farmer, Fred Dagg, and also in the work of writer Barry Crump. 

Wellington has jokes about being windy including the Wellington Blown Away sign on the hill by the airport. As the nation&#x27;s capital city, political humour is also common. Notable comedy shows with politics as a central theme have included &quot;Gliding On&quot; by Roger Hall, &quot;Public Eye&quot;, &quot;Spin Doctors&quot;, and &quot;Facelift&quot;.

Suburban themes were explored by Ginette McDonald with her Lynn of Tawa persona.

=== Trans-Tasman rivalry ===
A famous statement by the Prime Minister of New Zealand Rob Muldoon in the 1980s commenting about the increasing exodus of New Zealanders leaving the country to work in Australia was, &quot;New Zealanders who leave for Australia raise the IQ of both countries.&quot;
==Comedians ==

Some of New Zealand&#x27;s best known comedians spent a large portion of their careers in Australia. This included John Clarke, known to New Zealanders for his character Fred Dagg, a stereotypical farmer played with precision and style. Clarke&#x27;s wit later allowed him to extend his repertoire to a series of biting satires, particularly of politicians. He also found an outlet in television series such as &quot;The Games&quot; and films such as &quot;Death in Brunswick&quot;.

Other examples include Tony Martin of the 1980s sketch show &quot;The D-Generation&quot; fame. Three compilations of the Australian national radio program &quot;Martin/Molloy&quot; earned him ARIA awards. He also wrote and directed the movie &quot;Bad Eggs&quot;.

Pamela Stephenson was born in New Zealand, made her name in Australia, went to Britain and starred in the sketch comedy &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, and currently lives in America with her husband Billy Connolly.

Billy T. James dominated New Zealand comedy through the 1980s. His first major role was the lead in TVNZ&#x27;s &quot;Radio Times&quot;. James went on to gain his own self-titled show. His characters, along with John Clarke&#x27;s Fred Dagg set a benchmark for New Zealand comedy.

At the annual New Zealand International Comedy Festival, the Fred Award is presented to the best comedy show of the year, and the Billy T Award is given to the best up-and-coming comedian.

Alan Brough appeared on &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot; as a writer and team captain. In 2004 he was one third of the radio show &quot;Tough Love with Mick Molloy&quot;. He has also appeared in several movies such as &quot;Bad Eggs&quot;

For several years during the 1970s and 1980s, New Zealand television featured a satirical send-up of current affairs entitled &quot;A Week of It&quot;. This series, and particularly its two main stars, David McPhail and Jon Gadsby, became for several years a mainstay of New Zealand comedy.

One of New Zealand film director Peter Jackson&#x27;s first films was &quot;Meet the Feebles&quot;, a riotous sexual puppet romp.

Pasifika artists known for the comedy work include the Naked Samoans, their first stage production in 1998 was &quot;Naked Samoans Talk about Their Knives.&quot; They were involved the film &quot;Sione&#x27;s Wedding,&quot; and the TV cartoon series bro&#x27;Town. &quot;Sione&#x27;s Wedding&quot; was the most commercially-successful New Zealand comedy until the release of Taika Waititi&#x27;s &quot;Boy&quot; (2010)&quot;.&quot; Tofiga Fepulea&#x27;i and Eteuati Ete made up the duo the Laughing Samoans who first performed in 2003 and have a three-part TV show called &quot;Laughing Samoans at Large&quot; (2010)&quot;.&quot;

Other New Zealand comedians include: 
*Rose Matafeo, 2018 winner of the top comedy award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
*Rhys Darby, stand-up comedian most notorious for his portrayal of Flight of the Conchords manager &#x27;Murray&#x27;.
*Raybon Kan, former journalist and lawyer turned comedian.
*Cal Wilson, appearing on &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot; several times and performing at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival numerous times. Her career in Australia extended to a regular drive-time radio show and weekly coverage of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;.
*Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement form the partnership Flight of the Conchords, their work including the HBO television series, which followed &quot;the trials and tribulations of a two-man, digi-folk band from New Zealand as they try to make a name for themselves in their adopted home of New York City&quot;.
*Taika Waititi (also known as Taika Cohen), Academy Award nominated film director and stand-up comedian.
*Jarred Christmas is an ex-pat New Zealand comic, who makes his living in the United Kingdom. He does much work with the BBC, and won the Chortle comedy award for Best Compere.
*Madeleine Sami is a Fijian Indian/Irish comedian from Auckland. She is best known for the TV series &quot;Super City&quot; and performing in the play &quot;No2&quot;.
*Topp Twins
*Jacob Rajan

<text>Deckers Outdoor Corporation, doing business as Deckers Brands, is a footwear designer and distributor based in Goleta, California, United States. It was founded in 1973 by University of California, Santa Barbara alumni Doug Otto and Karl F. Lopker. In 1975, the company was incorporated in California under the name Deckers Corporation. In October 1993, Deckers initiated a public offering of stock in its company. Deckers&#x27; portfolio of brands includes UGG, Teva, Hoka One One, and Koolaburra.

==History==
In 1973, Karl Lopker began his career making and selling flip-flops at craft fairs along the West Coast of the United States. In 1975, Doug Otto visited Hawaii on business and found that locals referred to his sandals as &quot;deckas&quot;, a slang word based on their striped layered construction that resembled a &quot;deck&quot; of stacked wood. Liking the name, Lopker and Otto named their brand Deckers.

In 1985, Deckers expanded its range of sandals when it entered into a licensing agreement to produce and distribute Teva sandals. Deckers purchased Teva&#x27;s patents, trademarks, and other assets in 2002.

The company was renamed Deckers Outdoor Corporation when it went public on the NASDAQ in 1993, and Deckers purchased Simple Shoes.

In 1995, Deckers purchased UGG Holdings. UGG boots became well known after they were included on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;&#x27;s Favorite Things segment in 2003.

In 2010, Deckers acquired MOZO Shoes, a brand that produced footwear for the culinary industry. The following year, Deckers acquired Sanuk shoes for $120 million, which it later divested to Canadian sportswear company Lolë. In 2013, Deckers acquired Hoka One One. In 2015, Deckers acquired Koolaburra and positioned it under its UGG brand.

==Brands==
===UGG===

UGG brand boots have a sheepskin upper with a wool inner lining and a tanned outer surface worn by men and women. Surfing helped popularize the boots outside of Australia and New Zealand, when surfer Brian Smith started selling the boots in the US through UGG Holdings, Inc. in 1979.

Deckers is considered a niche market supplier due to heavy reliance on its UGG brand, a fashion luxury item, in its sales. In the economic downturn of 2008, Deckers continued to show earnings and sales growth. UGG boots are Deckers&#x27; primary source of revenue.

===Hoka===

Hoka is a sportswear company that designs and markets running shoes. It was founded in 2009 in Annecy, France, and had been based in Richmond, California before it was acquired by Deckers Brands in 2013. Hoka first gained attention in the running industry by producing shoes with oversized midsoles, dubbed &quot;maximalist&quot; shoes. It has sponsored a variety of professional runners and running competitions.

===Teva===

Geophysicist Mark Thatcher invented Teva (, pronounced &quot;teh-vah&quot; not &quot;tee-vah,&quot; Hebrew for &quot;nature&quot;). While working as a rafting guide in 1982 he noticed the lack of proper shoes for river activities. Sneakers would become heavy when wet and would take days to dry, and flip-flops would slide off feet very easily.
Thatcher added a nylon ankle strap to a traditional thong-style sandal, thus creating the first sports sandal. Thatcher patented his invention and signed an agreement with the shoemaker California Pacific to manufacture the shoes. He marketed the &quot;amphibious utility sandals&quot; as their salesman, selling 200 pairs the first year. Although it was effective water sports footwear, it proved less effective for regular sports, as the first Teva users often complained of blisters between the first and second toes caused by the thong-style strapping system. However in 1984 demand for Teva sandals suddenly increase as young Americans found the sandal fashionable. California Pacific then claimed rights over the Teva name and patent, stating that Thatcher was merely an employee of their company. Thatcher sued California Pacific and won his case the following year, severing links with California Pacific. He then started the Teva company in Flagstaff, Arizona.

In late 1985, Thatcher set up an exclusive licensing agreement with Deckers Corporation to manufacture and distribute Teva sandals. Deckers eventually obtained exclusive rights to Teva, including US patent #4,793,075 for the basic design and a trademark for the brand name. The sandal was redesigned, creating the &quot;Universal Strapping System&quot;. The strapping system includes a heel strap that goes around the ankle to prevent the sandal from sliding off, and a side strap that prevents the sandal from stretching in awkward positions where injury could occur. Each strap is connected to the others by triangular &quot;rings&quot;. The basic model consists of a two-layer sole; the inner sole is softer and serves as the footbed, and most models come with arch support and Microban Zinc, a technology that reduces odor and kills bacteria. The outer sole is harder and is formulated to have a good grip on wet surfaces.

On November 25, 2002, Deckers Outdoor Cooperation acquired the worldwide Teva patents, trademarks, and other assets from Mark Thatcher.

===Koolaburra===
Koolaburra is an American importer of sheepskin footwear founded in 1991. Originally based in Santa Barbara, California, Koolaburra boots and shoes are currently made in Vietnam, and in the past have been made in Australia, Spain, Portugal, and China.

In 2005, it lost a lawsuit with Deckers Outdoor Corporation about the use of the term &quot;ug&quot; in reference to Australian sheepskin boots.

Deckers Brands acquired Koolaburra in 2015 and positioned it under its UGG brand.

<text>The Fairchild F-27 and Fairchild Hiller FH-227 are versions of the Fokker F27 Friendship twin-engined, turboprop, passenger aircraft formerly manufactured under license by Fairchild Hiller in the United States. The Fairchild F-27 was similar to the standard Fokker F27, while the FH-227 was an independently developed, stretched version.

==Design and development==


The Fokker F27 began life as a 1950 design study known as the P275, a 32-seater powered by two Rolls-Royce Dart turboprops. With the aid of Dutch government funding, the P275 evolved into the F27, which first flew on November 24, 1955. The first prototype was powered by Dart 507s and would have seated 28. To correct a slight tail heaviness and to allow for more seats, the second prototype (which first flew in January 1957) had a fuselage, which allowed seating for 32.

By this stage, Fokker had signed an agreement that would have Fairchild build Friendships in the U.S. as the F-27. The first aircraft of either manufacturer to enter service in the U.S. was, in fact, a Fairchild-built F-27, with West Coast Airlines in September 1958. Other Fairchild F-27 operators in the U.S. included Air South, Air West and successor Hughes Airwest, Allegheny Airlines, Aloha Airlines, Bonanza Air Lines, Horizon Air, Ozark Air Lines, Pacific Air Lines, Piedmont Airlines (1948–1989), Northern Consolidated Airlines, and successor Wien Air Alaska. Fairchild subsequently manufactured a larger, stretched version of the F-27 named the Fairchild Hiller FH-227, which was operated by U.S.-based air carriers Delta Air Lines, Mohawk Airlines, Northeast Airlines, Ozark Air Lines, Piedmont Airlines (1948–1989), and Wien Air Alaska.

Fairchild F-27s differed from the initial Fokker F27 Mk 100s in having basic seating for 40, heavier external skinning, a lengthened nose capable of housing weather radar, and additional fuel capacity. They also incorporated a passenger airstair door in the rear of the aircraft, operated by a flight attendant, which eliminated the need for separate stairs on the ground.

Developments were the F-27A with more powerful engines and the F-27B Combi aircraft version. The F-27B Combi mixed passenger/freight version was operated in Alaska by Northern Consolidated Airlines and Wien Air Alaska.

Fairchild independently developed the stretched FH-227, which appeared almost two years earlier than Fokker&#x27;s similar F27 Mk 500. The FH-227 featured a 1.83 m (6 ft) stretch over standard-length F27/F-27s, taking standard seating to 56, with a larger cargo area between the cockpit and the passenger cabin.

==Production==

In addition to the 581 F27s built by Fokker, 128 F-27s and 78 FH-227s were built. , only one Fairchild FH-227 aircraft, FH-227E serial number 501 belonging to the Myanmar Air Force, remained in active service.

==Fatal accidents==
Of the 206 Fairchild F-27s built, at least 33 experienced fatal crashes between 1960 and 2003:
# On November 7, 1960, an AREA Ecuador F-27A struck the dormant Atacazo volcano in bad weather during its approach to Mariscal Sucre International Airport in Quito, Ecuador after a domestic flight from Simón Bolívar International Airport, in Guayaquil. The crash, south of Quito and 150 meters to the summit of the Atacazo, killed all the 37 occupants of the plane. This particular aircraft (msn. 1, reg. HC-ADV) was the first prototype of the Fairchild F-27, which had been sold to AREA Ecuador in 1959. At the time, it was the worst aerial crash in the history of Ecuador, the first and worst fatal loss of an F-27, and the first accident involving the then-recently-opened Quito airport.
# On February 25, 1962, an Avensa F-27A crashed into a mountain on Margarita Island, killing all 23 on board.
# On March 8, 1962, a Turkish Airlines F-27 crashed into the Taurus Mountains, killing all 11 on board.
# On January 17, 1963, a West Coast Airlines F-27 training flight crashed into the Great Salt Lake, killing all 3 aboard.
# On May 7, 1964, Pacific Air Lines Flight 773, an F-27A on a short flight from Stockton, California to San Francisco, crashed and killed all 44 aboard, after a passenger shot both pilots in a murder–suicide.
# On November 15, 1964, Bonanza Air Lines Flight 114, flying an F-27 from Phoenix, Arizona, to Las Vegas, Nevada, crashed into a mountain south of Las Vegas during poor weather. All 26 passengers and three crew on board died.
# On March 10, 1967, West Coast Airlines Flight 720 crashed with four fatalities and no survivors near Klamath Falls, Oregon. The F-27 was bound for Medford, Oregon, from Klamath Falls, and crashed due to ice accumulation on the aircraft.
# On March 8, 1968, the F-27 aircraft flying Air Manila Flight 507 was destroyed in a turbulent thundercloud over the Sibuyan Sea, killing all 14 on board.
# On May 4, 1968, an Eastex F-27J killed the two people on board, from a failed landing at El Paisano Ranch, Texas.
# On August 10, 1968, Piedmont Airlines Flight 230 was on an ILS localizer-only approach to Charleston-Kanawha County Airport (CRW) in West Virginia when the FH-227B struck trees 360 feet from the runway threshold. All three crew members and 32 of the 34 passengers perished. The National Transportation Safety Board blamed the accident on an &quot;unrecognized loss of altitude orientation during the final portion of an approach into shallow, dense fog.&quot;
# On October 25, 1968, Northeast Airlines Flight 946, an FH-227, crashed on Moose Mountain near Hanover, New Hampshire, on approach to Lebanon Municipal Airport. Of the 39 passengers and three crew on board, 32 were killed.
# On December 2, 1968, Wien Consolidated Airlines F-27B, N4905B, encountered turbulence near Pedro Bay, Alaska that tore off the right wing. All 39 on board died. Pre-existing fatigue cracks contributed to wing failure. (NTSB DCA69A0006)
# On November 19, 1969, Mohawk Airlines Flight 411, a short flight between Albany and Glens Falls, New York, crashed into Pilot Knob Mountain, killing all 14 on board the FH-227B.
# On March 14, 1970, a Paraense FH-227B registration PP-BUF operating flight 903 from São Luiz to Belém-Val de Cans, Brazil, while on final approach to land at Belém, crashed into Guajará Bay. Of the 40 passengers and crew, three survived.

# On March 3, 1972, Mohawk Airlines Flight 405, an FH-227, crashed into a house in Albany, New York, on approach to Albany County Airport. The crew had difficulty getting the cruise lock to disengage in one of the engines. While the crew attempted to deal with the problem, the aircraft crashed short of the airfield, killing 16 of the 48 people in the aircraft and one person on the ground. The lone surviving crew member was stewardess Sandra Quinn.
# On Friday, October 13, 1972, Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, an FH-227D carrying 45 people, crashed in the remote Andes mountains. The pilot mistakenly believed the aircraft had overflown Curicó, the turning point to fly north, and begin descending. He failed to notice that instrument readings indicated he was still east of Curicó. The plane crashed at on a glacier; 16 of the 45 people on board survived for 72 days by resorting to cannibalism, eating the dead. The event became known as the &quot;Miracle in the Andes&quot;, and was the subject of the 1974 book &quot;&quot;, the 1993 film &quot;Alive&quot; and the 2023 film &quot;Society of the Snow&#x27;&quot;.
# On July 23, 1973, Ozark Air Lines Flight 809 was operated by an FH-227, registration N4215.

# On June 2, 1980, an F-27J operated by Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano crashed into a hill while approaching Yacuiba Airport, killing all 13 occupants.
# On June 12, 1982, a TABA – Transportes Aéreos da Bacia Amazônica FH-227 registration PT-LBV en route from Eirunepé to Tabatinga, Brazil, on approach to Tabatinga collided with a pole in poor visibility and crashed onto a parking lot. All 40 passengers and four crew died.
# On December 9, 1982, an Aeronor Chile F-27A was operating as Flight 304 on a scheduled domestic service from Santiago to La Serena, Chile. On final approach to La Serena&#x27;s La Florida Airport, the aircraft stalled and crashed, bursting into flames on impact. All 42 passengers and four crew on board died.
# On March 16, 1984, a Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano F-27M crashed into Mount Pilón en route to San Borja, claiming the lives of all 23 occupants.
# On March 4, 1988, a TAT European Airlines FH-227B operating a scheduled service from Nancy to Paris Orly as TAT Flight 230 crashed near Fontainebleau, France, killing all 23 occupants. An electrical malfunction during the start of the aircraft&#x27;s descent had resulted in a sudden loss of control.
# On April 10, 1989, Uni-Air International Flight 602 from Paris to Valence crashed into a mountain because of a navigational error, killing all 22 aboard the FH-227B.
# On May 10, 1990, Aviacsa Flight 100 killed all four crew members and 20 of the 36 passengers, from a failed landing of the F-27J aircraft at Tuxtla Gutiérrez Airport in Mexico. Investigators attributed the crash to the crew&#x27;s lack of experience and coordination, in the airline&#x27;s first week of operation.
# On June 6, 1990, TABA FH-227 registration PT-ICA flying from Belém-Val de Cans to Cuiabá, Brazil, via Altamira and other stops, while on approach under fog to land at Altamira, descended below the approach path, collided with trees, and crashed 850 m short of the runway. Of the 41 passengers and crew, 23 died.
# On January 25, 1993, TABA FH-227, registration PT-LCS, operating a cargo flight from Belém-Val de Cans to Altamira, Brazil, crashed into the jungle near Altamira during night-time approach procedures. The crew of three died.
# On November 28, 1995, TABA FH-227, registration PP-BUJ, operating a cargo flight from Belém-Val de Cans to Santarém, Brazil, crashed on its second attempt to approach Santarém. The crew of two and one of the passenger occupants died.
# On January 17, 2002, an FH-227E (reg. HC-AYM, sn. 511) belonging to the Ecuadorian state-owned Petroecuador oil company, flying from Quito&#x27;s airport to Lago Agrio Airport (150 km. west of Quito), in the Amazon region province of Sucumbíos, went off course and flew into the 4500 meter-high &quot;Cerro El Tigre&quot; mountain in Colombia&#x27;s Putumayo Department, 14 km. across from the border with Ecuador and approximately 50 miles (80 km.) from its destination. All 21 passengers (Petroecuador employees) plus the five crew members were killed in the crash. The controlled flight into terrain was caused by a loss of situational awareness by the pilots, owing to distractions (lack of sterile cockpit rule) and poor crew resource management, compounded by poor visibility (fog) and the plane&#x27;s lack of a ground proximity warning system.
# On October 26, 2003, an FH-227B cargo flight by CATA Línea Aérea crashed after an engine failed during takeoff from Buenos Aires, killing all five aboard.

<text>In various works of speculative fiction, a portable hole is a two-dimensional device that can be used to contravene the laws of physics by creating a passage through a solid surface, through which characters can move.

== Notable uses ==

The 1955 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon, &quot;The Hole Idea&quot;, presents a fictional account in which Calvin Q. Calculus invents the device. Another early Looney Tunes example, &quot;Beep Prepared&quot; from 1961, developed the trope further and features the Road Runner lifting a (previously ordinary) hole off the ground, carrying it, then laying it down for the Coyote to fall through; the hole in this case is mundane until the start of the gag, as opposed to an intentional scientific creation as in &quot;The Hole Idea&quot;. The concept was shown in The Beatles&#x27; 1968 movie, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, where Ringo picks up a hole from the Sea of Holes, stores it in his pocket, and uses it later to release Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Band from captivity. In 1988, &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; again used a portable hole as a plot device. Detective Eddie Valiant is able to escape being crushed by a steamroller by using one, echoing the 1955 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; gag. The 1988 cartoon series &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; features a portable hole with similar properties in the episode &quot;Bubble Trouble.&quot;

In the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game, a portable hole is a circle of cloth made from phase spider webs, strands of ether and beams of starlight. When deployed, it creates an extradimensional space six feet in diameter by ten feet deep. Folding the cloth causes the entrance to this space to disappear, but items placed inside the hole remain there. Sufficient air is contained in the hole to support life for up to ten minutes. In the novelization of &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, Elliott uses a portable hole when the lead characters are playing &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

In episode 695 of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;-based comic &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot;, Fighter, after buying some items and a portable hole with Red Mage, decides to &quot;work smarter, not harder&quot;, and put all the items into the portable hole. He then proceeds to fold the portable hole into itself.

In Rajiv Joseph&#x27;s play, &quot;Guards at the Taj&quot;, one of the characters, Humayun, invents a &quot;transportable hole&quot;. Humayun describes it as a hole one can carry and attach to anything to make a hole in it.

== Other uses of the term ==

A 1933 newspaper described John Williamson&#x27;s underwater photography apparatus as a portable &quot;hole in the sea&quot;. It was a bendable tube from the ship to the sea bottom for a photographer to descend.

A 1949 newspaper column by Truman Twill speculates on a prefabricated underground storage unit described as &quot;a portable hole to be sunk in the ground at a desirable location&quot;.

Gramicidin A has been described as a portable hole; it is a polypeptide with a helical shape. When it forms a dimer, it can embed itself in cellular bilayer membranes and form a hole through which water molecules can pass.

The Museum of Modern Art has a work by Ben Vautier titled, &quot;The First Portable Hole (Le Premier trou portatif)&quot;.

In &quot;Shari Lewis presents 101 magic tricks for kids to do,&quot; a trick named &quot;the portable hole&quot; is described. A card trick titled &quot;Acme Portable Hole&quot; is available commercially.

<doc id="1339870" wikidata="Q518608" url="?curid=1339870" title="Ferruginous pygmy owl">
<text>The ferruginous pygmy owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) is a small owl that breeds in south-central Arizona and southern Texas in the United States, south through Mexico and Central America, to South America into Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina.

In Central America and South America, it is the most widely distributed pygmy owl and is probably one of the most numerous owl species in those areas. It is found in a wide range of semi-open wooded habitats.

==Taxonomy==
The ferruginous pygmy owl was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other owls in the genus &quot;Strix&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Strix brasiliana&quot;. Although not cited directly, Gmelin&#x27;s description was ultimately based on the &quot;Cabure&quot; that had been described in 1648 by the German naturalist Georg Marcgrave in his &quot;Historia Naturalis Brasiliae&quot;. The ferruginous pygmy owl is now placed with 28 other small owls in the genus &quot;Glaucidium&quot; that was introduced in 1826 by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;glaukidion&quot; meaning &quot;little owl&quot; or &quot;owlet&quot;. It is diminutive of &quot;glaux&quot; meaning &quot;owl&quot;.

Thirteen subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;G. b. cactorum&quot; Van Rossem, 1937 – south Arizona (USA) to Sonora to north Nayarit (west Mexico)
* &quot;G. b. intermedium&quot; Phillips, AR, 1966 – south Nayarit to Oaxaca (west Mexico)
* &quot;G. b. ridgwayi&quot; Sharpe, 1875 – south Texas (central south USA) to west Panama
* &quot;G. b. medianum&quot; Todd, 1916 – north Colombia
* &quot;G. b. margaritae&quot; Phelps, WH &amp; Phelps, WH Jr, 1951 – Margarita Island (off Venezuela)
* &quot;G. b. phaloenoides&quot; (Daudin, 1800) – north, east Venezuela, Trinidad and the Guianas
* &quot;G. b. duidae&quot; Chapman, 1929 – Cerro Duida (south Venezuela)
* &quot;G. b. olivaceum&quot; Chapman, 1939 – Auyán Tepui (southeast Venezuela)
* &quot;G. b. ucayalae&quot; Chapman, 1929 – Amazonia
* &quot;G. b. brasilianum&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1788) – east Brazil to northeast Argentina
* &quot;G. b. pallens&quot; Brodkorb, 1938 – east Bolivia, west Paraguay and north Argentina
* &quot;G. b. stranecki&quot; König, C &amp; Wink, 1995 – central Argentina to south Uruguay
* &quot;G. b. tucumanum&quot; Chapman, 1922 – west Argentina

Trinidad, as well as other localities, have endemic subspecies of the &quot;Glaucidium brasilianum&quot; owl. Recent genetics work has found substantial differences in ferruginous pygmy owls from different regions and members of the northern &quot;ridgwayi&quot; group are sometimes considered a separate species, Ridgway&#x27;s pygmy-owl (&quot;Glaucidium ridgwayi&quot;).

==Description==
The ferruginous pygmy owl is small, typically , and stocky with disproportionately large feet and talons. The crown has elongated white/buff streaks, the wing coverts have white spots, and the underparts are heavily streaked white. There are prominent white supercilia above the facial disc. There are two dark spots on the nape, often termed &quot;false eyes&quot; by birders. Otherwise, its overall color is highly variable, ranging from grey-brown with a black-and-white barred tail to rich rufous with a uniform rufous tail. Sexes are similar with females slightly larger and often more reddish. The flight is often undulating in motion, similar to that of many woodpecker species.

===Call===
The call is a whistled &quot;hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo&quot;, usually in E flat. It is easily imitated, and is used by birdwatchers to attract small birds intent on mobbing the pygmy owls.

==Behavior and ecology==
It can be readily located by the small birds that mob it while it is perched in a tree (up to 40 birds of 11 species have been recorded mobbing one owl).

===Food and feeding===
This species is crepuscular, but often hunts by day. It hunts a variety of birds, lizards, other reptiles, amphibians, mammals, and insects. Specific examples of what these owls feed on include grasshoppers, crickets, scorpions, six-lined racerunners, four-lined skinks, Texas spotted whiptails, creamy-bellied thrushes, pale-breasted thrushes, eared doves, and mice.

===Breeding===
The breeding season is from late winter to early spring. It is a cavity nesting bird (tree and columnar cactus cavities), laying one to seven white eggs. Incubation is 28 days, with 27 to 30 days to fledging.

==Status and conservation==
The northernmost subspecies, &quot;G. b. cactorum&quot;, commonly called the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl, was a listed Endangered species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. It This protected it in south-central Arizona from loss of habitat and buffel grass fires. Buffel grass catches fire very easily, which spreads to cacti, burning the owl&#x27;s primary habitat. Its range extends over the border into Sonora, Mexico. &quot;G. b. cactorum&quot; was delisted in 2006. It was also considered to be an &quot;Imperiled Subspecies&quot; by NatureServe, with the species as a whole considered &quot;Secure&quot;.

<text>WorldCat is a union catalog that itemizes the collections of tens of thousands of institutions (mostly libraries), in many countries, that are current or past members of the OCLC global cooperative. It is operated by OCLC, Inc. Many of the OCLC member libraries collectively maintain WorldCat&#x27;s database, the world&#x27;s largest bibliographic database. The database includes other information sources in addition to member library collections. OCLC makes WorldCat itself available free to libraries, but the catalog is the foundation for other subscription OCLC services (such as resource sharing and collection management). WorldCat is used by librarians for cataloging and research and by the general public.

, WorldCat contained over 540 million bibliographic records in 483 languages, representing over 3 billion physical and digital library assets, and the WorldCat persons dataset (mined from WorldCat) included over 100 million people.

==History==
OCLC was founded in 1967 under the leadership of Fred Kilgour. That same year, OCLC began to develop the union catalog technology that would later evolve into WorldCat; the first catalog records were added in 1971.

In 2003, OCLC began the &quot;Open WorldCat&quot; pilot program, making abbreviated records from a subset of WorldCat available to partner web sites and booksellers, to increase the accessibility of its subscribing member libraries&#x27; collections.

In October 2005, the OCLC technical staff began a wiki project, WikiD, allowing readers to add commentary and structured-field information associated with any WorldCat record. WikiD was later phased out, although WorldCat later incorporated user-generated content in other ways.

In 2006, it became possible for anyone to search WorldCat directly at its open website WorldCat.org, not only through the subscription FirstSearch interface where it had been available on the web to subscribing libraries for more than a decade before. Options for more sophisticated searches of WorldCat have remained available through the FirstSearch interface.

In 2007, WorldCat Identities began providing pages for 20 million &quot;identities&quot;, which are metadata about names—predominantly authors and persons who are the subjects of published titles.

In 2017, OCLC&#x27;s WorldCat Search API was integrated into the cite tool of Wikipedia&#x27;s , allowing Wikipedia editors to cite sources from WorldCat easily.

Beginning in 2017, OCLC and the Internet Archive have collaborated to make the Internet Archive&#x27;s records of digitized books available in WorldCat.

In May 2022, OCLC announced WorldCat Entities, a new infrastructure for library linked data. Maintenance of WorldCat Identities was suspended and the service will be discontinued as it is being replaced by WorldCat Entities.

In August 2022, OCLC launched a &quot;redesigned and reimagined&quot; WorldCat.org website with the stated goal &quot;to offer greater accessibility to the collections&quot;. The website now requires the use of JavaScript and is therefore no longer accessible for users of older web browsers or those that have JavaScript disabled for security reasons. The update also removed users&#x27; book reviews and replaced them with reviews from Amazon subsidiary GoodReads.

In 2023, Anna&#x27;s Archive scraped and began distributing the whole WorldCat database and was subsequently sued by OCLC in January 2024.

==System architecture==
Local catalogs of many OCLC member libraries are intermittently synchronized with the WorldCat database. WorldCat allows participating institutions to add direct links from WorldCat to their own local catalog entries for particular items, which enables the user to click through to the local catalog to quickly determine an item&#x27;s real-time status (for example, whether or not it is checked out).

In a small percentage of libraries, the local catalog is also run by OCLC using an integrated library system called WorldCat Discovery and WorldShare Management Services.

Library contributions to WorldCat are made via the Connexion computer program, which was introduced in 2001; its predecessor, OCLC Passport, was phased out in May 2005. Cataloging librarians may also use the WorldShare Record Manager or WorldCat Metadata API for similar purposes.

<doc id="1339879" wikidata="Q1487455" url="?curid=1339879" title="Graphical user interface builder">
<text>A graphical user interface builder (or GUI builder), also known as GUI designer or sometimes RAD IDE, is a software development tool that simplifies the creation of GUIs by allowing the designer to arrange graphical control elements (often called widgets) using a drag-and-drop WYSIWYG editor. Without a GUI builder, a GUI must be built by manually specifying each widget&#x27;s parameters in the source code, with no visual feedback until the program is run. Such tools are usually called the term RAD IDE.

User interfaces are commonly programmed using an event-driven architecture, so GUI builders also simplify creating event-driven code. This supporting code connects software widgets with the outgoing and incoming events that trigger the functions providing the application logic.

Some graphical user interface builders automatically generate all the source code for a graphical control element. Others, like Interface Builder or Glade Interface Designer, generate serialized object instances that are then loaded by the application.

<text>Yanic Truesdale (born March 17, 1970) is a Canadian-American actor best known for his portrayal of Michel Gerard in the television series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Truesdale was born and raised in Montreal. At 17 years old, he joined the National Theatre School of Canada and graduated at age 20.

==Career==
One of Truesdale&#x27;s first big breaks was a starring role in &quot;He Shoots, He Scores&quot;, a popular Canadian series about hockey. He went on to work for six years on the television series &quot;:fr: Les héritiers Duval,&quot; and in 1998 was nominated for his first Gemini Award for Best Acting - Comedy Series or Special for his performance in the sitcom &quot; :fr: Majeurs et vaccinés&quot;. The series was a critical hit throughout Canada, with Truesdale portraying the only Black child in a white family. Truesdale then starred in &quot;:fr: Mauvais Karma&quot;, which landed him his second Gemini nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy.

Truesdale moved to New York City and studied at the renowned Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. Truesdale’s very first audition in Los Angeles was for &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, a character he portrayed for 158 episodes starring opposite Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, and Melissa McCarthy as the opinionated, sarcastic, and good-hearted concierge of the Independence Inn, Michel Gerard. The role garnered Truesdale critical acclaim, landing him on the &quot;Variety 10 Actors to Watch&quot; list opposite Ryan Gosling and Jennifer Garner.

Additional recent credits for Truesdale include appearing in the award nominated film &quot;My Salinger Year&quot; opposite Sigourney Weaver and Margaret Qualley, which opened the Berlin Film Festival, &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; for HBO (where he played Lin-Manuel Miranda’s agent), and is a part of the ongoing murder mystery franchise &quot;Fallen Angels Murder Club&quot; for Lifetime opposite Toni Braxton. 

In 2022, Truesdale performed in the Netflix comedy series &quot;God’s Favorite Idiot&quot; opposite Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone. &quot;God’s Favorite Idiot&quot; follows a mid-level tech support employee who finds love with a co-worker at exactly the same time that he becomes the unwitting messenger of God.

==Personal life==
Truesdale is the owner of indoor cycling studio Spin Énergie in Montreal.

<text>Mount Craddock is a large, bold mountain forming the south extremity of Craddock Massif in Sentinel Range, the ninth highest mountain in Antarctica. It is linked by Karnare Col to Mount Strybing in the southern Sentinel Range. The ninth-highest mountain in Antarctica was first climbed in January 1992.

The name Mount Craddock was originally recommended by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) in 1965 for the present-day Craddock Massif but subsequent maps limited Mount Craddock to the massif&#x27;s southernmost peak, a position that became established over years. To avoid confusion and to fix the position of the name, US-ACAN redefined Mount Craddock in 2006 to apply to the southernmost peak described above.

The mountain was named by US-ACAN for J. Campbell Craddock (1930–2006), leader of a University of Minnesota expedition (1962–63) that made geological investigations and cartographic surveys in the Sentinel and Heritage Ranges of the Ellsworth Mountains. During 1960–61, Craddock led a Minnesota geological expedition in examining the Jones Mountains.
Mount Craddock is the second-highest point of the Craddock Massif which includes Mount Rutford (highest point), Rada Peak, and Bugueño Pinnacle. Rutford was named for R. H. Rutford, Antarctic geologist and colleague of Craddock. Rada Peak and Bugueño Pinnacle were named for Camilo Rada and Manuel Bugueño, climbing partners of Damien Gildea, a leading Antarctic researcher and climber.

<text>Angelique Pettyjohn (born Dorothy Lee Perrins; March 11, 1943 – February 14, 1992) was an American actress and burlesque queen. She appeared as the drill thrall Shahna in the &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;The Gamesters of Triskelion&quot;.

==Acting career==
Pettyjohn was born in Los Angeles, California, and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. Her first credited film appearances were in 1967 under the name Angelique. They include &quot;The Touch of Her Flesh&quot; and &quot;The Love Rebellion&quot;. Her big break came that same year in the Elvis Presley film &quot;Clambake&quot;.

Pettyjohn was one of the go-go dancers in the opening scene of the comedy film &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (1968), starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, and she also tested for the role of Nova in &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; the same year (Linda Harrison accepted the role).

In 1968, Pettyjohn appeared in the &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;The Gamesters of Triskelion&quot; as Shahna, the thrall trainer of Captain James T. Kirk. She also appeared on other 1960s television series such as &quot;Mister Terrific&quot;; &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;; &quot;Batman&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;; and as male CONTROL agent Charlie Watkins (a &quot;master of disguise&quot; who is able to appear convincingly female) in two episodes of &quot;Get Smart&quot;: &quot;Smart Fit the Battle of Jericho&quot; and &quot;Pussycats Galore&quot; (1967).

In 1969, she starred in the horror film &quot;The Mad Doctor of Blood Island&quot;, appeared as Cherry in the biker film &quot;Hell&#x27;s Belles&quot;, played a saloon girl in the Glenn Ford Western &quot;Heaven with a Gun&quot;, and starred in &quot;Childish Things&quot;, co-directed by John Derek.

Her 1970s films included &quot;Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon&quot; (1970) starring Liza Minnelli, the sci-fi exploitation film &quot;The Curious Female&quot; (1970), and the low-budget crime drama &quot;The G.I. Executioner&quot; (1971) where she played a topless dancer. She played a stripping nun in the comedy film &quot;Good-bye, Cruel World&quot; (1983), and appeared in such cult classic features as &quot;The Lost Empire&quot; (1984), &quot;Repo Man&quot; (1984), &quot;Biohazard&quot; (1985), and Mike Jittlov&#x27;s film &quot;The Wizard of Speed and Time&quot; (1989), where she played an assistant to a movie executive (and designed her own costumes).

During the early 1980s, she made use of her buxom figure in such hardcore adult films as &quot;Titillation&quot;, &quot;Stalag 69&quot;, and &quot;Body Talk&quot; (all 1982) under the pseudonyms Angelique, Heaven St. John, and Angel St. John.

==Burlesque==
During the 1970s, she worked as a burlesque star in Las Vegas. In 1970, she appeared in Barry Ashton&#x27;s Burlesque Show at the Silver Slipper Gambling Hall and Saloon. She later was a featured showgirl in the Vive Paris Vive show at the Aladdin Hotel. She also was featured in the Maxim Hotel &amp; Casino Burlesque Show, and in 1978 teamed with Bob Mitchell and Miss Nude Universe in &quot;True Olde Tyme Burlesque&quot; at the Joker Club. She was photographed by Robert Scott Hooper for the February 1979 &quot;Playboy&quot; pictorial &quot;The Girls of Las Vegas&quot;. 

Pettyjohn became quite popular at the &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions and in 1979 Hooper photographed her in her costume from the episode &quot;The Gamesters of Triskelion&quot;. They produced two posters that she sold at the conventions: one in her complete costume and one partially nude with the costume.

==Death==
On February 14, 1992, Pettyjohn died in Las Vegas from cervical cancer at age 48.

<doc id="1339899" wikidata="Q4808571" url="?curid=1339899" title="Stephen Clemence">
<text>Stephen Neal Clemence (born 31 March 1978) is an English football coach and former player, who made nearly 250 appearances in the Premier League and Football League playing as a midfielder and was recently manager of club Barrow.

Clemence began his career with Tottenham Hotspur, where he spent six years as a professional but never established himself as a regular first-team player. He was capped once for England at under-21 level. He moved on to Birmingham City in 2003, where he was chosen player of the 2006–07 season, at the end of which he signed for Leicester City. Clemence was well known for his passion, drive, leadership and commitment on the pitch. 

After retirement Clemence joined the coaching staff at Sunderland before moving to Hull City as reserve-team manager and as first-team coach, and continued to follow Steve Bruce to Aston Villa, Sheffield Wednesday, Newcastle United and West Bromwich Albion as first-team coach or assistant manager. He was caretaker manager of Sheffield Wednesday in 2019 and later managed Gillingham and Barrow in his own right.

==Club career==
===Tottenham Hotspur===
The first team Clemence played for was Tottenham Hotspur, for whom he made his debut against Manchester United on 10 August 1997, a match Tottenham lost 2–0. His season was cut much shorter by a four-day spell in February 1998, during which time Clemence picked up a red card against Barnsley. He involved himself to a greater degree the following season, displaying more of the form which won him a place in the England U21 side. He scored three times during his spell at Spurs, his first coming in the 1997–98 FA Cup against Fulham, followed by two league goals against Derby County and Sunderland. Despite not being part of Tottenham&#x27;s squad for the 1999 Football League Cup Final he made three appearances during their victorious League Cup campaign.

Clemence&#x27;s injury woes started when he suffered a torn medial ligament in his left knee, following a collision with Blackburn Rovers midfielder Garry Flitcroft in a match at Ewood Park in August 2001. His injury required surgery and was thought he would be out for three months. However, despite clocking up a few hours of football in the reserves, he played only three first-team matches at the end of the 2001–02 season. Further injuries prevented his returning to training until October 2002. In what turned out to be his last season at Tottenham, Clemence played only once, in a 2–1 League Cup defeat to Burnley on 6 November 2002, in which he picked up a calf injury.

===Birmingham City===

When Clemence recovered from the calf injury, Luton Town manager Joe Kinnear had expressed interest in signing him on loan, but when the transfer window opened in January 2003, Premier League newcomers Birmingham City agreed a fee, believed to be in the region of £1.3 million, for a permanent transfer. The move was completed, for a fee reported by the BBC as £900,000, on 10 January; Clemence signed a three-and-a-half-year contract. He made his debut two days later in a 4–0 defeat to Arsenal at St Andrew&#x27;s.

In July 2003, Birmingham City participated in the Premier League Asia Trophy in Kuala Lumpur; they failed to reach the final, but Clemence scored the third goal as they beat the Malaysian national team 4–0 to secure third place. Injury struck again in the 2003–04 season, meaning that once again he had to sit several games out. He also found himself competing with David Dunn and Robbie Savage for a central midfield spot. Nonetheless, he finished the season by making his 50th appearance for the club.

In the 2004–05 season, Clemence&#x27;s first team chances were again in the balance when the club signed Muzzy Izzet, but he stated he would fight for his place in the team. The club opened talks with Clemence in May 2005, and he signed a new three-year contract on 14 October. Clemence suffered a calf problem in a 1–0 defeat to Aston Villa two days later, and on 4 April 2006, he tore a hamstring in a 1–0 win over Bolton Wanderers, sidelining him for the remainder of the season as Birmingham were relegated from the Premier League.

He contemplated leaving the club after being dropped twice in 2006–07, but later became an integral part of the team, helping the club win promotion back to the Premier League. For his contributions, Clemence won both the club&#x27;s player of the year and players&#x27; player of the year awards that season. He played his last match for Birmingham in a 1–0 defeat to Preston North End on 6 May 2007, missing out on the Championship title.

In July 2007, Bruce confirmed that Clemence would be leaving the club because he could not guarantee him first-team football. He was linked with a £500,000 move to Charlton Athletic, Southampton were also believed to be monitoring him, while Leicester City were seeking a double signing with teammate DJ Campbell.

===Leicester City===

On 9 July, Leicester City made an offer for Clemence, which Birmingham rejected, demanding an increased bid for the player. On 13 July, Clemence signed a three-year contract with Leicester in a deal which &quot;could rise to £1m&quot;. DJ Campbell joined him at the club seven days later. Clemence was named the new team captain on 28 July, and was picked by the BBC as Leicester&#x27;s key player for the 2007–08 season. Clemence later admitted that &quot;when [manager] Martin Allen was here, we didn&#x27;t have a settled team and we were not sure if our jobs were safe.&quot;

He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat to Blackpool at the Walkers Stadium on 11 August 2007. Clemence scored his first goal with the stoppage-time winner for Leicester in a 3–2 League Cup win over Nottingham Forest on 18 September, and his second in a 1–1 draw with Charlton Athletic on 29 December. He suffered a calf strain in January 2008, followed by a thigh injury in early March, though he was sidelined for only a short while. On 29 March, Clemence tore a calf muscle in a 1–0 win over Scunthorpe United which kept him out for what remained of the season, as Leicester were relegated from the Championship. It proved to be the final competitive match of his career.

Clemence underwent an operation in April and was expected to recover in time for pre-season training. However, he suffered complications following surgery on his Achilles tendon. As a result, Clemence played no part in the 2008–09 season, while vice-captain Matthew Oakley took over the armband and helped the club regain promotion from League One. He had a second operation in October 2008, in which &quot;the surgeon had to take the Achilles off the heel-bone, clear out the rubbish and then sew it back on. He also had to shave some of the bone off the heel.&quot; As of July 2009, Clemence was yet to recover from his heel injury, an ordeal he considered &quot;tough to deal with mentally because this is the longest time I&#x27;ve had out of the game.&quot;

He marked his return to action in a 3–1 win over Derby County reserves on 8 September 2009, playing for 30 minutes as a substitute. He played his first full game in a 1–0 win over Barwell reserves on 13 October, and scored the match-winning penalty. Manager Nigel Pearson, however, said on 26 November that Clemence would not be rushed back into the first team, adding he wanted him to be &quot;absolutely spot on&quot; before returning. He returned to training intermittently with the squad in early December. On Easter Monday 2010 however, Clemence announced his retirement from football after failing to fully recover from his heel injury, and he was released by Leicester at the end of the season.

==Coaching career==
Having coached youth sides during his playing career, Clemence joined Steve Bruce&#x27;s staff at Sunderland as a development coach with the reserve team in the summer of 2010 having played for him at Birmingham City.

On 2 July 2012, it was announced that Clemence had been appointed head coach of the under-21s at Hull City, before later being promoted to first-team coach under Bruce. In October 2016, after contributing to two promotions to the Premier League and a run to the 2014 FA Cup final, Clemence left Hull City and reunited with Bruce again, this time as Aston Villa&#x27;s first-team coach. 

Clemence helped the Villains reach the Championship play-off final in 2018 having achieved a fourth-place domestic finish, in addition to helping develop talent such as Jack Grealish. Grealish spoke of Clemence&#x27;s impact by saying: &quot;I asked Stephen if he could help me and make me a better player. I am really close with him, he is the closest I have been out of all the assistant managers I have had. We go through all of my clips and discuss where I am going right or wrong. I am glad to have someone like Stephen taking the time out to help me and improve&quot;. On 3 October 2018, Bruce left the club, along with staff including Clemence.

On 2 January 2019, Sheffield Wednesday announced the appointment of Bruce as the club&#x27;s head coach from 1 February, while Clemence and Steve Agnew would be in charge of the team until his arrival from which point Clemence functioned as first-team coach. Clemence resigned on 15 July to accept the position of assistant head coach of Premier League club Newcastle United under Bruce, where he would form a part of the coaching staff for 100 games before departing two years later.

Bruce was named manager of West Bromwich Albion in February 2022, and Clemence and Agnew became his assistants. When Bruce departed eight months later, his staff left with him.

After leaving West Bromwich Albion Clemence declared he was looking for his first managerial role.

== Managerial career ==
On 1 November 2023, Clemence was appointed head coach of League Two side Gillingham in his first managerial appointment. On 29 April 2024, following the final match of the season, he was sacked following a twelfth-place finish, six points off of the play-off places.

On 31 May 2024, Clemence was appointed head coach of fellow League Two side Barrow on a two-year deal.

On 18 January 2025, Clemence departed the club, following a run of poor form. 

==International career==
Clemence was capped by the England national under-18 team, scoring two goals in seven appearances, between 1995 and 1996. He was capped once by the under-21 team, as a substitute in a 2–0 away win over Sweden on 4 September 1998. He was eligible to play for Northern Ireland through his Northern Ireland-born grandmother. Clemence rejected the chance to represent the country in both May and July 2004, a decision which manager Lawrie Sanchez said he would respect. Sanchez did ask Clemence to reconsider in October 2006, but he never represented a national team at senior level.

==Personal life==
Clemence was born in Liverpool. He is the son of England international goalkeeper Ray Clemence, who was then a Liverpool player. In 2003, he married model and actress Angela Saunders. The couple had two children together. Clemence married former &quot;Brookside&quot; actress Suzanne Collins in June 2017. 

Clemence is a brother-in-law of both former footballer Dougie Freedman and golfer Brian Davis, who are married to his sisters Sarah and Julie respectively.

On 21 November 2004, Clemence was a witness to racial abuse of his Birmingham City teammate Dwight Yorke during a match at Blackburn Rovers&#x27; Ewood Park, and gave information to the police. Five local men were convicted and banned from football grounds over the abuse.

<text>Arthur Ernest Schlichter (, born April 25, 1960) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for four seasons with the Baltimore / Indianapolis Colts franchise. He also played one Canadian Football League (CFL) season with the Ottawa Rough Riders and three Arena Football League (AFL) seasons with the Detroit Drive and Cincinnati Rockers. A highly touted college football prospect with the Ohio State Buckeyes, Schlichter&#x27;s professional career was cut short by a gambling addiction that resulted in him facing legal trouble for nearly four decades.

Selected fourth overall in the 1982 NFL draft by the Colts, Schlichter appeared in only thirteen games with six starts due to his gambling problems. He found greater success in the AFL, where he was named Most Valuable Player and led the Drive to victory in ArenaBowl IV in 1990 but retired two years later amid allegations of betting on games. Schlichter continued to face legal problems after the end of his football career, including serving a ten-year prison sentence on gambling-related theft and public indecency charges between 2011 and 2021.

==Early life==
Art Schlichter was born in Bloomingburg, Ohio, on April 25, 1960. He played basketball and football at Miami Trace High School, where he showed enormous promise as a quarterback and never lost a game in thirty starts; his record was only blemished by one tie. Schlichter&#x27;s gambling habit began during this period with a visit to Scioto Downs, a harness racing track near Columbus, where he and several friends pooled their resources to bet and win on a race. He quickly became a regular, and Scioto Downs remained his favorite track over the years.

Schlichter was a four-year starter at the Ohio State University (OSU), the last starting quarterback for legendary Buckeyes coach Woody Hayes. According to Schlichter&#x27;s father, Hayes was so enthralled with the young quarterback that he was willing to jettison his &quot;three yards and a cloud of dust&quot; offense and throw as many as twenty-five times a game if Schlichter signed with the Buckeyes. Schlichter threw the interception that led to Hayes&#x27; assault on Clemson linebacker Charlie Bauman in the 1978 Gator Bowl, an act that led to the coach&#x27;s firing the next day.

In his four years as a Buckeye, between 1978 and 1981, Schlichter tallied 7,547 passing yards and fifty touchdown passes, with forty-six interceptions. He also rushed for 1,303 yards and thirty-five touchdowns. At the time, Schlichter was OSU&#x27;s all-time leader in total offense. He finished in the top six of Heisman Trophy balloting during his last three years—fourth as a sophomore, sixth as a junior and fifth as a senior. In his sophomore year, Schlichter led the Buckeyes to an undefeated regular season. They had a chance to win at least a share of the national championship in the 1980 Rose Bowl but lost to the USC Trojans by one point. In 1981, sportswriter Ritter Collett published a biography of Schlichter entitled &quot;Straight Arrow&quot;.

During his college career, Schlichter was frequently spotted at Scioto Downs with a prominent Ohio gambler. Although the Columbus and OSU police departments became suspicious, the athletic department felt it lacked enough evidence to notify the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Schlichter turned his attention from horses to sports betting by his junior year at OSU; by the end of that year he had lost thousands of dollars gambling on college and professional sports. On several occasions he was seen at Scioto Downs with Hayes&#x27; successor as head coach, Earle Bruce, a fact which helped cover up early problems emerging while Schlichter was at OSU.

==Professional career==
Schlichter was picked fourth in the 1982 NFL draft by the Colts franchise, then based in Baltimore, Maryland. Expected to be the starter, Schlichter lost the job to Mike Pagel, the Colts&#x27; fourth-round pick in that year, when he appeared at practice out of shape and in a distracted state of mind. However, he was expected to be the Colts&#x27; quarterback of the future.

Schlichter&#x27;s gambling continued unabated, to the point that he blew his entire $350,000 signing bonus by midseason. Even before the Colts picked him, he already owed bookies several thousand dollars. His gambling spiraled out of control during the 1982 NFL strike, when he lost $20,000 betting on college football. By the end of the strike, he had at least $700,000 in gambling debts. Years later, Schlichter said his massive losses stemmed from desperate efforts to make good his previous losses. After losing $20,000 in the first week of the strike, he doubled up the next week and lost again—starting a cycle that would continue for over a year.

Between the winter of 1982 and the spring of 1983, Schlichter lost $489,000 betting on basketball games. When bookies threatened to harm or expose Schlichter if he did not pay up (the NFL, like most major professional leagues, forbids its players from engaging in &quot;any&quot; kind of gambling activity, legal or otherwise), he went to the FBI in March 1983 and gave information that helped get the bookies arrested on federal charges. He also sought help from the NFL, as he feared the bookies would force him to throw games in return for not telling the Colts about his activities. The league suspended him indefinitely, but Commissioner Pete Rozelle reduced the suspension to thirteen months after Schlichter agreed to seek treatment for his gambling addiction. He was the first NFL player to be suspended for gambling since Alex Karras and Paul Hornung were suspended in 1963 for betting on NFL games.

Schlichter was reinstated for the 1984 season but later admitted that he&#x27;d gambled during his suspension (though not on football). He was released five games into the 1985 season, in part because the Colts heard rumors that he was gambling again. As it turned out, Schlichter had lost a significant amount of money over the spring and summer while playing golf and wrote one of his golfing partners a check for $2,000. The check was to be cashed after the season started. However, when the golfing partner contacted the Colts to see if the check was good, team and league officials feared Schlichter had relapsed. The NFL wanted Schlichter to take a polygraph test, but Colts coach Rod Dowhower had already seen enough and pushed the Colts front office to release him.

It would be Schlichter&#x27;s last meaningful action in the NFL. He signed as a free agent with the Buffalo Bills in the spring of 1986. However, his tenure with the Bills effectively ended when the United States Football League (USFL) collapsed. Jim Kelly, the Bills&#x27; 1983 first-round pick, had bolted to the USFL instead but signed with the Bills when the league &quot;won&quot; its antitrust lawsuit ($1.00 damages trebled to $3.00); the Bills had intended all along for Kelly to be their quarterback. With Kelly now firmly in the Bills fold, Schlichter&#x27;s services were no longer necessary. He sat out the 1986 season after no other team expressed interest.

In January 1987, Schlichter was arrested in New York City for his involvement in a multimillion-dollar sports betting operation. He pleaded guilty to illegal gambling in April and was sentenced to probation. That arrest came back to haunt him that summer. The Cincinnati Bengals saw enough promise in Schlichter that they were willing to bring him on as Boomer Esiason&#x27;s backup. However, Rozelle vetoed the deal, citing the January arrest. Rozelle let it be known that he would not approve any NFL contract for Schlichter that season, costing him valuable work when the National Football League Players Association went on strike that year. He made another bid for reinstatement in 1988 but was turned down. That same year, he filed for bankruptcy to shield himself from creditors.

In parts of three seasons, Schlichter played only thirteen games, primarily in backup or &quot;mop-up&quot; roles. He made only six starts, losing them all. He threw 202 passes and completed 91 of them. He threw three touchdown passes and eleven interceptions. He amassed a quarterback rating of only 42.6 and is considered one of the biggest draft busts in NFL history. In 2007, Schlichter was listed as the #7 all-time draft bust on the NFL Network&#x27;s Top 10 Draft Busts episode. In an updated list from 2010, Schlichter was moved to the #4 draft bust of all time, and in a video listing the top ten quarterback draft busts of all time, Schlichter was listed #3, behind JaMarcus Russell (#2) and Ryan Leaf (#1). In 2007, Charles Robinson of Yahoo! Sports named Schlichter the worst #4 pick since the AFL-NFL merger, writing that Colts fans long felt chagrin that Jim McMahon was taken by the Chicago Bears with the very next pick. McMahon would lead the Bears to victory in Super Bowl XX during Schlichter&#x27;s final NFL season. In 2021, &quot;The Athletic&quot; named Schlichter the worst #4 pick since the merger, noting that the Colts selected him with McMahon and future Hall of Fame running back Marcus Allen on the board.

Schlichter said years later that he was distracted for much of his NFL career. He went through a messy break-up with his girlfriend before his rookie season with the Colts, and the ensuing depression led him to gamble more. Schlichter believed the accolades he received after his sophomore year at OSU diminished his drive, and the pressure of living up to that praise led him to gamble as an outlet.

After spending 1987 out of football, Schlichter signed a contract with the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League (CFL) in 1988. He was named the starter out of camp and saw his first meaningful game action in three years. However, he suffered broken ribs from a hit midway through the season. The Rough Riders placed him on injured reserve for thirty days then released him.

Schlichter played for the Detroit Drive of the Arena Football League (AFL) in 1990 and 1991, where he was named MVP in the former en route to winning ArenaBowl IV. His AFL success was attributed to his frequent deep passes, which caught opposing defenses off guard in an era when most AFL offenses relied on short passes. Ahead the 1992 season, Schlichter was traded to the expansion Cincinnati Rockers, with league officials believing his popularity in Ohio would generate interest for the franchise. Schlichter helped lead the Rockers to the playoffs in their inaugural season, but announced he was retiring from football that October. Although he said he intended instead to focus on his radio career and curing his gambling addiction, evidence later came to light that Schlichter was forced to retire rather than face being banned from the league for betting on AFL games.

==Radio career==
While co-hosting a Rockers-focused radio show on Cincinnati station WSAI, Schlichter did well enough that he became the station&#x27;s afternoon drive-time host. He had been a communications major at OSU and had done some radio work in his high school and college days. During this time, he appeared on &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot; to discuss his gambling addiction. In 1994, Schlichter moved to KVEG in Las Vegas, Nevada, but was fired after a few months for stealing checks from station owner Jerry Kutner in order to support his addiction.

==Extent of addiction==
Schlichter often stole and conned money from friends and strangers when he ran low on funds to support his gambling. He also passed bad checks, as casinos still accepted personal checks when he started gambling. Schlichter wrote that he would write a check to the casino and use the money to gamble, believing he would win enough money to pay the casino back and keep the profit, but he almost always lost. In a 2007 interview for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Outside the Lines&quot;, he estimated that he&#x27;d stolen $1.5 million over the years, if not more.

Between 1987 and 1992, Schlichter was arrested three times in Ohio for passing a total of $50,000 in bad checks but received probation or suspended sentences each time. He moved to Las Vegas in 1989 after marrying longtime girlfriend Mitzi Shinaver. Schlichter claims this was in hopes of getting treatment for his addiction; however, his gambling continued unabated.

Schlichter ran up massive gambling debts while playing for the Detroit Drive, although general manager Gary Vitto helped pay some of them off. Vitto and owner Mike Ilitch tried their best to help Schlichter, keeping him on a budget and requiring him to attend meetings with therapists and Gamblers Anonymous. However, according to a 1995 profile of Schlichter in &quot;Columbus Monthly,&quot; things escalated to the point that even without the AFL wanting to give the expansion Rockers a shot in the arm, Schlichter would have had to leave Detroit for his own safety. Soon after arriving in Cincinnati, he was arrested in July for passing a bad check. Despite Schlichter&#x27;s admission to suffering a relapse, the Rockers were willing to work out a deal in which they put most of Schlichter&#x27;s paycheck into an account to pay his gambling debts, except for $300 which they gave to Mitzi. Even then, Schlichter&#x27;s gambling continued unabated; at various points in the 1992 season, there were police waiting for Schlichter in the locker room.

By the end of the 1992 season, the Rockers were losing patience with Schlichter and asked him to take a substantial pay cut if he wanted to return for the 1993 season. In a 2020 interview, former AFL commissioner Joe O&#x27;Hara said that around this time, Las Vegas oddsmaker Roxy Roxborough alerted league officials that Schlichter was betting on AFL games. When O&#x27;Hara learned this, he ordered the Rockers to release Schlichter. However, Schlichter was allowed to save face by publicly announcing his retirement.

The pattern continued during Schlichter&#x27;s time as a sports talk host. According to longtime Cincinnati radio personality Mike Wolfe, who worked with Schlichter at WSAI, Schlichter was known to try to wrangle money out of callers. Station management covered for Schlichter when a victim of one of his cons came after him. Kutner recalled that at KVEG, his penchant for bilking his friends and bouncing checks was a topic of on-air discussion.

The habit took a considerable toll on his marriage. Schlichter pawned off Mitzi&#x27;s wedding ring to get money to gamble, only to later discover it had been sold when he tried to get it back. He frequently stayed up late tracking scores; Mitzi often found him vomiting the next morning from what he claimed was the flu but was actually nerves. He also stole money from Mitzi as well.

Mitzi claims that, in order to protect herself and her children, she never allowed Schlichter to have a checkbook. She only reluctantly agreed to move with him to Las Vegas for a second time in 1994, warning him that it was his last chance. Schlichter&#x27;s father and other family members questioned the move, knowing that his real motivation was to gamble legally. Kutner also had doubts, knowing about Schlichter&#x27;s penchant for gambling. Soon after they arrived in Las Vegas, Schlichter took a box of old checks from his sister-in-law and used them to obtain money to gamble. He lost it all, and when it was apparent he couldn&#x27;t pay it back, the bank reported him to the FBI. Mitzi finally lost patience and took her two daughters back to Indiana. After losing hundreds of thousands of dollars, along with virtually all he owned, Schlichter went back to Indiana as well in hopes of reconciling with his wife.

Soon afterward, in October, Schlichter was charged with fraud for passing $175,000 in bad checks at Las Vegas casinos, many of which he&#x27;d stolen from Kutner. He&#x27;d passed most of the checks at Treasure Island. When he pleaded guilty, federal prosecutors were initially willing to offer a deal that would let Schlichter self-report to a federal prison camp for a sentence of fifteen months. However, when prosecutors learned that he&#x27;d been passing bad checks in Indiana as well, they persuaded a judge to remand him to custody. In January 1995, Schlichter was sentenced to two years in prison. Prosecutors later discovered Schlichter had passed $500,000 in bad checks in Indiana, Nevada and his native Ohio.

Schlichter was released in April 1996 after serving sixteen months, only to be arrested that fall for stealing checks from his employer and using them to get $8,500 to gamble. This time, he was sentenced to eight years in federal prison. Mitzi formally divorced him soon afterward, in 1998. He was released on probation in 1999 after serving thirteen months and returned home to Bloomingburg, where he told friends that he still had connections to get prime tickets for OSU football games. He told others that if they fronted him the money to buy the tickets, he would share the profits, but instead used the money to gamble. Schlichter ultimately stole $500,000 from a dozen individuals—including his father—before he was arrested, pled guilty and sentenced to five years in prison.

Between 1995 and 2006, Schlichter served the equivalent of ten years in forty-four different county jails and federal prisons. Counting time served while awaiting sentencing, he spent all but 358 days between November 1994 and June 2006 behind bars. During that time, he also had his public defender, Linda Wagoner, smuggle a cell phone into the Marion County, Indiana, jail so he could place bets. Wagoner was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation and had her law license suspended for ninety days.

Schlichter later said that he hit rock bottom in 2004 after he was caught gambling in prison and placed in solitary confinement. He was originally supposed to spend four months there, but was released after 100 days for good behavior. Schlichter was released from prison on June 16, 2006, and resided with his mother in Washington Court House, Ohio. By one estimate, he owed half a million dollars in restitution.

Schlichter founded a non-profit organization, Gambling Prevention Awareness, to educate others about the perils of problem gambling, including college and NFL players. In late 2009, Schlichter and his mother appeared in television ads opposing a statewide ballot issue legalizing casinos in select cities of Ohio. He also wrote an autobiography, &quot;Busted&quot;, with sportswriter Jeff Snook. Also in 2009, he began working at Columbus radio station WTVN, joining longtime host John Corby on Wednesdays.

==2011 arrest==
Around the same time, Schlichter visited a church in Westerville, Ohio, to speak about his addiction. There, he reunited with Anita Valko Barney, a Columbus heiress and the widow of a former CEO of Wendy&#x27;s. Her son, Alan Valko, had been gravely injured in a 1981 plane crash that killed his father and three others; Barney believed that Alan&#x27;s recovery was due in large part to Schlichter visiting his bedside. Over the next two-plus years, Schlichter conned over a million dollars out of Barney, nearly depleting her fortune.

On February 9, 2011, reports emerged that Schlichter was under investigation for fraud. It subsequently emerged that Schlichter had conned thousands of dollars under the pretense of buying prime seats at OSU football games. He was charged with a first-degree felony in connection with the theft of more than $1 million on February 14, 2011.

Prosecutors later said that Schlichter resumed his gambling almost as soon as he had left prison in 2006. They discovered he&#x27;d visited gambling dens in Nevada, Indiana, West Virginia and riverboat casinos along the Ohio River. Schlichter also relaunched his ticket-buying scheme as early as 2009. Corby recalled that in that year, Schlichter had suggested that he had connections to get OSU basketball tickets. Corby almost went along but thought better of it after his wife noticed it was very similar to a scheme Schlichter described in his autobiography. As it turned out, Schlichter got tickets from brokers across central Ohio, often paying four times face value. As the scheme went along, Schlichter forced Barney to solicit her wealthy friends for money and help him buy tickets.

By late 2010, Schlichter sensed he was nearing the end of his tether. In a desperate attempt to stem the tide, he promised to get tickets for Super Bowl XLV. However, when that scheme collapsed, Schlichter turned himself in on February 9, 2011. He subsequently admitted that he &quot;probably&quot; used part of the money to gamble.

On September 15, 2011, Schlichter pleaded guilty to state charges of theft and engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. He was sentenced to ten years in state prison. A month later, on October 11, he pleaded guilty to federal charges of wire fraud, bank fraud and filing a false tax return. Schlichter admitted to using the money he obtained from the ticket scam to either gamble, pay back previous debts, or buy personal items. He also admitted to falsifying his 2008 tax return and hiding almost $38,500 in income from the U.S. government.

While under house arrest awaiting assignment to a state prison, Schlichter tested positive for cocaine while serving house arrest on federal charges resulting from the same case (and while still on probation from his Indiana sentence) on January 19, 2012. On May 4, 2012, as a result of the positive drug test, he was sentenced to ten years, seven months in federal prison (up from an original eight years, four months originally agreed to on the fraud case) to be served concurrently with the Ohio sentence, plus $2.2 million in restitution; the Indiana probation was canceled with the federal sentence.

Barney admitted her role in the scheme and cooperated with prosecutors and law enforcement to bring Schlichter down. She was later sentenced to three years&#x27; probation. She was also ordered to pay $400,000 in restitution, forcing her to auction off nearly everything she owned and give up her house. In 2015, Barney published a book, &quot;Quarterback Sneak&quot;, recounting her experiences with Schlichter. She wrote that Schlichter likely set his sights on her soon after they met. She believes that in hindsight, she missed a number of red flags about Schlichter&#x27;s story; while he talked a lot about the impact his addiction had on him, he never mentioned his wife and children.

Schlichter was incarcerated at FCI Williamsburg in Salters, South Carolina, and later spent time at FCI Florence in Florence, Colorado. According to &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot;, he continued to gamble while in prison, having women place bets for him and running a Super Bowl ticket scheme. When prison officials learned about it, they cut off his email access for ninety days. Schlichter was released from federal prison on August 18, 2020, and transferred to Ohio state custody to serve the remainder of his sentence.

Schlichter&#x27;s lawyers had attempted to get the remainder of his sentence waived for health reasons. However, Franklin County Common Pleas judge Chris Brown took a dim view of the request, saying that Schlichter was &quot;past the point of rehabilitation&quot; and had not shown that he would &quot;conduct (himself appropriately)&quot; if released. Brown added that he was sympathetic to Schlichter&#x27;s health concerns, and would have been more than willing to grant an early release if there was any evidence of remorse. However, Brown said, Schlichter had &quot;demonstrated over and over&quot; that he could not be trusted.

Schlichter, Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction inmate #A777924, was incarcerated at Ohio State Penitentiary in Youngstown. He was paroled on June 14, 2021; his second day of eligibility.

==Further arrests==
On June 6, 2022, Schlichter was found unresponsive by police at the Hampton Inn in Hilliard, Ohio. Police, who were responding to a report of an overdose, used Narcan to resuscitate Schlichter and took him to a hospital. A substance was found in his room which was later revealed to be cocaine after testing. Schlichter pleaded guilty and was subsequently charged with cocaine possession on October 11, being sentenced to one year of probation on September 13, 2023.

A few months later, on February 2, 2024, an Ohio Highway Patrol officer found Schlichter on a street in Columbus, standing beside his disabled vehicle. The officer would discover drug paraphernalia on the car&#x27;s floorboard. Schlichter was subsequently searched and handed over a pair of glass pipes. He was arrested and charged with cocaine possession, as well as possessing drug paraphernalia. An arraignment hearing has not yet been completed. If this arrest is found to be in violation of his probation, Schlichter will face an eleven-month prison sentence.

==Health issues==
Doctors have diagnosed Schlichter with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and dementia—the side effects of numerous concussions (between fifteen and seventeen, depending on the source) suffered over twenty years of football at the junior high, high school, college and professional levels. His public defender in the 2011 case, Steven Nolder, said that Schlichter has been diagnosed with &quot;deficits&quot; in his frontal lobes, which have been linked to depression, impulsivity and impaired judgment. According to Snook, doctors believe that Schlichter has chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative disease caused by repeated blows to the head which has been found to be common among football players. Protective equipment (especially helmets) was inferior during much of Schlichter&#x27;s high school, collegiate and NFL days. Even during his CFL and Arena League days, concussions and head injuries were just considered part of the game.

==In popular culture==
Schlichter was mentioned in the 2006 &quot;Prison Break&quot; episode &quot;By the Skin and the Teeth&quot; and in 2017 was the subject of Season 11, Episode 14 of &quot;American Greed&quot; titled &quot;Art Schlichter, All American Fraud.&quot;

<text>Samuel Udoka Oji (9 October 1985 – 28 August 2021) was an English professional footballer who played as a centre-back.

Oji played in the Football League for Doncaster Rovers, Bristol Rovers, Leyton Orient and Hereford United, and in the Swedish Superettan for Ljungskile SK, before knee injuries kept him out of football for two years. He resumed his career with Tamworth of the Conference Premier. He then played in the League of Ireland for Limerick and Galway United and in non-league football for Worcester City and Hednesford Town. Oji joined Highgate United in 2018, and was appointed assistant manager of that club in July 2021.

==Life and career==
Oji was born in Westminster, London. He was a cousin of R&amp;B/soul singer Lemar. He began his football career as a youth player at Arsenal.

===Birmingham City===

Oji signed a full-time contract with Birmingham City for the start of the 2004–05 season. In 2005–06 he spent six weeks on loan at Doncaster Rovers, for whom he made his debut in the Football League as a 75th-minute substitute for Ricky Ravenhill in a 1–0 away loss against Gillingham on 6 December.

On 7 February 2006 he made his only first-team appearance for Birmingham, in an FA Cup fourth round replay at home to Reading. He came on as a last-minute substitute for Stephen Clemence in a 2–1 win.

A year later he joined Bristol Rovers on a month&#x27;s loan, later extended to two months. In the summer of 2007 he had a trial with Southend United, then in August signed for Leyton Orient on a month&#x27;s loan, later extended to three months.

===Leyton Orient===
With six months remaining on his contract, Oji left Birmingham by mutual consent on 8 January 2008 and joined Leyton Orient until the end of the 2007–08 season. He was released by Orient at the end of the season.

===Hereford United===
Oji signed for League One club Hereford United on 7 August 2008. After five games for the club he suffered a knee injury which kept him out of training for four months; he never regained his first-team place and at the end of his short-term contract, in February 2009, he was released.

===Ljungskile SK===
In March 2009 Oji joined Ljungskile SK of the Superettan (Swedish second division) after a successful trial. He played only six league games for Ljungskile before leaving in June.
In August, Oji had a trial with Tranmere Rovers, but cruciate ligament injuries suffered while on trials with Turkish Süper Lig side Diyarbakirspor and with Leyton Orient kept him out of football for two years.

===Tamworth===
In December 2011, Oji signed for Conference Premier club Tamworth. He made his debut as a second-half substitute in the first match of 2012, a 2–2 draw at home to Alfreton Town. He was sent off for two bookable offences in a league match against Fleetwood Town on 4 February 2012.

===League of Ireland===
Oji signed for League of Ireland club Limerick on 26 August 2013, and made his debut for the club in a 2–0 away defeat to Sligo Rovers. In February 2015, he moved to Galway United in the same league.

===Return to England===
Worcester City signed Oji ahead of the opening fixture of the 2016–17 National League North season. The following summer he moved to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Hednesford Town. He made 41 appearances over the season, of which 38 were in league competition, before signing for Highgate United of the Midland League Premier Division in July 2018.

Oji was appointed assistant to Simon Johnson, new manager of Highgate United, on 20 July 2021.

==Death==
Oji died on 28 August 2021 at the age of 35; a day earlier, Highgate United had stated that he was &quot;extremely ill&quot;. He was married and had two children.

<doc id="1339948" wikidata="Q3507079" url="?curid=1339948" title="Turnabout Intruder">
<text>&quot;Turnabout Intruder&quot; is the twenty-fourth and final episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Arthur H. Singer (based on a story by Gene Roddenberry) and directed by Herb Wallerstein, it was first broadcast on June 3, 1969.

In the episode, a woman switches bodies with Captain Kirk and then tries to take over command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

Originally scheduled to air at 10pm on Friday, March 28, 1969, NBC pre-empted it with a special report on former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had died earlier that day. On June 3, 1969, after an absence of two months, &quot;Star Trek&quot; was brought back on a new night and time: Tuesdays at 7:30pm. &quot;Turnabout Intruder&quot; was the only first-run episode to be shown in this new time slot.

This was the last original episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; to air on NBC.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; answers a distress call from the planet Camus II, the site of an archaeological expedition. Among the survivors are Dr. Janice Lester, with whom Captain Kirk was once intimately involved, and the expedition&#x27;s physician, Dr. Arthur Coleman. Coleman claims that Lester is suffering from radiation exposure.

While Lester and Kirk are alone they reminisce about their time together at Starfleet Academy. Lester blames sexism within Starfleet for her failure to become captain. When Kirk explores the room, she activates an alien machine that traps and paralyzes him. She then enters the machine herself and the machine switches their life-entity. The new &quot;Kirk&quot; declares that he will take command of the Enterprise and begins to strangle &quot;Lester&quot; but the returning Spock and McCoy interrupt him.

Back on the ship, over McCoy&#x27;s protests, &quot;Kirk&quot; gives Dr. Coleman full authority for treatment of &quot;Lester&quot; and it is revealed that Lester and Coleman conspired to kill the expedition&#x27;s personnel.

Spock becomes suspicious when &quot;Kirk&quot; orders a course change to the Benecia Colony to drop off &quot;Lester&quot; for medical attention, despite the fact that Benecia&#x27;s medical facilities are comparatively primitive, and that it would unnecessarily interfere with their current mission. McCoy invokes his authority to order a medical examination of the captain, including a personality test.

&quot;Lester&quot; regains consciousness and seeks help from Spock and McCoy. &quot;Kirk&quot; slaps her back into unconsciousness, and orders her to be put in isolation. Spock interviews &quot;Lester&quot; and is somewhat skeptical of her story. &quot;Lester&quot; suggests that he use his telepathic abilities to learn the truth, and he is convinced.

Spock tries to free &quot;Lester&quot; but is stopped by a security team led by the impostor Kirk, who accuses Spock of mutiny and orders a court-martial. Once on trial, Spock argues that Captain Kirk is really in the body of Dr. Lester. &quot;Kirk&quot; suggests that Spock&#x27;s real goal is to take command himself and offers to drop charges if Spock will desist. Spock refuses, and &quot;Kirk&quot; flies into a hysterical rage.

Shocked by Kirk&#x27;s behavior, McCoy and Chief Engineer Scott confer secretly in the corridor. Scott believes that if Spock is acquitted, the &quot;captain&quot; will not let the decision stand, making it necessary to mutiny. &quot;Kirk&quot;, having monitored their conversation, declares McCoy, Scott, Spock, and &quot;Lester&quot; guilty of mutiny and condemned to death.

On the bridge, Chekov and Sulu, having witnessed the trial, determine to resist the &quot;captain&quot;, and refuse to obey his orders. Loudly accusing them of mutiny, &quot;Kirk&quot; falls into his chair, and an image of Lester emerges from his body, only to return again. &quot;Kirk&quot; runs to Coleman, who tells him that the transfer is reversing itself, and that Kirk, in Lester&#x27;s body, must die in order to prevent it. The two head to the brig intending to inject &quot;Lester”&quot;with a toxic substance. &quot;Lester&quot; resists, and the reversal now completes itself. Realizing she has lost her triple attempt to kill Kirk, destroy her female gender, and gain the ability to command a starship, she suffers a complete mental breakdown; the hysterical Lester begs Coleman to kill Kirk. Coleman then pleads with Kirk to allow him to care for her. Coleman and Lester are escorted to Sickbay. Kirk, Spock, and Scotty proceed to the Bridge and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; proceeds on its mission.

==Production==
&quot;Turnabout Intruder&quot; not only marked the final appearance of all main and supporting cast members of the show but also the last appearance of regular background actors David L. Ross (Lieutenant Galloway), William Blackburn (Lieutenant Hadley and DeForest Kelley&#x27;s stand-in), and Roger Holloway (Lieutenant Lemli and James Doohan&#x27;s stand-in). Blackburn had appeared in more episodes than cast members George Takei and Walter Koenig, and Holloway&#x27;s appearances were only two episodes short of Koenig. Ross had been a background actor since the first season.

Nichelle Nichols (Lieutenant Uhura) was absent from this episode. The position of Communications Officer was played by Barbara Baldavin, who had previously appeared in two first-season episodes of the show, &quot;Balance of Terror&quot; and &quot;Shore Leave&quot;.

As noted in the 1975 book &quot;Star Trek Lives!&quot; by co-author Joan Winston, William Shatner was sick with flu during the filming of the episode (Winston was on set for six days of filming).

Filming of the episode was completed on January 9, 1969 having gone one day over schedule; a few days earlier, the crew had been notified of the cancellation of the show. The episode aired in the United States on June 3, 1969.

==Reception==
The episode drew Nielsen ratings of only 8.8, in contrast to rival shows &quot;Lancer&quot; on CBS and &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; on ABC, which gained ratings of 14.7 and 15.2 respectively, a drop of over fifty percent since the show premiered.

Cultural theorist Cassandra Amesley states that this episode is &quot;agreed to be one of the worst Star Trek episodes ever shown&quot; by &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans.

David Greven has a more positive view of the episode, even referring to it as &quot;moving&quot;. He calls it the &quot;infamous last episode&quot; of the original series, in part because of the &quot;campiness&quot; of Shatner&#x27;s performance when portraying himself as a female in a male&#x27;s body, but also because of the sexist premise that &quot;female desire for power was a clear sign of insanity.&quot;

In 2016, CNET ranked this episode as the fourth-worst episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot;, based on rankings between an audience and discussion hosts at a 50th anniversary Star Trek convention in Las Vegas.

In 2017, this episode was rated the fourth worst episode of the Star Trek franchise including later spin-off series, by &quot;ScreenRant&quot;. A ranking of every episode of the original series by &quot;Hollywood&quot;, placed this episode as worst. 
In 2017, Den of Geek ranked this episode as the seventh worst &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode of the original series.

The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at the volcanic planet of Excalbia to conduct a geological survey. Impossibly, sensors detect carbon-based life on the planet&#x27;s surface. The image of Abraham Lincoln drifts toward the ship on the viewscreen. Though skeptical that the figure is the real President, Kirk extends full presidential honors as he transports aboard the ship.

Lincoln appears human, has no knowledge of technology past the 19th century, but is somehow familiar with the Vulcan philosophy of &quot;Nome&quot; (meaning &quot;all&quot;, and showing respect for the diversity of factors making up existence). Lincoln&#x27;s mentioning Nome follows his calling Uhura a &quot;negress&quot; and apologizing; Uhura says she is not offended, since in her century, people respect who they are, and are not offended by words.

Lincoln invites Kirk and Spock to accompany him down to the planet where an area has appeared with Earth-like conditions. Despite the possibility that the livable conditions are an illusion, Kirk accepts, reasoning that the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s mission demands they accept any offer of contact with new life.

Once on the planet, Kirk and Spock discover their tricorder and phasers did not transport with them. They are met by Surak, &quot;the father of Vulcan civilization&quot;, who died centuries before.

A rock-like being with clawed hands and multiple glowing eyes atop a bulbous head, named Yarnek, announces that the inhabitants of the planet wish to conduct an experiment to determine which human philosophy is stronger: good or evil. In this experiment, treacherous Earth warlord Colonel Phillip Green, Klingon warlord Kahless, a practitioner of unethical experiments on humanoids named Zora, and Genghis Khan, together representing evil, will be pitted against Kirk, Spock, Lincoln, and Surak (representing good) in a fight to the death.

Colonel Green offers Kirk an alliance against the Excalbians so that they can all safely return to where they came from, but this is only a distraction for a surprise attack. Kirk and his companions fend off their opponents and run for cover. The &quot;good&quot; group remain resolved that the Excalbians are the true enemy; Kirk attacks Yarnek, but the alien&#x27;s body is too hot to touch. To force them to fight, Yarnek breaks down the shielding between the matter and anti-matter on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, ensuring the ship will explode unless Kirk&#x27;s force emerges victorious in four hours.

Kirk and the others begin to manufacture spears. Surak, whose life experiences have taught him that persistent efforts at peace are the best course, obtains permission to go alone to the enemy camp and negotiate. Green&#x27;s group kills Surak and lures the others in by mimicking Surak crying for help. Lincoln offers to sneak around and free Surak while Kirk and Spock provide a diversion. When Lincoln arrives, he finds Surak&#x27;s corpse and the waiting Kahless and Green, who fatally wound him; he staggers towards Kirk and Spock, telling them to beware, then falls dead, a spear in his back.

Though now outnumbered two-to-one, when Kirk and Spock confront Green&#x27;s group in battle, they quickly flee after Kirk kills Kahless and Green. Despite the conditions of a fight to the death remaining unfulfilled, Yarnek announces that the experiment is over. He concludes that there is nothing different between good and evil because the methods used to fight each other are the same. Kirk explains that the similar methods of how the two fight each other does not define them as the same since Yarnek set the conditions. What defines them is the things for which each of them fight - Kirk and Spock were fighting for the survival of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;; the others fought only for power.

The Excalbians allow Kirk and Spock to return to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Though the mystery of Lincoln and Surak remains unsolved, Spock offers the conjecture that the Excalbians, using their apparent ability to transform matter, transformed other living beings into the likenesses of Lincoln and Surak, then tapped Kirk and Spock&#x27;s minds to create the personalities which they imagined those historical figures had. Kirk notes that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; may be carrying on the work of Lincoln and Surak, before the ship leaves the Excalbia solar system.

==Reception==
In 2017, Screen Rant ranked this episode the 12th worst episode of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise and in 2018 ranked it as the 9th worst.

<text>Mount Roots is a mainly snow-covered mountain on South Georgia, standing near the head of Nordenskjold Glacier, ESE of Mount Paget. Its western peak rises to ; its eastern peak to . The mountain, fifth-highest on the island, is a prominent feature and presumably was known to whalers and sealers in South Georgia at an early date.

It was roughly surveyed in the period 1925–30 by DI personnel, and resurveyed by the SGS, 1951–52. Named by the UK-APC for James W. Roots, a member of the SGS, 1951–52.

The first ascent was made by British climbers Will Manners and Stuart Macdonald on the north buttress in January 2001.

<doc id="1339966" wikidata="Q3507065" url="?curid=1339966" title="The Way to Eden">
<text>&quot;The Way to Eden&quot; is the twentieth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The episode was written by Arthur Heinemann, based on a story by Heinemann and D. C. Fontana (using the pen name &quot;Michael Richards&quot;). It was directed by David Alexander, and first broadcast on February 21, 1969.

In the episode, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is hijacked by a hippie-like group obsessed with finding a mythical paradise.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; is in pursuit of the stolen space cruiser &quot;Aurora&quot;. In trying to escape, the &quot;Aurora&quot; overloads its engines and its six passengers are safely beamed aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot; just as the &quot;Aurora&quot; explodes. The group consists of Tongo Rad, son of the Catullan ambassador; Irina Galliulin, an acquaintance of Ensign Chekov; Dr. Sevrin, a noted electronics, acoustics, and communications researcher; Adam, a musician; and two other women.

In responses to Kirk&#x27;s questions, Dr. Sevrin says their destination is the planet &quot;Eden&quot;, which Kirk responds is a myth. The group refuses to co-operate with Kirk, but are impressed by First Officer Spock, who is familiar with their social movement. They are persuaded to go to Sickbay for a medical examination which reveals the party to be in good health, except for Sevrin, who is an asymptomatic carrier of a bacterium. Sevrin is quarantined in the brig. He admits to being aware of this, and believes it to be a product of artificial environments, and tells Spock that the planet Eden will somehow &quot;cleanse&quot; him. Spock attempts to reason with Sevrin and offers to help him find Eden in exchange for his cooperation, but concludes that Sevrin is not sane.

The rest of the group plan to take over the ship. After putting on a music concert including Spock, during which Rad frees Sevrin, the group takes over Auxiliary Control and puts the &quot;Enterprise&quot; on course for Eden. On arrival at the planet, Sevrin renders all &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew unconscious with an ultrasonic frequency broadcast through the intercom.

When the crew regain consciousness, they discover that Sevrin and his followers have stolen a shuttlecraft. Kirk deactivates Sevrin&#x27;s sonic device, and then joins Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, and Chekov in a search for the group.

The planet surface is lush and beautiful. However, all the plant life secretes a powerful acid, as Chekov discovers when he touches a flower. The team soon finds Adam, lying dead from poisonous fruit. Sevrin and the other survivors are then found in the shuttlecraft, all with chemical burns on their feet. Kirk says they must leave, but Sevrin runs from the shuttle, bites into one of the fruits, and dies.

Back on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Irina comes to the bridge to say goodbye to Chekov. Spock advises her and her friends not to give up their search for Eden, as he believes they will either find it, or create one for themselves.

==Production==

Originally, the teleplay was titled &quot;Joanna&quot;, and was written by D. C. Fontana, the title character being Dr. McCoy&#x27;s daughter, who would become romantically involved with Captain Kirk. Later, she was changed to Irina, and Chekov was made her foil. Fontana&#x27;s script was so heavily rewritten that she asked for her name to be removed from it and replaced with her pseudonym Michael Richards, which she also used for the episode &quot;That Which Survives&quot;.

In a 2009 interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Charles Napier recalled auditioning for the part of Adam, which was his first guest starring role. He won the part by jumping onto a table and singing &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; in front of others trying for the part.

==Reception==
The episode has generally been seen as one of the weakest in the show&#x27;s history, but its portrayal of characters representing the counterculture of the 1960s has produced widespread comment. Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &#x27;C−&#x27; rating, describing the &quot;space hippie&quot; characters as &quot;too strange and irritating for me to view them sympathetically&quot; and finding fault with the singing, which he described as &quot;the worst kind of padding&quot;. Handlen noted as a positive aspect that the episode did allow for the voice of dissent against the &quot;utopia&quot; portrayed by &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In their compendium of &quot;Star Trek&quot; reviews, &quot;Trek Navigator&quot;, Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross both viewed the episode negatively, describing it as having aged badly because of the hippie characters and also noting the poor musical parts of the episode. Grace Lee Whitney, who had played Janice Rand in early episodes of the show, described the episode as a &quot;clinker&quot; on a par with another third season episode &quot;Spock&#x27;s Brain;&quot; and actor James Doohan, who portrayed Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott, often called it &quot;a nothing episode&quot;.

Several writers have discussed the way the episode represents the &quot;space hippies&quot;. Aniko Bodroghkozy touched on the topic in her book &quot;Groove Tube: Sixties Television and the Youth Rebellion&quot;. In it, Bodroghkozy noted a negative and positive portrayal; on one hand Sevrin&#x27;s followers have been duped and must return to &quot;civilization, apparently contrite, chastened children&quot;. On the other, they challenged the supposed benefits and superiority of the Federation, which Bodroghkozy described as a &quot;reading of the counterculture&quot;. Timothy Brown argues that Dr. Sevrin is &quot;a clear stand-in for Timothy Leary&quot;. Like the acolytes of Leary, Charles Manson, and other counter-culture leaders, Sevrin&#x27;s followers are &quot;under the spell of charismatic but dangerously unhinged leaders&quot; and &quot;stand for a sixties generation in the thrall of misled idealism&quot;.

In 2015, Wired magazine suggested this episode was skippable in their binge-watching guide for the original series.

In 2017, Den of Geek ranked this episode as the number one &quot;best worst&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode of the original series, noting its unique entertainment value.

In 2016, TVline ranked this as having one of the top twenty moments of Star Trek, in this case the &quot;space hippie&quot; concert in the Enterprise sick bay.

In 2024 &quot;Hollywood.com&quot; ranked The Way to Eden at number 75 out of the 79 original series episodes noting &quot;it could be a Muppet Show parody&quot;.

==Legacy==

===In &quot;Star Trek&quot;===
The original script, as written by Fontana, would have provided much background on McCoy, including an unsuccessful marriage which led him into Starfleet (which was later incorporated into the alternate reality of the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;). Joanna herself was mentioned in the animated &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Survivor&quot;. Ms McCoy&#x27;s backstory was later incorporated into the non-canonical novels &quot;Planet of Judgment&quot;, &quot;Shadows on the Sun&quot;, &quot;Crisis on Centaurus&quot;, and also in the Marvel Comics &quot;Star Trek&quot; book (1980), married to a Vulcan and still hostile to her father. The McCoy of the alternate reality&#x27;s backstory-minus Joanna-was also featured in an issue of the continuation comic book based on the alternate realty, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, published by IDW from 2009 to 2013.

In a 2009 interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Charles Napier recalled being invited to star again on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, as part of an anniversary celebration. He agreed to appear only if he could play a military character and not &quot;wear that silly shirt again&quot;. His next &quot;Star Trek&quot; character would be General Denning in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Little Green Men&quot;.

===In music===
Deborah Downey, who played the blonde singer &quot;Girl #1&quot;, co-wrote the music with Charles Napier (Adam). She released a version of the song &quot;Heading Into Eden&quot; on her album &quot;Painting Pictures&quot;.

Dialogue from the episode was sampled in the song &quot;Starface&quot; (1992) by American heavy-metal band White Zombie, and in the track &quot;One&quot; (2010) by the Swedish goa / psytrance artist Trinodia. McCoy&#x27;s line &quot;All this plant life is full of acid, even the grass&quot; provided the title for the debut album by Alice&#x27;s Orb: &quot;Even The Grass Is Full Of Acid&quot; (1992). The song &quot;Long time back when the galaxy was new&quot;, sung by Adam and Mavig during the concert, has been covered by Gaye Bykers on Acid on their 2001 album &quot;Everything&#x27;s Groovy&quot;, under the title &quot;Golf Trek&quot;.

== Releases ==
This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993 as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;. A trailer for this and the other episodes was also included, and the episode had English and Japanese audio tracks. The cover script was スター・トレック TVサードシーズン 

This episode was included in TOS Season 3 remastered DVD box set, with the remastered version of this episode.

<text>Smiltynė () is a part of Klaipėda city municipality in Lithuania. It is located on the northern tip of the Curonian Spit, next to , which is at the very tip of the spit pointing into the narrow strait which connects the Curonian Lagoon to the Baltic Sea. Across the strait, on the Lithuanian mainland, is the port city of Klaipėda. Ferries transport vehicles and people daily between the two cities across the strait, as there is no connecting bridge. Smiltynė serves as a public beach for Klaipėda residents, as ports take up the coastline around Klaipėda.

The village began as a travel point between Memel (present-day Klaipėda) and Königsberg (present-day Kaliningrad). Travelers would stay to rest or wait for better weather to cross the strait. Smiltynė is first mentioned in 1429. An inn and tavern were built in 1525. It largely depends on travelers for revenue, and thus was hurt during the wars of the 19th and 20th century. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the village was just an inn with a handful of fishermen&#x27;s houses, but later turned into a popular resort among wealthy residents of Klaipėda.

Smiltynė became part of the Klaipėda municipality in 1897, and soon afterwards it became legal to sell land to individuals. In 1901 a large, luxurious, and popular two-storey hotel with a restaurant and casino was built and was named the Kurhaus; other villas were built as well. However, after World War II, the luxury lifestyle of the village came to an end. Many older buildings have survived to this day, most having been refurbished. Most of the populace moved away as well, and today only about fifty full-time residents remain.

North of Smiltynė is a small cemetery, used before World War II. The village also has a nature museum, which educates visitors about the geology, changing landscape, and unique fauna and flora of the spit. Just a few hundred meters away from the Kurhaus there is pier big enough to accommodate up to 100 yachts. With a modern hotel and restaurant, it is a popular spot for international yachters.

<text>&quot;The Cloud Minders&quot; is the twenty-first episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Margaret Armen (based on a story by David Gerrold and Oliver Crawford) and directed by Jud Taylor, it was first broadcast on February 28, 1969.

In the episode, Captain Kirk races against time to acquire plague-fighting minerals from a world suffering from a grievous social class disparity.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at the planet Ardana to take on a shipment of zenite, needed elsewhere to halt a botanical plague. Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock beam directly to the zenite mines, where a group of miners, led by a young woman, attempt to take them hostage. High Advisor Plasus arrives with a security force, driving the miners off, and invites Kirk and Spock to return with him to the floating city of Stratos.

Kirk and Spock are entertained as guests until the zenite can be recovered. They learn Ardanan society is divided between the Troglytes, who perform all physical labor, and city-dwellers who live in luxury. A group of Troglytes known as the Disruptors are rebelling against the elites.

While Kirk is resting, Vanna, leader of the Disrupters, attempts to take him hostage. Kirk overpowers her, recognizes her as the woman he saw at the mine and questions her. She accuses the Stratos city-dwellers of using the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to intimidate the Troglytes. Spock and a Stratos security guard arrive, and Vanna is subdued. She is then taken for interrogation under the &quot;rays&quot;, which induce intense pain as a form of torture. Kirk is outraged by Plasus&#x27;s actions and demands the interrogation be stopped. Plasus instead orders Kirk and Spock to leave Stratos immediately and forbids them to return.

The two return to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; where Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy reports that unprocessed zenite emits an odorless, invisible gas which diminishes mental capacity and heightens emotions. Spock believes that Troglytes serving aboard the floating city have been spared the effects of the gas, enabling them to organize the rebellion.

Kirk contacts Plasus and offers special masks that filter the zenite gas. Plasus, however, regards Kirk&#x27;s proposal as unwarranted interference in his government&#x27;s affairs. Kirk then beams down to Vanna&#x27;s holding cell, informs her of the effects of zenite gas, and makes his offer to her. Vanna is skeptical at first but appears to trust him, and she and Kirk escape and return to the zenite mines. Once there, however, she orders Kirk seized by two other Disruptors.

Vanna&#x27;s friends depart, and she puts Kirk to work digging for zenite. After a short while Kirk attacks her, regains his phaser, and fires at the ceiling of the mine, causing a cave-in that traps them. He then contacts the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and orders Plasus to be beamed to his location. An indignant Plasus is beamed in, and Kirk forces him and Vanna to dig for zenite. The effects of the zenite gas become apparent as Kirk and Plasus become increasingly irritable. A brawl between them breaks out, and Vanna, finally believing Kirk&#x27;s story of the gas, signals the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for help.

Back in the city, the zenite consignment is prepared for transport. Plasus has grudgingly allowed the distribution of the filter masks, and Vanna declares that her people&#x27;s struggle for equality will continue.

==Production and reception==
Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &#x27;C+&#x27; rating, noting that it &quot;had enough story that it didn&#x27;t drag too terribly near the end&quot; but that &quot;philosophy-wise, it chickened out in a way that&#x27;s highly unusual for the show&quot;.

The episode is noted for depicting a city in the clouds.

==Influence==
Manny Coto, showrunner of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, stated in an interview for StarTrek.com that he had wanted to feature the cloud city of Stratos in the fourth season of that series, saying, &quot;There was one I really wanted to do set on Stratos, the Cloud City [from &quot;The Cloud Minders&quot;]. I really wanted to do a two-parter on that location, to see Stratos in its earlier stages.&quot;

<doc id="1339970" wikidata="Q3506721" url="?curid=1339970" title="The Lights of Zetar">
<text>&quot;The Lights of Zetar&quot; is the eighteenth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Jeremy Tarcher and his wife Shari Lewis and directed by Herb Kenwith, it was first broadcast on January 31, 1969.

In the episode, strange incorporeal aliens threaten the Memory Alpha station and the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; is en route to Memory Alpha, a planetoid that is home to the Federation&#x27;s central library. A storm-like phenomenon moving at warp speed is also on course to the planetoid. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; intercepts the storm, which enters the ship, affecting some crew members&#x27; nervous systems. Lieutenant Mira Romaine, who has been assigned to Memory Alpha, faints from the effects of the storm. Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy examines Romaine, who seems unresponsive apart from making strange guttural sounds.

The storm proceeds to Memory Alpha, with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in pursuit, and destroys the station&#x27;s computer core. Captain Kirk, along with Science Officer Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Mr. Scott beam to the station to inspect the damage. Meanwhile, Romaine has visions of corpses at Memory Alpha. The landing party finds Memory Alpha&#x27;s archives seriously damaged, and its staff dead, save one who makes the same guttural noises as Romaine, and then dies from what McCoy determines to be a brain hemorrhage. Kirk has Romaine beamed to the station. She is terrified to see the exact scene from her vision, and then warns that the storm is returning.

Scans of the storm determine that it is actually a group of life forms, and Kirk tries to communicate with them through the universal translator, but gets no response. After firing phaser warning shots, Kirk resorts to a full attack, and as the beams strike the storm, Romaine seems to react in pain. Scott, noticing this, begs Kirk to stop the attack.

During a discussion in the briefing room, McCoy reports that Romaine&#x27;s brain wave pattern has been altered, and Spock reveals that the new pattern matches sensor data from the storm. They conclude that the alien life forms are attempting to take control of Romaine&#x27;s body. To prevent this, they devise a plan to allow the aliens to take partial control and then subject Romaine to high atmospheric pressure. Before they can place her into the pressure chamber, the aliens enter Romaine&#x27;s body, and begin to speak through her, identifying themselves as survivors from the long-dead planet of Zetar. They intend to live out their remaining existence using Romaine&#x27;s body. With some difficulty, Scott succeeds in getting Romaine into the pressure chamber, and the aliens are eventually driven out and apparently destroyed.

With the conclusion of the crisis, Spock, McCoy, and Scott all agree that Romaine is fit to return to duty, with a new assignment to oversee salvaging and repairs of Memory Alpha&#x27;s archives.

==Production==
Episode co-writer Shari Lewis was best known as a children&#x27;s entertainer, being the original puppeteer of the sock puppet, Lamb Chop. She was married at the time to the episode&#x27;s other credited writer, Jeremy Tarcher. The episode was filmed between 1st and 11th of November 1968.

==Sequel novel==
In the non-canonical novel, &quot;Memory Prime&quot;, Romaine participates in a project to rebuild the archives in a more secure structure. The project is soon thrown into turmoil by a murder plot that escalates into a looming crisis that threatens to repeat Memory Alpha&#x27;s disaster. However, with the aid of the crew of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Romaine manages to avert it.

==Popular culture==
Memory Alpha, the wiki devoted to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, was named after the planetoid in this episode.

== Home video releases ==
This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993 as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;.

<doc id="1339973" wikidata="Q3507014" url="?curid=1339973" title="The Mark of Gideon">
<text>&quot;The Mark of Gideon&quot; is the sixteenth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by George F. Slavin and Stanley Adams and directed by Jud Taylor, it was first broadcast on January 17, 1969.

In the episode, a race of aliens from an overpopulated planet abduct Captain Kirk to solve their problem.

The episode was co-written by actor Stanley Adams who portrayed Cyrano Jones in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at the planet Gideon to discuss diplomatic relations. The Gideons will permit only one representative, Captain Kirk, to set foot on their planet. Kirk beams down to the coordinates provided, but finds himself apparently still aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which is now devoid of any crew.

First Officer Spock is informed that the Captain has not arrived on the planet, but the Gideon Ambassador, Hodin, refuses to allow a search team to investigate. Neither Starfleet Command nor the Federation bureaucracy is of any help, each referring the matter to the other.

Meanwhile, Kirk wanders the deserted corridors and notices a strange bruise on his arm. He eventually encounters a beautiful young woman named Odona. She claims to have no idea how she got there, recalling only that she was in an overcrowded auditorium and struggling to breathe. For the moment, Odona is just relieved to have freedom of movement. Kirk insists that she must be from Gideon, but Odona denies any knowledge of the planet.

Kirk learns from Odona that her home planet is severely overpopulated, with crowds of people everywhere and no privacy, because death is rare. To her, the privilege of being alone, even for a moment, is a dream come true. Kirk is taken by Odona&#x27;s beauty, and the two share a passionate kiss. Neither notices the image of two dozen faces appearing on the view screen behind them.

As Kirk and Odona leave the bridge, Kirk hears a strange sound outside the ship. He goes to a viewport and catches a glimpse of a crowd of people looking in. The scene quickly changes to a normal view of space. Kirk confronts Odona about what is going on, but she denies knowing what is happening. She then complains of a strange feeling and faints into Kirk&#x27;s arms.

Kirk carries her to sick bay, where he encounters Ambassador Hodin, who informs him that Odona, his daughter, is suffering from Vegan choriomeningitis, having been infected with Kirk&#x27;s blood, which carries the virus. Hodin&#x27;s plan is to infect the Gideon population with the virus, shortening their immense lifespans and relieving the population problem. Kirk is to supply the virus, while Odona&#x27;s death is to serve as an inspiration for future volunteers. Questioned about alternatives, Hodin explains that the Gideon people&#x27;s regenerative abilities would foil sterilization attempts, and that other methods of birth control would never be accepted.

Having realized that Hodin has deceived him, Spock goes against Starfleet orders and beams down to Kirk&#x27;s original coordinates. Once there, he finds a false &quot;Enterprise&quot; that was built to confuse Kirk. He soon reaches Kirk and Odona, and asks Hodin not to interfere as he, Spock, is in enough trouble already. Kirk, Spock, and Odona return to the real &quot;Enterprise&quot;, where Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy treats Odona&#x27;s condition. Odona now plans to return to Gideon to supply the virus herself. Kirk forgives her for her deception.

==Production and reception==
In 2017, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked &quot;The Mark of Gideon&quot; as the 14th &quot;best worst&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode of the original series.

<text>&quot;Let That Be Your Last Battlefield&quot; is the fifteenth episode of the third season of the original American science fiction television show &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Oliver Crawford (based on a story by Gene L. Coon, writing under his pen name &quot;Lee Cronin&quot;) and directed by Jud Taylor, it was first broadcast January 10, 1969.

In the episode, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; encounters two survivors of a war-torn planet, each half black and half white (though on opposite sides from each other), each committed to destroying the other.

The episode guest-stars Lou Antonio and Frank Gorshin.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; is on a mission to help decontaminate the polluted atmosphere of the planet Ariannus, when sensors detect a Federation shuttlecraft that was reported stolen. The craft is brought aboard along with its alien pilot, who identifies himself as Lokai, a political refugee from the planet Cheron. Lokai&#x27;s most striking feature is that his skin is ink-black on one side of his body and chalk-white on the other.

Shortly thereafter, sensors detect another spacecraft in pursuit of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The alien craft disintegrates, but not before its pilot, Bele, transports to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge. He is colored black and white, similar to Lokai. Bele explains that he is on a mission to retrieve political traitors. His current quarry is Lokai, whom he has been chasing for 50,000 Earth years. Bele is taken to Lokai, and the two begin to argue about the history of their peoples, including whether it was justified for Bele&#x27;s people to dominate Lokai&#x27;s people; the two men almost come to blows.

Bele demands that Captain Kirk take him and Lokai to Cheron. Kirk refuses, telling him he will have to make his case to Federation authorities. Some time later, the ship changes course to Cheron, and Bele announces that his &quot;will&quot; has taken control of the ship. When Lokai demands the death of Bele, Kirk orders both of them to be taken to the ship&#x27;s brig, but a force field generated by both aliens makes that impossible. With no other way to regain control, Kirk threatens to destroy the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and begins the ship’s auto-destruct sequence. In the last seconds of the countdown, Bele relents, and the ship resumes its course to Ariannus.

As Bele continues angrily to press his matter with Starfleet, he reveals the source of his conflict with Lokai. Like himself, all of Bele&#x27;s people on Cheron are black on their right sides, while Lokai&#x27;s people are all white on their right sides. The distinction is lost on the ship&#x27;s officers, who query whether the original Cheronians were monochromatic like the crew of the Enterprise, and leave the legal matter for authorities at the next starbase to decide, as the Federation has no extradition treaties with Cheron, and the case requires due process.

Once the Ariannus mission is completed, Bele takes control of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; again, this time disabling the self-destruct system. When the ship arrives at Cheron, Spock can find no sign of intelligent life. Lokai and Bele realize they are each the only ones left of their peoples, who have completely annihilated themselves in civil war. Enraged, they attack each other, their force fields threatening to damage the ship. Lokai breaks away, Bele pursues him, both traumatically envisioning their destroyed planet as they do so, and the two eventually beam down to the planet. The bridge crew remark sadly on their unwillingness to give up their hate.

==Production==
The script for the story was developed from a story outline written by Gene L. Coon under his pen name Lee Cronin. This was Gene Coon&#x27;s final episode.

Although Gene Roddenberry liked it, it was initially rejected by NBC studio executive Stanley Robertson. The look of the aliens Bele and Lokai was decided only a week before filming began, based on an offhand comment by director Jud Taylor. The half white-half black makeup led to criticism of the episode as heavy-handed.

The script evolved from an outline by Barry Trivers for a possible first season episode called &quot;A Portrait in Black and White&quot;. The script was accepted for the third season following budget cuts.

&quot;Let That Be Your Last Battlefield&quot; is significant in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe for the first appearance of a self-destruct system (as opposed to an improvised self-destruction process). It did not originate the concept, which appeared previously in the film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956), but the self-destruct system has appeared as a plot device in many subsequent &quot;Star Trek&quot; stories. The self-destruction sequence codes 11A, 11A2B, 1B2B3 and the final code 000 destruct-0 from the episode were used again verbatim in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search For Spock&quot; to destroy &quot;Enterprise&quot; in that film.

==Reception==
In 2010, &quot;SciFiNow&quot; ranked this the ninth best episode of the original series.

Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &quot;C+&quot; rating, noting positively the aliens&#x27; makeup and some &quot;good moments&quot;, but also noting that these were outweighed by an overpowering message. In their compendium of Star Trek reviews, &quot;Trek Navigator&quot;, Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross both rated the episode as mediocre, describing its message as obvious and heavy-handed. They did find some redeeming moments, such as the climactic chase to the ruined planet&#x27;s surface and Gorshin&#x27;s performance as Bele. This episode is noted as one of the top ten Star Trek episodes that takes on the topic of tolerance.

In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; rated &quot;Let That Be Your Last Battlefield&quot; the 11th best television episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise television shows prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; including live-action and animated series but not counting the movies.

A 2016 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; noted that this episode was a dramatization about slavery and racism.

In 2017, ScreenRant ranked &quot;Let That Be Your Last Battlefield&quot; the 7th most optimistic episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; television, pointing out the crew&#x27;s reaction at the end.

In 2016, SyFy ranked guest stars Frank Gorshin and Lou Antonio (as Bele and Lokai, the black and white aliens), the 10th best guest stars on the original series.

In 2018, &quot;Collider&quot; ranked this episode the 12th best original series episode, and in the same year, &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked this the 19th best episode of the original series.

In 2020, &quot;ScreenRant&quot; ranked it as the 10th best episode of TOS to re-watch. They note that as the two characters are introduced, each appears half-black and half-white, but the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew does not understand the feud between the two characters.

<doc id="1339979" wikidata="Q3507047" url="?curid=1339979" title="That Which Survives">
<text>&quot;That Which Survives&quot; is the seventeenth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by John Meredyth Lucas (based on a story by D.C. Fontana under the pseudonym Michael Richards) and directed by Herb Wallerstein, it was first broadcast January 24, 1969.

In the episode, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; visit an abandoned planet guarded by a mysterious woman.

==Plot==
The &quot;Enterprise&quot; discovers a planet whose young age is inconsistent with its atmosphere and biology. As Captain Kirk, Dr. McCoy, Lt. Sulu and geologist D&#x27;Amato beam down, a woman appears in the transporter room, touches the transporter technician, and kills him instantly. As the landing party materializes, the surface of the planet is rocked by a violent tremor. Communication with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is lost, leaving them stranded.

At the same time, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; finds itself 990.7 light years from the planet. First Officer Spock orders the &quot;Enterprise&quot; back to the planet. Dr. M&#x27;Benga determines the cause of the transporter officer&#x27;s death to be cellular disruption.

The landing party splits up and explores their surroundings. As D&#x27;Amato surveys a rocky area, he comes face-to-face with the woman who appeared in the transporter room. After listing off his name and professional record, she says, &quot;I am for you,&quot; and touches D&#x27;Amato, killing him. A failed attempt to cut a grave for D&#x27;Amato proves that the planet is artificial.

Chief Engineer Scott, sensing something wrong, orders Engineer Watkins to check equipment in a secluded area. The mysterious woman appears, kills Watkins, and disappears again.

The woman appears to Sulu and attempts to touch him, but only brushes his shoulder with her fingertips. Sulu&#x27;s screams of pain bring Kirk and McCoy, who find him injured but alive. The woman touches Kirk&#x27;s shoulder without effect. She then disappears. They conclude that she can only kill the person she specifically names.

The ship begins to accelerate uncontrollably, and Scott discovers the emergency overload bypass has been sabotaged. Scott estimates that the ship will explode in 15 minutes if not brought back under control. Spock suggests manually cutting the matter-antimatter fuel flow to the warp engines. Scott begins the procedure as the &quot;Enterprise&quot; passes warp 13.2. Scott stops the matter–antimatter flow at the last second, just as the ship hit warp 14.1 and the ship continues its course to the planet.

On the planet, the woman appears again, announcing she is &quot;for Kirk&quot;, but Sulu and McCoy block her path. Questioned by Kirk, the woman says she is Losira, the station commander. She is alone, and her only purpose is to defend the planet from intruders. Kirk&#x27;s questions unsettle her and she vanishes. Strong power emanations lead the landing party to a hidden entrance in a rock face. Passing into the hidden chamber, the landing party find a glowing computer. Three copies of Losira enter, one each for Kirk, Sulu, and McCoy. As they approach, Spock and a security officer materialize, and, at Kirk&#x27;s command, destroy the computer. The three Losiras vanish.

A projected image of Losira then appears on a wall, informing her fellow Kalandans that a disease has killed the station&#x27;s personnel, and that the computer has been defending the station against intruders. McCoy surmises that the disease eventually wiped out the entire Kalandan species, and Spock suggests that the computer used images of Losira to do the job of defense. Kirk concludes that the landing party survived because the reproductions were so perfect that they experienced regret about killing.

==Production==
The original story outline was written by D.C. Fontana under the pseudonym Michael Richards. In this outline called &quot;Survival&quot;, Losira is more brutal, encouraging the crew to turn on each other and fight.

This is the second appearance of Naomi Pollack on Star Trek, this time as Lieutenant Rahda, taking Sulu&#x27;s place at the helm. Previously she played one of the natives in The Paradise Syndrome.

Booker Bradshaw as Dr. M&#x27;Benga previously appeared in the Season 2 episode &quot;A Private Little War&quot;.

==Reception==
In a 2010 review, Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a B. He found the stranding of the landing party a refreshing predicament for the series, and praised the depiction of both Spock&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses as a commander, but questioned why the planet&#x27;s defense system was so needlessly aggressive, and called the ending an unsatisfying info-dump.

== Releases ==
This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993 as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;. A trailer for this and the other episodes was also included, and the episode had English and Japanese audio tracks. The cover script was スター・トレック TVサードシーズン

<text>The Allardyce Range () is a mountain range rising south of Cumberland Bay and dominating the central part of South Georgia, a British Overseas Territories. It extends for from Mount Globus in the northwest to Mount Brooker in the southeast, with peaks of and including Mount Paget () the highest peak of the range and also the highest point in the UK territory. Other peaks of the range include Mount Roots.

Although not shown on the charts of South Georgia by Cook in 1775 or Bellingshausen in 1819, peaks of this range were doubtless seen by those explorers. The range was named c. 1915 after Sir William Lamond Allardyce (1861–1930), Governor of the Falkland Islands and Dependencies, 1904–14.

<text>Cumberland Bay is a bay, wide at its entrance between Larsen Point and Barff Point, which separates into two extensive arms, Cumberland West Bay and Cumberland East Bay, which recede inland along the northern coast of South Georgia. It was discovered and named in 1775 by a British expedition under James Cook.

In the Second World War the whaling stations were closed except Grytviken and Leith Harbour. Most of the British and Norwegian whalers and factory ships were destroyed by German merchant raiders, and the remainder were called up to serve under Allied command. The resident British Magistrates (W. Barlas and A.I. Fleuret) attended to the island&#x27;s defence throughout the War. The Royal Navy deployed the armed merchant cruiser to patrol South Georgian and Antarctic waters, and deployed two four-inch guns to protect key approaches: at Grytviken to protect Cumberland Bay and at Leith Harbour to protect Stromness Bay. The batteries still survive. They were manned by volunteers from among the Norwegian whalers who were trained for the purpose.

The road continues on from its western terminus at the national park&#x27;s entrance as Main Park Road for another , providing access to many of the park&#x27;s facilities and the ghost town of Flamingo, in Monroe County, at its western end.

==Route description==
The Florida Department of Transportation states that SR 9336 begins at the entrance to the Everglades National Park. Heading northeast from there, SR 9336 is known as the Ingraham Highway as it travels through rural south-western Miami-Dade County as a two-laned road. Just before crossing the Aerojet canal, SR 9336 turns east and continues through farmland, turning again to the northeast after approximately . After crossing another canal, the Ingraham Highway turns east once more and becomes more urban, passing by a housing estate. At its eastern end, outside the Dade Correctional Institution and just over from its western terminus, SR 9336 reaches a four-way stop intersection and continues north out of it along Tower Road. Although SR 9336 travels through farmland for the next , the surroundings become more urbanised as it approaches West Palm Drive where, at another four-way stop intersection, SR 9336 travels east along that road. Here, SR 9336 enters Florida City, and enters suburbia after one block east along West Palm Drive, continuing eastwards past shops, churches and schools. Through Florida City, it acts as the city&#x27;s grid plan&#x27;s latitudinal baseline. At 6th Avenue, West Palm Drive becomes a divided four-laned road, and remains as such for the rest of its journey; later, after passing the Florida City City Hall, the southern terminus of the South Miami-Dade Busway and more shops, SR 9336 intersects with Krome Avenue (former SR 997). One block further east, and now designated as East Palm Drive, SR 9336 terminates at US 1.

West of SR 9336&#x27;s western terminus, Main Park Road extends for another to Flamingo, through various ecosystem areas of the Everglades National Park. East of SR 9336&#x27;s terminus, East Palm Drive (also known as Southwest 344th Street) extends along the former SR 906 towards the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Biscayne National Park and the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station.

==History==
Excluding the easternmost two blocks, SR 9336 was (with SR 997) part of the former SR 27, which connected Flamingo in the Everglades to US 27. The easternmost two blocks consisted of the former SR 906, which continued to Biscayne National Park. The designation was changed in the early 1980s because of confusion between the state road and the U.S. Highway.

Main Park Road, formerly the Ingraham Highway in its entirety, began construction in 1915 to connect Florida City to Flamingo, then a town on the shores of Florida Bay, primarily by using the spoil from dredging the Homestead Canal beside the road. The road had reached as far as Paradise Key, now the Royal Palm area of the Everglades National Park, when it was dedicated with the Royal Palm State Park on November 23, 1916, as the Ingraham Highway, and named for James E. Ingraham, the president of the Model Land Company and vice-president of the associated Florida East Coast Railway. Construction of the road continued west of Paradise Key, and was hampered by difficulties such as subaqueous caverns and the onset of the First World War, with only about built by December, 1917. After the designation of the Everglades National Park in 1947, the SR 27 designation was removed and a detour was created north onto higher ground, as the road was prone to flooding during periods of high water, with portions of the old road re-purposed as park trails or removed. The creation (and refilling) of the canal, as well as digging and blocking culverts under the road have affected flows of fresh and salt water within this part of the Everglades National Park.

<text>Mount Paget is a summit of Allardyce Range on the South Atlantic/Antarctic island of South Georgia. At above the sea level, it is the highest peak on the island, and the highest peak in any territory under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom (excluding the British Antarctic Territory, where British sovereignty is unrecognised by most countries, where Mount Hope is the highest peak). Mount Paget is more than twice the height of Ben Nevis, the highest mountain on the island of Great Britain and is ranked 23rd by topographic isolation.

It is a saddle-shaped mountain, marking the highest point of the Allardyce Range in the central part of South Georgia. This feature was known to early sealers and whalers at South Georgia, and the name has long been established through general usage. It is clearly visible from Grytviken and King Edward Point.

The west peak of was climbed in December 1960 by Captain V. N. Stevenson, Lt. Cdr. M. K. Burly and Corporal B. Todd of the Royal Navy, landing at Cape Darnley by helicopter from HMS Protector. On 30 December 1964, the summit of was reached by Lieutenant S. H. Down, Sergeant T. J. Lynch and Senior Airman J. R. Chester of a British Combined Services expedition.

<text>The Jakarta metropolitan area or Greater Jakarta, known locally as Jabodetabekpunjur (an acronym of Jakarta–Bogor–Depok–Tangerang–Bekasi further extended to include Puncak region of Bogor Regency and portions of Cianjur Regency) is the most populous megapolitan area in Indonesia. It includes the national capital (Jakarta Special Capital Region, as the core city) as well as five satellite cities and three complete regencies. The original term &quot;Jabotabek&quot; dated from the late 1970s and was revised to &quot;Jabodetabek&quot; in 1999 when &quot;De&quot; (for &quot;Depok&quot;) was inserted into the name following its formation. The term &quot;Jabodetabekjur&quot; or &quot;Jabodetabekpunjur&quot; was legalised on the Presidential Regulation Number 54 of 2008, and then the name &quot;Jabodetabekpunjur&quot; is officially used.

The area comprises Jakarta Special Capital Region and parts of West Java and Banten provinces, specifically the three regencies - Bekasi Regency and Bogor Regency in West Java, and Tangerang Regency in Banten. The area also includes the independent cities of Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, Tangerang and South Tangerang, all of which are not included administratively in the regencies. The name of the region is taken from the first two (or three) letters of each city&#x27;s name: Ja-bo-de-ta-bek from Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi.

The population of the Jakarta metropolitan area, with an area of , was 31.24 million according to the Indonesian 2020 Census, making it the most populous region in Indonesia, as well as the second-most populous urban area in the world after Tokyo. The Jakarta metropolitan area&#x27;s share of the national population increased from 6.1% in 1961 to 11.26% in 2010. The population grew further to 31.9 million according to the official mid 2022 Estimates.

The region is the centre of government, culture, education, and economy of Indonesia. It has pulled many people from throughout Indonesia to come, live and work. Its economic power makes Jakarta metropolitan area the country&#x27;s premier centre for finance, manufacturing and commerce. According to 2019 data,
the area had a gross domestic product of US$297.7 billion with a per capita GDP of $8,775, and a purchasing power parity of US$978.5 billion with a per capita PPP of $28,840, equal to 26.2% of economy of Indonesia.

==History==
The region was established in 1976 through Presidential Instruction No. 13 in response to the needs to sustain the growing population of the capital city. Indonesia&#x27;s government established the Jabotabek Cooperation Body (&quot;Badan Kerjasama Pembangunan&quot;) of the joint secretariat of Government of DKI Jakarta and West Java province.

==Greater Jakarta==
The generic term Greater Jakarta refers to the urban region surrounding Jakarta, and it is not specific to any official or administrative designations. On the contrary, depending on context, it may refer to the built-up area around Jakarta.

==Demographics==

Among the inhabitants, approximately 10.68 million lived in Jakarta Special Capital Region according to the mid-2022 official estimates; about 9.09 million in the five cities of Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, Tangerang and South Tangerang; and about 12.13 million in the three regencies (Bekasi Regency, Bogor Regency, and Tangerang Regency). The proportion of the core city&#x27;s (Jakarta) population to that of the entire metropolitan area also declined significantly. In 2020, the population of Jakarta was only 30.4% of the total population of the Jakarta metropolitan area, continuing the decline from 54.6% in 1990 to 43.2% in 2000 and 35.5% in 2010. Furthermore, there has been a shift of arrival-destination for incoming migrants from Jakarta to other cities in the Jakarta metropolitan area. Today, about 20% of Indonesia&#x27;s urban population is concentrated in the Jakarta metropolitan area.

* Kemendagri 2022 June estimate. Note the pandemic had skewing effects on Census 2020 data compared with prior year estimates, in favor of satellite cities, while post-pandemic data indicates a flood back into central cities. This effect is repeated for Bandung, Surabaya, Palembang, and Medan.

==Economy==

Nowadays, the role of the Jakarta metropolitan area in the national economy is still dominant although the decentralisation policy has been implemented since the political reforms in 1998. The region accounts for 25.52% of total national gross domestic product and 42.8% to the total GDP of Java in 2010. Central Jakarta, South Jakarta and Bekasi have respectively accounted for 4.14%; 3.78% and 2.11% of total national GDP. There are three dominant sectors which have a high contribution to the total Jakarta metropolitan area&#x27;s GDP comprising: industrial sector (28.36%), financial sector (20.66%) as well as trade, hotel and restaurant sectors (20.24%). Based on the contribution of each sector to the total national GDP in 2010, Jakarta metropolitan area contributed 41.87% for the finance sector, 33.1% for construction and building, as well as 30.86% for transportation.

Prime business and commercial centres include the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; in central Jakarta. There are Indonesia&#x27;s premier financial centre, SCBD, Mega Kuningan, Rasuna Epicentrum as well as along Jalan Jenderal Sudirman, Jalan M.H. Thamrin, Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto and Jalan HR Rasuna Said. The Golden Triangle is also known to expatriates and locals as a lifestyle centre of the metropolis. There are countless high-end boutiques, fine restaurants, coffee shops and malls. Kelapa Gading is the newest business district, lifestyle centre and residential areas, located in the north-eastern part of Jakarta. It has several bars and entertainment places that open up until late at night.

The development of large scale residential areas and industrial parks in the Jakarta metropolitan area has been induced by infrastructure development, especially toll roads and railways. The Jakarta metropolitan area has been built industrial estate in the outskirts, mainly in Cikarang, home to a dozen industrial estates with more than 2,500 industrial companies. The Cikarang industrial estate occupied a total land area of about 11,000 hectares and became the largest concentration of manufacturing activities in Southeast Asia. Many foreign companies are located in the Cikarang industrial estate, such as from Japan, South Korea, China, Singapore and United States.

==Transportation==

The region is partly defined by the areas from which people commute into the city. All municipality and regencies have access to toll road and rail service. At present public transport in Greater Jakarta consists of TransJakarta BRT, KRL Commuterline commuter rail, Jakarta LRT, Soekarno-Hatta Airport Rail Link, and Jakarta MRT. The transit system that is currently under construction is LRT Jabodebek. Jakarta LRT began operation by late 2019, and LRT Jabodebek was expected to open by March 2021.

===Aviation===

The Jakarta metropolitan area has two major airports, Soekarno Hatta International Airport, commonly known as Cengkareng Airport (CGK) and Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport (chiefly domestic). Pondok Cabe Airport in South Tangerang, owned by the state oil company Pertamina, is used for civilian and military airport.

===Rail===
The Jakarta metropolitan area is served by KRL Commuterline, a 418 km (260 mi) commuter train comprising five lines (Red/Bogor Line, Green/Rangkasbitung Line, Blue/Cikarang Loop Line, Brown/Tangerang Line and Pink/Tanjung Priok Line) and over 80 stations across the area, plus Lebak Regency in Banten.

Urban rail systems in Jakarta include rapid transit system Jakarta MRT, and light rail system Jakarta LRT, and light rapid transit system Jabodebek LRT. Before Jakarta MRT was opened in 2019, the Jakarta metropolitan area was the world&#x27;s largest metropolitan areas without a grade-separated rapid transit system.

Rail connection to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport is served by Soekarno-Hatta Airport Rail Link and Soekarno–Hatta Airport Skytrain inside the airport complex.

===Bus===

The TransJakarta bus rapid transit service (known as Busway) was developed throughout Jakarta and currently has 13 active corridors and a further three in planning. The system connects Bekasi, Depok, and Tangerang with three routes connecting Jakarta with Bekasi vice versa, namely Harapan Indah - Pasar Baru, West Bekasi - Bunderan HI, and East Bekasi - Tanjung Priok. While for Depok, only three routes are currently active: UI - Manggarai, UI - Lebak bulus, Terminal Depok - BKN via the Cijago toll road. In addition to the main corridors, the feeder buses of Transjakarta serves commuters from satellite cities, such as Bumi Serpong Damai and Bintaro Jaya (South Tangerang) as well as Kemang Pratama, Grand Galaxy City and Cibubur (Bekasi).

===High Speed Rail===

Indonesia operates a single high-speed rail service between the country&#x27;s two largest cities, Jakarta and Bandung, branded Whoosh (short for , ). It is operated by Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC). 

Whoosh is the first high-speed railway in Southeast Asia, and the Southern Hemisphere and covers a distance of with an operating speed of , and design speed of KCIC400AF train of ,
making it the second fastest commercially operating railway network in the world.
The travel time between the two cities averages 45 minutes, down from three hours before its opening. Whoosh cost $7.3 billion to build.

The line began trial operation with passengers on 7 September 2023, and commercial operations on 17 October 2023. The Whoosh high speed train served 1 million passengers during 2 months of commercial operation from 17 October to 25 December 2023.

<doc id="1340015" wikidata="Q4327818" url="?curid=1340015" title="A Night in the Lonesome October">
<text>A Night in the Lonesome October is a novel by American writer Roger Zelazny published in 1993, near the end of his life. It was his last book, and one of his five personal favorites.

The book is divided into 32 chapters, each representing one &quot;night&quot; in the month of October (plus one &quot;introductory&quot; chapter). The story is told in the first-person, akin to journal entries. Throughout, 33 full-page illustrations by Gahan Wilson (one per chapter, plus one on the inside back cover) punctuate a tale heavily influenced by H. P. Lovecraft. The title is a line from Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;Ulalume&quot; and Zelazny thanks him as well as others – Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Bloch and Albert Payson Terhune – whose most famous characters appear in the book.

&quot;A Night in the Lonesome October&quot; was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1994. A similar theme of conflict surrounding the opening of a gate to another world exists in Zelazny&#x27;s 1981 novel &quot;Madwand&quot;.

==Plot summary==
&quot;A Night in the Lonesome October&quot; is narrated from the point-of-view of Snuff, a dog who is Jack the Ripper&#x27;s companion. The bulk of the story takes place in London and its environments, though at one point the story detours through the dream-world described by Lovecraft in &quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;. Though never explicitly stated, various contextual clues within the story (the most obvious of which is the appearance of Sherlock Holmes or &quot;The Great Detective&quot;) imply that it takes place during the late Victorian period.

The story reveals that once every few decades when the moon is full on the night of Halloween (a very rare &quot;Blue Moon&quot;, meaning the second full moon in that month), the fabric of reality thins, and doors may be opened between this world and the realm of the Great Old Ones. When these conditions are right, men and women with occult knowledge may gather at a specific ritual site to hold the doors closed, or to help fling them open. Should the Closers win, then the world will remain as it is until the next turning, but should the Openers succeed, then the Great Old Ones will come to Earth, to remake the world in their own image, enslaving or slaughtering the human race in the process. The Openers have never yet won. These meetings are often referred to as &quot;The Game&quot; or &quot;The Great Game&quot; by the participants, who try to keep the goings-on secret from the mundane population.

The various &quot;Players&quot; during the Game depicted in the book are archetypal characters from the Victorian Era gothic fiction – Jack the Ripper (only ever referred to as &quot;Jack&quot;), Dracula (&quot;The Count&quot;), and the Wolf Man (known as &quot;Larry Talbot&quot;, the film character&#x27;s name) all make appearances. In addition, there is a Witch (&quot;Crazy Jill&quot;), a Clergyman (Vicar Roberts), a Druid (&quot;Owen&quot;), Victor Frankenstein (&quot;The Good Doctor&quot;), Sherlock Holmes (&quot;The Great Detective&quot;), a &quot;Mad Monk&quot; (&quot;Rastov&quot; – apparently modeled after Rasputin), and grave robbers or Hermetic occultists (&quot;Morris and McCab&quot; – based either on real-life grave robbers Burke and Hare or a reference to a real hermetic of the time, MacGregor Mathers).

Each Player has a familiar – an animal companion with near-human intelligence that helps complete the numerous preparations for the ritual. The majority of the story describes the interactions and discussions of these familiars, all from Snuff&#x27;s point of view.

Throughout the book, the Players slowly take sides, form alliances, make deals, oppose one another, and even kill off their enemies. The plot accelerates until the night of October 31, when the rite takes place and the fate of the world is decided.

<text>Maurice Joly (; 22 September 1829 – 15 July 1878) was a French political writer and lawyer known for &quot;The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu&quot;, a political satire of Napoleon III.

== Known life ==
Most of the known information about Monsieur Joly is based upon his autobiographical sketch, ,
written at Conciergerie prison in November 1870, where he was jailed for an assault at Hôtel de Ville, Paris. Some additional facts are mentioned at Henry Rollin&#x27;s book, ,
and in – a preface to a modern publication of Joly&#x27;s and &quot;César&quot; – by the mysterious F. Leclercq.

Joly was born in the small town of Lons-le-Saunier, in the département of Jura, to a French father and an Italian mother. He studied law in Dijon, but stopped in 1849 in order to go to Paris, where he worked as a clerk at various governmental institutions for about 10 years. He successfully completed his legal studies and was finally admitted to the Paris bar in 1859.

He started writing in 1862, supplying literary portraits of his fellow lawyers to a small magazine, &quot;Gorgias&quot;, and later published these sketches as a stand-alone book, &quot;Le Barreau de Paris&quot;,
followed by &quot;Les Principes de 89&quot;
and &quot;Supplément à la géographie politique du Jura&quot;.
Then Joly concocted a lampoon, &quot;César&quot;, where he attacked the political regime of Napoleon III (Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte). The books were printed by the Martin-Beaupré brothers and swiftly destroyed by the publishers. Not a single copy survived.

In 1864, Joly wrote his best-known book, &quot;The Dialogue in Hell&quot;, a satirical attack on Bonaparte&#x27;s authoritarianism, and a defense of republicanism. The piece uses the literary device of a dialogue of the dead, invented by ancient Roman writer Lucian and introduced into the French belles-lettres by Bernard de Fontenelle in the 18th century. Shades of the historical figures Niccolò Machiavelli and Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu meet in Hell in the year 1864 and dispute on politics. In this way, Joly tried to conceal a direct, and then illegal, criticism of Louis-Napoleon&#x27;s rule.

Joly relates, in his 1870 autobiography, that one evening thinking of Abbé Galiani&#x27;s treatise &quot;Dialogues sur le commerce des bleds&quot;
and walking by the Pont Royal, he was inspired to write a dialogue between Montesquieu and Machiavelli. The noble baron Montesquieu (whom Joly consigned to Hell in his book because of Montesquieu&#x27;s support of republics/democracies) would make the case for liberalism; the Florentine politician Machiavelli would present the case for despotism.

In the &quot;Dialogue&quot;, Machiavelli claims that he &quot;... wouldn&#x27;t even need twenty years to transform utterly the most indomitable European character and render it as a docile under tyranny as the debased people of Asia.&quot; Montesquieu insists that the liberal spirit of the peoples is invincible. In 25 dialogues, step by step, Machiavelli, who by Joly&#x27;s plot covertly represents Napoleon III, explains how he would replace freedom with despotism in any given European country: &quot;...Absolute power will no longer be an accident of fortune but will become a need&quot; of the modern society. At the end, Machiavelli prevails. In the curtain-line Montesquieu exclaims &quot;Eternal God, what have you permitted!...&quot;

The book was published anonymously (with the by-line , &#x27;by a contemporary&#x27;) in Brussels in 1864 and smuggled into France for distribution, but the print-run was seized by the police immediately upon crossing the border. The police swiftly tracked down its author, and Joly was arrested. The book was banned. On 25 April 1865, he was sentenced to 18 months at the Sainte-Pélagie Prison in Paris. The second edition of the &quot;Dialogues&quot; was issued in 1868 under Joly&#x27;s name.
This time, it reached the readers. But its author remained in obscurity. He established a new journal, &quot;Le Palais&quot;, that ended after a confrontation with the principal collaborator in the enterprise. After the fall of the Empire in 1870, Joly sought a governmental position from Jules Grévy. He failed in this too.
Campaigning against Napoleon III at the 1870 French constitutional referendum, Joly wrote an epilogue to his &quot;Dialogues&quot;. It was published in &quot;Le Gaulois&quot;

and &quot;La Cloche&quot;

magazines.

In 1871, he was a low-rank member of the Paris Commune
and in his last years he joined the Masonic lodge &quot;La Clémente Amitié&quot;.

Though it gained Joly the reputation of a scandalous and bully barrator, he sued ten newspapers, one after another, either for not accepting his stories or for not publishing news about him. Joly&#x27;s name was completely forgotten, and in life he did not attain the glory he so obsessively craved.

Joly was found dead on 15 July 1878 in his 5 Quai Voltaire apartment in Paris.
The declared cause of his death was gunshot suicide. The circumstances meant that the exact date of his death could not be established.
==Posthumous fame==

The &quot;Dialogue&quot; and its author became famous later for an unintended and bizarre reason. Early in the 20th century, extensive passages from Joly&#x27;s book were used to fraudulently concoct &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;,
an infamous Russian-made antisemitic literary forgery. Neither the &quot;Dialogue&quot; itself, nor the text copied from it were antisemitic. They merely formed the scaffolding upon which the calumny against the Jewish people was built. An abundance of evidence from the Berne Trial and other research established that &quot;The Protocols&quot; were lavishly plagiarized from Joly&#x27;s book.

In his book &quot;Six Walks in the Fictional Woods&quot; (1994), Italian writer Umberto Eco claims
that in the &quot;Dialogue&quot;, Joly plagiarized seven pages or more from a popular novel &quot;The Mysteries of Paris&quot; by Eugene Sue. Joly is also a character in Eco&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Prague Cemetery&quot;.

In 2015 one of the streets in was named &quot;Rue Maurice Joly&quot;.

<text>Stanton Terry Friedman (July 29, 1934 – May 13, 2019) was an American–Canadian nuclear physicist and professional ufologist who was based in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada.

==Early life==
Born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Friedman was raised in nearby Linden and graduated from Linden High School in 1951; he attended Rutgers University and then transferred to the University of Chicago, earning a Bachelor of Science in 1955 and a master&#x27;s degree in nuclear physics in 1956.

=== Career in nuclear physics ===
Friedman was employed for 14 years as a nuclear physicist for such companies as General Electric (1956–1959), Aerojet General Nucleonics (1959–1963), General Motors (1963–1966), Westinghouse (1966–1968), TRW Systems (1969–1970), and McDonnell Douglas, where he worked on advanced, classified programs on nuclear aircraft, fission and fusion rockets, and compact nuclear power plants for space applications. Since the 1980s, he consulted for the radon-detection industry. Friedman&#x27;s professional affiliations included the American Nuclear Society, the American Physical Society, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and AFTRA.

===UFO investigations and advocacy===
In 1970, Friedman left full-time employment as a physicist to pursue the scientific investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Since then, he gave lectures at more than 600 colleges and to more than 100 professional groups in 50 states, 10 provinces, and 19 countries outside the US. Additionally, he worked as a consultant on the topic. He published more than 80 UFO-related papers and appeared on many radio and television programs. He also provided written testimony to Congressional hearings and appeared twice at the United Nations.

Friedman consistently favored use of the term &quot;flying saucer&quot; in his work, saying &quot;Flying saucers are, by definition, unidentified flying objects, but very few unidentified flying objects are flying saucers. I am interested in the latter, not the former.&quot; He used to refer to himself as &quot;The Flying Saucer Physicist&quot;, because of his degrees in nuclear physics and work on nuclear projects.

==Friedman&#x27;s positions regarding UFO phenomena==
Friedman was the first civilian to document the site of the Roswell UFO incident, and supported the hypothesis that it was a genuine crash of an extraterrestrial spacecraft. In 1968 Friedman told a committee of the United States House of Representatives that the evidence suggests that Earth is being visited by intelligently controlled extraterrestrial vehicles. Friedman also stated he believed that UFO sightings were consistent with magnetohydrodynamic propulsion.

In 1996, after researching and fact checking the Majestic 12 documents, Friedman said that there was no substantive grounds for dismissing their authenticity.

In 2004, on George Noory&#x27;s &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; radio show, Friedman debated Seth Shostak, the SETI Institute&#x27;s Senior Astronomer. Like Friedman, Shostak also believes in the existence of intelligent life other than humans; however, unlike Friedman, he does not believe such life is now on Earth or is related to UFO sightings.

Friedman hypothesized that UFOs may originate from relatively nearby sunlike stars.(p. 217)

A piece of evidence that he often cited with respect to this hypothesis is the 1964 star map drawn by alleged alien abductee Betty Hill during a hypnosis session, which she said was shown to her during her abduction. Astronomer Marjorie Fish constructed a three-dimensional map of nearby sun-like stars and claimed a good match from the perspective of Zeta Reticuli, about 39 light years distant. The fit of the Hill/Fish star maps was hotly debated in the December 1974 edition of &quot;Astronomy&quot; magazine, with Friedman and others defending the statistical validity of the match.

===SETI===
Friedman stated strong views against search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) research. Friedman contested the implicit premise of SETI that there has been no extraterrestrial visitation of the planet, because it was his claim that SETI was seeking only signals, not extraterrestrial intelligence or beings. He maintained that the prominence and widespread public claims of those involved with SETI have tended to prevent serious research, including research by journalists, of UFOs.(p. 129)

Friedman was a classmate of Carl Sagan at the University of Chicago. Friedman criticized Sagan, a proponent of SETI, for ignoring empirical evidence, such as &quot;600-plus &quot;unknowns&quot;&quot; of &quot;Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14&quot;. Friedman argued that these empirical data directly contradict Sagan&#x27;s claim in &quot;Other Worlds&quot; that the &quot;reliable cases are uninteresting and the interesting cases are unreliable&quot;. Specifically, Friedman referred to a table in &quot;Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14&quot; that he said &quot;shows that the better the quality of the sighting, the more likely it was to be an &#x27;unknown&#x27;, and the less likely it was to be listed as containing &#x27;insufficient information&#x27;&quot;(p. 42).

===Public and scientific opinion===
Friedman said of the response to his talks, &quot;I know that most people are unfamiliar with the several large-scale scientific studies ... because I ask, after I show a slide and ask about each one, &#x27;How many here have read this?&#x27; Typically, it is only one or two percent&quot;. He said that a talk he gave to Canadian journalists in Saint John, New Brunswick, caused the attitudes of the journalists to change, because &quot;... attendees had had no idea there was so much solid information, as opposed to the tabloid nonsense they thought was the primary source of UFO data&quot;. (p. 202)

Friedman argued that the majority of people believe UFOs exist and at least some groups of scientists do as well. Friedman (2008) referred to the following data in support of his position:
* Gallup Polls between 1966 and 1987 asked respondents the question: &quot;Are UFOs something real, or just people&#x27;s imagination?&quot; Of those who took a position one way or the other, 61%, 64%, 68%, and 60% took the position they are real in 1966, 1977, 1978, and 1987, respectively.
* With respect to scientists, a poll was taken by Industrial Research and Development in 1971 and 1979. Of the respondents who took a position, 64% and 69% stated they believed UFOs either probably or definitely exist. Of this subgroup, 32% and 44% considered their origin to be Outer Space in 1971 and 1979, respectively. Of the rest of this subgroup, approximately half believed them to be natural phenomena and half were &quot;undecided&quot;.
* Peter Sturrock also polled the membership of the American Astronomical Society and found that &quot;the greater the amount of time one spent on reading UFO-related material, the more likely one is to accept their reality&quot; (p. 210).

==Criticisms and controversies==

Friedman was outspoken in his articulation of positions and in his criticism of UFO debunkers, often stating he was not an &quot;apologist ufologist&quot;. His positions are regarded as controversial in mainstream science and media, but Friedman claimed to have received little opposition at his many lectures, most of which were at colleges and universities, many to engineering societies and other groups of physicists (p. 24). He had a number of debates in the mainstream media, including one with UFO skeptic Michael Shermer on CNN.

Friedman was criticized both by skeptics and other Roswell researchers for taking the position that there are no substantive grounds for dismissing the authenticity of some &quot;Majestic 12&quot; documents although Friedman was the first to provide evidence that some of the documents are clearly hoaxes. For example, he showed that a supposed memo from Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter to President Truman, dated February 17, 1948, was actually the emulation of a letter from Marshall to Roosevelt that was featured in the book &quot;The American MAGIC&quot;. Friedman researched the MJ-12 documents since first becoming aware of them from Wiliam Moore and Jaime Shandera in 1984. He addressed criticisms of the original documents in both sources. As an example, Philip J. Klass claimed lexicographic inconsistencies based on the use of Pica typeface in the Cutler-Twining memo and offered $100, in a challenge to Friedman, for each legitimate example of the use of the same style and size Pica type as used in the memo. Friedman provided 14 examples and was paid $1000 by Klass.

==Personal life==
Friedman was Ashkenazi Jewish. He was married twice. His first wife was Susie Virginia Porter (1919-2002), with whom he adopted three children, but they divorced in April 1974. He had one daughter with his second wife, Stella Marilyn Kimball (1935-2024). Friedman relocated to Marilyn&#x27;s native Fredericton, New Brunswick in the early 1980s. Friedman donated his records to the Provincial Archives of New Brunswick in the months leading up to his death.

On May 13, 2019, Friedman died of a heart attack at the Toronto Pearson Airport while traveling home from a speaking engagement in Columbus, Ohio.

<doc id="1340031" wikidata="Q6175407" url="?curid=1340031" title="Jefferson Community College (New York)">
<text>Jefferson Community College (SUNY Jefferson) is a public community college in Watertown, New York. Established on November 7, 1961, Jefferson Community College was the area&#x27;s first institution of higher education and remains the only college with a campus in a radius. It was initially accredited in 1969, and is the only college in the State University of New York (SUNY) System with a zoo technology degree program.

==History==
The college was established on November 7, 1961. Jefferson admitted 119 full and 221 part-time students to its first class in September 1963. A SUNY Small Business Development Center was opened on the campus in 1986. In June 2020 the college fired around twenty employees after a loss of over $5 million USD due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 31, 2022, the college revamped a computer room to turn it into an Esports lab.
==Campus==
The College campus, located near Interstate Highway 81 on the western boundary of the City of Watertown, consists of ten permanent buildings, athletic fields, and ample parking for its commuter student body. Jefferson&#x27;s first on-campus student housing, east hall, opened in the Fall 2014 semester for full-time students. The 294-bed residence hall features fully-furnished suite-style units designed to accommodate 6, 5 and 4 students. In March 2016, the College opened the brand new Collaborative Learning Center, named for the College&#x27;s 3rd president, John W. Deans. The first floor contains academic support services for students including academic coaching, placement testing, transfer counseling, career planning and job placement, veterans services and the Strategies To Achieve Results (STAR) and EOP programs. The second floor is home to tutoring services, the College library and media center. 

The campus consists of eight permanent buildings :

* The Samuel Guthrie Building
* The John Foster Dulles Building
* The Gregor Building
* The James McVean College Center Building
* The Robert Lansing Administration Building
* The John T. Henderson Child Care Center
* The Jules R. Samann Instructional Resource Center (Often shortened to &quot;The Jules Center&quot;)
There are five instructional computer classrooms and one computer resource center. Jefferson offers a baseball diamond, soccer/lacrosse fields, lighted tennis and basketball courts, and a walking/running trail.

==Academics==
Jefferson offers 14 A.A.S. career curricula, 12 transfer A.A. or A.S. curricula and six certificate programs. Six of these programs are available entirely online. The college also offers degree programs from other colleges in the &quot;Higher Education Program&quot;. This includes joint programs with State University of New York at Potsdam, Keuka College, Empire State University, Upstate Medical University, and Paul Smith&#x27;s College. The cost of In-state tuition is US$5,424 and $10,176 for out of state tuition.

==Student life==
There were 2,658 students in fall 2020, with 1,431 of them full-time and 1,227 of them part-time. In fall 2018, the ethnicity distribution of the college was 73% White, 9% Hispanic/Latino, 9% Black/African Americans 3% of two or more races, 1% Asian, 1% Indian, and 1% international student, with the gender distribution being 60% Female 40% Male. The College’s first residence hall opened in 2014. It houses 294 students and includes two classrooms, a large group meeting room, a security desk, a technology nook and two large study/social lounges on the main floor. Study lounges are also on each floor in both wings.

===Sports===
Physical education is a requirement at the school. Sports teams include:
*Soccer (Men&#x27;s/Women&#x27;s)
*Basketball (Men&#x27;s/Women&#x27;s)
*Volleyball (Women&#x27;s)
*Golf (Men&#x27;s/Women&#x27;s)
*Baseball (Men&#x27;s)
*Softball (Women&#x27;s)
*Lacrosse (Men&#x27;s)
*Hockey (Men&#x27;s) (AAU)
Clubs are often created to make up for some of the sports that are not teams, such as cheerleading and football. The Men’s/Women’s Basketball team and Women’s Volleyball team play their home games at The McVean Center Gymnasium which has a capacity of 1,800.

===Student clubs===
In addition to the sports that Jefferson Community College provides, the college also has many clubs that students may join. JCC provides clubs for most sports such as :
*Far Out Club (Fitness and Recreation Outing Club)
*Cheerleading Club
*Dance Club
*Ping Pong Club
*Ski Club
*Phi Theta Kappa

Clubs that relate to degrees that are available at JCC include:
*Business Club
*Criminal Justice Club 
*Early Childhood Club
*Emergency Medical Services (EMS Club)
*Human Services Club

<text>Google Labs is an incubator created by Google to test and publicly demonstrate new projects.

The original version was online from early 2002 to mid-2011. Google described Labs as &quot;a playground where our more adventurous users can play around with prototypes of some of our wild and crazy ideas and offer feedback directly to the engineers who developed them.&quot;

In 2023, Google revived Labs at the annual Google I/O keynote.

==History==
Google also used an invitation-only model for users to test Labs products including Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Wave, and many of these also have their own &quot;Labs&quot; experimental features and previews. Labs was later removed from Google Calendar.

In 2006, all Google Labs products were presented with a consistent icon, a flask, and a gray title, as opposed to other color-coded Google products, such as Google News and Google Maps.

==Discontinuation and revival==
In July 2011, Google announced that it was discontinuing Google Labs. 

Although many of the experiments have been discontinued, a few have moved to the main search pages or have been integrated into other products. Google still has many links to its defunct &quot;Labs&quot; tools in Google blogs that are readily accessible through a Google search.

In November 2021, the Google Labs brand was revived for an internal group at Google encompassing Google&#x27;s AR and VR efforts, Area 120, as well as Project Starline.

As of July 2024, Google Labs has introduced Search labs, an experimental AI assisted overview of the google search engine.

<text>William Wegman (born December 2, 1943) is an American artist best known for creating series of compositions involving dogs, primarily his own Weimaraners in various costumes and poses.

==Life and career==
Wegman originally intended to pursue a career as a painter. He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from Massachusetts College of Art and Design in 1965 and a Master of Fine Arts degree in painting from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1967. 

By the early 1970s, Wegman&#x27;s work was being exhibited in museums and galleries internationally. In addition to solo shows with Sonnabend Gallery in Paris and New York, Situation Gallery in London, and Konrad Fischer Gallery in Düsseldorf, his work was included in such seminal exhibitions as &quot;When Attitudes Become Form&quot; and &quot;Documenta 5&quot;, and regularly featured in magazines , Artforum, and Avalanche.

While he was in Long Beach, Wegman got his dog, Man Ray, with whom he began a long and fruitful collaboration. Man Ray, known in the art world and beyond for his endearing deadpan presence, became a central figure in Wegman&#x27;s photographs and videotapes. In 1982, Man Ray died, and was named &quot;Man of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. It was not until 1986 that Wegman got a new dog, Fay Ray, and another collaboration began marked by Wegman&#x27;s extensive use of the Polaroid 20 x 24 camera. With the birth of Fay&#x27;s litter in 1989, Wegman&#x27;s cast of characters grew to include Fay&#x27;s offspring — Battina, Crooky, and Chundo — and later, their offspring: Battina&#x27;s son Chip in 1995, Chip&#x27;s son Bobbin in 1999 and Candy and Bobbin&#x27;s daughter Penny in 2004.

Although primarily known as a photographer, Wegman returned to painting in the mid 1980s Among his oeuvre of paintings are a number of canvases filled with smoke and fire that depict natural and manmade disasters. &quot;Volcano&quot;, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art demonstrates this aspect of the artist&#x27;s work.

He appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; in 2010. Wegman is the author of numerous books for children, including the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller &quot;Puppies.&quot; His latest children&#x27;s book, &quot;Flo &amp; Wendell,&quot; is published with Dial Books for Young Readers.

==Exhibitions and critical context==
His work, which includes photography, video, painting and drawing, is held in permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Hammer Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Centre Pompidou, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

His work has also been a popular success, and have appeared in books, advertisements, films, as well as on television programs like &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 2006, Wegman&#x27;s work was featured in a retrospective at the Brooklyn Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Norton Museum of Art, Wexner Center for the Arts, and the Addison Gallery of American Art. The show, entitled &quot;William Wegman: Funney/Strange&quot;, explored 40 years of his work in all mediums.

==On &quot;Sesame Street&quot;==

Wegman&#x27;s dogs first appeared on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1988. Fay Ray starred in segments like &quot;Old McFay Counts to 40&quot;. In February 1996, descendants Battina (aka Batty), Crooky, Chundo, and Chip starred in new segments based on nursery rhymes. Wegman told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;They are only [being shot] maybe 30 seconds at a time. The rest of the time they&#x27;re sitting around, rather blasé about life.&quot;

Segments include:
* &quot;Old McFay Counts to 40&quot; - Old McFay counts 40 lemons, three to four limes, and one banana.
* &quot;Dog Alphabet&quot; - The dogs form all the letters of the alphabet and some of the letters they make get their own sketches.

<doc id="1340043" wikidata="Q149802" url="?curid=1340043" title="José Bonaparte">
<text>José Fernando Bonaparte (14 June 1928–18 February 2020) was an Argentine paleontologist who discovered a plethora of South American dinosaurs and mentored a new generation of Argentine paleontologists. He has been described by paleontologist Peter Dodson as &quot;almost singlehandedly...responsible for Argentina becoming the sixth country in the world in kinds of dinosaurs.&quot;

== Biography ==

Bonaparte was the son of an Italian sailor, with no close connection to Napoleon&#x27;s House of Bonaparte. He was born in Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina, and grew up in Mercedes, Buenos Aires. Despite a lack of formal training in paleontology, he started collecting fossils with many friends at an early age, and created a museum in their home town. He later became the curator of the National University of Tucumán, where he was named Doctor &quot;honoris causa&quot; in 1976, and then in the late 1970s became a senior scientist at the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales in Buenos Aires. Bonaparte was a two-time Guggenheim Fellow and since the 1970s received periodic funding from the National Geographic Society. He was reportedly hard-working, stubborn, and had a strong personality, even violent. He received another honorary degree from the National University of Comahue in 2011. Bonaparte died at dawn in his sleep on 18 February 2020 at age 91.

== Career ==

=== Discovery of southern diversity ===
Between 1975 and 1977, Bonaparte worked on excavation of &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; with Martín Vince and Juan C. Leal at the estancia &quot;El Brete.&quot; With fellow Argentine Jaime Powell, Bonaparte studied &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; and suggested that in life, it was covered in armored plates known as osteoderms. Based on this discovery, together with twenty specimens of &quot;Kritosaurus australis&quot; and a lambeosaurine dinosaur found in South America, Bonaparte hypothesized that there had been a large-scale migration of species between the Americas at the end of the Mesozoic period. Bonaparte was also the first to propose the clade abelisauridae, a grouping of ceratosaurians that were the dominant carnivores during the Cretaceous in Gondwana.

The supercontinent of Pangea split into Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south during the Jurassic. During the Cretaceous, South America pulled away from the rest of Gondwana. The division caused a divergence between the northern biota and the southern biota, and the southern animals appear strange to those used to the more northerly fauna. Bonaparte&#x27;s finds illustrate this divergence, and caused paleontologist Robert Bakker to dub him the &quot;Master of the Mesozoic.&quot;
== Discoveries ==
Bonaparte described a wide array of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, including:

*&quot;Abelisaurus comahuensis&quot; (1985)
*&quot;Agustinia ligabuei&quot; (1998)
*&quot;Alvarezsaurus calvoi&quot; (1991)
*&quot;Amargasaurus cazaui&quot; (1991)
*&quot;Andesaurus delgadoi&quot; (1991)
*&quot;Argentinosaurus huinculensis&quot; (1993)
*&quot;Argyrosaurus superbus&quot; (1984)
*&quot;Carnotaurus sastrei&quot; (1985),
*&quot;Coloradisaurus brevis&quot; (1978)
*&quot;Guaibasaurus candelariensis&quot; (1998)
*&quot;Kritosaurus australis&quot; (1984)
*&quot;Lapparentosaurus madagascariensis&quot; (1986)
*&quot;Ligabueino andesi&quot; (1996)
*&quot;Mussaurus patagonicus&quot; (1979)
*&quot;Noasaurus leali&quot; (1980)
*&quot;Piatnitzkysaurus floresi&quot; (1979)
*&quot;Rayososaurus agrioensis&quot; (1996)
*&quot;Riograndia guaibensis&quot; (2001)
*&quot;Riojasaurus incertus&quot; (1969)
*&quot;Saltasaurus loricatus&quot; (1980)
*&quot;Velocisaurus unicus&quot; (1991)
*&quot;Volkheimeria chubutensis&quot; (1979)
*&quot;Ligabuesaurus leanzai&quot; (2006)

He also contributed to the description of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;.

== Philosophy ==
Bonaparte was a traditionalist and did not use modern cladistic methods, which apply the principle of parsimony to a vast array of synapomorphies. Partly for this reason, he declined to work on the modern treatise &quot;The Dinosauria&quot;, published in 1990. However, in 2000 Bonaparte began to use cladograms. For instance, his studies of sauropods (e.g., &quot;Ligabuesaurus&quot;) and proto-mammals from Brazil show cladograms made by himself and co-authors. While he is best known for his dinosaur discoveries, he preferred to study the fossils of mammals.

His students included Rodolfo Coria, Luis Chiappe, Fernando Novas, Jaime Powell, Guillermo W. Rougier, Leonardo Salgado, Jorge Calvo, Sebastián Apesteguía and Agustín Martinelli.

<doc id="1340048" wikidata="Q6285654" url="?curid=1340048" title="Joseph Moskowitz">
<text>Joseph Moskowitz (, 1879 – June 1954) was an American cimbalom player, composer, restaurant owner and recording artist in New York City during the first half of the twentieth century. A descendant of a family of klezmer musicians, he was among the most well-known American cimbalom players of his time, and had a wide repertoire which included not only Jewish music but also Romanian, classical, and ragtime music. He is thought to have composed over 100 cimbalom pieces which drew upon various musical influences. His restaurant Moskowitz &amp; Lupowitz, on Second Avenue also became a popular destination and celebrity hangout in the 1920s and 1930s.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Moskowitz was born in Galați, Romania, in July 1879. His father Moses Moskowitz (nicknamed Moshe Tsimbler) was a klezmer musician and cimbalom player who was Joseph&#x27;s first teacher. Joseph learned the cimbalom as well as the violin from his father. Another relative, Joseph&#x27;s cousin nicknamed Jonah Tsimbler (Diamant) also became a cimbalom player. Joseph was a childhood friend of the writer Konrad Bercovici, also born in Galați. 
As a youth, Joseph toured Hungary, Romania, Galicia, and Istanbul, and played on river boats on the Danube. He apparently toured and performed with Broder singer troupes as well. He emigrated to the United States in December 1907 with his wife Rebecca, sailing from Bremen.
===Music and restaurant career===
Moskowitz&#x27;s original reason to travel to the United States was apparently an invitation to perform in Boston. After making appearances in cafés there and in New York, Moskowitz toured the United States for the next five years, often with the Matus Gypsy Ensemble or in hotel orchestras. That tour apparently did a lot to develop what would become his style and repertoire, which came to include not only Jewish and Romanian music but also international cosmopolitan repertoire and contemporary American music. At some point between 1909 and 1913 (sources disagree), he opened a restaurant, the &quot;Moskowitz Wine Cellar&quot;, on Rivington Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. His wife was the cook. This restaurant was a narrow cellar lit by gas lamps, with pastoral Romanian scenes painted on the wall, where up to a hundred customers smoked and drank wine while listening to his playing. He became a Naturalized citizen of the United States in March 1915.

His recording career began in 1916, a time when the &quot;ethnic&quot; recording industry in New York was expanding aggressively. He recorded roughly 30 sides for Victor Records in 1916-7, including especially Romanian music, but also ragtime, klezmer, and various European and South American pieces. His recordings from that era were all made with piano accompaniment, usually by Max Yussim, who he occasionally performed in concert with as well. His wide performing repertoire and deep knowledge of Romanian music also apparently influenced other Jewish recording artists in the New York area, such as Dave Tarras.

He soon relocated to Houston Street and opened &quot;Little Rumania&quot;. The restaurant became quite popular, especially among Romanian Jews and young writers, and was soon expanded into the adjoining cellar to make room for the growing clientele. There, Moskowitz played his instrument, often sharing the stage with top violinists and pianists. Stephen Graham, a British writer who spent time in New York in the 1920s, wrote an account of a night he spent in &quot;Little Rumania&quot;. He said that earlier in the evening, Moskowitz circulated among the guests while a singer and pianist performed Yiddish and American numbers. Then, when the place was full, Moskowitz got on stage and performed various European folk numbers (Romanian, Hungarian, Russian, French) as well as some light classical music by Tchaikovsky and Brahms. It was only much later in the night that he would play dance tunes which were danced by a group of Jewish men.
He later opened a new restaurant on Second Avenue at Second Street called Moskowitz &amp; Lupowitz. This new upscale restaurant began to attract celebrities, bohemians, and writers, including Jascha Heifetz, Eddie Cantor, Sid Caesar, Mischa Elman, Joseph Pulitzer, Abraham Reisen and H. L. Mencken. He continued to entertain his patrons with his music performances late into the night, as they ate the hearty Romanian Jewish cuisine.

In the 1920s Moskowitz regularly performed on the radio in the New York area, on stations such as WGBS, WEAF, and the WJZ network. These were often solo performances, but also often included accompaniment by his longtime pianist Max Yussim. The music he played on the radio often consisted of classical works or his own arrangements of Russian, Romanian and Jewish folk music. He also came to the attention of Samuel Roxy Rothafel and became an occasional featured artist of his popular &quot;Roxy and the Gang&quot; series. Moskowitz appeared on stage regularly in this era as well, including at Carnegie Hall and New York&#x27;s Town Hall. Joseph remarried in March 1924 to his second wife Rose.

Although he recorded occasionally in the early 1920s, his next major phase of recording seems to have been in 1927-8, when he recorded a few more solo records and around 10 klezmer and Romanian pieces with Alexander Olshanetsky&#x27;s orchestra on Brunswick Records, featuring Shloimke Beckerman on clarinet.

In the 1930s, Moskowitz continued to operate his restaurant and perform. He seems to have toured in Montreal in 1936. He is thought to have made an uncredited appearance playing his cimbalom in two restaurant scenes in Joseph Seiden&#x27;s 1939 Yiddish language talkie (The Living Orphan). Moskowitz finally left New York in around 1940. He had a dispute with Lupowitz and decide to sell his share in the restaurant. Louis Anzelowitz, who had been a butcher in the restaurant, bought Joseph&#x27;s shares and eventually became the sole owner, operating it until 1966. Under the new management, the restaurant kept the Moskowitz &amp; Lupowitz name and continued to attract celebrities. 
After leaving New York, Moskowitz lived in Akron, Ohio starting in around 1940, playing concerts at the Jewish Center there and in the Romany Restaurant. He also continued to compose new music while in Akron, sometimes under the name Joseph Moss. By 1943, he left Akron and relocated to Washington, D.C. In Washington, Joseph played regularly at Michel&#x27;s French Restaurant near Dupont Circle from 1943 until his death. His final recording session in Washington in 1953 was released as a 10-inch record, &quot;Cymbalom Melodies&quot;, on Romany Records. It was recorded at Michel&#x27;s Restaurant with Bela Hargy accompanying him on piano, and consisted mainly of Romanian music. (Selections from that album, along with many of his earlier recordings, were reissued by Rounder Records in 1996 on the cd &quot;The Art Of The Cymbalom: The Music Of Joseph Moskowitz 1916–1953&quot;)

He died of heart problems at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C., on June 27, 1954; he was 76 years old. He was buried in the Mount Lebanon Cemetery in Adelphi, Maryland.

==Popular culture==
Moskowitz and his restaurant appeared in a number of memoirs and novels in his time, including &quot;New York Nights&quot; (1927) by Stephen Graham, &quot;Jews without Money&quot; (1930) by Mike Gold, &quot;Dust of New York&quot; (1919) by his childhood friend Konrad Bercovici, and (1963) by Chaver-Paver (Gershon Aynbinder).

Moskowitz claimed to have composed over 100 pieces during his life, although it is unclear how many were adaptations of existing folk melodies. During the Klezmer revival of the late 1970s and 1980s, there was renewed interest in finding, reissuing and reinterpreting old recordings of Jewish music. Interpretations of his recordings and compositions were made by groups such as the Klezmer Conservatory Band, The Klezmatics and the Flying Bulgar Klezmer Band. Moskowitz&#x27;s original tracks also appeared on a number of reissue compilations over the years, including &quot;Classic Ragtime&quot; (RCA Victor/BMG, 1998), &quot;Klezmer Pioneers: European and American Recordings, 1905-1952&quot; (Rounder Records, 1993), &quot;From Avenue A to the Great White Way&quot; (Columbia Records, 2002), &quot;Klezmer Music: Early Yiddish Instrumental Music: 1908-1927&quot; (Arhoolie Records, 1997), as well as an entire reissue CD dedicated to his recordings: &quot;The Art of the Cymbalum&quot; (Rounder Records, 1996).

<text>The UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee (or UK-APC) is a United Kingdom government committee, part of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, responsible for recommending names of geographical locations within the British Antarctic Territory (BAT) and the South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI). Such names are formally approved by the Commissioners of the BAT and SGSSI respectively and published in the BAT Gazetteer and the SGSSI Gazetteer maintained by the Committee. The BAT names are also published in the international Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica maintained by SCAR.

The Committee may also consider proposals for new place names for geographical features in areas of Antarctica outside BAT and SGSSI, which are referred to other Antarctic place-naming authorities or decided by the Committee itself if situated in the unclaimed sector of Antarctica.

<text>A gancanagh () () is a male fairy from the mythology of Northern Ireland, known for seducing women.

== Etymology ==
The name has been rendered under various spellings including geancánach or ganconer.

Sources collected from County Meath by the Irish Folklore Commission indicate that the word (pronounced gankanah or gankaneh) could also mean a small or precocious child, indicating fairylike smallness.

== Legend ==
In 1888, W. B. Yeats noted that the gancanagh was not found in dictionaries and the fairy was not well-known in Connacht.

In a story collected in &quot;The Dublin and London Magazine&quot; in 1825, ganconer is defined as &quot;a name given to the fairies, alias the &#x27;good people,&#x27; in the North of Ireland.&quot; They are described as little men who live in caves, led by Captain Dearg (The Red Captain). One ganconer kidnaps a human woman, and her sweetheart must win her back on Halloween night. He catches her at a crossroads, but she is caught between him and the ganconers and dies. In another story in the same magazine, a group of ganconers plays hurling, and carries off a widow’s cow to a fairyland beneath the lake of Loughleagh. The owner retrieves the cow, but the moment someone says the name of God nearby, the cow sinks into the ground never to be seen again.

According to Nicholas O’Kearney writing in 1855, the Geancanach was a little man similar to the Leprechaun, but lazier. He appeared in lonesome valleys with a dudeen, a short clay pipe which was consequently known as “the Geancanagh’s pipe.” (The dudeen was also associated with the Cluricaune, another fairy.) The Geancanagh seduced shepherdesses and milkmaids. It was considered highly unlucky to meet him, and any man who had wasted his money chasing after women was said to have met a Geancanagh.

Captain Dearg and an army of ganconers appeared in the poetry of John O’Hanlon as fairy soldiers who ride through the air. O’Hanlon identified ganconer as an alternate name for the fairies or little folk.

Irish poet Ethna Carbery characterized the “Love-Talker” as a handsome incubus-like fairy with black eyes. He has no shadow, and his approach is accompanied by a mist. He seduces maidens, leaving them to waste away and die afterwards. He is banished by the sign of the cross, but too late for the protagonist of the poem, who has already kissed him.

In one 20th-century story collected by the Irish Folklore Commission, a geancanagh stars in a leprechaun-like role. He is captured and forced to show where his gold is buried, only to trick his captor.

==In popular culture==

* W.B. Yeats used &quot;Ganconagh&quot; as a pseudonym.
* In the series of books &quot;&quot;Wicked Lovely&quot; of Melissa Marr, two characters, Irial and Niall, are gancanaghs. 
* In the series of books &quot;The Folk of Air&quot;&quot; of Holly Black, the characters of Liriope and her sons, Locke and Oak, are gancanaghs.

<text>Jan Egeland (born 12 September 1957) is a Norwegian diplomat, political scientist, humanitarian leader, and former Labour Party politician who has been Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council since 2013. He served as State Secretary in the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1990 to 1997 and as United Nations Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator from 2003 to 2006.

Over the course of his career, Egeland has also served as Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Director of Human Rights Watch Europe, Director of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, Secretary General of the Norwegian Red Cross, and Chair of Amnesty International Norway. He also holds a post as Professor II at the University of Stavanger.

==Early life and education==
The son of Norwegian politician Kjølv Egeland, Egeland attended Stavanger Cathedral School. He holds a mag.art. in Political Science from the University of Oslo. He was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, where his thesis, contrasting American and Scandinavian diplomatic models, was published as a book. He was also a fellow at the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) and The Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace, Jerusalem.

==Career==
===Early beginnings===
Egeland began working with Amnesty International while in high school, campaigning for the disappeared in Chile in the 1970s, and at age 19 spent a month working for Catholic relief organization Minuto de Dios with the Motilon people in Colombia.

Egeland later served as Chair of Amnesty International in Norway, and Vice-Chair of the International Executive Committee of Amnesty International, which he was elected on to at the age of 23, the youngest ever to hold the position. He also worked as Director for the International Department of the Norwegian Red Cross, Head of Development Studies at the Henry Dunant Institute in Geneva and a radio and television international news reporter for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation.

Egeland first attracted attention as Secretary General of the Norwegian Red Cross when he pioneered the fight against the proliferation of small arms and joined the international campaign against landmines. With the onset of war in Iraq in 2003, Egeland alerted the international community to the worsening civilian conditions in Baghdad and Basra.

===Roles in government===
Egeland&#x27;s career also includes service to his government as State Secretary in the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1990 to 1997. In that capacity, he initiated two Norwegian Emergency Preparedness Systems, which have provided more than 2,000 experts and humanitarian workers to international organizations.

During his time in office, Egeland actively participated in a number of peace processes. He co-initiated and co-organized the Norwegian channel between Israel and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1992, which led to the Oslo Accord (Declaration of Principles) of September 1993. He directed the Norwegian facilitation of the United Nations-led peace talks leading up to ceasefire agreement between the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) guerrillas signed in Oslo in 1996. He also led the host delegation when the Ottawa Treaty to ban landmines was successfully negotiated and adopted in Oslo in 1997.

===Career with the UN===
After stepping down from his government position, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Egeland as his Special Adviser to Colombia. Egeland served in this role from 1999 until 2002.

Egeland assumed his post as the Under-Secretary-General (USG) for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) in August 2003. This position is the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). He was preceded in the post by Kenzo Oshima of Japan. During his time in office, he initiated the global humanitarian reforms that led to the successful Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) in 2005.

Egeland focused his efforts in alleviating the needs of this sector of the population in complex emergency situations like the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army insurgency in northern Uganda, the Darfur region in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where millions of displaced persons are affected. He has also campaigned for addressing the needs of those affected by natural disasters, like the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, as well as raising awareness in issues such as gender mainstreaming, sexual exploitation and violence, and internal displacement.

Ahead of the Vienna peace talks for Syria in 2015, Egeland was appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to head the working group on safety and protection, in this capacity supporting United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura. From 2016 until 2018, he served as de Mistura&#x27;s humanitarian adviser. In early 2021, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres appointed him to a three‑person Independent Senior Advisory Panel on Syria, alongside Erika Feller and Radhouane Noucier. The panel was to provide Guterres with advice on how to strengthen the deconfliction mechanism operated by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the country.

==Other activities==
* International Crisis Group (ICG), Member of the Board of Trustees (since 2010)
* Humanitarian Leadership Academy, Chairman of the Board of Trustees (2015-2016)
* Overseas Development Institute (ODI), Member of the High Level Panel on Humanitarian Cash Transfers (2015)
* Refugee Studies Centre, Oxford Department of International Development, University of Oxford, Honorary Associate 
* The Global Executive Leadership Initiative (GELI), Executive Board Member
* Grand Bargain, Eminent Person (appointed 2021)

==Political positions==
In a United Kingdom Channel 4 interview Egeland laid the blame on the crisis in Lebanon on Hezbollah who he said &quot;Hide amongst the civilian population and which gives the Israeli air force no choice but to attack civilian structures,&quot; though he also has referred to the Israeli strikes as &quot;a violation of humanitarian law&quot;.

On 28 July 2006, during the Israel–Hezbollah War, he proposed a 72-hour cease fire between Israel and Hezbollah in order for emergency relief to move the wounded and get food and medical supplies into the war zone. Israel rejected the proposal, claiming that the humanitarian corridor it opened to and from Lebanon was sufficient for the purpose. Egeland responded that &quot;Hizbollah is not necessarily the biggest obstacle to an agreement&quot;. Israel later agreed to a 48-hour halt of bombing, while reserving the right to take action against targets preparing attacks.

In March 2008, Egeland gave a lecture entitled &quot;War, Peace and Climate Change: A Billion Lives in the Balance&quot; at the University of San Diego&#x27;s Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace &amp; Justice Distinguished Lecture Series.

===Tsunami relief===
On 27 December 2004, during the initial phase of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake relief effort, Egeland said that &quot;Christmas time should remind many Western countries how rich we have become, and if actually the foreign assistance of many countries now is 0.1 or 0.2 percent of their gross national income, I think that is stingy, really.&quot; According to Egeland, in his memoir &quot;A Billion Lives&quot; (2008), this &quot;stingy&quot; quote was taken out of context by the press as directed at tsunami relief, when in fact Egeland was addressing the long and ongoing drive by the UN for all OECD nations to contribute 0.7% of GNP to humanitarian efforts. Initial response by the White House to Egeland&#x27;s quote, taken out of context by the press as a direct attack on the United States (which at the time had donated $15 million), was very negative. However, Egeland subsequently clarified his remarks, and all was forgiven, although Egeland became the focus of a negative campaign online. However the &quot;stingy&quot; quote did in fact help increase the number of donations. Egeland was later quoted as saying that the donations were so large and were coming in so fast that &quot;We really have to confirm that we heard right, that the number of zeroes was right.&quot; When reviewing the tangible, if non-monetary, assistance of the militaries of the United States, Australia, and other nations in providing disaster relief, Egeland remarked, &quot;Those helicopters are worth their weight in gold now.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine would later call Egeland &quot;the world&#x27;s conscience.&quot;

===Lebanese aid===
In July 2006, Egeland launched a US$150 million aid appeal for Lebanon, following the destruction of parts of Lebanon by Israeli forces during the 2006 Lebanon War and subsequent displacement of many thousands of refugees.

Egeland, though critical of Israel, lashed out against Hezbollah in terms that no UN official had dared yet, saying:

Consistently, from the Hezbollah heartland, my message was that Hezbollah must stop this cowardly blending ... among women and children. I heard they were proud because they lost very few fighters and that it was the civilians bearing the brunt of this. I don&#x27;t think anyone should be proud of having many more children and women dead than armed men. We need a cessation of hostilities because this is a war where civilians are paying the price.

===Gaza violence===
During a visit to the Gaza Strip to survey the damage, Egeland was quoted as saying that the bombing of a power plant would affect schools and hospitals more than the militants. &quot;This is very clear, a disproportionate use [of power],&quot; Egeland told reporters. &quot;Civilian infrastructure is protected. The law is very clear. You cannot have any interpretation in any other way.&quot;

Egeland criticized the October 2023 Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, saying that &quot;collective punishment is in violation of international law. If and when it would lead to wounded children dying in hospitals because of a lack of energy, electricity and supplies, it could amount to war crime.&quot; Furthermore, in light of the escalating violence in late 2023, Egeland issued a statement emphasizing the immense suffering of innocent Palestinians due to indiscriminate bombardments and sieges. He expressed deep concern over the inadequate humanitarian response, underscoring that world leaders&#x27; failure to act condemns future generations of Palestinians and Israelis to continued conflict. Egeland urged for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, stating that &quot;history will be watching&quot;.

===Syrian Civil War===
Egeland has chaired the United Nations panel on humanitarian access in the lengthy war in Syria and in 2017 was the UN Senior Advisor for Syria where he has advocated for simultaneous convoy exchanges and medical evacuations.

==Publications==
In 1989, Egeland wrote &quot;Impotent Superpower–Potent Small State&quot;, in which he portrayed Norway, which at the time devoted the highest percentage of its money to the development of any country in the world, as a &quot;moral entrepreneur&quot;&quot;.&quot; In 2008, he published a memoir, &quot;A Billion Lives:&quot;&quot;An Eyewitness Report from the Frontlines of Humanity&quot;, about his time at the UN from 2003 to 2006.

==Criticism==
Egeland has been criticized for the way he handles relief programs.

In 2007, the Norwegian TV channel &quot;TV2&quot; aired a documentary entitled &quot;De hvite hjelperne&quot; (&quot;The white helpers&quot;) with footage and research from Malawi concerning the Norwegian Red Cross&#x27;s donation of hundreds of Norwegian army surplus M621 trucks. The documentary highlighted the trucks&#x27; primitive construction and poor condition, and general uselessness to the Malawi community. Although Egeland and the Red Cross declared this operation a success, the trucks were little more than scrap metal.

In March 2008, TV2 aired another documentary entitled &quot;Sultbløffen&quot; (&quot;The famine scam&quot;) about the 2005–06 Niger food crisis. Then-UN relief coordinator Egeland was, along with several others, accused of bluffing and of blowing the situation out of proportion.

==Recognition==
===Awards===
* 2005 – Peer Gynt Prize
* 2005 – Roger E. Joseph Prize by Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion
* 2008 – Four Freedoms Award

===Other accolades===
In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Egeland one of the 100 &quot;people who shape our world&quot;.

In 2012, the Norwegian group Ylvis produced a parody/tribute rock song about Jan Egeland, hailing him as &quot;the United Nations superhero man&quot; and &quot;a peacekeeping machine&quot;. Egeland&#x27;s response, in an e-mail to NPR, was &quot;I think it is hilarious with its crazy text and great tune.&quot; As of April 2024, the video has been viewed more than 20 million times.

==Personal life==
Egeland was married to former Norwegian Minister of International Development Anne Kristin Sydnes until her death in 2017, and has two daughters.

<text>Anostraca is one of the four orders of crustaceans in the class Branchiopoda; its members are referred to as fairy shrimp. They live in vernal pools and hypersaline lakes across the world, and they have even been found in deserts, ice-covered mountain lakes, and Antarctic ice. They are usually long (exceptionally up to ). Most species have 20 body segments, bearing 11 pairs of leaf-like &quot;phyllopodia&quot; (swimming legs), and the body lacks a carapace. They swim &quot;upside-down&quot; and feed by filtering organic particles from the water or by scraping algae from surfaces, with the exception of &quot;Branchinecta gigas,&quot; or &quot;giant fairy shrimp&quot;, which is itself a predator of other species of anostracans. They are an important food for many birds and fish, and some are cultured and harvested for use as fish food. There are 300 species spread across 8 families.

==Description==
The body of a fairy shrimp is elongated and divided into segments. The whole animal is typically long, but one species, &quot;Branchinecta gigas&quot; does not reach sexual maturity until it reaches long, and can grow to long. The exoskeleton is thin and flexible, and lacks any sign of a carapace. The body can be divided into three distinct parts (tagmata) – head, thorax and abdomen.

===Head===

The head is morphologically distinct from the thorax. It bears two compound eyes on prominent stalks, and two pairs of antennae. The first pair of antennae are small, usually unsegmented, and uniramous. The second pair are long and cylindrical in females, but in males they are enlarged and specialised for holding the female during mating. In some groups, males have an additional frontal appendage.

===Thorax and abdomen===

The thorax of most anostracans has 13 segments (19 in &quot;Polyartemiella&quot; and 21 in &quot;Polyartemia&quot;). All but the last two are very similar, with a pair of biramous phyllopods (flattened, leaf-like appendages). The last two segments are fused together, and their appendages are specialised for reproduction. Most anostracans have separate sexes (gonochorism), but a few reproduce by parthenogenesis. The abdomen comprises 6 segments without appendages, and a telson, which bears two flattened caudal rami or &quot;cercopods&quot;.

===Internal anatomy===
The head contains two digestive glands and the small lobate stomach into which they empty. This is connected to a long intestine, which terminates in a short rectum, with the anus located on the telson. The haemocoel of anostracans is pumped by a long, tubular heart, which runs through most of the animal&#x27;s length. A series of slits allow haemocoel into the heart, which is then pumped out of the anterior opening by peristalsis. The nervous system consists of two nerve cords which run the length of the body, with two ganglia and two transverse commissures in most of the body segments.

Gas exchange is thought to take place through the entire body surface, but especially that of the phyllopodia and their associated gills, which may also be responsible for osmotic regulation. Two coiled glands at the bases of the maxillae are used to excrete nitrogenous waste, typically in the form of urea. Most of the animal&#x27;s nitrogenous waste is, however, in the form of ammonia, which probably diffuses into the environment through the phyllopodia and gills.

==Ecology and behaviour==
Anostracans inhabit inland waters ranging from hypersaline lakes to lakes that are almost devoid of dissolved substances; they are &quot;the most archetypal crustaceans&quot; in ephemeral waters. The relatively large size of fairy shrimp, together with their slow means of locomotion, makes them an easy target for predatory fish and waterfowl. This has led to their distribution being restricted to environments with fewer predators, such as vernal pools, salt lakes and lakes at high altitudes or latitudes. The southernmost recorded fairy shrimp is &quot;Branchinecta gaini&quot; from the Antarctic Peninsula, while the altitude record is held by &quot;B. brushi&quot;, which lives at in the Chilean Andes. Other genera, such as &quot;Streptocephalus&quot;, occur in deserts throughout the world.

Anostracans swim gracefully by movements of their phyllopodia (thoracic appendages) in a metachronal rhythm. When swimming, the animal&#x27;s ventral side is normally uppermost (often described as swimming &quot;upside-down&quot;). They filter food indiscriminately from the water as they swim, but also scrape algae and other organic materials from solid surfaces, for which they turn to have their ventral side against the food surface.

Another important aspect of the fairy shrimp’s life cycle is their universal ability to enter diapause, a state of biological dormancy where growth and metabolism are arrested, as an egg (or cyst). This trait assists in both species&#x27; dispersal and in overcoming adverse environmental conditions. Once dormant, these cysts can withstand conditions as harsh and diverse as droughts, frosts, hypersalinity, complete desiccation, exposure to UV radiation and the vacuum of space. It is also the only way for the fairy shrimps to colonize new habitats—facilitated by a variety of conditions including wind, predators, currents—as the soft-bodied adults are unable to leave the freshwater system. Once in diapause, these cysts can remain viable for centuries, and the mixing of system sediment results in the hatching of different aged cysts in each generation. This inbreeding slows the rate of selection by resisting gene flow and minimizing phenotypic variation, in turn promoting the stability of the existing, successful phenotype.

Anostracans are an important food source for many birds and fish. For example, they provide much of the food for female pintails and mallards in the Prairie Pothole Region of the Great Plains in North America, especially in years when temporary wetlands are abundant. Similarly, &quot;Artemia&quot; forms an important part of the diet of flamingos wherever it can be found.

==Uses==

Brine shrimp are used as food for fish and other organisms in aquaria and aquaculture. Their drought-resistant eggs are collected from lakeshores and are stored and transported dry. They hatch readily when submerged in salt water. This is a multimillion-dollar industry, centred on the Great Salt Lake in Utah and San Francisco Bay in California; adults are collected from Mono Lake and transported frozen.

==Fossil record and evolution==
Fairy shrimp are believed to have diverged from the main line of Branchiopoda during the Ordovician period, around the same time it is thought they colonized freshwater and estuarine ecosystems. This transition is believed to have resulted from selection pressure to escape predation in the Early Paleozoic seas. &quot;Lepidocaris&quot; from the early Devonian Rhynie chert is likely a close relative of Anostraca. The oldest known modern-looking ansotracan is &quot;Haltinnaias&quot; from the late Devonian (Famennian) Strud locality of Belgium, around 365 million years old.

Some studies point to fossils resembling fairy shrimp in the Upper Cambrian, specifically the oldest known branchiopod fossil, &quot;Rehbachiella kinnekullensis&quot;, from Orsten marine deposits. Despite its seeming resemblance to modern fairy shrimp, this fossil is still considered by most to be an outlying member of the ancestral marine Branchiopoda rather than an actual fairy shrimp.

The monophyly of this order is well supported, and the scientific community has reached consensus that Anostraca was the first group to branch off from the Branchiopoda.

The radiation hypothesis championing rapid spread and colonization during the Gondwana fragmentation closely echoes the current distribution of the order. Presently, Anostraca are found on all seven continents. Most extant genera have restricted geographical distributions. Only three genera are widespread across the remnants of the former supercontinent Pangaea: &quot;Artemia&quot;, &quot;Branchinella&quot; and &quot;Branchinecta&quot;, while the remaining genera are found only throughout former Laurasia. This suggests that much of the potential habitat in this supercontinent, now occupied by Anostraca, was previously unoccupied by ecologically similar species, or inhabited by species with less adaptive ability. Studies have found Anostraca capable of rapid colonization and speciation.

==Diversity==

Anostraca is the most diverse of the four orders of Branchiopoda. It comprises around 313 species, grouped into 26 genera in eight families:
* Artemiidae – 1 genus, 8 species
* Branchinectidae – 1 genus, 45 species
* Branchipodidae – 5 genera, 35 species
* Chirocephalidae – 9 genera, 81 species
* Parartemiidae – 1 genus, 18 species
* Streptocephalidae – 1 genus, 56 species
* Tanymastigidae – 2 genera, 8 species
* Thamnocephalidae – 6 genera, 62 species

==Fairy Shrimp in Popular Culture==
Fairy Shrimp has been a student favorite as the mascot of UC Merced. There have been several efforts to make this animal the official mascot of the campus. Still, in 2001 the bobcat was chosen instead. Fairy shrimp had also been the focus of a challenge to the location of where the campus would be built because of their nearby vernal pool habitat.

<text>National Heroes of Nepal () is a list of 18 Nepali people, including those from ancient and medieval times, who were selected to their ranks posthumously by a commission headed by famous writer Balkrishna Sama who was appointed by King Mahendra, in 1955. The commission was directed to make nominations on the basis of their contributions to the nation, its influence and consequences. On these accounts, the commission nominated individuals for their contributions to the pride of the nation, be it in religious, cultural or economic reforms, wartime bravery, promoting the cause of democracy, literature and architecture.

The title National Heroes of Nepal is only offered posthumously and is not a regular title or award, but conferred only upon the discussions of the commission now led by Nepal Academy.

On 20 June 2022, the government of Nepal declared Jaya Prithvi Bahadur Singh as a national hero. His is also the most recent nomination as a national hero.

== List of national heroes of Nepal ==
The 18 national heroes of Nepal are:

#Gautam Buddha
#King janak
#Anshuverma
#Sita

<text>Pasang Lhamu Sherpa (Sherpa: , ; 10 December 1961 – 22 April 1993) was the first Nepalese woman to climb the summit of Mount Everest.

==Climbing career==
She was born into a mountaineering family and was involved in climbing from her teens. She had successfully climbed Mount Blanc, Mount Cho Oyu, Mount Yalapic, Pisang Himal, and others. She had attempted to climb Mount Everest three times but did not succeed until April 22, 1993, when she reached the summit by the South Col via the Southeast Ridge route.

The morning of April 22, 1993, was bright and clear and remained so until Pasang reached the top of the 8,848 m. peak with five Sherpas, Sonam Tshering Sherpa, Lhakpa Norbu Sherpa, Pemba Dorje Sherpa, and Dawa Tashi Sherpa. Meanwhile, a member of the team and five-time Everest summitter Sonam Tshering Sherpa got seriously sick at south summit and, despite Pasang Lhamu&#x27;s efforts to help, did not survive his illness. While descending from the summit, the weather, as often happens in the mountains, suddenly turned bad, causing her to lose her own life on the south summit. Vladas Vitkauskas helped move her body down the mountain.

For achieving what no other Nepalese woman had achieved before her, Pasang Lhamu was posthumously honored by her country and mountaineers all around the world in various ways. She was the very first woman to be decorated with the &quot;Nepal Tara (Star)&quot; by the King of Nepal. The National Youth Foundation conferred the 1993-94 Youth Excellence Award on her. Similarly, in order to commemorate her feat, a life-size statue of Pasang Lhamu was erected at Bouddha, Chuchepati; a postage stamp was issued in her name; the Government of Nepal renamed Jasamba Himal (7,315 m) in the Mahalangur Range as Pasang Lhamu Peak; the Ministry of Agriculture named a special strain of wheat as Pasang Lhamu wheat; the Pasang Lhamu Memorial Hall was established in Dhulabari of Jhapa district in east Nepal; and the 117 km Trishuli-Dunche road was named the Pasang Lhamu Highway.

==Biographical documentary==

In 2022, a biographical documentary titled &quot;&quot; was released, chronicling the life and legacy of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa. Directed by Nancy Svendsen, the film highlights her extraordinary journey to become the first Nepali woman to summit Mount Everest and the challenges she faced in her pursuit. Executive Producer Alison Levine supported the project, which took over ten years to complete.

&quot;Pasang: In the Shadow of Everest&quot; had its world premiere at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival on March 3rd, 2022. and has been well-received by critics and audiences alike. The film has screened at 45 film festivals worldwide and won twenty awards.

==Moon crater named after Pasang Lhamu==

In 2024, the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature named a crater on the Moon&#x27;s South Pole &quot;Lhamu&quot; in honor of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa. This recognition was made official by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the name was approved on July 29, 2024. The Lhamu Crater is located on an important mountain near the lunar South Pole. This significant honor highlights Pasang Lhamu Sherpa&#x27;s legacy as the first Nepali woman to summit Mount Everest. The Nepali embassy in Washington D.C. remarked on the occasion, stating, &quot;Her extraordinary achievement has opened doors for young Nepali women and inspired countless women worldwide to aim for even greater heights, not only in mountaineering but in all walks of life.&quot;

<doc id="1340075" wikidata="Q262735" url="?curid=1340075" title="Richard Fleischer">
<text>Richard Owen Fleischer (; December 8, 1916 – March 25, 2006) was an American film director. His career spanned more than four decades, beginning at the height of the Golden Age of Hollywood and lasting through the American New Wave. He was the son of animation pioneer Max Fleischer, and served as chairman of Fleischer Studios. 

Though he directed films across many genres and styles, he is best known for his big-budget, &quot;tentpole&quot; films, including: &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954), &quot;The Vikings&quot; (1958), &quot;Barabbas&quot; (1961), &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1966), the musical film &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1967), the war epic &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970), the dystopian mystery-thriller &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973), the controversial period drama &quot;Mandingo&quot; (1975), and the Robert E. Howard sword-and-sorcery films &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; (1984) and &quot;Red Sonja&quot; (1985). His other directorial credits include the Academy Award-winning documentary &quot;Design for Death&quot; (1947), the gritty noir &quot;The Narrow Margin&quot; (1952), the true-crime dramas &quot;Compulsion&quot; (1959), &quot;The Boston Strangler&quot; (1968) and &quot;10 Rillington Place&quot; (1971), the mob action film &quot;The Don Is Dead&quot; (1973), the swashbuckler &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1977), the 1980 remake of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and the horror sequel &quot;Amityville 3-D&quot; (1983). 

Fleischer worked with many of the top Hollywood stars of his time, including: Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum, James Mason, Tony Curtis, Victor Mature, Richard Egan, Ray Milland, Farley Granger, Orson Welles, Diane Varsi, Anthony Quinn, Rex Harrison, Anthony Newley, Mia Farrow, George C. Scott, Charles Bronson, Richard Attenborough, Charlton Heston, Lee Marvin, Glenda Jackson, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was noted for his versatility, able to work in almost any genre under wildly varying conditions and budgets, making him a popular and prolific choice for producers and studios.

Though Fleischer was never considered an auteur and was not a highly acclaimed artist, many of his films proved very financially and critically successful, winning accolades and being some of the highest-grossing features of their respective release years.

==Early life and education==
Richard Fleischer was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, the son of Essie (née Goldstein) and animator/producer Max Fleischer, a native of Kraków, Austria, now Poland. After graduating from Brown University, he went to Yale School of Drama, where he met his future wife, Mary Dickson.

Fleischer served in the U.S. Army during World War II. His film career began in 1942 at the RKO studio, directing shorts, documentaries, and compilations of forgotten silent features, which he called &quot;Flicker Flashbacks&quot;. He won an Academy Award as producer of the 1947 documentary &quot;Design for Death&quot;, co-written by Theodor Geisel (later known as Dr. Seuss), which examined the cultural forces that led to Japan&#x27;s imperial expansion through World War II.

==Career==
===B movies===
Fleischer moved to Los Angeles and was assigned his first feature, &quot;Child of Divorce&quot; (1946), a vehicle for Sharyn Moffett. It was successful so Fleischer was assigned to &quot;Banjo&quot;, another Moffett vehicle, which was a disaster.

RKO agreed to loan him to Stanley Kramer and Carl Foreman, who had admired &quot;Child of Divorce&quot;, to make &quot;So This Is New York&quot; (1948) for the Kramer Company at Columbia. Back at RKO, Fleischer made &quot;The Clay Pigeon&quot;, a thriller based on a story by Foreman.

His other early films were taut film noirs, such as: &quot;Bodyguard&quot; (1948), &quot;Follow Me Quietly&quot; (1949), &quot;Armored Car Robbery&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Narrow Margin&quot; (1952).

Fleischer said he constantly tried to graduate to A pictures during this time. When Norman Krasna and Jerry Wald set up at RKO, they asked Fleischer to see if he could make a film out of any of the film shot for &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot; but he was unable. Another project that did not come to fruition was a film starring Al Jolson.

RKO&#x27;s owner Howard Hughes was impressed by &quot;The Narrow Margin&quot; and hired Fleischer to re-write and re-shoot the majority of &quot;His Kind of Woman&quot; (1952) after he was dissatisfied with the original cut delivered by director John Farrow. Hughes was pleased with the results and agreed to loan Fleischer to Stanley Kramer to make &quot;The Happy Time&quot; (1952).

===Kramer Company===
Fleischer was put under contract to the Kramer Company. &quot;The Happy Time&quot; was successful, and Fleischer was meant to follow it with another for Kramer and Foreman, &quot;Full of Life&quot;. However the film was never made because the partnership between Foreman and Kramer ended.

He accepted an offer from MGM to make &quot;Arena&quot;, a rodeo-themed story starring Gig Young and Jean Hagen.

===Director of &quot;A&quot; films===
Fleischer was chosen by Walt Disney – his father&#x27;s former rival as a cartoon producer – to direct &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954) starring Kirk Douglas. While in the film&#x27;s post-production phase, Fleischer received an offer from Dore Schary at MGM to direct &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot;, but had to turn it down because of the work still required on &quot;Leagues&quot;.

He directed &quot;Violent Saturday&quot; (1955), a thriller for Buddy Adler at 20th Century Fox. It was successful, and Fox signed Fleischer to a long-term contract. He worked for this studio for the next 15 years.

===20th Century Fox===
Fleischer&#x27;s first film under his new contract with Fox was &quot;The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing&quot; (1955). He then made &quot;Bandido&quot;, a Western with Robert Mitchum.

Kirk Douglas hired Fleischer to make &quot;The Vikings&quot; (1958), which was produced independently by Douglas through his company Brynaprod (and distributed through United Artists) and was another big hit. Back at Fox, Fleischer made &quot;Compulsion&quot; (1959), a crime drama with Orson Welles for producer Richard D. Zanuck. It was successful and earned Fleischer a Directors Guild Award nomination.

===Europe===
Fox offered him &quot;North to Alaska&quot; (1960) with John Wayne, which Fleischer originally agreed to do, but withdrew when he was unhappy with the script. He moved to Paris where Darryl F. Zanuck asked him to make &quot;The Ballad of Red Rocks&quot;, a vehicle for Zanuck&#x27;s then-girlfriend Juliette Gréco. The film was not made, but Fleischer directed two other stories for Zanuck starring Gréco: &quot;Crack in the Mirror&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Big Gamble&quot; (1961).

Fleischer then signed a contract with Dino De Laurentiis to make &quot;Barabbas&quot; (1961). After this, he and De Laurentiis announced a series of projects, including &quot;Lanny Budd&quot; (from a novel by Upton Sinclair), &quot;Don Camillo&quot;, &quot;Salvatore Guliano&quot;, &quot;Dark Angel&quot; and &quot;Sacco and Vanzetti&quot; (from a script by Edward Anhalt), but none were made. He accepted an offer from Samuel Bronston and Philip Yordan to make &quot;The Nightrunners of Bengal&quot; in Spain, but this project fell apart when Bronston&#x27;s empire collapsed.

===Return to Hollywood===
Back in Hollywood, Richard Zanuck had become head of production at Fox and offered Fleischer &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1966). It was a success and revived his Hollywood career.

He was entrusted with Fox&#x27;s big &quot;roadshow&quot; musical of 1967, &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1967), with Rex Harrison. It failed to break even. Most acclaimed was &quot;The Boston Strangler&quot; (1968), with Tony Curtis.

&quot;Che!&quot; (1969), a biopic of Che Guevara that starred Omar Sharif, was an expensive flop, as was &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970), an account of the World War II Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was his last film for 20th Century Fox.

===1970s===
Fleischer traveled to England, where he directed the well received true-crime dramatization, &quot;10 Rillington Place&quot; (1971) starring Richard Attenborough and John Hurt. He then replaced John Huston, who had fallen out with star George C. Scott, on &quot;The Last Run&quot; (1971). The thriller &quot;See No Evil&quot; (1971) with Mia Farrow followed. Returning to Hollywood, he made &quot;The New Centurions&quot; (1972) from the novel by Joseph Wambaugh, again starring George C. Scott. 

At MGM, he made the science-fiction movie &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973), with Charlton Heston. Three action films followed: &quot;The Don Is Dead&quot; (1973), with Anthony Quinn, plus two for Walter Mirisch: &quot;The Spikes Gang&quot; (1974), with Lee Marvin, and &quot;Mr. Majestyk&quot; (1974), with Charles Bronson, written by Elmore Leonard.

Fleischer was reunited with De Laurentiis for the successful though controversial &quot;Mandingo&quot; (1975). &quot;The Incredible Sarah&quot; (1976), a British biopic of Sarah Bernhardt with Glenda Jackson, came next.

Fleischer earned a reputation as a reliable journeyman and &quot;replacement director&quot;, filling in when a project&#x27;s original director was fired by a producer for creative differences. These included Huston in &quot;The Last Run&quot; and Michael Campus for &quot;Mandingo&quot;.

&quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1977) was a version of the Mark Twain novel that featured Heston, Harrison and Scott in its cast. Fleischer was hired to replace Richard Sarafian on &quot;Ashanti&quot; (1979), starring Michael Caine, which turned out to be a flop. He received another call to replace a director, in this case Sidney J. Furie, on &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1980), an unsuccessful attempt to make a film star out of Neil Diamond.

===Later career===
&quot;Tough Enough&quot; (1983) was about the Toughman Contest starring Dennis Quaid. He made three more for De Laurentiis: &quot;Amityville 3-D&quot; (1983), &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; (1984) and &quot;Red Sonja&quot; (1985). The latter two were adaptations of Robert E. Howard&#x27;s Hyborian Age stories, both starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.

His final theatrical feature was &quot;Million Dollar Mystery&quot; (1987).

===Fleischer Studios===
Fleischer was chairman of Fleischer Studios, which today handles the licensing of Betty Boop and Koko the Clown. In June 2005, he released his memoirs of his father&#x27;s career in &quot;Out of the Inkwell: Max Fleischer and the Animation Revolution&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Fleischer&#x27;s 1993 autobiography &quot;Just Tell Me When to Cry&quot;, described his many difficulties with actors, writers and producers. He died in 2006 at the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital in his sleep of a respiratory infection at the age of 89.

Japanese film director Kiyoshi Kurosawa expresses admiration for Fleischer.

<doc id="1340080" wikidata="Q3483336" url="?curid=1340080" title="Sidney Ponson">
<text>Sidney Alton Ponson (; born November 2, 1976) is an Aruban former Major League Baseball pitcher. As a player, Ponson stood at tall and weighed . He threw right-handed with a fastball that clocked out at 95 mph. When he made his major league debut for the Orioles in , he became the third player from Aruba to play in the major leagues. After the season, he was decorated as a Knight in the Order of Orange-Nassau, along with fellow former Baltimore Orioles players Eugene Kingsale and Calvin Maduro.

==Baltimore Orioles==
Ponson played most of his career with the Baltimore Orioles. His best season came in when he went 14–6 with a 3.77 ERA. Because Baltimore was not in contention for a playoff spot and Ponson was in the last year of his contract, the Orioles traded Ponson that season to the San Francisco Giants at the trading deadline for three players: Kurt Ainsworth, Damian Moss, and prospect Ryan Hannaman. That offseason, Ponson returned to the Orioles on a three-year, $22.5 million deal.

In , Ponson was the opening day starter for Baltimore. He allowed one run on seven hits in 5.2 innings pitched while striking out three and walking three in the Orioles&#x27; 7–2 win over the Boston Red Sox. However, he started off disastrously; his record was 3–12 by the All-Star Break. He rebounded for a strong second half, going 8–3 to finish with an 11–15 record and a 5.30 ERA.

===Brushes with the law===
On December 25, 2004, Ponson was arrested in Aruba and charged with assaulting an Aruban judge following an incident about a complaint of Ponson&#x27;s handling of his powerboat. He spent 11 days in jail, but the charges were dropped after he reached a settlement that included restitution, community service and contributions to local charities on the island.

Less than a month later, in January 2005, he was charged with driving under the influence in Broward County, Florida. Because of these activities, it was thought that he would not be able to enter Canada to pitch in a series against the Toronto Blue Jays in May . However, a visa was later granted, and he was able to make his scheduled start.

Early in the morning of August 25, 2005, Ponson was arrested again for driving under the influence and driving while impaired on southbound Interstate 95 near downtown Baltimore. He was stopped for following too closely and was subsequently arrested by Maryland Transportation Authority Police for the traffic violation and DWI; he was later released.

===Released by the Orioles===
Just before the second drunk driving incident, Baltimore attempted to trade Ponson to the San Diego Padres for first baseman Phil Nevin at the 2005 trade deadline, but the deal fell through when Nevin invoked his no-trade clause. Nevin eventually was traded to Texas. On September 1, 2005, the Orioles released Ponson and voided his contract, saying that his infractions with the law went against a morals clause in Major League Baseball contracts. A week later, on September 8, the Major League Baseball Players Association filed a grievance on Ponson&#x27;s behalf. The Orioles settled the grievance in 2009, with the Orioles reportedly agreeing to pay the remaining $10.1 million.

==St. Louis Cardinals==
On December 21, 2005, Ponson signed a one-year contract with the St. Louis Cardinals calling for a $1 million salary with the ability to earn an additional $1.5 million in incentives. Although his season started promisingly, Ponson struggled with stamina and rarely went more than five innings in his starts. On July 7, , the Cardinals designated Ponson for assignment, ending his stint with the team.

==New York Yankees==
On July 14, 2006, Ponson signed with the New York Yankees. The Yankees won his first game, lost the second game, and he was subsequently sent to the bullpen when the Yankees acquired Cory Lidle from the Philadelphia Phillies. Reportedly, Brian Cashman asked Ponson if he would be amenable to being placed in the pen before going ahead with the trade (which also involved acquiring Bobby Abreu). If Ponson had refused, he would have been released and the trade that sent Shawn Chacón to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Craig Wilson would have fallen through. After a poor pitching performance on August 18, 2006, the Yankees released Ponson, making him a free agent.

==Minnesota Twins==
In January , Ponson signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins. On March 31, 2007, his contract was purchased by the Twins and he was added to their 25-man roster as the fifth starter. He got off to a relatively slow start, having only a couple of quality starts while his ERA hovered around 7. On May 13, the Twins designated him for assignment, and he was later released.

==Texas Rangers==
On March 9, , Ponson signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Texas Rangers. Ponson began the 2008 season with the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks. On April 26, the Rangers purchased his contract, and he became the team&#x27;s third starter.

Ponson compiled a fairly solid 4–1 record and 3.88 ERA for the season, and was one of the few bright spots on a dreadful rotation. However, he ran into trouble off the field. He was seen late at night in the hotel bar in St. Petersburg, Florida while the Rangers were visiting Tampa Bay. The next day, the Rays lit him up for 12 hits in five innings. Rangers officials told Ponson that any further incident would result in him being dropped from the team.

He was pulled four innings into a June 4 game against Cleveland, and reacted angrily, especially since three errors led to four runs. The next day, he blew up at manager Ron Washington after being told he&#x27;d be pushed back from his next start to keep Kevin Millwood on his regular schedule.

On June 6, Texas abruptly designated Ponson for assignment for what general manager Jon Daniels called &quot;disrespectful and adverse reactions to situations unbecoming of a teammate.&quot; Daniels added, &quot;We don&#x27;t feel Sidney deserves to be here or wants to be here. We&#x27;re not going to get into details other than to say we&#x27;re clearly trying to put together a team here, in a true sense of the word. Based on some recent comments and other such things, it was pretty clear that he did not want to be part of that, and it&#x27;s something we&#x27;re not going to tolerate.&quot;

==Return to the Yankees==
On June 9, 2008, Ponson signed a minor league deal returning to the Yankees for a second time. He made his first start on June 27, 2008 in a Subway Series against the Mets. Ponson pitched six shutout innings in his first start back with the Yankees, which they eventually won 9–0. His record with the Yankees in 2008 was 4–4 with a 5.85 ERA. For the season, he had the highest run support of all pitchers, with an average of 6.5 runs per game started.

==World Baseball Classic==
Ponson pitched for the Netherlands in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Ponson would finish with an ERA of 4.00 in nine innings pitched over two appearances, earning the win for the Dutch in their shocking opening win over the heavily favored Dominican Republic. He was, however, the losing pitcher in the Dutch&#x27;s second-round defeat to Venezuela. On June 26, 2009, it was announced that he violated the IBAF/World Anti-Doping Agency doping regulation during the 2009 World Baseball Classic by taking phentermine, and was banned from international baseball tournament for two years. He was allowed to play professionally in the US, however, since the American association does not validate the European laboratory results.

==Kansas City Royals==
On March 17, 2009, two days after Netherlands&#x27; elimination from the World Baseball Classic, Ponson signed a minor league deal to play for the Kansas City Royals and was invited to spring training. On April 1, 2009, it was announced that Ponson would start Kansas City&#x27;s home opener on April 10, against the New York Yankees. He pitched six innings, and gave up four earned runs for the loss. He made his second start for the Royals on April 15, in which he allowed only two runs in six innings. Ponson got a no decision in the 5–4 loss to the Cleveland Indians. After a record of 1–7 with an ERA of 7.36, he was designated for assignment by the Royals on August 2, and released August 12.

==Long Island Ducks==
On April 12, 2010, Ponson signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent following the season. He made 11 starts throwing 67 innings going 4-5 with a 5.64 ERA and 29 strikeouts.

<doc id="1340086" wikidata="Q2844526" url="?curid=1340086" title="Amshuverma">
<text>Amshuverma or Amshu Verma () was a king of Nepal from around 605–621 CE. Initially a feudal lord, he rose to the position of &quot;Mahasamanta&quot; (equivalent to prime minister) in about 598 CE when Shivadeva I of the Licchavi dynasty was the ruling monarch and by 604, Shivadeva was reduced to a mere figurehead. He is considered to have died in 621 AD and was succeeded by Udaydeva, the son of Shivadeva I.

==Life==

Amshuverma took the title of Pashupati Bhattarak being in Shaivite majority period. The meaning of Sanskrit word &quot;Bhattaraka&quot; is leaders of religious orders in Shaivism. He is believed to have been a son of a brother of the queen of Sivadeva. He was learned, bold and farsighted ruler of Lichhavi period, he was also a lover of art, architecture and literature. He built Kailashkut Bhawan palace, which became famous as a state of the art palace south of the Himalayas in the seventh century.

The Chinese ambassador Wang Huen Che who was appointed about 640 AD makes a graphic description of its grandeur in Tang Annals of China. The appointment of the Chinese ambassador to the court of Nepal in seventh century shows that a very close relationship pertained between Nepal and China already.

Many Tibetan accounts make Bhrikuti the daughter of Amshuverma. If this is correct, the marriage to Songtsän Gampo must have taken place sometime before 624 CE. Acharya Kirti Tulku Lobsang Tenzin, however, states that Songstän Gampo married Bhrkuti Devi, the daughter of king &quot;Angsu Varma&quot; or Amshuvarma (Tib: &quot;Waser Gocha&quot;) of Nepal in 632.

According to some Tibetan legends, however, a Nepali king named Go Cha (identified by Sylvain Lévi as &quot;Udayavarman&quot;, from the literal meaning of the Tibetan name) was said to have a daughter called Bri-btumn or Bhṛkuti. &quot;Udayavarman&quot; was most likely the same king we know as Udaydeva, the son of Shivadeva I and later, the adopted son and heir to Aṃshuvarmā. He was also thought to be the father of Narendradeva (Tib: &quot;Miwang-Lha&quot;). If this is accepted, it means that Narendradeva and Bhrikuti Devi were brother and sister.

It is believed that Udayadev was exiled to Tibet and his daughter, Bhrikuti, was married to the Tibet Emperor Tsrong-tsang Gompo. This event appears to have opened trade routes between Nepal and Tibet. Some early historians in Nepal had mistakenly concluded that the pictographic symbol used to name the father of Bhrikuti in Tang Annals stood for Amshu (which means the rays of the rising sun in Sanskrit, the language used in Nepal then), where as Udaya (the rise of the sun) would also be written with the same symbols. Bhrikuti could not have been Amshuverma&#x27;s daughter simply because she would be too old to marry the Tibet Emperor. Bhrikuti was daughter of Udayadev and she had dispatched the Tibetan army to Nepal valley to reinstate Narendradev, her brother, as king in Nepal about 640 AD. Bhrikuti was instrumental in spreading Buddhism to Tibet and she later attained the status of Tara, the shakti in Mahayana Buddhism.

The Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang, who visited India during the 7th century, described Aṃshuvarmā as a man of many talents. The original temple of Jokhang in Lhasa was modeled after a Nepali monastery design - a square quadrangle with the kwa-pa-dyo shrine at the center of the east wing, opposite to the entrance. The innermost shrine room of the world heritage Jokhang temple still displays the woodwork of Nepali origin and craftsmanship. Since then, and specially after the contributions of Araniko, a Nepali bronze caster and architect who was sent to Tibet to cast a stupa in 1265 AD, Nepali art and architecture spread over the countries like China and Japan. An inscription by Aṃshuvarmā dated to 607 AD at Tistung professes the importance of the &quot;Aryan code of conduct&quot; (i.e. the caste system).

A great feat of architecture and engineering, the Kailashkut Bhawan, is believed to have been located about Hadigaun in Kathmandu. It had three courtyards and seven storied tiered structure with grand water works and inlay stone decorations. Amshuverma also introduced the second Licchavi era (samvat). Economically, Nepal was much developed during his time. His ruling period is known as the &#x27;Golden Period&#x27; in the history of Nepal.

Amshuverma&#x27;s sister, Bhoga Devi, was married to an Indian king, Sur Sen; this marriage helped Amshuvera strengthen Nepal&#x27;s relationship with India. He maintained the independence and sovereignty of Nepal by his successful foreign policy.

His Sanskrit grammar, entitled &quot;Shabda Vidya&quot;, made him popular even outside the nation. The famous Chinese traveller Huen Tsang praised him in his travel account.

Amshuverma&#x27;s regime became a boon to the Licchavi Period so that it came to be called a golden age. He has become immortal in the history of Nepal.

Most of the inscriptions of king Shivadeva I, there is the name of Amshuverma as Srimahasamanta. In the later period of king Shivadeva I, Amshuverma coupe and declared himself sovereign ruler. King Shivadev fled from the palace with his family to neighboring country Tibet because they were all Buddhist kings and very close in trade relation. While in Tibet, for several years, Shivadeva I&#x27;s daughter Virkuti was married to a Tibetain prince. King Shong Chog Gombus&#x27; second wife was the daughter of Tang king Taizong. During this time, Amshuverma changed three different positions: Shri- mahsamanta from a seven storied building Kailashkut royal palace at Hadigaon, Shree Amshuverma issued the crescent symbolic coins minted in his name, Sri-maharajadhiraja from the last time of his rule. In one inscription issued by his queen, Amshuverma is addressed as Sri-kalhabhimani (lover of goddess of knowledge, music, art, speech, wisdom, and learning). The work Shabdavidya (grammar) is the literary creation of Amshuverma in his 26 years of ruling period. He adored his clan as Bappa-pada-nudhyat (blessed by predecessors).

Sources of the family of Amshuverma are silent and there was marital relation between the Deva and Verma clans. Amshuverma was the man of diplomatic experiments and a successful political benefiter to exploit the situation to grab state power at any means. He welcomed scholars in his state and was in favor of local self-government for welfare of the people. Nepal had trade relations with Tibet and the items exchanged were iron, yak tail, wool, musk deer pod, copper utensils, and herbs. In 618AD there was economic relation with Tibet and Tibet started to encroach towards Nepal when it absorbed more power which is noticed by the Gopalaraj Vamsavali. In the south, Nepal had trade as well as diplomatic relations with Bidharvaraj Harshaverdhan, was a powerful king of Kanauj. Prince Surasen of Kanauj, (Maukhari clan) was the sister in-law of Amshuverma. When Harshaverdhana captured and annexed Kanauj, Surasena came to Nepal and bikramsen was Sarvadandanayak of Amshuverma&#x27;s court.

Amshuverma was succeeded by Udayadeva, the son of king Shivadeva I. Udayadeva was later dethroned by his younger brother, Dhrubadeva with the help of Jishnu Gupta.

== Personality ==

Amshuverma had been acknowledged as a person of talents devoted to the study of the Sastras. According to one inscription where he is addressed as अनिशिनिशिचानेकशास्त्रार्थविमर्शव दिता सद्दर्शन तया धर्माधिकार स्थितिकावोत्सव मनतिश्यम् मन्यमानो and अनन्य नरपति सुकरा पुगयाधिकार स्थिति निबन्धनो नीयमान समाधानो which describe Amshuverma as a person who had purified his mind by incessant pursuit of learning and debates day and night, which had enabled him to frame rules to uphold justice and virtue in the society, a fact he valued most and whose mind was at rest because he had been able to evolve rules of conduct, and maintain justice.

In his reign, a certain Bibhubarma Rajbansi, or descendant of a Rajah, having consecrated a Buddha, built an aqueduct with seven &quot;spours,&quot; and wrote the following on the right hand side of one of them, &quot; By the kindness of Amshuverma, this aqueduct has been built by Bibhubarma, to augment the merit of his father.&quot;

==Pilgrimage==
It is usually believed that, Amshuverma was endowed with all the kingly qualities and virtues. He was a just, impartial and an able administrator. He was a true servant of the people without any political bias.

According to some inscriptions, King Shiva Deva used to say that Amshuverma was a man of universal fame and he always destroyed his enemies by his heroic nature. Some other inscriptions tell us that he had a great personality, who dispelled darkness by the light of his glory. Huen Tsang, himself a learned man and respected scholar, writes about him as a man of high accomplishments and great glory.

Amshuverma had written a book on grammar in Sanskrit. The great grammarian Chandraverma, a scholar of Nalanda University, was patronized by him. He followed Shaivism but was tolerant towards all other religions. He can rightly be compared with other great rulers of his time as regards his political outlook and impartial feelings without any religious prejudices. For the development of economic condition of the people he paid great attention to the improvement of trade and commerce of the country. Nepal had trade relations with India, Tibet and China and became the thoroughfare of India&#x27;s trade with China and vice versa.

Amshuverma gave equal importance to industrial advancement and agricultural prosperity. He made every effort to help the people by providing canals to irrigate the fields. He levied a water tax, a land tax, a defense tax and a luxury tax, using the income from these sources for the development works of the country and not for his personal pleasure and luxury.

== Death ==
Amshuverma is considered to have died in 621 CE and was succeeded by Udaydeva.

<doc id="1340095" wikidata="Q783287" url="?curid=1340095" title="Prosopography">
<text>Prosopography is an investigation of the common characteristics of a group of people, whose individual biographies may be largely untraceable. Research subjects are analysed by means of a collective study of their lives, in multiple career-line analysis. The discipline is considered to be one of the auxiliary sciences of history.

==History==
British historian Lawrence Stone (1919–1999) brought the term to general attention in an explanatory article in 1971, although it had been used as early as 1897 with the publication of the &quot;Prosopographia Imperii Romani&quot; by German scholars. The word is drawn from the figure of prosopopeia in classical rhetoric, introduced by Quintilian, in which an absent or imagined person is figured forth—the &quot;face created&quot; as the Greek suggests—in words, as if present.

Stone noted two uses of prosopography as an historian&#x27;s tool, in uncovering deeper interests and connections beneath the superficial rhetoric of politics, to examine the structure of the political machine and in analysing the changing roles in society of status groups—holders of offices, members of associations—and assessing social mobility through family origins and social connections of recruits to those offices or memberships. &quot;Invented as a tool of political history&quot;, Stone observed, &quot;it is now being increasingly employed by the social historians&quot;.

==Overview==
Prosopographical research has the goal of learning about patterns of relationships and activities through the study of collective biography; it collects and analyses statistically relevant quantities of biographical data about a well-defined group of individuals. The technique is used for studying many pre-modern societies.

The nature of prosopographical research has evolved. In his 1971 essay, Lawrence Stone discussed an &quot;older&quot; form of prosopography which was principally concerned with well-known social elites, many of whom were already historical figures. Their genealogies were well researched and social webs and kinship linking could be traced, allowing a prosopography of a &quot;power elite&quot; to emerge. Prominent examples which Stone drew upon were the work of Charles A. Beard and Sir Lewis Namier.

Beard&#x27;s &quot;An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States&quot; (1913) offered an explanation of the form and content of the U.S. Constitution by looking at the class background and economic interests of the Founding Fathers. Namier produced an equally influential study of the 18th-century House of Commons of Great Britain, &quot;The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III&quot;, and inspired a circle of historians whom Stone light-heartedly termed &quot;Namier Inc&quot;. Stone contrasted this older prosopography with what in 1971 was the newer form of quantitative prosopography, which was concerned with much wider populations, particularly &quot;ordinary people&quot;. An early example of this kind of work is Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s pioneering microhistory &quot;Montaillou&quot; (1975), which developed a picture of patterns of kinship and heresy as well as daily and seasonal routine in a small Occitan village, the last pocket of Cathars, from 1294 to 1324.

Stone anticipated that this new form of prosopography would become dominant as part of a growing wave of social science history. Prosopography and other associated forms of social science and quantitative history went into a period of decline during the 1980s. In the 1990s, perhaps because of developments in computing and particularly in database software, prosopography was revived. The &quot;new prosopography&quot; has since become clearly established as an important approach in historical research.

==Data in prosopographical research==
A certain mass of data is required for prosopographical research. The collection of data underlies the creation of a prosopography and, in contemporary research, this is usually in the form of an electronic database. But data assembly is not the goal of the research; rather, the objective is to understand patterns and relationships by analysing the data. A uniform set of criteria needs to be applied to the group in order to achieve meaningful results. And, as with any historical study, understanding the context of the lives studied is essential.

In the words of prosopographer Katharine Keats-Rohan, &quot;prosopography is about what the analysis of the sum of data about many individuals can tell us about the different types of connection between them, and hence about how they operated within and upon the institutions—social, political, legal, economic, intellectual—of their time&quot;.

In this sense prosopography is clearly related to, but distinct from, both biography and genealogy. Whilst biography and prosopography overlap, and prosopography is interested in the details of individuals&#x27; lives, a prosopography is more than the plural of biography. A prosopography is not just any collection of biographies. The lives of the research subjects must have enough in common for relationships and connections to be uncovered. Genealogy, as practiced by family historians, has as its goal the reconstruction of familial relationships, and as such, well-conducted genealogical research may form the basis of a prosopography.

<text>Balbhadra Kunwar Chhetri (30 January 1789 – 13 March 1823) was a Gorkhali military General, Commander and administrator in the Sikh Empire and the Kingdom of Nepal. He is one of the National heroes of Nepal. He was highly praised for his military skill for the defence of Nalapani fort in the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–1816). He was a captain in the Nepalese military and was tasked as commander to protect the forts of Dehradun.

==Name==
His given name &quot;Balabhadra&quot; is the name of &quot;Baladeva&quot; (&quot;Balarama&quot;), the elder brother of &quot;Krishna&quot;. It is an amalgamation of two words; &quot;Bala&quot; () and &quot;Bhadra&quot; ()

==Family and early life ==

He was born to father Chandrabir Kunwar, a resident of Bhanwarkot of Panchkhal Municipality in Kavrepalanchowk District. His mother Ambika Devi was a sister of Kaji Ranajor Thapa and daughter of &quot;Bada Kaji&quot; Amar Singh Thapa. His father Chandrabir was son of Jaya Krishna Kunwar and grandson of Ashiram Kunwar. His brother Birabhadra Kunwar was military commander in Kumaun and Kangra front (1809 A.D.) as well as governor of Garhwal.

== The Anglo-Nepal War 1814–1816 ==
As commander of the Gorkhali forces in Dheradun, Capt. Balbhadra Kunwar was handed the responsibility of defending the area. The expanding Nepali/Gorkhali State had since the mid-late 18th century expanded the nation&#x27;s border on all sides, which eventually led to conflict with the British East India Company and a war followed.

Realizing he could not defend the town of Dehradun, Capt. Balbhadra Kunwar withdrew to the strategic hill fort of Khalanga with an army strength of 600 including women and children against the British East India Company British stronghold of 3,000–3,500 troops. He turned down a proposal of the British who would make him Governor of the Western Garhwal should he surrender or leave Nepal.

In October 1814, Major General Sir Rollo Gillespie of the British army had advanced along with 3,500 troops and eleven pieces of cannon to occupy the Nepali territories situated between the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in the Gharwal and Kumaon regions that had been occupied by the Nepali forces. Captain Balabhadra Kunwar had maintained his position at a 400 cubits high hill in a place called Nalapani, situated north-east of Dehradun, to check his advance.

On Kartik 8, 1871, Bikram Samvat (October 1814), British troops reached Dheradun. A battle took place between British and Nepali troops at Nalapani on Kartik 10, 1871 B. Samvat. The British were unsuccessful and withdrew to Dehradun. Another battle was fought between the two sides at Nalapani on Kartik 17, 1871 Samvat (ca. Oct 31, 1814). General Gillespie, the British Commander, lost his life in that battle along with Col. Alice.

The siege continued for a month until the British, convinced that they could not win by military ways, blocked the source of water to the fort so that the Nepalese would die of thirst. For the Nepali Army it was a hard struggle fighting a very well equipped and trained modern army, belonging to one of the largest colonial Empires of the world. Balbhadra Kunwar had asked for reinforcements from the capital but Kathmandu could not send them any soldiers as the Nepali army had no reserve army and were an emerging power which means that they did not have troops to match the East India Company. The Nepalese army was outnumbered in Nalapani as it was in every battlefield.

Even though the Nepali army lacked water they were still determined to defend their position. Because the walls had collapsed, cannonballs fired by the British started reaching the interior of the fort. Many men were killed or injured. Despite losing their comrades and friends the remaining men were still determined to defend their position. In order to drink water from the river they came out of the fort in a single line, and the British forces watched in surprise as the Nepali troops quenched their thirst and returned to their fort.

On Marga 16 (Nov 1814), four of the commanders, including Capt. Balabhadra Kunwar, in the night was forced to abandon the fort of Nalapani with their remaining Gorkhali troops. On seeing the Nepalis abandon the fort, the British attacked them. The Nepalis resisted the attack but continued to advance. They reached Dwara in the morning of Marga 17, 1871 and stayed the whole day there.

Balabhadra sent a courier to the British with the following message: &quot;We had handed over to you your dead and injured soldiers on your request. We now request you to hand over our injured soldiers to us.&quot; The British replied that they would look after the injured (Nepali) soldiers themselves. Accordingly, they treated the 180 injured soldiers at the Nalapani fort.

The next day, Marga 18, 1871 Samvat, the Nepalis left Dwara for the Gopichand Hill, where they had decided to build a fort. Dwara was not considered suitable for that purpose.

The Nepalis spent the night at the Gopichand hill. At midnight, the British forces started shelling their camp. The Nepalis retaliated. Meanwhile, Sardar Ripumardan Thapa sustained an injury in his right arm from an enemy shell. He was unable to walk, and so was helped by his jamadar to climb the hill. However, he could not go on and was forced to stop. The other Nepalis continued to ascend the hill.

The next day, Marga 19, 1871 B. Samvat, men sent by Balabhadra carried Ripumardana to Chamuwa. Kaji Ranadipa Simha Basnyat also had arrived at that place. On Marga 20, Kaji Rewanta Kunwar reached there Subedar Dalajit Kanwar were killed by enemy fire.

Ultimately after 4 days of thirst, and a severe loss of troops, without surrendering, Capt. Balbhadra emerged from the fort with drawn kukris in his hands (along with other 70 survivors) and roared to the British – &quot;You could have never won the battle but now I myself voluntarily abandon this fort. There is nothing inside the fort other than dead corpses of the children and women&quot;! He and his remaining troops escaped into the hills on November 30, 1814.

A peace treaty was signed on Dec 2, 1815 between the then King Girvan Yuddha Vikram Shah and the British East India Company, known as the Sugauli Treaty.

==Under Maharaja Ranjit Singh==

He did not lose his life during the Anglo-Nepalese war. After the war, he went to Lahore, capital of the Punjab where many Nepalis had gone, to join the two new regiments formed by the Sikh Maharajah Ranjit Singh of the Punjab, following the war with the British but a tradition formed prior to the war. Capt. Balbhadra Kunwar was appointed General and commander of the new &quot;Goorkha&quot; regiments consisting entirely of Gorkhali/Nepali troops. Those that had taken service under the Mughal Emperors were known as &quot;Munglane&quot; and was seen as very powerful.

=== Under Hari Singh Nalwa and death ===

During the Sikh-Afghan war of 1879 B. Samvat (1822), the Nepalis in the Sikh Military had fought bravely, but was also in which Balabhadra Kunwar was killed by Afghan artillery in Naushera, Peshawar region, Afghanistan on Chaitra 3 (March/April in the Roman calendar and is the last month in the Hindu Lunar calendar). Bhimsen Thapa had sent men to Lahore to collect information about this war and the death of his nephew. He was under the great and famed General Hari Singh Nalwa who honoured him during the battle. Hari Singh Nalwa continued the campaign and reached as far as Jamrud.

Following the Anglo-Nepali War, the British East India Company erected a war memorial at Nalapani in honor of the Gorkhalis and Capt. Balbhadra Kunwar (often referred to wrongly as Bulbuder Singh or Balbudder Thapa) praising their bravery.

<doc id="1340112" wikidata="Q1850372" url="?curid=1340112" title="Alpine Fault">
<text>The Alpine Fault is a geological fault that runs almost the entire length of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, being about . long, and forms the boundary between the Pacific plate and the Australian plate. The Southern Alps have been uplifted on the fault over the last 12 million years in a series of earthquakes. However, most of the motion on the fault is strike-slip (side to side), with the Tasman district and West Coast moving north and Canterbury and Otago moving south. The average slip rates in the fault&#x27;s central region are about a year, very fast by global standards. The last major earthquake on the Alpine Fault was in about 1717 AD with a &quot;great&quot; earthquake magnitude of ± 0.1. The probability of another one occurring before 2068 was estimated at 75 percent in 2021.

== Geographic extent and plate motion ==
The Pacific plate and Indo-Australian plate boundary forms the Macquarie Fault Zone in the Puysegur Trench off the southwestern corner of the South Island and comes onshore as the Alpine Fault just north of Milford Sound. The Alpine Fault then runs the length of the South Island just west of the Southern Alps to near Lewis Pass in the central northern section of the island. At this point, it splits into a set of smaller faults known as the Marlborough fault system. This set of faults, which includes the Wairau Fault, the Hope Fault, the Awatere Fault, and the Clarence Fault, transfer displacement between the Alpine Fault and the Hikurangi subduction zone to the north. The Hope Fault is thought to represent the primary continuation of the Alpine Fault.

== Tectonics ==
The Australian plate, which is in the process of again separating from the Indo-Australian plate, is subducting towards the east south of the South Island and the Pacific plate is subducting towards the west to the north. In the middle, the Alpine Fault is a transform boundary and has both dextral (right-lateral) strike-slip movement and uplift on the southeastern side. The uplift is due to an element of convergence between the plates, meaning that the fault has a significant high-angle reverse oblique component to its displacement.

In the northern section of the fault the transition to the Marlborough Fault System reflects transfer displacement between the mainly transform plate boundary of the Alpine fault and the mainly destructive boundary further northwards from the Hikurangi Subduction Zone to the Kermadec Trench. This has resulted in a complex splaying of faults, which is associated with large earthquakes adjacent to, but off the Alpine fault itself, such the 1929 Murchison earthquake, 1968 Inangahua earthquake and 1929 Arthur&#x27;s Pass earthquake.

The Alpine Fault has the greatest uplift of the Pacific plate near Aoraki / Mount Cook in its central section. Here the relative motion between the two plates averages 37–40 mm a year. This is distributed as 36–39 mm of horizontal and 6–10 mm upwards movement on the fault&#x27;s plane per year. 
At the southern end of the fault there is effectively no uplift component of the Pacific plate and other faults share the strain as a result of the plate collision. These include in Fiordland faults associated with the 2003 Fiordland earthquake and 2009 Dusky Sound earthquake, the Otago fault system, in Canterbury faults such as the Ostler Fault Zone and those associated with the 7.1 MW Darfield earthquake. The uplift in this South Westland region of the fault which has a dextral strike-slip rate of about /year is on the Australian plate side of it with meter scale vertical uplift every 290 years odd.

== Geological origin and evolution ==
Between 25 and 12 million years ago the movement on the proto-Alpine Fault was exclusively strike-slip. The Southern Alps had not yet formed and most of New Zealand was covered in water. Then uplift slowly began as the plate motion became slightly oblique to the strike of the Alpine Fault. In the last 12 million years, the Southern Alps have been uplifted approximately , however, as this has occurred more rain has been trapped by the mountains leading to more erosion. This, along with isostatic constraints, has kept the Southern Alps less than high.

Uplift on the Alpine Fault has led to the exposure of deep metamorphic rocks near the fault within the Southern Alps. This includes mylonites and the Alpine Schist, which increases in metamorphic grade towards the fault. The eroded material has formed the Canterbury Plains. The Alpine Fault is not a single structure but often splits into pure strike-slip and dip-slip components. Near the surface, the fault can have multiple rupture zones.

== Fault zone geology ==
The fault zone is exposed at numerous locations along the West Coast, and typically consists of a 10 to 50 m wide fault gouge zone with pervasive hydrothermal alteration. This last is because water penetrates down to up to through hot rock associated with the fault. The water then can arise in hot springs with temperatures of over in the fault valley, although the temperature of the water at depth is much more extreme. Most of the movement along the fault occurs in this zone. In outcrop, the fault zone is overlain by mylonites which formed at depth and have been uplifted by the fault.

A structural study of a segment of the Alpine Fault to the southwest of Fiordland examined the Dagg Basin, an offshore sedimentary basin at depth. Basin sediments are primarily from Pleistocene glaciation, and structures within them reveal a past complexity that is no longer present in the basin. The current structure is a pull-apart basin along a releasing bend in the Alpine Fault, with a segment of inverted basin along the southern edge due to transpression. The study discussed the short-lived nature of the releasing bend (on the order of 10 to 10 years), during which there were 450 – 1650 m of dextral displacement. The nature of the displacement served as an example of the kinds of ephemeral structures that can develop along a mature strike-slip fault system.

== Earthquakes ==

There have been no major historical earthquakes on the Alpine Fault. Because of this, during the mid-20th century it was speculated that the Alpine Fault creeps without making large earthquakes. However, it is now inferred by multiples lines of evidence that the Alpine Fault ruptures, creating major earthquakes approximately every few hundred years. The last whole fault rupture event was in 1717 and is now known to have been a &quot;great&quot; earthquake of ± 0.1. There is also fair evidence for a post 1717 event confined to North Westland section of the fault but the date is unclear. There are two modes of large earthquake behaviour with either major (MW 7–8) or great (MW &gt; 8) earthquakes and predicting the next mode is a challenge as these appear to evolve over multiple seismic cycles in response to along-strike differences in geometry.

=== Prehistoric ===
Māori arrived in New Zealand about 1300 but never reached a high population density in the colder South Island. Therefore, while earthquakes are an important part of Māori oral tradition, no stories have been passed down about South Island earthquakes. Over the last thousand years, the major ruptures along the Alpine Fault, causing earthquakes of about magnitude 8 had previously been determined to have occurred at least four times. These had separation of between 100 and 350 years. The 1717 quake appeared to have involved a rupture along nearly of the southern two-thirds of the fault. Scientists say that a similar earthquake could happen at any time, as the interval since 1717 is longer than the intervals between the earlier events. Newer research carried out by the University of Otago, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and others has revised the dates and nature of the earthquakes and given greater understanding of their number. Studies at Haast towards the centre of the fault only identified three major rupture events in the last 1000 years. Studies at the far southern end identified seven events in the last 2000 years and the most southern of the fault has had 27 events since 6000 BCE.
This information has been updated with better dating techniques and is summarised in the following timeline for the various sections of the fault.

This work suggests that large fault ruptures occurred in 1717, about 1400, about 1100 and about 390 CE.

=== Prediction of next earthquake ===
In 2012, GNS Science researchers published an 8000-year timeline of 24 major earthquakes on the (southern end of the) fault from sediments at Hokuri Creek, near Lake McKerrow in north Fiordland. In earthquake terms, the up to long fault was remarkably consistent, rupturing on average every 330 years, at intervals ranging from 140 years to 510 years. In 2017, GNS researchers revised the figures after they combined updated Hokuri site records with a thousand-year record from another site, 20 km away at John O&#x27;Groats River, to produce a record of 27 major earthquake events during the 8000-year period. This gave a mean recurrence rate of 291 years, plus or minus 23 years, versus the previously estimated rate of 329 years, plus or minus 26 years. In the new study, the interval between earthquakes ranged from 160 to 350 years, and the probability of an earthquake occurring in the 50 years following 2017 was estimated at 29 percent for this southern sector of the fault alone. A 2021 study estimated the probability of an earthquake occurring before 2068 was 75 percent.

=== Projected effects of a rupture ===
Large ruptures can also trigger earthquakes on the faults continuing north from the Alpine Fault. There is paleotsunami evidence of near-simultaneous ruptures of the Alpine Fault and Wellington (and/or other major) faults to the north having occurred at least twice in the past 1,000 years. A 2018 study says that a significant rupture in the Alpine Fault could lead to roads (particularly in or to the West Coast) being blocked for months, as with the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake, with problems in supplying towns and evacuating tourists. District councils along the West Coast and in Canterbury have commissioned studies and begun preparations for an anticipated large earthquake on the Alpine Fault. 

== History of research ==
In 1940, Harold Wellman found that the Southern Alps were associated with a fault line approximately 650 km (400 miles) long. The fault was officially named the Alpine Fault in 1942 as an extension of a previously mapped structure. At the same time, Harold Wellman proposed the lateral displacement on the Alpine Fault. This displacement was inferred by Wellman due in part to the similarity of rocks in Southland and Nelson on either side of the Alpine Fault. Lateral displacements of this magnitude could not be explained by pre-plate tectonics geology and his ideas were not initially widely accepted until 1956. Wellman also proposed in 1964 that the Alpine Fault was a Cenozoic structure, which was in conflict with the older Mesozoic age accepted at the time. This idea coupled with the displacement on the fault proposed that the earth&#x27;s surface was in relatively rapid constant movement and helped to overthrow the old geosynclinal hypothesis in favour of plate tectonics.

In 1964 a 25-metre-long concrete wall was built across the fault to measure the fault&#x27;s movements and to find if it moves slowly over time or suddenly during big earthquakes. The wall has not moved since being built, which indicates that the build up of energy is released suddenly during large earthquakes.

Richard Norris and Alan Cooper from the Department of Geology, University of Otago conducted extensive research on the structure and petrology of the Alpine Fault respectively throughout the later 20th and early 21st centuries. It was during this time that the cyclicity of the Alpine Fault earthquakes and meaning of the increase in metamorphic grade towards the fault was discovered and refined. Originally this regional increase in grade was inferred to be from frictional heating along the fault not uplift of deeper geological sequences. Richard H. Sibson from the same university also used the Alpine Fault to refine his nomenclature of fault rocks which gained international adherence.

Chorus&#x27;s dark fibre cables that pass through the Alpine Fault, from the north and south of Haast, are used for distributed acoustic sensing, which detects cable movement produced by earthquakes. Measurements are made using 7,250 &#x27;interrogator&#x27; locations, spaced four metres apart, which emit and detect pulses of light, generating about a gigabyte of data per minute.

=== Deep Fault Drilling Project ===

The Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP) was an attempt in 2014 to retrieve rock and fluid samples and make geophysical measurements inside the Alpine Fault zone at depth. It was a $2.5 million international research project designed to drill 1.3 km to the fault plan in two months. The DFDP was the second project to try to drill an active fault zone and return samples after the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth. One of the goals of the project was to use the deformed rocks from the fault zone to determine its resistance to stress. Researchers also planned to install long term equipment for measuring pressure, temperature and seismic activity near the fault zone. It was led by New Zealand geologists Rupert Sutherland, John Townsend and Virginia Toy and involves an international team from New Zealand, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

In 2017, they reported they had discovered beneath Whataroa, a small township on the Alpine Fault, &quot;extreme&quot; hydrothermal activity which &quot;could be commercially very significant&quot;. One of the lead researchers said that it is likely to be globally unique.

<text>Rajshahi (, ) is a metropolitan city and a major urban, administrative, commercial and educational centre of Bangladesh. It is also the administrative seat of the eponymous division and district. Located on the north bank of the Padma River, near the Bangladesh–India border, the city is surrounded by the satellite towns of Nowhata and Katakhali, which together build an urban agglomeration of about 1 million population. Modern Rajshahi lies in the ancient region of Pundravardhana. The foundation of the city dates to 1634, according to epigraphic records at the mausoleum of Sufi saint Shah Makhdum. The area hosted a Dutch settlement in the 18th century. The Rajshahi municipality was constituted during the British Raj in 1876. It was the divisional capital of the greater Rajshahi division which was the largest division in Bengal Province.

Rajshahi is a historic center of silk production. Varendra Research Museum, the oldest of its kind in Bangladesh, is located in the city. Sometimes the city is referred to as the City of Education. The city is home to many renowned educational institutions of Bangladesh. The head office of Rajshahi Agricultural Development Bank and Barind Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA) is situated in the city. The Shah Makhdum Airport serves Rajshahi.

It is the most environmentally friendly city in Bangladesh.

According to The Guardian, Rajshahi is the cleanest city of Bangladesh.

==History==
Rajshahi district was a part of the Pundra region of ancient Bengal ruled by the Pundra Kingdom. The capital of Prince Vijaya, the king who led military operations in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia was located to the west of Rajshahi town. 
Rajshahi was dominated by various Maharajas, Rajas and Zamindars. During &quot;Deo Rajas period, the region was known as Mohakalgarh. In 1288-89 the Raja was defeated by Shah Makhdum Rupos. The region became known as Rampur Boalia after establishing an administrative office in 1825. The origin of the present name of &quot;Rajshahi&quot; is debated among scholars. Most say that it takes its name from Hindu Kings Rajshahi Raj (or &quot;Rajas&quot;) as Raj and the personalised Shahi&quot;&#x27;; both of which mean &quot;&quot; or &quot;kingdom&quot;. The administrative district was established in 1772 and the municipal corporation in 1876.

During the British raj, it was also known as &quot;Beuleah&quot; and was the administrative headquarters of the Rajshahi district in Eastern Bengal and Assam. It was originally chosen as a commercial factory for the silk trade, which was being officially encouraged by the agricultural department of that time. The town contained a government college and an industrial school for sericulture. Most of the public buildings were severely damaged by the earthquake of 12 June 1897. Throughout much of the early part of the twentieth century there was a daily steamer service on the Ganges which connected it to rail-heads that led to the then provincial capital of Calcutta as well as other cities in the province of Bengal.

Rajshahi witnessed great atrocities in the 1962 Rajshahi massacres of Bengali Hindus. During the Bangladesh Liberation War, Pakistan Army created an &quot;ad hoc&quot; Rajshahi brigade, deployed in September.

Rajshahi was made a city corporation in 1991.

<text>Jae Lee (born 1972) is an American comics artist known for his interior illustration and cover work for various publishers, including Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Image Comics, and Dynamite Entertainment.

==Career==
Jae Lee&#x27;s first work for Marvel Comics was a Beast serial in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #85–92 (1991). He first rose to prominence in the industry in 1992 for his work on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Namor the Sub-Mariner&quot;, taking over the art duties from John Byrne, who continued on the series as writer. Terry Kavanagh, Lee&#x27;s editor on both &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; and &quot;Namor&quot;, later said he assigned Lee to &quot;Namor&quot; because he liked his style and felt that, as a new artist, he would benefit from working with an experienced writer. Lee continued when Bob Harras became the writer, drawing issues #26–38 (May 1992–May 1993). As penciller of &quot;X-Factor&quot;, Lee was one of the artists of the &quot;X-Cutioner&#x27;s Song&quot; storyline which ran throughout the X-Men titles in 1992. The following year, Lee drew the three issue &quot;Youngblood Strikefile&quot; for Rob Liefeld&#x27;s Extreme Studios at Image Comics and the three issue &quot;WildC.A.T.s Trilogy&quot; for Jim Lee&#x27;s WildStorm, another founding Image Comics studio. In 1994, Jae Lee produced a creator-owned Image Comics series, &quot;Hellshock&quot;, a story about a fallen angel that he wrote and illustrated.

In 1998, Lee and writer Paul Jenkins crafted an &quot;Inhumans&quot; limited series, for which they won the 1999 Eisner Award for Best New Series. They later reteamed on &quot;The Sentry&quot;. Lee and writer Grant Morrison produced the four-issue miniseries &quot;Fantastic Four: 1234&quot; (Oct. 2001–Feb. 2002), which garnered Lee a nomination for a 2002 Eisner Award as Best Cover Artist. In 2003, Lee, writer John Ney Rieber, and Lee&#x27;s wife, colorist June Chung, produced a &quot;Transformers/G.I. Joe&quot; six-issue miniseries for Dreamwave Productions, which took place in an alternate World War II setting.

Beginning in 2007, Lee worked with artist Richard Isanove and writers Robin Furth and Peter David on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; comic series, based on Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; novels. Lee illustrated the first three miniseries in that series, &quot;The Gunslinger Born&quot;, &quot;The Long Road Home&quot; and &quot;Treachery&quot;. He returned for the fifth book in the series, &quot;Battle of Jericho Hill&quot;. He also provided cover and interior illustrations for the Donald M. Grant edition of King&#x27;s eighth &quot;Dark Tower&quot; novel, &quot;The Wind Through the Keyhole&quot;, which was released February 21, 2012.

At DC Comics, Lee worked on the &quot;Before Watchmen&quot; project, drawing the mini-series &quot;Ozymandias&quot; (Sept. 2012–April 2013) written by Len Wein. He illustrated &quot;Batman/Superman&quot; in 2013–2014 with writer Greg Pak.

In January 2023 it was reported that Lee would be drawing one of the three Rocketeer in IDW Publishing&#x27;s upcoming one-shot anthology, &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;. The project was first conceived by filmmakers Kelvin Mao and Robert Windom, who had discovered during production of their documentary, &quot;Dave Stevens: Drawn to Perfection&quot;, which focused on the creator of the Rocketeer, Dave Stevens, that Danny Bilson and the late Paul De Meo, who wrote the screenplay to the 1991 feature film adaptation &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;, had written an unpublished Rocketeer comics story. After hiring Adam Hughes to illustrate that story, Lee was hired to draw one of the other stories in the book, a four-page story of the Rocketeer fighting a Japanese Zero fighter plane in the South Pacific, written by Windom, who described it as &quot;dreamy contemplation on life and love.&quot;

<text>FIPS 137, originally issued as FED-STD-1015, is a secure telephony speech encoding standard for Linear Predictive Coding vocoder developed by the United States Department of Defense and finished on November 28, 1984.
It was based on the earlier STANAG 4198 promulgated by NATO on February 13, 1984.

FED-STD-1015 was re-designated as Federal Information Processing Standard ([[Federal Information Processing Standards|FIPS]]) Publication 137, (FIPS PUB 137) on October 20, 1988.

It is also known as &quot;LPC-10&quot;.

The codec uses a bit rate of 2.4 kbit/s, requiring 20 MIPS of processing power, 2 kilobytes of RAM and features a frame size of 22.5 ms. Additionally, the codec requires a large lookahead of 90 ms.

In 1998, an improved version of the standard was introduced. With a longer super frame structure and better VQ quantizer, the bit rate is reduced to 800 bit/s.

<text>FS-1016 (also called FED-STD-1016) is a deprecated secure telephony speech encoding standard for Code-excited linear prediction (CELP) developed by the United States Department of Defense and finalized February 14, 1991.

Unlike the vocoder used in FS-1015, CELP provides more natural speech. However, due to quite low bit rate and early development (1991), the speech quality is very noisy and below that of commercial cellular speech codec, such as AMR. FS-1016 is no longer used since its follow-up MELP provides better performance in all applications.

==Technical details==
The bit rate of the codec is 4.8 kbit/s. The complexity of the codec is 19 MIPS. The RAM requirement is 1.5 kilobytes. Frame size of the codec is 30 ms. Look-ahead of 7.5 ms is also required.

The variation of CELP used in the FS-1016 is so-called ternary codebook, meaning that all excitation amplitudes are either +1, −1 or 0. The sub frame gain is calculated and sent to the receiver.
