<text>James Robert McCrimmon, usually simply called Jamie, is a fictional character played by Frazer Hines in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. A piper of the Clan MacLeod who lived in 18th-century Scotland, he was a companion of the Second Doctor and a regular in the programme from 1966 to 1969. The spelling of his surname varies from one script to another; it is alternately rendered as Macrimmon and McCrimmond. Jamie appeared in 20 stories (112 episodes).

==Character history==
The son of Donald McCrimmon — a piper, like his father and his father&#x27;s father — James Robert McCrimmon first appears in &quot;The Highlanders&quot;, encountering the Doctor, Ben and Polly in the aftermath of the Battle of Culloden in 1746. At the end of the story, Polly suggests that the Doctor take Jamie along with them. Jamie continues to travel with the Doctor even after Ben and Polly leave the TARDIS at the end of &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot;. He appears in all but the first Second Doctor serial, &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot;, and in more episodes than any other companion, although Tegan Jovanka served with the Doctor for the longest continuous period in terms of years on the series.

Jamie shares a lively, bantering relationship with the Doctor and, during his time in the TARDIS, sees the arrival and departure of first Victoria Waterfield and finally Zoe Heriot. Jamie, being a product of his time, is always solicitous and gentlemanly towards his female companions. While not having the background to always understand the situations his adventures with the Doctor take him into, Jamie is quick enough to translate high technology and concepts into equivalents he can comprehend and deal with. His relationship with the Doctor is not always smooth, and in &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; he comes close to leaving the Doctor, whom he feels has been manipulating him and Victoria to discover the human factor for the Daleks, without considering the consequences. His battle cry &#x27;, in Scottish Gaelic, translates to &quot;The Boar&#x27;s Rock&quot;. It is similar to &#x27;, the motto of the MacLaren Clan of Scotland. Also during Jamie&#x27;s time with the doctor, he gives him the iconic name John Smith (&quot;The Wheel in Space&quot;). 

Together with the Doctor, Jamie encounters Cybermen, Daleks, the Yeti in the London Underground, the Ice Warriors, and various other dangers. Jamie is particularly fond and protective of Victoria, due in part to her being an elegant Victorian lady. For example, in &quot;The Ice Warriors&quot;, Jamie&#x27;s first priority is to rescue Victoria despite being injured to the point where he can&#x27;t walk. Jamie is heartbroken when Victoria decides to stay with the Harris family at the end of &quot;Fury from the Deep&quot;, to the point of even being briefly angry with the Doctor for allowing her to leave (&quot;The Wheel in Space&quot;). Jamie initially finds Zoe&#x27;s more modern attitudes and bossy nature irritating, but eventually adopts the same protective attitude disguised by the same bantering he engages in with the Doctor. Oftentimes, Jamie&#x27;s simple common sense beats Zoe&#x27;s strict logic, such as in &quot;The Dominators&quot; where Jamie realises that the erupting volcano is going to threaten the TARDIS, while the Doctor and Zoe are still congratulating themselves on defeating their enemies.
During filming of &quot;The Mind Robber&quot;, Frazer Hines contracted chickenpox and was replaced for part of the serial by Hamish Wilson. This was written in as part of the story when Jamie is turned into a cardboard cut-out and has his face removed by the Master of the Land of Fiction. The Doctor&#x27;s first attempt to reconstruct his face is unsuccessful. Eventually, Jamie&#x27;s real face is restored when Hines recovered.

Jamie&#x27;s interdimensionary travels come to an end on the battlefields of &quot;The War Games&quot;, when the Time Lords place the Doctor on trial for interfering with the universe. For his offences, the Doctor is forced to regenerate and exiled to Earth. Jamie and Zoe are returned to their own times, their memories of the Doctor wiped, save for their first encounters. When last seen, Jamie is fighting an English redcoat back on the fields of Scotland.

Hines returned as an illusory image of Jamie in the 20th anniversary special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;. He also reprised the role in the 1985 serial &quot;The Two Doctors&quot; alongside Troughton and Colin Baker as the Second and Sixth Doctors, respectively.

An older Jamie, still portrayed by Hines, returns in the 60th anniversary spin-off Tales of the TARDIS alongside Wendy Padbury as Zoe. Summoned into a Memory Tardis from their respective timelines Jamie and Zoe realise their memories of the Doctor have been restored. Jamie describes his life after returning to 18th century Scotland; he has five daughters and nineteen grandchildren.

==Other mentions==
He is mentioned by the Fifth Doctor in &quot;Castrovalva&quot; when he calls Adric &quot;Jamie&quot;, by the Sixth Doctor in &quot;The Two Doctors&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot;, and by the Seventh Doctor in &quot;The Curse of Fenric&quot;. A vision of Jamie is seen along with every other companion aside from Leela (who was omitted by mistake in post-production) on the scanner screen in &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;.

In &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot;, the Tenth Doctor uses the alias Doctor James McCrimmon together with a Scottish accent (in reality David Tennant&#x27;s own).

Throughout Doctor Who, The Doctor repeatedly uses the alias John Smith, originally given to him by Jamie McCrimmon.

==Other appearances==
Jamie&#x27;s ultimate fate remains unclear within the generally accepted canonicity of the various &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off media.

In the comic strip story &quot;The World Shapers&quot; with the Sixth Doctor, published in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; #127–#129, an elderly Jamie remembers his time with the Doctor, explaining that the Doctor had taught him tricks to ensure the Time Lords would not really wipe his memories. In this story, written by Grant Morrison, Jamie sacrifices himself to stop the titular world shaper machine which was evolving aliens into Cybermen. Jamie&#x27;s death outside the television series was controversial due to his status as a prominent companion, and the fact that story offers an origin story for the cybermen than contradicts almost everything else about them to have been produced.

In the Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;&quot;, writer Paul Cornell omitted Jamie from the group of deceased companions encountered by the Seventh Doctor. In &quot;Planet of the Dead&quot; (&quot;DWM&quot; #141-#142), a race of shapeshifters known as the Ganzalum impersonate the Doctor&#x27;s dead companions, including Jamie.

Big Finish Productions have reunited Jamie with the Sixth Doctor in a series of audio plays starting with &quot;City of Spires&quot;, where he appears to have become a rebel leader known as &#x27;the Black Donald&#x27;. However, in the final story, &quot;Legend of the Cybermen&quot;, it is revealed that this Jamie is simply a fictional construct within the realm seen in &quot;The Mind Robber&quot;, created by an older Zoe, based on her memories of the real Jamie, to protect the Doctor until he could come to her aid, making him older and creating his &#x27;Black Donald&#x27; identity to give him a heroic backstory in the Doctor&#x27;s absence. Jamie and Zoe also meet the Sixth Doctor in the later audio &quot;Last of the Cybermen&quot;, when an unknown enemy causes the Sixth Doctor to swap places with the Second just after the Second Doctor discovered a Cybermen base and a plan to change the history of the Cyber-Wars to avert their final defeat, the Sixth Doctor and Jamie attempting to change history so that Jamie and Zoe can escape the Time Lords and retain their memories before the Sixth Doctor returns to his time and his companions lose all memory of these events. The &quot;Companion Chronicles&quot; audio &quot;The Glorious Revolution&quot; sees a Time Lord agent briefly restore the memory of an older Jamie to help resolve an incident where he nearly changed history while travelling with the Doctor, the Time Lord sending energy to Jamie&#x27;s past self to keep him stabilized until the Doctor can avert the consequences of Jamie&#x27;s actions, but in the end Jamie chooses to have his memory of the Doctor erased once again, reasoning that it would just make him sad to remember what he had with the Doctor despite his good life now.

The &quot;Doctor Who Adventures&quot; comic strip gives the Tenth Doctor a companion from 21st century Scotland named Heather McCrimmon, who is a descendant of Jamie.

==Influence==
The character of Jamie McCrimmon inspired author Diana Gabaldon to set her &quot;Outlander&quot; series in Jacobite Scotland, and to name its protagonist &quot;Jamie&quot;.

The story Gabaldon was watching was &quot;The War Games&quot;. (Gabaldon&#x27;s character&#x27;s surname is &quot;Fraser&quot;; however, Gabaldon has stated that she did not derive this name from Frazer Hines, since the PBS station on which she viewed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; habitually cut off the credits, and so she did not learn Frazer Hines&#x27;s name until some years later.)

<text>Stóra Dímun () is an island in the southern Faroe Islands, sometimes only referred to as Dímun. It is accessible by sea only during periods of clear and calm weather, but there is a regular helicopter service twice a week all year. There is a lighthouse on the island.

==Etymology==

The name &#x27;Stóra Dímun&#x27; means &#x27;Great Dimun&#x27;, in contrast to &#x27;Lítla Dímun&#x27; or &#x27;Little Dimun&#x27;. According to the Faroese placename expert Jakobsen, &#x27;Dimun&#x27; may represent a pre-Norse, Celtic placename element, with &#x27;di&#x27; representing &#x27;two&#x27;. Stora and Litla Dímun shows a pairing of two distinctive but separate localities in one name. Gammeltoft concluded Dímun is a Scandinavian place name for a double-peaked feature of a particular appearance, reflecting a linguistic contact between Scandinavians and Gaels.

==Population==
Before 1920, the ruins of an old church were present, but these no longer exist. There are two peaks on Stóra Dímun: Høgoyggj (396 metres; 1300&#x27;) and Klettarnir (308 metres; 1010&#x27;). The island was once home to many families from the 13th century onwards, but now only two families of seven make their home on the island.

== The Farm ==
There is only one farm at the Southside of the island, and it constitutes its only settlement. The farm benefits from soil that has been fertilized by the guano of millions of seabirds for thousands of years. This gives excellent grazing for the 450 ewes that the island supports. The farm is famed for their turnips and sheepskin, of which they produce some 300-400 each year.

Six to eight calves are slaughtered every year.

There is some tourism during the summer months.

==Important bird area==
The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially European storm petrels (15,000 pairs), Atlantic puffins (40,000 pairs) and black guillemots (50 pairs).

<doc id="1326326" wikidata="Q3061326" url="?curid=1326326" title="Evan Nepean">
<text>Sir Evan Nepean, 1st Baronet, PC FRS (9 July 1752 – 2 October 1822) was a British politician and colonial administrator. He was the first of the Nepean Baronets.

==Family==
Nepean was born at St. Stephens near Saltash, Cornwall, the second of three sons of Nicholas Nepean, an innkeeper, and his second wife, Margaret Jones. His father was Cornish and his mother was from South Wales. The name &quot;Nepean&quot; is thought to come from the village of Nanpean (&quot;the head of the valley&quot;), in Cornwall.

Nepean married Margaret Skinner, the only daughter of Capt. William Skinner, on 6 June 1782 at the Garrison Church at Greenwich. They had eight children, including Sir Molyneux Hyde Nepean, 2nd Bt., and Maj.-Gen. William Nepean, whose daughter Anna Maria Nepean married General Sir William Parke. Their youngest child, Rev. Canon Evan Nepean, became the Canon of Westminster and a Chaplain in Ordinary to Queen Victoria. His grandson Charles was a Middlesex county cricketer who also played football.

==Career==
Nepean entered the Royal Navy on 28 December 1773, serving on as a clerk to Capt. Hartwell. He was promoted to purser in 1775. During the American Revolutionary War he served as secretary to Admiral Molyneux Shuldham, in Boston in 1776 and again at Plymouth (1777–78). From 1780 to 1782 he was Purser on for Captain John Jervis (later Lord St. Vincent).

On 3 March 1782 (aged 29) he was appointed Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. In this position, he came to have responsibility for naval and political intelligence which led to him running a network of spies across Europe. This, in effect, made him Britain&#x27;s top civilian intelligence official, before the establishment of a formal intelligence service, which did not take place until 1909 with the establishment of the domestically-focused Security Service (MI5) and the foreign-focused Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). He served there until December 1791, when he became Under-Secretary of State for War in 1794, Secretary to the Board of Admiralty 1795–1804, Chief Secretary for Ireland 1804–1805, Commissioner of the Admiralty, and then Governor of Bombay 1812–1819.

He was Member of Parliament for Queenborough from 1796 till 1802, then moving to Bridport where he remained until 1812. The Bridport Town Hall, designed by architect William Tyler RA, was given a clock tower with cupola, in about 1805, by Sir Evan. He was made a baronet in 1802 and was admitted to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1804.

In 1820 he was made a member of the Royal Society. In 1822 he was appointed Sheriff of Dorset but died in office the same year at his estate at Loders.

==Legacy==
Places named after Evan Nepean include:

* Australia - the Nepean River in New South Wales, the Nepean Highway and Point Nepean both in Victoria, Nepean Bay in South Australia and Nepean Island in the external territory of Norfolk Island.
* Canada - the former city of Nepean, Ontario, Nepean Point, Nepean Bay.
* India - the Nepean Road and Nepean Sea Road in Mumbai.

<text>The American Ballet was the first professional ballet company George Balanchine created in the United States. The company was founded with the help of Lincoln Kirstein and Edward Warburg, managed by Alexander Merovitch and populated by students of Kirstein and Balanchine&#x27;s School of American Ballet. Having failed to mount a tour, American Ballet began performing at the Old Met. After being allowed to stage only two dance performances (&quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;) in 1936 and an evening of dances choreographed to the music of Igor Stravinsky in 1937), Balanchine moved the company to Hollywood in 1938. The company was restarted as the American Ballet Caravan and toured North and South America, although it too folded after several years.

<text>Ulubatlı Hasan, Hasan of Ulubat (1428 – May 29, 1453) was a Timarli Sipâhî in the service of Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire who achieved legendary status as a heroic Turkish martyr at the successful Siege of Constantinople.

He was born in a small village called Ulubat (near Karacabey) in the province of Bursa.

At the age of 25 he was present at the Siege of Constantinople (April 6, 1453 – May 29, 1453). The Turks had tried to take the grand city and last stronghold of the Roman Empire several times before, but this time, under the command of Sultan Mehmed II, who was in his early twenties at the time and already showing potential of being a great military leader, it looked like victory was at hand. But despite several assaults and the severe hammering by the cannons, the great double walls of Constantinople held for 53 days.

On the early morning of the last day of the siege, May 29, after the morning prayers, the Ottoman military band started to play one of their songs and the city was stormed. Ulubatlı Hasan was among the first to climb the walls of Constantinople followed closely by thirty of his friends. He carried only an Ottoman kilij, a small shield and the Ottoman Flag. He climbed the wall, under showers of arrows, stones, spears and bullets. He reached the top and he placed the flag, which he defended until his 12 remaining friends arrived. After that he collapsed with 27 arrows still in his body. Seeing the Ottoman flag inspired the Ottoman troops and kept their spirits up – and conversely, disheartened the Greek defenders – until finally the Ottomans conquered Constantinople.

==In popular culture==
* Hasan of Ulubat was played by Turan Seyfioğlu in Turkish film &quot;İstanbul&#x27;un Fethi&quot; (1951)
* İbrahim Çelikkol plays Hasan in Turkish film &quot;Fetih 1453&quot; (2012). In the film, there is a romance between him and fictional character named Era (Dilek Serbest).
* Ulubatlı Hasan Alp is played by Sidar Tublek in the Turkish Series &quot;&quot; (2024)

<doc id="1326339" wikidata="Q3196619" url="?curid=1326339" title="Killamangiro">
<text>&quot;Killamangiro&quot; is a song by English band, Babyshambles, released in November 2004 through Rough Trade Records. It achieved respectable chart success, peaking at #8 on the UK Singles Chart.

The song itself features an unusual opening beat from ex-Babyshambles drummer Gemma Clarke and is recognised for guitarist Patrick Walden&#x27;s &quot;messy&quot; style of play and frontman Pete Doherty&#x27;s distinctive vocals. It is a regular feature of live setlists by the band and is one of their most popular and well known songs.

The title is a pun on the name of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, and further mixes in the song&#x27;s lyrics about &quot;kill[ing] a man for his giro&quot; – a bank deposit method often associated with British unemployment benefits.

The track was released as a single, and subsequently included on the album Down in Albion with different production (Mick Jones) and a different drummer (Adam Ficek) from the original. The circumstances of the recording of the song for the album were remarked upon by Babyshambles bass player Drew McConnell on 5 November 2005 in the New Musical Express:

&quot;We weren&#x27;t planning on having &#x27;Killamangiro&#x27; on there. We got in the room and thought, &quot;Let&#x27;s run through &#x27;Killamangiro&#x27;&quot;, but sneaky Mick pressed record. Pete was jumping over the desk and giving the engineer a heart attack. Pete&#x27;s got a thing about not releasing tracks more than once. People have written that we can&#x27;t play our instruments and that&#x27;s really not true because this is completely live.&quot;

Notable for being the only track by Doherty to be produced by Paul Epworth.

==Music video==
The video for &quot;Killamangiro&quot; features orange tinted live footage of the band on stage, with snippets of Doherty walking down a street, out of a shop, mock hanging himself with his mic cord, flicking through a magazine, and driving along in a car (complete with a Christmas tree air freshener). Footage was also shot at the Underground Club in Stoke-on-Trent.

<text>Cockeyed.com is a website that covers a variety of subjects, most of which are projects undertaken by the site&#x27;s creator, Rob Cockerham. Since the creator lives in Sacramento, California, many of his projects take place in notable Sacramento landmarks.

One of the most popular articles is called &quot;How Much is Inside&quot;, which has been part of the website since its establishment in 1998. There are more than 40 episodes online.

Other sections are the &quot;Pranks&quot;, the educational &quot;Science Club&quot; and &quot;Cockerham&#x27;s Incredible Creations&quot;, all of which are presented with pictures detailing the steps of the project.

Cockerham has also used the site as a platform to locate and harass people who engage in spamming.

A particular focus of the website is the multi-level marketing business opportunity from Herbalife. Rob has dedicated many pages to criticizing its independent distributors&#x27; use of signs in public spaces as well as the Herbalife business model.

The website has been featured on &quot;NPR&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot; and in a segment during the &quot;24 Hours of Foo&quot; event on MTV2.

==How Much is Inside? Adventures==
This largest section of Cockeyed.com contains documentation of projects in which Cockerham and his friends measure the usefulness of products, including:
* How much gold is inside Goldschläger?
* An estimate to the ratio of various nuts inside mixed nuts
* Measuring the average length of ramen noodles
* Counting the distribution of color and phrasing in a bag of conversation hearts
* Counting how many chips can be dipped in one can of salsa
* Other &quot;How Much is Inside?&quot; projects measure the utility of:
*:Paper towels, Sharpie pens, a Christmas tree, bacon bits, Dial Complete soap, a Pumpkin, an acre, a keg of beer, spaghetti, popcorn bag, Vegemite spread, a Chevy Trailblazer, a million dollars, Dust-Off can, handrolling tobacco, Oreo cookies, a pound of ground coffee beans, Coca-Cola bottle, french fries, ketchup, print cartridge, chewing gum, 40-foot shipping container, Magic Shell, batteries, Doritos, Cheerios, newspaper, lipstick, Silly String, &quot;blood&quot;, aluminum foil, expanding foam, whipped cream, EZ Cheese, toothpaste and one fake measurement of shaving cream.

Rather than using statistical methods to estimate the contents, the group favors measuring the amounts. For example, to figure out how much is inside of a keg, they (and an invited group of &quot;fellow scientists&quot;) poured and consumed 141 individual cups of beer. Another way to determine the amount would have been to simply calculate the volume of the keg and divide by the volume of each cup.

<doc id="1326346" wikidata="Q2622812" url="?curid=1326346" title="Andy Reid">
<text>Andrew Walter Reid (born March 19, 1958) is an American professional football coach who is the head coach for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). Reid was previously the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1999 to 2012. From 2001 to 2012, he was also the Eagles&#x27; executive vice president of football operations. Reid is the only NFL coach to win 100 games with two different franchises and also the only coach to appear in four consecutive conference championships with two different franchises. He is considered one of the greatest NFL coaches of all time.

Reid began his professional coaching career with the Green Bay Packers, serving as an offensive assistant from 1992 to 1998 and was a member of the team that won Super Bowl XXXI. He held his first head coaching position with the Eagles in 1999, who became perennial postseason contenders under his leadership. Reid led the Eagles to nine playoff runs, six division titles, five NFC Championship Games (including four consecutive from 2001 to 2004), and an appearance in Super Bowl XXXIX. Reid was fired after the 2012 season as the Eagles had missed the postseason for a second straight year.

Hired as the head coach of the Chiefs in 2013, Reid helped revitalize the struggling franchise into the league&#x27;s best. The Chiefs won first playoff game since 1993 in the 2015 season, clinched their first consecutive division titles between 2016 and 2017, and won their first Super Bowl in 50 years in Super Bowl LIV. In 12 seasons with Kansas City, Reid has led the Chiefs to 11 postseason appearances, nine consecutive division titles, seven consecutive AFC Championship Games, five Super Bowl appearances including three straight, and three Super Bowl titles. 

==Early life==
Reid was born in Los Angeles on March 19, 1958. He attended John Marshall High School and worked as a vendor at Dodger Stadium as a teenager. Reid first grew his mustache while sailing as a cadet aboard the TS Golden Bear during his time at the California Maritime Academy. He played youth sports in East Hollywood, at Lemon Grove Recreation Center, where Pete Arbogast, the radio announcer for the USC football team and play-by-play announcer for the Cincinnati Bengals, was one of his coaches.

In 1971, at age 13, Reid was on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; participating in the Punt, Pass, and Kick competition; he was already so large that he wore the jersey of Les Josephson, who was and .

==Playing career==
Reid played offensive tackle at Glendale Community College in Glendale, California, and planned to transfer to Stanford but injured his knee. BYU head coach LaVell Edwards wanted Reid&#x27;s teammate and best friend Randy Tidwell, and also recruited Reid to the team to help persuade Tidwell to come to BYU. At BYU, Reid was a teammate of Jim McMahon and Tom Holmoe.

Teammates recalled that Reid did not play often but was very analytical, closely studying Edwards and offensive coordinator Doug Scovil. BYU won the 1980 Holiday Bowl in his senior year.

==Coaching career==
===Early jobs===
Reid had thought of becoming a writer, but continued to question Edwards about football strategy, causing Edwards to suggest coaching as a career. After graduating from BYU in 1981, Reid spent one year as a graduate assistant on the school&#x27;s football coaching staff; colleagues included Scovil, Norm Chow, and Mike Holmgren. He spent the next nine years as an offensive line coach with four colleges.

During his college coaching career, Reid was on the staff of several teams, including San Francisco State, Northern Arizona University, the University of Texas at El Paso, and the University of Missouri. In 1986, as coach at Northern Arizona, he coached Frank Pollack, who went on to play for six seasons with the San Francisco 49ers.

=== Green Bay Packers assistant (1992–1998) ===
Reid was hired by Holmgren at the Green Bay Packers in 1992, the same year quarterback Brett Favre became a member of that team, placing Reid in the Bill Walsh coaching tree. In 1995, he became the assistant offensive line and tight ends coach, where he helped lead the 1996 team to a Super Bowl XXXI win over the New England Patriots. Reid was named the Packers&#x27; quarterbacks coach in 1997, replacing Marty Mornhinweg, who left to be the offensive coordinator for his predecessor in Green Bay, Steve Mariucci. Mariucci wanted Reid to be his offensive coordinator with the San Francisco 49ers, but Holmgren prevented the move.

=== Philadelphia Eagles (1999–2012) ===
Consistent with his reputation for a focus on football details, Reid arrived at his interview with the Eagles with a five-inch thick book he developed on how he would go about running the team if given the job. The Eagles hired Reid on January 11, 1999; he was the second-youngest head coach in the league after Jon Gruden and the first then to be hired as a head coach without first having served as an offensive or defensive coordinator. Some in the Philadelphia news media criticized the hiring, citing the availability of other candidates who had already served previously as successful head coaches.

As he set about leading the Eagles, one of Reid&#x27;s first major decisions was drafting dual-threat quarterback Donovan McNabb in the first round with the second overall pick, although Reid started former Packers&#x27; backup Doug Pederson in the first nine games of the 1999 season. In Reid&#x27;s first season in Philadelphia, the Eagles improved their record by two games over 1998, finishing 5–11. Among the five wins was the team&#x27;s first road victory in 19 games, 20–16 over the Chicago Bears on October 17.

In 2000, the Eagles posted an 11–5 regular-season record and won their first playoff game since the 1995 season, beating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Philadelphia on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

In 2001, Reid was named executive vice president of football operations of the Eagles, effectively making him the team&#x27;s general manager. Although the Eagles had general managers after 2005 (Tom Heckert from 2005 to 2010 and Howie Roseman from 2010 until Reid&#x27;s departure), Reid had the final say on football matters.
In 2001, Reid&#x27;s Eagles won the first of four consecutive NFC East titles, the longest such streak in franchise history, and advanced to the conference championship game in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, losing this game on the first three occasions.

The 2003 team qualified for postseason play after opening the season with two losses, both at home, and was also the first NFL team ever to reach the conference title round of the playoffs after having been shut out at home on opening day. The 2004 team was the second NFC East squad to defeat all of its division rivals (New York Giants, Dallas Cowboys, and Washington Redskins) twice during the same regular season (the Dallas Cowboys did it in 1998). The 2004 Eagles clinched the NFC #1-seed with a 13–1 record and proceeded to rest their starters for the final two games. After three straight NFC Championship losses, the team beat the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 27–10 and made it to Super Bowl XXXIX but fell to the New England Patriots 24–21.

The 2005 season was difficult for Reid as he sought to deal with wide receiver Terrell Owens&#x27; flamboyant persona, which forced Reid to permanently deactivate him midway through the 2005 season. A couple of weeks later quarterback Donovan McNabb suffered a season-ending injury, leaving the Eagles without the services of two of their star players. The Eagles lost eight of their last ten games and finished 6–10. With their third win of the season – a 23–20 win over the Oakland Raiders – Reid passed Greasy Neale to become the winningest coach in franchise history.

The Eagles had a rollercoaster campaign under Reid in 2006. The season appeared to be lost by October with another season-ending injury to McNabb, turning a 4–1 start into a mid-season breakdown which left the team 5–5. After a 45–21 defeat at the hands of the Indianapolis Colts, the Eagles were on the verge of elimination from the playoffs. Reid coached backup quarterback, Jeff Garcia, and the 5–6 Eagles, to victories over a slew of NFC rivals including the Carolina Panthers, Washington Redskins, New York Giants, and Dallas Cowboys. The Eagles, at 10–6, won the NFC East division title, as well as an NFC wild card game against the New York Giants. Their season ended at the hands of an opportune New Orleans Saints team in the NFC Divisional Round.

In the 2007 season, Reid led the Eagles to an 8–8 season. The Eagles failed to make the postseason.

In the 2008 season, Reid&#x27;s 9–6–1 Eagles managed to defeat the defending Super Bowl Champion New York Giants in the divisional round, leading the team to a fifth NFC Championship game under his tenure, where they lost to the Arizona Cardinals by a score of 32–25. He coached the NFC to a 30–21 win in the 2009 Pro Bowl. However, the team season was marked with tragedy after the death of Jim Johnson, who had been the defensive coordinator for Reid&#x27;s entire career and helped turn the Eagles into one of the NFL&#x27;s elite defenses.

In the 2009 season, Reid failed to win a first-round post-season game for the first time in his career, with his 11–5 Eagles being eliminated by the first place Dallas Cowboys by a score of 34–14 in the Wild Card Round. Over the offseason, the Eagles traded longtime starting quarterback Donovan McNabb to the Washington Redskins. After Week 2 of the 2010 season, Reid named Michael Vick the starting quarterback of the Eagles.

In the 2010 season, Reid led the Eagles to 10–6 record in the regular season and qualified for the playoffs. In the Wild Card Round against the Green Bay Packers, the Eagles lost 21–16.

Reid was named the Earle &quot;Greasy&quot; Neale Award winner for the third time in 2010.

In the 2011 season, Reid led the Eagles to an 8–8 season and failed to make the playoffs.
In the 2012 season, Reid and the Eagles struggled to a 4–12 record, the worst of his head coaching tenure. The year also marked the first time the Eagles missed the postseason in consecutive years under Reid.

On December 31, 2012, the day after the season ended with a 42–7 loss to the New York Giants, Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie announced that Reid&#x27;s contract would not be renewed. Reid was the longest-tenured head coach in the NFL prior to his release. Reid provided encouragement to his successor as Eagles head coach, Chip Kelly.

Lurie said that Reid&#x27;s induction into the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame was inevitable, and players gave their former coach a standing ovation during his last meeting with them. During his 14-year tenure with the Eagles, Reid compiled the best win total (120), winning percentage (.609) and playoff victory total (10) in team history. He captured six division titles and five trips to the NFC Championship game. During this period, no other franchise earned more divisional playoff round appearances (7) and only Bill Belichick&#x27;s New England Patriots exceeded Philadelphia&#x27;s 5 conference championship game appearances with 6. Despite his success, however, Reid was ultimately unable to lead the Eagles to a Super Bowl title.

Reid sent 19 players to 44 Pro Bowl appearances, the highest total for any team in the NFL during that period. None of these players had ever appeared in a Pro Bowl before Reid was hired.

Since 1990, only seven first-time head coaches have remained with their original team for ten years or more: Reid (1999–2012), Bill Cowher (1992–2006 with Pittsburgh), Cincinnati&#x27;s Marvin Lewis (2003–2018), Green Bay&#x27;s Mike McCarthy (2006–2018), New Orleans&#x27; Sean Payton (2006–2021), Pittsburgh&#x27;s Mike Tomlin (2007–present), and Baltimore&#x27;s John Harbaugh (2008–present).

=== Kansas City Chiefs (2013–present) ===

Reid expected the Philadelphia Eagles to not extend him and was already preparing to hire a new coaching staff. Three teams reportedly had airplanes in Philadelphia to fly him to interviews. On January 4, 2013, Reid reached a five-year contract agreement to become the head coach of the Chiefs.

On the same day, the Chiefs fired general manager Scott Pioli. Reid&#x27;s contract made him the final authority in football matters, the same power he had in Philadelphia. A week later, however, the Chiefs hired John Dorsey, who had previously worked with Reid as an assistant in Green Bay, as general manager. Reid and Chiefs owner Clark Hunt announced that Dorsey would have the final say in personnel matters. On the same day, Hunt announced that Reid and Dorsey would report to him on an equal basis; in the past Chiefs coaches reported to the general manager.

In Reid&#x27;s first game as head coach, the Chiefs beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 28–2. It was the widest margin of victory for the Chiefs on opening day since they defeated the Denver Broncos in 1963 by a score of 59–7.

In Week 3, Reid returned to Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia for a &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; game between the Chiefs and his former team, the Philadelphia Eagles. As Reid walked out onto the field before the game started, the crowd gave him a standing ovation. The Chiefs went on to win 26–16 and Reid received a Gatorade shower from his team.

Reid went on to lead the Chiefs to a 9–0 record to start the season, tied for the best start in franchise history. Despite losing five of their last seven games, the Chiefs finished with an 11–5 record to clinch a wild card spot in the AFC playoffs. In the wild card round, they were defeated by the Indianapolis Colts 45–44 after surrendering a 28-point lead in the third quarter.

Under Reid, the Chiefs recorded a winning record in the 2014 season, finishing 9–7. However, they failed to qualify for the playoffs.

In 2015, the Chiefs were in danger of missing the playoffs for a second consecutive year after they lost five straight games to begin the season 1–5. Reid accepted the blame for his team&#x27;s poor start and his future with the Chiefs was called into question. However, the Chiefs won every remaining regular-season game, finishing with an 11–5 record and a wild card spot in the AFC playoffs. Reid would go on to lead the Chiefs to their first playoff win since the 1993 season in a 30–0 shutout of the Houston Texans, but the team was defeated 27–20 in the Divisional Round against the New England Patriots. Prior to the loss, the Chiefs posted an eleven-game winning streak, which is the best in franchise history. Reid was criticized for his clock management near the end of the game, calling no timeouts in a late fourth-quarter drive that cut the Patriots&#x27; 27–13 lead down to a touchdown but took the Chiefs 5 minutes and 16 seconds to score and left them with only a minute and 13 seconds to try and tie the game.

Reid improved in the regular season with the 2016 Chiefs, who finished with a 12–4 record and clinched their division for the first time since 2010, as well as for the first time under Reid. The Chiefs went undefeated against their AFC West rivals to secure the division title on a tiebreaker with the 12–4 Oakland Raiders and obtain a first-round bye in the playoffs as the AFC&#x27;s second seed. The bye was the Chiefs&#x27; first since 2003.
Despite the team&#x27;s regular-season success, the Chiefs were eliminated in the Divisional Round for a second consecutive year in an 18–16 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Although the Chiefs were able to prevent the Steelers from scoring any touchdowns, they were unable to match the six field goals Pittsburgh converted.

The Chiefs started strong during the 2017 season, winning their first five games to become the NFL&#x27;s last remaining undefeated team, including a victory against the defending Super Bowl champions New England Patriots in the kickoff game. After their strong start, the Chiefs lost six of their next seven games, resulting in Reid conceding play calling duties to offensive coordinator Matt Nagy. The Chiefs won their last four games to finish 10–6 and clinch the AFC West for a second consecutive year, the first back-to-back division titles in franchise history. The team ultimately suffered a sixth consecutive home playoff loss in a 22–21 defeat against the Tennessee Titans in the Wild Card Round. Despite holding a 21–3 lead at halftime, the Chiefs were shut out during the second half as the Titans scored 19 unanswered points to win the game.

====Mahomes era (2018–present)====

2018 saw new success for Reid and the Chiefs. Aided by the MVP season of quarterback Patrick Mahomes in his first year as the primary starter, the Chiefs finished the regular season as the AFC&#x27;s top seed for the first time since 1997 and the first time with Reid as head coach by matching 2016&#x27;s 12–4 record. Reid also extended the franchise record for consecutive division titles through clinching the AFC West for a third straight year. The Chiefs subsequently ended their home playoff losing streak by defeating the Indianapolis Colts 31–13 in the Divisional Round, the first postseason win at home since 1993. With the victory, the Chiefs hosted the AFC Championship for the first time in franchise history, which they lost 37–31 to the eventual Super Bowl LIII champion New England Patriots in overtime.

During the season, Reid recorded his 200th victory to become one of only nine NFL head coaches to win 200 games. With his 206th win at the end of the regular season, Reid also surpassed Marty Schottenheimer for the most wins of an NFL head coach to not win a championship.

The Chiefs again finished 12–4 in 2019 to win the AFC West for a fourth consecutive year and after defeating the Houston Texans 51–31 in the Divisional Round, hosted the AFC Championship for a second consecutive year. Upon securing an appearance in Super Bowl LIV with their 35–24 victory over the Tennessee Titans, Reid became one of only seven head coaches to lead two different franchises to a Super Bowl and the Chiefs made their first Super Bowl appearance since Super Bowl IV in 1970. The 15-year gap between Reid&#x27;s first and second Super Bowls is the second longest after Dick Vermeil&#x27;s 19 years. The Chiefs went on to defeat the San Francisco 49ers 31–20, earning the franchise their first Super Bowl victory in 50 years and Reid&#x27;s first as a head coach.

Reid signed a contract extension with the Chiefs during their bye week in the 2020 season. At the time, the Chiefs were leading the AFC West with an 8–1 record. Three weeks later, they became the first AFC team to secure a playoff berth for the season. Kansas City finished with a league-best 14–2 record to secure the AFC&#x27;s top seed. The 14–2 record marked the best in franchise history, in addition to being Reid&#x27;s best as a head coach. During the postseason, the Chiefs defeated the Cleveland Browns 22–17 in the divisional round and the Buffalo Bills 38–24 in the AFC Championship to advance to Super Bowl LV against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance. The game ended in a 31–9 loss, with the Chiefs failing to score a touchdown and losing by double-digits for the first time under Mahomes.
Following a Week 4 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in 2021, Reid became the first NFL head coach to win 100 games with two different franchises. However, the Chiefs began the season 3–4, their first losing record since 2015. Nevertheless, they won nine of their 10 remaining games, including an eight-game winning streak, to clinch the AFC West and the AFC&#x27;s #2 seed. Reid also won his 227th game to surpass Curly Lambeau as the NFL&#x27;s fifth-most-winningest coach. In the playoffs, the Chiefs advanced to their fourth consecutive AFC Championship Game after defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers and Buffalo Bills, making Reid the first head coach to lead two different franchises to four consecutive conference championship games. The Chiefs lost the game 27–24 to the Cincinnati Bengals in overtime after surrendering a 21–3 lead, which was tied with the 2006 Indianapolis Colts&#x27; comeback against the New England Patriots as the largest in a conference championship.

Reid helped lead the Chiefs to a 14–3 record in the 2022 season. The Chiefs won the AFC West for the 7th consecutive season and earned a first-round bye as the top seed for the AFC playoffs. The Chiefs defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Divisional Round and the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship to make the Super Bowl for the 3rd time in four seasons.

Reid&#x27;s next Super Bowl appearance, Super Bowl LVII, pitted his Chiefs against the Philadelphia Eagles, whom he previously coached. He led the Chiefs to a narrow 38–35 victory over his former team to earn his second Super Bowl victory as a head coach.

In the 2023 season, Reid led the Chiefs to an 11–6 record and another AFC West title. Reid earned a spot in his fifth Super Bowl in Super Bowl LVIII following victories over the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card Round, the Buffalo Bills in the Divisional Round, and the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship. He became the fourth head coach in NFL history to reach five Super Bowls. In the Super Bowl, the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25–22 in only the second overtime game in Super Bowl history. Reid became a Super Bowl champion for the third time as head coach and the Chiefs became the first team to repeat since the New England Patriots did it in 2003 and 2004.

In the 2024 season, Reid led the Chiefs to a franchise-record 15 wins in the regular season. The team earned a first-round bye for the AFC playoffs as the top overall seed. Reid led the Chiefs to their third consecutive Super Bowl appearance following wins over the Houston Texans in the Divisional Round and the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship. He became the third coach to reach a sixth Super Bowl appearance. The Chiefs season ended with a 40–22 loss against his former team in Super Bowl LIX in a rematch of the game two years prior.

<text>Skúgvoy ( or Skúvoy , ) is an island in the central Faroe Islands, located to the south of Sandoy.

It is named after the large number of great skua present on the island (who have a habit of attacking intruders). There is only one settlement on the island: Skúvoy on the east coast. There are two mountains: Knúkur (392 m) and Heyggjurin Mikli (391 m).

==History==
The Black Death in the 14th century killed all the inhabitants except one woman; her cottage can still be seen.
Skúvoy was also the home of Sigmundur Brestisson, the hero of the Færeyinga saga (Saga of the Faroese).

==Bird habitat==
There are 300–400 m cliffs along the west coast, which are home to many guillemots. Egg harvesting takes place in early June, though this occurs in the first week only so as to allow the guillemots to lay again. The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially northern fulmars (50,000 pairs), Manx shearwaters (10,000 pairs), European storm petrels (20,000 pairs), great skuas (25 pairs), Atlantic puffins (40,000 pairs), common guillemots (135,000 pairs) and black guillemots (150 pairs), as well as 40 breeding pairs of Eurasian whimbrels.

<doc id="1326352" wikidata="Q4984941" url="?curid=1326352" title="Buddy Ryan">
<text>James David &quot;Buddy&quot; Ryan (February 17, 1931 – June 28, 2016) was an American football coach in the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL). During his 35-season coaching career, Ryan served as the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1986 to 1990, and of the Arizona Cardinals from 1994 to 1995. Ryan also served as the defensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears from 1978 to 1985, and of the Houston Oilers in 1993. Coaching multiple Hall of Fame defensive players throughout his career, Ryan is considered by many to be one of the greatest defensive minds in the history of American football.

Ryan began his professional coaching career as the defensive line coach for the New York Jets of the AFL for the team&#x27;s Super Bowl III victory. He became the defensive line coach for the Minnesota Vikings, overseeing the Purple People Eaters. He then became the defensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears, who won Super Bowl XX. As defensive coordinator of the Bears, he is credited with creating the 46 defense, and the 1985 team led the league in nearly all defensive statistical categories. Ryan then coached the Eagles, served as defensive coordinator of the Oilers, and coached the Cardinals. He was the father of NFL coaches Rex Ryan and Rob Ryan.

==Early life==
Ryan was born on February 17, 1931, and raised in a &quot;small, agricultural-based community&quot; outside of Frederick, Oklahoma. His obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; references the confusion about the year Ryan was born: &quot;His birth year was often listed as 1934; as Rex Ryan said in his memoir, his father had subtracted a few years from his true age to come off as more youthful when first looking for an NFL job.&quot; Ryan played college football for Oklahoma A&amp;M University (now Oklahoma State) where he earned four letters as a guard between 1952 and 1955. He served as a sergeant in the United States Army during the Korean War.

==Coaching==

===High school===
Ryan began his coaching career at Gainesville High School in Gainesville, Texas, in 1957 as an assistant coach under Dub Wooten. When Wooten became head coach at Marshall High School in 1959, Ryan was promoted to head coach at Gainesville where he was also the athletic director. After one season at Gainesville, he spent one year as an assistant coach in Marshall, Texas.

===College===
In 1961, after completing service in the military, (which included playing on the Fourth Army championship football team in Japan) Ryan was determined to continue coaching football when he returned, and not at the high school ranks. However, with so many great coaches already in Texas, college jobs were hard to find. Carl Speegle, a former coach of Ryan&#x27;s, contacted Dick Offenhamer, the head coach of the Buffalo Bulls of the University at Buffalo (UB), who needed a defensive line coach and was also preparing for the program&#x27;s first season at the NCAA Division I level. From 1962 through 1965, the Bulls defense ranked among the national leaders, posting 12 shutouts in that span as well as producing Gerry Philbin. In 1964, Lou Saban, the head coach of the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League (AFL), reportedly offered Ryan a similar job with the Bills, but he received a $2,000 raise from UB to stay. In 1965, Ryan took a job at Pacific, before finishing his college coaching career the following season with Vanderbilt.

===New York Jets===
Ryan joined the New York Jets of the AFL in 1968. He and Walt Michaels&#x27; defensive game plan was instrumental in holding the NFL&#x27;s Baltimore Colts to seven points in Super Bowl III and earning Ryan his first Super Bowl ring. Seeing the emphasis that Weeb Ewbank placed on protecting Joe Namath and his fragile knees, Ryan created multiple blitz packages (i.e. the &quot;59 blitz&quot;, the &quot;Taco Bell blitz&quot;, and the &quot;Cheeseburger blitz&quot;) reasoning that the quarterback is the focal point of any offense, and that a defense must attack the offense&#x27;s strength and centerpiece.

===Minnesota Vikings===
In 1976 and 1977, Ryan served as defensive line coach for the Minnesota Vikings. The Vikings&#x27; defensive line, known as the &quot;Purple People Eaters&quot;, was heralded for its ability to punish rivals. The 1976 Vikings won the NFC Championship and appeared in Super Bowl XI. In 1977, the Vikings won the NFC Central and reached the NFC Championship game. During his time with the Vikings, he started working on a defensive nickel scheme designed to disrupt the passing game. That formed the early basis of the 46 defense. While Buddy had the title of DL coach, at the insistence of head coach Bud Grant he was actually running the defense.

===Chicago Bears===
In 1978, owner George Halas brought in Ryan as defensive coordinator. With the Bears, Ryan created the 46 defense, named after then Bears safety Doug Plank, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1981 that the scheme was perfected. This was due in large part to Mike Singletary&#x27;s ability to single-handedly dominate the middle of the field. The defensive players were so loyal to Ryan that when Bears head coach Neill Armstrong was fired in 1982, they urged Halas to name Ryan head coach or at least have the new coach keep Ryan as defensive coordinator. Ultimately, Mike Ditka was hired as the head coach. Ryan and Ditka &quot;feuded openly&quot;, though Ditka mostly left the defense in Ryan&#x27;s hands &quot;Ditka challenged Ryan to a fight during halftime&quot; of the Bears&#x27; 1985 matchup versus the Miami Dolphins, with the team at 12–0 and trailing 31–10 in a nationally televised &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcast. &quot;The guys on the team had to separate them—the offense getting Ditka away from Ryan and defensive guys holding Buddy.&quot; The Bears went on to lose the game 38–24, which was their only loss of the season. However, the team would go on to Super Bowl XX where they would dominate the New England Patriots 46–10. The Bears defense carried Ryan off the field on their shoulders &quot;...right behind Mike Ditka&quot;, who was also being carried off the field. This was the first time two coaches were ever carried off the field at the Super Bowl.

The Bears defense set several NFL records in 1985, and led the league in turnovers forced and surrendered the fewest yards, points, and first downs.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
That offseason, Ryan was hired by the Philadelphia Eagles as their head coach. Ryan released running back Earnest Jackson, who had rushed for more than 1,000 yards in both of the previous two seasons, and limited the playing time of veteran quarterback Ron Jaworski. Ryan coached players such as Randall Cunningham, Reggie White, and Andre Waters and drafted Pro Bowlers Seth Joyner, Clyde Simmons, Jerome Brown, Eric Allen, Cris Carter, Fred Barnett, and Keith Jackson. The Eagles made the playoffs in 1988, 1989, and 1990.

On October 25, 1987, he came under fire after a game against the Dallas Cowboys by scoring a touchdown in the final seconds, when the outcome was no longer in doubt. This was apparently Ryan&#x27;s revenge against Dallas head coach Tom Landry, who Ryan felt had run up the score against the Eagles&#x27; replacement players during the 1987 players&#x27; strike, using many of the Cowboys players that had crossed the picket line. The controversy marred a season in which the Eagles improved to 7–8, which included a 31–27 win over the eventual Super Bowl champion Redskins at Veterans Stadium.

On November 22, 1989, Ryan found himself at the center of another scandal, when Cowboys head coach Jimmy Johnson alleged Ryan had taken out a &quot;bounty&quot; on two Cowboys players—then-current Dallas (and former Philadelphia) placekicker Luis Zendejas and quarterback Troy Aikman in a game dubbed &quot;Bounty Bowl&quot; played on Thanksgiving Day at Texas Stadium. Ryan&#x27;s Eagles compiled an 8–2 record against the Cowboys.

On January 8, 1991, Ryan was fired by the Eagles after going 43–35–1 in five seasons, a total that included an 0–3 record in playoff games. As quoted by Eagles owner Norman Braman, &quot;It is time to stop being a bridesmaid and become a bride.&quot; Ryan was replaced by his offensive coordinator in Rich Kotite, whom he had hired from the Jets the previous year. Ryan subsequently became an NFL commentator for CNN.

===Houston Oilers===
Ryan became the defensive coordinator for the Houston Oilers in 1993, and his defensive team helped propel the Oilers to an 11-game winning streak at the end of the 1993 NFL season. On January 2, 1994, in the Oilers&#x27; final regular season game against the New York Jets, Ryan was involved in a sideline altercation with the offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride during the nationally telecast game.

Ryan had been criticizing Gilbride&#x27;s &quot;run and shoot&quot;, referring to it as the &quot;chuck and duck.&quot; Ryan thought that last-minute defensive stands lost him two players to injuries when the offense could have simply run the clock out. At the end of the first half in the game against the Jets, Gilbride called a pass play, and when Cody Carlson fumbled the snap, Ryan started yelling at Gilbride, who then started walking towards Ryan, yelling back. When they were at arm&#x27;s length, &quot;Ryan ... attempted to punch Gilbride in the jaw&quot; before linebacker Keith McCants and several other Oilers players separated them. &quot;Kevin Gilbride will be selling insurance in two years,&quot; Ryan said a few days after the incident.

The Oilers lost to the Kansas City Chiefs 28–20 in a divisional round match at the Astrodome two weeks later on January 16. After scoring the Chiefs&#x27; first touchdown on a 7-yard pass from Joe Montana, Keith Cash fired the football at an image of Ryan&#x27;s face on a banner hanging beyond the end zone. Holding no grudge against Ryan, Cash explained, &quot;I saw it as I was crossing the goal line, and it was just impulse. I just let it fly.&quot;

===Arizona Cardinals===
After being given a large share of the credit for the success in Houston in 1993, Ryan was named head coach and general manager of the Arizona Cardinals in 1994. On arriving in Phoenix, Ryan announced, &quot;You&#x27;ve got a winner in town.&quot; Ryan was cited as providing a spark of interest in the team with his outspoken nature; he also named his two sons in Rob and Rex to be assistant coaches. Ryan went 8–8 his first year, which came with an offense that was in the bottom five of both total offense and scoring offense; the eight wins were the most for the franchise since the move to Arizona along with their first non-losing season since 1984. The following year did not go as well. He was fired after the Cardinals crumbled to 4–12 the following season, which saw them lose seven of their final eight games. After a miserable 37–13 loss on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; to the Dallas Cowboys to close the year out, Ryan (who mistakenly left the field before the final seconds) was fired by owner Bill Bidwill on December 26. Bidwell cited the lackluster effort by the team as the pushing factor in his decision. He spent two seasons in Arizona and compiled a record of 12–20.

==Legacy==
Ryan was an assistant on three different teams to make the Super Bowl (New York Jets, Chicago Bears, and Minnesota Vikings). He built his reputation as a defensive specialist and was largely credited with implementing and perfecting the 46 defense.

Ryan&#x27;s twin sons have been coaches in the NFL. Rex Ryan was head coach of the Buffalo Bills and New York Jets, and Rob Ryan was an assistant head coach and defensive coordinator for a number of teams.

==Personal life==
Ryan was previously married to Doris Ryan, and had three sons: James David Jr., and fraternal twins Rex and Rob. They divorced after 11 years of marriage, eight months after Rex and Rob were born.

Ryan met his second wife, Joanie Ryan, in 1968 when the two lived in the same apartment building in the Bayside neighborhood of Queens, while he was an assistant coach with the New York Jets. The two married in 1970. She died in September 2013 after a long battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Ryan died on June 28, 2016, on his ranch in Shelbyville, Kentucky, at the age of 85, after a lengthy illness. He was buried at Lawrenceburg Cemetery in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, where he also had a farm. Ryan had battled cancer and suffered a major stroke in recent years.

<text>The 21st Lancers (Empress of India&#x27;s) was a cavalry regiment of the British Army, raised in 1858 and amalgamated with the 17th Lancers in 1922 to form the 17th/21st Lancers. Perhaps its most famous engagement was the Battle of Omdurman, where Winston Churchill (then an officer of the 4th Hussars), rode with the unit.

==History==

===Formation===
The regiment was originally raised in Bengal by the East India Company in 1858 as the 3rd Bengal European Light Cavalry, for service in the Indian Rebellion. As with all other &quot;European&quot; units of the Company, it was placed under the command of the British Crown in 1858, and formally moved into the British Army in 1862, when it was designated as a hussar regiment and titled the 21st Regiment of Hussars. A detachment saw service in the 1884–5 expedition to the Sudan, with the Light Camel Regiment. In 1897 it was re-designated as a lancer regiment, becoming the 21st Lancers. The Indian origin of the regiment was commemorated in its &quot;French grey&quot; facings - this distinctive light blue/grey shade having previously been the uniform colour of the East India Company&#x27;s eight regiments of Bengal Native Cavalry.

===Mahdist War===

In 1898 the regiment served in Sudan during the Mahdist War, as the only British cavalry unit involved. It was there that the full regiment charged with lances in the classic cavalry style during the Battle of Omdurman in September 1898. Of less than 400 men involved in the charge 70 were killed and wounded and the regiment won three Victoria Crosses. These three were Private Thomas Byrne, Lieutenant Raymond de Montmorency and Captain Paul Kenna. This spectacular encounter earned considerable public attention and praise for the regiment, though it was also criticized as a costly and unnecessary anachronism - since the 2,000 Dervish spearmen dispersed by the 21st Lancers could have been destroyed by rifle fire with few if any British losses. Winston Churchill (then an officer of the 4th Hussars), rode with the unit.

&quot;Omdurman&quot; was the regiment&#x27;s only battle honour, giving rise to the satirical regimental motto of &quot;thou shalt not kill.&quot; That same year, the regiment was given the title 21st (Empress of India&#x27;s) Lancers, taking the name from Queen Victoria who was the Empress of India.

===Service in Ireland and India===

The regiment was moved to Dublin in 1899, and served in Ireland for several years. In 1912 it was again posted to India. The 21st Lancers did not see service on the Western Front during the First World War, being the only regular cavalry regiment of the British Army to spend the duration of the war in India. The regiment did however see action on the North-West Frontier during 1915–16, with one trooper, Charles Hull, receiving the Victoria Cross. A single squadron made up of reservists served in France in 1916–17, attached to XIV Corps.

===Disbandment===
The regiment was retitled 21st Lancers (Empress of India&#x27;s) in 1921 and shortly thereafter disbanded as part of the post-War reduction in forces, though a cadre was briefly resurrected in 1922 in order to amalgamate with the 17th Lancers, to form the 17th/21st Lancers.

==Regimental museum==
The regimental collection is held at The Royal Lancers and Nottinghamshire Yeomanry Museum which is based at Thoresby Hall in Nottinghamshire.

In his two seasons, he had totals of 729 rushing yards, 558 receiving yards and 501 kickoff return yards for a 26.4 average per return; he had three 100+ yard rushing games. In 2023, he was inducted into the Tulsa Athletic Hall of Fame.

===NFL===
Rhodes was selected by the New York Giants in the tenth round of the 1974 NFL draft, 236th overall. He spent his first three years in the NFL as a wide receiver before switching to cornerback. In 1979, he was traded to the San Francisco 49ers for Tony Dungy, another future head coach. He retired after one season with the 49ers.

==Coaching career==

===NFL===

====Assistant coach====
Rhodes remained with the 49ers as an assistant secondary coach before becoming defensive backs coach. He won four Super Bowls with a group that included Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright, and Dwight Hicks. After serving that position for many years, he was hired by former colleague Mike Holmgren to be the new defensive coordinator for the Green Bay Packers. After two years Rhodes returned to San Francisco as the defensive coordinator of their 1994 Super Bowl-winning team.

Following his head coaching jobs, Rhodes served as the defensive coordinator for the Washington Redskins and the Denver Broncos. After the 2002 season, Rhodes was reunited with Holmgren when he became the defensive coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks, where he remained through the 2007 season.

In September 2005, Rhodes was hospitalized for dizziness and tests later revealed that he had suffered from a mild stroke. Early Monday October 2, 2006, the Seahawks charter flight had to make an emergency landing in Rapid City, South Dakota to get precautionary medical care for Rhodes. The Seahawks were flying home from a loss at the Chicago Bears.

On January 28, 2008, Ray Rhodes joined his sixth NFL organization when he was hired by the Houston Texans as an assistant defensive backs coach.

====Head coach====

=====Philadelphia Eagles=====
On February 2, 1995, five days after the 49ers won Super Bowl XXIX, Ray Rhodes was named head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, becoming the fourth African-American head coach in NFL history behind Fritz Pollard, Art Shell and Dennis Green. Rhodes gained notoriety for his no-nonsense approach and unusual ways of motivating his players. One such tactic was an analogy &quot;comparing the feeling of a loss to someone breaking into (one&#x27;s) home and sodomizing (one&#x27;s) horses and kids.&quot;

In Rhodes&#x27;s first season, he received the NFL Coach of the Year Award as the Eagles overcame a 1–3 start to finish 10–6 and qualify for the playoffs as a wild card. Despite playing the first-round game at home, the Eagles were an underdog to the Detroit Lions, whose starting left tackle, Lomas Brown, guaranteed an easy win. Using this perceived lack of respect as a rallying cry, Philadelphia dismantled Detroit, 58–37, at one point leading the game by a 51–7 score. Rhodes said after the victory that the only things guaranteed in life are &quot;death and taxes.&quot; Though the Eagles were eliminated by the Dallas Cowboys the following week, the 1995 season was considered an enormous success.

In 1996, the Eagles again finished 10–6, but struggled down the stretch after an impressive 7–2 start. Once again, Philadelphia reached the playoffs as a wild card, traveling to San Francisco to face the 49ers, Rhodes&#x27;s former team. At a rain-soaked 3Com Park, the Eagles, who boasted the top-ranked offense in the NFC during the regular season, were shut out, 14–0.

During training camp in 1997, Rhodes remarked that season&#x27;s Eagles team was his most talented one to date. Despite the optimism, Philadelphia started 1–3, and never quite recovered, stumbling to a disappointing 6–9–1 record, including an 0–7–1 mark on the road. As the team struggled through the season, it was widely speculated that players had grown weary of Rhodes&#x27;s fiery approach and were tuning him out.

The 1998 season proved to be a disaster. A listless Eagles team finished 3–13, setting a franchise record for losses in a season. For the second straight season, Philadelphia did not win a road game, going 0–8 away from home. The offense, which ranked first in the NFC two years earlier, finished dead last in the NFL. The Eagles were shut out three times and scored only 161 total points. On December 28, one day after the season&#x27;s final game, Rhodes was fired as Philadelphia&#x27;s head coach. In four seasons as the Eagles&#x27; head coach, Rhodes compiled a 29–34–1 record in the regular season and a 1–2 record in the playoffs.

=====Green Bay Packers=====
The Green Bay Packers were looking for a new coach after Mike Holmgren had left to become head coach and general manager of the Seattle Seahawks. Green Bay GM Ron Wolf was a fan of Rhodes&#x27;s coaching style. On January 11, 1999, Rhodes was hired to coach the Packers after being the only candidate to interview for the position.

Rhodes&#x27;s tenure as head coach lasted only one season. They started off with wins in four of their first six games before meeting Holmgren&#x27;s Seahawks. Seattle thrashed Green Bay 27–7 in what was the first loss of six in a nine-game span. Rhodes spent the season under heavy scrutiny by the Wisconsin sports media, beginning with accusations of underachieving. One particular loss served as a lightning rod for criticism (such as ESPN&#x27;s Paul Maguire). Green Bay was trying to protect a 31-27 lead over the Carolina Panthers, who had the ball at their own 37-yard line with four minutes remaining. A would-be touchdown was instead overruled by replay that instead had Green Bay stay on the field. Rhodes failed to use a timeout at any point (Carolina used all three during the four minute drive) that eventually resulted in Carolina win on a quarterback run as time expired. The loss was the third at home for the season, the most for a Packer team since 1991. The Packers would ultimately finish 8–8, which would be their only non-winning season between 1992 and 2004. Green Bay missed the playoffs for the first time since 1992, based on a tiebreaker system (Detroit and Dallas reached the playoffs with 8–8 records, while Green Bay and the Carolina Panthers did not). 

On January 3, 2000, Rhodes was fired by the Packers, and subsequently replaced by Mike Sherman. Months later, Rhodes accused the team of setting him up to fail, stating that Wolf had hired him into &quot;a situation where there was an overestimation of the talent there.&quot; He also stated his regrets in expecting his players to be responsible and trying to treat them the way Rhodes wanted to be treated when he was a player.

==Head coaching record==
==Personal life==
Rhodes and his wife, Carmen have four daughters.

While in Philadelphia, Rhodes spent a lot of time enjoying his favorite hobby, horse racing. He appeared regularly on &quot;Courier-Post&quot;″s &quot;Dusty Nathan&#x27;s Winner&#x27;s Circle&quot; radio show.

In September 2005, Rhodes suffered a stroke while at his suburban Seattle home. During the 2006 season, Rhodes suffered from stroke-like symptoms while on the Seahawks&#x27; team flight home from a game at Chicago; the plane made an emergency landing in South Dakota due to the incident.

Rhodes and his family currently reside in San Francisco, California.

<doc id="1326367" wikidata="Q3564997" url="?curid=1326367" title="Wade Phillips">
<text>Harold Wade Phillips (born June 21, 1947) is an American football coach who is currently the head coach of the San Antonio Brahmas of the United Football League (UFL). He has served as head coach of the Denver Broncos, Buffalo Bills, Dallas Cowboys, and Houston Roughnecks. He has also served as interim head coach for the New Orleans Saints, Atlanta Falcons, and the Houston Texans. Additionally, Phillips has long been considered to be among the best defensive coordinators in the NFL. In his long career, he has served as defensive coordinator in eight separate stints with seven different franchises (twice with the Denver Broncos). Multiple players under Phillips&#x27; system have won Defensive Player of the Year: Reggie White, Bryce Paup, Bruce Smith, J. J. Watt and Aaron Donald. Others under Phillips have won Defensive Rookie of the Year: Mike Croel and Shawne Merriman. In Phillips&#x27; lone Super Bowl victory, a defensive player would be named Super Bowl MVP: Von Miller.

==Early career==
Phillips attended Port Neches–Groves High School in Port Neches, Texas, and went to the University of Houston, where he was a three-year starter at linebacker from 1966 to 1968. He held the school record for career assisted tackles (228) until 2011 when the record was broken by Marcus McGraw.

Phillips began his coaching career as a graduate assistant to Bill Yeoman at the University of Houston in 1969. From 1970 to 1972 he served as defensive coordinator at the former Lutcher Stark High School (now West Orange-Stark High School) in Orange, Texas. He then coached the linebackers at Oklahoma State University from 1973 to 1974, under his father, Bum Phillips, who was OSU defensive coordinator at that time. In 1975, Phillips coached the defensive line at the University of Kansas under head coach Bud Moore.

==NFL coaching==
Phillips began his professional coaching career with the Houston Oilers, head-coached by his father. He served as the linebackers coach in 1976, and the defensive line coach from 1977 to 1980.

Wade remained on his father&#x27;s staff as the pair headed for New Orleans. Bum stepped down as head coach of a struggling Saints team in late 1985, and Wade stepped in as interim head coach. The Saints routed the eventual NFC West champion Los Angeles Rams 29–3 in his first game at the helm, but finished with losses to the Cardinals, 49ers and Falcons. Phillips was interviewed for the job permanently in January 1986 by new Saints president and general manager Jim Finks, but the position went to Jim Mora, the highly successful coach of the United States Football League&#x27;s Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars.

Wade spent the next three years as the defensive coordinator of the Philadelphia Eagles under Buddy Ryan. During Phillips&#x27; tenure in Philadelphia, defensive end Reggie White recorded 21 sacks in just 12 games in 1987, and the Eagles won the NFC East championship in 1988. Phillips&#x27; last game with the Eagles was the infamous Fog Bowl vs. the Chicago Bears in the NFC divisional playoffs.

===Denver Broncos===
Phillips then spent four seasons as the defensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos. The Broncos reached Super Bowl XXIV, where they lost to the San Francisco 49ers, 55–10. Phillips replaced Dan Reeves as head coach for the Broncos in 1993, but was fired after a mediocre 1994 season in which management felt he lost control of the team.

===Buffalo Bills===
Phillips spent two seasons as the Buffalo Bills defensive coordinator under Hall of Fame coach Marv Levy. After Levy&#x27;s retirement in 1998, the Bills hired Phillips as head coach. Phillips enjoyed a successful coaching stop in Buffalo, but a loss to the Titans in the 1999 playoffs haunted Phillips for the rest of his tenure. Prior to the game, Phillips made the controversial decision to start Rob Johnson at quarterback, after Doug Flutie was the starter the whole year and led the team to the playoffs. Following an 8–8 record in 2000, owner Ralph Wilson fired Phillips after Phillips refused to fire special teams coach Ronnie Jones.

===Dallas Cowboys===
On February 8, 2007, Phillips was named the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys, replacing the retired Bill Parcells. This was the most successful coaching stop for Phillips. He was chosen after Jerry Jones interviewed 10 potential replacements, including former Cowboys and former San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Norv Turner, former Chicago Bears defensive coordinator Ron Rivera and former Cowboys quarterback Jason Garrett. In the 2007 NFL playoffs, he led the Cowboys to another playoff loss, making his playoff record 0–4. The Cowboys failed to make the playoffs in 2008, as the season ended with a 44–6 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, preventing a wild card playoff berth.

Prior to the 2009 season, Phillips also took over as defensive coordinator, replacing the fired Brian Stewart. Phillips called defensive plays for the final 10 games of the 2008 season after Stewart was stripped of the responsibilities. On January 9, 2010, in the 2009–10 playoffs, Phillips&#x27; Cowboys defeated the Eagles in the wild card round, ending the club&#x27;s 13-year playoff win drought (6 games total, Phillips was only coach for one of those losses) and earning Phillips his first playoff win. Following the 2009 season, Phillips signed a contract extension through the 2011 season. However, he was fired by the Cowboys on November 8, 2010, following the second-worst start in franchise history (one win in their first eight games) punctuated by a 45–7 loss to the Green Bay Packers. Garrett was named interim head coach, then permanent successor, and held the position through 2019.

===Houston Texans===
On January 5, 2011, Phillips was hired as the defensive coordinator of the Houston Texans, replacing Frank Bush, who was released by Texans owner Bob McNair. The Texans defense made major improvements on defense in Phillips&#x27; first year calling Houston&#x27;s defense. Houston allowed the fourth-fewest points in the league in 2011 (compared to fourth-most in 2010), the second-fewest yards allowed (third-most in 2010) and third-fewest yards per play (4.8, compared to 6.0, second-worst in 2010). On November 3, 2013, Texans head coach Gary Kubiak collapsed at the end of the first half of the Texans-Colts game; he was then hospitalized at a local hospital. In Kubiak&#x27;s absence, Phillips was given the head coaching duties as the acting head coach for the remainder of the game. On November 6, 2013, the Texans and Kubiak decided to temporarily hand Phillips the head coaching duties, and named him the interim head coach until Kubiak was medically cleared to return. Exactly one month later, Kubiak was fired after his team had lost 11 games in a row. Once again, Phillips served as interim head coach for the Texans until the end of the season, when former Penn State head coach and New England Patriots offensive coordinator Bill O&#x27;Brien was hired as the new head coach. When Phillips was dismissed by Houston, this ended a continuous run where he had coached football at the high school, college, and NFL levels.

===Denver Broncos (second stint)===
On January 28, 2015, Phillips reunited with Gary Kubiak, joining the latter&#x27;s staff as the defensive coordinator on the Denver Broncos. It would be Phillips&#x27; second stint at that position with the team. Phillips replaced his predecessor&#x27;s complex wait-and-react scheme with a simple style of going after the ball, making Denver the top-ranked defense that season, which carried the team to a 12–4 record and the number one seed in the AFC despite their offensive struggles. In Super Bowl 50, played on February 7, 2016, in Santa Clara, California, the game was seen by some as a contest between Phillips and Carolina Panthers offensive coordinator Mike Shula, as both of them were sons of well-known NFL coaches, and as Carolina had the top-ranked offense in the 2015 regular season. Denver&#x27;s defense shut down Carolina and Cam Newton in a 24–10 victory, giving Phillips the first Super Bowl victory of his career.

Following the retirement of Kubiak as head coach after the 2016 season, Phillips was replaced by Joe Woods as the defensive coordinator for the Broncos.

===Los Angeles Rams===
After a successful stint with the Denver Broncos, Phillips left to become defensive coordinator of the Los Angeles Rams, alongside new head coach Sean McVay.

In Super Bowl LIII, Phillips&#x27; defense was credited with keeping the New England Patriots and Tom Brady out of the end zone until the fourth quarter, as the Rams only trailed by a field goal for the first three quarters despite the Patriots&#x27; offense having the majority of possession. The Patriots&#x27; offense had to resort to running the ball often, eventually tiring out the Rams defensive line. However, the Rams&#x27; top-ranked offense that game was stifled and they lost to the Patriots, 13–3.

On January 6, 2020, the Rams announced they would not be renewing his contract. This followed their 2019 season in which the Rams went 9–7 and failed to make the playoffs.
His 82 career wins as an NFL head coach equals the number of wins his father had as an NFL head coach.
=== Houston Roughnecks ===
In April 2022, Phillips was announced as a Head Coach for an XFL Team. It was later revealed in July 2022 that he would be coaching the Houston Roughnecks. Phillips finished with a 7–3 record, while earning their first playoff berth and clinching first place in the South Division. The Roughnecks were eliminated by the Arlington Renegades in the South Division title game in the playoffs.

=== San Antonio Brahmas ===
On December 28, 2023, San Antonio Brahmas head coach Hines Ward resigned from the Brahmas after finishing with a 3–7 record in 2023, in response to a change in contract structure. Phillips agreed to take the Brahmas Head Coaching job along with his former Roughnecks Offensive Coordinator A.J. Smith. Phillips led San Antonio to an 8–3 record in 2024. The team had one of the UFL&#x27;s top defenses and only gave up a League-best 15.3 points per game. San Antonio reached the UFL Championship against the Birmingham Stallions.

==Head coaching record==

Counting head coaching jobs as well as interim stints, Phillips has served as head coach for more teams (six) than any other person in NFL history.

==Personal life==
Wade is the son of former NFL coach Bum Phillips and Helen Wilson Phillips. He adored his father, both personally and professionally, stating, &quot;I was blessed to have him as a father and coach. I got to coach with him for 11 years. He taught me everything I know about coaching. He taught me right and wrong. He taught me to enjoy life.&quot;

Wade Phillip&#x27;s son, Wes Phillips, is the offensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings.

Wade and wife Laurie met in 1964 at Port Neches–Groves High School, where he was the quarterback of the football team and she was the head cheerleader.

<doc id="1326371" wikidata="Q5606609" url="?curid=1326371" title="Gregg Williams">
<text>Gregg Williams (born July 15, 1958) is an American football coach who is currently the defensive coordinator for the DC Defenders of the United Football League (UFL). His most recent National Football League (NFL) experience was as the defensive coordinator for the New York Jets, from 2019 to 2020. Previously, he was head coach of the Buffalo Bills from 2001 to 2003, and defensive coordinator of the New Orleans Saints (with whom he won Super Bowl XLIV) from 2009 to 2011, and the Cleveland Browns, acting as an interim head coach in the 2018 season. Williams is known for running aggressive, attacking 4–3 schemes that put heavy pressure on opposing quarterbacks and for his key role in the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal, also known as &quot;Bountygate&quot;.

In March 2012, Williams was suspended indefinitely from the NFL as a result of his admitted involvement in the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal, under which bounties were paid for causing injuries that would take targeted players on opposing teams out of games. Williams&#x27; suspension was lifted a year later, and he returned to the NFL.

Williams was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 2016. In 2004, Williams helped create a charity, the &quot;Gregg Williams Foundation&quot;, that benefits the local schools and community in his hometown of Excelsior Springs, Missouri. The charity has contributed over $2,000,000 since 2004 to benefit the Excelsior Springs community.

==Football career==

===Early career===
After graduating from Excelsior Springs High School (MO) in 1976, Gregg Williams played quarterback at Northeast Missouri State University (now Truman State University) in Kirksville, Missouri. He started his coaching career as an assistant football coach at this alma mater, Excelsior Springs High School (MO). After being passed over for the head coaching job at Excelsior Springs High School in 1983, he was hired as head coach for the Class 5 Belton High School Pirate football team in Belton, Missouri. After coaching at Belton High School for four seasons, Williams was hired in 1988 as an assistant coach at the University of Houston under former Washington Redskins head coach, Jack Pardee.

===Houston Oilers / Tennessee Titans===
In 1990, Williams became the Special Teams coach of the Houston Oilers under then defensive coordinator, Buddy Ryan. From 1994 to 1996, Williams was the linebackers coach for the Oilers. From 1997–2000, Williams was promoted to defensive coordinator of the now Tennessee Titans after the Oilers moved out of Houston. As the defensive coordinator, the Titans led the league in total defense and only gave up 191 points, the third fewest in the NFL since the league adopted the 16-game schedule in 1978. The defense also helped lead the Titans to Super Bowl XXXIV where they lost to the St. Louis Rams.

===Buffalo Bills===
Williams joined the Buffalo Bills as head coach in 2001 along with new team President and general manager Tom Donahoe. After three seasons in which the team compiled records of 3–13, 8–8, and 6–10 under his leadership, Williams&#x27; contract was not renewed after the 2003 season.

===Washington Redskins===
After his release from Buffalo, Williams was at the top of several NFL teams&#x27; list for the position of defensive coordinator. Williams quickly signed with the Washington Redskins, the only team with which he interviewed, because Head Coach Joe Gibbs offered him total autonomy over his defensive players and defensive coaching staff.

In Washington, with Williams&#x27; aggressive defensive scheme, the Redskins&#x27; defense ranked third in the NFL in 2004 and ninth in 2005.

On January 3, 2006, Williams signed a three-year extension to remain with the Redskins, which made him the highest paid assistant coach in the NFL.

His defense struggled in 2006, at one point ranked 30th in the League. However, the 2007 season was a vast improvement for Williams. The defense ranked within the top ten in the NFC, and the team finished 9–7, with a loss in the wildcard round to the Seattle Seahawks. Williams had established a particularly close relationship with 24-year-old free safety Sean Taylor, calling him &quot;the best player [he&#x27;d] ever coached.&quot; When Taylor was murdered mid-season on November 27, 2007, Williams was deeply affected. In tribute to Taylor, Williams called a defensive play with only ten men for the first play of the Redskins&#x27; first game after the tragedy, a December 2, 2007 game against the Buffalo Bills. For the remainder of the season, Williams ran an inspired defense which performed, along with the rest of the team, to honor Taylor&#x27;s memory, highlighted by holding star running back Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings to 27 yards on December 23, 2007, and allowing a franchise-low one yard rushing to the Dallas Cowboys on December 30, 2007, sealing a playoff seed. After Joe Gibbs retired, Williams was considered to be the most popular candidate to take over as head coach of the Washington Redskins. He interviewed four times with team owner Daniel Snyder. However, on January 26, 2008, Williams was fired, along with offensive coordinator Al Saunders, with Jim Zorn ultimately getting the head coaching job.

===Jacksonville Jaguars===
On February 6, 2008, Williams became the defensive coordinator of the Jacksonville Jaguars, replacing Mike Smith, who had been hired to coach the Atlanta Falcons.

===New Orleans Saints===
Williams was hired by the New Orleans Saints on January 15, 2009. Head coach Sean Payton, who was heavily involved in the effort to recruit Williams to the team, raved about Williams &quot;because he was so impressive and prepared&quot; in his interview. In fact, Williams was so impressive that Payton offered and took a voluntary $250,000 cut in salary to help facilitate his signing with the team. He took over a Saints defense ranked 23rd in the NFL in yards allowed and tied for 26th in points allowed in 2008. Williams&#x27; approach yielded immediate results, as the 2009 Saints recorded 35 defensive takeaways, second in the league, and the aggressive defense played an integral role in the Saints&#x27; run to their first Super Bowl championship.

However, in the 2010 and 2011 seasons, the defense (although showing statistical improvement in some other categories) failed to repeat its turnover successes. The Saints were knocked out of the 2011 playoffs in a 36–32 loss to San Francisco, in which the defense played well for most of the game but twice failed to hold a Saints lead during the last four minutes. At that time, the relationship between Williams and Payton deteriorated, with Payton regarding Williams as a &quot;rogue coach&quot;. Williams&#x27; departure from the Saints was originally publicized not as a dismissal since his contract was expiring, however Loomis and Payton fired Williams telling him, &quot;There&#x27;s no place for this in this organization or this league&quot;, after the NFL informed the Saints that it had reopened its investigation in the illegal bounty fund. It was widely reported that Williams would leave the Saints to become defensive coordinator of the St. Louis Rams, under their new head coach Jeff Fisher, for whom Williams had worked when Fisher was the head coach at Tennessee.

====Involvement in Saints bounty scandal====
On March 2, 2012, it was revealed that during Williams&#x27; tenure, the Saints ran an illegal &quot;bounty fund&quot; which paid players for causing injuries to opponents that would result in those players leaving the game. The NFL found that Williams and as many as 27 Saints defensive players were involved in the scheme. An unidentified Saints player first alerted the NFL to the scheme in the 2010 offseason, but the investigation stalled until the NFL found irrefutable evidence of a bounty system just before the 2011–12 playoffs.

A league investigation revealed that Williams began the bounty system soon after he arrived in New Orleans, after Payton charged him to make the Saints&#x27; defense &quot;nasty.&quot; Players usually earned $1,000 for &quot;cart-offs&quot; and $1,500 for &quot;knockouts&quot; during the regular season (though payments were known to triple during the playoffs), though they were encouraged to put their winnings back into the pot in order to raise the stakes as the season went on. The investigation also found that Payton tried to cover up the scheme, and that linebackers coach Joe Vitt, whom Payton had assigned to monitor Williams (the two reportedly did not get along), knew about the broad lines of the scheme and did nothing.

Soon after the investigation came to light, several former players and coaches with the Bills and Redskins claimed that Williams operated similar systems while he was with them. Former NFL coach and current NBC Sports analyst Tony Dungy said that he was certain Williams operated a similar system with the Oilers/Titans as well. However, several players, coaches and team executives who were with Williams in Houston/Tennessee, Buffalo, and Washington have denied that Williams ever ran a bounty system.

Williams was summoned to NFL headquarters after the investigation concluded in mid-February. He initially denied any involvement, but recanted and admitted everything in a meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. He issued a statement apologizing for his role, saying that he had known it was wrong from the start. On March 21, 2012, the NFL suspended Williams indefinitely for &quot;conduct detrimental&quot; to the league, effective that day. In a statement, the NFL said that its investigation had found that Williams not only administered the bounty program and occasionally contributed some of his own money to the bounty pool, but also lied to league investigators about his role. Consequently, the suspension would run until the end of the 2012 season at the earliest. When Williams applied for reinstatement, Goodell considered how much Williams cooperated with the NFL in its continuing investigation; Goodell also expected Williams to participate in league efforts to eliminate bounty systems altogether. The NFL continued to investigate allegations that Williams ran a bounty program in Washington.

Williams apologized again after he learned of his punishment, and said he hoped to return to coaching in the future. However, Fisher said that neither he nor the Rams knew about the bounty program, and he would have not have hired Williams had he known that Williams might be facing a year&#x27;s suspension.

On April 5, documentary filmmaker Sean Pamphilon released audio of a meeting Williams held with his defense before their 2012 divisional playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers. In a profanity-laced speech, Williams instructed his defense to target several 49ers players. He ordered his men to try to knock out running back Kendall Hunter, even if it meant hitting him out of bounds. He specifically directed them to try to tear wide receiver Michael Crabtree&#x27;s ACL, and to go after wide receiver Kyle Williams specifically because he had a history of concussions. Pamphilon, who was doing a documentary on the media&#x27;s effect on football from Pee-Wee all the way to the NFL, released the audio to Yahoo! Sports because he was sickened by what he heard.

On December 12, the Associated Press reported that, according to a transcript of the bounty appeal hearing, Williams had testified that he had wanted to shut down the system after the league began investigating, but was overruled by Saints linebackers coach Joe Vitt. Vitt, however, denied the claims.

===St. Louis Rams===
On February 3, 2012, Williams was formally introduced as the Rams&#x27; new defensive coordinator. A little over a month later, on March 21, Williams was suspended indefinitely for his role in the Saints bounty scandal, and was fired on January 2, 2013, without ever working a day for the Rams.

===Tennessee Titans===
On February 7, 2013, Williams was reinstated by the NFL and officially hired by the Tennessee Titans as a senior assistant defensive coach. In the official statement released by the league, commissioner Roger Goodell cited Williams&#x27; acceptance of responsibility for his role in the bounty program and pledge to never be involved in another such &quot;pay for performance&quot; system as the main reasons for Williams&#x27; reinstatement after just one year.

===Return to St. Louis / Los Angeles Rams===
Williams was hired as defensive coordinator for the Rams on February 12, 2014.

He would return to New Orleans to face against his former team on November 27, 2016. The Saints would shred Williams&#x27; defense, which gave up 555 yards, in a 49–21 win over the Rams. Some would see the Saints running up the score as a measure of revenge against Williams for his role in Bountygate.

On December 12, 2016, the Los Angeles Rams fired head coach Jeff Fisher. His coaching staff, along with Williams, was fired at the end of the season.

===Cleveland Browns===
Williams was hired as the defensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns on January 7, 2017.

On October 29, 2018, following head coach Hue Jackson&#x27;s dismissal, Williams was named the Browns interim head coach, while Freddie Kitchens was named interim offensive coordinator. Williams guided the Browns to a 5–3 record, including a credible showing against the Kansas City Chiefs, and was responsible for the emergence of Baker Mayfield as the team&#x27;s quarterback. There was growing support for Williams to take over as head coach on a permanent basis, although his previous history as Bills head coach and the Bountygate scandal may have hurt his cause.

Following the appointment of offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens as permanent head coach, Williams and several defensive coaching assistants were let go by the Browns. With a 0.625 winning percentage in eight games as coach, he was the first head coach since Marty Schottenheimer in 1988 to leave Cleveland with a winning record as coach.

===New York Jets===
On January 16, 2019, Williams was hired as the defensive coordinator for the New York Jets under new head coach Adam Gase. While the Jets offense struggled, Williams led the Jets to seventh in the NFL in overall defense including second against the run.

On December 7, 2020, Williams was fired from the Jets following a 31–28 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders. The firing came after Williams called a controversial zero blitz on a Hail Mary play in an attempt to sack Derek Carr. However, Carr found Henry Ruggs open, beating corner Lamar Jackson for a game-winning touchdown with five seconds left, thus dropping the Jets to 0–12.

==Personal life==
Williams has been married twice. He has three children, two sons and a daughter, from his first marriage.

<text>The southern frogs form the Leptodactylidae, a name that comes from Greek meaning a bird or other animal having slender toes. They are a diverse family of frogs that most likely diverged from other hyloids during the Cretaceous. The family has undergone major taxonomic revisions in recent years, including the reclassification of the former subfamily Eleutherodactylinae into its own family the Eleutherodactylidae; the Leptodactylidae now number 206 species in 13 genera distributed throughout Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. The family includes terrestrial, burrowing, aquatic, and arboreal members, inhabiting a wide range of habitats.

Several of the genera within the Leptodactylidae lay their eggs in foam nests. These can be in crevices, on the surface of water, or on forest floors. These foam nests are some of the most varied among frogs. When eggs hatch in nests on the forest floor, the tadpoles remain within the nest, without eating, until metamorphosis.

== Classification ==

As of December 2019, the Amphibian Species of the World classifies the following genera in the family Leptodactylidae:
* Subfamily Leiuperinae (90 species)
** &quot;Edalorhina&quot; 
** &quot;Engystomops&quot; 
** &quot;Physalaemus&quot; 
** &quot;Pleurodema&quot; 
** &quot;Pseudopaludicola&quot; 
* Subfamily Leptodactylinae (96 species)
** &quot;Adenomera&quot; 
** &quot;Hydrolaetare&quot; 
** &quot;Leptodactylus&quot; 
** &quot;Lithodytes&quot; 
* Subfamily Paratelmatobiinae (13 species)
** &quot;Crossodactylodes&quot; 
** &quot;Paratelmatobius&quot; 
** &quot;Rupirana&quot; 
** &quot;Scythrophrys&quot; 
* Incertae sedis
** &quot;Leptodactylus&quot; &quot;ochraceus&quot;

<text>Norval Eugene Turner (born May 17, 1952) is an American football coach who is a senior advisor for the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). An offensive assistant for the majority of his coaching career, Turner was the Dallas Cowboys&#x27; offensive coordinator during their consecutive Super Bowl victories in Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII.

In addition to his tenure as an assistant coach, Turner was head coach of the Washington Redskins from 1994 to 2000, the Oakland Raiders from 2004 to 2005, and the San Diego Chargers from 2007 to 2012. Turner compiled 118 wins during his head coaching tenure, which are the most for an NFL head coach with a losing record. He is also the only NFL head coach with at least 100 wins to have an overall losing record.

==Early life==
Turner was born on May 17, 1952, at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Turner played high school football at Alhambra High School in Martinez, California. A quarterback and safety, he graduated from Alhambra in 1970 and then attended the University of Oregon in Eugene, where he was a back-up quarterback to future hall of famer Dan Fouts, then was a starter in 1973 and 1974.

==Coaching career==
After serving as a graduate assistant coach at Oregon in 1975, Turner was an assistant coach for the USC Trojans in 1976, hired by head coach John Robinson, also an Oregon alumnus from California. He stayed with the Trojans for nine seasons, then rejoined Robinson in the NFL with the Los Angeles Rams in 1985. Turner was an assistant with the Rams for six seasons, through 1990.

===Dallas Cowboys===
Turner was the offensive coordinator with the Dallas Cowboys on Jimmy Johnson&#x27;s staff when Dallas won back-to-back Super Bowls in 1992 and 1993, beating the Buffalo Bills twice. Turner got much of the credit for not only their success, but for helping shape quarterback Troy Aikman into a Hall of Fame player. Upon arriving in Dallas, Turner took over an offense that was dead last in the NFL in total yards averaging 255.1 yds/gm and scoring 15.2 pts/gm, his impact was immediate. In 1991 the offense jumped to 9th in total yds with 318.8/gm and scoring 21.4/gm, and 4th in 1992 (350.4 yds/gm, 25.6 pts/gm) and 4th in 1993 (350.9 yds/gm, 23.5 pts/gm). Emmitt Smith led the NFL in rushing all 3 years under Norv Turner, and was the MVP of Super Bowl XXVIII. No team in the Super Bowl era had won with the leading rusher before Emmitt Smith under Turner in 1992 and 1993. The Dallas Cowboys had a record of 21–1 in the regular season and 5–0 in the postseason when Emmitt Smith ran for 100+ yards in a game under Turner&#x27;s guidance of the offense from 1991 to 1993, usually gaining the lead early with big plays from Aikman to Michael Irvin and Jay Novacek then finishing off drives with Smith and their overpowering front line. Troy Aikman had a record of 7–18 as a starter before Turner&#x27;s arrival, then 31–11 in the regular season and 6–0 as a starter in the post season winning Super Bowl XXVII MVP. Michael Irvin never finished lower than 2nd in the NFL in receiving yards under Turner. The Cowboys&#x27; record was 42–13 with 3 playoff appearances, winning 2 NFC East Division Titles (1992, 1993), 2 NFC Championships (1992, 1993), 3 Rushing Titles (1991–1993 Emmitt Smith), 1 League MVP (1993 Emmitt Smith), and 2 Super Bowls (XXVII, XXVIII), in Turner&#x27;s years in Dallas.

===Washington Redskins===
In 1994, following his success with the Cowboys, Turner was hired as the head coach of the Washington Redskins. In seven seasons with the Redskins, he went 49–59–1. In 1996 Turner led the Redskins to a 7–1 start but finished the season 9–7. They made the playoffs only once, in 1999, where they lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the second round. He was released during the 2000 season of the Washington Redskins on December 4, 2000, following a 9–7 loss to the New York Giants where this dropped them to 7–6 on the year despite starting off with a 6–2 record. This left Turner with the distinction of being the rare NFL head coach in the post-merger era to be fired midway through a season with a winning record (Ron Meyer of New England in 1984 was another). Turner was replaced for the final 3 regular season games by interim head coach Terry Robiskie, the team finished 8–8 and missed the postseason. Following his tenure with the Redskins, Turner went on to serve as offensive coordinator for the San Diego Chargers in 2001 and for the Miami Dolphins in 2002 and 2003.

===Oakland Raiders===
When the Oakland Raiders fired head coach Bill Callahan following the 2003 season, owner Al Davis hired Turner to replace him. Turner went 5–11 in 2004, followed by a 4–12 record in 2005, and was fired on January 3, 2006. During Turner&#x27;s two years with the Raiders, he managed only one win in intra-division games (25–24 over the host Denver Broncos on November 28, 2004).

===San Francisco 49ers===
On January 17, 2006, Turner was named offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers, a reversal of roles of sorts: former 49ers head coach Mike Nolan served as Turner&#x27;s defensive coordinator from 1997 to 1999 with the Washington Redskins.

===San Diego Chargers===
On February 19, 2007, Turner was hired to coach the San Diego Chargers. Though he had been a finalist to assume the same position with the Dallas Cowboys, a team for which he had been the offensive coordinator during the first two of three championship seasons in the 1990s, he eventually lost out to Wade Phillips, defensive coordinator of the Chargers at the end of the 2006 season. With a then-career coaching record of 24 games under .500, Turner took the reins of an NFL-best 14–2 record squad in the 2006 regular season with San Diego following the firing of Marty Schottenheimer.

Despite promising a strong start to the season and downplaying the effects of a major coaching turnover, Turner began the 2007 NFL season by losing 3 of his first 4 games. Fans chanted &quot;Mar-ty! Mar-ty!&quot; in a nod to Schottenheimer. Subsequently, Turner was thought to be redeeming himself by helping the team to a 41–3 victory over the Denver Broncos on the road, a win against arch-rival Oakland, and a third consecutive win coming out of the bye week against the Houston Texans. The euphoria in San Diego was short-lived, however, after a road loss to the then 2–5 Minnesota Vikings. By midseason, San Diego, a franchise thought to be a serious Super Bowl contender, had not won a single game against a team with a winning record. The first such win came in Week 10, when the team upset the Indianapolis Colts. This win was followed by another road loss against the Jacksonville Jaguars. After losing to yet another winning team, running back LaDainian Tomlinson called a players only meeting to discuss the season and the coaching changes. Following this, the Chargers won 6 straight regular season games, including a come-from-behind, overtime victory versus the Tennessee Titans. The next week, the Chargers managed to clinch their second straight AFC West Division title by beating the Detroit Lions in a lopsided game at home. The win against the Broncos on Monday Night Football gave Norv Turner 10 wins on the season – matching his best regular season record as a head coach.

Turner led the Chargers to their first playoff victory since 1994 with a victory over the Tennessee Titans, followed by a second playoff win over the Indianapolis Colts. The Chargers lost the AFC Championship Game to the New England Patriots, 21–12.

In the 2008 season, he led the team to an improbable comeback in the AFC West starting the season at 4–8 but winning the final four games to finish ahead of the Denver Broncos, who lost their final three games. His Chargers beat the Indianapolis Colts for the second year in a row in the playoffs, but fell short to the eventual Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round game where his star running back LaDainian Tomlinson was out with a groin injury.

Turner&#x27;s third season in 2009 saw the Chargers continue their trend of a weak start to the season followed by a strong finish. After needing a last-minute rally to beat the Oakland Raiders in the opening week, the Chargers lost 3 of their next four games. The last loss in this stretch was at home to Denver, leaving San Diego at 2–3 and chasing the 6–0 Broncos. After easily defeating divisional opponents Kansas City and Oakland, the Chargers faced a daunting stretch that included games against the Giants, Eagles, Cowboys, and Bengals, plus traveling to Denver. Turner&#x27;s team swept through them all, winning nine straight games while the Broncos entered into a midseason slump. After the ninth consecutive win, a 27–24 victory against Cincinnati on December 20, San Diego captured their third straight divisional title under Turner. After a blowout win at Tennessee and a last minute victory vs. Washington, they extended their regular season win streak to 11 games, tying a franchise record from 1961. With a 13–3 record, San Diego claimed the 2nd seed in the AFC playoffs and a first round bye. The Chargers were eliminated from the playoffs in their first playoff game of 2010 with a 17–14 home upset against the New York Jets.

On January 19, 2010, Turner signed a three-year contract extension through 2013. The Chargers started the 2010 season with a 2–3 record for the fourth consecutive year, before dropping to 2–5. On November 28, 2010, Turner recorded his 100th win as an NFL head coach. The Chargers missed the playoffs, finishing with a 9–7 record.

On September 11, 2011, Turner recorded his 100th regular season win as an NFL head coach with a 24–17 opening game victory at home, over the Vikings. He proceeded to coach the team to a 4–1 record before the team began a six-game losing streak, their longest such streak since 2001. San Diego finished with an 8–8 record and again missed the playoffs.

The Chargers started 3–1 in 2012 for the second straight season. They then lost two games in a row which they led by double digits in the second half, including a 35–24 loss to the Denver Broncos which San Diego led 24–0 at halftime. They lost a third such game after leading in the second half 13–3 with 7:51 remaining before losing 16–13 in overtime to the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens faced fourth-and-29 at their own 37 with 1:37 left when running back Ray Rice caught a pass one yard past the line of scrimmage and escaped defenders to run 28 yards for the first down. After being 8–0 under Turner in November from 2009 to 2010, San Diego was 1–7, the second-worst November record in the league since 2011. On December 6, &quot;U-T San Diego&quot; reported that Turner and Chargers general manager A. J. Smith would be fired at the end of the season. However, Chargers president Dean Spanos denied the report, saying that final evaluations would be made at the end of the season. San Diego at 7–9 had its first losing season since 2003, Smith&#x27;s first season as GM. Turner and Smith were both fired by the San Diego Chargers on December 31, 2012. Turner had one year remaining on his contract, and left with a 59–43 record in his six-year stint with the Chargers. He had the support of the players through the end of his tenure, and received a standing ovation in his final meeting with them after being fired. San Diego never made the Super Bowl under Turner despite having what was perceived as one of the league&#x27;s most talented rosters. This failure to win a Super Bowl after replacing the popular Schottenheimer is believed by some to partially cause San Diego fans and citizens distrusting team management and contributing to the team&#x27;s 2017 exit from San Diego. Turner believed the Chargers were the most talented team in the AFC West in his first three seasons, but not in his final three when the team lost talented players. He inherited a team with 11 Pro Bowl players in 2006, but had no players voted to the NFL&#x27;s All-Star game in 2012. During Smith&#x27;s tenure, the Chargers lost players such as LaDainian Tomlinson, Darren Sproles, Michael Turner and Vincent Jackson. Drew Brees, however, was replaced by Philip Rivers in a decision to go with the younger quarterback. The Chargers&#x27; offensive line grew weak in 2012. Quarterback Philip Rivers was frequently forced to scramble and was sacked 49 times, contributing to his 22 turnovers — 47 over the previous two seasons.

With losing records with the Redskins and Raiders, and a winning record with the Chargers, Turner coached more games than any other coach in NFL history who has a losing overall record.

===Cleveland Browns===

On January 17, 2013, Turner was hired as offensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns. He was hired by new head coach Rob Chudzinski, whom Turner had previously on his staff with the Chargers. He replaced former coordinator Brad Childress.

===Minnesota Vikings===
On January 18, 2014, Turner was hired by the Minnesota Vikings as the offensive coordinator. On November 2, 2016, Turner unexpectedly resigned from his position as the Minnesota Vikings&#x27; offensive coordinator. The Vikings had lost their last two games at the time of his resignation after starting the season with five consecutive victories.

===Carolina Panthers===
He was hired as the Carolina Panthers offensive coordinator on January 11, 2018. Following head coach Ron Rivera&#x27;s dismissal in December 2019, Turner was moved to the special assistant to the head coach.

===Las Vegas Raiders===
On November 5, 2024, Turner was hired by the Las Vegas Raiders as a senior advisor under head coach Antonio Pierce.

==Personal life==
Turner and his wife Nancy have three children: Scott, who is the passing game coordinator for the Las Vegas Raiders; actress and filmmaker Stephanie; and Drew.

<text>A food truck is a large motorized vehicle (such as a van or multi-stop truck) or trailer equipped to store, transport, cook, prepare, serve and/or sell food.

Some food trucks, such as ice cream trucks, sell frozen or prepackaged food, but many have on-board kitchens and prepare food from scratch, or they reheat food that was previously prepared in a brick and mortar commercial kitchen. Sandwiches, hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken, tacos, pizza, french fries and other typical fast food and finger food staples are common food truck fare, though since the pop-up restaurant phenomenon of the 2010s, food trucks specializing in a wide variety of gourmet, specialty, global, regional, and fusion cuisines have seen growing popularity. Food trucks often also sell or fully specialize in beverages such as soft drink, juice, coffee, tea, and water, as well as treats such as ice cream, pastries, and fried dough.

Historical predecessors of food trucks were horse-drawn chuckwagons and lunch wagons of the 19th century. By the early-to-mid-20th century, trucks and vans were being used both as mobile canteens in the military and as &quot;roach coaches&quot; that traveled to worksites and primarily catered to blue-collar workers. Into the 21st century, economic and cultural shifts surrounding the foodservice industry led to a considerable rise in popularity among customers and food truck operation as a career. Though food trucks primarily developed in the United States, United Kingdom, and France, they have become increasingly popular and more available in other parts of Europe and the Americas, as well as Asia and Oceania.

Food trucks, along with food booths and food carts, are major components of the street food industry that serves an estimated 2.5 billion people daily.

==History==


===United States===
In the United States, the Texas chuckwagon is a precursor to the American food truck. In the later 19th century, herding cattle from the Southwest to markets in the North and East kept cowhands on the trail for months at a time. In 1866, the &quot;father of the Texas Panhandle&quot;, cattle rancher Charles Goodnight, fitted a sturdy old United States Army wagon with interior shelving and drawers, and stocked it with kitchenware, food, and medical supplies. Food consisted of dried beans, coffee, cornmeal, greasy cloth-wrapped bacon, salt pork, dried or salted beef, and other easy-to-preserve foodstuffs. The wagon was also stocked with a water barrel and a sling to kindle wood to heat and cook food.

Another early relative of the modern food truck is the &quot;lunch wagon&quot;, horse-drawn street cars whose night version was known as the &quot;night owl&quot;, as conceived by food vendor Walter Scott in 1872 as a &quot;kitchen on wheels&quot;. Scott cut windows in a small covered wagon, parked it in front of a newspaper office in Providence, Rhode Island, and sold sandwiches, pies, and coffee to pressmen and journalists. By the 1880s, former lunch counter worker Thomas H. Buckley was manufacturing lunch wagons in Worcester, Massachusetts. He introduced various models, like the Owl and the White House Cafe, with features that included sinks, refrigerators, cooking stoves, colored windows, and other ornamentation.

In 1936 the Food Code spread its regulatory umbrella to include food trucks as a result of their introduction to society.

Later versions of the food truck were mobile canteens, which were created in the late 1950s. These mobile canteens were authorized by the U.S. Army and operated on stateside Army bases.

Mobile food trucks, nicknamed &quot;roach coaches&quot; or &quot;gut trucks&quot;, have been around for years, serving construction sites, factories, and other blue-collar locations. In big cities, the food truck traditionally provided a means for the on-the-go person to grab a quick bite at a low cost. Food trucks are still sought out for nostalgia from this era.

During the 2010s the economic changes caused by the Great Recession, technological factors, and street food being &quot;hip&quot; or &quot;chic&quot; have combined to increase the number of food trucks in the United States. The construction business was drying up, leading to a surplus of food trucks, and chefs from high-end restaurants were being laid off. For experienced cooks suddenly without work, the food truck seemed to be a clear choice and a smaller financial investment than a brick-and-mortar restaurant. Once more commonplace in American coastal big cities like New York City and Los Angeles, gourmet food trucks are now to be found as well in suburbs and small towns. Food trucks are also hired for special events, like weddings, movie shoots, and corporate gatherings, and also to carry advertising promoting companies and brands.

==Gourmet trucks==

In 2011, &quot;USA Today&quot; noted that food trucks selling pricier food were gaining popularity across the United States, contrary to a common perception that food trucks are typically run-down and found at construction sites. In 2009, &quot;New York&quot; magazine noted that the food truck had &quot;largely transcended its roach-coach classification and is now a respectable venue for aspiring chefs to launch careers.&quot; These gourmet trucks&#x27; menus run the gamut of ethnic and fusion cuisine. Often focusing on limited but creative dishes at reasonable prices, they offer customers a chance to experience food they otherwise may not. Finding a niche seems to be a path to success for most trucks. While one truck may specialize in outlandish burgers, another may serve only lobster rolls.

Gourmet food trucks can also offer a unique dining experience. With the rise of millennial diners, experiential dining has become more mainstream, driving restaurant and food truck owners to create a unique experience for their customers. As food trucks are mobile, this provides an advantage to gourmet trucks to take their experience anywhere they may please.

== Food truck rallies ==
Food truck rallies and food truck parks are also growing in popularity in the United States, wherein multiple food trucks gather in one location, usually in cooperation with each other, with the goal of attracting business through the variety offered. On August 31, 2013, Tampa, Florida hosted the world&#x27;s largest food truck rally, with 99 trucks attending. The Tampa Rally broke its own record by bringing together 121 food trucks in 2014. The Chicago Food Truck Festival hosts over 40 trucks each year with 60,000 guests participating over two days in Chicago. Food truck parks, offering permanent locations, are found in urban and suburban areas across the US.

==Business and economics==

Food trucks are subject to the same range of concerns as other foodservice businesses. There are a variety of permits to obtain, and a health code to observe. Equipment, labor and fuel costs are a significant part of the overhead.

Legal definitions and requirements for food trucks vary widely by country and locality. For example, in Toronto, some of the requirements include business and liability insurance, a Commercial Vehicle Operator&#x27;s Registration for the truck, permits for each municipality being operated in (downtown, various suburbs), a food handler certificate, appropriate driver&#x27;s licenses for drivers, assistant&#x27;s licenses for assistants, and a health inspection.

As the rising number and popularity of food trucks push them into the food mainstream, region by region, problems with local legislators and police reacting to new situations, and pushback from brick-and-mortar restaurants fearing competition, are amongst issues having to be worked through, creating significant business uncertainty. Chicago long held the distinction of being the only city in the United States that did not allow food trucks to cook on board, which required trucks to prepare food in a commercial kitchen, then wrap and label the food and load it into a food warmer. In 2012, under pressure from food truck owners and supporters, including the University of Chicago Law School, regulations were changed to allow on-board cooking, however, controversially, food trucks are required to park 200 feet away from any restaurant, which virtually eliminates busy downtown locations (an example of pushback, restaurant owners lobbying city government).

In the US, specialized food truck outfitters offer comprehensive start-up services that can include concept development, training, and business support, in addition to outfitted trucks. Often, however, it makes more sense for a new operator to lease a truck. In the US, food trucks are a $1.2 billion industry. By 2017, the US food truck industry had surpassed $2.7 billion.

Expansion from a single truck to fleets and retail outlets has proven possible. Los Angeles-based gourmet ice cream maker Coolhaus grew from a single truck in 2009 to 11 trucks and carts, two storefronts, and over 2,500 retail store partners by September 2014.

The libertarian &quot;Reason&quot; magazine states that in US, cities, food trucks are subject to protectionist regulations designed to prevent them from competing with brick and mortar restaurants. For example, in Chicago, a regulation prevents food trucks &quot;...from selling food within 200 feet of brick-and-mortar restaurants and, hence, prohibit them from operating throughout the city&#x27;s downtown area&quot;, which critics have called an &quot;anti-competitive&quot; rule for food truck operators.

The popularity of food trucks lead to the creation of associations that protect and support their business rights, such as the Philadelphia Mobile Food Association.

Tracking food trucks has been made easy with social media like Facebook and Twitter, where a favorite gourmet truck can be located at any moment, with updates on specials, new menu items and location changes.

==Food safety concerns==
Food trucks have unique health risks compared to regular restaurants when it comes to food safety and the prevention of foodborne illness. Most food trucks do not have access to adequate clean and hot water necessary to wash hands or to rinse off vegetables, as required by most health codes or regulations.

In June 2017, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reviewed the 2016 city health records and found that food trucks had been cited for violations 200 times, with half of the violations being minor in nature and the other half being serious violations. When compared to fixed location restaurants, the city closed nine of the 96 licensed food trucks in 2016 and closed only two out of 100 restaurants. A majority of the serious violations were related to the lack of water and hand washing.

== By country ==
===Americas===
====Brazil====
In Brazil, food trucks started with trucks that served food during carnival time and after soccer games, sporting events, and concerts. However, when trucks began to serve gourmet food (with higher prices), food trucks were no longer associated with popular food, and it became trendy to eat street food from food trucks. Nowadays they are all commonly found across Brazil, at practically any place where there is potential demand for regular meals or snacks.

====Canada====

In Canada, food trucks, also known as &quot;cantines&quot; (French for cafeteria) in Quebec, are present across the country, serving a wide variety of cuisines.

====Mexico====
Although street food in Mexico is unregulated, food trucks are becoming increasingly popular as of 2013 and owners have created an association to pursue the professionalization and expansion of this commercial sector. In addition to the food trucks catering on the streets, there are regular bazaars organized to introduce their products to the consumers.

In response to this popularity, the local authorities have issued a series of special regulations to incorporate them into legal schemes that would help to regulate this form of commerce. As a new food truck business model emerged, some local bodybuilders begin to make food trucks from new vehicles from major car-makers.

===Asia-Pacific===
====Australia====

Food trucks are available across Australia, and are covered as a popular trend in the media. An Australian national online directory, &quot;Where The Truck&quot;, listed around 5,000 food trucks in 2020.
====Hong Kong====
In Hong Kong, food trucks started to hit the streets in February 2017.

====Japan====

In Japan, there are bento (box lunch), ramen, fried chicken, fried bread, pizza, crêpe, and ice cream &quot;kitchen cars&quot; (キッチンカー, &quot;kichinkā&quot;).

====South Korea====
The national government legalized food trucks in South Korea in September 2014 and numbers have continued to climb steadily since then. Many young people are trying to create food trucks, and a wider range of products is becoming available. However, it is not possible to operate food trucks everywhere. In the case of Korea, there is only a limited number of places designated by each local government.
===Europe===

====Belgium====
Chip trucks have long been a staple of the Belgian countryside. The Belgian Food Truck Association is lobbying to legalize food trucks on the street. Brussels was the first European city to propose locations for food trucks at football matches. Belgium also holds the Brussels Food Truck Festival, the largest of its kind in Europe, every year in May.

====France====
While it is commonly admitted that the first French food trucks (&quot;camions-restaurants&quot; in French even though the word &quot;foodtruck&quot; is used more frequently) appeared in Marseille in the 1960&#x27;s with trucks selling pizzas, it is proved that it actually appeared for the first time in Paris back in 1924. At the time, Alfred Morain, the &quot;Préfet&quot; (chief of police) of the Seine region decided to develop and spread what they called then &quot;friteries automobiles&quot; (automobile French fries shop, which were then called &quot;Auto-Morain&quot;). This political measure took place in a context of economical crisis following First World War, which led people to lack essential products, including food. Most of the time, these shops sold 185 grams of French fries and fried fish for &quot;1 franc 25&quot; (1,26€ ,1,38$ in 2023). It also was the first time that fish was sold along with fries in France but then again, this took place in a context of promotion of the French fishing business. The arrival of this kind of shops did not go unnoticed: many press articles and political staging took place. In 1925, &quot;Le Petit Inventeur&quot;, a newspaper, commented on the success of the &quot;operation&quot; and on the &quot;very interesting prices [of the products]&quot;, and, in 1926, Mario (Marius) Roustan, who was the State Under-Secretary dedicated to &quot;public works, ports, merchant marine and fishing&quot; (Sous-Secrétaire d’Etat aux travaux publics, chargé des ports, de la marine marchande et des pêches,), publicised his visit of a &quot;rolling French fries shop&quot; (friterie roulante), which was called &quot;Friterie Auguste&quot; and sold fries and fried fish in Paris.

Nowadays, foodtrucks are very popular in France. Their owners need to obtain permission from four separate government agencies, including the Prefecture of Police. Most of the trucks offer tacos, hamburgers, pizza. Certain regions have specific specialities, such as galette-saucisse (sausage within a buckwheat crepe) in Brittany or fries in the north.

====Ireland====

Compared to other countries, food trucks in Ireland are a relatively new addition to the Irish food industry. All food trucks in Ireland must be registered with the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are inspected by Environmental Health Officers (EHO).

====United Kingdom====
With the advent of motorised transport during World War II, food trucks came into common use. Mobile canteens were used in almost all theatres of war to boost morale and provide food as a result of the successful tea lady experiment.

Food trucks today are sometimes known as snack vans or burger vans. They can be found on many major trunk roads at the side of the road or in areas that have a large pedestrian population, such as town centres and events such as village fêtes. These vans can specialise in many different food types, such as doughnuts, hamburgers, chili and chips, as well as ethnic food. Some people prefer to stop at snack vans when travelling, due to the low price, rather than stopping at a motorway service station where prices can be extremely high.

With the British street food industry growing 20% year-on-year, the increase in popularity of having a mobile food van at events has been substantial.

<text>Israel Aharoni (; 1882 - 1946) was a zoologist in Ottoman and British Palestine widely known as the &quot;first Hebrew zoologist.&quot; 

Aharoni is best known for collecting a litter of Syrian hamsters on an expedition to Aleppo, Syria. The hamsters were bred as laboratory animals in Jerusalem, but some escaped through a hole in the floor. The majority of hamsters in Israel today are thus said to be descended from this one litter.

==Biography==
Israel Aharoni was born in Vidzy, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day Belarus). His father, Avraham Yossef Aharonovich, was the Rosh yeshiva of Vidzy and died before his son Israel was born. Israel lost his mother as well when he was two years old.
Being an orphan, he lived with his grandmother and studied at a Cheder and later on at the Telshe yeshiva.
At the age of 13, Israel ran away from his home to Prague, where he attended school and later on continued to learn zoology at Charles University.

He immigrated to Palestine in 1901, which was then under Turkish rule. His early zoological expeditions took place under the protection of the local Sultan, for whom he obtained butterfly specimens. Many of his collected specimens can still be viewed at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

==Zoology career==

Aharoni discovered 30 previously unknown species of animals, insects and birds, and is credited with giving them Hebrew names.
In 1930, Aharoni set off to look for Syrian hamsters at the request of his colleague Saul Adler, a parasitologist who was looking for an easily breedable alternative to the Chinese hamster for research on the disease Leishmaniasis. Syrian hamsters had been discovered and named by George Robert Waterhouse in 1839 but had not been sighted since. Together with a Syrian guide named &quot;Georgius Khalil Tah&#x27;an&quot;, Aharoni managed to discover a nest containing a female and eleven young in the Aleppo region. However, cannibalism of one of the litter by the mother, and the subsequent death of the mother, meant that Aharoni had to hand-rear the pups during the journey back. The four that made it were bred successfully and used extensively in laboratories, before being introduced to the pet market in the 1940s.

<doc id="1326397" wikidata="Q6847828" url="?curid=1326397" title="Mike Martz">
<text>Michael Martz (born May 13, 1951) is an American football coach. Best known for his coaching tenure with the St. Louis Rams of the National Football League (NFL), he served as the offensive coordinator for the Rams&#x27; Greatest Show on Turf offense in 1999 that led the franchise to its first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXIV. Martz subsequently served as the head coach of the Rams from 2000 to 2005, where his teams reached the playoffs four times, won two division titles, and achieved a franchise-best 14–2 record in 2001 en route to an appearance in Super Bowl XXXVI.

==Early career==
Martz played tight end at San Diego Mesa College, University of California, Santa Barbara, and Fresno State University and graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from Washington University in St. Louis in 1972. The following year his coaching career began at Bullard High School in Fresno, California. From 1974 to 1991, he was an assistant coach at seven colleges and universities, including two stints as offensive coordinator at Arizona State University.

In 1992, Martz was hired as quarterback coach for the Los Angeles Rams and held that post through 1994. In 1995, when the team moved to St. Louis, he served as wide receivers coach in 1995–96. Under his teaching, Isaac Bruce exploded onto the NFL scene, going from 21 receptions in 1994 to 119 and 1,781 yards in 1995 and being voted to his first Pro Bowl in 1996.

Martz left the Rams in 1997 to become quarterback coach at the Washington Redskins and helped develop Trent Green, who signed to be Rams QB in 1999, the season Martz was hired to be the offensive coordinator.

==NFL coaching career==
===St. Louis Rams===
In 1999, Martz returned to the Rams as Dick Vermeil&#x27;s offensive coordinator. During the season, Martz&#x27;s number one ranked offense scored 526 points, the fourth highest in NFL history, en route to returning the Rams to the playoffs after a 10-year absence and winning Super Bowl XXXIV Regarding Martz&#x27;s impact on the season, Vermeil stated, &quot;I can&#x27;t think, in my history of coaching, of any assistant who came into an NFL franchise and made the immediate impact that Mike Martz did.&quot; Vermeil further added, &quot;Kurt Warner came off the street, and he made him NFL player of the year...I have great respect for him, and I think he has great respect for me. We took a team to the Super Bowl. Without him we don&#x27;t go.&quot;

Quarterback Marc Bulger said about Martz, &quot;He was by far the smartest football mind I&#x27;ve ever been around. The things he was teaching
was so far ahead of what others were teaching.&quot;

====Head coach====
Vermeil retired on February 2, 2000 (although he soon returned to coach the Kansas City Chiefs), and Martz was promoted to the head coaching position that same day. He led the Rams to a 10–6 regular season record, but they lost in the 1st round of the playoffs to the New Orleans Saints 31–28.

2001 saw the Rams cruise to a 14–2 record (with Martz&#x27;s signature, fast-paced, quick-striking offense—nicknamed &quot;the Greatest Show on Turf&quot; by the media—quarterbacked by two-time league MVP Kurt Warner) and the NFC West title. Martz&#x27;s Rams went on to win the NFC Championship against the Philadelphia Eagles to set up a matchup in Super Bowl XXXVI against the New England Patriots. In a game where they were favored by two touchdowns, the Rams lost in a 20-17 upset. Martz was questioned for sticking with a passing attack despite New England sending in extra defensive backs for plays that had them &quot;latch on to the receivers and hang on&quot;; star running back Marshall Faulk ran for just 17 carries for 76 yards while Warner threw two interceptions (one returned for a touchdown). In 2002, the Rams had a see-saw season in which Warner played despite injuries to his throwing hand that saw him commit an unusually high number of turnovers. Faulk was no longer the factor he had been in previous years—although many critics blamed this on Martz&#x27;s tendency to emphasize pass plays at the expense of running plays. By this point, Martz clashed with team president of football operations Jay Zygmunt over personnel decisions.

In 2003, Marc Bulger&#x27;s first full year as a starter, the Rams fielded a much-improved defense under defensive coordinator Lovie Smith and led the NFL in forced turnovers, and they posted a 12–4 regular season record and made the playoffs. However, the Rams lost at home in the NFC divisional playoffs to the Carolina Panthers in a game that would have put them in the NFC title game. In that game, the Rams had the ball on the Panthers&#x27; 15-yard line with 42 seconds remaining and trailing by three points. Rather than go for the win in regulation, Martz made the controversial decision to run out the clock and settle for a game-tying field goal and overtime. The decision proved costly for the Rams as they lost in double overtime.

In 2004, the Rams got off to a slow start and Martz&#x27;s popularity with the fans began to wane; the &quot;online community&quot; was particularly hostile. Despite the early struggles, a late-season rally combined with a weak NFC West allowed the Rams to sneak into the playoffs as a wild-card with an 8–8 record. They had to overcome an unusual number of injuries, but still managed to beat the Seattle Seahawks in the first round of the playoffs—making NFL history by becoming the first team with a non-winning (regular season) record to win a postseason game. The Rams would go on to lose to the Falcons in the divisional round. The loss of defensive coordinator Lovie Smith, who left to become head coach of the Chicago Bears—and took two of his assistant coaches with him—impacted the team&#x27;s performance on the field. Draft picks overseen by Martz such as Trung Canidate not panning out did little to help matters.

On October 10, 2005, Martz took a leave of absence from the Rams to treat a persistent bacterial infection in his heart. His assistant head coach, Joe Vitt, became the interim coach for the rest of the season, and offensive coordinator Steve Fairchild chose the offensive plays. Martz told the Rams that after being examined and evaluated by his treating physician (Dr. Victoria Fraser), his illness would prevent him from performing his duties. Martz immediately announced that he would miss the rest of the season.

Martz allegedly had several conflicts with the Rams&#x27; front office over the years, which reportedly came to a climax in 2005, as well. While watching a Rams game on live television while recuperating at home, Team President John Shaw prevented Martz from relaying a play call to Fairchild by phone. Despite being on leave, Martz also periodically appeared in-person at team practices late in the season. Martz was given medical clearance to coach the Rams&#x27; last regular season game, on New Year&#x27;s Day, 2006; however, management refused to let him do so, and fired him the day after that game.

===Detroit Lions===
Martz interviewed for head coaching vacancies in Oakland and New Orleans. After the interview, he withdrew his candidacy for the position in Oakland. After initially rejecting an offer due to financial considerations, on February 8, 2006, Martz accepted an offer from the Detroit Lions to be their offensive coordinator and their quarterbacks coach.

In 2006, his first season, the passing game improved considerably, ranking 7th overall behind quarterback Jon Kitna, who had his first 4,000-yard season at age 34. Detroit lost its first five games with Martz and finished 3–13 in his first season as coordinator. Though the offense obviously had its woes, Martz wasn&#x27;t blamed for very much of the team&#x27;s issues, as the defense was also bad and there were various injury and personnel issues.

In 2007, expectations were high despite the previous year&#x27;s disaster, and it appeared Martz&#x27;s system was actually beginning to work. The Lions looked to be playoff contenders, almost in competition with Green Bay for the division title at mid-season when they sat comfortably at 6–2. Though Kitna was still sacked far too much during this span due mostly due to seven step drops and his inability to quickly read defenses, it was still a great improvement from the year before, and sacks aside, Detroit possessed a decent passing game. Shaun McDonald was their leading receiver with 943 yards. However, the team won only one more game that season and finished 7–9. When even players began to complain of Martz&#x27;s pass-happy and unbalanced offense, the Lions fired him in the offseason. However, the following season the Lions plummeted in the offensive rankings, and some players (most notably Kitna) were openly frustrated with the conservative play calling that replaced Martz&#x27; system as the Lions became the first ever 0–16 team after firing Martz.

===San Francisco 49ers===
On January 8, 2008, Martz signed a two-year deal to become the offensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers, who hoped that a fourth offensive coordinator in four years could re-energize the offense (and, most notably, quarterback Alex Smith&#x27;s career).

Smith would injure his shoulder in the preseason, however, and miss the entire 2008 season. Martz lobbied for journeyman J. T. O&#x27;Sullivan to come in as his replacement, but O&#x27;Sullivan and the 49ers offense struggled in the first half of the season. After 49ers head coach Mike Nolan was fired and Mike Singletary was brought in as interim head coach, the team gave Shaun Hill a chance to establish himself as the starting quarterback.

Martz was let go as offensive coordinator after the 49ers named Singletary head coach. Singletary reportedly wanted more of a ball-control, run-oriented offense than Martz is known for crafting. San Francisco ranked 23rd out of 32 teams in points scored, 24th in total yards, 13th in passing yards per game and 22nd in net passing yards per attempt, which represents an improvement over 2007 (when San Francisco ranked dead last in all three categories), but they ranked 26th in rushing yards and last in total turnovers. However, in 2007 the 49ers only turned the ball over one fewer time than in 2008 under Martz.

===Chicago Bears===
On February 1, 2010, Martz was hired by the Chicago Bears as their offensive coordinator. During his first year in Chicago, the Bears offense was 28th in passing and 22nd in rushing despite having no significant injuries as the Bears made the playoffs and fell seven points short of the Super Bowl.

Martz was known for aggressive play-calling, and the calls for a pass-happy offense led to quarterback Jay Cutler getting repeatedly sacked. The issue caused Cutler to curse at Martz on-air in a game against the Minnesota Vikings in 2011. Ironically, offensive statistics revealed the Bears had a more balanced offense that leaned toward the run as they were ranked ninth in the NFL in rushing, ninth in rushing attempts, and 27th in passing attempts.

On January 3, 2012, Martz resigned his position with the Bears. He reportedly departed over philosophical differences with Bears head coach Lovie Smith. Martz&#x27;s final year was marked by a 7–3 start until season-ending injuries to quarterback Cutler and running back Matt Forte. On January 16, he announced his retirement from coaching.

Martz eventually became an analyst for Fox Sports. He interviewed for the Cleveland Browns&#x27; offensive coordinator position after the 2014 season, but did not get the job.

From 2015 to 2018, Martz served as the head coach of the National Team for the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl, which features some of the nation&#x27;s top draft-eligible players. Martz&#x27;s team won in each of his four appearances as head coach.

==Alliance of American Football==
The Alliance of American Football named Martz the head coach of the San Diego Fleet in 2018, making Martz the first person to coach a professional football team in the city of San Diego since Mike McCoy coached the Chargers&#x27; last season there in 2016. The Fleet opened the 2019 AAF season with a 15–6 loss to the San Antonio Commanders. A week later, Martz and the Fleet recorded their first win in a 24–12 victory over the Atlanta Legends.

==Personal life==
Martz married his James Madison High School sweetheart Julie in 1971.

==In popular culture==
Martz was portrayed by actor Chance Kelly in the 2021 film &quot;American Underdog&quot; about Kurt Warner, who played quarterback for Martz between 1999 and 2003.

<doc id="1326400" wikidata="Q6460084" url="?curid=1326400" title="LSWR N15 class">
<text>The LSWR N15 class was a British 2–cylinder 4-6-0 express passenger steam locomotive designed by Robert Urie. The class has a complex build history spanning three sub-classes and ten years of construction from 1918 to 1927. The first batch of the class was constructed for the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), where they hauled heavy express passenger trains to the south coast ports and further west to Exeter. After the Lord Nelsons, they were the second biggest 4-6-0 passenger locomotives on the Southern Railway. They could reach speeds of up to 90 mph (145 km/h).

Following the grouping of railway companies in 1923, the LSWR became part of the Southern Railway (SR) and its publicity department gave the N15 locomotives names associated with Arthurian legend; the class hence becoming known as King Arthurs. The chief mechanical engineer (CME) of the newly formed company, Richard Maunsell, modified the Urie locomotives in the light of operational experience and increased the class strength to 74 locomotives. Maunsell and his Chief Draughtsman James Clayton incorporated several improvements, notably to the steam circuit and valve gear.

The new locomotives were built over several batches at Eastleigh Works and Glasgow, leading to the nicknames of &quot;Eastleigh Arthurs&quot;, &quot;Scotch Arthurs&quot; and &quot;Scotchmen&quot; in service. The class was subjected to smoke deflection experiments in 1926, becoming the first British class of steam locomotive to be fitted with smoke deflectors. Maunsell&#x27;s successor, Oliver Bulleid, attempted to improve performance by altering exhaust arrangements. The locomotives continued operating with British Railways (BR) until the end of 1962. One example, SR N15 class 777 Sir Lamiel, is preserved as part of the National Collection and can be seen on mainline railtours.

==Background==
Robert Urie completed his H15 class mixed-traffic 4-6-0 design in 1913 and the prototype was built in August 1914. It showed a marked improvement in performance over Dugald Drummond&#x27;s LSWR T14 class 4-6-0 when tested on local and express passenger trains. The introduction of ten H15 engines into service coincided with the outbreak of the First World War, which prevented construction of further class members.

Despite the interruption caused by the conflict, Urie anticipated that peacetime increases in passenger traffic would necessitate longer trains from London to the south-west of England. Passenger loadings on the heavy boat trains to the London and South Western Railway&#x27;s (LSWR) ports of Portsmouth, Weymouth and Southampton had been increasing prior to the war, and was beginning to overcome the capabilities of the LSWR&#x27;s passenger locomotive fleet. His response was to produce a modern, standard express passenger design similar to the H15.

==Design and construction==

Trials undertaken in 1914 with the H15 class prototype had demonstrated to Urie that the basic design showed considerable speed potential on the Western section of the LSWR from Basingstoke westwards, and could form the basis of a powerful new class of 4-6-0 express passenger locomotive with larger driving wheels. The LSWR required such a locomotive, which would need to cope with increasing train loads on this long and arduous route to the West Country. The result was the N15 class design, completed by Urie in 1917. It incorporated features from the H15 class, including eight-wheel double bogie tenders with outside plate frames over the wheels and exposed Walschaerts valve gear. High running plates along the boiler were retained for ease of oiling and maintenance.

Despite the similarities, the N15 class represented a refinement of the H15 template. The cylinders were increased in size to in diameter, the largest used on a British steam locomotive at that time. The substantial boiler design was also different from the parallel version used on the H15, and became the first tapered types to be constructed at Eastleigh Works. Contrary to boiler construction practices elsewhere where tapering began near the firebox, it was restricted to the front end of the N15&#x27;s barrel to reduce the diameter of the smokebox, and consequently the weight carried by the front bogie. The design also featured Urie&#x27;s design of narrow-diameter &quot;stovepipe&quot; chimney, a large dome cover on top of the boiler, and his &quot;Eastleigh&quot; superheater.

===&quot;Urie N15s&quot;===

The N15 design was approved by the LSWR management committee, though the order for construction was postponed until wartime control of raw materials was relaxed. Government approval was obtained in mid–1918, and Eastleigh Works began to produce the LSWR&#x27;s first new locomotive class since 1914.

The first locomotives, later known by crewmen as the &quot;Urie N15s&quot;, were built in two ten-engine batches by the LSWR&#x27;s Eastleigh Works between 1918–19 and 1922–23. Of the first batch, the prototype, No. 736 entered service on 31 August 1918, with four more appearing between September 1918 and April 1919. They shared a similar profile to Urie&#x27;s H15 class with the use of flat-sided Drummond-style cabs with gently curving roofs. The double bogie tenders were outwardly similar in appearance to those used on the H15s, although strengthened during construction with extra internal bracing to hold of water. 
A shortage of copper delayed completion of Nos. 741–745, and the last of the batch emerged from Eastleigh in November 1919. After the running-in of Nos. 736–745 and an intensification of the LSWR timetable to the West Country, a second batch of ten was ordered in October 1921. They entered service over the period June 1922 – March 1923, and were numbered in the series 746–755.

At Grouping in January 1923, the LSWR became part of the new Southern Railway, whose chief mechanical engineer (CME) was Richard Maunsell. Maunsell planned to introduce his own designs of express passenger locomotive, one of which was to become the future Lord Nelson class. Despite this, there was a short-term need to maintain existing services that required modification and expansion of Urie&#x27;s N15 design.

===Maunsell&#x27;s &quot;Eastleigh Arthurs&quot;: Drummond rebuilds===
Maunsell&#x27;s projected design of express passenger locomotive was not ready for introduction during the summer timetable of 1925, so a third batch of ten N15s was ordered for construction at Eastleigh. This batch was part of an outstanding LSWR order to rebuild 15 of Drummond&#x27;s unsuccessful 4-cylinder F13, G14 and P14 classes 4-6-0s into 2–cylinder H15 class locomotives. Only the five F13s were converted to H15s; the remaining ten G14 and P14s (Nos. 448–457, renumbered E448–E457) were rebuilt as N15s, implementing modifications to Urie&#x27;s original design.

The modifications are attributed to Maunsell&#x27;s Chief Draughtsman James Clayton, who had transferred to Ashford railway works in 1914 from Derby Works. They were the result of cooperation between the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) and the Great Western Railway (GWR) when Maunsell was seconded to the Railway Executive Committee during the First World War. The aim was to create a series of standard freight and passenger locomotives for use throughout Britain, and meant that Clayton was privy to the latest GWR developments in steam design. These included streamlined steam passages, long-travel valves, the maximisation of power through reduced cylinder sizes and higher boiler pressure.

Maunsell initiated trials with Urie N15 No. 442 in 1924, and proved that better performance could be obtained by altering the steam circuit, valve travel and draughting arrangements. As a result, Clayton reduced the N15 cylinder diameter to and replaced the safety valves with Ross pop valves set to boiler pressure. The Urie boiler was retained, though the Eastleigh superheater was replaced by a Maunsell type with 10 per cent greater superheating surface area. This was supplemented by a larger steam chest and an increased-diameter chimney casting specially designed for the rebuilds. It incorporated a rim and capuchon to control exhaust flow into the atmosphere. Valve events (the timing of valve movements with the piston) were also revised to promote efficient steam usage and the wheels were re-balanced to reduce hammerblow.

When rebuilding was complete, only the numbers, smokebox doors with centre tightening handles and the flat-sided cabs remained of the G14 and P14 classes. The rebuilds retained their distinctive Drummond &quot;watercart&quot; tenders, which were modified with the removal of the complex injector feedwater heating equipment. The &quot;watercart&quot; tenders were of water and coal capacity. The ten rebuilds became the first members of the King Arthur class upon entering service.

===&quot;Scotch Arthurs&quot;===
As the Drummond G14 and P14 4-6-0s were rebuilt to the N15 specification at Eastleigh, a lack of production capacity due to repair and overhaul meant that Maunsell ordered a further batch of 20 locomotives from the North British Locomotive Company in 1924. The company had under-quoted to gain the contract, which meant that production of the batch was rushed. The necessity to maintain an intensive timetable on the Southern Railway&#x27;s Western section prompted an increase of the order to 30 locomotives (Nos. E763–E792). Their construction in Glasgow would gain them the &quot;Scotch Arthurs&quot; nickname in service. They were all delivered to the Southern Railway by October 1925, and featured the front-end refinements used on the Drummond rebuilds.

The North British batch was built to the Southern&#x27;s new composite loading gauge and differed from previous batches in having an Ashford-style cab based upon that used on the N class. Unlike the Drummond cab retained by Nos. 448–457 and E741–E755, the Ashford cab was of an all-steel construction and had a roof that was flush with the cab sides, allowing it to be used on gauge-restricted routes in the east of the network. It was inspired by the standard cab developed in 1904 by R. M. Deeley for the Midland Railway, and was one of a number of Midland features introduced by Clayton to the SECR and subsequently the Southern Railway. The smokebox door was revised to the Ashford pattern, which omitted the use of central tightening handles in favour of clamps around the circumference. The batch was fitted with the Urie-designed, North British-built capacity double-bogie tenders.

===Maunsell&#x27;s &quot;Eastleigh Arthurs&quot;: second batch===

With the &quot;Scotch Arthurs&quot; in service, the Southern Railway had an ample fleet of express passenger locomotives for its Western section routes. As part of a process of fleet standardisation, the Operating Department expressed a desire replace obsolescent locomotives on the Eastern and Central sections with the King Arthur class. In May 1925, a batch of 25 locomotives (Nos. E793–E817) based upon the Scotch Arthurs was ordered for construction at Eastleigh with smaller firebox grates and improved water heating surfaces. After the first 14 (Nos. E793–E806) were built, it was decided to discontinue construction in favour of Maunsell&#x27;s new 4-cylinder Lord Nelson class design in June 1926.

The Operating Department intended to equip Nos. E793–E807 with six-wheel, capacity tenders for use on the former SECR lines of the Eastern section. These were to replace Scotch Arthurs Nos. E763–E772 on boat train duties. This was because the tenders attached to Nos. E763–E772 were better suited to the longer routes of the Western section. The final ten engines (Nos. E808–E817) were for the former LBSCR routes of the Central section, where short turntables restricted tender size to the Ashford variety used on the N class. After the order was changed to the Lord Nelson class design, 14 N class tenders were fitted to Nos. E793–E806 for use the Central section. The high draw-gear (the link between locomotive and tender) of the N class tenders necessitated modification to the frames beneath the cab.

===Naming the locomotives===

When the former Drummond G14 and P14 4-6-0s were rebuilt to Maunsell&#x27;s N15 specification in February 1925, the Southern Railway decided to give names to all express passenger locomotives. Because of the railway&#x27;s association with the West of England, the Public Relations Officer, John Elliot suggested that members of the N15 class should be named after characters and places associated with the legend of King Arthur. When Maunsell was told of the decision to name the locomotives, he replied: &quot;Tell Sir Herbert [Walker] I have no objection, but I warn you, it won&#x27;t make any difference to the working of the engines&quot;. Walker was the General Manager of the Southern Railway, who had told Elliot that Maunsell&#x27;s permission was required. The first G14 to be rebuilt, No. E453, was given the first name and christened &quot;King Arthur&quot;. The Urie locomotives (hitherto referred as N15s rather than King Arthurs) were also given names connected with Arthurian legend and were referred to as &quot;Urie Arthurs&quot;; the Maunsell batches of N15s were nicknamed the &quot;Eastleigh&quot; and &quot;Scotch Arthurs&quot;.

==Operational details==
The N15 class was intended to haul heavy expresses over the long LSWR mainlines between Waterloo, Weymouth, Exeter and Plymouth. Locomotives were changed at before the upgrading of the South Western Mainline in 1922, when fast running through to Exeter was possible. The Southern Railway&#x27;s motive power re-organisation following the Grouping of 1923 saw the class allocated to sheds across the network and used on to cross-country trains. Operations were expanded to more restricted Central and Eastern section mainlines in 1925, and suitably modified class members hauled commuter and heavy boat trains from to and expresses to . In 1931, No. E780 &quot;Sir Persant&quot; hauled the inaugural &quot;Bournemouth Belle&quot; Pullman train from Waterloo to .

In peacetime, the class was occasionally used on fast freights from Southampton Docks, although it was common to see them at the head of freight and troop trains during the Second World War. Ten &quot;Urie Arthurs&quot; were transferred to the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in October 1942, and were based at Heaton shed for use on freight and occasional passenger trains in the north east and southern Scotland. They returned to the Southern Railway in July 1943 after the introduction of United States Army Transportation Corps S160 class 2-8-0s into service. From 1945 the King Arthur class regularly deputised for Bulleid&#x27;s new Pacifics, which were experiencing poor serviceability due to mechanical failures. The entire class came into British Railways ownership in 1948: they could be found in most areas of the Southern Region on medium-length expresses and stopping trains on the ex-LSWR mainline.

===Smoke deflector experiments===
In 1926, the N15 class became the first in Britain equipped with smoke deflectors, with several designs tested. Experiments were undertaken throughout 1926 and included the fitting of a curved plate above the smokebox of No. E753 &quot;Melisande&quot; to channel air from below the chimney to lift the exhaust above the locomotive when on the move. Nos. E450 &quot;Sir Kay&quot; and E753 &quot;Sir Gillemere&quot; had air scoops attached to the chimney, whilst E772 &quot;Sir Percivale&quot; was fitted with large, square German-type smoke deflectors. Finally, No. E453 &quot;King Arthur&quot; was fitted with small, rectangular smoke deflectors fitted to the handrails on the smokebox sides. The experiments produced mixed results, and Maunsell requested the assistance of the University of London in staging wind tunnel tests . These resulted in a standard plate design (illustrated in the infobox), which was gradually fitted to the class from late 1927 onwards.

===Performance of the Urie batch and modifications===
Under LSWR ownership, the N15s were initially well received by crews, though the batch soon gained a reputation for poor steaming on long runs. Through running of the class into Exeter was stopped in favour of engine changes at Salisbury, and Urie attributed the problem to poor driving technique. A series of trial runs changed this assumption, and demonstrated that steam pressure gradually decreased on the flat. The trials also revealed that the robust construction of the motion produced the heaviest hammerblow of any British locomotive class, and had caused cracked frames on the test locomotive.

Another criticism from locomotive crews concerned the exposed cab in bad weather, which necessitated the installation of a tarpaulin sheet over the rear of the cab and the front of the tender, restricting rearward vision. The 1921 Coal Miners’ strike meant that two class members (Nos. 737 and 739) were converted to oil-burning. One of the modified locomotives subsequently caught fire at Salisbury shed, and both were reverted to coal firing by the end of the year. When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923, Urie had done little to remedy the shortcomings of the N15s, and it fell to his successor to improve the class.

When Maunsell inherited the design as CME of the Southern Railway, he began trials using the weakest N15 (No. 742) in 1924. The results indicated that better performance could be obtained by altering the steam circuit, valve travel and draughting arrangements, although the first two recommendations were deemed too costly for immediate implementation by the Locomotive Committee. Eight extra King Arthur-type boilers were ordered from North British and fitted to N15s Nos. 737–742 by December 1925 in an effort to improve steaming. The remaining Urie boilers were fitted with standard Ross pop safety valves to ease maintenance. Maunsell also addressed draughting problems caused by the narrow Urie &quot;stovepipe&quot; chimney. The exhaust arrangements were modified on No. 737 using the King Arthur chimney design and reduced-diameter blastpipes. This proved successful, and all &quot;Urie N15s&quot; were modified over the period 1925–1929. The oil-burning equipment was refitted to Nos. 737 and 739 during the 1926 General Strike and removed in December of that year.

Beginning in 1928, all but No. 755 had their cylinder diameter reduced from to when renewals were due, improving speed on flat sections of railway, but affecting their performance on the gradients west of Salisbury. No. 755 &quot;The Red Knight&quot; was modified in 1940 by Maunsell&#x27;s successor, Oliver Bulleid with his own design of cylinders and streamlined steam passages. This was married to a Lemaître multiple-jet blastpipe and wide-diameter chimney, allowing the locomotive to produce performances akin to the more powerful Lord Nelson class. Four other N15s were so modified with four more on order, though the latter were cancelled due to wartime shortages of metal. The soft exhaust of the Lemaître multiple-jet blastpipe precipitated an adjustment to the smoke deflectors on three converted locomotives, with the tops angled to the vertical in an attempt to improve air-flow along the boiler cladding. This failed to achieve the desired effect, and the final two modified locomotives retained the Maunsell-style deflectors.

The final modifications to the &quot;Urie N15s&quot; involved the conversion of five locomotives (Nos. 740, 745, 748, 749 and 752) to oil-firing in 1946–1947. This was in response to a government scheme to address a post-war coal shortage. The oil tanks were fabricated from welded steel and fitted within the tender coal space. After initial problems with No. 740 &quot;Merlin&quot; were rectified, the oil-fired locomotives proved good performers on Bournemouth services. A further addition to the oil-fired locomotives was electric headcode and cab lighting, which was retained when the engines reverted to coal-firing in 1948.

===Performance of the Maunsell batches and modifications===
The improved front-end layout applied to the first batch of &quot;Eastleigh Arthurs&quot; (Nos. E448–E457) ensured continuous fast running on flat sections of track around London, although their propensity for speed was sometimes compromised over the hilly terrain west of Salisbury. The inside bearings of the Drummond &quot;watercart&quot; tenders proved problematic, as they were too small for the load carried and suffered from water ingress. The retention of the tall Drummond cab prevented use away from the Western section of the Southern Railway. Despite these problems, their operational reliability prompted the management to arrange the visit of No. E449 &quot;Sir Torre&quot; to the Darlington Railway Centenary celebrations in July 1925. No. E449 also recorded speeds of up to on the South West Mainline near in 1929. This proved that with the right components, Urie&#x27;s original design could perform well.

Despite the successful use of modified N15 components to rebuild Nos. E448–E457, the mechanically similar &quot;Scotch Arthurs&quot; proved disappointing when put into service from May 1925. The performance of those allocated to the Eastern section was indifferent, and failed to improve upon the double-headed ex-SECR 4-4-0s they were to replace. Reports of poor steaming and hot driving and tender wheel axleboxes were common from crewmen and shed fitters. After investigation, the problems were attributed to poor workmanship during construction as the North British Locomotive Company underquoted production costs to gain the contract. Defects were found in boiler construction across the batch, and necessitated six replacement boilers, re-riveting, re-fitting of tubes and replacement of firebox stays. The hot driving wheel axleboxes were caused by the main frames being out of alignment. A 1926 report suggested that all affected locomotives should be taken to Eastleigh for repair. Once repaired, the &quot;Scotch Arthurs&quot; proved as capable as the rest of the class in service.

&quot;Scotch Arthurs&quot; Nos. E763–E772 received new tenders between 1928 and 1930 in a series of tender exchanges with the Lord Nelson and LSWR S15 classes. This ensured that they could exchange their Urie bogie tenders with the Ashford design for use on the shorter Eastern section routes. Whilst useful for the roster clerks at Battersea shed, any transfer to the Western section was hampered because of their shorter range. By 1937, all had reverted to the Urie bogie tenders, though Nos. E768–E772 were attached to new Maunsell flush-sided tenders with brake vacuum reservoirs fitted behind the coal space. These were again swapped with Maunsell LSWR-style bogie tenders fitted to the Lord Nelson class.

The second batch of &quot;Eastleigh Arthurs&quot; displaced the ex-K class tanks and ex-LBSCR H2 &quot;Atlantic&quot; 4-4-2 locomotives on the and routes respectively. They were well liked by crews and used on this part of the network until the arrival of electrification. No. E782 &quot;Sir Brian&quot; was used on the former Great Northern main line for performance trials against the SECR K and K1 class tanks following the Sevenoaks railway accident in 1927. The tests were supervised by the London and North Eastern Railway&#x27;s CME, Sir Nigel Gresley, who commented that the class was unstable at high speeds. The instability was caused by motion hammerblow and exacerbated by irregularities in track-work. This caused excessive stress to the axleboxes and poor riding characteristics on the footplate. Despite this, the class benefited from an excellent maintenance regime.

Maunsell&#x27;s successor Oliver Bulleid believed that there was little need to improve draughting on this series. However, reports of poor steaming with No. 792 &quot;Sir Hervis de Revel&quot; gave him an opportunity to trial a Lemaître multiple-jet blastpipe and wide-diameter chimney on a Maunsell N15 in 1940. This did not enhance performance to the extent of No. 755 &quot;The Red Knight&quot;. Under British Railways ownership, the locomotive was re-fitted with the Maunsell chimney in March 1952 with no further problems reported. In another wartime experiment, Bulleid fitted No. 783 &quot;Sir Gillemere&quot; with three thin &quot;stovepipe&quot; chimneys in November 1940. These were set in a triangular formation to reduce visibility of exhaust from the air in response to attacks made by low-flying aircraft on Southern Railway trains. The &quot;stovepipes&quot; were reduced to two, producing a fierce exhaust blast that dislodged soot inside tunnels and under bridges. The experiment was discontinued in February 1941 and the locomotive re-fitted with a Maunsell King Arthur chimney. The last experiment was with spark-arresting equipment in response to lineside fires caused by poor quality coal. Nos. 784 &quot;Sir Nerovens&quot; and 788 &quot;Sir Urre of the Mount&quot; were fitted with new wide-diameter chimneys in late 1947. Test-trains showed mixed results and the trials were stopped in 1951 after improvements in coal quality and the fitting of internal smokebox spark-arrestors.

===Withdrawal===
The detail variations across the class meant the &quot;Urie N15s&quot; were placed into store over the winters of 1949 and 1952. The Maunsell King Arthur examples were easier to maintain, and the large number of modern Bulleid Pacific and British Railways Standard classes were able to undertake similar duties. The &quot;Urie N15s&quot; were brought into service during the summer months, although their deteriorating condition was demonstrated when No. 30754 &quot;The Green Knight&quot; was withdrawn with cracked frames in 1953. The slow running-down of the &quot;Urie N15s&quot; continued between 1955–1957, and several were stored prior to withdrawal. The last three were withdrawn from Basingstoke shed, with No. 30738 &quot;King Pellinore&quot; the final example to cease operation in March 1958. All were broken up for scrap, though their names were given to 20 BR Standard Class 5 locomotives allocated to the Southern Region between 1959–1962.

The Maunsell King Arthur class also faced a decrease in suitable work on the Central and Eastern sections following the introduction of BR Standard class 5 and BR Standard Class 4 4-6-0s in 1955. The gradual withdrawal of the &quot;Urie N15s&quot;, H15s and SR N15x classes presented an opportunity to replace the ageing Drummond &quot;watercart&quot; tenders fitted to Nos. 448–457 with Urie bogie tenders. This coincided with a 1958 programme to similarly change the Ashford tenders fitted to eight of the second batch &quot;Eastleigh Arthurs&quot;. The class remained intact until the completion of the Eastern section electrification when 17 were made redundant in 1959. More withdrawals took place in 1960 when an increase in Bulleid Pacifics allocated to the Western section reduced available work. The ranks thinned to 12 in 1961, and further withdrawals reduced the class to one, No. 30770 &quot;Sir Prianius&quot;. The class outlasted the newer – but less numerous – Lord Nelson class by one month when No. 30770 was withdrawn from Basingstoke Shed in November 1962.

==Accidents and incidents==
*In 1940, No. 751 &quot;Etarre&quot;, No. 755 &quot;The Red Knight&quot;, No. 775 &quot;Sir Agravaine&quot;, and No. 776 &quot;Sir Galagars&quot; along with T14 No. 458 and N15X No. 2328 &quot;Hackworth&quot; suffered bomb damage during the air raid on Nine Elms shed. No. 458 was scrapped and the other engines were eventually repaired.
*On 16 August 1944, 806 &quot;Sir Galleron&quot; was damaged by a V-1 flying bomb whilst pulling a passenger train in Upchurch; eight people were killed. The locomotive was eventually repaired and put back into service.
*On 26 November 1947, locomotive No. 753 &quot;King Arthur&quot; was hauling a passenger train that was in a rear-end collision with another, the other being hauled by SR Lord Nelson Class 4-6-0 No. 860 &quot;Lord Hawke&quot;, at , Hampshire due to a signalman&#x27;s error. Two people were killed. 
*On 22 January 1955, locomotive No. 30783 &quot;Sir Gillemere&quot; collided with H15 No. 30485 at Bournemouth Central station after its driver misread signals. The locomotive was subsequently repaired; The H15 was condemned.
*On 18 September 1962, locomotive No. 30770 &quot;Sir Prianus&quot; was hauling a newspaper train that caught fire between Knowle Junction and . Four of the five carriages were destroyed.

==Livery and numbering==

===LSWR and Southern Railway===
Under LSWR ownership, the &quot;Urie N15s&quot; were painted in Urie&#x27;s LSWR sage green livery for passenger locomotives. This was distinct from Drummond&#x27;s sage green because it was more olive in colour, and yellowed with cleaning and weathering. Black and white lining decorated the boiler bands and borders of the sage green panels. The lettering was in gilt: the initials &quot;LSWR&quot; located on the side of the tender, the locomotive number on the cabside.

The first Southern livery continued that of the LSWR, though with primrose yellow transfers showing &quot;SOUTHERN&quot; and the locomotive number, placed on the tender. The lining separating the black border on tender and cab side panels was changed to yellow. Primrose yellow transfers, showing &quot;SOUTHERN&quot; and the locomotive number, were placed on the tender. An &quot;E&quot; prefix was located above the tender number (e.g. E749), denoting that the class was registered for maintenance at Eastleigh works. The gilt numerals on the cabside and tender rear were replaced by a cast oval plate with &quot;Southern Railway&quot; around the edge and the number located in the centre. Yellow numerals were painted onto the front buffer beam to ease identification. In February 1925 Maunsell developed a deeper green with black and white lining. This was applied to his new King Arthur class locomotives and the &quot;Urie N15s&quot; were similarly painted when overhauls were due. Wheels were olive-green with black tyres. From 1929 the &quot;E&quot; prefix was removed and the cast numerals on the tender rear were removed and replaced with yellow transfers (e.g. 749).

In May 1938, after Bulleid&#x27;s appointment as CME, No. 749 &quot;Iseult&quot; was trialled in bright unlined light green with yellow-painted block numerals replacing the cast numberplates. The tender was given two designs of lettering, with &quot;SOUTHERN&quot; on one side and the initials &quot;SR&quot; on the other. The Board of Directors disapproved and Bulleid repainted the locomotive in darker malachite green with black and white lining (this would later be applied to his Pacifics). The legend &quot;SOUTHERN&quot; in block-lettering remained on the tender, though the number was relocated to the cabside on one side and the smoke deflector on the other. Both were painted in a light &quot;sunshine yellow&quot;. No. 749 was returned to Maunsell&#x27;s green livery.

Several variations of the Maunsell green, Urie sage green and Bulleid malachite green liveries were tried with black, white/black, and yellow lining, some sporting a green panel on the smoke deflectors. However, from 1942 to 1946, during the Second World War and its aftermath, members of the class under overhaul were turned out in unlined-black livery as a wartime economy measure, with green-shaded sunshine yellow lettering. The final Southern livery used from 1946 reverted to malachite green, with yellow/black lining, and sunshine yellow lettering. Some of the class (Nos. 782 and 800, &quot;Sir Brian&quot; and &quot;Sir Persant&quot;) did not receive this livery.

===British Railways===
British Railways gave the class the power classification of 5P after nationalisation in 1948. For the first 18 months the locomotives sported a transitional livery: Southern Railway malachite green with &quot;BRITISH RAILWAYS&quot; on the tender in sunshine yellow lettering. As each member of the class became due for a heavy general overhaul, they were repainted in the new standard British Railways express passenger livery of Brunswick green with orange and black lining from April 1949. Initially, the British Railways &quot;Cycling Lion&quot; crest was located on the tender, replaced from the 1957 by the later &quot;Ferret and Dartboard&quot; crest.

Numbering was initially a continuation of the Southern Railway system, though an &#x27;S&#x27; prefix was added to denote a pre-nationalisation locomotive, so that No. 448 would become No. s448. As each locomotive became due for overhaul and received its new livery, the numbering was changed to the British Railways standard numbering system, in the series 30448–30457 for the first ten and 30736–30806 for the rest.

==Operational assessment and preservation==

After the poor steaming of the Urie batch was addressed, the class proved popular amongst crews, mechanically reliable and capable of high speeds. However, their heavy hammerblow at speed meant that they were prone to rough riding and instability. The two Maunsell batches with their streamlined steam passages and better draughting arrangements were superior in performance, and were a popular choice when Bulleid&#x27;s locomotives were unavailable. Their use of standard parts considerably eased maintenance, and the fitting of different tender and cab sizes meant few operational restrictions for the class on mainline routes. The class gave many years of service, and were noted for their ability to &quot;do the job&quot;. The electrification of the Eastern and Central sections and the increasing number of Bulleid Pacifics in service meant the lack of a suitable role for the class under British Railways ownership. In spite of the reduction in work, high mileages were obtained with No. 30745 &quot;Tintagel&quot; achieving in service.

The decision to preserve a member of the class was made in November 1960. It was first intended to preserve the King Arthur class doyen No. 30453 &quot;King Arthur&quot;, and it was stored for a time after withdrawal in 1961 pending restoration to museum condition. However, it was decided to restore the preserved locomotive to as-built condition, and the lack of a suitable Drummond &quot;watercart&quot; tender precluded this consideration. No. 30453 was subsequently scrapped and it was decided to preserve one of the North British-built batch, No. 30777 &quot;Sir Lamiel&quot;, withdrawn in October 1961, instead. &quot;Sir Lamiel&quot; was named after a character in Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Sir Lamiel of Cardiff. This locomotive was restored to Maunsell livery as No. E777, and became part of the National Collection. It was restored to the later British Railways livery in 2003. As of 2022, 30777 is under overhaul to service.

==Models==
In 2007, Hornby Railways introduced a model of the N15 in OO gauge.

<doc id="1326403" wikidata="Q1351228" url="?curid=1326403" title="Eric Dickerson">
<text>Eric Demetric Dickerson (born September 2, 1960) is an American former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons. Dickerson played college football for the Mustangs of Southern Methodist University and was recognized as an All-American. He was selected second overall in the 1983 NFL draft by the Los Angeles Rams, and later played for the Indianapolis Colts, Los Angeles Raiders, and Atlanta Falcons. During his NFL career, he rushed for over 13,000 yards. He holds the NFL&#x27;s single-season rushing record with 2,105 yards, set in 1984. Dickerson was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999 and, in 2019, was named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest running backs of all time. He wore prescription goggles throughout his career due to myopia.

==Recruitment and college career==
Dickerson committed to Texas A&amp;M before reconsidering and deciding amongst Oklahoma, Southern California and Southern Methodist University (SMU). His great-grandaunt talked him into staying in the state of Texas to attend Southern Methodist University because she liked SMU coach Ron Meyer. Dickerson was the subject of recruiting controversy when he started driving a new Pontiac Trans Am during his senior year of high school. According to myth, Dickerson began driving the vehicle about the same time he committed to A&amp;M, and, when he signed with SMU, he purportedly stopped driving the vehicle because it &quot;had been destroyed by a vengeful Aggie&quot;. Ron Meyer called the car the &quot;Trans A&amp;M&quot;. At the time, he said his grandmother from Mexico had purchased it for him. Dickerson has refused to answer whether he accepted anything to attend SMU, saying, &quot;Even if I did take something, I still wouldn&#x27;t tell.&quot; In 2022, Dickerson admitted that the Trans Am had been paid for by A&amp;M boosters, and that in an attempt to hide the impropriety one of his family members made the purchase and was reimbursed by the boosters. He said he later sold the car to an SMU teammate.

Initially, Dickerson shared carries with Craig James and Charles Waggoner, all three blue-chip recruits in 1979. Waggoner was hurt returning a kickoff their freshman season, leaving Dickerson and James to lead SMU&#x27;s running attack, called the Pony Express. Dickerson gained 4,450 yards on 790 carries to break Earl Campbell’s Southwest Conference record for yards and attempts. His 48 career touchdowns tied Doak Walker’s SMU total for career scoring. In his senior year, despite splitting time with James, Dickerson finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting, behind Herschel Walker and John Elway. He was also a first-team All-American in 1982 and a second-team All-American in 1981.

===Statistics===
==Professional career==
===1983–1987: L.A. Rams===

Before the 1983 NFL draft, the Houston Oilers said they would draft Dickerson second if they did not make a trade. Dickerson&#x27;s family opposed him playing for the Oilers — although Dickerson himself was merely cool about doing so — while, like John Elway, Dickerson would have flatly refused to play for the Baltimore Colts had they drafted him. A trade with the Oilers saw the Los Angeles Rams acquire the second pick, which they used to draft Dickerson. Although he considered going to the Los Angeles Express in the United States Football League, Dickerson ultimately decided to play for the Rams. An immediate success, he established rookie records for most rushing attempts (390), most rushing yards gained (1,808) and most touchdowns rushing (18), including another two receiving touchdowns. His efforts earned him All-Pro, Pro Bowl, Player of the Year and Rookie of the Year honors.

In his second season, Dickerson continued his onslaught on the NFL record book becoming a member of the 2,000-yard club. Twelve times in 1984 he gained more than 100 yards rushing, breaking the record of 100-yard games in a season held by O. J. Simpson. His 2,105 total yards rushing beat Simpson&#x27;s 1973 NFL season record of 2,003 yards (Dickerson having reached 2,007 yards after 15 games), but since the NFL expanded the regular season from 14 to 16 games in 1978, Dickerson had the benefit of playing in two additional games. No one has since rushed for more yards in a single NFL season. Dickerson&#x27;s 5.6 yards per carry led the Rams to a playoff berth in 1984.

Although he rushed for 1,234 yards in 1985 while missing the first two games due to a contract dispute, Dickerson missed the Pro Bowl for the first time in his young NFL career. He did go on to rush for a playoff record 248 yards against the Dallas Cowboys in post-season play.

===1987–1991: Indianapolis Colts===

The 1985 season marked the beginning of ongoing contract disputes between Dickerson and the Rams. In 1987, after playing just three games for the Rams during the strike-shortened 1987 season, Dickerson was traded to the Indianapolis Colts in one of the NFL&#x27;s biggest trades ever at that time. In a three-team deal, the Colts traded linebacker Cornelius Bennett, whom they drafted but were unable to sign to a contract, to the Buffalo Bills for their first-round pick in 1988, first- and second-round picks in 1989, and running back Greg Bell. The Colts in turn traded Bell and the three draft choices from Buffalo plus their own first- and second-round picks in 1988, their second-round pick in 1989, and running back Owen Gill to the Rams for Dickerson. With the picks the Rams took running back Gaston Green, wide receiver Aaron Cox, linebacker Fred Strickland, running back Cleveland Gary, linebacker Frank Stams, and defensive back Darryl Henley. The trade reunited Dickerson with Ron Meyer, who had left SMU after Dickerson&#x27;s junior season to take the head coaching position in New England and who was hired by the Colts in 1986 following Rod Dowhower&#x27;s firing.

Although he played in just nine games with the Colts that year, he still managed to gain 1,011 yards to finish the season with 1,288. Also, he spearheaded a late season Colts run that helped the team to their first winning season (and first playoff berth) in 10 years.

In 1988, Dickerson, with 1,659 yards rushing, became the first Colt to lead the league in rushing since Alan Ameche in 1955. This would mark the apogee of Dickerson&#x27;s career with the Colts (although he would gain 1,311 yards rushing in 1989). Also, 1989 was the year that he passed the 10,000-yard mark, becoming the fastest player ever to do so (91 games), accomplishing the feat faster than greats like Jim Brown (98 games), Barry Sanders (103 games), Emmitt Smith (106 games), and LaDainian Tomlinson (106 games). By 1989, he had set a new NFL record with seven straight seasons of more than 1,000 yards rushing, and led the league for four of those seasons. With the retirement of Tony Dorsett at the end of 1988, he became the leader among active players in career rushing yards, a position he occupied until his own retirement in 1993.

However, injuries, further contract disputes, and suspensions clouded his final two seasons with the Colts. Dickerson, at 29, was the highest-paid running back in the NFL, receiving an annual reported salary of $1.4 million. Following prolonged contract disputes, the Colts placed him on the inactive list before the start of the 1990 season where he stayed for 7 weeks and lost more than $600,000 in salary. In his sixth game back from suspension, he rushed for 143 yards against the Bengals on 22 carries—this effort lifted him past Jim Brown to third place on the NFL career rushing list behind Walter Payton and Tony Dorsett. He was again suspended in November 1991, and amidst injuries and age, managed to run for only 536 yards that season. The Colts finished the year bottoming out with a 1–15 record.

Dickerson has described the trade to Indianapolis as the worst moment of his career, and stated that he disliked his time with the Colts.

===1992–1993: Final years===
On April 26, 1992, Dickerson was traded by the Colts to the Los Angeles Raiders for their fourth- and eighth-round picks in the 1992 draft. There were occasional flashes of greatness—107 yards against the Broncos, 103 against the Chargers, where he recorded his 63rd and 64th career 100-yard games—but those would be his last. Dickerson also scored on a 40-yard touchdown run, reminiscent of his prime, in front of a nationally televised Monday Night audience in a game against Kansas City. That year, he led the team in rushing attempts and yards. However, he suffered from splitting carries with Marcus Allen by having the latter finish the second half.

The following season, Dickerson was traded to the Atlanta Falcons on July 7, 1993, for a sixth-round draft pick. He played in a backup role, making his final national televised appearance during the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game on September 27, 1993, when the Falcons hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers in a losing effort. The Falcons traded Dickerson and third-year cornerback Bruce Pickens to the Green Bay Packers for running back John Stephens on October 13, 1993.

The trade came a week after Dickerson said he had been told that the Falcons were waiving him because Coach Jerry Glanville wanted to use younger players. The next day, Falcons officials said that there had been a misunderstanding and that Dickerson had not been placed on waivers. Dickerson retired as the second leading rusher of all time after failing a physical with the Packers.

On August 29, 2017, Dickerson signed a one-day contract to officially retire as a member of the Los Angeles Rams.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Honors==

Dickerson became the seventh back to gain more than 10,000 yards and the fastest ever to do so, reaching the milestone in just 91 games. During his 11-year career, Dickerson gained 13,259 yards rushing, which was second all-time at the time of his retirement, and rushed for 90 touchdowns. He gained another 2,137 yards and 6 touchdowns on 281 pass receptions. A six-time Pro Bowl selection, Dickerson was All-Pro in 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987 and 1988. In 1999, his first year of eligibility, Eric Dickerson was selected to become a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Also in 1999, he was ranked number 38 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. The following year, he provided on-field commentary during &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcasts.

The Rams&#x27; number 29 has been retired in his honor.

Dickerson was inducted into the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor during the week 15 game against the Houston Texans on December 15, 2013, along with Marshall Faulk, another former Colts running back, who, coincidentally, also played for the Rams-albeit in St Louis.

In 1999, he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

In 2019, he was one of twelve running backs selected to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

Dickerson was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2020.

==Post-NFL career==
Along with Melissa Stark, Dickerson served as a sideline reporter on Monday Night Football broadcasts for ABC during the 2000 and 2001 NFL seasons.

During the 2007 football season and 2016 football season, Dickerson worked as a broadcaster for KCBS television in Los Angeles, providing commentary for NFL pregame and postgame shows.

He started a sports memorabilia company called Original Mini Jerseys with former Los Angeles Rams teammate LeRoy Irvin. The company received their NFL license in 2006 and sells authentic miniature replica jerseys. He also owns an internet-based sporting goods company, E Champs.

Dickerson made a cameo appearance in the television series &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; in 2014. In August 2016, he began hosting a two-hour Monday afternoon program on Los Angeles sports-talk station KLAC.

In 2017, he competed in the reality television game show &quot;The New Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. He was the third contestant &quot;terminated&quot; by host Arnold Schwarzenegger.

In 2019, Dickerson played a role as LAFD Chief Brinkle in the TV Series &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;.

In 2017, he joined Fox Sports&#x27; FS1 as an NFL analyst.

In 2023, Dickerson attended the fifth dinner service in &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;&#x27;s 22nd season.

<text>Robert John Riggins (born August 4, 1949), nicknamed &quot;Riggo&quot; and &quot;Diesel&quot;, is an American former professional football player who was a fullback in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Jets and Washington Redskins. He played college football for the Kansas Jayhawks. Riggins was known for his &quot;bell cow&quot; running style and productivity well into the later years of his career. In the 1983 season, at age 34, he rushed for a then-NFL record of 24 touchdowns, a record which stood for almost 20 seasons. Riggins again led the league in rushing touchdowns during the 1984 season at age 35. Although he earned only one Pro Bowl appearance in his career, Riggins had his greatest success in the postseason and was named MVP of Super Bowl XVII where he scored one touchdown and rushed for 166 yards in a 27–17 win for the Redskins over the Miami Dolphins. Riggins was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1992.

==Early life==
Riggins was born in Seneca, Kansas, of partial Czech ancestry and attended Centralia High School in Centralia, Kansas. While there, he was a three-sport athlete, earning high school All-American recognition in football, all-state honors in basketball and twice winning the Class B 100-yard dash state title.

Riggins high school is now located on John Riggins Avenue, which runs through a main part of Centralia.

On October 12, 2012, John with his brothers Frank (Junior) and Bill Riggins were on hand to dedicate the Centralia High School football field renaming it Riggins Field in honoring their parents, Franklin Eugene and Mildred Riggins. The Pro Football Hall of Fame dedicated a plaque and NFL Films was there to film the event. The Riggins brothers took center field for the opening coin toss and the Centralia High School Panthers went on to beat the Troy (Kansas) High School Trojans with a final score of 55–0.

==College career==
Riggins attended the University of Kansas and played for the Jayhawks, where he was an All-American and two-time All-Big Eight Conference first-team selection. Riggins led the Jayhawks to a Big Eight Conference championship win in 1968. The team then went to the 1969 Orange Bowl, which they lost to Penn State, 15–14.

During his senior season in 1970, Riggins rushed for 1,131 yards and scored a then school-record 14 touchdowns. He finished his career with 2,659 rushing yards, which broke Gale Sayers&#x27;s career rushing record for the school Riggins is now ranked fifth for Kansas&#x27; all-time rushing leaders and 14th for total yards.

While at Kansas, Riggins majored in journalism.

==Professional career==
===New York Jets===
Riggins was the first running back selected in the 1971 NFL draft, at sixth in the first round, by the New York Jets. As a rookie he became the first Jet to lead the team in both rushing and receiving. On October 15, 1972, the Jets set a team-record of 333 rushing yards against the New England Patriots, beating them 41–13. Riggins, who had 168 yards, and Emerson Boozer, who had 150 yards, became the only running back tandem in franchise history who both rushed for 150 yards in a game. Although he missed the final two games in 1972 because of knee surgery, Riggins rushed for 944 yards, four yards less than Matt Snell&#x27;s franchise record.

Riggins was among the top ten rushers in the American Football Conference in 1974 despite missing four games with a shoulder injury. After only four years with the Jets, he was already the fourth-leading rusher in team history with 2,875 yards. In 1975, Riggins became the first player in franchise history to rush for 1,000 or more yards in a season. On December 21, 1975, he ran for 121 yards against the Dallas Cowboys which gave him 1,005 for the season. In what turned out to be his last season with the Jets, Riggins made his only appearance in the Pro Bowl.

Riggins was named the Jets&#x27; MVP (now known as the Martin Award) in 1972 and 1975.

===Washington Redskins===
In 1976, Riggins signed as a free agent with the Washington Redskins, who offered him a five-year, $1.5 million contract, compared to the $63,000 he earned in his final year with the Jets. He was used mostly in short-yardage situations in his first season with Washington and missed much of the 1977 season with a knee injury. However, Riggins gained more than 1,000 yards each of the next two seasons and was a major part of the Redskins&#x27; offense.

====Contract dispute====
During training camp in July 1980, Riggins requested to renegotiate his $300,000-per-year contract and the Redskins refused. He then chose to leave camp and the Redskins placed him on the left camp-retired list, a move that made him ineligible to play for any other team in the league. Riggins sat out the 1980 season and did not rejoin the Redskins until 1981, when new Washington head coach Joe Gibbs traveled to Kansas to make a peace offering.

&quot;He had a camouflage outfit on&quot;, Gibbs recalled. 

Riggins&#x27;s return also came at the suggestion of Ed Garvey, who was the executive director of the NFL Players Association.

Eleven months after he left, Riggins returned to training camp in 1981 with a new contract, telling the media &quot;I&#x27;m bored, I&#x27;m broke, and I&#x27;m back.&quot;

====Return to the Redskins====

Upon Riggins&#x27;s return in 1981, he managed just 714 rushing yards but scored 13 touchdowns.

During the strike-shortened 1982 season, Riggins led the team with 553 rushing yards, but averaged just 3.1 yards per carry. He was much more successful during the playoffs, during which he gained 444 yards in victories over the Detroit Lions, Minnesota Vikings (where he had a franchise playoff record 185 yards), and Dallas Cowboys, and helped the Redskins reach Super Bowl XVII. Riggins rushed for a then-Super Bowl record 166 yards on 38 carries as the Redskins beat the Miami Dolphins 27–17. He was then named Super Bowl MVP.

A play that was designed for gaining short yardage called &quot;70 chip&quot; turned out to be the key play of the game. With 10 minutes remaining, Riggins took a handoff on 4th-and-inches, shrugged off a tackle attempt by cornerback Don McNeal, and ran for a 43-yard touchdown. The Super Bowl win was the Redskins&#x27; first championship victory since 1942. Riggins&#x27;s total of 610 yards amounted to 43 percent of Washington&#x27;s offense in the four playoff games. His four consecutive playoff games with over 100 yards was an NFL postseason record. On December 6, 2007, Riggins&#x27;s run was voted by fans as the Redskins&#x27; Greatest Moment.

The 610 rushing yards and 625 yards from scrimmage he gained in the 1982 playoffs are both single NFL postseason records.

In 1983, Riggins rushed for 1,347 yards, scored a then-NFL record 24 touchdowns, won the Bert Bell Award, and was named All-Pro for the first time in his career. Riggins went on to have another outstanding postseason, rushing for 242 yards and five touchdowns in their two playoff games, extending his NFL record of postseason games with at least 100 rushing yards to six. However, he only rushed for 64 yards and a touchdown in the Redskins&#x27; 38–9 Super Bowl XVIII loss against the Los Angeles Raiders.

Two other career milestones happened in the 1983 season for Riggins. On November 20, 1983, he set an NFL record by scoring in his 12th consecutive game during a 42–20 win over the Los Angeles Rams. His record would end at 13 consecutive games the following week. Then on December 17, 1983, Mark Moseley set an NFL kicking record by scoring 161 points in a season, which also made him the league leader in scoring that season. Riggins, who scored 144 points, was second on the season scoring list. This was the first time since 1951 that the top two scorers in a season played on the same team.

Riggins gained 1,239 yards in 1984 and tied for the league lead in rushing TDs (14), despite a bad back. He went over 1,000 yards on Nov. 18, 1984 at the age of 35 years, 3 months and 9 days, becoming the oldest player to rush for over 1,000 yards, eclipsing the record previously held by John Henry Johnson. It is a record that still stands today. In 1985, he rushed for more than 100 yards in three of his last four starts before being replaced by George Rogers as the starter. He retired after that season.

Riggins played 175 games in 14 seasons, had 13,442 total yards (11,352 rushing and 2,090 receiving) and 116 total touchdowns (104 rushing and 12 receiving). Riggins rushed over 1,000 yards five times in his career and over 100 yards in 35 games, including a then-record six in post-season. He rushed 251 times for 996 yards in the playoffs. He also had 12 touchdowns in nine post-season contests, good for fourth all-time tied with Terrell Davis and Marshawn Lynch.
 He was the second player ever to rush for over 100 touchdowns in NFL history, and the first to do it since Jim Brown reached the milestone in 1965.

===Honors===

Riggins later explained that he &quot;just had to hear [the roar of the crowd] one more time&quot;.

In 1992, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

On October 13, 2007, Riggins was inducted into the University of Kansas&#x27; Ring of Honor at Memorial Stadium.

==After football==

===Acting===
In 1994, he began acting lessons and has since starred in off-off-Broadway productions of the plays &quot;Gillette&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (in which he played Bottom). His television credits include &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; and &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;.

Riggins&#x27;s acting career began at Centralia High when a teacher cast him as the lead role in his junior play. His career as a professional actor started in 1992 when he appeared in &quot;Illegal Motion&quot; at the Olney Theatre Center for the Arts. He starred as a beleaguered head football coach accused of inappropriate recruiting practices.

===Commentating===
Since retiring from professional football, Riggins has worked as a sports commentator on television and radio.

In 1998, John and Chris Russo hosted &quot;Riggins and Russo&quot; on Sundays during the football season. The show was aired on WCBS-TV in New York City, focusing primarily on the Jets&#x27; and Giants&#x27; upcoming games.

Since 2006, Riggins has served as color commentator on Westwood One for the network&#x27;s weekly national radio broadcast of &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;.

On July 18, 2006, Triple X ESPN Radio was launched with Riggins hosting &quot;The John Riggins Show&quot;. Riggins could be heard in the Washington, D.C. area weekdays from 4-7pm on 94.3 FM, 92.7 FM &amp; 730 AM, WXGI 950 AM in Richmond, Virginia and WXTG-FM 102.1 FM in Virginia Beach, Virginia and WXTG (AM) 1490 in Hampton, Virginia. The last show of the series aired on its second anniversary, July 18, 2008. With the merger of Triple X into WTEM to form &quot;ESPN 980&quot;, Riggins&#x27;s afternoon show was replaced by WTEM&#x27;s afternoon drive show, &quot;The Sports Reporters&quot;. Riggins stayed with ESPN 980 as a commentator at large.

On January 3, 2008, Riggins co-hosted the 74th Orange Bowl pre-game show. That same night, the Kansas Jayhawks defeated the Virginia Tech Hokies 24–21. It came 39 years after Riggins and the Jayhawks last played in the game in 1969. He offered congratulations to his alma mater in his closing comments, saying &quot;The KU ship&#x27;s been out at sea since &#x27;48. It finally came to port tonight!&quot;

In September 2008 it was announced that Riggins would co-host the program &quot;Sirius Blitz&quot; with Adam Schein on Satellite Radio Stations Sirius 124 and XM 105. Following his involvement with &quot;Sirius Blitz&quot; Riggins began hosting his own show, The John Riggins Show, which simulcasts on television and radio on MASN-TV and WTOP-HD3, which airs each weekday afternoon. Riggins has been critical on his radio shows of the current management of the Washington Redskins under owner Dan Snyder.

Previously, he had been a panelist on &quot;Redskins Report&quot; until that show was canceled in December 2008 due to budget cuts.

In 2016, Riggins returned to ESPN 980 Redskins radio in a variety of roles. Weekly appearances consisted of a one-hour appearance on Tuesdays with Bram Weinstein, a Thursday appearance on moving drive with Kevin Sheehan &amp; Chris Cooley and a Friday appearance on Inside The Locker Room with Doc Walker, Brian Mitchell and Scott Jackson. Additionally, Riggins co-hosted the Washington Redskins Radio Network pregame show with Kevin Sheehan before every Redskins game.

==Personal life==

Riggins has been married twice and has six children Robert, Portia, Emil, Liberty, Hannah and Coco. He now resides in Cabin John, Maryland near the Potomac River with his wife Lisa Marie.

It was at the 1985 National Press Club&#x27;s Salute to Congress that Riggins drunkenly told Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor to &quot;loosen up, Sandy baby&quot; because she was &quot;too uptight&quot; when the two met at dinner. Riggins then fell asleep under the table. The next time Justice O&#x27;Connor and John Riggins met at a function years later, he gave her a dozen roses.

<text>Táncház (, literally &quot;dance house&quot;) is a &quot;casual&quot; Hungarian folk dance event (as opposed to stage performances). It is an aspect of the Hungarian roots revival of traditional culture which began in the early 1970s, and remains an active part of the national culture across the country, especially in cities like Budapest. Táncház draws on traditions from across the regions of the Kingdom of Hungary (most notably Transylvania), especially music and dance. The term is derived from a Transylvanian tradition of holding dances at individuals&#x27; homes. 

The táncház traditions were recreated as authentically as possible, a process aided by fairly detailed research on Hungarian culture. The movement is composed of numerous informal groups. Since the 1970s, non-ethnic Hungarians living in Hungary have had their folk traditions treated the same as their Hungarian neighbors. In addition, ethnic Hungarians outside of Hungary, such as those in Transylvania, Slovakia, and the Siret River valley of Moldavia, are also celebrated by the táncház movement. Sic/Szék in Romania has three streets: Felszeg, Csipkeszeg and Forrószeg, and each street had their own &quot;táncház&quot;. Two of the dance houses have been restored or rebuilt: the dance house of Csipkeszeg is now a museum and in the rebuilt dance house of Forrószeg you can admire the dance house pictures of Korniss Péter, a photographer from Budapest. Every month there is a Hungarian dance house in Sic/Szék organized by the Csipkeszeg Foundation. 

Within the United States, Hungarian dance groups such as Csűrdöngölő (in New Jersey), Tisza Ensemble (in Washington, D.C.), Kárpátok (in Los Angeles), Életfa (in New York and New Jersey), and Csárdás (in Cleveland) perform on stage bringing the feel of the táncház to general audiences, and camps such as Ti Ti Tábor (in Washington state) and Csipke (in Michigan) bring dance teachers and musicians from Hungary and Transylvania to teach North Americans the music and dance of the Hungarian peoples.

In the United Kingdom, Csergő Band has a regular Hungarian dance house in London. 

North America&#x27;s preeminent Hungarian folk music group specializing in Tanchaz music is the Gyanta Band. The podcast Tanchaz Talk, hosted by Kalman Magyar, is the world’s only English-language program focusing primarily on Hungarian folk music.

== Importance of the táncház method ==

In recognition of the revitalization and safeguarding efforts of the táncház method in teaching traditional dancing, it has been inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s List of Intangible Heritage of Urgent Safeguarding in November 2011.

<doc id="1326416" wikidata="Q174168" url="?curid=1326416" title="Strauder v. West Virginia">
<text>Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303 (1880), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States about racial discrimination and United States constitutional criminal procedure. &quot;Strauder&quot; was the first instance where the Supreme Court reversed a state court decision denying a defendant&#x27;s motion to remove his criminal trial to federal court pursuant to Section 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.

Its holding, along with those of its companion cases of &quot;Virginia v. Rives &quot; (1880) and &quot;Ex parte Virginia&quot; (1880) established the proposition that it is a denial to criminal defendants of the equal protection of the law for a state to exclude persons from service on a grand or petit jury on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. These holdings &quot;do not&quot; guarantee criminal defendants that the grand or petit juries involved in their case will be composed either in full or in part of members of a non-white defendant&#x27;s race (as was sought in the &quot;Rives&quot; case), but held instead that equal protection demands only that potential jurors could not be excluded from jury service on account of their race. Additionally, the Supreme Court did not exercise its power of judicial review to strike down West Virginia&#x27;s juror qualifications statute as unconstitutional, as Strauder and his attorneys did not seek such a remedy. Instead, Strauder desired his case be removed to federal court, where he expected he could receive a &quot;venire&quot; that included freedmen.

In &quot;Strauder&quot; and the companion cases, the Supreme Court also issued a narrow interpretation of the removal provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1866. For a case to be removed to federal court, the denial of rights must occur in the constitution or laws of the state, or in other pre-trial actions of state officials, that state courts are without power to remedy—that is, it held that the Civil Rights Act required removal be based on objectively discernible facts about the denial of rights (such as the exclusion of freedmen from the jury pool by Judge Coles in &quot;Ex parte Virginia&quot;, despite Virginia law allowing freedmen to serve as jurors, an act in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1875), and not the defendant&#x27;s subjective beliefs about potential outcomes of a state-administered trial. The Supreme Court provided that the remedy for denials of equal protection occurring during trial can be found in the appeals process; only those cases where equal rights cannot be enforced before state judicial bodies are appropriate to be removed to federal court.

==Background==
On the morning of April 18, 1872 in Wheeling, West Virginia, Taylor Strauder, a former slave, allegedly murdered his wife Anna by bludgeoning her to death with two strikes from a hatchet handle to the left side of her head after having argued with her through the night about an allegation of her marital infidelity. Strauder&#x27;s step-daughter, Fannie Green, supposedly witnessed the murder, and alleged that Strauder threatened Green to remain quiet, lest she too be killed. Strauder allegedly fled and was arrested in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on April 25, 1872.

==Procedural history==
Following the passage and ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Under section 3 of the act, Congress provided to defendants in state trials the right to remove to federal court &quot;all causes, civil or criminal,&quot; arising under state or municipal laws wherein &quot;any of the rights secured to [the defendant] by the first section of this act&quot; were denied or could not be enforced. Later fearing that the Thirteenth Amendment might not provide a sufficient legal basis for the Civil Rights Act, Congress passed and the states ratified the Fourteenth Amendment. Congress then passed the act of May 31, 1870, of which section 18 reenacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Moreover, section 16 of the 1870 act also provided that &quot;all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory in the United States... to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property as is enjoyed by white citizens[.]&quot;

===First trial===
Upon his return to Wheeling, Strauder appeared before the circuit court for Ohio County, West Virginia and received a preliminary examination before Judge Thayer Melvin. The court assigned George O. Davenport and Blackburn B. Dovener as Strauder&#x27;s counsel, and set his arraignment for the May 1872 term of the circuit court. On May 20, 1872 the grand jury returned an indictment for murder in the first degree. Strauder demurred the indictment as defective, arguing the facts alleged did not rise to murder in the first degree, and that the panel from which the grand jury was selected excluded non-whites; the court overruled the arguments. Counsel for Strauder then attempted to remove the case to the U.S. district court for West Virginia, but this too was overruled. Strauder then pleaded not guilty by reason of temporary insanity and asked the court for a continuance to the October term, which was granted. At the next term, Strauder received a second continuance to the May 1873 term.

During the first continuance, the State of West Virginia adopted a new state constitution in August 1872. The state legislature reconstructed the state courts and passed a criminal procedure bill on April 3, 1873 providing criminal defendants with preliminary examinations to occur at the county court (as distinguished from the circuit court for the county). At the May 1873 term of the circuit court, Strauder made a motion requesting this examination before the county court. The circuit court denied the motion, citing the preliminary examination the circuit court had already given. The case then proceeded to trial over May 6–8, 1873; the jury returned a verdict of guilty after approximately 90 minutes of deliberations. The court sentenced Strauder to death by hanging on July 8, 1873.

===First appeal===
On appeal, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia held on July 20, 1874 that, since Strauder&#x27;s case had not yet commenced trial at the time of the passage of the April 3, 1873 statute providing for a preliminary examination before trial, Strauder&#x27;s case was within the scope of the statute. Since Strauder had timely made the request for the examination, the ruling of the circuit court denying the examination by the county court on grounds that the statute wasn&#x27;t applicable to the case was reversed. &quot;The error of the circuit court in refusing the accused an examination before the county court of the county of Ohio upon said charge of murder, is fatal to all the other proceedings in the cause by which the accused was tried, convicted and sentenced to be hung...&quot; Consequently, the supreme court reversed the circuit court&#x27;s denial of the request for the preliminary examination, overruled and nulled all rulings made in the case after that point, set aside the verdict, and remanded the case with instructions that the preliminary examination take place in the county court in accordance with the law.

===Second trial===
The clerk of the circuit court certified the case to the county court, which completed its preliminary examination on September 9, 1874 and remanded Strauder to the circuit court for trial. A grand jury convened and on October 20, 1874 returned an indictment similar to that of May 20, 1872. Strauder&#x27;s arraignment on the new indictment took place on November 2, 1874.

At the arraignment, Strauder and his counsel moved to quash the new indictment and to remove the case to federal court on grounds that West Virginia law precluded non-white citizens from grand and petit jury service. During the course of the first trial, an act regarding trial procedure had passed as part of the 1873 reconstruction of the West Virginia courts in consequence of the new state constitution; the act of March 12, 1873 provided &quot;[a]ll white male persons, who are twenty-one years of age and not over sixty, and who are citizens of this State, shall be liable to serve as jurors, except as herein provided.&quot; The only exception provided regarded service as a state official. The judge denied both motions. Strauder then demurred each count contained in the indictment and was again overruled. At that point, Strauder pleaded not guilty to the indictment, and the trial proceeded to jury selection, which resulted in an all-white jury. Strauder&#x27;s counsel raised an objection to the composition of this jury was entered, but the court overruled the objection. The trial continued through November 4 when the case went to the jury for deliberations. On November 5, the jury returned a verdict of guilty and a sentence of death. Strauder and his counsel moved for a new trial on grounds of an impartial juror and that the jury contained no jurors of Strauder&#x27;s race, for which arguments were heard January 5, 1875. The court denied the motion, and proceeded to sentence Strauder to death by hanging on January 9, 1875.

===Second appeal===
Arguments before the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia took place June 27, 1876. Strauder&#x27;s counsel raised 11 points of exception. The supreme court handed down its ruling on November 17, 1877, relying on the opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;The Slaughter-House Cases&quot; and &quot;Bradwell v. Illinois&quot; to find the Fourteenth Amendment had not been &quot;intended to protect the citizens of any State against unjust legislation by their own State.&quot; The Supreme Court consequently affirmed the trial court&#x27;s denial of the motion to remove of the case to federal court as correct. Strauder&#x27;s case was then sent back to the Circuit Court of Ohio County for resentencing, but held over until the April 1878 term.

While awaiting resentencing, Strauder and his counsel appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. On April 15, 1878, Chief Justice Morrison Waite granted a writ of error. The case was set for argument in the October 1879 term, and oral arguments were heard over October 20–21, 1879 along with the companion cases of &quot;Virginia v. Rives&quot; and &quot;Ex parte Virginia&quot;. Assisting Strauder&#x27;s counsel in the arguments before the Supreme Court were U.S. Attorney General Charles Devens and former justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia Westel Willoughby. Arguing for the State of West Virginia were West Virginia Attorney General Robert White and special counsel James W. Green, a Virginia lawyer.

==Decision==
The majority opinion, written by Justice William Strong, focused on two legal questions:
# Does the Constitution of the United States afford citizens of the United States a right to trial by a jury selected and empaneled without discrimination against prospective jurors on account of a juror&#x27;s race or color?
# If such a right exists and is denied by the state, may the case be removed to federal court pursuant to Congress&#x27;s power of enforcement under the Fourteenth Amendment?

The majority held that categorical exclusion of blacks from juries for no other reason than their race violated the Equal Protection Clause since the very purpose of the Clause was &quot;to assure to the colored race the enjoyment of all the civil rights that under the law are enjoyed by white persons, and to give to that race the protection of the general government, in that enjoyment, whenever it should be denied by the States.&quot; The Court did not say that a law barring blacks from juries violated the rights of potential jury members, but that such an exclusion violated the rights of black criminal defendants since juries would be &quot;drawn from a panel from which the State has expressly excluded every man of [a defendant&#x27;s] race.&quot;

However, the Court did not strike down West Virginia&#x27;s law respecting juror qualifications as unconstitutional, as Strauder had not challenged the law on that ground. Instead, it proceeded with an analysis of whether the denial of equal protection of the law confronting Strauder was of a nature sufficient to motivate an exercise of Congressional authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enact federal legislation allowing for the removal of cases such as Strauder&#x27;s to the local federal district court, presumably where the trial process, under the supervision of a federal judge, would enforce the defendant&#x27;s rights against the state.

===Dissent===
The two dissenting justices, Field and Clifford, explained their position in the case of &quot;Ex Parte Virginia&quot;, decided the same day. In the latter case, Field wrote, with Clifford joining, &quot;The equality of the protection secured extends only to civil rights, as distinguished from those which are political or arise from the form of the government and its mode of administration.&quot;

==Subsequent case history==
The Supreme Court of the United States on July 9, 1880 remanded the case to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, and ordered that the court reverse the decision of the circuit court and remand the case for further proceedings. By August 17, 1880, the Supreme Court of Appeals had done as ordered, setting aside the verdict and sentence of the second trial, and reversing the ruling of the circuit court that had denied to Strauder the removal of the case to federal court. The orders of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of Appeals were entered into the circuit court record on Saturday, August 21, 1880 and the case was ordered to be removed to the U.S. district court.

===Federal court===
On Monday, September 6, 1880, the sheriff of Ohio County was served with a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; to produce Strauder before the U.S. district court the next day and to show cause why he was being held. Over the next two days, before Judge John Jay Jackson Jr., arguments were heard over why the writ should be quashed, the state seeking to maintain its custody of Strauder. Arguments were also heard whether Strauder should be released pending the next hearings, or bail set. On Thursday, September 9, the court denied the state&#x27;s motion to quash the writ, ordered custody of Strauder be transferred to the U.S. Marshal, and that a bail hearing for Strauder be scheduled. By October 9, Judge Jackson denied both discharge and bail.

The case was next heard on Thursday, January 13, 1881, whereupon Strauder entered a plea of abatement to defeat the 1874 indictment on the grounds that it too suffered from the constitutional deficiency passed upon by the Supreme Court—that is, the &quot;venire&quot; from which the grand jury had been drawn in May 1874, subject to the same 1873 jury law, excluded non-whites as jurors. On Saturday, April 30, 1881, Judge Jackson ruled in favor of Strauder, quashing the 1874 indictment and discharging Strauder from federal custody.

===Rearrest===
Anticipating that the federal court would discharge Strauder, the Wheeling Chief of Police Henry Conant swore out in secret a new warrant for Strauder&#x27;s arrest before Aquilla B. Caldwell of the First Judicial Circuit on April 7, 1881. When the federal court then in fact discharged Strauder, Conant immediately moved to rearrest Strauder in the courtroom; Judge Jackson objected, causing Conant to withdraw. Conant instead rearrested Strauder upon his leaving the federal courthouse, and both returned to Wheeling on May 2. The next day, arguments were heard before Judge Caldwell regarding the circuit court&#x27;s jurisdiction. Strauder and his counsel argued that even though the U.S. district court had discharged Strauder, it had only done so on the 1874 indictment, and since the state&#x27;s prosecutor had never made a declaration of &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; or otherwise dismissed the 1872 indictment, and since the entire case had been certified to the federal district court, both the 1872 and 1874 indictments were under the federal court&#x27;s jurisdiction when the April 7 warrant had issued. Further, since the 1872 indictment was still pending before the federal court, it still had jurisdiction over the case. As such, argued Strauder, the state circuit court had no jurisdiction, rendering its warrant invalid. Judge Caldwell ultimately agreed that the 1872 indictment was still alive and before the federal court, and ordered Strauder discharged from state custody, finally freeing Strauder from his nine-years confinement.

==Impact==
While a victory for the rights of black defendants and an important early civil rights case, dicta from &quot;Strauder v. West Virginia&quot; implies the right of states to bar women or other classes from juries by holding, in the words of Justice Strong, that a state &quot;may confine the selection to males, to freeholders, to citizens, to persons within certain ages, or to persons having educational qualifications. We do not believe the Fourteenth Amendment was ever intended to prohibit this... Its aim was against discrimination because of race or color.&quot; The precedent set by &quot;Strauder&quot; has continued to influence rulings in cases as late as 1961 in &quot;Hoyt v. Florida&quot;.

Because it was not raised in the context of &quot;Strauder&quot;, the Court also did not consider in its analysis whether state actions that have a disparate impact upon African-Americans would violate the Equal Protection Clause; that question was not considered until almost a century later in &quot;Washington v. Davis&quot;, which reaffirmed that &quot;Strauder&quot; &quot;established that the exclusion of [African-Americans] from grand and petit juries in criminal proceedings violated the Equal Protection Clause, but the fact that a particular jury or a series of juries does not statistically reflect the racial composition of the community does not, in itself, make out an invidious discrimination forbidden by the Clause.&quot; .

<doc id="1326417" wikidata="Q1640614" url="?curid=1326417" title="John Stallworth">
<text>Johnny Lee Stallworth (born July 15, 1952) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for 14 seasons in the National Football League (NFL) for the Pittsburgh Steelers. He played college football for the Alabama A&amp;M Bulldogs, and was the Steelers&#x27; fourth-round draft pick in 1974. Stallworth played in six AFC championships, and went to four Super Bowls, winning all four. His career statistics included 537 receptions for 8,723 yards and 63 touchdowns. Stallworth&#x27;s reception total was a franchise record until being surpassed by Hines Ward in 2005. Stallworth played in three Pro Bowls and was the Steelers&#x27; two-time MVP. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2002.

==College career==

A native of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Stallworth was an All-Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference receiver for Alabama A&amp;M in 1972 and 1973. Stallworth earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration and an MBA with a concentration in Finance from Alabama A&amp;M University.

He was inducted into the Black College Football Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Professional career==
Stallworth was selected 82nd overall in the fourth round of the 1974 NFL draft, a class of which he was one of four Pittsburgh Steelers picks who would eventually be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Scouts from various NFL teams observed him run the 40-yard dash on a wet track at Alabama A&amp;M University and were disappointed by the results. Steelers assistant personnel director Bill Nunn was the only person to stay an additional day and watched Stallworth run a better time on a dry track. Nunn also had obtained the only college game film of Stallworth that existed through his relationships with HBCU coaches, and it was alleged that he withheld it from other NFL teams. After a rookie year as an understudy, Stallworth became a starter in his second season and held that job for the rest of his 165-game career. Stallworth battled a series of fibula, foot, ankle, knee and hamstring injuries that forced him to miss 44 regular-season games.

===Super Bowls===

In Super Bowl XIII, Stallworth caught a record-tying 75-yard touchdown pass from Terry Bradshaw that was crucial in the 35–31 win over the Dallas Cowboys. He suffered leg cramps later and played sparingly in the second half, finishing with 3 receptions for 115 yards and two touchdowns.

One year later at Super Bowl XIV with the Steelers trailing the Los Angeles Rams 19–17 early in the fourth quarter, Steelers&#x27; coach Chuck Noll called for &quot;60-Prevent-Slot-Hook-And-Go,&quot; a play the Steelers failed in practice before the big game. With 12 minutes remaining, Bradshaw dropped back and threw it long to Stallworth, who caught it and beat Rod Perry to the end zone for a 73-yard touchdown that paved the way for the Steelers&#x27; 31–19 win and their fourth world championship. Sports Illustrated considered the catch notable enough to put Stallworth on the cover of a subsequent issue. Overall, Stallworth recorded three receptions for 121 yards in the game.

Stallworth holds the Super Bowl records for career average per catch (24.4 yards) and single-game average, 40.33 yards in Super Bowl XIV. He has 12 touchdown receptions and a string of 17 straight games with a reception in post-season play. Stallworth also scored on touchdown receptions in eight straight playoff games at one point (1978–1983), an NFL record.

===Other highlights===

Stallworth led the AFC with a career-high 1,395 yards gained on 80 receptions in 1984, when he was named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year. He helped the Steelers defeat eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco for that team&#x27;s only loss of the season, and led the Steelers in a playoff run that featured an upset win over the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional Playoffs at Denver&#x27;s Mile High Stadium.

Stallworth was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August 2002.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Business career==

In 1986, he founded Madison Research Corporation (MRC) alongside Samuel Hazelrig. MRC specializes in providing engineering and information technology services to government and commercial clients. Under Stallworth and Hazelrig&#x27;s leadership, MRC grew to more than 650 employees and $69.5 million in revenues (FY03). MRC manages six regional offices: Huntsville, Alabama (headquarters); Warner Robins, Georgia; Orlando, Florida and Shalimar, Florida; Montgomery, Alabama; Houston, Texas; and Dayton, Ohio. In October 2006 the sale of MRC to Wireless Facilities Inc. was completed, and at that time it was announced that Stallworth would pursue other interests.

Stallworth was announced as becoming part-owner of his former team on March 23, 2009, as part of the Rooney family restructuring ownership of the team.

<doc id="1326423" wikidata="Q1777632" url="?curid=1326423" title="Mike Singletary">
<text>Michael Singletary (born October 9, 1958), nicknamed &quot;Samurai Mike&quot;, is an American former professional football player and coach. He played as a linebacker for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL). After playing college football for the Baylor Bears, Singletary was selected by the Bears in the second round of the 1981 NFL draft and was known as &quot;the Heart of the Defense&quot; for their Monsters of the Midway defense in the mid-1980s. He was part of their Super Bowl XX championship team that beat the New England Patriots. Singletary was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1995 and into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1998.

Singletary later pursued a career as a coach, first as a linebackers coach for the Baltimore Ravens, then as the linebackers coach for the San Francisco 49ers. In 2008, the 49ers promoted Singletary to the head coaching position after previous head coach Mike Nolan was fired during the season, and he remained in that position until he was fired after the 49ers were eliminated from playoff contention with one game remaining in the 2010 season. He has also coached for the Los Angeles Rams, the Memphis Express of the now-defunct Alliance of American Football (AAF), and a brief two-season stint as the head coach of a high school team.

==Early life==
Mike Singletary was born in Houston, the last of ten children. Singletary&#x27;s father, Charles, was a street preacher in Dallas. The family soon settled in Houston. Mike, along with his father, Charles, mother, Rudell, and several brothers and sisters, shared a small wood-frame home. Next to their home was a building called the Church of God, a church that Charles Singletary built himself and where he played guitar each Sunday. During the week, Mike&#x27;s father worked as a contractor.

Tragedy would soon strike the family. Dale Singletary, the third oldest child, died unexpectedly. Dale had been sleeping in a room with James, another brother. Charles Jr. noticed a funny smell coming from the room. By the time Mike and Charles Jr. were able to break a window, and force entry into the room, fumes from the coal stove had claimed the life of Dale. As his relationship with his father drifted, Mike&#x27;s brother Grady stepped in. Grady filled the void, telling young Mike to stay away from vices such as drinking beer and smoking cigarettes. Mike&#x27;s interest in playing football piqued each Sunday, as he would watch the Dallas Cowboys, and idolized players including Roger Staubach, Bob Lilly, and Lee Roy Jordan.

Tragedy re-occurred. Grady, who Mike Singletary had looked up at as a father figure, was killed in a six-car accident caused by a drunk driver. The drunk driver survived the accident uninjured.

Singletary attended high school at Evan E. Worthing High School in Houston. In ninth grade, Mike was an all-state guard and linebacker. As Mike became a star for Worthing High School, an all-black high school, Mike&#x27;s mother became a regular at the football games. Despite early concerns about poor grades affecting Mike&#x27;s eligibility to play football, his grades improved. After a star career at Worthing, Mike found himself with a scholarship to Baylor University, and would meet the next mentor in his life, Baylor coach Grant Teaff.

==College career==
Mike Singletary attended college at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. As a linebacker at Baylor, Singletary earned All-American honors in both junior (1979) and senior (1980) years, where he averaged 15 tackles per game and established a team record with 232 tackles in 1978, including 35 in a game against the University of Houston. During Singletary&#x27;s senior season of 1980, Baylor won 10 games, marking the first time in school history that had been accomplished.

Singletary is the only college junior to be selected to the All-Southwest Conference Team of the 1970s. Singletary is a two-time recipient of the Davey O&#x27;Brien Memorial Trophy, which at the time was awarded to the most outstanding player among those playing in the southwestern United States and had yet to become the quarterback-centric award it is today. Singletary lettered four years. He had 97 tackles as a freshman, 232 (a school record) as a sophomore, then 188 and 145. The total, 662, set a school record. In 1978, he had 35 tackles in a game against Arkansas, 31 against Ohio State. He was all- Southwest Conference three years and All-America two years. In 1979 and 1980, he won the Davey O&#x27;Brien Award, given to the outstanding player in the Southwest. (The award has since been changed to a national quarterback trophy.)

==Professional career==

At , , Singletary became a starting linebacker in the Chicago Bears defense in the eighth game of his rookie season (1981). In a game against the Kansas City Chiefs, his third as a starter, Singletary gave a remarkable defensive performance, recording 10 tackles and forcing a fumble. He was a nearly unanimous all-rookie selection. Singletary started 172 games for the Bears during his 12-year career, the second-most in club history. An intense player, he finished as the Bears&#x27; first- or second-leading tackler each of his last 11 seasons. He amassed an impressive 1,488 career tackles, 885 of which were solo efforts. He missed playing just two games, both in 1986. He made 7 interceptions and 12 fumble recoveries.

In a game against the Denver Broncos in 1990 he had a personal-best performance when he recorded 10 solo tackles and 10 assists. Selected to play in a team record 10 Pro Bowls, Singletary was All-Pro eight times, and All-NFC every year from 1983 to 1991.

He led the Bears to a 15–1 season in 1985. The &quot;46&quot; defense invented by Buddy Ryan allowed Singletary to be unblocked on virtually every play. That season, he recorded 109 solo tackles (52 assists), 3 sacks, 1 interception, 3 fumble recoveries, 1 forced fumble, and 10 defended passes. He won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year, and led a defense that was ranked 1st overall (1st against the rush; 3rd against the pass).

Throughout the 1985 playoffs, Singletary provided stellar efforts in all 3 games. In the divisional game against the New York Giants at home, Singletary recovered a fumble early in the 1st quarter and a sack of quarterback Phil Simms on a 3rd down early in the 3rd quarter. The Bears went on to win 21–0. In the NFC Championship Game vs. the Los Angeles Rams, Singletary and the Bears dominated again. Coach Mike Ditka said that the day before the game, he was talking to the offense while Singletary was in the next room giving the defense a motivational speech. While it started out quiet, within minutes, Samurai Mike was screaming at the top of his lungs and the defensive players were throwing chairs and knocking over tables. The next day, he provided a memorable play where he stopped Eric Dickerson behind the line of scrimmage on third-and-short early in the 2nd quarter. The Bears would eventually go to win Super Bowl XX by beating the New England Patriots 46–10. In the game, Singletary broke up a pass that would have gone for a touchdown, delivered jarring hits to New England running back Craig James all game, and tied a Super Bowl record with 2 fumble recoveries.
Singletary was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year by the Associated Press in 1985 and 1988. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1995 and to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1998. In 1999, he was ranked number 56 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.

==Coaching career==
===Early career===
In 2002, a group of alumni at Baylor University promoted Singletary for the school&#x27;s open head coaching position, holding a conference call (which included Mike Ditka and Dave McGinnis) with the university administration. The position ultimately went to Guy Morriss. Singletary at the time had no head or assistant coaching experience and the university president later stated that they wanted to hire a coach with prior &quot;head coaching experience.&quot;

In 2003, Singletary became the linebackers coach for the Baltimore Ravens.

Following the 2004 season, the San Francisco 49ers hired Ravens defensive coordinator Mike Nolan to be their head coach, and Singletary left the Ravens with Nolan to be San Francisco&#x27;s assistant head coach and linebackers coach.
In 2007, Singletary interviewed for the head coaching job of the Dallas Cowboys and San Diego Chargers, but was ultimately passed over.

With Morriss leaving Baylor after the 2007 season, Singletary appeared to be the leading candidate for his replacement, and expressed interest in the job. On November 19, 2007, Baylor athletic director Ian McCaw flew to San Francisco to interview Singletary. However, Singletary decided against taking the position, which instead went to Art Briles. Singletary&#x27;s son Matt was a freshman on the Baylor team in 2007.

===San Francisco 49ers===
====2008 season====
Singletary became the interim head coach of the 49ers after Nolan was fired on October 20, 2008. Singletary instantly made a statement in San Francisco by sending tight end Vernon Davis to the locker room with more than 10 minutes remaining in his head coaching debut, a 34–13 loss to the Seattle Seahawks on October 26, 2008. Davis was penalized 15 yards for slapping Seattle safety Brian Russell after a reception. In a post-game press conference, Singletary called Davis&#x27; actions &quot;uncoachable&quot; and said that he would rather play with a 10-man squad than have to deal with an apathetic 11-man squad. He boldly declared in that same speech, &quot;I want winners!&quot;, which became a staple on billboards around the Bay Area during his coaching tenure. It was later reported that during halftime of their game against the Seahawks, Singletary intentionally dropped his pants while giving a speech to illustrate just how poorly the 49ers had played in the first half.

Taking over the 2–5 49ers team, Singletary was able to finish the season 5–4 under his leadership (for a final team record of 7–9). On December 28, 2008, after a 27–24 come-from-behind victory over the Washington Redskins, Singletary was offered the team&#x27;s long-term head coaching position, and signed a four-year, $10 million contract as the 49ers&#x27; head coach.

====2009 season====
After leading the 49ers to a positive finish in 2008, Singletary helped the team jump out to a 3–1 overall start in the 2009 season. Despite a last-second loss to the Brett Favre-led Minnesota Vikings in Week 3, the 49ers recorded wins against the reigning NFC champion Arizona Cardinals and NFC West divisional rival Seattle Seahawks and St. Louis Rams.

While the 49ers were being blown out by the visiting Atlanta Falcons in Week 5, Singletary lost his temper over his team&#x27;s poor play; afterward, he expressed remorse for his actions, saying how he wished he &quot;had more coaching etiquette&quot; while reiterating how he would &quot;get better at those things as time goes on.&quot; In the weeks to come, Singletary and offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye would drastically alter the 49ers&#x27; game plan, opting to start quarterback Alex Smith in place of Shaun Hill while adopting more of a spread offense. The new game plan had mixed results, as the 49ers posted a 2–5 record from Week 7 to Week 13 and struggled to maintain their playoff hopes. In a Week 14 Monday Night Football matchup against the Arizona Cardinals, however, Singletary and his coaching staff were better able to integrate running back Frank Gore into the spread offense and pulled off an impressive 24–9 victory.

With this momentum and their slim playoff hopes still alive, the 49ers visited the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 15, and lost 27–13. After the game, a disappointed Singletary emphasized his team&#x27;s continued need to improve, but still backed Smith as the team&#x27;s starting quarterback. Singletary helped the 49ers end the season on a high note with victories against the Detroit Lions and St. Louis Rams to reach 8–8, the team&#x27;s first non-losing season since 2002.

Five players on the 2009 team were named to play in the NFL Pro Bowl. Those players were Patrick Willis, Andy Lee, Vernon Davis, Frank Gore, and Justin Smith.

Also in 2009, Singletary joined other members of the 1985 Chicago Bears in resurrecting the Super Bowl Shuffle for a Boost Mobile commercial broadcast during Super Bowl XLIV.

====2010 season====
The 49ers began the 2010 season with an 0–5 record, marking their worst start since 1979. The team&#x27;s first win of the season came in Week 6 by defeating the Oakland Raiders. In Week 10, San Francisco narrowly defeated the St. Louis Rams, 23–20 in overtime. At home, the 49ers suffered their first home shut out since October 3, 1977, in a 21–0 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 21. A rematch occurred with the Rams on December 26, which the 49ers lost 25–17, eliminating them from playoff contention. After the game the 49ers fired Singletary. Defensive line coach Jim Tomsula took over for the final week of the season.

===Minnesota Vikings===
On January 18, 2011, Singletary confirmed that he had agreed to join the Minnesota Vikings coaching staff as the linebackers coach/assistant to the head coach, former Bears teammate Leslie Frazier, a position he would hold through the 2013 season.

===Los Angeles Rams===
After being out of the league since 2014, Singletary interviewed with the New York Giants for their vacant linebacking coach position. Giants head coach Ben McAdoo and Singletary both worked together with the 49ers in 2005. The Giants eventually hired former Philadelphia Eagles assistant Bill McGovern for the position.

On June 28, 2016, Singletary announced in an interview with a radio station that he would be returning to the coaching ranks as an advisor for the Los Angeles Rams defense. The move reunited Singletary with former Bears teammate and then-Rams head coach Jeff Fisher.

===Memphis Express===
On May 10, 2018, Singletary was named head coach of the Memphis Express of the Alliance of American Football. The Express went 2–6 before the league cancelled the rest of the season. The league eventually ceased operations altogether.

===High school coaching===
On March 29, 2018, Singletary accepted a job at Trinity Christian Academy in Addison, Texas. He left the school in December 2019 after going 1–21 in two seasons.

==Personal life==
Singletary, an ordained minister, is a devout evangelical Christian. Singletary said in an interview with the 700 Club, &quot;To me, Christ means everything. I know that He&#x27;s got my back no matter what I do. So that gives me all the freedom in the world to be the man that He&#x27;s called me to be.&quot;

Singletary and his wife, Kim, have seven children. His son Matt joined Baylor University&#x27;s roster in 2007 as a freshman defensive end. However, Matt transferred to California Polytechnic State University where he was a defensive end. Singletary&#x27;s nephew, Vantz, is a linebackers coach at Liberty University and previously coached under Mike when he coached with the 49ers.

<text>The Dutch underground press was part of the resistance to the German occupation of the Netherlands during World War II, paralleling the emergence of underground media across German-occupied Europe.

After the occupation of the Netherlands in May 1940, the Germans quickly took control over the existing Dutch press and enforced censorship and publication of Nazi propaganda. In response, independent Dutch citizens organized uncensored publishing of their own illegal papers. These papers were cherished by the population, and were better trusted than the official papers. Issues were distributed and passed on, even though there were heavy penalties (including the death penalty) for those involved with illegal anti-Nazi publications.

Some of modern-day Netherlands press and magazine originate from this period, including:
*&quot;Trouw&quot;,
*&quot;Het Parool&quot;
*&quot;Vrij Nederland&quot; 

A collection is maintained in the British Library in London and by the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam.

<doc id="1326425" wikidata="Q1192885" url="?curid=1326425" title="Asa Earl Carter">
<text>Asa Earl Carter (September 4, 1925 – June 7, 1979) was an American segregationist and Ku Klux Klan organizer who was prominent in the 1950s for his activism and later as a Western fiction novelist, known as a co-writer of George Wallace&#x27;s well-known pro-segregation line of 1963, &quot;Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.&quot; He ran in the Democratic primary for governor of Alabama as a white supremacist. Later, under the pseudonym of supposedly Cherokee writer Forrest Carter, he wrote &quot;The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales&quot; (1972), a Western novel that was adapted into a 1976 film featuring Clint Eastwood that was added to the National Film Registry, and &quot;The Education of Little Tree&quot; (1976), a best-selling, award-winning book which was marketed as a memoir but which turned out to be fiction.

In 1976, following the success of &quot;The Rebel Outlaw&quot; and its film adaptation, &quot;The New York Times&quot; revealed Forrest Carter was actually Asa Carter. His background became national news again in 1991 after his purported memoir, &quot;The Education of Little Tree&quot; (1976), was re-issued in paperback, topping the &quot;Times&quot; paperback best-seller lists (both non-fiction and fiction) and winning the American Booksellers Book of the Year (ABBY) award.

Prior to his literary career as &quot;Forrest&quot;, Carter was politically active for years in Alabama as an opponent of the civil rights movement. In the mid-1950s, he had a syndicated segregationist radio show, and worked as a speech writer for segregationist Governor George Wallace of Alabama. He also founded the North Alabama Citizens Council (NACC), an independent offshoot of the White Citizens&#x27; Council movement formed by Carter when the White Citizens&#x27; Council tried to moderate Carter&#x27;s antisemitism. He also formed the militant and violent Ku Klux Klan group known as the Original Ku Klux Klan of the Confederacy, and started a monthly publication titled &quot;The Southerner&quot; which spread white supremacist and anti-communist rhetoric.

==Early life==
Asa Carter was born in Anniston, Alabama in 1925, the second eldest of four children. Despite later claims (as author &quot;Forrest&quot; Carter) that he was orphaned, he was raised by his parents Hermione and Ralph Carter in nearby Oxford, Alabama. Both parents lived into Carter&#x27;s adulthood.

Carter served in the United States Navy during World War II and for a year studied journalism at the University of Colorado at Boulder on the G.I. Bill. After the war, he married India Thelma Walker. The couple settled in Birmingham, Alabama and had four children. His children were Ralph Walker Carter, Asa Earl Carter, both of Abilene, and Bedford Forrest Carter of Alabama; one daughter, India Lara Morgan of Jacksonville, Ala.

==Career==
Carter worked for several area radio stations before ending up at station WILD in Birmingham, where he worked from 1953 to 1955. Carter&#x27;s broadcasts from WILD, sponsored by the American States Rights Association, were syndicated to more than 20 radio stations before the show was cancelled. Carter was fired following community outrage over his attacks on National Brotherhood Week, which promoted friendship with the Jewish community, and a boycott of WILD. Carter broke with the leadership of the Alabama Citizens&#x27; Council movement over the incident. He refused to reduce his antisemitic rhetoric, and the Citizens&#x27; Council preferred to focus on preserving racial segregation against African Americans.

Carter started a renegade group called the North Alabama Citizens&#x27; Council. In addition to his careers in broadcasting and politics, Carter during these years ran a filling station. By March 1956, he was making national news as a spokesman for segregation. Carter was quoted by United Press International as saying that the NAACP had &quot;infiltrated&quot; Southern white teenagers with &quot;immoral&quot; rock and roll records. Carter called for jukebox owners to purge all records by black performers from jukeboxes.

Carter made the national news again on September 1 and 2 of the same year, after he gave an inflammatory anti-integration speech in Clinton, Tennessee. He addressed Clinton&#x27;s high school enrollment of 12 black students, and after his speech, an aroused mob of 200 white men stopped black drivers passing through, &quot;ripping out hood ornaments and smashing windows&quot;. They were heading for the house of the mayor before being turned back by the local sheriff. Carter appeared in Clinton alongside segregationist John Kasper, who was charged later that same month with sedition and inciting a riot for his activities that day. Later that year, Carter ran for a position on the Birmingham City Commission as the Commissioner For Public Safety against former office holder Eugene &quot;Bull&quot; Connor, who won that election in 1957. As with most elections during this time of poll taxes and segregation, the only competitive campaigning was done for the Democratic Party primary. Connor later became nationally famous for his heavy-handed approach to law enforcement during the civil rights struggles in Birmingham. Carter siphoned away some of the &quot;white lower-status vote&quot; from Connor, but finished a distant last in the primary, an indication that his style was becoming unacceptable to Alabama&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;respectable&#x27; segregationists.&quot; 
In 1957, Carter and his brother James were jailed for fighting against Birmingham police officers. The police were trying to apprehend another of the six in their group, who was wanted for a suspected Ku Klux Klan (KKK) shooting. The two men were both later found guilty of disorderly conduct and interfering with an officer and each fined $25. Also during the mid-1950s, Carter founded a paramilitary KKK splinter group, called the &quot;Original Ku Klux Klan of the Confederacy&quot;. Carter started a monthly publication entitled &quot;The Southerner&quot;, devoted to purportedly scientific theories of white racial superiority, as well as to anti-communist rhetoric.

In April 1956, members of Carter&#x27;s new KKK group attacked singer Nat King Cole on stage at a Birmingham concert. In September 1957, six members of Carter&#x27;s Klan group abducted and attacked a black handyman named Judge Edward Aaron. They castrated Aaron, poured turpentine on his wounds, and left him abandoned in the trunk of a car near Springdale, Alabama. Police found Aaron, near death from blood loss. Carter was not with the men who carried out this attack. Four of the six involved were convicted of mayhem and sentenced to 20 years, but in 1963, a parole board, appointed by Carter&#x27;s then-employer Alabama governor George Wallace, commuted their sentences.
In 1958, Carter quit the Klan group he had founded after shooting two members in a dispute over finances. Birmingham police filed attempted murder charges against Carter, but the charges were subsequently dropped. Carter also ran a campaign for lieutenant governor the same year that saw him finish fifth in a field of five.

During the 1960s, Carter was a speechwriter for Wallace. He was one of two men credited with Wallace&#x27;s famous slogan &quot;Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever&quot;, part of Wallace&#x27;s 1963 inaugural speech. Carter continued to work for Wallace, and after Wallace&#x27;s wife Lurleen was elected governor of Alabama in 1966, Carter worked for her. Wallace never acknowledged the role Carter played in his political career:

Till the day he died, George Wallace denied that he ever knew Asa Carter. He may have been telling the truth. &#x27;Ace&#x27;, as he was called by the staff, was paid off indirectly by Wallace cronies, and the only record that he ever wrote for Wallace was the word of former Wallace campaign officials such as finance manager Seymore Trammell.

When Wallace decided to enter national politics with a 1968 presidential run, he did not invite Carter on board for the campaign, as he sought to tone down his reputation as a segregationist firebrand. During the late 1960s, Carter grew disillusioned by what he saw as Wallace&#x27;s liberal turn on race.

Carter ran against Wallace for governor of Alabama in 1970 on a white supremacist platform. Carter finished a distant fourth in the Democratic primary, winning only 1.51% of the vote; Wallace narrowly won the primary in a runoff over the more moderate incumbent governor Albert Brewer. At Wallace&#x27;s 1971 inauguration, Carter and some of his supporters demonstrated against him, carrying signs reading &quot;Wallace is a bigot&quot; and &quot;Free our white children&quot;. The demonstration was the last notable public appearance by &quot;Asa Carter&quot;.

==Literary career and death==
After losing the election, Carter moved to Abilene, Texas, where he started over. He began work on his first novel, spending days researching in a public library in Sweetwater, Texas. He distanced himself from his past, began to call his sons &quot;nephews&quot; and renamed himself Forrest Carter, after Nathan Bedford Forrest, a general of the Confederate army who fought in the Civil War, and the first leader of the Ku Klux Klan.

Carter moved to St. George&#x27;s Island, Florida in the 1970s where he completed a sequel to his first novel, as well as two books on American Indian themes. Carter separated from his wife, who remained in Florida. In the late 1970s, he again settled in Abilene, Texas.

Carter&#x27;s best-known fictional works are &quot;The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales&quot; (1972, republished in 1975 as &quot;Gone to Texas&quot;) and &quot;The Education of Little Tree&quot; (1976), the latter book originally published as a memoir. Although &quot;Little Tree&quot; sold modestly during Carter&#x27;s life, it became a sleeper hit after his death.

Clint Eastwood directed and starred in a film adaptation of &quot;Josey Wales&quot;, retitled &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; (1976) after Carter sent the book to his offices as an unsolicited submission, and Eastwood&#x27;s partner read and put his support behind it. At this time, neither man knew of Carter&#x27;s past as a Klansman and rabid segregationist. In 1997, after the success of the paperback edition of &quot;The Education of Little Tree&quot;, a film adaptation was produced. Originally intended as a TV movie, it was given a theatrical release.

Carter&#x27;s sequel to &quot;The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales&quot;, titled &quot;The Vengeance Trail of Josey Wales&quot; (1976), was planned by Clint Eastwood as a film project, but the project was cancelled. The author&#x27;s &quot;Watch for Me on the Mountain&quot; (1978) is a fictionalized biography of Geronimo. It was reprinted in 1980 in an edition titled &quot;Cry Geronimo!&quot;

Carter was working on &quot;The Wanderings of Little Tree&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Education of Little Tree&quot;, as well as a screenplay version of the book, when he died in Abilene on June 7, 1979. The cause of death was reported to have been heart failure. However, the ambulance driver told one of Carter’s friends that he had a drunken fight with his son, fell, and choked on his own vomit. Carter&#x27;s body was returned to Alabama for burial near Anniston, Alabama.

==Controversy and criticism==
Carter spent the last part of his life trying to conceal his background as a Klansman and segregationist, claiming categorically in a 1976 &quot;New York Times&quot; article that he, Forrest, was not Asa Carter. The article describes a 1974 interview of Carter by Barbara Walters on the &quot;Today&quot; show, where Carter was under the name &quot;Forrest&quot; while promoting &quot;The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; reported that Carter, who had run for governor of Alabama (as Asa Carter) just four years earlier, was identified by several Alabama politicians, reporters, and law enforcement officials who watched the &quot;Today&quot; show segment as being the same person as Asa Carter. The &quot;Times&quot; also reported that the address Carter used in the copyright application for &quot;The Rebel Outlaw&quot; was identical to the one that he used in 1970 while running for governor. &quot;Beyond denying that he is Asa Carter,&quot; the article noted, &quot;the author has declined to be interviewed on the subject.&quot;

In 1985, Carter&#x27;s autobiography was purchased for a paperback edition and marketed by the University of New Mexico Press as a memoir. It was subtitled &quot;A True Story by Forrest Carter&quot;. The story described the relationship between the boy and his Scottish-Cherokee grandfather, a man named Wales (an overlap with Carter&#x27;s other fiction). Written from the perspective of a boy orphaned at age five, the book described how he had become accustomed to life in a remote mountain hollow with his &quot;Indian thinking&quot; &quot;Granpa&quot; and Cherokee &quot;Granma&quot;, who called him &quot;Little Tree&quot;. Granpa runs a small whiskey operation during Prohibition and the later years of the Great Depression. The grandparents and visitors to the hollow expose Little Tree to (supposed) Cherokee ways and &quot;mountain people&quot; values. The state removes him to an orphanage, where he stays for a few months until an old Indian friend intimidates the director into allowing Little Tree&#x27;s release. (In life, Carter was neither orphaned nor raised by Cherokee grandparents.)

Before taking a new name and identity, Carter had claimed to have distant maternal Cherokee ancestry, a claim corroborated by some of his family members. Delacorte Press&#x27;s original author biography referred to Carter as the Cherokee &quot;Storyteller in Council&quot;. Members of the Cherokee nation have disputed his claim; they said so-called &quot;Cherokee&quot; words and customs in &quot;The Education of Little Tree&quot; are inaccurate, and the novel&#x27;s characters are stereotyped. Several scholars and critics agreed with this assessment, adding that Carter&#x27;s treatment of Native Americans repeated the romanticized notion of the &quot;Noble Savage&quot;.

In 1985, the University of New Mexico Press bought rights to &quot;The Education of Little Tree&quot; from original publisher Delacorte Press and published it in paperback. By its second year, the new paperback edition began to sell briskly through word-of-mouth publicity, with sales eventually surpassing 600,000. Though Carter&#x27;s background as Asa Carter was discussed in academic circles, it was not widely known by the book-buying public nearly ten years after the 1976 &quot;New York Times&quot; article about him. In 1991, after the book won the American Booksellers Book of the Year (ABBY) award, it ranked number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; non-fiction paperback best-seller list for several weeks.

On October 4, 1991, Dan T. Carter, a history professor who speculated that, based on their shared heritage, he may be a distant cousin of Asa Carter (the supposition has since been stated elsewhere as fact), published the article &quot;The Transformation of a Klansman&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. This article shed light on Asa Carter&#x27;s dual identity, and &quot;The Times&quot; shifted the book onto its fiction list. Scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr. also wrote an article on Carter and &quot;Little Tree&quot; for &quot;The Times&quot; that appeared in November 1991.

A film adaptation of &quot;Little Tree&quot; (1997), revived publicity about Asa Carter. His widow India Carter refused most interview requests during these years, but confirmed to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; in 1991 that Forrest and Asa were the same person. Eleanor Friede, &quot;Little Tree&quot;″s original editor, defended Carter&#x27;s background in 1997, telling the &quot;Times&quot;: &quot;[H]e was not a member of the Ku Klux Klan. I honestly don&#x27;t see the point of all this nasty gossip dragged out years ago.&quot;

Following the 1991 publicity, the University of New Mexico Press changed the cover of &quot;Little Tree&quot;, removing the &quot;True Story&quot; subtitle and adding a fiction classification label. &quot;Little Tree&quot; has continued to find readers and a place on reading lists for young adults since 1991. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., argued that &quot;Little Tree&quot; can be appreciated for its message of tolerance and its other qualities despite its creator&#x27;s former life.

Richard Friedenberg wrote and directed the 1997 film adaptation. He also has defended the book, but not the author:
Mr. Friedenberg said what appealed to him about the book was that &quot;the characters and milieu they were in represented everything that was good about America and everything that was bad.&quot; On the one hand, he said, the book dealt with the strength of the family and not necessarily with traditional families. On the other hand, he said, it dealt with ignorance and prejudice. Mr. Friedenberg said he found it perplexing and almost impossible to understand Mr. Carter&#x27;s motives and literary ambitions. Although Mr. Carter, who wrote four books, failed to address the issue of his bigotry publicly, Mr. Friedenberg said he believed that &quot;his apology was in his literature.&quot; For example, he said, the handful of Blacks and Jews in his books are depicted sympathetically. &quot;The bad guys are almost, without fail, rich whites, politicians and phony preachers,&quot; Mr. Friedenberg said.

Oprah Winfrey, who endorsed &quot;Little Tree&quot; in 1994, later removed it from her list of recommended book titles:
&quot;I no longer—even though I had been moved by the story—felt the same about this book,&quot; Winfrey said in 1994. &quot;There&#x27;s a part of me that said, &#x27;Well, OK, if a person has two sides of them and can write this wonderful story and also write the segregation forever speech, maybe that&#x27;s OK.&#x27; But I couldn&#x27;t—I couldn&#x27;t live with that.

The book has also been criticized on literary grounds: &quot;I am surprised, of course, that Winfrey would recommend it,&quot; said Loriene Roy, president of the American Library Association. &quot;Besides the questions about the author&#x27;s identity, the book is known for a simplistic plot that used a lot of stereotypical imagery.&quot;

<doc id="1326431" wikidata="Q705517" url="?curid=1326431" title="Art Donovan">
<text>Arthur James &quot;Fatso&quot; Donovan Jr. (June 5, 1924 – August 4, 2013), was an American professional football player who was a defensive tackle for three National Football League (NFL) teams, primarily the Baltimore Colts. He played college football for the Boston College Eagles. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1968.

==Early life==
Art Donovan, born June 5, 1924, was the son of Arthur Donovan Sr., a boxing referee, and the grandson of Professor Mike Donovan, the world middleweight boxing champion in the 1870s.

Art attended Mount Saint Michael Academy in the Bronx.

Donovan received a scholarship to the University of Notre Dame in 1942 but owing to the outbreak of war he left after one semester to join the United States Marine Corps, enlisting in April 1943. He remained under colors for four years, serving in the Pacific Theatre during World War II. He took part in some of the conflict&#x27;s fiercest engagements, such as the Battle of Luzon and the Battle of Iwo Jima. He also served as an ammo-loader on a 40mm gun on the aircraft carrier and as a member of 3rd Marine Division.

His earned citations, which included the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal and the Philippine Liberation Medal, and would later earn him a place in the U.S. Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame, the first pro football player so honored. After the war, he completed his college career at Boston College.

==Professional career==

In each of his first three seasons, Donovan played for a team that went out of business. He started out with the first Baltimore Colts, which folded after his rookie season in 1950. Players formerly on the Colts roster were dispersed throughout the league via the 1951 NFL draft, with Donovan redrafted by the Cleveland Browns with the last pick of the fourth round in January.

At the end of August, the Browns still held 40 players on their roster. Donovan, together with teammate Sisto Averno, were sent by the world champs to the weak sister of the league, the New York Yanks, apparently without receiving significant compensation.

Donovan would spend the 1951 with the Yanks, and their successor, the Dallas Texans, in 1952.

After the Texans franchise folded, many of their players moved to Baltimore when the Colts were awarded a new franchise in 1953 and became the second Baltimore Colts, Donovan played with that team. He became one of the stars in an outstanding defense and was selected to five straight Pro Bowls, from 1953 through 1957. The Colts won back-to-back championships in 1958 and 1959. He was selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1968. He was runner up as best defensive tackle on the NFL 50th Anniversary All-Time Team.

During his career, Donovan played in what many believe was one of the most important games in NFL history, the 1958 NFL Championship Game between the Colts and the New York Giants. The contest between the two teams took place on December 28, 1958, and ended in a 17–17 tie. Being the championship game, it went into overtime, the first NFL game to do so. Witnessed by 40 million viewers on nationwide television, the game came to be known as the &quot;greatest game ever played.&quot; Donovan made an important tackle during the overtime, stopping the Giants and allowing Johnny Unitas to lead the Colts on an 80-yard scoring drive to win the game. Donovan was one of 12 Hall of Fame players to take part, six of whom were Colts.

==Post-playing career==

He published an autobiography, &quot;Fatso&quot;, in 1987. He was noted as a jovial and humorous person during his playing career and capitalized on that with television and speaking appearances after retiring as a player. He owned and managed a country club near Baltimore. Donovan also appeared ten times on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, telling humorous stories about his old playing days and about other footballers he played with and against in his time. He relayed a story that he played without a helmet and in fact is shown on football cards without a helmet. Letterman wore Donovan&#x27;s No. 70 Colts jersey in the famous Super Bowl XLI commercial with Oprah Winfrey and Jay Leno. Donovan also made several appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

Donovan guest-starred in the Nickelodeon show &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; in the episode &quot;Space, Geeks, and Johnny Unitas&quot;. He also appeared as a guest commentator at the WWF King of the Ring tournament in 1994. Donovan&#x27;s appearance at the event would become infamous among wrestling fans for being seemingly uninformed about the product as well as generally befuddled behavior such as repeatedly asking how much certain wrestlers weighed. He was joined by Gorilla Monsoon on play-by-play, who inadvertently referred to Donovan as &quot;Art O&#x27;Donnell&quot;, and Randy Savage.

He was co-host of the popular 1990s program &quot;Braase, Donovan, Davis and Fans&quot; on WJZ-TV in Baltimore with Colt teammate Ordell Braase. The trio talked more about Art Donovan&#x27;s fabled stories than contemporary NFL football, but the show held high ratings in its time slot. He was also a pitchman for the Maryland State Lottery and ESPN.

He has beeen interviewed )nNPR&#x27;s Weekend Edition Saturday].

==Personal==
Donovan was married to the former Dorothy Schaech for 57 years. Since 1955 they owned and managed the Valley Country Club in Towson, Maryland. Although he was the owner, Donovan was known for doing manual labor at the club to include painting and working in the kitchen washing pots and pans.

==Death and legacy==
Donovan died August 4, 2013, at Stella Maris Hospice in Baltimore from a respiratory disease at age 89. A funeral mass was held at the Cathedral of Mary our Queen in Baltimore, and he was buried in a private ceremony at Dulaney Valley Memorial Gardens. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said of Donovan:

<text>Bellmark Records was a small American independent record label, based in Los Angeles, California. It was formed in 1989 by Al Bell, who was one of the driving forces behind Stax Records, having been its chairman and CEO, and who had also been president of Motown Records. The company&#x27;s name was derived from the phrase &quot;Al Bell Marketing&quot;. Initially, Bellmark&#x27;s records were distributed by CEMA, but the company switched to independent distribution in 1991.

The Bellmark Records organization included the Bellmark Records label itself, which was intended to be used for gospel and spiritual music, as well as the Life Records imprint, which was intended for other genres of African-American music; however, the overall manufacturing and marketing arm of the corporation went by the &quot;Bellmark&quot; name. Bellmark also had manufacturing, marketing, and distribution arrangements with a variety of labels, among them TMR Records. Bell said in a 1994 profile that he wanted to emphasize &quot;positive, fun, entertaining party music&quot;.

The biggest hit records distributed by Bellmark were &quot;Dazzey Duks&quot; by Duice, on the TMR label, which was certified double platinum; &quot;Whoomp! (There It Is)&quot; by Tag Team, on the Life label, which was certified quadruple platinum; and &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot; by Prince, on the NPG label. When Prince secured permission from Warner Bros. Records to release the latter song independently, Levi Seacer, president of Prince&#x27;s NPG Records, arranged with Bellmark to distribute &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot; as a single, as well as &quot;The Beautiful Experience&quot;, an EP of remixes of the song. &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot; was a #3 hit in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified gold. &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot; was Prince&#x27;s last top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 of his lifetime.

Some of Bellmark&#x27;s gospel artists received Grammy nominations: The Rance Allen Group was nominated for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album for &quot;Phenomenon&quot; (1991), Walter Hawkins and the Hawkins Family were nominated for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album for &quot;New Dawning&quot; (1996), and the Edwin Hawkins Music &amp; Arts Seminar was nominated for Best Gospel Album by a Choir or Chorus for &quot;All Things Are Possible&quot; (1996).

In 1994, Bellmark collaborated with Walt Disney Records on an album titled &quot;Mickey Unrapped&quot;, which featured parodies of rap songs, among them &quot;Whoomp! (There It Went)&quot;, performed by Tag Team with Disney characters. This was the first time Walt Disney Records had collaborated with another record label on a non-soundtrack release.

In 1997, Bellmark Records filed for bankruptcy. As a result, DM Records, Inc. purchased substantially all of Bellmark’s assets for $166,000 in 1999.

<doc id="1326443" wikidata="Q285861" url="?curid=1326443" title="B+ tree">
<text>A B+ tree is an m-ary tree with a variable but often large number of children per node. A B+ tree consists of a root, internal nodes and leaves. The root may be either a leaf or a node with two or more children.

A B+ tree can be viewed as a B-tree in which each node contains only keys (not key–value pairs), and to which an additional level is added at the bottom with linked leaves.

The primary value of a B+ tree is in storing data for efficient retrieval in a block-oriented storage context — in particular, filesystems. This is primarily because unlike binary search trees, B+ trees have very high fanout (number of pointers to child nodes in a node, typically on the order of 100 or more), which reduces the number of I/O operations required to find an element in the tree.

==History==
There is no single paper introducing the B+ tree concept. Instead, the notion of maintaining all data in leaf nodes is repeatedly brought up as an interesting variant of the B-tree, which was introduced by R. Bayer and E. McCreight. Douglas Comer notes in an early survey of B-trees (which also covers B+ trees) that the B+ tree was used in IBM&#x27;s VSAM data access software, and refers to an IBM published article from 1973.

==Structure==
=== Pointer structure ===

As with other trees, B+ trees can be represented as a collection of three types of nodes: &quot;root&quot;, &quot;internal&quot; (a.k.a. interior), and &quot;leaf&quot;. In B+ trees, the following properties are maintained for these nodes:

* If formula_1 exists in any node in a B+ tree, then formula_2 exists in that node where formula_3.
* All leaf nodes have the same number of ancestors (i.e., they are all at the same depth).

The pointer properties of nodes are summarized in the tables below:

* : Maximum number of potential search keys for each node in a B+ tree. (this value is constant over the entire tree).
* formula_4: The pointer at the zero-based node index formula_5.
* formula_6: The search key at the zero-based node index formula_5.


=== Node bounds ===
The node bounds are summarized in the table below:

===Intervals in internal nodes===


By definition, each value contained within the B+ tree is a key contained in exactly one leaf node. Each key is required to be directly comparable with every other key, which forms a total order. This enables each leaf node to keep all of its keys sorted at all times, which then enables each internal node to construct an ordered collection of intervals representing the contiguous extent of values contained in a given leaf. Internal nodes higher in the tree can then construct their own intervals, which recursively aggregate the intervals contained in their own child internal nodes. Eventually, the root of a B+ Tree represents the whole range of values in the tree, where every internal node represents a subinterval.

For this recursive interval information to be retained, internal nodes must additionally contain formula_8 copies of keys formula_9 for formula_10 representing the least element within the interval covered by the child with index (which may itself be an internal node, or a leaf). Where represents the &quot;actual&quot; number of children for a given internal node.

==Characteristics==
The &quot;order&quot; or &quot;branching factor&quot; of a B+ tree measures the capacity of interior nodes, i.e. their maximum allowed number of direct child nodes. This value is constant over the entire tree. For a -order B+ tree with levels of index: 
* The maximum number of records stored is formula_11
* The minimum number of records stored is formula_12
* The minimum number of keys is formula_13
* The maximum number of keys is formula_14
* The space required to store the tree is formula_15
* Inserting a record requires formula_16 operations
* Finding a record requires formula_16 operations
* Removing a (previously located) record requires formula_16 operations
* Performing a range query with &quot;k&quot; elements occurring within the range requires formula_19 operations
* The B+ tree structure expands/contracts as the number of records increases/decreases. There are no restrictions on the size of B+ trees. Thus, increasing usability of a database system.
* Any change in structure does not affect performance due to balanced tree properties.
* The data is stored in the leaf nodes and more branching of internal nodes helps to reduce the tree&#x27;s height, thus, reduce search time. As a result, it works well in secondary storage devices.
* Searching becomes extremely simple because all records are stored only in the leaf node and are sorted sequentially in the linked list.
* We can retrieve range retrieval or partial retrieval using B+ tree. This is made easier and faster by traversing the tree structure. This feature makes B+ tree structure applied in many search methods.

==Algorithms==

===Search===
We are looking for a value in the B+ Tree. This means that starting from the root, we are looking for the leaf which may contain the value . At each node, we figure out which internal node we should follow. An internal B+ Tree node has at most formula_20 children, where every one of them represents a different sub-interval. We select the corresponding child via a linear search of the entries, then when we finally get to a leaf, we do a linear search of its elements for the desired key. Because we only traverse one branch of all the children at each rung of the tree, we achieve formula_21 runtime, where is the total number of keys stored in the leaves of the B+ tree.

 function search(&quot;k&quot;, &quot;root&quot;) is
 let leaf = leaf_search(k, root)
 for leaf_key in leaf.keys():
 if k = leaf_key:
 return true
 return false

 function leaf_search(&quot;k&quot;, &quot;node&quot;) is
 if node is a leaf:
 return node
 let p = node.children()
 let l = node.left_sided_intervals()
 assert formula_22
 let m = p.len()
 for i from 1 to m - 1:
 if formula_23:
 return leaf_search(k, p[i])
 return leaf_search(k, p[m])

Note that this pseudocode uses 1-based array indexing.

===Insertion===
* Perform a search to determine which node the new record should go into.
* If the node is not full (at most formula_24 entries after the insertion), add the record.
* Otherwise, &quot;before&quot; inserting the new record
** Split the node.
*** original node has formula_25 items
*** new node has formula_26 items
** Copy formula_25-th key to the parent, and insert the new node to the parent.
** Repeat until a parent is found that need not split.
** Insert the new record into the new node.
* If the root splits, treat it as if it has an empty parent and split as outlined above.
B+ trees grow at the root and not at the leaves.

===Bulk-loading===
Given a collection of data records, we want to create a B+ tree index on some key field. One approach is to insert each record into an empty tree. However, it is quite expensive, because each entry requires us to start from the root and go down to the appropriate leaf page. An efficient alternative is to use bulk-loading.
* The first step is to sort the data entries according to a search key in ascending order.
* We allocate an empty page to serve as the root, and insert a pointer to the first page of entries into it.
* When the root is full, we split the root, and create a new root page.
* Keep inserting entries to the right most index page just above the leaf level, until all entries are indexed.

Note :
* when the right-most index page above the leaf level fills up, it is split;
* this action may, in turn, cause a split of the right-most index page one step closer to the root;
* splits only occur on the right-most path from the root to the leaf level.

=== Deletion ===
The purpose of the delete algorithm is to remove the desired entry node from the tree structure. We recursively call the delete algorithm on the appropriate node until no node is found. For each function call, we traverse along, using the index to navigate until we find the node, remove it, and then work back up to the root.

At entry L that we wish to remove:

- If L is at least half-full, done

- If L has only d-1 entries, try to re-distribute, borrowing from sibling (adjacent node with same parent as L).

           After the re-distribution of two sibling nodes happens, the parent node must be updated to reflect this change. The index key that points to the second sibling must take the smallest value of that node to be the index key.

- If re-distribute fails, merge L and sibling. After merging, the parent node is updated by deleting the index key that point to the deleted entry. In other words, if merge occurred, must delete entry (pointing to L or sibling) from parent of L.

Note: merge could propagate to root, which means decreasing height.
==Implementation==
The leaves (the bottom-most index blocks) of the B+ tree are often linked to one another in a linked list; this makes range queries or an (ordered) iteration through the blocks simpler and more efficient (though the aforementioned upper bound can be achieved even without this addition). This does not substantially increase space consumption or maintenance on the tree. This illustrates one of the significant advantages of a B+tree over a B-tree; in a B-tree, since not all keys are present in the leaves, such an ordered linked list cannot be constructed. A B+tree is thus particularly useful as a database system index, where the data typically resides on disk, as it allows the B+tree to actually provide an efficient structure for housing the data itself (this is described in as index structure &quot;Alternative 1&quot;).

If a storage system has a block size of B bytes, and the keys to be stored have a size of k, arguably the most efficient B+ tree is one where formula_28. Although theoretically the one-off is unnecessary, in practice there is often a little extra space taken up by the index blocks (for example, the linked list references in the leaf blocks). Having an index block which is slightly larger than the storage system&#x27;s actual block represents a significant performance decrease; therefore erring on the side of caution is preferable.

If nodes of the B+ tree are organized as arrays of elements, then it may take a considerable time to insert or delete an element as half of the array will need to be shifted on average. To overcome this problem, elements inside a node can be organized in a binary tree or a B+ tree instead of an array.

B+ trees can also be used for data stored in RAM. In this case a reasonable choice for block size would be the size of processor&#x27;s cache line.

Space efficiency of B+ trees can be improved by using some compression techniques. One possibility is to use delta encoding to compress keys stored into each block. For internal blocks, space saving can be achieved by either compressing keys or pointers. For string keys, space can be saved by using the following technique: Normally the &quot;i&quot;-th entry of an internal block contains the first key of block . Instead of storing the full key, we could store the shortest prefix of the first key of block that is strictly greater (in lexicographic order) than last key of block &quot;i&quot;. There is also a simple way to compress pointers: if we suppose that some consecutive blocks are stored contiguously, then it will suffice to store only a pointer to the first block and the count of consecutive blocks.

All the above compression techniques have some drawbacks. First, a full block must be decompressed to extract a single element. One technique to overcome this problem is to divide each block into sub-blocks and compress them separately. In this case searching or inserting an element will only need to decompress or compress a sub-block instead of a full block. Another drawback of compression techniques is that the number of stored elements may vary considerably from a block to another depending on how well the elements are compressed inside each block.

== Applications ==
=== Filesystems ===
The ReiserFS, NSS, XFS, JFS, ReFS, and BFS filesystems all use this type of tree for metadata indexing; BFS also uses B+ trees for storing directories. NTFS uses B+ trees for directory and security-related metadata indexing. EXT4 uses extent trees (a modified B+ tree data structure) for file extent indexing. APFS uses B+ trees to store mappings from filesystem object IDs to their locations on disk, and to store filesystem records (including directories), though these trees&#x27; leaf nodes lack sibling pointers.

=== Database Systems ===

Relational database management systems such as IBM Db2, Informix, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle 8, Sybase ASE, and SQLite support this type of tree for table indices, though each such system implements the basic B+ tree structure with variations and extensions. Many NoSQL database management systems such as CouchDB and Tokyo Cabinet also support this type of tree for data access and storage.

Finding objects in a high-dimensional database that are comparable to a particular query object is one of the most often utilized and yet expensive procedures in such systems. In such situations, finding the closest neighbor using a B+ tree is productive.

==== iDistance ====
B+ tree is efficiently used to construct an indexed search method called iDistance. iDistance searches for k nearest neighbors (kNN) in high-dimension metric spaces. The data in those high-dimension spaces is divided based on space or partition strategies, and each partition has an index value that is close with the respect to the partition. From here, those points can be efficiently implemented using B+ tree, thus, the queries are mapped to single dimensions ranged search. In other words, the iDistance technique can be viewed as a way of accelerating the sequential scan. Instead of scanning records from the beginning to the end of the data file, the iDistance starts the scan from spots where the nearest neighbors can be obtained early with a very high probability.

==== NVRAM ====
Nonvolatile random-access memory (NVRAM) has been using B+ tree structure as the main memory access technique for the Internet Of Things (IoT) system because of its non static power consumption and high solidity of cell memory.  B+ can regulate the trafficking of data to memory efficiently. Moreover, with advanced strategies on frequencies of some highly used leaf or reference point, the B+ tree shows significant results in increasing the endurance of database systems.

<text>The Bobath concept is an approach to neurological rehabilitation that is applied in patient assessment and treatment (such as with adults after stroke or children with cerebral palsy). The goal of applying the Bobath concept is to promote motor learning for efficient motor control in various environments, thereby improving participation and function. This is done through specific patient handling skills to guide patients through the initiation and completing of intended tasks. This approach to neurological rehabilitation is multidisciplinary, primarily involving physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists. In the United States, the Bobath concept is also known as &#x27;neuro-developmental treatment&#x27; (NDT).

The concept and its international tutors / instructors have embraced neuroscience and the developments in understanding motor control, motor learning, neuroplasticity and human movement science. They believe that this approach continues to develop.

The Bobath concept is named after its inventors: Berta Bobath (physiotherapist) and Karel Bobath (a psychiatrist/neurophysiologist). Their work focused mainly on patients with cerebral palsy and stroke. The main problems of these patient groups resulted in a loss of the standard postural reflex mechanism and regular movements. The Bobath concept was focused on regaining regular movements through re-education at its earliest inception. Since then, it has evolved to incorporate new information on neuroplasticity, motor learning, and motor control. Therapists that practice the Bobath concept today also embrace the goal of developing optimal movement patterns through the use of orthotics and appropriate compensations instead of aiming for ultimately &quot;normal&quot; movement patterns.

The Bobath Centre in Watford, UK is a specialist therapy, treatment &amp; training facility and the home of the Bobath Concept.

== Stroke rehabilitation ==
In the Bobath Concept, postural control is the foundation on which patients begin to develop their skills. Patients undergoing this treatment typically learn how to control postures and movements and then progress to more difficult ones. Therapists analyze postures and movements and look for any abnormalities that may be present when asked to perform them. Examples of common abnormal movement patterns include obligatory synergy patterns. These patterns can be described as the process of trying to perform isolated movement of a particular limb but triggering the use of other typically uninvolved muscles (when compared to normal movement) in order to achieve movement. Obligatory synergy patterns can be further subdivided into flexion and extension synergy components for both the upper and lower extremities. This approach requires active participation from both the patient and the therapist. Depending on the patient, rehabilitation goals may work to improve any or all of the following: postural control, coordination of movement sequences, movement initiation, optimal body alignment, abnormal tone or muscle weakness. Treatment will therefore address both negative signs such as impaired postural control, and positive signs such as spasticity.

The strategies and techniques utilized in Bobath therapy encompass therapeutic handling, facilitation, and activation of pivotal control points. Therapeutic handling is a method applied to influence movement quality, combining both facilitation and inhibition approaches. Facilitation plays a central role in Bobath therapy, fostering motor learning by utilizing sensory cues (such as tactile contact and verbal guidance) to reinforce weak movement patterns and discourage excessive ones. The precise application of facilitation during motor tasks involves considerations of timing, modality, intensity, and withdrawal, all of which impact the outcome of motor learning. Inhibition entails diminishing abnormal movement or posture elements that hinder normal functioning. Key control points often denote advantageous areas of the body for facilitating or inhibiting movement and posture.

Activities assigned by a Physical Therapist or Occupational Therapist to an individual who has suffered from a stroke are selected based on functional relevance and are varied in terms of difficulty and the environment in which they are performed. The use of the individual&#x27;s less involved segments, also known as compensatory training strategies, are avoided. Carryover of functional activities in the home and community setting is largely attributed to patient, family and caregiver education.

==History==
The Bobath Concepts&#x27; theoretical underpinning and practice is clearly documented in a contemporary book published by Wiley Blackman in 2009: &quot;Bobath Concept: Theory and Clinical Practice in Neurological Rehabilitation&#x27; written by the British Bobath Tutors Association (BBTA) and edited by Raine, Meadows, and Lynch-Ellerington. &quot;The chair of ACPIN (Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Neurology) reviewed this book and concluded :- “I am not really sure that it is clear from the book what the Bobath approach actually is”, “often the prose turns into jargon” and “this book will do little to quell the critics; in fact, it will no doubt give them more fuel for the fire”.

== Research ==
Paci (2003) conducted an extensive critical appraisal of studies to determine the effectiveness of the Bobath concept for adults with hemiplegia following a stroke. Selected trials showed no evidence proving the effectiveness of the Bobath Concept as the optimal type of treatment. Paci (2003) recommended that standardized guidelines for treatment be identified and described and that further investigations are necessary to develop outcome measures concerning goals of the Bobath approach such as quality of motor performance.

Bobath therapy is nonstandardized as it responds, through clinical reasoning and the development of a clinical hypothesis, to the individual patient and their movement control problems. The decisions about specific treatment techniques are collaboratively made with the patient and are guided by the therapist through the use of goal setting and the development of close communication and interaction. Working to develop improved muscle tone appropriate to the task, the individual and the environment, will enable better alignment, and activation of movement, and allow for the recruitment of, for example, arm activity in functional situations within various positions.

A study by Lennon et al. concluded that even under idealized conditions (patients with optimal rehabilitation potential, advanced trained therapists, unlimited therapy input, and a movement analysis laboratory) the Bobath approach had no effect on the quality of gait for patients with a stroke.

==Institutions==
The Neuro-Developmental Treatment Association (NDTA) was founded to carry on the Bobath&#x27;s work; it offers certification in NDT for managing adults with stroke or brain trauma and for managing and treating children with cerebral palsy and other neuromotor disorders. People who have this certification sometimes are called &quot;neurodevelopmentalists&quot;.

==Criticism==

The concept that Bobath can “evolve” and still be called Bobath has been challenged by the president of the American Academy of Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine and the chair of the UK Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Neurology (ACPIN). These eminent physiotherapists believe that several of the key original teachings of the founders have now been abandoned, whilst the ideas/concepts of others (non Bobath therapists &amp; scientists) have unjustifiably been given the name of Bobath.

There is a widespread use of the Bobath concept amongst therapists in stroke rehabilitation. Yet, a large review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Bobath for stroke rehabilitation found only three instances of significant differences in favour of Bobath, yet 11 in favour of alternatives. The authors concluded that therapists should base their treatment methods on “evidence-based guidelines, accepted rules of motor learning, and biological mechanisms of functional recovery, rather than therapist preference for any named therapy approach”. This review pointed out that the approach is now regarded as “obsolete” in some European countries and it is therefore no longer taught.

In 2018, a major review of upper limb interventions following stroke found significant positive effects for constraint and task specific-therapies and the supplementary use of biofeedback and electrical stimulation. However, they concluded that the use of Bobath therapy was not supported. Furthermore, a 2020 review of lower limb rehabilitation following stroke concluded that Bobath therapy was inferior to task specific training and that prioritising Bobath therapy over other interventions is not supported by current evidence.

In the UK, an NHS review of stroke rehabilitation by Professor Tyson concluded that &quot;the strength of evidence that task-specific functional training and strength training is effective, while Bobath is not, indicates that a paradigm shift is needed in UK stroke physiotherapy... it is increasingly difficult to justify the continued use of the Bobath concept or its associated techniques&quot;. More recently Professor Tyson and Dr Mepsted have both written comprehensive and critical reviews of Bobath/NDT methods, theory and effectiveness. See also an interesting exchange of letters between the above authors and Bobath tutors.

National evidence-based guidelines for stroke rehabilitation have been published for England, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand; yet in none of these is the Bobath approach recommended. Conversely, in 2016 the American Stroke Association concluded that although the effectiveness of NDT/Bobath (compared with other treatment approaches) had not been established that it still “may be considered” as a treatment option for mobility. This, however, was their lowest classification of acceptable treatment. Their two highest recommendation groups (“should be performed” and “reasonable to perform”) contained a variety of treatments for which there was much better evidence. NDT/Bobath was not listed as an option for arm/hand rehabilitation. Also, in 2016, the revised RCP guidelines for stroke made no mention of Bobath/NDT, whilst many alternatives were recommended. Importantly they stated that if a treatment was not mentioned, then it was not recommended and need not be funded. They also stated that therapists using such methods must objectively review their options in light of the evidence supporting the recommended alternatives. Furthermore, patients receiving such interventions should be informed that it was outside mainstream practice. A highly significant 2021 “position paper” by the Academy of Neurologic Physical Therapy of the American Physical Therapy Association concluded that, despite its lack of an evidence base, NDT/Bobath methods were still favoured by some therapist in the USA. To overcome this problem, they described a range of strategies that will be implemented to encourage best evidence-based practices and de-implement traditional (NDT/Bobath) methods of working at both an individual and organizational level.

The Bobath (NDT) approach is also widely used on children with cerebral palsy (CP). However, when the effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of CP was reviewed by Novak et al. they concluded, “Consequently, there are no circumstances where any of the aims of NDT could not be achieved by a more effective treatment. Thus, on the grounds of wanting to do the best for children with CP, it is hard to rationalize a continued place for traditional NDT within clinical care”. They consequently recommended “ceasing provision of the ever-popular NDT”.

The dichotomy between the popularity and institutional funding of this approach versus the negative findings of most RCTs has been excused on the grounds that RCTs may not be suitable for neurorehabilitation. Yet, the British Bobath Tutors Association website does quote the minority of RCTs that support their approach.

<doc id="1326458" wikidata="Q694246" url="?curid=1326458" title="Revolt of Horea, Cloșca, and Crișan">
<text>The revolt of Horea, Cloșca, and Crișan () was a Romanian-led revolt that began in the Metaliferi Mountains, Transylvania, but it soon spread throughout all Transylvania and the Apuseni Mountains. The leaders were Horea (Vasile Ursu Nicola, 1731–1785), Cloșca (, 1747–1785) and Crișan (, 1733–1785).

The revolt started in 31 October 1784, in the village of Curechiu, Hunedoara, when 600 Romanian serf led by Cloșca were attacked by hussar troops while attempting to go to Alba Iulia and enlist as border guards in the imperial regiments, despite governor&#x27;s Samuel von Brukenthal ban of further conscription. And it ended in 27 December 1784, when Horea and Cloșca were captured by the Habsburg authorities.

==Background==
The revolt was directly related to the poor conditions of feudal serfs in the Principality of Transylvania, where Orthodox Romanians lacked political equality with Catholics. After Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I&#x27;s incorporation of the principality into the Habsburg domains in 1691, the rights of the Hungarian, Székely, and Saxon nobles were preserved. The peasants however, most of whom were Romanians, had no political representation. In particular, although they were tolerated, the Romanian peasantry lacked guarantees for their Orthodox church institutions.

Several villages from Hunedoara entrusted the peasant Horea, whose official name was Vasile Ursu Nicola, to present their complaints before the Austrian Emperor Joseph II. Horea traveled to Vienna often in the years from 1779 to 1784 to present to the emperor the injustices to which the Romanian peasants in Transylvania were subjected, but with no success, the last audience being in April 1784. In the summer of 1784, Emperor Joseph II ordered a military conscription in Transylvania, those enlisted were to receive weapons and no longer perform serf duties, and the lands and houses they were using would become their own. However, the number of those who wished to enlist far exceeded the Austrian expectations. The conscription was canceled by the governor of Transylvania, Samuel von Brukenthal, under pressure from the Hungarian nobility who felt their class privileges were threatened, which further displeased the Romanian peasants.

==The revolt==

The peasant Crișan however, in violation of Samuel von Brukenthal&#x27;s order, gathered 600 serfs from different villages on 28 October 1784 and convinced them to go to Alba Iulia and enlist as border guards in the imperial regiments. The people set off towards Alba Iulia over the mountain, bypassing the town of Brad to avoid being stopped by the Hungarian nobility, they spent the night in the village of Curechiu. During the night, they were attacked by hussar troops, whom they managed to defeat and disarm. Now well armed, the attack changed the plans of the serfs, who turned back towards Brad. On 3 November 1784, they attacked the Kristyory noble court in Crișcior. Then, part of them went upstream, towards Abrud, via Mihăileni, while another group went downstream, conquering Brad, Baia de Criș, Ribița, Hălmagiu, Hălmăgel, Ociu Aciuta, and Pleșcuța.

In the following two days, the peasants destroyed and burned all the noble courts in the communes of Sulighet, Bretea, Ilia, Sârbi, Gurasada, Tătărești, Leșnic, Dobra, Roșcani, Geoagiu de Jos, and others. Peasants from Zarand, Strei and Hațeg further mobilized and joined the revolt. The crowd of rebellious peasants ravaged and set fire to the noble buildings in almost all the communes up to the border with Wallachia. Cloșca was part of the initial 600 serfs who marched for Alba Iulia, he would later play a significant role in the coordination and leadership of the uprising.

The revolt targeted the nobility but also non-Orthodox common people, regardless of ethnicity, because the Romanians considered they unfairly received opportunity for advancement in society. The massacres mostly affected the areas and population of Alsó-Fehér County, Zaránd County, and Hunyad County. Between the autumn of 1784 and the winter up to 1785, civilian casualties numbered about 4,000 people from 133 settlements, mostly Hungarians.

While the main Austrian army was waiting for instructions from Vienna, the rebels continued to fight the Transylvanian nobility. On 5 November 1784, the uprising reached the outskirts of the city of Deva, but failed to conquer the city, with 56 peasants being captured and executed. On 11 November 1784, Horea issued an ultimatum to the nobility who had taken refuge in the city, summarizing the political and social ideas of the uprising.

The revolt called for the release of the arrested peasants, national liberation and the organization of a &#x27;popular republic&#x27;. The uprising spread, reaching the areas of Arad and Sibiu, with Saxon and Hungarian peasants joining the revolt as well. At its peak, the revolt reached 10.000 people. To buy time, the military and civil authorities signed armistices with the rebels at Tibru, Valea Bradului, and Sălciua. However, there were fierce battles at Brad, Lupșa, and Râmeț between the rebels and the Transylvanian nobility, with the rebels being victorious.

==The defeat==
Emperor Joseph II, seeing the seriousness of the uprising, instructed the military to intervene and suppress the revolt in early November. He sent imperial forces to Transylvania, and they were commanded to use force to restore order. The Battle of Târsa was the first significant battle following the Austrian intervention where the rebels were defeated by the Austrian forces on 18 November 1784. Afterwards, the imperial forces, led by Colonel Johann von Vins, decisively defeated the peasants at Câmpeni (&quot;Topánfalva&quot;, &quot;Topesdorf&quot;) on 14 December 1784, causing a significant loss of morale and military strength for the rebels.

In the following days, while pockets of resistance and small skirmishes occurred, the imperial army had regained control over most of the region, with leaders of the revolt being hunted down. To capture Horea, the nobility placed a reward on his head. The crossing points into Wallachia and Moldavia were strictly monitored to prevent the leaders of the revolt from fleeing there. The Habsburg monarchy also requested the Ottoman Empire to refrain from granting asylum to the Transylvanian rebels. On 27 December 1784, Horea and Cloșca were betrayed by the forester Anton Melzer from Abrud, who informed the Austrian authorities of their location, leading to their capture in the Scorușetului forest of the Gilău Mountains. Peasants Ștefan Trif and Nuțu Matieș along with five others participated in Horea’s capture for the reward. Crișan was also captured on 30 January 1785, betrayed by nine peasants from Cărpeniș.

More than 600 rebels were captured, out of which 120 were sentenced to death, 37 penalties were delivered initially but they were leter changed to imprisonment as a result of the amnesty of the emperor, with an exception regarding the three leaders.

Crișan hanged himself on the night before the execution, while Horea and Cloșca were subjected to the harshest punishment provided by the Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana, by being broken on the wheel. On 28 February 1785. Horea and Cloșca were transported in two separate carts, accompanied until the moment of their execution by Romanian Orthodox priest Rațiu from the Church in Maierii Bălgradului. The transport was flanked by a squadron of Tuscan cavalry and approximately 300 infantry and hussars. On Dealul Furcilor (Gabelberg, Forks Hill), named today Dealul Horea (Horea Hill), between 2,500 and 3,000 Romanian serfs from over 400 villages were forcefully brought around the erected podium to watch the execution.

==The leaders==
The head of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church during the revolt, Alexandru Sterca-Șuluțiu de Cărpiniș, described Horea as &quot;a man of great wit and natural wisdom, with boldness and determination&quot; who while ravaging the property of Transylvanian nobility did not attack imperial property. Horea was dressed in a black suman (a traditional Romanian coat), adorned on the edges with purple stitching, tight trousers, a sheepskin coat, and a black hat. As the revolt spread quickly, the peasants soon occupied all of Zărand, blocked the roads, took their own security measures, and even introduced their own &#x27;Romanian passports&#x27;.

The text of one such &#x27;passport&#x27; reads:

Cloșca was described as short in stature, intelligent, focused, and brave. He was somewhat wealthier than Horea. The nickname &quot;Cloșca&quot; comes from the peasant custom of playfully giving various names to fellow villagers and from his reputation as a hardworking householder who accumulated wealth. Cloșca lived in the village of Cărpeniș, in Alba County. He was married to Marina, and they had five children: Iosif, Nicolae, Ioan, Vasile, and Ana. He also had two siblings: his brother was named Teodor Oargă, and his sister was Achimia. At the outbreak of the revolt, Cloșca was 37 years old and had already been to Vienna three times, along with Horea, to present the petitions of the peasants to Emperor Joseph II. Throughout the entire revolt, he was Horea&#x27;s closest collaborator and friend. In his testament, he split his wealth to multiple people.

Crișan was born in 1732 in the locality of Vaca (Váka, Vaka), today the village of Crișan, the son of Petru Golda from Vaca and the daughter of Priest Toader Giurgiu from Giurgești. Orphaned of both parents at a young age, he was adopted and raised by his maternal grandfather, Toader Giurgiu, who gave him his name. His first name remained the one given at baptism, Gheorghe. He attended school in Abrud under the name Gheorghe Giurgiu. He also served in the military in the regiment of Count Ferenc Gyulai. The nickname &quot;Crișan&quot; was given only after he settled in Cărpiniș, where he got married. The nickname referred to the fact that he came from the Crișul Alb valley.

==Legacy==

The reward promised to the peasants who helped capture the leaders of the uprising was freedom from serfdom and a payment of 600 coins. Following their execution, Emperor Joseph II ordered that &quot;all Romanians who are undoubtedly known to have committed mistreatments should be relocated with their cattle and tools&quot;, hundreds of peasants who took part in the revolt were displaced to Banat and Bukovina. However, Joseph II enacted a Patent for the Abolition of Serfdom for Transylvania in August 1785. This put an end to serfdom, although the feudal system continued to be practiced for several more decades. The Emperor also ended aristocratic control over peasant marriages, granted peasants the right to education and expanded their grazing rights.

The uprising had a wide echo abroad. From Austria to Portugal, from Germany to Italy, brochures, calendars, press articles, diplomatic reports, and engravings about the leaders of the uprising were published. Some intellectuals and philosophers defended and explained the peasants&#x27; actions. Horea was particularly credited by the European press with the idea of restoring Dacia, even being called &quot;Rex Daciae&quot; (King of Dacia).

The uprising reverberated throughout Western Europe. It upset the feudal system and is considered by many to have inspired the French Revolution. In 1785, Jacques Pierre Brissot, who would become a leader of the French Revolution, published an open letter to Joseph II in which he asserted the right of royal subjects to protest.

In Sweden, the revolt of the Transylvanian peasants led by Horea was followed through frequent correspondences with Vienna, Sibiu and other European centers. In 1814, the story of the rebels was adapted into a play titled &quot;Horea and Closca, the Band of Thieves from Transylvania&quot; which was performed in several Swedish cities.

In 1937, a monument in the form of an obelisk was erected in Alba Iulia to commemorate the revolt. It was designed by and Octavian Mihălțan.

During World War II, the Soviet Union created the Horea, Cloșca și Crișan Division which was named after the revolt. The division was made up of Romanian volunteers mainly drawn from prisoners of war and exiled communist activists.

<doc id="1326466" wikidata="Q1998860" url="?curid=1326466" title="Grabbed by the Ghoulies">
<text>Grabbed by the Ghoulies is an action-adventure game developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Game Studios exclusively for the Xbox. It was released in North America in October 2003, and in Europe in November. It was re-released worldwide on the Xbox 360 as a downloadable Xbox Live Originals game in February 2009. This was removed from the store in June 2015, two months before a remastered version was released as part of the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; compilation for Xbox One. The game follows a young boy, Cooper, who sets out to rescue his girlfriend from a haunted mansion infested with supernatural creatures.

Having originally been in development for the GameCube, &quot;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&quot; was the first Rare game to be published by Microsoft after Rare was bought out from Nintendo. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release. Criticism was directed at the gameplay, but the game&#x27;s graphics and style were praised. &quot;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&quot; was nominated for the Console Family Game of the Year prize at the 2004 Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&quot; is a 3D action-adventure game with beat &#x27;em up elements. Breaking with the style of previous Rare platformers, the gameplay is simple in design, utilizing the premise of moving through areas of the game&#x27;s mansion and completing the required challenges in each room. Such challenges include eliminating all ghoulies in a room, beating only a specified kind of ghouly while avoiding eliminating the rest, or finding a key hidden inside a ghouly before the player-character, Cooper, can continue. All combat and melee attacks are maneuvered by the control sticks, whereas the game&#x27;s camera can be rotated by both triggers. Most of the objects in the mansion are destructible, with the chance of finding Super Soup power-ups inside. The Super Soups can have negative effects, like reversing the player&#x27;s controls or lowering Cooper&#x27;s speed, or positive effects, such as making Cooper invulnerable or immobilizing all ghoulies in the room. When the player fails a challenge or takes longer than a set time limit to complete one, rather than immediately restarting the room, the Grim Reaper will chase after Cooper; the Reaper will instantly kill Cooper if he&#x27;s touched and the player will have to restart the room over, but the Reaper can also be used to the player&#x27;s advantage, as he will also kill any ghouly that he touches. Standard enemies in the game include zombies, mummies, imps, skeletons and zombie pirates. Many objects in the game with which the character can interact—including chairs, knives, and axes—can be used as weapons.

The game also features various bonus challenges. Each room the player visits contains one of 100 hidden Bonus Books to be collected. For every five books the player collects, a bonus challenge is unlocked. The main objective of the bonus challenges is to revisit one of the rooms and perform a different task within it, such as defeating a number of enemies in a certain amount or time or surviving a duel with the Grim Reaper. If a player successfully completes a bonus challenge, they are awarded a bronze, silver, gold or platinum medal based on their performance. For every platinum medal earned, a piece of the game&#x27;s concept art is unlocked. If the player earns a gold or platinum medal for all 20 challenges, a final challenge is unlocked that tasks players with completing the entire game again as Cooper&#x27;s girlfriend Amber, who has very low health and cannot use power-ups. Completing the 21st challenge unlocks the game&#x27;s E3 trailer and a deleted cutscene in the bonus gallery.

==Plot==
Cooper and his girlfriend Amber are looking for shelter from a storm when they come across Ghoulhaven Hall, a mansion owned by Baron Von Ghoul. When Cooper calls him a creep, Von Ghoul kidnaps Amber in retaliation. Cooper chases after Amber, encountering the many ghoulies inhabiting Ghoulhaven Hall. Crivens, the mansion&#x27;s butler, agrees to assist Cooper, guiding him through the manor. Cooper eventually finds Amber, but before the two of them can escape, the mad scientist Dr. Krackpot appears and transforms Amber into a hideous ghouly. Cooper asks the cook Ma Soupswill for help, and she tasks him with collecting three ingredients she needs to synthesize a cure. Along the way, he is aided by the mansion&#x27;s other inhabitants, including groundskeeper Fiddlesworth Dunfiddlin, Soupswill&#x27;s skeletal assistant Mr. Ribs, and cleaning lady Barbara Buffbrass. After gathering the ingredients, Soupswill gives Cooper a jar of the cure. When Cooper pours the cure on Amber, Soupswill is shown to have mixed up one of the ingredients, resulting in Amber transforming into a bigger, hostile ghouly. Cooper is nearly overpowered by Amber, but Soupswill arrives and applies the correct cure, transforming Amber back to normal.

Cooper and Amber prepare to leave the mansion, but Mr. Ribs begs Cooper to help free other children imprisoned throughout the manor. Crivens tells Cooper that Von Ghoul has the key to free the children, but the door to his quarters is locked by a powerful spell, which can only be broken using a counterspell that is in three pieces scattered throughout the mansion. Cooper defeats Dr. Krackpot, collects the three pieces and enter&#x27;s Von Ghoul&#x27;s quarters, but finds that Crivens is already there seemingly attacking Von Ghoul and retrieving the key. When Cooper attempts to take the key, Crivens attacks him and removes his disguise, revealing he was Von Ghoul all along. Cooper fights and defeats Von Ghoul, throwing him out of the mansion and collecting the key. Cooper then follows Mr. Ribs throughout the mansion and races to free all the children before the mansion&#x27;s doors are permanently locked, trapping them inside forever.

If Cooper succeeds in freeing all ten children before time runs out, he and Mr. Ribs are ambushed by imps outside the mansion. Cooper is knocked unconscious and Mr. Ribs is decapitated, but before the imps can feast on them, Ma Soupswill arrives and fights back the imps. Cooper regains consciousness and is thanked for his efforts by Soupswill, Mr. Ribs, Dunfiddlin and Buffbrass. Cooper and Amber then walk off to a nearby village, unaware that Baron Von Ghoul is following behind them in his makeshift plane. If Cooper does not save all the children in time, the scene in which Soupswill defends Cooper and Mr. Ribs from the imps is omitted.

==Development==

The development of &quot;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&quot; began in 2000, after the completion of &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;. The idea for the game began with the name, which is a pun on &quot;goolies&quot;, a British slang term for &quot;testicles&quot;. According to designer Gregg Mayles, the name of the game materialised after he overheard someone mention &quot;being grabbed by the goolies&quot;, and thought that it would make a suitable name for an upcoming Rare game. Before any details of the game were publicised, it was rumoured that &quot;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&quot; would be the subtitle to the next Conker the Squirrel game. After Microsoft purchased Rare for £375 million in 2002, development of the game for the GameCube was delayed until Rare converted it to the Xbox console.

Development of the game took under three years. It was originally conceived as a larger, non-linear open platform game for the GameCube. However, a simpler design and simpler concept were adopted due to the Microsoft buyout and increasing time constraints. After Microsoft&#x27;s purchase of Rare, the studio re-affirmed their &quot;simple design&quot; of the game so that players would be able to easily adapt and devote less commitment to it. In a retrospective interview, Mayles stated that the change from GameCube to Xbox was difficult and required a lot of changes as &quot;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&quot; was &quot;an original game that started life as a Nintendo product&quot;.

According to Mayles, &quot;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&quot; was not inspired by Rare&#x27;s similar-themed &quot;Atic Atac&quot;. The cel-shaded art style and design of the characters in &quot;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&quot; were inspired by Hanna-Barbera cartoons, and the various character personalities were based both on historical figures and people from Mayles&#x27; childhood. Antagonist Baron von Ghoul was &quot;a mix&quot; of the Red Baron and British aristocracy, whereas supportive characters, such as Ma Soupswill, were loosely based on staff from a school. Mayles considered the conversion of the game to the Xbox to be one of the hardest challenges during development, as Rare had less than a year to finish the game once it was converted.

== Release ==
The game was revealed at E3 2003, with a playable demo being a mostly complete version of the game, albeit with a few levels missing. &quot;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&quot; was released in North America on 21 October 2003, in Europe on 21 November and in Japan on 29 April 2004, becoming Rare&#x27;s first game to be released under Microsoft. It was later re-released as an Xbox Originals game for the Xbox 360 on 16 February 2009, later being removed from the store on 16 June 2015, before the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; compilation game which included it was released on 4 August 2015. The game was remastered to run natively on the Xbox One, increasing its resolution and framerate relative to the original Xbox release. &quot;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&quot; was one of the first original Xbox games to be compatible with Xbox One via backwards compatibility.

==Reception==

The game was met with mixed reviews from critics upon release. It holds an average score of 66/100 at Metacritic, based on an aggregate of 42 reviews.

The graphics and animation were praised by critics. Kevin Gifford of 1UP stated that the cel-shaded graphics were &quot;perfect&quot; for the &quot;spooky&quot; theme of the game, and that the smooth animation resulted in the enemies appearing &quot;endearing&quot;. Ronan Jennings of Eurogamer was less impressed by the graphics, stating that the game &quot;never blew him away&quot; but always kept a high standard of creativity. However, Jennings did praise the animation and character designs. Reviewers of Game Revolution gave praise to the game&#x27;s visuals, comparing them to be sharper and clearer to the visuals of &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, but noted that the character designs still seemed &quot;tied down to the past&quot;, being more suited to the Nintendo 64 than to the Xbox.

The game was criticised for its simplistic gameplay and lack of innovation. Gifford noted that the game&#x27;s &quot;biggest problem&quot; was its unchallenging gameplay, stating that it was &quot;repetitive&quot;; he compared it to gameplay of the 16-bit era. Game Revolution stated that the gameplay appeared &quot;interesting&quot; at first, but grew tiresome the longer the game is played, despite its short length. Jennings noted that the gameplay was not &quot;groundbreaking&quot; and similarly stated that the game relied heavily on &quot;what is practically 16-bit gameplay&quot;. The camera controls were another criticised aspect of the game, due to the control sticks being allocated for attack functions. Gifford labelled the &quot;forced shunt&quot; idea as a &quot;terrible drag&quot; which became troublesome during the latter half of the game. Game Revolution&#x27;s review also criticised the camera controls, stating that the use of triggers to rotate the camera was &quot;on the clunky side&quot;. Jennings, however, felt that the camera was &quot;fine&quot; and did not provide any obstruction.

The game was similarly criticised when it was reviewed retrospectively as a part of the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; compilation game. Marty Sliva of IGN stated that it was among the games on the compilation that had &quot;failed to withstand the test of time&quot;, describing it as &quot;very boring&quot;. Similarly, Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer felt that the game represented Rare&#x27;s &quot;slump period&quot;, calling it a &quot;particularly awkward gear change&quot; for the developer. Despite its problems however, Whitehead also felt that the game &quot;has a charm and character that is almost entirely absent from the AAA console space in 2015&quot;.

&quot;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&quot; was nominated for &quot;Console Family Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition&quot; at the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards; the first award was ultimately given to &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Sims: Bustin&#x27; Out&quot; (in a tie), while the latter was given to &quot;Medal of Honor: Rising Sun&quot;.

<text>In ufology, alien implants is a term used to describe physical objects allegedly placed in someone&#x27;s body after they have been abducted by aliens. Claimed capabilities of the implants range from telepresence to mind control to biotelemetry (the latter akin to humans tagging wild animals for study). As with UFO subjects in general, the idea of &quot;alien implants&quot; has seen very little attention from mainstream scientists.

==History==
According to Peter Rogerson writing in &quot;Magonia&quot; magazine, the concept of alien implants can be traced to a March 1957 Long John Nebel radio show interview with UFOlogist John Robinson where Robinson recounted a neighbor&#x27;s claim of being kidnapped by aliens in 1938 and kept subdued by &quot;small earphones&quot; placed behind his ears.

Massachusetts resident Betty Andreasson claimed that aliens had implanted a device in her nose during her supposed alien abduction in 1967, first publicized by Raymond Fowler in his book, &quot;The Andreasson Affair&quot;. A Canadian woman named Dorothy Wallis claimed a similar experience in 1983. In later years, the claims of authors like Whitley Strieber would popularize alien abduction ideas in general, including reports of unusual &quot;implants&quot; associated with abductions. John E. Mack wrote in his book &quot;Abduction: Human Encounters With Aliens&quot; that he examined a &quot;1/2- to 3/4-inch thin, wiry object&quot; given to him by a twenty-four-year-old woman client who claimed it came out of her nose following an abduction experience. California podiatrist Roger Leir also claims to have removed alien implants from patients.

According to skeptical investigator Joe Nickell, supposed alien implants appear to be ordinary materials such as a shard of glass, a jagged piece of metal, and a carbon fiber. The objects are often found lodged in extremities such as toes, hands and shins. Nickell cites Israeli teaching hospital department head Virgil Priscu&#x27;s opinion that there&#x27;s &quot;No mystery, no implants&quot;, explaining that normal objects picked up during a fall or by walking barefoot often become surrounded by scar tissue.

==Popular culture==
Alien implants, pictured as small needles inserted into victim&#x27;s necks and stomachs, first appeared in the 1953 film &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot;.

<doc id="1326530" wikidata="Q2044641" url="?curid=1326530" title="Sahadeva">
<text>Sahadeva () was the youngest of the five Pandava brothers in the ancient Indian epic, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. He and his twin brother Nakula were the sons of Madri, one of the wives of the Pandava patriarch Pandu, and Ashvini Kumaras, the divine twin physicians of the gods, whom she invoked to beget her sons due to Pandu&#x27;s inability to progenate. Kunti, Sahadeva&#x27;s step-mother, loved him the most despite his birth to Madri. Sahadeva is renowned for his wisdom, knowledge of astrology, and skill in swordsmanship.

Sahadeva shared the common wife, Draupadi, with his four brothers. He was also married to Vijaya of Madra kingdom. He had two sons, Shrutasena and Suhotra, from his two wives respectively. Sahadeva played a crucial role during the Rajasuya of Yudhishthira, where he conquered the kings of the South. After Yudhishthira lost all of his possessions to Duryodhana in the game of dice, Sahadeva vowed to slay Shakuni, Duryodhana&#x27;s maternal uncle, who had used loaded dice to unfairly win the game. Afterwards, the Pandavas and Draupadi were exiled for thirteen years, with the last year being a period of hiding called as Agyaata Vaasa. During the hiding, Sahadeva disguised himself as a Vaishya named Tantripala and worked as a cowherd in the kingdom of Virata. Sahadeva was a skilled warrior who fought in the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and their cousins, the Kauravas. On the 18th day of the war, he slayed Shakuni. At the end of the epic, during the Pandavas&#x27; journey in the Himalayas to enter svarga (heaven), Sahadeva was the second to fall, following Draupadi, due to his excessive pride in his wisdom.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;sahadeva&quot; is derived from two Sanskrit words &quot;saha&quot; (सह) and &quot;deva&quot; (देव). &quot;Saha&quot; means ‘&quot;with&quot;’ and deva is a Hindu term used for ‘&quot;deity&quot;’. So literally, Sahadeva means ‘&quot;with the gods&quot;’ or ‘&quot;protected by the gods&quot;’. In southern India, he is regarded as a very accomplished astrologer, a face reader, and a master of all other forms of intuitive perception. He was known for his secretive nature; although he accurately understood a situation, he never revealed anything about it. Hence, presently, people who have a similar nature are called a Sahadeva.

In the epic, various epithets for Sahadeva has been used. Prominent ones are the patronymics—&quot;Āśvineya, Aśvinīsuta&quot;—and matronymics—&quot;Mādrīputra, Mādreya&quot;. Other important other names are &quot;Bharataśārdūla, Bharatasattama, Kauravya, Kurunandana, Nakulānuja, Pāṇḍava and Pāṇḍunandana&quot;.
==Literary background==
The story of Sahadeva is told in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, one of the Sanskrit epics from the Indian subcontinent. The work is written in Classical Sanskrit and is a composite work of revisions, editing and interpolations over many centuries. The oldest parts in the surviving version of the text may date to near 400 BCE.

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; manuscripts exist in numerous versions, wherein the specifics and details of major characters and episodes vary, often significantly. Except for the sections containing the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; which is remarkably consistent between the numerous manuscripts, the rest of the epic exists in many versions. The differences between the Northern and Southern recensions are particularly significant, with the Southern manuscripts more profuse and longer. Scholars have attempted to construct a critical edition, relying mostly on a study of the &quot;Bombay&quot; edition, the &quot;Poona&quot; edition, the &quot;Calcutta&quot; edition and the &quot;south Indian&quot; editions of the manuscripts. The most accepted version is one prepared by scholars led by Vishnu Sukthankar at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, preserved at Kyoto University, Cambridge University and various Indian universities.

Sahadeva also appears in later Hindu scriptures like the &quot;Harivamsa&quot;—which is regarded as &quot;khila&quot; (supplement or appendix) of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;—and &quot;Puranas&quot; like the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;.

==Biography==
===Birth and early years===
Sahadeva was one of the five brothers born to Pandu, a member of the illustrious Lunar dynasty lineage and the heir of the throne of Kuru. The collective name “Pandavas” originates from their father. However, Pandu was afflicted by a curse that would lead to his demise if he engaged in sexual relations with a woman. Consequently, Sahadeva and his brothers were born through a sacred mantra bestowed upon Pandu&#x27;s first wife Kunti by the revered sage Durvasa during her maidenhood. Both of Pandu’s wives—Madri and Kunti—invoked different deities and were blessed with children.

According to the &quot;Adi Parva&quot; (&#x27;First Book&#x27;) of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, upon Pandu&#x27;s behest, Kunti had used her boon three times to invoke celestial gods and gave birth to her three children—Yudhishthira, Bhima and Arjuna. Upon hearing about Madri&#x27;s desire to give birth to a son, Pandu requested Kunti to shared her boon to her. Madri, upon seeking divine assistance, invoked the twin celestial deities of health, the Asvins, and bore two sons—Nakula and Sahadeva—who were extolled to be unparalleled in earthly beauty. An ethereal voice proclaimed that these twins would surpass even the Asvins themselves in energy and allure. Despite invoking the gods only once, Madri obtained two remarkable sons. However, her co-wife, Kunti, fearing that Madri might surpass her in offspring, beseeched the king not to command her further, accepting this as her granted boon. Sahadeva, along with his brothers, spent his childhood in the company of sages at Shatashriga mountain. However he was orphaned after Pandu, who had a curse inflicted upon him by Kindama, attempted to engage in love making with Madri, resulting in his demise. Following this, Madri entrusted her children to Kunti, and followed him to his death by performing the ancient practice of sati, immolating herself on her husband’s funeral pyre. Kunti raised the twins alongside her own sons in Hastinapura, the capital of Kuru which was being ruled under Pandu&#x27;s elder brother Dhritarashtra. Despite Sahadeva not being her biological offspring, Kunti held a special affection for him, making him her favorite among the Pandavas. The Pandava brothers were brought up with their paternal cousins, the Kauravas, and the education of all these boys was supervised by Bhishma.

Sahadeva and Nakula, along with the other princes, were instructed in the gurukula for by Kripa and Drona in warfare and use of weapons such as bow and arrows and martial art. He also mastered his skills in fencing and axe fighting. At the end, Sahadeva alone also acquired the knowledge of Neeti Sastra (Essence of Statesmanship), astronomy and astrology, economics, and civil administration from Brihaspati, guru of the Devas during a two years travel through southern India. After completing their training, the Pandavas defeated Drupada, King of Panchala, as a gurudakshina for Drona. Notably, Sahadeva along with Nakula protected the wheels of Arjuna&#x27;s chariot during this endeavor. Later, Duryodhana—the eldest son of Dhritarashtra and leader of hundred Kaurava brothers—plotted to burn the Pandavas alive by constructing Lakshagriha, a lac palace, in Varanavata. Fortunately, with the aid of their wise uncle Vidura, the Pandavas escaped through a secret tunnel.

===Marriages and children===
In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Sahadeva had two wives—Draupadi, the princess of Panchala who was also married to his four brothers as well, and Vijaya, the princess of Madra. Details of their marriage is provided in the &quot;Adi Parva&quot;.

Following the events at Lakshagriha, Sahadeva, accompanied by his mother and brothers, made the decision to conceal themselves from Hastinapura. During this period, Arjuna received information that Drupada, the ruler of Panchala, was organizing an archery tournament to determine the suitor for his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage and disguised as a Brahmin, emerged victorious in the tournament. The Pandavas hastened home to share the news of his achievement with his mother. In his excitement, he exclaimed, &quot;Look what we have found!&quot; Kunti, his mother, insisted that this newfound fortune be shared with his brothers, as they had always collectively faced life&#x27;s challenges in the past. This misunderstanding, coupled with the protocol that the eldest brother, Yudhishthira, should marry first, led to a unique arrangement: all five brothers would wed Draupadi. This instance stands as a rare example of polyandry within Sanskrit literature . The brothers collectively agreed that Draupadi would become the wife of each Pandava for one year and none would intrude upon Draupadi&#x27;s privacy when she was alone with any of them. The penalty for violating this pact was a year of exile during which the offender must maintain celibacy. Sahadeva was the fourth in line as Arjuna had broken the treaty, resulting in latter&#x27;s exile. Shrutasena was born to Sahadeva and Draupadi.

Sahadeva later also married Vijaya, the daughter of his maternal uncle Dyutimata of Madra, in a self-choice ceremony organised in Madra. She who bore him one son, Suhotra.

The &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, the appendix of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, adds Bhanumati, the granddaughter of the avatar Krishna, as another wife of Sahadeva. According to the story narrated in the &quot;Vishnu Parva&quot; of the text, she was the daughter of the Yadava leader Bhanu, son of Krishna and Satyabhama. The Yadavas held a festival when Krishna traveled to the sacred palace known as Pindaraka with his entourage of Yadavas. Bhanumati was taken away by a demon known as Nikumbha at the event. This resulted from a curse placed on Bhanumati by Durvasa, whom Bhanumati had formerly disregarded during their meeting in Raivata&#x27;s garden. After the curse, Durvasa had comforted her by telling her that she will be rescued. It is true that Bhanumati was rescued by the combined effort of Krishna, Arjuna and Pradyumna and wed Sahadeva on the suggestion of the divine-sage Narada.

===Conquest and Rajasuya Yajna===

Sahadeva played an active role in the establishment of his eldest brother—Yudhishthira—as a sovereign emperor. The &quot;Adi Parva&quot; narrates that after the &quot;Svayamvara&quot; ceremony of Draupadi, news of the Pandavas&#x27; survival and alliance with Drupada of Panchala reached Hastinapura. It led to mixed reactions among the Kuru elders and princes. King Dhritarashtra, influenced by the wise counsel of Vidura, Bhishma, and Drona, acknowledged the Pandavas’ right to the throne and decided to share the kingdom to avoid conflict. The Pandavas, Kunti and Draupadi were invited back to Hastinapura and were warmly received by the citizens. However, to prevent further discord, Dhritarashtra suggested that the Pandavas establish their domain in Khandavaprastha, a barren land. The Pandavas accepted the proposal and transformed Khandavaprastha into the magnificent city of Indraprastha, which became a thriving center of culture and commerce. 

&quot;Sabha Parva&quot; (&#x27;Book of the Assembly Hall), the second book of the Mahabharata, describes the Pandavas&#x27; life at the Indraprastha court and Yudhishthira’s Rajasuya Yajna, which leads to the expansion of the Pandava brothers’ empire. Rajasuya was a grand Vedic ritual performed by ancient Indian kings to assert their sovereignty and demonstrate their supremacy. The epic states that Yudhishthira desired to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice not for personal power but to establish dharma (morals, virtues and righteousness) and defend it across the world. The brothers including Sahadeva went for out in four directions for subjugating other kingdoms and rulers and collected huge bounties which enriched the treasury of Indraprastha kingdom immensely. Sahadeva was sent to south direction, specifically chosen for the southern campaign because of his expertise with the sword, and because Bhishma opined that Southerners are skilled with sword-fighting in general.

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; mentions several kingdoms to the south of Indraprastha which were conquered by Sahadeva. Some of them are as under:
*Surasenas
*Pandyan dynasty
*Matsya, the king Dantavakra, kings Sukumara, Sumitra, other Matsyas and Patacharas.
*Kings of Lanka who claimed to be descendants of Vibhishana, the king of Lanka and brother of Ravana. He offered him diverse kinds of jewels and gems, sandalwood, celestial ornaments, costly apparel and valuable pearls. Sahadeva deputed his nephew, Ghatotkacha (son of Bhima) to collect these taxes considering the latter&#x27;s Rakshasa lineage.
*At Kishkindha, the monkey-kings Mainda and Dvivida were defeated in a 7-day war.
*City of Mahishmati, which was ruled by King Nila. Since the kingdom had the blessings of Agni, a huge fire obstructed the army when Sahadeva tried to invade; later prayer to Agni enabled Sahadeva to complete the conquest.
* King Rukmi of Vidarbha and territories of Bhojakata
*Nishadas, the hill of Gosringa and King Sreenimath.
* Navarashtra, under King Kunti-Bhoja
* King Jamvaka, on the banks of the river Charmanvati.
* Territories lying on the banks of the Venwa.
* Kingdoms that lay on the banks of the Narmada.
* Avanti, kings called Vinda and Anuvinda, a town of Bhojakata
* King of Kosala
* King of Tripura
* King of Saurashtra
* Surparaka kingdom, Talakatas and Dandakas
* Mlechchha tribe living on the sea coast, Nishadas, the cannibals, Karnapravarnas, and the Kalamukhas (a cross between human beings and Rakshasas) and the whole area of the Cole mountains.
* Surabhipatna and the island called the Copper island, and a mountain called Ramaka.
* The town of Timingila and a wild tribe is known by the name of the Kerakas who were men with one leg.
* The town of Sanjayanti, countries of the Pashandas, Karahatakas, Paundrayas, Dravidas, Udrakeralas, Andhras, Talavanas, Kalingas and Ushtrakarnikas, Sekas and Yavanas
* Paurava kingdom
* A verse in the scriptures also mention that Sahadeva before his invasion south of Indraprastha, had forced tribute from Antioch, Rome and the City of the Greeks. His twin brother Nakula is said to have conquered the Huns along with Chinese to give tribute at the Rajasuya Yajna.

The &quot;Sabha Parva&quot; further narrates that after the brothers successfully returned from their campaign, the venue and other aspects related to the conduct of the Rajasuya was elaborately done under the stewardship of Bhishma. Sahadeva served as Yudhishthira&#x27;s minister in the ceremony, and helped in conducting various rituals. When Bhishma ordained that Krishna deserved the honour of the first sacred arghya of the Yajna due to his divine attributes and contributions in establishing dharma, King Shishupala of Chedi opposed this. Sahadeva boldly declared his support for Krishna’s worship and challenged anyone who disagrees to respond. His action was met with silence from the other kings, signifying their acceptance or reluctance to oppose him. Later, after the completion of the Yajna, Sahadeva escorted Drona and his son Ashwatthama back to their palaces.

===Exile===
Following Yudhishthira&#x27;s loss in the game of dice meant that all Pandavas including Draupadi had to live in exile for 13 years with last year in Agnatavas (incognito). p. 214

As the Pandavas departed Hastinapura, the entire populace of the city had lined along the streets in grief. Sahadeva had then smeared his face with mud thinking &quot;none should recognise me in this hour of calamity&quot;. Nakula covered himself with ashes. Arjuna scattered sands to symbolize the countless arrows he would let loose in battle, Bhima walked with his hands outstretched to indicate to people that no one could equal him, and Yudhishthira had covered his face. Kunti had appealed to Draupadi to take care of her son Sahadeva as he holds a special place in her heart; Draupadi had left Hastinapura along with the Pandavas wearing a single safron cloth with her hair disheveled. p. 214

During their exile, travelling on pilgrimage from place to place, Sahadeva and his brothers were living at Vadarika (also known to be Badarikasrama). A rakshasa named Jatasura was also living amidst them in disguise of a learned Brahmin, and enjoying their hospitality. Suddenly, when Bhima was away from the camp on a hunting trip, Jatasura assumed the form of a demonic rakshasa and forcibly abducted Yudhishthira, Nakula, Sahadeva, and Draupadi, with the objective of seizing their weapons. Sahadeva somehow extricated himself from the clutches of Jatasura and attacked him with his sword, and at the same time calling out to Bhima for help. Jatasura also counter attacked Sahadeva. A long fight ensued between them, and Sahadeva initially felled Jatasura to the ground. Sahadeva had then thrown his axe at him but Jatasura rose up and gave a hard slap to Sahadeva and threw him to the ground; Yudhisthira, Nakula and Draupadi were distressed and told Jatasura that his death was near. Sahadeva and Jatasura continued the fight by uprooting trees and throwing them at each other, and at one stage, Sahadeva by throwing his axe had cut off the Jata or hair tuft by which the rakshasa was known as Jatasura, which infuriated him further. The rakshasa then, with magical powers, as a mayavi, had assumed immense proportions and relentlessley attacked and injured Sahadeva. But then Bhima appeared on the scene eventually, and challenged Jatasura, asking his brothers to keep away. In a very fierce fight, Bhima hit Jatasura&#x27;s head with his mace and slayed him. Sahadeva and his brother Nakula with their brothers Bhima and Yudhishthira then trekked to a nearby lake, which was surrounded by a herbal forest, where they nursed their wounds.

In the 13th year, Pandavas collectively decided that the Virata kingdom of king Virata would be an ideal place for them to hide in disguise. The day after Draupadi&#x27;s entrance into Virata&#x27;s palace as Sairandhri, &#x27;an expert maid&#x27;, in the name of Malini, employed by Queen Sudeshna, Sahadeva made his way into the city dressed as a cowherd. He arrived at one cow posture in the region of Virata&#x27;s palace. The king happened to be visiting his herd and was present when he saw a handsome well built man clad in a cowherd&#x27;s dress, and speaking the dialects of the cowherds. Beholding him the king was struck with amazement. He asked Sahadeva, &quot;To whom dost though belong&quot; and whence though come; What work dost though seek: I have never seen thee before.&quot; Sahadeva replied saying that he was a Vaisya, Arishtinemi by name, and was earlier in the employment of Kuru King Yudhishthira, the eldest of the five sons of Pandu and had tended to eight hundred thousand cattle and that people used to call him &#x27;Tatripala&#x27; (Pandavas however called him &quot;Jayadbala&quot;), and that he knew the present, the past and the future of all kine (cows) living within ten yojanas (). He also told the king the means by which kine population could be multiplied in a short time, and that he liked the work of taming, milking and breeding cattle. Impressed with the resume narrated by Sahadeva, King Virata employed him in his palace as the chief cowherd who supervised the maintenance and upkeep of all cows in his kingdom, while his elder brothers assumed different roles in disguise to work in Virata&#x27;s court. Yudhishthira assumed the identity of game entertainer to the king and called himself Kanka, Bhima was the cook Ballava, Arjuna taught dance and music as eunuch Brihannala and dressed as a woman, and Nakula tended horses as Granthika. In Virata&#x27;s kingdom, the Pandavas in disguise had a very hilarious but entertaining time but also a mini war erupted when Duryodhana was trying to locate them so that he could send them back to exile again, which ultimately revealed their identity at the end of the Agnyatavasa period of one year. p. 606.

With the all powerful brother-in-law of King Virata, Kichaka&#x27;s death at the hands of Bhima due to his lascivious behaviour towards Sairanadri (Draupadi), Virata was weakened. Then scenting that Pandavas were hiding in the Virata&#x27;s court, Susharma, King of Trigatas and the Kauravas invaded Matsya kingdom successively, not only captured Virata but also robbed him of his immense cattle wealth. Virata, with the help of the four Pandavas in his employment, Yudhisthira, Bhima, Nakula and Sahadeva defeated Susharma and freed King Virata. Meanwhile, the Kurus in cohets with Susharma, robbed Virata&#x27;s kingdom of sixty thousand cattle. However, they were defeated by Arjuna, with Prince Uttara, son of Virata as a charioteer. The Kurus, including Karna, were humiliated and returned the cattle to Virata and went back to Hastinapura. It was also the last day of the one year agnyatavasa of the Pandavas, and when they revealed their true identity to King Virata and Kauravas.

===Kurukshetra War===
In the great Kurukshetra War, Sahadeva played an important role from the Pandava alliance against their cousins Kauravas. The chariot flag of Sahadeva displayed a silver swan. He sounded his conch, named Manipushpaka, to signal the war&#x27;s commencement, and wielded a bow called Ashwina throughout the battle. During the preparation of the war, Sahadeva suggested King Virata to be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Pandava army, though Yudhishthira and Arjuna later opted Dhrishtadyumna for the post.

In the narrative of the battle, Sahadeva&#x27;s actions recorded in the &quot;Bhishma Parva, Drona Parva, Karna Parva&quot; and &quot;Shalya Parva&quot; are as follows:
* He initiated a duel with Durmukha (Bhishma Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 25).
* He emerged victorious over Vikarna, Shalya, and other warriors (Bhishma Parva, Chapter 71, Verse 83).
* He led to the destruction of the Kauravas&#x27; cavalry (Bhishma Parva, Chapter 89, Verse 32).
* He made a strategic withdrawal from the battlefield (Bhishma Parva, Chapter 105, Verse 16).
* He engaged in a duel with Kripacharya (Bhishma Parva, Chapter 110, Verse 12).
* He fought against Shakuni (Drona Parva, Chapter 14, Verse 22).
* He clashed once more with Durmukha (Drona Parva, Chapter 106, Verse 13).
* He was responsible for the death of Nirmitra, the Trigarta prince (Drona Parva, Chapter 107, Verse 25).
* He was defeated in combat by Karna (Drona Parva, Chapter 167, Verse 15).
* He achieved victory over Dushasana (Drona Parva, Chapter 188, Verse 2).
* He intervened in the altercation between Satyaki and Dhrishtadyumna (Drona Parva, Chapter 198, Verse 53).
* He killed Paundraja (Karna Parva, Chapter 22, Verse 14).
* He once again defeated Dushasana (Karna Parva, Chapter 23).
* He sustained injuries during a skirmish with Duryodhana (Karṇa Parva, Chapter 56, Verse 7).
* He was victorious over Uluka (Karna Parva, Chapter 61, Verse 43).
* He killed Shalya’s son (Shalya Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 43).
* He slayed Uluka, son of Shakuni (Shalya Parva, Chapter 28, Verse 32).
* He ultimately killed Shakuni, fulfilling his vow made after the dice game.(Shalya Parva, Chapter 28, Verse 46).

=== Later life and death ===

After the war, Yudhishthira appointed Nakula as king of Northern and Sahadeva as the Kings of southern Madra. Suhotra, son of Sahadeva from his wife Vijaya, would eventually be crowned as the heir to the Madra kingdom.

Upon the onset of the Kali Yuga and the departure of Krishna, the Pandavas retired. Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas, accompanied by a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the Himalayas seeking heaven. Except for Yudhishthira, all of the Pandavas grew weak and died before reaching heaven. Sahadeva was the second one to fall after Draupadi.

<text>Joint Task Force-National Capital Region (JTF-NCR) is an element of United States Northern Command tasked to support National Special Security Events (NSSEs) and other major ceremonies, and potential contingency operations in the National Capital Region.

Commander United States Northern Command tasked Joint Task Force-National Capital Region to plan, coordinate and execute Department of Defense-approved support, as well as conduct liaison and coordination with the Presidential Inaugural Committee and the United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. Immediately following the general election, the President-elect appoints the inaugural committee to plan, coordinate and host numerous celebrations and special events associated with the Presidential Inauguration. The joint committee, appointed by the House and the Senate, is responsible for conducting the swearing-in ceremony for the President-elect and Vice President–elect at the Capitol. Both of these committees historically request various forms of ceremonial support from Department of Defense.

The Joint Task Force participates in all inter-agency planning and conducts planning with joint partners in the National Capital Region. The joint force is expected to provide world-class ceremonial support for the Presidential Inauguration and the related official ceremonies and events throughout the inaugural period, continuing the tradition of military participation in the inauguration of the commander-in-chief, tracing back to the inauguration of George Washington in 1789.

In addition to the official events on January 21, 2013, during the Second inauguration of Barack Obama, other inaugural ceremonies and events were held throughout the Inaugural Period between January 15 and 24, 2013. The Department of Defense supported these events in accordance with approved Defense Department ceremonial support guidelines.

==Predecessors== 

Prior to the 57th Presidential Inauguration, the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee (AFIC) coordinated the United States Armed Forces participation in the ten-day period of U.S. Presidential Inauguration Day ceremonies. That traditionally includes musical military units, marching bands, color guards, ushers, firing details, and salute batteries. AFIC also provides a &quot;very limited amount of approved logistical support.&quot;

The military has participated in inaugural day ceremonies since President Washington. Since the first inauguration of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953, that participation has been formalized into a committee, originally called the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee.

AFIC was a temporary joint military command established every four years at the direction of the Secretary of Defense. For what became the second inauguration of George W. Bush, the committee was established in February 2004. Between then and Inauguration Day itself, the organization grew to about 400 people by December and over 700 people in January 2005.

The ten-day celebration surrounding the second inauguration of Richard Nixon in 1973 was impacted by the death of former President Lyndon B. Johnson, just two days into Nixon&#x27;s new term. The remainder of the ceremonies were cancelled, as the military would have to deal with the state funeral for the nation&#x27;s 36th president. Because of the inauguration, all the military men who participated in the inauguration participated in the state funeral.

<doc id="1326542" wikidata="Q1635469" url="?curid=1326542" title="Vasuki">
<text>Vasuki () is the king of the nagas in Hinduism. He is described as having a gem called &quot;Nagamani&quot; (serpent&#x27;s ornament) on his head. Shesha, another king of the nagas and the bed on which Vishnu rests, is his elder brother, and Manasa, another naga, is his sister. In Hindu iconography, he is generally depicted coiling around the neck of Shiva, who is believed to have blessed and worn him as an ornament.

He is known in Chinese and Japanese mythology as being one of the &quot;eight Great Dragon Kings&quot; (八大龍王 pinyin: Bādà lóngwáng; Japanese: Hachidai Ryūō), amongst Nanda (Nāgarāja), Upananda, Sāgara (Shakara), Takshaka, Balavan, Anavatapta, and Utpala.
==Legend==
Vasuki is one of the sons of the sage Kashyapa and Kadru.

He is accorded a significant role in the legend of Samudra Manthana. He is described to have allowed both the devas and the asuras to bind him to Mount Mandara, so that they could use him as their churning rope to extract the amrita from the Ocean of Milk.In the Mahabharata, Vasuki is stated to have been cursed by Kadru. He refused to aid her in her scheme of hanging to the tail of the divine horse Ucchaishshravas with his other siblings to cause it to appear black, so that she could cheat in her wager against her sister Vinata. Condemned to burn with numerous brothers in King Janamejaya&#x27;s snake sacrifice, he sought refuge with the devas, participating in the churning of the ocean.

Having retreated to the netherworld, but wishing to save his brothers from the snake sacrifice, Vasuki sought the counsel of his siblings. One of them, Elapatra, stated that he had overheard Brahma informing the other deities that the son born to their sister named Jaratkaru and a sage who shared the same name would be their saviour. Vasuki made the arrangements to marry his sister to the sage. The son born to them, Astika, was able to successfully put an end to Janamejaya&#x27;s persecution of the nagas.
== Buddhism ==
In the Buddhist religion, Vasuki and the other Naga Kings appear in the audience for many of Gautama Buddha&#x27;s sermons. The duties of the naga Kings included leading the nagas in protecting and worshipping the Buddha, as well as protecting other enlightened beings. Vasuki&#x27;s naga priest is Tatig Naga.

==Veneration==
The Vāsuka/Vāsuca temple is located near Haripad, Mannarasala Illom in Kerala and the Visakha district in Andhra Pradesh. According to the regional legend of the Kukke Subramanya temple in Karnataka, the deity Kartikeya is regarded to have offered protection to Vasuki from the attack of Garuda, the mount of Vishnu.

<doc id="1326545" wikidata="Q3520838" url="?curid=1326545" title="The Family That Plays Together">
<text>The Family That Plays Together is the second album by the American rock band Spirit. It was released by Ode Records in December 1968. It was voted number 575 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; 3rd Edition (2000)&quot;.&quot;

The cover was photographed at the Sunset Highland Motel, 6830 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California, across the street from Hollywood High School.

==Title==
The title alludes to the slogan &quot;The family that prays together stays together&quot;, created by ad-writer Al Scalpone for the Family Rosary Crusade and popular in American and British parlance beginning in the 1940s. During this time the band lived together in a house in Topanga, California, near Los Angeles. The title was also inspired by the stepson-stepfather relationship between lead guitarist Randy California and percussionist Ed Cassidy. 

==Music==
The group expands on psychedelic rock and moves toward an early form of progressive rock. &quot;It Shall Be&quot; and &quot;Silky Sam&quot; incorporate jazz influences. &quot;Jewish&quot; has Hebrew lyrics taken from the traditional song &quot;Hine Ma Tov&quot;, based on King David&#x27;s Psalm 133. The album&#x27;s string and horn arrangements were by Marty Paich, who also created arrangements for the group&#x27;s self-titled debut album.

== Release history ==
After the first issue, the stereo master tapes for this album were locked in storage and unavailable. Because of this, subsequent CD releases by Sony, as well as the recent vinyl reissue by Sundazed Music, are taken from new stereo mixes made from the original multi-track tapes by Bob Irwin, Randy California and Ed Cassidy in 1996. Liner notes on the 1996 CD reissue state that it was &quot;mixed and mastered by Vic Anesini, Sony Music Studios, New York&quot;. (The tracks that appeared on the &quot;Time Circle, 1968–1972&quot; compilation were remixed as well, though those mixes are different.)

The 1996 CD reissue also contains five bonus tracks. Two of these appeared on the &quot;Time Circle, 1968–1972&quot; compilation, while the other three are previously unissued.

In 2017, Audio Fidelity reissued the album as a numbered limited edition hybrid SACD. This was the first release to use the original stereo mixes since the 1970s. This edition also includes bonus tracks in the same mixes as on the 1996 reissue.

<doc id="1326546" wikidata="Q7448015" url="?curid=1326546" title="Self-anchored suspension bridge">
<text>A self-anchored suspension bridge is a suspension bridge type in which the main cables attach to the ends of the deck, rather than directly to the ground or via large anchorages. The design is well-suited for construction atop elevated piers, or in areas of unstable soils where anchorages would be difficult to construct.

The load path of the self-anchored suspension (SAS) bridge converts vertical loads into tension forces in the main cables which are countered by compressive forces in the towers and deck. The system balances forces internally without external anchorage requirements, making it suitable for sites where large horizontal forces are difficult to anchor. This is similar to the method used in a tied-arch bridge where arch member compression is balanced by tension in the deck.

==History==

The self-anchored suspension bridge form originated in the mid-19th century, with a published description by Austrian engineer Josef Langer in 1859 and U.S. Patent No. 71,955 by American engineer Charles Bender in 1867. The form was applied to a handful of Rhine River crossings in Germany during the first half of the twentieth century.

==Examples==

* The SAS portion of the eastern span replacement of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge (2013) is a single-tower asymmetric bridge with a main span of . It is currently the largest SAS bridge in the world. 

* The Pingsheng Bridge (2006) in China is a single-tower bridge with a main span of .

* The Konohana Bridge (1990) in Japan and the Yeoungjong Grand Bridge (2000) in South Korea, both have two towers with a central span of .

* The Three Sisters Bridges of Pittsburgh are the earliest examples (1924–28) of this bridge type in the US.

* The Chelsea Bridge (1937) in London, England.

* The in Arkhangelsk, Russia. 

==Construction method==
The nature of the self-anchored suspension bridge necessitates the temporary construction of falsework, in the form of compression struts or an underdeck, before work begins on the permanent structure. This requirement is inherent in the structure&#x27;s definition. 

In the absence of suspension via cableage, the deck of a suspension bridge is incapable of self-support. On a suspension bridge of the more usual &quot;earth-anchored&quot; type, both of the primary (&quot;i.e.&quot;, horizontal) cable&#x27;s anchorages exist prior to construction in the form of solid terrain. In the &quot;self-anchored&quot; suspension bridge, however, the cable must be anchored to the bridge deck, which has yet to be built and will not bear its own weight; &quot;ergo&quot;, falsework must be employed until the final method of suspension is possible.

The cables apply strong axial forces onto the bridge girders, which may require strengthening. Therefore, self-anchored suspension bridge spans tend to be smaller than &quot;earth-anchored&quot; ones.

==Cable anchors==

As in a traditional suspension bridge, the primary cable type may be multiple parallel independent cables as in the image at right of the Hutsonville Bridge (no longer extant), or eyebars, or a more conventional composite cable.

<text>Aleksander Orłowski (9 March 1777 – 13 March 1832) was a Polish painter and sketch artist, and a pioneer of lithography in the Russian Empire.

==Life==

Orłowski was born in 1777 in Warsaw into an impoverished noble family, his father was a tavern-keeper. In early childhood he became known as a prodigy, and soon Izabela Czartoryska financed his first painting classes with the artist Jan Piotr Norblin. In 1793 Orłowski joined the Polish Army and fought in the Kościuszko Uprising against Imperial Russia and Prussia; he was wounded and returned to Warsaw for further studies, financed by Prince Józef Poniatowski. He studied with many notable painters of the age, including Norblin, Marcello Bacciarelli and Wincenty Lesserowicz.

In 1802, after the Partitions of Poland, he moved to Saint Petersburg, where he became a pioneer of lithography. He died there, aged fifty-five.

His works include countless sketches of everyday life in Poland and Russia, and scenes from the Kościuszko Uprising and other Polish wars.

Aleksander Orłowski is mentioned in &quot;&quot;, a poem written by Adam Mickiewicz in 1834, as well as in Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s works.

<text>Gender archaeology is a method of studying past societies through their material culture by closely examining the social construction of gender identities and relations.

Gender archaeologists examine the relative positions in society of men, women, and children through identifying and studying the differences in power and authority they held, as they are manifested in material (and skeletal) remains. These differences can survive in the physical record although they are not always immediately apparent and are often open to interpretation. The relationship between the genders can also inform relationships between other social groups such as families, different classes, ages and religions.

Feminist theory in gender archaeology has presented a new perspective and introduced some biases in the overall archaeological theory. This new perspective that focused on feminist viewpoint in archaeology was initiated by the rapid evolution in the 20th century, of the Western Societies outlook and interpretation of gender. The development of this perspective commenced from the late 1960s feminist movement.

Archaeologist Bruce Trigger noted that gender archaeology differed from other variants of the discipline that developed around the same time, such as working-class archaeology, indigenous archaeology, and community archaeology, in that &quot;instead of simply representing an alternate focus of research, it has established itself as a necessary and integral part of all other archaeologies.&quot;

==Theory==
Sex and gender are often used interchangeably in archaeological research. This dismisses the cultural constructiveness of gender by connecting it to the biological perspective of sex. Gender is present in material culture and can display how a culture was socially constructed. Archaeologists emphasizing the gender and sex dichotomy reject gender exploration within a culture and advances gender determinism. Furthermore, it promotes ethnocentrism by mirroring Western gender tradition in ancient cultures.

The feminist theory of gender archaeology gave archaeologists a new perspective of the past. This modern structure for theoretical perspective addressed many of the patriarchal biases instilled in the interpretation and excavation of past archaeology. Modern methods &quot;treat gender as a process, not a thing&quot;. The new gender studies introduced biases in archaeological theory. This shift of focus is theorized to be from the increase in women in the archaeological field and from the change in the social interpretation of gender. Women archaeologists began in the last twenty years, focusing on how the gender roles of our ancestors are not being represented correctly and also the gender roles were not as rigid as once believed. The theory supports that prior archaeologists were not equipped to differentiate between the sex and gender of our ancestors. Due to this lack of technology, scientists made assumptions about a variety of topics including the division of labor between the sexes and past societies&#x27; views of sexual anatomy and desires. This caused a gap in our understanding of past social structures. Gender archaeology pushes for theories that are gender inclusive, unbiased, and factual.

== Feminist archaeology ==

As a response to the little representation of female archaeologists and the invisibility of women in archaeological research, feminist archaeology was established. Feminist archaeology allows for the study of feminine roles in societies and verifying their importance. Additionally, it provides research of the women in prehistoric societies and analyzes the gendered activities that portray female agency and social engagement. Furthermore, feminist archaeology pushes a social and political agenda of female representation and the advancement of women in modern society. However, the social justice aspect of feminist archaeology tends to not be inclusive of race and class which can differentiate the experiences of a woman. Other movements such as black feminist archaeology further studies the intersectionality of race, gender, and class.

== Black feminist archaeology ==
Black feminist archaeology was created as a response to feminist archaeology and the misconceptions about black women present in archaeological research. The stories of black women, especially stories during slavery, are typically written by non-black scholars. These scholars tend to &quot;otherize&quot; black women and shape the stories based on pre-conceived stereotypes. The roles of black women in early archaeological writings would be based on assumptions and stereotypes. Black feminist archaeology encourages the stories of black women to be told by black female archaeologists. Giving black women cultural authority on female slavery helps eliminate further otherizing and helps deepen the understanding of the experiences encountered by black slaves. Furthermore, it allows for archaeology to be linked to a larger mission for social and political justice.

Black feminist archaeology allows archaeologists to view the roles of black women through a gendered lens. Viewing black slaves through a gendered lens provides archaeologists with the ability to explore the alternative roles of black slaves as women. For example, female slaves were often portrayed through a domineering and overbearing stereotype. Black women are often displayed as hyper-emasculating and anti-patriarchal in past archaeological research. These stereotypes were used to describe the gender roles present in captive households. Black feminist archaeologists studied the captive households without the attachment of stereotypes and concluded that captive households had a multidimensional family domestic system. Due to the conditions of slavery, women often played a dominant role in the family structure. This is due to the long hours worked by slave men not by previous misconceptions that enslaved men were absent from the home and enslaved women were anti-patriarchal.

== History ==
Archaeological research and theory often reflects the larger society at the time. Early archaeological research was often masculinized due to the dominant patriarchal society. The concept of gender was not traditionally explored in early archaeology because most research was male-centered and there was little representation of female archaeologists. Because of the masculinized make up of archaeology, racism, sexism, and ethnocentrism is often associated with the field and is prevalent in early archaeological works. Again, because archaeology often reflects the larger society, present day archaeological research is often more inclusive of gender and operates on a broader cultural landscape.

Archaeology used to be a mostly male-dominated field that discouraged gender research. But, in the last few decades with the rise of the 2nd feminist movement, female archaeology students began rejecting prior assumptions about gender and experiences in the past because they believed these assumptions distorted societies perception. The ongoing feminist movement that began in the late 1960s provoked the conception of a modern, feminized outlook on archaeology. Archaeology students were not satisfied with the limited information available about past women&#x27;s roles and experiences, and the assumptions that were made for decades. So they took it upon themselves to use new technology and research how women in the past lived. Began focusing on the difference between sexuality and gender, and the importance of Intersectionality. Margaret Conkey and Janet D. Spector (1984) are considered the first in the Anglo-American field to examine the application of feminist approaches and insights to archaeological practice and theory. However, Scandinavian, and specifically Norwegian, archaeologists had already in the early seventies started to follow a processual recipe for studying gender relations both within (pre)history and the profession itself. This resulted in a workshop titled &quot;Were they all men?&quot;
arranged by the Norwegian Archaeological Association in 1979, and a dedicated journal for feminist and gender studies in archaeology; &quot;K.A.N. Kvinner i Arkeologi i Norge&quot; [transl. &quot;Women in Archaeology in Norway&quot;] that published from 1985 until 2005.

Due to archaeology being a male-dominated field, it was prone to gender biases in research. These gender biases also apply to the topics that archaeologists investigate, with some topics more associated with women than men, such as cultural heritage, GIS, and isotope analyses. Little is known about gender roles in various ancient societies, but there is often an asymmetrical approach when depicting male and female roles in these societies. There are instances where male archaeologists have depicted the role of males of ancient times by mirroring present-day gender roles. Concepts of non-binary gender relations have been ignored due to the patriarchal structure of archaeology. For example, the figurines of the La Tolita-Tumaco culture combine male and female characteristics for a non-binary representation. Although these figurines were discovered a century ago, researchers did not acknowledge the mixed-gendering until recently because of gender biases.

Prominent archaeologists Margaret W. Conkey and Joan M. Gero detail the various ways gender is shaped in archaeological research. Gender can appear as sociobiological strategy, social construction, political economy, agency, and as an evolutionary process. These six theoretical approaches allow for the engendering of archaeology and imparts a well-developed position on gender.
Although the new feminized outlook on archeology addressed detrimental biases in the analysis of past societies and made progress in the study of gender, the feminist theory created a new set of criticisms about archeological research. Some archaeologists have openly criticized gender archaeology. One of those responsible was Paul Bahn, who in 1992 published a statement declaring that:

:The latest outbreak - which bears a great resemblance to the good old days of the new archaeology (primarily a racket for the boys) - is gender archaeology, which is actually feminist archaeology (a new racket for the girls). Yes, folks, sisters are doing it for themselves... Hardly a month goes by without another conference on &#x27;gender archaeology&#x27; being held somewhere by a host of female archaeologists (plus a few brave or trendy males who aspire to political correctness). Some of its aims are laudable, but the bandwagon shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to roll too far, as the new archaeology did, before the empresses&#x27; lack of clothes is pointed out by gleeful cynics.

==Gender archaeology in cross cultural studies==
It has been argued that gender is not genetically inherited but a process of structuring subjectivities, whereas sex is biologically determinate and static (Claassen 1992, Gilchrist 1991, Nelson 1997). To some professionals in the field, however, sex is not “the ground upon which culture elaborates gender” (Morris 1995, 568–569) and “sexing biases have been identified among the methods used in sexing skeletons… When sex is assigned to a skeleton of unknown sex, it is a cultural act” (Claassen 1992, 4), pointing out the more prominent cultural biases in the field of archaeology. These philosophies make Western biological anthropological methods of determining sex of fossils, not appropriate for cross-cultural studies given that not the same physical characteristics are used by all cultures to determine an individual&#x27;s sex. This approach of sexual fluidity, meaning that sex is not a cross-cultural concept and it is mostly culturally assigned, has been undermined by the wide application of DNA analysis to skeletal remains in Western archaeology. The conclusions drawn from such studies performed by Western archaeologists, will be biased by their cultural influences and concepts of sex, biology and DNA.

Hoping that analysis of both the material culture and ethnographic studies of the ancient society will provide a clearer picture of the role gender plays/played in that society, archaeologists are using more diverse types of data and incorporating other aspects of the collected data that they did not include before. Gender studies have often analyzed both males and females (Gilchrist 1991, Leick 2003), however, recent fieldwork has challenged the notion of this particular male-female dichotomy by expanding the categories to include a third or fourth gender in some non-Western societies that are explored (Herdt 1994, Hollimon 1997). Another way in which the fieldwork has challenged the usual study of gender archaeology is by analyzing more material culture like objects, activities and spatial arrangements in the landscape (Nelson 1997).

<text>Feminist archaeology employs a feminist perspective in interpreting past societies. It often focuses on gender, but also considers gender in tandem with other factors, such as sexuality, race, or class. Feminist archaeology has critiqued the uncritical application of modern, Western norms and values to past societies. It is additionally concerned with increasing the representation of women in the discipline of archaeology, and reducing androcentric bias within the field.

Feminist archaeology has expanded in recent years to include intersectional analyses, such as Black Feminist archaeology, Indigenous archaeology, and post-colonial archaeology. It also began to pay more attention to household studies, the study of masculinity, and the study of sexuality.

==Emergence of feminist archaeology==
Feminist archaeology initially emerged in the late 1970s and early 80s, along with other objections to the epistemology espoused by the processual school of archaeological thought, such as symbolic and hermeneutic archaeologies. Margaret Conkey and Janet Spector&#x27;s 1984 paper &quot;Archaeology and the Study of Gender&quot; summed up the feminist critique of the discipline at that time: that archaeologists were unproblematically overlaying modern-day, Western gender norms onto past societies, for example in the sexual division of labor; that contexts and artifacts attributed to the activities of men, such as projectile point production and butchering at kill sites, were prioritized in research time and funding; and that the very character of the discipline was constructed around masculine values and norms. For example, women were generally encouraged to pursue laboratory studies instead of fieldwork (although there were exceptions throughout the history of the discipline) and the image of the archaeologist was centered on the rugged, masculine, “cowboy of science”. In 1991, two publications marked the emergence of feminist archaeology on a large scale: the edited volume &quot;Engendering Archaeology&quot;, which focused on women in prehistory, and a thematic issue of the journal &quot;Historical Archaeology&quot;, which focused on women and gender in post-Columbian America. Outside the Americas, feminist archaeology enjoyed an earlier emergence and greater support among the greater archaeological community.

===Early feminist studies===
Notable challenges raised by early feminist archaeologists have concerned hunting and stone tool-making, among many other topics. The Man the Hunter paradigm in anthropology, named after a symposium given in the 1960s by some of the most prominent names in archaeology, bifurcated the hominid sexual division of labor along male and female sexes. Males were in charge of hunting, and presumably through this activity developed important evolutionary traits, such as increased brain size. Meanwhile, females stayed at home and raised the young. An assumption behind this model is that women were constrained from certain activities due to decreased mobility resulting from pregnancy and their role in raising young children. This model has been critiqued by feminist anthropologists, as underplaying the evolutionary importance of women in favor of portraying them strictly as passive objects of reproduction and nothing more. Adrienne Zihlman, tracing the evolutionary achievements ascribed to males as hunters, pointed out that female gathering activities could just as easily account for such adaptations.

Joan Gero challenged androcentric explanations of tool-making on several levels. First, the common assumption that tool-making was almost exclusively associated with men was almost certainly false; at the least, women were far more likely to produce their own tools as needed in domestic contexts rather than wait for a man to come along and do it for them. The argument behind this assumption, that men possess greater upper-body strength, was dismissed by Gero, who pointed out physical strength is not an imperative quality in someone skilled at making stone tools. Additionally, Gero pointed out the great emphasis in research time and money towards studies concerned with the most “masculine” of stone tools, such as projectile points, while stone tools likely made and used by women, for example utilized flakes, have been relatively ignored.

== Feminist and gender archaeologies ==
Since the early feminist critiques of archaeology, gender has gained enormous popularity within the discipline. The label “feminist” has not been embraced by most archaeologists, however. A split between gender and feminist archaeologies formed during the 1990s. Gender archaeology has become a wide umbrella, including, but not limited to, feminist work that employs queer theory, practice theory, and performance theory, among others. Many archaeologists engaged in gender research avoid the label of “feminist,” largely due to the perceived negative connotations of the word. Others within the discipline have an oversimplified understanding of feminist archaeology&#x27;s history and aims, and as a consequence mistakenly conflate it with postmodernism. Some archaeologists have argued against the continued incorporation of feminist thought, which is inherently political, into archaeological studies of gender. Few works in gender archaeology have actively engaged in challenging patriarchal power structures beyond rectifying androcentric histories. Feminist archaeology engages in challenging and changing interpretive frameworks employed by archaeologists: “Feminism is a politics aimed at changing gender-based power relations.” Noted feminist philosopher Alison Wylie delineates several guidelines imperative for conducting feminist archaeology:

# To propose research questions that address people oppressed by systems of inequality structured by gender, in order to change such conditions.
# Feminist research should be grounded in the situated experience of women and other groups marginalized by conventional gender structures.
# Researchers should be held accountable to those affected by their research; under no means should feminist research exploit others.
# Feminist researchers should engage in self-reflexivity, recognizing their personal social positions, interests, and values, and discussing how these interact with their research.

In contrast, gender archaeology not employed by feminists lacks such characteristics. Gender is currently a common topic of study in archaeology among non-feminists. Such studies focus on identifying gendered activities and material culture and on the gender roles of past peoples, but do not present themselves in an overtly political way. Non-feminist archaeologists are less compelled to position themselves within their work, or reflect on how their position affects their work. Investigating gender independent of feminism, however, elides the aims of early studies and represents gender and sex in a conceptually deficient manner.

== Ongoing feminist contributions to archaeology ==
Feminist archaeologists continue to challenge archaeological norms and expand research into new intellectual territories. They argue for the incorporation of alternative forms of knowledge and representation; for example, black and Indigenous epistemologies have been employed by feminist archaeologists. There continues to be a feminist critique of the masculine character and organization of archaeology.

=== Alternative forms of knowledge and presentation ===
One important realm of research for feminist archaeologists, along with some non-feminists, is de-centering Westernized forms of history in favor of privileging alternative conceptions and interpretations of the past, and exploring non-traditional ways of conveying knowledge. A growing body of work involves involvement with descendant communities, giving them a voice in archaeological investigations and interpretations of the past. The public demand for allowing descendant communities a voice in the African Burial Ground controversy highlighted the importance of this kind of work. Parallels have been drawn between feminist archaeology and Indigenous archaeology, focusing on how both work to break down the male, white, middle-class, Western monopoly to accessing knowledge about the past. This type of work helps to de-center the privileged position of Western knowledge without removing its relevance.

Additionally, feminist archaeologists have engaged in the use of fiction to help access the past. This has taken the form of plays, as seen in &quot;Red-Light Voices&quot;, based on letters and diaries by early 20th-century prostitutes to explore prostitution. Another example is seen in Laurie Wilkie’s fictional worker involved in the Federal Writers&#x27; Project, interjected in her archaeological study of an African-American midwife in the post-emancipation South. Janet D. Spector interpreted the meaning behind a single artifact through a fictional narrative in &quot;What This Awl Means&quot;. Narrative has been argued as an effective means by which archaeologists can create multivocal and more broadly accessible interpretations and presentations. The use of storytelling “demonstrate[s] 
how narrative is a powerful tool for bringing texture, nuance, and humanity to women’s experiences as evidenced through archaeology”).

=== Intersectional analysis ===
A common analytical technique employed by feminist (and some non-feminist) archaeologists is intersectional analysis, which, following the assertions of black feminists leading third-wave feminism in the U.S., maintains that gender cannot be accessed by itself but must be studied in conjunction with other forms of identity. In historical archaeology the linkage between gender, race, and class has been increasingly explored, but other aspects of identity, notably sexuality, have been examined as well in relation to gender. Intersectional analysis has not been limited to feminist archaeology, as illustrated by the prevalent use of gender-race-class as a means of exploring identity by historical archaeologists. Although many such studies have focused on white, middle-class women of the recent Anglo-American past, the articulation of gender with other aspects of identity is starting to be applied to Native American women and African Americans. The work of Kathleen Deagan on Spanish colonial sites in the US and Caribbean has pioneered a movement of study of gender in the Spanish colonies. The use of black feminist work, which calls to attention the inherent connectivity between gender and class in the U.S. has been an important step in advancing the use of intersectional analysis in archaeology. The intersectional approach faced a lot of “oppositional consciousness” that intervened in the flow of hegemonic feminist theory” and challenges in crossing the boundaries and negotiating with the terms of belonging in the community.

=== Black Feminist Archaeology ===
Black Feminist Archaeology is relatively new within the discipline of archaeology, and has been predominantly led by Black women in historical North American contexts. It focuses on the intersection between race, gender, and class in the interpretation of the American archaeological record, and rejects the separation or prioritization of one or another form of oppression. Black Feminist Archeology is heavily inspired by Black Feminist Anthropology, with the addition of archaeological theory introduced to create a &quot;purposefully coarse and textured analytical framework.&quot; This theoretical approach connects contemporary concepts of racism and sexism with the past, and draws connections between past influences and the way in which the past has influenced and shaped the present.  

==== Black Feminist Archaeological Contributions ====

===== Prehistoric Archaeology =====
Archaeologist Kathleen Sterling proposes two ways that black feminist theory can be applied to archaeology outside of historical North American contexts: (1) by studying the Paleolithic people of Europe in a way that attempts to be cognizant of our interpretations of primitiveness, while also acknowledging that our conceptions of primitiveness are racially coded; and (2) by studying anatomically modern humans (AMH) and Neanderthals, and the way in which they interacted. Sterling provides an example for how Black feminist theory can be applied to the latter.

Though exact dates are contested and variable, it can be said that anatomically modern humans (AMH) and Neanderthals interacted and lived among one another for a sustained amount of time. The ways in which AMHs and Neanderthals were thought to have interacted are through cultural transmission and competition. This interaction of cultural transmission is thought to be seen through the Châtelperronian tool tradition, as well as the presence of worked ivory in Upper Paleolithic sites, both of which are assumed to be diffused from AMHs. This interpretation of the cultural interaction between AMHs and Neanderthals, Sterling claims, assumes that Neanderthals are an inferior race to the superior Cro-Magnons, and learned nothing from this species that evolved over thousands of years successfully. The other leading interaction, competition, leads to the idea that the Neanderthal extinction was caused by Cro-Magnons out-competing them, which again lines up with Sterling&#x27;s assertion that this implies that Neanderthals were an inferior race.

However, new analyses have complicated this relationship. New finds of a collapsed shelter of mammoth bones, red ochre, and non-butchery marks on mammoth bones, dated before the arrival of AMHs to the area, suggest that Neanderthals were capable of performing this kind of symbolic activity without the influence or direction of AMHs. Another complicating factor is DNA evidence, that shows that there was substantial sexual interaction between the species of Homo across Eurasia. This DNA shows that interbreeding between these species was prevalent enough to continue to persist in modern genomes today, but not so much as to have overwhelming percentages in modern populations.

Unfortunately, little is known about the dynamics of these relationships between Neanderthals and AMHS. Citing a 2012 New York Times article, where Dr. Chris Stringer describes the inbreeding between Neanderthals and AMHs as “aggressive acts between competing human groups,” which he says are akin to modern day hunter-gatherer groups that have the same behavior, Sterling suggests that this reinforces tribal stereotypes. Ideas of the innateness of violence and primitiveness of men are also implied. Sterling juxtaposes this view of prehistoric competition with the sexual violence experienced by enslaved Black women in the United States, and the criminality imposed on relations between Black men and White women. Consensual interactions between people of different races was seen as a historical impossibly, and that woman were not granted sexual agency.

Still, competition does not explain the probabilities of infanticide, abortion, and abandonment of the children born from Neanderthal and AMH interaction, which again ignore the agency of women in these populations, Sterling claims. Instead of Neanderthals withering away from climatic violence, Sterling posits that they were rather absorbed into AMH communities because of their interbreeding and child rearing. This view echoes other theories about Neanderthal disappearance, but acknowledges their autonomy and agency as well, despite leading to their extinction as a species.

Sterling uses a Black Feminist framework to showcase how different aspects of life and identity intersect and impact areas of interest, and produce more complex understandings of prehistoric life.

===== Historical archaeology =====
Whitney Battle-Baptiste, a proponent of Black Feminist Archaeology (BFA), talks about the theories and methodology of Black Feminist Archaeology in her book Black Feminist Archaeology. According to Battle-Baptiste, BFA focuses on &quot;the intersectionality of race, gender, and class&quot; and the doubled or tripled form of oppression due to one&#x27;s multiple identities. BFA researches into the past with the goal of connecting it to present-day racism and sexism. BFA seeks to combine traditional archaeology&#x27;s strict material analysis with nearby historical and contemporary communities&#x27; cultural landscapes. Aided by these methods, Black Feminist Archaeology has the potential to diversify the questions asked and knowledge produced in archaeology. The Hermitage Plantation in Tennessee, Lucy Foster&#x27;s homesite in Massachusetts, and W.E.B. Du Bois&#x27; boyhood homesite in Massachusetts are examples Battle-Baptiste used to demonstrate the Black Feminist Archaeological approach to historical sites.

The Hermitage Plantation belonged to the seventh president Andrew Jackson, which had more than 160 slaves. In her research, Battle-Baptiste not only examines the physical landscape of the Hermitage but also delves into the cultural meanings, socialization processes, and Black agency within the space. Exploring the domestic sphere with an emphasis on race, she demonstrates that the types of domestic works captive women did differ from those of the European women. Relying on elder generations&#x27; social memory, Battle-Baptiste suggests that home is not the &quot;four walls of a twenty foot dwelling.&quot; It extends into larger environment to incorporate the yard, and it is a place for people &quot;to regroup, to learn strategies of survival, find strength, and create thoughts of resistance.&quot;

First discovered in the 1940s by Adelaide and Ripley Bullen, the Lucy Foster Homestead was home to Lucy Foster, who was born in 1767 in Boston, Massachusetts. As a child, she was taken in by a wealthy family, the Foster’s, and provided a home, and in return the family was granted compensation from the parish, and gained a working hand in daily chores and tasks. She served as the only African in the household for 11 years, before another child, Sarah Gilbert, was taken in by the Foster’s. After the abolition of slavery in Massachusetts, it appears that Lucy stayed with Hannah Foster, the matriarch of the Foster family. Limitation and lack of opportunities in post-emancipation Massachusetts may have contributed to this decision. At the age of 24, Lucy was “warned” out town by a letter that read, “You are, in the Name of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, directed to warn and give Notice unto Lucy a Negroe Woman formerly a Servant of Job Foster…” This was a common practice meant to reduce the populations of Black and Indigenous populations in New England. Two years passed without incident, and Lucy seems to have returned to Andover once again. At 26, she is said to have given a “Profession of Faith,” to the South Parish Congregational Church, and a month later, Peter, Lucy’s son, is baptized. Peter’s age, location of birth, and paternal relation is unknown. Following the death of Hannah Foster in 1812, Lucy was granted one cow, one hundred dollars, and an acre of her land, per the instructions in the will. This information comes before the fate of her own children, suggesting a degree of familiarity between Lucy and the Foster matriarch. Not much is known about Lucy following this, until her death in 1845  

A point of contention in Lucy’s story for Battle-Baptiste is the question of her poverty, and how poverty shaped Lucy’s identity, or her identity was shaped by poverty. She suggests that, like many other African American women did at the time, Lucy likely continued to work service jobs and other kinds of manual labor, like cooking, laundry, and sewing, evidenced by the number of needles, thimbles, and buttons found in her material assemblage. In 1813, Lucy is listed on the Overseers of the Poor and remains listed there until her death in 1845. She was never told to abandon her property or move to an alms house. Battle-Baptiste questions what poverty looks like in the material record, and how that material record was interpreted in the 1940s by the Bullens. In terms of Lucy’s material record, she had a wide array of items, including pearlware, Chinese porcelain, red ware, whitewall, and more, totaling 113 vessels, suggesting that ideas of poverty are variable throughout time. As Battle-Baptiste reanalyzed Lucy Foster’s homestead, she envisioned Lucy as independent, respected, and placed in a system that negotiated her freedom, but still experienced a degree of restriction based on her identity. The assemblage found at Lucy Foster’s home could also be evidence of her relative social position in Andover. Due to her isolation, it is possible that her positioning was advantageous to night travelers, and that this could be evidence of her role in the anti-slavery movement and contribution to the Underground Railroad.  

Despite the storied life that Lucy Foster lived, and the importance of her site as one of the first excavated African American sites in the United States, her story is not well known in archaeology, or in Massachusetts.  

=== Household studies ===
Archaeological studies of domestic sites have been particularly affected by ongoing feminist work. The long-standing trend in archaeology to associate women with domestic spaces, placed in opposition to the association with men and “public” spaces, has been a continuous locus of feminist research. Since the advent of the new millennium, there has been a shift away from such dichotomized spatial separation of gender. In historical archaeology, feminist archaeologists have been crucial to widening the definition of what constitutes a household from a familial model based on Western norms, such as household archaeology projects studying brothels and fraternities. By engaging with broader household literature, 
archaeologists have begun to re-conceive household, long considered autonomous analytical units, as political spaces, occupied by social actors occupying different social positions shaped by gender, race, age, occupation, socioeconomic status, and so on.

=== Feminist archaeology and the study of masculinity ===
Feminist concern has been primarily with women; however, emerging concern with the exploration and intricacies of masculinities in archaeology is rising. Masculine identity constructs and social reproduction of normative masculinity are some of the topics that have been addressed by a limited number of archaeologists. This area of study in general, however, remains relatively unexplored.

Inspired by the feminist trend, some archaeologists began to reflect on Archaeology as a discipline itself. Feminist critics lists three types of androcentrism exists in archaeology: 1) focusing on presumed male roles such as hunter, warrior, chief, and farmers; 2) under-analyzing in activities/processes considered to be in the female domain by western tradition; 3) interpreting data &quot;through the eyes of middle-age, middle-class, western white men.&quot; If androcentrism in archaeology is not addressed and if humans are not seen as gendered, archaeologists will miss the truth due to repeated reproduction of modern gender stereotypes. Following this trend, archaeologists challenge the hypothesis that, in ancient societies, women were always the gathers while men were the hunters. Maritime archaeology has also began to reflect on itself as a strongly masculine archaeology subfield. Oftentimes, maritime archaeology studies warfare, shipwrecks, and sea battles, leaving the social aspects of maritime life marginalized and unexplored. Maritime archaeologists interpretations of the pasts also fail to &quot;acknowledge there are other ways to be male and female.&quot; Considering the vastness of sea and the great potential of maritime archaeology, scholar Jesse Ransley advocate for the queering of maritime archaeology.

=== Feminist archaeology and the study of sexuality ===
Before the 1990s, there was a lack of archaeological research that dealt with sexuality. Entering into the 2000s, more researchers apply feminist theory and queer theory to study reproduction management, sexual representations, sexual identities, prostitution, and the sexual politics of institutions. For example, B.L Voss challenges the St. Augustine Pattern in colonial period by applying postcolonial and poststructural feminist theories. She examines the applicability of St. Augustine Pattern from six aspects of life and concludes that this pattern reduces the complexity of colonial history.

== Impact of feminism in archaeology ==
Feminist archaeology has had a lasting impact on archaeology that continues to grow today. Through the implementation of feminist thought in archaeology, visibility of women, both in the past and in the present, has been steadily increasing. One of the biggest contributions from feminist archaeology is the revisitation of past cultural circumstances, which has led to the reevaluation of women’s roles and revealed situations where women were more present than previously thought.

That being said, there remains an issue where women&#x27;s roles are indeed illuminated, but the roles and activities they performed are not engaged critically, and are, as Margaret Conkey says, &quot;unproblematized.&quot; In addition, the reinterpretation of androcentrism into gynocentrism, as with naming ancient figurines as “goddesses,” misses the point of meaningful Feminist critique.

Despite the positive change affected on archaeology, feminist thought is still not as widely implemented into mainstream archaeology, and when it is, it is often done so by women. When gender is considered in archaeological analyses, it is often only one factor amid a myriad of others within a larger framework, not a central tenet.

Additionally, there has been a lack of crossover between mainstream feminist academia and archaeological theory, showcasing that feminist archaeology has not yet made the jump into mainstream feminist circles.

<doc id="1326568" wikidata="Q907227" url="?curid=1326568" title="Nordion">
<text>Nordion Inc., a Sotera Health company, is a health science company that provides Cobalt-60 used for sterilization and treatment of disease (radiotherapy). 

Nordion is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with facilities in Vancouver, British Columbia and Laval, Quebec. Riaz Bandali is the company&#x27;s President. The company was acquired by Sotera Health in 2014 for million (equivalent to $million in ).

==History==
Founded in 1946, originally the radium sales department of Eldorado Mining and Refining Ltd., the division developed one of the first radiotherapy units that used the radioisotope cobalt-60 to destroy cancerous tumours.

Soon after, the division was given responsibility for selling radioisotopes produced by the newly established Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories, a nuclear research facility at Chalk River, Ontario. As a result, in 1951, Eldorado established a commercial products division (CPD) to manage the isotope business, especially cobalt-60 used in cancer treatment.

In 1952, the federal government created Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), a Crown corporation. Shortly thereafter, CPD was transferred to AECL, where it remained for the next 40 years and was renamed the radio-chemical division.

In 1988, ownership of the radio-chemical division was transferred from AECL to the Canadian Development Investment Corporation (CDIC). The company assumed a new name, Nordion International Inc. and was later sold to MDS Health Group in 1991.

In 2010, MDS Inc. completed a strategic repositioning which saw the Company divest its MDS Analytical Technologies and MDS Pharma Services businesses. Also in 2010, shareholders of MDS Inc. approved a change of name from MDS Inc. to Nordion Inc. The Company officially changed its name to Nordion Inc. on November 1, 2010.

In July 2013, Nordion completed the divestiture of its Targeted Therapies business to BTG plc. The company is now focused on Nordion and its sterilization technologies and medical isotopes businesses.

The company generated million USD (equivalent to $million in ) in revenues in the 2012 fiscal year, with over 70% of its revenue coming from within North America.

It was acquired by Sotera Health in 2014 for million (equivalent to $million in ). The company&#x27;s press release stated that the acquisition created &quot;the only vertically integrated sterilization company in the world.&quot;

Nordion sold its Medical Isotopes business in 2018.

==Products==
===Gamma technologies===

Customers use Nordion&#x27;s gamma-sterilization technologies to sterilize medical surgical supplies and devices, as well as certain consumer products, such as food and cosmetics.

Nordion supplies cobalt-60, the isotope that produces the gamma radiation required to destroy harmful micro-organisms. 

The company also designs and sells a family of production irradiators.

==Locations==
The Nordion corporate headquarters are located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The headquarters are the main manufacturing facilities for medical isotopes, used in medical imaging and radiopharmaceuticals, and for cobalt-60 sources and industrial food irradiators.

The Nordion Gamma Centre of Excellence (GCE) is a gamma irradiation research, training, and demonstration facility located in Laval, Quebec, Canada. The GCE is operated in partnership with the University of Quebec&#x27;s Armand Frappier Institute.

Nordion has an Asia Pacific Sales Office in Hong Kong.

<text>The Battle of Praga or the Second Battle of Warsaw of 1794, also known in Russian and German as the storming of Praga () and in Polish as the defense of Praga (), was a Russian assault on Praga, the easternmost community of Warsaw, during the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794. It was followed by a massacre (known as the Massacre of Praga) of the civilian population of Praga.

Praga was a suburb (&quot;Faubourg&quot;) of Warsaw, lying on the right bank of the Vistula river. In 1794 it was well fortified and was better strengthened than the western part of the capital, located on the left bank of the Vistula. Historian and professor Friedrich Christoph Schlosser labelled Praga as &quot;the key to Warsaw&quot;.

==Eve of the battle==
===Previous events===
Russian commander Alexander Suvorov inflicted a series of defeats on the rebels: the Battle of Krupczyce on 17 September, where Suvorov&#x27;s 12,000 soldiers were opposed by 4,000 Polish; the Battle of Brest on 19 September,—9,000 Russians fought here against 16,000 Poles; and the Battle of Kobyłka on 26 October, with 10,000 Russians ran into 4,500 Polish forces. After the Battle of Maciejowice, General Tadeusz Kościuszko was captured by Russians. The internal struggle for power in Warsaw and the demoralisation of the city&#x27;s population prevented General Józef Zajączek from finishing the fortifications surrounding the city both from the east and from the west. At the same time, the Russians were making their way towards the city.

===Opposing forces===

The Russian forces consisted of two battle-hardened corps under Generals Alexander (Aleksandr) Suvorov and Ivan Fersen. Suvorov took part in the recent Russo-Turkish war, then in the heavy fighting in Polesie. General Lieutenant Baron Fersen fought for several months in Poland but was also joined by fresh reinforcements sent from Russia. Each of them had approximately 11,000 men.

The Polish-Lithuanian forces consisted of a variety of troops. Apart from the rallied remnants of the Kościuszko&#x27;s army defeated in the Battle of Maciejowice, it also included a large number of untrained militia from Warsaw, Praga and Vilnius, a 500-man Jewish regiment of Berek Joselewicz as well as a number of scythemen (2,000 men) and civilians, plus 5,000 regular cavalry. The total number of irregulars was to be about 12,000 and the regular troops about 18,000. One of the sources, Suvorov&#x27;s report dated , claims 15,000 regular infantry and only 2,500 cavalry (17,500 regulars altogether) – according to the Poles–Lithuanians themselves. The forces were organised in three separate lines, each covering a different part of Praga. The central area was commanded directly by General Józef Zajączek, the northern area was commanded by Jakub Jasiński and the southern by Władysław Jabłonowski. In general, the forces defending Praga should be estimated at 22,000 to 26,000 men, although together with the townspeople involved, Praga was defended by 30,000 men, which is also indicated by Suvorov, and had 104 cannons. There is also a closer figure of 28,000 men. Suvorov came to the walls of Praga from his camp at Kobyłka with 16,000 to 18,000 footsore troops (regulars) and 86 cannons. Suvorov also had 4,000 regular cavalry and 2,000 irregular Cossack cavalry at the assault. The total number of regular troops was up to 25,000 with as many as 7,000 regular cavalrymen; Cossacks were up to 5,000 – these were the corps of Derfelden (first and second columns; 4,600 men), Potemkin (third and fourth columns; 5,800 men), Fersen (fifth, sixth, and seventh columns; 7,000 men), and General Major Shevich&#x27;s reserve (4,000 men). That is, the forces may have been roughly equal overall, however, largely due to the declining morale of the Varsovians, they put up just 2,000 men — irregular soldiers — to defend the ramparts. The main force, the regular troops, stood behind fortifications as a reserve on the vast field according to Kościuszko&#x27;s plan. After a reconnaissance by the Russian side, up to 24,055 men, inclusive of 41 infantry battalions and 81 cavalry squadrons, would come out for the storming together with reserve units; in the village of Okuniew a wagenburg was stationed.

==Battle==
The Russian forces reached the outskirts of Warsaw on 2 November 1794, pushing back Polish-Lithuanian outposts with bayonets, launching the reconnaissance and declaring the disposition. Immediately upon arrival, they started erecting artillery batteries and in the morning of 3 November started an artillery barrage of the Polish-Lithuanian defences. This made Józef Zajączek think that the opposing forces were preparing for a long stay there; the Russians disguised the forthcoming attack in order to give the rebels reason to expect a siege. The Polish artillery responded with vigour. However, Suvorov&#x27;s plan assumed a fast and concentrated assault on the defences rather than a bloody and lengthy siege.

At 3 o&#x27;clock in the morning of November 4, the Russian troops silently reached the positions just outside the outer rim of the field fortifications. The Russia&#x27;s enemy did not expect an attack on this day. First and second columns began preparations; besides, the Polish general fatigue and the low spirits of their leaders contributed to the fact that the Russian advance was noticed too late. The Polish forward posts, who stood at the back of the trous de loup, fled as soon as the attacker approached. Two hours later started an all-out assault.

General Wawrzecki arrived in Praga at 4 a.m. on 4 November and was talking with Zajączek. Suddenly shots rang out. Wawrzecki rushed to the left flank, where Jasiński commanded, and Zajączek to the right. Then Wawrzecki also went to the right flank. There were no orders for the reserves to operate in the inner field, and the battle turned into a random fighting, very persistent on the ramparts, but completely disorderly.

=== Derfelden and Potemkin&#x27;s actions ===

Derfelden&#x27;s columns took possession of the rampart without much difficulty. The Polish island batteries and on the Vistula&#x27;s left bank tried to act in the flank of General Major Lacy&#x27;s first column, led by the column-master Semyonov, but its shots did not reach their enemy and the 22 guns of Captain Begichev&#x27;s battery answered their enemy with rapid fire. The Polish cavalry could easily hold Lacy in the open field behind the rampart, and the infantry in the narrow passage between the Vistula and the buildings; but it failed. Part of the Polish cavalry began to line up in front of the first column, but two squadrons of the Kiev Horse Jaeger under the command of Zoss &quot;jumped over the ditch and with the greatest eagerness rushed on the crowd of enemy cavalry&quot; and instantly knocked it down. The private reserve of the first column (Lieven&#x27;s Tula Regiment) came in the interval between the columns, rushed to assault at the same time as the first column&#x27;s main forces seized the rampart, and immediately began to arrange the crossing. Captain Begichev with his artillery and Brigadier Polivanov, who was covering him, bored with inaction and seeing the success of the storming, rushed forward of their own accord, crossed the passage of the Tula Regiment and began an artillery fire in flank and rear of the batteries of the third line of trenches.

Artillery Captain Sakovich (of Begichev&#x27;s command) was wounded in the breast, but continued to operate his guns.

Lacy was wounded; Colonel Zherebtsov took the command instead of him, and Colonel Kokhovsky with his Phanagorians rushed to the bridge, drived his enemy from street to street and seizes the head of the bridge, i.e. cut off the defender&#x27;s way of retreat. Some of the Poles running in front of the column drowned in the Vistula, and some were captured. The trous de loup, the ditch, the rampart and the neighbourhood were littered with corpses. Generals Meyen and Krupiński became prisoners of war; Jasiński was killed with a sabre in his hand.

The second and third columns also took possession of the rampart almost without delay, so that in a very short time the rampart west of Piaskowa Góra (eng. &quot;Sand Mountain&quot;) was in Russian hands. Prime Major Markov with the first battalion of the Apsheron Regiment climbed up the assault ladders on the rampart, hit the Poles from here with jaeger rifle fire, then broke into the fortress, drove the enemy in front of him, and took possession of the battery. The second battalion of the Apsheronians came in the rear of another battery, and no one escaped. Opposed on the rampart, the Poles joined with reinforcements and again rushed on the Apsheron battalion, but in vain, the Polish cavalry tried to take in the third column&#x27;s flank, but two battalions of Kherson Grenadiers lined the front and rushed with bayonets—the Polish cavalry retreated. Then the second and third columns rushed straight into Praga.

=== Fourth column ===

Wawrzecki rushed from side to side, but order could not be restored.

Hardest of all was the fourth column of General Major Buxhoeveden, which attacked Piaskowa Góra and the menagerie.

The Byelorussian Jaeger Corps, at the head of the fourth column marched to the cavalier; the fourth battalion of the Livonian Jaeger Corps marched to the coal battery and to the menagerie.

Heavy artillery fire from the batteries, then from the cavalier, and rifle fire from behind the line of abatises entailed heavy losses, but the Russians did not stop; The Second Major Kharlamov of the Azov Regiment crossed the trous de loup and ditch, beat back two cannon, &quot;through which he gave the whole column a way to go&quot;; near the menagerie there was a fierce melee, which forced Buxhoeveden to divide the column into parts to facilitate the attack on the menagerie&#x27;s vast park. The Poles, outflanked, finally gave up this stronghold as well; about this time the Polish powder cellar exploded, which further increased the disorder among the Poles. General Giessler, who commanded here, was taken prisoner with 20 officers. In the struggle with Buxhoeveden&#x27;s column the 500 regiment of Jews showed strong persistence; but their colonel, also a Jew, Hershko, was not at this time with the regiment and preferred to remain in Warsaw.

=== Fifth and sixth columns&#x27; actions ===

If the fourth column endured a hard fight, but together with the first three columns, it made Fersen&#x27;s task very easy. The fifth column of General Major Tormasov almost in one moment seized the ramparts and batteries, on the heels of the retreating broke into the suburb and reached the bridge after the first column. General Major sixth column was slightly delayed by the Poles, but also soon arrived in Praga.

=== Denisov&#x27;s attack ===

General Major with the seventh column still at night occupied the Las village in front of the fortifications of Lieutenant Colonel Jabłonowski. A Polish deserter and prisoners told about the location of his batteries, trous de loup and the number of troops.

Under flank fire from the Vistula&#x27;s left bank Denisov&#x27;s troops moved forward through the trous de loup, in front went Colonel Count Apraxin with Kozlov Infantry Regiment; part of the troops went to the Polish rear waist-deep in water. Having taken possession of the batteries, Denisov sent his cavalry (6 squadrons of the Elizabethgrad Cavalry Regiment and Cossacks of Krasnov, Second Major Denisov and Colonel Popov) for pursuit. Having cut off the Poles&#x27; retreat; Denisov drove them to a spit, in the corner between the Vistula and a swampy channel; the cannons of Captain Rezvoy&#x27;s artillery pierced through his enemy&#x27;s crowd thickly huddled on the spit; the extermination was merciless; the Poles, seeking escape, threw themselves into the Vistula and perished in great numbers. And on the opposite bank of the Vistula, only half a kilometre (0.3 mi), the inhabitants of Warsaw were gathered, and their brethren perished before their eyes.

According to Denisov&#x27;s testimony, the Poles lost 1,218 men killed, several hundred drowned, 16 cannons, and 3 artillery caissons; Jabłonowski himself and 1,300 officers and lower ranks were taken prisoner. Denisov then arrived at the bridge almost simultaneously with the first column. Warsaw was defenceless. The first, fifth and seventh columns were at the bridge and were free to cross to the Vistula&#x27;s left bank. Panic spread among the Poles. Zajączek, lightly wounded by a bullet in the stomach, hurriedly left for Warsaw. &quot;A real &quot;zając&quot; (hare)&quot;, the Poles said of him afterwards, alluding to his surname.

=== Fighting in the streets of Praga ===
General Wawrzecki tried to stop the fleeing Polish regiments, but all was for nothing. Accompanied by an officer and two natives, he rode through Praga. It was as if a tetanus had come over him, so that an officer and two soldiers took him off his horse, brought him to his senses, and carried him across the bridge on foot for greater safety. It was dawning; the day was quiet and clear, the sun was shining and illuminating the bloodshed that was taking place in the suburb; the Russian jaegers were entering the bridge, and the Polish commander-in-chief was horrified,—what a terrible and near danger threatened the capital! Near the bridge stood cannon, but the artillerymen hid in the houses, so Wawrzecki himself pulled out one, brought him to the cannon and forced him to shoot. At last the Polish guard came out, and the inhabitants joined it and began to break the bridge. The Russians on the other side broke part of the bridge, &quot;burned and thus interrupted the enemy&#x27;s withdrawal&quot;—the immediate transition to the left bank was not part of Suvorov&#x27;s calculations. The fire shifted from the bridge to the suburb houses and Praga went up in flames.

The main rampart was taken by the Russians in 1,5 hours after the assault beginning, and at 9 a.m. Praga was occupied.

Suvorov himself was on a hill, a kilometre (0.6 mi) from the Polish fortifications at Piaskowa Góra, i.e. he was approximately in the middle of the line of his troops, which facilitated the task of monitoring and controlling the battle course. By the speed with which the Russians appeared at the fortifications and moved forward, as well as by the reports of orderlies and chiefs, he saw that the troops fought not only with special energy, but also with extreme fierceness.

=== Brief summary ===

Thus, the defenders were completely surprised and shortly thereafter the defence lines were broken into several isolated pockets of resistance, bombarded by the Russians with canister shots with a devastating effect. General Zajączek retreated from his post, leaving the remainder of his forces without a single command. This made the Poles and Lithuanians retreat towards the centre of Praga and then towards Vistula.

The heavy fighting lasted for four hours and resulted in a complete defeat of the Polish-Lithuanian forces. Joselewicz survived, being severely wounded, but almost all of his command was annihilated; Jasiński was killed fighting bravely on the front line. Only a small part managed to evade encirclement and retreated to the other side of the river across a bridge; hundreds of soldiers and civilians fell from a bridge and drowned in the process.

==Massacre==


After the battle ended, the Russian troops, against the orders given by Suvorov before the battle, started to smite, loot and, as mentioned, burn the entire borough of Warsaw partly in revenge for the slaughter of the Russian Garrison in Warsaw during the Warsaw Uprising in April 1794, when about 2,000 Russian soldiers died (plus a similar number of captives), and partly because, since so many of the ordinary inhabitants were armed, it was not always easy to distinguish soldier from civilian. Although neither the disposition nor the order mentioned the booty, but this was the custom of the time, and Suvorov&#x27;s military doctrine very clearly said: &quot;If you take the camp — everything is yours, if you take the fortress — everything is yours&quot;. The looting went on all day and night, but the soldiers did not make much money from it, because there was almost nothing to loot. The Praga&#x27;s Jewish population was characterised by poverty, and if anyone had anything more expensive, he got it out of the house beforehand,—especially the non-bulky property, which could be the only things of soldiers&#x27; use. Faddey Bulgarin recalled the words of General Ivan von Klugen, who took part in the Battle of Praga, &quot;We were being shot at from the windows of houses and the roofs, and our soldiers were breaking into the houses and killing all who happened to get in the way… In every living being our embittered soldiers saw the murderer of our men during the uprising in Warsaw… It cost a lot of effort for the Russian officers to save these poor people from the revenge of our soldiers… At four o&#x27;clock the terrible revenge for the slaughter of our men in Warsaw was complete!&quot; Almost all of the area was pillaged and inhabitants of the Praga district were tortured, raped and murdered. The exact death toll of that day remains unknown, but it is estimated that up to 20,000 people were killed, including military, armed and unarmed inhabitants. Suvorov himself wrote: &quot;The whole of Praga was strewn with dead bodies, blood was flowing in streams.&quot; It was thought that unruly Cossack troops were partly to blame for the uncontrolled destruction. Russian historians (e.g., ) state that Suvorov tried to stop the massacre by ordering the destruction of the bridge to Warsaw over the Vistula river with the purpose of preventing the spread of violence to the capital, although Polish historians dispute this, pointing out to purely military considerations of this move, such as to stop Polish and Lithuanian troops stationing on the left bank from attacking Russian soldiers. Kipnis asserted that when Suvorov learned of the civilian bloodshed, he immediately rode to Praga, but when he received the news, it was too late—the blood of innocent had been spilled, and spilled a lot; nevertheless, Suvorov brought the soldiers to their senses and stopped the massacre.

==Aftermath==
Russian casualties were 1,540 killed and wounded. Other estimates are 2,000 dead and wounded. Poland suffered losses of some 9,000 to 10,000 killed, wounded, and drowned, as well as 11,000 to 13,000 taken prisoner. According to additional estimates, the Poles suffered 8,000 killed and up to 14,680 captured. After the battle the commanders of Warsaw and large part of its inhabitants became demoralised. To spare Warsaw the fate of its eastern suburb, General Tomasz Wawrzecki decided to withdraw his remaining forces southwards and on November 5. Warsaw was captured by the Russians with little or no opposition. It is said that after the battle General Aleksandr Suvorov sent a report to Catherine the Great consisting of only four words: &quot;Hooray! Warsaw is ours!&quot; The Empress of Russia replied equally briefly: &quot;Bravo Fieldmarshal, Catherine&quot;, promoting him to Field Marshal for this victory. The massacre of Praga dented Suvorov and the Russian army&#x27;s reputation throughout Europe.

== National historiographies ==
Russian writers and historians have tried to either justify or present this massacre as an revenge for Polish conquest of Moscow in 1612 or the heavy losses Russian garrison sustained during the Warsaw Uprising of 1794. Such reasoning was immortalized after 1831 when Russians once again crushed a Polish uprising (the November Uprising) against Russia&#x27;s occupation of Poland; shortly afterward Alexander Pushkin compared the Praga massacre with the events of events of 1612: &quot;Once, you celebrated the shame of Kreml, tsar&#x27;s enslavement. But so did we crushed infants on Praga&#x27;s ruins&quot;. Similar sentiments can be seen in the poetry of Vasily Zhukovsky and Gavrila Derzhavin or plays of Mikhail Kheraskov and Michail Glinka. On the other hand Polish literature and historiography has a tendency to be biased in the other direction, dwelling on the description of Russian cruelty and barbarism.

Similar arguments were used by Russian historians Pyotr Chaadayev, and even Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and can be seen repeated in the Soviet-era reference works as the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. After the Second World War this entire event, like many other cases of Russo-Polish conflicts, was a taboo topic in the Soviet Bloc, where Soviet propaganda now tried to create an illusion of eternal Slavic unity and friendship. Any references to the massacre of Praga were eliminated from textbooks, existing academic references were restricted and censored, and further research was strongly discouraged. Although after the fall of communism the restrictions to research were lifted, this is still one of the controversial and sensitive topic in the Polish-Russian relations.

<doc id="1326598" wikidata="Q5526576" url="?curid=1326598" title="Gaspard Monge's mausoleum">
<text>[[Gaspard Monge]], whose remains are deposited in the burying ground in Père Lachaise Cemetery, at Paris, in a magnificent [[mausoleum]], was professor of geometry in the École polytechnique at Paris, and with Denon accompanied Napoleon Bonaparte on his memorable expedition to Egypt; one to make drawings of the architectural antiquities and sculpture, and the other the geographical delineations of that ancient country. He returned to Paris, where he assisted Denon in the publication of his antiquities. At his decease the pupils of the Polytechnique School erected this mausoleum to his memory, as a testimony of their esteem, after a design made by his friend, Monsieur Denon. The mausoleum is of Egyptian architecture, with which Denon had become familiarly acquainted.

==Description==

There is a bust of Monge placed on a terminal pedestal underneath a canopy in the upper compartment, which canopy is open in front and in the back. In the cavetto cornice is an Egyptian winged globe, entwined with serpents, emblematical of time and eternity; and on the face below is engraved the following line:—

:A GASPARD MONGE.

On each side of the upper compartment is inscribed the following memento mori:

:LES ELEVES.
:DE L&#x27;ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE.
:A G. MONGE.
:COMTE DE PELUSE.

Underneath this inscription is carved in sunk work an Egyptian lotus flower in an upright position; on the back of the mausoleum is the year in which Gaspard Monge died. The body is in the cemetery below.

:AN. MDCCCXX.

<text>The Battersea Arts Centre (&quot;BAC&quot;) is a performance space specialising in theatre productions. Located near Clapham Junction railway station in Battersea, in the London Borough of Wandsworth, it was formerly Battersea Town Hall. It is a Grade II* listed building.

In March 2015, while a major programme of renovation works were underway, the Grand Hall was severely damaged by fire. Approximately 70% of the theatre, including the 200-capacity Council Chamber, the Scratch Bar and the Members Library, was saved from the fire and remains open.

The building is now used for theatre shows, weddings, filming, shoots and meeting room hire.

==History==
The building, designed in 1891 by E. W. Mountford, opened in 1893 as Battersea Town Hall, the administrative headquarters of the Borough of Battersea, shortly after the borough was transferred from the county of Surrey to the newly formed County of London. It is built from Suffolk red brick and Bath stone, on the site of Jane Senior″s &quot;Elm House&quot;, a villa with a small wooded estate.

Bertrand Russell&#x27;s essay &quot;Why I Am Not a Christian&quot; was originally given as a talk in the hall, on 6 March 1927, under the auspices of the South London Branch of the National Secular Society.

Following proposals by London Borough of Wandsworth to demolish large parts of the building, a vociferous and ultimately successful campaign to save it was fought by the Victorian Society and Battersea Society it was given Grade II* listed protected status in February 1970.

===Organ===
In 1901, a large pipe organ was installed in the Grand Hall by Norman &amp; Beard. This was an unusual instrument designed by Robert Hope-Jones, a pioneering organ builder who invented many aspects of the modern pipe organ. His ideas went on to form the basis of the Wurlitzer theatre organ in the 1920s and 30s. It was said to be the largest Hope-Jones organ to survive, and was partially restored in 2008–2009. In the 2015 fire, although much of the organ was destroyed, including the console, bellows, wiring and architectural cases, the soundboards and much of the pipework survived as they were off site undergoing restoration. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

===Arts centre===

The building became a community arts centre in 1974. BAC currently receives grants towards the building&#x27;s operating costs from Arts Council England and the London Borough of Wandsworth, among others. The centre is a registered charity. The theatre was founded in 1981.

Following the departure of Tom Morris in 2003, David Jubb became Battersea Arts Centre&#x27;s Artistic Director in 2004, serving as Joint Artistic Director with David Micklem between 2007 and 2012. In October 2018, David Jubb announced that he would step down from his role in April 2019. Tarek Iskander is Battersea Arts Centre&#x27;s current Artistic Director and CEO, appointed in December 2018.

BAC operates a &quot;scratch&quot; methodology as part of its &quot;ladder of development&quot; for new work. Performances are shown at various stages of development to an outside audience, whose input and criticism guides the further evolution of the work.

====Past productions====
* Punchdrunk Theatre Company&#x27;s promenade performance of &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe ran through most of the building from September 2007 to April 2008. The performance was interactive, and was seen by over 400,000 people over its seven-month sellout run. Since audience members were required to wear masks throughout the performance, a number of famous actors attended the play anonymously, including Jeff Goldblum and Joanna Lumley.
* Richard Thomas&#x27;s early work as Kombat Opera, including &quot;Tourette&#x27;s Diva&quot;, leading to the development of &quot;Jerry Springer - The Opera&quot;, which premièred at BAC in 2002, before transferring to the Royal National Theatre.
* &quot;Jackson&#x27;s Way&quot;, the winner of the 2004 Perrier Award in Edinburgh. A one-man show which mocks the world of motivational speaking and embraces it through encouraging &#x27;pointless actions&#x27;.

===Use in film and TV===
The old Town Hall was used as a location in the 1975 film &quot;Slade In Flame&quot; featuring rock band Slade. The Town Hall was the location for the 21st birthday party of the character played by Dave Hill. 

On 8 and 9 October 2012, the pop band McFly used the location to film a video for their single &quot;Love Is Easy&quot;.

The Sky Arts TV series Portrait Artist of the Year is filmed at BAC.

===Beer festival===

Every February since 1991, the BAC has hosted the three-day-long Battersea Beer Festival.

===Murders===

On 31 January 1998 the Annual Rockers Reunion was held at the centre. Members of the Outcasts Motorcycle Club served as the security at the reunion. In a coordinated attack via microphone headsets, about 40 members of the Hells Angels from various chapters all over England arrived uninvited at the reunion armed with baseball bats, knives, iron bars and machetes. The Hells Angels proceeded to attack and beat various Outcasts. Two of the Outcasts, David Armstrong and Malcolm St. Clair, were killed during the melee. Only one Hells Angel was convicted of charges relating to the incident. Ronald &quot;Gut&quot; Wait, the vice president of the Angels Essex chapter, was convicted of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.

===Fire===
On 13 March 2015, during a major renovation programme, a fire broke out in the roof, and engulfed the building, causing severe structural damage, including the collapse of the tower. The Grand Hall and Lower Hall were destroyed. No injuries were reported.

The fire was tackled by about 80 London Fire Brigade firefighters and 12 fire engines. Firefighters were able to save a large part of the building including several of the smaller theatre spaces. Two shows went ahead as planned one day after the fire, and BAC has maintained much of its artistic programme, despite losing the ability to hire out the larger venues (a significant source of income).

Jubb launched a fundraising campaign to help the centre soon afterwards., and in May announced that during the rebuilding of the Grand Hall, BAC would also create a large off-site theatre from mid-2016 to end of 2017 &quot;for the presentation of visionary and exciting new theatre while we rebuild the Grand Hall&quot;.

In 2018, the rebuilding of the Grand Hall was completed, overseen by architects Haworth Tompkins, who had been working with BAC on a phased transformation of the centre for over a decade. The vaulted plaster ceiling of the Grand Hall was replaced with a similar design in three layers of CNC-cut plywood; adjacent corridors were left scorched and bare of plaster. The mosaic floor, manufactured by Jess Rust in the eighteen hundreds, survived the fire.

<doc id="1326608" wikidata="Q1542545" url="?curid=1326608" title="Poliochne">
<text>Poliochne, often cited under its modern name Poliochni (), was an ancient settlement on the east coast of the island of Lemnos. It was settled in the Late Chalcolithic and earliest Aegean Bronze Age and is believed to be one of the most ancient towns in Europe, preceding Troy I. Anatolian features of the earliest layers were affected by cultural influences from Helladic Greece, about the start of Early Helladic II, ca. 2500 BC.

The site, with houses huddled together sharing party walls, was unearthed by excavations of the Italian School of Archaeology at Athens (&quot;Scuola archeologica Italiana di Athene&quot;), beginning in 1930. It is believed that Troy was its main rival commercially; a rivalry that led to the decline of Poliochne circa 2000 BC.

==Archaeology==
Following initial soundings, regular campaigns at Poliochne were undertaken under A. Della Seta (it) in 1931-36, when they were suspended. Following Della Seta&#x27;s death, excavations were resumed in 1951-53, 1956 and 1960.

During 1994-1997, Greek archaeologists discovered a more recent Bronze Age settlement on the tiny uninhabited island of Koukonesi situated in the Moudros harbour, west of Poliochne. This settlement was developed circa 2000-1650 BC, and the findings again prove commercial ties with Asia Minor, and with Aegean islands and mainland Greece. Mycenaean ceramics of the 13th century BC found on Koukonesi could prove that, around when the traditional era of the Trojan War took place, the Greeks had a permanent settlement there, rather than just a commercial outpost, understanding the importance of the straits connecting the Aegean and the Black Sea.

== Periodisation ==
From 1951 the site was excavated under the direction of Luigi Bernabò Brea. He clarified the stratigraphy by assigning colors to different phases of the settlement. There are seven numbered phases altogether, and the names are given here in Italian, as well as English. Black/Nero (I), Blue/Azzurro (II), Green/Verde (III), Red/Rosso (IV), Yellow/Giallo (V), Brown/Bruno (VI), and Mycenaean (VII).

===Black Period===
This period corresponds to the Early Bronze I period in the Aegean. It has 7 different levels of construction, thus testifying to a long and continuous occupation over a long period. The villages during this phase consist of huts that are generally round or oval in shape with stone bases.

For this period, the site has only been excavated under megaron 605 and megaron 832. Under megaron 832, excavations have shown 7 consecutive layers over 2 meters in depth. Under the megaron 605, only 3 levels are visible.

As for the ceramics, it has painted decorations, white in color, with linear patterns. There are some similarities to the Eutresis culture ceramics.

Myrina, also on Lemnos, and Koukonesi (very close by), have also been excavated recently. Myrina is considered contemporary with Poliochni Black period.

===Blue Period===
It follows the black period, and we notice during this period an enlargement of the city with the construction of a defensive wall. There&#x27;s also the construction of a typically Cretan megaron, testifying to an exchange between Crete and the city of Poliochni.

This period, like the previous one, has 7 construction phases. Now is the first appearance of metal items. The finds include pins, awls, and a dagger. A mould for a shaft-hole axe has also been found, which indicates local casting of various tools. Stamp seals also appear at this period. This phase may correspond to early Troy I (Renfrew), or to the Troy I/II transition (Podzuweit).

===Green period===
This is the shortest period of the site, but it may be associated with Troy I or II, through ceramics. It has only 3 architectural phases.

===Red period===
This period has 4 to 8 different architectural phases. A hoard of bronze items was found from this period that includes a shaft-hole axe, daggers and other tools and weapons.

===Yellow period===
The yellow period features a large fortified town. Houses are constructed as large multi-roomed blocks with megaron units at the core. These architectural ensembles are quite different in detail from the corresponding architecture of Troy I-II, or Thermi III-V. Similar to Troy IIg, a lot of gold jewellery was found. An imported cylinder seal was also found. This phase was contemporary with late Troy II, and Troy III. There may also be some correspondences with Troy IV.

A gap in occupation has been detected after the Yellow period.

=== Brown period ===
Poliochni is resettled during the Brown period, which may be contemporary with Troy V.

<text>The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Ten-pin bowling|Bowling]] Championship is a sanctioned women&#x27;s championship in college athletics. Unlike many NCAA sports, only one National Collegiate championship is held each season with teams from Division I, Division II, and Division III competing together. Seventeen teams, nine of them automatic qualifiers and the other eight being at-large selections, are chosen by the NCAA Bowling Committee to compete in the championship. The championship was first held in April 2004.

The most successful team is Nebraska with 6 titles. Jacksonville State, in its inaugural season as an NCAA bowling program, is the reigning champion, coming back from 3 games to 2 deficit to defeat Arkansas State 4 games to 3 in the 2024 championship held at Thunderbowl Lanes in Allen Park, MI.

Nebraska is the only program to qualify for all 20 NCAA Bowling Championships since the NCAA started sponsoring bowling in the 2003–04 season.

==Format==
The collegiate bowling season runs from late October through the end of March, and the National Collegiate Women&#x27;s Bowling Championship is held in April.

===Through 2017===
The format for the championships from 2004 to 2017 began with qualifying rounds in which each team bowled one five-person regular team game against each of the other seven teams participating in the championship.

Teams would then be seeded for bracket play based on their qualifying rounds win–loss record and then competed in best-of-seven-games Baker matches in a double elimination tournament. In the Baker format, each of the five team members, in order, bowls one frame until a complete (10-frame) game is bowled. A Baker match tied 3½ games to 3½ games after seven games is decided by a tiebreaker, using the Modified Baker format, which takes the scoring from only frames 6 thru 10.

===2018 and 2019===
In previous years, all eight participants received at-large bids. In 2018 the NCAA Women&#x27;s Bowling Committee selected a field of ten participants. Six teams are automatic qualifiers from the conferences that have been granted an automatic bid, and the other four receive at-large bids. At that time, the six conferences that fulfilled the criteria to be granted an automatic qualifier were the Division I Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, Northeast Conference, Southland Bowling League, and Southwestern Athletic Conference, plus the Division II Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association and East Coast Conference. The ten participants were ranked and seeded based on the criteria used by the selection committee. The top six seeds automatically entered the championship bracket. The four lowest-seeded teams played in on-campus opening round matches to determine the two participants advancing to the eight-team championship bracket. To minimize travel costs, the matchups were determined by geographical proximity rather than seedings.

In 2019, the championship field expanded from 10 to 12 teams, coinciding with two new conferences fulfilling the criteria for automatic qualification—the Division II Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) and the Division III Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference. Accordingly, eight conference champions received automatic bids, and the NCAA Women&#x27;s Bowling Committee selected four at-large teams to fill out the 12-team field. The top four teams were seeded into the Championship bracket, while the eight remaining teams competed in four play-in matches. The winners of these matches were seeded into the eight-team championship bracket.

Qualifying rounds were eliminated in favor of a seeded double-elimination bracket. Each match within the bracket consisted of best-of-three matches using specified formats (five-person regular team matches, Baker total pinfall, and Baker match play).

The championship finals were a best-of-seven match using Baker match play rules. The tiebreaker rule used through 2017 will still apply to Baker match play in the new format.

===From 2020===
The championship was scheduled to expand to 16 teams in 2020. The number of automatic bids was reduced by one after the MIAA bowling league disbanded at the end of the 2018–19 season. Although five schools that had participated in the final season of MIAA bowling became part of the new bowling league of the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC), those schools were not in the same bowling league for a sufficient time to allow the GLVC to inherit the MIAA&#x27;s automatic bid.

The 2020 tournament was intended to be the first to feature regional play. The field was to be split into four regions, each with four teams competing at predetermined sites; each of the top four seeds as chosen by the NCAA selection committee would be placed in a separate regional. Each regional was to be played as a double-elimination tournament, with the format identical to that introduced for the championship event in 2019. All regional matches, except for what the NCAA calls &quot;if necessary regional finals&quot;, are best-of-three matches bowled in the following order: five-person team, Baker total pinfall, Baker best-of-seven match play. Any &quot;if necessary regional final&quot; will be Baker best-of-seven. Regional winners will advance to the championship event, which will also be double-elimination. All matches will be bowled under the standard format for regionals (best-of-three matches using specified formats in a specific order) except the championship final, which will be Baker best-of-seven.

On March 12, 2020, the NCAA announced that the 2020 tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 2021 tournament featured six automatic berths (CIAA had its championship cancelled due to COVID-19) and ten at-large selections. This was the first tournament to feature regional play. Both regional and championship rounds were all played at one site. The 2022 tournament saw the number of automatic bids increase by two, to eight, with the GLVC champion receiving an automatic bid for its champion and the CIAA champion returning after a one-year absence. There were eight at-large selections. For the first time, regional competition took place at four predetermined regional sites - Erie, PA, Rochester, NY, Lansing, MI, and Arlington, TX, with the regional winners advancing to the championship round. The 2023 tournament saw the College Conference of Illinois &amp; Wisconsin gain an automatic bid, bringing the total number of automatic bids to nine. Eight at-large selections and four predetermined regional sites carried over from the 2022 tournament. The 2024 tournament saw the bowling alliance between Conference Carolinas and the Great Midwest Athletic Conference gain an automatic bid, bringing the total number of automatic bids to ten. Eight at-large selections and four predetermined regional sites carried over from the 2023 tournament.

The other six SBL members became CUSA associates. These schools were joined by Jacksonville State, which also became a full member in July 2023 and added bowling at that time. CUSA inherited the SBL&#x27;s automatic bid. In 2024–25, CUSA added affiliate Wichita State, which elevated its club team to full varsity status at that time.

<doc id="1326617" wikidata="Q3933343" url="?curid=1326617" title="Rescue Rover">
<text>Rescue Rover is a puzzle video game that was developed by id Software and published by Softdisk in 1991. The game was distributed as shareware, with the first 10 levels making up the shareware version, and another 20 levels being present in the registered version. This is one of several games written by id to fulfil their contractual obligation to produce games for Softdisk, where the id founders had been employed. A sequel, Rescue Rover 2, followed.

==Plot==
Roger and Rover are the two main characters. Rover the dog is frequently kidnapped by robots. The player, Roger the owner, must enter robot territory and get him back, hence the name &quot;Rescue Rover&quot;.

==Gameplay==
Each level starts with Roger climbing up a ladder set into the floor, and the player completes the level by arriving back at this ladder with Rover - at which point Roger climbs down with Rover. Gameplay involves getting Rover out repeatedly in a set of increasingly difficult levels, by moving objects around in a grid to open up a path to get to the dog and then bring it back out. There are four different types of robot in the game, each with different behaviour. One type shoots Roger if he stands in front of it, but doesn&#x27;t move, another type runs around and shoots Roger if he is seen, another type chases Roger around, and the last type runs around and kills Roger if it runs into him. To get to Rover, the player must normally avoid, trap or destroy them. There are various items which Roger can push around in the world: crates (which float on water), mirror blocks (which reflect lasers at an angle), star pearls and anti-gravity carts. Other items in the areas are grated floors (which robots cannot travel on), glowing floors (which Roger cannot travel on), water (including moving water in which crates float with the current), laser projectors, teleporters and force doors (which need an access card in order to be opened).

==Development==
&quot;Rescue Rover&quot; had its programming origins in an aborted &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; port that id proposed to Nintendo six months earlier in 1990. Though Nintendo declined, the advances that it made in that demo aided development of their later projects, including &quot;Commander Keen&quot; and &quot;Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Rescue Rover&quot; was released in 1991. In 1997, it was included in an anthology of all id&#x27;s games to date.

==Reception==
David Kushner, in &quot;Masters of Doom&quot;, called it &quot;a clever maze game&quot; and cited it as an example of an emerging trend in id&#x27;s games: darkly humorous violence. Travis Fahs of IGN wrote that despite the title was less impressive compared to other id&#x27;s games, &quot;Rover&quot; had a cult following with the gamers, a factor which led to creation of a sequel. In a 2008 IGN reader poll about their favorite early id game, &quot;Rescue Rover&quot; received one vote.

<doc id="1326622" wikidata="Q1435000" url="?curid=1326622" title="Jamie Clapham">
<text>James Richard Clapham (born 7 December 1975) is an English former professional footballer and current head coach of Loughborough Students. 

He played as a left-back from 1994 to 2011, notably in the Premier League for Tottenham Hotspur, Ipswich Town and Birmingham City. He has also played for Leyton Orient, Bristol Rovers, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Leicester City, Leeds United, Notts County, Lincoln City and Kettering Town. He began his coaching career with Middlesbrough.

==Playing career==

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Clapham was born in Lincoln, Lincolnshire. His career started at Tottenham Hotspur with Clapham playing for the Spurs&#x27; first XI in the 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Subsequently, he made one first-team league appearance for Spurs, a 2–1 defeat to Coventry City on 11 May 1997. Clapham had loan spells at Leyton Orient (six games between 29 January and 22 February 1997) and Bristol Rovers (five games between 27 March and 26 April the same year).

===Ipswich Town===
The next season saw him loaned to Ipswich Town for two months between 9 January and 12 March 1998, the move then becoming permanent for a fee of £300,000. He made a total of 175 full and 20 substitute appearances in the league for Ipswich and scored eight goals, the most notable coming from his left-footed free kicks. In 1999, he was voted Ipswich Town&#x27;s Player of the Year. He also tasted European action with the club, playing 12 games in the UEFA Cup in two successive campaigns, 2001–02 and 2002–03.

Ipswich Town&#x27;s relegation in 2002 led to the club going into administration and created a need to sell players. Clapham was one such player as he was sold.

===Birmingham City===
He joined Premier League club Birmingham City for £1.3 million in 2003 after four years at Portman Road. He settled into the team and was a virtual ever-present until a hamstring injury forced him out in December 2003. His recovery was hampered when he suffered shingles during February 2004, and he was unable to return until April.

In the following two seasons, he remained a squad player with competition for his slot from a number of players, such as Stan Lazaridis and Julian Gray, limiting his appearances. In May 2006, he was released by the club as they slipped from the top flight. In all, he played 84 league games over three seasons and scored once, against Manchester United in December 2005.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
In July 2006, Clapham had a trial with Sheffield United and played 75 minutes of a pre-season clash with Rotherham United. He also received interest from Ipswich Town before choosing to sign for Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers in August 2006 on a two-year deal. He played in just 26 league games during the 2006–07 season, without scoring, and was put on the transfer list at the end of it. However, there were no takers for the defender in the close season and he began the 2007–08 campaign still at Molineux.

====Leeds United (loan)====
He was loaned out to League One Leeds United in August 2007 and remained at Elland Road for three months, becoming Leeds first choice left back, the club was given a 15-point deduction at the start of that season and Clapham was instrumental at playing a part in Leeds&#x27; impressive early season form.

===Leicester City===
He failed to break back into Wolves&#x27; first team after his return and was released to join Leicester City on 31 January 2008. Clapham was released in May 2008.

===Notts County===
After a period in July training with West Bromwich Albion, managed by former Ipswich teammate Tony Mowbray, he joined Southend United on trial but was not offered a contract. After two weeks&#x27; training with Notts County, he signed a short-term deal with the League Two club in September 2008, then in January 2009, he signed an 18-month contract extension to keep him at the club until May 2010. He and seven other players were released at the end of the 2009–10 season.

===Lincoln City===
He signed a one-year contract with League Two club Lincoln City in July 2010. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 win over Macclesfield Town on 9 October, and scored again in an FA Cup defeat to Hereford United. He was not offered a new contract after a mass clearout of players after Lincoln&#x27;s relegation from the Football League.

===Kettering Town===
In August 2011 he signed for Kettering Town after a trial. A month later, after manager Morell Maison was replaced by Mark Stimson, Clapham left the club.

==Coaching career==
Tony Mowbray appointed Clapham to a coaching role in Championship club Middlesbrough&#x27;s academy after Steve Agnew left for Hull City in 2012. Clapham managed the club&#x27;s under-21 team, and assisted new manager Aitor Karanka with the first team from November 2013 to March 2014. In June 2015, he rejoined Mowbray on the coaching staff at Coventry City.

In September 2016, Barnsley manager Paul Heckingbottom brought Clapham into the club as first-team coach on a short-term deal. A few weeks later, his tenure was extended to the end of the season, and extended again in July 2017.

Heckingbottom was appointed head coach of Leeds United on 6 February 2018, and took Clapham with him as his assistant. When Heckingbottom was dismissed at the end of the season, Clapham also left the club.

On 17 May 2021, Clapham was announced as the new head coach of Loughborough Students. Taking the Scholars to the semi-final of the FA Vase in the 21-22 season.

==Personal life==
Clapham&#x27;s father, Graham Clapham, and grandfather, Bert Wilkinson, were also professional footballers.

<text>A self-parody is a parody of oneself or one&#x27;s own work. As an artist accomplishes it by imitating their own characteristics, a self-parody is potentially difficult to distinguish from especially characteristic productions. Self-parody may be used to parody someone else&#x27;s characteristics, or lacking, by overemphasizing and/or exaggerate one&#x27;s own. Overemphasis can be made for the prevailing attitude in their life&#x27;s work, social group, lifestyle and subculture. Including lines and points made by others or by the recipient of the self-parody directing it to a parody of someone else which that other person is likely to remember and can&#x27;t de-emphasize without frustration.

Sometimes critics use the word figuratively to indicate that the artist&#x27;s style and preoccupations appear as strongly (and perhaps as ineptly) in some work as they would in a parody. Such works may result from habit, self-indulgence, or an effort to please an audience by providing something familiar. An example from Paul Johnson writing about Ernest Hemingway:
:Some [of Hemingway&#x27;s later writing] was published nonetheless, and was seen to be inferior, even a parody of his earlier work. There were one or two exceptions, notably &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, though there was an element of self-parody in that too.

==Examples of self-parody==
The following are deliberate self-parodies or are at least sometimes considered to be so.

===Literature===
* In &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, the fictional storyteller Sheherezade sometimes tells folk tales with similar themes and story lines that can be seen as parodies of each other. For example, &quot;Wardan the Butcher&#x27;s Adventure With the Lady and the Bear&quot; parallels &quot;The King&#x27;s Daughter and the Ape&quot;, &quot;Harun al-Rashid and the Two Slave-Girls&quot; has a similar relationship to &quot;Harun al-Rashid and the Three Slave-Girls&quot; - and &quot;The Angel of Death With the Proud King and the Devout Man&quot; has two possible parodies: &quot;The Angel of Death and the Rich King&quot; and &quot;The Angel of Death and the King of the Children of Israel&quot;. This observation needs to be tempered by our knowledge of the nature of folk tales, and the way this collection &quot;grew&quot; rather than being deliberately compiled.
* Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Tale of Sir Topas&quot; in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; shows &quot;Geoffrey Chaucer&quot; as a timid writer of doggerel. It has been argued that the tale parodies, among other romances, Chaucer&#x27;s own &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;.
* &quot;Nephelidia&quot;, a poem by A. C. Swinburne.
* &quot;Municipal&quot;, a poem by Rudyard Kipling.
* &quot;L&#x27;Art&quot; and &quot;To Hulme (T. E.) and Fitzgerald (A Certain)&quot;, poems by Ezra Pound.
* &quot;Afternoon of a Cow&quot;, a short story by William Faulkner.
* Edgar Allan Poe often discussed his own work, sometimes in the form of parody, as in &quot;How to Write a Blackwood Article&quot; and the short story that follows it, &quot;A Predicament&quot;.
* &quot;Pale Fire&quot; is a novel by Vladimir Nabokov in the form of a long, pedantic, self-centered commentary on a much shorter poem. It may parody his commentary on his translation of Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, in which the commentary was highly detailed and much longer than the poem. Both the poet and the commentator have been called self-parodies.
* The short story &quot;First Law&quot; by Isaac Asimov is described by Asimov himself as a &#x27;spoof&#x27; in &quot;The Complete Robot&quot;.

===Film and television===

* &quot;Gekisou Sentai Carranger&quot; is the twentieth production of Toei&#x27;s long-running Super Sentai metaseries and media franchise, and was written as parody of its own franchise. 
* &quot;Enchanted&quot; is a Disney movie which is both a homage to, and self-parody of, previous animated Disney films featuring princesses.
* Arnold Schwarzenegger as Jack Slater in the film &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;. Slater uses many of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s action star characterizations including saying one-liners. Schwarzenegger even cameos as himself at the on-screen Slater film premiere.
* Bruce Campbell portrays himself as a B-movie actor who is called to fight a spirit who turns out to be real in &quot;My Name is Bruce&quot;.
* Chris Kattan portrays himself as an actor who reinvents his career in &quot;Bollywood Hero&quot;.
* James Van Der Beek portrays himself as the title character&#x27;s friend in the sitcom &quot;Don&#x27;t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23&quot;.
* Larry David plays a fictionalised and exaggerated version of himself in the television series &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;.
* Kevin Hart portrays himself as an aspiring action star in the series &quot;Die Hart&quot;.
* Maria Bamford portrays herself in the Netflix sitcom &quot;Lady Dynamite&quot;.
* Matt LeBlanc plays a satirical version of himself in &quot;Episodes&quot;.
* Mike Tyson voices and spoofs himself as a former boxer who becomes a detective in the adult cartoon &quot;Mike Tyson Mysteries&quot;.
* Neil Patrick Harris in the &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar&quot; series, where he plays &quot;an extreme version of himself who enjoys drugs, female hookers and alcohol etc.&quot;
* Nicolas Cage portrays himself in the film &quot;The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent&quot;
* Richard Dawson as Damon Killian in the film &quot;The Running Man&quot;. Dawson parodies his &quot;Family Feud&quot; persona as the film&#x27;s game show host.
* Rob Schneider portrays himself in the self-produced sitcom &quot;Real Rob&quot;, which also stars his real-life wife and child.
* Samuel L. Jackson as Agent Neville Flynn in &quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot;.
* The 1990 film &quot;The Freshman&quot; features Marlon Brando playing a parody of his famous character from &quot;The Godfather&quot;.
* The later James Bond films, specifically those with Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan in the title role, have been called self-parodies.
* The &quot;Scary Movie&quot; film franchise parodies the popular horror film genre. &quot;Scary Movie V&quot; parodies the Scary Movie franchise itself.
* The 2023 film &quot;Barbie&quot;, directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie, is an extended self-parody of the Barbie toy franchise.
* The penultimate episode of &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Ember Island Players&quot; involves the main characters watching a play of their own journey. The play itself is a self-parody of the entire story of &quot;Avatar: The Last Airbender&quot; up to that point.

===Video games===
* In Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; games, the character Professor E. Gadd presents Luigi with a communication device designed as a parody of a Nintendo portable console, as such the &quot;Game Boy Horror&quot; in the original title, the &quot;Duel Scream&quot; in &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion: Dark Moon&quot;, and the &quot;Virtual Boo&quot; in &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 3&quot;.
* Konami&#x27;s &quot;Parodius&quot; games parody their own &quot;Gradius&quot; games, as well as several other games they have created. Similar games from other companies that parody their own games include Hudson Soft&#x27;s &quot;Star Parodier&quot; and Taito&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders &#x27;95&quot;.

<text>Tilghman Ashurst Howard (November 14, 1797 – August 16, 1844) was an American lawyer, politician, and diplomat from Indiana. He was born near Easley, South Carolina. He moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1816 and was admitted to the bar there in 1818. In 1830, he moved to Bloomington, Indiana, and in 1833 to Rockville, Indiana. President Andrew Jackson appointed him US Attorney for Indiana, and he served as such from 1833 to 1839. In 1838, he sought, unsuccessfully, to be elected to the U.S. Senate. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives on August 5, 1839, and served until he resigned on July 1, 1840.

In 1841, Howard unsuccessfully defended the blacksmith Noah Beauchamp against a murder charge. Beauchamp was convicted and executed in Parke County, Indiana.

He sought election as Governor of Indiana in 1840 and as United States Senator in 1843 but was unsuccessful. He was appointed &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; to the Republic of Texas on June 11, 1844, and presented his credentials on August 2, 1844; he served all of two weeks before his untimely death in Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas, at the age of 46. Howard is buried in Rockville, Indiana.

Howard County, Indiana, and Howard County, Iowa, are named in his honor.

<text>Private Music was an American independent record label founded in 1984 by musician Peter Baumann as a &quot;home for instrumental music&quot;. Baumann signed Ravi Shankar, Yanni, Suzanne Ciani, Andy Summers, Patrick O&#x27;Hearn, Leo Kottke, and his former bandmates, Tangerine Dream. The label specialized in New age music but made a sharp turn to the mainstream by signing Taj Mahal, Ringo Starr, Etta James, and A. J. Croce. Its albums were distributed by BMG (the label&#x27;s earliest recordings having been distributed by RCA), which bought Private Music in 1996.

==History==

In 1989, Baumann hired veteran music executive Ron Goldstein of Warner Bros. Records as Private Music&#x27;s president and CEO. Goldstein moved the offices from New York City to Los Angeles, hiring Karen Johnson to expand the label&#x27;s image. Baumann recruited the well-respected, mainstream A&amp;R executive Jamie Cohen. Visual image was important to Goldstein, who handpicked art director Melanie Penny, previously of Virgin Records and Warner Bros., as VP, Creative Services, through the life of Private Music.

Private Music emphasized its &quot;artist re-development&quot; efforts, supporting such eclectic veteran artists as Taj Mahal, Ringo Starr, Etta James, Jennifer Warnes, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Toots Thielemans, Jimmy Witherspoon, Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, Eliza Gilkyson, Joy Askew, The Pahinui Brothers, and Kenny Rankin, while expanding the catalogs of Yanni, Leo Kottke, Andy Summers, and Ravi Shankar, with strong &quot;debut support&quot; for A. J. Croce and Susan Werner. An international marketing department was added, led by longtime Sony Music executive J.P. Bommel.

Private Music&#x27;s recordings earned multiple Grammy Awards and nominations, including Etta James&#x27;s first career win, in 1994, for best jazz vocal performance on &quot;Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday&quot;, her debut of three albums on the label. Private&#x27;s roster achieved high recognition on national television. Numerous artist appearances included interviews and performances on late-night talk shows and morning shows, MTV, and VH1.

Private&#x27;s Grammy winner Taj Mahal spawned the Grammy-winning Phantom Blues Band. With its increasing influence in blues and roots music, and at the peak of its performance in record sales, Private Music entered into a joint venture with House of Blues&#x27; record label, featuring such artists as Cissy Houston and John Mooney.

In 2001, Private Music became part of the short-lived Arista Associated Labels, which also included Windham Hill Records. By 2004, after Sony and BMG merged, the label&#x27;s releases switched to RCA. Following his Private Music tenure, Goldstein served as president and CEO of the Verve Music Group label at Universal Music Group, in New York City.

==Notable albums==
Private Music has released a number of notable albums:

<doc id="1326648" wikidata="Q516973" url="?curid=1326648" title="Cognitive archaeology">
<text>Cognitive archaeology is a theoretical perspective in archaeology that focuses on the ancient mind. It is divided into two main groups: evolutionary cognitive archaeology (ECA), which seeks to understand human cognitive evolution from the material record, and ideational cognitive archaeology (ICA), which focuses on the symbolic structures discernable in or inferable from past material culture.

==Evolutionary cognitive archaeology==

ECA infers change in ancestral human cognition from the archaeological record, often drawing on the theories, methods, and data of other disciplines: cognitive science, comparative cognition, paleoneurology, experimental replication, and hands-on participation in the manufacture and use of traditional technologies. For example, the 3.3-million-year history of stone tool use is broadly informative of change in cognitive capacities like intelligence, spatial reasoning, working memory, and executive functioning, as defined by and understood through cognitive psychology and as operationalized to permit their detection in the archaeological record. Other ECA investigations have focused on the development of domain-specific abilities, including theory of mind, visual perception and visuospatial abilities, technological reasoning, language, numeracy, and literacy. ECA is broadly analogous to Steven Mithen&#x27;s categories of cognitive-processual and evolutionary-cognitive archaeology.

Within ECA, there are two main schools of thought. The North American ECA school began in the mid-1970s with the pioneering work of archaeologist Thomas G. Wynn and biological anthropologist Sue Taylor Parker working with evolutionary neurobiologist Kathleen Gibson. It focuses on understanding human cognitive evolution, either from the artifactual record of forms like stone tools, comparisons of ancestral tool use with that of contemporary species (typically but not exclusively, non-human primates), or both. It often involves descriptive pattern analysis: analyzing change in a form like stone tools over millions of years and interpreting that change in terms of its cognitive significance using theories, constructs, and paradigms from cognitive psychology and neuroscience.

East of the Atlantic, the British ECA school also began in the mid-1970s with the work of archaeologists Colin Renfrew and John Gowlett and evolutionary primatologist William McGrew. Renfrew&#x27;s work in particular, as well as that of his student, Lambros Malafouris, has taken a philosophical approach to the study of the ancient mind, drawing on concepts from the philosophy of mind and ecological psychology to examine the role of material structures in human cognition more fundamentally. Renfrew and Malafouris coined the term neuroarchaeology to describe their approach. ECA is concerned with how humans think through material structures, with the ability to leverage and exploit material structures for cognitive purposes perhaps being what truly sets human cognition apart from that of all other species. Pottery making is a typical example of this approach. Malafouris does not see the vase as a form created by the potter imposing an internal mental concept on external clay. Instead, the potter’s brain and body interact with his materials, the clay and the wheel; the form assumed by the clay is ultimately produced by the complex interaction between the potter’s perception of the feel of the clay, the pressure of his fingers on it, and its reactions of texture, moisture content, color, balance, and form.

Other early ECA pioneers include Glynn Isaac, archaeologist Iain Davidson, and psychologist William Noble. Today, ECA integrates interdisciplinary data from human psychology and neurophysiology, social anthropology, physical anthropology, comparative cognition, and artificial intelligence. As a vibrant and expanding field of inquiry,

&quot;[ECA continues to] develop many of the same themes raised in the formative decade of cognitive archaeology: the validity and use of ethnoarchaeological and experimental methods; the question of continuities and discontinuities between humans and non-human species; the selection and application of theoretical frameworks, including the displacement of Piagetian theory by contemporary psychological and neuroscientific approaches to brain function and form; the incorporation of interdisciplinary data; the origin of language; the ability of construing intentionality from artifactual form; the philosophical turn in cognitive archaeology; and the riddle of intergenerational accumulation and transmission.&quot;

Between 2018 and 2020, cognitive archaeologists Thomas Wynn and Lambros Malafouris headed a collaboration between the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs and the University of Oxford to examine the archaeology of the Lower Paleolithic through the lens of the extended mind; the results were published in the journal &quot;Adaptive Behavior&quot; in 2021.

==Ideational cognitive archaeology==
Archaeologist Thomas Huffman defined ideational cognitive archaeology as the study of prehistoric ideology: the ideals, values, and beliefs that constitute a society&#x27;s worldview. It is analogous to the category Mithen called postprocessual cognitive archaeology.
ICA scholars often study the role that ideology and differing organizational approaches would have had on ancient peoples. The way that these abstract ideas are manifested through the remains these peoples have left can be investigated and debated often by drawing inferences and using approaches developed in fields such as semiotics, psychology and the wider sciences.

ICA uses the principles of sociocultural anthropology to investigate such diverse things as material symbols, the use of space, political power, and religion. For example, Huffman uses oral history sources from Zimbabwe and Portuguese documents to attempt to explain symbols discovered in the ruins of Great Zimbabwe, specifically connecting the Shona people&#x27;s historical association of the right with men and the left with women to the placement of entrances to stone structures. Historian David Beach has pointed out that this ICA may be problematic in its logical leaps and incomplete use of archaeological sources, demonstrating the care that must be used when attempting to explain deep-time intentionality using archaeological evidence.

ICA also works with constructs such as the cognitive map. Humans do not behave under the influence of their senses alone but also through their past experiences such as their upbringing. These experiences contribute to each individual&#x27;s unique view of the world, a kind of cognitive map that guides them. Groups of people living together tend to develop a shared view of the world and similar cognitive maps, which in turn influence their group material culture.

The multiple interpretations of an artifact, archaeological site or symbol are affected by the archaeologist&#x27;s own experiences and ideas as well as those of the distant cultural tradition that created it. Cave art, for example, may not have been art in the modern sense at all, but was perhaps the product of ritual. Similarly, it would likely have described activities that were perfectly obvious to the people who created it, but the symbology employed will be different from that used today or at any other time.

Archaeologists have always tried to imagine what motivated people, but early efforts to understand how they thought were unstructured and speculative. Since the rise of processualism, these approaches have become more scientific, paying close attention to the archaeological context of finds and all possible interpretations. For example, a prehistoric bâton de commandement served an unknown purpose, but using ICA to interpret it would involve evaluating all its possible functions using clearly defined procedures and comparisons. By applying logic and experimental evidence, the most likely functions can be isolated.

It can also be argued that the material record shows behavioral traces that are the product of human thought, and thus would have been governed by a multitude of experiences and perspectives with the potential to influence behavior. The combination of material culture and actions can be further developed into a study of the ideas that drove action and used objects. This method attempts to avoid the pitfalls of post-processual archaeology by retaining the &#x27;scientific&#x27; aspects of processual archaeology, while reaching for the higher social levels of ideas.

==History of cognitive archaeology==
Cognitive archaeology began in the 1970s as a reaction to the insistence of processual archaeology that the past be interpreted strictly according to the material evidence. This rigid materialism tended to limit archaeology to finding and describing artifacts, excluding broader interpretations of their possible cognitive and cultural significance as something beyond the reach of inferential reasoning. As social anthropologist Edmund Leach once put it, &quot;all the ingenuity in the world will not replace the evidence that is lost and gone for ever,&quot; and &quot;you should recognize your guesses for what they are.&quot;

However, processual archaeology also opened up the possibility of investigating the lifestyle of those who made and used material culture. An initial approach was proposed by Lewis Binford, who suggested that ancient lifestyles could be understood by studying the traditional lifestyles of contemporary peoples. While this approach was subject to legitimate criticism, Binford&#x27;s efforts nonetheless inspired further development of the idea that material forms could be informative about lifestyle, and as the product of intelligent behavior, might provide insight into how and perhaps even what their makers had thought. Archaeologists like Binford have also critiqued cognitive archaeology, stating it is only people&#x27;s actions rather than their thoughts that are preserved in the archaeological record. ECA has responded to this criticism by stressing that it seeks to understand &quot;how&quot; ancient peoples thought using material structures, not &quot;what&quot; they thought.

Several early books helped popularize the idea that the ancient mind could be investigated and characterized, including Merlin Donald&#x27;s &quot;Origins of the Modern Mind&quot; (1991), Steven Mithen&#x27;s &quot;The Prehistory of Mind&quot; (1996), and David Lewis-Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Mind in the Cave&quot; (2002).
