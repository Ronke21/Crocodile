<text>Carlos Ghosn (; ; ; , born 9 March 1954) is a Lebanese-French-Brazilian businessman and former automotive executive. He was the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Michelin North America, chairman and CEO of Renault, chairman of AvtoVAZ, chairman and CEO of Nissan, and chairman of Mitsubishi Motors.

In 2018, he was arrested in Japan on suspicion of financial misconduct at Nissan, having been accused of understating his annual salary and misusing company funds. In 2019, while under house arrest awaiting trial, he escaped from Japan by concealing himself inside a large box which was shipped as freight on a private jet.

==Early life and education==
Ghosn&#x27;s grandfather was Bichara Ghosn, a Maronite Catholic who emigrated from Ajaltoun, French Mandate Lebanon to Brazil at the age of 13, eventually settling in remote Guaporé, Rondônia, near the border between Brazil and Bolivia. Bichara Ghosn was an entrepreneur and eventually headed several companies, in businesses including the rubber trade, the sale and purchase of agricultural products, and aviation. His son Jorge Ghosn married Rose Jazzar, a Nigerian-born Lebanese woman whose family came from Miziara in Lebanon then went to Brazil, where they settled in Porto Velho, the state capital of Rondônia, and had four children.

Carlos&#x27; father, Jorge Ghosn (died 2006) was a diamond trader and worked in the airline industry. Jorge was convicted of murdering a priest in Sawfar, Lebanon in 1960. Jorge fled to Brazil in 1975 at the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War.

Carlos Ghosn was born on 9 March 1954, in Porto Velho. When he was about two years old he became sick after drinking unsanitary water, and his mother moved with him to Rio de Janeiro. He did not fully recover there, and in 1960, when Ghosn was six years old, he and his mother and sister moved to Beirut, Lebanon, where his grandmother and two other sisters lived.

Ghosn completed his secondary school studies in Lebanon, at the Jesuit school Collège Notre-Dame de Jamhour. He then completed his classes préparatoires in Paris, at the Collège Stanislas and the Lycée Saint-Louis. He graduated as an engineer from the École Polytechnique in 1974 and the École des Mines de Paris in 1978.

==Career==

===Michelin===
After graduation in 1978, Ghosn spent 18 years at Michelin, Europe&#x27;s largest tire maker, initially training and working in several plants in France and Germany. In 1981, he became plant manager in Le Puy-en-Velay, France. In 1984 he was named head of research and development for the company&#x27;s industrial tyre division.

In 1985, when Ghosn was 30 years old, he was appointed chief operating officer (COO) of Michelin&#x27;s South American operations. He returned to Rio de Janeiro, reporting directly to François Michelin, who tasked Ghosn with turning around the operation, which was unprofitable and struggling under Brazil&#x27;s hyperinflation. Ghosn formed cross-functional management teams to determine best practices among the French, Brazilian, and other nationalities working in the South American division. The multicultural experience in Brazil formed the basis of his cross-cultural management style and emphasis on diversity as a core business asset. &quot;You learn from diversity ... but you&#x27;re comforted by commonality&quot;, Ghosn has said. The division returned to profitability in two years.

After turning around Michelin&#x27;s South American operations, Ghosn was appointed president and COO of Michelin North America in 1989, and moved to Greenville, South Carolina, with his family. He was promoted to CEO of Michelin North America in 1990. He presided over the restructuring of the company after its acquisition of the Uniroyal Goodrich Tyre Company.

===Post-privatisation Renault===
In 1996, Ghosn became executive vice president in charge of purchasing, advanced research, engineering and development, powertrain operations, and manufacturing at Renault; and he was also in charge of Renault&#x27;s South American division, located in the Mercosur. Ghosn&#x27;s radical restructuring of Renault successfully contributed to profitability of the company over 1997. His reputation of successful performance under François Michelin was repeated under the first CEO of the freshly privatized Renault.

===Nissan and the Renault–Nissan Alliance===
In March 1999, Renault and Nissan formed the Renault–Nissan Alliance, and in May 1999 Renault purchased a 36.8% stake in Nissan. While maintaining his roles at Renault, Ghosn joined Nissan as its chief operating officer (COO) in June 1999, became its president in June 2000, and was named chief executive officer (CEO) in June 2001. When he joined the company, Nissan had a consolidated interest-bearing net automotive debt of more than $20 billion (more than 2 trillion yen), and only three of its 46 models sold in Japan were generating a profit. Reversing the company&#x27;s sinking fortunes was considered nearly impossible.

Ghosn&#x27;s &quot;Nissan Revival Plan&quot;, announced in October 1999, called for a return to profitability in fiscal year 2000, a profit margin in excess of 4.5% of sales by the end of fiscal year 2002, and a 50% reduction in the current level of debt by the end of fiscal year 2002. Ghosn promised to resign if these goals were not met. Ghosn&#x27;s Nissan Revival Plan called for cutting 21,000 Nissan jobs (14% of total workforce), mostly in Japan; shutting five Japanese plants; reducing the number of suppliers and shareholdings; and auctioning off prized assets such as Nissan&#x27;s aerospace unit.

Ghosn was the fourth non-Japanese person to lead a Japanese automaker, after Mark Fields, Henry Wallace and James Miller were appointed by Ford to run Mazda in the late 1990s. In addition to cutting jobs, plants, and suppliers, Ghosn spearheaded major and dramatic structural and corporate-culture changes at Nissan. He defied Japanese business etiquette in various ways, including by eliminating seniority-based and age-based promotion, by changing lifetime employment from a guarantee to a desired goal for when the company achieved high performance, and by dismantling Nissan&#x27;s &quot;keiretsu&quot; system; an interwoven web of parts suppliers with cross-holdings in Nissan. When the Nissan Revival Plan was announced, the proposed dismantling of &quot;keiretsu&quot; earned Ghosn the nickname &quot;&quot;keiretsu&quot; killer&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; quoted a Dresdner Kleinwort Benson analyst in Tokyo as saying Ghosn might become a &quot;target of public outrage&quot; if Nissan threw former affiliates out of its supply chain. Ghosn changed Nissan&#x27;s official company language from Japanese to English, and included executives from Europe and North America in key global strategy sessions for the first time.

In the first year of the Nissan Revival Plan, Nissan&#x27;s consolidated net profit after tax climbed to $2.7 billion for fiscal year 2000, from a consolidated net loss of $6.46 billion in the previous year. Twelve months into his three-year turnaround plan, Nissan had returned to profitability, and within three years it was one of the industry&#x27;s most profitable auto makers, with operating margins consistently above 9%; more than twice the industry average. The goals of the Nissan Revival Plan were all reached before 31 March 2002.

In May 2002, Ghosn announced his next set of goals for the company, &quot;Nissan 180&quot;, a three-year plan for growth based on the numbers 1, 8, and 0: By the end of September 2005, Nissan planned to increase its global sales by one million vehicles; and by the spring of 2005, it was committed to achieving an operating margin of at least 8% and reducing its net automotive debt to zero. These goals were all reached: In the spring of 2003, Nissan announced that its net automotive debt was eliminated in fiscal year 2002. Nissan&#x27;s operating profit margin climbed to 11.1% in fiscal year 2003; it had been 1.4% in fiscal year 1999. In October 2005, Nissan announced that its annual sales from 30 September 2004, to 30 September 2005, were more than 3.67 million, up from the 2.6 million vehicles sold in the fiscal year ended March 2002.

In May 2005, Ghosn was named president and chief executive officer of Renault. When he assumed the CEO roles at both Renault and Nissan, Ghosn became the world&#x27;s first person to simultaneously run two companies on the Fortune Global 500.

In 2005, billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian acquired a 9.9% stake in General Motors (GM), seated one of his representatives on the company&#x27;s board, and then urged GM to initiate a merger with Renault and Nissan, with Ghosn serving as the new chairman of GM. In 2006, GM&#x27;s embattled management rebuffed the takeover attempt, and by the end of the year, Kerkorian&#x27;s Tracinda Corp. sold most of its GM stock.

In 2006, Ford Motor Co. made Ghosn a formal offer to lead the company. Ghosn refused, reportedly saying the only way he would come to the struggling company was if he was named both the CEO and chairman of the board. Bill Ford Jr. refused to give up his chairmanship.

In 2007, Ghosn led the Renault–Nissan Alliance into the mass-market zero-emission electric car market in a major way, and committed €4 billion (more than $5 billion) to the effort. In 2008, he confirmed that Nissan–Renault would bring an &quot;entire lineup&quot; of zero-emission electric cars to the worldwide market by 2012. In 2009, he told the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Wharton School of Business, &quot;If you&#x27;re going to let developing countries have as many cars as they want—and they&#x27;re going to have as many cars as they want one way or another—there is absolutely no alternative but to go for zero emissions. And the only zero-emissions vehicle available today is electric ... So we decided to go for it.&quot; The Nissan Leaf, an electric car billed as &quot;the world&#x27;s first affordable zero-emission car&quot;, debuted in December 2010. By 2017, the Renault–Nissan Alliance was the world leader in electric vehicles, selling more than twice as many electric cars as Tesla, and the Nissan Leaf was the world&#x27;s best-selling electric vehicle by a wide margin.

Ghosn was a visible leader in recovery efforts after the Japanese earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011, one of the worst natural disasters in modern history. On 29 March 2011, he made the first of several visits to the hard-hit Iwaki engine plant in Fukushima prefecture, 50 km (31 miles) from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, and at his direction Nissan restored full operations at the Iwaki factory well ahead of expectations. He appeared on television in Japan to encourage optimism. In May 2011, Ghosn remained committed to building at least 1 million of Nissan&#x27;s cars and trucks in Japan annually. In 2011 Ghosn was under scrutiny by the French government for mishandling a spying scandal related to Renault.

In June 2012, Ghosn was named deputy chairman of the board of directors of Russian automobile manufacturer AvtoVAZ. In June 2013, he was appointed chairman of the Russian company, a position he retained through June 2016. Renault had begun a strategic partnership with AvtoVAZ in 2008 by acquiring a 25% stake in the company; this led to increasingly deeper partnerships between Renault–Nissan and AvtoVAZ, ending in Renault–Nissan Alliance control of the Russian automaker in 2014.

In February 2017, Ghosn announced he would step down as CEO of Nissan on 1 April 2017, while remaining chairman of the company. Hiroto Saikawa, succeeded Ghosn at Nissan. In November 2018, Renault owned 43.4% of Nissan, while Nissan owned non-voting shares equal to 15% of Renault&#x27;s equity.

===Mitsubishi===

In October 2016, Nissan completed the acquisition of a controlling 34% stake in Mitsubishi Motors. Ghosn became, in addition to his Renault–Nissan posts, chairman of Mitsubishi, with an aim to rehabilitate the automaker after a months-long scandal involving fuel-economy misrepresentation and consequent falling revenues. The Nissan–Mitsubishi partnership includes partnership in developing electric automobiles for Mitsubishi, and the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance creates the world&#x27;s fourth-largest auto group, after Toyota, Volkswagen AG, and General Motors Co.

Mitsubishi Motors board removed Ghosn from his role as chairman on 26 November 2018, following his arrest and ousting from Nissan for alleged financial misconduct.

===Advisorships===
Ghosn served on the International Advisory Board of Brazilian bank Banco Itaú (a major party in the privatisation of Renault) until 2015. He is also a member of the advisory board of Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management in Beijing. He has received an honorary doctorate from American University of Beirut; and he is a member of the Strategic Council, Saint Joseph University of Beirut. In 2014 and 2015, he was elected president of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. He serves as governor of the World Economic Forum.

==Legal troubles==
===Initial arrest===
On 19 November 2018, Tokyo district prosecutors arrested Ghosn at 4:30 p.m. upon his re-entry into Japan aboard a private jet that had come from Lebanon, for questioning over allegations of false accounting. Ghosn&#x27;s top aide, Greg Kelly, a Nissan director and former head of human resources, was also arrested upon his arrival from the U.S. that day.

On the same day, Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa announced at a press conference that Ghosn had been dismissed from Nissan&#x27;s board and would be stripped of executive rights at a meeting to be held on 22 November. Saikawa stressed that the dismissal was the result of an internal inquiry by Nissan, and alleged that Ghosn and Kelly had under-reported their compensation (a violation of securities law) and used company assets for personal use. While the allegations remained unproven in court, with due legal process pending, at the same news conference, Saikawa &quot;expressed disappointment, indignation, and despair at Ghosn&#x27;s conduct, which included using company funds for personal investments and misusing corporate assets&quot; and also said, &quot;This is an act that cannot be tolerated by the company... It is sufficient grounds for his dismissal.&quot;

Although the company did not provide details, reports in the Japanese media stated that Nissan was paying all or some of the costs at some amount of US$18 million for residences used by Ghosn in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, and that Ghosn charged family vacation expenses to the company. The purchases of some of these residences and the payment of expenses were handled by a shell company named Zi-A Capital BV based in the Netherlands, which Kelly had instructed Nissan&#x27;s board to set up to make venture investments at the end of 2010 (around the same time as Ghosn&#x27;s divorce from his first wife and beginning of a relationship with his second wife). Nissan funds were used to purchase Ghosn&#x27;s Paris apartment in 2005, and Zi-A funds were used to purchase his $5 million beachfront Rio apartment in 2012 and his Beirut mansion, which, with renovations, cost over $15 million. Nissan compliance auditors began trying to track Zi-A activity in 2014 but were stymied at first by the chain of shell companies used in Zi-A investments.

In addition, to avoid reporting the full amount of his compensation in Nissan financials, as required by Japanese law beginning in 2010, Ghosn had Kelly structure complicated deferred payment plans which went unreported under an aggressive interpretation of the disclosure rules which Nissan&#x27;s outside auditors had not signed off on, and which totaled around $80 million at the time of his arrest eight years later. According to &quot;Nikkei&quot; reports, Ghosn told investigators that he instructed Kelly to handle the compensation reporting in a legal manner, and Kelly told investigators that he acted on advice from outside law firms and the Financial Services Agency in handling the reporting. Leaks to the media said that Ghosn had planned to call a vote to fire Nissan CEO Saikawa and reinstate Kelly (who had semi-retired to the U.S. in 2015) to active service at the scheduled board meeting.

Ghosn was detained at the Tokyo Detention House, under Japanese rules that allow suspects to be detained for up to 23 days without criminal charges being filed. Ghosn and Kelly were reportedly arrested on information provided by an unidentified non-Japanese executive in Nissan&#x27;s legal department, in the second deal ever struck under Japan&#x27;s recently introduced plea bargaining system. Charges were filed against Ghosn and Kelly on the underreporting of deferred compensation on 10 December, along with allegations of additional charges that restarted a 10-day holding period without bail. Nissan also took control of the Rio and Beirut properties and changed the locks, which has led Ghosn&#x27;s family to sue for access.

===Continued detention and new charges===
On 21 December 2018, Ghosn was re-arrested on suspicion of shifting to Nissan personal losses of US$16.6 million related to a personal swap contract in October 2008 (during the global financial crisis). The introduction of those charges prevented Ghosn&#x27;s release on bail later the same day, because the new charges permitted an additional 10–20 days of incarceration prior to a bail hearing. Subsequent reporting linked this charge to Ghosn&#x27;s dealings with Sheikh Khaled al-Juffali, the vice chairman of one of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s largest conglomerates and majority owner of a company which owns half of a regional joint venture called Nissan Gulf, with the other half held by a wholly owned Nissan subsidiary. In return for a personal letter of credit from Juffali to Ghosn during the 2008 crisis, which served as bank-demanded collateral for Ghosn&#x27;s swap contract, Nissan indirectly paid $14.7 million from an internal discretionary fund known as the &quot;CEO Reserve&quot; to a wholly owned Juffali company in four installments between 2009 and 2012, although the internal documentation did not specify the ultimate recipient. According to Tokyo prosecutors, Kelly was not involved in this transaction and so was released on bail on 25 December.

Ghosn made his first public appearance after his arrest at an arraignment on Tuesday, 8 January 2019, where he asserted his innocence, making a statement in response to the main allegations against him; however, his bid to be released from prison on these charges was rejected.

Ghosn&#x27;s imprisonment was set to end on 11 January 2019. That day, Ghosn was indicted on two additional charges: aggravated breach of trust and understating his income, once again extending his imprisonment. As a result, he could remain in jail for months more before a trial would take place. Two days later, Nissan&#x27;s investigation allegedly found that, in addition to the underreporting of salary already charged, Ghosn had paid himself an undisclosed $8 million in 2018 from a Netherlands-based joint venture owned by Nissan and Mitsubishi that was set up in 2017, without the knowledge of either company&#x27;s directors because Ghosn had the sole authority to dispense cash from the venture.

Ghosn again appealed the denial of bail from 8 January 2019 and offered to meet greater restrictions and higher guarantees of appearance in return for his release, including wearing an ankle bracelet and posting his Nissan stock as collateral. Additionally, on 14 January 2019 Ghosn&#x27;s wife Carole published a letter that she wrote to Human Rights Watch protesting against his treatment in detainment. Nevertheless, on 21 January 2019, the Tokyo district court again denied bail.

The Japanese term hitojichi shihō (&quot;hostage justice&quot;) has been brought up in some media reports. Takashi Takano, one of Ghosn&#x27;s lawyers stated that the Japanese judicial system is a country risk.

===Further developments===

On 11 January 2019 José Muñoz, Nissan&#x27;s chief performance officer and head of its China operations, resigned from the company. Muñoz, considered to be a close ally to Ghosn and a possible successor as CEO of Renault and Nissan, had been a &quot;person of interest&quot; in Nissan&#x27;s internal investigation, with which he was reported to be uncooperative. One of Nissan&#x27;s three independent directors opined that Nissan may simply eliminate the position of chairman and not replace Ghosn, a route previously taken by other scandal-plagued Japanese companies. The Reuters Japan news service reported that Nissan may file suit against Ghosn personally.

At first the French government and Renault had been reported to be standing behind Ghosn during his imprisonment, on the presumption that Ghosn is innocent until proven guilty. However, France&#x27;s financial minister Bruno Le Maire stated on 16 January that Renault may seek a new CEO to replace Ghosn due to his continued incarceration. Renault possibly worried about Nissan taking the chance to use the power vacuum at Renault to reshape the alliance&#x27;s balance of power. After the French government called for leadership change and his bail requests were rejected by the Japanese courts, Ghosn finally agreed to step down. He resigned as chairman and CEO of Renault on 24 January 2019.

On 30 January 2019, Ghosn said the charges were &quot;plot and treason&quot; by executives at Nissan who opposed the relationship with Renault and a future plan that was in the works to integrate Nissan, Mitsubishi and Renault. In mid-February 2019, Ghosn&#x27;s lead counsel Motonari Otsuru stepped down and was replaced by Jun&#x27;ichirō Hironaka, who has a record of success in a number of high-profile cases.

====Bail====
In early March 2019, Ghosn was granted a request for bail in a Tokyo court. This was his third bail request, and the first by his new legal team under Hironaka. The court set bail at 1 billion yen (about US$9 million) subject to stringent conditions. He was not allowed to travel abroad, and had to remain at a given address under 24-hour camera surveillance, with no internet access. He was released on 6 March 2019.

On 3 April 2019, Ghosn tweeted that he was &quot;ready to tell the truth&quot; and that he would hold a conference on 11 April 2019. He was re-arrested for the fourth time early on 4 April 2019 over new suspicions of financial misconduct concerning alleged dealings via Oman. Ghosn released a statement claiming the arrest was &quot;outrageous and arbitrary&quot;. Until that point in time he had been held for 108 days since he was first arrested in November 2018.

On 8 April 2019, during an extraordinary shareholders&#x27; meeting, Nissan shareholders voted to remove Ghosn from the company board. Shareholders also voted to remove Ghosn&#x27;s former right-hand man Greg Kelly, and to appoint Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard as a director. The next day, Ghosn posted a YouTube video, where he publicly stated that he was &quot;innocent of all the accusations that came around these charges that are all biased, taken out of context, twisted in a way to paint a personage of greed, and a personage of dictatorship&quot;. He also claimed that the payments to Juffali were meant to help Nissan fix a dispute with a local distributor, and to open a bank contract to convert his salary from yen to US dollars, in order to avoid currency swings.

The Japanese court rejected an appeal filed by Ghosn&#x27;s lawyers, and approved an initial 10 days detention for Ghosn, until 22 April 2019. He was released in late April, but confined to strict house arrest, including having no contact with his wife for four months.

====Investigations in other countries====
In June 2019, Renault published that in an internal audit they had uncovered 11 million euros in questionable expenses by Ghosn, which was followed by the French state opening its own investigation into his actions. Prosecutors in the district of Nanterre west of Paris stated that anti-fraud police had searched his residence in the town of L&#x27;Étang-la-Ville for evidence. In July Renault&#x27;s headquarters in Boulogne-Billancourt were searched by 20 police personnel in relation to this case.

In August 2019, his wife Carole appealed to President Emmanuel Macron of France to intercede on behalf of her husband with Japanese leader Shinzo Abe at the 45th G7 summit held from 24 to 26 August at the French town of Biarritz.

In September 2019, in one of the first legal accords of the saga, Ghosn settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over claims of failing to disclose more than $140 million in pay to him from Nissan. He was fined $1 million while Nissan was fined $15 million and Greg Kelly $100,000. Although he neither admitted nor denied the SEC&#x27;s charges, he accepted a ten-year ban from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Kelly accepted a five-year ban under similar terms. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the settlement all but ended Ghosn&#x27;s career as a global business executive.

===Flight from Japan===
On 30 December 2019, numerous media outlets reported that Ghosn had escaped from Japan and arrived in Beirut, Lebanon. Ghosn later confirmed these reports through a statement released by his press representative in New York. In his statement, Ghosn claimed that he would &quot;no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant and basic human rights are denied.&quot;

Ghosn left his Tokyo apartment at around 14:30 on 29 December 2019 and joined two men at a nearby hotel. The three then took a bullet train from Shinagawa to Osaka and arrived at a hotel near Kansai International Airport just after 20:00. The team hired to extract him from Tokyo had noticed that Japanese security did not follow Ghosn into hotels, which facilitated his escape. A few hours later, two men left the hotel carrying large containers, including an audio equipment box where Ghosn was hidden. The men then boarded a Bombardier Global Express private jet with Turkish registration TC-TSR. The large box carrying Ghosn was never x-rayed or checked by customs officials, because it was too big to fit inside the x-ray machine; the plane left Kansai Airport at 23:10, landing at Istanbul Atatürk Airport at 5:26 on the morning of 30 December 2019. Within an hour of the plane&#x27;s landing, a separate private jet left for Beirut. An employee at Turkish private jet operator MNG Jet admitted to falsifying passenger records, in which two separate planes were leased, one from Dubai to Osaka and then Osaka to Istanbul, the other from Istanbul to Beirut.

The Lebanese Ambassador to Japan, Nidal Yehya, denied the involvement of the Embassy of Lebanon in Ghosn&#x27;s escape, but &quot;always stressed to him that he must abide by all the conditions of his release, as decided by the Criminal Court in Tokyo&quot;.

===Residence in Lebanon===
Following Ghosn&#x27;s arrival in Lebanon, a Tokyo court granted a request by Japanese prosecutors to revoke his bail. While Japan and Lebanon are both members of Interpol and have had diplomatic relations since 1954, there is no extradition agreement between the two countries. Interpol has issued a red notice for his arrest. Japanese authorities raided Ghosn&#x27;s Tokyo apartment on 2 January 2020 looking for evidence.

Ghosn later addressed reports that his family, including his wife Carole, may have played a role in his departure from Japan, stating that &quot;such speculation is inaccurate and false.&quot; On 7 January 2020, prosecutors in Japan issued an arrest warrant for Carole Ghosn on suspicion of giving false testimony during a court hearing in April 2019.

Carlos Ghosn held his first press conference since leaving Japan on 8 January 2020, in which he described his imprisonment conditions, pleaded innocence, and named Nissan executives who plotted his demise. He claimed that when he left Japan, &quot;I fled injustice and political persecution.&quot; The next day, Judge Ghassan Ouiedat, a Lebanese prosecutor, imposed a travel ban on Ghosn. After he escaped from Japan, Carlos Ghosn&#x27;s Japanese lawyer and seven other members of his defense resigned. His lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, said his escape was a &quot;complete surprise&quot;.

On 10 February 2020, Ghosn hired former Disney president Michael Ovitz, co-founder of the Creative Artists Agency, as his Hollywood agent. On 12 February 2020, Nissan launched a $90 million lawsuit against Ghosn for alleged &quot;corrupt&quot; actions, and on 29 February 2020, Japan&#x27;s financial regulators fined Nissan 2.42 billion yen ($22 million) for underreporting remuneration of former Chairman Ghosn and other executives for years. On 8 July 2020, &quot;The Nikkei&quot; reported that $862,500 was paid from a Paris bank account related to Ghosn to Promote Fox, a company managed by Michael Taylor, an ex-Green Beret who helped him flee to Lebanon.

Ghosn&#x27;s house in Lebanon sustained damage following the August 2020 Beirut explosion, which occurred 5 kilometers (3 miles) away from the residence.

On 3 November 2020, Lebanon&#x27;s prosecutor general decided not to charge Ghosn for visiting Israel in 2008 because the statute of limitations had expired. Previously, some Lebanese lawyers wanted Ghosn prosecuted over his 2008 trip to Israel as the chairman of Renault-Nissan to meet Better Place founder Shai Agassi, which they claim violated the Arab League boycott of Israel. Also in the same month Nissan fired its global general counsel Ravinder Passi, who claimed to have whistle-blown improper handling of the Ghosn case inside Nissan.

On 23 November 2020, a panel of human rights experts working with the United Nations concluded that Ghosn&#x27;s arrest and detention in Japan were &quot;fundamentally unfair&quot;. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention also stated that the Japanese government should give Ghosn &quot;compensation&quot; and &quot;other reparations&quot; due to the arrest and detention conditions in November 2018. Despite the fact that the Nelson Mandela Rules set a 15-day limit on how long prisoners can be kept in isolation, Kelly was held in solitary confinement for 37 days before he was granted bail, and Ghosn for 108 days. The Taylors were in solitary confinement for more than 100 days each. &quot;The Carlos Ghosn case, including Greg Kelly and the Taylors, is an aberration,&quot; said William Cleary, an expert on Japanese law with a doctorate in criminal procedure.

In December 2020, it was reported that French investigators would meet with Ghosn in January 2021 as part of a separate investigation of expenses covered by a Dutch subsidiary of Renault and Nissan. Ghosn is under two investigations in France, one that is focused on suspicious transactions between Renault and a distributor in Oman, as well as another investigation into alleged illegal payments for private trips and events paid by Renault-Nissan&#x27;s Netherlands-based holding company, RNBV. In a January 2021 interview, Ghosn questioned why France was questioning him over the charges, while Japan did not, and denied the charges.

In February 2024, four senior Nissan workers were charged with stealing documents, files, and electronic devices from Ghosn&#x27;s Beirut home and office.

===Prosecution and conviction of facilitators of his escape from Japan===
Arrest warrants issued by Japanese prosecutors on 30 January 2020 claimed that the escape operation was orchestrated by former United States Army Special Forces soldier Michael Taylor, a private-security contractor with extensive contacts in Lebanon. The warrants also claimed that Taylor was assisted by his son Peter Maxwell Taylor and a third American, George Antoine Zayek. Michael Taylor had conducted similar international rescue operations in the past.

On 8 May, Turkey charged seven people accused of helping Ghosn flee to Lebanon via Istanbul. On 20 May, United States authorities arrested Michael and Peter Taylor on suspicion of helping Ghosn escape. On 30 October 2020, the US agreed to extradite the Taylors to Japan.

In June 2021, Michael Taylor and his son Peter, pleaded guilty in Tokyo to helping Ghosn escape from Japan in December 2019. The Taylors later expressed their regret and apologized to the Japanese. In addition, it was revealed that Ghosn paid the Taylors more than $1 million for their services, in the form of bank transfers and bitcoin payments.

In July 2021, the Taylors were convicted and sentenced in Japan for aiding Ghosn. Michael was sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment while his son received a sentence of 20 months. In October 2022, the two were transferred to the United States by the Federal Bureau of Prisons after the two governments agreed to allow the Taylors to serve out the remainder of their sentences in the United States.

===Further prosecutions===
In April 2022, France issued an international warrant for Ghosn&#x27;s arrest, in addition to four other individuals who administrated the Omani company Suhail Bahwan Automobiles, in which the latter had allegedly helped Ghosn to funnel millions of dollars of Renault funds through them for his personal use, including the purchase of a yacht. Ghosn said the timing of this warrant was &quot;suspicious&quot; and later mentioned that he wanted to stand trial on charges of financial wrongdoing to clear his name.

In October 2023, a Lebanese court ruled that Ghosn and his wife must vacate his residence, valued at $19 million, in Achrafieh, Beirut within a month. The decision was taken four years after Phoinos Investment accused him of &quot;violation of private property&quot; and residing there without legal basis. Ghosn appealed the verdict, claiming that the company was affiliated with Nissan, and that the property was purchased according to a signed agreement with the latter which granted him the right to live there. The eviction order was halted until the lawsuit with Phoinos is concluded in December 2023.

==Personal life==

Ghosn&#x27;s first marriage was to Rita Kordahi, who came originally from Rayfoun, Lebanon, and whom he met in France in 1984. Together they had four children: Caroline, Nadine, Maya and Anthony. They divorced in 2012. In May 2016, Ghosn married Lebanese-American Carole Nahas, and a few months later in October, threw a large party at the Grand Trianon of the Palace of Versailles, in the outskirts of Paris, to celebrate both the wedding and Carole&#x27;s 50th birthday. He is reported by several Japanese media to have six private residences: in Tokyo, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Amsterdam, Beirut, and New York.

Ghosn, whom &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine called &quot;the hardest-working man in the brutally competitive global car business&quot;, as of 2006 was splitting his time between Paris and Tokyo and logging roughly in airplanes per year. Japanese media called him &quot;Seven-Eleven&quot; (&quot;work very hard from early in the morning till late at night&quot;). He holds citizenship to Lebanon, Brazil and France. He has been noted for his direct, results-and-execution-oriented style in business strategy meetings, and for his interest in resolving problems from within a company by listening to workers and by cross-functional and cross-cultural team groupings.

Ghosn is multilingual, speaking four languages fluently – Arabic, English, French, and Portuguese – and he has also studied Japanese. He is a partner in Ixsir, a winery in the northern coastal town of Batroun, Lebanon. In 2012, he was named to the Honorary Board of the American Foundation of Saint George Hospital in Beirut. In 2020, he became a coach to business leaders at USEK.

Ghosn was hailed as a potential presidential candidate in Lebanon in 2007. In a June 2011 survey by life-insurance company Axa, Ghosn was ranked No. 7 in a random poll asking Japanese people, &quot;Which celebrity do you want to run Japan?&quot; (Barack Obama was No. 9, and Prime Minister Naoto Kan was No. 19.) He has so far declined such overtures, saying he has &quot;no political ambitions&quot;.

Ghosn&#x27;s lawyers have stated he has chronic kidney disease which they claim was worsened by his lack of access to proper treatment while imprisoned.

===In the media===

Beginning in November 2001, Ghosn&#x27;s life story was turned into a superhero comic book series in Japan, titled &quot;The True Story of Carlos Ghosn&quot;, in the manga comic book &quot;Big Comic Superior&quot;. The series was published as a book in 2002. His face has been reproduced both in Lebanese postage stamps and in bento boxes in Japanese restaurants.

Ghosn is the subject of a number of books in English, Japanese, and French. In English, he wrote a bestselling business book called &quot;Shift: Inside Nissan&#x27;s Historic Revival&quot;. He was the subject of another business book called &quot;Turnaround: How Carlos Ghosn Rescued Nissan&quot; by David Magee. He also provided strategic business commentary and on-the-job lessons to aspiring managers in a book called &quot;The Ghosn Factor: 24 Inspiring Lessons From Carlos Ghosn, the Most Successful Transnational CEO&quot; by Miguel Rivas-Micoud.

Netflix in 2022 released a documentary titled &quot;Fugitive: The Curious Case of Carlos Ghosn&quot;, which chronicles Ghosn&#x27;s rise, as well as the internal rivalries and tensions he sparked within Nissan-Renault, and his dramatic arrest. Apple TV+ released a documentary titled &quot;Wanted: The Escape of Carlos Ghosn,&quot; in 2023.

<text>Leça da Palmeira () is an area in the Portuguese city of Matosinhos north of the Leça river. It was a civil parish until 2013, when it was merged with the parish of Matosinhos, forming Matosinhos e Leça da Palmeira. The parish covered and had 18,502 inhabitants in the 2011 census.

Its cultural heritage includes the Fort of Leça da Palmeira, Leça Lighthouse and religious monuments such as Corpo Santo, Santana, and Boa Nova churches. The parish includes three spaces designed by renowned Portuguese architects, Piscinas de Marés, a public pool by the beach, and Boa Nova Tea House, both designed by Siza Vieira and Quinta da Conceição Municipal Park designed by Fernando Távora.

In sport, the parish includes a football club, Leça FC, and a basketball club, Grupo Desportivo de Basquete de Leça.

== History ==
The history of Leça da Palmeira dates back to Roman times, with its name likely derived from Lettia, a Roman villa located along the banks of the Leça River. The area was historically a stopping point for pilgrims traveling from the Holy Land, and it is believed that the name &quot;Leça da Palmeira&quot; refers to the location where these pilgrims, known as palmeiros, would disembark and rest.

The first historical mention of the locality appears in 1081, when it was referred to as Villa Fosse de Leza. By the early 13th century, the area was home to a significant church dedicated to Saint Michael (São Miguel), which became a key part of the region&#x27;s identity. This led to variations in the name of the area over time, including São Miguel de Leça da Palmeira, São Miguel da Palmeira, and São Miguel de Bouças, the later named after the locality of Bouças in Matosinhos, the municipal seat at the time.

== Economy ==
Leça da Palmeira&#x27;s economy has been significantly shaped by its coastal location and industrial history. It is home to Portugal&#x27;s second largest seaport, Leixões.

A large oil refinery operated by Galp Energia was located in the northern end of Leça da Palmeira, but it was shut down in April 2021. The land where the oil refinery was located is being redeveloped into an &quot;Innovation District,&quot; focusing on future energy technologies, research, and development, including a new campus of the University of Porto. The closure marked a significant transition for the local economy, affecting approximately 400 workers, with 150 being laid off and others redeployed within the company. As of 2024, a significant number of former employees remained unemployed.

<doc id="1340629" wikidata="Q626019" url="?curid=1340629" title="Araniko">
<text>Aniko, Anige or Araniko (, ; 1245–1306) was one of the key figures in the arts of Nepal and the Yuan dynasty of China, and the artistic exchanges in these areas. He was born in Kathmandu Valley during the reign of Abhaya Malla. He is known for building the White Stupa at the Miaoying Temple in Beijing. During the reign of Jayabhimadeva, he was sent on a project to build a golden stupa in Tibet, where he also initiated into monkhood. From Tibet he was sent further to northern China to work in the court of the emperor Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty, where he brought the trans-Himalayan artistic tradition to China. Araniko led a team of 80 artists to China proper and Tibet to make a number of pagoda-style buildings. In his later life, he renounced monkhood and started a family.

To some confusion in translation, his name is variously written as Arniko or Araniko in old texts. A mistake made by Baburam Acharya ascribed his Sanskrit name as Balabahu. However, later he contends that Aniko might possibly be the Chinese pronunciation for the Sanskrit name Aneka. It is also plausible that his name could mean AA Ni Ka, meaning &quot;respectable brother from Nepal&quot;.

==Early years==
Araniko was born in 1245 in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, when it was ruled by King Abhaya Malla (1216–55). While Nepalese history does not have any record of Arniko and everything that is known of him comes from Chinese accounts, Chinese history and historian Baburam Acharya opines that Araniko could possibly be from Patan, a place famous for sculptures and fine arts. As such, he would have been a Buddhist but his Newar caste is open to speculation. However, it is known that Araniko lived in Kathmandu Valley also during the reign of Jayabhimadeva (1255-71), the successor of Abhaya Malla.

In the Chinese records, the name of his grandfather is given as &quot;Mi-ti-rha&quot; and grandmother as &quot;Kun-di-la-qi-mei&quot;, Chinese pronunciation for Sanskrit names Mitra and Kundalaxmi respectively. His father&#x27;s name was &quot;La-ke-na&quot; (Lakshman) while his mother&#x27;s name was &quot;Shu-ma-ke-tai&quot;.

As is often told in stories about professional artists, Aniko was an artistic prodigy even in his early childhood. An anecdote from his epitaph relates that when he was three years old, his parents in took the child to a temple to pay homage to the Buddha. Looking up at a stupa, he asked &quot;who made its wooden &quot;stambha&quot;, &quot;bhumis&quot;, &quot;anda&quot;?&quot; Greatly surprised, the people around realized that he was a born artist. When he was about seven, his temperament was sober like an adult. At school, he mastered his textbooks and became a good calligrapher in such a short time that even the venerable elders acknowledged their inferiority. He could memorize treatises on art as soon as he heard them read. Before he left Nepal for Tibet, he was already an expert in painting, modeling, and casting images.

==Mission to Yuan-China==


===Historical background===
The event that brought Arniko to Tibet, and eventually to the Yuan court in Shangdu (today&#x27;s Beijing), was Kublai Khan&#x27;s decree of 1260 CE to Drogön Chögyal Phagpa, the fifth patriarch of Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, to build a golden stupa for Suer chi wa (Tibetan: &quot;Chos rje pa&quot; or &quot;the Lord of Dharma&quot;), that is the Sakya Pandita Kun dga&#x27; rgyal mtshan (1182–1251), the fourth patriarch of the sect. Kublai&#x27;s order was one of the indicators of his acceptance of Sakya teaching.

The timing of the construction, 1260, is worth noticing. In April 1260, Kublai was elected as the Great Khan by his own supporters, to rival the claim of his younger brother Ariq Böke. Thus was launched a civil war between the brothers for the leadership of the Empire. In the twelfth month of 1260, he appointed Phagpa his Imperial preceptor and granted him a jade seal and the position of leader of Buddhism. By doing so Kublai officially acknowledged Phagpa as his highest religious authority and was obliged to patronize the Sakya teaching. In return, he expected the Sakya sect to provide religious sanction. The building of the stupa was not only a tribute to the Sakya Pandita but intended also as a project to win religious blessings in a critical year. Ariq Böke finally submitted to Kublai at Shangdu on 21 August 1264.

===Lhasa===

To build the stupa, Phagpa drafted artisans from Nepal. The iconographies and artistic values of the Tibetans had a close affinity with those of the Nepali tradition. Therefore, it was natural for Phagpa to turn to Nepal for gifted artists. He intended to recruit one hundred artists, but Jayabhimadeva, the king of Nepal at the time, was able to hand over only eighty. With his appointment as Imperial Preceptor in 1260, it must have been his vision and ambition for the future propagation of his sect throughout the still-growing Mongol empire that he tried to scour for more artists.

The artists bound for Tibet were ordered to choose a leader from among themselves. Perhaps due to the uncertainty of their future, nobody was courageous enough to take up the responsibility, except for the confident Arniko. When the king tried to discourage him because of his youth, he replied, &quot;My body is indeed young, but my mind is not.&quot; The king eventually made him the team leader of eighty artisans and sent him to Lhasa. He was only seventeen when he departed from Nepal.

In Tibet, Arniko impressed Phagpa at their first meeting in 1261. Phagpa immediately recognized his exceptional artistic skill and administrative ability and entrusted him to supervise the construction. The stupa was built within the Main Hall of the Sakya Monastery. Arniko spent two years on this project. After its completion, Phagpa was unwilling to let him leave when he asked for permission to return to Nepal.

By this time, Kublai Khan had defeated Ariq Böke, and both Kublai and Phagpa must have felt that the construction of the stupa in the Sakya monastery had gained religious merit that contributed to Kublai&#x27;s military victory and other achievements. As Imperial Preceptor, Phagpa was ready to go to the court and disseminate his sect&#x27;s teachings. Since no artist in China could make the bewildering array of Himalayan Tantric deities that would be indispensable for his religious activities, he needed to bring with him someone who could. Arniko was a natural choice. Instead of going back to Nepal, Phagpa encouraged him to go to the Mongol court to present himself to Kublai Khan. Phagpa accepted Arniko as his disciple and initiated him into secret Buddhist treaties, thus elevating his social status above an ordinary artisan. Thus having discovered Arniko, Phagpa personally prepared and trained Arniko for his future tasks at the court.

===Shangdu===


Arniko arrived in Shangdu (Xanadu) by the end of 1262. The following account of the meeting between Arniko and Kublai Khan is recorded by Cheng Jufu :

 On hearing his recommendation, the Kublai immediately ordered the envoy to summon him. After he arrived, the Emperor looked at him at length before asking, &quot;Are you afraid to come to the big country?&quot; He answered, &quot;The sage regards people in all directions as his sons. When a son comes to his father, what is there to fear?&quot; &quot;Why do you come?&quot; He replied, &quot;My family has been living in the west for generations. I took the imperial edict to build the stupa in Tibet for two years. I saw constant wars there, and wish Your Majesty could pacify there. I come for sentient beings.&quot; &quot;What do you practice?&quot; He said, &quot;I take my mind as my teacher and know roughly painting, casting, and carving.&quot; 

The Emperor was greatly pleased and asked young Araniko to repair an important bronze idol presented as a gift by a Song emperor. It took him two years to finish the restoration. In the second month of 1265, Arniko finished the restoration and the statue looked so perfect that even the most skilled artists of China greatly admired his work.

In Yuan China, he designed and built many buildings. His most renowned architecture is the White Stupa of Miaoying Temple in Beijing, which was the largest structure at that time. Taking almost ten years (1279–1288 CE) to complete, the Stupa better known as White Dagoba, is still standing today. It rises to a height of 50.9 meters and has a diameter of over 30 meters at its base. Thirteen broad circular bands of molding, called the “Thirteen Heavens,” divide its surface. At the apex of the cone is an umbrella-like bronze disc structure with 36 bronze bells hanging from its rim. At the very top is a small bronze pagoda, in itself a work of art. In 1961, then Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai signed a Proclamation stating that the Temple was to be protected as a National Treasure. This Proclamation kept the White Stupa safe during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. In 1976, the temple was seriously damaged by the Tangshan earthquake. The top of stupa tilted to one side, and the bricks and mortar supporting the stupa crumbled off, and many relics were broken. In 1978, the Beijing Department of Cultural Relics undertook the task of repairing and renovating the temple. As of 2010, the Stupa complex is currently undergoing another renovation.

It is summarized in his epitaph that during his lifetime, Arniko completed three stupas, nine great Buddhist temples, two Confucian shrines, one Daoist temple, and countless images and objects used in and out of the court. Arniko was also a fine painter, and he executed a number of portraits of the imperial family. The portraits of Kublai Khan and his wife Chabi, now located in the National Palace Museum in Taipei, are believed to be his handiwork.

Araniko was accorded with high honors during his lifetime. He was named Director of All Artisan Classes in 1273 and trained many Chinese craftsmen in the Sakya style. By 1274, he was given a silver plate to wear with an image of a tiger on it. The emperor became very fond of him and gave him the title &quot;Duke of Liang&quot; as an honour. Decorated with Ta Sa Thu, an equivalent of a minister, he is among the few foreigners whose biography can be found in Chinese imperial history books. The most important source of Arniko&#x27;s life and career is his official epitaph written by Cheng Jufu (1249–1314) under Ayurbarwada&#x27;s (Renzong, r. 1311–20) order of 1316, &quot;Liangguo Minhui gong shendao bei&quot; (The Spirit-way Stele for Minhui, the Duke of State of Liang), in Cheng Jufu, &quot;Cheng Xuelou wenji&quot; (The Collective Works of Cheng Jufu). Another important source is Arniko&#x27;s official biography in Song Lian and Wang Yi, &quot;Yuanshi&quot; (The Yuan History), compiled under the supervision of the early Ming dynasty. It is largely based on the epitaph but contains some new information as well.

==Death==
Arniko had six sons, two of whom, Asengge () and Ashula () followed his career path as artists working for the Yuan dynasty. He lived in China until his death in March 1306 at the age of sixty-two. Of his death Cheng Jufu writes:

 On the eighth of March of 1306, he looked at the people around himself and said, &quot;If I am going, you should set up curtains in the hall and a couch, so that I can pass away in peaceful sleep.&quot; The next day, he took a bath and went to court. After returning, he appeared ill. Palace envoys and doctors visited, but he passed away in sleep on the eleventh. The emperor grieved over his death after hearing the news and halted the court session. He ordered palace officials to take care of the family, and reward the family twenty-five thousand taels of silver. The Emperor ordered the authorities concerned to make arrangements for the funeral. That night a star fell into the courtyard. The next day saw icicles on the trees. Seven days after, on the seventeenth of March, his remains were cremated according to Nepali custom. On the fifteenth of July, his ashes were buried in the stupa at Gangziyuan, Xiangshan, Wanping County (near the capital).
The inscription on the stele set up in his memory reads:


::When the sage (Kublai) arose,
::All could behold.
::He knew he should come,
::As if to parent&#x27;s home,
::Like all the spokes
::::that merge in the hub,

::::the other man&#x27;s heart.
::Emperor Kublai
::::has a natural flair.

::The graceful Duke of Liang
::::is the essence of the West.

::His words to the Emperor
::::were modest and excellent.
::&quot;Why have you come?&quot;
::&quot;For the people of the West.&quot;

::::a mutual understanding.
::The Emperor is virtuous,
::::and the subject dutiful.

==Legacy==
Arniko&#x27;s imperial portraits represent the watershed between Song, Yuan and later imperial portraits. The aim of later portraits were no longer to suggest virtuous conduct, but physiognomy. This approach was followed not only in later Yuan imperial portraits but also in the Ming and Qing imperial portraits which became increasingly frontal and rigid, and eventually more and more realistic under the new influence of European portraiture.

The history of Chinese Buddhist art witnessed three major waves of artistic influences from Central and South Asia: Gandhāra art before the Tang (618–907), Gupta art during the Tang, and Pāla-Himalayan art during the Yuan. Arniko is the figure representing the third wave. The artworks from his institutions, stupas, and the two Yuan portraits from his hand demonstrate that by drawing inspiration from the artistic traditions of Pāla, Nepal, and China. After the collapse of Mongol rule in China, Arniko&#x27;s artistic legacy and innovation continued to influence Buddhist art at the Ming and Qing courts.

The Nepalese government, in recognition of his achievements, had issued postal stamps in his name to honor him. The Araniko Highway in Nepal is also named after him.

<text>Ninnian Joseph Yule (30 April 1892 – 30 March 1950) was a Scottish-American burlesque and vaudeville actor who later appeared in many films as a character actor. He starred alongside Renie Riano in the &quot;Jiggs and Maggie&quot; film series. Yule was the father of actor Mickey Rooney.

==Biography==
Ninnian Joseph Yule was born in the Hutchesontown district of Glasgow on 30 April 1892, the son of Elizabeth (née McKell; 1866–1919) and boiler maker Ninnian Yule (1866–1943). He emigrated to the United States with his parents on the steamship &quot;Bolivia&quot;, arriving at the Port of New York on 2 August 1892. They settled in Brooklyn. As a teenager, Yule performed in local vaudeville theatres and was later booked into leading burlesque wheels, including the Columbia Burlesque Wheel, where he adopted the stage name Joe Yule.

In 1919, Yule married fellow vaudevillian Nellie W. Carter, a native of Kansas City, Missouri. In 1920, while they were appearing together in a Brooklyn production of &quot;A Gaiety Girl&quot;, their son Ninnian Joseph Yule Jr. was born. He later became a Hollywood actor under the name Mickey Rooney. The Yules separated in 1924 during a slump in vaudeville, and Carter moved with her son to Hollywood in 1925. Yule was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in Los Angeles on 14 May 1943.

Yule died of a heart attack on 30 March 1950 in Hollywood, California. He was 57. Rooney arranged to have his father buried near Rooney&#x27;s friend and longtime acting colleague, Wallace Beery, who had died the year before. He wrote, &quot;I thought it was fitting that these two comedians should rest in peace, side by side.&quot;

<text>Bhakti Thapa Chhetri (; 1741 A.D. Lamjung, Nepal – 1815 A.D.) was a Nepali military commander and administrator in the Kingdom of Nepal. Initially, he served the Kingdom of Lamjung. He is considered one of the national heroes of Nepal.

&quot;Grand Old Man&quot; Bhakti Thapa Chhetri as a punwar Thapa was the Sardar (commander) of Lamjung state. He fought against Gorkhali in the battle from the side of Kehari Narayan, the King of Lamjung. After the fall of Lamjung in the battle against the Gorkhali (Nepali) forces, he was captured and brought to Kathmandu as a prisoner of war. Later he was appointed as sirdar (one of the sirdars) in the Nepali army. Two years after the unification of Jumla, he was made the supreme commander (Sardar) of the Nepalese army stationed to the west of the capital in a region that stretched almost up to the Sutlej river, and also the administrator of this region.

Sardar Bhakti Thapa had great success in the unification of the Jumla District. He was involved in the Anglo-Nepali War. His most important contribution to the war was at the western front of Deothal.

In the Anglo-Nepal war, Sardar Bhakti Thapa was controlling the operation of the whole Western Region of Nepal from the fort of Malaun, whereas the fort of Surajgadh was in the south of this fort. As the British forces had control over the fort of Deuthal, away from Malaun fort, the whole of the Western Region was at stake, which made Sardar Bhakti Thapa Chhetri go to the battlefield, taking naked Khukuri and sword on his hand, along with 2,000 Nepali soldiers amidst the fierce gun-firing of the British army on April 16, 1815. There was fierce fighting between the two forces, killing 100 soldiers of the British army while all the officers were killed except only in the arsenal. In this battle when Sardar Bhakti Thapa Chhetri tried to capture a British cannon, he was hit by a bullet at his heart. Major David Ochterlony, handed over very respectfully to the Nepali army, the dead body of Sardar Bhakti Thapa Chhetri after covering it with dosalla (a woollen shawl). The very next day, his body was cremated with the due state guard of honour. His two wives committed Sati (burning themselves on their husband&#x27;s pyre). Before going to the battlefield, he had handed over his grandson to Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa Chhetri. Sitting at the foot of the flag of Nepal, Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa Chhetri and Ram Das, the son of Sardar Bhakti Thapa Chhetri, encouraged the Nepalese army to look around at the sight of war. The Deothal battle marked a significant moment in the Anglo-Nepal War, demonstrating Nepalese resilience despite the eventual British advance. Historians and local traditions often describe Sardar Bhakti Thapa&#x27;s actions at the Deothal battle as legendary, reflecting his dedication to Nepal&#x27;s sovereignty.

He was Thapa Chhetri. He belonged to the Punwar Thapa clan.

==Childhood legend==

According to recent historians, Bhakti Thapa was born in 1741. Bhakti Thapa&#x27;s family lived in Dhangai, a remote village in Lamjung. Very little is known about the childhood life of Bhakti Thapa. There was, however, an unbelievable incident in the early life of Bhakti Thapa. That incident is virtually like a description from the children&#x27;s storybook. The full details of that incident had been passed down through the generations. Still, many old people in Lamjung are seen telling that incident to their youngsters. That incident is described below.

Bhakti Thapa was still a very young boy. One day he was sleeping on a big boulder not far away from his house in a remote village of Lamjung while his flocks of goats grazed the buckwheat field of the neighbour. The old neighbour woman stormed out of her house into the place where Bhakti Thapa was fast asleep in a rage cursing him for his misdeeds. What she saw at that time chilled her blood. Bhakti Thapa was sleeping on a big serpent coiled up on the boulder raising its wide hood high above the casting shed that protected the young Bhakti Thapa against the scorching heat of the midday sun. The serpent slowly uncoiled without waking up the boy and descended from the boulder. It disappeared from sight after slipping into the bushes nearby.

The parents of Bhakti Thapa were terribly distressed when they learnt about the whole incident. They thanked God for saving the life of their beloved son. The old neighbour woman who saw the whole incident had a completely different opinion. The neighbor, witnessing the event, believed that Bhakti Thapa might have a significant destiny, a sentiment that contributed to local folklore about his early life. He possessed some sort of divine power. She was quick to realize that one day Bhakti Thapa would become a very famous person. The news of this incident quickly spread across the Lamjung and beyond.

The big boulder near the native home of Bhakti Thapa in Lamjung is linked up twice with the events in his later life. After some years a grand ritual was performed to solemnize the brotherhood relationship (in Nepali metairi) between Bhakti Thapa and that big boulder. The third event that linked Bhakti Thapa with that big boulder near his native home was the last in his life. It is said that at that very moment during the Anglo-Nepal War when Bhakti Thapa fell in the Deothal Battlefield on April 16, 1815, the big boulder near his native home also cracked with a loud explosion. The cracked boulder is still lying there. The government of Nepal (GoN) declared him a national hero on 28 July 2021.

==Unification campaign of Nepal==

Bhakti Thapa joined the unification campaign in 1789 at a time when the further advance of the Nepalese force to the west was completely blocked for more than two years by the then-powerful kingdom of Jumla. It is said that Jumla had collected an army of twenty-two thousand men to face the Gorkhalis, a force far superior to anything the Gorkhalis could put in the field at that time In the first major military operation itself Bhakti Thapa had demonstrated his exceptionally brilliant skill in launching a very successful operation under the most adverse condition that was sure to astonish anyone. He changed the strategy of the predecessors and led an attack on Jumla from the difficult north route. The result was a swift victory and the lives of many people were also saved.

Within a very short period of just two years, from 1789 to 1791, the western boundary of the Great Nepal had extended nearly as far as the Sutlez River (now India). Bhakti Thapa played a crucial role in such rapid expansion of Great Nepal. At that very time, Nepal was attacked by China from the north. During that period China was ruled by the powerful Emperor Chiang Lung of the Manchu Dynasty.

Among the Manchu emperors, Kang Hu Shi and Chiang Lung are considered to be the most influential. Emperor Kang Hu Shi ruled China from 1661 to 1722. He was contemporary with the Louis XIV of France, Peter the Great of Russia and Aurangazeb of India. Similarly, Emperor Chiang Lung ruled from 1736 to 1796. During his reign, countries like Burna or Korea were under the influence of China.

==Administration in the Western Front==
The royal court sent the following orders to Bhakti Thapa regarding the abolition of slave trading in Garhwal: 

==Nepal in great danger==
The Chinese invasion was directed straight towards Kathmandu. The main attack was centered on Kyrung, which is almost to the north of the Kathmandu Valley. The Chinese attack was anticipated well in advance. As a result, Nepal had withdrawn most of its troops and commanders from the west to defend the capital Kathmandu against the Chinese invasion. It was the most critical period in the history of the newly born Great Nepal.

The existence of Nepal was in great danger. The country was under the threat of falling apart. In many areas, the rulers of the old regimes, who were disgruntled at the creation of the Great Nepal, had begun to stir up unrest. According to &quot;Sainikitihas&quot; of Nepal, Bhakti Thapa stationed in Kumaun virtually single-handedly succeeded in quelling the unrest fomented by the rulers of the old regime in the vast western regions which were very recently merged into the Great Nepal, despite the fact that he was made supreme commander and administrator of the territory stretching from Chepe-Marshyangdi to almost Sutlez River only in 1794. The &quot;Sainikitihas&quot; describe that Bhakti Thapa was constantly on the move from one end of this vast region to the other end, to prevent the Great Nepal from falling apart.

The Nepal-China war concluded with a treaty that reflected mutual interest in ending hostilities, though the resolution left some territorial and political questions unresolved. The fighting ended. According to L. Stiller, there was no real winner. Immediately after the signing of the peace treaty with China, Bhakti Thapa headquartered in Kumaun (now India) became the governor and chief commander of the whole region from the Chepe-Marshyangdi to almost the Sutlez River (in Pakistan).

==Britain&#x27;s suspicion==
The process of expansion of the Great Nepal was rapid. It was natural for the East India Company to be greatly alarmed. So the East India Company administration might not have in reality any intention of helping Nepal. We can draw such a conclusion from the circumstances surrounding the visit of Captain Kirkpatrick to Kathmandu in 1793. The Governor-general of India had agreed to send Kirkpatrick to mediate in the Nepal-China dispute. Kirkpatrick did not even set out for Nepal until after the war had been successfully terminated by the Nepal-China agreement. The governor general was requested not to send Kirkpatrick since the war had been amicably concluded. Surprisingly the governor general was adamant on sending a man to Kathmandu. So Kirkpatrick visited Kathmandu for no specific official purpose. The intention of Kirkpatrick&#x27;s visit could hardly be anything else but to watch closely Nepal&#x27;s speedy preparation for the next phase of the unification campaign that had officially led to the emergence of Bhakti Thapa as its head.

During the visit, Kirkpatrick found that Nepal was trying to reinvigorate the attack in the west. The circumstances, under which the visit of Kirkpatrick to Kathmandu took place, clearly show that the Company administration in India w all the time watching Nepal with great suspicion. At that time the East India Company administration were adopting every possible method to enlarge the territory under their control. The way new territories were brought under the control if the East India Company and ruled had provoked the interest of the British public. The British Parliament had gone completely against it.

==Anglo-Nepal War==

The process of expansion of the Great Nepal had spread rapidly across the Himalayan region. So it was natural for the East India Company to be greatly alarmed. The Great Nepal was seen all along as a threat to Company rule in India till the end of the Anglo-Nepal War of 1814–16.

The East India Company actively began preparation for the war from the time when F.R. Warren Hastings - Earl of Moira landed in India as Governor General and Commander-in-Chief in 1813. The actual declaration of war against Nepal is recorded as 1 November 1814, though the war began from in middle of October. The decision to declare war had been made six months earlier so the territorial dispute appears to be only a pretext. Company forces had marched into Nepal across a frontier of more than to attack at several points at the same time. The eastern East India Company flank was moving north from the Teesta area, whereas the farthermost western flank came from the Sutlej River area. It was virtually modern-type warfare extended over a period of three calendar years and necessitating to protect the entire region bordering the enemy-held territory. The British invasion forces, in comparison with the Nepalese, had absolute superiority in cavalry, pioneers, and at least the superiority of 10 times in infantry and 100 times in artillery. They also had the advantage of maneuverability in movement.

In the early months of the war, the initial British invasion force was completely frustrated by Nepalese tactics. The British offensive ended in complete failure. Nepalese forces stationed within the shelter of the fortress were not only able to defend their position against an invading enemy many times superior in strength, but they even shocked them by their dreadful counteroffensive that used to be accompanied by big losses on the British side.

After the initial defeats, the British changed their strategy to avoid their casualties. They started to deploy long-range guns to level Nepal&#x27;s fortifications. This strategy paid off. The British were able to advance quickly into the territory under Nepal&#x27;s control. They even used elephants to carry heavy guns across the mountains. So the ability of the Nepalese force to defend the territory under their control was steadily declining. They were forced to pull back. There was a breakdown in the command and control system.

Towards the middle of 1815, Amar Singh Thapa, chief of the Nepalese forces fighting on the western front, was confined within a small area of the Malaun fort. The fate of Nepal was going to be in the hands of the Governor General Lord Hastings, who was determined to solidify Company rule in India. At that time he worked either to eliminate Nepal completely and bring it under Company rule or to transform it into a vassal state like so many other states under that category in Colonial India. He could be forced not to take any such decision detrimental to the honour of Nepal only if he perceived that such action could pose a serious threat to the continuance of Company rule in India. The Deothal Battle could not be anything else but a clear message of threat on behalf of Nepalese people to the East India Company warning them not to take lightly the determination of Nepalese people to protect the honour of their country.

==Battle of Deuthal==
Towards sunset on April 16, 1815, Bhakti Thapa and the army units under him arrived at the Malaun fort from their station at Surajgarh, without being noticed by the East India Company units scattered around the Malaun fortress.

The following day in the morning, Bhakti Thapa, at the age of 73, led a daring counterattack against the East India Company force entrenched at Deuthal. Historians have presented the description of this battle at great length. It was 3.15 a.m. when a force of just about 400 under Bhakti Thapa marched out of the Malaun fort, to a slow but steady beat of a drum. The British column under Thompson had taken position at Deothal on reverse slopes. The cannons of 6-pounders were properly concealed. There were two Indian battalions, the Grenadiers companies of the Light Battalions and some 1,000 irregulars. The British strength was up to about 3,500 troops and weapons.

Prior to leading the charge at Deothal, Bhakti Thapa entrusted his grandson to Amar Singh Thapa, showcasing his preparedness for the sacrifices of war. Bhakti Thapa had even handed his infant grandson to the custody of the Amar Singh Thapa just before going to the battlefield. Bhakti Thapa laid down his life on the battlefield. Every one who fought from the Nepalese side was either killed or wounded.

==Reputation==
Contemporary British accounts acknowledged Bhakti Thapa&#x27;s bravery at Deothal, though the battle ultimately resulted in heavy losses for the Nepalese forces. One of the historians, CB Khanduri writes quoting various contemporary British historians:
: &quot;The euphemism of the BRAVEST OF THE BRAVES had been used by Napoleon for Marshal Ney, whose bravery during the retreat from Moscow in 1812 was one of the highest. &quot;BRAVE LES BRAVE&quot;, said Napoleon of him. The British then used this citation for the Gurkhas during and after the Anglo-Nepal War. Such was the bravery shown by Bhakti Thapa that the next legend of the Bravest of the Braves had been created on the day - 16 April 1815 at Deothal.&quot;

<text>Econobox is a United States informal slang term for a small, boxy, fuel-efficient economy car with few luxuries and a low price. 

==History==
Econoboxes first came to prominence in the United States due to the 1973 oil crisis. Japanese automakers were leaders at producing smaller, fuel-efficient cars, as well as enjoying generally higher reliability and build quality than their US counterparts, so their offerings such as the Honda Civic generally outperformed their American competitors such as the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto.

The best-known American econoboxes were the 1970s/80s Chevrolet Chevette, Ford Pinto, Ford Escort and the Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon. Japanese econoboxes include the Honda Civic (in particular the first and second generations) and the Datsun B-210. Other cars such as the Chevrolet Sprint, Geo Metro, Yugo and Chevrolet Aveo as well as the Ford Festiva and Ford Aspire were considered econoboxes.

Amongst the econoboxes were sold by American brands, many were manufactured in foreign countries. American car manufacturers in North America have typically had a hard time making money off of econoboxes, and they consider them &quot;loss leaders&quot; that only existed to meet CAFE fuel economy standards. So, over the course of time, American car companies shifted from manufacturing econoboxes themselves, and partnered with a foreign manufacturer to build them. An example of this is the American Ford Escort: the Escort replaced the Pinto in 1981, and was manufactured by Ford until 1990. From 1991 to 1996, however, it was built using the Mazda B platform and the top trims featured a Mazda engine. Chevrolet did the same using its &quot;GEO&quot; line, to sell cars built by Suzuki and Toyota. Chrysler did as well, using cars built by Mitsubishi.

==Today==
The term &quot;econobox&quot; is not often used for describing new cars, partly due to the boxy styling of economy cars declining at the end of the 1980s.

Many long-running nameplates that obtained their start as econoboxes have since moved upscale. For example, the Austin Mini and VW Beetle have been revived as enthusiasts luxury cars, rather than cheap transportation for the masses. Meanwhile, the Toyota Corolla, Mazda 3 and the Honda Civic started as subcompact econoboxes but are now on the high-end of the compact size line. In 2023 the cheapest new car available in the United States is the Nissan Versa priced below US$20,000, with the cheapest trims starting at $16,000.

<text>A Christmas market is a street market associated with the celebration of Christmas during the four weeks of Advent. These markets originated in Germany, but are now held in many countries. Some in the U.S. have adapted the German name to quasi-English Christkindlmarket, swapping German &quot;Markt&quot; and &quot;market&quot;.

Christmas markets date to the Late Middle Ages in the German-speaking part of Europe and in many parts of the former Holy Roman Empire, which included many eastern regions of modern France. They became a popular Advent custom during the Reformation era. Dresden&#x27;s Striezelmarkt was first held in 1434 and one of the first true Christmas markets; earlier markets of the season were &quot;December markets&quot;. Early mentions of these &quot;December markets&quot; can be found in Vienna (1296), Munich (1310), Bautzen (1384), and Frankfurt (1393).

In many towns in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, Advent is usually ushered in with the opening of the Christmas market or &quot;Weihnachtsmarkt&quot;. In southern Germany, Switzerland and Austria, it is called a &quot;Christkind(e)l(s)(i)markt&quot; (German language, literally meaning &quot;Christ child market&quot;). Traditionally held in the town square, the market offers food, drinks and seasonal items for sale from open-air stalls, accompanied by traditional singing and dancing. On opening night at the Christkindlesmarkt in Nuremberg, and in some other towns, onlookers welcome the &quot;Christkind&quot; (originally boy Jesus, but often depicted as an angel-like girl), acted by a local child.

==History==

The first traces of Christmas markets in the German-speaking part of Europe and in many parts of the former Holy Roman Empire go back to late medieval sales fairs and—often one-day—markets, which gave citizens the opportunity to stock up on meat and winter necessities at the beginning of the cold season. In 1296, Duke Albert I of Austria granted the Viennese traders the privilege of holding a &quot;December market&quot; to supply the local population.

In the 14th century, the custom arose of allowing craftsmen such as toy makers, basket weavers and confectioners to set up stalls under the name &quot;Saint Nicholas market&quot; to sell the little things that children received as Christmas gifts. There were also stands selling roasted chestnuts, nuts and almonds. A Saint Nicholas market in Munich was first mentioned in a document in 1310. In 1384, King Wenceslas granted the town of Bautzen the right to hold a free meat market on Saturdays from St. Michael&#x27;s Day (29 September) until Christmas.

Over time, the tradition spread throughout the German-speaking world. The first document reporting a Christmas market is dated 1434 during the reign of Frederick II of Saxony, mentioning a &quot;Striezelmarkt&quot;, which took place in Dresden on the Monday before Christmas. Later, the Reformation continued the tradition by renaming it &quot;Christkindlmarkt&quot; (&quot;Christ Child market&quot;) to combat the cult of saints. The Strasbourg Christmas market dates from 1570, that of Nuremberg from 1628.

In the 19th century, the &quot;Christkindelsmärik&quot; (in Alsatian) of Strasbourg was held at the &quot;Frohnhof&quot; () between the Cathedral of Our Lady, the Palais Rohan and the Œuvre Notre-Dame Museum (current Place du Château) and took place eight days before Christmas and until midnight mass.

Since around the first half of the 20th century, markets have become an integral element of pre-Christmas customs. A revival took place in the mid-1990s. Many cities in Europe have established their own Christmas market with chalets and sometimes attractions (ephemeral ice rink, Ferris wheel, etc.), thus offering a more commercial market.

===Terrorism and Safety===
In the 21st century, Christmas markets in Western Europe were repeatedly the targets of terror attacks, with completed or thwarted attacks occurring in Dijon, Nantes, Berlin, Potsdam, Vienna, Strasbourg, and Magdeburg. Christmas markets increasingly have security procedures such as bollards, uniformed and plainclothes police officers, and surveillance to protect visitors.

==Attractions and stalls==
Popular attractions at the markets include the Nativity Scene (a crèche or crib), &quot;Zwetschgenmännle&quot; (figures made of decorated dried plums), &quot;Nussknacker&quot; (carved Nutcrackers), &quot;Gebrannte Mandeln&quot; (candied, toasted almonds), traditional Christmas cookies such as &quot;Lebkuchen&quot; and &quot;Magenbrot&quot; (both forms of soft gingerbread), Bratwurst, and &quot;Glühwein&quot;, hot mulled wine (with or without a shot of brandy), or &quot;Eierpunsch&quot; (an egg-based warm alcoholic drink) - both a highlight of the market for many visitors. Both help stave off the cold winter air which sometimes dips below freezing. More regional food specialties include &quot;Christstollen&quot; (&quot;Stollen&quot;), a sort of bread with candied fruit in Saxony, and hot Apfelwein and &quot;Frankfurter Bethmännchen&quot; in Hesse.

==Major Christmas markets==
===Austria===
Christmas markets are popular traditions in Austria, and are held in Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Linz, and Graz. The first &quot;December Market&quot; was held in Vienna in 1298. Vienna holds 20 different Christmas markets around the city. Most Christmas markets open in late November and last through December, closing between Christmas Day and New Year&#x27;s Day, with a few staying open for New Year&#x27;s.

The largest Christmas market and one of the most well known is the Vienna Christmas World on Rathausplatz, near the &quot;Rathaus&quot;, Vienna&#x27;s historic city hall. The market draws 3 million people each year and includes 150 unique stalls that offer traditional Austrian foods, Christmas decorations and ornaments, handicrafts, and drinks. The Vienna Christmas World on Rathausplatz also features an advent theme park called the &quot;Adventzauber&quot; with workshops and cultural performances that cater to families and young children. Visitors to the Vienna Christmas World can also ice skate on a ice rink and on frozen paths that run through the Rathausplatz Park.

Other famous Christmas markets include the Christmas Market at Schönbrunn Palace, the Art Advent on Karlsplatz, the Christmas Village at Belvedere Palace, and the Christmas Village on Maria-Theresien-Platz. The Christmas Market at Schönbrunn Palace, “&quot;Kultur-und-Weihnachtsmarkt&quot;,” takes place in front of the imperial palace. It features Austrian handicrafts and goods as well as a cultural program with activities and workshops. The Art Advent on Karlsplatz offers artisan goods, a children&#x27;s program, and a petting zoo. Popular food specialities include &quot;Kinderpunsch&quot; (a non-alcoholic punch), &quot;Glühwein&quot;, &quot;Baumstriezel&quot; (a Hungarian pastry coated in cinnamon and sugar), &quot;Kartoffelpuffer&quot; (potato pancakes), &quot;Lángos&quot; (savory deep fried dough), &quot;Schaumkuss&quot; (chocolate covered marshmallows), &quot;Stollen&quot; (bread with candied fruit), &quot;Maroni&quot; (roasted chestnuts), &quot;Bratkartoffel&quot; (roasted potato wedges), &quot;Lebkuchen&quot; (Austrian gingerbread), and baked potatoes.

===France===
Christmas markets are traditional in Alsace, France, and most of the towns there have their local Christmas market. Strasbourg has been holding a Christmas market, &quot;Christkindelsmärik,&quot; around its cathedral since 1570, when the city was part of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.

===Germany===
Famous Christmas markets are held in the cities of Augsburg, Dresden, Erfurt, Frankfurt, Nuremberg, and Stuttgart, making them popular tourist attractions during the Christmas holiday season. The Nuremberg and Dresden markets draw about two million people each year; the Stuttgart and Frankfurt markets attract more than three million visitors.

The two most visited Christmas markets in Germany are found in Dortmund, with more than three and a half million visitors of 300 stalls around a gigantic Christmas tree that stands tall, and in Cologne with 4 million people. Additionally, Berlin claims more than 70 markets, which open in late November and close just after Christmas.

===Italy===
Christmas in Italy begins on 8 December with the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the day on which traditionally Christmas trees are erected, and ends on 6 January of the following year with Epiphany.

In Italy, the oldest Christmas market is considered to be that of Bologna, held for the first time in the 18th century and linked to the feast of Saint Lucia. The tradition of the markets has however spread in Italy predominantly especially since the 1990s, with the birth of the first modern markets: among these, the first ever was that of Bolzano, born in 1991, which was followed by others in the area of Alto Adige, in particular in Merano, Bressanone, Vipiteno and Brunico.

The Trento Christmas market, established in 1993, is renowned in Trentino. In Naples, where the tradition of the Neapolitan nativity scene has been famous for centuries, the exhibition of the nativity scenes made in the city&#x27;s artisan shops is held every year in via San Gregorio Armeno. Noteworthy are the Christmas markets at Piazza Navona in Rome, in Verona, in Gubbio, in Alberobello, in Aosta, in Torino, in Asti, in Arezzo, in Florence, in Trieste, in Livigno, in Santa Maria Maggiore, Arco and in Cison di Valmarino.

===United Kingdom===

In 1982, Lincoln, England, established an annual Christmas market in early December. This remains one of the most extensive such market by area in the United Kingdom, with a claimed total of over 300 stalls attracting more than 100,000 visitors over its four days. Starting in 1997, &quot;Frankfurt Christmas Markets&quot; were established with support from Frankfurt in Birmingham, Edinburgh, Leeds, and Manchester. Other large Christmas markets have been held in England in Bath (since 2000) and Liverpool (since 2006). The Christmas markets are such a success that they are becoming a major pull factor to increase trade and visitor numbers to towns and cities.

Birmingham&#x27;s Christmas Market, primarily located on New Street between the Bullring shopping centre and the Council House, is the &quot;largest outdoor Christmas market in the UK&quot; as well as the &quot;largest authentic German Christmas market outside of Germany or Austria&quot;. The market also offers live entertainment on the main stage. The market is held for approximately six weeks every year and usually closes around 23 December. Manchester&#x27;s Christmas Markets have also been successful, with 300 stalls over eight city locations, with each location being themed to create a different atmosphere such as French, World, and German, with European-themed stalls on the Albert Square, Manchester proving to be the most popular.

===United States===
German immigrants carried Christmas market celebrations to the United States. It is celebrated in such cities as Chicago, Denver, Salt Lake City, Tulsa, and Grand Rapids.

===Other countries===
As noted, other countries have also established such markets. The Christmas market of Barcelona starts on 13 December, Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day, and is called &quot;Fira de Santa Llúcia&quot;. It has been held in the square of Barcelona Cathedral since 1786.

The &quot;GUM-fair&quot; was opened on the Red Square in Moscow, Russia in 2013. It&#x27;s been running ever since from December to the end of October and is the biggest and most popular christmas market in Russia.

A traditional Christmas market was held for the first time in Sibiu, Romania, in 2007.

<text>Fora, LLC () is a Ukrainian national retail company that operates a chain of stores Fora (also called supermarket) and premium delicacy store Favore, operated by Fozzy Group. Its headquarters are located at Fozzy Fud in neighbourhood Lisky of the Dniprovskyi District, Kyiv. Company was founded by Volodymyr Kostelman in December 2002. Most of its stores are concentrated in the Kyiv metropolitan area. The stores are partially automated, with customers able to purchase products without being checked out by a cashier using a self-service checkout.

==History==

In 2002, the owners of Silpo, having bought shares from the labor collective, acquired a chain of 38 &quot;Dnipryanka&quot; delis. This made it possible not only to expand the Silpo chain, but also to make room for new Fora stores — a chain that began its operations in December of the same year.

In 2005, Fora had 34 stores.

In 2006, chain of stores near the home Fora had 70 stores across Ukraine.

In the autumn of 2007, the Fozzy Group entered into an agreement with the company &quot;BM-Trade&quot; which received in 2006 of about $48 million revenue, which was 60% owned of the largest distributors of food products in the Baltic states — Sanitex, the rest — to individuals, citizens of Lithuania. Under the terms of the agreement, Bumi-market stores, which existed at that time 40 retail outlets in the &quot;store at home&quot; format with a total sales area of 15,600 m2 in the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Zhytomyr regions, will become part of the Fora retail chain, and until at the end of 2008, they will operate as part of the chain under its sign. The deal was closed on October 18. The amount of the deal was not disclosed, but in the message published the day before, Ukrsibbank stated that the bank acted as a co-underwriter of the placement Fora bonds sold for ₴200 million, which will be directed to &quot;the purchase of a similar retail chain&quot;. Experts believe that Fozzy Group overpaid for the purchase of the chain. Dragon Capital analyst Tamara Levchenko estimated Bumi-market at $30–35 million.

In March 2008, Fozzy Group announced that it plans to open 15 stores Fora by the end of the year, and due to the crisis, from the statement published in September of the same year, it became known that only 8 stores Fora are planned to be opened by the end of the current year. However, during the year, the chain still updated several stores according to the new concept. During 2008, were opened 16 stores Fora.

From July 25, 2011, to July 24, 2012, Fora issued 120 thousand registered, interest-bearing, guaranteed bonds with a nominal value of ₴1,000 for ₴120 million at 14% for 3 years for additional financing of programs and development Fora chain store.

In 2012, Fora had 66 stores.

In 2014, Fozzy Group opened 25 new stores Fora.

In the first half of 2015, Fozzy Group opened 15 new stores Fora.

It was also announced that the service will be launched across the chain in the near future. In August of the same year, two years after the opening of the chain&#x27;s largest supermarket in the Kyiv region, it was announced the opening of a new store in Vyshneve, the total area of which reaches 1,500 m2, which is twice the size of the store that opened in 2017. Later that month, it became known that Fora had released an original mobile application, which, among other things, allows contactless payment for purchases using a QR code, which the cashier must scan from the visitor&#x27;s smartphone display. This was achieved thanks to the integration of the Masterpass digital wallet platform into the mobile application, which allows you to pre-save payment cards and conduct transactions if there is a sufficient Internet limit on the card, even without an Internet connection. In 2019, the chain was replenished with 17 new stores, by the end of the year it had 248 stores. The income of the chain in 2019 amounted to ₴14.3 billion.

<doc id="1340667" wikidata="Q7842825" url="?curid=1340667" title="Trinity Hall Boat Club">
<text>Trinity Hall Boat Club (THBC) is the rowing club of Trinity Hall, a college of the University of Cambridge. Founded in 1827 it is amongst the oldest college boat clubs in Cambridge, England. Historically, it is the most successful Cambridge college at Henley Royal Regatta with a number of victories, including winning all the events but one in 1887.

The club has produced numerous rowers for the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race and various national teams, including Tom James, who stroked the 8+ from Great Britain to the B-final in the 2004 Olympics in Athens and won gold with the 4- at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.

The club colours are black and white, its nickname is &quot;Black and White army&quot;, its motto &quot;Our power&#x27;s a crescent&quot; (the college crest showing a crescent ermine; the motto used to be &quot;Our powers are crescent&quot; taking the old meaning for crescent meaning growing – i.e. a crescent moon is a waxing moon), and its supporters shout &quot;Row Hall&quot; to encourage the rowers. Unlike other boat clubs, whose scarves are derived from their college scarves, its scarf is made in a black and white tartan.

THBC has a senior rowers&#x27; (alumni) club called &quot;The Black and White Society&quot;.

==History==
The college first boats, both men and women, have been Head of the Lent and May Bumps on numerous occasions in the history of the races, dominating the Mays in the 1890s and both events in the early 1990s.

From 1890 until 1898, Trinity Hall stayed Head of the Mays for 33 consecutive days, which remains to this day the longest continuous defence by a single club of the bumps headship since the Lent and May Bumps became separate events.

Trinity Hall were eventually deposed from the top spot in 1898 by First Trinity, who held the headship for 10 days, then Third Trinity who held the headship for a further 24 days, then again by First Trinity for 2 more days, meaning that boats from Trinity College held the headship for 36 consecutive days, but until the 1940s, Trinity maintained more than one boatclub.

<text>Ludwig Karl August von Hagemeister (; Leontij Andrianovic Gagemejster; ) was a Russian naval officer who held the rank of Captain of the 1st rank in the Imperial Russian Navy. He was a maritime explorer of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean, and served briefly in 1817-1818 as the second Chief Manager of the Russian-American Company.

== Career in the Navy ==
Hagemeister was born to an ethnic Baltic German family in the Russian Empire. He began his service in the Russian naval forces in 1795 as a volunteer midshipman. Along with a group of fellow junior servicemen, he joined the British Royal Navy in 1802 on board .

In 1806 he was directed to take with provisions needed to Russian America; this was the first of three circumnavigations in his career to New Archangel. Departing on 20 October 1806 from Kronstadt, &quot;Neva&quot; began to cross the Atlantic Ocean to the south, to go around the continent of Africa and sail East. After passing the Cape of Good Hope, Hagemeister and his subordinates were the first Russian crew to visit the Australian mainland, reaching the port of Port Jackson on 4 June.

Reaching New Archangel (now Sitka, Alaska) on 13 September, Hagemeister was stationed on Kodiak Island for most of 1808. The Russian forces were at war with the Tlingit. He was ordered by Chief Manager of the Russian American Company (RAC), Aleksandr Baranov, to secure needed provisions from the Kingdom of Hawaii on 30 November 1808 and perhaps find a suitable location for a Russian colony there. Hagemeister explored portions of the North Pacific and met with King Kamehameha I in early 1809. Amicable conversations were commenced with the monarch and Hagemeister purchased a cargo of salt. Delivering the salt to New Archangel, he later departed for Saint Petersburg in 1810 on &quot;Neva&quot;.

Hagemeister reached Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on 28 May and began the overland trek through Siberia. His circumnavigation was recognized by Russian authorities at St. Petersburg, as he was promoted to captain lieutenant and awarded the Order of St. Vladimir 4th class. He served as chairman of the Admiralty of Irkutsk from 1812 to 1815, in which capacity Hagemeister was responsible for building the first ships to cross Lake Baikal.

Vasily Golovnin encouraged him to plan another journey to New Archangel, and worked for his appointment to an RAC ship. Besides delivering more needed provisions, Hagemeister was ordered to investigate Baranov&#x27;s financial management of the company and deputed to replace him as Chief Manager if he felt it necessary. Baranov, then 70, had requested relief from his position for years in order to return to Russia. Commanding the &quot;Kutuzov&quot;, Hagemeister started his second circumnavigation in 1816. Hagemeister arrived at New Archangel during 1817, with his second-in-command, Semyon Yanovsky.

Before examining Baranov&#x27;s financial records, Hagemeister traveled to northern California to formalize relations with the Kashia Pomo people. He was the principal negotiator with leaders of the local Pomo band, and obtained the privilege to establish Fort Ross. The parties signed a treaty on 22 September 1817, with tribal officials reported to have said that &quot;They are very pleased to see Russians occupy this land, for they now live in safety from other Indians who used to attack them from time to time. This security began only from the time of Russian settlement.&quot; The agreement was made by RAC officials as a part of a scheme to take over Alta California from the Spanish Empire.

Returning to New Archangel, Hagemeister and other naval officers spent the winter examining the financial records of the RAC. Sources disagree on what was found: Khlebnikov says that the records showed no evidence of malfeasance. Borneman says that they found a discrepancy in the amount of supplies listed in accounting records. On 11 January 1818 Baranov was, &quot;in a most arrogant way&quot;, removed by Hagemeister from office.

Hagemeister took over, changing the methods of payment to the &quot;promyslenniki&quot; workers, by giving currency for salaries and abandoning the share system in favor of provisions. He worked to improve relations with the Hawaiian Kingdom, as they had been damaged from the Schäffer affair. Hagemeister outlawed trade by non-RAC Europeans, a policy later adopted by the Russian government. This policy was contained in the Ukase of 1821, a decree from the Imperial Government that extended Russian land claims to northern California and banned all non-Russian European merchants from the area.

Hagemeister appointed his direct second-in-command, Semyon Ivanovich Yanovsky, as the next Chief Manager. In late October 1818, Hagemeister and Baranov departed from New Archangel; the latter was pleased to be at last returning to Russia. But Baranov died in 1819, while they were still at sea, and was buried at sea. In 1820 Yanovsky was replaced by another naval officer, chosen directly by the Board of the RAC.

In 1828–1829, Hagemeister made his final circumnavigation on the ship &quot;Krotky&quot;. During this journey, he surveyed the Menshikov Atoll (Kwajalein) in the Marshall Islands, plotting it on the map and specifying the location of some other islands. His diaries are composed in several European languages, including German, Russian, French, Portuguese, English and Spanish.

<text>Võros (Võro: &quot;võrokõsõq,&quot; pronounced , , ) are the indigenous inhabitants of historical Võromaa (&quot;Vana Võromaa&quot;), a region in Southeastern Estonia (Võru and Põlva Counties with parts extending into Valga and Tartu Counties). The term is particularly used by proponents of a regional identity.

About 70,000 people live in historical Võromaa and many more identify as Võros although they live outside the territory, mostly in Tartu and Tallinn.

<text>Jules-Benoît Stanislas Doinel du Val-Michel (8 December 1842 in Moulins, Allier – 16 or 17 March 1903), also known simply as Jules Doinel or Tau Valentin II was an archivist and the founder of the first Gnostic church in modern times who claims, that he was consecrated into a new episcopal lineage in a dream by the &quot;Eon Jesus&quot;.

==Gnostic Church revival==
After spiritual experiences in 1888–89, he proclaimed 1890 the beginning of &quot;the era of Gnosis restored&quot;, Doinel assumed the office of Patriarch of the &quot;Église Gnostique&quot; (French: &quot;Gnostic Church&quot;), taking the ecclesiastical name of Tau Valentin II, after Valentinius, the 2nd century Christian Gnostic teacher.

The doctrinal orientation of the church was based on extant Cathar documents, with the Gospel of John, and a strong influence of Simonian and Valentinian cosmology. The church was officially established in autumn 1890 in Paris, France. Liturgical services were based on Cathar rituals. Clergy were both male and female, having male bishops and female &quot;sophias&quot;.

Doinel was &quot;spiritually consecrated&quot; in a spiritual experience in 1888 and not into a line of apostolic succession. Doinel subsequently consecrated a number of bishops for the &quot;Église Gnostique&quot;, notably Gérard Encausse, founder of the closely allied Martinist Order.

==Anti-masonic period (1895–1897)==
In 1895, Doinel resigned from the &quot;Église Gnostique&quot;, leaving the leadership of the church to a council of bishops. He then converted to Roman Catholicism and began a collaboration with Léo Taxil, being one of many taken in by Taxil&#x27;s anti-masonic hoax. Under the name Jean Kostka, Doinel wrote a book attacking freemasonry, entitled &quot;Lucifer Unmasked&quot;, in which he associated many of his prior activities with the diabolic. A. E. Waite described &quot;Lucifer Unmasked&quot; and revealed the real identity of its author in &quot;Devil Worship in France&quot;, his exposé of the anti-masonic movement that Taxil inspired. Taxil unveiled his hoax in 1897.

==Reconciliation==
Doinel was readmitted as a bishop in the &quot;Église Gnostique&quot; in 1900.

<doc id="1340697" wikidata="Q3870428" url="?curid=1340697" title="Narembeen, Western Australia">
<text>Narembeen is a town in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. It is 286 km, almost due east, from Perth, the capital of WA. It is the major settlement in the Shire of Narembeen, in which the major industries are growing cereal crops and raising cattle and sheep. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling.

Narembeen means &quot;place of female emus&quot; in the local Aboriginal language.

==History==
The area was initially surveyed in 1836 by the Surveyor General John Septimus Roe. After camping on a rocky outcrop and seeing a group of emus he named the area Emu Hill. By the 1850s, European settlers arrived in the area looking for pastoral land for wheat and grazing. Sandalwood cutters also frequented the area during this time.

In 1901 the rabbit proof fence was constructed just to the east of Narembeen, and can still be seen today.

A settler named Charles Smith bought a property he called Narimbeen. By the 1900s more farmers moved to the area as land was opened up, and by 1918 the town-site of Emu Hill was gazetted.

In 1920, the town-site of Narembeen only existed as a minor siding to the railway line that had only just been built to Emu Hill.

By the 1920s Emu Hill was the largest community in the region but the local populace opposed the building of a hotel in the town.

As a result of this a Perth lawyer, Henry Dale and a publican, Paddy Conlon, purchased of land at the railway siding of Narembeen to build a hotel.
The town of Narembeen was established in 1922 about 5 km from the Emu Hill town-site. The location of Narembeen was not the best choice as it is prone to flooding.
In 1924, there were rumours that gold had been discovered close to the rabbit proof fence and the town of Holleton was established about 50 km from Narembeen, but Narembeen prospered as it was the closest train station to Holleton and offered a motor transport service to the miners.

Narembeen had a population of 2,100 by 1925 and Emu Hill was no more.

In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding.

In 1968 the town of Narembeen was officially declared.

<text>Tel Aviv Museum of Art ( &quot;Muzeon Tel Aviv Leomanut&quot;) is an art museum in Tel Aviv, Israel. The museum is dedicated to the preservation and display of modern and contemporary art from Israel and around the world.

==History==

The Tel Aviv Museum of Art was established in 1932 in a building at 16 Rothschild Boulevard that was the former home of Tel Aviv&#x27;s first mayor, Meir Dizengoff, who had donated the property for a museum in memory of his wife, Zina, following her death in 1930. On 14 May 1948, 250 delegates quietly gathered at the museum for the historic signing of the Israeli Declaration of Independence. In 1971, the building became Independence Hall when the museum relocated to 27 Shaul Hamelech Boulevard.

Curator Nehama Guralnik began working at the museum in 1971, when French was the common language among staff, including the director, administrators and the curators, and catalogues were printed in French and in Hebrew, with English introduced later that decade. Guralnik curated more than 40 exhibitions during her 34-year tenure as international art curator.

The Helena Rubinstein Pavilion for Contemporary Art opened in 1959. Planning for a new building began in 1963 when the museum&#x27;s collections of modern and contemporary art began to outgrow the premises. Construction commenced in 1966 but stopped for two years due to shortage of funds, before moving to its current location in 1971.

Another wing was added in 1999 and the Lola Beer Ebner Sculpture Garden was established. The museum also contains &quot;The Joseph and Rebecca Meyerhoff Art Education Center&quot;, opened in 1988. The museum houses a comprehensive collection of classical and contemporary art, especially Israeli art, a sculpture garden and a youth wing.

Suzanne Landau, following 34 years at the Israel Museum, was appointed director and chief curator of the museum in 2012.

In 2018, the museum set an all-time attendance record with 1,018,323 visitors, ranking 70th on the list of most visited art museums. In 2019, the museum set a new attendance record, ranking 49th with 1,322,439 visitors. In 2022, it again ranked 49th, with 1,070,714 visitors. In 2023, it was ranked 48th on &quot;The Art Magazine&quot;″s list of the 100 most popular museums in the world.

On 23 March 2023, Tel Aviv Museum of Art was partially closed, in participation with Israel&#x27;s &quot;day of paralysis&quot; during the 2023 Israeli judicial reform protests. Following the 7 October attacks and subsequent incidents related to the Israel-Hamas War, the Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present) and the 2024 Iran–Israel conflict, the museum removed several items on its collection from display and stored them for safekeeping in a secured basement. It also moved other exhibitions to a protected space on the facility&#x27;s lower levels.

==Permanent collection==
The Museum&#x27;s collection represents some of the leading artists of the first half of the 20th century and many of the major movements of modern art in this period: Fauvism, German Expressionism, Cubism, Futurism, Russian Constructivism, the De Stijl movement and Surrealism, French art, from the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists to the School of Paris including works of Chaïm Soutine, key works by Pablo Picasso from the Blue and Neo-Classical period to his Late Period, Cubist paintings by Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, several sculptures by Jacques Lipchitz, and Surrealists works of Joan Miró.

One section of the Museum displays the history of Israeli art and its origins among local artists in the pre-state Zionist community of the early twentieth century.

In 1989, the American pop artist Roy Lichtenstein created a giant two-panel mural especially for the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. It hangs in the entrance foyer.

The Collection includes several masterpieces, among them the painting &quot;Friedericke Maria Beer&quot;, 1916 by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt and &quot;Untitled Improvisation V&quot;, 1914, by the Russian master Wassily Kandinsky.

The Peggy Guggenheim Collection, donated in 1950, includes 36 works by Abstract and Surrealist artists, including works of Jackson Pollock, William Baziotes, and Richard Pousette-Dart, and Surrealists works by Yves Tanguy, Roberto Matta, and André Masson.Sculptures are displayed in the entrance plaza and in an internal sculpture garden.
In addition to a permanent collection, the museum hosts temporary exhibitions of individual artists&#x27; work and group shows curated around a common theme.

==Buildings of Tel Aviv Museum of Art (21st century)==
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art includes The Paulson Family Foundation Building, its main structure on Shaul Hamelech Boulevard; the Herta and Paul Amir Building; and the Eyal Ofer Pavilion.

===Paulson Family Foundation Building===
Marking its 90th anniversary, the museum&#x27;s main building was refurbished and renamed The Paulson Family Foundation Building in 2021, in honour of its benefactors.

===Herta and Paul Amir Building===

In November 2011, the Herta and Paul Amir Building on the western side of the museum opened. It houses an Israeli Architecture Archive, and a new section of Photography and Visual arts. The new building was designed by architect Preston Scott Cohen. The new wing houses 18,500 square feet of gallery space over five floors.

The Amir building also contains Pastel, a fine dining restaurant led by Chef Hilel Tavakuli.

===Eyal Ofer Pavilion===
In May 2023, following an extensive renovation of the Helena Rubinstein Pavilion for Contemporary Art, it was reopened as the Eyal Ofer Pavilion, in honour of its contemporary benefactor, with the first retrospective of the works of Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti in Israel exhibited on all four levels. The renovation was led by architect Amnon Rechter, whose father, Israel Prize laureate architect Yaakov Rechter, built the original pavilion in 1959.

<doc id="1340719" wikidata="Q898776" url="?curid=1340719" title="Particle board">
<text>Particle board, also known as particleboard or chipboard, is an engineered wood product, belonging to the wood-based panels, manufactured from wood chips and a synthetic, mostly formaldehyde-based resin or other suitable binder, which is pressed under a hot press, batch- or continuous- type, and produced. Particle board is often confused with oriented strand board (OSB, also known as flakeboard, or waferboard), a different type of fiberboard that uses machined wood flakes and offers more strength.

== Characteristics ==

Particle board is cheaper, denser, and more uniform than conventional wood and plywood and is substituted for them when cost is more important than strength and appearance. Particleboard can be made more appealing by painting or the use of wood veneers on visible surfaces. Though it is denser than conventional wood, it is the lightest and weakest type of fiberboard, except for insulation board. Medium-density fibreboard and hardboard, also called high-density fiberboard, are stronger and denser than particleboard. Different grades of particleboard have different densities, with higher density connoting greater strength and greater resistance to failure of screw fasteners.

A significant disadvantage of particleboard is its susceptibility to expansion and discoloration from moisture absorption, particularly when it is not covered with paint or another sealer. Therefore, it is rarely used outdoors or in places where there are high levels of moisture, except in bathrooms, kitchens and laundries, where it is commonly used as an underlayment shielded beneath a moisture-resistant continuous sheet of vinyl flooring.

In dry environments, veneered particleboard is preferred over veneered plywood because of its stability, lower cost, and convenience.

== History and development ==
The history of particleboard is unclear. The nineteenth century saw many attempts to make use of sawmill by-products, including sawdust and wood chips, by manufacturing composite boards; conceptual references to processes of manufacturing wood composites similar to particleboard date from 1887. In 1935, Farley and Loetscher Manufacturing Co. became the first plant to manufacture particleboard. A particleboard industry developed over the course of the 1940s.

In 1932, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; pilot and inventor Max Himmelheber patented a process for making particleboard without fully impregnating wood fibers with adhesive, distinguishing it from earlier wood composites. This particleboard could be produced with waste products such as planer shavings, off-cuts, or sawdust, hammer-milled into chips and bound together with a phenolic resin. Hammer-milling involves smashing material into smaller and smaller pieces until they can pass through a screen. Most early particleboard manufacturers used similar processes, though often with slightly different resins. 

It was found that better strength, appearance, and resin economy could be achieved by using more uniform, manufactured chips. Producers began processing solid birch, beech, alder, pine, and spruce into consistent chips and flakes; these finer layers were then placed on the outside of the board, with its core composed of coarser, cheaper chips. This type of board is known as three-layer particleboard.

More recently, graded-density particleboard has also evolved. It contains particles that gradually become smaller as they get closer to the surface.

== Manufacturing ==
Particleboard or chipboard is manufactured by mixing particles or flakes of wood or jute-stick together with a resin and forming the mixture into a sheet. The raw material is fed into a disc chipper with between four and sixteen radially arranged blades. The chips from disk chippers are more uniform in shape and size than from other types of wood chippers. The particles are then dried, and any oversize or undersized particles are screened out.

Resin is then sprayed as a fine mist onto the particles. Several types of resins are used in the process. Amino-formaldehyde-based resins are the best-performing based on cost and ease of use. Urea melamine resins offer water resistance, with more melamine offering higher resistance. It is typically used in external applications, with the coloured resin darkening the panel. To further enhance the panel properties, resorcinol resins can be mixed with phenolic resins, but that is more often used with marine plywood applications.

Panel production involves other chemicals including wax, dyes, wetting agents, and release agents, to aid processing or make the final product resistant to water, fire, or insects.

After the particles pass through a mist of resin sufficient to coat all surfaces, they are layered into a continuous &quot;carpet&quot;. This carpet is then separated into discrete, rectangular &quot;blankets&quot; which will be compacted in a cold press. A scale weighs the flakes, and they are distributed by rotating rakes. In graded-density particleboard, the flakes are spread by an air jet that throws finer particles further than coarse ones. Two such jets, reversed, allow the particles to build up from fine to coarse and back to fine.

The formed sheets are cold-compressed to reduce thickness and make them easier to transport. Later, they are compressed again, under pressures between and temperatures between to set and harden the glue. The entire process is controlled to ensure the correct size, density, and consistency of the board.

The boards are then cooled, trimmed, and sanded. They can then be sold as raw board or surface-improved through the addition of a wood veneer or laminate surface.

== Furniture design ==

Particle board has had a huge influence on furniture design. In the early 1950s, particle-board kitchens started to come into use in furniture construction but, in many cases, it remained more expensive than solid wood. A particle-board kitchen was only available to the very wealthy. Once the technology was more developed, particle board became cheaper.

Some large companies base their strategies around providing furniture at a low price. To do this, they use the least expensive materials possible. In almost all cases, this means particle board, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), or the like. However, in order to maintain a reputation for quality at low cost, manufacturers may use higher grades of particle board, e.g., higher-density particle board, thicker particle board, or particle board using higher-quality resins. One may note the amount of sag in a shelf of a given width in order to draw the distinction.

In general, the much lower cost of sheet goods (particle board, medium density fiberboard, and other engineered wood products) has helped to displace solid wood from many cabinetry applications.

== Safety ==
Safety concerns exist for both manufacturing and use. Fine dust and chemicals are released when particleboard is machined (e.g., sawing or routing). Occupational exposure limits exist in many countries recognizing the hazard of wood dusts. Cutting particle board can release formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide in the case of amino resins, and phenol in the case of phenol formaldehyde resins.

The other safety concern is the slow release of formaldehyde over time. In 1984, concerns about the high indoor levels of formaldehyde in new manufactured homes led the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to set construction standards. Particleboard (PB), medium-density fibreboard (MDF), oriented strand board (OSB), and laminated flooring have been major sources of formaldehyde emissions. In response to consumer and woodworker pressure on the industry, PB and MDF became available in &quot;no added formaldehyde&quot; (NAF) versions, but were not in common use . Many other building materials such as furniture finish, carpeting, and caulking give off formaldehyde, as well as urea-formaldehyde foam insulation, which is banned in Canada for installation in a residential closed-cavity wall. Formaldehyde is classified by the WHO as a known human carcinogen.

<text>The Central Economic Society for the Grand Duchy of Poznań () was a social-economic organization of Polish landowners in the Greater Poland region (at this time called the Grand Duchy of Poznań) established at a meeting held 13–17 February 1861 as a result of a merger of several local societies.

Its main goal was to promote modern agricultural methods by organizing meetings, speeches, debates, excursions and competitions and also publishing the newspapers and magazines. Its main publication was &quot;Ziemianin&quot; (The Landowner). Its secondary activities were trade of amazing agricultural products and organizations of the agricultural labour force.

The society was managed by the Chairman (&quot;Przewodniczący&quot;) and the Central Board (&quot;Zarząd Centralny&quot;), whose main role was to coordinate the work of the central sections and the branch societies with their own managing boards. The society and its 14 branches had 800 members (as of 1914).

==Chairmen==

* Hipolit Cegielski
* Włodzimierz Wolniewicz
* Henryk Szuman
* Zygmunt Szułdrzyński
* Stanisław Żółtowski
* Tadeusz Jackowski

<text>François Antoine de Legall de Kermeur (1702–1792) was a French chess player, and was possibly the world&#x27;s best player from about 1730 to 1755.

His name is variously written &quot;Kermur, Sire de Legalle&quot;, by Twiss, and &quot;Kermur&quot; and &quot;Kermuy, Sire de Legal&quot;, by others. In the List of Subscribers to Philidor&#x27;s second edition it stands as in Twiss, but the spelling was, probably, in both cases Philidor&#x27;s own.

Along with other famous players, he played in Paris&#x27;s Café de la Régence, and is considered to have been possibly the strongest player in the world around the 1730s. He taught chess to François-André Philidor.

The following portrayal of Legall is given in the &quot;London Magazine&quot;, May 1825, in an article titled &quot;Chess and Chess Players by an ancient Amateur&quot;:

I am probably, without any exception, the oldest chess-player in Europe. I have not only had the honour of contending &quot;on the checquer&#x27;d field&quot; with M. Philidor, but I have frequently played at the Cafe de la Regence with M. de Legalle, the master of that distinguished Professor, who, in my younger days, was a better player than his celebrated pupil. There is no man of whose person and deportment I retain a more vivid recollection than M. de Legalle; he was a thin, pale old gentleman, who had sat in the same seat at the Cafe, and worn the same green coat for a great number of years when I first visited Paris. While he played at chess, he took snuffs in such profusion that his chitterling frill was literally saturated with stray particles of the powder, and he was, moreover, in the habit of enlivening the company during the progress of the game, by a variety of remarks, which every body admired for their brilliancy, and which struck me perhaps the more forcibly, as I was at that time but indifferently acquainted with the French tongue.
In the book &quot;The life of Philidor&quot;, the following considerations, which can give us an idea about de Legall&#x27;s strength at the chessboard are reported:

M. de Kermur, Sire de Legal, at that time about forty years old, reigned supreme in that famous Cafe, and was undoubtedly a player of extraordinary strength; for Philidor alone was ever able to beat him, and that, too, not until he had developed his entire force by playing with Sir Abraham Janssen and the Syrian Stamma(*). The &quot;first player of the band&quot; found it necessary to accept the Rook from M. de Legal; and it took full three years to work his way up, through the various degrees of odds, to the honour of confronting his master, on even terms, as a &quot;first-rate&quot;.
(*) Fetis says that old chess-players at the Cafe de la Regence had repeated to him Philidor&#x27;s own statement, that he did not attain his full strength until he had made his campaigns in Holland and in England.
Thus, Legal was probably the strongest player of the &quot;Café de la Régence&quot; and probably in the world until 1755 when he lost a match to Philidor. It is not known if he traveled or played in other countries besides France, but since the &quot;Café de la Régence&quot; was the chess Mecca of the time, most of the strongest players of the 18th century, sooner or later, ended up at the &quot;Café&quot; and the strongest among them played Legal.

It is known that he played with Sir Abraham Janssen, the strongest English player according to Philidor himself. G. Allen refers that Legal was of the same opinion of Philidor regarding the skills of Janssen over the board. This could indicate that, at even terms, Janssen won approximately only one fourth of the games played with Legal as he did with Philidor, but this is not completely clear from Allen&#x27;s text if this interpretation is correct. The chess encounter between Legal and Janssen happened, according to aforementioned author, after the match between Philidor and Janssen and, thus, must be collocated after 1747.

It is also very likely, as also suggested by Allen, that Legall played Stamma, since the latter lived for a certain period in Paris where he published the &quot;Essai sur le jeu des echecs&quot; in 1737. If this is correct, Legal would have played Stamma before Philidor began to attend the &quot;Café de la Régence&quot;.

Legal lived to nearly ninety years old. After his defeat with Philidor in the match of 1755 and up to the time of his death, however, he maintained his rank as the second player of France. Thus, it is also highly probable that he played, with an overall favourable outcome, against the disciples of Philidor of the &quot;Société des Amateurs&quot; (Bernard, Carlier, Leger and Verdoni).

Legall is the eponym of Legall&#x27;s mate, a mating pattern found in his only extant game, Legall–Saint Brie, Paris, 1750.

<text>The Haifa Museum of Art (, ), established in 1951, is located in a historic building built in the 1930s in Wadi Nisnas, downtown Haifa. Ranking as Israel&#x27;s third largest art museum, the museum focuses on Israeli and international contemporary art, and its collection includes 7,000 items, mostly of contemporary Israeli art.

== History ==
The Haifa Museum of Art was founded in 1951 in Haifa for a large exhibition of Marc Chagall. The museum was moved to it current stone building in Wadi Nisnas in 1977.

== Building ==
The building was built in the late 1920s and was inaugurated in the early 1930s as an Anglican school for girls. After the establishment of the State of Israel, it served as an immigrant center and from the early 1950s it hosted the private high school called the &quot;High School for the Children of Workers&quot;, which was run by a teachers&#x27; cooperative and belonged to the Workers Movement. At the end of the 1960s, a branch of the Histadrut &quot;Mishlav&quot; school, which was preparing adult students for matriculation exams, began operating in the afternoon. In 1978 the site was opened to the public as a municipal museum, after extensive renovation designed to prepare exhibition spaces and galleries.

== Permanent collection ==
The permanent collection includes works of Joseph Zaritsky, Mordechai Ardon, Lea Nikel, Raffi Lavie, Moshe Gershuni, Michal Na&#x27;aman, Pinchas Cohen Gan, Tsibi Geva, Yechiel Shemi, Yitzhak Danziger, David Adika, Igor Zeiger, Ranan Lurie, Marc Chagall, Honoré Daumier, Odilon Redon, Chana Orloff and André Masson.

==Gallery==
== Haifa Museums conglomerate ==
Other institutions under the auspices of the Haifa Museums include the Mané Katz Museum dedicated to paintings from the School of Paris and Jewish artifacts; and the City Museum of Haifan History, located in the Germany Colony. The Museum of Ancient Art, housed in the university of Haifa, which specializes in archaeological finds discovered in Israel and the Mediterranean basin, was inaugurated in 1984.

Also under the museum&#x27;s aegis are the Museum of Prehistory, the Israeli National Maritime Museum, the Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art and latest addition is Hermann Struck Museum, opened in 2013.

== Controversies ==
=== Ronald McDonald ===
After the museum exhibited a sculpture of Ronald McDonald titled &#x27;McJesus,&#x27;
Haifa&#x27;s Arab Christian community protested and tried to enter the museum to remove it. The museum was firebombed twice between 10 and 11 January while local Christians threw stones at the police outside the museum and injured three officers.

<text>James Beeland Rogers Jr. (born October 19, 1942) is an American investor and financial commentator based in Singapore. He is the chairman of Beeland Interests, Inc. He was the co-founder of the Quantum Fund and Soros Fund Management. He was also the creator of the Rogers International Commodities Index (RICI).

Rogers does not consider himself a member of any school of economic thought, but has acknowledged that his views best fit the label of the Austrian School of economics.

==Early life==
Rogers was born in Baltimore, Maryland and raised in Demopolis, Alabama. In 1964, Rogers graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree, &quot;cum laude&quot;, in history from Yale University. He got his first job on Wall Street, at Dominick &amp; Dominick. In 1966, he acquired a second BA degree in philosophy, politics and economics from the University of Oxford, as a member of Balliol College.

==Business career==
In 1964, Rogers joined Dominick &amp; Dominick LLC on Wall Street, where he first learned about stocks and bonds. From 1966 to 1968, he was in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War.

In 1970, Rogers joined investment bank Arnhold and S. Bleichroder, where he worked with George Soros.

In 1973, Soros and Rogers both left and founded the Quantum Fund. From 1973 to 1980, the portfolio gained 4,200% while the S&amp;P advanced about 47%. The Quantum Fund was one of the first truly global funds.

In 1980, Rogers decided to &quot;retire&quot; and traveled on a motorcycle around the world. He has since been a guest professor of finance at the Columbia Business School.

In 1985, he said the Vienna Exchange had high potential of being a bull market.

In 1989 and 1990, Rogers was the moderator of WCBS&#x27; &quot;The Dreyfus Roundtable&quot; and FNN&#x27;s &quot;The Profit Motive with Jim Rogers&quot;.

From 1990 to 1992, he traveled through China again and around the world on motorcycle, covering over 100,000 miles (160,000 km) across six continents. His journey was listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. He tells of his adventures and worldwide investments in the bestseller &quot;Investment Biker.&quot;

In 1998, Rogers founded the Rogers International Commodity Index. In 2007, the index and its three sub-indices were linked to exchange-traded notes under the banner ELEMENTS. The notes track the total return of the indices as an accessible way to invest in the index. Rogers is an outspoken advocate of agriculture investments.

Between January 1, 1999, and January 5, 2002, Rogers went on another Guinness-recognized journey through 116 countries, covering 245,000 kilometers with his wife Paige Parker in a custom-made Mercedes. The trip began in Iceland, which was about to celebrate the millennial anniversary of Leif Eriksson&#x27;s first trip to America. On January 5, 2002, the couple returned to their New York home on Riverside Drive. He wrote &quot;Adventure Capitalist&quot; following this around-the-world adventure.

===2002 to present===
On his return in 2002, Rogers became a regular guest on Fox News&#x27; &quot;Cavuto on Business&quot; and other financial TV shows. In 2005, he wrote &quot;Hot Commodities: How Anyone Can Invest Profitably in the World&#x27;s Best Market&quot;, in which he quotes a &quot;Financial Analysts Journal&quot; academic paper co-authored by Yale School of Management professor Geert Rouwenhorst, entitled &quot;Facts and Fantasies about Commodity Futures&quot;.

In December 2007, Rogers sold his mansion in New York City for about $16 million and moved to Singapore. He said he moved because it was a groundbreaking time for investment potential in Asian markets. His daughters speak fluent Mandarin to prepare them for the future. He said, &quot;If you were smart in 1807, you moved to London, if you were smart in 1907, you moved to New York City, and if you are smart in 2007, you move to Asia.&quot;

In a CNBC interview with Maria Bartiromo broadcast on May 5, 2008, Rogers said that people in China are extremely motivated and driven, and that he wants to be in that type of environment so his daughters are motivated and driven. He added that this is how America and Europe used to be. He chose not to move to Chinese cities like Hong Kong or Shanghai due to high pollution potentially causing health problems for his family. However, he remains skeptical of India&#x27;s future, saying in 2001, &quot;India as we know it will not survive another 30 or 40 years&quot;. In 2015, he exited the India market, saying, &quot;One cannot invest based on hope&quot;. This decision turned out to be a blunder as the Indian market has nearly tripled since his exit.

In 2008, Rogers endorsed Ron Paul, a Republican congressman, for president of the United States.

==Personal life==
Rogers has been married three times. In 1966, he married his first wife, Lois Biener; they divorced in 1969. In 1974, he married Jennifer Skolnik; they divorced in 1977. He married Paige Parker in 2000; they have two daughters.

In September 2012 Rogers was appointed by VTB Capital as an advisor to the agricultural division of its global private equity unit. He noted: &quot;Russia and the CIS region have all the ingredients needed to become the world&#x27;s agriculture powerhouse. It seems that everything may now be coming together under VTB Capital to make this happen, so I am keen to participate, if the fund gets off the ground.&quot;

In February 2013 Rogers joined the board of advisors of the Coalition to Reduce Spending.
In September 2015, he left the Indian market saying &quot;one can&#x27;t just invest on hope&quot;.

In April 2019, Rogers received an honorary Ph.D. from Pusan National University for his books containing positive messages on Korean reunification.

==Financial advice==
In 2002, Rogers said that Fed chairman Alan Greenspan&#x27;s &quot;reaction to the stock-market bubble has caused two more bubbles to grow: a real-estate bubble and a consumer-debt bubble.&quot; In 2006, Rogers said he was shorting US financials, home builders, and Fannie Mae.

On November 4, 2010, speaking at Balliol College, Oxford, Rogers urged students to scrap career plans for Wall Street or the City, London&#x27;s financial district, and to study agriculture and mining instead. &quot;The power is shifting again from the financial centers to the producers of real goods. The place to be is in commodities, raw materials, natural resources.&quot; He repeated this view in 2013 on &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; show on BBC Radio 4, in a feature on &quot;Futurology for Business&quot;.

In May 2012 he remarked during an interview with &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine that &quot;there&#x27;s going to be a huge shift in American society, American culture, in the places where one is going to get rich. The stock brokers are going to be driving taxis. The smart ones will learn to drive tractors so they can work for the smart farmers. The farmers are going to be driving Lamborghinis. I&#x27;m telling you. You should start Forbes Farming.&quot; Rogers has been periodically bearish on the US stock market since the 1980s, notably in 1987, 1998, 1999 and 2008. In February 2018, he predicted that the next bear market would be &quot;the worst in our lifetime.&quot;

<text>Illinois Route 251 is a north–south state highway that runs on the former alignment of U.S. Route 51 before Interstate 39 was built in north central Illinois. It runs from U.S. 51 at the border with Wisconsin to I-39 and U.S. 51 south of Kappa. Illinois 251 is long.

== Route description ==

Illinois 251 runs parallel to Interstate 39 and U.S. 51 for most of the length of I-39 in Illinois. Like Illinois Route 351, it can be considered a spur, loop or alternate of its parent route, U.S. 51. Illinois 251 terminates about north of the southern terminus of I-39.

The road parallels the east bank of the Rock River through Rockford, where the highway goes north on Eleventh Street, west on Harrison, north on Kishwaukee, west on Walnut then split between northbound Third and southbound Second through downtown Rockford. After downtown, both directions take the southbound lanes&#x27; Second Street name as a divided urban expressway (also badged as Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Drive) for a couple of miles north of downtown Rockford. It stays Second Street through Loves Park, Machesney Park and Roscoe until its north endpoint at US 51 and Illinois 75 in South Beloit, short of the Wisconsin state line.

== History ==
Illinois 251 was established in 1982 when first segment of I-39 opened between Rockford and Bloomington. In 1992, the final segment of I-39 opened north of Bloomington. The remaining stretch of former U.S. 51 became Illinois 251. The initial designation of I-39 was U.S. Route 51 until 1992.

<text>Nias (, Nias: &quot;Tanö Niha&quot;) is an island located off the western coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. Nias is also the name of the archipelago () of which the island is the centre, but also includes the Batu Islands to the southeast and the small Hinako Islands to the west.

==Geography==
Nias Island covers an area of (including the Batu Islands to the south and minor offshore islands). It is mostly a lowland area rising to around above sea level. There were 756,338 inhabitants on the island (including the Batu Islands and minor offshore islands) at the 2010 Census; at the 2015 Intermediate Census this had risen to 798,506 and the 2020 Census documented a total of 880,550. The official estimate as of mid-2023 was 930,294.
It is located in a chain of islands parallel to the west coast of Sumatra; Simeulue is about northwest, and the Batu Islands (which are administered as part of Nias and have an ethnically similar population) are located about southeast. This chain, which resurfaces in Nusa Tenggara in the mountainous islands of Sumba and Timor, is the forearc of the South Sumatra Basin along the Sunda Trench subduction zone.

At Nias, the oceanic plate is being obliquely subducted under the Sunda Plate at the rapid rate of a year (Milsom).

==History==
The first inhabitants of Nias were Australomelanesoid people which can be traced back as early as 10,000 BC. They were later superseded by the Austronesian people which ultimately originated from Taiwan. The name of the island derives from the word used by the islanders to refer to themselves, &quot;niha&quot; (&quot;human&quot;). In the local language &quot;(Li Niha),&quot; the island is called &quot;Tanö Niha&quot; (literally the land of humans).

===World War II===
During World War II, Nias was briefly occupied by an unrecognized Nazi state proclaimed by a group of escaped German prisoners calling themselves the Free Republic of Nias.

===Tsunami and earthquakes of 2004 and 2005===
On 26 December 2004, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake struck a few kilometers north of the island, creating tsunamis as high as . 122 people were killed and hundreds more were rendered homeless.

On 28 March 2005, the island was again hit by the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, initially presumed to be an aftershock of the 2004 quake, but now regarded as the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Indonesia and among the top 10 most powerful recorded worldwide since 1900. At least 800 people were reported dead, with the possibility of more than 2,000 casualties. Hundreds of buildings were toppled and many thousands of people were made homeless. In 2007, almost two years after the earthquake, there were still tens of thousands of internally displaced persons living in camps throughout Nias.

Nias&#x27;s coastline has changed markedly with the tsunami and earthquake. In some areas, the coast moved over inland. In other areas, as much as a further of land has been exposed. Uplift of land as much as has been recorded.

Following the earthquake, many international aid agencies moved in to assist in rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. Oxfam, International Aid, Giving Children Hope, Save the Children Fund, World Vision, Surf Aid, Safe Harbor International, and Caritas International are some of the international NGOs represented in Nias. UN agencies represented include UNORC – Office of the UN Recovery Coordinator for Aceh and Nias, UNDP, UNICEF, UN-Habitat, WFP, IOM and UNIDO.

==Administration==

Nias is the largest of the islands off Sumatra that are part of North Sumatra province. This archipelago consists of 131 islands, of which Nias Island is the biggest. The population in this area was 756,762 inhabitants at the 2010 Census, including Ono Niha (the indigenous inhabitants of the island), Malay, Batak, and Chinese; by the 2020 Census the population had risen to 880,550, and the official estimate for mid-2023 was 930,294.
Until 2003 Nias was a single administrative regency (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) covering the entire island, part of the province of North Sumatra. On 25 February 2003, it was split into two regencies, Nias Regency (covering the northern half of the island) and South Nias Regency (&quot;Nias Selatan&quot;), the latter including the Batu Islands further south. Subsequently, on 20 October 2008, the island was divided further, with the creation of two further regencies from parts of the former Nias Regency – Nias Barat (West Nias) and Nias Utara (North Nias) – and the designation of Gunungsitoli as an autonomous city independent of the four regencies. Gunungsitoli remains the center of the business affairs of the entire island. Teluk Dalam is the capital of Nias Selatan Regency, Lötu of Nias Utara Regency, Lahömi of Nias Barat Regency, and Gidö of Nias Regency.

All parties in the North Sumatra Legislative Council have agreed to the formation of a Nias Province (comprising Nias, Nias Selatan, Nias Utara and Nias Barat regencies, and Gunungsitoli municipality). It was approved at a regional plenary session on 2 May 2011 but still awaits approval from the Central government, which has not yet enacted the grand design for additional provinces. The new province will thus cover an area identical to the original Nias Regency before the latter&#x27;s division in 2003. Apart from Nias Island itself, the province will include the smaller Batu Islands (Pulau-Pulau Batu) to the south, lying between Nias and Siberut; the Batu Islands form seven administrative districts within South Nias Regency.

: # South Nias Regency includes the Batu Islands.

==Culture==


The isolated Nias Island chain has been trading since prehistory with other cultures, other islands, and even mainland Asia. Some historians and archaeologists have cited the local culture as one of the few remaining Megalithic cultures in existence today. While this point of view is hotly debated, there is no doubt that Nias&#x27; relative geographic isolation has created a unique culture. Nias is best known for its diversity of festivals and celebrations. The most well-known events are War Dances, performed regularly for tourists, and Stone Jumping, a manhood ritual that sees young men leaping over two-meter stone towers to their fate. In the past, the top of the stone board is covered with spikes and sharp pointed bamboo. The music of Nias, performed mostly by women, is noted worldwide for its haunting beauty.

Gunungsitoli is home to Nias&#x27;s only museum, the Museum Pusaka Nias (Nias Heritage Foundation), which houses over 6000 objects related to Nias&#x27;s cultural heritage. The museum had recently built a new building and had improved its storage and exhibitions when the 2004 earthquake and tsunami occurred. The museum suffered some damage to the grounds and collections, but museum staff are working to recover from this devastating event

The predominant religion is Protestant Christianity. Six out of seven Niasans are Protestant; the remainder are about evenly divided between Muslims (mostly immigrants from elsewhere in Indonesia) and Catholics. However, adherence to either Christian or Muslim religions is still largely symbolic; Nias continues into the current day celebrating its own indigenous culture and traditions as the primary form of spiritual expression.

The people of Nias build Omo Hada houses on massive ironwood pillars with towering roofs. Not only were they almost impregnable to attack in former tribal warfare, but their flexible nail-less construction provided proven earthquake durability.

==Environment==
Nias is home not only to a unique human culture but also endemic fauna which differ from other areas of North Sumatra because of the island&#x27;s remote location separate from Sumatra. The island has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

==Transportation==
To reach Nias, there is a weekly ship from Jakarta to Gunungsitoli; there were ferries from Sibolga to Gunungsitoli, Teluk Dalam, or Lahewa every day; before the Asian financial crisis hit Indonesia, there was a daily flight from Medan to Gunungsitoli. This became less frequent following the crisis.

Since the 1998 Reformation, however, transport links on and to the island have become poor. Internally, the road system is in very bad condition. Externally the air and ferry links are unreliable. There are two ferry terminals (Gunungsitoli and Teluk Dalam) and an airport (Binaka, near Gunungsitoli) on the island, serviced mainly from Sibolga and Medan respectively. However, local ferry companies regularly go out of business (or their boats sink), so only one terminal may be active at any given time. Since the 2005 earthquake, transportation has improved to cope with the increase in travel needs for reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts. Wings Air and Manunggal Air are the airlines that fly to Gunungsitoli.

National flag carrier Garuda Indonesia was set to operate a new service from Jakarta to Nias in North Sumatra starting 15 November 2018. This direct flight allows travelers to visit the regency&#x27;s capital Gunungsitoli. Using the CRJ Bombardier 1000 Next-Gen that can accommodate 96 passengers, the route operates three times a week, on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

==Surfing==
Nias is an internationally famous surfing destination. The best-known surfing area is Sorake Bay, close to the town of Teluk Dalam, on the southern tip. Enclosed by the beaches of Lagundri and Sorake, the bay has both left and right-hand breaks. As they wait for waves, surfers can often see sea turtles swimming below. There are also two consistent, world-class waves in the nearby Hinako Islands, Asu and Bawa. Many lesser-known, high-quality surf spots with low crowds await adventurous travelers.

Nias was part of the famous Hippie trail of the 1960s, particularly traveled by surfers, which led to Bali. It has been the site of several international surfing competitions in the past, particularly before the 1998 Indonesian Reformation Movement.

Despite the storied history of surfing in Nias, international surfing in Nias has slowed down especially (but not specifically) due to the earthquakes of December 2004 and January 2005. The situation has since been gradually improving, however.

<text>Vincent Browne (born 1947) is an Irish sculptor.

== Biography ==

Browne was born in Dublin in 1947. He studied at the National College of Art and Design and at the Jan Van Eyck Academy in the Netherlands. In 1987, Browne represented Ireland in Budapest at the 7th International Small Sculpture Show. He created a well-loved Dublin landmark, &quot;Mr. Screen&quot;, the squat bronze usher who stood outside the Screen Cinema at the junction of Hawkins Street and Townsend Street in Dublin for many years. &quot;Mr Screen&quot; was made from two immersion water heaters and was relocated to the Savoy Cinema after the closure of the Screen. His public commissions also include &quot;Anti-War Memorial&quot; (Limerick, 1987) and the bronze Palm Tree seat in Temple Bar, Dublin.

In 2005, Browne was commissioned to create a sculpture for the exterior of the Blanchardstown Civic Offices called &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;.

<doc id="1340774" wikidata="Q1368197" url="?curid=1340774" title="New Drug Application">
<text>The Food and Drug Administration&#x27;s (FDA) New Drug Application (NDA) is the vehicle in the United States through which drug sponsors formally propose that the FDA approve a new pharmaceutical for sale and marketing. Some 30% or less of initial drug candidates proceed through the entire multi-year process of drug development, concluding with an approved NDA, if successful.

The goals of the NDA are to provide enough information to permit FDA reviewers to establish the complete history of the candidate drug. Among facts needed for the application are:
* Patent and manufacturing information
* Drug safety and specific effectiveness for its proposed use(s) when used as directed
* Reports on the design, compliance, and conclusions of completed clinical trials by the Institutional Review Board
* Drug susceptibility to abuse
* Proposed labeling (package insert) and directions for use

Exceptions to this process include voter driven initiatives for medical marijuana in certain states.

==Before trials==
To legally test the drug on human subjects in the United States, the maker must first obtain an Investigational New Drug (IND) designation from FDA. This application is based on nonclinical data, typically from a combination of in vivo and in vitro laboratory safety studies, that shows the drug is safe enough to test in humans. Often the &quot;new&quot; drugs that are submitted for approval include new molecular entities or old medications that have been chemically modified to elicit differential pharmacological effects or reduced side effects.

==Clinical trials==
Since the 1962 Kefauver–Harris Amendment, new drugs are statutorily required to demonstrate both safety and effectiveness through &quot;substantial evidence&quot; for approval. The amendment defines &quot;substantial evidence&quot; as &quot;evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved, on the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof.&quot;
This standard lies at the heart of the regulatory program for drugs. Data for the submission must include those from one or more rigorous clinical trials.

Due to the plural &quot;adequate and well-controlled investigations&quot; in the statute, FDA has interpreted the substantial evidence requirement as requiring at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, each convincing on its own. However, in 1997, Congress passed an amendment, expressly granting FDA authority to consider other types of confirmatory evidence along with one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation for approval.

The trials are typically conducted in three phases:
* Phase 1: The drug is tested in 20 to 100 healthy volunteers to determine its safety at low doses. About 70% of candidate drugs advance to Phase 2.
* Phase 2: The drug is tested for both efficacy and safety in up to several hundred people with the targeted disease. Some two-thirds of candidate drugs fail in Phase 2 clinical trials due to the drug not being as effective as anticipated.
* Phase 3: The drug is typically tested in several hundred to several thousand people with the targeted disease in double-blind, placebo controlled trials to demonstrate its specific efficacy. Under 30% of drug candidates succeed through Phase 3.
* Phase 4: These are postmarketing surveillance trials in several thousand people taking the drug for its intended purpose to monitor efficacy and safety of the approved marketed drug.

The legal requirements for safety and effectiveness have been interpreted as requiring scientific evidence that the benefits of a drug outweigh the risks and that adequate instructions exist for use, since many drugs have adverse side effects.

==The actual application==
The results of the testing program are codified in an FDA-approved public document that is called the &quot;product label,&quot; package insert or Full Prescribing Information. The prescribing information is widely available on the web from the FDA, drug manufacturers, and frequently inserted into drug packages. The main purpose of a drug label is to provide healthcare providers and consumers with adequate information and directions for the safe use of the drug.

The documentation required in an NDA is supposed to tell &quot;the drug’s whole story, including what happened during the clinical tests, what the ingredients of the drug are, the results of the animal studies, how the drug behaves in the body, and how it is manufactured, processed and packaged.” Once approval of an NDA is obtained, the new drug can be legally marketed starting that day in the United States.

Once the application is submitted, the FDA has 60 days to conduct a preliminary review, which assesses whether the NDA is &quot;sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.&quot; If the FDA finds the NDA insufficiently complete, then the FDA rejects the application by sending the applicant a &quot;Refuse to File&quot; letter, which explains where the application failed to meet requirements. Where the application cannot be granted for substantive reasons, the FDA issues a Complete Response Letter.

Assuming the FDA finds the NDA acceptable, a &quot;74-day letter&quot; is published. A &quot;standard review&quot; implies an FDA decision within about 10 months while a &quot;priority review&quot; should complete within 6 months.

== Requirements for similar products ==
Biologics, such as vaccines and many recombinant proteins used in medical treatments are generally approved by FDA via a Biologic License Application (BLA), rather than an NDA. The manufacture of biologics is considered to differ fundamentally from that of less complex chemicals, requiring a somewhat different approval process.

Generic drugs that have already been approved via an NDA submitted by another maker are approved via an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), which does not require all of the clinical trials normally required for a new drug in an NDA. Most biological drugs, including a majority of recombinant proteins are considered ineligible for an ANDA under current US law. However, a handful of biologic medicines, including biosynthetic insulin, growth hormone, glucagon, calcitonin, and hyaluronidase are grandfathered under governance of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act, because these products were already approved when legislation to regulate biotechnology medicines later passed as part of the Public Health Services Act.

Medications intended for use in animals are submitted to a different center within FDA, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) in a New Animal Drug Application (NADA). These are also specifically evaluated for their use in food animals and their possible effect on the food from animals treated with the drug.

<text>Ancistrochilus is a genus of the orchid family (Orchidaceae), comprising only 2 species. 
==Description==
These two species are cool to hot growing orchids, found from tropical West Africa to Tanzania and Uganda. They grow on tree trunks and large branches at elevations between 500 and 1100 m.

These are sympodial epiphytic plants with wide, characteristic conical or pyriform pseudobulbs, carrying two to three broad, acute, lanceolate leaves. These leaves are shed after growth has slowed.

Three to four large and attractive, fragrant flowers, 8 cm across, then appear from the base of the mature leafless pseudobulb in a pubescent inflorescence. The petals and sepals are dark-colored, rose pink. The three-lobed lip is magenta. It ends in an elongated, narrow, curved projection.
==Taxonomy==
The name is derived from the Greek words &quot;ankistron&quot; (&quot;hook&quot;) and &quot;cheilos&quot; (&quot;lip&quot;), referring to the form of the lip.

<doc id="1340786" wikidata="Q2623739" url="?curid=1340786" title="Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art">
<text>The Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art is a museum on the crest of Mount Carmel, in Haifa, Israel, dedicated to the preservation and exhibition of Japanese art. It is the only such museum in the Middle East. It was established in 1959 on the initiative of Felix Tikotin of the Netherlands, and Abba Hushi, who was the mayor of Haifa.

== History ==

Felix Tikotin, an architect by profession, was an internationally renowned collector and dealer in Japanese works of art. For more than forty years he amassed his valuable and rare collection and organized exhibitions of Japanese art in many museums. During the Second World War, because he was Jewish, Felix Tikotin fled from the Nazis. He hid his collection in the Netherlands to prevent it from falling into their hands. After the war, Tikotin decided that his unique collection should be taken to Israel, and in 1956 he came to Israel and donated the collection to one of Israel&#x27;s museums. During a visit to Haifa he met Mayor Abba Hushi, and decided that the collection should remain in Haifa, and that he would build a pavilion specifically for exhibiting it here.
Tikotin travelled to the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, France, England and Japan to organize support for his idea. He engaged the help of museum directors such as Nagatake Asano (1895–1965); academics such as Chisaburoh Yamada (1908–1984) of the Tokyo University of the Arts, who was also chosen to be the first director of the Japanese Museum in Haifa; spiritual leaders such as Victor M. A. Suzuki, son of the famous Zen philosopher, and others. During the years 1966–1992 the museum was directed by Eli Lancman, who received a prize from the Japanese government in 2001.
At a meeting of the Haifa Municipality on May 18, 1958, it was decided to acquire the &quot;Kisch House&quot; and its surrounding land. The house was built by Brigadier Frederick Kisch, Chairman of the Zionist Executive Committee in Jerusalem and Head of the Political Department of the Zionist Organization, later of the Jewish Agency from 1923 to 1931. He lived in the house from 1934 to 1939. Kisch, who commanded the Engineering Brigade of the British Eighth Army, fell in battle during the North African Campaign in April 1943. The Kisch House is still the home of the offices of the museum, the library, the creativity workshops, and a Japanese room. The library – the largest of its kind in Israel – comprises some 3,000 books and publications relating to Japanese art and culture. 
In February 1959 plans were approved for a Japanese pavilion, and construction began on the exhibition hall in accordance with the ideas and plans of Felix Tikotin, supervised by the architect M. Lev. The exhibition hall was designed in the Japanese spirit. It is spacious, and has sliding doors of paper leading to the garden, conveying a Japanese atmosphere. On May 25, 1960, the Japanese Museum was opened to the public with an exhibition of works from the donor&#x27;s collection. In accordance with Tikotin&#x27;s wishes, a Board of Trustees of the museum was set up, headed today by his daughter, Ilana Drukker-Tikotin.

The museum&#x27;s collection comprises some 8,000 items of art and crafts – paintings, prints, drawings, painted screens, textiles, antique illustrated texts, ceramics, miniature carvings (&quot;netsuke&quot;), lacquer and metal work, antique swords and functional art works, mainly from the 17th to 19th centuries, as well as a collection of modern Japanese art. The collection has increased over time, and other private collections have been donated.

Exhibitions cover different aspects of Japanese culture, displaying traditional and modern art, and emphasizing the aesthetic values unique to Japanese art. According to Japanese custom, a room is sparsely furnished with items selected for specific events and for the season. Hence the exhibitions are changed approximately every three months, and subject, style and period are common to all of them. Exhibitions are accompanied by illustrated catalogues and explanatory texts. The museum store also sells exhibition posters. 
In 1982 the Japanese philanthropist Ryoichi Sasakawa donated the sum of one and half million dollars for the construction of a large new wing to the museum. It was designed by the Japanese architect Junzo Yoshimura, together with Israeli architect Al Mansfeld of Haifa. It was opened in 1995, and is funded by the Eva Tikotin-Licht Foundation. Yoshimura, one of the renowned architects of Japan, designed the National Museum at Nara in Japan and the Japan House, now known as Japan Society (Manhattan), in New York. Mansfeld is known as the architect of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. The new wing has two floors and a lower parking area, and extends over 1,800 square metres. The exhibition hall covers 350 sq.m. and is connected to the original hall (300 sq.m.) in the old building. Adjacent to the large hall is a smaller hall of 120 sq.m. On the second floor the Raphael Angel acoustic Auditorium was constructed in 2000, with two hundred seats. A special staircase was connected to lead to the auditorium. The old building is a single story, and its integration with the new building created a single harmonious unit, embodying the Japanese spirit. The addition of these construction elements was planned by the firm Mansfeld Kehat Architects.

==Educational activities==
Tikotin&#x27;s dream was that the Japanese Museum should be a centre for studying Japanese arts and culture and for broadening the Israelis&#x27; knowledge about Japan. In the educational branch of the museum, workshops based on the exhibitions are conducted for schoolchildren and those of kindergarten age, for teachers, and for other groups. Courses are given about the Japanese language, calligraphy and ink drawing, &quot;ikebana&quot;, cooking, and special activities are held for children. There are also Japanese rooms for learning about how people live in Japan, their clothing, food, and homes. 
The museum presents a variety of events concerning the arts and culture of Japan. These include lectures, films, the tea ceremony, festivals and special celebrations, many of which are held in the Raphael Angel Auditorium. As a result of its activities, the museum has become a centre for promoting and understanding the unique Japanese culture, and for establishing closer ties between the two nations.

==Awards and recognition==
Since the re-opening of the museum in December 1995, there were some 145 new exhibits most, of which were curated by the museum&#x27;s chief curator, Dr. Ilana Singer Blaine, who won the award by the minister of science and culture (2007), the award of the Japanese minister of foreign affairs (2014) and the Japanese emperor decoration “The Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Rosette” conferred by the prime minister of Japan (2021). In 2000, the museum received the Japan Foundation Special Award, which is conferred annually on institutions that make significant contributions to cultural exchanges with Japan. In 2003, the Israeli Ministry of Education and Culture&#x27;s committee for evaluating the quality of exhibitions and collections, ranked the Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art second only to the Israel Museum in order of merit.

<doc id="1340793" wikidata="Q2719860" url="?curid=1340793" title="Silicon Messiah">
<text>Silicon Messiah is the debut studio album by English heavy metal band Blaze, the band which formed by Blaze Bayley, released in 2000, and being the first album since the departure of Bayley from Iron Maiden in 1999.

Original Japanese and South American pressings included bonus tracks: &quot;The Day I Fell to Earth&quot; was included in both territories, while South American pressings additionally included &quot;Motherfuckers R Us&quot; and a live cover of the Wolfsbane song &quot;Steel&quot;, along with an interactive track. With the exception of the interactive track, these bonus tracks were subsequently reissued internationally on the 15th anniversary edition of the album in 2015. The cover artwork on the album features an image of Blaze Bayley with his skin coloured blue and covered with computer circuitry.

==Writing==
The song &quot;Born As a Stranger&quot; is based on the Robert A. Heinlein novel &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; and was originally intended for Iron Maiden. Blaze Bayley began writing the track for his intended third album with the band, but when he was replaced as lead singer by the returning Bruce Dickinson, Bayley instead repurposed the song for &quot;Silicon Messiah&quot;. Bayley&#x27;s tenure with Iron Maiden also informed the bonus tracks &quot;The Day I Fell to Earth&quot;, which deals with his abrupt departure from the band, and &quot;Motherfuckers R Us&quot;, which recalls a concert on the North American leg of the Virtual XI World Tour.

Other influences on the album include &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; by Philip K. Dick, which inspired the song &quot;Identity&quot;, and the film &quot;Gattaca&quot;, upon which both &quot;Reach for the Horizon&quot; and &quot;The Launch&quot; were based.

<doc id="1340808" wikidata="Q6751257" url="?curid=1340808" title="Manomin County, Minnesota">
<text>Manomin County was a county in Minnesota that existed separately for 13 years from 1857 to 1869. The land was originally split off from Ramsey County. When it was formed, it was the smallest county in the United States at roughly 16 square miles. It comprised the Fridley Township, named for Minnesota legislator Abram M. Fridley. Abram Fridley was the chairman of the county commissioners during the lifetime of the county. The population in 1860 was 136. It was merged into Anoka County in 1869.
This land area currently makes up the unusual southward extension of Anoka County between Hennepin and Ramsey counties. The Manomin County Park in Fridley, at the confluence of Rice Creek and the Mississippi River remains near the former Manomin town site.

Manomin is a variant spelling of &quot;manoomin&quot;, the Ojibwe word for wild rice, a staple of their diet. A current Minnesota county, Mahnomen, created in 1906, is similarly named.

==History==
Manomin county was created when the Fridley township sections were split from Ramsey County, on May 23, 1857. The county seat was Manomin (present-day Fridley). Another former county, Buchanan County, was created in Minnesota on the same day. Manomin County was disbanded in 1858 and administratively attached to St. Louis County, Minnesota. In 1860, it was attached to Anoka County. At the time, the area&#x27;s population was 136. In 1863, it was attached to Hennepin County. An amendment to Article 11 of the state constitution, to bring Manomin County into Anoka county passed in the November 2, 1869, election with 88.9 percent support.
Henry C. Fridley, son of territorial legislator Abram M. Fridley, would later describe the situation in a letter dated April 18, 1899.
*&quot;...Of course, a county of so small an area and sparsely populated was unable to maintain an organization without embarrassment and liability of being subject to exorbitant taxation, should its political management fall into incompetent hands. It was &#x27;an elephant on our hands,&#x27; difficult to get rid of, because of the constitutional provision against reducing counties below four hundred square miles, hence the constitutional amendment was submitted and adopted as the only way out of the dilemma.&quot;

==Geography==
Within the boundaries of what was Manomin county are today the cities of Fridley, Columbia Heights, Hilltop, part of Spring Lake Park, and a small part of Coon Rapids. It was technically described,

*&quot;The county of Manomin is established and bounded as Beginning in the middle of the channel of the Mississippi river at its with the line between townships twenty nine and thirty north of twenty four west from the fourth meridian thence east on said town line to the south east corner of town thirty of range twenty four thence on the east line of said town to the north east corner thereof thence on the north line of said town to the centre of the channel of the river thence down the middle of said channel to the place of beginning .&quot;

The county consisted of 18 sections, of which six were bounded by the Mississippi river, and measured less than the 640 acres of a full section.

<text>Alleyn&#x27;s School is a 4–18 co-educational, independent, day school and sixth form in Dulwich, London, England. It is a registered charity and was originally part of Edward Alleyn&#x27;s College of God&#x27;s Gift charitable foundation, which also included James Allen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School (JAGS) and Dulwich College.

It has been a member school of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference since 1919.

==History==
===Edward Alleyn===
In 1619, Edward Alleyn established his &#x27;College of God&#x27;s Gift&#x27; (the gift of love) with twelve poor scholars.

Alleyn&#x27;s School is a direct descendant of Edward Alleyn&#x27;s original foundation and was established as a boys&#x27; school in 1882. It still exists as part of a foundation alongside Dulwich College and JAGS; 
For the original College of God&#x27;s Gift, 24 students had to be chosen from the four parishes with which Edward Alleyn had been connected. Saint Giles, Camberwell (in which Dulwich was situated), Saint Saviour, Southwark (where the Bear Pit stood on Bankside), Saint Botolph, Bishopsgate (where Alleyn was born), and Saint Giles, Cripplegate (home to the Fortune Theatre).
Alleyn&#x27;s became a public school with the election of the Headmaster to the Headmasters&#x27; Conference (HMC) in 1919.

===The Lower School===
The 1857 &quot;Act for confirming a Scheme of the Charity Commissioners for the College of God&#x27;s Gift in Dulwich in the County of Surrey&quot;, also known as the &quot;Dulwich College Act&quot;, mandated that the College of God&#x27;s Gift be separated into an &quot;Upper School&quot;, which became Dulwich College, and a &quot;Lower School&quot; which became Alleyn&#x27;s. It was redone in 2018 to provide extra classrooms, an assembly room and a play area.

===Separation from the College of God&#x27;s Gift===
In 1882, the upper school moved to a new site further south and the lower school stayed put, becoming an independent boys&#x27; school.

In 1887 it moved to its own site, where the school currently stands. The original school is now the foundation chapel and the offices for the Dulwich Estate, which belongs to the foundation schools.

===Independence and co-education===
It was one of 179 direct grant grammar schools from 1958 until the abolition of that status in 1976; at which point the school was still boys-only. The Governors then opted for outright independence and co-education; Chairman Lord Wolfenden explained the decision in the House of Lords on 12 November 1975:
As a responsible body of Governors, we were confronted with an extremely difficult decision. The dilemma is this. Should we, as the phrase goes, &quot;take our place within the pattern of the local education authority&quot;, or should we, on the other hand, go independent? In relation to the former of those alternatives, there are two relevant considerations. The first is whether the past history and present nature of a school fits in with the overall structure of the pattern of the local education authority for children in the Dulwich area. The answer is that it clearly does not. A long-established grammar school, annually recruited to carry out what has for long been recognised by a substantial number of LEAs as its specific academic purpose, does not easily transform itself overnight into a comprehensive school to serve a limited catchment area. Even if it could do that, with extraordinary metamorphoses of staff and objectives, there is no evidence whatever that any local education authority would be prepared to absorb it. So the dilemma is resolved, your Lordships may say. Yes, but at what cost? Alleyn&#x27;s School has no option, whatever its wishes might have been, but to go independent.Doctrines and ideologies apart, what does this mean in real life? It means that there will now be in Dulwich two independent day grammar schools, one of 1,300 boys and the other of 800 boys, within a couple of miles of each other. It also means that in order to maintain Alleyn&#x27;s as an independent school its fees, with the removal of direct grant, will have to be put up to something like those of its consistently independent neighbour, Dulwich College. What sense does it make to have over 2,000 places in independent boys&#x27; grammar schools, at independent school fees, in one district of South London? We, the Governors of Alleyn&#x27;s 1847 School think it makes no sense at all, so we are intending to make Alleyn&#x27;s into a co-educational school. Then, in the Dulwich area, there will be an independent boys&#x27; school, Dulwich College, an independent girls&#x27; school, James Allen&#x27;s School, and an independent coeducational school, Alleyn&#x27;s.

==Development==
Alleyn&#x27;s started developing a new theatre complex, named the Edward Alleyn Building, on 10 February 2007. The £8.5 million building was completed in 2008 and had a Grand Gala Opening in 2009.

==Extra-curricular activities==
The school has one of the largest Combined Cadet Forces in the country, where students can choose between joining the Royal Navy Section, Army Section or RAF Section. The Alleyn&#x27;s CCF is led mainly by its Cadet NCOs who are Sixth Form students responsible for teaching the younger cadets. These are led by a team of Senior Cadet NCOs under the Cadet RSM and members of adult staff. These Cadet Force adult volunteers have a range of military, civilian or teaching backgrounds. 

The Alleyn&#x27;s CCF offers a JNCO CADRE, a unique leadership and advanced infantry training programme, as well as visits to European Battlefields, military bases in England and Wales, and recent courses in Northern Sweden and Cyprus. The Alleyn&#x27;s CCF takes part in annual parades in Dulwich Village with the contingents of Dulwich College and JAGS on Remembrance Sunday. For Remembrance Sunday 2022, Alleyn&#x27;s was invited to provide a stair party of cadets from the Army Section for the arrival of HM the King at the Cenotaph in London. 

The CCF is also closely linked to the Alleyn&#x27;s School Rifle Club which competes in various cadet smallbore and fullbore target rifle competitions. 

DofE is also offered, with students taking part in volunteering, skills based activities and a final expedition at the end of the year.

Music and Drama also form a large part of life at Alleyn&#x27;s with the Michael Croft Theatre (MCT) being a point of pride for the school&#x27;s Drama department who put on shows there. The music at Alleyn&#x27;s is equally distinguished, with performances at the Royal Festival Hall and St John&#x27;s, Smith Square, as well as music tours to Italy, France and Poland.

<text>Mark Alan Clear (born May 27, 1956) is an American former two-time All Star Major League Baseball relief pitcher who played for the California Angels (1979–80, 1990), Boston Red Sox (1981–85), and Milwaukee Brewers (1986–88). He batted and threw right-handed.

==Early life==
Clear was born in Los Angeles and attended Northview High School in Covina, California. He attended Mount San Antonio College in Walnut, California.

Clear&#x27;s uncle is Bob Clear, who was a minor league pitcher in the 1940s and 1950s, and a coach with the California Angels from 1976 to 1986.

==Professional career==
The Philadelphia Phillies selected Clear in the eighth round of the 1974 MLB draft. A hard curveballer with shaky control, Clear was a flexible set-up man, and an occasional closer as well. Twice he struck out 100-plus batters without starting a game (becoming the first pitcher to do so), and pitched 100 or more innings in three different seasons.

In 1979, Clear was an All Star and came in 19th in voting for the American League MVP. That year he won the June AL Pitcher of the Month Award. He was 11–5 with a 3.63 earned run average (ERA). His 14 saves were 7th-most in the American League.

On July 6, 1980, Clear won the AL Pitcher of the Week Award. He was traded along with Carney Lansford and Rick Miller from the Angels to the Red Sox for Rick Burleson and Butch Hobson five months later on December 10, 1980.

In 1982, Clear was again voted an All Star, and finished the season with a career-high 14 wins and 109 strikeouts. He had a 3.00 ERA in 105 innings, and his 14 saves were 9th-most in the American League. His 2.20 ERA and 16 saves in 1986 were career bests, and his 16 saves were 8th-most in the American League. In May of that season, Clear won the AL Pitcher of the Month Award.

In his 11-year career, Clear compiled a 71–49 record with a 3.85 ERA, 83 saves, and 804 strikeouts in 804.1 innings.

<doc id="1340820" wikidata="Q735939" url="?curid=1340820" title="Princess Shikishi">
<text>(1149 – March 1, 1201) was a Japanese classical poet, who lived during the late Heian and early Kamakura periods. She was the third daughter of Emperor Go-Shirakawa. In 1159, Shikishi, who did not marry, went into service as &quot;saiin&quot; at the Kamo Shrine in Kyoto. She left the shrine after some time, and in her later years became a Buddhist nun.

Shikishi is credited with 49 poems in the &quot;Shinkokinshū&quot;, a collection of some 2,000 popular works compiled in the early Kamakura period, and many other poems included in the &quot;Senzai Wakashū&quot;, compiled in the late Heian period to commemorate her father&#x27;s ascension, and later compilations.

The poet&#x27;s name is sometimes also pronounced as &quot;Shokushi&quot; (both &quot;on-yomi&quot; readings). Modern given names using the same characters include &quot;Shikiko&quot; (mix of &quot;on-&quot; and &quot;kun-yomi&quot;) and &quot;Noriko&quot; (pure &quot;kun-yomi&quot;). Her title of &quot;&quot; translates to “Imperial Princess”.

== Biography ==
Though her exact date of birth is unknown, it is estimated that Princess Shikishi was born in 1150, and she died in the year 1201. She was the third daughter of Go-Shirakawa, seventy-seventh emperor of Japan beginning in the year 1155. During her lifetime, Japan saw turbulent times like the Hōgen and Heiji rebellions of 1156 and 1159, respectively, which involved competing samurai clans vying for political power. There were also numerous natural disasters, including a tornado, a famine, and an earthquake, all of which wreaked destruction on Japan&#x27;s inhabitants.

During all this action, Shikishi was cloistered away for much of the time. In 1159, the Kamo Shrine chose her to be their thirty-first &quot;saiin&quot; or high priestess. An emperor-appointed position, the &quot;saiin&quot; represented the emperor by attending to the primary deities at the major Shinto shrines. To be &quot;saiin&quot; was an important and luxurious job—she factored largely in the annual rite, called the &quot;Kamo no Matsuri&quot; or &quot;Aoi Matsuri&quot;, which was celebrated with a great festival every year. She also had many attendants and lived in her own palace, but &quot;saiin&quot; could be a rather lonely appointment, as the girl would move away from her family and remain mostly separate from the public. As &quot;saiin&quot;, Shikishi would have lived near the capital, and her large number of attendants provided ample company; however, this career came with many restrictions and the government policies at the time made it difficult for princesses to marry. Shikishi remained in this position for ten years until she became ill, forcing her to depart the shrine in 1169. She dealt with several illnesses over the rest of her life, including what was probably breast cancer.

Around 1181, Shikishi became acquainted with Fujiwara no Shunzei, a famous poet of the time with whom she may have studied, and developed a friendship with his son Teika. Teika was also a renowned poet, and it is speculated that Shikishi and Teika were in a relationship. Much of Shikishi&#x27;s poetry contains a tone of saddened longing, which has led some to believe she dealt with unrequited or unattainable love. Teika kept a thorough journal, in which he chronicles his visits to Shikishi. He and Shunzei would often visit her together, but Teika does not go into detail about these visits, though his concern for her appears in entries during the time when Shikishi&#x27;s illness was worsening. A couple of times he wrote that he remained through the night, including a time Shikishi was especially ill and he stayed in “the northern corner of the kitchen”. Scholars disagree about whether or not Shikishi and Teika were lovers, and the evidence is too small to be certain either way.
In the 1190s, Shikishi took Buddhist vows to become a nun and adopted the name &quot;Shōnyohō&quot;, as she had become a believer in Pure Land Buddhism. Also in the 1190s, there were two separate instances of rumors that she had cursed notable women, one of the instances involving a plot against the government; and some believe she took the vows partly to escape punishment. No action was taken regarding either of these accusations, however.

Shikishi was appointed as foster mother in 1200 to the future Emperor Juntoku, and also during this year she wrote a set of one hundred poems for the , which was sponsored by her nephew, the retired Emperor Go-Toba. Go-Toba had directed all notable poets in this year to submit some of their works for this anthology, and Shikishi wrote this set of poems in only twenty days despite being extremely ill. Beginning with twenty-five, eventually forty-nine of Shikishi&#x27;s poems were chosen for the eighth imperial anthology, the &quot;Shin Kokin Wakashū&quot; (as opposed to only nine of Teika&#x27;s), which altogether contained 1,979 poems. For the two decades between Shikishi and Teika&#x27;s first meeting and the former&#x27;s death, the latter&#x27;s diary displays some of the ongoing health struggles Shikishi had until her death in 1201.

== Poetry ==
Today 399 of Shikishi&#x27;s poems are known, many of which are part of three sets: Sequences A, B, and C. The poetry form Shikishi used was called tanka, which involves grouping syllables into a set of 5-7-5-7-7. As this form was rather limited, the most widely used way of experimentation lay in stringing together several sets of these 5-7-5-7-7 lines to make longer poems. Sequences A, B, and C were written in hundred-tanka sequences, called &quot;hyakushu-uta&quot;, and the rest of her poems are in smaller sets of tanka. Though it is difficult to be certain, Sequence A is thought to have been written sometime between 1169 (perhaps earlier) and 1194. It is believed that Sequence B was written between 1187 and 1194, and it is known for certain that Sequence C, the one she wrote for Go-Toba&#x27;s poetry collection, was written in 1200 shortly before she died.
Sequences A and B both abide by the same subjects and numbers: Spring, 20 poems; Summer, 15 poems; Autumn, 20 poems; Winter, 15 poems; followed by Love, 15 poems; and Miscellany, 15 poems.
Sequence C contains the typical set of seasonal poems: 20 for Spring and Autumn, and 15 for Summer and Winter; followed by Love, 10 poems; Travels, 5 poems; Mountain Living, 5 poems; Birds, 5 poems; and Felicitations, 5 poems.
The many tanka in a &quot;hyakushu-uta&quot; each focus on a single component of the greater concept of the poem, coming together to form an interconnected whole. Tanka often made use of the literary technique &quot;kakekotoba&quot;, a method that involved using homonyms and homophones. For example, one of Shikishi&#x27;s tanka reads:

In this poem, the segment &quot;furu&quot; of the word &quot;furiyuku&quot; means “to fall (like snow)” and also “to grow old”. The poem&#x27;s use of &quot;kakekotoba&quot; connects the idea of the narrator&#x27;s heart softening at the season&#x27;s change to the idea that she is aging.
Shikishi also used a device called , or “related word”. &quot;Engo&quot; involves tying together imagery in a poem by using words that evoke similar ideas. In one poem she writes:

Here, the word &quot;hare&quot;, meaning “cleared”, also connects to the image of the &quot;clear&quot; light of the moon (&quot;tsukikage&quot;). 
Another more content-based technique that appears in Shikishi&#x27;s writing is &quot;honka-dori&quot;, the taking of a passage by another poet and incorporating it into one&#x27;s own work, without acknowledgement. Some may be uncomfortable with this technique, considering its resemblance to plagiarism. However, considering the restrictive structure of tanka, the limited subjects poets were allowed to write on, and the closed-off nature of Kyoto at this time, it is not surprising that different poets’ work would gradually begin to sound similar. Also, within Chinese methods of poetry writing which influenced Japanese poets, including someone else&#x27;s work within one&#x27;s own was seen as a tribute paid to another author, not an act of stealing.
There are differences in the ways scholars translate Shikishi&#x27;s poetry:

Here are Shikishi&#x27;s spring poems from Sequence A, translated by Sato.







A few of her other poems, not included in Sequences A, B, or C:

&quot;After resigning the vestal’s post at Kamo, on the Day of the Sacred Tree during the festival someone brought her a gift of &quot;aoi&quot; to offer her. She wrote on it:&quot;
&quot;Among the poems on “Love”:&quot;

&quot;Among the “Miscellaneous” poems:&quot;
== Recognition ==

Shikishi was recognized in fifteen out of twenty-one imperial anthologies. Fujiwara no Shunzei included nine of Shikishi&#x27;s works in the &quot;Senzai Wakashū&quot;, the seventh imperial anthology, containing 1,288 poems. The eighth imperial anthology, the &quot;Shin Kokin Wakashū&quot;, compiled shortly after her death, included forty-nine of her poems. 155 of her poems are incorporated throughout the seventh imperial anthology to the twenty-first.

<text>Felix Tikotin (12 October 1893 – 15 August 1986) was an architect, art collector, and founder of the first Museum of Japanese Art in the Middle East.

== Biography==
Felix Tikotin was born in Glogau, Germany to a Jewish family. His family was from the town of Tykocin. He grew up in Dresden and thought of studying art, but in the end became an architect. 
In World War I, he served as an officer in the German army, fighting first on the Western front in Belgium and later in the East. He was awarded the Iron Cross, 2nd Class. After the war, he travelled to Japan on the Trans-Siberia Express and fell in love with Japanese culture. In April 1927, he opened an art gallery in Berlin.

During World War II, Tikotin settled in the Netherlands. His two daughters were born in The Hague, where he operated a home gallery. After the invasion of the Nazis, the family moved away from the coast. When things became worse for the Jews, the Dutch Resistance helped find them hiding places. The family survived but Tikotin&#x27;s art collection, which had been hidden by his neighbours, was stolen.

After the war, Tikotin resumed his activities as a dealer in Japanese art. He held exhibitions all over Europe and the United States. In 1955 he organised the first overseas exhibition of the origami by Akira Yoshizawa (in the Stedelijk Museum of Amsterdam). He played an important role in introducing ikebana and other Japanese genres to the West.

When Tikotin first visited Israel in 1956, he decided that the major part of his collection belonged there. He helped to build an exhibition hall and bought the Kisch House in Haifa to house his art. The Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art opened in 1960.

<doc id="1340827" wikidata="Q888506" url="?curid=1340827" title="Bobby Collins (footballer)">
<text>Robert Young Collins (16 February 1931 – 13 January 2014) was a Scotland international football player, best known for his successful spells at Celtic, Everton and Leeds United.

==Playing career==
===Celtic===
Collins was born on 16 February 1931 in Govanhill, Glasgow, Scotland, the eldest of Tom and Bella Collins&#x27;s six children. He signed a contract with Everton from Pollok at the age of 17, but after a contractual dispute he eventually ended up joining Celtic instead of Everton; he was also working as an apprentice cobbler at the time. He made his debut at outside-right against Old Firm rivals Rangers on 13 August 1949, getting the better of Jock Shaw he helped Celtic to a 3–2 Scottish League Cup victory. Despite being just about tall, Collins was a strong, hard-working midfield player who was in the Celtic team as a 17-year-old and stayed there for ten years, winning the Scottish Cup in 1951, and the Scottish cup double in 1954. Affectionately known as the Wee Barra by Celtic fans, he was idolised by three generations of supporters. The grandfathers loved his throwback style of keeping the ball close, the dads loved his all-out action style and the kids just wanted to play like him. He was also called up for international duty in 1950, and maintained a frequent presence in the Scotland squad in the later stages of the decade. Collins also represented the Scottish League XI 16 times, scoring 12 goals.

===Everton===
In 1958 Collins joined Everton where he played until 1962.

===Leeds United===
Collins was an astute addition to the Leeds squad by manager Don Revie in 1962, helping the club avoid relegation. Revie later described Collins as his best-ever signing. Leeds won promotion to the First Division in 1964, and Collins captained the side towards a potential League and FA Cup double a year later; however, Leeds missed out on the League on goal average to Manchester United, and lost the 1965 FA Cup Final to Liverpool. Collins&#x27;s achievements at Leeds were recognised when he was awarded the Footballer of the Year title in 1965. His sparkling form at Leeds also won him a recall to the Scotland squad after a six-year absence, and he earned three more caps. His international career ended with 31 appearances and ten goals. Collins continued to skipper Leeds until 1966, when he suffered a horrific broken thighbone in a Fairs Cup tie against Torino. He briefly came back from the injury, but age and a struggle to reclaim previous form brought his Leeds career to an end.

===Later playing career===
Bury signed Collins and he stayed there for two years.

During a short period back in his native Scotland with Greenock Morton, he doubled up as a scout for Revie, and recommended Joe Jordan. Jordan went on to become a respected and feared striker with Leeds, Manchester United, Milan and Scotland. Collins&#x27; last appearance for Morton was in August 1971, in a pre-season friendly against his former club Leeds United.

In 1972 Collins was playing coach of Australian club Ringwood City but left after a disagreement with the club board.

He then had a spell as player-coach with Oldham.

Collins guested for Shamrock Rovers in a friendly with Manchester United at Dalymount Park on 15 October 1973 and signed for The Hoops the following month making his début on the 11th at Glenmalure Park. He played a total of 13 games, 11 in the league scoring once on his second appearance at Finn Harps.

==Managerial career==
Collins went into management, with spells at Huddersfield Town, Hull City and Barnsley. He also coached within the Leeds youth set-up in the 1970s and then again in the late 1990s.

<text>African Herbsman is a 1973 Trojan Records repackage of Bob Marley and the Wailers&#x27; 1971 album &quot;Soul Revolution Part II&quot; produced by Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, which had had a limited Jamaica only release. &quot;African Herbsman&quot; was released shortly after the band&#x27;s major-label debut album &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; had been released by Island Records.

The album differs from &quot;Soul Revolution Part II&quot; by adding five other tracks from the period. Four of the added tracks are non-album singles, including two of the group&#x27;s self-productions, &quot;Trenchtown Rock&quot; and &quot;Lively Up Yourself&quot;, as well as &quot;400 Years&quot; by Peter Tosh from the album &quot;Soul Rebels&quot;.

Several of the songs would later be re-recorded by Marley for his later albums; examples are &quot;Lively Up Yourself&quot; (on &quot;Natty Dread&quot;), &quot;Duppy Conqueror&quot;, &quot;Put It On&quot; and &quot;Small Axe&quot; (on &quot;Burnin&#x27;&quot;), and &quot;Sun Is Shining&quot; (on &quot;Kaya&quot;).

<text>Rodolphe Albert Millaire, CC, CQ (January 18, 1935 – August 15, 2018) was a Canadian actor and theatre director.

==Life==
Millaire was born in Montreal. He was raised by a single mother, after his father died when Millaire was less than a year old. He was first inspired to become an actor after seeing Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1948 film performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

Soon after completing his studies at the Conservatoire d&#x27;art dramatique de Montréal, Millaire became prominent on the Quebec theatre scene. He was particularly noted in performances in Alfred de Musset&#x27;s &quot;Lorenzaccio&quot;, Molière&#x27;s &quot;Tartuffe&quot; and &quot;Dom Juan&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and Roch Carrier&#x27;s &quot;La céleste bicyclette&quot;.

Millaire had worked behind the scenes at Montreal&#x27;s Théâtre du Nouveau-Monde, and had acted and directed in English at the Stratford Festival of Canada. His notable performances on television include such historical figures as Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville and Sir Wilfrid Laurier, as well a noted stage performance as Louis Riel. Although acting primarily in French, he was also sometimes seen in English roles, including &quot;Adventures in Rainbow Country&quot;, &quot;By Way of the Stars&quot; and &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;.

He had been chairman of the &quot;Académie québécoise de théâtre&quot; and the Canadian Council on the Status of the Artist.

He was married twice, first to Rita Imbault and later to television director Michèle Marchand.

Millaire died of cancer in Montreal on August 15, 2018, aged 83.

<doc id="1340832" wikidata="Q784107" url="?curid=1340832" title="West Bergholt">
<text>West Bergholt, formerly known as Bergholt Sackville, is a large rural village and civil parish in Essex, England, lying near the border with Suffolk, close to the ancient town of Colchester. With a history going back to medieval times the village is now part of the Colchester Borough Council seat of West Bergholt and Eight Ash Green. In 2008 the village won the Class 2 category, and was placed third overall in the &quot;Best Kept Village in Essex&quot; competition.

==Village==
The village lies in and around a triangle formed by Colchester Road, Chapel Road and Lexden Road.

Around the village lie numerous farms and large areas of woodland, including Hillhouse Wood, always known locally as Bluebell Wood, which was purchased by the Woodland Trust with the help of local people. Many walks exist through the wood, and a migrant population of various breeds of deer can sometimes be seen.

Elmer&#x27;s was the butcher shop. Digby&#x27;s was the name of the general store, which is now the East of England Co-operative Society. Mr Digby&#x27;s son drove a local bus service to Colchester.

==History==

===Prehistoric===
Prehistoric, Iron-Age, and Roman material from West Bergholt Hall, St. Mary&#x27;s church, and nearby sites suggest that the area may have been continuously settled. Scattered finds in the parish include several Palaeolithic axes from the heath, Iron-Age and Roman pottery and coins. There are large areas of undated cropmarks to the south of Hill House farm.

An archaeological dig carried out in 1977 found evidence of a Bronze Age cemetery just to the south of Chitts Hill Bridge. The dig found seven circular ditches, believed to be former central mounds, which contained cremation burials in urns, some upright. Ten cremations were found without urns and five were of children. Neolithic flints were discovered, representing scrapers, blades and cutting flakes. The pottery found dated the site to between 1500 and 1000 BC.

===The Normans===
The Normans reached the village in 1067, after their conquest of 1066. The village had already been named Bergholta by the Anglo-Saxons, meaning &quot;wood on a hill&quot; (the woodland in reference here is believed to be the modern Hillhouse Wood on the outskirts of the village). The village also already had a church, in the form of a wooden single-celled building on the site of the current &quot;Old Church&quot;, although was one of the least populous parishes in Lexden Hundred in the Middle Ages. The combined total of free tenants, unfree tenants, and slaves was 27 in 1066 and probably 32 in 1086. In 1377 only 105 inhabitants paid the poll tax.

Until the arrival of the Normans the village was split between two landowners: Leofwin Croz, Lord of the Manor, and Alfays Goding. They were replaced by Norman barons, Roger de Poitou and Richard fitz Gilbert. Roger de Poitou rebelled against the King Henry I in 1102, was banished to Normandy and his lands were removed. Richard fitz Gilbert was aligned with King Henry, and was allowed to retain his land.

===Bergholt Sackville===
The village changed its name to &quot;Bergholt Sackville&quot; in 1119 after Robert Sackville, son of Herband de Sackville, became Lord of the Manor. The Sackville family came to England during the time of the Norman Conquest and Robert was a member of the Royal Court and close friend of King Henry fighting for him at the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106. He was a religious man who became the first official rector of St. Mary&#x27;s Church and donated a estate in the village to St John&#x27;s Abbey of Colchester. This estate was run by the Almery Priest, who gave the profits from the running of the Almery Farm to the poor of the village. Over the years there has been a confusion in the name of this farm and it has now become commonly known as &quot;Armoury Farm&quot;. After the dissolution of the monasteries by King Henry VIII the estate was sold to Richard Duke in 1544, who was one of the civil servants responsible for administrating land seized by the King. However, the estate was finally brought back into the Sackville family by John Sackville in 1544.

Bergholt has not always managed to maintain good relations with the Crown. During the Reign of King John, Jordon Sackville got on the wrong side of the King (Jordon was a rebel Baron and said to be an assistant to one of the twenty-five &quot;Peeres of the Reamle&quot; to see the Magna Carta signed) and had all of his land removed, including the Bergholt Manor, even though his father and previous Lord of the Manor, Geoffrey Sackville, was knighted by John. However, fortune landed on Jordon&#x27;s side, as when King Henry III came to the throne in 1216 Jordon was granted all his land back. Although then his grandson, also called Jordon, assisted in the Barons&#x27; Revolt against King Henry III, claiming that he was not fit to rule the country in his 60s and was taken prisoner at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. However, as the King was a friend of his grandfather, he was pardoned after a year. Jordon&#x27;s heir, Andrew Sackville whose sonne and heire, named Andrew Sackuill, was underage at the time of his father&#x27;s death and was placed under the King&#x27;s Ward, was likewise imprisoned in Dover Castle. Nevertheless, by the special command of the King, he married an &quot;Honourable Ladie&quot; of the household to Queen, whereby he not only gained the King&#x27;s favour, but the greatest part of his inheritance, gaining the family&#x27;s land in East Sussex. He died before 1291 and Bergholt Hall passed to his son, another Andrew de Sackville. The second Andrew held the manor until his death in 1316 and was succeeded by his son, a third Andrew de Sackville, who, in 1347, was given free warden in Bergholt by Edward III, allowing him to kill game in his manor. He died in 1370, and Bergholt Hall passed to his widow Maud. During Andrew&#x27;s reign as Lord of the Manor Bergholt had become one of the poorest parishes in the Lexden Hundred by 1327 with the highest individual taxpayer be assessed being 7s. ½d, this was before the boom in the cloth industry which brought wealth to the village.

Maud married Edmund de la Pole, brother of Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, who took control of the Manor during her lifetime, but after her death in 1393 the manor passed to Sir Thomas Sackville, the son, possibly illegitimate, of Andrew de Sackville (d. 1370), as both of his legitimate half-brothers – Sir Andrew the younger (c. 1340–1366) and John – died in their father&#x27;s lifetime. However, this only occurred after an eight-month dispute as to whether he or the Sackvilles of Fawley were the rightful heirs.

Sir Thomas led quite an eventful life, from preventing the Duke of Lancaster, a newcomer to the landed gentry, from holding courts, poaching in the duchy parks and burning a commission issued under the Duke&#x27;s seal, to being temporarily imprisoned for abetting and harbouring murderers. He was luckily in good favour with the King&#x27;s favourite Sir James Burners, who got him a royal pardon. He was the MP for Sussex. During his time as Lord of the Manor, the local MP and Speaker of the House of Commons, John Doreward waived 200 marks that were owed to him from Parliament in returned to be granted with several royal licenses, to found a chantry in Stanway church, to augment the income of the chaplain at Bergholt and to alienate his manor of Tendring to St John&#x27;s Abbey in Colchester.

At the end of the 15th century the price of ale had become too high in the village and the Bergholt Sackville Manorial Court charged four brewers for charging too much for their beer, as it was an offence to charge above the fixed rate. The village ale tasters were also fined, as it was their responsibility to keep an eye on such matters.

Sir Thomas died in 1433 and the manor passed to his son Edward (d. 1450). He was succeeded by his son Humphrey (d. 1488) who left the estate to his son Richard (d. 1523). He was followed by his son John Sackville, Esq., Member of Parliament for East Grinstead and married to Margaret Boleyn, aunt of Anne Boleyn. John, unlike many of his ancestors, had lived in Essex, although it was most likely his other estate in Mount Bures, as he bequeathed sums to the poor there but not Bergholt. The manor then passed to John Sackville&#x27;s son, Sir Richard &quot;Fill-Sack&quot; Sackville, MP for Chichester, nicknamed by reason of his great wealth and the vast patrimony which he left to his son, created Baron Buckhurst in 1557. It is believed that Richard&#x27;s brother John Sackville (also MP for East Grinstead) intended to set up residence in the village, following in his father&#x27;s footsteps by living in Essex, as he bought the ‘Almarye&#x27; in Bergholt from Richard Duke, a fellow MP.

After his death in 1566 the manor was held in dower by his widow Winifred, who married Sir John Paulet, Marquess of Winchester (d. 1576). Richard&#x27;s son Thomas, who became Earl of Dorset, sold the reversion of the manor in 1571 to John Dister, who gained possession in 1575. This purchase was probably hoped by Dister to be a quite lucrative move with the village undergoing a population boom during this period, when baptisms were nearly double the burials, although some historians believe that many people most likely migrated to Colchester.

This was end of the Sackville family in the village, although they kept the right to appoint the Rectors of St Mary&#x27;s. The village name was not changed to West Bergholt until 1910.

By the 16th century, the village was involved in the booming cloth trade and many of the villagers were employed in removing the natural oils from the cloth and spinning wool. However, this prosperity was almost removed from the village by the 1557 Act of Parliament, which forbade the making or selling of any woollen cloth except in a market town. Thus, the local town of Colchester was unaffected, but Bergholt was not included as part of the town. Consequently, Bergholt allied with Bocking and Dedham and petitioned Parliament for a change in the law. They were successful in passing the &quot;Act for the Continuance of the Making of Woollen Clothe in Dyvers Townes in the Countie of Essex&quot;. This allowed the three villages, called towns in the act, to carry on their businesses providing they had been trading for seven or more years.

In 1565, Thomas Love, founder of Love&#x27;s Charity, died and left a sum of money to acquire land and rent it to the poor of the village, as he had received such a warm welcome when visiting the village during his lifetime.

===Trouble at the church===
Queen Elizabeth I had to step in twice to sort out problems with the village vicars. The first troublesome vicar was Reverend Edmund Tarrell, who was noted for spending too much time in the public houses and not enough time in the Church. The Queen had to intervene after it was reported that the vicar had failed to attend evensong and failing to give the last rites to a woman as he was in a Colchester pub and could not be found. His most serious offence, which he managed to escape, was not reading out King Henry VIII&#x27;s latest religious doctrine, which carried the penalty of death. Later in 1581 it was reported to the Queen by a member of the congregation that the village&#x27;s vicar, Reverend Richard Kyrby, refused to conduct the service in English after the introduction of her new Prayer Book, which he claimed should remain in Latin and that the Queen&#x27;s reforms were &quot;politically incorrect&quot;. Kyrby was tried for treason, which he denied. The case was dropped after the accuser backed down. Sixteen years later the Queen stepped in and had him removed.
Later on, to remind all the villagers who was king, King James I had his royal coat of arms painted in the Church. This coat of arms can still be seen to this day if one stands in the gallery and looks towards the altar. The motto on the arms reads &quot;Exurgat Deus Dissipenter Ininice&quot;, this is the opening line of Psalm 68 (Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered). Opposite James&#x27;s arms is a set of Hanoverian arms acquired in 1816.

There is evidence that the village was sympathetic towards the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War as Gregory Holland, inducted as vicar in 1613, was threatened with removal in 1644 as a royalist and conformist, and for ungodly behaviour. He was allowed to retain the living. However, in 1650, Reverend Gregory Holland was called before the &quot;Committee for Scandalous Ministers&quot; for preaching Royalist sermons during the Civil War, along with drunkenness and swearing in Church. His main offence was preaching royalist sermons and claiming that it was &quot;not fir got farmers and tradesmen to know the mystery of their salvation, but only for himself and such as he.&quot; The result of this hearing was that he was allowed to continue in his post as vicar at Bergholt, but that the parishioners elect him a curate, who would pay him the majority of his stipend. The curate chosen was nonconformist, Robert Billio. However, a group of parishioners were still not happy with the Rector&#x27;s views and in 1655 Samuel Skillingham, Mary Cooke and Jonathan Bundock, all waited until the end of the sermon before standing up and giving their view of what he preached and continued afterwards to talk about their own religious experiences, which was typical of Quakers of the time. They were imprisoned in Colchester Castle. Skillingham was also sued for Tithes along with Stephen Davy, John Child, John Crofier, Moses Davy and Daniel Bicknall, but the charges were dropped following the death of their prosecutors. However, Skillingham was later beaten with Zacky Child for attending a meeting at Wethersfield, while John Child had his horse taken from him.

During the Civil War, the Lord of Bergholt Manor was Sir John Denham, a poet and Royalist spy. He was exiled to Holland, along with the rest of the Royal Family, and because of his large gambling debts his property was sold to his political enemy Sir Harbottle Grimston, 2nd Baronet, Recorder and MP for Colchester.

 It was not only the vicars that were in trouble:a parishioner who in 1520 abused the rector in the pulpit, calling him a false, forsworn man, may have held Protestant views. In 1556 a member of the parish, Agnes George, part of the Stratford Martyrs, was out of favour with Queen Mary, for refusing to attend church until the service was no longer conducted in the Roman Catholic tradition. She was then tried before the Bishop of London, Reverend Edmund Bonner, along with 12 others. During her time at Newgate Prison she wrote a letter attacking the Pope for being the Anti-Christ, saying that she was baptised in Christ&#x27;s Church not Rome and refusing to believe that bread and wine became the body and blood of Christ. She was burned at Stratford before 20,000 people. In 1879, a large monument was erected in St John&#x27;s churchyard in Stratford Broadway, to commemorate the thirteen and others who were executed or tortured in Stratford during the persecutions.

Agnes&#x27;s husband Richard, a labourer, was also arrested in 1557. He escaped execution but his second wife, Christine, was also burnt, this time for heresy, along with two others from North Essex. They too were sentenced by Edmund Bonner, who claimed that they were &quot;a spirited danger to other Christians&quot; and a hazard to the state because they believed in redistribution of wealth. They were held in the Colchester Castle dungeon until 26 May 1558 when they were executed in front of a large crowd outside Moot Hall on the High Street. This was not the end of the saga for the George family.

In another hunt for heretics in the parishes of North Essex, twenty-two Protestants, including Richard George, were interrogated at Colchester and were sent to London, bound in chains and rope, for trial. One woman in the group was set free at Chelmsford after agreeing to convert to the Roman Catholic Church. Witness accounts claimed that the rest of the group had ample opportunity to escape and were treated quite well. They were tried at Edmound Bonner&#x27;s house, where the group took the opportunity to ask the crowd attending to convert to Protestantism.

Bonner asked his agents to try to persuade the group to recant but the agents informed him that they were too &quot;desperate and obstinate&quot;. Bonner, fearing that sending too many to the stake would cause unrest and maybe riots, came up with a compromise of a &quot;confession of faith&quot; that pleased both Catholics and Protestants, which they all signed. The group were then set free to make their own way back to Essex. Alas, Richard George, and his wife, were rearrested for his attitude towards Roman Catholics and imprisoned in Colchester Castle. In a fortunate turn of events for the Georges, Queen Elizabeth was crowned during their imprisonment and ended the persecution of Protestants. They were set free.

===The King&#x27;s Wrath===
In 1540, the son of John Abell, Lord of the Manor of Cooks Hall, Bergholt, was executed at Smithfield on the orders of King Henry VIII.
Thomas Abell who was brought up at Cooks Hall in the village, was chaplain to Henry&#x27;s first wife, Catherine of Aragon, whom the King wanted to divorce to marry Anne Boleyn. Henry claimed that when he married Catherine, he had broken God&#x27;s law and the marriage was invalid. On a secret mission to Spain, the Queen&#x27;s chaplain sought to destroy the King&#x27;s case for divorce and back in England, he argued against the King both in print and from the pulpit – with the inevitable result. After seven years in the Tower of London he was sentenced to &quot;be drawn on a hurdle to the place of execution, there to be hanged, cut down alive, your members to be cut off and cast in the fire, your bowels burnt before your eyes, your head smitten off, your body to be quartered at the King&#x27;s will, and God have mercy on your soul.&quot; There is still to be seen on the wall of his prison in the Tower of London a rebus consisting of the symbol of a bell with an A upon it and the name Thomas above, which he carved during his confinement. He was beatified by Pope Leo XIII as one of a group of fifty-four English Martyrs on 29 December 1886.

===Development of modern Bergholt===
1725 is the first year that records of the village&#x27;s largest pub appear – &quot;The White Hart&quot;, which is still in use today, although frequent fines for unlicensed brewing, breaking the assize of ale, and permitting the playing of illegal games such as tennis, suggest that several alehouses existed in the later 15th and earlier 16th centuries. Alehouses were licensed in 1576, 1580, and 1608, although an unlicensed one owned by a collar-maker was suppressed in 1618. There were three unlicensed alehouses or beerhouses in 1644.

The White Hart was a popular meeting place for farmers taking sheep and cattle to market, which caused the creation of the cluster of buildings known as &quot;the Crescent&quot; next to the pub. The Crescent contained four buildings: Anerly, Bascete, the Wheelwright&#x27;s and the Blacksmith&#x27;s shop, which original parts of can still be seen, although are all residential houses now. The Anerley was formerly known as &quot;The Crown and Sceptre Brewery&quot; and the Bascete used to contain a chapel at the rear of the building.

====The Brewery====

The Daniell family had lived in Colchester since 1509 and were freemen of the town. The first member of the family to start brewing was Thomas Daniel during the 18th century, who produced beer for the workers on his farm. The beer was such a favourite with the men that he started selling it around the village and local area and in 1859 expanded the operation to two new breweries run by his two sons. The firm went from strength to strength and became a public company in 1886, with a value of £30,000. The biggest event for the firm was to have Osmond Orpen marry into the family, who was known as the greatest brewer in England and became the Daniells&#x27; head brewer before moving on to be managing director.

This had a great impact on the village. Not only did it create more jobs and help expand the village but Osmond also ran the parish council and was overseer of the poor. In his will he, along with Lorkin Daniell, gave the land and money for the building of the village hall (Orpen Memorial Hall) and surrounding land (Lorkin Daniell Playing Field). The rapid growth of the village also encouraged service trades and building. Grocers, butchers, bakers, coopers, poulterers, and dealers in tea and fruit were established by 1851, and increased in number in later decades. Alfred Diss, builder of the new Methodist Chapel (1878), Ebeneezer Villas (1884), and possibly the small Gothic Cottages (1880s), employed 9 carpenters, 9 bricklayers, and 8 labourers in 1881. Fluctuations in the building industry were thought to have contributed to serious unemployment in the village in 1912. However, one of the most lasting improvements to the village from the legacy of the brewery was the instalment of mains water during the 1930s and then sewage and waste water disposal systems in the mid-1950s. Prior to this the village was supplied by a series of shallow wells (many of which still remain, although bricked up under the village&#x27;s more modern housing estates), although there were three springs which fed public ponds at the Queen&#x27;s Head, on Lexden Road, and near the White Hart, and there was a deep well at the brewery. An additional public well at the top of Newbridge Hill was closed in 1896 because its water was unfit for drinking.

The brewery suffered losses in 1958 and was forced to sell to Truman, Hanbury, Buxton and Co Ltd, who took over the brewery and its 150 tied houses, including the Treble Tile and Queen&#x27;s Head in West Bergholt. Trumans used the Brewery as a bottling plant and later as transport depot until it was converted into flats in 1989.

====Enclosure and fire raising====
Moving back to the 1840s, the village was being dramatically changed by the agricultural revolution. The two largest impacts on the village were enclosure and the introduction of machines into the farming process.
In the early 16th century overgrazing affected areas of both Bergholt and Cooks Hall Common, upon which the tenants of both manors shared. In 1575-6 neither unmarried tenants nor under-tenants of Cooks Hall manor were allowed to feed more than four sheep or any cattle on that manor&#x27;s common. In 1587 and 1619 Bergholt Hall manor court forbade any tenant without a house and family to graze cattle on that manor&#x27;s common. Overseers, rangers or drivers, of that common, first recorded in 1632, were in 1651 instructed to drive the heath at least three times a year and to impound illegally grazed cattle.

Encroachment on the heath apparently began in the earlier 17th century when cottages began to be illegally erected on both the Bergholt Hall manor and Cooks Hall manor wastes. By the mid 18th century many encroachments were sanctioned as long as they were registered in the manor courts. Although a few 18th-century intakes were large additions to existing freeholds or copyholds, many were occupied by small cottages or shops; other encroachments included one for a barn, another for a brick kiln, and a third for a house, but most were small and the heath was still largely unenclosed in 1777.

Enclosure happened in Bergholt in 1865, during which the Heath was divided into new areas. The old track ways and footpaths were closed and several new roads were laid out, the most important becoming Chapel Road. of land was given to the poor for allotments and a further for recreation (commonly known in the village as the &quot;Poor&#x27;s Field&quot;). This land was held in trust by the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor. The maximum amount of land a single man was allowed to cultivate, without disturbance to his daily work, was ten rod measurements, which is still in use today.

A third area was set aside for a new church and graveyard, as the church was too far from the centre of the modern village, and this, it was claimed, was the cause of the low attendance. The remaining area of the land was left as the Heathlands, where villagers were able to graze their goats.

The land hand-out was carried out under the provisions of the &quot;Acts of Enclosure, Exchange and Improvement of Land&quot;. There were intended to produce the most economical use of the Heath, although largely disregarded the rights of commoners. The plan was produced by Charles Horror and approved by the Enclosure Commissioners. The plan also contained land set aside for three village ponds (&quot;public wells&quot;); one for Lexden Road, Chapel Road and outside the White Hart, although the latter has been filled in since the 1950s. The only opposition apparently came from gypsies camping on the heath.

The agricultural revolution was not all good news for Bergholt. Many farm labourers had been left unemployed after the dip in the agricultural trade following the war with France in 1815. and the new Poor Law. Thus, the introduction of machines only made matter worse. The result was groups of vagabonds emerging in the countryside threatening social order, who were described at the time as &quot;masterless men.&quot; In 1842 the village witnessed the earliest signs of violence from the protesters, which led the village to become the epicentre of protest in North Essex. Their main form of protest was fire raising. Among the victims were Robert Bradbrook and Thomas Daniell, two of the most important farmers and businessmen.

One of the first fires occurred in 1843 at Hightrees Farm, which killed a horse, a calf and several poultry, as well as burning away worth of hay and damaging the farmhouse. It is claimed that the fire could be seen from Colchester, where a large crowd gathered on North Hill. This was the first of many fires. The Police had trouble tracking down the perpetrators as many in the village were sympathetic towards them. However, in 1843 Robert Woodward was found guilty of fire raising after an undercover policeman in the White Hart and his lover came forward with evidence. He was sentenced to transportation for life to Australia.

During this period the village Cricket Club was founded on its original location to the west of the brewery. The first recorded cricket match in the village was a decade earlier between the Gentlemen of Essex and the Gentlemen of Norfolk played over three days commencing on 15 July 1831. The &quot;Essex County Standard&quot; reported that although the bad weather effected the amount of cricket that could be played, with delays on the first two days, there was considerable interest in the game. Essex won by 89 runs. By the 1940s the club had moved to its current location on Manor Road.

A football club was not formed in the village until 1911. it was nicknamed &quot;The Brewers&quot;, and played mostly friendlies using the cricket ground as a pitch. The current West Bergholt FC was founded in 1938 and became stable enough to maintain membership of a league, playing on its current location of the Memorial Field. The first success of the club came in 1981 winning the Border League Division 2.

====Education====

The village by the 19th century already had a fee-paying school, but nothing for the poor. The vicar at the time, Reverend William Sims, had already applied to the Church of England for funding for the building of a school for the poor, but by 1833 he had raised only £55 of the £300 needed and appealed again. By then the village had grown in numbers and more money was needed for a larger school than originally planned. However, William Sims died before he could see the fruits of his labour. Fortunately the next vicar, his son, Frederick Sims, was able to raise £400 by public subscription. The school was built on the Heath and two cottages were made alongside it: one for the schoolmaster and his wife and the other to be let out with the rent going towards the upkeep of the school. The school was initially built to accommodate 200 pupils, and the opening ceremony was held at the parish church during the Sunday Eucharist.

==Governance==
West Bergholt is part of the electoral ward called West Bergholt and Eight Ash Green. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 5,074.

==The buildings==

There is now only one active church, St. Mary&#x27;s Anglican Church. West Bergholt Methodist Church is no longer active and has recently been sold. The village has a third church, not used for regular services, which is also called St. Mary&#x27;s. Several legends exist about the church and its history. Locally called &quot;St Marys&#x27; Old Church&quot;, it used to be in the centre of the village, but as time passed the village grew away from it. While no longer in regular use, it remains consecrated and it is maintained by the Churches Conservation Trust. Like many churches it has evolved over the years. Parts date from the 11th century and the astute observer will find reused Roman bricks in its fabric, and ancient graffiti from pilgrims who have visited over the years. It is positioned at the end of what is little more than a farm track in the East Anglian countryside, and on the Essex Way long-distance footpath. It stands in a small graveyard that features a headstone with a death&#x27;s head design.

==Village life==

The village is home to two public houses and a social club: the White Hart and the Queens Head and West Bergholt Social Club.

===Religion===
The village has three active churches, St Mary&#x27;s Anglican church and the Methodist church have their own buildings while the Pentecostal Fellowship meets at the Orpen Hall

==Transport==
West Bergholt is served by a number of bus services.

<doc id="1340833" wikidata="Q567692" url="?curid=1340833" title="Anoraknophobia">
<text>Anoraknophobia is the 12th studio album by the British rock band Marillion, released in 2001. It is regarded as the first instance of a music recording completely financed by fans in a then-unique fundraising campaign, as 12,674 copies were pre-ordered before the album was even recorded.

In an attempt to depart from their neo-prog past for a contemporary sound, Marillion introduced elements of rap, groove, funk, trip hop, blues, jazz and dub. Although the album received several favourable reviews, it was not a significant commercial success, and its sole single, &quot;Between You and Me&quot;, did not chart. The group supported &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; with a six-month European tour.

==Background==
In February 1997, when Marillion prepared for a European tour in support of their ninth studio album, &quot;This Strange Engine&quot;, Mark Kelly announced on the Internet that the group would not visit North America due to insufficient support from their American record label, Red Ant. Then, devoted fans launched a fundraising drive and raised $50,000 to help their favourite band cross the Atlantic. Alliance Entertainment, Red Ant&#x27;s parent company, filed for bankruptcy in July and tried to sell the label. As a result, an additional $15,000 (money that would have come from Red Ant) was raised for a 21-date North American tour, the band&#x27;s largest since 1991. The whole idea, known as crowdfunding, was conceived and realised by fans without any involvement from the band, and although music lovers had always backed their favorite performers in various ways, such a successful Internet campaign was unprecedented.

After releasing &quot;marillion.com&quot; in October 1999, Marillion had completed a three-album contract with Castle Communications. Although a number of independent labels were interested in signing the band, its members wanted to have total control of their music and still be able to use distribution facilities of a major record company. This could only be achieved if the money to create an album was obtained from a different source, and Marillion found an unusual solution, crowdfunding.
As they had already learnt of the dedication of the fanbase which had underwritten the North American tour, the band sent e-mails to over 30,000 people who subscribed to their website, asking whether they would buy an unrecorded album. Within two days there were around 6,000 positive replies; ultimately, 12,674 copies were pre-ordered. The process raised more than £150,000 (£ in 2015 pounds), more than an advance the band might have received from an ordinary record contract. A worldwide marketing and distribution deal was concluded with EMI, and the album would be released for retail by their Liberty Records imprint.

This innovative pre-order venture was unexpectedly successful. &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; is claimed by Marillion to have been the first crowdfunded album in the music industry.

==Recording==

&quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; was written, recorded and mixed at Marillion&#x27;s own Racket Club studio in Buckinghamshire, England, for the whole of 2000 and early 2001. To work on the album, the band chose Dave Meegan who had previously been an assistant engineer on &quot;Fugazi&quot; (1984) and had produced their last two recordings with EMI, &quot;Brave&quot; (1994) and &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; (1995). Stewart Every assisted at mixing of the album.

Bassist Pete Trewavas, said the band had not had any tracks left over from previous sessions which could have been used, so the entire album was written &quot;from scratch&quot;. Since they had been unfashionable in the eyes of the media and had been largely ignored by the music press, Marillion deliberately attempted to create a modern sound and distance themselves further from their neo-prog past. In an interview with the BBC, Hogarth spoke about the band&#x27;s new musical direction and the album&#x27;s diverse influences: &quot;With this album there&#x27;s been a massive invasion of black influence–there&#x27;s rap, there&#x27;s groove, there&#x27;s funk, there&#x27;s trip hop, blues, jazz, dub.&quot; Thus, the songs &quot;Between You and Me&quot; and &quot;Map of the World&quot; have drawn comparisons to U2, while the nine-minute &quot;Quartz&quot;, which contains a rap section, has been compared to the sound of Massive Attack.

All the samples in &quot;Separated Out&quot; were taken from Tod Browning&#x27;s horror film &quot;Freaks&quot; (1932). The line &quot;Freaks!... Freaks!... Freaks!&quot; at the ending of the track was used as a reference to Marillion&#x27;s fans who sometimes refer to themselves as &quot;freaks&quot; after a Fish-era B-side. The phrase &quot;She was only dreaming&quot; in the song &quot;If My Heart Were a Ball It Would Roll Uphill&quot; is a sample from &quot;Chelsea Monday&quot;.

According to Hogarth, the title, nominally a play on the word &quot;arachnophobia&quot;, or fear of spiders, means no fear of anoraks (&quot;anorak no phobia&quot;), referring to the long-running in-joke that Marillion fans are also sometimes called anoraks. The artwork for &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; as well as some other related music releases and press materials feature cartoon graphics of a boy named Barry who wears a rain parka. Inside the liner notes for the pre-order edition of the album, there is a photograph of each of the band members posed in a similar manner and standing near a telephone box.

==Release==
All who pre-ordered &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; received a special 48-page digibook edition with a bonus enhanced disc. Those who pre-ordered before a set date also got their names printed in the booklet. First copies of the album were sent out on 23 April 2001, and since the end of the pre-order campaign the special edition has not been in print. The bonus disc contains the song &quot;Number One&quot; which has not been released. At one point considered for the album, it was put aside because it did not match the rest of the recording sonically. The standard edition of &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; was released on 7 May 2001 through Liberty Records. As part of a series of Marillion reissues on the Madfish label, a division of Snapper Music, &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; was re-released in 2012 in two variants: 1) compact disc packaged in a deluxe digibook featuring extra artwork, and 2) double heavyweight (180gm) vinyl in a gatefold sleeve.

The album was ineligible to chart in the UK for two reasons. First, its pre-order sales were direct through the band&#x27;s website and as such could not be counted independently; second, the retail version contained a sticker of Barry within the jewel case. This was considered a gift that might serve as an inducement to buy the album, even though purchasers would not be aware of its inclusion until they opened the album. In mainland Europe, &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; was not a chart success and has stayed among the lowest selling albums in the Marillion catalogue.

Prior to the album 23 February 2001, an edited version of &quot;This is the 21st Century&quot; was made available free for download on MP3.com, and was downloaded enough to achieve No.1 in the alternative chart.

The only single from the album, a double A-side &quot;Between You and Me&quot; / &quot;Map of the World&quot;, was released on 10 September 2001 and did not chart. It was available exclusively via the band&#x27;s website and was sold with an additional free copy along with a letter and biography provided by Marillion. The fans who bought the single were asked to pass the free copy to their local radio stations to encourage its airplay. Radio edits of the two songs were used in April 2001 as a two-track promo sampler.

===&quot;Remixomatosis&quot;===
In 2003, Marillion launched an experimental contest to remix the content of the album and the song &quot;Number One&quot;. Anyone interested could buy a copy of the master tapes and rebuild the tracks at one&#x27;s own discretion. Selected winners from over 500 participants were awarded a cash prize and their remixes were included on a double album which was released in August 2004 by Racket Records as &quot;Remixomatosis&quot;.

==Critical reception==

As Marillion had constantly met the hostility of the music press, in a press release for &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot;, Hogarth said:


AllMusic reviewer Andrew Hamlin criticised the band for &quot;high &#x27;pricing&#x27; of their new project&quot; and called the above-mentioned &quot;challenge&quot; imperious. He has admitted that &quot;this odd poise of seeming to snap on feeding fingers carries over to the record on several levels&quot;. Philip Wilding of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine rated the album four stars out of five and described it as &quot;a collection full of grace and tenacity, thoughtful and thought provoking and not without moments of real clarity and beauty&quot;. Hogarth was complimented for his vocals which had &quot;rarely sounded better&quot;. In the opinion of Catherine Chambers from &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine, it was shocking that &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot;, conjuring up &quot;a pretty contemporary feel with its classy mix of blues, country, and even trip-hop stylings&quot; proved to be &quot;actually pretty damn good&quot; after Marillion had delivered many poorly received recordings. Stuart Maconie was more critical of the album in his review for &quot;Q&quot; magazine, awarding it just two stars out of five. He wrote: &quot;Steve Hogarth is way funkier than Fish but the tone is still as arch and self-important as a lower-sixth poetry mag&quot;. He praised &quot;Between You and Me&quot;, comparing it favourably with Crowded House and U2, but criticised the band for musical self-indulgence, especially on the 11-minute &quot;This is the 21st Century&quot;. Maconie concluded: &quot;Clearly Marillion can play. If only they wouldn&#x27;t play so much of it&quot;.

==Tour==
To promote the album, Marillion immediately launched their &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; tour across Europe. Lasting from 4 May until 26 October 2001, and including 39 performances, it consisted of the spring leg (from 4 May to 6 June, 16 concerts), appearances at two summer festivals in Switzerland (21 and 22 June), and the autumn leg (from 15 September to 26 October, 21 concerts). Recordings drawn from three UK shows in May were documented on the live album &quot;Anorak in the UK&quot; (2002). For the October leg of the tour, the band held a vote, asking fans what they would like to hear played. The final set lists were largely based on the results.

===Marillion Weekend 2015===
&quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; was played live in its entirety during Friday night shows of the Marillion Weekend 2015 events, which took place in the Netherlands, the UK, and Canada. In November 2016, three separate 2-CD albums commemorating the concerts recorded at Center Parcs village Port Zelande in the Netherlands during 20–22 March 2015 were released. The Blu-Ray and DVD sets &quot;Out of the Box&quot; hit the stores a month later.

<doc id="1340846" wikidata="Q4812204" url="?curid=1340846" title="Asynchronous learning">
<text>Asynchronous learning is a general term used to describe forms of education, instruction, and learning that do not occur in the same place or at the same time. It uses resources that facilitate information sharing outside the constraints of time and place among a network of people. In many instances, well-constructed asynchronous learning is based on constructivist theory, a student-centered approach that emphasizes the importance of peer-to-peer interactions. This approach combines self-study with asynchronous interactions to promote learning, and it can be used to facilitate learning in traditional on-campus education, distance education, and continuing education. This combined network of learners and the electronic network in which they communicate are referred to as an asynchronous learning network.

Online learning resources that can be used to support asynchronous learning include email, electronic mailing lists, threaded conferencing systems, online discussion boards, wikis, and blogs. Course management systems have been developed to support online interaction, allowing users to organize discussions, post and reply to messages, and upload and access multimedia. These asynchronous forms of communication are sometimes supplemented with synchronous components, including text and voice chat, telephone conversations, videoconferencing, and even meetings in virtual spaces such as &quot;Second Life&quot;, where discussions can be facilitated among groups of students.

==History==
The roots of asynchronous learning are in the end of the 19th century, when formalized correspondence education (or distance learning) first took advantage of the postal system to bring physically remote learners into the educational fold. The 1920s and 1930s saw the introduction of recorded audio, desynchronizing broadcasting and revolutionizing the mass dissemination of information. The first significant distribution of standardized educational content took place during World War II; the branches of the US military produced hundreds of training films, with screenings numbering in the millions.

Online asynchronous learning began with schools&#x27; and universities&#x27; substantial investment in computer technology in the early 1980s. With seminal applications such as Seymour Papert&#x27;s Logo programming language, students were able to learn at their own pace, free from the synchronous constraints of a classroom lecture. As computers entered more households and schools began connecting to the nascent Internet, asynchronous learning networks began to take shape. These networks augmented existing classroom learning and led to a new correspondence model for solitary learners.

Using the web, students could access resources online and communicate asynchronously using email and discussion boards. The 1990s saw the arrival of the first telecampuses, with universities offering courses and entire degree plans through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous online instruction. Today, advanced multimedia and interactivity have enhanced the utility of asynchronous learning networks and blurred the divide between content-creator and content-consumer. New tools like class blogs and wikis are creating ever-richer opportunities for further asynchronous interaction and learning.

==Development of an asynchronous community==
Though the social relationships integral to group learning can be developed through asynchronous communication, this development tends to take longer than in traditional, face-to-face settings. The establishment of an asynchronous community takes time and effort and tends to follow a projected course of five stages, as described by Waltonen-Moore et al.:

# Introductions – This might include a full biography or a short &quot;getting-to-know-you&quot; questions. Through this step, community members begin to see one another as human beings and begin to make a preliminary, emotive connection with the other members of the community. This step is often characterized by emotive or extravagant language and represents group members&#x27; attempts to make themselves known as living individuals behind the emotionless technology medium.
# Identify with the group – Members begin to communicate with one another by reference to their commonalities as group members and seek to either establish or make known norms for successful membership. If this sense of group identity is not established, the likelihood of poor participation or attrition increases.
# Interact – Members will start interacting with one another in reference to the community&#x27;s established focus and begin to share information with one another. If the community is an online learning course, then students will begin to discuss course content.
# Group cohesion and individual reflection – members of the group will begin to validate one another&#x27;s ideas and opinions while, at the same time, being reflective of their own.
# Expansive questioning – Now feeling completely comfortable within the environment, focused upon the content, and respectful of other group members&#x27; thoughts and experiences, members will begin to not only post facts and deeply held beliefs, but will actually start to &quot;think out loud&quot;, allowing other group members to take part in their personal meaning-making and self-directed inquiry.

Asynchronous communities that progress efficiently through these stages tend to share at least three common attributes:

First, the community has an active facilitator who monitors, guides, and nurtures the discourse. Unguided communities tend to have difficulty progressing beyond the second stage of development, because group members can become distracted from the community&#x27;s intended purpose.

Second, rather than seeking to take on the role of an instructor or disseminator of knowledge, the facilitator recognizes that knowledge is an individual construct that is developed through interaction with other group members. Thus, facilitators within successful communities tend not to be pedantic, but supportive.

And third, successful asynchronous communities permit a certain amount of leniency for play within their discourse. That is, communities that insist upon being overly stringent on etiquette and make no room for the social development that comes from play seem to drive away participants. Rather than enriching discourse on the targeted topic, such attitudes have a negative impact on group identity development and individual comfort levels which will, in turn, decrease overall involvement.

==Roles of instructors and learners==
Online learning requires a shift from a teacher-centered environment to a student-centered environment where the instructor must take on multiple new roles. The constructivist theory that supports asynchronous learning demands that instructors become more than dispensers of knowledge; it requires that they become instructional designers, facilitators, and assessors of both grades and their teaching methods.

As instructional designers, emphasis is placed on establishing the curriculum, methods and the media through which the content will be effectively delivered. Once the design is in place and executed, the instructor must then facilitate the communication and direct the learning. Instructors typically have to be proficient with elements of electronic communication, as asynchronous courses are reliant on email and discussion board communications and the instruction methods are reliant on virtual libraries of e-documents, graphics, and audio files. Establishing a communal spirit is vital, requiring much time commitment from the instructor, who must spend time reading, assessing, reinforcing, and encouraging the interaction and learning that is happening.

The student-centered nature of asynchronous online learning requires students to be actively involved with and take more responsibility for their own learning. In addition to their normal duties as learners, students are required to:

* Become proficient with the technology required for the course;
* Use new methods of communication with both peers and instructors;
* Strengthen their interdependency through collaboration with their peers.

==Strengths==

Asynchronous learning&#x27;s greatest benefit to students is the freedom it gives them to access the course and its instructional materials at any time they choose, and from any location, with an Internet connection. This allows for accessibility for diverse student populations, ranging from traditional, on-campus students, to working professionals, to international students in foreign countries.

Asynchronous learning environments provide a &quot;high degree of interactivity&quot; between participants who are separated both geographically and temporally and afford students many of the social benefits of face-to-face interaction. Since students can express their thoughts without interruption, they have more time to reflect on and respond to class materials and their classmates than in a traditional classroom.

Research shows that the time required to initially design an asynchronous course is comparable to that of a traditional synchronous course. However, most asynchronous courses have the potential to reach far more students than a traditional course and course-wide updates or modifications can be disseminated far more quickly and efficiently than traditional lecture models.

Schifter notes that a perceived additional workload is a significant barrier to faculty participation in distance education and asynchronous learning, but that perception can be mitigated through training and experience with teaching in these environments.

Another advantage of asynchronous learning (and, as technology develops, many synchronous learning environments) is that there is a record of nearly everything that occurs in that environment. All materials, correspondence, and interactions can be electronically archived. Participants can go back and review course materials, lectures, and presentations, as well as correspondence between participants. This information is generally available at any time to course participants.

==Shortcomings==
Asynchronous learning environments pose several challenges for instructors, institutions, and students. Course development and initial setup can be costly. Institutions must provide a computer network infrastructure, including servers, audio/visual equipment, software, and the technical support needed to develop and maintain asynchronous learning environments. Technical support includes initial training and setup, user management, data storage and recovery, as well as hardware repairs and updates. Research indicates faculty members who are hesitant to teach in asynchronous learning environments are so because of a lack of technical support provided by their institutions. However, for faculty to teach successfully in an asynchronous learning environment, they must be technically adept and comfortable enough with the technological tools to optimize their use. According to a recent case study in India, asynchronous learning during COVID-19 pandemic is quite stressful among students because it placed more responsibilities and made students feel frustrated and insecure.

To participate in asynchronous learning environments, students must also have access to computers and the Internet. Although personal computers and web access are becoming more and more pervasive every day, this requirement can be a barrier to entry for many students and instructors. Students must also have the computer/technology skills required to participate in the asynchronous learning program.

<doc id="1340855" wikidata="Q679359" url="?curid=1340855" title="High Tauern">
<text>The High Tauern (pl.; , ) are a mountain range on the main chain of the Central Eastern Alps, comprising the highest peaks east of the Brenner Pass. The crest forms the southern border of the Austrian states of Salzburg, Carinthia and East Tyrol, with a small part in the southwest belongs to the Italian province of South Tyrol. The range includes Austria&#x27;s highest mountain, the Grossglockner at above the Adriatic.

In the east, the range is adjoined by the Lower Tauern. For the etymology of the name, see Tauern.

==Geography==
According to the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps, the range is bounded by the Salzach valley to the north (separating it from the Kitzbühel Alps), the Mur valley and the Murtörl Pass to the east (separating it from the Lower Tauern), the Drava valley to the south (separating it from the Southern Limestone Alps), and the Birnlücke Pass to the west (separating it from the Zillertal Alps).

Its most important subgroups along the Alpine crest are (from West to East):

* Venediger Group (including Grossvenediger, , and Lasörling, )
* Granatspitze Group (Großer Muntanitz, , and Granatspitze, )
* Glockner Group (Grossglockner, )
* Goldberg Group (Hoher Sonnblick, )
* Ankogel Group (Hochalmspitze, , Ankogel, ) and Reisseck Group (Reisseck, )
The eastern end of the High Tauern is formed by the Hafner massif of the Ankogel Group, which includes the easternmost three-thousander peaks in the Alpine chain.

Further parts of the High Tauern south of the main crest of the Alps are (from West to East):
* Rieserferner Group (Hochgall, )
* Villgraten Mountains (Weiße Spitze, )
* Schober Group (including the Petzeck, and Hochschober, )
* Kreuzeck Group (Mölltaler Polinik, )

==High Tauern National Park==

Along of the main chain stretches the High Tauern National Park (&quot;Nationalpark Hohe Tauern&quot;), to which the Austrian Alpine Club as freeholder and the three states of Carinthia, Salzburg and Tyrol have contributed territory. With an area of about , it is by far the largest of Austria&#x27;s seven national parks as well as the largest nature reserve in the Alps. It is divided into a core zone of including the Grossglockner and Grossvenediger massifs, with complete prohibition of agricultural use, and a fringe zone of used for forestry and alpine-meadow farming. Five special nature sanctuaries are protected from any human disturbance.

The park of the IUCN II category comprises the Pasterze and numerous further glaciers, the Krimml Waterfalls, several glacial valleys and alluvial fans, as well as extended tundra areas and forests. Among the flora of the Alps, especially Swiss Pines grow along the tree line; above subshrub, mainly alpenrose but also the endemic &quot;Saxifraga rudolphiana&quot;, up to nival level at about 2,800 m (9,200 ft). The fauna includes chamois, Alpine ibex and red deer, as well as griffon vulture and the golden eagle. The formerly extinct bearded vulture and the Alpine marmot have been successfully reintroduced.

The park was established according to a 1971 declaration signed by the participating states at Heiligenblut, it nevertheless took until 1981, when the first parts around Großglockner and Hochschober in Carinthia were put under protection. The adjacel finally joined in 1992. Touriut has become less harmful to the environment. A particular emphasis is pution and the maintenance of traditional ways of life in the Alps.

==Peaks==


The main peaks of the High Tauern are:
==Tunnels and passes==

The High Tauern are crossed by three tunnels:
*Tauern Railway Tunnel between Bad Gastein and Mallnitz, finished in 1906
*Katschberg Tunnel on &quot;A10&quot; Tauern Autobahn (European route E55) leading from Sankt Michael im Lungau and the Tauern Road Tunnel to Rennweg
*Felbertauerntunnel on &quot;B108&quot; Felbertauern Straße highway, between Mittersill and Matrei in Osttirol

The best-known mountain pass road of the High Tauern is the scenic Grossglockner High Alpine Road inaugurated in 1935, including a tunnel at an elevation of under the Hochtor Pass (). East of it, the Katschberg Pass () on &quot;B 99&quot; Katschberg Straße highway parallel to the Katschberg Tunnel links Sankt Michael and Rennweg. Another road crosses the Staller Sattel between Sankt Jakob in Defereggen and Rasen-Antholz at .

Beside there are numerous bridle and footpaths, in part used since ancient times:

<text>Meulaboh (, Jawoë: ملابوه; or Moulabouh) is the capital of West Aceh Regency, Indonesia.

== Geography ==

Meulaboh is about 245 km southeast of Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh province. Meulaboh is located in the western part of Sumatra island.

== 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake event ==

&quot;The casualty rates in gabrielius defy imagination,&quot; said Aitor Lacomba, Indonesian director of aid group International Rescue Committee. &quot;Tens of thousands need immediate assistance there.&quot;

A damaged airstrip was cleared, enabling International Red Cross medical teams from Japan, Spain and Singapore to begin treating survivors. Red Cross engineer Sara Escudero said &quot;There is a strong smell of putrefaction and, whilst body retrieval has commenced, it can be assumed that there are still hundreds, possibly thousands of bodies remaining underneath the debris&quot;.

The Red Cross said it would use Meulaboh as an aid staging post for the Sumatran west coast. The government of Singapore deployed two helicopter landing ships there.

The town was largely devastated, with around 81 percent of buildings destroyed and at least 10,000 dead out of the town&#x27;s population of 50-60 thousand. Only 23,000 people could be accounted for a week after the tsunami, although many were not accounted for as they were residing in deserted houses instead of camps for displaced persons.

==Climate==

Meulaboh has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy to very heavy rainfall year-round.

<doc id="1340861" wikidata="Q935400" url="?curid=1340861" title="Live! (Bob Marley and the Wailers album)">
<text>Live! is a 1975 album by Bob Marley and the Wailers which was recorded live in concert during July 1975 at the Lyceum Theatre, London. &quot;No Woman, No Cry (Live &#x27;75)&quot; was released as a single.

==Background==
The band&#x27;s concerts at the Lyceum Theatre, London, on 17 and 18 July 1975, were recorded by Island Records employee Danny Holloway, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. The tracks selected were mostly from the 17 July performance, with &quot;Lively Up Yourself&quot; (not played on the 17th) from the 18th.

&quot;I wasn&#x27;t prepared for what I saw that night,&quot; recalled &quot;Sounds&quot; photographer Kate Simon (who shot the cover of Marley&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Kaya&quot;). &quot;It was like seeing someone who was as good-looking as Steve McQueen, playing with a group that was peerless – as tight as anything you&#x27;d ever heard. And not only did you hear this magnificent voice, but the message was one of faith, truth and doing the right thing… To see someone who sang about principles, and did it in such a way that made even me dance, that was quite something.&quot;

At the concert on the 17th, Chris Blackwell noted the audience&#x27;s reaction to &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;.

Production was credited to Bob Marley and the Wailers, Steve Smith and Chris Blackwell.

==Release==
The album was released on 5 December 1975 by Island Records as a vinyl LP. In 2001 it was released on CD. In 2016 a three disc release called the &quot;Live! Deluxe Edition&quot;, became available in vinyl and CD formats, with recordings of both the 17 July and 18 July performances.

==Reception==

Reviewing &quot;Live!&quot; in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote, &quot;The rushed tempos take their toll in aura: &#x27;Trenchtown Rock&#x27; can be far more precise, painful, and ecstatic; like most live albums this relies on obvious material. But the material is also choice, unlike most live albums it&#x27;s graced by distinct sound and economical arrangements, and the tempos force both singer and the band into moments of wild, unexpected intensity. I used to think &quot;Natty Dread&quot;″s &#x27;No Woman, No Cry&#x27; was definitive.&quot;

<text>The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) is an umbrella group of UK charities which coordinates and launches collective appeals to raise funds to provide emergency aid and rapid relief to people caught up in disasters and humanitarian crises around the world. Since being formed in 1963, the DEC has had strong relationships with major UK broadcasters in particular the BBC and ITV, who provide airtime to broadcast emergency appeals upon its recommendation. It is a member of the global Emergency Appeals Alliance, which reports that since its first television appeal in 1966, the DEC has raised over £1.4 billion. 

The DEC is a registered charity (charity no: 1062638) with 15 charity members all with associated disaster relief capabilities such as providing clean water, humanitarian aid and medical care.

The charity came to increased prominence during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine when people donated to the Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal.

==Notable DEC appeals==
The first DEC appeal was run for victims of an earthquake in Turkey in 1966.

In 2004, the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) ran UK television appeals and telephone lines for donations following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, which raised a record £392m in public donations,

Between January and July 2010, the DEC appealed for donations following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, raising a total of £107 million.

On 22 January 2009, the BBC declined a request from the DEC to screen an appeal to raise money to aid relief efforts for victims of conflict in the Gaza Strip, as they felt supporting the appeal would effectively mean the BBC taking a political stance on the Gaza conflict. This decision was the object of considerable controversy within the BBC as it is the only time the BBC is known to have refused such a request from the DEC; the 2009 Gaza appeal in question was screened by Channel 4 and ITV and raised £8.3m. Since then, the BBC has broadcast other DEC aid appeals for people in Gaza, without similar controversy. The DEC August 2014 Gaza appeal shown by the BBC helped to raise £16m over two years.

On the launch of its appeal in October 2017 for Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar to Bangladesh, the UK Government pledged to double public donations up to £3 million. Similarly, a pledge to match public donations up to £20 million was made by the UK Government in 2022 in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In 2024, an attempted DEC appeal for humanitarian aid to address the Gaza humanitarian crisis during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip was delayed by the BBC, reportedly due to fear of supporters of Israel.

==Notable fundraising events for the Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal==

In March 2022, Royal Ballet star Ivan Putrov directed Dance For Ukraine alongside Romanian ballet dancer Alina Cojocaru. The event took place at the London Coliseum on 19 March and raised £140,000 for DEC&#x27;s Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal.

On 29 March 2022, Concert for Ukraine took place at Resorts World Arena in Birmingham and it aired on ITV. It was presented by Capital FM presenter Roman Kemp, Marvin Humes and Emma Bunton. ITV pledged people to donate to DEC&#x27;s Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal. Artists included Snow Patrol, Tom Odell, Ed Sheeran and Camilla Cabello and the show ran for two hours. More than £13.4 million was donated by midday the day after the concert.

<text>Thane Creek, previously Thana Creek, is an estuary of the Arabian Sea and one of the two main distributaries of the Ulhas River, in Konkan division of Maharashtra, India. The Ulhas splits at the northeast corner of Salsette island into its two main distributaries, the other one being the Vasai Creek, both of which empty into the Arabian Sea. The creek forms the eastern boundary of Salsette island and separates the island from mainland of Konkan. It gets its name from the city of Thane, previously Thana, located on eastern banks of the creek.

The region of the Thane Creek has been recognized as an Important Bird Area by the Bombay Natural History Society, as it is home to various avian species. In particular, it harbors populations of flamingos and several other migratory and wading birds. The area has been designated as a protected Ramsar site since 2022.

== Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary ==

The Maharashtra Government has declared the area along the western bank of the Thane Creek as the &quot;Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary&quot;(TCFS). It is Maharashtra&#x27;s second notified marine sanctuary after the Malvan Marine Sanctuary. The sanctuary was notified by Govt. Gazette on 6 August 2015.

The TCFS lies on the Central Asian Flyway of the Asia Pacific Global Migratory Flyway. In 2022, the teams of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) counted more than 130,000 flamingoes in Thane creek. The greater flamingo and lesser flamingo are the two flamingo species present in the sanctuary. Alongside the flamingoes, 167 species of birds and small mammals like golden jackals are also present.

The total area of the TCFS is [which includes of mangrove forests and of water body].

== Islands ==

Numerous islands are located in Thane Creek such as Elephanta Island, Butcher Island and an unnamed island between Thane and Kalwa.

== Railway bridges==

Thane railway bridge or Thane railway viaduct is the oldest rail bridge constructed on this creek. The bridge lies between and Parsik tunnel, Kalwa. It has two sections, as there is an island in middle, a smaller section built of stones and concrete and a longer section built of stone and concrete but with a steel girder in middle. The first railway bridges in the country, they were built over the Thane creek when the Mumbai-Thane line was extended to Kalyan in May 1854. A report from Bombay Times elaborately describing the route for an account of a first trial journey of 18 November 1852 between Bombay and Tannah (before the official opening on 16 April 1853) also gave details on the Tannah-Callian (today, Kalyan) section, then under construction. It said that the railway [route] bent quickly towards &#x27;the viaduct&#x27; on entering the village. This refers to the two old Thane creek bridges, that spanned the creek on the original line.

A new parallel railway bridge, also with two sections, has been constructed for local trains , on the harbour line of Mumbai suburban railway.

Another railway bridge connecting Mankhurd and Vashi was opened later.

== Road bridges ==

There are numerous road bridges over Thane Creek.

The first Kalwa Bridge () was built in 1863 and was first road bridge across Thane creek. The long bridge has ten pillars and ten arches. Following a structural audit conducted on the bridge in 2010, it was deemed unsafe for use by heavy vehicles, and only two and three-wheelers were permitted to use the bridge. According to officials the bridge&#x27;s structure had suffered damage from a collision with a barge in 2006. The bridge was closed to all motor vehicle traffic from midnight on 3 August 2016, and only pedestrians were permitted to use the bridge. The bridge will not be demolished as it is classified as a heritage structure.

The second Kalwa Bridge was opened in 1995. The third Kalwa Bridge was partially opened to traffic on 13 November 2022, and was fully opened on 10 March 2023.

Airoli bridge connects Mulund and Airoli. It was opened in 1999.

Vashi Bridge was built in 1973 and connected Mankhurd and Vashi. This old bridge has been closed to traffic and been replaced by a newer bridge which was opened in 1997. A third bridge is currently under construction.

Mumbai Trans Harbour Link connects Sewri and Chirle. It was opened in 2024.

<doc id="1340884" wikidata="Q7074374" url="?curid=1340884" title="Oarsome Foursome">
<text>The Oarsome Foursome is the nickname for an Australian men&#x27;s rowing coxless four crew who competed with a clear lineage between 1990 and 2012, winning two Olympic gold medals and one silver medal, two world championships as a coxless four, and additional world championship titles in coxed boats. Members of the Oarsome Foursome when split into pairs placed first and second in the 1998 World Rowing Championships and won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

==1st combination==
They first achieved success seated as Nick Green (bow), Mike McKay (two), Samuel Patten (three) and James Tomkins stroke, when they won gold at the 1990 World Rowing Championships in Lake Barrington. They were coached by Noel Donaldson a former Victorian and national representative coxswain who had taken to coaching after competitive retirement. Donaldson encouraged periods of relaxation within the crew&#x27;s training regime and it&#x27;s been reported that the rowers spent the morning of that final indulging in a relaxed round of golf.

==2nd combination==
Patten was replaced by Andrew Cooper in 1991, and another World Championship title was won in Vienna 1991. Around this time they were accused by former Norwegian coach Thor Nilsson of not being serious enough about their training. In lead-up races before the 1992 Olympics the crew&#x27;s dominance was challenged by fours from the Netherlands and the USA but after a seat swap by Donaldson between Cooper and Green and the adoption of the new short &quot;cleaver&quot; blades they won gold at Barcelona 1992. The win led them to become household names, and they were crowned &quot;Moomba Monarchs&quot; (popularly called &quot;Kings of Moomba&quot;) in 1993, and appeared in television advertisements for the Australian canned fruit brand Goulburn Valley.

==3rd combination==
Andrew Cooper retired in 1995, and Drew Ginn took the bow seat. In that combination, they won a second Olympic gold medal at Atlanta 1996, cementing their popularity and fame and elevating the profile of rowing in Australia. Following a break in 1997, they returned to world-class rowing in 1998, winning gold at the 1998 Cologne World Championships as a coxed four steered by Brett Hayman. At those same championships, McKay and Ginn took silver as a coxless pair and Green; Tomkins and Hayman were also crowned World Champions in a coxed pair.

The Australian coxless four at Sydney 2000 contained no members of any previous Oarsome Foursome, although Tomkins won a bronze medal with Matthew Long in a coxless pair. Again at Athens 2004, the coxless four contained all-new faces, while Tomkins and Ginn took gold in a pair and Mike McKay rowed in the 8+. At Beijing in 2008, Tomkins rowed in the six-seat of the Australian 8+, while Ginn won gold in a coxless pair with Duncan Free.

In 2004, they released a DVD titled &quot;Oarsome Foursome Fitness&quot;, a general fitness training guide not necessarily aimed at rowers (although there is a section on perfecting your rowing stroke).

==4th variation==
At London 2012, Drew Ginn provided a single link to the previous Foursomes when he was selected in the two-seat of Australia&#x27;s coxless four with James Chapman, Josh Dunkley-Smith and Will Lockwood. That combination won the Olympic silver medal.

<doc id="1340885" wikidata="Q196479" url="?curid=1340885" title="Staraya Russa">
<text>Staraya Russa (, ) is a town in Novgorod Oblast, Russia, located on the Polist River, south of Veliky Novgorod, the administrative center of the oblast. Its population has steadily decreased over the past years, going from 41,538 recorded in the 1989 Census to 35,511 in the 2002 Census to 31,809 in the 2010 Census.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name of Staraya Russa is unclear. The most involved and widespread hypothesis was presented by philologists and linguists R. A. Akheyeva, V. L. Vasilyev, and M.V. Gorbanevsky. According to this hypothesis, &quot;Russa&quot; comes from Rus&#x27;—a Slavic people, who settled in the vicinity to control trade routes leading from Novgorod to Polotsk and Kiev—which, in turn, is usually thought to originate from an Old Norse term for &quot;the men who row&quot; (&quot;rods-&quot;) as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe, and that it could be linked to the Swedish coastal area of Roslagen (the rowing crews) or &quot;Roden&quot;, as it was known in earlier times. &quot;Staraya&quot; is Russian for &quot;Old&quot;.

==History==

Thought to have originated in the mid-10th century, it was first mentioned as Rusa (Cyrillic: Руса) in chronicles for the year 1167 as one of three main towns of the Novgorod Republic, alongside Pskov and Ladoga. After Pskov became independent, Russa became the second most important town and trade center of the Novgorod Republic after Novgorod itself. By the end of the 15th century, it contained about one thousand homesteads. Brine springs made the saltworks the principal business activity in the town, which was the biggest center of salt industry in the Novgorod region.

The wooden fortifications of Russa burned to ashes in 1190 and then in 1194, after which they were replaced by the stone fortress. In 1478, it was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Moscow together with Novgorod. The word Staraya (&quot;Old&quot;) was prefixed to the name in the 15th century, to distinguish it from newer settlements called Russa. Nevertheless, the current name firmly established only in the 19th century, when the salt mining settlements around the town became collectively known as Novaya Russa (&quot;New Russa&quot;).

When Ivan the Terrible ascended the throne in 1533, Staraya Russa was a populous town. During the Time of Troubles, it was held by Polish brigands and heavily depopulated. Only 38 people lived there in 1613.

In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Staraya Russa was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as St. Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off. In 1776, Staraya Russa became the seat of Starorussky Uyezd of Novgorod Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was transformed into Novgorod Governorate.

Catherine II appointed German mineralogy expert Franz Ludwig von Cancrin as director of the salt-works in 1783. In the 1820s, military settlements were organized in Staraya Russa and around, in accordance with the project designed by Aleksey Arakcheyev, an influential statesman. It was inconvenient to have both civil and military administration in Staraya Russa, and therefore the uyezd was abolished in 1824. The town of Staraya Russa and some adjacent territories were directly subordinated to the Defense Ministry. The military settlements were proven inefficient, in particular, in 1831, the area participated in the Cholera Riots. They were abolished in 1856. In 1857, Starorussky Uyezd was re-established.

Soviet authority in Staraya Russa was established on November 5(18), 1917.

In August 1927, the uyezds were abolished and, effective October 1, 1927, Starorussky District was established, with the administrative center in Staraya Russa. Novgorod Governorate was abolished as well and the district became a part of Novgorod Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast.

On September 19, 1939, Staraya Russa was elevated in status to that of a town of oblast significance and thus ceased to be a part of the district. The town was occupied by the Germans between August 9, 1941 and February 18, 1944. Totally destroyed during the war, it was later restored. On July 5, 1944, Staraya Russa was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast and remained there ever since.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Staraya Russa serves as the administrative center of Starorussky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with two rural localities, incorporated separately as the Town of oblast significance of Staraya Russa—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts (one of the three in Novgorod Oblast). As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Staraya Russa is incorporated within Starorussky Municipal District as Staraya Russa Urban Settlement.

==Climate==

==Economy==

===Industry===
The biggest enterprise in Staraya Russa is the aircraft repair works. The mechanical engineering plant went bankrupt in 2011 and no longer exists.

===Transportation===
A railway which connects Bologoye and Pskov passes through Staraya Russa.

Staraya Russa is connected by roads with Novgorod, Demyansk, and Bezhanitsy via Kholm. There are also local roads.

There is a wharf on the Polist River in the Lake Ilmen basin. The Polist is navigable downstream from Staraya Russa.

The town is served by the Staraya Russa Airport.

==Attractions==
Staraya Russa is a spa. A summer residence of the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who wrote his novels &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; and &quot;Demons&quot; there, is open to visitors as a museum.

Monuments include the Transfiguration Monastery, which includes a cathedral built in seventy days in 1198 and partly rebuilt in the 15th century, and several 17th-century buildings and churches. The principal city cathedral (1678) is dedicated to the Resurrection of Christ. Other notable churches are consecrated to St. George (1410) (the Dostoyevsky family stayed in the house of the priest of this church), Mina the Martyr (14th century), and the Holy Trinity (1676).
==Notable people==
*Sergei Rachmaninoff was born in 1873, in the family estate in the village of Semyonovo, near Staraya Russa. His birth was registered in Semyonovo church book and signed by Priest Platon Savitsky and acolyte Peter Lubochsky
*Fedor Dostoyevsky owned a house in Staraya Russa.

<doc id="1340891" wikidata="Q3634490" url="?curid=1340891" title="Mumbai Harbour">
<text>Mumbai Harbour (also English; Bombay Harbour or Front Bay, Marathi &quot;Mumba&#x27;ī bandar&quot;), is a natural deep-water harbour in the southern portion of the Ulhas River estuary. The narrower, northern part of the estuary is called Thana Creek. The harbour opens to the Arabian Sea to the south. The historical island of Elephanta is one of the six islands that lie in the harbour.

&quot;Front Bay&quot; is the official name of the harbour, so named because the city started as a tiny settlement facing the harbour. The waterbody behind the original settlement, forming an arc between the former Colaba island and Bombay island, up to the Malabar Hill promontory or peninsula, was similarly called Back Bay.

Front Bay is home to the Mumbai Port, which lies in the south section of the western edge of the harbour. Jawaharlal Nehru Port and Navi Mumbai lie to the east on the Konkan mainland, and the city of Mumbai lies to the west on Salsette Island. The Gateway of India with its jetty for Elephanta is the most important tourist destination.

==Islands==

There are six islands in the Mumbai Harbour.

&quot;Butcher Island&quot;, also known as &quot;Jawahar Dweep&quot;, is used as an oil terminal by the Mumbai Port. It has jetties for tankers and various other infrastructure for offloading crude oil and for loading refined petroleum products. The island is restricted to port employees, and not open to the public.

&quot;Cross Island&quot; is a small, uninhabited islet just off the coast of the Dockyard Road. Though the remains of old fortifications are visible, the island itself is restricted to the public.

&quot;Gharapuri Island&quot;, also known as &quot;Elephanta Island&quot;, is the best known of the islands in Mumbai Harbour. The Elephanta Caves located on the island are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The group of five larger caves have intricate Hindu religious rock sculptures. Two smaller caves have Buddhist religious sculptures. The carvings date back to between 5th and 8th centuries.

&quot;Middle Ground Coastal Battery&quot; is a small islet in the Thane creek. It features an antique coastal gun battery of the Indian Navy. The guns salute Indian naval vessels returning from deployments when they enter the harbour.

&quot;Oyster Rock&quot; is a small group of rock outcroppings in the harbour. The area has restricted access since it is used for naval exercises.

Salsette Island is the large island on which the cities of Mumbai and Thane are located. It is separated from the Konkan mainland by the Vasai creek and the Ulhas river. Mumbai was originally a distinct island from Thane, but reclamation of land has long since merged the islands. Powai Lake, Tulsi Lake and Vihar Lake are the largest lakes on the island.

== Mumbai Port==
Mumbai Port (MbPT) lies midway () on the western shore of Mumbai Harbour. The port was the pre-eminent commercial port of India in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is known as the &quot;gateway to India&quot;, and has been a primary factor in the emergence of Mumbai as the commercial capital of India.

==Ecology==
Mangrove swamps line much of the northwestern and eastern shores of the harbour, and provide a rich habitat for wildlife, including thousands of migrating birds such as flamingoes.

==Pollution==
Due to immense population pressures from the Mumbai metropolitan region and the extremely busy maritime trade, the Harbour is considered to be heavily polluted.

This includes reports of heavy metals flux found in the creeks adjacent to the harbour with the harbour acting as a sink for most of the pollutants.

==In Art and Literature==
The abundance of fish in this area is recorded in a painting by Clarkson Frederick Stanfield of , engraved by Edward Goodall  and with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon.

<text>Lycoteuthis is a genus containing two species of squid: &quot;Lycoteuthis springeri&quot; and &quot;Lycoteuthis lorigera&quot;. They are small animals which grow up to in length.

These squid live in the deep sea at depths of up to 3000 metres, making horizontal migrations within their range along the steep shelves.

&quot;Lycoteuthis&quot; are particularly characterised by their photophores, shining organs which give them their German name &quot;Miracle Lamps&quot;. The photophores are located in various parts of the body, with males having them on their mantle and head. The light of these photophores results from bioluminescence. The photophores serve as camouflage, since the body appears almost transparent by the light effects and normally visible structures, such as the eyes, lose their sharp outline.

<doc id="1340913" wikidata="Q6232967" url="?curid=1340913" title="John Ferguson Jr.">
<text>John Ferguson Jr. (born July 7, 1967) is the current assistant general manager for the Utah Hockey Club of the National Hockey League (NHL). Ferguson previously served as the director of player personnel for the Boston Bruins and the general manager of their American Hockey League affiliate, the Providence Bruins. Ferguson previously was the vice president and general manager for the Toronto Maple Leafs from 2003 to 2008.

==Playing career==
Drafted by the Montreal Canadiens, the team with which his father had played every one of his NHL games, in the 12th round of the 1985 NHL Entry Draft, Ferguson played four professional seasons at the American Hockey League (AHL) level with the Canadiens and Senators organizations. He was alternate captain of the 1992 Fredericton Canadiens that won the AHL regular season championship. Ferguson was named the team&#x27;s &quot;unsung hero&quot; in consecutive years (1991, 1992).

He played his college hockey at Providence College, where he served as an assistant captain, was an Academic All-American and graduated magna cum laude with a degree in business administration in 1989.

==Post-playing career==
Ferguson was a player agent responsible for negotiating player contracts, product endorsements and player recruitment. From 1993 to 1996 he was a member of the Ottawa Senators scouting staff as an amateur and professional scout. During that time he also spent the summers of 1994 and 1995 at the NHL office in the hockey operations and legal departments.

Following his professional hockey career, he graduated cum laude with the degree of juris doctor from the Suffolk University Law School and was admitted to the Massachusetts State Bar in 1996.

===St. Louis Blues===
Ferguson served as vice president and director of hockey operations for the St. Louis Blues, and before that he was assistant general manager for the club for five seasons. In that role he evaluated players at the professional and amateur level and negotiated player contracts. Ferguson was also the president and general manager of the Worcester IceCats and was influential in the negotiation and acquisition of the Blues&#x27; top minor league affiliate. He is a former chairman of the AHL&#x27;s Competition Committee and also served on the league&#x27;s Legal Affairs Committee.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
On August 29, 2003, at the age of 36, Ferguson became the 12th general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He succeeded Pat Quinn, who retained his duties as head coach after serving in a dual capacity for the previous four seasons. Leafs President Ken Dryden was given a seat on MLSE&#x27;s board of directors and shuffled to the post of Vice-Chairman, where he was no longer in the Leafs management reporting hierarchy.
During the 2005–06 season, the first after lockout, the Leafs narrowly missed the postseason. Quinn took the blame from the MLSE front office for the team&#x27;s failure to make the playoffs and was let go as head coach. Quinn&#x27;s firing upset some longtime Leaf fans, with many calling for the firing of Ferguson himself. The Leafs had finished the season 9-1-2 despite season-ending injuries to Eric Lindros, Jason Allison, Alex Khavanov and Ed Belfour, with TSN criticising Ferguson for signing these players. Many of the young players, who were key contributors to the Leaf&#x27;s late-season run for a playoff spot, were drafted by Quinn prior to Ferguson&#x27;s arrival.

Ferguson also drew criticism for a trade which brought Mark Bell to the Leafs. Bell was convicted for a hit and run and driving under the influence while with the San Jose Sharks; the NHL (which wanted to crack down on off-ice behavior) suspended Bell for his first fifteen Leafs games.

Entering the 2007–08 season the Leafs had posted a .577 points percentage during Ferguson&#x27;s tenure, establishing franchise records for points (103), wins (45-tie), home wins (26) and road wins (23) in a season. The team lost to the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round of the 2003 playoffs, in seven games, and were again eliminated by the Flyers in 2004, in six games during the second round. The Leafs reached at least 90 points and 40 wins in each of the three seasons played. However, the team failed to qualify for the playoffs in the last two of the four seasons under Ferguson. The team was out of a playoff position at the time of his dismissal, near the bottom of the league.

After weeks of media speculation, on January 22, 2008, Ferguson was informed his Leafs&#x27; contract would not be renewed when it expired on June 30, 2008. He was relieved immediately from his duties as general manager, and was replaced by returning former Maple Leafs GM Cliff Fletcher.

===Team Canada===
In 2007 Ferguson served as a member of Team Canada management at the 2007 IIHF World Championship in Russia. He collaborated with Steve Yzerman in selecting Canada&#x27;s unbeaten gold medal roster, the youngest team to ever win a World Championship.

===After the Leafs===
At the 2007–08 NHL Season&#x27;s trade deadline, Ferguson provided analysis of the trades as they came in for TSN. From 2008 to 2014, he served as a scout for the San Jose Sharks of the NHL. On June 26, 2014, he joined the Boston Bruins as Executive Director of Player Personnel. On September 16, 2016, he was also given the position of general manager of Boston&#x27;s American Hockey League affiliate, the Providence Bruins.

In 2021, he was hired as the assistant general manager of the Arizona Coyotes and the general manager of their AHL affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners.

==Personal life==
Ferguson is married to Providence College graduate, Stephanie Paiva.

Ferguson is the son of former Montreal Canadiens forward John Ferguson, Sr., and was born in the city during his father&#x27;s tenure with the team.

<text>Abancay (from Quechua language: Hamanqay, Amanqay, or Amankay, meaning &quot;lily&quot;), founded in 1572 as Santiago de los Reyes de Abancay, is a city in southern-central Peru. It is the capital of both the Apurímac Region and the Abancay Province, and serves an important cultural, economic, and political role in Apurímac. 

== Name ==
The origin of the word Abancay might have two possible explanations:

# It is a transliteration to Spanish of the Quechuan word &quot;amancay&quot;, meaning lily.
# It originates from the Quechuan &quot;awanqay&quot;, meaning &quot;weaving place&quot;, which is the version proposed by Rodolfo Cerrón Palomino, a Peruvian linguist.

==Geography==
Abancay is located at an elevation of above sea level in the southern Peruvian Andes, above the Pachachaca River, and straddles the Marino River. Because of its dry mountain and famous year-round warm weather it is known as &quot;The Eternal Springtime Valley&quot;. The nearest cities are Cusco, Chalhuanca and Andahuaylas. Abancay is located at the junction of two important Peruvian roads: the Caminos del Inca Road, an old road dating from Incan times, between the cities of Nazca and Cusco, and the Via de los Libertadores, connecting Ayacucho and Cusco.

===Climate===

==History==

Abancay was already a populated area before the arrival of the Incas. It was the frontier of the Quechua-Inca cultural influence area of the Chancas, an ethnic native group of Peru. Its name comes from a flower native to the region called . When the Spanish arrived, they transliterated the word and named the city Abancay, Villa de los Reyes (&quot;Abancay, Village of the Kings&quot;), which was later reduced to Abancay, its current name. Abancay was the location of the Battle of Abancay between the forces of the Conquistadores Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro. Abancay was mentioned in the first Cronicas (Pedro Cieza de León) as an encomienda dedicated to the cultivation of sugar cane for the production of aguardiente.

There is a traditional tale about the foundation of the city recorded by Guillermo Vidalegut, a local journalist, in his book &quot;Alma y Rostro de Abancay&quot;, who, inspired by Ricardo Palma&#x27;s Tradiciones Peruanas, gathered local traditional stories. As the story goes, during colonial times, the town was located above the valley, in one of the skirts of the Ampay mountain, in a place which is now known as Ccorhuani. One day, the statue of the Virgin Mary known as Our Lady of the Rosary, Patroness of the village, mysteriously disappeared from the local Church. The people, fearing robbery and claiming sacrilege, searched day and night until a shepherd found the statue standing above an immense boulder by the valley. The people believed that the thieves had left the statue in fear of being discovered by the search parties. The statue was returned in a procession back into town. A few weeks later, the same disappearance occurred again and another search ensued. The statue was again found in the same spot where it was found before. Lo and behold, the disappearance happened a third time. The people never understood why or how this was happening. Finally, it was suggested that maybe the statue was asking for a shrine in the valley at the location where it was being found. The town then built a small Chapel there, and it became a place of constant visits by the people. Before long, it became the center of activity, and the entire town was moved to where is located today. The statue of Our Lady of the Rosary still sits above the immense boulder which is located on the right side of the Cathedral.

==Economy==
Abancay is the agricultural center, as well as the industrial center of most of Apurímac. Sugar is milled, along with rum and other liquor distillation. There are copper mines in the area, and they are also known for their sericulture.

==Population==

The population as of 2014 is 58 000 which has more than doubled the city in size since 1990 when the population was 29,200.

==Tourism==

The Carnival is the town&#x27;s main celebration festival. It is famous as one of the best Peruvian ethnomusical festivals. It takes place from the last week of February through the last week of March. The comparsas contest and Yunsa games, with people dressing in local traditional costumes, fill the streets of the city. Every social group, from market vendors, students, government officials, teachers, etc., participate in the games which also have the support from the local and regional government due its cultural relevance.

The city&#x27;s surroundings have some astonishingly beautiful landscapes, such as the Ampay National Sanctuary, a wildlife sanctuary and a frontier within the Andes, and the Clouded Forest of the Amazonian Basin, located north of the city where the mountain called Apu Ampay (the Lord of Ampay, in the indigenous cosmology) is also located. Apu Ampay reaches heights of approximately 5,300 meters above sea level. There are also cave paintings, meteorite crash sites, lagoons, waterfalls, wildlife, orchids, and the famous Intimpa tree (a unique tropical conifer preserved by an effort led by the World Wildlife Fund) constitute a few of the attractions that nature lovers will find.
The Pachachaca River is famous for its colonial bridge and its rapids where canyoneering and whitewater kayaking can be practiced. It is one of the best and longest Peruvian locations for this. Remains of The Pachachaca State, an important producer of sugar and brandy during colonial and republican times, is now one of the major attractions of the city.

The Saywite Archeological Site, a famous temple and adoration center dating from Inca times, is located a few kilometers from the city. Therein is the world-renowned Saywite Stone. The stone is a roughly spherically-shaped monolith that has a representation of the Inca world. It suggests that the Incas had a much better understanding of astronomy than Europeans gave them credit for. There is taxi service from the city.

The Konoc Hot Springs (Cconocc, in Quechua) is a resort located a few kilometers from Saywite and is one of the best places in Peru to enjoy thermal baths from volcanic waters. It is claimed that regular baths in the springs can cure arthritis, asthma, and psoriasis.

Abancay is the gate to the Inca city of Choquequirao, next to the Apurímac River, which is considered as important as Machu Picchu. There is evidence that the real dimensions of the city are much larger than what has been uncovered, excavated and studied until now.

==Education==

===High schools===
Abancay is home of the high school Colegio Nacional &quot;Miguel Grau&quot;. Since its founding in the 1880s, it has educated each generation of the city. The main festivity of the school is on October 8, and it is a day in which all the alumni reunite and celebrate companionship. It is a tradition that the classes which are celebrating their Silver and Gold jubilees head the expensive festivities.

===Universities===
Abancay, despite its small size, is an important center of higher education. The city is home of one state university, Universidad Nacional Micaela Bastidas de Apurimac, and two private universities, Universidad Tecnológica de los Andes and Universidad Alas Peruanas. There are also two college-level institutions, Escuela Normal La Salle, for careers in education, and SENATI for industry-related training.

==Literary References==
Abancay is the setting of José María Arguedas&#x27; novel Deep Rivers. Another important book that gives accounts of the history, traditions and customs of the city is &quot;Alma y Rostro de Abancay&quot;, by Guillermo Vidalegut, a late local journalist and author.

<text>The Eretz Israel Museum (also known as Muza) is a historical and archaeological museum in the Ramat Aviv neighborhood of Tel Aviv, Israel.

Eretz Israel Museum, established in 1953, has a large display of archaeological, anthropological and historical artifacts organized in a series of exhibition pavilions on its grounds. Each pavilion is dedicated to a different subject: glassware, ceramics, coins, copper and more. The museum also has a planetarium.

The &quot;Man and His Work&quot; wing features live demonstrations of ancient methods of weaving, jewelry and pottery making, grain grinding and bread baking. Tel Qasile, an excavation in which 12 distinct layers of culture have been uncovered, is on the grounds of the museum.
==Archaeology==
===Ancient copper production===
The Nechushtan pavilion is dedicated to the copper production at Timna in the southern Negev during the Chalcolithic, Bronze and Iron Age periods. The pavilion contains a reconstructed mine, smelting furnaces, and findings from the Egyptian-Midianite mining temple at Timna.

The reconstructed Chalcolithic and Late Bronze Age mine displays mining tools such as stone hammers, flint blades and copper chisels, as well as the typical marks they left on the rock.

Four smelting furnaces are on display:
* Bowl furnace from the Chalcolithic period (4th millennium BCE)
* Domed furnace of the Late Bronze Age (14th–13th centuries BCE)
* Authentic Late Bronze Age furnace (12th century BCE)
* Shaft furnace of the Iron Age (10th century BCE).

====Midianite temple pavilion====
In the 14th century BCE, the Egyptian pharaohs dispatched mining expeditions to Timna. Alongside expert metalsmiths from the Land of Midian, they extracted copper at Timna until the early 12th century BCE. This pavilion houses a Midianite temple model. Of special interest is the copper snake with gilded head found in the Midianite shrine, reminding of the biblical Nehushtan, &quot;the bronze serpent that Moses had made&quot; ().

===Glass pavilion===
This pavilion exhibits ancient glass vessels. The exhibition is divided into three sections, representing three eras in the history of glass production: pre-blown glass (Late Bronze Age to Hellenistic period—15th-1st centuries BCE), blown glass of the Roman and Byzantine periods (1st–7th centuries CE), and blown glass of the Islamic period (7th–15th centuries CE). Two rare vessels on display are a delicate drinking horn with two openings, known by its Greek name &quot;rhyton&quot;, and &quot;Ennion&#x27;s Blue Jug&quot; bearing the signature of its famous maker, who lived in the first half of the 1st century CE.

Remnants of a glass furnace from the 13th century CE were discovered alongside the Crusader castle at Sommelaria, north of Acre.

On loan from the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) is a unique Byzantine (late 6th – early 7th century) gold-glass panel from the &quot;Birds Mosaic Mansion&quot; in Caesarea.

==Ethnography and folklore==
The ethnography and folklore section contains Judaica produced either by the Jewish diaspora in different periods, or in the Land of Israel between 1880 and 1967.

==Numismatics==
The Kadman Numismatic section displays means of payment used in the country, starting those used before to the development of coinage, and going through all historical periods until today.

==Postal history and philately==

The Alexander Museum of Postal History and Philately recounts the history of postal service in the Land of Israel from the mid-15th century until the founding of the state in 1948. On display are envelopes, letters, photographs, posters, mailboxes and telephones, as well as a mail truck from 1949.

The philatelic wing displays valuable and rare stamps.

<text>The British Dental Association (BDA) is a registered trade union for dentists in the United Kingdom.

Its stated mission is to &quot;promote the interests of members, advance the science, arts and ethics of dentistry and improve the nation&#x27;s oral health.&quot;

==Structure==
The majority of the BDA&#x27;s 16,000 members include high street dentists, working in general practice providing both National Health Service (NHS) and private care, and those working in community and hospital settings, universities and the British armed forces.

The BDA&#x27;s headquarters is in Wimpole Street, London near Queen&#x27;s College, London in the City of Westminster and it currently has offices in Stirling, Scotland, Belfast, Northern Ireland and Cardiff, Wales.

==History==

In 1856 two dental societies were founded in Britain: the Odontological Society of London and the College of Dentists of England. The two societies merged in 1863 to form the Odontological Society of Great Britain and joined the Royal Society of Medicine as its Odontological Section in 1907.

By the 1870s leading dentists including Sir John Tomes and Sir Edwin Saunders (one of Queen Victoria&#x27;s dentists) formed the Dental Reform Committee, to help bring unity, organisation and code of ethics to the dental profession. This committee campaigned successfully for the first legislation to regulate dentistry, the Dentists Act 1878 (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. 33), which limited the title of &quot;dentist&quot; and &quot;dental surgeon&quot; to registered practitioners. Qualified practitioners and those who could show they had practised dentistry for five years prior to 1878 were the only ones eligible to register.

The Dental Reform Committee called for a nationwide meeting to establish the BDA in 1879 and established it in 1880. The BDA elected Sir John Tomes as its first President. Much of the BDA&#x27;s early work involved prosecuting dentists in breach of the Dentists Act 1878.

One active member of the BDA was Charles Edward Wallis, being on the association&#x27;s representative board for six years. He also wrote extensively for the BDJ.

The Dentists Act 1921 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 5. c. 21) created the Dental Board of the UK to administer the Dentists Register. Thus the BDA was freed from legislation, and rapidly emerged as the leading consultative body and voice for the dental profession.

The 1921 act introduced a provision that only registered individuals could practise dentistry. However, unqualified practitioners were given opportunity to register if they could show they had been practising dentistry for five years prior to 1921. The last unqualified dentist ceased practise during the 1970s.

In 1946 Lilian Lindsay became the first female president of the BDA.

==British Dental Association Museum==
Its museum in Wimpole Street holds the largest collection of dental material in Britain. It includes dental instruments, equipment, furniture, photographs, archives, fine and decorative art. The museum is maintained as a national resource for the dental profession, dental industry, researchers and members of the public and aims to promote an appreciation of dentistry today through an understanding of its past. The museum is a member of the London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine.

The museum also offers an enquiry and research service for individuals wanting to learn more about the history of dentistry or whether their ancestors were dentists. On several occasions the museum has also been used as a professional consultant on television series such as Call the Midwife.

==British Dental Association Library==
The Robert and Lillian Lindsay Library was opened in 1920. It was founded and organised by Lillian Lindsay, the first woman to qualify as a dentist in the UK.
The library is the most comprehensive dental library in Europe, and subscribes to over 200 dental journals and provides members with free Medline searches.

<text>The Ulster Museum, located in the Botanic Gardens in Belfast, has around 8,000 square metres (90,000 sq. ft.) of public display space, featuring material from the collections of fine art and applied art, archaeology, ethnography, treasures from the Spanish Armada, local history, numismatics, industrial archaeology, botany, zoology and geology. It is the largest museum in Northern Ireland, and one of the components of National Museums Northern Ireland.

== History ==
The Ulster Museum was founded as the Belfast Natural History Society in 1821 and began exhibiting in 1833. It has included an art gallery since 1890. Originally called the Belfast Municipal Museum and Art Gallery, in 1929, it moved to its present location in Stranmillis. The new building was designed by James Cumming Wynne.

In 1962, courtesy of the Museum Act (Northern Ireland) 1961, it was renamed as the Ulster Museum and was formally recognised as a national museum. A major extension constructed by McLaughlin &amp; Harvey Ltd to designs by Francis Pym who won the 1964 competition was opened in 1972 and Pym&#x27;s only completed work. It was published in several magazines and was until alteration the most important example of Brutalism in Northern Ireland. It was praised by David Evans for the &quot;almost barbaric power of its great cubic projections and cantilevers brooding over the conifers of the botanic gardens like a mastodon&quot;.

Since the 1940s the Ulster Museum has built up a good collection of art by modern Irish, and particularly Ulster-based artists.

In 1998, the Ulster Museum merged with the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum and the Ulster-American Folk Park to form the National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland.

In July 2005, a £17m refurbishment of the museum was announced, with grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL, usually pronounced as &#x27;Dee-Kal&#x27;). In October 2006 the museum closed its doors until 2009, to allow for the work.
Illustrations of historic interest of interiors before alterations will be found as nos 183 and 237 in Larmour, P. 1987. The redevelopment drew criticism from many significant figures in the architectural community and the Twentieth Century Society, especially for changes to the Brutalist character and dismantling of the spiral sequence of rooms in the Pym extension.

The museum reopened in October 2009, eighty years to the day since its original opening. Within a month over 100,000 people had visited the museum.
The reopening saw the introduction of Monday closure, which has received criticism from the public and in the press. All NMNI sites are to close on Mondays. This decision is being reviewed by DCAL.

==Collections==

The museum has galleries covering the history of Northern Ireland from the earliest times to the very recent past, collections of art, mostly modern or ethnographic, historic and contemporary fashion and textiles, and also holds exhibitions.

The scientific collections of the Ulster Museum contain important collections of Irish birds, mammals, insects, molluscs, marine invertebrates, flowering plants, algae and lichens, as well as an archive of books and manuscripts relating to Irish natural history. The museum also maintains a natural history website named &quot;Habitas&quot;. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s it had a permanent exhibition on dinosaurs which has since been scaled back considerably. There is also a collection of rocks, minerals and fossils. It is also home to Ireland’s only known dinosaur fossil bones. 

===Irish archaeology===
The museum contains significant finds from Northern Ireland, although in earlier periods these were often sent to the British Museum or later Dublin, as with the Broighter Hoard, now in the National Museum of Ireland. Objects in the museum include the Malone Hoard of 19 polished Neolithic axe heads, the Moss-side Hoard of Mesolithic stone tools, the important Downpatrick Hoard of Bronze Age gold jewellery, part of the Late Roman Coleraine Hoard, the Viking Shanmullagh Hoard, and the medieval coins in the Armagh City Hoard and Armagh Castle Street Hoard.

There are other significant objects of the Bronze Age gold jewellery for which Ireland is notable, including four of the 100-odd surviving gold lunulae, and some important early Celtic art, including a decorated bronze shield found in the River Shannon, and the Bann disc, bronze with triskele decoration.

===Botany===

====The herbarium (BEL)====
The herbarium in the Ulster Museum (BEL), is based on specimens from Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society (founded in 1821); the Belfast Naturalists&#x27; Field Club (founded in 1863); the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery (formed 1905) and the herbarium (BFT) of the Botany Department of The Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast acquired in 1968. In total the number of specimens is more than 100,000. Although specimens from Northern Ireland are well represented, specimens from elsewhere in the world have been acquired by donation, exchange and purchase. All branches of the world&#x27;s flora are represented: algae, lichens, fungi, mosses and pteridophytes (ferns), conifers and angiosperms. Little information about the Irish flora before 1830 is available, the oldest specimen in the Ulster Museum is an alga: &quot;Batrachospermum moniliforme&quot; (BEL: F41) collected in 1798 by John Templeton, other specimens of &quot;Batrachospermum&quot;, originally incorrectly identified as &quot;Thorea ramoissima&quot; were collected by John Templeton in 1815 from a &quot;boghole&quot; in County Donegal (BEL:F42 – F47). It was originally published by Harvey in 1841.

===Fashion and textiles===
The Ulster Museum&#x27;s Fashion &amp; Textiles Collection aims to reflect the history of fashionable dress from as early as the 18th century, as well as contemporary international designer and high street fashion. It comprises approximately 5000 objects including garments, accessories, historic and contemporary jewellery, and a collection of dolls and toys including pieces by Armand Marseille.

The museum&#x27;s policy is to collect clothing and accessories as an Applied Art, with an emphasis on acquiring pieces that are of high design quality and/or representative of significant changes in fashion history. The collection includes eighteenth-century Spitalfields silk gowns, early 20th century Parisian couture, and contemporary international fashion . Designers represented in the collection include Chanel, Dior, Alexander McQueen, John Galliano, Vivienne Westwood and JW Anderson.

The textiles collection includes pieces by important female Irish embroiders, such as the &#x27;Lennox Quilt&#x27; of 1712 by Martha Lennox, and a bedcover by the renowned eighteenth-century letter-writer and artist, Mrs Mary Delany. The Antrim bed furniture, a complete set worked by or under the supervision of Lady Helena McDonnell, 1705–83, daughter of the 4th Earl of Antrim was purchased in 1982. Tapestries include &#x27;Arabesque&#x27; by Joshua Morris and the mid-20th century Adam and Eve by Louis le Brocquy. The textiles collection also includes two large linen wall hangings, Océanie – Le Ciel and Océanie – La Mer, by the French artist Henri Matisse.

====Malone House fire====
The Ulster Museum&#x27;s original collection of costume and textiles was almost completely destroyed in a fire following the 1976 bombing of Malone House in Belfast in November 1976, during the Troubles.

Malone House was a large house in a public country park and was the headquarters of the National Trust in Northern Ireland at the time.

By Autumn 1976 the Ulster Museum&#x27;s original costume and textile collection had been moved from unsuitable storage in the museum to Malone House. The museum held the top floor of the building which had been converted into costume and textile storage areas and a textile conservation workshop.

On 11 November, gunmen gained entry to Malone House and planted two bombs, one on the ground floor and on the first floor. A five-minute warning was given, and everyone in the building was safely evacuated. Although some rooms on the ground floor were relatively unharmed, the costume and textile collection on the second floor collapsed on top of the fire and quickly perished.

The collection included a collection of linen damask that was reckoned to be the best in the world after that of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Rijksmuseum. Both Irish and Continental linens were represented.

One of the earliest items of costume destroyed in the fire was a lady&#x27;s jacket of around 1600 with well-preserved polychrome silk and silver thread embroidery. The original Ulster Museum costume collection had a good selection of 18th-century garments costume, most with local connections such as a Spitalfields silk robe and petticoat of c. 1745 which had on the linen lining the stamp &#x27;Sam Holmes – County Down&#x27;. Specimens of ladies&#x27; dresses existed for almost every year from the end of the eighteenth century until the 1970s. There were gaps in the range of men&#x27;s costume, the eighteenth century being one of the best represented periods. The lace collection was comprehensive but with a bias towards Irish manufacturers. Lace had been collected on a proper systematic basis for longer than any other category of costume or textiles.

Among the few objects to survive were the museum&#x27;s tapestries, which were still stored in the museum building at the time of the fire (the Pilgrimage to Mecca set by Paul Saunders, a Flemish 17th century verdure tapestry, an arabesque probably by Joshua Morris and a le Brocquy), the museum&#x27;s large new jewellery collection, largely donated by the jewellery collector and historian, Anne Hull-Grundy, the Lennox Quilt – a highly embroidered signed and dated quilt of 1712 by Martha Lennox, and four 1950s and 1960s cocktail and evening dresses which were also on display.

=====Rebuilding the Fashion Collection=====
The Ulster Museum&#x27;s declared aim immediately after the bombing was to try to replace the lost collection as soon as possible. Due to having to restart the collection from almost nothing, the museum was forced to re-examine its collecting policy. The main criterion became to collect fashion and textiles as an Applied Art and that it &quot;must reflect the tastes and cultural interests and aspirations of the time it was made&quot;.

Rebuilding the collection was helped by the museum&#x27;s right to government compensation to indemnify its losses. This enabled the museum to purchase historic fashion and couture from auctions in Christies and Sothebys on a regular basis throughout the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. This enabled the Ulster Museum, almost alone in Great Britain, to be able to compete with American and continental dealers on equal terms for items which were considered particularly appropriate to the collection. Notable pieces in the collection include a cut velvet and metal thread suit worn by the &#x27;Black Rod&#x27; of the Irish Houses of Parliament in 1751, a number of very fine women&#x27;s outfits of mid 18th century Spitalfields silk.

It is the 20th-century haute couture and contemporary fashions are the most distinctive elements of the collection. Many important designers are represented, from Paul Poiret, Coco Chanel and Christian Dior to Alexander McQueen, John Galliano and Vivienne Westwood.

======Collecting Contemporary Fashion======
Since 1984 the Ulster Museum has acquired both International Designer Outfit, High Street Outfit every year. This policy has enabled the Ulster Museum to build a comprehensive overview of late 20th and 21st-century fashion. Recent acquisitions include a &#x27;We Should All Be Feminists&#x27; t-shirt by Maria Grazia Chiuri for Dior, pieces by JW Anderson, and pieces by Raf Simons for Calvin Klein.

The Ulster Museum holds work by most important 20th century Paris designers and very many post-war English and Irish designers. High Street labels such as Wallis and Etam are also represented. Magazines and contemporary photographs are systematically kept to complement actual specimens.

==Controversy at the 132nd Royal Ulster Academy exhibition==
In 2013, at the 132nd Royal Ulster Academy exhibition at the Ulster Museum &quot;The Kiss&quot; by artist Paul Walls was not displayed following discussions between the museum and the academy. It was decided as the subject matter, two women kissing, was inappropriate for school visits. A petition was organised on Change.org.

<text>Daegu University () is a private university in South Korea. Its campus is located a short distance outside Daegu, in Gyeongsan City, North Gyeongsang province. The school currently consists of 13 colleges from college of humanities to college of rehabilitation. Enrollment currently tops 20,000, and more than 780 professors are employed.

==Academics==

Traditionally focused on social work, the modern-day offerings of Daegu University cover most major fields of study. Undergraduate colleges include those of the Humanities, Law, Public Administration, Economics &amp; Business Administration, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, Engineering, Information and Communication Engineering, Natural Resources, Arts and Design, Education, and Rehabilitation Sciences, in addition to the Division of Health Science.

==History==
Reverend Young Shik Rhee (이영식, 1894–1981) founded Daegu School for the Blind Children (대구맹아학교).

The school remains a part of Daegu University. The university began on May 1, 1956, as the Korea Social Work Institute (한국사회사업학교) in downtown Daegu. Later, it became a college in 1961 (한국사회사업대학). The Gyeongsan campus was opened in 1979. The graduate school opened in 1973.

The school changed from college to university status in 1981 and changed its name from Hansa College to Daegu University.

In 2024, Daegu University announced that it would be closing its sociology department due to declining enrollment.

<doc id="1340946" wikidata="Q45267" url="?curid=1340946" title="Jura Soyfer">
<text>Jura Soyfer (8 December 1912 – 15/16 February 1939) was an Austrian political journalist and cabaret writer.

==Life==
Jura Soyfer was the son of the industrialist Vladimir Soyfer and his wife Lyubov. The well-to-do Jewish family employed French- and English-speaking governesses for Soyfer and his older sister Tamara.

In 1921, the family fled from the Bolshevist revolution and arrived in the town of Baden near Vienna. They later moved to Vienna. At the age of 15, Soyfer began studying socialist writings and became a staunch Marxist. In 1927, he joined the &quot;Verband der Sozialistischen Mittelschüler&quot; (the Association of Socialist &quot;Mittelschule&quot; pupils). His early experience with languages meant that Soyfer soon developed a feeling and love for language and wordplay. In 1929, this led to his becoming a member of the &quot;Politischen Kabarett der Sozialdemokraten&quot; (Political Cabaret of the Social Democrats) where he gained his first experience in writing for the stage.

From December 1931, Soyfer wrote two weekly political satires, one in the &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; (Workers&#x27; Newspaper) and the other in the social-democratic weekly &quot;Der Kuckuck&quot; (The Cuckoo). He also wrote two articles for the &quot;Politische Bühne&quot; (Political Stage, a socialist newspaper connected to the &quot;Red Players&quot; group of actors). These demanded that theatre become more politicised, and that it should stop producing mere distraction and entertainment. In this respect Soyfer approaches Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;epic theatre&quot;.

Soyfer also satirised the key authoritarian figures of the Austrofascist (1933/4 to 1938) period like Engelbert Dollfuß, Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg and Kurt Schuschnigg.

In August 1935, through the writer and theatre critic Hans Weigel, Soyfer was introduced to Leon Askin, an actor and director at Vienna&#x27;s popular &quot;ABC Theatre&quot;, a political cabaret. This is where most of Soyfer&#x27;s pieces were later performed.

In 1937, Soyfer was mistaken for Franz Marek (a leader of the Communist Party of Austria) and arrested. When it was discovered that Soyfer himself had also written incriminatory pieces, he was imprisoned for three months. On 17 February 1938, he was freed as part of an amnesty for political prisoners. He remained freed for only 26 days. On 13 March 1938, he was arrested as he tried to cross the Austrian border at St. Antonien Joch above Gargellen into Switzerland. He was later transported to Dachau concentration camp. Here, Soyfer met the composer Herbert Zipper, and together they wrote the famous &quot;Dachaulied&quot;, the Dachau song, which cynically took up the Nazi motto &quot;Arbeit macht frei&quot; (&quot;work liberates&quot;), written above the entrance to such camps.

In the autumn of that year, Soyfer was transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp where he died of typhoid fever the day after his release was granted, on 16 February 1939 at age 26.

His remains were sent to the United States and are buried at the Hebrew Free Burial Association&#x27;s Mount Richmond Cemetery, Staten Island, N.Y., per his family&#x27;s request. 
==Works==

Soyfer&#x27;s first work, &quot;Der Weltuntergang oder Die Welt steht auf kein&#x27; Fall mehr lang&quot; (&quot;The End of the World&quot;, or &quot;The world is certainly not going to last much longer&quot;) was first performed in the early summer of 1936; the last performance took place only a short time later on 11 July 1936. It shows humanity before the Apocalypse, the destruction of the world by a comet – the violent repression of the revolutionary masses and the blindness of the people waiting for the end of the world. In the end, the comet does not find the heart to destroy the world, which gives the play a positive ending, but also underlines the frustrating incorrigibility and stupidity of human beings.

His second work, &quot;Der Lechner Edi schaut ins Paradies&quot; (translated into English as &quot;Journey to Paradise&quot;) depicts an unemployed person who sets off to find those guilty for his distress in the past, with the help of a time machine. Eventually he discovers that the cause for his condition is the creation of humanity. The play ends, however, with a call to people to make decisions, including political ones. In this way, Soyfer connects pathos with the typical element of cabaret, political criticism.

Soyfer&#x27;s third play is &quot;Astoria&quot;, a reaction to the problematic use of the word &quot;Vaterland&quot; which had been discussed in Austria since 1918. &quot;Astoria&quot; is a non-existent land which is the focus of the hopes and aspirations of the characters in the play. Their utopic dreams are constantly destroyed by reality. This point is made clearly at the end of the play by a song of praise the actors sing about the country when they are actually being sent to prison.

In 1937 Soyfer wrote &quot;Vineta&quot;. In this piece he leaves behind traditional Austrian theatre and portrays absurd actions and speech which lead irretrievably to downfall and destruction. The protest against facts which are seen as unchangeable, and the idea of &quot;not wanting to know&quot; are both themes of the play. &quot;Vineta&quot; is a warning against war and against illusions which are created to suppress people.

Soyfer also wrote &quot;Broadway Melodie 1942&quot; for the &quot;ABC Theatre&quot;. It is an adaptation of &quot;Columbus&quot; by Kurt Tucholsky and Walter Hasenclever. Soyfer kept the original satire of the clergy and court society, but his political criticism of society is far more radical. The way the play sees events from the point of view of the lower classes makes it a classic piece of Volkstheater Wien (Austrian popular theatre); it becomes clear that, in the imagination of the playwright, the lower classes of society are actually superior to the upper classes (or at least should be). Soyfer has been accused by the publisher of the &quot;Columbus&quot;-play, Felix Blochs Erben as well as by both widows, Mary Tucholsky and Edith Hasenclever, of having plagiarized the play from its original authors. In the end, the play was pulled from Vienna theatres.

During his imprisonment from 1937–1938, Soyfer began writing another play which was to be about Adolf Hitler. Nothing has survived of these drafts.

The first verse of the &quot;&quot;, the Dachau song:
Stacheldraht, mit Tod geladen,&lt;br&gt;ist um unsre Welt gespannt.&lt;br&gt;
Drauf ein Himmel ohne Gnaden&lt;br&gt;sendet Frost und Sonnenbrand.&lt;br&gt;Fern von uns sind alle Freuden,&lt;br&gt;fern die Heimat, fern die Fraun,&lt;br&gt;wenn wir stumm zur Arbeit schreiten,&lt;br&gt;Tausende im Morgengraun.&lt;br&gt;Doch wir haben die Losung von Dachau gelernt&lt;br&gt;und wurden stahlhart dabei:&lt;br&gt;Sei ein Mann, Kamerad,&lt;br&gt; bleib ein Mensch, Kamerad,&lt;br&gt;mach ganze Arbeit, pack an, Kamerad,&lt;br&gt;denn Arbeit, Arbeit macht frei!

Barbed wire, loaded with death&lt;br&gt;
is drawn around our world.&lt;br&gt;Above a sky without mercy&lt;br&gt;sends frost and sunburn.&lt;br&gt;Far from us are all joys,&lt;br&gt;far away our home, far away our wives,&lt;br&gt;when we march to work in silence&lt;br&gt;thousands of us at the break of day.&lt;br&gt;But we have learned the motto of Dachau&lt;br&gt;and it made us as hard as steel:&lt;br&gt;Be a man, mate,&lt;br&gt;stay a man, mate,&lt;br&gt;do a good job, get to it, mate,&lt;br&gt;for work, work makes you free!
==Resonance==
Jura Soyfer&#x27;s intent was not to present any complete solutions or conclusions: he believed that the problems he presented could only be solved in real life, in actual protest. His plays destroy illusions and call upon us to change society in its present form. He himself saw his own plays as a means for propaganda with a direct connection to the times in which he lived.

Soyfer&#x27;s plays were published as a collection for the first time in 1974 thanks to the work of members of the organisation of exiled Austrians in England, &quot;Young Austria&quot;. This took his works out of their original context and gave them a larger application: they were presented, for example, as timeless criticisms of the society of the communist GDR.

==Personal life==

Until his death, Soyfer was engaged to &#x27;Helli&#x27; (Helene) Ultmann, a first cousin of the famous stage mind reader and hypnotist Erik-Jan Hanussen (Hermann Steinschneider) (source: Jenny Zundel, née Steinschneider, 1915-2012, another cousin). Soyfer was survived by his parents, Wladimir and Lubow, his older sister, Tamara, and his girlfriend, Helene.

<text>Ibb () is a city in Yemen, the capital of Ibb Governorate, located about northeast of Mocha and south of Sana&#x27;a. A market town and administrative centre developed during the Ottoman Empire, it is one of the most important medium-sized cities in the country. It is situated on a mountain ridge, surrounded by fertile land. As of 2023, it has an estimated population of 771,500 residents. Other names for Ibb, is &quot;The Land of Green&quot;

== History ==
Ibb has been occupied since ancient times, and due to its strategic importance, the Ottomans used it as an administrative center. It thrived as a market town and the Ottomans established the Wednesday market in Ibb. Ibb was governed by a semi-autonomous emir until 1944, when the emirate was abolished. At times in its history many people have migrated to Ibb from areas of Yemen experiencing drought, to find work in farming. In the mid-1950s there was reportedly an outbreak of smallpox in the city.

German explorer Hermann Burchardt photographed the city in 1901; these photos are now held at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.

== Climate ==
Ibb is located at an altitude of on a spur of Mount Shamāḥī. Due to its high altitude, Ibb has a dry-winter humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cwa&quot;), and is one of the wettest areas of Yemen, typically receiving around 500 mm of rain per annum.

<text>Bernburg (Saale) () is a town in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, capital of the Salzlandkreis district. The former residence of the Anhalt-Bernburg princes is known for its Renaissance castle.

==Geography==
The town centre is situated in the fertile Magdeburg Börde lowland on the Saale river, approx. downstream from Halle and up stream from Magdeburg. It is dominated by the huge Bernburg Castle featuring a museum as well as a popular, recently updated bear pit in its moat.

The municipal area comprises the town Bernburg proper and eight &quot;Ortschaften&quot; or municipal divisions: 
Aderstedt (incorporated in 2003), Baalberge, Biendorf, Gröna, Peißen, Poley, Preußlitz, and Wohlsdorf, all incorporated on 1 January 2010.

Bernburg is a stop on the scenic Romanesque Road (&quot;Strasse der Romanik&quot;).

==Paleontology==
Type fossil of temnospondyl amphibian &quot;Trematosaurus brauni&quot; was found in the Late Olenekian (Lower Triassic) deposits of Merkel&#x27;s Quarry, near Bernburg.

==History==
Several archaeological sites in the area refer to the Walternienburg-Bernburg Culture, a mid-neolithic funnelbeaker culture from about 3200 to 2800 BC. Agriculture on the fertile Loess soil was already common in prehistoric times. Around 150 AD, a local settlement named &quot;Luppia&quot; was mentioned in the &quot;Geography&quot; by Ptolemy. In the Early Middle Ages, the Saale river marked the border between the German stem duchies in the west and the lands of the Polabian Slavs in the east.

The present-day borough of Waldau (which became part of Bernburg in 1871) was first mentioned in a 782 deed and again in 806 as &quot;Waladala&quot; in the chronicles of Moissac Abbey; the village church dedicated to St Stephen first appeared in 964, the nowadays building dates from around 1150. Bernburg itself was first mentioned as &quot;civitas Brandanburg&quot; in a 961 deed issued by King Otto I of Germany. According to the Annalista Saxo, &quot;Berneburch&quot; Castle, then a possession of the Ascanian prince Albert the Bear, was set on fire by his enemies in 1138. In 1252 the rebuilt castle became the residence of Albert&#x27;s great-grandson Prince Bernhard I of Anhalt-Bernburg.

===Bernburg memorial===

In the Nazi era during World War II, a wing of the town&#x27;s mental hospital was used for the so-called T-4 Euthanasia Programme. The site today houses a memorial to commemorate the suffering of more than 14,000 victims.

<doc id="1340974" wikidata="Q1989584" url="?curid=1340974" title="Nigel Clough">
<text>Nigel Howard Clough (born 19 March 1966) is an English professional football manager and former player who is the manager of Mansfield Town. Playing predominantly as a forward, but later in his career used as a midfielder, Clough was capped by England 14 times in the early 1990s.

Clough was born in Sunderland, the son of Brian Clough who had been one of the most promising strikers in the English game until injury ended his career. Nigel was subsequently raised in Allestree, Derby, after his father became the manager of Derby County in 1967. Clough&#x27;s father had moved on to manage Nottingham Forest in 1975 and as a young prospect Nigel signed apprentice forms with the club in 1982. He made his professional debut for the club in 1984 and remained a regular first team member for the next decade until he signed for Liverpool in 1993, also going on to make his England debut in 1989 and was part of the squad at UEFA Euro 1992.

Clough&#x27;s playing career is most notable for his time as a player at Nottingham Forest, where he played over 400 times in league, cup and European matches in two separate spells, he scored 131 goals throughout his Forest career making him the second highest scorer in the club&#x27;s history and won the Football League Cup in both 1989 and 1990. Nottingham Forest experienced a downturn in their performances culminating in the relegation of the club from the Premier League, and the retirement of his father as manager in 1993. He subsequently signed for Liverpool before moving onto Manchester City. Following loan moves to Sheffield Wednesday and a brief return to Forest, Clough moved into non-league football at the age of 32 when he became player manager with Southern Football League Premier Division side Burton Albion in 1998. 

Over the next decade, during half of which he continued to play a regular role on the field, Clough took Burton up from the seventh tier of the English football league system to the brink of promotion to League Two. Halfway through the 2008–09 season he followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by joining Derby County as manager but was dismissed in September 2013. He was appointed as manager of Sheffield United a month later, guiding them out of the relegation zone and taking the club to FA Cup and League Cup semi-finals. He was dismissed in May 2015 and returned to Burton in December, leading them to promotion to the Championship for the first time in the club&#x27;s history in May 2016 and the League Cup semi-final in January 2019. He stepped down in May 2020, and returned to work in November at Mansfield Town.

==Playing career==
===Club career===
Clough joined Nottingham Forest as an apprentice on leaving school in 1982. He left after two seasons to sign for non-league Heanor Town, but was back at the City Ground on a professional contract in December 1984. He became a regular player in the 1985–86 season, being Forest&#x27;s top scorer with 15 goals in the First Division to help them finish eighth in the league, a position they repeated the following season when he found the net 14 times in the First Division.

In April 1988, he was the subject of a £1.5 million bid from Italian side Pisa, but the bid was turned down and Clough remained at Forest, who finished third that season and the season after. He remained among Forest&#x27;s top goalscorers for a further five seasons, helping them win the League Cup in 1989 and 1990 and the Full Members&#x27; Cup in 1989. They were also FA Cup semi-finalists in 1988 and 1989 and runners-up in 1991. Clough also contributed to Forest winning the last Full Members Cup in 1992. They also reached another League Cup final that season, but lost to Manchester United. Clough was Forest&#x27;s top scorer in 1992–93 with ten goals in the new Premier League, but Forest were relegated, following which his father Brian retired after 18 years as manager. Towards the end of the season, he was used as a centre-back on several occasions.

Clough was widely expected to leave Forest in order to continue playing Premier League football, and was sold to Liverpool that summer for £2.25million. At the time, he was one of the most expensive players ever to be signed by Liverpool, who had finished a disappointing sixth in the new Premier League having been the dominant English club side of the last 20 years of the old First Division.

Clough scored twice on his debut for Liverpool against Sheffield Wednesday on 14 August 1993. He had found the net four times for the Reds by the end of August 1993, but by Christmas had found himself struggling for a first team place after the emergence of 18-year-old Robbie Fowler alongside Ian Rush in the Liverpool attack. Liverpool were also enduring another disappointing season in the league, which led to the resignation of Graeme Souness as manager at the end of January 1994 and the appointment of coach Roy Evans as his successor.

Clough did manage to find the net three more times that season, his final two goals coming on 4 January 1994 when he scored twice against Manchester United at Anfield, when Liverpool came from three goals down to draw 3–3. However, the continuing effectiveness of Fowler and Rush in attack meant that Clough made only a handful of appearances for the Reds in 1994–95, and was not in their League Cup winning side. He finally left Anfield in January 1996.

He signed for Premier League relegation battlers Manchester City for £1.5million. Clough played in all of Manchester City&#x27;s remaining 15 league appearances after his arrival at Maine Road, scoring twice, but could not stave off relegation and shortly afterwards he lost his place in the team due to injury.

He returned to Nottingham Forest on loan in December 1996, when Stuart Pearce became manager on an interim basis after the departure of Frank Clark. He scored once against Leicester City in 13 league games before returning to Manchester City. He did not play for the club again.

He made another Premier League comeback in the 1997–98 season when he was loaned to struggling Sheffield Wednesday. His only league game for the South Yorkshire club was a 5–2 home defeat by Derby County (he also played in a League Cup tie against Grimsby Town). When City were relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1997–98 season, Clough was given a free transfer and his senior football career was over at the age of 32.

===International career===
After playing 15 times for the England under-21 side from 1986 to 1988, scoring three goals, Clough finally made his senior international debut on 23 May 1989 against Chile at the age of 23. He made the final full international appearance of his career on 19 June 1993 against Germany. By this time, he had been capped 14 times by England at senior level, but failed to score.

==Managerial career==
===Burton Albion===
In October 1998, he moved into management when he accepted the role of player-manager at Burton Albion in the Southern Football League Premier Division.

Now aged 32, Clough was still registered as a player, which possibly explained his apparent lack of ambition to move into League management (his father bitterly lamented the premature curtailment of his own playing career). However, Clough had not played regularly for Burton since the early stages of the 2005–06 season, though he did play in the team&#x27;s 6–3 win over Sutton Coldfield Town in the Birmingham Senior Cup on 27 October 2008. His final senior appearance for Burton came in the league against Droylsden on 12 February 2008, his only appearance of the season.

In January 2006, Burton, then in the Conference, held Manchester United to a 0–0 draw in the third round of the FA Cup. The United team featured Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Louis Saha, with Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney introduced as second-half substitutes. Burton midfielder Chris Hall said: &quot;After the match, the press were buzzing... but we had a local cup game, against Stourbridge, I think, and the gaffer only wanted to focus on that... With his playing career, he was used to the publicity... It was brilliant and it was quite a breath of fresh air, but at the same time, the gaffer kept us grounded&quot;. In the replay at Old Trafford, Burton were beaten 5–0, but earned a reported £600,000 in the process.

Clough won the Conference Premier Manager of the Month for December 2008, after completing 11 straight wins in the division and guiding Burton to 13 points clear at the top of the table.

===Derby County===
On 5 January 2009 he was officially approached by Derby County, one of the clubs his father had previously managed, to take over as their manager as a replacement for Paul Jewell. He was appointed the next day, prior to his taking charge, on 8 January, Academy Head Coach David Lowe guided Derby to a victory over Manchester United 1–0 in the first leg of the League Cup semi-final. Clough&#x27;s first victory in charge of The Rams came on 31 January 2009, when Derby beat Coventry City 2–1. Results improved after Clough&#x27;s arrival, with a run of four consecutive wins. However, a series of injuries to key players saw a loss of form for the Rams. Safety in the Championship was not confirmed until the penultimate game of the season against Charlton Athletic, with a 1–0 victory.

Clough&#x27;s first full season in charge of Derby saw significant changes to the playing staff as he brought in nine players and moved on fourteen as well as making substantial dealings in the loan market. Despite this, the Rams again struggled with injuries, at one point being without thirteen first team players. When key players returned from injury, Clough was able to start picking a regular team, and results began to improve. Derby finished two points and four places better off than the previous campaign.

Clough was involved in several altercations during the season. He was accused by counterpart Billy Davies of kicking him in the knee in a pitch side altercation during Derby&#x27;s 1–0 victory over local rivals Nottingham Forest. Clough denied the claim and, though Davies put in an official complaint to the Football League, nothing came of the incident.

Clough was also in trouble again when he was sent to the stands during Derby&#x27;s 3–1 home defeat to Ipswich Town on 5 April. He was fined £1,000 and given a one-match ban, which he served during Derby&#x27;s final match of the campaign at home to Cardiff City. Clough also gave himself some game time during the course of the season, coming on as a late substitute for the reserve side in their 2–1 victory over West Bromwich Albion reserves in their Central League Central Section clash.

Derby suffered a major shock in the FA Cup, losing to Crawley Town 2–1. The result saw Clough&#x27;s job at the club reportedly come under threat, as he issued an apology to the club&#x27;s supporters, many of whom responded with demands for his dismissal. Derby&#x27;s Chief Executive Tom Glick answered fan&#x27;s concerns by reiterating the club&#x27;s support for Clough, saying: &quot;Nigel is absolutely our guy. We have been clear about that continuously.&quot;

During Derby&#x27;s post-November struggles Clough came under focus for his consistent criticism of individual players, which came to a head when he strongly criticised Tomasz Cywka after his mistake led to a late Portsmouth equaliser in a 1–1 draw at Fratton Park. Of Cywka, Clough said: &quot;He&#x27;s an extremely inexperienced and not very bright footballer... he can go back to Wigan or wherever he came from – I&#x27;m not really bothered – until he learns the game.&quot; These incidents led PFA Chief Gordon Taylor to criticise Clough, saying: &quot;It cannot be appropriate to criticise your team in such a way in public. We&#x27;ll sort things out... otherwise it looks an untenable situation.&quot; Ultimately, nothing came of the incident but the outbursts, coupled with Derby&#x27;s poor results on the pitch, led to some unrest among supporters. Clough&#x27;s players were booed at the end of a 3–1 home defeat against Doncaster Rovers on 1 March 2011.

Clough&#x27;s continuing stay at the club was rewarded by overseeing Derby&#x27;s best start to the season in 106 years as they opened the season with four victories from four and earned a Championship Manager of the Month nomination.

A 1–1 draw with Barnsley on 28 September 2011 took Derby into second place and the automatic promotion spots for the first time in over a year. The results came during discussions over Clough&#x27;s contract – which was due to expire at the end of the season with Forest allegedly interested in securing their former player&#x27;s services. Despite these reports however, there was no evidence that Clough and his staff were looking to go elsewhere and Clough entered into new contract discussions with Derby, stating &quot;It has never been a question of if we wanted to stay or not. This is where our heart is.&quot;

Clough signed a new three-year deal, to take him through until summer 2015, on 17 October, two days after a 1–1 draw with league leaders Southampton had kept Derby in the play-off places. After signing the deal, Derby took just four points from their next five fixtures and slipped out of the playoff places. A 3–2 defeat at Peterborough United, after Derby had held a 2–0 lead, saw Clough hit out at the officials and the FA imposed a £2,000 fine on him.

Derby suffered mixed form through the remainder of the season. By mid-April Derby found themselves 11th in the table, five points off the play-offs with four games remaining. However, two defeats to Middlesbrough and Cardiff City in four days ended Derby&#x27;s play-off chances. Derby finished the season 12th in the league, with Clough satisfied with the performances of the team, stating that a lack of firepower was the reason why they fell short and that it would be an area to improve on in the following season.

The club also finally ended their interest in appointing a director of football, something the club had been considering since May 2011. This meant Clough retained control of the club&#x27;s player recruitment policy and he was keen to add to his squad. On the final match of the 2012–13 season, a 1–0 victory over Millwall helped Derby to finish the campaign in 10th place.

After a mixed start to the 2013–14 season, Clough was sacked on 28 September after three defeats in eight days, the final of which was a 1–0 defeat to local rivals Nottingham Forest, with Derby 14th in the table after nine games. He left the club as the longest serving Derby manager in over a decade.

===Sheffield United===
On 23 October 2013, Clough was appointed new manager of Sheffield United on a two-and-a-half-year deal. Clough&#x27;s tenure got off to a winning start as Sheffield United comfortably beat Crewe Alexandra 3–1 at Bramall Lane. Clough was named League One&#x27;s Manager of the Month for February 2014 after an improved run of form with four wins from five matches, including four clean sheets.

On 9 March 2014, Clough&#x27;s side beat Charlton Athletic 2–0 to set up an FA Cup semi-final tie against Hull City at Wembley, this was United&#x27;s ninth consecutive win in all competitions with United climbing out of the League One relegation zone up to 11th in the table. In May 2014, Clough was named &quot;FA Cup Manager of the Season&quot; by the League Managers Association in recognition of United&#x27;s run to the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Clough also led the Blades to the semi-finals of the League Cup in the 2014–15 season after a 1–0 win over Southampton at Bramall Lane. Sheffield United parted company with Clough on 25 May 2015.

===Return to Burton Albion===
Clough returned to Burton Albion for a second spell as manager in December 2015, after Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink left the post to join Queens Park Rangers. Clough led the club to a 2nd place finish at the end of the season, gaining the club promotion to the Championship for the first time in their history. Clough kept the side in the league for two seasons before the club was relegated back to League One in May 2018 after a 23rd place finish. Clough later stepped down as manager in May 2020 due to the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the club.

===Mansfield Town===
On 6 November 2020, Clough was appointed as manager of Mansfield Town on a two-and-a-half-year deal who were then in 22nd position in League Two. After a poor start to the 2021–22 season which had seen his side in the relegation zone in October, Mansfield would win a club record eleven consecutive home matches to finish the season strongly. They ultimately finished 7th, missing out on automatic promotion on the final game of the season. In the play-offs, Mansfield would beat Northampton Town before losing 3–0 in the play-off final against Port Vale. In the 2022–23 season, Mansfield missed out on a play-off finish on goal difference despite a win against Colchester United in the final game.

On 9 May 2023, Clough signed a new one-year contract with the option to extend it further. At the beginning of the 2023–24 season, Mansfield went 19 games unbeaten. Following a run of four wins from five matches, scoring twenty goals in the process, Clough was named EFL League Two Manager of the Month for February 2024, finishing the month top of the league. At the EFL Awards, Clough was named as the League Two Manager of the Season. His side sealed promotion to League One the following week with a win against Accrington Stanley.

<doc id="1340994" wikidata="Q4864451" url="?curid=1340994" title="Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range">
<text>The Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range or Barry M. Goldwater Range (BMGR), formerly known as Luke Air Force Range,&lt;ref name=&quot;AZDEQ BMGR/Luke AFR history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is a bombing range in the U.S. state of Arizona, between the Mexico–United States border and Interstate 8 straddling the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and the Tohono Oʼodham Nation.

==History and operations==
Established in 1941, the BMGR is primarily used for air-to-ground bombing practice by United States Air Force (USAF) pilots flying A-10 Thunderbolts from Davis–Monthan Air Force Base, F-16 Fighting Falcons and F-35 Lightning IIs from Luke Air Force Base and Tucson Air National Guard Base, and United States Marine Corps pilots and naval flight officers in F/A-18 Hornets, AV-8B Harriers and F-35Bs flying from Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. It is also used by other U.S. and NATO/Allied/Coalition flight crews while deployed to any of the aforementioned bases for training. According to a USAF spokesman, &quot;The Barry M. Goldwater range is between Phoenix, Tucson and Yuma... As you take that geography and look at the military in those three cities you have roughly 20 squadrons that use the range day in, day out as their backyard range. When you piece all of the airspace together, it’s actually bigger than the state of Connecticut which makes it a real training treasure.”

The entire range is approved for day and night operations with four controlled, manned, and electronically scored surface attack ranges that are available for training. There are three tactical ranges available spanning several hundred square miles each, and containing two full-size airfield mockups. The area includes the Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field which serves as an emergency landing location for pilots and flight crews training on the ranges.
The USAF operates the eastern portion of the BMGR while the U.S. Marine Corps operates the western portion.

The range was named after five-term U.S. Senator, Barry M. Goldwater from Arizona. Goldwater received a reserve commission in the U.S. Army Air Forces when the United States entered World War II. Following the war, Goldwater was a leading proponent of creating the U.S. Air Force Academy. As a colonel, he also founded the Arizona Air National Guard and eventually retired as a command pilot with the rank of major general. By the end of his career, he had flown 165 different types of aircraft.

==Geography==
The BMGR includes part of the Yuma Desert and Gila Mountains, almost all of the Tinajas Altas Mountains and the Lechuguilla Desert, all of the Copper Mountains, much of the Mohawk Valley, part of the Mohawk Mountains, San Cristobal Valley and Granite Mountains, most of the Childs Valley, and part of the Growler Valley.

El Camino del Diablo, which historically connected Yuma, Arizona and Sonoita, Mexico, runs through the BMGR.

==Undocumented immigrants crossing the BMGR==

Despite warning signs along its southern perimeter in English and Spanish stating that the BMGR is U.S. Government property, that it is an active military bombing range and that unauthorized entry is prohibited, the BMGR remains among the treacherous access areas southwest of Tucson for Mexican, Salvadoran, and other Central and South American migrants crossing into the United States without documentation, where many have perished. Aid workers trying to save people from dying have signed up for annual passes to access the BMGR, including a waiver of liability for live bombing, but some workers have been banned and threatened with trespassing charges, citing property policy that requires everything packed in to also be brought out.

In August 2018, The Marshall Project reported in an interview on the progressive news program Democracy Now! about the inability to deliver food, water, and other aid to migrants due to restrictions barring the access to the military area. Freelance Mexican-American investigative reporter John Carlos Frey later told &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; that a team from the volunteer search-and-rescue group, &quot;Aguilas del Desierto&quot; (“Eagles of the Desert”) discovered a dozen bodies in a small area they were allowed to search for two weekends, but fear at least hundreds more have died there. The United States Border Patrol deployed support beacons to request emergency assistance, also called &quot;help stations&quot;, are shown scattered throughout the area on the accompanying map published by the Marines.

In 2020, crews were installing three-ton (2,700 kg), barrier panels along the BMGR&#x27;s U.S.-Mexico border near Yuma, Arizona. Executed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the barrier construction is in response to the Presidential National Emergency Declaration of 2019 requiring the use of the U.S. armed forces to help secure the U.S. southern border.

==Popular culture==
The range is the setting for §4, Part 4, in Don DeLillo&#x27;s &quot;Underworld&quot; (1997).

In season 1, episode 3 of &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; on AppleTV, the Fox family and coyote Chuy cross the range to flee the US government and cross into Mexico.

<text>The National Maritime Museum (, &quot;HaMuze&#x27;on HaYami HaLe&#x27;umi&quot;) is a maritime and archaeological museum in Haifa, Israel.

The museum was founded in 1953, based on the private collection of its founder and first director, Aryeh Ben-Eli. In 1972, the museum moved to its current premises near the northern beachhead of Mount Carmel, between Stella Maris and Bat Galim neighborhoods. Nearby are the Israeli Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum and the Cave of Elijah.

The Marine Workshop of the Leon Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies, affiliated with the University of Haifa is located at the museum. The workshop provides professional diving and field surveying services for field research conducted at the institute.

Archaeological finds on permanent display at the museum include the Athlit Ram, a bronze ram of a 2nd-century BC warship.

<text>SPARC64 is a microprocessor developed by HAL Computer Systems and fabricated by Fujitsu. It implements the SPARC V9 instruction set architecture (ISA), the first microprocessor to do so. SPARC64 was HAL&#x27;s first microprocessor and was the first in the SPARC64 brand. It operates at 101 and 118 MHz. The SPARC64 was used exclusively by Fujitsu in their systems; the first systems, the Fujitsu HALstation Model 330 and Model 350 workstations, were formally announced in September 1995 and were introduced in October 1995, two years late. It was succeeded by the SPARC64 II (previously known as the SPARC64+) in 1996.

== Description ==
The SPARC64 is a superscalar microprocessor that issues four instructions per cycle and executes them out of order. It is a multichip design, consisting of seven dies: a CPU die, MMU die, four CACHE dies and a CLOCK die.

=== CPU die ===
The CPU die contains the majority of logic, all of the execution units and a level 0 (L0) instruction cache. The execution units consist of two integer units, address units, floating-point units (FPUs), memory units. The FPU hardware consists of a fused multiply add (FMA) unit and a divide unit. But the FMA instructions are really fused (that is, with a single rounding) only as of SPARC64 VI. The FMA unit is pipelined and has a four-cycle latency and a one-cycle-throughput. The divide unit is not pipelined and has significantly longer latencies. The L0 instruction cache has a capacity of 4 KB, is direct-mapped and has a one-cycle latency.

The CPU die is connected to the CACHE and MMU dies by ten 64-bit buses. Four address buses carrying virtual addresses lead out to each cache die. Two data buses write data from the register file to the two CACHE dies that implement the data cache. Four buses, one from each CACHE die, deliver data or instructions to the CPU.

The CPU die contained 2.7 million transistors, has dimensions of 17.53 mm by 16.92 mm for an area of 297 mm2 and has 817 signal bumps and 1,695 power bumps.

=== MMU die ===
The MMU die contains the memory management unit, cache controller and the external interfaces. The SPARC64 has separate interfaces for memory and input/output (I/O). The bus used to access the memory is 128 bits wide. The system interface is the HAL I/O (HIO) bus, a 64-bit asynchronous bus. The MMU has a die area of 163 mm2.

=== Cache dies ===
Four dies implement the level 1 (L1) instruction and data caches, which require two dies each. Both caches have a capacity of 128 KB. The latency for both caches is three cycles, and the caches are four-way set associative. The data cache is protected by error correcting code (ECC) and parity. It uses a 128-byte line size. Each CACHE die implements 64 KB of the cache and a portion of the cache tags.

The cache die contains 4.3 million transistors, has dimensions of 14.0 mm by 10.11 mm for a die area of 142 mm2. It has 1,854 solder bumps, of which 446 are signals and 1408 are power.

=== Physical ===
The SPARC64 consisted of 21.9 million transistors. It was fabricated by Fujitsu in their CS-55 process, a 0.40 μm, four-layer metal complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process. The seven dies are packaged in a rectangular ceramic multi-chip module (MCM), connected to the underside of the MCM with solder bumps. The MCM has 565 pins, of which 286 are signal pins and 218 are power pins, organized as a pin grid array (PGA). The MCM has wide buses which connect the seven dies.

== SPARC64 II ==

The SPARC64 II (SPARC64+) was a further development of the SPARC64. It is a second-generation SPARC64 microprocessor. It operated at 141 and 161 MHz. It was used by Fujitsu in their HALstation Model 375 (141 MHz) and Model 385 (161 MHz) workstations, which were introduced in November 1996 and December 1996, respectively. The SPARC64 II was succeeded by the SPARC64 III in 1998.

The SPARC64 II has higher performance due to higher clock frequencies enabled by the new process and circuit tweaks; and a higher instructions per cycle (IPC) count due to the following microarchitecture improvements:
* The capacity of the level 0 (L0) instruction cache was doubled to 8 KB.
* The number of physical registers was increased to 128 from 116 and the number of register files to five from four.
* The number of branch history table entries was doubled to 2,048.

It was fabricated by Fujitsu in their CS-60 process, a 0.35 μm, five-layer metal CMOS process. The new process reduced the area of the dies, with the CPU die measuring 202 mm2, the MMU die 103 mm2, and the CACHE die 84 mm2.

== SPARC64 GP ==

The SPARC64 GP is a series of related microprocessors developed by HAL and Fujitsu used in the Fujitsu GP7000F and PrimePower servers. The first SPARC64 GP was a further development of the SPARC64 II. It was a third-generation SPARC64 microprocessor and was known as the SPARC64 III before it was introduced. The SPARC64 GP operated at clock frequencies of 225, 250 and 275 MHz . It was the first microprocessor from HAL to support multiprocessing. The main competitors were the HP PA-8500, IBM POWER3 and Sun UltraSPARC II. The SPARC64 GP was taped out in July 1997. It was announced on 11 April 1998, with 225 and 250 MHz versions were introduced in December 1998. A 275 MHz version was introduced in March 1999.

It was a single-die implementation of the SPARC64 II that integrated, with modifications, the CPU die and two of the four CACHE dies. Numerous modifications and improvements were made to the microarchitecture, such as the replacement of the MMU and a new system interface using the Ultra Port Architecture.

It had improved branch prediction, an extra pipeline stage to improve clock frequencies and a second FPU which could execute add and subtract instructions. A FPU of less functionality was added instead of a duplicate of the first to save die area; the second FPU is half the size of the first. It has a three-cycle latency for all instructions. The complex SPARC64 II memory management unit (MMU) was replaced with a simpler one that is compatible with the Solaris operating system. Previously, SPARC64 systems ran SPARC64/OS, a derivative of Solaris developed by HAL that supported the SPARC64.

The L1 caches were halved in capacity to 64 KB from 128 KB to reduce die area (the reason why only two of the four CACHE dies were integrated from the SPARC64 II). The associated performance loss was mitigated by the provision of a large external L2 cache with a capacity of 1 to 16 MB. The L2 cache is accessed with a dedicated 128-bit data bus that operates at the same or half clock frequency of the microprocessor. The L2 cache is inclusive, that is it is a super-set of the L1 caches. Both L1 and L2 cache have their data protected by ECC and their tags by parity.

The SPARC64 II&#x27;s proprietary system interface was replaced by one compatible with the Ultra Port Architecture. This enabled the SPARC64 III to use chipsets from Sun Microelectronics. The system bus operates at half, a third, quarter or fifth the frequency of the microprocessor, up to a maximum of 150 MHz.

It contained 17.6 million transistors, of which 6 million are for logic and 11.6 million are contained in the caches and TLBs. The die has an area of 210 mm2. It was fabricated by Fujitsu in their CS-70 process, a 0.24 μm, five-layer metal, CMOS process. It is packaged in a 957-pad flip-chip land grid array (LGA) package with dimensions of 42.5 mm by 42.5 mm. Of the 957 pads, 552 are for signals and 405 are for power and ground.

Internal voltage is 2.5 V, I/O voltage is 3.3 V. Peak power consumption of 60 W at 275 MHz. The Ultra Port Architecture (UPA) signals are compatible with 3.3 V Low Voltage Transistor Transistor Logic (LVTTL) levels with the exception of differential clock signals which are compatible with 3.3 V pseudo emitter coupled logic (PECL) levels.

=== Later versions ===
The second and third SPARC64 GPs are fourth generation SPARC64 microprocessors. The second SPARC64 GP was a further development of the first and it operated at 400 to 563 MHz. The first versions, operating at 400 and 450 MHz were introduced on 1 August 2000. It had larger L1 instruction and data caches, doubled in capacity to 128 KB each; better branch prediction as the result of a larger BHT consisting of 16,384 entries; support for the Visual Instruction Set (VIS); and a L2 cache built from double data rate (DDR) SRAM. It contained 30 million transistors and was fabricated by Fujitsu in their CS80 process, a 0.18 μm CMOS process with six levels of copper interconnect. It used a 1.8 V internal power supply and a 2.5 or 3.3 V power supply for I/O. It was packaged in a 1,206-contact ball grid array (BGA) measuring 37.5 mm by 37.5 mm. of the 1,206 contacts, 552 are signals and 405 are power or ground.

The third SPARC64 GP was identical to the second in terms of microarchitecture. It operated at 600 to 810 MHz. First versions were introduced in 2001. 700, 788 and 810 MHz versions introduced on 17 July 2002. It was fabricated by Fujitsu in their 0.15 μm CS85 process with six levels of copper interconnect. It used a 1.5 V internal power supply and a 1.8 or 2.5 V power supply for I/O.

<doc id="1341012" wikidata="Q5984" url="?curid=1341012" title="Sibolga">
<text>Sibolga (formerly sometimes Siboga) is a city and a port located in the natural harbour of Sibolga Bay on the west coast of North Sumatra province, in Indonesia.

The city is located on the western side of North Sumatra facing the Indian Ocean, is a transit harbour to Nias Island, and was hard hit during the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Sibolga is also a semi-enclave within Central Tapanuli Regency, as Sibolga borders Central Tapanuli Regency in the north, east, and south, while it borders the Mentawai Strait in the west.

The city has an area of only 10.77 km2 and is the smallest city by land area in Indonesia. It had a population of 84,444 at the 2010 census and 89,584 at the 2020 census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 91,265 - comprising 45,839 males and 45,426 females.

==Administrative districts==
The city is divided into four districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 census and the 2020 census, together with the official estimates as of mid-2023. The table also includes the number of administrative villages (all classed as urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;) in each district and its postcodes.

== History ==
Poncan Ketek Island (Small Poncan Island) in Sibolga Bay was once the location of a fort, with British, Dutch, French, and American traders passing through. It is thought Stamford Raffles passed through before he moved to Bengkulu in southern Sumatra. From Bengkulu Raffles, after relinquishing the port to the Dutch, established the trade port that became Singapore.

At some point between 1890 and 1920, there was a major fire in the city, which was presumably mostly built from wood from the surrounding mountains (shown partly denuded in the 1928 panorama below).

After the Japanese invasion of Sumatra in 1942, a makeshift prison described as a &quot;civilian camp&quot; was set up at &quot;Taroetoengweg&quot;, in the city center, from 16 March to 4 May 1942. It first housed 10 &quot;European&quot; men from in and around Sibolga, who were then joined on April 24 by another 10 men from the island of Nias. On May 4 they were taken to the Native Secondary School for Boys in Pearadja (Taroetoeng), located in the mountains behind Sibolga.

== Transport and tourism ==
Buses are available from Medan, Parapat, and Padang. Ferries from here service the outlying islands to the west, Simeulue and Nias, as well as the rest of Indonesia. Sibolga is a step-off point for trade and passenger boats to Nias Island. The local airport is Ferdinand Lumban Tobing Airport.

==Climate==
This area has a tropical rainforest climate with no real dry season. Regions with this climate typically feature tropical rainforests, and are designated by the Köppen climate classification as &quot;Af&quot;.

<doc id="1341016" wikidata="Q6183877" url="?curid=1341016" title="Jerry Kilgore (politician)">
<text>Jerry Walter Kilgore (born August 23, 1961) is an American attorney and politician. A Republican, he served as Attorney General of Virginia from 2002 to 2005 and was the Republican nominee for Governor of Virginia in 2005, losing to Democratic nominee Tim Kaine. He is a partner with the law firm Cozen O&#x27;Connor and is a member of the firm&#x27;s leading State Attorneys General practice in Washington, D.C. He also serves as finance chair of the Republican Party of Virginia.

He was previously a partner at McGuireWoods and a senior advisor with McGuireWoods Consulting in Richmond, Virginia.

==Background==
Born in Kingsport, Tennessee on August 23, 1961, Kilgore earned a B.A. degree &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from Clinch Valley College (now the University of Virginia&#x27;s College at Wise) in 1983 and a J.D. from the William &amp; Mary School of Law in 1986. His twin brother, Terry Kilgore, has served in the Virginia House of Delegates since 1994.

==Early career==
During 1987 and 1992, Kilgore served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. He was Secretary of Public Safety under Governor George Allen from 1994 to 1998 and was elected Attorney General of Virginia in the 2001 Virginia Attorney General election by a wide margin.

Kilgore is known for his conservative views on social issues, especially with respect to gun control, religion and abortion. He was critical of Democratic Governor Mark Warner&#x27;s fiscal policy, particularly the 2004 budget that included substantial tax increases. Kilgore garnered national attention for his opposition to the Herndon day-laborer center and he has traditionally held the view that laws regarding illegal immigration should be enforced stringently.

==2005 gubernatorial campaign==

Kilgore resigned as attorney general in February 2005 to run for Governor (as is the convention in Virginia) and easily won the primary election against Warrenton Mayor George B. Fitch to become the Republican nominee. In the general election, he ran against Democratic nominee Tim Kaine, the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, and State Senator Russ Potts, a pro-choice Republican who ran as an independent candidate. Early in the race, Kilgore showed solid leads of ten points or more in the polls, but Kaine steadily closed the gap and ultimately defeated Kilgore by a margin of 52% to 46%.

Kilgore&#x27;s campaign was at times criticized for taking steps to avoid debates; Kilgore refused to debate Potts for the majority of the campaign, at times leaving Kaine and Potts to debate each other in his absence. He agreed to debate only with Kaine, and only if the footage could not be aired in campaign commercials. During this debate, he refused to answer whether or not he would make abortion a crime. This apparent public moderation of his previously open and hard-line stance on abortion troubled some of his conservative supporters.

He was further criticized for failing to limit his negative advertisements to 50% of his campaign&#x27;s total publicity as Kaine proposed. One such advertisement featured a father whose son had been murdered by a man who was on Virginia&#x27;s death row; the father expressed doubt that the sentence would be carried out if Kaine were elected and alleged that Kaine would not even have authorized the execution of Adolf Hitler, based on an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The negative reaction to the mention of Hitler combined with Kaine&#x27;s pledge to carry out the death penalty and explanation of his personal opposition as arising from his Catholic faith helped to neutralize what many observers thought would&#x27;ve been a potent issue for Kilgore.

In trying to explain how a solid Republican could lose a traditionally Republican state by such a large margin, political commentators cited numerous key factors. Kaine&#x27;s campaign had many political advantages, including his association with the state&#x27;s popular Democratic Governor Mark Warner and defense of Warner&#x27;s 2004 budget priorities, his &quot;response ads&quot; to Kilgore&#x27;s death penalty advertisements, which featured him speaking to voters about his religious convictions, his relentless in-person campaigning across the state, and his opposition to tax increases. In contrast, Kilgore&#x27;s campaign had many political disadvantages, including a backlash over the death penalty ads that Kilgore&#x27;s campaign ran in the fall, the relatively low poll numbers of then-President George W. Bush at the time the election, and a bitter division between the moderate and conservative wings of the Republican party over tax and spending priorities.

<text>A capital requirement (also known as regulatory capital, capital adequacy or capital base) is the amount of capital a bank or other financial institution has to have as required by its financial regulator. This is usually expressed as a capital adequacy ratio of equity as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. These requirements are put into place to ensure that these institutions do not take on excess leverage and risk becoming insolvent. Capital requirements govern the ratio of equity to debt, recorded on the liabilities and equity side of a firm&#x27;s balance sheet. They should not be confused with reserve requirements, which govern the assets side of a bank&#x27;s balance sheet—in particular, the proportion of its assets it must hold in cash or highly-liquid assets. Capital is a source of funds, not a use of funds.

From the 1880s to the end of the First World War, the capital-to-assets ratios globally declined sharply, before remaining relatively steady during the XXth century.
==Regulations==
A key part of bank regulation is to make sure that firms operating in the industry are prudently managed. The aim is to protect the firms themselves, their customers, the government (which is liable for the cost of deposit insurance in the event of a bank failure) and the economy, by establishing rules to make sure that these institutions hold enough capital to ensure continuation of a safe and efficient market and are able to withstand any foreseeable problems.

The main international effort to establish rules around capital requirements has been the Basel Accords, published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision housed at the Bank for International Settlements. This sets a framework on how banks and depository institutions must calculate their capital. After obtaining the capital ratios, the bank capital adequacy can be assessed and regulated. In 1988, the Committee decided to introduce a capital measurement system commonly referred to as Basel I. In June 2004 this framework was replaced by a significantly more complex capital adequacy framework commonly known as Basel II. Following the financial crisis of 2007–08, Basel II was replaced by Basel III, which will be gradually phased in between 2013 and 2019.

Another term commonly used in the context of the frameworks is economic capital, which can be thought of as the capital level bank shareholders would choose in the absence of capital regulation.

The capital ratio is the percentage of a bank&#x27;s capital to its risk-weighted assets. Weights are defined by risk-sensitivity ratios whose calculation is dictated under the relevant Accord. Basel II requires that the total capital ratio must be no lower than 8%.

Each national regulator normally has a very slightly different way of calculating bank capital, designed to meet the common requirements within their individual national legal framework.

Most developed countries implement Basel I and II, stipulate lending limits as a multiple of a bank&#x27;s capital &quot;eroded by the yearly inflation rate&quot;.

The five Cs of Credit—Character, Cash Flow, Collateral, Conditions and Covenants—have been replaced by one single criterion. While the international standards of bank capital were established in the 1988 Basel I accord, Basel II makes significant alterations to the interpretation, if not the calculation, of the capital requirement.

Examples of national regulators implementing Basel include the FSA in the UK, BaFin in Germany, OSFI in Canada, Banca d&#x27;Italia in Italy. In the United States the primary regulators implementing Basel include the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve.

In the European Union member states have enacted capital requirements based on the Capital Adequacy Directive CAD1 issued in 1993 and CAD2 issued in 1998.

In the United States, depository institutions are subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). These guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy based primarily on the perceived credit risk associated with balance sheet assets, as well as certain off-balance sheet exposures such as unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit, and derivatives and foreign exchange contracts. The risk-based capital guidelines are supplemented by a leverage financial ratio requirement. To be &quot;adequately capitalized&quot; under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4%, a combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital ratio of at least 8%, and a leverage ratio of at least 4%, and not be subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. To be &quot;well-capitalized&quot; under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital ratio of at least 10%, and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. These capital ratios are reported quarterly on the Call Report or Thrift Financial Report. Although Tier 1 capital has traditionally been emphasized, in the Late-2000s recession regulators and investors began to focus on tangible common equity, which is different from Tier 1 capital in that it excludes preferred equity.

Regulatory capital requirements typically (although not always) are imposed at both an individual bank entity level and at a group (or sub-group) level. This may therefore mean that several different regulatory capital regimes apply throughout a bank group at different levels, each under the supervision of a different regulator.

==Regulatory capital==

In the Basel II accord bank capital has been divided into two &quot;tiers&quot;, each with some subdivisions.

===Tier 1 capital===

Tier 1 capital, the more important of the two, consists largely of shareholders&#x27; equity and disclosed reserves. This is the amount paid up to originally purchase the stock (or shares) of the Bank (not the amount those shares are currently trading for on the stock exchange), retained profits subtracting accumulated losses, and other qualifiable Tier 1 capital securities (see below). In simple terms, if the original stockholders contributed $100 to buy their stock and the Bank has made $20 in retained earnings each year since, paid out no dividends, had no other forms of capital and made no losses, after 10 years the Bank&#x27;s tier one capital would be $300. Shareholders equity and retained earnings are now commonly referred to as &quot;Core&quot; Tier 1 capital, whereas Tier 1 is core Tier 1 together with other qualifying Tier 1 capital securities.

In India, the Tier 1 capital is defined as &quot;&#x27;Tier I Capital&#x27; means &quot;owned fund&quot; as reduced by investment in shares of other non-banking financial companies and in shares, debentures, bonds, outstanding loans and advances including hire purchase and lease finance made to and deposits with subsidiaries and companies in the same group exceeding, in aggregate, ten per cent of the owned fund; and perpetual debt instruments issued by a systemically important non-deposit taking non-banking financial company in each year to the extent it does not exceed 15% of the aggregate Tier I Capital of such company as on March 31 of the previous accounting year;&quot; (as per Non-Banking Financial (Non-Deposit Accepting or Holding) Companies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2007) In the context of NBFCs in India, the Tier I capital is nothing but net owned funds.

Owned funds stand for paid up equity capital, preference shares which are compulsorily convertible into equity, free reserves, balance in share premium account and capital reserves representing surplus arising out of sale proceeds of asset, excluding reserves created by revaluation of asset, as reduced by accumulated loss balance, book value of intangible assets and deferred revenue expenditure, if any.

===Tier 2 (supplementary) capital===

Tier 2 capital, supplementary capital, comprises undisclosed reserves, revaluation reserves, general provisions, hybrid instruments and subordinated term debt.

====Undisclosed reserves====
Undisclosed reserves are where a bank has made a profit but this has not appeared in normal retained profits or in general reserves.

====Revaluation reserves====
A revaluation reserve is a reserve created when a company has an asset revalued and an increase in value is brought to account. A simple example may be where a bank owns the land and building of its headquarters and bought them for $100 a century ago. A current revaluation is very likely to show a large increase in value. The increase would be added to a revaluation reserve.

====General provisions====
A general provision is created when a company is aware that a loss has occurred, but is not certain of the exact nature of that loss. Under pre-IFRS accounting standards, general provisions were commonly created to provide for losses that were expected in the future. As these did not represent incurred losses, regulators tended to allow them to be counted as capital.

====Hybrid debt capital instruments====
They consist of instruments which combine certain characteristics of equity as well as debt. They can be included in supplementary capital if they are able to support losses on an ongoing basis without triggering liquidation.

Sometimes, it includes instruments which are initially issued with interest obligation (e.g. debentures) but the same can later be converted into capital.

====Subordinated-term debt====
Subordinated debt is classed as Lower Tier 2 debt, usually has a maturity of a minimum of 10 years and ranks senior to Tier 1 capital, but subordinate to senior debt in terms of claims on liquidation proceeds. To ensure that the amount of capital outstanding does not fall sharply once a Lower Tier 2 issue matures and, for example, not be replaced, the regulator demands that the amount that is qualifiable as Tier 2 capital amortises (i.e. reduces) on a straight line basis from maturity minus 5 years (e.g. a 1bn issue would only count as worth 800m in calculating capital 4 years before maturity). The remainder qualifies as senior issuance. For this reason many Lower Tier 2 instruments were issued as 10 year non-call 5 year issues (i.e. final maturity after 10 years but callable after 5 years). If not called, issue has a large step—similar to Tier 1—thereby making the call more likely.

==Different international implementations==
Regulators in each country have some discretion on how they implement capital requirements in their jurisdiction.

For example, it has been reported that Australia&#x27;s Commonwealth Bank is measured as having 7.6% Tier 1 capital under the rules of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, but this would be measured as 10.1% if the bank was under the jurisdiction of the UK&#x27;s Prudential Regulation Authority. This demonstrates that international differences in implementation of the rule can vary considerably in their level of strictness.

===European Union===
In the EU countries the capital requirements as set out by Basel III agreement have been implemented by the so-called CRD IV package which commonly refers to both the EU Directive 2013/36/EU and the EU Regulation 575/2013.

==Common capital ratios==
*CET1 Capital Ratio = Common Equity Tier 1 / Risk-weighted assets ≥ 4.5%
*Tier 1 Capital Ratio = Tier 1 Capital / Risk-weighted assets ≥ 6%
*Total Capital Ratio = Total Capital (Tier 1 + Tier 2) / Risk-weighted assets ≥ 8%
*Leverage Ratio = Tier 1 Capital / Average total consolidated assets value ≥ 3%

<text>Dr Caroline St. John-Brooks (24 March 1947 in Oxford – 8 September 2003 in London) was an Anglo-Irish journalist and academic.

==Biography==
She gained a BA in English Literature from Trinity College Dublin, an MA in Education from the University of Ulster at Coleraine, and a PhD in the teaching of English in secondary schools from Bristol University in 1980. After graduation, she worked as an English lecturer for eight years, first in Ireland, where she was also an education writer for the Irish Times, and then at Bristol Polytechnic.

In 1979, she became Education Correspondent for the magazine &quot;New Society&quot;, and moved to the same position at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 1987. She became Assistant Editor of the &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot; (TES) in 1990.

Between 1994 and 1997, she worked as an education researcher at the OECD in Paris; publications include &quot;Schools Under Scrutiny&quot; (1995), &quot;Mapping the Future: Young People and Career Guidance&quot; (1996) and &quot;Parents as Partners in Schooling&quot; (1997).

She returned to the &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot; as Editor in 1997 and remained until 2000, when ill health forced her to resign. In three-and-a-half years she had modernised and expanded the paper, with new magazine sections appealing to the women who now predominated in education. From 2001 until her death she was a Governor of the University of Greenwich. She was also a member of the British-American Project.

She died of breast cancer at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London in September 2003, aged 56.

<text>Raymond Philip Shafer (March 5, 1917 – December 12, 2006) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 39th governor of Pennsylvania from 1967 to 1971. Prior to that, he served as the 23rd lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania from 1963 to 1967 and as a Pennsylvania state senator from 1959 to 1962. He was a national leader of the moderate wing of the Republican Party in the late 1960s.

Shafer was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, and spent his childhood in Meadville. He graduated from Allegheny College in 1938 and Yale Law School in 1941. Following brief stints practicing law in New York City and Meadville and United States Navy service as an intelligence officer and on PT boats during World War II, Shafer entered politics as a district attorney in 1948 and then as a state senator. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1962, under Governor Bill Scranton. Shafer was active in that role and succeeded the term-limited Scranton as governor in the 1966 election. Shafer became a prominent voice among moderate Republicans and oversaw constitutional reforms in Pennsylvania, the formation of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, expenditures for health and education programs, and proposed a state income tax, which proved unpopular but was later enacted by his successor, Milton Shapp.

Limited to one four-year term as governor under the prior state constitutional rule, Shafer was not a candidate in the 1970 gubernatorial election. He left office in 1971 with his popularity waning in the midst of fiscal strain and negative reaction to his tax proposal, though some of his administration&#x27;s major initiatives have had lasting significance. In his later career, he chaired what became known as the Shafer Commission at the request of President Richard Nixon, which recommended the decriminalization of personal marijuana possession and use within the home. He also resumed law practice in Meadville and served in other business and consulting roles in the private and public sectors. He died in Meadville in 2006.

==Early life and career==
Raymond Philip Shafer was born on March 5, 1917, in New Castle, Pennsylvania, the youngest of the five children of the Rev. David Philip Shafer and his wife Mina Belle (née Miller). In 1933, Shafer&#x27;s father moved the family to Meadville, Pennsylvania, to accept a position as pastor of the First Christian Church. Shafer became an Eagle Scout and as an adult was presented the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award by the Boy Scouts of America. He graduated from high school in Meadville in 1934 as valedictorian of his class.

After finishing high school, Shafer attended Allegheny College from 1934 to 1938, where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and served as class president. He graduated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and political science and was a candidate for a Rhodes Scholarship. At Allegheny, Shafer was an accomplished athlete, achieving all-Pennsylvania honors in basketball and all-American honors in soccer. In 1938, Shafer enrolled at Yale Law School and earned a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1941. While at Yale, Shafer participated in intramural sports, barrister&#x27;s union, and moot court. Several Yale classmates, such as Bill Scranton and Gerald Ford, would help shape his future political career. The summer after graduating from law school, in June, Shafer sat for the New York State bar exam and, on July 5, he married Jane Harris Davies, whom he had met at Allegheny. The couple went on to have three children together: Diane (born 1942), Raymond Philip Jr. (born ), and Jane (born 1953, died 1999). Shortly after their marriage, the Shafers settled in New York City and Ray joined the law firm of Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam &amp; Roberts.

In 1942, Shafer entered the United States Navy as a naval intelligence officer and later served on PT boats. He participated in over 80 combat missions during World War II on PT boats as commanding officer of PT-359 and later as executive officer of Squadron 27. As Squadron executive officer, Shafer sailed aboard PT-375, one of the first PT boats to penetrate the defenses of Manila Bay, Philippines, during the Battle of Manila. Shafer earned the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, as well as the rank of lieutenant during his tour in the Pacific theater.

The Shafers returned to Meadville after the war, where Ray entered private law practice. His political career began in 1948 when he was elected district attorney of Crawford County, a position Shafer held until 1956, serving two terms. In 1958, Shafer ran for a seat in the State Senate to represent the 50th District, consisting of portions of Crawford and Mercer counties. He defeated five-term state representative Edward M. Young in the Republican primary in May, 55% to 45%, aided significantly by a better than 8-to-1 showing in Crawford County. Shafer prevailed over the Democratic nominee, Harold B. Turner, in the November general election by a similar margin, 54% to 46%. While a state senator, Shafer began to accumulate a liberal-leaning voting record in support of such initiatives as anti-housing discrimination.

===Lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania (1963–1967)===
In March 1962, Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Scranton tapped Shafer as his running mate in that year&#x27;s gubernatorial election. Scranton had been Shafer&#x27;s classmate at Yale Law School, and both were part of the moderate wing of the Republican Party. Shafer accepted Scranton&#x27;s offer and became the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. The Scranton–Shafer ticket won the election by a margin of nearly a half million votes over the Democratic ticket led by Philadelphia mayor Richardson Dilworth and State Representative Stephen McCann, the House majority leader. Scranton and Shafer were inaugurated as governor and lieutenant governor, respectively, in January 1963.

As lieutenant governor, Shafer took a more active role in state government than his predecessors had and chaired Pennsylvania&#x27;s delegation to the 1964 Republican National Convention. During Scranton&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign for president of the United States that year, Shafer assumed some of the day-to-day responsibilities of the governorship in Scranton&#x27;s stead. The press took notice of Shafer&#x27;s activity as lieutenant governor, with &quot;The Republic&quot; in Meyersdale, Pennsylvania, reporting in November 1964 that Shafer&#x27;s speaking schedule was nearly as rigorous as Scranton&#x27;s and that Shafer had begun to assume responsibility for steering some of the Scranton administration&#x27;s initiatives, speculating that Shafer himself might be a candidate for governor to succeed the term-limited Scranton in 1966. Initiatives that Shafer led at Scranton&#x27;s request included the selection of a superintendent of public instruction, leadership of a private sector outreach tour regarding Scranton&#x27;s unemployment compensation proposal, and chairmanship of the administration&#x27;s legislative policy committee.

==Governor of Pennsylvania==
===1966 campaign===

Bill Scranton was limited to one term under then-existing state law and the media considered Shafer a potential successor as the Republican nominee. U.S. Representative Richard Schweiker had also indicated interest in seeking the nomination. On January 10, 1966, Shafer formally announced his candidacy for governor. The same day, Pennsylvania Attorney General Walter Alessandroni, Shafer&#x27;s running mate, announced his own candidacy for lieutenant governor. Both Shafer and Alessandroni were endorsed by Scranton, U.S. Senator Hugh Scott, and Schweiker, who had withdrawn from contention. The 1966 election was marked by tragedies. Alessandroni was killed in an aviation accident during the campaign and won the nomination for lieutenant governor posthumously; Ray Broderick was named to replace him on the ticket. Former governor David L. Lawrence collapsed and fell into a coma during a campaign appearance for the Democratic nominee, wealthy Philadelphia businessman Milton Shapp, and died later that November.

In the general election campaign, including in a television debate between Shafer and Shapp in October, Shafer attacked Shapp&#x27;s record as a businessman and Shapp charged that Shafer had obstructed important legislation, such as highway funding, as a state senator. Shafer and Shapp also disagreed sharply over price controls for milk; Shafer indicated that he would reform milk price controls to ensure fair market prices were placed, but Shapp insisted that Shafer&#x27;s arrangement would effectively continue the status quo of price controls and argued that abolition of the controls and a free market approach was superior. Heading into the weekend immediately prior to the election, &quot;The Times-Tribune&quot; in Scranton (whose editorial board had endorsed Shapp) reported that most polling showed the race between Shafer and Shapp to be relatively even and opined that Shapp had run a more effective and spirited campaign, though &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; reported less than a week before the election that Republican-commissioned polls showed Shafer ahead of Shapp by an average of 9.2% with Shapp falling further behind. On election day, Shafer and Broderick ultimately defeated Shapp and his running mate, Leonard Staisey, by a margin of nearly a quarter of a million votes, 52.1% to 46.1%, with the remainder of the votes scattered across minor candidates.

===Tenure (1967–1971)===
Shafer was inaugurated in January 1967 and became the first governor to reside in the modern Governor&#x27;s Mansion in Harrisburg. As governor, Shafer pushed for reforms to the state constitution. Lieutenant Governor Shafer chaired a bipartisan committee to explore constitutional reforms in 1963 and later included reforms in his campaign platform in 1966, ultimately announcing support for holding a constitutional convention. By the end of Shafer&#x27;s first year as governor, in December 1967, a constitutional convention was meeting to consider revisions to state government. Shafer had initially hoped for the election of convention delegates by the Pennsylvania electorate to coincide with a referendum on holding the convention on the primary ballot in May 1967, thus enabling the convention to meet that summer and submit their recommendations to the electorate in November. However, a skeptical General Assembly delayed passage of the convention enabling bill such that delegates were not elected until November 1967, to be seated the following month. Reforms approved by the electorate following this convention, at the primary election in April 1968, included revisions to home rule, audit of state finances, and a new unified judiciary under the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.

Shafer emerged as a national figure in the moderate wing of the Republican Party during the 1968 presidential election, giving the nominating speech for New York governor Nelson Rockefeller at the 1968 Republican National Convention, although the delegates instead chose former Vice President Richard Nixon as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate. Shafer himself had received votes in Pennsylvania&#x27;s presidential primary and initially received support from a majority of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 64-member convention delegation as a favorite son candidate; he used this leverage in a partially successful attempt to move the Pennsylvania delegation into Rockefeller&#x27;s column. After Shafer&#x27;s death, his surviving children told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Nixon had offered Shafer the vice presidential spot to balance the ticket with an Eastern moderate, though there is no surviving record to that effect. Nixon ultimately chose Maryland governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate.

Shafer oversaw an expansion of Pennsylvania&#x27;s highway system, dedicated several portions of the Interstate Highway System in the state, and authorized a merger of four agencies to form the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). Large expenditures for education and health programs Shafer authorized caused budget deficits by the 1969–70 fiscal year. In an effort to balance the budget, Shafer sought Pennsylvania&#x27;s first state income tax, a move which made him unpopular with many voters, though he later settled for an increase in the state sales tax. Ultimately, Shafer&#x27;s successor as governor, Milton Shapp, signed into law a state income tax with bipartisan support. During Shafer&#x27;s administration, state funding for public education increased by 33%, with public school teachers&#x27; salaries increasing by a similar proportion, and post-secondary educational institutions received approximately $114 million in additional funding from the state. Reflecting near the end of his administration, Shafer said he believed that his having prioritized constitutional reforms and public expenditure ahead of tax reform may have precipitated some of the fiscal strain the state faced by 1971, which included deficits as a result of such expenditure. Shafer also oversaw the state government&#x27;s response to the 1969 York Race Riot in which he declared a state of emergency and sent 200 National Guard troops into the city. In 1969, Shafer ascended to the vice-chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association and succeeded California governor Ronald Reagan as chair in 1970. In 1968 and 1969, Shafer was a member of the Executive Committee of the National Governors Association.

Although the new 1968 constitution allowed incumbent governors to run for reelection, Shafer was bound by the previous rules and was limited to one term. He campaigned for Ray Broderick, his lieutenant governor, as his successor. Although Broderick publicly opposed a state income tax and attempted to distance himself from Shafer&#x27;s record of large public expenditure, he was ultimately defeated. The 1970 election in Pennsylvania was a Democratic sweep, with Milton Shapp, whom Shafer and Broderick had defeated in 1966, victorious in the gubernatorial election and Democrats gaining control of both houses of the General Assembly for the first time in over 30 years. Shafer&#x27;s popularity waned towards the end of his administration in the midst of the state&#x27;s fiscal struggles and members of Republican Party leadership having turned against him. Many of Shafer&#x27;s critics held that he was unable to effectively galvanize public support for his initiatives or to manage political relationships, earning from some of these critics the derisive nickname &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; after a cartoon character known for acting haplessly with good intentions. However, some of these critics conceded the long-term significance of the Shafer administration&#x27;s accomplishments, particularly with respect to the constitutional reforms and education and other social services. Shafer left office following the expiration of his term and inauguration of governor-elect Shapp in January 1971.

==Post-gubernatorial career==
===Shafer Commission===

After leaving state government, Shafer had initially hoped to be appointed to a federal judgeship on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, though he ultimately did not receive an appointment and withdrew his candidacy for the bench in 1972. In the meantime, President Nixon appointed Shafer as chairman of the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse, also known as the Shafer Commission. However, Nixon paid little attention to Shafer or the Commission while it proceeded with its work, with one Washington, D.C., newspaper columnist reporting that Nixon treated Shafer &quot;like a dog&quot;. The Shafer Commission&#x27;s work nonetheless continued, though Shafer was also criticized in this role by many conservatives after the panel recommended the decriminalization of marijuana use within the home. The commission&#x27;s March 1972 report had also posited that marijuana use is not without drawbacks and argued that it should nonetheless be discouraged and that selling, growing with the intent to sell, and publicly using marijuana should remain prohibited; however, the commission&#x27;s recommendation on decriminalization was ultimately not followed by the Nixon administration. Some, such as Eric Sterling of &quot;HuffPost&quot;, argue that the Shafer Commission&#x27;s proposal was &quot;ahead of its time&quot;.

===Later life and legacy===
In February 1972, Shafer became chief executive officer and chairman of the board of the financially troubled TelePrompTer Corporation, which was then the largest cable television company in the United States. He served in this position until being replaced by Jack Kent Cooke, the company&#x27;s plurality shareholder, in October 1973. He then became chairman emeritus and vice chairman of TelePrompTer. Following the Watergate scandal, Shafer returned to public service upon being named special counsel to new Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, a position he held from 1974 to 1977. From 1977 to 1988 he was a partner and senior counselor with the accounting firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand and also maintained a law practice in Meadville. He served briefly as acting president of his alma mater, Allegheny College, from 1985 to 1986. Shafer also served on Allegheny&#x27;s board of trustees, including as chairman from 1972 to 1981, and on the Council on Foreign Relations. Shafer died at the age of 89 in Meadville, Pennsylvania, on December 12, 2006. He was buried with military honors at St. John&#x27;s Cemetery in Union Township, Crawford County, Pennsylvania.

Shafer was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Drexel University in 1968. A section of Interstate 79 in Pennsylvania is named &quot;The Raymond P. Shafer Highway&quot; after him, as is a residence hall at both Edinboro University of Pennsylvania and Indiana University of Pennsylvania and the auditorium at Allegheny College. Pennsylvania House Bill 1652 of 2011, introduced by Democratic State Representative Mark B. Cohen, and Pennsylvania Senate Bill 1003 of 2011, introduced by Democratic State Senator Daylin Leach, were both named &quot;The Governor Raymond P. Shafer Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act&quot;.

<text>William Henry &quot;Big Bill&quot; James (January 20, 1887 – May 25, 1942) was a professional baseball pitcher. He played all or part of eight seasons in Major League Baseball between 1911 and 1919. Primarily used as a starting pitcher, he played for the Cleveland Naps (1911–1912), St. Louis Browns (1914–1915), Detroit Tigers (1915–1919), Boston Red Sox (1919) and Chicago White Sox (1919). James was a switch hitter and threw right-handed. He was born in Detroit, Michigan.

In an eight-season career, Big Bill posted a 65–71 record with 408 strikeouts and a 3.20 ERA in 1179.2 innings pitched. In 1917, Chick Gandil and his teammate, Swede Risberg, allegedly collected $45 from each member of the White Sox and paid off the Detroit Tigers in two crucial doubleheaders late in the season. When Big Bill agreed that his team would go easy, the Tigers lost all four games, allowing the White Sox to win the American League pennant. He was one of the clean members on the 1919 Chicago White Sox team which was made famous by the Black Sox scandal. Even so, Big Bill gave up 8 hits, 3 walks, and 3 earned runs for a 5.79 ERA in innings pitched in the 1919 World Series.

Big Bill died in Venice, California, at age of 55.

==Best seasons==
* 1914: 15 wins, 109 SO, 2.85 ERA, 20 complete games, three shutouts, 284 innings.
* 1917: 13 wins, career-bests with 2.09 ERA (7th best in AL), 126 Adjusted ERA+ (8th in AL), 7.41 hits allowed per 9 innings pitched (8th in AL), and 12 batters hit by pitch (3rd in AL).

<text>Daehan Theological Seminary is a seminary providing training for prospective members of South Korea&#x27;s Presbyterian clergy. The campus is located in Anyang City, Gyeonggi province. The current president is Lee Seon (이선).

==Academics==

Much of the graduate training is devoted to the M.Th. and M.Div. degrees, which are targeted to future ministers. However, departments of Social Welfare and Administration provide some alternative courses of study.

==History==

The school shares its origin with Anyang University. The seed of both schools was planted in the Presbyterian Seminary established at Namdaemun Church in Seoul in 1948 by Yoon Pil Seong and others. Daehan Theological Seminary was not opened as a separate institution until 1998, at which time it offered the Master of Divinity (M.Div.) degree. In 2000, it began to offer the Master of Theology (Th.M.) degree as well.

<doc id="1341047" wikidata="Q172873" url="?curid=1341047" title="Circuit Mont-Tremblant">
<text>Circuit Mont-Tremblant is a race circuit located approximately north of Montreal, Quebec, in the city of Mont-Tremblant, Canada. It is the second-oldest existing race track in Canada, and was originally known as Circuit Mont-Tremblant-St-Jovite until it was renamed in the 1970s. Set in the shadow of the Mont-Tremblant ski hill, the twisting fifteen-corner track uses the natural topography and elevation of the land.

==History==
The idea was conceived by local business and hoteliers to boost tourism during the slower spring and summer periods to the levels they enjoyed during winter’s peak ski season. 

Legendary race driver Bruce McLaren is credited as a contributor to the design of the track which was completed in two sections; the original circuit was opened in 1964 and was extended to the following year.

===The 1960s – 1970s===
The first race was held August 3, 1964 on the original twelve-turn circuit and won by Ludwig Heimrath driving a Cooper-Ford. The completion of the bridge, media/officials complex and the pit stalls were ready just prior to the next race that September featuring sports cars and prototypes. Pedro Rodríguez driving Luigi Chinetti’s (N.A.R.T.) Ferrari 330 P would go on to win that race.

The Player’s Quebec Sports Car race in September 1965 would be the first event on the newly-expanded track and was won by John Surtees driving a Lola T-70.

On September 11, 1966 the track debuted the inaugural Canadian-American (Can-Am) Challenge Cup Series Race. John Surtees would win this event, followed by Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon. 

The following summer, on 6 August 1967, Mario Andretti would win both races of the twin 100-mile double header U.S.A.C. Indy Car event ahead of A.J. Foyt. A year later, Andretti would the repeat the same achievement, this time beating out Bobby Unser.

Circuit Mont-Tremblant hosted the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix on two occasions, in 1968 and 1970. Jochen Rindt started the 1968 race from pole position, but Denny Hulme went on to win. The second race marked the debut of the Tyrrell Racing team as a constructor. Jackie Stewart set the pole time and a new track record in the new Tyrrell 001. The Ferraris of Jacky Ickx and Clay Regazzoni would finish 1st and 2nd ahead of Chris Amon in 3rd. 

Throughout the late 1960’s and 70’s many of North America’s other top tier race championships such as Can-Am, Trans-Am, Formula 5000 and Formula Atlantic made their championship stops to the track. Many now famous drivers such as Denny Hulme, Bruce McLaren, Dan Gurney, Jackie Stewart, Bobby Rahal, Chris Amon, Mark Donohue, Roger Penske, Parnelli Jones, Al and Bobby Unser, Gordon Johncock, Alan Jones, Peter Revson, John Cannon, Elliot Forbes-Robinson, George Follmer and Gilles Villeneuve all competed at Circuit Mont-Tremblant during these years.

===The 1980s – 1990s===
Strong National Series such as the Rothmans Porsche (Turbo) Cup, the Players GM Challenge Series, the Honda-Michelin Series, Export A Formula 2000 and the Canadian Formula 1600 series would be predominant throughout the mid-1980s and 1990s, giving rise to some of Canada&#x27;s most prominent and recognized racing drivers, including Paul Tracy, Scott Goodyear, Ron Fellows, Greg Moore, Claude Bourbonnais, Richard Spenard, Patrick Carpentier and Alex Tagliani.

===The Jim Russell Racing School===
The circuit is also home to the well-known Jim Russell Racing Driver School (est. 1969) which is notable for graduating Gilles Villeneuve, Jacques Villeneuve, and more recently, F1 drivers Lance Stroll and Nicholas Latifi.

A CIK-FIA rated karting facility was added in 2010 to complement the Jim Russell Racing School&#x27;s development of young drivers, and has played host to the Canadian nationals.

===The 2000s – present===
New ownership has concentrated on updating the facility to improved FIA standards by repaving and widening the track, expanding the pit lane, and creating greater run-off areas, while attempting to preserve the character of the original layout. These updates have permitted the return of racing series like Grand Am (formerly Can-Am) and Indy car along with Superbikes and Historic Racing. The historic reputation of the race track and Mont-Tremblant’s appeal as a tourist destination keeps the track in constant demand amongst driving clubs, corporate events and major automotive manufacturers for car launches and driving programs such as Ferrari’s Corso Pilota, Lamborghini, Porsche, Audi, McLaren, Volvo, and BMW among others. On July 21, 2022 the track complex was purchased by 11938053 Canada Inc., a company owned by Montreal businessman Gad Bitton of Holand Automotive Group.

<doc id="1341049" wikidata="Q263713" url="?curid=1341049" title="Nevirapine">
<text>Nevirapine (NVP), sold under the brand name Viramune among others, is a medication used to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS, specifically HIV-1. It is generally recommended for use with other antiretroviral medications. It may be used to prevent mother to child spread during birth but is not recommended following other exposures. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include rash, headache, nausea, feeling tired, and liver problems. The liver problems and skin rash may be severe and should be checked for during the first few months of treatment. It appears to be safe for use during pregnancy. It is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and works by blocking the function of reverse transcriptase.
Nevirapine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
Nevirapine is used in people six years of age and older infected with HIV-1 as part of combination antiretroviral treatment (ART or cART). Monotherapy with nevirapine is not indicated due to rapid emergence of resistance.

Nevirapine in triple combination therapy has been shown to suppress viral load effectively when used as initial antiretroviral therapy (&quot;i.e.&quot;, in antiretroviral-naive patients). Some clinical trials have demonstrated comparable HIV suppression with nevirapine-based regimens to that achieved with regimens based on a protease inhibitor (PI) or efavirenz.

This drug is generally only to be considered for use if the CD4 cell count is very low.

Although concerns have been raised about nevirapine-based regimens in those starting therapy with high viral load or low CD4 count, some analyses suggest that nevirapine may be effective in this group of people.

Nevirapine may also form a useful component of salvage regimens after virological failure, usually in combination with one or more PIs as well as nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTIs), especially in those who have not previously taken an NNRTI.

Dosing in children is based on body surface area (BSA), however, weight-based dosing algorithms have been released. These guidelines include dosing algorithms for as young as newborn babies.

===Preventing mother-to-child transmission===

Although a single dose of nevirapine given to both mother and child reduced the rate of HIV transmission by almost 50% compared with a very short course of zidovudine (AZT) prophylaxis, in a clinical trial in Uganda., that trial was found in an Associated Press investigation to be riddled with &quot;sloppy recordkeeping&quot; and possibly fraud. A subsequent study in Thailand showed that prophylaxis with single-dose nevirapine in addition to zidovudine is more effective than zidovudine alone. These and other trials have led the World Health Organization to endorse the use of single-dose nevirapine prophylaxis in many developing world settings as a cost-effective way of reducing mother-to-child transmission. However, in the United States the Ugandan study was deemed flawed and as of 2006 the FDA has not approved of such nevirapine prophylaxis. However, supporters of HIVNET 012 experiment argued that the flaws in this experiment were largely due to bureaucratic incompetence, while the findings regarding the safety and efficacy of single-dose nevirapine from this study were scientifically solid and too important to discard. Moreover, it was argued that holding African researchers who operated under resource-poor situations to the same moral and procedural standards to their Western counterparts was unrealistic, and would further marginalize African researchers&#x27; role in the science community and impede the progress of African science. Another clinical trial, &quot;Using Nevirapine to Prevent Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission During Breastfeeding&quot;, was completed in September 2013. 

A major concern with this approach is that NNRTI resistance mutations are commonly observed in both mothers and infants after single-dose nevirapine, and may compromise the response to future NNRTI-containing regimens. A short course of maternal Lamivudine/zidovudine is recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service Task Force to reduce this risk.

===Nonoccupational Post-Exposure Prophylaxis===
Nevirapine is contraindicated for non-occupational post-exposure-prophylaxis including for pregnant and nonpregnant women due to severe liver toxicity.

==Adverse effects==

The most common adverse effect of nevirapine is the development of mild or moderate rash (13%). Severe or life-threatening skin reactions have been observed in 1.5% of patients, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity.

Nevirapine may cause severe or life-threatening liver toxicity, usually emerging in the first six weeks of treatment. In 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning on nevirapine, warning that it could cause life-threatening liver toxicity and skin reactions. Unacceptably high risk of serious liver symptoms in certain patient groups (women with CD4 count &gt;250 and men &gt;400) has led the U.S. DHHS to recommend the restriction of nevirapine use to those at lower risk, unless the benefit to the patient clearly outweighs the risk; although in the 2NN study which found these CD4 limits, the effect was seen only in patients recruited from Thailand. More recent studies on the use of Nevirapine in people with higher CD4 cell counts have come to the following conclusion: Treatment-experienced patients who start NVP-based combination therapy with low pre–ART and high current CD4 cell counts and an undetectable VL have a similar likelihood for discontinuing NVP therapy because of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), compared with treatment-naive patients with low CD4 cell counts. This suggests that NVP-based combination therapy may be safely initiated in such patients. However, in similar patients with a detectable VL, it is prudent to continue to adhere to current CD4 cell count thresholds. The U.S. Public Health Service Task Force advocates caution in the use of nevirapine in pregnancy due to toxicity issues, which may be exacerbated during pregnancy.

Cases of immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution have also been observed with this drug.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends stopping nevirapine if a person experiences:
* sign and symptoms of liver issues such as hepatitis
* increased transaminases in addition to rash or systemic symptoms
* formation of rash with systemic symptoms
* severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions
Additionally, the U.S. FDA recommends close monitoring during the first 6 weeks of therapy for the above symptoms as there is high risk during this time. Continued monitoring is recommended for up to the first 18 weeks of treatment. If a patient experiences hepatitis plus rash or other systemic symptoms, or severe hypersensitivity or skin rash, nevirapine should not be restarted.

==Drug interactions==
Nevirapine is a substrate for liver CYP3A and CYP2B6 enzymes. Concomitant administration of drugs that are inhibitors of these enzymes may increase serum nevirapine levels significantly. Some examples of these drugs include ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fluconazole. On the other hand, drugs that are inducers of these enzymes such as rifampicin may lower serum nevirapine levels.[18]

In addition, concomitant use of St. John&#x27;s wort &quot;(Hypericum perforatum&quot;, which has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP1A2) or St. John&#x27;s wort containing products may significantly lower nevirapine levels.

Nevirapine is an inducer of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. It may reduce levels of several co-administered drugs including the antiretrovirals efavirenz, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir, as well as clarithromycin, ketoconazole, forms of hormonal contraception, and methadone.

==Mechanism of action==

Nevirapine falls in the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class of antiretrovirals. Both nucleoside and non-nucleoside RTIs inhibit the same target, the reverse transcriptase enzyme, an essential viral enzyme which transcribes viral RNA into DNA. Unlike nucleoside RTIs, which bind at the polymerase active site, NNRTIs bind to a hydrophobic pocket in the subdomain of p66 which is about 10 angstrom away from the active site (known as the NNRTI pocket). Therefore, this NNRTI-binding pocket will inhibit reverse transcription in a way that is distinct to the NRTIs.

Nevirapine is not effective against HIV-2, as the pocket of the HIV-2 reverse transcriptase has a different structure, which confers intrinsic resistance to the NNRTI class.

Resistance to nevirapine develops rapidly if viral replication is not completely suppressed. The most common mutations observed after nevirapine treatment are Y181C and K103N, which are also observed with other NNRTIs. As all NNRTIs bind within the same pocket, viral strains which are resistant to nevirapine are usually also resistant to the other NNRTIs, efavirenz and delavirdine. However, second generation NNRTIs like rilpivirine and etravirine are effective in treatment for HIV strains resistant to nevirapine and other first generation drugs in that same class.

==History==
Nevirapine was discovered by Karl D. Hargrave and colleagues at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., one of the Boehringer Ingelheim group of companies. It is covered by U.S. Patent 5,366,972 and corresponding foreign patents. Nevirapine was the first NNRTI approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was approved June 21, 1996 for adults and September 11, 1998, for children. It was also approved in Europe in 1997.

==Society and culture==
Former U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s PEPFAR funding of $500 million to help combat the African AIDS epidemic included nevirapine, among other medications and programs.

In South Africa, the Treatment Action Campaign successfully sued the government over its failure to make nevirapine widely available. In Minister of Health v Treatment Action Campaign the Constitutional Court of South Africa ordered the government to immediately &quot;remove the restrictions that prevent Nevirapine from being made available for the purpose of reducing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV at public hospitals and clinics that are not research and training sites [and] permit and facilitate the use of Nevirapine for the purpose of reducing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and to make it available for this purpose at hospitals and clinics when in the judgement of the attending medical practitioner acting in consultation with the medical superintendent of the facility concerned this is medically indicated, which shall if necessary include that the mother concerned has been appropriately tested and counselled.&quot;

<text>Udonis Johneal Haslem ( ; born June 9, 1980) is an American professional basketball executive and former player. He is the vice president of basketball development for the Miami Heat, where he spent his entire 20-year playing career in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Haslem is one of only three players in NBA history to play at least 20 years with one team. He played college basketball for the Florida Gators, where he was a key member of four NCAA tournament teams. Haslem began his professional career in France with Chalon-sur-Saône and then signed with his hometown Miami Heat in 2003, leaving as the longest-tenured player in franchise history when he retired in 2023. Haslem won three NBA championships with the Heat in 2006, 2012, and 2013.

==Early life==
Haslem was born in Miami. His father, John, played college basketball for the Stetson Hatters from 1972 to 1974. His mother, Debra, was Puerto Rican. Haslem attended Wolfson High School in Jacksonville, Florida, then Miami Senior High School in Miami. He helped lead Miami High to state titles in 1997 and 1998 (the last two of three in a row), playing alongside another future NBA player, Steve Blake. The team was coached by UMass Amherst head coach Frank Martin.

However, an investigation by the &quot;Miami New Times&quot; revealed that Haslem, Blake, and several other players circumvented residency requirements. The &quot;New Times&quot; reported that while he claimed to live in Miami, Haslem lived in Miramar. His official school address was an efficiency apartment owned by a longtime Miami High booster, which was also a violation of Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) rules. As a result, Miami High was stripped of its 1998 title and ordered to forfeit its entire schedule.

==College career==
Haslem accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Billy Donovan&#x27;s Gators teams from 1998 to 2002 while majoring in leisure service management. As the Gators&#x27; starting center for four years, Haslem was part of Donovan&#x27;s 1998 recruiting class that raised the national prominence of the Florida Gators basketball program and included future Miami Heat teammate Mike Miller. Haslem&#x27;s sophomore season saw the team advance to the NCAA men&#x27;s Division I basketball championship game before falling to the Michigan State Spartans 89–76. The Gators received NCAA tournament invitations four consecutive years during Haslem&#x27;s college career—the first time in the program&#x27;s history. During his tenure with Florida, Haslem averaged 13.7 points per game and 6.7 rebounds. He was named to the coaches&#x27; All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) team four times: as the third team in 1999 and 2000, and the first team in 2001 and 2002. Haslem also ranks third in team history in points scored (1,782) and tenth in rebounds (831). He was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a &quot;Gator Great&quot; in 2012.

==Professional career==

===Chalon-Sur-Saône (2002–2003)===
Haslem went undrafted in the 2002 NBA draft primarily due to his relative lack of size for a forward as he measured just at the NBA pre-draft camp. Seattle SuperSonics coach Nate McMillan had promised to draft Haslem if he was still available in the second round, but the offer fell through. Haslem accepted an offer to join the Atlanta Hawks for training camp and made their roster for the Shaw&#x27;s Pro Summer League. However, he was released by the Hawks before the start of the 2002–03 NBA season.

Haslem signed with Chalon-Sur-Saône of the French LNB Pro A. He arrived in France weighing nearly . While in France, Haslem lost in eight months. He averaged 16.1 points and 9.4 rebounds per game in his lone season with the team.

===Miami Heat (2003–2023)===

====2003–08: All-Rookie honors and first championship====

On August 6, 2003, Haslem signed with his hometown team, the Miami Heat. As a rookie, Haslem played in the Rookie Challenge during All-Star weekend, earned NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors, and helped the Heat reach the Eastern Conference Semifinals.

In 2004–05, Haslem started in all 80 games in which he appeared, averaging 10.9 points, a career-high 9.1 rebounds, and 1.4 assists in 33.4 minutes per game. Haslem&#x27;s .540 field goal percentage ranked fifth on the Heat&#x27;s all-time single-season list then and fourth in the NBA. He appeared in Rookie Challenge for the second straight year, this time for the sophomore team.

Haslem re-signed with the Heat in August 2005. In June 2006, he helped the Heat win their first NBA Championship in six games over the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals. Haslem recorded 17 points and 10 rebounds in the title-clinching Game 6.

Haslem scored a career-high 28 points on November 10, 2006, in a 113–106 victory over the New Jersey Nets.

Since the 2007–08 season, Haslem was hired as the team captain for the Miami Heat. On January 29, 2008, Haslem—who had been the only Miami player to start all 43 games of the 2007–08 season—sustained a sprained ankle during a 117–87 loss to the Boston Celtics. He returned to action on February 23, only to play in five games before being ruled out for the rest of the season after reaggravating the ankle injury on March 7 against the Golden State Warriors. Haslem averaged a career-high 12.0 points per game in 2007–08.

====2009–13: Back-to-back championships====
In July 2010, Haslem signed a five-year deal worth approximately $20 million to remain with the Heat. The contract paid him roughly $14 million less than Haslem could have received if he accepted more lucrative offers from the Dallas Mavericks or Denver Nuggets. Haslem continued on with a new-look Heat roster that included LeBron James and Chris Bosh teaming up with Dwyane Wade. In November 2010, Haslem sustained a torn ligament in his foot, which sidelined him for the rest of the regular season. Haslem returned to action in May 2011 during the playoffs. That June, the Heat were defeated in six games by the Mavericks in 2011 NBA Finals.

Haslem helped the Heat return to the NBA Finals in 2012. The team defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games with Haslem winning his second championship.

In November 2012, Haslem passed Alonzo Mourning to become the franchise leader in total rebounds with 4,808, breaking Mourning&#x27;s previous record of 4,807. Haslem also became the first undrafted player to lead an NBA franchise in rebounding. In June 2013, Haslem won his third championship after the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in seven games in the NBA Finals. After the NBA Finals, Haslem revealed that he had played through much of the second half of the 2012–13 season with a torn right meniscus.

====2013–23: &quot;Player-coach&quot; role and retirement====
In 2013–14, Haslem lost the rotation spot he had long occupied, and his on-court time continued to diminish as the season progressed significantly. Haslem played in just seven games in January and February combined, and played only two total minutes from January 21 to February 27. He played in just 46 regular season games in 2013–14, averaging 3.8 points and 3.8 rebounds. The Heat returned to the NBA Finals in 2014 for the fourth straight year, where they were defeated in five games by the Spurs. Following the 2013–14 season, Haslem decided to opt out of the final year of his contract.

Haslem re-signed with the Heat on a two-year deal in July 2014. At this point of his career, he transitioned into a role that he and the organisation described as a &quot;player-coach&quot;, in that he rarely played on court but was more of a mentor to the younger players and assisted in their coaching. He re-signed with the Heat on one-year deals in 2016, 2017, and 2018. In January 2019, Haslem indicated that the 2018–19 season would be his last. However, in April 2019, Haslem stated that he had not decided if he was retiring and the decision would not be made until the 2019–20 season.

On August 6, 2019, Haslem re-signed with the Heat on a one-year contract. During the 2019–20 season, he played in four games, including starting at power forward in a 109–92 loss to the Indiana Pacers during the regular-season finale. During that season, Haslem became the 30th player in league history to play after turning 40 years old, as well as the first modern era undrafted player to play to that age. Following Vince Carter&#x27;s retirement during the suspension of the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Haslem became the oldest active player in the NBA. The Heat reached the 2020 NBA Finals, losing in six games to the Los Angeles Lakers; Haslem was on the active roster but did not play in the postseason.

On November 28, 2020, Haslem re-signed with the Heat. He played in a single game in the 2020–21 season, on May 13, 2021, against the Philadelphia 76ers. Haslem scored four points in two minutes off the bench before getting ejected as a result of a scuffle with Dwight Howard, making the 40-year-old Haslem the oldest player in the last 20 years to get ejected.

On August 15, 2021, Haslem re-signed with the Heat.

On August 23, 2022, Haslem announced his intentions to retire after the 2022–23 season, re-signing with the Heat for another year. In his final regular season game on April 9, 2023, Haslem scored 24 points in 25 minutes during a 123–110 victory over the Orlando Magic. He became the second 42-year-old in NBA history to score 24 or more points in a game after Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did so in Game 3 of the 1989 NBA Finals and it marked Haslem&#x27;s highest-scoring output since 2009. His three three-point shots in the game was a career-high.

At the age 42 years and 363 days, Haslem became the oldest person to play in the NBA Finals when he entered the fourth quarter of Game 3 of the NBA Finals with 29.8 seconds remaining, breaking the mark of 42 years, 58 days set by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1989. After the Heat lost the NBA Finals to the Denver Nuggets in five games, Haslem officially announced his retirement on July 28, 2023. The Heat retired Haslem&#x27;s 40 jersey on January 19, 2024.

==Post-playing career==
On November 8, 2023, the Heat hired Haslem to hold the role of vice president of basketball development. In 2024, Haslem began working as a television analyst, appearing on NBA TV&#x27;s postseason panel. He has also made appearances for ESPN. 

==Other appearances==
Haslem appeared in the music video for the song &quot;GDFR&quot; by Flo Rida, as well as the music video for &quot;Bet That&quot; by Trick Daddy, and the music video for Born-N-Raised by DJ Khaled, Pitbull, Trick Daddy, and Rick Ross.

==Personal life==

Haslem is married to Faith Rein-Haslem, a sports broadcaster he dated for 14 years. They met in 1999 while attending the University of Florida, where she was a member of the Florida Gators track and field team. They have three sons. Haslem also has two brothers and three sisters.

After retirement, Haslem engaged in countless acts of philanthropy under the umbrella of his organization: the Udonis Haslem Children’s Foundation (UD Kids). He also partnered up with Wells Fargo, The Bank of Doing to help repair homes in his area.

Haslem, among other high-profile athletes and celebrities, was a paid spokesperson for FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. In November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy and wiped out billions of dollars in customer funds. Haslem, alongside other spokespeople, is currently being sued for promoting unregistered securities through a class-action lawsuit. In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.

<text>William Lawrence &quot;Seattle Bill&quot; James (March 12, 1892 – March 10, 1971) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher. He was given a nickname to differentiate him from his contemporary, &quot;Big&quot; Bill James.

The Braves purchased James in from the Seattle Giants of the Northwestern League. In 1914, James was an integral member of the &quot;Miracle Braves&quot; team that went from last place to first place in two months, becoming the first team to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July. In his only full season, James posted a record of 26 wins against 7 losses. The Braves then went on to defeat Connie Mack&#x27;s heavily favored Philadelphia Athletics in the 1914 World Series. James was 2–0 in the World Series as the Braves recorded the first sweep in Series history. His victory in Game Two was a 1-0 shutout.

During World War I, James was an instructor at bomb-throwing for the US Army. He pitched in the minor leagues until 1925.

<text>Bill James (15 August 1929 – 17 June 2023) is a pseudonym of Allan James Tucker, a Welsh novelist. He also wrote under his own name and the pseudonyms &quot;David Craig&quot; and &quot;Judith Jones&quot;. He was a reporter with the Daily Mirror and various other newspapers after serving with the RAF He was married, with four children, and lived in South Wales.

The bulk of his output under the Bill James pseudonym is the &quot;Harpur and Iles&quot; series. Colin Harpur is a Detective Chief Inspector and Desmond Iles is the Assistant Chief Constable in an unnamed coastal city in southwestern England. Harpur and Iles are complemented by an evolving cast of other recurring characters on both sides of the law. The books are characterized by a grim humour and a bleak view of the relationship between the public, the police force and the criminal element. The first few are designated &quot;A Detective Colin Harpur Novel&quot; but as the series progressed they began to be published with the designation &quot;A Harpur &amp; Iles Mystery&quot;.

His novel &quot;Whose Little Girl are You&quot;, written under the &quot;David Craig&quot; pseudonym, was filmed as &quot;The Squeeze&quot;, starring Stacy Keach, Edward Fox and David Hemmings. The fourth &quot;Harpur &amp; Iles&quot; novel, &quot;Protection&quot;, was televised by the BBC in 1996 as &quot;Harpur &amp; Iles&quot;, starring Aneirin Hughes as Harpur and Hywel Bennett as Iles.

<text>&quot;Kick the Can&quot; is episode 86 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on February 9, 1962, on CBS.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Charles Whitley, a retiree at Sunnyvale Rest Home, thinks he has discovered the secret of youth. He is convinced that if he acts young, he will become young. His oldest and best friend Ben Conroy, whom he has known since childhood, thinks he is going crazy, and is able to persuade the home&#x27;s superintendent, Mr. Cox that this is the case. Mr. Cox decides to put Charles in isolation and under observation. Ben tries to convince Charles to act as sedate as the other residents in order to avoid this fate, to no avail. While Ben sees aging as an inescapable fact of life, Charles is convinced that Ben&#x27;s thinking of himself as old is what made him old.

That night, Charles convinces a number of residents to play a game of kick the can with him. He tries to talk Ben into joining them, but Ben refuses. The residents light a firecracker and throw it out a window, the noise drawing the nurse&#x27;s attention so they can sneak out the door. Meanwhile, Ben alerts Mr. Cox to what the other residents are up to. They run outside to find a group of children playing kick the can instead. Ben recognizes one of the children as Charles, who has become young again. He begs young Charley for a chance to go with him, but the boy seems not to know him, and dashes away into the darkness. Mr. Cox searches elsewhere for the elderly residents, while Ben walks slowly to the front steps of Sunnyvale and sits there with the can, alone, knowing that Mr. Cox can look all he wants for the residents... and that he will never find them.

==Remake==
&quot;Kick the Can&quot; was remade into a segment in &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Scatman Crothers as Mr. Bloom.

In this version, an old man named Mr. Bloom has just moved into Sunnyvale Retirement Home. He listens to the other elders reminisce about the joys they experienced in their youth. Mr. Bloom says just because they are old does not mean they cannot enjoy life anymore. He tells them that later that night, he will wake them and that they can join him in a game of kick the can. Leo Conroy objects, saying that now that they are all old they cannot engage in physical activity.

While Mr. Conroy sleeps, Mr. Bloom gathers the rest of the residents outside and plays the game, during which they are transformed into childhood versions of themselves. They are ecstatic to be young again and engage in activities they enjoyed long ago, but their thoughts soon turn to practical matters such as where they will spend the night, since they will no longer be welcomed in the retirement home and their families won&#x27;t recognize them. They ask to be old again. Mr. Bloom grants their wish. Leo Conroy wakes up and witnesses one resident, Mr. Agee, who still remains young, and asks for Agee to take him along. Agee tells Conroy that he cannot go with him.

The segment ends with Conroy kicking a can around the yard, hoping to recreate the spell that made Agee young again, while Mr. Bloom leaves Sunnyvale and moves into another retirement home, to spread his good-natured magical skills to other senior citizens.

<text>The Declaration by United Nations was the main treaty that formalized the Allies of World War II and was signed by 47 national governments between 1942 and 1945. On 1 January 1942, during the Arcadia Conference in Washington D.C., the Allied &quot;Big Four&quot;—the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China—signed a short document which later came to be known as the United Nations Declaration, and the next day the representatives of 22 other nations added their signatures.

The other original signatories on the next day (2 January 1942) were the four dominions of the British Commonwealth (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa); eight European governments-in-exile (Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Yugoslavia); nine countries in the Americas (Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama); and one non-independent government, the British-appointed Government of India.

The Declaration by United Nations became the basis of the United Nations (UN), which was formalized in the UN Charter, signed by 50 countries on 26 June 1945.

== Background ==
The Allies of World War II first expressed their principles and vision for the post-World War II world in the Declaration of St. James&#x27;s Palace agreed at the First Inter-Allied Conference in June 1941. The Anglo-Soviet Agreement was signed in July 1941 forming a military alliance between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The two main principles of these agreements, a commitment to the war and renunciation of a separate peace, formed the basis for the later Declaration by United Nations.

The Atlantic Charter was agreed a month later between Britain and the United States, to which the other Allies, now including the Soviet Union, agreed to adhere at the Second Inter-Allied Conference in September.

==Drafting==
The Declaration by United Nations was drafted during the Arcadia Conference at the White House on December 29, 1941, by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Roosevelt&#x27;s aide Harry Hopkins. It incorporated Soviet suggestions but left no role for France. 

Roosevelt coined the term &quot;United Nations&quot; to describe the Allied countries and suggested it as an alternative to the name &quot;Associated Powers&quot; (the U.S. was never formally a member of the Allies of World War I but entered the war in 1917 as a self-styled &quot;Associated Power&quot;). Churchill accepted it and noted that the phrase was used by Lord Byron in the poem &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot; (Stanza 35). 

The parties pledged to uphold the Atlantic Charter, to employ all their resources in the war against the Axis powers, and that none of the signatory nations would seek to negotiate a separate peace with any party to the Tripartite Pact in the same manner that the nations of the Triple Entente had agreed not to negotiate a separate peace with any or all of the Central Powers in World War I.

One major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for religious freedom, which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted.

The text of the declaration affirmed the signatories&#x27; perspective &quot;that complete victory over their enemies is essential to defend life, liberty, independence and religious freedom, and to preserve human rights and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands, and that they are now engaged in a common struggle against savage and brutal forces seeking to subjugate the world&quot;. The principle of &quot;complete victory&quot; established an early precedent for the Allied policy of obtaining the Axis&#x27; powers&#x27; &quot;unconditional surrender&quot;. The defeat of &quot;Hitlerism&quot; constituted the overarching objective, and represented a common Allied perspective that the totalitarian militarist regimes ruling Germany, Italy, and Japan were indistinguishable. 

The declaration, furthermore, was consistent with the Wilsonian principles of self determination, thus linking U.S. war aims in both world wars.

== Adoption ==
The Declaration was officially signed on 1 January 1942 by the Big Four —the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China—followed the next day by representatives of 22 other governments. The term &quot;United Nations&quot; became synonymous during the war with the Allies and was considered to be the formal name that they were fighting under.

The Declaration by United Nations became the basis of the modern United Nations. By the end of the war, 21 other states had acceded to the declaration, including the Philippines (a non-independent, US commonwealth at the time), France, every Latin American state except Argentina, and the various independent states of the Middle East and Africa. Although most of the minor Axis powers had switched sides and joined the United Nations as co-belligerents against Germany by the end of the war, they were not allowed to accede to the declaration. Occupied Denmark did not sign the declaration, but because of the vigorous resistance after 1943, and because the Danish ambassador Henrik Kauffmann had expressed the adherence to the declaration of all free Danes, Denmark was nonetheless invited among the allies in the San Francisco Conference in March 1945.

<doc id="1341067" wikidata="Q277986" url="?curid=1341067" title="Wigwam">
<text>A wigwam, wikiup, wetu (Wampanoag), or wiigiwaam (Ojibwe, in syllabics: ) is a semi-permanent domed dwelling formerly used by certain Native American tribes and First Nations people and still used for ceremonial events. The term &quot;wikiup&quot; is generally used to refer to these kinds of dwellings in the Southwestern United States and Western United States and Northwest Alberta, Canada, while &quot;wigwam&quot; is usually applied to these structures in the Northeastern United States as well as Ontario and Quebec in central Canada. The names can refer to many distinct types of Indigenous structures regardless of location or cultural group. The wigwam is not to be confused with the Native Plains tipi, which has a different construction, structure, and use.

==Structure==

The domed, round shelter was used by numerous northeastern Indigenous tribes. The curved surfaces make it an ideal shelter for all kinds of conditions. Indigenous peoples in the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands resided in either wigwams or longhouses.

These structures are made with a frame of arched poles, most often wooden, which are covered with some sort of bark roofing material. Details of construction vary with the culture and local availability of materials. Some of the roofing materials used include grass, brush, bark, rushes, mats, reeds, hides or cloth.

Wigwams are most often seasonal structures, although the term is applied to rounded and conical structures that are more permanent. Wigwams usually take longer to put up than tipis. Their frames are usually not portable like a tipi.

A typical wigwam in the Northeast has a curved surface which can hold up against the worst weather. Young green tree saplings of just about any type of wood, long, were cut down and bent. While the saplings were being bent, a circle was drawn on the ground. The diameter of the circle varied from . The bent saplings were then placed over the drawn circle, using the tallest saplings in the middle and the shorter ones on the outside. The saplings formed arches all in one direction on the circle. The next set of saplings were used to wrap around the wigwam to give the shelter support. When the two sets of saplings were finally tied together, the sides and roof were placed on it. The sides of the wigwam were usually bark stripped from trees. The male of the family was responsible for the framing of the wigwam.

Mary Rowlandson uses the term &quot;wigwam&quot; in reference to the dwelling places of Indigenous people that she stayed with while in their captivity during King Philip&#x27;s War in 1675. The term &quot;wigwam&quot; has remained in common English usage as a synonym for any &quot;Indian house&quot;; however, this usage is dispreferred, as there are important differences between the wigwam and other shelters.

During the American revolution the term &quot;wigwam&quot; was used by British soldiers to describe a wide variety of makeshift structures.

===Wickiups of the west===
Wickiups were used by different indigenous peoples of the Great Basin, Southwest, and Pacific Coast. They were single room, dome-shaped dwellings, with a great deal of variation in size, shape, and materials.

The Acjachemen, an indigenous people of California, built cone-shaped huts made of willow branches covered with brush or mats made of tule leaves. Known as &quot;kiichas&quot;, the temporary shelters were utilized for sleeping or as refuge in cases of inclement weather. When a dwelling reached the end of its practical life it was simply burned, and a replacement erected in its place in about a day&#x27;s time.

Below is a description of Chiricahua wickiups recorded by anthropologist Morris Opler:

The home in which the family lives is made by the men and is ordinarily a circular, dome-shaped brush dwelling, with the floor at ground level. It is high at the center and approximately in diameter. To build it, long fresh poles of oak or willow are driven into the ground or placed in holes made with a digging stick. These poles, which form the framework, are arranged at intervals and are bound together at the top with yucca-leaf strands. Over them a thatching of bundles of big bluestem grass or bear grass is tied, shingle style, with yucca strings. A smoke hole opens above a central fireplace allows smoke to escape when the firepit is used. A hide, suspended at the entrance, is fixed on a cross-beam so that it may be swung forward or backward. The doorway may face in any direction. For waterproofing, pieces of hide are thrown over the outer hatching, and in rainy weather, if a fire is not needed, even the smoke hole is covered. In warm, dry weather much of the outer roofing is stripped off. It takes approximately three days to erect a sturdy dwelling of this type. These houses are &quot;warm and comfortable even though there is a big snow&quot;. The interior is lined with brush and grass beds over which robes are spread...

==&quot;Wigwam&quot; in different Algonquian languages==
The English word &quot;wigwam&quot; derives from Eastern Abenaki , from Proto-Algonquian &quot;*wi·kiwa·ʔmi&quot;. Others have similar names for the structure:

* (with vowel syncope) in Abenaki
* in the Anishinaabe language
** (with vowel syncope) in Eastern Ojibwe and in Odaawaa
** (with vowel syncope) in Potawatomi WNLAP spelling
** in the Algonquin language as an alternative (with the indefinite prefix &quot;m-&quot; instead of the definite third-person prefix &quot;w-&quot;)
* in the Blackfoot language (without the possessive theme suffix &quot;-m&quot;)
* in the Cheyenne language (with the indefinite prefix &quot;m-&quot; instead of the definite third-person prefix &quot;w-&quot; and without the possessive theme suffix &quot;-m&quot;)
* in the Miami-Illinois language
* in the Mi&#x27;kmaq language
* &quot;wicuw&quot; in the Mohegan language
* in the Nipmuck language
* in Unami

wickiup:
* in Fox
* in Cree (with the indefinite prefix &quot;m-&quot; instead of the definite third-person prefix &quot;w-&quot;)
* in Montagnais (with the indefinite prefix &quot;m-&quot; instead of the definite third-person prefix &quot;w-&quot;)
* in Menominee
* in Sauk

==Similar dwellings elsewhere==
Nearly identical constructions, called &quot;aqal&quot;, are used by modern nomadic Somali people as well as the Afar people on the Horn of Africa. Pieces of old clothing or plastic sheet, woven mats (traditionally made of grass), or whatever material is available will be used to cover the &quot;aqal&quot;s roof. Similar domed tents are also used by the Bushmen and Nama people and other indigenous peoples in Southern Africa.

The traditional semi-permanent dwelling of the Sámi people of Northern Europe was the goahti (also known as a &quot;gamme&quot; or &quot;kota&quot;). In terms of construction, purpose and longevity, it represents a close equivalent to a North American native &quot;wigwam&quot;. Most goahti dwellings consisted of portable wooden poles, covered on the outside with either timber or peat moss, in lieu of walls. This differentiated them from the other type of Sámi dwelling, the more temporary and tent-like lavvu, covered with skins or fabrics and somewhat similar to tipis. Some goahti houses were occasionally covered with skins or fabric as well, but were generally larger than &quot;lavvu&quot;, and goahti were always used as more permanent housing.

Many native peoples of Northern Asia also built or build traditional semi-permanent dwellings known as chum. Though some of these Siberian native dwellings are more tent-like, reminiscent of Plains Indians&#x27; tipis or of the Sámi &quot;lavvu&quot;, other forms of chum are more permanent in nature. The more permanent forms of chum are very similar in construction to the timber or peat moss covered goahti dwellings of the Sámi, or the wigwams of the Native American cultures of the Eastern Woodlands and northern parts of North America.

In Britain, similar structures known as bender tents, are built quickly and cheaply by New Age travellers, using poles from the woods (often hazel) and plastic tarpaulins, and are based on the designs of &quot;Benders&quot; by the Romanies who arrived in Britain in the 15th Century.

Yarangas have a similar shape, but can have internal rooms inside the dome.

<text>Archibald Henderson (January 21, 1783 – January 6, 1859) was the longest-serving Commandant of the Marine Corps, serving from 1820 to 1859. His name is learned by all recruits at Marine recruit training (Boot Camp) as the &quot;Grand old man of the Marine Corps,&quot; serving in the United States Marine Corps for over 52 years.

==Early life==
Born in Colchester, Fairfax County, Virginia, Henderson was one of six sons of successful merchant Alexander Henderson and Sarah (Sally) Moore. He was raised at the Henderson House in Dumfries, Virginia until he joined the Marine Corps at the age of 18.

==Career==

Archibald Henderson was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on 4 June 1806 and served aboard USS &quot;Constitution&quot; during her famous victories in the War of 1812. He participated in several shipboard engagements and was decorated for bravery. He was brevetted a major in 1814.

From 16 September 1818 to 2 March 1819, Henderson was the acting Commandant. On 17 October 1820, at age 37, Lt. Colonel Henderson was appointed the Commandant of the Marine Corps. He served for a little over 38 years, the longest of any officer to hold that position.

Henderson is credited with thwarting attempts by President Andrew Jackson to combine the Marine Corps with the Army in 1829. Instead, Congress passed the &quot;Act for the Better Organization of the Marine Corps&quot; in 1834, ensuring the Marines would remain part of the United States Department of the Navy. He was promoted to colonel the same year.

He went into the field as Commandant during the Indian campaigns in Florida and Georgia during 1836 and 1837, and was promoted brevet brigadier general in 1843 for his actions in these campaigns. Tradition says that he pinned a note to his door: &quot;Gone to Florida to fight the Indians. Will be back when the war is over.&quot;

Marines also served in the Mexican–American War during Henderson&#x27;s tenure as Commandant. The sword presented to him at the war&#x27;s end was inscribed, &quot;From the Halls of Montezuma, to the Shores of Tripoli&quot;, giving the opening words to the Marines&#x27; Hymn.

Archibald Henderson died suddenly on 6 January 1859. He was buried in the Congressional Cemetery. According to Marine lore, the Colonel Commandant had attempted to will his home—actually government-provided quarters in which he had lived for 38 years—to his heirs, having forgotten that they were government owned.

==Legacy==
USS &quot;Henderson&quot; (AP-1), and Henderson Hall Barracks were named for him.

<text>Richard Alan Dreissigacker (born March 26, 1947, in New Haven, Connecticut) is a former American Olympic rower and a founder of Concept2, a manufacturer of rowing equipment. While studying engineering at Brown University he took up rowing and went on to represent the United States at the 1972 Summer Olympics.

Dreissigacker earned a Master of Science degree in 1974 from Stanford University, where he coached rowing and introduced his brother Pete to the sport. While training for the 1976 US Olympic team the brothers modified their oars with carbon fibre. After failing to be selected they started selling oars and started the company that is now Concept2.

His wife Julia &quot;Judy&quot; Geer was a rower in the 1976 and 1984 Olympics, and his sister-in-law Charlotte &quot;Carlie&quot; Geer won a silver medal in single sculls in the 1984 Olympics. His daughters, Hannah Dreissigacker and Emily Dreissigacker, competed as biathletes in the 2014 and 2018 Winter Olympics respectively.

<doc id="1341079" wikidata="Q5534124" url="?curid=1341079" title="Geoff Edwards">
<text>Geoffrey Bruce Owen Edwards (February 13, 1931 – March 5, 2014) was an American television actor, game show host, and radio personality. Starting in the early 2000s, he was also a writer and broadcaster on the subject of travel.

==Background==
Prior to his media career, Edwards was an accomplished musician, playing drums in a number of jazz bands. 

Edwards began his career while attending Duke University, working for a radio station in Albany, New York. In 1959, Edwards got his first job at KFMB-AM in San Diego, hosting an evening show and co-hosting the &quot;Don Ross/Geoff Edwards Show&quot;.

As a news reporter for KHJ-AM radio, Edwards was present in the basement of Dallas police headquarters when Jack Ruby shot suspected John F. Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald on November 24, 1963. Edwards was one of the witnesses interviewed by NBC television correspondent Tom Pettit on the scene.

In its 11th annual radio selections for the Best of 1967 column, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; selected Edwards for its &quot;Personality of the Year&quot; for Edwards&#x27; on air work at KFI.

After a few short stints at other stations, Edwards was hired at KMPC in Los Angeles, occupying the 9 a.m.-noon slot for several years beginning in February 1968 until December 1979 when he resigned to focus on his TV career. He later worked at KFI from 1987 to 1989 but he ultimately resigned, as a protest against fellow KFI personality Tom Leykis, destroying Cat Stevens&#x27; (Yusuf Islam) records following Stevens&#x27; call for a fatwa on Salman Rushdie. Most recently, Edwards was a morning DJ with KSUR (now KKGO) in Los Angeles. One of the features of his radio show was &quot;Radio&#x27;s Answer Lady,&quot; in which listeners could call in with questions — some serious, some not so serious — and he would answer on the air, sometimes with serious answers, sometimes with quips.

During that time, Edwards tried his hand at acting, appearing on &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; and &quot;That Girl&quot;.

In 1968, he was seen in several episodes of &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, as Bobbie Jo Bradley&#x27;s boyfriend Jeff. From his time on the show, he met — and maintained a very close friendship with — Meredith MacRae, (who played Billie Jo Bradley).

In 1969, he narrated an educational film, &quot;How We Feel About Sound&quot;.

He also guest starred on &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, and &quot;Small Wonder&quot;.

In the early 1970s, Edwards appeared on &quot;The Bobby Darin Show&quot; as the straight man to singer Bobby Darin. After that series ended, Edwards pursued a game show career, starting with &quot;Says Who?&quot; in 1971, followed by &quot;Cop-Out!&quot; in February 1972—however, both shows eventually turned out to be unsold pilots.

==Game shows==
Edwards&#x27;s first full-time game show hosting stint took place from March through June 1973 on Jack Barry&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Talking&quot;, a remake of a late 1960s ABC game &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talking&quot; and the Canadian hit &quot;Eye Bet&quot;. The program featured contestants watching video clips of celebrities talking about a subject; their job was to guess the subject in question. The series, which aired afternoons on CBS television, did not fare well and the network cancelled it in favor of the phenomenally popular &quot;Match Game&quot; remake. Edwards also said he did not like Barry and he had no intention of continuing with the series if it made it past CBS&#x27; initial commitment.

Edwards was not unemployed long, as Chuck Barris hired him to host &quot;The New Treasure Hunt&quot; that launched in weekly syndication in fall 1973. In January 1974, Edwards returned to daytime with the NBC show &quot;Jackpot&quot;. For the next nineteen months, ending in September 1975, Edwards would commute back and forth between California and New York as &quot;Jackpot&quot; taped at NBC&#x27;s Rockefeller Center studios. He would briefly do this again in 1977 during the run of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Shoot for the Stars&quot; (both it and &quot;Jackpot&quot; were produced by Bob Stewart). &quot;The New Treasure Hunt&quot; would also come to an end in 1977.

In January 1980, Edwards debuted as the host of the new Barry &amp; Enright show &quot;Play the Percentages&quot;, which he hosted until the end of the television season when it was cancelled. He also hosted his last daytime network show when he substituted for Bill Cullen (then filling in on &quot;Password Plus&quot; for an ill Allen Ludden) on two weeks of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, another Bob Stewart show. Edwards also briefly tried his hand at producing when he teamed with Mark Maxwell-Smith to form Smith-Edwards Productions in 1980. The duo signed a deal with Warner Brothers to produce the game show pilot &quot;Pot of Gold&quot; for NBC, but the series never sold. They also worked on a talk show based on the magazine Ladies Home Journal, but that series also failed to sell and Smith-Edwards Productions folded in 1981. Later that year, Edwards returned to television to host a daily revival of &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; for syndication that was cancelled at the end of the 1981–82 season.

In 1983 Edwards began hosting &quot;Starcade&quot;, a new show centered on video games. He took over the show from previous host Mark Richards, who hosted from December 1982 until the summer of 1983. The show initially aired on Superstation WTBS and went into national syndication from September 1983 to September 1984. Richards was fired for the reasoning that he did not know much nor was he very enthusiastic about video games; determined not to repeat what his predecessor did, Edwards studied the video games utilized on the show and the industry in general and consequently became so fascinated with video games that he became an avid player. Edwards kept up the hobby until his death.

Except for a week of substituting for an indisposed Monty Hall on &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; in early 1985 and an unsold Bob Stewart pilot for ABC called &quot;$50,000 a Minute&quot;, Edwards remained largely inactive on the national television scene. This changed with his next two hosting gigs, which were his longest. In November 1985, Edwards replaced Chuck Woolery as the host of the California Lottery&#x27;s weekly game show &quot;The Big Spin&quot;, which he would host for ten years, mostly from the lottery&#x27;s Sacramento headquarters. Then, in 1986, Edwards was called on by Stewart yet again, this time to replace Blake Emmons as host of its Montreal-based revival of &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; (which aired in the US on the USA Network). He would do this until the series was cancelled in 1991 and would commute between the United States and Canada during this time. During this time, Edwards would also take the job as host of a revival of &quot;Jackpot&quot; for syndication in 1989.

Edwards was also one of four game show hosts to have emceed a game show in the United States and another in Canada concurrently (the other three were Howie Mandel, Alex Trebek, and Jim Perry). Edwards, like Perry, commuted back and forth between the United States and Canada between 1986 and 1991, hosting &quot;The Big Spin&quot; and the 1989 revival of &quot;Jackpot!&quot; in Sacramento and Glendale, respectively, and the USA Network version of &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; in Montreal, Quebec. However, Edwards was required to have a Canadian co-host on &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, due to the fact that he had no ties to the country, unlike Trebek, Mandel and Perry (Mandel is a native Canadian, as was Trebek; Perry had blood ties to Canada and lived in Toronto, Ontario during the first several years of &quot;Definition&quot;). His commuting days ended after &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; left the air in 1991. (&quot;Chain Reaction&quot;&#x27;s next incarnation would be in 2006 on GSN with Dylan Lane hosting.)

Edwards was famous for his catch phrase — &quot;Right you are!&quot; — which he frequently exclaimed after a correct answer.

==Other television work==
Edwards was also co-host of the Los Angeles news program &quot;Mid Morning L.A.&quot; on KHJ-TV (now KCAL-TV), replacing Bob Hilton in the early 1980s and paired with co-host Meredith MacRae. Edwards and MacRae won Emmy Awards for best host and best hostess respectively for a news magazine series. The two also emceed an unsold Bob Stewart-produced game show pilot, &quot;$50,000 a Minute&quot;, in 1985 for ABC.

In 1985, Edwards became host of &quot;The Big Spin&quot;, the game show of the California Lottery, and would remain host of that program until his retirement from television in 1995. In an interview with Blog Talk Radio, Edwards said he helmed the pilot of &quot;Fun &amp; Fortune&quot;, the lottery game show in Missouri (before Rick Tamblyn became the permanent host). In another interview, he said he was offered the host role for &quot;Family Feud&quot; but had to turn it down because he was already committed to &quot;Shoot for the Stars&quot;.

In 1995, Edwards appeared on &quot;Sliders&quot;, in the episode &quot;Luck of the Draw&quot;.

==Family==
Edwards and his first wife, Suzanne, co-hosted a talk show, &quot;The His and Her of It&quot;. The program was broadcast on television stations owned and operated by ABC. In 1970, the couple also served as honorary co-chairmen of the organization California Association of Parents of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children.

==Later years==

In his later years, Edwards traveled extensively, hosting traveling programs on both radio and television, and writing about travel. His travel book &quot;Going All The Way&quot; humorously chronicles his around-the-world cruise adventures. He appeared as a guest on &quot;GSN Live&quot; on May 16, 2008.

During his tenure on &quot;Starcade&quot;, as a result of his extensive studying about video games to avoid what his predecessor did, he became a video game fan; he would often give his own hints to help contestants on the show when they selected a particular game to play, and one &quot;Starcade Hotline&quot; segment showed him beating the notoriously-difficult arcade game &quot;Sinistar&quot; (he and other crew members would often play the arcade games between tapings).

==Death==
Edwards died of complications from pneumonia at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California, on March 5, 2014, less than a month after his 83rd birthday.

<text>Michael Lee-Chin (born 3 January 1951) is a Jamaican-Canadian billionaire businessman, philanthropist and the chairman and CEO of Portland Holdings Inc, a privately held investment company in Ontario, Canada.

Lee-Chin was appointed to the Order of Ontario in 2017.

In 2016, Lee-Chin was appointed chairman of the government of Jamaica&#x27;s Economic Growth Council (EGC).

Lee-Chin has made several large pledges and/or donations in Canada to the Royal Ontario Museum in 2003, the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, McMaster University and the Joseph Brant Hospital Foundation. Lee-Chin served as chancellor of Wilfrid Laurier University.

==Background==
Lee-Chin was born in Port Antonio, Jamaica, in 1951 to Aston Lee and Hyacinth Gloria Chen. Both his parents were biracial African and Jamaican-Chinese. When Lee-Chin was aged seven, his mother married Vincent Chen who had a son from a previous relationship, and the couple had seven children together, six boys and one girl. Lee-Chin&#x27;s mother sold Avon products and worked as a bookkeeper for various local firms, while his stepfather ran a local grocery store.

He attended the local high school, Titchfield High, between 1962 and 1969.

==Career==
In 1965, Lee-Chin&#x27;s first job came working as part of the landscaping team at the Frenchman&#x27;s Cove Hotel. The next year, he got a summer job working on the &quot;Jamaica Queen&quot; cruise ship, cleaning the engine room.

In 1970, he went to Canada on a scholarship program sponsored by the Jamaican government to study Civil Engineering at McMaster University, and graduated in 1974.
He financed his first year at university on his own but after that was able to attend on scholarship.

After graduating from McMaster, Lee-Chin worked briefly as a road engineer for the Jamaican government,
but unable to find work in his qualified field (and allegedly, because his Canadian wife did not like living in Jamaica), he returned to Canada where he began graduate studies in business. At first he worked as a bouncer, but later found employment as a financial advisor for Investors Group.

Lee-Chin spent two years at the Investors Group, in the Hamilton, Ontario office and in 1979, moved to Regal Capital Planners and became regional manager. While at the company, in 1983, he secured a loan from the Continental Bank of Canada for C$800,000 to purchase a stake in Mackenzie Financial Group and formed Kicks Athletics with Andrew Gayle. By 1987, the investment was worth C$3.5 million.

In 1987, Lee-Chin took the proceeds from his Mackenzie investment to buy a Kitchener-based company called the Advantage Investment Council (a division of AIC Limited) for $200,000. At the time, the company had holdings of around C$800,000. He renamed the company AIC, and developed it to a fund that controlled around C$6 billion, with hundreds of thousands of investors. Following the acquisition of AIC Limited, Lee-Chin set up the Berkshire group of companies, comprising an investment planning arm, a securities dealership and an insurance operation. By 2007, Berkshire had amassed more than C$12 billion of assets under administration. In 2007, Manulife acquired Berkshire from Portland Holdings in exchange for shares, making Portland one of the largest shareholders of Manulife.

In 2009, Lee-Chin sold AIC Limited to Manulife for an undisclosed amount. The following year, Manulife rebranded the heritage AIC funds and eliminated the AIC name from the mutual fund line-up.

In addition to being the founder and Chairman of Portland Holdings Inc., Mr. Lee-Chin is chairman and director of Mandeville Holdings Inc. and Executive Chairman, CEO, and Portfolio Manager of Portland Investment Counsel Inc.

===Investments 1990–2005===
In the late 1980s, AIC suffered from a collapse in the real estate market, in which it had invested. It recovered throughout the early 1990s by maintaining investments in large groups, such as Merrill Lynch and TD bank (formerly Toronto Dominion). This caused investments to grow from US$8 million in 1990 to nearly US$8 billion by 1998.

Lee-Chin was reluctant to invest in the dotcom boom, and saw AIC investments lose 8 per cent in value, even as the S&amp;P gained 56 per cent. Investors moved US$224 million out of AIC&#x27;s flagship &quot;Advantage Mutual Fund&quot;. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; ran an article predicting that even more investors would leave the fund, meaning that it would run out of cash and be forced to sell its core holdings. Lee-Chin&#x27;s response was to sell stock in Coca-Cola, and invest US$65 million into Mackenzie Holdings (the same firm in which he had invested US$400,000 16 years previously). Letters were sent to all 350,000 investors, explaining the strategy. The investors were calmed by the purchase, and the stock was later sold to Investor Group (the same company Lee-Chin had worked for in the 1980s) at more than twice the price AIC had paid for it. In 2000 and 2001, following the dotcom crash, AIC outperformed the market with 26 per cent growth and 4 per cent decline respectively.

In November 2003, AIC was part of a regulatory investigation involving 105 Canadian mutual funds companies. In its review of AIC, investigators found no evidence of late trading and market timing activity by AIC staff. However, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) did find that over the 1999–2003 period, AIC permitted specific third party investors to engage in market timing trades in AIC Funds that generated profits of $127 million. In the Settlement Agreement between AIC and the OSC, the OSC stated that &quot;Accordingly, the conduct of AIC in failing to protect fully the best interests of the Relevant Funds in respect of the frequent trading market timing was contrary to the public interest.&quot; As a result, in December 2004, AIC Limited was forced to return CAD $58.8 million to affected investors, which was the largest penalty imposed on any of the fund companies in the OSC investigation.

On 5 October 2006, Lee-Chin announced his resignation as CEO of AIC, to be replaced by Jonathan Wellum, AIC&#x27;s chief investment officer.

In 2005, two investment product managers offering structured products joined the Portland Holdings portfolio, Copernican Capital Corporation has offered retail investment products, primarily sold by brokers, and has raised more than C$800 million, in 10 closed end funds since its launch. Markland Street Asset Management, which launched the Oil Sands Sector Fund, raised C$430 million in one of Canada&#x27;s largest closed-end IPOs.

== Personal life ==
In 1974, he married Vera Lee-Chin, a Ukrainian Canadian whom he had met at university. They separated in 1997 and are now divorced. Vera Lee-Chin had contested the terms of the separation agreement, claiming that Lee-Chin did not disclose his actual wealth at the time of the separation. The couple had three children, Michael Jr., Paul, and Adrian.

Lee-Chin now lives with his wife Sonya Lee-Chin, with whom he has fraternal-twin daughters, Elizabeth and Maria, in Burlington, Ontario.

=== Wealth ===
Forbes first added Lee-Chin to its billionaires list in 2010. Since, his estimated net worth has fluctuated between $1 billion and $2 billion, with it pegged at $1.4 billion as of June 2023.

Lee-Chin is well-known in Ontario, Canada as a prolific car collector, specifically of Ferraris. His collection includes a LaFerrari, Ferrari 599 GTO, Ferrari F12tdf, and Ferrari Enzo.

In 2021, Lee-Chin took delivery of a 115.10m (377.6ft) Lürssen superyacht named &quot;Ahpo&quot;, worth an estimated US$354 million (CA$474 million). During its construction, &quot;Ahpo&quot; was known as Project Enzo, paying tribute to Lee-Chin&#x27;s love of Ferraris. In 2023, after just over one year of ownership, Lee-Chin sold &quot;Ahpo&quot; to fellow Canadian billionaire Patrick Dovigi, who subsequently renamed the yacht to &quot;Lady Jorgia.&quot;

==Philanthropy==
In 2003, he made headlines when he pledged to donate $30 million to the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) of which a third had been paid as of 2015. He also provided a $10 million gift to the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. The gift established the Michael Lee-Chin Family Institute for Corporate Citizenship at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. The Lee-Chin Institute&#x27;s purpose is to help current and future business leaders integrate corporate citizenship into business strategy and practices.

In September 2014, Lee-Chin and his family donated $10 million to the Joseph Brant Hospital Foundation.

Michael Lee-Chin and family received the 2015 Association of Fundraising Professionals&#x27; (Golden Horseshoe Chapter) National Philanthropy Award in the category of Outstanding Philanthropist.

==Current fund growth and difficulties==
===Investment in Caribbean===
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Jamaica went through a period of financial crisis.
Lee-Chin saw potential in his native country, and Portland purchased 75 per cent of the National Commercial Bank of Jamaica for 6 billion Jamaican dollars (US$127 million) from the Jamaican Government. In 2003, Senvia Money Services Inc., a global money transfer company, was established. This was followed in 2004, by the acquisition of AIC Financial Group Limited, headquartered in Trinidad.

In 2004, he announced plans to set up the AIC Caribbean Fund with the intention of investing in the entire Caribbean region. The stated aim of the fund is to raise US$1 billion in order to &quot;make investments in businesses located in countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), with an emphasis on Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago&quot;. So far, it has made a number of large-scale investments.

In 2006, Portland acquired an 85 per cent controlling stake in the United General Insurance Company, the largest auto insurer in Jamaica, and renamed the firm Advantage General Insurance Company. A controlling interest in CVM Communications Group (consisting of radio and television stations and newspapers) was purchased at the same time. Portland partnered with the Canadian Risley Group to form Columbus Communications Ltd – a Barbadian corporation that holds controlling interest in a number of telecommunications providers in the Caribbean including Cable Bahamas Ltd, Caribbean Crossings Ltd, Merit Communications Ltd, and FibralLink Jamaica Ltd.

In the tourism sector, Lee-Chin guided Portland through a number of acquisitions in the Caribbean. Among them were the hospitality operations of the Trident Villas and Spa in Jamaica, Reggae Beach, and Blue Lagoon.

Portland&#x27;s first acquisition in the health care industry sector was announced in July 2006, when Medical Associates Ltd., a privately held hospital in Kingston, Jamaica, joined the Portland Group.

===Commodities boom===
Similar to the experience of the late 1990s, Lee-Chin again has shied away from investing in commodities and the energy market boom. He has specifically stated that &quot;We [AIC] do not like commodities-type businesses nor most high-tech companies simply because they are implicitly poor enterprises which we would not want to hold for the long term&quot;.

Again, this strategy has meant that AIC has significantly underperformed the S&amp;P index, but Lee-Chin stated in 2006 that he believed that the current boom is just another bubble. Lee-Chin describes the market since 1990 as &quot;a series of rolling speculations&quot;, and now &quot;we see a commodities bubble&quot;.

==Business strategy==
While at Investors Group, he studied the strategies of successful investors, such as Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham and Kenneth Thomson. Their buy and hold strategy is easily recognizable in the motto of AIC – &quot;Buy, hold and prosper&quot;. He also invested in public investment management businesses which benefit from a rising market in two ways. In a rising market stock in portfolios go up and more people become investors and increase existing investment.

<text>Swades: We, the People () is a 2004 Indian Hindi-language drama film co-written, directed and produced by Ashutosh Gowariker. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan, Gayatri Joshi and Kishori Ballal while Daya Shankar Pandey, Rajesh Vivek, Lekh Tandon appear in supporting roles.

The plot was based on two episodes of the series &quot;Vaapsi&quot; on Zee TV&#x27;s &quot;Yule Love Stories&quot; (1994–95) which had Gowariker playing the role of &quot;Mohan Bhargav&quot;. The story of the lead role setting up a micro hydroelectric project to generate electricity was reported to be inspired by the 2003 Kannada film &quot;Chigurida Kanasu&quot; which was based on the novel of the same name by Jnanapith awardee K. Shivaram Karanth and &quot;Bapu Kuti&quot; by Rajni Bakshi. Story writer MG Sathya had revealed that he was swayed over by the Gandhian principles and the socio - political environment during his formative years while studying in Kannada medium school in Jalahalli, Bengaluru.

The music and background score was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics penned by Javed Akhtar. 

&quot;Swades&quot; was theatrically released on 17 December 2004, and it opened to rave reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of Khan, Joshi and Ballal, and the story, screenplay, and soundtrack. However, it emerged as a commercial failure at the box office.

At the 50th Filmfare Awards, &quot;Swades&quot; received 8 nominations, including Best Film, Best Director (Gowarikar) and Best Music Director (Rahman), and won Best Actor (Khan) and Best Background Score (Rahman).

It was dubbed in Tamil as &quot;Desam&quot; and released on 26 January 2005, coinciding with Indian Republic Day. Despite its commercial failure, &quot;Swades&quot; is regarded ahead of its time and is now considered a cult classic of Hindi cinema and one of the best films in Shah Rukh Khan&#x27;s filmography. The film is owned by Red Chillies Entertainment.

==Plot==
Mohan Bhargava is a non-resident Indian who works as a Project Manager on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) program at NASA in Washington, D.C. Mohan moved to the U.S. for college studies and kept on living there after his parents in India died in a car accident. He keeps worrying about Kaveri Amma, a nanny at his home in Uttar Pradesh who looked after him during his childhood days. After his parents&#x27; death, Kaveri Amma went to live in an old age home in Delhi and eventually lost contact with Mohan. Mohan wishes to go to India and bring Kaveri Amma back with him to the U. S. Due to the recent success of Phase I of his project, he takes a few weeks off and travels to India. He goes to the old age home but learns that Kaveri Amma no longer lives there and went to a village named Charanpur a year ago. Mohan then decides to travel to Charanpur, in Uttar Pradesh.

Mohan decides to rent a recreational vehicle to reach the village fearing that he might not get the required facilities there. Upon reaching Charanpur, he meets Kaveri Amma and learns how his childhood friend Geeta (whom he called &quot;Gitli&quot; in his childhood) brought Kaveri Amma to stay with her after Mohan&#x27;s parents died. Geeta runs a school in Charanpur and works hard to improve the living conditions of the villagers through education. However, the village is divided largely by caste and religious beliefs. Geeta does not like Mohan&#x27;s arrival as she thinks that he will take Kaveri Amma back with him to the U. S., leaving her and her younger brother Nandan &quot;Chiku&quot; alone. Kaveri Amma tells Mohan that she needs to get Geeta married first and that it is her responsibility. Geeta believes in women empowerment and gender equality. This attracts Mohan towards Geeta and he too tries to help her by campaigning for education among backward communities and also girls. Mohan befriends villagers Nivaaran and Melaram, and they support him in his campaign. Mohan also wins the attention of Dadaji, a kind village chief.

Slowly love blossoms between Mohan and Geeta. Kaveri Amma asks Mohan to visit a nearby village named Kodi, and collect money from a man named Haridas who owes it to Geeta. Mohan visits Kodi and feels pity seeing Haridas&#x27; poor condition, which is such that he is unable to provide his family with meals every day. Haridas tells Mohan that since his caste profession of a weaver wasn&#x27;t earning him any money, he shifted to tenant farming. But this change in profession led to his ostracization from the village and the villagers even denied him water for his crops. Mohan understands the pathetic situation and realises that many villages in India are still like Kodi. He returns to Charanpur with a heavy heart and decides to do something for the welfare of the village.

Mohan extends his leave by three more weeks. He learns that electricity inconsistency and frequent power cuts are a big problem in Charanpur. He decides to set up a small hydroelectric power generation facility from a nearby water source. Mohan purchases all the equipment needed from his own funds and oversees the building of the power generation unit. The unit works and the village gets sufficient, consistent power from it.

Dadaji&#x27;s health deteriorates and he passes away. Mohan is repeatedly called by NASA officials as the GPM project he was working on is reaching important stages and he has to return to the U. S. soon. Kaveri Amma tells him that she prefers to stay in Charanpur as it will be difficult for her to adapt to a new country at her age. Geeta also tells him that she will not settle down in another country and she would prefer it if Mohan stay in India with her and Kaveri Amma. Mohan returns to the U. S. with a heavy heart to complete the project. However, in the U. S., he has flashbacks of his time in India and wishes to return. After the successful completion of his project, he leaves U. S. and returns to India with intentions of working at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center, from where he can also work with NASA. The film ends by showing Mohan staying in the village and wrestling with his friend Nivaaran near a temple.

==Production==

===Inspiration===
&quot;Swades&quot; is inspired by the story of Aravinda Pillalamarri and Ravi Kuchimanchi, the non-resident Indian couple who returned to India and developed a pedal power generator to light remote, off-the-grid village schools. Gowariker spent considerable time with Pillalamarri and Kuchimanchi, both dedicated Association for India&#x27;s Development (AID) volunteers. He supposedly visited Bilgaon, an Adivasi village in the Narmada valley, which is the backdrop of the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) movement. The people of Bilgaon are credited with doing 200 person-days of &quot;shramdaan&quot; (community service) to make their village energy self-sufficient. The Bilgaon project is recognised as a model for replication by the Government of Maharashtra.

The film was reported to be inspired by two episodes of the series titled &quot;Vaapsi&quot; on Zee TV&#x27;s &quot;Yule Love Stories&quot; (1993–95). The story of the lead role setting up a micro hydro electric project to generate electricity was reported to be inspired by the Kannada novel &quot;Chigurida Kanasu&quot; by K. Shivaram Karanth and &quot;Bapu Kuti&quot; by Rajni Bakshi.

===Themes===
Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s great-grandson, Tushar Gandhi, noted the theme of Gandhism in the film. The name of the main character portrayed by Shah Rukh Khan is Mohan, which was Gandhi&#x27;s birth name (Mohandas or &quot;Mohan&quot;). The film opens with the quotation:

Gowariker tries to address the lack of scientific temperament and widespread ignorance among the rural folks through the energetic number &quot;Ye Tara Wo Tara&quot;, where Mohan is seen encouraging the children to experience the fascinating world of stars through his telescope. In a symbolic manner, the song rejects the defunct divisions of caste and class and at the same time, through its protagonist, tries to instill in the audience an appreciation of curiosity and observation.

===Casting and filming===

Gowariker initially offered Mohan&#x27;s role to Aamir Khan (who worked in Gowariker&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Lagaan&quot;), but he rejected it because he found the story to be weak. Mohan&#x27;s role was then offered to Hrithik Roshan, who refused after reading the script. Gowariker contemplated casting R. Madhavan before offering Mohan&#x27;s role to Shah Rukh, who finally accepted it after listening to the story and he started crying during the story&#x27;s narration. Bhanu Athaiya, an Oscar winner for &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), was the costume designer for the film.

&quot;Swades&quot; was the first Indian film to be shot inside the NASA headquarters and inside the NASA research center at the Launch Pad 39A of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The rainfall monitoring satellite known as the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) in the film is an actual NASA mission and was launched in 2014.
A major part of the film was shot in Menawali, Maharashtra.

==Soundtrack==
The song &quot;Dekho Naa&quot; is a modified version of the song &quot;Kichchu Tha&quot; from the film, &quot;Baba&quot; (2002).


On 27 March 2021, members of United States Navy Band sang &quot;Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera&quot; for Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the Ambassador of India to the United States and United States Navy Chief of Naval Operations at a special dinner event. The video of the band members singing surfaced on Twitter and received praise and nostalgia from Shahrukh Khan, A. R. Rahman and netizens alike.

===Tamil version===
The Tamil soundtrack under the title &quot;Desam&quot; was composed by A.R. Rahman. All Lyrics were written by Vaali. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 13,00,000 units sold, this film&#x27;s soundtrack album was the eleventh highest-selling of the year.
==Reception==

===Critical reception===
The film received universal critical acclaim and went on to become a cult classic, and Khan&#x27;s performance as Mohan Bhargava is considered one of his best to date.

Subhash K. Jha of &quot;Indiatimes Movies&quot; gave the film 4.5 stars out of 5 and said, &quot;&quot;Swades&quot; is a unique experiment with grassroots realism. It is so politically correct in its propagandist message that initially you wonder if the Government of India funded the director&#x27;s dream.&quot;

Mayank Shekhar from &quot;Mid-Day&quot; gave it 4 stars, stating, &quot;I cannot think of a better film for the longest that deserved a stronger recommendation for both touring cinemas of India&#x27;s villages, and plush multiplexes of Mumbai or Manhattan.&quot;

Jitesh Pillai of the &quot;Sunday Times of India&quot; gave the film 4 stars and said &quot;After &quot;Lagaan&quot;, what? The answer&#x27;s blowing in the wind. &quot;Swades&quot;! Here&#x27;s the verdict: This is a gutsy and outstanding film. Welcome back to real, solid film-making.&quot; He added, &quot;&quot;Swades&quot; is undoubtedly the No. 1 movie of the year.&quot;

Shradha Sukumaran of &quot;Mid-Day&quot; gave it 3.5 stars and said, &quot;At the end of it, &quot;Swades&quot; is a far braver film than &quot;Lagaan&quot;. It could have hit the high note – if it hadn&#x27;t tried so hard.&quot;

Avijit Ghosh wrote in &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, &quot;With its gentle humour, the film acts as an entertaining vehicle for social change. And hopefully, it will do more for positive nationalism than the Union government&#x27;s Directorate of Audio Visual Publicity (DAVP) ads ever will.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Swades&quot; earned net box office in India. In the overseas market, the film made $2,790,000. It had a lifetime worldwide gross of . The film topped the box office in Chennai on its opening weekend.

<doc id="1341093" wikidata="Q359024" url="?curid=1341093" title="Soviet aircraft carrier Baku">
<text>Baku () was a &quot;Kiev&quot;-class aircraft carrier of the Soviet Navy and the Russian Navy from 1987 to 1996. In 1991 the ship was renamed Admiral Flota Sovetskogo Soyuza Gorshkov ( &quot;Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov&quot;) in Russian service.

&quot;Baku&quot; is considered a separate class due to her improvements including a phased array radar, extensive electronic warfare installations, and an enlarged command and control suite. She was launched in 1982, and was in service from 1987 to 1991 in the Soviet Navy as &quot;Baku&quot;, and from 1991 to 1996 in the Russian Navy as &quot;Admiral Gorshkov&quot;.

In 2004, &quot;Gorshkov&quot; was sold to India with extensive conversion and entered service as the new aircraft carrier .

==History==
The ship was laid down in 1978 at Nikolayev South (Shipyard No.444) in Ukraine, launched in 1982, and commissioned in December 1987. The delay in commissioning was largely caused by software bugs in the new command and control system. The ship was renamed &quot;Admiral Gorshkov&quot; after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, as the city of Baku was now in independent Azerbaijan. Sergey Gorshkov was responsible for the expansion of the Soviet Navy during the Cold War.

In 1994, following a boiler room explosion, the ship was docked for a year of repairs. Although she returned to service in 1995, she was finally withdrawn in 1996 and offered for sale.

On 20 January 2004, Russia agreed to sell &quot;Admiral Gorshkov&quot; to India after an extensive upgrade at Sevmash Enterprise. In December 2009, it was reported that India had agreed to pay a price of US$2.3 billion. The carrier, now named INS &quot;Vikramaditya&quot;, was commissioned into the Indian Navy on 16 November 2013.

==Design==
The fourth of the Project 1143 aircraft carrying cruisers, &quot;Baku&quot; had many differences from the rest of the class, trialing technologies to be used on the &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;. The most obvious is the massive passive electronically scanned array above the bridge. This was the phased array antenna for the Mars-Passat (&quot;Sky Watch&quot;) 3D air search radar. Sky Watch proved troublesome and was probably never operational.

The biggest change to the weapon systems was the replacement of the 4K60 (SA-N-3 &#x27;Goblet&#x27;) and 9K33 Osa (SA-N-4 &#x27;Gecko&#x27;) SAM launchers with four SA-N-9 &#x27;Gauntlet&#x27; VLS launchers. This allowed room for another two 4K80 (SS-N-12 &#x27;Sandbox&#x27;) launchers. The two AA guns of the &quot;Kiev&quot;s were replaced with 100 mm guns, and the SUW-N-1 launcher was removed.

The air wing was the same as the other &quot;Kiev&quot;s, consisting of a squadron of twelve Yakovlev Yak-38 (&#x27;Forger&#x27;) V/STOL strike fighter aircraft (until they were retired in 1992), twelve Kamov Ka-27 (&#x27;Helix-A&#x27;) ASW/SAR helicopters and two Ka-31 (&#x27;Helix&#x27;) airborne early warning helicopters. Flight operations were assisted by the distinctive new &quot;Cake Stand&quot; tactical air navigation system.

&quot;Baku&quot; was used for trials of the Yak-141 Freestyle supersonic VTOL fighter.

<text>The Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority (&quot;NELHA&quot;) administers the Hawaii Ocean Science and Technology Park (HOST Park) in the U.S. state of Hawaii. &quot;NELHA&quot; was founded in 1974. At , HOST Park is a state-subsidized industrial park for incubator and marginal commercial ventures. Part of the subsidy is provided by writing off tenant debt.&quot;NELHA&quot; also administers a small site, , in Puna on the eastern side of the Island of Hawaii for geothermal research.

The original mission was for research into the uses of deep ocean water in ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) renewable energy production and in aquaculture. It later added research into sustainable uses of natural energy sources such as solar energy.
Its administration offices are located in the HOST Park Keahole Point in the North Kona District.
The entrance is on the Hawaii Belt Road at coordinates , just south of the Kona International Airport. The main administration office is in the 4 acre research campus at the end of the road along the coastline on Keahole Point.

The laboratory was founded in 1974 with , associated with the University of Hawaii. Large pipelines pump cold sea water from a depth of . For three months in 1979, a small amount of electricity was generated. Almost $250M was spent on Ocean thermal energy conversion, but by 1991, the research shifted to other areas. The adjacent Science and Technology Park was merged into the facility, expanding it to . A neutrino detector was partially constructed in the 1990s called Project DUMAND.

After four decades, NELHA is well on track to fulfilling its mission as an engine for economic development in Hawaii and the economic impact generated by HOST Park is approaching $150M annually with the creation of over 600 jobs statewide. In 2002, were leased to a commercial company which filters and bottles the water for sale in Japan.
