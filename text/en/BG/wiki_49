<text>A hula hoop is a toy hoop that is twirled around the waist, limbs or neck. It can also be wheeled along the ground like a wheel with careful execution and practice. They have been used by children and adults since at least 500 BC. The modern hula hoop was inspired by Australian bamboo hoops. Common lore posits the creators of the plastic hoop witnessed Australian children playing with bamboo hoops while driving past in an automobile. The new plastic version was popularized in 1958 by the Wham-O toy company and became a fad.

Hula hoops for children generally measure approximately in diameter, while those for adults measure around . Traditional materials for hula hoops include willow, rattan (a flexible and strong vine), grapevines and stiff grasses. Commercial hoops are usually made of plastic tubing.

==Origins==
Native American Hoop Dance is a form of storytelling dance incorporating hoops as props. These props are used to create both static and dynamic shapes, which represent various animals, symbols, and storytelling elements. The dance is generally performed by a solo dancer with multiple hoops.

Before it was known and recognized as the common colorful plastic toy (sometimes filled with water or sand), the traditional &quot;hula hoop&quot; was made of dried willow, rattan, grapevines, or stiff grasses. Though they have been in existence for thousands of years, it is often incorrectly believed that they were invented in the 1950s.

Author Charles Panati records a &quot;craze&quot; with the usage of wooden and metal hoops in 14th-century England. He reports that doctors treated patients with pain, dislocated backs, and even heart failure due to hooping. Panati also says that the name &quot;hula&quot; came from the Hawaiian dance in the 18th century, due to the similar hip movements.

==Modern history==

The hula hoop gained international popularity in the late 1950s, when a plastic version was successfully marketed by California&#x27;s Wham-O toy company. Cane hoops had been popular children&#x27;s toys to be rolled on the ground and kept balanced for as long as possible. In 1957, children in the Norwegian town of Steinkjer began a fad described in the English press as &quot;rock-rings&quot;, with the description being &quot;These are huge cane rings which little girls swing round their bodies by moving their hips and arms.&quot; An August 7 news item described the origin as children buying cane rings after seeing ring jugglers at a circus that visited Steinkjer and added, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t long before most of the children in town had caught the &#x27;wiggle-rock&#x27; craze, now it is all over Norway.&quot; In the same summer, schoolgirls in Australia were using the hoops and news came to the United States with the first reference to the toy as a &quot;Hula hoop&quot;, described as &quot;all the rage among the female small fry of Australia. This is old fashioned hoops with a difference. You don&#x27;t roll them; you put them around your middle and by swinging the hips in a circular motion, you keep the hoop revolving— hence the name.&quot;

According to &quot;The Playmakers: Amazing Origins of Timeless Toys&quot; by Tim Walsh, the bamboo hoop&#x27;s path to plastic started in Australia when a Sydney teacher taught school students how to sway bamboo hoops in sports classes. Australia&#x27;s Coles department stores then started selling bamboo hoops and demand soon outstripped supply. Coles then asked legendary toy man Alex Tolmer (also known as Alec), who founded toy company Toltoys, to help mass produce hoops. In 1957, Tolmer used Polyethylene which was stronger and less brittle than earlier plastics. The new lightweight plastic hoops sold in a variety of colors for less than $2. Toltoys sold 400,000 plastic hoops in Australia in 1957 alone. According to Tolmer&#x27;s Melbourne-based son (David Tolmer) Toltoys already had a good working relationship with Wham-O in the United States. When Wham-O told Toltoys the hoop was too generic to warrant a royalty, Alex Tolmer instead asked the US company to sponsor one bed in an Australian children&#x27;s hospital. By 1958, Wham-O plastic hoops were being used in California and then the craze for hooping swept the United States and beyond.

Richard Knerr and Arthur &quot;Spud&quot; Melin of Wham-O updated the Toltoys design and manufactured diameter hoops from Marlex plastic. The earliest known advertisement was seen for the &quot;Hula-Hoop by Wham-O&quot; was seen on June 16, 1958 for &quot;The Broadway&quot; chain of department stores in Los Angeles, for sale for $1.98 (equivalent to $20 more than 60 years later). With giveaways, national marketing and retailing, a fad began in July 1958: twenty-five million plastic hoops were sold in less than four months, and sales reached more than 100 million units in two years. Carlon Products Corporation was one of the first manufacturers of the hula hoop. During the 1950s, Carlon was producing more than 50,000 hula hoops per day. Saddled with a glut of unwanted Hula Hoops, Wham-O stopped manufacturing the toy until 1965, when Knerr and Melin came up with a new twist: They inserted ball bearings in the cylinder to make a &quot;shoosh&quot; sound. The hoop was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester, New York, in 1999.

The hula hoop craze swept the world, dying out in the 1980s except in China and Russia, where hula hooping and hoop manipulation were adopted by traditional circuses and rhythmic gymnasts. In the mid to late 1990s there was a re-emergence of hula hooping, generally referred to as either &quot;hoopdance&quot; or simply &quot;hooping&quot; to distinguish it from the children&#x27;s playform. The jam band The String Cheese Incident is widely credited with fostering a renewed interest in hooping. Band members started throwing larger adult-sized hoops into their audiences in the mid-1990s, encouraging their fans to hoop and dance, spreading the word and the fun. It wasn&#x27;t until 2003 with the launch of a former website, Hooping.org, that these small bands of hoopers began to find each other online and a real community and movement began to grow. Bay Area Hoopers began in San Francisco at that time holding regular &quot;hoop jams&quot; with music to hoop to and the hooping group began being replicated in cities around the world. In 2006 Hoopin&#x27; Annie had the idea to create a hooping holiday and the first World Hoop Day was held in 2007. Modern hula hooping is seen at numerous festivals and fairs in the USA, UK, Australia and Europe.

===Hooping as an activity===
Many modern hoopers make their own hoops out of PVC piping, or polypropylene tubing (known as polypro). The polyethylene hoops, and especially the polyvinyl chloride hoops, are much larger and heavier than hoops of the 1950s. The size and the weight of the hoop affect the style of the hooper. Heavier, larger hoops are used for beginning dancers and easier tricks, while lighter, thinner tubing is used for quick hand tricks. These hoops may be covered in a fabric or plastic tape to create a visual image and distinguish between the hoop and dancer. Gaffer tape is used to line the inside of a hula hoop to add grip, or a bare hula hoop can be roughened by using sandpaper. Some use glow-in-the dark, patterned, or sparkling tape, and others are produced with clear tubing and are unfilled (child hoops are commonly filled with various materials). LED lighting has been added, allowing hoops to light up at the flick of a switch or a remote control. Programmable &#x27;Smart Hoops&#x27; are available which provide a range of special effects and some can even be customized through an application on a mobile device.

Modern hooping has created a wide range of tricks. Hooping now includes many &#x27;on body&#x27; moves and many &#x27;off body&#x27; moves. A few examples are breaks, isolations, leg hooping, and double hooping.

Hooping is a popular fitness activity, with classes in many cities across the world.

Fire hooping has been introduced, in which spokes are set into the outside of the hoop and tipped with kevlar wicks, which are soaked in fuel and ignited.

Collapsible hula hoops have been developed for easy transport and versatility.

Weighted hula hoops which weigh between 1.5 and 8 pounds are used for exercises and the extra weight usually comes from plastic or padded steel. People use it for weight loss routines and add some easily repetitive routines (and music) to make it fun.

==In popular culture==

* On September 6, 1958, singer Georgia Gibbs appeared on US TV&#x27;s &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; to sing &quot;The Hula Hoop Song&quot;. Her last US top-40 hit, it competed with four other songs created in the wake of the huge fad.
* In &quot;The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don&#x27;t Be Late)&quot;, the debut single by Alvin and the Chipmunks, Alvin repeatedly sings about wanting a hula hoop for Christmas. The song was first released in 1958, when the hula hoop first achieved widespread popularity. Wayout Toys, under license to Emson, introduced the Alvin Hula Hoop Doll, which dances with his hula hoop and sings the song.
* The Coen brothers&#x27; 1994 comedy film &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; tells a fictional story of the hula hoop&#x27;s invention by a mail room clerk (Tim Robbins) who is installed as president of a manufacturing company as part of a stock price manipulation scheme.
*Hula Hoop is featured as an aerobics minigame in the Wii Fit game franchise.
* During the production of Pixar Animation Studios film &quot;WALL-E&quot;, Disney.com released a clip of Wall-E&#x27;s first encounter with a hula hoop, swinging it across its neck.
* Artist Keller Williams released a song &quot;Hula Hoop to the Loop&quot;, dedicated to the toy.
* The final season of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; contains an episode titled &quot;Who Knew?&quot;, in which Sergeant Klinger observes children playing with barrel rings, and fashions a hula hoop-like toy made of metal tubing. He then tries to get Major Winchester to fund their production, but fails.
* &quot;Hula Hooping Girl&quot;, a 2020 street art painting by Banksy in Nottingham, England, portrays a young girl hula-hooping with a bicycle tire.
* Billy Joel&#x27;s 1989 song &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start The Fire&quot; mentions hula hoops in the verse covering the late 1950s and early 1960s.

<text>In complex analysis, the Hardy spaces (or Hardy classes) formula_1 are spaces of holomorphic functions on the unit disk or upper half plane. They were introduced by Frigyes Riesz , who named them after G. H. Hardy, because of the paper . In real analysis Hardy spaces are spaces of distributions on the real -space formula_2, defined (in the sense of distributions) as boundary values of the holomorphic functions. Hardy spaces are related to the &quot;Lp&quot; spaces. For formula_3 these Hardy spaces are subsets of formula_4 spaces, while for &lt;math&gt;0 the formula_4 spaces have some undesirable properties, and the Hardy spaces are much better behaved. Hence, formula_1 spaces can be considered extensions of formula_4 spaces.

Hardy spaces have a number of applications, both in mathematical analysis itself as well as in interdisciplinary areas such as control theory (e.g. formula_8 methods) and scattering theory.

== Definition ==
===On the unit disk===
The Hardy space formula_1 for formula_10 is the class of holomorphic functions formula_11 on the open unit disk formula_12 satisfying
formula_13
If formula_14 then the equation coincides with the definition of the Hardy space -norm, denoted by formula_15

The space &quot;H&quot;∞ is defined as the vector space of bounded holomorphic functions on the disk, with the norm

:formula_16
Denote by &quot;Hp&quot;(T) the vector subspace of &quot;Lp&quot;(T) consisting of all limit functions formula_17, when &quot;f&quot; varies in &quot;Hp&quot;, one then has that for &quot;p&quot; ≥ 1,

:formula_18
where the formula_19 are the Fourier coefficients defined as
formula_20
The space &quot;Hp&quot;(T) is a closed subspace of &quot;Lp&quot;(T). Since &quot;Lp&quot;(T) is a Banach space (for 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot; ≤ ∞), so is &quot;Hp&quot;(T).

The above can be turned around. Given a function formula_21, with &quot;p&quot; ≥ 1, one can regain a (harmonic) function &quot;f&quot; on the unit disk by means of the Poisson kernel &quot;Pr&quot;:

:formula_22

and &quot;f&quot; belongs to &quot;Hp&quot; exactly when formula_17 is in &quot;Hp&quot;(T). Supposing that formula_17 is in &quot;Hp&quot;(T), i.e., formula_17 has Fourier coefficients (&quot;an&quot;)&quot;n&quot;∈Z with &quot;an&quot; = 0 for every &quot;n&quot; &lt; 0, then the associated holomorphic function &quot;f&quot; of &quot;Hp&quot; is given by
formula_26
In applications, those functions with vanishing negative Fourier coefficients are commonly interpreted as the causal solutions. For example, the Hardy space consists of functions whose mean square value remains bounded as formula_27 from below.
Thus, the space &quot;H&quot;2 is seen to sit naturally inside space, and is represented by infinite sequences indexed by N; whereas &quot;L&quot;2 consists of bi-infinite sequences indexed by Z.

===On the upper half plane===
The Hardy space on the upper half-plane formula_28 is defined to be the space of holomorphic functions formula_11 on formula_30 with bounded norm, given by
formula_31
The corresponding formula_32 is defined as functions of bounded norm, with the norm given by
formula_33
The unit disk is isomorphic to the upper half-plane by means of a Möbius transformation. For example, let formula_34 denote the Möbius transformation
formula_35
Then the linear operator formula_36 defined by
formula_37
is an isometric isomorphism of Hardy spaces.

A similar approach applies to, e.g., the right half-plane.

=== On the real vector space===
In analysis on the real vector space R&quot;n&quot;, the Hardy space &quot;Hp&quot; (for 0 &lt; &quot;p&quot; ≤ ∞) consists of tempered distributions &quot;f&quot; such that for some Schwartz function Φ with ∫Φ = 1, the maximal function

:formula_38

is in &quot;Lp&quot;(R&quot;n&quot;), where ∗ is convolution and . The &quot;Hp&quot;-quasinorm ||&quot;f&quot; ||&quot;Hp&quot; of a distribution &quot;f&quot; of &quot;Hp&quot; is defined to be the &quot;Lp&quot; norm of &quot;M&quot;Φ&quot;f&quot; (this depends on the choice of Φ, but different choices of Schwartz functions Φ give equivalent norms). The &quot;Hp&quot;-quasinorm is a norm when &quot;p&quot; ≥ 1, but not when &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1.

If 1 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞, the Hardy space &quot;Hp&quot; is the same vector space as &quot;Lp&quot;, with equivalent norm. When &quot;p&quot; = 1, the Hardy space &quot;H&quot;1 is a proper subspace of &quot;L&quot;1. One can find sequences in &quot;H&quot;1 that are bounded in &quot;L&quot;1 but unbounded in &quot;H&quot;1, for example on the line

:formula_39

The &quot;L&quot;1 and &quot;H&quot;1 norms are not equivalent on &quot;H&quot;1, and &quot;H&quot;1 is not closed in &quot;L&quot;1. The dual of &quot;H&quot;1 is the space &quot;BMO&quot; of functions of bounded mean oscillation. The space &quot;BMO&quot; contains unbounded functions (proving again that &quot;H&quot;1 is not closed in &quot;L&quot;1).

If &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1 then the Hardy space &quot;Hp&quot; has elements that are not functions, and its dual is the homogeneous Lipschitz space of order &quot;n&quot;(1/&quot;p&quot; − 1). When &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1, the &quot;Hp&quot;-quasinorm is not a norm, as it is not subadditive. The &quot;p&quot;th power ||&quot;f&quot; ||&quot;Hp&quot;&quot;p&quot; is subadditive for &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1 and so defines a metric on the Hardy space &quot;Hp&quot;, which defines the topology and makes &quot;Hp&quot; into a complete metric space.

==== Atomic decomposition ====
When 0 &lt; &quot;p&quot; ≤ 1, a bounded measurable function &quot;f&quot; of compact support is in the Hardy space &quot;Hp&quot; if and only if all its moments

:formula_40

whose order &quot;i&quot;1+ ... +&quot;in&quot; is at most &quot;n&quot;(1/&quot;p&quot; − 1), vanish. For example, the integral of &quot;f&quot; must vanish in order that &quot;f&quot; ∈ &quot;Hp&quot;, 0 &lt; &quot;p&quot; ≤ 1, and as long as &quot;p&quot; &gt; this is also sufficient.

If in addition &quot;f&quot; has support in some ball &quot;B&quot; and is bounded by |&quot;B&quot;|−1/&quot;p&quot; then &quot;f&quot; is called an &quot;Hp&quot;-atom (here |&quot;B&quot;| denotes the Euclidean volume of &quot;B&quot; in R&quot;n&quot;). The &quot;Hp&quot;-quasinorm of an arbitrary &quot;Hp&quot;-atom is bounded by a constant depending only on &quot;p&quot; and on the Schwartz function Φ.

When 0 &lt; &quot;p&quot; ≤ 1, any element &quot;f&quot; of &quot;Hp&quot; has an atomic decomposition as a convergent infinite combination of &quot;Hp&quot;-atoms,

:formula_41

where the &quot;aj&quot; are &quot;Hp&quot;-atoms and the &quot;cj&quot; are scalars.

On the line for example, the difference of Dirac distributions &quot;f&quot; = δ1−δ0 can be represented as a series of Haar functions, convergent in &quot;Hp&quot;-quasinorm when 1/2 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1 (on the circle, the corresponding representation is valid for 0 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1, but on the line, Haar functions do not belong to &quot;Hp&quot; when &quot;p&quot; ≤ 1/2 because their maximal function is equivalent at infinity to &quot;a&quot; &quot;x&quot;−2 for some &quot;a&quot; ≠ 0).

== Link between real- and complex-variable Hardy spaces ==
Real-variable techniques, mainly associated to the study of &quot;real Hardy spaces&quot; defined on R&quot;n&quot;, are also used in the simpler framework of the circle. It is a common practice to allow for complex functions (or distributions) in these &quot;real&quot; spaces. The definition that follows does not distinguish between real or complex case.

Let &quot;Pr&quot; denote the Poisson kernel on the unit circle T. For a distribution &quot;f&quot; on the unit circle, set

:formula_42

where the &quot;star&quot; indicates convolution between the distribution &quot;f&quot; and the function eiθ → &quot;Pr&quot;(θ) on the circle. Namely, (&quot;f&quot; ∗ &quot;Pr&quot;)(eiθ) is the result of the action of &quot;f&quot; on the &quot;C&quot;∞-function defined on the unit circle by

:formula_43

For 0 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞, the &quot;real Hardy space&quot; &quot;Hp&quot;(T) consists of distributions &quot;f&quot; such that &quot;M f&quot;  is in &quot;Lp&quot;(T).

The function &quot;F&quot; defined on the unit disk by &quot;F&quot;(&quot;re&quot;iθ) = (&quot;f&quot; ∗ &quot;Pr&quot;)(eiθ) is harmonic, and &quot;M f&quot;  is the &quot;radial maximal function&quot; of &quot;F&quot;. When &quot;M f&quot;  belongs to &quot;Lp&quot;(T) and &quot;p&quot; ≥ 1, the distribution &quot;f&quot;  &quot;&quot;is&quot; a function in &quot;Lp&quot;(T), namely the boundary value of &quot;F&quot;. For &quot;p&quot; ≥ 1, the &quot;real Hardy space&quot; &quot;Hp&quot;(T) is a subset of &quot;Lp&quot;(T).

=== Conjugate function ===
To every real trigonometric polynomial &quot;u&quot; on the unit circle, one associates the real &quot;conjugate polynomial&quot; &quot;v&quot; such that &quot;u&quot; + i&quot;v&quot; extends to a holomorphic function in the unit disk,

:formula_44

This mapping &quot;u&quot; → &quot;v&quot; extends to a bounded linear operator &quot;H&quot; on &quot;Lp&quot;(T), when 1 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞ (up to a scalar multiple, it is the Hilbert transform on the unit circle), and &quot;H&quot; also maps &quot;L&quot;1(T) to weak-&quot;L&quot;1(T). When 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞, the following are equivalent for a &quot;real valued&quot; integrable function &quot;f&quot; on the unit circle:
* the function &quot;f&quot; is the real part of some function &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;Hp&quot;(T)
* the function &quot;f&quot; and its conjugate &quot;H(f)&quot; belong to &quot;Lp&quot;(T)
* the radial maximal function &quot;M f&quot;  belongs to &quot;Lp&quot;(T).

When 1 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞, &quot;H(f)&quot; belongs to &quot;Lp&quot;(T) when &quot;f&quot; ∈ &quot;Lp&quot;(T), hence the real Hardy space &quot;Hp&quot;(T) coincides with &quot;Lp&quot;(T) in this case. For &quot;p&quot; = 1, the real Hardy space &quot;H&quot;1(T) is a proper subspace of &quot;L&quot;1(T).

The case of &quot;p&quot; = ∞ was excluded from the definition of real Hardy spaces, because the maximal function &quot;M f&quot;  of an &quot;L&quot;∞ function is always bounded, and because it is not desirable that real-&quot;H&quot;∞ be equal to &quot;L&quot;∞. However, the two following properties are equivalent for a real valued function &quot;f&quot;
* the function &quot;f&quot;  is the real part of some function &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot;∞(T)
* the function &quot;f&quot;  and its conjugate &quot;H(f)&quot; belong to &quot;L&quot;∞(T).

=== For 0 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1 ===
When 0 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1, a function &quot;F&quot; in &quot;Hp&quot; cannot be reconstructed from the real part of its boundary limit &quot;function&quot; on the circle, because of the lack of convexity of &quot;Lp&quot; in this case. Convexity fails but a kind of &quot;complex convexity&quot;&quot; remains, namely the fact that &quot;z&quot; → |&quot;z&quot;|&quot;q&quot; is subharmonic for every &quot;q&quot; &gt; 0. As a consequence, if

:formula_45

is in &quot;Hp&quot;, it can be shown that &quot;cn&quot; = O(&quot;n&quot;1/&quot;p&quot;–1). It follows that the Fourier series

:formula_46

converges in the sense of distributions to a distribution &quot;f&quot; on the unit circle, and &quot;F&quot;(&quot;re&quot;iθ) =(&quot;f&quot; ∗ &quot;Pr&quot;)(θ). The function &quot;F&quot; ∈ &quot;Hp&quot; can be reconstructed from the real distribution Re(&quot;f&quot;) on the circle, because the Taylor coefficients &quot;cn&quot; of &quot;F&quot; can be computed from the Fourier coefficients of Re(&quot;f&quot;).

Distributions on the circle are general enough for handling Hardy spaces when &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1. Distributions that are not functions do occur, as is seen with functions &quot;F&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = (1−&quot;z&quot;)−&quot;N&quot; (for |&quot;z&quot;| &lt; 1), that belong to &quot;Hp&quot; when 0 &lt; &quot;N&quot; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1 (and &quot;N&quot; an integer ≥ 1).

A real distribution on the circle belongs to real-&quot;Hp&quot;(T) iff it is the boundary value of the real part of some &quot;F&quot; ∈ &quot;Hp&quot;. A Dirac distribution δ&quot;x&quot;, at any point &quot;x&quot; of the unit circle, belongs to real-&quot;Hp&quot;(T) for every &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1; derivatives δ′&quot;x&quot; belong when &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1/2, second derivatives δ′′&quot;x&quot; when &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1/3, and so on.

== Beurling factorization ==
For 0 &lt; &quot;p&quot; ≤ ∞, every non-zero function &quot;f&quot; in &quot;Hp&quot; can be written as the product &quot;f&quot; = &quot;Gh&quot; where &quot;G&quot; is an &quot;outer function&quot; and &quot;h&quot; is an &quot;inner function&quot;, as defined below . This &quot;Beurling factorization&quot; allows the Hardy space to be completely characterized by the spaces of inner and outer functions.

One says that &quot;G&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is an outer (exterior) function if it takes the form

:formula_47

for some complex number &quot;c&quot; with |&quot;c&quot;| = 1, and some positive measurable function formula_48 on the unit circle such that formula_49 is integrable on the circle. In particular, when formula_48 is integrable on the circle, &quot;G&quot; is in &quot;H&quot;1 because the above takes the form of the Poisson kernel . This implies that

:formula_51

for almost every θ.

One says that &quot;h&quot; is an inner (interior) function if and only if |&quot;h&quot;| ≤ 1 on the unit disk and the limit

:formula_52

exists for almost all θ and its modulus is equal to 1 a.e. In particular, &quot;h&quot; is in &quot;H&quot;∞. The inner function can be further factored into a form involving a Blaschke product.

The function &quot;f&quot;, decomposed as &quot;f&quot; = &quot;Gh&quot;, is in &quot;Hp&quot; if and only if φ belongs to &quot;Lp&quot;(T), where φ is the positive function in the representation of the outer function &quot;G&quot;.

Let &quot;G&quot; be an outer function represented as above from a function φ on the circle. Replacing φ by φα, α &gt; 0, a family (&quot;G&quot;α) of outer functions is obtained, with the properties:

:&quot;G&quot;1 = &quot;G&quot;, &quot;G&quot;α+β = &quot;G&quot;α &quot;G&quot;β  and |&quot;G&quot;α| = |&quot;G&quot;|α almost everywhere on the circle.

It follows that whenever 0 &lt; &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot; &lt; ∞ and 1/&quot;r&quot; = 1/&quot;p&quot; + 1/&quot;q&quot;, every function &quot;f&quot; in &quot;Hr&quot; can be expressed as the product of a function in &quot;Hp&quot; and a function in &quot;Hq&quot;. For example: every function in &quot;H&quot;1 is the product of two functions in &quot;H&quot;2; every function in &quot;Hp&quot;, &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1, can be expressed as product of several functions in some &quot;Hq&quot;, &quot;q&quot; &gt; 1.

==Martingale &quot;Hp&quot;==
Let (&quot;Mn&quot;)&quot;n&quot;≥0 be a martingale on some probability space (Ω, Σ, &quot;P&quot;), with respect to an increasing sequence of σ-fields (Σ&quot;n&quot;)&quot;n&quot;≥0. Assume for simplicity that Σ is equal to the σ-field generated by the sequence (Σ&quot;n&quot;)&quot;n&quot;≥0. The &quot;maximal function&quot; of the martingale is defined by

:formula_53

Let 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞. The martingale (&quot;Mn&quot;)&quot;n&quot;≥0 belongs to &quot;martingale&quot;-&quot;Hp&quot; when &quot;M*&quot; ∈ &quot;Lp&quot;.

If &quot;M*&quot; ∈ &quot;Lp&quot;, the martingale (&quot;Mn&quot;)&quot;n&quot;≥0 is bounded in &quot;Lp&quot;; hence it converges almost surely to some function &quot;f&quot; by the martingale convergence theorem. Moreover, &quot;Mn&quot; converges to &quot;f&quot; in &quot;Lp&quot;-norm by the dominated convergence theorem; hence &quot;Mn&quot; can be expressed as conditional expectation of &quot;f&quot; on Σ&quot;n&quot;. It is thus possible to identify martingale-&quot;Hp&quot; with the subspace of &quot;Lp&quot;(Ω, Σ, &quot;P&quot;) consisting of those &quot;f&quot; such that the martingale

:formula_54

belongs to martingale-&quot;Hp&quot;.

Doob&#x27;s maximal inequality implies that martingale-&quot;Hp&quot; coincides with &quot;Lp&quot;(Ω, Σ, &quot;P&quot;) when 1 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞. The interesting space is martingale-&quot;H&quot;1, whose dual is martingale-BMO .

The Burkholder–Gundy inequalities (when &quot;p&quot; &gt; 1) and the Burgess Davis inequality (when &quot;p&quot; = 1) relate the &quot;Lp&quot;-norm of the maximal function to that of the &quot;square function&quot; of the martingale

:formula_55

Martingale-&quot;Hp&quot; can be defined by saying that &quot;S&quot;(&quot;f&quot;)∈ &quot;Lp&quot; .

Martingales with continuous time parameter can also be considered. A direct link with the classical theory is obtained via the complex Brownian motion (&quot;Bt&quot;) in the complex plane, starting from the point &quot;z&quot; = 0 at time &quot;t&quot; = 0. Let τ denote the hitting time of the unit circle. For every holomorphic function &quot;F&quot; in the unit disk,

:formula_56

is a martingale, that belongs to martingale-&quot;Hp&quot; iff &quot;F&quot; ∈ &quot;Hp&quot; .

=== Example===
In this example, Ω = [0, 1] and Σ&quot;n&quot; is the finite field generated by the dyadic partition of [0, 1] into 2&quot;n&quot; intervals of length 2−&quot;n&quot;, for every &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0. If a function &quot;f&quot; on [0, 1] is represented by its expansion on the Haar system (&quot;hk&quot;)

:formula_57

then the martingale-&quot;H&quot;1 norm of &quot;f&quot; can be defined by the &quot;L&quot;1 norm of the square function

:formula_58

This space, sometimes denoted by &quot;H&quot;1(δ), is isomorphic to the classical real &quot;H&quot;1 space on the circle . The Haar system is an unconditional basis for &quot;H&quot;1(δ).

<text>St Mary&#x27;s () is the largest and most populous island of the Isles of Scilly, an archipelago off the southwest coast of Cornwall in England, United Kingdom.

==Description==

St Mary&#x27;s has an area of — 40 percent of the total land area of the Isles of Scilly — this includes four small tidal islands which connect with St Mary&#x27;s at low tide: Toll&#x27;s Island, Taylor&#x27;s Island, Newford Island and the island at Innisidgen.

With a population of 1,723 (out of a total population for Scilly of 2,203) St Mary&#x27;s is relatively densely populated, with twice the average population density of the Isles of Scilly as a whole. The majority of St Mary&#x27;s residents live in the western half of the island, with Hugh Town alone having a population of 1,097.

The main settlement, Hugh Town &quot;(Cornish: Tre Huw)&quot;, was sold to the inhabitants by the Crown in 1949 (it had belonged to the Duchy of Cornwall — which still owns much of the rest of the island). Other settlements on the island are Old Town, Porthloo, Pelistry, Trenoweth, Holy Vale, Maypole, Normandy, Longstone, Rocky Hill and Telegraph.

The island became the home of British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his final resting place after his death in 1995. His grave is at the cemetery at Old Town Church.

===Civil parish and ward===
St Mary&#x27;s is one of the five civil parishes of the Isles of Scilly, which are also wards. St Mary&#x27;s returns 12 councillors to the Council of the Isles of Scilly; this compares with 1 councillor for each of the four &quot;off-island&quot; wards. The civil parish is not functional however, and there is no council or meeting.

==Transport==
St Mary&#x27;s is the only island of the Isles of Scilly with a significant road network and the only island with public highways, including three A roads (measuring in total length) which are numbered in Zone 3 of the British numbering scheme (the A3110, A3111 and A3112); these &#x27;A&#x27; roads are generally country lanes in nature. Roads and streets across Scilly have very few signs or markings, and route numbers are not marked at all.

In 2005 there were 619 cars and vans on St Mary&#x27;s; the island also has taxis and a conducted bus tour. Vehicles in Scilly are exempt from annual MOT tests.

By air, the island is served by St Mary&#x27;s Airport. Fixed-wing aircraft services are scheduled, operated by Isles of Scilly Skybus, to and from Land&#x27;s End, Newquay, and (except in winter) Exeter. Helicopter services were operated by British International Helicopters, from Penzance Heliport; this service, which started in 1964 (then operated by BEA Helicopters), ceased at the end of October 2012.

Helicopter flights resumed in 2020 with the launch of the Penzance Helicopter service.

By sea, the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company provides a passenger and cargo service from Penzance, which is currently operated by the &quot;Scillonian III&quot; passenger ferry, supported by the &quot;Gry Maritha&quot; cargo vessel. The other islands are linked to St. Mary&#x27;s by a network of inter-island launches. The main harbour of St Mary&#x27;s (and the Isles of Scilly) is at Hugh Town, and is called St Mary&#x27;s Harbour. Further slipways and small quays exist around the island, at natural harbour sites, such as at Old Town, Pendrathen, Watermill Cove, and Porthloo.

===RNLI===
There has been an RNLI lifeboat station on St Mary&#x27;s since 1837. The first two lifeboats were kept in a boathouse on the town beach at Hugh Town. Following closure in 1855 the lifeboat station was re-opened in 1874 and a boathouse was built on the beach at Porth Cressa. In 1899 a new boathouse and slipway were built at Carn Thomas and the first motor boat arrived in 1919.

The lifeboatmen of St Mary&#x27;s have earned 26 RNLI medals for bravery, comprising one gold, nine silver and 16 bronze, the last awarded in 2004.

==Churches==
There are Anglican churches such as St Mary&#x27;s Church, St Mary&#x27;s and St Mary&#x27;s Old Church, St Mary&#x27;s.

John Wesley preached here on 13 September 1743. The Wesleyan Methodist Society was established in 1788 and the first chapel erected in 1790. This was replaced in 1828. The present Methodist church was built in 1899 by A.J. Trenear in Hugh Town and is part of the Isles of Scilly Methodist Circuit.

==Cornish Wrestling==
Captain James Williams White (1826-1903), the champion Cornish wrestler, was born on St Mary&#x27;s and after emigrating lived in Burra, South Australia, from 1856.

==Landmarks==
===Telegraph Tower===
The tower on Newford Down, now known as Telegraph Tower, was built in 1814 to serve as an Admiralty Telegraph Station, but it had closed by 1816. The building then reverted to the custody of the landowner - the Duke of Leeds. In 1831 the site was taken over by the Coastguard as a subsidiary to the main station situated on the Garrison. In 1903 a wireless mast and receiving office were built nearby, and in 1908 a telegraph house was erected on the tower&#x27;s roof. The wider site was developed into a modern radio transmitting and communications site by the late-C20. The tower is now a private residence. It was at this tower about 1898 that Guglielmo Marconi heard wireless signals transmitted from Porthcurno, a distance of 30 miles. It was used by Radio Scilly for broadcasting.

Note: To strengthen Scilly&#x27;s defences Major Daniel Lyman proposed the construction of three gun towers in 1803, each armed with a 32-pounder carronade on top. The presence of three towers on St Mary&#x27;s, in the heart of the Garrison, on Buzza Hill and at Newford Down, has led some writers to link them to Lyman&#x27;s proposal. However, his proposal was never enacted, and the three towers have different origins.

===Harry&#x27;s Walls===

Harry&#x27;s Walls are the remains of an unfinished artillery castle situated on a hilltop to the north-east of Hugh Town. It was begun in 1551 as part of a major phase of fortification on the Isles of Scilly, undertaken to counter threats from the French. It was left unfinished because the site was recognised to be unsuitable.

===Giant&#x27;s Castle===

Giant&#x27;s Castle is an Iron Age cliff castle on the coastal path between the airfield and Porth Hellick Bay.

===The Garrison and Star Castle===
Star Castle is at the centre of a fortification system around the west side of St Mary&#x27;s known as the Garrison. The walls of the castle take the shape of an eight-pointed star. It comprises an outer wall around the outcrop of Hew Hill, protecting the town and the castle, with strategically placed gun batteries at regular intervals around the outer wall, allowing covering fire at all angles. A redundant windmill was converted after 1831 into Garrison Tower as a lookout tower for HM Coastguard.

The Star Castle was built in 1593 by the Surveyor of the Royal Works and mapmaker Robert Adams (d.1595), under the direction of Francis Godolphin, following the Spanish Armada of 1588. Fearing another Spanish invasion, in May 1593 Queen Elizabeth I ordered the construction of a fort and two sconces as a lookout for any intruder ships.

In 1740 Master Gunner Abraham Tovey transformed the Garrison building walls with gun batteries, including Colonel Boscawen&#x27;s Battery, in a circular shape following the coast line of The Hoe. Star Castle is now a hotel.
===Peninnis Head===
The 14 metre metal tower lighthouse on Peninnis Head was built in 1911 as a replacement for the 1680 lighthouse in the centre of St Agnes. The lighthouse was converted from acetylene gas to electricity in 1992 and the original range of 17 nautical miles was reduced to nine in 2011. The headland is within the Isles of Scilly Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and part of the Heritage Coast. It is also a Geological Conservation Review site for its Quaternary geomorphology and was first designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1971 for both its biological and geological interests.

===Porthellick Cove===
Porthellick Cove contains a memorial to mark the spot where the body of Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell was washed ashore after the 1707 Scilly naval disaster. This was one of the greatest maritime disasters in British history, when four ships (&quot;Association&quot;, &quot;Firebrand&quot;, &quot;Romney&quot; and &quot;Eagle&quot;) with nearly 2,000 sailors were lost.

===Other locations===
The following is a list of some other locations on St Mary&#x27;s:

* Lower Moors Nature Reserve
* Higher Moors Nature Reserve (see Porth Hellick)
* Holy Vale
* Porthloo Beach
* Watermill Cove
* Innisidgen Burial Chamber
* Isles of Scilly Golf Club, near Telegraph and Porthloo

==Population==
==Education==

Five Islands Academy (previously Five Islands School) has a combined primary and secondary campus in St. Mary&#x27;s. A boarding house, Mundesley Boarding House, serves secondary students from other islands. Students at the sixth-form college level reside and board elsewhere, in mainland Great Britain. Previously the Learning and Skills Council paid for costs of accommodation for sixth-formers.

St. Mary&#x27;s Library is located at the Porthcressa seafront.

Carn Gwaval Wellbeing Centre has adult further education programmes.

<text>Edward Adolphus Ferdinand Seymour, Earl St. Maur (17 July 1835 – 30 September 1869, in Dover Street, London), also 13th Baron Seymour in his own right, was a British aristocrat and soldier.

==Background==
He was the eldest son of Edward Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset, and Georgiana Sheridan. He was styled Lord Seymour until 1863 when his father was created Earl St Maur, of Berry Pomeroy, and he adopted his father&#x27;s new creation as a courtesy title. He was commonly known as Ferdy. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1853.

Seymour attended the 1856 coronation of Alexander II of Russia, as attaché to Lord Granville.

==Military career==
Seymour joined the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry Cavalry as a cornet in 1856. He briefly served as a volunteer on the staff in the Anglo-Persian War (1855–1857), alongside Lord Schomberg Kerr and Ulick de Burgh, Lord Dunkellin, and was assigned by James Outram to work with his Political Secretary Robert Lewis Taylor (c.1821–1905) of the Bombay Native Infantry. Shortly afterwards, he was at the Relief of Lucknow during the Indian Rebellion (1857–1858). His gallantry was recognised by Sir Colin Campbell.

Back in England, Seymour commanded the 1st Buckinghamshire Rifle Volunteer Corps. He also was a cornet in the 4th Dragoon Guards. He resigned his Guards commission at the beginning of 1860, and positions of Captain Commandant in the Wiltshire militia by June 1860.

Seymour went to Italy a civilian volunteer in 1860, and joined Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s Esercito Meridionale (Southern Army) as a private soldier. He assumed the rank of captain on the basis of his British militia rank; and called himself by the pseudonym &quot;Captain Richard Sarsfield&quot;. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Volturnus in October of that year. Garibaldi later confirmed his rank of Captain, by November.

==Scott affair==
In 1860, Seymour horsewhipped Charles Alexander Scott of Garibaldi&#x27;s forces in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Court cases followed.

===Captain Scott===
Seymour&#x27;s victim, known as Captain Scott for military purposes, was Karl Blumenthal, British-born in London in 1803. He had spent much time in Italy, where he used the name Carlo Alessandro Scott or Blumenthal. He died in 1866. (While he was in some way connected to the noted Blumenthal Jewish merchant family of Venice, to which Olga Blumenthal belonged, nothing definite seems to be known, according to the dissertation of Emilia Peatini.)

Blumenthal&#x27;s mother was reported to be Venetian, and he was involved in Daniele Manin&#x27;s struggle on behalf of the Venetian Republic of San Marco, sent from the staff of Guglielmo Pepe. He also defended the Roman Republic of 1849 against Austria, which he did as deputy to Garibaldi. He sought in 1860 to involve himself in the Mortara case by an expedition to Rome, that later came to nothing. A contemporary account of his efforts on behalf of the Hunters of the Alps is in &quot;Les Chasseurs des Alpes et des Apennins&quot; (1860) by Louis de La Varenne.

===Context===
Seymour was Military Secretary under Colonel John Whitehead Peard of the British Legion by October 1860. Seymour, according to some accounts, accused a brother officer of embezzling funds. The officer challenged Seymour to a duel, that Peard forbade him to attend,

Bacchin writes:

&quot;... in a public letter, Captain Scott accused both Peard and Captain Sarffield, who was the brigade secretary, of &#x27;stirring things up, making things up, and slandering&#x27;. This caused riots and police mobilization in the centre of Naples.&quot;

===British Legion background===
George Holyoake, organiser in London of the Legion, wrote in his memoirs that &quot;There being no legal power to enforce order was the cardinal weakness of the British Legion.&quot; On its arrival in Palermo, bogus commissions caused confusion, and there were &quot;Captain Sarsfield, Colonel Peard known as &quot;Garibaldi&#x27;s Englishman,&quot; De Rohan, Captain Scott, and others on the spot, with colourable pretensions to authority&quot;.

It was argued at the time that Scott and &quot;an Italian&quot; who used the name Captain Hugh Forbes were interfering with the British Legion&#x27;s effectiveness, as outsiders. Forbes, like Scott, was of British birth, had lived in Italy for a long period, and was a veteran of the 1848–9 conflicts. After a period in the United States, he had recruited in the United Kingdom a multinational group for Garibaldi with support from George W. M. Reynolds. Forbes&#x27;s candidate for commander of the British Legion, called Hicks, had been thrown out of the party before it sailed from Harwich by William James Linton, accused of financial irregularity. At the end of October, Forbes was trying to attract further support for his brigade stationed at Resina, from the British Legion, with support from Scott.

===Scott&#x27;s account===
In a pamphlet of 1863, Scott gave his own version of events:

Seymour objected to a payment to an English army contractor, who applied to Scott. Scott looked at the paperwork, and sided with the contractor. Seymour insulted Scott, who &quot;had no alternative but to request an explanation&quot;. He had no intention of fighting a duel.

Seymour insisted they fight with swords. Scott came to the place appointed for the duel, but Seymour did not, citing Peard&#x27;s veto on the duel. Seymour later laid in wait with accomplices for Scott, and beat him.

===Aftermath===
The contractor was named by Scott as S. Isaac, Campbell &amp; Co.; Scott said he had met Samuel Isaac in Naples, in October. Isaac wrote a conciliatory letter, published in the &quot;Army and Navy Gazette&quot; of 15 December 1860, referring to the assault as &quot;an old man beaten over the head with a hunting crop&quot;.

Seymour associated at this time in Naples with Laurence Oliphant and stayed with Lady Holland, widow of Henry Fox, 4th Baron Holland. He returned to London around the end of November 1860.

The civil action Scott v Lord Seymour for tort (assault and false imprisonment) in the Court of Exchequer was argued in April and May 1862, with judgement for the plaintiff Scott. In December 1862 an appeal on the conflict of laws aspect of the case upheld the judgement. Seymour paid Scott £500 for the assault.

==Elevation to the House of Lords==
In July 1863 Seymour was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Seymour.

==Personal life and the Seymour succession==
In 1866 Seymour began a relationship with a 17-year-old maid called Rosina Elizabeth Swan, of Higham, Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk. He took her with him during his travels, returning to England with her in 1868 to live near Brighton. Seymour and Rosina had two children; a girl Ruth Mary (1867–1953) was born whilst the couple were in Tangier and a boy Harold St. Maur was born in Brighton.

A few months after the birth of his son, Seymour died during a botched emergency tracheotomy at his flat in Dover Street, Mayfair, London. If Seymour had been married to Rosina, Harold would have now been the heir to his grandfather&#x27;s dukedom; and he spent years trying to prove that a marriage had taken place. Searching for a possible Dutch witness to the marriage, by the name of Ravesteyn, he vainly published an advertisement in a newspaper in the Netherlands in 1924, offering a reward of £50 for proof of the fact.

In 1885 the 12th Duke died. He had outlived both of his sons (Seymour&#x27;s brother, Lord Edward, having died in 1865). The 12th Duke&#x27;s brother Archibald Seymour became the 13th Duke of Somerset.

<text>Clostridium is a genus of anaerobic, Gram-positive bacteria. Species of &quot;Clostridium&quot; inhabit soils and the intestinal tracts of animals, including humans. This genus includes several significant human pathogens, including the causative agents of botulism and tetanus. It also formerly included an important cause of diarrhea, &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;, which was reclassified into the &quot;Clostridioides&quot; genus in 2016.

== History ==
In the late 1700s, Germany experienced several outbreaks of an illness connected to eating specific sausages. In 1817, the German neurologist Justinus Kerner detected rod-shaped cells in his investigations into this so-called sausage poisoning. In 1897, the Belgian biology professor Emile van Ermengem published his finding of an endospore-forming organism he isolated from spoiled ham. Biologists classified van Ermengem&#x27;s discovery along with other known gram-positive spore formers in the genus &quot;Bacillus&quot;. This classification presented problems, however, because the isolate grew only in anaerobic conditions, but &quot;Bacillus&quot; grew well in oxygen.

Circa 1880, in the course of studying fermentation and butyric acid synthesis, a scientist surnamed Prazmowski first assigned a binomial name to &quot;Clostridium butyricum&quot;. The mechanisms of anaerobic respiration were still not yet well elucidated at that time, so taxonomy of anaerobes was still developing.

In 1924, Ida A. Bengtson separated van Ermengem&#x27;s microorganisms from the &quot;Bacillus&quot; group and assigned them to the genus &quot;Clostridium&quot;. By Bengtson&#x27;s classification scheme, &quot;Clostridium&quot; contained all of the anaerobic endospore-forming rod-shaped bacteria, except the genus &quot;Desulfotomaculum&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

As of October 2022, there are 164 validly published species in &quot;Clostridium&quot;.

The genus, as traditionally defined, contains many organisms not closely related to its type species. The issue was originally illustrated in full detail by a rRNA phylogeny from Collins 1994, which split the traditional genus (now corresponding to a large slice of Clostridia) into twenty clusters, with cluster &quot;I&quot; containing the type species &quot;Clostridium butyricum&quot; and its close relatives. Over the years, this has resulted in many new genera being split out, with the ultimate goal of constraining &quot;Clostridium&quot; to cluster &quot;I&quot;.

&quot;Clostridium&quot; cluster &quot;XIVa&quot; (now Lachnospiraceae) and &quot;Clostridium&quot; cluster &quot;IV&quot; (now Ruminococcaceae) efficiently ferment plant polysaccharide composing dietary fiber, making them important and abundant taxa in the rumen and the human large intestine. As mentioned before, these clusters are not part of current &quot;Clostridium&quot;, and use of these terms should be avoided due to ambiguous or inconsistent usage.

==Biochemistry==
Species of &quot;Clostridium&quot; are obligate anaerobe and capable of producing endospores. They generally stain gram-positive, but as well as &quot;Bacillus&quot;, are often described as Gram-variable, because they show an increasing number of gram-negative cells as the culture ages.
The normal, reproducing cells of &quot;Clostridium&quot;, called the vegetative form, are rod-shaped, which gives them their name, from the Greek κλωστήρ or spindle. &quot;Clostridium&quot; endospores have a distinct bowling pin or bottle shape, distinguishing them from other bacterial endospores, which are usually ovoid in shape. The Schaeffer–Fulton stain (0.5% malachite green in water) can be used to distinguish endospores of &quot;Bacillus&quot; and &quot;Clostridium&quot; from other microorganisms.

&quot;Clostridium&quot; can be differentiated from the also endospore forming genus &quot;Bacillus&quot; by its obligate anaerobic growth, the shape of endospores and the lack of catalase. Species of &quot;Desulfotomaculum&quot; form similar endospores and can be distinguished by their requirement for sulfur.
Glycolysis and fermentation of pyruvic acid by Clostridia yield the end products butyric acid, butanol, acetone, isopropanol, and carbon dioxide.

There is a commercially available polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test kit (Bactotype) for the detection of &quot;C. perfringens&quot; and other pathogenic bacteria.

==Biology and pathogenesis==
&quot;Clostridium&quot; species are readily found inhabiting soils and intestinal tracts. &quot;Clostridium&quot; species are also a normal inhabitant of the healthy lower reproductive tract of females.

The main species responsible for disease in humans are:
* &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; can produce botulinum toxin in food or wounds and can cause botulism. This same toxin is known as Botox and is used in cosmetic surgery to paralyze facial muscles to reduce the signs of aging; it also has numerous other therapeutic uses.
* &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; causes a wide range of symptoms, from food poisoning to cellulitis, fasciitis, necrotic enteritis and gas gangrene.
* &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot; causes tetanus.

Several more pathogenic species, that were previously described in &quot;Clostridium&quot;, have been found to belong to other genera.
* &quot;Clostridium difficile&quot;, now placed in &quot;Clostridioides&quot;.
* &quot;Clostridium histolyticum&quot;, now placed in &quot;Hathewaya&quot;.
* &quot;Clostridium sordellii&quot;, now placed in &quot;Paraclostridium&quot;, can cause a fatal infection in exceptionally rare cases after medical abortions.

== Treatment ==
In general, the treatment of clostridial infection is high-dose penicillin G, to which the organism has remained susceptible. &quot;Clostridium welchii&quot; and &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot; respond to sulfonamides. Clostridia are also susceptible to tetracyclines, carbapenems (imipenem), metronidazole, vancomycin, and chloramphenicol.

The vegetative cells of clostridia are heat-labile and are killed by short heating at temperatures above . The thermal destruction of &quot;Clostridium&quot; spores requires higher temperatures (above , for example in an autoclave) and longer cooking times (20 min, with a few exceptional cases of more than 50 min recorded in the literature). &quot;Clostridia&quot; and &quot;Bacilli&quot; are quite radiation-resistant, requiring doses of about 30 kGy, which is a serious obstacle to the development of shelf-stable irradiated foods for general use in the retail market. The addition of lysozyme, nitrate, nitrite and propionic acid salts inhibits clostridia in various foods.

Fructooligosaccharides (fructans) such as inulin, occurring in relatively large amounts in a number of foods such as chicory, garlic, onion, leek, artichoke, and asparagus, have a prebiotic or bifidogenic effect, selectively promoting the growth and metabolism of beneficial bacteria in the colon, such as &quot;Bifidobacteria&quot; and Lactobacilli, while inhibiting harmful ones, such as clostridia, fusobacteria, and &quot;Bacteroides&quot;.

== Use ==
* &quot;Clostridium thermocellum&quot; can use lignocellulosic waste and generate ethanol, thus making it a possible candidate for use in production of ethanol fuel. It also has no oxygen requirement and is thermophilic, which reduces cooling cost.
* &quot;Clostridium acetobutylicum&quot; was first used by Chaim Weizmann to produce acetone and biobutanol from starch in 1916 for the production of cordite (smokeless gunpowder).
* &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; produces a potentially lethal neurotoxin used in a diluted form in the drug Botox, which is carefully injected to nerves in the face, which prevents the movement of the expressive muscles of the forehead, to delay the wrinkling effect of aging. It is also used to treat spasmodic torticollis and provides relief for around 12 to 16 weeks.
* &quot;Clostridium butyricum&quot; MIYAIRI 588 strain is marketed in Japan, Korea, and China for &quot;Clostridium difficile&quot; prophylaxis due to its reported ability to interfere with the growth of the latter.
* &quot;Clostridium histolyticum&quot; has been used as a source of the enzyme collagenase, which degrades animal tissue. Clostridium species excrete collagenase to eat through tissue and, thus, help the pathogen spread throughout the body. The medical profession uses collagenase for the same reason in the débridement of infected wounds. Hyaluronidase, deoxyribonuclease, lecithinase, leukocidin, protease, lipase, and hemolysin are also produced by some clostridia that cause gas gangrene.
* &quot;Clostridium ljungdahlii&quot;, recently discovered in commercial chicken wastes, can produce ethanol from single-carbon sources including synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, that can be generated from the partial combustion of either fossil fuels or biomass.
* &quot;Clostridium butyricum&quot; converts glycerol to 1,3-propanediol.
* Genes from &quot;Clostridium thermocellum&quot; have been inserted into transgenic mice to allow the production of endoglucanase. The experiment was intended to learn more about how the digestive capacity of monogastric animals could be improved. 
* Nonpathogenic strains of &quot;Clostridium&quot; may help in the treatment of diseases such as cancer. Research shows that &quot;Clostridium&quot; can selectively target cancer cells. Some strains can enter and replicate within solid tumors. &quot;Clostridium&quot; could, therefore, be used to deliver therapeutic proteins to tumours. This use of &quot;Clostridium&quot; has been demonstrated in a variety of preclinical models.
* Mixtures of &quot;Clostridium&quot; species, such as &quot;Clostridium beijerinckii&quot;, &quot;Clostridium butyricum&quot;, and species from other genera have been shown to produce biohydrogen from yeast waste.

<text>Captain Patrick Logan (baptised 15 November 1791 – 17 October 1830) was a Scottish army officer who was the commandant of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement from 1826 until his death in 1830 at the hands of Aboriginal Australians. As he had been hated by convicts, there were rumours that escaped convicts living in the bush had attacked him, but there is no evidence of this.

Logan had a distinguished military career. He was known as a strict commandant of the penal colony to the point of cruelty. Logan made significant explorations of what was to become known as South East Queensland. He was the first European to discover the area which became Ipswich, Queensland and some consider him to be the founder of Queensland.

== Early life ==
Patrick Logan was born in East Renton, Berwickshire, Scotland, the youngest son of Abraham Logan, a Scottish landowner and farmer, and Janet Johnstown. He was baptised at Coldingham, Berwickshire on 15 November 1791. Logan&#x27;s family could trace their ancestry to two representatives who accompanied Sir James Douglas to the Holy Land in the 14th century.

==Military career==
In 1810 he joined the 57th Foot Regiment and served in the Peninsular War. He took part in the battles of Salamanca with the retreat from Salamanca; Vittoria; Nivelle and Toulouse. Logan&#x27;s regiment was sent to Canada in 1814 where he stayed for a year before joining Wellington&#x27;s Army of Occupation in Paris. He left the army during peacetime and returned to Ireland to take up farming.

Deciding that life as a farmer was not for him, he rejoined the 57th Foot Regiment in 1819. On 5 September 1823 he married Letitia Anna O&#x27;Beirne and they had two children, Robert Abraham Logan (1824 – ?) and Letitia Bingham Logan (1826 – ?). His regiment was ordered to New South Wales, leaving Cork on 5 January 1825.

Logan arrived in Sydney, New South Wales, with his regiment on 22 April 1825 aboard the &quot;Hooghly&quot;. Most of his time in Sydney was spent guarding convicts. In November, Governor Thomas Brisbane appointed Logan as commandant of the convict settlement at Moreton Bay, Queensland. It was March 1826 by the time he reached the settlement, aboard the &quot;Amity&quot; ship.

==Penal settlement==
The settlement was quite primitive and Logan embarked on a building program, and on planting maize. During his time as commandant, the convict population there increased from 77 to over 1,000.

He designed and oversaw the construction of a hospital, a jail and a windmill. He also built a surgeon&#x27;s quarters, barracks and a number of houses in his first year as Commandant. He administered crops of wheat and maize at various locations. He believed that the settlement was a place to punish the convicts, forcing them to work by hand from sunrise to sunset. In 1827 the Attorney General noted that Logan had in multiple situations ordered that convicts be subject to 150 lashes, justifying the extreme criticism bestowed on him in the contemporary ballad Moreton Bay.

==Explorations==
He also systematically explored the outer part of south-east Queensland. He discovered the southern entrance to Moreton Bay, now known as the Gold Coast Broadwater. He named the McPherson Range, Birnam Range, Teviot Brook and Wilsons Peak. Logan discovered the Logan River in 1826, which he wished to be named the Darling River after Governor Ralph Darling, but the Governor decided that the river should be named in honour of Logan instead.

Logan was the first European explorer to visit the upper reaches of the Brisbane River and other places in the vicinity including the areas now known as Esk and the mountain rainforests of Lamington National Park and Mount Barney National Park. He was the first European to explore the Bremer River, where he discovered deposits of limestone at a point later to become known as Ipswich.

Captain Logan unsuccessfully attempted to climb Mount Barney on 13 and 14 June 1827. On a return journey, Logan, Allan Cunningham, Charles Fraser and a small party attempted to ascend the peak, believing they were climbing Mount Warning, which was first identified by James Cook. A determined Logan carried on while the rest were too fearful of the hazardous and difficult climb. From atop the summit, which was at the time the highest point reached in Australia, Logan was able to see the true Mount Warning. Together with Cunningham they decided to call this range the McPherson Range. He named the peak he had just ascended, Mount Hooker, but because his map was lost, the mountain was later given another name, Mount Barney. He also originally named the current Mount Lindesay, Mount Hooker.

==Death==
On 9 October Logan set out to explore and chart the headwaters of the Brisbane River with a small party of one private (his servant), and three convicts. The party was confronted several times by large armed groups of Aboriginals. The first meeting was when they were making a river crossing: a large group of men brandished weapons, rolled boulders down a hill at the group, and shouted &#x27;Commidy Water&#x27; which was thought to mean that Logan should go back across the water. There were other confrontations and sightings. Logan had the habit of riding ahead of the group and during the return journey, on 17 October, they lost track of him, although they thought they could hear him shout &#x27;Cooyee&#x27; and shouted back and fired guns. Searches eventually led to first his saddle, then his dead horse, hidden by boughs in a stream bed, then his body, buried in a shallow grave.

As the horse had evidently failed to leap over the creek resulting in its death, it has been conjectured that the injuries and death of Captain Logan may have been accidental. However, contemporary news reports are emphatic that he was murdered with native weapons, as proved by the settlement&#x27;s surgeon, Mr Cowper, at an inquest.

In November 1830, Logan was buried in the Protestant burial ground in Surry Hills, Sydney.

==Legacy==
Logan had been hated by the convicts because of his strict discipline and program of punishments. Moreton Bay convicts &quot;manifested insane joy at the news of his murder, and sang and hoorayed all night, in defiance of the warders.&quot; The ballad Moreton Bay represents Logan as a bloody tyrant. &quot;Captain Logan, he had us mangled, on the triangles of Moreton Bay&quot;, attributes his death to &quot;a native black&quot;, and concludes &quot;my fellow prisoners, be exhilarated, that all such monsters such a death may find&quot;. In the long poem &quot;A Convict&#x27;s Tour to Hell&quot;, written in 1839 by the convict Francis MacNamara, also thought to have composed the &quot;Moreton Bay&quot; lyrics, the convict sees Captain Logan suffering in hell.

Many geographic features in South East Queensland bear his name. These include Logan City, the Logan Motorway and Logan Road, Logan River, Logan Central, Logan Village, Logan Reserve, Loganholme, Loganlea and Logans Ridge. A commemorative plaque to one of Logan&#x27;s expeditions can be found in Tully Memorial Park by the Logan River at North Maclean. The Queensland state electorate of Logan is also named for him.

&quot;The Commandant&quot; (1975) is a historical fiction novel by Jessica Anderson which describes the Moreton Bay penal settlement under Logan&#x27;s command and the events surrounding his death from the viewpoint of his wife&#x27;s sister Frances (a fictional character), who lives with the Logan family at the penal colony.

<doc id="314792" wikidata="Q2276724" url="?curid=314792" title="Operation Defensive Shield">
<text>Operation Defensive Shield ( ) was a 2002 Israeli military operation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank during the Second Intifada. Lasting for just over a month, it was the largest combat operation in the West Bank since the start of Israel&#x27;s occupation in 1967. 

The operation began with an Israeli incursion into Ramallah, where Yasser Arafat was placed under siege at his compound. This was followed by successive incursions into the six largest cities in the West Bank and their surrounding localities. Israel&#x27;s military moved into Tulkarm and Qalqilya on April 1, into Bethlehem on April 2, and into Jenin and Nablus on April 3. From April 3–21, Israeli forces enforced strict curfews on the civilian Palestinian populations in the West Bank, and restricted movements of international personnel, including, prohibition of entry to humanitarian and medical personnel as well as human rights monitors and journalists.

In May 2002, Israeli troops withdrew from Palestinian cities in the West Bank while maintaining cordons of troops around certain towns and villages, and also continued carrying out raids on Palestinian-populated areas.

The United Nations&#x27; report on the subject states: &quot;Combatants on both sides conducted themselves in ways that, at times, placed civilians in harm&#x27;s way. Much of the fighting during Operation Defensive Shield occurred in areas heavily populated by civilians and in many cases heavy weaponry was used.&quot;

== Background ==
The Israeli–Palestinian conflict escalated during the Second Intifada. In January and February 2002, 71 people were killed on all sides during attacks from Palestinian terrorists and the Israeli army. March and April 2002 saw a dramatic increase in attacks against Israelis by Palestinian militants such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Fatah-affiliated Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades. In addition to numerous shooting and grenade attacks, fifteen suicide bombings were carried out in March, an average of one suicide bombing every two days. March 2002 became known in Israel as &quot;Black March&quot;. The large number of attacks severely disrupted daily life in Israel.

The first wave of Israeli incursions took place between 27 February and 14 March. Following nine attacks by Palestinian militants between March 2–5, the Israeli cabinet decided to massively expand its military activity against these groups. On March 5, while talking with reporters in the Knesset cafeteria, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, pointing to the bloodiest week against Israelis since the start of the Second Intifada, explained the cabinet&#x27;s decision: &quot;The Palestinians must be hit, and it must be very painful. ... We must cause them losses, victims, so that they feel a heavy price.&quot;

Palestinian attacks continued, with suicide bombings on 9 March (see Café Moment bombing), 20 March, and 21 March. Shooting and grenade attacks also continued to occur in Israel and Israeli settlements. On 27 March, a suicide attack occurred in Netanya, where 30 people were killed in the Park Hotel while celebrating Passover. The event became known as the Passover massacre. The following day, a Palestinian gunman infiltrated the Israeli settlement of Elon Moreh and killed four members of the same family.

On March 29, the Israeli government announced Operation Defensive Shield, terming it a large-scale counter-terrorist offensive. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued emergency call-up notices for 30,000 reserve soldiers, the largest call-up since the 1982 Lebanon War. The same day, two Israelis were stabbed in the Gaza settlement of Netzarim. Two suicide bombings occurred the next day, and another one took place the day after that.

Overall, in March 2002, some 130 Israelis including approximately 100 noncombatants were killed in Palestinian attacks, while a total of 238 Palestinians including at least 83 noncombatants were killed in the same month by the IDF.

== Stated goals ==
The stated goals of the operation (as conveyed to the Israeli Knesset by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on April 8, 2002) were: to catch and arrest terrorists and, primarily, their dispatchers and those who finance and support them; to confiscate weapons intended to be used against Israeli citizens; to expose and destroy facilities and explosives, laboratories, weapons production factories and secret installations. The orders are clear: target and paralyze anyone who takes up weapons and tries to oppose our troops, resists them or endangers them—and to avoid harming the civilian population. IDF officers also noted that incursions would force Palestinian militants &quot;to exert their energy by defending their homes in the camps instead of by plotting attacks on Israelis.&quot;

The Palestinian attachment to the UN report on Operation Defensive Shield challenged the validity of the Israeli claim that it was targeting &quot;terrorists,&quot; noting that, [...] the record shows clearly that the nature of the actions taken, the amount of harm inflicted on the population and the practical results prove completely different political goals [...] the Israeli occupying forces have consistently targeted the Palestinian police and security forces, instead of &quot;terrorists&quot;, and have consistently tried to destroy the Palestinian Authority and declared it an &quot;enemy&quot;, instead of groups hostile to peace in the Middle East.

== Operation ==
Operation Defensive Shield was announced on March 29, but it is widely assumed preparations began nearly a month before. In early April, the IDF was conducting major military operations inside all Palestinian cities, but the majority of the fighting centered on Bethlehem, Jenin, Nablus, and Ramallah. Over 20,000 Israeli reservists were activated during the conflict.

===Jenin===
According to Israeli authorities, Jenin became a central base for terror groups and terror attacks mounted by several organizations, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, and Hamas. The IDF spokesman attributed 23 of the 60 suicide bombers that attacked Israel in 2002 to Palestinians from Jenin.

On April 2, more than 1,000 IDF soldiers entered the camp, calling civilians and non-combatants to leave. An estimated 13,000 Palestinians were housed in Jenin prior to the operation.

The operation was led by the 5th Infantry Brigade, which had not yet been trained in close-quarters combat. During a series of sweeps, the Israeli military claimed the entire camp was booby-trapped. At least 2,000 bombs and booby traps were planted throughout the camp. In response to the discovery, the Israelis dispatched combat bulldozers to detonate any bombs that were placed in the streets.

Israeli commanders were still not confident that soldiers would be safe from booby traps and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). A rapid ground attack would clearly be costly in IDF lives, but political pressure from the United States and elsewhere required a rapid end to the fighting. Former defense minister Shaul Mofaz promised combat-operations would be over by April 6, but that was clearly impossible. The IDF slowly advanced into the city, encountering fierce resistance. Most of the fighting was conducted by infantry fighting house-to-house, while armored bulldozers were used to clear away booby traps and IEDs. Air support was limited to helicopter gunships firing wire-guided missiles. Palestinian commander Mahmoud Tawalbe was killed during the battle. According to a British military expert, he was killed by an Israeli bulldozer, while the Palestinians claimed that blew himself up to collapse a house on Israeli soldiers.

On the third day of operations, an IDF unit wandered into a Palestinian ambush. Thirteen Israeli soldiers were killed and three of the bodies were captured before a Shayetet 13 naval commando unit could retrieve them.

After the ambush, the Israeli military developed a tactic that allowed units to advance farther and more safely into the camps. Israeli commanders would send an armored bulldozer to ram the corner of a house, creating a hole. An IDF Achzarit would then enter the hole, allowing troops to clear the house without going through booby-trapped doors. Palestinian resistance was halted following the adoption of the bulldozer method, and most residents of the Hawashin neighborhood surrendered before it was leveled. Palestinian commander Hazem Qabha refused to surrender and was killed.

Throughout the Battle of Jenin, and for a few days afterwards, the city and its refugee camp were under total closure. There was much concern at the time about possible human rights violations occurring in the camp. Allegations of a massacre in Jenin were spread by Palestinians in order to create pressure on Israel to halt the operation. Claims of complete destruction of the Jenin refugee camp, a massacre of 500 civilians, and mass graves being dug by Israeli soldiers were proven false after a United Nations investigation. Reports of a large-scale massacre were found to be untrue, a result of confusion resulting from the Israeli refusal to allow entry to outside observers, and/or Palestinian media manipulation.

Ultimately, the Jenin incursion resulted in the deaths of 52 Palestinians. According to Israel, five were civilians and the rest were militants. Human Rights Watch reported that 27 militants and 22 civilians, as well as three unidentified persons, had been killed, based mostly on witness interviews. Israeli losses totalled 23 soldiers killed and 75 wounded.

===Nablus===


The IDF launched an incursion into Nablus with two regular infantry brigades and one reserve armored brigade. The city was estimated to have held over 8,000 Palestinian militants, in addition to Palestinian security forces. Israeli forces quickly occupied most of the city. Clashes took place around refugee camps, and Israeli attack helicopters fired rockets at Palestinian positions in the main square and neighboring streets. The main attack focused on the Nablus Casbah. The Golani Brigade entered the Casbah, engaging the Palestinians in heavy street combat and using armored bulldozers and Achzarit APCs to clear away barricades. Many militants withdrew to the western part of the city, where they were attacked by the Paratroopers Brigade. Troops gradually moved into the city by destroying walls within houses to get into the next house (known as mouse-holing/Rhizome Manoeuvre), in order to avoid booby-trapped doors and road-side bombs. The paratroopers advanced by sending several small units to take over houses at the same time and confuse the Palestinians, and relied heavily on sniper units. Palestinian militants often exposed their positions by firing at Israeli forces in another direction. During the battle over 70 Palestinian militants were killed, while the IDF lost one officer to friendly fire. The Palestinians surrendered on April 8.

Nablus was placed under curfew on April 4, as the battle was beginning. The city remained under curfew until April 22. During the operation, the IDF arrested over 100 Palestinians and discovered several explosives laboratories. High-ranking wanted persons fled east to Tubas, and were arrested a week later.

===Bethlehem===

IDF forces including the Jerusalemite Reserve Infantry Brigade entered Jerusalem with infantry, warplanes, and tanks while a special forces Shaldag Unit targeted the Church of the Nativity to deny it to the people of Bethlehem as a place of refuge as it had been in the past. In response to the IDF offensive hundreds of Bethelemites including Bethlehem&#x27;s Governor sought refuge in the church, the helicopters of the Shaldag unit arriving half an hour too late.

On April 3 the IDF laid siege to the church surrounding it with an elite paratrooper brigade specializing in sniper operations who used tactics including carrying out simulated attacks. The Vatican&#x27;s top foreign policy expert Archbishop Jean-Louis Taura stated that while the Palestinians have joined the Vatican in bilateral agreements where they have undertaken to respect and maintain the status quo regarding Christian holy places and the rights of Christian communities, &quot;to explain the gravity of the current situation, let me begin with the fact that the occupation of the holy places by armed men is a violation of a long tradition of law that dates back to the Ottoman era. Never before have they been occupied – for such a lengthy time – by armed men.&quot; For five weeks the Israelis held the city and church under curfew, with periodic breaks, continuing the siege on the church. Israeli snipers were given orders to shoot anyone in the church carrying a gun on sight, seriously wounding an Armenian monk who the IDF said looked armed, and killing the mentally impaired church bell-ringer who was shot as he left to ring the bells as he had done for three decades. He was left to die, bleeding in the square for hours. Six other men were killed by the IDF during the siege. On March 10 the siege ended, with a deal seeing some militants deported to the Gaza Strip, and the rest exiled to Cyprus.

===Ramallah===
IDF infantry and armor entered Ramallah on March 29 and entered the Mukataa, Yasser Arafat&#x27;s presidential compound. The Israelis forced their way through the compound&#x27;s perimeter and quickly occupied it. Arafat was given refuge in a few of the compound&#x27;s rooms, along with assorted advisors, security personnel and journalists. In an effort to isolate Arafat physically and diplomatically, access to the compound was restricted, and Arafat was not allowed to leave. The IDF occupied the city after several hours of street fighting in which some 30 Palestinians were killed. Ramallah was then placed under a tight curfew as soldiers conducted searches and made arrests. The IDF arrested more than 700 people, among them Marwan Barghouti, a top Palestinian militant leader suspected of directing numerous suicide bombings and other attacks against Israelis. Barghouti was later tried in Israel and sentenced to life imprisonment. The day after Marwan Barghouti&#x27;s arrest, Taleb Barghouti was arrested.

On April 2, Israeli tanks and APCs surrounded the headquarters of the Preventive Security Force in nearby Beitunia as Israeli helicopter gunships flew overhead. Hundreds of heavily armed police officers and prisoners wanted by Israel were inside. Israeli troops used loudspeakers to announce that the compound&#x27;s four buildings were to be destroyed and demand that everyone inside step out. Hundreds of police officers and fugitives emerged from the compound and surrendered to the Israeli army, and the facility was damaged by rockets. The Israelis extensively searched the facility and uncovered numerous incriminating documents, including a plan to recruit female Israeli soldiers as spies. Weapons stolen from the IDF were also discovered.

The Israelis forced the hundreds of policemen and fugitives who surrendered to strip naked, fearing that some were armed or packed with explosives. They were then given jumpsuits, loaded onto buses and taken to Ofer Prison. Shin Bet asked Jibril Rajoub, head of the Preventive Security Force, to point out which men were police officers and which were fugitives. Rajoub instead identified his policemen as fugitives and the fugitives as policemen, and the fugitives were all released. Shin Bet retaliated by releasing an official account that branded Rajoub as a traitor for turning over the fugitives in a CIA-brokered deal, costing Rajoub his job.

The UN report on the subject noted: &quot;It was not only the Palestinian people whose movement was restricted during Operation Defensive Shield. In many instances, humanitarian workers were not able to reach people in need to assess conditions and deliver necessary assistance because of the sealing of cities, refugee camps and villages during the operation. There were also cases of Israeli forces not respecting the neutrality of medical and humanitarian workers and attacking ambulances.&quot;

In reply to these complaints, the IDF stated that the curfew was placed in order to prevent civilians from being caught in gunfights and getting hurt. Palestinian ambulances were stopped for checks following the discovery of an explosive belt in a Red Crescent ambulance.

===Tulkarm===
IDF Reserve Paratroop Battalion 55 entered Tulkarm with armored support. Palestinian militants abandoned their weapons and melted into the local population, and nine were killed by the IDF. A Tegart fort that had served as their headquarters was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike. The IDF also raided nearby villages, arresting hundreds of wanted men.

===Hebron===
On April 4, gendarmes from an Israel Border Police undercover unit surrounded a house in Hebron where a member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades who supplied weapons to militants was holed up, along with his brother. The gendarmes demanded that the two men surrender. Shots were fired at the troops, killing one of the gendarmes. After a gun battle lasting several hours, troops stormed the house, discovering the suspect&#x27;s wounded brother. The arms merchant was found to have fled.

===European Union reaction===
Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Piqué, whose country held the EU Presidency, said that &quot;sanctions against Israel are a possible scenario&quot;, and that EU states were discussing the possibility, with some reluctant and others wanting to impose sanctions. Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel also said that the EU could rethink its trade relations with Israel. The European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution calling for economic sanctions on Israel, an arms embargo on both parties, and for the European Union to &quot;suspend immediately&quot; its trade and cooperation agreement with Israel. It condemned the &quot;military escalation pursued by the Sharon government&quot; and the &quot;oppression of the Palestinian civilian population by the Israeli army&quot;, while also condemning suicide bombings. According to Yediot Aharonot, Israel&#x27;s refusal to allow Spanish EU officials Javier Solana and Josep Piqué into the Mukataa to meet with Yasser Arafat, while allowing American envoy Anthony Zinni to enter, was the &quot;straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back&quot;. The resolution was passed by a vote of 269 to 208, with 22 abstentions.

== Casualties ==
During the fighting, 497 Palestinians were killed and 1,447 were wounded, according to a United Nations investigation, while 30 Israeli soldiers were killed and 127 were wounded. However, the human rights group B&#x27;Tselem only registered 240 Palestinians killed by Israeli security forces in the West Bank during the period in which the operation took place. Approximately 7,000 Palestinians were detained by Israel including 396 wanted suspects.

The World Bank estimated that over $361 million worth of damage was caused to Palestinian infrastructure and institutions, $158 million of which came from the aerial bombardment and destruction of houses in Nablus and Jenin.

== Strategic outcome ==

The effects of Operation Defensive Shield, as recorded by the Israeli Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, were an initial drop in half (46 percent) in the number of suicide bombingsfrom 22 in February–March to 12 in April–Mayand a 70 percent drop in executed attacks between the first half of 2002 and the second half (43 January–June, 13 July–December). While 2003 had a total of 25 executed suicide bombings in comparison to 56 in 2002, the main difference was the number of attacks which did not come to realization (184) either due to Israeli interception or problems in the execution. 2003 also saw a 35 percent drop in the number of fatalities from 220 deaths in 2002 to 142 deaths resulting from suicide bombings.

Beverly Milton-Edwards, Professor of Politics at Queen&#x27;s University in Belfast, writes that while aspects of Palestinian terrorism were reduced after the operation, Israel&#x27;s objective of ending the Al-Aqsa Intifada remained unmet. Israeli destruction of institutions belonging to the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the &quot;emasculation&quot; of the PA and its President, Yasser Arafat, opened a vacuum in the social and welfare system that was rapidly filled by the Hamas, whose popularity grew. Milton-Edwards concludes that, &quot;The unequivocal victory [sought by Israel] eventually remained elusive and the Israelis and Palestinians resumed a variety of forms of low intensity warfare with each other.&quot;

== Fact-finding and criticism ==

===UN fact-finding mission===
A UN fact-finding mission was established under UN Security Council Resolution 1405 (April 19, 2002) into Operation Defensive Shield following Palestinian charges that a massacre had occurred in Jenin, which later proved to be false. In its attachment to the UN report the Palestinian Authority decried Israel&#x27;s &quot;culture of impunity&quot; and called for &quot;an international presence to monitor compliance with international humanitarian law, to help in providing protection to Palestinian civilians and to help the parties to implement agreements reached.&quot;

A report of the European Union attached in the report stated, &quot;The massive destruction, especially at the centre of the refugee camp, to which all heads of mission in Jerusalem and Ramallah can testify, shows that the site had undergone an indiscriminate use of force, that goes well beyond that of a battlefield.&quot;

The report states that there were numerous reports of the IDF using Palestinians as human shields. Israel denied the allegations.

===Human rights groups===
Human Rights Watch determined that &quot;Israeli forces committed serious violations of international humanitarian law, some amounting prima facie to war crimes.&quot;

Amnesty International reported that war crimes occurred in the Jenin refugee camp and in Nablus, including: unlawful killings; a failure to ensure medical or humanitarian relief; demolition of houses and property occurred (sometime with civilians still inside); water and electricity supplies to civilians were cut; torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in arbitrary detention occurred; and Palestinians civilians were used for military operations or as &quot;human shields.&quot; According to Amnesty, &quot;the IDF acted as though the main aim was to punish all Palestinians.&quot;

===Destruction of infrastructure and property ===
Scholars have noted &quot;the Israeli military systematically destroy[ing] West Bank infrastructure, including roads, water-treatment and power-generating plants, and telecommunications facilities, as well as official database and documents&quot; during the Operation. 

==== Destruction of Palestinian Authority property ====
The UN report noted that &quot;United Nations agencies and other international agencies, when allowed into Ramallah and other Palestinian cities, documented extensive physical damage to Palestinian Authority civilian property. That damage included the destruction of office equipment, such as computers and photocopying machines, that did not appear to be related to military objectives. While denying that such destruction was systematic, the Israeli Defence Forces have admitted that their personnel engaged in some acts of vandalism, and are carrying out some related prosecutions.&quot;

Cheryl Rubenberg writes that data and records held by Palestinian civilian institutions were systematically destroyed by the IDF; among the institutions affected were the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s Ministries of Culture, Education and Health, and the Palestine International Bank.

Amira Hass, an Israeli reporter for &quot;Haaretz&quot;, criticized the IDF for targeting computer files and printed records, dubbing the offensive &quot;Operation Destroy the Data&quot;. She wrote that &quot;this was not a mission to search and destroy the terrorist infrastructure. ... There was a decision made to vandalize the civic, administrative, cultural infrastructure developed by Palestinian society&quot;.

==== Destruction of non-governmental property ====
Large-scale destruction was reported of properties of NGOs, media, universities, cultural centers, and other institutions. Complete libraries and archives, including video and music archives, as well as equipment were looted, vandalized and destroyed. Also demolition of shops and a religious compound were reported.

===Jenin massacre allegations===
A great deal of the media attention to Operation Defensive Shield centered around Palestinians claims of a large-scale massacre in Jenin. Palestinian cabinet minister Saeb Erekat was widely quoted by the press as saying there were 500 massacred Palestinians in the Israeli assault on Jenin.

Human Rights Watch found no evidence to sustain claims of massacres or large-scale extrajudicial executions by the IDF in Jenin refugee camp. However, many of the civilian deaths documented amounted to unlawful or willful killings by the IDF according to Human Rights Watch. Many others could have been avoided if the IDF had taken proper precautions to protect civilian life during its military operation, as required by international humanitarian law. Among the civilian deaths were those of Kamal Zgheir, a 57-year-old man who was shot and run over by a tank on a major road outside the camp on April 10, even though he had a white flag attached to his wheelchair; 58-year-old Mariam Wishahi, killed by a missile in her home on April 6 just hours after her unarmed son was shot in the street; Jamal Fayid, a 37-year-old paralyzed man who was crushed in the rubble of his home on April 7 despite his family&#x27;s pleas to be allowed to remove him; and fourteen-year-old Faris Zaiban, who was killed by fire from an IDF armored car as he went to buy groceries when the IDF-imposed curfew was temporarily lifted on April 11. Human Rights Watch stated that of at least 52 Palestinians were killed, at least 27 were suspected to have been armed Palestinian militants.

Multiple deaths were also caused by refusal (whether enforced by militia groups or voluntary is disputed) of Palestinian families to leave their houses, of which specific bulldozers, clearing the way for operations, were not alerted of on a house-to-house basis (See Israel–Gaza war 2008–2009 for similar issues; where IDF warnings were continually issued that specific houses carrying munitions were to be targeted, with Hamas response of forcing families to remain inside their houses.)

Initially Israel welcomed an investigation, announcing that it would cooperate fully with the Secretary General&#x27;s fact-finding effort. According to the United Jewish Communities, Israel made a number of points regarding the team&#x27;s methodology, in order to &quot;safeguard the impartiality of its work.&quot; However, Israeli government receptivity to cooperating with the UN fact-finding mission decreased when the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, did not appoint a predominantly technical team with specialized military and forensic expertise, but rather political-administrative figures without such specialized skills (including Cornelio Sommaruga, controversial for previous &quot;Red Swastika&quot; remarks), and after Palestinian officials reduced the casualty toll in Jenin on May 1, 2002 to be between 50 and 60 deaths while Israel maintained there were only seven or eight civilian casualties. The charges of a massacre which had sparked demands for a U.N. investigation, had now been dropped. Kofi Annan disbanded the UN fact-finding team in Jenin supposed to determine whether a massacre had taken place with the comment that &quot;[c]learly the full cooperation of both sides was a precondition for this, as was a visit to the area itself to see the Jenin refugee camp at first hand and to gather information. This is why the Secretariat engaged in a thorough clarification process with the Israeli delegation.&quot;

In 2002, Mohammed Bakri, a prominent Arab actor and Israeli citizen, directed and produced a documentary &quot;Jenin, Jenin&quot;, to portray &quot;the Palestinian truth&quot; about the Battle of Jenin. In the documentary Bakri propagates that indeed a massacre of civilians occurred in Jenin. A French Jewish film maker, Pierre Rehov, also directed a documentary on what happened in Jenin during Defensive Shield. His film, &quot;The Road to Jenin&quot;, was produced to counter the claims of a massacre, and to counter the narrative of Mohammed Bakri. CAMERA made a review of the two documentary films. According to the review, Bakri has admitted to shortening his film by 25 min in the wake of criticism.

====Reported first-hand allegations====
David Rohde of &quot;The New York Times&quot; on the April 16 reported:
Stewart Bell of the &quot;National Post&quot; on the April 15 reported that Ahmed Tibi, an Arab member of the Israeli Knesset, said he had met hundreds of Palestinians displaced by what he termed the &quot;massacre&quot; in Jenin. According to Tibi, &quot;Everyone has a tragedy, about executions they saw, about their whole family that was killed, about the most tangible concern—where is my family?&quot; Bell reported that Jenin&#x27;s population recounted &quot;vivid accounts&quot; of fighting and homes being demolished but first-hand accounts of massacres was scarce. One such rumor was a grocery store owner near Jenin who spoke of seeing Israeli troops using a refrigerated truck to hold the bodies of massacred Palestinians, which he said was still parked on a nearby hill. He refused to elaborate out of fear from &quot;collaborators.&quot; Bell reported that a National Post reporter inspected the truck and found that it contained apples and other food for the Israeli soldiers.

<text>&quot;In vitro&quot; [[toxicology testing|toxicity testing]] is the scientific analysis of the toxic effects of chemical substances on cultured bacteria or mammalian cells. &quot;In vitro&quot; (literally &#x27;in glass&#x27;) testing methods are employed primarily to identify potentially hazardous chemicals and/or to confirm the lack of certain toxic properties in the early stages of the development of potentially useful new substances such as therapeutic drugs, agricultural chemicals and food additives.

&quot;In vitro&quot; assays for xenobiotic toxicity are recently carefully considered by key government agencies (e.g., EPA; NIEHS/NTP; FDA), to better assess human risks. There are substantial activities in using in vitro systems to advance mechanistic understanding of toxicant activities, and the use of human cells and tissue to define human-specific toxic effects.

==Improvement over animal testing==
Most toxicologists believe that &quot;in vitro&quot; toxicity testing methods can be more useful, more time and cost-effective than toxicology studies in living animals (which are termed &quot;in vivo&quot; or &quot;in life&quot; methods). However, the extrapolation from &quot;in vitro&quot; to &quot;in vivo&quot; requires some careful consideration and is an active research area.

Due to regulatory constraints and ethical considerations, the quest for alternatives to animal testing has gained a new momentum. In many cases the in vitro tests are better than animal tests because they can be used to develop safer products.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency studied 1,065 chemical and drug substances in their ToxCast program (part of the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard) using &quot;in silica&quot; modelling and a human pluripotent stem cell-based assay to predict &quot;in vivo&quot; developmental intoxicants based on changes in cellular metabolism following chemical exposure. Major findings from the analysis of this ToxCast_STM dataset published in 2020 include: (1) 19% of 1065 chemicals yielded a prediction of developmental toxicity, (2) assay performance reached 79%–82% accuracy with high specificity (&gt; 84%) but modest sensitivity (&lt; 67%) when compared with &quot;in vivo&quot; animal models of human prenatal developmental toxicity, (3) sensitivity improved as more stringent weights of evidence requirements were applied to the animal studies, and (4) statistical analysis of the most potent chemical hits on specific biochemical targets in ToxCast revealed positive and negative associations with the STM response, providing insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of the targeted endpoint and its biological domain.

==Examples of cell viability and other cytotoxicity assays used for &quot;in-vitro&quot; toxicology==
Many methods of analysis exist for assaying test substances for cytotoxicity and other cellular responses.

===Hemolysis assay===
The hemolysis assay examines the propensity of chemicals, drugs or medication, or any blood-contacting medical device or material to lyse red blood cells (erythrocytes). The lysis is easily detected due to the release of hemoglobin.

===MTT and MTS===
MTT assay is used often in determining cell viability and has been validated for use by international organisations. MTT assay involves two steps of introducing the assay to the chemicals and then a solubilisation step.

The colorimetric MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium) in vitro assay is an updated version of the validated MTT method, MTS assay has the advantage of being soluble. Hence, no solubilisation step is required.

===ATP===
ATP assay has the main advantage of providing results quickly (within 15 minutes) and only requires fewer sample cells. The assay performs lysis on the cells and the following chemical reaction between the assay and ATP content of cells produces luminescence. The amount of luminescence is then measured by a photometer and can be translated into number cells alive since
*ATP assay assumes alive cells still have ATP inside them, and
*Luminescence level recorded is proportional to the ATP content in the sample cells.

===Neutral red===
Another cell viability endpoint can be neutral red (NR) uptake. Neutral red, a weak cationic dye penetrates cellular membranes by non-diffusion and accumulates intercellularly in lysosomes. Viable cells take up the NR dye, damaged or dead cells do not.

===Cytokine quantification via ELISA===
ELISA kits can be used to examine up and down regulation of proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines (IL-1, TNF alpha, PGE2)...

Measurement of these types of cellular responses can be windows into the interaction of the test article on the test models (monolayer cell cultures, 3D tissue models, tissue explants).

== Types of &quot;in vitro&quot; studies ==
Broadly speaking, there are two different types of &quot;in vitro&quot; studies depending on the type system developed to perform the experiment. The two types of systems generally used are : a) Static well plate system and b) the multi-compartmental perfused systems.

=== Static well plate system ===
The static well plate or layer systems are the most traditional and simplest form of assays widely used for in vitro study. These assays are quite beneficial as they are quite simple and provide a very accessible testing environment for monitoring chemicals in the culture medium as well as in the cell. However the disadvantage of using these simple static well plate assays is that, they cannot represent the cellular interactions and physiologic fluid flow conditions taking place inside the body.

=== Multi-compartmental perfused systems ===
New testing platforms are now developed to solve problems related to cellular interactions. These new platforms are much more complex based on multi-compartmental perfused systems. 
The main objective of these systems is to reproduce in vivo mechanisms more reliably by providing cell culture environment close to the in vivo situation. Each compartment in the system represent a specific organ of the living organism and thus each compartment has a specific characteristics and criteria. Each compartment in these systems are connected by tubes and pumps through which the fluid flows thus mimicking the blood flow in the in vivo situation. The draw back behind the use of these perfused systems is that, the adverse effects ( influence of both the biological and non-biological components of the system on the fate of the chemical under study) are more compared to the static systems. In order to reduce the effect of non-biological components of the system, all the compartments are made of glass and the connecting tubes are made up of teflon. A number of kinetic models have been proposed to take care of these non-specific bindings taking place in these in vitro systems.

To improve the biological difficulties arising from the use of different culture in vitro conditions, the traditional models used in flasks or micro-well plates has to be modified. With parallel development in micro-technologies and tissue engineering, these problems are solved using new pertinent tools called &quot;micro-fluidic biochips&quot;.

<text>The University of Zurich (UZH, ) is a public research university in Zurich, Switzerland. It is the largest university in Switzerland, with its 28,000 enrolled students. It was founded in 1833 from the existing colleges of theology, law, medicine which go back to 1525, and a new faculty of philosophy.

Currently, the university has seven faculties: Philosophy, Human Medicine, Economic Sciences, Law, Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Theology and Veterinary Medicine. The university offers the widest range of subjects and courses of any Swiss higher education institution.

==History==

The University of Zurich was founded on April 29, 1833, when the existing colleges of theology, the &quot;Carolinum&quot; founded by Huldrych Zwingli in 1525, law and medicine were merged with a new faculty of Philosophy. It was the first university in Europe to be founded by the state rather than a monarch or church. Its latin name is reminiscent of the roman name for the precursor settlement of the city of Zurich, Turicum.
In the university&#x27;s early years, the 1839 appointment of the German theologian David Friedrich Strauss to its Chair of Theology caused a major controversy, since Strauss argued that the miracles in the Christian New Testament were mythical retellings of normal events as supernatural happenings. Eventually, the authorities offered Strauss a pension before he had a chance to start his duties.

The university allowed women to attend philosophy lectures from 1847. The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was added in 1901, the second-oldest such faculty in the world. In 1914, the university moved to new premises designed by the architect Karl Moser on Rämistrasse 71.

The university admitted a Russian woman student, Maria Kniazhnina, to audit medicine classes in 1864, but she did not complete the course. Another Russian student, Nadezhda Suslova, audited medicine classes from 1865 and was allowed to become a registered student and graduate as a doctor of medicine in 1867. The first seven women who were awarded medical degrees at the university were known as the Zurich Seven. Including Suslova, they were:
*Nadezhda Suslova (Russia)
*Frances Elizabeth Morgan (England)
*Louisa Atkins (England)
*Maria Bokova (Russia)
*Eliza Walker (Scotland)
*Susan Dimock (United States)
*Marie Vögtlin (Switzerland)

==Campus==
The university is scattered all over the city of Zurich. The main campuses are located in the city centre, Irchelpark and Oerlikon. Members of the university can use several libraries, including the ETH-library, and the Zurich Central Library, with over 5 million volumes.
In 1962, the faculty of science proposed to establish the Irchelpark campus on the &quot;Strickhofareal&quot;. The first stage the construction of the university buildings was begun in 1973, and the campus was inaugurated in 1979. The construction of the second stage lasted from 1978 to 1983. The campus also houses the anthropological museum &quot;Anthropologisches Museum&quot;, and the cantonal Staatsarchiv Zürich.

===Museums===
The Institute and Museum for the History of Medicine is part of the university. The university includes 13 museums: the Anatomical Collection, the Archaeological Collection, the Botanical Museum, the Museum of Wax Moulages, the Science Exploratorium, the Museum of Veterinary History, the Zurich Herbaria, the Museum of Anthropology, the Botanical Garden, the Ethnographic Museum, the Paleontological Museum, the Veterinary Anatomy Collection and the Zoological Museum.

==Academics==

In the fields of bioscience and finance, there is a close-knit collaboration between the University of Zurich and the ETH (Federal Institute for Technology). Examples for common initiatives between the two institutions include University Medicine Zurich, the Wyss Translational Center Zurich and Life Science Zurich.

===Rankings===

* Shanghai Jiao Tong University Ranking (heavy emphasis on research output – citations, Nobel prizes etc.) Ranked 59th overall as well as 5th and 10th in the subdisclipines Ecology an Human Biological Sciences respectively. 
* QS World University Rankings (heavy emphasis on peer review) 91st overall and 56th in Medicine globally making it the highest ranked University in Switzerland for Medicine according to QS.
* THE World University Rankings 2024 80th overall and ranked 42nd in the subdiscipline business &amp; economics.

The university&#x27;s Department of Economics is especially strong and was ranked first in the German-speaking area by the Handelsblatt in 2017. In 2009, the faculty of Business Administration was ranked third in the German-speaking area.

===Language policy===

Bachelor courses are taught in Swiss Standard German (&quot;Hochdeutsch&quot;), but use of English is increasing in many faculties. The only bachelors program taught entirely in English is the &quot;English Language and Literature&quot; program. All Master courses at the Faculty of Science are held in English. Master courses in Economics and Finance are mainly held in English, while the Master of Science in Quantitative Finance is held completely in English.

==Student life==
The university&#x27;s Academic Sports Association (ASVZ) offers a wide range of sports facilities to students of the university. The student body is represented through the Verband der Studierenden der Universität Zürich VSUZH which organizes events and is involved in the university administration.

<doc id="314805" wikidata="Q599749" url="?curid=314805" title="White-rumped sandpiper">
<text>The white-rumped sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis) is a small shorebird that breeds in the northern tundra of Canada and Alaska. This bird can be difficult to distinguish from other similar tiny shorebirds; these are known collectively as &quot;peeps&quot; or &quot;stints&quot;.

These birds are not often spotted. In the summer, they are rarely seen because they are in such an obscure breeding location. Similarly, in the winter they are rarely seen because they travel too far south for many birdwatchers. Therefore, the majority of sightings occur during the spring or fall in temperate regions and are generally in small numbers around water.

==Taxonomy==
The white-rumped sandpiper is placed in the order Charadriiformes along with gulls, alcids, plovers and oystercatchers. Its family, Scolopacidae, encompasses all sandpipers, and as a stint it is classified in the genus Calidris. It is classified as monotypic species, meaning that no population differentiation or subspecies have been described.

The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific &quot;fuscicollis&quot; is from Latin &quot;fuscus&quot;, &quot;dusky&quot; and Neo-Latin &quot;collis&quot;, &quot;necked &quot;.

==Description==
The white-rumped sandpiper is a relatively small bird measuring only . The top of its body is a dull grey-brown color and it has a white eye stripe. Its beak is of medium length, thin and dark, and its legs are very dark. This bird is often mistaken with many similar-looking sandpipers that live in its range or along its migration path.

The plumage is much less distinct during the winter; however, during all seasons males and females remain similar in their appearance. In adult alternate plumage, the crown and face have a brownish tinge. The supercilium is pale, there are black feathers on the back and there are grey edges on the wing coverts. The breast and flanks are streaked and the underparts are white. In adult basic plumage, the upperparts are a dark grey and at the centers there are black feathers. The underparts are white but the breast is dark grey. The supercilium is white, while the crown and eyeline are darker. The juvenile plumage features black-based feathers on the back and wing coverts. These have brown edges towards the scapulars and whiter edges towards the wing coverts. The breast is finely streaked and there is a white &quot;V&quot; on its back. The underparts and supercilium are white, the crown is brownish in color, and the face is pale

===Identification===

The two primary features used to identify this bird in the field are its long wings and its white rump. The white patch on the rump can be seen while the bird is in flight. Its long wings extend beyond the tail by about a quarter inch. Baird&#x27;s sandpiper also shows this trait but can be distinguished by the lack of a white rump. There is also a thin white stripe on the wing and a row of marks on the flanks below the wings.

==Habitat and distribution==
The white-rumped sandpiper inhabits relatively vegetated patches of the tundra. More specifically, they live in the marshy, heavily vegetated, hummocky arctic tundra of Alaska and Canada during the breeding season. They can be found in various types of wetlands while migrating. During the winter months they inhabit a variety of freshwater and saltwater habitats such as lagoons, estuaries and marshes. In general, they tend to avoid sandy beaches and fast moving water.

===Migration===
They are a long-distance migrant, wintering in southern South America and the Caribbean. They are considered one of the most extreme long-distance migrants in the world, traversing the entire continent of North America in the span of one month.

The white-rumped sandpiper is a nearctic migrant. After breeding in northern Canada and Alaska, it flies over the Atlantic Ocean to spend the majority of its non-breeding period in South America, particularly along the Patagonian coast in both Chile and Argentina. It also frequently visits Fracasso Beach, Argentina. Many shorebirds concentrate in this area due to the abundance of intertidal invertebrates, especially clams. The white-rumped sandpiper has also been spotted in Venezuela, Suriname, Brazil and Paraguay during its migration. They are rare but regular vagrants to western Europe and a rare vagrant to Australia.

The birds migrate with both nonstop and short-distance multiple-stop flights. During their migration from north to south, they fly over the Atlantic Ocean, gradually moving along the northeastern coast of South America before heading inland towards the islands. This travel generally takes about one month. On their migration from south to north, the white-rumped sandpiper follows a similar path, but does it much more quickly. This migration is done in a fast series of long flights without stopping. One nonstop flight can be as long as .

Weather patterns play a crucial role in determining the migration route. Birds like to travel so that the temperature, pressure and humidity work with the tailwinds. Strong winds can blow birds off of their regular migration route. For example, the effects of a large storm lead to a higher presence of the white-rumped sandpiper on the King George Islands.

===Effects of climate change===
The warming of the climate has led to changes in the number of individuals and the length of their stay in the South Shetland Islands. White-rumped sandpipers are now observed more frequently in this area as a result of both long and short term climate variations. The higher air temperatures, which occur as a result of the northern winds, bring warm, moist air which creates more open habitats and better food resources that allow these birds to persist and survive. Migration routes, as well as both winter and summer foraging grounds, may also be altered.

==Behavior==
===Vocalizations===
One of the white-rumped sandpiper vocalizations consists of a repeating &quot;pip, pip, pip …&quot; Their call has a distinctive metallic &quot;tzeep&quot; note which makes them easily identifiable among a flock of shorebirds. It resembles the sound of two pebbles scraping against one another.

===Diet===
Their diet consists primarily of small invertebrates including: molluscs, crustaceans, polychaetes, annelids and both adult and larval insects. They are mainly reported to eat aquatic invertebrates. Although it was previously thought they only consumed invertebrates, it has been shown that seeds and moss also make up a portion of the white-rumped sandpiper diet. This discovery lead to the idea that they might be opportunistic feeders depending on time, season and habitat. Stones and algae have also been found in their stomachs but these are most likely ingested by accident. The stones are of the same general shape and size as the seeds so it could be a case of mistaken identity. Algae could also be accidentally ingested through aquatic feeding.

While on mudflats, the white-rumped sandpiper forages by probing in shallow waters and in mud but can also pick up some items from the surface. When they are in the tundra, they must probe deeply in the moss and other vegetation.

===Nesting===
The females build the nest which is a cup-shaped depression in the ground. The nest is lined with pieces of lichen, leaves and moss which can occur naturally or can be added by the female. The nests are generally well hidden in a clump of moss or grass. Males defend the breeding territory by gliding and fluttering above it while making oinking and rattling sounds. When on the ground, the male stretches its wing out to the side and raises its tail into the air to display the white patch on its rump. He then walks and runs while repeating a call.

===Reproduction===

As with most shorebirds, the courtship behavior of the white-rumped sandpiper involves an aerial component. During courtship the male and the female fly upward side by side at an angle. At about above the ground they stop about apart and hover with shallow, rapidly vibrating wingbeats. The male remains above the female and repeatedly releases a series of &quot;poing-zee&quot; notes. They hover between 5 and 10 seconds before descending to the ground slowly and silently and land about apart. During their downward glide their wings are held together in a &quot;V&quot; position above their backs. A few minutes later they initiate a second paired flight identical to the first one. However, once they have landed on the ground the male begins to chase the female. The chase ends when the male does a wing raising display, which is common in many sandpiper species.
The females are small and nest in the high arctic, which means they are more likely under a higher cold stress than birds nesting in temperate areas. Consequently, the females spend an average of 82.5% of their time incubating their eggs. In total, the females incubate the eggs for about 22 days. She generally lays 4 olive to green eggs; laying 3 eggs is rare. The eggs can sometimes be blotched with brown, olive-brown or grey spots.

Only the females incubate the eggs. Once the female has laid the eggs, the male stops displaying and leaves the breeding grounds. This is unlike other members of the calidris genus where incubation is shared between males and females; therefore, the trait of male incubation has been independently lost in this species. There are only three documented species who have been known to share this behaviour. This development seems bizarre since experiments have shown that a decrease in the amount of male care is linked to a decrease in male fitness by lowering the number of male descendants that survive. One explanation for this evolution is that a decrease in male care allows the males to explore other breeding options. This hypothesis ties in with the fact that the white-rumped sandpiper is polygynous; males will mate with several females but females will only mate with one male.

Hybrids between this species and the dunlin are occasionally found in northeastern North America. The white-rumped sandpiper is also suspected to hybridize with the buff-breasted sandpiper.

===Early development===
The young are covered in down feathers and leave the nest about a day after hatching. The female will tend to them by brooding them and keeping them warm, but they must find all their own food. Their first flight is at the age of about 16–17 days and soon after that they become independent.

<doc id="314809" wikidata="Q342720" url="?curid=314809" title="George Chapman">
<text>George Chapman ( – 12 May 1634) was an English dramatist, translator and poet. He was a classical scholar whose work shows the influence of Stoicism. William Minto speculated that Chapman is the unnamed Rival Poet of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets. Chapman is seen as an anticipator of the metaphysical poets of the 17th century. He is best remembered for his translations of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and the Homeric &quot;Batrachomyomachia&quot;.

==Life and work==
Chapman was born at Hitchin in Hertfordshire. There is conjecture that he studied at Oxford but did not take a degree, though no reliable evidence affirms this. Very little is known about Chapman&#x27;s early life, but Mark Eccles uncovered records that reveal much about Chapman&#x27;s difficulties and expectations. In 1585 Chapman was approached in a friendly fashion by John Wolfall Sr., who offered to supply a bond of surety for a loan to furnish Chapman money &quot;for his proper use in Attendance upon the then Right Honorable Sir Rafe Sadler Knight.&quot; Chapman&#x27;s courtly ambitions led him into a trap. He apparently never received any money, but he would be plagued for many years by the papers he had signed. Wolfall had the poet arrested for debt in 1600, and when in 1608 Wolfall&#x27;s son, having inherited his father&#x27;s papers, sued yet again, Chapman&#x27;s only resort was to petition the Court of Chancery for equity. As Sadler died in 1587, this gives Chapman little time to have trained under him. 

Chapman spent the early 1590s abroad, and saw military action in the Low Countries fighting under renowned English general Sir Francis Vere. His earliest published works were the obscure philosophical poems &quot;The Shadow of Night&quot; (1594) and &quot;Ovid&#x27;s Banquet of Sense&quot; (1595). The latter has been taken as a response to the erotic poems of the age, such as Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Astrophil and Stella&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;.

Chapman&#x27;s life was troubled by debt and his inability to find a patron whose fortunes did not decline: Robert Devereux, Second Earl of Essex, and the Prince of Wales, Prince Henry both met their ends prematurely. The former was executed for treason by Elizabeth I in 1601, and the latter died of typhoid fever at the age of eighteen in 1612. Chapman&#x27;s resultant poverty did not diminish his ability or his standing among his fellow Elizabethan poets and dramatists.

Chapman died in London, having lived his latter years in poverty and debt. He was buried at St Giles in the Fields. A monument to him designed by Inigo Jones marked his tomb, and stands today inside the church.

===Comedies===
By the end of the 1590s, Chapman had become a successful playwright, working for Philip Henslowe and later for the Children of the Chapel. Among his comedies are &quot;The Blind Beggar of Alexandria&quot; (1596; printed 1598), &quot;An Humorous Day&#x27;s Mirth&quot; (1597; printed 1599), &quot;All Fools&quot; (printed 1605), &quot;Monsieur D&#x27;Olive&quot; (1605; printed 1606), &quot;The Gentleman Usher&quot; (printed 1606), &quot;May Day&quot; (printed 1611), and &quot;The Widow&#x27;s Tears&quot; (printed 1612). His plays show a willingness to experiment with dramatic form: &quot;An Humorous Day&#x27;s Mirth&quot; was one of the first plays to be written in the style of &quot;humours comedy&quot; which Ben Jonson later used in &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot; and &quot;Every Man Out of His Humour&quot;. With &quot;The Widow&#x27;s Tears&quot;, he was also one of the first writers to meld comedy with more serious themes, creating the tragicomedy later made famous by Beaumont and Fletcher.

He also wrote one noteworthy play in collaboration. &quot;Eastward Ho&quot; (1605), written with Jonson and John Marston, contained satirical references to the Scottish courtiers who formed the retinue of the new king James I; this landed Chapman and Jonson in jail at the suit of Sir James Murray of Cockpool, the king&#x27;s &quot;rascal[ly]&quot; Groom of the Stool. Various of their letters to the king and noblemen survive in a manuscript in the Folger Library known as the &quot;Dobell MS&quot;, and published by AR Braunmuller as &quot;A Seventeenth Century Letterbook&quot;. In the letters, both men renounced the offending line, implying that Marston was responsible for the injurious remark. Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Conversations With Drummond&quot; refers to the imprisonment, and suggests there was a possibility that both authors would have their &quot;ears and noses slit&quot; as a punishment, but this may have been Jonson elaborating on the story in retrospect.

Chapman&#x27;s friendship with Jonson broke down, perhaps as a result of Jonson&#x27;s public feud with Inigo Jones. Some satiric, scathing lines, written sometime after the burning of Jonson&#x27;s desk and papers, provide evidence of the rift. The poem lampooning Jonson&#x27;s aggressive behaviour and self-believed superiority remained unpublished during Chapman&#x27;s lifetime; it was found in documents collected after his death.

===Tragedies===
Chapman&#x27;s greatest tragedies took their subject matter from recent French history. These include &quot;Bussy D&#x27;Ambois&quot; (1607), &quot;The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron&quot; (1608), &quot;The Revenge of Bussy D&#x27;Ambois&quot; (1610) and &quot;The Tragedy of Chabot, Admiral of France&quot; (published 1639). The two &quot;Byron&quot; plays were banned from the stage—although, when the Court left London, they were performed in their original and unexpurgated forms by the Children of the Chapel.

&quot;The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Byron&quot; offended the French ambassador, probably because it included a scene which portrayed Henry IV&#x27;s wife and mistress arguing and physically fighting, and Robert Cecil was persuaded to issue a warrant for Chapman&#x27;s arrest. However, Ludovic Stuart, 2nd Duke of Lennox, appears to have intervened to prevent its execution. On publication, the offending material was excised, and Chapman refers to the play in his dedication to Sir Thomas Walsingham as &quot;poore dismembered Poems&quot;.

His only work of classical tragedy, &quot;Caesar and Pompey&quot; (written 1604, published 1631), although &quot;politically astute&quot;, can be regarded as his most modest achievement in the genre.

===Other plays===
Chapman wrote The Old Joiner of Aldgate, performed by the Children of Paul&#x27;s between January and February 1603 – a play which caused some controversy due to the similarities between the content of the play and ongoing legal proceedings between one John Flaskett (a local book binder) and Agnes How (to whom Flaskett was betrothed). The play was purchased from Chapman by Thomas Woodford &amp; Edward Pearce for 20 marks (a considerable amount for such a work at the time) and resulted in a legal case that went before the Star Chamber.

Chapman wrote one of the most successful masques of the Jacobean era, &quot;The Memorable Masque of the Middle Temple and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn&quot;, performed on 15 February 1613. According to Kenneth Muir, &quot;The Masque of the Twelve Months&quot;, performed on Twelfth Night 1619 and first printed by John Payne Collier in 1848 with no author&#x27;s name attached, is also ascribed to Chapman.

Chapman&#x27;s authorship has been argued in connection with a number of other anonymous plays of his era. F. G. Fleay proposed that his first play was &quot;The Disguises&quot;. He has been put forward as the author, in whole or in part, of &quot;Sir Giles Goosecap,&quot; &quot;Two Wise Men And All The Rest Fools,&quot; &quot;The Fountain of New Fashions,&quot; and &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy.&quot; Of these, only &#x27;Sir Gyles Goosecap&#x27; is generally accepted by scholars to have been written by Chapman (&quot;The Plays of George Chapman: The Tragedies, with Sir Giles Goosecap,&quot; edited by Allan Holaday, University of Illinois Press, 1987).

In 1654, bookseller Richard Marriot published the play &quot;Revenge for Honour&quot; as the work of Chapman. Scholars have rejected the attribution; the play may have been written by Henry Glapthorne. &quot;Alphonsus Emperor of Germany&quot; (also printed 1654) is generally considered another false Chapman attribution.

The lost plays &quot;The Fatal Love&quot; and &quot;A Yorkshire Gentlewoman And Her Son&quot; were assigned to Chapman in Stationers&#x27; Register entries in 1660. Both of these plays were among the ones destroyed in the famous kitchen burnings by John Warburton&#x27;s cook. The lost play &quot;Christianetta&quot; (registered 1640) may have been a collaboration between Chapman and Richard Brome, or a revision by Brome of a Chapman work.

==Poet and translator==
Other poems by Chapman include: &quot;De Guiana, Carmen Epicum&quot; (1596), on the exploits of Sir Walter Raleigh; a continuation of Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s unfinished &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; (1598); and &quot;Euthymiae Raptus; or the Tears of Peace&quot; (1609).

Some have considered Chapman to be the &quot;rival poet&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets (in sonnets 78–86), although conjecture places him as one in a large field of possibilities.

From 1598 he published his translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot; in instalments. In 1616 the complete &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; appeared in &quot;The Whole Works of Homer&quot;, the first complete English translation, which until Alexander Pope&#x27;s (completed 1726) was the most popular in the English language and was the way most English speakers encountered these poems. The endeavour was to have been profitable: his patron, Prince Henry, had promised him £300 on its completion plus a pension. However, Henry died in 1612 and his household neglected the commitment, leaving Chapman without either a patron or an income. In an extant letter, Chapman petitions for the money owed him; his petition was ineffective. Chapman&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; is written in iambic pentameter, whereas his &quot;Iliad&quot; is written in iambic heptameter. (The Greek original is in dactylic hexameter.) Chapman often extends and elaborates on Homer&#x27;s original contents to add descriptive detail or moral and philosophical interpretation and emphasis.

Chapman also translated the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;, the &quot;Georgics&quot; of Virgil, &quot;The Works of Hesiod&quot; (1618, dedicated to Francis Bacon), the &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; of Musaeus (1618) and the &quot;Fifth Satire&quot; of Juvenal (1624).

Chapman&#x27;s translation of Homer was admired by Pope for &quot;a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation, which is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have writ&quot;, though he also disapproved of Chapman&#x27;s roughness and inaccuracy. John Keats expressed a fervent admiration of Chapman&#x27;s Homeric authenticity in his famous poem &quot;On First Looking into Chapman&#x27;s Homer&quot;. Chapman also drew attention from Samuel Taylor Coleridge and T. S. Eliot. 

==Homage==
In Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s poem &quot;The Revolt of Islam&quot;, Shelley quotes a verse of Chapman&#x27;s as homage within his dedication &quot;to Mary__ __&quot;, presumably his wife Mary Shelley:
&lt;poem&gt;
There is no danger to a man, that knows
What life and death is: there&#x27;s not any law
Exceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful
That he should stoop to any other law.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The Irish playwright Oscar Wilde quoted the same verse in his part fiction, part literary criticism, &quot;The Portrait of Mr. W.H.&quot;.

The English poet John Keats wrote &quot;On First Looking into Chapman&#x27;s Homer&quot; for his friend Charles Cowden Clarke in October 1816. The poem begins &quot;Much have I travell&#x27;d in the realms of gold&quot; and is much quoted. For example, P. G. Wodehouse in his review of the first novel of &quot;The Flashman Papers&quot; series that came to his attention: &quot;Now I understand what that &#x27;when a new planet swims into his ken&#x27; excitement is all about.&quot; Arthur Ransome uses two references from it in his children&#x27;s books, the &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; series.

==Quotes==
From &quot;All Fooles,&quot; II.1.170-178, by George Chapman:

&lt;poem&gt;
I could have written as good prose and verse
As the most beggarly poet of &#x27;em all,
Either Accrostique, Exordion,
Epithalamions, Satyres, Epigrams,
Sonnets in Doozens, or your Quatorzanies,
In any rhyme, Masculine, Feminine,
Or Sdrucciola, or cooplets, Blancke Verse:
Y&#x27;are but bench-whistlers now a dayes to them
That were in our times...
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>The Toynbee tiles, also called Toynbee plaques, are messages of unknown origin found embedded in asphalt of streets in about two dozen major cities in the United States and three South American cities. Since the 1980s, several hundred tiles have been discovered. They are generally about the size of an American license plate (roughly ), but sometimes considerably larger. They contain some variation of the following inscription:

&lt;poem&gt;
TOYNBEE IDEA
IN MOViE `2001
RESURRECT DEAD
ON PLANET JUPiTER
&lt;/poem&gt;

Some of the more elaborate tiles also feature cryptic political statements or exhort readers to create and install similar tiles. The material used for making the tiles was initially unknown, but evidence has emerged that they may be primarily made of layers of linoleum and asphalt crack-filling compound. Articles about the tiles began appearing in the mid-1990s, though references may have started to appear in the mid-1980s.

== History ==
The first confirmed sighting of the Toynbee tiles was in Philadelphia in 1983, and their first known reference in the media came in 1994 in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;. A 1983 letter to &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; referenced a Philadelphia-based campaign with themes similar to those mentioned in the tiles (e.g., resurrecting the dead on Jupiter, Stanley Kubrick, and Arnold J. Toynbee) but did not refer to tiles.

In the United States, tiles have officially been sighted as far west as Kansas City, Missouri, as far north as Boston, Massachusetts, and as far south as Richmond, Virginia. Since 2002, very few new tiles considered to be the work of the original artist have appeared outside of the immediate Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area, although one notable sighting appeared in suburban Connecticut in 2006, and one appeared in Edison, New Jersey in 2007. Presumed copycat tiles have been spotted in Noblesville, Indiana; Buffalo, New York; Syracuse, New York; San Francisco, California; Portland, Oregon; and Roswell, New Mexico as well as a 1997 sighting in Detroit, Michigan and a 2013 sighting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Many older tiles considered to be the work of the original tiler have been eroded by traffic, but older tiles remain in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; St. Louis, Missouri; Cincinnati Ohio, Cleveland, Ohio; and South America, among other locations.

On June 19, 2013, tiles resembling the Toynbee tiles appeared on a street in Topeka, Kansas. They were removed by the evening of the next day. Less than a month later, on July 17, 2013, a tile resembling the Toynbee tiles appeared on a street in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Newer tiles have been embedded on several major highways in Pennsylvania, including Interstate 476 in Delaware County, and on Interstate 95. About six more were found on U.S. 1 northbound starting in Drexel Hill in Delaware County, Pennsylvania in 2007 and 2008. The plates are much larger than the originals and have red italic writing on them. In 2016, some tiles started re-appearing in Philadelphia.

== Interpretations ==
=== People and things referred to ===
In a documentary film about the tiles, Justin Duerr assumes that &quot;Toynbee&quot; refers to the 20th century British historian Arnold J. Toynbee, and that &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s 2001&quot; is a reference to the 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, a film co-written and directed by filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, about a crewed mission to Jupiter. The former speculation site toynbee.net theorized that &#x27;Toynbee&#x27; referred to Ray Bradbury&#x27;s short story &quot;The Toynbee Convector&quot;.

The majority of tiles contain text similar to that above, although a second set is often found nearby. Several of these allude to a mass conspiracy between the press (including newspaper magnate John S. Knight of Knight-Ridder), the U.S. government, the USSR (including tiles seemingly made years after the Soviet Union&#x27;s dissolution), and &quot;hellion Jews&quot;.

A tile that used to be located in Santiago de Chile mentions a street address: 2624 S. 7th Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 2006, the occupants of the house stated that they knew nothing about the tiles and were annoyed by people who asked, although the house was the former residence of a named recluse and alleged tile-maker, as shown in the 2011 documentary film &quot;Resurrect Dead: The Mystery of the Toynbee Tiles&quot;. Toynbee-tile enthusiasts believe that a native Philadelphian created the Toynbee tiles because of the large number that appear in the city, their apparent age, the variety of carving styles, the presence of the &quot;tile creator&#x27;s screed,&quot; and the Philadelphia address on the Santiago tile.

=== Possible subjects ===
==== Arnold J. Toynbee&#x27;s &quot;The Idea&quot; ====
According to letters written by the tiler, allegedly uncovered by Toynbee tile researchers in Philadelphia in 2006, &quot;Toynbee&#x27;s idea&quot; stems from a passage in Arnold Toynbee&#x27;s book &quot;Experiences&quot;:

==== Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;The Toynbee Convector&quot; ====
Another possible interpretation is that the Toynbee reference comes from the science fiction writer Ray Bradbury&#x27;s short story &quot;The Toynbee Convector&quot;, which alludes to Toynbee&#x27;s idea that in order to survive, humankind must always rush to meet the future and believe in a better world, and must always aim far beyond what is practically possible, in order to achieve something barely within reach. Thus the message might be that humanity ought to strive to colonize Jupiter—as in Clarke&#x27;s work—or something greater, to survive.

==== Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Jupiter V&quot; ====
Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s short story &quot;Jupiter V&quot; involves a space ship named the &quot;Arnold Toynbee&quot; on a mission to Jupiter. It contains many ideas and concepts Clarke would later reuse when writing &quot;2001&quot;.

==== David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;4 A.M.&quot; ====
Playwright David Mamet has spoken of his belief that the tiles are an homage to one of his plays, and has described it as &quot;the weirdest thing that ever happened&quot;. In his 1983 work &quot;4 A.M.&quot; (published in the collection &quot;Goldberg Street: Short Plays and Monologues&quot; in 1985), a radio host based on Larry King impatiently listens to a caller who contends that the movie &quot;2001&quot;, based on the writings of Arnold Toynbee, speaks of the plan to reconstitute life on Jupiter. The radio show host quickly points out the factual errors in the caller&#x27;s assertion and the logical fallacies of his plan.

Researchers for the 2011 documentary &quot;Resurrect Dead: The Mystery of the Toynbee Tiles&quot; claim to have uncovered several pieces of evidence that predate Mamet&#x27;s play, including a 1980 call by the tiler to Larry King&#x27;s radio show. They cite a 1983 article in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; which mentions a local man &quot;contacting talk shows and newspapers to spread the message&quot; about bringing the dead to life on Jupiter, as depicted in the film &quot;2001&quot;.

== Creator ==

In 1983, a man identifying himself as a social worker named James Morasco contacted talk shows and newspapers with his theory of colonizing Jupiter with the dead inhabitants of Earth, claiming to have come across the idea while reading a book by historian Arnold Toynbee. In a conversation with &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, Morasco discussed how Toynbee&#x27;s book contained a theory on bringing dead molecules back to life and that this was later depicted in the movie &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. The caller had founded what the &quot;Inquirer&quot; called a &quot;Jupiter colonization organization&quot;, known as the Minority Association.

In 1996, the &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; editor Doug Worgul discovered a &quot;Toynbee Tile&quot; at the corner of 13th and Grand in downtown Kansas City. Investigating the story seven years later, he found that the tile was still there, and he determined that the street had last been resurfaced in 1996. Comparing the tile to those in other cities, a local police detective felt that &quot;clearly it was created by the same hand&quot; and concluded that despite referring to a &quot;movement&quot;, the creator was acting alone.

In 2003, Worgul called the only James Morasco in the Philadelphia telephone book and was told by the man&#x27;s wife that her husband had died in March that year, aged 88. When asked about the tiles, Morasco&#x27;s widow said that her husband &quot;didn&#x27;t know anything about it.&quot; Worgul doubted that this was the tile maker. Action News Philadelphia spoke to the widow of a man named James Joseph Morasco and identified him as a Philadelphia carpenter who had died in 2003, aged 87. His wife did not recognise the tiles and said her husband had had no interest in Jupiter. If Morasco had died at either age in 2003, he would have been in his seventies when most of the tiles were laid.

In the 2011 documentary &quot;Resurrect Dead: The Mystery of the Toynbee Tiles&quot;, artist and Toynbee Tile enthusiast Justin Duerr said that he considered the tiles to be the work of a single person and attributed them to the reclusive Philadelphia resident Severino &quot;Sevy&quot; Verna. Duerr believed Verna used the name &quot;James Morasco&quot; as an alias. The streets surrounding Verna&#x27;s residence were littered with small &quot;proto-tiles&quot; that Duerr believed were tests, and ham radio enthusiasts reported Verna might have broadcast a message via short wave radio about his theories. Based on comments from Verna&#x27;s neighbors about him driving a car without a passenger seat, Duerr suspected Verna placed the tiles through a hole in the floor of his car.

New tiles have been seen in Philadelphia since 2003. Between 2002 and 2007, many such tiles displayed a different font and styling than the older tiles and tended to leave out words that were found on the originals: &quot;raise&quot; is often substituted for &quot;resurrect,&quot; and prepositions are frequently omitted. Beginning in 2007, tiles were discovered in Philadelphia that are quite similar to the original tiles, leading some to believe that everything has been the work of the same person throughout the life of the tile phenomenon. The font and message are the same as the old ones, and the subtext is a return to some of the older ideas as well. These tiles were glued with a thicker layer of asphalt glue or sealant than older ones.

== Usage ==
=== Deployment ===
Toynbee-tile enthusiast Justin Duerr claims to have once found and examined a newly installed tile. This new tile was wrapped in tar paper and placed on a busy street early in the morning. From this find and other evidence, Duerr believes that the pressure exerted by cars driving over the tile for weeks on end pushes the tile into the road surface. Eventually, the tar paper wears away, exposing the message.

=== Destruction, conservation, and public acknowledgment ===
Tiles that are located in the middle of busy streets and highway on- and off-ramps tend to wear away quickly and also can become victims of resurfacing; smaller tiles and those located close to pedestrian crosswalks tend to be in better condition.

Hundreds of tiles have been destroyed during the course of regular road maintenance. The city of Chicago has declared the tiles &quot;vandalism&quot; and removes any tiles that it finds, considering them to be &quot;no different than graffiti.&quot;

A large tile complex, the tile maker&#x27;s apparent rant against his enemies, was destroyed when Chestnut Street in Philadelphia was repaved. One tile has been damaged and unreadable since 1996. It is located at the corners of Talcahuano and Santa Fé streets in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

There is no public or private agency dedicated to conserving Toynbee tiles. Many tiles now exist only as photographs taken before their destruction. The tiles have enjoyed attention from American and European media outlets, including from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;Spiegel Online&quot;, and NPR. In 2011, Philadelphia-based filmmakers Justin Duerr, Jon Foy, Colin Smith, and Steve Weinik released &quot;Resurrect Dead: The Mystery of the Toynbee Tiles&quot;, an independent documentary film about the tiles. The film was selected for the 2011 Sundance Film Festival in the U.S. Documentary category, and Foy won the category&#x27;s Directing Award.

, the Streets Department of Philadelphia recognizes Toynbee Tiles as street art, and &quot;will save one or two of the Toynbee Tiles only if there is a fast and affordable method for removing them.&quot;

<text>John Feckenham O.S.B. (c. 1515 – October 1584), also known as John Howman of Feckingham and later John de Feckenham or John Fecknam, was an English churchman, the last abbot of Westminster.

==Under Henry VIII and Edward VI==
Feckenham was born at Feckenham, Worcestershire, into a family of substantial yeomen. The family name was Howman, but as a monk he chose to be known by the name of his place of origin. Thomas Fuller notes in &quot;Worthies of England&quot; that Feckenham was the last clergyman to be &quot;locally surnamed&quot;. His early education came from the parish priest, but he was sent at an early age to the cloister school at Evesham Abbey, and from there, at age eighteen, to Gloucester Hall, Oxford, as a Benedictine student. After taking his degree in arts, he returned to Evesham Abbey, and took monastic vows. In 1537 he went back to Oxford and took his degree of Bachelor of Divinity on 11 June 1539. He was at Evesham at the time the abbey was surrendered on 27 January 1540 in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Then, with a pension of £10 a year, he went back to Oxford. Soon afterwards he became chaplain to John Bell Bishop of Worcester and then served Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London, in the same capacity from 1543 to 1549. In 1544 Bonner gave him the position of rector of Solihull.

Feckenham established a reputation as a preacher and a disputant of keen intellect but unvarying charity. After Bonner was deprived of his see, in about 1549, Thomas Cranmer sent Feckenham to the Tower of London, and while there learning and eloquence made him such a successful advocate that he was temporarily freed (&quot;borrowed out of prison&quot;) to take part in seven public disputations against John Hooper, John Jewel and others.

==Under Mary I==

Released by Queen Mary I on her accession in 1553, he returned to Bonner&#x27;s service, became a prebendary of St Paul&#x27;s, rector of Finchley, then of Greenford Magna, chaplain and confessor to the Queen, and then Dean of St Paul&#x27;s (10 March 1554). He took part in the Oxford disputes against Cranmer, Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley; but he was ill at ease with the brutality of some measures put in force against the Church of England. Feckenham employed his influence with Mary &quot;to procure pardon of the faults or mitigation of the punishment for poor Protestants&quot;. He was sent by the Queen to prepare Lady Jane Grey for death and when her half-sister, Elizabeth, was sent to the Tower on 18 March 1554, Feckenham interceded for her life and liberty, even at the cost of displeasing the Queen.

In May 1556, the degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on him by the University of Oxford, and when Westminster Abbey was revived, Feckenham was appointed abbot. Under his guidance traditional monastic life began again on 21 November 1556, Westminster School was reopened and the shrine of St Edward the Confessor was restored.

==Under Elizabeth I==
The story that Queen Elizabeth I sent for Feckenham and offered him the archbishopric of Canterbury, and offered to let the abbot and his monks stay at Westminster if they conformed to the Church of England has no contemporary source. Feckenham sat in Elizabeth&#x27;s first parliament, and was the last &quot;mitred abbot&quot; to do so. He consistently opposed all the legislation for changes in religion, and he refused the Oath of Supremacy. The abbey was dissolved again on 12 July 1560, and within a year Feckenham was sent by Archbishop Matthew Parker to the Tower (20 May 1560), according to Jewel, &quot;for having obstinately refused attendance on public worship and everywhere declaiming and railing against that religion which we now profess.&quot;

Except for some brief periods when he was a prisoner at large, Feckenham spent the rest of his life in confinement either in some recognized prison, or in the keeping of the bishops of Winchester and Ely. After fourteen years&#x27; confinement, he was released on bail and lived in Holborn, where his benevolence was shown by all manner of works of charity. &quot;He relieved the poor wheresoever he came, so that flies flock not thicker to spilt honey than beggars constantly crowd about him&quot;. He set up a public aqueduct in Holborn, and a hospice for the poor at Bath; he distributed every day to the sick the milk of twelve cows, took care of orphans, and encouraged sports on Sundays among the youth of London by giving prizes.

In 1577 he was committed to the care of Richard Cox, bishop of Ely, with strict instructions as to his treatment. Cox could find no fault with him except that &quot;he was a gentle person but in the popish religion too, too obstinate.&quot; In 1580 he was moved to Wisbech Castle, and there exercised a good influence among his fellow-prisoners; this was remembered when, in later years, the Wisbech Stirs broke out. Here, at his own cost, he repaired the road and set up a market cross in the town. Twenty-four years after the death of Queen Mary, he died in prison and was buried in the St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church, Wisbech, Isle of Ely on 10 October 1584.

==Published work==
John Feckenham&#x27;s surviving published works include:
*(London 1554) &quot;A Conference Dialoguewise held between the Lady Jane Dudley and Master J. F. ... touching the faith and belief of the sacrament and her religion&quot;,
*(London 1555) &quot;Two Homilies on the first, second, and third Articles of the Creed&quot;
*(London 1555) &quot;A notable Sermon at the Exequies of Joan, Queen of Spain&quot;
*(London 1559) &quot;The Oration of Dr. F. made in the Parliament House&quot;
*(London 1566) &quot;The Declaration of such Scruples and Stays of Conscience touching the Oath of Supremacy&quot;
*(London 1570) &quot;Objections or Assertions made against Mr. John Gough’s Sermon preached in the Tower of London&quot;
*(1576) &quot;Rules to be Observed at the Bathe&quot;

==Depiction in media==

Feckenham was played by the actor Michael Hordern in the 1986 historical drama &quot;Lady Jane&quot;. Feckenham&#x27;s scenes in the film depict his friendship with Lady Jane Grey.

<text>Baird&#x27;s sandpiper (Calidris bairdii) is a small shorebird. It is among those calidrids which were formerly included in the genus &quot;Erolia&quot;, which was into the genus &quot;Calidris&quot; in 1973. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The English name and specific &quot;bairdii&quot; commemorate Spencer Fullerton Baird, 19th-century naturalist and assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

==Description==
Adults have black legs and a short, straight, thin dark bill. They are dark brown on top and mainly white underneath with a black patch on the rump. The head and breast are light brown with dark streaks. In winter plumage, this species is paler brownish gray above. This bird can be difficult to distinguish from other similar tiny shorebirds; these are known collectively as &quot;peeps&quot; or &quot;stints&quot;.

One of the best identification features is the long wings, which extend beyond the tail when the bird is on the ground. Only the white-rumped sandpiper also shows this, and that bird can be distinguished by its namesake feature.

==Ecology==
Baird&#x27;s sandpipers breed in the northern tundra from eastern Siberia to western Greenland. They nest on the ground, usually in dry locations with low vegetation.

They are a long-distance migrant, wintering in South America. This species is a rare vagrant to western Europe.

Baird&#x27;s sandpiper might have hybridized with the buff-breasted sandpiper.

These birds forage by moving about mudflats, picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects, also some small crustaceans.

John Roy Hooper (also Johan Hoper; c. 1495 – 9 February 1555) was an English churchman, Anglican Bishop of Gloucester, later of Worcester and Gloucester, a Protestant reformer and a Protestant martyr. A proponent of the English Reformation, he was executed for heresy by burning during the reign of Queen Mary I.

==Early life==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
In 1538, a John Hooper appears among the names of the Black Friars at Gloucester, and also among the White Friars at Bristol, who surrendered their houses to the king. A John Hooper was likewise canon of Wormesley Priory in Herefordshire; but identification of any of these with the future bishop is doubtful. Rather, he appears to have been in 1538 rector of Liddington, Wiltshire, a benefice in Sir Thomas Arundell&#x27;s gift, though he must have been a non-resident incumbent. &quot;The Greyfriars&#x27; Chronicle&quot; says that Hooper was &quot;sometime a white monk&quot;; and in the sentence pronounced against him by Stephen Gardiner he is described as &quot;olim monachus de Cliva Ordinis Cisterciensis,&quot; i.e. of the Cistercian house of Cleeve Abbey in Somerset. On the other hand, he was not accused, like other married bishops who had been monks or friars, of infidelity to the vow of chastity; and his own letters to Heinrich Bullinger are curiously reticent on this part of his history. He speaks of himself as being the only son and heir of his father and fearing to be deprived of his inheritance, if he adopted the reformed religion.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=675}}

Prior to 1546, Hooper had secured employment as steward in Arundell&#x27;s household. Hooper speaks of himself during this period as being &quot;a courtier and living too much of a court life in the palace of our king&quot;. He chanced upon some of Huldrych Zwingli&#x27;s works and Bullinger&#x27;s commentaries on St Paul&#x27;s epistles, which elicited an evangelical conversion. After some correspondence with Bullinger on the lawfulness of complying, against his conscience, with the established religion, and following some trouble in England c. 1539–40, with Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester to whom Arundell had referred him out of concern for his new views, Hooper determined to secure what property he could and take refuge on the continent.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=675}} After living in Paris for an unknown period of time, Hooper returned to England to serve Sir John St Loe, constable of Thornbury Castle, Gloucestershire, Arundell&#x27;s nephew.

==Life on the continent==
Hooper found it necessary to leave for the continent again, probably in 1544, and he reached Strasbourg by 1546.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} He decided to permanently move to Zürich but he first returned to England to receive his inheritance, and he claims to have been twice imprisoned. In Strasbourg again, in early 1547, he married Anne de Tserclaes (or Tscerlas), a Fleming who with her sister had lived in the household of Jacques de Bourgogne, seigneur de Falais. He proceeded by way of Basel to Zürich, where his Zwinglian convictions were confirmed by constant conversation with Zwingli&#x27;s successor, Heinrich Bullinger. He also made connections with Martin Bucer, Theodore Bibliander, Simon Grynaeus, and Konrad Pellikan. During this time Hooper published &quot;An Answer to my Lord of Wynchesters Booke Intytlyd a Detection of the Devyls Sophistry&quot; (1547), &quot;A Declaration of Christ and his Office&quot; (1547), and &quot;A Declaration of the Ten Holy Commandments&quot; (1548).

==Chaplain at the centre of power==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
It was not until May 1549 that Hooper returned to England. There, he became the principal champion of Swiss Calvinism, against the Lutherans as well as the Catholics, and was appointed chaplain to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, the Lord Protector.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=675}} Hooper had a hand in the formation of the Zwinglian-inspired Dutch and French Stranger churches in Glastonbury and London. Hooper enjoyed at this time a friendship with Jan Łaski, and served as a witness for the prosecution in Bishop Bonner&#x27;s trial in 1549.

Somerset&#x27;s fall from power endangered Hooper&#x27;s position, especially as he had taken a prominent part against Gardiner and Bonner, whose restoration to their sees was now anticipated.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=675}} However, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick (subsequently Duke of Northumberland), who now dominated the council, continued Somerset&#x27;s Protestant religious policies. Hooper now became Dudley&#x27;s chaplain.

==Vestments controversy==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
After a course of Lenten sermons before the king, he was offered the bishopric of Gloucester. This led to the prolonged vestments controversy; in his sermons before the king and elsewhere Hooper had denounced the &quot;Aaronic vestments&quot; and the oath by the saints, prescribed in the new 1550 ordinal; and he refused to be consecrated according to its rites. Thomas Cranmer, Nicholas Ridley, Martin Bucer and others urged him to submit. Confinement to his house by order of the Council proved equally ineffectual, and it was not until he had spent some weeks in the Fleet prison that the &quot;father of nonconformity&quot; consented to conform, and Hooper submitted to consecration with the legal ceremonies (8 March 1551).{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=675}}

==Bishop==

Though Hooper had a low view of the role of bishops in the church, he soon set about a visitation of his diocese, which revealed a condition of almost incredible ignorance among his clergy.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=675}} Following examinations of 311 clerics, 168 were not able to repeat the Ten Commandments, and 31 were unable to state in what part of the Scriptures they were to be found; there were 40 who could not tell where the Lord&#x27;s Prayer was written, and 31 were ignorant of who authored it.

Hooper issued an injunction to his clergy, stressing in Article 9 that they &quot;were to teach the Parishioners the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer...word for word as they be written there...&quot; and in Article 10, &quot;that every parson... teach the Ten Commandments out of the twentieth chapter of Exodus, as they stand there, and no otherwise, not taking one word, letter or syllable from them...&quot;. Apparently this standard was enforced through much of the visitation. Less than a year after Hooper had been installed in Gloucester, his Diocese was reduced to an archdeaconry and added to the Diocese of Worcester, of which Hooper was made bishop in succession to Nicholas Heath{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=675}} on 20 May 1552.

Hooper believed a bishop should observe a vow of poverty but resigned the profits of the See of Gloucester to the Crown. As bishop, Hooper was also notable for his sense of social justice, and spoke eloquently of the distress caused by the economic crisis of the early 1550s. He wrote to William Cecil pleading for the council to take action on the price of essential goods, for &quot;all things here be so dear that the most part of the people lack ... their little livings and poor cottages decay daily.&quot;

==Downfall and death==

Upon Edward VI&#x27;s death, Northumberland tried to supplant Mary Tudor with his own daughter-in-law, Jane Grey. Hooper opposed this plot but this did not improve his situation once Mary had become Queen. As a representative of the radical wing of Protestantism, Hooper was the first bishop to be attacked. He was given sanctuary at Sutton Court, before being sent to the Fleet prison on 1 September, first on a charge of debt.

After Edward VI&#x27;s legislation on the church was repealed, Hooper was deprived of his bishopric as a married man on 19 March 1554. He was kept in prison and, after the revival of the heresy acts in December 1554, he was condemned for heresy by Bishop Gardiner and degraded by Bishop Bonner on 29 January 1555. Hooper was sent to Gloucester, where he was burnt on 9 February.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|pp=675–676}}

==Legacy==
Hooper represented the radical wing of English Protestantism. While he expressed dissatisfaction with some of Calvin&#x27;s earlier writings, he approved of the Consensus Tigurinus negotiated in 1549 between the Zwinglians and Calvinists of Switzerland. It was this form of religion that he laboured to spread in England and with others, such as Nicholas Ridley, Martin Bucer, and Pietro Martire Vermigli, he influenced the changes in the 1552 edition of the Book of Common Prayer. The subject had considerable influence on the Puritans of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, when many editions of Hooper&#x27;s works were published. Two volumes of Hooper&#x27;s writings are included in the Parker Society&#x27;s publications and another edition appeared at Oxford in 1855.{{sfn|Pollard|1911|p=676}} In 1550 he translated book 2 of Tertullian&#x27;s &quot;Ad Uxorem&quot; (To his wife), which is the first English translation of any of Tertullian&#x27;s works.

<text>Khoekhoe ( ) (or Khoikhoi in former orthography) are the traditionally nomadic pastoralist indigenous population of South Africa. They are often grouped with the hunter-gatherer San (literally &quot;Foragers&quot;) peoples. The accepted term for the two people being Khoisan. The designation &quot;Khoekhoe&quot; is actually a &quot;kare&quot; or praise address, not an ethnic endonym, but it has been used in the literature as an ethnic term for Khoe-speaking peoples of Southern Africa, particularly pastoralist groups, such as the Griqua, Gona, Nama, Khoemana and Damara nations. The Khoekhoe were once known as &quot;Hottentots&quot;, a term now considered offensive.

The Khoekhoe are thought to have diverged from other humans 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. In the 17th century, the Khoekhoe maintained large herds of Nguni cattle in the Cape region. They mostly gave up nomadic pastoralism in the 19th to 20th century. 

Their Khoekhoe language is related to certain dialects spoken by foraging &quot;San&quot; peoples of the Kalahari, such as the Khwe and Tshwa, forming the Khoe language family. Khoekhoe subdivisions today are the Nama people of Namibia, Botswana and South Africa (with numerous clans), the Damara of Namibia, the Orana clans of South Africa (such as Nama or Ngqosini), the Khoemana or Griqua nation of South Africa, and the Gqunukhwebe or Gona clans which fall under the Xhosa-speaking polities.

The Xirikua clans (Griqua) developed their own ethnic identity in the 19th century and settled in Griqualand West. Later, they formed another independent state in Kwazulu Natal named Griqualand East, losing their independence barely a decade later to the British. They are related to the same kinds of clan formations as Rehoboth Basters, who could also be considered a &quot;Khoekhoe&quot; people.

==History==

===Early history===
The broad ethnic designation of &quot;Khoekhoen&quot;, meaning the peoples originally part of a pastoral culture and language group to be found across Southern Africa, is thought to refer to a population originating in the northern area of modern Botswana. This culture steadily spread southward, eventually reaching the Cape approximately 2,000 years ago. &quot;Khoekhoe&quot; groups include ǀAwakhoen to the west, and ǀKx&#x27;abakhoena of South and mid-South Africa, and the Eastern Cape. Both of these terms mean &quot;Red People&quot;, and are equivalent to the IsiXhosa term &quot;amaqaba&quot;. Husbandry of sheep, goats and cattle grazing in fertile valleys across the region provided a stable, balanced diet, and allowed these lifestyles to spread, with larger groups forming in a region previously occupied by the subsistence foragers. Ntu-speaking agriculturalist culture is thought to have entered the region in the 3rd century AD, pushing pastoralists into the Western areas. The example of the close relation between the ǃUriǁ&#x27;aes (High clan), a cattle-keeping population, and the !Uriǁ&#x27;aeǀ&#x27;ona (High clan children), a more-or-less sedentary forager population (also known as &quot;Strandlopers&quot;), both occupying the area of ǁHuiǃgaeb, shows that the strict distinction between these two lifestyles is unwarranted, as well as the ethnic categories that are derived. Foraging peoples who ideologically value non-accumulation as a social value system would be distinct, however, but the distinctions among &quot;Khoekhoe pastoralists&quot;, &quot;San hunter-gatherers&quot; and &quot;Bantu agriculturalists&quot; do not hold up to scrutiny, and appear to be historical reductionism. While there are several theories about the Damaran and their links to the rest of the Khoekhoe, it is undeniable that they were originally the first inhabitants of Namibia along with the San, as such it is dubitable that the Nama and Damara peoples both had a hand in the creation of the Khoekhoe language as it spread southward. Following the migration of Bantu groups such as the Herero, the Damaran were displaced and migrated throughout all corners of what is today Namibia, this can be noted in a word used by Damaran when referring to the country 

===Arrival of Europeans===
Portuguese explorers and merchants are the first to record their contacts, in the 15th and 16th centuries A.D. The ongoing encounters were often violent. In 1510, at the Battle of Salt River, Francisco de Almeida and fifty of his men were killed and his party was defeated by ox-mounted !Uriǁ&#x27;aekua (&quot;Goringhaiqua&quot; in Dutch approximate spelling), which was one of the so-called Khoekhoe clans of the area that also included the !Uriǁ&#x27;aeǀ&#x27;ona (&quot;Goringhaicona&quot;, also known as &quot;Strandlopers&quot;), said to be the ancestors of the !Ora nation of today. In the late 16th century, Portuguese, French, Danish, Dutch and English but mainly Portuguese ships regularly continued to stop over in Table Bay en route to the Indies. They traded tobacco, copper and iron with the Khoekhoe-speaking clans of the region, in exchange for fresh meat.

Local population dropped after smallpox contagion was spread through European activity. The Khoe-speaking clans suffered high mortality as immunity to the disease was rare. This increased, as military conflict with the intensification of the colonial expansion of the United East India Company that began to enclose traditional grazing land for farms. Over the following century, the Khoe-speaking peoples were steadily driven off their land, resulting in numerous northwards migrations, and the reformulation of many nations and clans, as well as the dissolution of many traditional structures.

According to professors Robert K. Hitchcock and Wayne A. Babchuk, &quot;During the early phases of European colonization, tens of thousands of Khoekhoe and San peoples lost their lives as a result of genocide, murder, physical mistreatment, and disease.&quot;

During an investigation into &quot;bushman hunting&quot; parties and genocidal raids on the San, Louis Anthing commented: &quot;I find now that the transactions are more extensive than did at first appear. I think it not unlikely that we shall find that almost all the farmers living near this border are implicated in similar acts ... At present I have only heard of coloured farmers (known as Bastards) as being mixed up with these matters.&quot;

&quot;Khoekhoe&quot; social organisation was thus profoundly damaged by the colonial expansion and land seizure from the late 17th century onwards. As social structures broke down, many Khoekhoen settled on farms and became bondsmen (bondservants, serfs) or farm workers; others were incorporated into clans that persisted. Georg Schmidt, a Moravian Brother from Herrnhut, Saxony, now Germany, founded Genadendal in 1738, which was the first mission station in southern Africa, among the Khoe-speaking peoples in Baviaanskloof in the Riviersonderend Mountains.


The colonial designation of &quot;Baasters&quot; came to refer to any clans that had European ancestry in some part and adopted certain Western cultural traits. Though these were later known as Griqua (Xirikua or Griekwa) they were known at the time as &quot;Basters&quot; and in some instances are still so called, e. g., the Bosluis Basters of the Richtersveld and the Baster community of Rehoboth, Namibia, mentioned above.

Arguably responding to the influence of missionaries, the states of Griqualand West and Griqualand East were established by the Kok dynasty; these were later absorbed into the Cape Colony of the British Empire.

Beginning in the late 18th century, Oorlam communities migrated from the Cape Colony north to Namaqualand. They settled places earlier occupied by the Nama. They came partly to escape Dutch colonial conscription, partly to raid and trade, and partly to obtain herding lands. Some of these emigrant Oorlams (including the band led by the outlaw Jager Afrikaner and his son Jonker Afrikaner in the Transgariep) retained links to Oorlam communities in or close to the borders of the Cape Colony. In the face of gradual Boer expansion and then large-scale Boer migrations away from British rule at the Cape, Jonker Afrikaner brought his people into Namaqualand by the mid-19th century, becoming a formidable force for Oorlam domination over the Nama and against the Bantu-speaking Hereros for a period.

===Kat River settlement (1829–1856) and Khoena in the Cape Colony===

By the early 1800s, the remaining Khoe-speakers of the Cape Colony suffered from restricted civil rights and discriminatory laws on land ownership. With this pretext, the powerful Commissioner General of the Eastern Districts, Andries Stockenstrom, facilitated the creation of the &quot;Kat River&quot; Khoe settlement near the eastern frontier of the Cape Colony. The more cynical motive was probably to create a buffer-zone on the Cape&#x27;s frontier, but the extensive fertile land in the region allowed people to own their land and build communities in peace. The settlements thrived and expanded, and Kat River quickly became a large and successful region of the Cape that subsisted more or less autonomously. The people were predominantly Afrikaans-speaking !Gonakua, but the settlement also began to attract other diverse groups.

Khoekua were known at the time for being very good marksmen, and were often invaluable allies of the Cape Colony in its frontier wars with the neighbouring Xhosa politics. In the Seventh Frontier War (1846–1847) against the Gcaleka, the Khoekua gunmen from Kat River distinguished themselves under their leader Andries Botha in the assault on the &quot;Amatola fastnesses&quot;. (The young John Molteno, later Prime Minister, led a mixed commando in the assault, and later praised the Khoekua as having more bravery and initiative than most of his white soldiers.)

However, harsh laws were still implemented in the Eastern Cape, to encourage the Khoena to leave their lands in the Kat River region and to work as labourers on white farms. The growing resentment exploded in 1850. When the Xhosa rose against the Cape Government, large numbers Khoeǀ&#x27;ona joined the Xhosa rebels for the first time. After the defeat of the rebellion and the granting of representative government to the Cape Colony in 1853, the new Cape Government endeavoured to grant the Khoena political rights to avert future racial discontent. Attorney General William Porter was famously quoted as saying that he &quot;would rather meet the Hottentot at the hustings, voting for his representative, than meet him in the wilds with his gun upon his shoulder&quot;. Thus, the government enacted the Cape franchise in 1853, which decreed that all male citizens meeting a low property test, regardless of colour, had the right to vote and to seek election in Parliament. However, this non-racial principle was eroded in the late 1880s by a literacy test, and later abolished by the Apartheid Government.

===Massacres in German South-West Africa===

From 1904 to 1907, the Germans took up arms against the Khoekhoe group living in what was then German South-West Africa, along with the Herero. Over 10,000 Nama, more than half of the total Nama population at the time, may have died in the conflict. This was the single greatest massacre ever witnessed by the Khoekhoe people. In addition to the Nama and Herero deaths, the Damara are lesser-known victims of the genocide who lost around 57% of their population.

===Apartheid===

As native African people, Khoekhoe and other dark-skinned, indigenous groups were oppressed and subjugated under the white-supremacist Apartheid regime. In particular, some consider Khoekhoe and related ethnic groups to have been some of the most heavily marginalized groups during Apartheid&#x27;s reign, as referenced by previous South African president Jacob Zuma in his 2012 state of the nation address.

Some Khoekhoe in South Africa were classified as &quot;Coloured&quot; under Apartheid. While this meant that they were offered a few privileges not given to the population deemed &quot;black&quot; (such as not having to carry a passbook), they were still subject to discrimination, segregation, and other forms of oppression. This included the forced relocation caused by the Group Areas Act, which broke up families and communities. The destruction of historical communities and the blanket designation of &quot;coloured&quot; (ignoring any nuances of the Khoekhoe peoples&#x27; specific cultures or subgroups) contributed to an erasure of Khoekhoe identity and culture, one which modern Khoekhoe people are still working to undo.

Apartheid ended in 1994 and so too did the racial &quot;Coloured&quot; designation.

===Modern era===

After apartheid, Khoekhoe activists have worked to restore their lost culture, and affirm their ties to the land. Khoekhoe and Khoisan groups have brought cases to court demanding restitution for &#x27;cultural genocide and discrimination against the Khoisan nation’, as well as land rights and the return of Khoesan corpses from European museums.

==Culture==
===Religion===
The religious mythology of the Khoe-speaking cultures gives special significance to the Moon, which may have been viewed as the physical manifestation of a supreme being associated with heaven. Thiǁoab (Tsui&#x27;goab in Nama and ǁGamab in Damara mythology) is also believed to be the creator and the guardian of health, while ǁGaunab is primarily an evil being, who causes sickness or death. Many Khoe-speakers have converted to Christianity and Nama Muslims make up a large percentage of Namibia&#x27;s Muslims.

===World Heritage===
UNESCO has recognised Khoe-speaking culture through its inscription of the Richtersveld as a World Heritage Site. This important area is the only place where transhumance practices associated with the culture continue to any great extent.

The International Astronomical Union named the primary component of the binary star Mu¹ Scorpii after the traditional Khoekhoe language name &quot;Xami di mûra&quot; (&#x27;eyes of the lion&#x27;).

==List of Khoekhoe peoples==
The classification of Khoekhoe peoples can be broken down roughly into two groupings: Northern Khoekhoe &amp; Southern Khoekhoe (&quot;Cape Khoe&quot;).

===Northern Khoekhoe===

The Northern Khoekhoe are sub divided into two groups, namely the Nama and the Damara, or ǂNūkhoen. Each of these two groups are further subdivided into several clans. The clans of Nama are:
* Khaiǁkhaun (Red Nation) at Hoachanas, the main group and the oldest Nama clan in Namibia
* ǀKhowesen (Direct descendants of Captain Hendrik Witbooi) who was killed in the battle with Germans on 29 October 1905. The |Khowesin, reside in modern-day Gibeon under the leadership of Ismael Hendrik Witbooi the 9th Gaob (meaning captain) of the |Khowesen Gibeon, situated 72 km south of Mariental and 176 km north of Keetmanshoop just off the B1, was originally known by the name Khaxa-tsûs. It received its name from Kido Witbooi first Kaptein of the ǀKhowesin.
* ǃGamiǂnun (Bondelswarts) at Warmbad
* ǂAonin (Southern Topnaars) at Rooibank
* ǃGomen (Northern Topnaars) at Sesfontein
* ǃKharakhoen (Fransman Nama) at Gochas. After being defeated by Imperial Germany &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; in the Battle of Swartfontein on 15 January 1905, this Nama group split into two. Part of the ǃKharakhoen fled to Lokgwabe, Botswana, and stayed there permanently, the part that remained on South West African soil relocated their tribal centre to Amper-Bo. In 2016 David Hanse was inaugurated as chief of the clan.
* ǁHawoben (Veldschoendragers) at Koës
* !Aman at Bethanie which was led by Cornelius Frederick
* ǁOgain (Groot Doden) at Schlip
* ǁKhauǀgoan (Swartbooi Nama) at Rehoboth, later at Salem, Ameib, and Franzfontein
* Kharoǃoan (Keetmanshoop Nama) under the leadership of Hendrik Tseib split from the Red Nation in February 1850 and settled at Keetmanshoop.
Among the Nama are also the Oorlams who are a southern Khoekhoe people of mixed-race ancestry that trekked northwards over the Orange River and where absorbed into the greater Nama identity. The Oorlams themselves are made up of five smaller clans:
* ǀAixaǀaen (Orlam Afrikaners), the first group to enter and permanently settle in Namibia. Their leader Klaas Afrikaner left the Cape Colony around 1770. The clan first built the fortress of ǁKhauxaǃnas, then moved to Blydeverwacht, and finally settled at Windhoek.
* ǃAman (Bethanie Orlam) subtribe settled at Bethanie at the turn of the eighteenth century.
* Kaiǀkhauan (Khauas Nama) subtribe formed in the 1830s, when the Vlermuis clan merged with the Amraal family. Their home settlement became Naosanabis (now Leonardville), which they occupied from 1840 onward. This clan ceased to exist after military defeat by Imperial German &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; in 1894 and 1896.
* ǀHaiǀkhauan (Berseba Orlam) subtribe formed in 1850, when the Tibot and Goliath families split from the ǃAman to found Berseba.
* ǀKhowesin (Witbooi Orlam) subtribe was the last to take up settlement in Namibia. They originated at Pella, south of the Orange River. Their home town became Gibeon.

These Nama inhabit the Great Namaqualand region of Namibia.
There are also minor Nama clans that inhabit the Little Namaqualand regions south of the Orange River in north western South Africa.

===Southern Khoekhoe (&quot;Cape Khoe&quot;)===

The southern Khoekhoe peoples (Sometimes incorrectly called the Cape Khoe due to the importance of the Cape of Good Hope) inhabit the Western Cape and Eastern Cape Provinces in the south western coastal regions of South Africa. They are divided into four subgroups: Eastern Cape Khoe, Central Cape Khoe, Western Cape Khoe and Peninsular Cape Khoe. Each of these subgroups are further divided into nations and subtribes who constitute an integral part of the Khoekhoe form of government.
===The Eastern Cape Khoe===
* Hoengeyqua
* Damasonqua
* Gonaqua

===Central Cape Khoe===
* Inqua (&quot;also called &quot;Humcumqua&quot;&quot;)
* Houtunqua
* Gamtobaqua (&quot;possible historical subgroup of the Houtunqua&quot;)
* Attaqua
* Gouriqua
* Chamaqua

===Western Cape Khoe===
* Chainouoqua
* Hawequa (&quot;also called &quot;Obiqua&quot;. possible historical subgroup of the Chainouqua&quot;)
* Cochoqua
* Hessequa
* Chairiguriqua
* !Amaǁua (&quot;also called &quot;Omaqua&quot; later renamed to &quot;Portugies&quot;&quot;.)

===Peninsular Cape Khoe===
Goringhaiqua: The Goringhaiqua are a single tribal authority made from the two houses of the Goringhaikona and Gorachouqua.

== Early European theories about Khoekhoe origins ==
A commissioned &quot;Grammar and Dictionary of the Zulu Language&quot;, published in 1859, put forward the idea of an origin from Egypt that appears to have been popular at the time. The reasoning for this included the (supposed) distinctive Caucasian elements of the Khoekhoe&#x27;s appearance, a &quot;wont to worship the moon&#x27;&quot;, an apparent similarity to the antiquities of Old Egypt, and a &quot;very different language&quot; to their neighbours. The &quot;Grammar&quot; says that &quot;the best philologists of the present day ... find marked resemblances between the two&quot;.

<doc id="314822" wikidata="Q1631241" url="?curid=314822" title="Hottentot (racial term)">
<text>Hottentot (English and German language ) is a term that was historically used by Europeans to refer to the Khoekhoe, the indigenous nomadic pastoralists in South Africa.

Use of the term &quot;Hottentot&quot; is now considered offensive, the preferred name for the non Bantu speaking indigenous people of the Western Cape area being &quot;Khoekhoe&quot; (formerly &quot;Khoikhoi&quot;).

== Etymology ==
&quot;Hottentot&quot; originated among the &quot;old Dutch&quot; settlers of the Dutch Cape Colony run by United East India Company (VOC), who arrived in the region in the 1650s, and it entered English usage from Dutch in the seventeenth century. However, no definitive Dutch etymology for the term is known. A widely claimed etymology is from a supposed Dutch expression equivalent to &quot;stammerer, stutterer&quot;, applied to the Khoikhoi on account of the distinctive click consonants in their languages. There is, however, no earlier attestation of a word &quot;hottentot&quot; to support this theory. An alternative possibility is that the name derived from an overheard term in chants accompanying Khoikhoi or San dances, but seventeenth-century transcriptions of such chants offer no conclusive evidence for this.

An early Anglicisation of the term is recorded as &quot;hodmandod&quot; in the years around 1700. The reduced Afrikaans/Dutch form &quot;hotnot&quot; has also been borrowed into South African English as a derogatory term for black people, including Cape Coloureds.

== Usage as an ethnic term ==
In seventeenth-century Dutch, &quot;Hottentot&quot; was at times used to denote all black people (synonymously with &quot;Kaffir&quot;, which was at times likewise used for Cape Coloureds and Khoisans), but at least some speakers used the term &quot;Hottentot&quot; specifically for what they thought of as a race distinct from the supposedly darker-skinned people referred to as &quot;Kaffirs&quot;. This distinction between the non-Bantu &quot;Cape Blacks&quot; or &quot;Cape Coloureds&quot; and the Bantu was noted as early as 1684 by the French anthropologist François Bernier. The idea that &quot;Hottentot&quot; referred strictly to the non-Bantu peoples of southern Africa was well embedded in colonial scholarly thought by the end of the eighteenth century.

The main meaning of &quot;Hottentot&quot; as an ethnic term in the 19th and the 20th centuries has therefore been to denote the Khoikhoi people specifically. However, &quot;Hottentot&quot; also continued to be used through the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries in a wider sense, to include all of the people now usually referred to with the modern term &quot;Khoisan&quot; (not only the Khoikhoi, but also the San people, hunter-gatherer populations from the interior of southern Africa who had not been known to the seventeenth-century settlers, once often referred to as &quot;Bosjesmannen&quot; in Dutch and &quot;Bushmen&quot; in English).

In George Murdock&#x27;s &quot;Atlas of World Cultures&quot; (1981), the author refers to &quot;Hottentots&quot; as a &quot;subfamily of the Khoisan linguistic family&quot; who &quot;became detribalized in contact with Dutch settlers in 1652, mixing with the latter and with slaves brought by them from Indonesia to form the hybrid population known today as the Cape Coloured.&quot; The term &quot;Hottentot&quot; remained in use as a technical ethnic term in anthropological and historiographical literature into the late 1980s. The 1996 edition of the &quot;Dictionary of South African English&quot; merely says that &quot;the word &#x27;Hottentot&#x27; is seen by some as offensive and Khoikhoi is sometimes substituted as a name for the people, particularly in scholarly contexts&quot;. Yet, by the 1980s, because of the racist connotations discussed below, it was increasingly seen as too derogatory and offensive to be used in an ethnic sense.

== Usage as a term of abuse and racist connotations ==
From the eighteenth century onwards, the term &quot;hottentot&quot; was also a term of abuse without a specific ethnic sense, comparable to &quot;barbarian&quot; or &quot;cannibal&quot;. According to James Boswell&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Johnson&quot;, Samuel Johnson was parodied in Lord Chesterfield&#x27;s Letters of 1737 as &quot;a respectable Hottentot&quot;.

In its ethnic sense, &quot;Hottentot&quot; had developed its connotations of savagery and primitivism by the seventeenth century; colonial depictions of the Hottentots (Khoikhoi) in the seventeenth to eighteenth century were characterized by savagery, often suggestive of cannibalism or the consumption of raw flesh, physiological features such as steatopygia and elongated labia perceived as primitive or &quot;simian&quot; and a perception of the click sounds in the Khoikhoi languages as &quot;bestial&quot;. Thus, it can be said that the European, colonial image of &quot;the Hottentot&quot; from the seventeenth century onwards bore little relation to any realities of the Khoisan in Africa, and that this image fed into the usage of &quot;hottentot&quot; as a generalised derogatory term. Correspondingly, the word is &quot;sometimes used as ugly slang for a black person&quot;.

Use of the derived term &quot;hotnot&quot; was explicitly proscribed in South Africa by 2008. Accordingly, much recent scholarship on the history of colonial attitudes to the Khoisan or on the European trope of &quot;the Hottentot&quot; puts the term &quot;Hottentot&quot; in scare quotes.

== Other usages ==
In its original role of ethnic designator, the term &quot;Hottentot&quot; was included into a variety of derived terms, such as the Hottentot Corps, the first Coloured unit to be formed in the South African army, originally called the &quot;Corps Bastaard Hottentoten&quot; (Dutch; in English: &quot;Corps Bastard Hottentots&quot;), organised in 1781 by the Dutch colonial administration of the time.

The word is also used in the common names of a wide variety of plants and animals, such as the &quot;Africanis&quot; dogs sometimes called &quot;Hottentot hunting dogs&quot;, the fish &quot;Pachymetopon blochii&quot;, frequently simply called &quot;hottentots&quot;, &quot;Carpobrotus edulis&quot;, commonly known as a &quot;hottentot-fig&quot;, and &quot;Trachyandra&quot;, commonly known as &quot;hottentot cabbage&quot;. It has also given rise to the scientific name for one genus of scorpion, &quot;Hottentotta&quot;, and may be the origin of the epithet &quot;tottum&quot; in the botanical name &quot;Leucospermum tottum&quot;.

The word is still used as part of a tongue-twister in modern Dutch, &quot;Hottentottententententoonstelling&quot;, meaning a &quot;Hottentot tent exhibition&quot;.

In the 1964 film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, Admiral Boom mistakes the rooftop-dancing chimney sweeps for an attack by &quot;Hottentots&quot;. In 2024, the BBFC raised the film&#x27;s age rating from U to PG due to this instance of &quot;discriminatory language&quot;.

The name of Reiner Knizia&#x27;s game &quot;Schotten-Totten&quot; is a portmanteau of the German words &quot;Schotten&quot; (Scottish people) and &quot;Hottentotten&quot; (Hottentots).

The Shakespears Sister song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;, from the 1992 album &quot;Hormonally Yours&quot;, includes the lines:
&quot;In a boreolic iceberg came Victoria;
Queen Victoria, sitting shocked upon on the rocking horse of a wave,
Said to the Laureat, this minx of course,
Is sharp as any lynx, and blacker, deeper
Than the drinks, as hot as any &quot;hottentot&quot;.&quot;

<text>Clonakilty (; ), sometimes shortened to Clon, is a town in County Cork, Ireland. The town is at the head of the tidal Clonakilty Bay. The rural hinterland is used mainly for dairy farming. The town&#x27;s population was 4,946 at the 2022 census. The town is a tourism hub in West Cork, and was recognised as the &quot;Best Town in Europe&quot; in 2017, and &quot;Best Place of the Year&quot; in 2017 by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland. Clonakilty is in the Dáil constituency of Cork South-West, which has three seats.

==History==

The Clonakilty area has a number of ancient and pre-Celtic sites, including Lios na gCon ringfort. Norman settlers built castles around Clonakilty, and a number of Norman surnames survive in the West Cork area to the present day. In 1292, Thomas De Roach received a charter to hold a market every Monday at Kilgarriffe (then called Kyle Cofthy or Cowhig&#x27;s Wood), close to where the present town now stands. In the 14th century, a ten-mile strip of fallow woodland called (the land of the woods) divided the barony of Ibane (Ardfield) and Barryroe and reached the sea at Clonakilty Bay. Here a castle called Coyltes Castell was recorded in a 1378 plea roll. This was subsequently referred to as Cloghnykyltye, one of the many phonetic spellings for (meaning the castle of the woods, from , the Irish for stone or stone building, and meaning woods).

The lands around Clonakilty were owned by Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, and it was Lord Cork (&#x27;the Great Earl&#x27;) who obtained its charter from James I in 1613, with the right to return members to the Irish House of Commons. The borough of Clonakilty returned two members from 1613 to 1801; it was disfranchised when the Act of Union came into force in January 1801. It also had a part-time judge, the Recorder of Clonakilty, who held a weekly court of Petty session. The estate lands at Clonakilty were later purchased by the Earls of Shannon, another branch of the Boyle dynasty. They remained the main landlords of the town from the eighteenth century until the early twentieth century.

During the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Protestant settlers in Clonakilty fled to Bandon, and much of Clonakilty was burned by Catholic rebels. On October 1642, a Protestant force led by the then Lord Forbes reoccupied the town. Forbes left two companies from the Lord Forbes&#x27; Regiment and one company from the Bandon Foot to garrison Clonakilty before leaving the town to relieve Rathbarry Castle, which was under siege by rebel forces. However, almost immediately after Lord Forbes left Clonakilty, a large force of Catholic rebels attacked the town; the two Scottish companies refused to retreat and were killed to a man, while the Irish company fought their way out of the town to an abandoned ringfort near Rosscarbery, where they were relieved by Lord Forbes who had returned from Rathbarry. The reunified force returned to Clonakilty and drove out the rebels, who fled towards the island of Inchydoney, where roughly six hundred of them drowned at high tide. Lord Forbes&#x27; men returned to the town and freed a large number of men, women and children imprisoned in Clonakilty&#x27;s market house.

The town was also the site of a battle in 1691 during the Williamite War in Ireland. During the Irish Rebellion of 1798, Shannonvale near Clonakilty was the site of the Battle of the Big Cross. It was described as &quot;the only place in all Munster where a blow of some sort had been struck during the Rising of &#x27;98&quot;. There is a commemorative statue celebrating the Battle of the Big Cross in Asna Square in the centre of Clonakilty.

Michael Collins, who was the Director of Intelligence for the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Irish War of Independence, lived in Clonakilty and attended the local boys&#x27; national school. Collins later served as Chairman of the Provisional Government of Ireland and was instrumental in the founding of the Irish Free State. Collins was killed in an ambush by the Anti-Treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War. He gave several orations from O&#x27;Donovan&#x27;s Hotel on the Main Street of Clonakilty. On Emmet Square, where Collins lived for a period, is a statue of Michael Collins (erected and dedicated in 2002) and a museum (opened in 2016).

In April 1943, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress was travelling from Morocco to England when it was forced to land at a marsh just outside Clonakilty. The crew (who were uninjured) thought they had been flying over German-occupied Norway. Kennedy Gardens at Emmet Square (formerly Shannon Square) in the centre of town is named after John F. Kennedy. In June 2012, Clonakilty was damaged by flooding. Clonakilty was founded on 5 May 1613, and on 5 May 2013, President Michael D.

<text>Nicholas Heath (–1578) was the last Roman Catholic archbishop of York and Lord Chancellor. He previously served as bishop of Worcester.

==Life==
Heath was born in London and graduated BA at Oxford in 1519. He then migrated to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1520, MA in 1522, and was elected fellow in 1524. After holding minor preferments he was appointed archdeacon of Stafford in 1534 and graduated DD in 1535. He then accompanied Edward Fox, bishop of Hereford, on his mission to promote a theological and political understanding with the Lutheran princes of Germany. His selection for this duty implies a readiness on Heath&#x27;s part to proceed some distance along the path of reform; but his dealings with the Lutherans did not confirm this tendency, and Heath&#x27;s subsequent career was closely associated with adherence to Roman Catholicism.

In 1539, the year of the Six Articles, he was made bishop of Rochester, and in 1543 he succeeded John Bell at Worcester. His Catholicism, however, was arguably of a less rigid type than Gardiner&#x27;s and Bonner&#x27;s; he felt something of the force in some quarters of the national antipathy to foreign influence, whether ecclesiastical or secular, and was always impressed by the necessity of national unity, so far as was possible, in matters of faith. Apparently he made no difficulty about carrying out the earlier reforms of Edward VI, and he accepted the first &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; after it had been modified by the House of Lords in a Catholic direction.

His definite breach with the English Reformation occurred on the grounds, on which four centuries later Leo XIII would claim that the Anglican priesthood was not valid. The question was over the 1550 ordinal. Heath refused to accept it, was imprisoned, and in 1551 deprived of his bishopric. On Mary&#x27;s accession he was released and restored, and made president of the Council of Wales and the Marches. In 1555 he was promoted to the archbishopric of York, which he did much to enrich; he built York House on Strand, London. After Gardiner&#x27;s death he was appointed lord chancellor, probably on Cardinal Reginald Pole&#x27;s recommendation; for Heath, like Pole himself, disliked the Spanish party in England. Unlike Pole, however, he seems to have been averse to the harsher aspects of Mary&#x27;s reign, and no Protestants were burnt in his diocese. He exercised, however, little influence on Mary&#x27;s secular or ecclesiastical policy.

On Mary&#x27;s death Heath as chancellor at once proclaimed Elizabeth. Like Sir Thomas More he held that it was entirely within the competence of the national state, represented by parliament, to determine questions of the succession to the throne; and although Elizabeth did not renew his commission as lord chancellor, he continued to sit in the privy council for two months until the government had determined to complete the breach with the Roman Catholic Church; and as late as April 1559 he assisted the government by helping to arrange the Westminster Conference, and attempting to establish some common ground between his co-religionists and the emerging Elizabethan settlement. He refused to crown Elizabeth, however, because she would not have the coronation service accompanied with the elevation of the Host; and ecclesiastical ceremonies and doctrine could not, in Heath&#x27;s view, be altered or abrogated by any mere national authority.

Hence he steadily resisted Elizabeth&#x27;s acts of supremacy and uniformity, although he had acquiesced in the acts of 1534 and 1549. Like others of Henry&#x27;s bishops, he had been convinced by the events of Edward VI&#x27;s reign that Sir Thomas More was right and Henry VIII was wrong in their attitude towards the claims of the papacy and the Roman Catholic Church. He was therefore necessarily deprived of his archbishopric in 1559, but he remained loyal to Elizabeth; and after a temporary confinement he was suffered to pass the remaining nineteen years of his life in peace and quiet, never attending public worship and sometimes hearing mass in private. The queen visited him more than once at his house at Chobham, Surrey; he died and was buried there at the end of 1578.

<doc id="314828" wikidata="Q354790" url="?curid=314828" title="Mirko Cro Cop">
<text>Mirko Filipović (; born 10 September 1974), better known by his ring name Mirko Cro Cop, is a Croatian former professional mixed martial artist, kickboxer and amateur boxer. He is mostly known for his time in Pride Fighting Championships. Cro Cop fought in the UFC, K-1, RIZIN and Bellator. He is widely considered one of the greatest Heavyweight Kickboxers and MMA fighters of all time.

Cro Cop is the 2006 Pride Open-Weight Grand Prix Champion, the K-1 World Grand Prix FINAL in Zagreb Champion and the 2016 Rizin Openweight Grand Prix Champion becoming the second fighter in the world to win mixed martial arts and kickboxing championships and tournaments. He is also a former IGF Champion. His nickname, Cro Cop, short for &quot;Croatian Cop&quot;, comes from his employment in the Lučko Anti-Terrorist Unit, Croatia&#x27;s elite Police Special Forces tactical unit.

Cro Cop&#x27;s signature move was his lightning-quick left high roundhouse kick, once famously described as &quot;right leg, hospital; left leg, cemetery.&quot; He was a successful amateur boxer and medalled numerous times in international competition, and was also a member of Croatia&#x27;s world team when he competed at the 1997 Amateur Boxing World Championships.

From 23 December 2003 until 11 January 2008 he served as a Member of the Croatian Parliament for the 1st electoral district. He was elected as an independent candidate on the list of the Social Democratic Party.

On 1 March 2019, he announced his retirement for health reasons, specifically a stroke he suffered.

==Background==
Filipović was born on 10 September 1974 in Vinkovci in eastern Croatia, then part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He was raised in a working-class family with his sister, who is three years his senior. Mirko grew up training in track and field, namely the shorter distance events (100m, 200m, and 400m dashes). After seeing Jean-Claude Van Damme&#x27;s performance in the film &quot;Bloodsport&quot;, he began training in his parents&#x27; garage with his father&#x27;s boxing equipment and weights. His father, who worked as an electrician for a railway company, fashioned his son a crude but effective punching bag filled with sand and cotton, and would bring home track scraps for Mirko to use for weight training. Filipović began formal training in taekwondo at the age of 7 and later studied karate.

Filipović&#x27;s father died in 1994 when Mirko was 19 years old and after Filipović had joined the Croatian Army as a radio telegraphist the year before. After writing a request to the commander of his military base to train with the Croatian national kickboxing team, his request was approved. The colonel told Filipović: I don&#x27;t think you will be a special soldier, but I believe you will be a good fighter one day. So you don&#x27;t have to learn [with the radio telegraphists]. I release you and I want you to train twice a day. And I want you to make your country and your homeland proud one day. Filipović described this as one of the best days of his life. After this, he embarked on a career in professional kickboxing.

==Boxing and kickboxing career==
Filipović started his professional career in 1996 as a kickboxer, following in the footsteps of his compatriot Branko Cikatić. Before turning pro, he had accumulated an amateur boxing record of 48–8 (31 KO&#x27;s). He defeated Jérôme Le Banner in his debut, but after losing to Ernesto Hoost in his next match, he turned his attention back to boxing and his law enforcement career. He had success in both areas as a three-time national amateur boxing champion and later joined the Lučko Anti-Terrorist Unit where he served for six years until he was elected to the Croatian Parliament. Filipović took part in the 1997 World Amateur Boxing Championships, losing his first round match-up against Olympic medalist Alexei Lezin. At the time, he was working as a commando in the Croatian police anti-terrorist unit &quot;Alpha&quot; (stationed in Lučko near Zagreb), which earned him his nickname &quot;Cro Cop&quot;. He fought several times early in his career under the nickname &quot;Tigar&quot; (Croatian for &quot;tiger&quot;).

Cro Cop was a runner up for the K-1 Grand Prix 1999 title and the K-1 World Grand Prix 2000 in Fukuoka title. Cro Cop captured the K-1 World Grand Prix FINAL in Zagreb title in 2014. Cro Cop had a 21-7 record with the promotion K-1, made two appearances in Glory. He is considered to be one of the greatest Kickboxers of all time.

==Mixed martial arts career==
===Pride FC===
In 2001, Filipović began his switch to fighting in mixed martial arts promotion Pride Fighting Championships, citing personal challenge as well as dissatisfaction with K-1 salaries. A year later, he also left his job at the anti-terrorist unit in order to focus fully on his martial arts career.

Cro Cop&#x27;s first 6 professional MMA fights were in K-1 2001 GP Final, PRIDE FC and the New Year&#x27;s events Inoki-Bom-Ba-Ye. He defeated veterans Kazuyuki Fujita (twice) and Japanese legend Kazushi Sakuraba, while drawing with Nobuhiko Takada and reigning PRIDE Middleweight Champion Wanderlei Silva.

====Early PRIDE career====
Now fighting exclusively in PRIDE, Cro Cop&#x27;s 7th MMA fight was against former title challenger Heath Herring, who sported a 20–8 record and had gone the distance with current champion Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira in addition to fighting soon-to-be champion Fedor Emelianenko, against whom he lost when the doctor had to stop the fight after the 1st round. Cro Cop defeated Herring via body kick and punches 3 minutes into the fight.

In his 8th fight, he became the first fighter to defeat legendary striker Igor Vovchanchyn by KO (with his trademark head kick). This was witnessed as a passing of the torch in the heavyweight division, as Vovchanchyn went on a decline and Cro Cop continued his run at the heavyweight title. Cro Cop then defeated Dos Caras Jr. via head kick KO in 46 seconds, and then told the fans that he would see them in his next fight for the title against Fedor Emelianenko.

====PRIDE Interim Heavyweight Championship====
After a contractual dispute between PRIDE and Fedor Emelianenko, PRIDE matched up Cro Cop against former champion Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira for the PRIDE Interim Heavyweight Championship. Cro Cop dominated early in the stand up; even knocking Nogueira down at the end of the round which prompted Yuji Shimada to wave the fight off, but the bell had already rung. At the start of the second round, Cro Cop was taken down, mounted and eventually submitted via armbar in the second round, suffering the first loss of his career.

====PRIDE 2004 Heavyweight Grand Prix and comeback====
After the loss to Nogueira, Cro Cop scored back to back first-round TKO&#x27;s of Ron Waterman and Yoshihisa Yamamoto. It was after these performances that he was drawn into the bracket of the 2004 Heavyweight Grand Prix. In what was seen as the biggest upset in recent history at the time, Cro Cop was KO&#x27;d by former UFC Heavyweight Champion Kevin Randleman at 1:57 of the very first round, being eliminated in the opening round of the tournament where he was favored to be a finalist or even win it all.

It was after this tournament that Cro Cop went on a seven fight win streak from 23 May 2004 until 26 June 2005. He began by fighting 1 month after the loss to Randleman, against Hiromitsu Kanehara, a seasoned RINGS veteran. Cro Cop won by a unanimous decision (the second decision victory of his career). He then knocked out Shungo Oyama 2 months later in 1 minute. A month after that, Cro Cop scored a head kick knockout 2 minutes into his fight with Alexander Emelianenko (brother of the champion). Staying busy, Cro Cop defeated former UFC Heavyweight Champion and reigning King of Pancrase Josh Barnett 2 months later at PRIDE 28, when Barnett injured his shoulder only 46 seconds into the fight. 2 months after that, Cro Cop avenged his loss to Randleman by guillotine choke at PRIDE&#x27;s new year show.

After defeating Randleman, Cro Cop stated that he wished to fight former UFC Heavyweight Champion and PRIDE 2000 Grand Prix Champion Mark Coleman. In the pre-fight interviews, Coleman repeatedly stated that he was going to take Cro Cop down and pound him out, while Cro Cop said there&#x27;s no way he would be taken down and that he would defeat Coleman. At PRIDE 29, Cro Cop stuffed every single one of Coleman&#x27;s take down attempts, staggered Coleman with straight lefts before knocking him out at 3:40 of the first round.

Cro Cop had defeated 3 former UFC Heavyweight champions back to back, and said in the ring after defeating Coleman:

I&#x27;m still standing, and I&#x27;m still waiting for a title fight. Emelianenko Fedor, you are next.

Cro Cop faced Emelianenko&#x27;s teammate, Ibragim Magomedov at PRIDE Critical Countdown 2005, winning by a body kick TKO in the 1st round (his 6th first round finish in a row). Emelianenko cornered Magomedov for this fight, and after the fight, stepped into the ring and shook hands with Cro Cop as the two posed with the championship belt. Cro Cop finally received a chance to fight Fedor for the Pride Heavyweight Championship. The highly anticipated match between Emelianenko and Cro Cop finally took place at PRIDE Final Conflict 2005.

====PRIDE title fight with Emelianenko====
In the first round, Cro Cop stunned and broke Emelianenko&#x27;s nose with two quick straight left hands. He discolored Fedor&#x27;s midsection with powerful body kicks. Emelianenko was then able to get the fight to the ground and land several body shots and, as the fight progressed, Emelianenko became more and more dominant, winning most of the stand up exchanges and scoring several takedowns. After 20 minutes, Emelianenko was awarded a unanimous decision victory. The fight was awarded fight of the year by mmafighting.com and fight of the decade by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

====Post-title shot and PRIDE 2006 Openweight Grand Prix====
After the loss to Emelianenko, Cro Cop defeated Josh Barnett at PRIDE 30 by a unanimous decision, and then dropped a split decision loss to hard hitting K-1 veteran Mark Hunt at PRIDE Shockwave 2005.

Coming into the 2006 Openweight Grand Prix, Cro Cop TKO&#x27;d two Japanese legends, Pancrase veteran Ikuhisa Minowa in the opening round, and 1992 Olympic Judo Gold Medalist Hidehiko Yoshida in the quarterfinal. On his 32nd birthday, he met Wanderlei Silva at Pride Final Conflict Absolute in the semi-finals, where he put on one of his best performances, defeating the Middleweight champion with his trademark head kick knockout.

This put him in the final against Josh Barnett, a fighter whom he would face for the third time in his career. After exchanging in the stand up, Cro Cop was able to posture in Barnett&#x27;s guard - landing many punches. At 7:32 of the first round, Barnett tapped to strikes, earning Cro Cop his first belt in his MMA career - the PRIDE 2006 Openweight Grand Prix championship. When PRIDE president Nobuyuki Sakakibara placed the belt around Cro Cop&#x27;s waist, Cro Cop broke down in tears and addressed the crowd in attendance, saying &quot;This is the happiest day in my life. It&#x27;s my 32nd birthday, and I want to thank all my fans in the arena, and all around the world for supporting me during my career. I love you, thank you.&quot;

Many have cited the performances that night as Cro Cop&#x27;s finest - leading Wanderlei Silva&#x27;s trainer, Rudimar Federigo to say, &quot;That was Mirko&#x27;s day. He fought two perfect fights and I believe even Fedor could lose to him on that night.&quot; Josh Barnett would later say - despite facing top fighters like Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira, Randy Couture, Frank Mir and Andrei Arlovski - that Cro Cop was the best fighter he ever faced in his career.

After winning the belt, Cro Cop revealed some more of his emotions behind the victory in the backstage interview with Frank Trigg,

All I can say is this is the happiest day of my life. Definitely. I was waiting for this for 10 long years and finally - I knew that I&#x27;m the best, but some circumstances just didn&#x27;t let me do that. To go to the end, and I proved to all the people who were talking that I&#x27;m finished, that I&#x27;m done after Fedor&#x27;s fight, that I am number one. Believe it or not, and I swear with everything I got, I told myself, &quot;If I don&#x27;t take this belt, it will be my last MMA fight in my life.&quot; I would quit fighting, I swear. And that&#x27;s why I said, &quot;now or never&quot;. And plus I was training like never before, and I was motivated, and I knew this is it.

There is no [bad] blood between us [myself and Silva.] I would like to know how he is, and I would like to shake hands with him. That&#x27;s all. I have nothing against him, really. But I told you before, he is just acting weird and he refused any kind of contact, but I&#x27;m not mad at Wanderlei, I don&#x27;t hate him. I respect him as a fighter, and I would like to see him if he&#x27;s still here.

I&#x27;m very happy, this is the day of my life, and I&#x27;m only sorry for one thing - that my father couldn&#x27;t live long enough to see my success. He died 12 years ago and I dedicate this belt for my father.

After his victory at the 2006 Openweight Grand Prix, a rematch between Cro Cop and Fedor Emelianenko failed to materialize and on 12 December 2006 Cro Cop pulled out of the New Year&#x27;s Eve event, citing both a foot injury and Emelianenko&#x27;s commitment to meet Mark Hunt at the card in question. Through his official website, Cro Cop revealed &quot;I still can&#x27;t kick like I want to. It&#x27;s the best that we give more time to this injury to heal. I want to be in perfect shape for my next fights.&quot;

Cro Cop has often been cited as being one member of the &quot;Holy Trinity of PRIDE&quot; (alongside Rodrigo Nogueira and Emelianenko.) These 3 heavyweights were considered anywhere between number 1–3 at any point in time between 2003 and 2007, and are often looked at as the &quot;golden age&quot; of MMA.

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===
In December 2006, rumors began to surface about Cro Cop entertaining offers from other mixed martial arts organizations; the Ultimate Fighting Championship was one of the promotions that Cro Cop confirmed came forward with an offer. Rumors continued to circulate about Cro Cop&#x27;s future with the Pride FC organization and media websites were reporting that Cro Cop had chosen the UFC for his future. It was announced during the pay-per-view of UFC 66 that Cro Cop indeed signed with the UFC.

====UFC debut====
Mirko made his UFC debut at UFC 67 on Saturday, 3 February - which featured fellow debutants and future UFC champions Quinton Jackson, Lyoto Machida and Frankie Edgar - stopping the undefeated prospect Eddie Sanchez by TKO at 4:33 of the very 1st round. Average betting for this fight was around -1200 for &quot;Cro Cop&quot; and +800 for Eddie Sanchez, the biggest gap for underdog/favorite in UFC history.

It has been speculated that the reason Cro Cop did not receive an immediate title shot - despite being ranked #2 across many media outlets - was due to his lack of popularity with the UFC audience.

====UFC title eliminator====
On 21 April 2007, Cro Cop faced Gabriel Gonzaga at &quot;UFC 70&quot; in Manchester, United Kingdom to determine who would challenge reigning champion Randy Couture for the heavyweight title. In what was seen as an upset by many in the MMA world, Gonzaga won with a head kick knockout at 4:51 of the 1st round.
Cro Cop later said about the fight, He hit me at least 10 or 15 times, clean shots to the head. It was a miracle that I didn&#x27;t start bleeding. Maybe it would have been better for me if he had cut me, as the referee would stop the fight. But when we stood up I saw 3 opponents. I was finished already. I took too many shots to the head. I was totally out of control. He threw a high kick, it landed on my head and that was it. But I&#x27;m a fighter and there&#x27;s no shame in falling down, only not to rise again. But that&#x27;s my life, you cannot win all the time. But of course the goal is that you must try [to always win]. It was my mistake. He did what he had to do. He had his plan and he threw too many elbows and I lost the fight and that&#x27;s it.

====End of first UFC stint====
Cro Cop&#x27;s next fight was on 8 September 2007 at &quot;UFC 75&quot; against French kickboxer Cheick Kongo, which he lost by unanimous decision with 29–28 on all three scorecards. There was some controversy, as Kongo landed 3 illegal groin strikes but was not even deducted a point. Cro Cop trained with Remy Bonjasky and Gilbert Yvel, and 2003 Abu Dhabi Combat Club champion grappler Dean Lister for this fight. Lister joined Cro Cop at his home town for a month to train for this upcoming bout. Cro Cop&#x27;s coach was Vos Gym&#x27;s main trainer and muay thai practitioner Ivan &quot;Hydro&quot; Hippolyte.

===Dream===
On 12 February 2008, Cro Cop announced a visit to Japan on his blog. With the foundation of the new MMA event, &#x27;Dream&#x27;, co-established by FEG running K-1 Hero&#x27;s and the former Yarennoka! organizing committee members which had managed Pride FC, Cro Cop officiates ending his career in UFC and the participation into the new event.

Fight Entertainment Group confirmed on 11 March 2008 that Cro Cop would face Tatsuya Mizuno at Dream 1 on 15 March at Saitama Super Arena, Saitama, Japan.

When asked about Cro Cop&#x27;s current contract status with the UFC and whether it would interfere with his participation in &#x27;Dream&#x27; events, Dream producer and front man Keiichi Sasahara said, &quot;Though I can&#x27;t share specific details about his contract, there will not be any foreseeable problems arising.&quot;

Cro Cop was vague in answering the question himself, qualifying his response by mentioning his intent to return to the UFC sometime in the future.Well, as you all know, I had a bad period in my last two fights, which I&#x27;d lost in the UFC, I don&#x27;t want anyone to think that I&#x27;m running away from the UFC, but I was thinking a lot about how to continue with my career, and I think in this moment, I think Dream is the right place for me.

Another thing is that I never liked fighting in the cage. I always liked to fight in the ring. The second thing is that I liked fighting in Japan. Japan is like my second home—I feel like I&#x27;m home in Japan. All those reasons [have brought me] here, and I&#x27;m very happy that I&#x27;m going to fight here in Japan. But of course, one day, I don&#x27;t know when, but definitely I&#x27;ll be back in the UFC to show that it was just a bad period for me. Now I&#x27;m fully recovered, physically and mentally, most important mentally.

On 23 September 2008, Cro Cop fought against Alistair Overeem at Dream 6. After almost half of the first round saw Overeem takedown Cro Cop twice and the two fighters exchanging stand-up and ground strikes (with Cro Cop sustaining a cut) the bout was stopped and declared a no contest due to Overeem landing multiple knees to the groin of Cro Cop, who stated after the match that he had wanted to continue to fight, as evident by his remaining in the ring, but the ringside doctor would not allow him to continue. His manager stated that the injury was not serious and that a rematch as soon as possible was sought. Cro Cop said that he was planning for a long fight and a KO towards the end. He expressed frustration and quoted &quot;I&#x27;m angry it ended this way, it seemed as if he was the dominant one, however, I wasn&#x27;t in trouble for a second and was waiting for my opportunities. I prepared very well because I thought the match could last a while. I thought I would knock him down in the end.&quot; In recording the fight, Cro Cop&#x27;s corner relayed to the announcers that his right testicle had been lodged inside of his body and that he could not continue. He later limped out of the arena.

===Return to the UFC===

On 18 May 2009, Cro Cop issued a press release on his official website and his MMAid account stating his scheduled return to the UFC. His first match upon returning was at UFC 99 in Germany against Mostapha al-Turk. During the bout, Cro Cop knocked down al-Turk with punches within the first round, then allowed him to stand. The fight ended when Cro Cop finished al-Turk with a flurry of punches that left al-Turk unable to defend himself. After the one-fight agreement with the UFC, it was announced Cro Cop was scheduled to return to Dream to face Siala &quot;Mighty Mo&quot; Siliga on 20 July at &quot;Dream.10&quot;. On 3 July 2009, it was reported that he might have re-signed with the UFC after getting an offer &quot;he couldn&#x27;t refuse&quot; by UFC co-owner Lorenzo Fertitta, who personally flew to Cro Cop&#x27;s residence in Zagreb. It was later confirmed at the UFC Fan Expo by Fertitta that Cro Cop had indeed signed a three-fight contract with the UFC.

Cro Cop fought up and coming striker Junior dos Santos at UFC 103. During the third round, Cro Cop sustained an uppercut to his left eye that caused him to submit by waving his hand at the referee and motioning that there was a problem with his eye. The fight was officially stopped due to submission, giving Dos Santos the win. After the fight, Cro Cop showed signs of frustration, stating, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel the hunger anymore. I started playing it safe, I&#x27;m not ready to take risks.&quot;

He hired legendary former Muay Thai champion Ivan Hippolyte and revamped his whole training team. Cro Cop was scheduled to face Ben Rothwell on 21 February 2010 at UFC 110. Just days before the fight, Rothwell was forced to withdraw from the event because of an illness. Australian fighter Anthony Perosh stepped in to replace Rothwell.

During the fight, Cro Cop dominated for two rounds before opening a cut on Perosh&#x27;s forehead which forced a doctor stoppage before the third round and awarded the TKO win to Cro Cop, who fought despite receiving a cut in training that required stitches.

Cro Cop next fought against fellow former Kickboxer Pat Barry at UFC 115 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. After being knocked down twice to the canvas in the first round by Barry&#x27;s strikes, he won the second round after utilizing his ground game. The third round saw Cro Cop open up with a head kick followed by an axe kick to Barry&#x27;s head. He ended the fight with a strong flurry, dropping Barry against the cage where he continued his assault with numerous punches to the face. He then took his back and defeated Barry by rear-naked choke, earning him &quot;Submission of the Night&quot; honors which Cro Cop had joked to Dana White and the crowd earlier that he deserved it. Prior to the Barry fight, Cro Cop was detained by Canadian officials, who threatened to deport him. He revealed that the Canadian officials had asked for details of his activities in the Lučko ATJ in which he had served, his service starting several years after the Croatian War of Independence. He was held for six hours.

Cro Cop faced former UFC heavyweight champion Frank Mir on 25 September 2010 at UFC 119, replacing an injured Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira. There was a brief scare the weekend before the fight when Cro Cop suffered an eye injury in Croatia during his final day of training, but upon arrival in the U.S., was medically cleared to compete.

Neither fighter managed to deliver any significant damage to the other until Cro Cop was defeated by Mir at 4:02 of the third round by KO due to a knee strike to the head. In a later interview for a Croatian television station, Cro Cop stated that he suffered a disc herniation three weeks before the fight with Mir. He decided not to inform the UFC about this injury because he believed it would seem as if he was trying to pull out of the fight.

Cro Cop was defeated by Ultimate Fighter alumnus Brendan Schaub on 19 March 2011, at UFC 128: Shogun vs. Jones by way of KO at 3:44 of the third round. Shortly after the knockout loss to Schaub, Dana White stated that Cro Cop is most likely retiring. Since this time, Dana White has appeared to have had a change of heart. In a recent interview, White said: &quot;This guy wants to fight again, and I owe him another fight.&quot; White also added &quot;Do I think he should have retired? Yeah,&quot; White said. &quot;But I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s in one of these situations like Chuck Liddell, who needed to retire right then. He&#x27;s a man, a grown man, and if he wants to continue to fight, that&#x27;s his right.&quot;

In his last fight with the UFC, Cro Cop was defeated by Roy Nelson at UFC 137 by TKO due to punches in round 3. Even though he looked to be in a good physical condition for the fight, he still didn&#x27;t look like the same fighter from his days in PRIDE FC. In an interview to a Croatian television station, Cro Cop revealed that he suffered an arm injury in training 10 days before the fight. Cro Cop said the injury came as a result of him sparring with Pat Barry and that the doctors told him he had to go into surgery because a tendon had separated from a bone, but he refused. He decided to go through with the fight without informing the UFC officials about his injury.

===Retirement from MMA and return to kickboxing===
Although he had not completely retired, Cro Cop considered that his days with the UFC, and possibly MMA, were finished. He announced that he would return to kickboxing to fight at &quot;Cro Cop Final Fight 2012&quot; at the Zagreb Arena on 10 March 2012. Mirko defeated Ray Sefo by unanimous decision.

Cro Cop fought on 27 May 2012 at K-1 World MAX 2012 World Championship Tournament Final 16 in Madrid, Spain against Loren Javier Jorge, winning by knockout in the second round with a left uppercut.

He faced Randy Blake at the &quot;K-1 World Grand Prix 2012 in Tokyo final 16&quot; on 14 October 2012. In the third round, after a break and restart, Cro Cop attempted to apologize for a late uppercut, failing to put his hands up to defend and leading to a straight punch by Blake that resulted in a knockdown. Despite this incident, Cro Cop was able to outfight the American en route to a majority decision win.

He was scheduled to fight at &quot;Cro Cop Final Fight 2013&quot; on 15 March 2013 in Zagreb, and expressed his desire to face Gökhan Saki. The event was then merged with the &quot;K-1 World Grand Prix 2012 Final&quot;, and was the first K-1 World Grand Prix held outside of Japan. He faced American boxer Jarrell Miller in the quarter-finals where the panel of judges awarded Cro Cop a unanimous decision due to Cro Cop landing more significant strikes. He advanced to the semi-finals where he outpointed Pavel Zhuravlev to another unanimous decision. In the final, he fought Ismael Londt and floored the Suriname fighter with his patented left high kick in round two en route to yet another unanimous decision victory to win the tournament, thirteen years after he had finished as runner-up in 1999.

He lost to Remy Bonjasky by a widely disputed majority decision in a rematch at &quot;Glory 14: Zagreb&quot; in Zagreb on 8 March 2014. He was set to rematch Pat Barry at &quot;Glory 17: Los Angeles&quot; in Inglewood, California on 21 June 2014 but Barry withdrew from the fight for undisclosed reasons and was replaced by Sergei Kharitonov. Kharitonov then also withdrew, however, and was replaced by Jarrell Miller. Cro Cop won the rematch, against Jarrell Miller, by unanimous decision.

===Return to MMA===
On 8 August 2012 news came that Cro Cop had said that he would like to return to MMA, and on 31 December 2012, he made his comeback against former sumo wrestler and MMA newcomer Shinichi Suzukawa at Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye 2012 in Tokyo, Japan. He won the fight by 
submission due to an armbar at 1:18 of the first round.

Cro Cop was expected to rematch with Alexander Emelianenko in October or November 2013 in Russia. On 25 October 2013, it was reported that Emelianenko had been accused of assaulting a 63-year-old man in a bar. The fight organizer terminated the contract with Emelianenko and announced that Cro Cop would face a different opponent from Russia. Cro Cop eventually faced Oleksiy Oliynyk, who replaced Emelianenko, on 8 November 2013 at Legends 2 in Moscow. He lost the fight by submission in the first round.

On 23 August 2014, Cro Cop defeated former 2008 Olympic judo gold medalist Satoshi Ishii via TKO (doctor stoppage) at an Inoki Genome Federation (IGF) event in Japan to win the IGF Championship.

Cro Cop was expected to fight Satoshi Ishii in a rematch on 31 December 2014 for the IGF Championship. However, the rematch was canceled due to a rib injury sustained by Ishii. Cro Cop stayed on the card and a new match up was being sought for a brief period. On 1 December, it was reported that Ishii would be able to heal up in time to take the fight, and the rematch was official once again. Cro Cop defeated Ishii via TKO, landing a head kick and follow up punches just as the second round was coming to a close. Ishii was unable to make it to his corner under his own power, forcing the referee to call an end to the fight. Following his return to UFC, Cro Cop was stripped of the IGF Championship on 23 January 2015.

===Retirement from kickboxing and third stint in the UFC===
On 20 January 2015, Bloody Elbow reported that Cro Cop had re-signed with the UFC. Days earlier, Bellator MMA CEO Scott Coker had expressed interest in signing the IGF champion. This would mark the fighter&#x27;s third stint with the promotion.

A rematch with Gabriel Gonzaga took place on 11 April 2015 at UFC Fight Night 64. After losing the first two rounds, Cro Cop landed an elbow in the clinch which rocked Gonzaga and finished the fight via TKO after landing multiple elbows and punches on the ground. The bout earned both men &quot;Fight of the Night&quot; bonus honors.

===Second retirement from MMA and anti-doping violation===
Cro Cop was expected to face Anthony Hamilton on 28 November 2015 at UFC Fight Night 79. However, on 10 November, it was announced that Cro Cop had pulled out of the fight and abruptly announced his retirement. Subsequently, on 11 November 2015, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) notified both Mirko Cro Cop and the UFC that he has been provisionally suspended due to a potential Anti-Doping Policy violation. The following day in a statement Cro Cop confirmed that he had used human growth hormone for his shoulder injury and had admitted this to the UFC. On 25 November, Cro Cop was suspended for two years by USADA retroactive to 9 November 2015. On 20 July 2016 UFC announced that it has terminated the remaining bouts of Cro Cop&#x27;s contract. Despite admitting to the use of hGH and plasma, it was later reported that Mirko Cro Cop&#x27;s USADA tests were negative. However, the 2-year suspension was not lifted, because he admitted to taking a prohibited substance.

===Second MMA return===
In July 2016, Cro Cop announced that he was ending his retirement and would return to mixed martial arts competition in Japan. He made his return with the Rizin Fighting Federation as part of a 16-man openweight tournament beginning 25 September 2016 in Tokyo.

====RIZIN====
Cro Cop defeated Korean Hyun Man Myung in the first round via an arm-triangle choke in the opening round of the tournament.

Cro Cop was scheduled to face Wanderlei Silva in a trilogy bout on 29 December in the Rizin Open Weight quarter finals. However, on 2 December, Silva withdrew from the bout.

Rizin announced that Cro Cop would then face Muhammed Lawal, who had just fought Satoshi Ishii on December 16 at Bellator 169. On 29 December, Cro Cop won the bout via TKO in the second round. Cro Cop handed Lawal his first loss at heavyweight, with Lawal being 9–0 as a heavyweight prior to this fight.

Cro Cop faced Baruto Kaito on 31 December 2016 in the Rizin Openweight Grand Prix Semifinals. He won the fight via knee to the body at 0:49 of the first round. Cro Cop then faced Amir Aliakbari in the final that same night. He won the fight via knockout to become the inaugural Rizin Openweight Grand Prix champion.

After winning the Grand Prix, he left the door open to a farewell fight, saying, &quot;It would be nice if I will be able to recover enough that I can have a farewell fight, maybe in Japan. It would be nice, but to tell you the truth I don&#x27;t know how the surgery will do.&quot;

Cro Cop mentioned in an interview on 20 October 2017 that he would like to rematch Fedor Emelianenko, and that he has several promotions contacting him for fights. He also addressed his injury situation, saying, &quot;I managed to repair my knee, I was among the first in Croatia to have the transplanted stem cells in my knee. My new cartilage has come in, it&#x27;s amazing! The future of medicine.&quot;

It was later announced on Sakakibara&#x27;s Instagram account that Cro Cop would return to fight in the RIZIN ring several more times. He faced Tsuyoshi Kohsaka on 31 December 2017 at Rizin World Grand Prix 2017: Final Round. Cro Cop won the fight via TKO early into the first round.

====Bellator MMA====
On 5 March 2018 it was announced that Cro Cop has signed with Bellator MMA. He was expected to debut on 25 May 2018 against Roy Nelson in a rematch at Bellator 200. However, the bout was scrapped during the week leading up to the event as Cro Cop pulled out of the fight citing an injury.

The rematch against Nelson eventually took place on 16 February 2019 at Bellator 216. Cro Cop was able to avenge his loss to Nelson, winning the fight by unanimous decision (30–27, 29–28, and 29–28). This was his tenth consecutive win and the eighth time in his career that he won a rematch.

On 1 March 2019, Filipovic announced his immediate retirement following a stroke he had after the fight with Nelson. Filipovic revealed he had previous neck issues which hindered his movement and balance and that physicians strictly forbade him to fight, fearing that a blow to the head might even render him paralyzed.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Hustle (2007)===
Aside from his kickboxing and mixed martial arts career, Cro Cop had a special appearance for professional wrestling promotion Hustle, which was owned by Dream Stage Entertainment along with Pride. During the New Year Hustle event on 31 December 2007, the babyface team of Ryoji Sai and Erica faced Kintaman and Kurodaman in a special &quot;Dynamite Hardcore Hustle Match&quot;, where the wrestlers could access to weapons by playing a slot machine. When Sai and Erica scored the maximum prize, Cro Cop came to the ring to help them as a &quot;living weapon.&quot; He executed a belly to belly suplex on Kurodaman and then hit Kintaman with his right high kick, knocking him out and allowing Erica to pin him, after which Cro Cop cut a promo with the winners. Despite the predetermined nature of the event, Cro Cop accidentally kicked Kintaman full force and caused him to be hospitalized.

==Fighting style==
A pure sprawl and brawl fighter, Cro Cop focused his game on his kickboxing acumen and skill to avoid being taken to the ground. He made use of powerful yet technical striking, epitomized by his famous left roundhouse kick to the head, sometimes combined with a fast left straight punch in order to open position. Despite the relative predictability of his technique, Cro Cop was able to hit it consistently by speed and timing, gaining 28 KO/TKO wins in his career, of which four were by head kick alone. Towards the end of his career, his signature left high kick became more and more anticipated by his opponents, with Cro Cop even saying once, &quot;Everybody is studying my fights. It&#x27;s harder and harder to land the high kick. Everybody is expecting the high kick. It&#x27;s much easier to do it at the beginning of your career.&quot;

On the other hand, his defense featured a signature left sidestep used to avoid his adversary&#x27;s lunges and a solid ability to sprawl, having stopped takedowns from Olympian caliber wrestlers such as Mark Coleman, Olympic judoka champions like Hidehiko Yoshida, wrestling champions like Kazuyuki Fujita or veteran wrestlers like Heath Herring and judoka and sambist Aleksander Emelianenko. Though always focused on striking, Cro Cop developed ground fighting skills over time, being adept in fighting from his back and recovering the standing position.

His persona has inspired many newer generation fighters, notably Demetrious Johnson, who once referred to Cro Cop after his record-breaking title defense, saying, &quot;There was a long time ago in PRIDE: (Mirko) &#x27;Cro-Cop&#x27; (Filipovic), it was his birthday, and he had that look on his face like nobody was going to take that championship away from him... That&#x27;s how I felt (Saturday). I felt like no one was going to take this away from me.&quot;

==Failed drug test==
On 25 November 2015, USADA announced that Filipović received a 2-year sanction for his anti-doping policy violations of the UFC Anti-Doping Policy. Filipović admitted to the use, attempted use, and possession of human growth hormone (hGH) following an out-of-competition test conducted on 4 November 2015, in Zagreb, Croatia. Though, the test results came back negative. However, his admission of guilt to UFC staff led to his USADA suspension. Filipović claimed he took HGH on a doctor&#x27;s advice to heal a shoulder injury.

==Personal life==
Cro Cop and his wife have two sons, Ivan and Filip.
In the 2004–05 season of the Croatian Second Football League, Cro Cop played for his hometown football club, HNK Cibalia, participating in the final 8 minutes of a match against HNK Vukovar.

Cro Cop is fluent in English.

===Film career===
Cro Cop starred in the 2005 action film &quot;Ultimate Force&quot; as Axon Rey.

===Political career===
Cro Cop was elected to the Croatian Parliament, where he served one term from 23 December 2003 to 11 January 2008. He was elected on a list for Social Democratic Party of Croatia from I electoral district.

<doc id="314834" wikidata="Q1981690" url="?curid=314834" title="Chrysanthemum Throne">
<text>The is the throne of the Emperor of Japan. The term also can refer to very specific seating, such as the throne in the Shishin-den at Kyoto Imperial Palace.

Various other thrones or seats that are used by the Emperor during official functions, such as those used in the Tokyo Imperial Palace or the throne used in the Speech from the Throne ceremony in the National Diet, are, however, not known as the &quot;Chrysanthemum Throne&quot;.

In a metonymic sense, the &quot;Chrysanthemum Throne&quot; also refers rhetorically to the head of state and the institution of the Japanese monarchy itself.

==History==
Japan is the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world. In much the same sense as the British Crown, the Chrysanthemum Throne is an abstract metonymic concept that represents the monarch and the legal authority for the existence of the government. Unlike its British counterpart, the concepts of Japanese monarchy evolved differently before 1947 when there was, for example, no perceived separation of the property of the nation-state from the person and personal holdings of the Emperor.

According to legend, the Japanese monarchy is said to have been founded in 660 BCE by Emperor Jimmu; Emperor Naruhito is the 126th monarch to occupy the Chrysanthemum Throne. The extant historical records only reach back to Emperor Ōjin, regarded as the 15th emperor, and who is considered to have reigned into the early 4th century. 
In the 1920s, then-Crown Prince Hirohito served as regent during several years of his father&#x27;s reign, when Emperor Taishō was physically unable to fulfill his duties. However, the Prince Regent lacked the symbolic powers of the throne which he could only attain after his father&#x27;s death.

The current Constitution of Japan considers the Emperor as &quot;the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people.&quot; The modern Emperor is a constitutional monarch. The metonymic meanings of &quot;Chrysanthemum Throne&quot; encompass the modern monarchy and the chronological list of legendary and historical monarchs of Japan.

==&quot;Takamikura&quot;==
The actual throne is located in the Kyoto Imperial Palace. It is the oldest surviving throne used by the monarchy. The current model was built for the enthronement ceremony of Emperor Taisho in 1912. It sits on an octagonal dais, above the floor. It is separated from the rest of the room by a curtain. The sliding door that hides the Emperor from view is called the , and has an image of 32 celestial saints painted upon it, which became one of the primary models for all of Heian period painting. The throne is used mainly for the enthronement ceremony, along with the twin throne . 

For the Enthronement of Emperors Akihito and Naruhito, both the Takamikura and Michodai thrones were taken apart, refurbished and reassembled at the Seiden State Hall of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo where the ceremonies are now held.

== Emperor&#x27;s throne in parliament ==

The emperor&#x27;s throne is a western-style Meiji period chair used in the House of Peers from 1868 until 1912. The emperor still uses the throne during ceremonies of the National Diet and for non-political statements. For example, he uses the throne during the Speech from the Throne ceremony in the House of Councillors. The ceremony opens ordinary Diet sessions (each January and after elections) and extra sessions (usually in autumn). 

The throne features real gold with details such as the 16 petal chrysanthemum seal, two lion heads, two phoenixes and the sun disc.

==Rhetorical usage==
This flexible English term is also a rhetorical trope. Depending on context, the Chrysanthemum Throne can be construed as a metonymy, which is a rhetorical device for an allusion relying on proximity or correspondence, as for example referring to actions of the Emperor as &quot;actions of the Chrysanthemum Throne.&quot; e.g.,

* referring to a part with the name of the whole, such as &quot;Chrysanthemum Throne&quot; for the mystic process of transferring Imperial authority—as in:
: 18 December 876 (&quot;Jōgan 18, on the 29th day of the 11th month&quot;): In the , he ceded the Chrysanthemum Throne to his son, which meant that the young child received the succession. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Yōzei is said to have formally acceded to the throne.

* referring to the whole with the name of a part, such as &quot;Chrysanthemum Throne&quot; for the serial symbols and ceremonies of enthronement—as in:
: 20 January 877 (&quot;Gangyō 1, on the 3rd day of the 1st month&quot;) Yōzei was formally installed on the Chrysanthemum Throne; and the beginning of a new &quot;nengō&quot; was proclaimed.

* referring to the general with the specific, such as &quot;Chrysanthemum Throne&quot; for Emperorship or &quot;senso&quot;—as in:
:Before Emperor Yōzei ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was .

* referring to the specific with the general, such as &quot;Chrysanthemum Throne&quot; for the short reign of Emperor Yōzei or equally as well for the ambit of the Imperial system.

During the 2007 state visit by the Emperor and Empress of Japan to the United Kingdom, the &quot;Times&quot; reported that &quot;last night’s dinner was as informal as it could get when the House of Windsor entertains the Chrysanthemum Throne.&quot;

<doc id="314841" wikidata="Q1788760" url="?curid=314841" title="Edward Foxe">
<text>Edward Foxe (c. 1496 – 8 May 1538) was an English churchman, Bishop of Hereford. He played a major role in Henry VIII&#x27;s divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and he assisted in drafting the &quot;Ten Articles&quot; of 1536.

==Early life==
He was born at Dursley in Gloucestershire, and may have been related to Richard Fox, Bishop of Exeter and Lord Privy Seal under King Henry VII. Foxe was educated at Eton College and at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. After graduating in 1520, he was made secretary to Cardinal Wolsey in 1527. In 1528 he was sent with Bishop Stephen Gardiner to Rome to obtain from Pope Clement VII a decretal commission for the trial and decision of the case between King Henry VIII and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon.

==Academic career==
Foxe served as Provost of King&#x27;s College from 22 September 1528 until 8 May 1538, and in August 1529 was the means of conveying to the king Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s historic advice that he should apply to the universities of Europe rather than to the pope. After a brief mission to Paris in October 1529, Foxe in January 1530 befriended Hugh Latimer at Cambridge and took an active part in persuading the English universities to decide in the king&#x27;s favour. He was sent to employ similar methods of persuasion at the French universities in 1530–1531, and was also engaged in negotiating a closer league between England and France.

==Clerical career==
Foxe served as the king&#x27;s almoner c. 1532 – 1537, and as prolocutor of convocation in April 1533 when it decided against the validity of Henry&#x27;s marriage with Catherine. In 1534 he published his treatise &quot;De vera differentia regiae potestatis et ecclesiae,&quot; defending the Royal Supremacy by use of the documents collated in the &quot;Collectanea satis copiosa&quot;. Various ecclesiastical preferments were now granted him, including the archdeaconry of Leicester (1531–1535), the archdeaconry of Dorset (1533–1535), the deanery of Salisbury (1533) and the bishopric of Hereford (1535). He was nominated to the See of Hereford on 20 August 1535, elected by the college of Hereford on 25 August, confirmed on 15 September, and ordained a bishop on 26 September 1535; he received the temporalities on 7 September and the spiritualities on 14 October 1535.

In 1535–36 he was sent to Germany to discuss the basis of a political and theological understanding with the Lutheran princes and divines, and had several interviews with Martin Luther, who could not be persuaded of the justice of Henry VIII&#x27;s divorce. Henry was unwilling to endorse the Augsburg Confession and, in 1536, the Wittenberg articles were drafted by Foxe and Lutheran clergymen as a compromise. The articles met strong opposition within convocation in June of the same year, leading Henry to personally intervene to bring about an agreement. This led to the drafting and passing of the Ten Articles by convocation. In 1536, Martin Bucer dedicated his &quot;Commentaries on the Gospels&quot; to Foxe.

==Death and legacy==
Foxe died on 8 May 1538 and was buried in the church of St Mary Mounthaw, London. Foxe is credited with the authorship of several proverbial sayings, such as &quot;the surest way to peace is a constant preparedness for war&quot; and &quot;time and I will challenge any two in the world.&quot; However, the former is a paraphrase of &quot;si vis pacem, para bellum&quot;, while the latter is more usually ascribed to Philip II of Spain.

<doc id="314842" wikidata="Q41071" url="?curid=314842" title="Gangwon Province, South Korea">
<text>Gangwon Province (), officially Gangwon State (), is a Special Self-Governing Province of South Korea. It is known as the largest and least densely populated subdivision of South Korea. Gangwon is one of the three provinces in South Korea with special self-governing status, the others being Jeju Province and Jeonbuk State. Gangwon is bordered on the east by the Sea of Japan, it borders Gyeonggi Province to the west, North Gyeongsang Province and North Chungcheong Province to the south, and the Military Demarcation Line to the north, separating it from North Korea. In the 1945 division of Korea, the historical Gangwon Province was divided in half, and remains so to this day.

Pyeongchang County in Gangwon hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics and 2018 Winter Paralympics. Gangwon also hosted the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics.

==History==
Gangwon Province was one of the Eight Provinces of Korea during the Joseon period, formed in 1395, deriving its name from the names of the principal cities of Gangneung () and the provincial capital Wonju ().

In 1895 Gangwon Province was replaced by the Districts of Chuncheon (&quot;Chuncheon-bu;&quot; ) in the west and Gangneung (&quot;Gangneung-bu;&quot; ) in the east, with Wonju becoming a part of Chungju District.

In 1896 Korea was re-divided into thirteen provinces, and the two districts were merged to re-form Gangwondo Province. Although Wonju re-joined Gangwon-do, the provincial capital was moved to Chuncheon, where it remains. During the Japanese rule of Korea, it was known as Kōgen-dō.

In 1945 Gangwon Province, along with the rest of Korea, was divided by the 38th parallel north in 1945, to create American and Soviet zones of occupation in the south and north respectively, leading to Wonsan joining the northern half in 1946 to serve as its administrative center. In 1948, the southern half of the province became part of the new South Korea. As a result of the Korean War of 1953, the boundary between the South and North Korean portions of the province was shifted north, to the Military Demarcation Line.

On June 11, 2023, Gangwon Province became a special self-governing province, and the official English name is Gangwon State. Despite calling itself a state, Gangwon State is considered a self-governing province, not a self-governing state.

==Geography==

===Landscape===
The State&#x27;s landscape is dominated by the Taebaek Mountains (called &quot;Taebaek Sanmaek&quot;) which almost reach the sea. As a consequence, much of the coast is steep and rocky.

===Regions===
Gangwon Province and its North Korean counterpart Kangwŏn are together referred to as the Gwandong region. The region west of the Taebaek Mountains is called Yeongseo, while the region east of the mountains is called Yeongdong. The term &quot;Yeongdong&quot; is frequently used in reference to transportation services from Seoul, meaning one might catch a bus or train on the Yeongdong Line, or drive to Gangneung on the Yeongdong Expressway.

=== Climate ===
Gangwon Province&#x27;s Köppen climate classification&#x27;s climate class is occasionally humid subtropical, because in some of its areas, especially in most of Yeongdong, it is Cfa, otherwise, its climate class is Hot-summer humid continental climate, because it is Dwb in some mountain areas, Dfa in eastern areas, Dfb in eastern mountain areas, and Dwa otherwise. The Taebaek Mountains create different climates in Yeongdong and Yeongseo.

The climate of Gangwon Province is influenced by its latitude. It has four seasons, with hot and humid summers, and cold, snowy winters. According to the Korea Meteorological Administration&#x27;s data, average temperatures vary. In Yongdong, the average temperature is , and in Yeongseo, it is . All of the province&#x27;s average temperatures range from . and the yearly amount of rainfall is , concentrated on mountain areas, being one of the snowiest areas in South Korea.

=== Resources ===
The area of Gangwon Province in both North Korea and South Korea is , with South Korea&#x27;s Gangwon-do covering . The province is renowned for its agricultural produce, especially potatoes and fish, including cuttlefish and pollock. Mineral resources from the province include iron, coal, fluorite, limestone and tungsten. There are some hydroelectric, thermoelectric power plants in the region.

==Demographics==
According to the 2015 census, 16.4% of the population follow Buddhism and 24.1% follow Christianity (17.5% Protestantism and 6.6% Catholicism). 58.7% of the population is not religious and 0.8% of the population follow other religions. 

== Culture and heritage ==
=== Heritage ===
It is not known exactly when human settlement in what is now Gangwon Province began, but Paleolithic sites have been excavated.

Many historical artifacts are found in the region, like the Later Silla era&#x27;s Bell of Sangwonsa, the North–South States Period era&#x27;s Iron Seated Vairocana Buddha of Dopiansa Temple, the Goryeo era&#x27;s Main Gate of Imyeonggwan Guesthouse, and the Joseon era&#x27;s Documents of Sangwonsa Temple. Other popular historical areas, like Ojukheon are located in the region.

Because of Gangwon Province&#x27;s landscape, a number of old Buddhist temples have survived, like Woljeongsa and Oseam.

=== Museums ===
Established in 2002, the Chuncheon National Museum is operated by the central government for the purpose of classification and reservation. The local government also has museums, including the Park Su-geun Art Museum, and the Taebaek Coal Museum. Purpose-built private museums, such as the ChamSori Gramophone Edison Museum are also operated.

=== Festivals ===
In Gangwon Province, almost all of the regions hold festivals. Gangneung Danoje was listed in UNESCO&#x27;s Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

Geographically, Gangwon Province has several national parks as well as some natural monuments.

=== Food ===
Gangwon Province is composed of mountains or basins, so locals mainly make food with potatoes or buckwheat. All regions of the province have seasoned vegetable rice. For example, Jeongseon County is famous for Jeongseon thistle rice; Yeongwol County is famous for Yeongwol buckwheat rolls; Hwacheon County is famous for Hwacheon trout rice in a stone bowl and Hwacheon goatsbeard rice; and Yanggu County is famous for Yanggu dried green radish cuisine. In coastal regions, fish and salted seafood is consumed. For example, Donghae is famous for Donghae steamed fish; Sokcho is famous for Sokcho Squid Sausages; and Samcheok is famous for blowfish soup. These are normally very simple and easy to cook, like the province&#x27;s traditional food.

<doc id="314843" wikidata="Q2328983" url="?curid=314843" title="Campaign history of the Roman military">
<text>From its origin as a city-state on the peninsula of Italy in the 8th century BC, to its rise as an empire covering much of Southern Europe, Western Europe, Near East and North Africa to its fall in the 5th century AD, the political history of Ancient Rome was closely entwined with its military history. The core of the campaign history of the Roman military is an aggregate of different accounts of the Roman military&#x27;s land battles, from its initial defense against and subsequent conquest of the city&#x27;s hilltop neighbors on the Italian peninsula, to the ultimate struggle of the Western Roman Empire for its existence against invading Huns, Vandals and Germanic tribes. These accounts were written by various authors throughout and after the history of the Empire. Following the First Punic War, naval battles were less significant than land battles to the military history of Rome due to its encompassment of lands of the periphery and its unchallenged dominance of the Mediterranean Sea.

The Roman army battled first against its tribal neighbours and Etruscan towns within Italy, and later came to dominate the Mediterranean and at its height the provinces of Britannia and Asia Minor. As with most ancient civilizations, Rome&#x27;s military served the triple purpose of securing its borders, exploiting peripheral areas through measures such as imposing tribute on conquered peoples, and maintaining internal order. From the outset, Rome&#x27;s military typified this pattern, and the majority of Rome&#x27;s campaigns were characterised by one of two types. The first is the territorial expansionist campaign, normally begun as a counter-offensive, in which each victory brought subjugation of large areas of territory and allowed Rome to grow from a small town to a population of 55 million in the early empire when expansion was halted. The second is the civil war, which plagued Rome from its foundation to its eventual demise.

Despite their formidable reputation and host of victories, Roman armies were not invincible. Romans &quot;produced their share of incompetents&quot; who led Roman armies into catastrophic defeats. Nevertheless, it was generally the fate of even the greatest of Rome&#x27;s enemies, such as Pyrrhus and Hannibal, to win the battle but lose the war. The history of Rome&#x27;s campaigning is, if nothing else, a history of obstinate persistence overcoming appalling losses.

==Kingdom (753–509 BC)==

Knowledge of Roman history stands apart from other civilizations in the ancient world. Its chronicles, military and otherwise, document the city&#x27;s very foundation to its eventual demise. Although some histories have been lost, such as Trajan&#x27;s account of the Dacian Wars, and others, such as Rome&#x27;s earliest histories, are at least semi-apocryphal, the extant histories of Rome&#x27;s military history are extensive.

Rome&#x27;s earliest history, from the time of its founding as a small tribal village, to the downfall of its kings, is the least well preserved. Although the early Romans were literate to some degree, this void may be due to the lack of will to record their history at that time, or such histories as they did record were lost.

Although the Roman historian Livy (59 BC – 17 AD) lists a series of seven kings of early Rome in his work &quot;Ab urbe condita&quot;, from its establishment through its earliest years, the first four kings (Romulus, Numa, Tullus Hostilius and Ancus Marcius) may be apocryphal. A number of points of view have been proposed. Grant and others argue that prior to the establishment of the Etruscan kingdom of Rome under the traditional fifth king, Tarquinius Priscus, Rome would have been led by a religious leader of some sort. Very little is known of Rome&#x27;s military history from this era, and what history has come down to us is more legendary than factual. Traditionally, Romulus fortified the Palatine Hill after founding the city, and shortly thereafter Rome was &quot;equal to any of the surrounding cities in her prowess in war&quot;.

The first of the campaigns fought by the Romans in this legendary account are the wars with various Latin cities and the Sabines. According to Livy, the Latin village of Caenina responded to the event of the abduction of the Sabine women by invading Roman territory, but were routed and their village captured. The Latins of Antemnae and those of Crustumerium were defeated next in a similar fashion. The remaining main body of the Sabines attacked Rome and briefly captured the citadel, but were then convinced to conclude a treaty with the Romans under which the Sabines became Roman citizens.

There was a further war in the 8th century BC against Fidenae and Veii. In the 7th century BC there was a war with Alba Longa, a second war with Fidenae and Veii and a second Sabine War. Ancus Marcius led Rome to victory against the Latins and, according to the Fasti Triumphales, over the Veientes and Sabines also.

===Tarquinius Priscus (Ruled 616–579 BC)===
Lucius Tarquinius Priscus&#x27; first war was waged against the Latins. Tarquinius took the Latin town of Apiolae by storm and took great booty from there back to Rome. According to the &quot;Fasti Triumphales&quot;, the war occurred prior to 588 BC.

His military ability was tested by an attack from the Sabines. Tarquinius doubled the numbers of equites to help the war effort, and defeat the Sabines. In the peace negotiations that followed, Tarquinius received the town of Collatia and appointed his nephew, Arruns Tarquinius, also known as &quot;Egerius&quot;, as commander of the garrison which he stationed in that city. Tarquinius returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph for his victories that, according to the &quot;Fasti Triumphales&quot;, occurred on 13 September 585 BC.

Subsequently, the Latin cities of Corniculum, old Ficulea, Cameria, Crustumerium, Ameriola, Medullia and Nomentum were subdued and became Roman.

===Servius Tullius (Ruled 578–535 BC)===
Early in his reign, Servius Tullius warred against Veii and the Etruscans. He is said to have shown valour in the campaign, and to have routed a great army of the enemy. The war helped him to cement his position at Rome. According to the &quot;Fasti Triumphales&quot;, Servius celebrated three triumphs over the Etruscans, including on 25 November 571 BC and 25 May 567 BC (the date of the third triumph is not legible on the &quot;Fasti&quot;).

===Tarquinius Superbus (Ruled 535–509 BC)===
Early in his reign Tarquinius Superbus, Rome&#x27;s seventh and final king, called a meeting of the Latin leaders at which he persuaded them to renew their treaty with Rome and become her allies rather than her enemies, and it was agreed that the troops of the Latins would attend at a grove sacred to the goddess Ferentina on an appointed day to form a united military force with the troops of Rome. This was done, and Tarquin formed combined units of Roman and Latin troops.

Tarquin next began a war against the Volsci. He took the wealthy town of Suessa Pometia, with the spoils of which he commenced the erection of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus which his father had vowed. He also celebrated a triumph for his victory.

He was next engaged in a war with Gabii, one of the Latin cities, which had rejected the Latin treaty with Rome. Unable to take the city by force of arms, Tarquin had his son, Sextus Tarquinius, infiltrate the city, gain the trust of its people and command of its army. In time he killed or exiled the city&#x27;s leaders, and handed control of the city over to his father.

Tarquin also agreed to a peace with the Aequi, and renewed the treaty of peace between Rome and the Etruscans. According to the Fasti Triumphales, Tarquin also won a victory over the Sabines.

Tarquinius later went to war with the Rutuli. According to Livy, the Rutuli were, at that time, a very wealthy nation. Tarquinius was desirous of obtaining the booty which would come with victory over the Rutuli. Tarquin unsuccessfully sought to take the Rutulian capital, Ardea, by storm, and subsequently began an extensive siege of the city. The war was interrupted by the revolution which overthrew the Roman monarchy. The Roman army, camped outside Ardea, welcomed Lucius Junius Brutus as their new leader, and expelled the king&#x27;s sons. It is unclear what was the outcome of the siege, or indeed the war.

==Republic==

===Early (509–275 BC)===

====Early Italian campaigns (509–396 BC)====
The first non-apocryphal Roman wars were wars of both expansion and defence, aimed at protecting Rome itself from neighbouring cities and nations and establishing its territory in the region. Florus writes that at this time &quot;their neighbours, on every side, were continually harassing them, as they had no land of their own ... and as they were situated, as it were, at the junction of the roads to Latium and Etruria, and, at whatever gate they went out, were sure to meet a foe.&quot;

In the semi-legendary period of the early republic, sources record Rome was twice attacked by Etruscan armies. About 509 BC war with Veii and Tarquinii was said to have been instigated by the recently overthrown king Tarquinius Superbus. Again in 508 BC Tarquin persuaded the king of Clusium, Lars Porsenna, to wage war on Rome, resulting in a siege of Rome and afterwards a peace treaty.

Initially, Rome&#x27;s immediate neighbours were either Latin towns and villages on a tribal system similar to that of Rome, or else tribal Sabines from the Apennine hills beyond. One by one, Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities that were either under Etruscan control or else Latin towns that had cast off their Etruscan rulers, as had Rome. Rome defeated the Lavinii and Tusculi in the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 BC, were defeated by the Veientes in the Battle of the Cremera in 477 BC, defeated the Sabines in an unnamed battle in 449 BC, the Aequi in the Battle of Mount Algidus in 458 BC, the Aequi and Volsci in 446 BC, in the Battle of Corbio, in 446 BC the Aurunci in the Battle of Aricia, the Capture of Fidenae in 435 BC and the Siege of Veii in 396 BC, and the Capture of Antium in 377 BC. After defeating the Veientes, the Romans had effectively completed the conquest of their immediate Etruscan neighbours, as well as secured their position against the immediate threat posed by the tribespeople of the Apennine hills. In the meantime, it also affected the agriculture as well as diet regime of the empire. Since the enlargement the population in Apennine peninsula had increased and led to certain changes in agriculture, such as switch to goat breeding from cattle, indicating higher levels of protein supply in the diet which played a crucial role in stature of the locals.

However, Rome still controlled only a very limited area and the affairs of Rome were minor even to those in Italy and Rome&#x27;s affairs were only just coming to the attention of the Greeks, the dominant cultural force at the time. At this point the bulk of Italy remained in the hands of Latin, Sabine, Samnite and other peoples in the central part of Italy, Greek colonies to the south, and the Celtic people, including the Gauls, to the north.

====Celtic invasion of Italia (390–387 BC)====

By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes had begun invading Italy from the north as their culture expanded throughout Europe. Most of this was unknown to the Romans at this time, who still had purely local security concerns, but the Romans were alerted when a particularly warlike tribe, the Senones, invaded the Etruscan province of Siena from the north and attacked the town of Clusium, not far from Rome&#x27;s sphere of influence. The Clusians, overwhelmed by the size of the enemy in numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. Perhaps unintentionally the Romans found themselves not just in conflict with the Senones, but their primary target. The Romans met them in pitched battle at the Battle of the Allia around 390–387 BC. The Gauls, under their chieftain Brennus, defeated the Roman army of around 15,000 troops and proceeded to pursue the fleeing Romans back to Rome itself and partially sacked the town before being either driven off or bought off. They were probably defeated by the exiled dictator Marcus Furius Camillus who gathered the scattered Roman forces that consisted partly of fugitives and partly those who had survived the battle of Alia, and marched to Rome. According to tradition, he took the Gauls by surprise, when Brennus, having tricked the weights in which the gold rescue that had been set for the city was measured, uttered the expression Vae Victis! (Woe to the losers!); Camillus claimed that, since he was a dictator, no agreement was valid without his acquiescence, so no ransom was due and he answered Breno with another famous phrase: &#x27;Non auro sed ferro liberanda est patria&#x27; (It is with iron, not with gold, how the homeland is released). After defeating the Gauls in the subsequent battle, he entered the city in triumph, greeted by his fellow citizens as alter Romulus (the other Romulus), pater patriae (father of the homeland) and conditor alter urbis (second founder of the city).

Now that the Romans and Gauls had blooded one another, intermittent Roman-Gallic wars were to continue between the two in Italy for more than two centuries, including the Battle of Lake Vadimo, the Battle of Faesulae in 225 BC, the Battle of Telamon in 224 BC, the Battle of Clastidium in 222 BC, the Battle of Cremona in 200 BC, the Battle of Mutina in 194 BC, the Battle of Arausio in 105 BC, the Battle of Aquae Sextiae in 102 BC, and the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC. The Celtic problem would not be resolved for Rome until the final subjugation of all Gaul following the Battle of Alesia in 52 BC.

====Expansion into Italia (343–282 BC)====


After swiftly recovering from the sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. Despite their successes, their mastery of the whole of Italy was by no means assured. The Samnites were a people just as martial and as rich as the Romans and had the objective of their own to secure more lands in the fertile Italian plains on which Rome itself lay. The First Samnite War of between 343 BC and 341 BC that followed widespread Samnite incursions into Rome&#x27;s territory was a relatively short affair: the Romans beat the Samnites in both the Battle of Mount Gaurus in 342 BC and the Battle of Suessula in 341 BC but were forced to withdraw from the war before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War.

Rome was therefore forced to contend by around 340 BC against both Samnite incursions into their territory and, simultaneously, in a bitter war against their former allies. Rome bested the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius and again in the Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule. Perhaps due to Rome&#x27;s lenient treatment of their defeated foe, the Latins submitted largely amicably to Roman rule for the next 200 years.

The Second Samnite War, from 327 BC to 304 BC, was a much longer and more serious affair for both the Romans and Samnites, running for over twenty years and incorporating twenty-four battles that led to massive casualties on both sides. The fortunes of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course: the Samnites seized Neapolis in the Capture of Neapolis in 327 BC, which the Romans then re-captured before losing at the Battle of the Caudine Forks and the Battle of Lautulae. The Romans then proved victorious at the Battle of Bovianum and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to sue for peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies. This pattern of meeting aggression in force and so inadvertently gaining territory in strategic counter-attacks was to become a common feature of Roman military history.

Seven years after their defeat, with Roman dominance of the area looking assured, the Samnites rose again and defeated the Romans at the Battle of Camerinum in 298 BC, to open the Third Samnite War. With this success in hand they managed to bring together a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome, all of whom were probably keen to prevent any one faction dominating the entire region. The army that faced the Romans at the Battle of Sentinum in 295 BC included Samnites, Gauls, Etruscans and Umbrians. When the Roman army won a convincing victory over these combined forces it must have become clear that little could prevent Roman dominance of Italy and in the Battle of Populonia (282 BC) Rome destroyed the last vestiges of Etruscan power in the region.

====Pyrrhic War (280–275 BC)====
By the beginning of the 3rd century Rome had established itself as a major power on the Italian Peninsula, but had not yet come into conflict with the dominant military powers in the Mediterranean at the time: Carthage and the Greek kingdoms. Rome had all but completely defeated the Samnites, mastered its fellow Latin towns, and greatly reduced Etruscan power in the region. However, the south of Italy was controlled by the Greek colonies of Magna Grecia who had been allied to the Samnites, and continued Roman expansion brought the two into inevitable conflict.

In the naval Battle of Thurii, Tarentum appealed for military aid to Pyrrhus, ruler of Epirus. Motivated by his diplomatic obligations to Tarentum, and a personal desire for military accomplishment, Pyrrhus landed a Greek army of some 25,000 men and a contingent of war elephants on Italian soil in 280 BC, where his forces were joined by some Greek colonists and a portion of the Samnites who revolted against Roman control, taking up arms against Rome for the fourth time in seventy years.

The Roman army had not yet seen elephants in battle, and their inexperience turned the tide in Pyrrhus&#x27; favour at the Battle of Heraclea in 280 BC, and again at the Battle of Ausculum in 279 BC. Despite these victories, Pyrrhus found his position in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus as long as his army remained in Italy. Furthermore, Rome entered into a treaty of support with Carthage, and Pyrrhus found that despite his expectations, none of the other Italic peoples would defect to the Greek and Samnite cause. Facing unacceptably heavy losses with each encounter with the Roman army, and failing to find further allies in Italy, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula and campaigned in Sicily against Carthage, abandoning his allies to deal with the Romans.

When his Sicilian campaign was also ultimately a failure, and at the request of his Italian allies, Pyrrhus returned to Italy to face Rome once more. In 275 BC, Pyrrhus again met the Roman army at the Battle of Beneventum. This time the Romans had devised methods to deal with the war elephants, including the use of javelins, fire and, one source claims, simply hitting the elephants heavily on the head. While Beneventum was indecisive, Pyrrhus realised that his army had been exhausted and reduced by years of foreign campaigns, and seeing little hope for further gains, he withdrew completely from Italy.

The conflicts with Pyrrhus would have a great effect on Rome. It had shown that it was capable of pitting its armies successfully against the dominant military powers of the Mediterranean, and further showed that the Greek kingdoms were incapable of defending their colonies in Italy and abroad. Rome quickly moved into southern Italia, subjugating and dividing Magna Grecia. Effectively dominating the Italian peninsula, and with a proven international military reputation, Rome now began to look to expand from the Italian mainland. Since the Alps formed a natural barrier to the north, and Rome was none too keen to meet the fierce Gauls in battle once more, the city&#x27;s gaze turned to Sicily and the islands of the Mediterranean, a policy that would bring it into direct conflict with its former ally Carthage.

===Middle (274–148 BC)===
Rome first began to make war outside the Italian peninsula during the Punic wars against Carthage, a former Phoenician colony that had established on the north coast of Africa and developed into a powerful state. These wars, starting in 264 BC were probably the largest conflicts of the ancient world yet and saw Rome become the most powerful state of the Western Mediterranean, with territory in Sicily, North Africa, Iberia, and with the end of the Macedonian wars (which ran concurrently with the Punic wars) Greece as well. After the defeat of the Seleucid Emperor Antiochus III the Great in the Roman-Syrian War (Treaty of Apamea, 188 BC) in the eastern sea, Rome emerged as the dominant Mediterranean power and the most powerful city in the classical world.

====Punic Wars (264–146 BC)====

The First Punic War began in 264 BC when settlements on Sicily began to appeal to the two powers between which they lay – Rome and Carthage – in order to solve internal conflicts. The willingness of both Rome and Carthage to become embroiled on the soil of a third party may indicate a willingness to test each other&#x27;s power without wishing to enter a full war of annihilation; certainly there was considerable disagreement within Rome about whether to prosecute the war at all. The war saw land battles in Sicily early on, such as the Battle of Agrigentum, but the theatre shifted to naval battles around Sicily and Africa. For the Romans, naval warfare was a relatively unexplored concept. Before the First Punic War in 264 BC there was no Roman navy to speak of, as all previous Roman wars had been fought on land in Italy. The new war in Sicily against Carthage, a great naval power, forced Rome to quickly build a fleet and train sailors.

Rome took to naval warfare &quot;like a brick to water&quot; and the first few naval battles of the First Punic War such as the Battle of the Lipari Islands were catastrophic disasters for Rome, as might fairly be expected from a city that had no real prior experience of naval warfare. However, after training more sailors and inventing a grappling engine known as a Corvus, a Roman naval force under C. Duillius was able to roundly defeat a Carthaginian fleet at the Battle of Mylae. In just four years, a state without any real naval experience had managed to better a major regional maritime power in battle. Further naval victories followed at the Battle of Tyndaris and the Battle of Cape Ecnomus.

After having won control of the seas, a Roman force landed on the African coast under Marcus Regulus, who was at first victorious, winning the Battle of Adys and forcing Carthage to sue for peace. However, the terms of peace that Rome proposed were so heavy that negotiations failed, and in response, the Carthaginians hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a mercenary from the martial Greek city-state of Sparta, to reorganise and lead their army. Xanthippus managed to cut off the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy and then defeated and captured Regulus at the Battle of Tunis.

Despite being defeated on African soil, the Romans with their newfound naval abilities, roundly beat the Carthaginians in naval battle again – largely through the tactical innovations of the Roman fleet – at the Battle of the Aegates Islands. Carthage was left without a fleet or sufficient coin to raise a new one. For a maritime power, the loss of their access to the Mediterranean stung financially and psychologically, and the Carthaginians again sued for peace, during which negotiations, Rome battled the &quot;Ligures&quot; tribe in the Ligurian War and the &quot;Insubres&quot; in the Gallic War.

Continuing distrust led to the renewal of hostilities in the Second Punic War when Hannibal, a member of the Barcid family of Carthaginian nobility, attacked Saguntum, a city with diplomatic ties to Rome. Hannibal then raised an army in Iberia and famously crossed the Italian Alps with elephants to invade Italy. In the first battle on Italian soil at Ticinus in 218 BC Hannibal defeated the Romans under Scipio the Elder in a small cavalry fight. Hannibal&#x27;s success continued with victories in the Battle of the Trebia, the Battle of Lake Trasimene, where he ambushed an unsuspecting Roman army, and the Battle of Cannae, in what is considered one of the great masterpieces of tactical art, and for a while &quot;Hannibal seemed invincible&quot;, able to beat Roman armies at will.

In the three battles of Nola, Roman general Marcus Claudius Marcellus managed to hold off Hannibal but then Hannibal smashed a succession of Roman consular armies at the First Battle of Capua, the Battle of the Silarus, the Second Battle of Herdonia, the Battle of Numistro and the Battle of Asculum. By this time Hannibal&#x27;s brother Hasdrubal Barca sought to cross the Alps into Italy and join his brother with a second army. Despite being defeated in Iberia in the Battle of Baecula, Hasdrubal managed to break through into Italy only to be defeated decisively by Gaius Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius Salinator on the Metaurus River.

Unable to defeat Hannibal himself on Italian soil, and with Hannibal savaging the Italian countryside but unwilling or unable to destroy Rome itself, the Romans boldly sent an army to Africa with the intention of threatening the Carthaginian capital. In 203 BC at the Battle of Bagbrades the invading Roman army under Scipio Africanus Major defeated the Carthaginian army of Hasdrubal Gisco and Syphax and Hannibal was recalled to Africa. At the famous Battle of Zama Scipio decisively defeated – perhaps even &quot;annihilated&quot; – Hannibal&#x27;s army in North Africa, ending the Second Punic War.

Carthage never managed to recover after the Second Punic War and the Third Punic War that followed was in reality a simple punitive mission to raze the city of Carthage to the ground. Carthage was almost defenceless and when besieged offered immediate surrender, conceding to a string of outrageous Roman demands. The Romans refused the surrender, demanding as their further terms of surrender the complete destruction of the city and, seeing little to lose, the Carthaginians prepared to fight. In the Battle of Carthage the city was stormed after a short siege and completely destroyed, its culture &quot;almost totally extinguished&quot;.

====Conquest of the Iberian Peninsula (219–18 BC)====
Rome&#x27;s conflict with the Carthaginians in the Punic Wars led them into expansion in the Iberian Peninsula of modern-day Spain and Portugal. The Punic empire of the Carthaginian Barcid family consisted of territories in Iberia, many of which Rome gained control of during the Punic Wars. Italy remained the main theatre of war for much of the Second Punic War, but the Romans also aimed to destroy the Barcid Empire in Iberia and prevent major Punic allies from linking up with forces in Italy.

Over the years, Rome had expanded along the southern Iberian coast until in 211 BC it captured the city of Saguntum. Following two major military expeditions to Iberia, the Romans finally crushed Carthaginian control of the peninsula in 206 BC, at the Battle of Ilipa, and the peninsula became a Roman province known as Hispania. From 206 BC onwards the only opposition to Roman control of the peninsula came from within the native Celtiberian tribes themselves, whose disunity prevented their security from Roman expansion.

Following two small-scale rebellions in 197 BC, in 195–194 BC war broke out between the Romans and the Lusitani people in the Lusitanian War, in modern-day Portugal. By 179 BC, the Romans had mostly succeeded in pacifying the region and bringing it under their control.

About 154 BC, a major revolt was re-ignited in Numantia, which is known as the First Numantine War, and a long war of resistance was fought between the advancing forces of the Roman Republic and the Lusitani tribes of Hispania. The praetor Servius Sulpicius Galba and the proconsul Lucius Licinius Lucullus arrived in 151 BC and began the process of subduing the local population. In 150 BC, Galba betrayed the Lusitani leaders he had invited to peace talks and had them killed, ingloriously ending the first phase of the war.

The Lusitani revolted again in 146 BC under a new leader called Viriathus, invading Turdetania (southern Iberia) in a guerrilla war. The Lusitanians were initially successful, defeating a Roman army at the Battle of Tribola and going on to sack nearby Carpetania, and then besting a second Roman army at the First Battle of Mount Venus in 146 BC, again going on to sack another nearby city. In 144 BC, the general Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus campaigned successfully against the Lusitani, but failed in his attempts to arrest Viriathus.

In 144 BC, Viriathus formed a league against Rome with several Celtiberian tribes and persuaded them to rise against Rome too, in the Second Numantine War. Viriathus&#x27; new coalition bested Roman armies at the Second Battle of Mount Venus in 144 BC and again at the failed Siege of Erisone. In 139 BC, Viriathus was finally killed in his sleep by three of his companions who had been promised gifts by Rome. In 136 and 135 BC, more attempts were made to gain complete control of the region of Numantia, but they failed. In 134 BC, the Consul Scipio Aemilianus finally succeeded in suppressing the rebellion following the successful Siege of Numantia.

Since the Roman invasion of the Iberian Peninsula had begun in the south in the territories around the Mediterranean controlled by the Barcids, the last region of the peninsula to be subdued lay in the far north. The Cantabrian Wars or Astur-Cantabrian Wars, from 29 BC to 19 BC, occurred during the Roman conquest of these northern provinces of Cantabria and Asturias. Iberia was fully occupied by 25 BC and the last revolt put down by 19 BC

====Macedon, the Greek poleis, and Illyria (215–148 BC)====


Rome&#x27;s preoccupation with its war with Carthage provided an opportunity for Philip V of the kingdom of Macedon in northern Greece to attempt to extend his power westward. Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal&#x27;s camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance as common enemies of Rome. However, Rome discovered the agreement when Philip&#x27;s emissaries, along with emissaries from Hannibal, were captured by a Roman fleet. Desiring to prevent Philip from aiding Carthage in Italy and elsewhere, Rome sought out land allies in Greece to fight a proxy war against Macedon on its behalf and found partners in the Aetolian League of Greek city-states, the Illyrians to the north of Macedon and the Attalid kingdom of Pergamon and the city-state of Rhodes, which lay across the Aegean from Macedon.

The First Macedonian War saw the Romans involved directly in only limited land operations. When the Aetolians sued for peace with Philip, Rome&#x27;s small expeditionary force, with no more allies in Greece, was ready to make peace. Rome had achieved its objective of pre-occupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal. A treaty was drawn up between Rome and Macedon at Phoenice in 205 BC which promised Rome a small indemnity, formally ending the First Macedonian War.

Macedon began to encroach on territory claimed by several other Greek city states in 200 BC and these pleaded for help from their newfound ally Rome. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum that he must submit Macedonia to being essentially a Roman province. Philip, unsurprisingly, refused and, after initial internal reluctance for further hostilities, Rome declared war against Philip in the Second Macedonian War. In the Battle of the Aous Roman forces under Titus Quinctius Flamininus defeated the Macedonians, and in a second larger battle under the same opposing commanders in 197 BC, in the Battle of Cynoscephalae, Flamininus again beat the Macedonians decisively. Macedonia was forced to sign the Treaty of Tempea, in which it lost all claim to territory in Greece and Asia, and had to pay a war indemnity to Rome.

Between the second and third Macedonian wars Rome faced further conflict in the region due to a tapestry of shifting rivalries, alliances and leagues all seeking to gain greater influence. After the Macedonians had been defeated in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC, the Greek city-state of Sparta stepped into the partial power vacuum in Greece. Fearing the Spartans would take increasing control of the region, the Romans drew on help from allies to prosecute the Roman-Spartan War, defeating a Spartan army at the Battle of Gythium in 195 BC. They also fought their former allies the Aetolian League in the Aetolian War, against the Istrians in the Istrian War, against the Illyrians in the Illyrian War, and against Achaia in the Achaean War.

Rome now turned its attentions to Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire to the east. After campaigns as far abroad as Bactria, India, Persia and Judea, Antiochus moved to Asia Minor and Thrace to secure several coastal towns, a move that brought him into conflict with Roman interests. A Roman force under Manius Acilius Glabrio defeated Antiochus at the Battle of Thermopylae and forced him to evacuate Greece: the Romans then pursued the Seleucids beyond Greece, beating them again in naval battles at the Battle of the Eurymedon and Battle of Myonessus, and finally in a decisive engagement of the Battle of Magnesia.

In 179 BC Philip died and his talented and ambitious son, Perseus of Macedon, took his throne and showed a renewed interest in Greece. He also allied himself with the warlike Bastarnae, and both this and his actions in Greece possibly violated the treaty signed with the Romans by his father or, if not, certainly was not &quot;behaving as [Rome considered] a subordinate ally should&quot;. Rome declared war on Macedonia again, starting the Third Macedonian War. Perseus initially had greater military success against the Romans than his father, winning the Battle of Callicinus against a Roman consular army. However, as with all such ventures in this period, Rome responded by simply sending another army. The second consular army duly defeated the Macedonians at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC and the Macedonians, lacking the reserve of the Romans and with King Perseus captured, duly capitulated, ending the Third Macedonian War.

The Fourth Macedonian War, fought from 150 BC to 148 BC, was the final war between Rome and Macedon and began when Andriscus usurped the Macedonian throne. The Romans raised a consular army under Quintus Caecilius Metellus, who swiftly defeated Andriscus at the Second battle of Pydna.

Under Lucius Mummius, Corinth was destroyed following a siege in 146 BC, leading to the surrender and thus conquest of the Achaean League (see Battle of Corinth).

===Late (147–30 BC)===

====Jugurthine War (112–105 BC)====

Rome had, in the earlier Punic Wars, gained large tracts of territory in Africa, which they consolidated in the following centuries. Much of that land had been granted to the kingdom of Numidia, a kingdom on the north African coast approximating to modern Algeria, in return for its past military assistance. The Jugurthine War of 111–104 BC was fought between Rome and Jugurtha of Numidia and constituted the final Roman pacification of Northern Africa, after which Rome largely ceased expansion on the continent after reaching natural barriers of desert and mountain. In response to Jugurtha&#x27;s usurpation of the Numidian throne, a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars, Rome intervened. Jugurtha impudently bribed the Romans into accepting his usurpation and was granted half the kingdom. Following further aggression and further bribery attempts, the Romans sent an army to depose him. The Romans were defeated at the Battle of Suthul but fared better at the Battle of the Muthul and finally defeated Jugurtha at the Battle of Thala, the Battle of Mulucha, and the Battle of Cirta (104 BC). Jugurtha was finally captured not in battle but by treachery, ending the war.

====Resurgence of the Celtic threat (121 BC)====
Memories of the sack of Rome by Celtic tribes from Gaul in 390/387 BC, had been made into a legendary account that was taught to each generation of Roman youth, were still prominent despite their historical distance. In 121 BC, Rome came into contact with the Celtic tribes of the Allobroges and the Arverni, both of which they defeated with apparent ease in the First Battle of Avignon near the Rhone river and the Second Battle of Avignon, the same year.

====New Germanic threat (113–101 BC)====
The Cimbrian War (113–101 BC) was a far more serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121 BC. The Germanic tribes of the &quot;Cimbri&quot; and the &quot;Teutons&quot; or &quot;Teutones&quot; migrated from northern Europe into Rome&#x27;s northern territories, where they clashed with Rome and her allies. The Cimbrian War was the first time since the Second Punic War that Italia and Rome itself had been seriously threatened, and caused great fear in Rome. The opening action of the Cimbrian War, the Battle of Noreia in 112 BC, ended in defeat and near disaster for the Romans. In 105 BC the Romans were defeated at the Battle of Arausio and was the costliest Rome had suffered since the Battle of Cannae. After the Cimbri inadvertently granted the Romans a reprieve by diverting to plunder Iberia, Rome was given the opportunity to carefully prepare for and successfully meet the Cimbri and Teutons in the Battle of Aquae Sextiae (102 BC) and the Battle of Vercellae (101 BC) where both tribes were virtually annihilated, ending the threat.

====Internal unrest (135–71 BC)====
The extensive campaigning abroad by Rome, and the rewarding of soldiers with plunder from those campaigns, led to the trend of soldiers becoming increasingly loyal to their commanders rather than to the state, and a willingness to follow their generals in battle against the state. Rome was plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because in the past century vast tracts of land had been given to veterans who farmed by use of slaves and who came to greatly outnumber their Roman masters. In the last century BC, at least twelve civil wars and rebellions occurred. This pattern did not break until Octavian (later &quot;Caesar Augustus&quot;) ended it by becoming a successful challenger to the Senate&#x27;s authority, and was made &quot;princeps&quot; (emperor).

Between 135 BC and 71 BC there were three Servile Wars against the Roman state; the third, and most serious, may have involved the revolution of 120,000 to 150,000 slaves. Additionally, in 91 BC the Social War broke out between Rome and its former allies in Italy, collectively known as the &quot;Socii&quot;, over the grievance that they shared the risk of Rome&#x27;s military campaigns, but not its rewards. Despite defeats such as the Battle of Fucine Lake, Roman troops defeated the Italian militias in decisive engagements, notably the Battle of Asculum. Although they lost militarily, the &quot;Socii&quot; achieved their objectives with the legal proclamations of the &quot;Lex Julia&quot; and &quot;Lex Plautia Papiria&quot;, which granted citizenship to more than 500,000 Italians.

The internal unrest reached its most serious stage in the two civil wars or marches upon Rome by the consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla at the beginning of 82 BC. In the Battle of the Colline Gate at the very door of the city of Rome, a Roman army under Sulla bested an army of the Roman senate and its Samnite allies. Whatever the merits of his grievances against those in power of the state, his actions marked a watershed of the willingness of Roman troops to wage war against one another that was to pave the way for the wars of the triumvirate, the overthrowing of the Senate as the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Roman state, and the eventual endemic usurpation of power by contenders for the emperor-ship in the later Empire.

====Conflicts with Mithridates (89–63 BC)====

Mithridates the Great was the ruler of Pontus, a large kingdom in Asia Minor, from 120 to 63 BC. He is remembered as one of Rome&#x27;s most formidable and successful enemies who engaged three of the most prominent generals of the late Roman Republic: Sulla, Lucullus, and Pompey the Great. In a pattern familiar from the Punic Wars, the Romans came into conflict with him after the two states&#x27; spheres of influence began to overlap. Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand his kingdom, and Rome for her part seemed equally keen for war and the spoils and prestige that it might bring. After conquering western Anatolia (modern Turkey) in 88 BC, Roman sources claim that Mithridates ordered the killing of the majority of the 80,000 Romans living there. In the subsequent First Mithridatic War, the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla forced Mithridates out of Greece proper after the Battle of Chaeronea and later Battle of Orchomenus but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival Marius; consequently, Mithridates VI was defeated but not destroyed. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary lull.

The Second Mithridatic War began when Rome tried to annex Bithynia as a province. In the Third Mithridatic War, first Lucius Licinius Lucullus and then Pompey the Great were sent against Mithridates. Mithridates was finally defeated by Pompey in the night-time Battle of the Lycus. After defeating Mithridates, Pompey invaded Caucacus, subjugated the Kingdom of Iberia and established Roman control over Colchis.

====Campaign against the Cilician pirates (67 BC)====

The Mediterranean had at this time fallen into the hands of pirates, largely from Cilicia. Rome had destroyed many of the states that had previously policed the Mediterranean with fleets, but had failed to step into the gap created. The pirates had seized the opportunity of a relative power vacuum and had not only strangled shipping lanes but had plundered many cities on the coasts of Greece and Asia, and had even made descents upon Italy itself. After the Roman admiral Marcus Antonius Creticus (father of the triumvir Marcus Antonius) failed to clear the pirates to the satisfaction of the Roman authorities, Pompey was nominated his successor as commander of a special naval task force to campaign against them. It supposedly took Pompey just forty days to clear the western portion of the western Mediterranean of pirates, and restore communication between Iberia, Africa, and Italy. Plutarch describes how Pompey first swept their craft from the Mediterranean in a series of small actions and through the promise of honouring the surrender of cities and craft. He then followed the main body of the pirates to their strongholds on the coast of Cilicia, and destroyed them there in the naval Battle of Korakesion.

====Caesar&#x27;s early campaigns (59–50 BC)====
During a term as praetor in Iberia, Pompey&#x27;s contemporary Julius Caesar of the Roman Julii clan defeated the Calaici and Lusitani in battle. Following a consular term, he was then appointed to a five-year term as Proconsular Governor of Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (the coast of Dalmatia). Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar strove to find reason to invade Gaul, which would give him the dramatic military success he sought. To this end he stirred up popular nightmares of the first sack of Rome by the Gauls and the more recent spectre of the Cimbri and Teutones. When the Helvetii and Tigurini tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near (not into) the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his Gallic Wars, fought between 58 BC and 49 BC. After slaughtering the Helvetii tribe, Caesar prosecuted a &quot;long, bitter and costly&quot; campaign against other tribes across the breadth of Gaul, many of whom had fought alongside Rome against their common enemy the Helvetii, and annexed their territory to that of Rome. Plutarch claims that the campaign cost a million Gallic lives. Although &quot;fierce and able&quot; the Gauls were handicapped by internal disunity and fell in a series of battles over the course of a decade.

Caesar defeated the &quot;Helvetii&quot; in 58 BC at the Battle of the Arar and Battle of Bibracte, the Belgic confederacy known as the &quot;Belgae&quot; at the Battle of the Axona, the &quot;Nervii&quot; in 57 BC at the Battle of the Sabis, the &quot;Aquitani&quot;, &quot;Treviri&quot;, &quot;Tencteri&quot;, &quot;Aedui&quot; and &quot;Eburones&quot; in unknown battles, and the &quot;Veneti&quot; in 56 BC. In 55 and 54 BC he made two expeditions to Britain. In 52 BC, following the Siege of Avaricum and a string of inconclusive battles, Caesar defeated a union of Gauls led by Vercingetorix at the Battle of Alesia, completing the Roman conquest of Transalpine Gaul. By 50 BC, the entirety of Gaul lay in Roman hands. Caesar recorded his own accounts of these campaigns in &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot; (&quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot;).

Gaul never regained its Celtic identity, never attempted another nationalist rebellion, and remained loyal to Rome until the fall of the Western Empire in 476 AD. However, although Gaul itself was to thereafter remain loyal, cracks were appearing in the political unity of Rome&#x27;s governing figures – partly over concerns over the loyalty of Caesar&#x27;s Gallic troops to his person rather than the state – that were soon to drive Rome into a lengthy series of civil wars.

====Triumvirates, Caesarian ascension, and revolt (53–30 BC)====
By 59 BC an unofficial political alliance known as the First Triumvirate was formed between Gaius Julius Caesar, Marcus Licinius Crassus, and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus to share power and influence. It was always an uncomfortable alliance given that Crassus and Pompey intensely disliked one another. In 53 BC, Crassus launched a Roman invasion of the Parthian Empire. After initial successes, he marched his army deep into the desert; but here his army was cut off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and slaughtered at the Battle of Carrhae in &quot;the greatest Roman defeat since Hannibal&quot; in which Crassus himself perished. The death of Crassus removed some of the balance in the Triumvirate and, consequently, Caesar and Pompey began to move apart. While Caesar was fighting against Vercingetorix in Gaul, Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome that revealed that he was at best ambivalent towards Caesar and perhaps now covertly allied with Caesar&#x27;s political enemies. In 51 BC, some Roman senators demanded that Caesar would not be permitted to stand for Consul unless he turned over control of his armies to the state, and the same demands were made of Pompey by other factions. Relinquishing his army would leave Caesar defenceless before his enemies. Caesar chose Civil War over laying down his command and facing trial. The triumvirate was shattered and conflict was inevitable.

Pompey initially assured Rome and the senate that he could defeat Caesar in battle should he march on Rome. However, by the spring of 49 BC, when Caesar crossed the Rubicon river with his invading forces and swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome, Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome. Caesar&#x27;s army was still under-strength, with certain units remaining in Gaul, but on the other hand Pompey himself only had a small force at his command, and that with uncertain loyalty having served under Caesar. Tom Holland attributes Pompey&#x27;s willingness to abandon Rome to waves of panicking refugees as an attempt to stir ancestral fears of invasions from the north. Pompey&#x27;s forces retreated south towards Brundisium, and then fled to Greece. Caesar first directed his attention to the Pompeian stronghold of Iberia but following campaigning by Caesar in the Siege of Massilia and Battle of Ilerda he decided to attack Pompey in Greece. Pompey initially defeated Caesar at the Battle of Dyrrachium in 48 BC but failed to follow up on the victory. Pompey was decisively defeated in the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC despite outnumbering Caesar&#x27;s forces two to one. Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered in an attempt to ingratiate the country with Caesar and avoid a war with Rome.

Pompey&#x27;s death did not see the end of the civil wars since initially Caesar&#x27;s enemies were manifold and Pompey&#x27;s supporters continued to fight on after his death. In 46 BC Caesar lost perhaps as much as a third of his army when his former commander Titus Labienus, who had defected to the Pompeians several years earlier, defeated him at the Battle of Ruspina. However, after this low point Caesar came back to defeat the Pompeian army of Metellus Scipio in the Battle of Thapsus, after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Iberia. Caesar defeated the combined forces of Titus Labienus and Gnaeus Pompey the Younger at the Battle of Munda in Iberia. Labienus was killed in the battle and the Younger Pompey captured and executed.

Despite his military success, or probably because of it, fear spread of Caesar, now the primary figure of the Roman state, becoming an autocratic ruler and ending the Roman Republic. This fear drove a group of senators naming themselves The Liberators to assassinate him in 44 BC. Further civil war followed between those loyal to Caesar and those who supported the actions of the Liberators. Caesar&#x27;s supporter Mark Antony condemned Caesar&#x27;s assassins and war broke out between the two factions. Antony was denounced as a public enemy, and Octavian was entrusted with the command of the war against him. In the Battle of Forum Gallorum Antony, besieging Caesar&#x27;s assassin Decimus Brutus in Mutina, defeated the forces of the consul Pansa, who was killed, but Antony was then immediately defeated by the army of the other consul, Hirtius. At the Battle of Mutina Antony was again defeated in battle by Hirtius, who was killed. Although Antony failed to capture Mutina, Decimus Brutus was murdered shortly thereafter.

Octavian betrayed his party, and came to terms with Caesarians Antony and Lepidus and on 26 November 43 BC the Second Triumvirate was formed, this time in an official capacity. In 42 BC Triumvirs Mark Antony and Octavian fought the indecisive Battle of Philippi with Caesar&#x27;s assassins Marcus Brutus and Cassius. Although Brutus defeated Octavian, Antony defeated Cassius, who committed suicide. Brutus also committed suicide shortly afterwards.

Civil war flared again when the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and Mark Antony failed just as the first had almost as soon as its opponents had been removed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base and then launched a campaign against Mark Antony. Together with Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony&#x27;s wife Fulvia raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony&#x27;s rights against Octavian but she was defeated by Octavian at the Battle of Perugia. Her death led to partial reconciliation between Octavian and Antony who went on to crush the army of Sextus Pompeius, the last focus of opposition to the second triumvirate, in the naval Battle of Naulochus.

As before, once opposition to the triumvirate was crushed, it started to tear at itself. The triumvirate expired on the last day of 33 BC and was not renewed in law and in 31 BC, war began again. At the Battle of Actium, Octavian decisively defeated Antony and Cleopatra in a naval battle near Greece, using fire to destroy the enemy fleet.

Octavian went on to become Emperor under the name Augustus and, in the absence of political assassins or usurpers, was able to greatly expand the borders of the Empire.

==Empire==

===Imperial expansion (40 BC – 117 AD)===

Secured from internal threats, Rome achieved great territorial gains in both the East and the West. In the West, following humiliating defeats at the hands of the Sugambri, Tencteri and Usipetes tribes in 16 BC, Roman armies pushed north and east out of Gaul to subdue much of Germania. The Pannonian revolt in 6 AD forced the Romans to cancel their plan to cement their conquest of Germania. Despite the loss of a large army almost to the man of Varus&#x27; famous defeat at the hands of the Germanic leader Arminius in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD, Rome recovered and continued its expansion up to and beyond the borders of the known world. Roman armies under Germanicus pursued several more campaigns against the Germanic tribes of the Marcomanni, Hermunduri, Chatti, Cherusci, Bructeri, and Marsi. Overcoming several mutinies in the armies along the Rhine, Germanicus defeated the Germanic tribes of Arminius in a series of battles culminating in the Battle of the Weser River.

After Caesar&#x27;s preliminary low-scale invasions of Britain, the Romans invaded in force in 43 AD, forcing their way inland through several battles against British tribes, including the Battle of the Medway, the Battle of the Thames, the Battle of Caer Caradoc and the Battle of Mona. Following a general uprising in which the Britons sacked Colchester, St Albans and London, the Romans suppressed the rebellion in the Battle of Watling Street and went on to push as far north as central Scotland in the Battle of Mons Graupius. Tribes in modern-day Scotland and Northern England repeatedly rebelled against Roman rule and two military bases were established in Britannia to protect against rebellion and incursions from the north, from which Roman troops built and manned Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

On the continent, the extension of the Empire&#x27;s borders beyond the Rhine hung in the balance for some time, with the emperor Caligula apparently poised to invade Germania in 39 AD, and Cnaeus Domitius Corbulo crossing the Rhine in 47 AD and marching into the territory of the Frisii and Chauci. Caligula&#x27;s successor, Claudius, ordered the suspension of further attacks across the Rhine, setting what was to become the permanent limit of the Empire&#x27;s expansion in this direction.

Further east, Trajan turned his attention to Dacia, an area north of Macedon and Greece and east of the Danube that had been on the Roman agenda since before the days of Caesar when they had beaten a Roman army at the Battle of Histria. In 85 AD, the Dacians had swarmed over the Danube and pillaged Moesia and initially defeated an army the Emperor Domitian sent against them, but the Romans were victorious in the Battle of Tapae in AD 88 and a truce was drawn up.

Emperor Trajan recommenced hostilities against Dacia and, following an uncertain number of battles, defeated the Dacian general Decebalus in the Second Battle of Tapae in 101 AD. With Trajan&#x27;s troops pressing towards the Dacian capital Sarmizegethusa, Decebalus once more sought terms. Decebalus rebuilt his power over the following years and attacked Roman garrisons again in 105 AD. In response Trajan again marched into Dacia, besieging the Dacian capital in the Siege of Sarmizegethusa, and razing it to the ground. With Dacia quelled, Trajan subsequently invaded the Parthian empire to the east, his conquests taking the Roman Empire to its greatest extent. Rome&#x27;s borders in the east were indirectly governed through a system of client states for some time, leading to less direct campaigning than in the west in this period.

The Kingdom of Armenia between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea became a focus of contention between Rome and the Parthian Empire, and control of the region was repeatedly gained and lost. The Parthians forced Armenia into submission from 37 AD but in 47 AD the Romans retook control of the kingdom and offered it client kingdom status. Under Nero, the Romans fought a campaign between 55 and 63 AD against the Parthian Empire, which had again invaded Armenia. After gaining Armenia once more in 60 AD and subsequently losing it again in 62 AD, the Romans sent Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo in 63 AD into the territories of Vologases I of Parthia. Corbulo succeeded in returning Armenia to Roman client status, where it remained for the next century.

===Year of the Four Emperors (69 AD)===
In 69 AD, Marcus Salvius Otho, governor of Lusitania, had the Emperor Galba murdered and claimed the throne for himself. However, Vitellius, governor of the province of Germania Inferior, had also claimed the throne and marched on Rome with his troops. Following an inconclusive battle near Antipolis, Vitellius&#x27; troops attacked the city of Placentia in the Assault of Placentia, but were repulsed by the Othonian garrison.

Otho left Rome on March 14, and marched north towards Placentia to meet his challenger. In the Battle of Locus Castorum the Othonians had the better of the fighting, and Vitellius&#x27; troops retreated to Cremona. The two armies met again on the Via Postunia, in the First Battle of Bedriacum, after which the Othonian troops fled back to their camp in Bedriacum, and the next day surrendered to the Vitellian forces. Otho decided to commit suicide rather than fight on.

Meanwhile, the forces stationed in the Middle East provinces of Judaea and Syria had acclaimed Vespasian as emperor and the Danubian armies of the provinces of Raetia and Moesia also acclaimed Vespasian as emperor. Vespasian&#x27;s and Vitellius&#x27; armies met in the Second Battle of Bedriacum, after which the Vitellian troops were driven back into their camp outside Cremona, which was taken. Vespasian&#x27;s troops then attacked Cremona itself, which surrendered.

Under pretence of siding with Vespasian, Civilis of Batavia had taken up arms and induced the inhabitants of his native country to rebel. The rebelling Batavians were immediately joined by several neighbouring German tribes including the Frisii. These forces drove out the Roman garrisons near the Rhine and defeated a Roman army at the Battle of Castra Vetera, after which many Roman troops along the Rhine and in Gaul defected to the Batavian cause. However, disputes soon broke out amongst the different tribes, rendering co-operation impossible; Vespasian, having successfully ended the civil war, called upon Civilis to lay down his arms, and on his refusal his legions met him in force, defeating him in the Battle of Augusta Treverorum.

===Jewish revolts (66–135 AD)===

The First Jewish-Roman War, sometimes called The Great Revolt, was the first of three major rebellions by the Jews of Judaea against the Roman Empire. According to Fergus Millar, the revolt represents &quot;the best-attested series of operations by the Roman army in the entire history of the Empire.&quot; Judaea, an independent kingdom under the Hasmoneans, fell into a civil war in which Pompey intervened, conquering Jerusalem in 63 BC. The territory gradually transformed into a client kingdom before eventually becoming a directly governed province. Jewish anger towards Rome grew due to the incompetent and often harsh rule of successive governors coupled with Roman insensitivity – Tacitus says disgust and repulsion – towards their religion. This discontent was further fueled by ethnic tensions between Jews and pagans, economic and social issues, and aspirations for national independence. The spark came in 66 AD, when violence broke out in Jerusalem after the Roman governor seized a large amount of money from the Temple and killed many; this act led to an open uprising against Rome. Cestius Gallus, the Roman governor of Syria, attempted to quell the revolt but withdrew after initial engagements in Jerusalem, with his force decisively ambushed and annihilated in the Battle of Beth-Horon, losing a contingent equivalent to a legion. By this point, the revolt attracted greater attention from Rome and Emperor Nero appointed general Vespasian to crush the rebellion. Vespasian led his forces in a methodical clearance of the areas in revolt. By the year 68 AD, Jewish resistance in the Galilee had been crushed, with the Romans besieging and destroying rebel strongholds such as Yodfat and Gamla. In 70 AD, Titus succeeded Vespasian and, using a force significantly larger than the one deployed for the Roman invasion of Britain, managed to take Jerusalem after a long siege, during which the Temple was razed. The city was systematically destroyed, with much of its population massacred or enslaved. Roman forces continued to suppress remaining resistance, culminating in the Siege of Masada in 73 AD. The Flavian dynasty leveraged the victory to solidify its claim to imperial rule. This was achieved through a triumph in Rome (the only one celebrating the subjugation of an existing province&#x27;s population), the minting of Judaea Capta coins, and the construction of commemorative monuments such as the Arch of Titus.Circa 115 AD, a series of revolts broke out among Jewish diaspora communities in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire while Trajan was engaged in his Parthian campaign. The revolts, which came to be known as the Diaspora Revolt, erupted nearly simultaneously in Egypt, Libya, and Cyprus. Marcius Turbo, a leading general, was sent to quell the uprisings in Egypt and Libya, while Lusius Quietus handled Jewish unrest in Mesopotamia and Judaea (the &quot;Kitos War&quot;). The uprisings were largely suppressed by late 117 AD, just before Trajan&#x27;s death, resulting in the annihilation and expulsion of Jewish communities in Egypt, Libya, and Cyprus.

In 132 AD, the Bar Kokhba revolt emerged as the final major Jewish uprising against Roman authority and the last bid for Jewish independence in Judaea. The immediate triggers of the revolt, still debated by scholars, include Hadrian&#x27;s establishment of the pagan colony Aelia Capitolina on the ruins of Jerusalem and his prohibition of circumcision. Led by Simon bar Kokhba, the Jews initially succeeded in creating a brief independent state. However, the Romans assembled six full legions with auxiliaries and other elements from up to six additional legions, all under the command of Sextus Julius Severus, that effectively crushed the revolt by 135 AD. This suppression caused extensive devastation across Judaea, leading to massive loss of life, widespread displacement, and enslavement, while also inflicting heavy casualties on Roman forces. After the revolt, the province was renamed Syria Palaestina, and Jews were subjected to harsh religious restrictions.

===Struggle with Parthia (114–217 AD)===

By the 2nd century AD the territories of Persia were controlled by the Arsacid dynasty and known as the Parthian Empire. Due in large part to their employment of powerful heavy cavalry and mobile horse archers, Parthia was the most formidable enemy of the Roman Empire in the east. As early as 53 BC, the Roman general Crassus had invaded Parthia, but he was killed and his army was defeated at the Battle of Carrhae. In the years following Carrhae, the Romans were divided in civil war and hence unable to campaign against Parthia. Trajan also campaigned against the Parthians from 114 to 117 AD and briefly captured their capital Ctesiphon, putting the puppet ruler Parthamaspates on the throne. However, rebellions in Babylonia and the Jewish revolts in Judaea made it difficult to maintain the captured province and the territories were abandoned.

A revitalised Parthian Empire renewed its assault in 161 AD, defeating two Roman armies and invading Armenia and Syria. Emperor Lucius Verus and general Gaius Avidius Cassius were sent in 162 AD to counter the resurgent Parthia. In this war, the Parthian city of Seleucia on the Tigris was destroyed and the palace at the capital Ctesiphon was burned to the ground by Avidius Cassius in 164 AD. The Parthians made peace but were forced to cede western Mesopotamia to the Romans.

In 197 AD, Emperor Septimius Severus waged a brief and successful war against the Parthian Empire in retaliation for the support given to a rival for the imperial throne Pescennius Niger. The Parthian capital Ctesiphon was sacked by the Roman army, and the northern half of Mesopotamia was restored to Rome.

Emperor Caracalla, the son of Severus, marched on Parthia in 217 AD from Edessa to begin a war against them, but he was assassinated while on the march. In 224 AD, the Parthian Empire was crushed not by the Romans but by the rebellious Persian vassal king Ardashir I, who revolted, leading to the establishment of Sassanid Empire of Persia, which replaced Parthia as Rome&#x27;s major rival in the East.

Throughout the Parthian wars, tribal groups along the Rhine and Danube took advantage of Rome&#x27;s preoccupation with the eastern frontier (and the plague that the Romans suffered from after bringing it back from the east) and launched a series of incursions into Roman territories, including the Marcomannic Wars.

===Struggle with Germanic tribes (163–378 AD)===

After Varus&#x27; defeat in Germania in the 1st century, Rome had adopted a largely defensive strategy along the border with Germania, constructing a line of defences known as &quot;limes&quot; along the Rhine. Although the exact historicity is unclear, since the Romans often assigned one name to several distinct tribal groups, or conversely applied several names to a single group at different times, some mix of Germanic peoples, Celts, and tribes of mixed Celto-Germanic ethnicity were settled in the lands of Germania from the 1st century onwards. The Cherusci, Bructeri, Tencteri, Usipi, Marsi, and Chatti of Varus&#x27; time had by the 3rd century either evolved into or been displaced by a confederacy or alliance of Germanic tribes collectively known as the Alamanni, first mentioned by Cassius Dio describing the campaign of Caracalla in 213 AD.

In around 166 AD, several Germanic tribes pushed across the Danube, striking as far as Italy itself in the Siege of Aquileia in 166 AD, and the heartland of Greece in the Sack of Eleusis.

Although the essential problem of large tribal groups on the frontier remained much the same as the situation Rome faced in earlier centuries, the 3rd century saw a marked increase in the overall threat, although there is disagreement over whether external pressure increased, or Rome&#x27;s ability to meet it declined. The Carpi and Sarmatians whom Rome had held at bay were replaced by the Goths and likewise the Quadi and Marcomanni that Rome had defeated were replaced by the greater confederation of the Alamanni.

The assembled warbands of the Alamanni frequently crossed the &quot;limes&quot;, attacking Germania Superior such that they were almost continually engaged in conflicts with the Roman Empire, whilst Goths attacked across the Danube in battles such as the Battle of Beroa and Battle of Philippopolis in 250 AD and the Battle of Abrittus in 251 AD, and both Goths and Heruli ravaged the Aegean and, later, Greece, Thrace and Macedonia. However, their first major assault deep into Roman territory came in 268 AD. In that year the Romans were forced to denude much of their German frontier of troops in response to a massive invasion by another new Germanic tribal confederacy, the Goths, from the east. The pressure of tribal groups pushing into the Empire was the result of a chain of migrations with its roots far to the east: Huns from the Russian steppe attacked the Goths, who in turn attacked the Dacians, Alans and Sarmatians at or within Rome&#x27;s borders. The Goths first appeared in history as a distinct people in this invasion of 268 AD when they swarmed over the Balkan peninsula and overran the Roman provinces of Pannonia and Illyricum and even threatened Italia itself.

The Alamanni seized the opportunity to launch a major invasion of Gaul and northern Italy. However, the Visigoths were defeated in battle that summer near the modern Italian-Slovenian border and then routed in the Battle of Naissus that September by Gallienus, Claudius and Aurelian, who then turned and defeated the Alemanni at the Battle of Lake Benacus. Claudius&#x27; successor Aurelian defeated the Goths twice more in the Battle of Fanum Fortunae and the Battle of Ticinum. The Goths remained a major threat to the Empire but directed their attacks away from Italy itself for several years after their defeat. By 284 AD, Gothic troops were serving on behalf of the Roman military as federated troops.

The Alamanni on the other hand resumed their drive towards Italy almost immediately. They defeated Aurelian at the Battle of Placentia in 271 AD but were beaten back for a short time after they lost the battles of Fano and Pavia later that year. They were beaten again in 298 AD at the battles of Lingones and Vindonissa but fifty years later they were resurgent again, making incursions in 356 AD at the Battle of Reims, in 357 AD at the Battle of Strasbourg, in 367 AD at the Battle of Solicinium and in 378 AD at Battle of Argentovaria. In the same year the Goths inflicted a crushing defeat on the Eastern Empire at the Battle of Adrianople, in which the Eastern Emperor Valens was massacred along with tens of thousands of Roman troops.

At the same time, Franks raided through the North Sea and the English Channel, Vandals pressed across the Rhine, Iuthungi against the Danube, Iazyges, Carpi and Taifali harassed Dacia, and Gepids joined the Goths and Heruli in attacks round the Black Sea. At around the same time, lesser-known tribes such as the Bavares, Baquates and Quinquegentanei raided Africa.

At the start of the 5th century, the pressure on Rome&#x27;s western borders was growing intense. However, it was not only the western borders that were under threat: Rome was also under threat both internally and on its eastern borders.

===Usurpers (193–394 AD)===


An army that was often willing to support its general over its emperor, meant that if commanders could establish sole control of their army, they could usurp the imperial throne from that position. The so-called Crisis of the Third Century describes the turmoil of murder, usurpation and in-fighting that followed the murder of the Emperor Alexander Severus in 235 AD. However, Cassius Dio marks the wider imperial decline as beginning in 180 AD with the ascension of Commodus to the throne, a judgement with which Gibbon concurred, and Matyszak states that &quot;the rot ... had become established long before&quot; even that.

Although the crisis of the 3rd century was not the absolute beginning of Rome&#x27;s decline, it nevertheless did impose a severe strain on the empire as Romans waged war on one another as they had not done since the last days of the Republic. Within the space of a single century, twenty-seven military officers declared themselves emperors and reigned over parts of the empire for months or days, all but two meeting with a violent end. The time was characterized by a Roman army that was as likely to be attacking itself as it was an outside invader, reaching a low point around 258 AD. Ironically, while it was these usurpations that led to the breakup of the Empire during the crisis, it was the strength of several frontier generals that helped reunify the empire through force of arms.

The situation was complex, often with three or more usurpers in existence at once. Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger, both rebel generals declared to be emperors by the troops they commanded, clashed for the first time in 193 AD at the Battle of Cyzicus, in which Niger was defeated. However, it took two further defeats at the Battle of Nicaea later that year and the Battle of Issus the following year, for Niger to be destroyed. Almost as soon as Niger&#x27;s usurpation had been ended, Severus was forced to deal with another rival for the throne in the person of Clodius Albinus, who had originally been allied to Severus. Albinus was proclaimed emperor by his troops in Britain and, crossing over to Gaul, defeated Severus&#x27; general Virius Lupus in battle, before being in turn defeated and killed in the Battle of Lugdunum by Severus himself.

After this turmoil, Severus faced no more internal threats for the rest of his reign, and the reign of his successor Caracalla passed uninterrupted for a while until he was murdered by Macrinus, who proclaimed himself emperor. Despite Macrinus having his position ratified by the Roman senate, the troops of Varius Avitus declared him to be emperor instead, and the two met in battle at the Battle of Antioch in 218 AD, in which Macrinus was defeated. However, Avitus himself, after taking the imperial name Elagabalus, was murdered shortly afterwards and Alexander Severus was proclaimed emperor by both the Praetorian Guard and the senate who, after a short reign, was murdered in turn. His murderers were working on behalf of the army who were unhappy with their lot under his rule and who raised in his place Maximinus Thrax. However, just as he had been raised by the army, Maximinus was also brought down by them and despite winning the Battle of Carthage against the senate&#x27;s newly proclaimed Gordian II, he too was murdered when it appeared to his forces as though he would not be able to best the next senatorial candidate for the throne, Gordian III.

Gordian III&#x27;s fate is not certain, although he may have been murdered by his own successor, Philip the Arab, who ruled for only a few years before the army again raised a general, Decius, by their proclamation to emperor, who then defeated Philip in the Battle of Verona. Several succeeding generals avoided battling usurpers for the throne by being murdered by their own troops before battle could commence. The lone exception to this rule was Gallienus, emperor from 260 to 268 AD, who confronted a remarkable array of usurpers, most of whom he defeated in pitched battle. The army was mostly spared further infighting until around 273 AD, when Aurelian defeated the Gallic usurper Tetricus in the Battle of Chalons. The next decade saw an incredible number of usurpers, sometimes three at the same time, all vying for the imperial throne. Most of the battles are not recorded, due primarily to the turmoil of the time, until Diocletian, a usurper himself, defeated Carinus at the Battle of the Margus and became emperor.

Some small measure of stability again returned at this point, with the empire split into a Tetrarchy of two greater and two lesser emperors, a system that staved off civil wars for a short time until 312 AD. In that year, relations between the tetrarchy collapsed for good and Constantine I, Licinius, Maxentius and Maximinus jostled for control of the empire. In the Battle of Turin Constantine defeated Maxentius, and in the Battle of Tzirallum, Licinius defeated Maximinus. From 314 AD onwards, Constantine defeated Licinius in the Battle of Cibalae, then the Battle of Mardia, and then again at the Battle of Adrianople, the Battle of the Hellespont and the Battle of Chrysopolis.

Constantine then turned upon Maxentius, beating him in the Battle of Verona and the Battle of Milvian Bridge in the same year. Constantine&#x27;s son Constantius II inherited his father&#x27;s rule and later defeated the usurper Magnentius in first the Battle of Mursa Major and then the Battle of Mons Seleucus.

Successive emperors Valens and Theodosius I also defeated usurpers in, respectively, the Battle of Thyatira, and the battles of the Save and the Frigidus.

===Struggle with the Sassanid Empire (230–363 AD)===

After overthrowing the Parthian confederacy, the Sassanid Empire that arose from its remains pursued a more aggressive expansionist policy than their predecessors and continued to make war against Rome. In 230 AD, the first Sassanid emperor attacked Roman territory first in Armenia and then in Mesopotamia but Roman losses were largely restored by Severus within a few years. In 243 AD, Emperor Gordian III&#x27;s army retook the Roman cities of Hatra, Nisibis and Carrhae from the Sassanids after defeating the Sassanids at the Battle of Resaena but what happened next is unclear: Persian sources claim that Gordian was defeated and killed in the Battle of Misikhe but Roman sources mention this battle only as an insignificant setback and suggest that Gordian died elsewhere.

Certainly, the Sassanids had not been cowed by the previous battles with Rome and in 253 AD the Sassanids under Shapur I penetrated deeply into Roman territory several times, defeating a Roman force at the Battle of Barbalissos and conquering and plundering Antiochia in 252 AD following the Siege of Antiochia. The Romans recovered Antioch by 253 AD, and Emperor Valerian gathered an army and marched eastward to the Sassanid borders. In 260 AD at the Battle of Edessa the Sassanids defeated the Roman army and captured the Roman Emperor Valerian.

By the late 3rd century, Roman fortunes on the eastern frontier improved dramatically. During a period of civil upheaval in Persia, emperor Carus led a successful campaign into Persia essentially uncontested, sacking Ctesiphon in 283 AD. During the reign of the Tetrarchy, emperors Diocletian and Galerius brought a decisive conclusion to the war, sacking Ctesiphon in 299 AD and expanding the Roman eastern frontier dramatically with the Treaty of Nisibis. The treaty brought lasting peace between Rome and the Sassanids for almost four decades until the end of Constantine the Great&#x27;s reign. In 337 AD, Shapur II broke the peace and began a 26-year conflict, attempting with little success to conquer Roman fortresses in the region. After early Sassanid successes including the Battle of Amida in 359 AD and the Siege of Pirisabora in 363 AD, Emperor Julian met Shapur in 363 AD in the Battle of Ctesiphon outside the walls of the Persian capital. The Romans were victorious but were unable to take the city, and were forced to retreat due to their vulnerable position in the middle of hostile territory. Julian was killed in the Battle of Samarra during the retreat, possibly by one of his own men.

There were several future wars, although all brief and small-scale, since both the Romans and the Sassanids were forced to deal with threats from other directions during the 5th century. A war against Bahram V in 420 AD over the persecution of the Christians in Persia led to a brief war that was soon concluded by treaty and in 441 AD a war with Yazdegerd II was again swiftly concluded by treaty after both parties battled threats elsewhere.

===Collapse of the Western Empire (402–476 AD)===

Many theories have been advanced in way of explanation for decline of the Roman Empire, and many dates given for its fall, from the onset of its decline in the 3rd century to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Militarily, however, the Empire finally fell after first being overrun by various non-Roman peoples and then having its heart in Italy seized by Germanic troops in a revolt. The historicity and exact dates are uncertain, and some historians do not consider that the Empire fell at this point.

The Empire became gradually less Romanised and increasingly Germanic in nature: although the Empire buckled under Visigothic assault, the overthrow of the last Emperor Romulus Augustus was carried out by federated Germanic troops from within the Roman army rather than by foreign troops. In this sense had Odoacer not renounced the title of Emperor and named himself &quot;King of Italy&quot; instead, the Empire might have continued in name. Its identity, however, was no longer Roman – it was increasingly populated and governed by Germanic peoples long before 476 AD. The Roman people were by the 5th century &quot;bereft of their military ethos&quot; and the Roman army itself a mere supplement to federated troops of Goths, Huns, Franks and others fighting on their behalf.

Rome&#x27;s last gasp began when the Visigoths revolted around 395 AD. Led by Alaric I, they attempted to seize Constantinople, but were rebuffed and instead plundered much of Thrace in northern Greece. In 402 AD they besieged Mediolanum, the capital of Roman Emperor Honorius, defended by Roman Gothic troops. The arrival of the Roman Stilicho and his army forced Alaric to lift his siege and move his army towards Hasta (modern Asti) in western Italy, where Stilicho attacked it at the Battle of Pollentia, capturing Alaric&#x27;s camp. Stilicho offered to return the prisoners in exchange for the Visigoths returning to Illyricum but upon arriving at Verona, Alaric halted his retreat. Stilicho again attacked at the Battle of Verona and again defeated Alaric, forcing him to withdraw from Italy.

In 405 AD, the Ostrogoths invaded Italy itself, but were defeated. However, in 406 AD an unprecedented number of tribes took advantage of the freezing of the Rhine to cross &quot;en masse&quot;: Vandals, Suevi, Alans and Burgundians swept across the river and met little resistance in the Sack of Moguntiacum and the Sack of Treviri, completely overrunning Gaul. Despite this grave danger, or perhaps because of it, the Roman army continued to be wracked by usurpation, in one of which Stilicho, Rome&#x27;s foremost defender of the period, was put to death.

It is in this climate that, despite his earlier setback, Alaric returned again in 410 AD and managed to sack Rome. The Roman capital had by this time moved to the Italian city of Ravenna, but some historians view 410 AD as an alternative date for the true fall of the Roman Empire. Without possession of Rome or many of its former provinces, and increasingly Germanic in nature, the Roman Empire after 410 AD had little in common with the earlier Empire. By 410 AD, Britain had been mostly denuded of Roman troops, and by 425 AD was no longer part of the Empire, and much of western Europe was beset &quot;by all kinds of calamities and disasters&quot;, coming under barbarian kingdoms ruled by Vandals, Suebians, Visigoths and Burgundians.

The remainder of Rome&#x27;s territory—if not its nature—was defended for several decades following 410 AD largely by Flavius Aëtius, who managed to play off each of Rome&#x27;s barbarian invaders against one another. In 435 AD he led a Hunnic army against the Visigoths at the Battle of Arles, and again in 436 AD at the Battle of Narbonne. In 451 AD he led a combined army, including his former enemy the Visigoths, against the Huns at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, where Aëtius managed to halt the Hunnic onslaught. However, Concordia, Altinum, Mediolanum, Ticinum, and Patavium were sacked, and the Huns returned a year later. After brutally razing Aquileia, the Huns continued to move towards Rome. It was at this point that Pope Leo I managed to convince Attila to leave.

Despite being the only clear champion of the Empire at this point, Aëtius was slain by the Emperor Valentinian III&#x27;s own hand 2 years afterwards, leading Sidonius Apollinaris to observe, &quot;I am ignorant, sir, of your motives or provocations; I only know that you have acted like a man who has cut off his right hand with his left&quot;.

Carthage, the second largest city in the empire, was lost along with much of North Africa in 439 AD to the Vandals, and the fate of Rome seemed sealed. By 476 AD, what remained of the Empire was completely in the hands of federated Germanic troops and when they revolted, led by Odoacer and deposed the Emperor Romulus Augustus there was nobody to stop them. Odoacer happened to hold the part of the Empire around Italy and Rome but other parts of the Empire were ruled by Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alans and others. The Empire in the West had fallen, and its remnant in Italy was no longer Roman in nature. The Eastern Roman Empire and the Goths continued to fight over Rome and the surrounding area for many years, though by this point Rome&#x27;s importance was primarily symbolic.

<text>Cruise ships are large passenger ships used mainly for vacationing. Unlike ocean liners, which are used for transport, cruise ships typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports of call, where passengers may go on tours known as &quot;shore excursions&quot;.

Modern cruise ships tend to have less hull strength, speed, and agility compared to ocean liners. However, they have added amenities to cater to water tourists, with recent vessels being described as &quot;balcony-laden floating condominiums&quot;.

 there were 302 cruise ships operating worldwide, with a combined capacity of 664,602 passengers. Cruising has become a major part of the tourism industry, with an estimated market of $29.4 billion per year, and over 19 million passengers carried worldwide annually . The industry&#x27;s rapid growth saw nine or more newly built ships catering to a North American clientele added every year since 2001, as well as others servicing European clientele until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 saw the entire industry all but shut down. The average age of a cruise ship in 2024 is 17.5 years. The construction market for cruise ships is dominated by three European companies and one Asian company.

Operators of cruise ships are known as cruise lines. Cruise ships are organized much like floating hotels, with a complete hospitality staff in addition to the usual ship&#x27;s crew. Traditionally, the ships&#x27; restaurants organize two dinner services per day, early dining and late dining, and passengers are allocated a set dining time for the entire cruise; a recent trend is to allow diners to dine whenever they want. Besides the dining room, modern cruise ships often contain one or more casual buffet-style eateries. Most cruise ships sail the Caribbean or the Mediterranean. Others operate elsewhere in places like Alaska, the South Pacific, and the Baltic Sea. Large cruise ships have been identified as one of the major causes of overtourism.

==History==
===Origins===

Italy, a traditional focus of the Grand Tour, offered an early cruise experience on the &quot;Francesco I&quot;, flying the flag of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Built in 1831, the &quot;Francesco I&quot; sailed from Naples in early June 1833, preceded by an advertising campaign. Nobles, authorities, and royal princes from all over Europe boarded the cruise ship, which sailed in just over three months to Taormina, Catania, Syracuse, Malta, Corfu, Patras, Delphi, Zante, Athens, Smyrna and Constantinople, providing passengers with excursions and guided tours.

P&amp;O first introduced passenger-cruising services in 1844, advertising sea tours to destinations such as Gibraltar, Malta and Athens, sailing from Southampton. The forerunner of modern cruise holidays, these voyages were the first of their kind. P&amp;O Cruises is the world&#x27;s oldest cruise line. The company later introduced round trips to destinations such as Alexandria and Constantinople. It underwent a period of rapid expansion in the latter half of the 19th century, commissioning larger and more luxurious ships to serve the steadily expanding market. Notable ships of the era include built in 1880, which became the first ship built with a total steel superstructure, and built in 1889.
The cruise of in the Mediterranean and the Near East from 22 January to 22 March 1891, with 241 passengers including Albert Ballin and wife themselves, is often stated to have been the first ever cruise. Christian Wilhelm Allers published an illustrated account of it as &quot;Backschisch&quot;.

The first vessel built exclusively for luxury cruising was of the German Empire, designed by Albert Ballin, general manager of the Hamburg-America Line. The ship was completed in 1900.

The practice of luxury cruising made steady inroads into the more established market for transatlantic crossings. In the competition for passengers, ocean liners – being the most famous example – added luxuries such as fine dining, luxury services, and staterooms with finer appointments. In the late-19th century, Albert Ballin, director of the Hamburg-America Line, was the first to send his transatlantic ships out on long southern cruises during the worst of the North Atlantic winter seasons. Other companies followed suit. Some of them built specialized ships designed for easy transformation between summer crossings and winter cruising.

In 1897 three luxury liners, all European-owned, offered transportation between Europe and North America. In 1906 the number had increased to seven. The British Inman Line owned , the Cunard Line had and . The White Star Line owned and . &quot;La Lorraine&quot; and &quot;La Savoie&quot; sailed for the French Compagnie Générale Transatlantique.

===From luxury ocean liners to &quot;megaship&quot; cruising===
Modern cruise ships tend to have less hull strength, speed, and agility compared to ocean liners.

With the advent of large passenger jet aircraft in the 1960s, intercontinental travelers switched from ships to planes, sending the ocean liner trade into a terminal decline. Certain characteristics of older ocean liners made them unsuitable for cruising duties, such as high fuel consumption, deep draught preventing them from entering shallow ports, and cabins (often windowless) designed to maximize passenger numbers rather than comfort. In the late 1950s and 1960s, ships such as Holland America Line&#x27;s (1959), the French Line&#x27;s (1961), and Cunard Line&#x27;s RMS (1969) were designed to serve the dual purposes of ocean liner during the northern hemisphere summer months and cruise ship in the winter, incorporating doors and baffles that could be open or closed to divide classes or open the ship to one class, wherein all passengers received roughly the same quality berthing and most of the same facilities. (Passengers in cabins in certain grades on the &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; had access only to certain dining rooms).

Ocean liner services almost ceased in the 1970s and 1980s. The &quot;Rotterdam&quot; was put on permanent cruise service in 1968, while the &quot;France&quot; (at the time the largest passenger vessel in the world) was mothballed in 1974, sold to Norwegian Cruise Line in 1979, and after major renovations relaunched as in 1980, thus becoming the first &quot;mega-cruise ship&quot;. The main exception was Cunard&#x27;s &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;: although being put on more cruises, she maintained the regular transatlantic crossing tradition throughout the year, but with a stronger focus on leisure passengers, catering to a niche market of those who appreciated the several days at sea. International celebrities were hired to perform acts on board, along with cabarets, and with the addition of a casino and other entertainment amenities, the crossing was advertised as a vacation in itself.

The 1977–1986 television series &quot;The Love Boat&quot; helped to popularize the concept as a romantic opportunity for couples. Industry experts credit the series with increasing interest in the cruise industry, especially for those that weren&#x27;t newlyweds or senior citizens, and for the resulting demand to spur investment in new ships instead of conversions. The influence was particularly notable for Princess Cruises, a line that partnered with the series and received a great deal of attention as a result.

Contemporary cruise ships built in the late 1980s and later, such as the which broke the size record held for decades by &quot;Norway&quot;, showed characteristics of size once reserved for ocean liners. The &quot;Sovereign&quot;-class ships were the first &quot;megaships&quot; to be built specifically for the mass cruising market. They also were the first series of cruise ships to include a multi-story lobby with a glass elevator and had a single deck devoted entirely to cabins with private balconies, instead of oceanview cabins. Other cruise lines soon launched ships with similar attributes, such as the , leading up to the Panamax-type , designed such that two-thirds of the oceanview staterooms have balconies. As the veranda suites were particularly lucrative for cruise lines, something which was lacking in older ocean liners, recent cruise ships have been designed to maximize such amenities and have been described as &quot;balcony-laden floating condominiums&quot;.
Until 1975–1980, cruises offered shuffleboard, deck chairs, &quot;drinks with umbrellas and little else for a few hundred passengers&quot;. After 1980, they offered increasing amenities. As of 2010, city-sized ships have dozens of amenities.

There have been nine or more new cruise ships added every year since 2001, including the 11 members of the aforementioned Vista class, and all at or greater. The only actual ocean liner to be completed in recent years has been Cunard Line&#x27;s in 2004. Following the retirement of her running mate &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; in November 2008, &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot; is the only liner operating on scheduled transatlantic service, though she also sees significant service on cruise routes.

&quot;Queen Mary 2&quot; was for a time the largest passenger ship before being surpassed by Royal Caribbean International&#x27;s vessels in 2006. The &quot;Freedom&quot;-class ships were in turn overtaken by RCI&#x27;s own vessels which entered service in 2009 and 2010. A distinctive feature of the &quot;Oasis&quot;-class ships is the split, atrium structure, made possible by the hull&#x27;s extraordinary width, with the 6-deck high Central Park and Boardwalk outdoor areas running down the middle of the ship and verandas on all decks.

In two short decades (1988–2009), the largest class cruise ships have grown a third longer (), doubled their widths (), nearly tripled the total passenger count (2,744 to 7,600), and more than tripled in volume (73,000 to 248,000 GT). Also, the &quot;megaships&quot; went from a single deck with verandas to all decks with verandas.

 there were 302 cruise ships operating worldwide, with a combined capacity of 664,602 passengers. Cruising has become a major part of the tourism industry, with an estimated market of $29.4 billion per year, and over 19 million passengers carried worldwide annually . The industry&#x27;s rapid growth saw nine or more newly built ships catering to a North American clientele added every year since 2001, as well as others servicing European clientele until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 saw the entire industry all but shut down. The average age of a cruise ship in 2024 is 17.5 years.

==Cruise lines==

Operators of cruise ships are known as cruise lines, which are companies that sell cruises to the public. Cruise lines have a dual character; they are partly in the transportation business, and partly in the leisure entertainment business, a duality that carries down into the ships themselves, which have both a crew headed by the ship&#x27;s captain, and a hospitality staff headed by the equivalent of a hotel manager. Among cruise lines, some are direct descendants of the traditional passenger shipping lines (such as Cunard), while others were founded from the 1960s specifically for cruising.

Historically, the cruise ship business has been volatile. The ships are large capital investments with high operating costs. A persistent decrease in bookings can put a company in financial jeopardy. Cruise lines have sold, renovated, or renamed their ships to keep up with travel trends. Cruise lines operate their ships almost constantly. If the maintenance is unscheduled, it can result, potentially, in thousands of dissatisfied customers.

A wave of failures and consolidations in the 1990s led to many cruise lines being bought by much larger holding companies and continue to operate as &quot;brands&quot; or subsidiaries of the holding company. Brands continue to be maintained partly because of the expectation of repeat customer loyalty, and also to offer different levels of quality and service. For instance, Carnival Corporation &amp; plc owns both Carnival Cruise Line, whose former image were vessels that had a reputation as &quot;party ships&quot; for younger travelers, but have become large, modern, yet still profitable, as well as Holland America Line and Cunard Line, whose ships cultivate an image of classic elegance. In 2004, Carnival had merged Cunard&#x27;s headquarters with that of Princess Cruises in Santa Clarita, California so that administrative, financial and technology services could be combined, ending Cunard&#x27;s history where it had operated as a standalone company (subsidiary) regardless of parent ownership. However, Cunard did regain some independence in 2009 when its headquarters were moved to Carnival House in Southampton.
The common practice in the cruise industry in listing cruise ship transfers and orders is to list the smaller operating company, not the larger holding corporation, as the recipient cruise line of the sale, transfer, or new order. In other words, Carnival Cruise Line and Holland America Line, for example, are the cruise lines from this common industry practice point of view; whereas Carnival Corporation &amp; plc and Royal Caribbean Group, for example, can be considered holding corporations of cruise lines. This industry practice of using the smaller operating company, not the larger holding corporation, is also followed in the list of cruise lines and in member-based reviews of cruise lines.

Some cruise lines have specialties; for example, Saga Cruises only allows passengers over 50 years old aboard their ships, and Star Clippers and formerly Windjammer Barefoot Cruises and Windstar Cruises only operate tall ships. Regent Seven Seas Cruises operates medium-sized vessels—smaller than the &quot;megaships&quot; of Carnival and Royal Caribbean—designed such that virtually all of their suites are balconies. Several specialty lines offer &quot;expedition cruising&quot; or only operate small ships, visiting certain destinations such as the Arctic and Antarctica, or the Galápagos Islands. , which formerly operated as part of the United States Merchant Marine during World War II before being converted to a museum ship, still gets underway several times a year for six-hour &quot;Living History Cruises&quot; that take the ship through Baltimore Harbor, down the Patapsco River, and into the Chesapeake Bay, and she is also the largest cruise ship operating under the American flag on the United States East Coast.

Currently the three largest cruise line holding companies and operators in the world are Carnival Corporation &amp; plc, Royal Caribbean Group and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings.

As an industry, the total number of cabins on all of the world&#x27;s cruise ships amount to less than 2% of the world&#x27;s hotel rooms.

==Organization==


Cruise ships are organized much like floating hotels, with a complete hospitality staff in addition to the usual ship&#x27;s crew. It is not uncommon for the most luxurious ships to have more crew and staff than passengers.

===Dining===
Dining on almost all cruise ships is included in the cruise price. Traditionally, the ships&#x27; restaurants organize two dinner services per day, early dining and late dining, and passengers are allocated a set dining time for the entire cruise; a recent trend is to allow diners to dine whenever they want. Having two dinner times allows the ship to have enough time and space to accommodate all of its guests. Having two different dinner services can cause some conflicts with some of the ship&#x27;s events (such as shows and performances) for the late diners, but this problem is usually fixed by having a shorter version of the event take place before late dinner. Cunard Line ships maintain the class tradition of ocean liners and have separate dining rooms for different types of suites, while Celebrity Cruises and Princess Cruises have a standard dining room and &quot;upgrade&quot; specialty restaurants that require pre-booking and cover charges. Many cruises schedule one or more &quot;formal dining&quot; nights. Guests dress &quot;formally&quot;, however, that is defined for the ship, often suits and ties or even tuxedos for men, and formal dresses for women. The menu is more upscale than usual.

Besides the dining room, modern cruise ships often contain one or more casual buffet-style eateries, which may be open 24 hours and with menus that vary throughout the day to provide meals ranging from breakfast to late-night snacks. In recent years, cruise lines have started to include a diverse range of ethnically themed restaurants aboard each ship. Ships also feature numerous bars and nightclubs for passenger entertainment; the majority of cruise lines do not include alcoholic beverages in their fares and passengers are expected to pay for drinks as they consume them. Most cruise lines also prohibit passengers from bringing aboard and consuming their own beverages, including alcohol, while aboard. Alcohol purchased duty-free is sealed and returned to passengers when they disembark.

There is often a central galley responsible for serving all major restaurants aboard the ship, though specialty restaurants may have their own separate galleys.

As with any vessel, adequate provisioning is crucial, especially on a cruise ship serving several thousand meals at each seating. For example, a quasi &quot;military operation&quot; is required to load and unload 3,600 passengers and eight tons of food at the beginning and end of each cruise, for the .

===Other on-board facilities===

Modern cruise ships typically have aboard some or all of the following facilities:
* Buffet restaurant
* Card room
* Casino – Only open when the ship is at sea to avoid conflict with local laws
* Child care facilities
* Cinema
* Clubs
* Fitness center
* Hot tub
* Indoor and/or outdoor swimming pool with water slides
* Infirmary and morgue
* Karaoke
* Library
* Lounges
* Observation lounge
* Ping pong tables
* Pool tables
* Shops – Only open when the ship is at sea to avoid merchandising licensing and local taxes
* Spa
* Teen lounges
* Theatre with Broadway-style shows

Some ships have bowling alleys, ice skating rinks, rock climbing walls, sky-diving simulators, miniature golf courses, video arcades, ziplines, surfing simulators, water slides, basketball courts, tennis courts, chain restaurants, ropes obstacle courses, and even roller coasters.

===Crew===
Crew are usually hired on three to eleven month contracts which may then be renewed as mutually agreed, depending on service ratings from passengers as well as the cyclical nature of the cruise line operator. Most staff work 77-hour work weeks for 10 months continuously followed by two months of vacation.

There are no paid vacations or pensions for service, non-management crew, depending on the level of the position and the type of the contract. Non-service and management crew members get paid vacation, medical, retirement options, and can participate in the company&#x27;s group insurance plan.

The direct salary is low by North American standards, though restaurant staff have considerable earning potential from passenger tips. Crew members do not have any expenses while on board, because food and accommodation, medical care, and transportation for most employees, are included. Bard College at Simon&#x27;s Rock professor Francisca Oyogoa states that &quot;Crewing agencies often exploit the desperation of potential employees.&quot;

Living arrangements vary by cruise line, but mostly by shipboard position. In general two employees share a cabin with a shower, commode and a desk with a television set, while senior officers are assigned single cabins. There is a set of facilities for the crew separate from that for passengers, such as mess rooms and bars, recreation rooms, prayer rooms/mosques, and fitness center, with some larger ships even having a crew deck with a swimming pool and hot tubs.

The International Labour Organization&#x27;s 2006 Maritime Labour Convention is also known as the &quot;Seafarers&#x27; Bill of Rights&quot;.

===Business model===
Most cruise lines since the 2000s have to some extent priced the cruising experience &quot;à la carte&quot;, as passenger spending aboard generates significantly more than ticket sales. The passenger&#x27;s ticket includes the stateroom accommodation, room service, unlimited meals in the main dining room (or main restaurant) and buffet, access to shows, and use of pool and gym facilities, while there is a daily gratuity charge to cover housekeeping and waiter service. However, there are extra charges for alcohol and soft drinks, official cruise photos, Internet and wi-fi access, and specialty restaurants. Cruise lines earn significantly from selling onshore excursions offered by local contractors; keeping 50% or more of what passengers spend for these tours. In addition, cruise ships earn significant commissions on sales from onshore stores that are promoted on board as &quot;preferred&quot; (as much as 40% of gross sales). Facilitating this practice are modern cruise terminals with establishments of duty-free shops inside a perimeter accessible only by passengers and not by locals. Ports of call have often oriented their own businesses and facilities towards meeting the needs of visiting cruise ships. In one case, Icy Strait Point in Alaska, the entire destination was created explicitly and solely for cruise ship visitors.

On &quot;cruises to nowhere&quot; or &quot;nowhere voyages&quot;, some cruise ships make two- to three-night round trips without visiting any ports of call.

Travel to and from the port of departure is usually the passengers&#x27; responsibility, although purchasing a transfer pass from the cruise line for the trip between the airport and cruise terminal will guarantee that the ship will not leave until the passenger is aboard. Similarly, if the passenger books a shore excursion with the cruise line and the tour runs late, the ship is obliged to remain until the passenger returns.

Luxury cruise lines such as Regent Seven Seas Cruises and Crystal Cruises market their fares as &quot;all-inclusive&quot;. For example, the base fare on Regent Seven Seas ships includes most alcoholic beverages on board ship and most shore excursions in ports of call, as well as all gratuities that would normally be paid to hotel staff on the ship. The fare may also include a one-night hotel stay before boarding, and the air fare to and from the cruise&#x27;s origin and destination ports.

Many cruise lines have loyalty programs. Using these and by booking inexpensive tickets, some people have found it cheaper to live continuously on cruise ships instead of on land.

Some cruises incorporate themes in an experience economy offering, such as sports or leisure activities, food, or history. The High Seas Rally is one such themed cruise, combining a cruise and a motorcycle rally.

===Cruise ship utilization===
Cruise ships and former liners sometimes find use in applications other than those for which they were built. Due to slower speed and reduced seaworthiness, as well as being largely introduced after several major wars, cruise ships have also been used as troop transport vessels. By contrast, ocean liners were often seen as the pride of their country and used to rival liners of other nations, and have been requisitioned during both World Wars and the Falklands War to transport soldiers and serve as hospital ships.

During the 1992 Summer Olympics, eleven cruise ships docked at the Port of Barcelona for an average of 18 days, served as floating hotels to help accommodate the large influx of visitors to the Games. They were available to sponsors and hosted 11,000 guests a day, making it the second largest concentration of Olympic accommodation behind the Olympic Village. This hosting solution has been used since then in Games held in coastal cities, such as at Sydney 2000, Athens 2004, London 2012, Sochi 2014, Rio 2016 and was going to be used at Tokyo 2020.

Cruise ships have been used to accommodate displaced persons during hurricanes. For example, on 1 September 2005, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) contracted three Carnival Cruise Lines vessels (, the former , and the ) to house Hurricane Katrina evacuees. In 2017, cruise ships were used to help transport residents from some Caribbean islands destroyed by Hurricane Irma, as well as Puerto Rico residents displaced by Hurricane Maria.

The cruise ships have also been used for evacuations. In 2010, in response to the shutdown of UK airspace due to the eruption of Iceland&#x27;s Eyjafjallajökull volcano, the newly completed was used to rescue 2,000 British tourists stranded in Spain as an act of goodwill by the owners. The ship departed from Southampton for Bilbao on 21 April, and returned on 23 April. A cruise ship was kept on standby in case inhabitants of Kangaroo Island required evacuation in 2020 after a series of fires burned on the island.

==Regional industries==
Most cruise ships sail the Caribbean or the Mediterranean. Others operate elsewhere in places like Alaska, the South Pacific, the Baltic Sea and New England. A cruise ship that is moving from one of these regions to another will commonly operate a repositioning cruise while doing so. Expedition cruise lines, which usually operate small ships, visit certain more specialized destinations such as the Arctic and Antarctica, or the Galápagos Islands.

The number of cruise tourists worldwide in 2005 was estimated at some 14 million. The main region for cruising was North America (70% of cruises), where the Caribbean islands were the most popular destinations.

The second most popular region was continental Europe (13%), where the fastest growing segment is cruises in the Baltic Sea. The most visited Baltic ports are Copenhagen, St. Petersburg, Tallinn, Stockholm and Helsinki.
The seaport of St. Petersburg, the main Baltic port of call, received 426,500 passengers during the 2009 cruise season.

According to 2010 CEMAR statistics the Mediterranean cruise market is going through a fast and fundamental change; Italy has won prime position as a destination for European cruises, and destination for the whole of the Mediterranean basin. The most visited ports in Mediterranean Sea are Barcelona (Spain), Civitavecchia (Italy), Palma (Spain) and Venice (Italy).

The first Chinese cruise company entered service in 2013. China&#x27;s first luxury cruise ship, &quot;Henna&quot;, made her maiden voyage from Sanya Phoenix Island International Port in late January.

===Caribbean cruising industry===

The Caribbean cruising industry is one of the largest in the world, responsible for over $2 billion in direct revenue to the Caribbean islands in 2012. Over 45,000 people from the Caribbean are directly employed in the cruise industry. An estimated 17,457,600 cruise passengers visited the islands in the 2011–2012 cruise year (May 2011 to April 2012.) Cruise lines operating in the Caribbean include Royal Caribbean International, Princess Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Celebrity Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, Holland America, P&amp;O, Cunard and Norwegian Cruise Line. There are also smaller cruise lines that cater to a more intimate feeling among their guests. The three largest cruise operators are Carnival Corporation, Royal Caribbean International, and Star Cruises/Norwegian Cruise Lines.

Many American cruise lines to the Caribbean depart out of the Port of Miami, with &quot;nearly one-third of the cruises sailing out of Miami in recent years&quot;. Other cruise ships depart from Port Everglades (in Fort Lauderdale), Port Canaveral (approximately east of Orlando), New York, Tampa, Galveston, New Orleans, Cape Liberty, Baltimore, Jacksonville, Charleston, Norfolk, Mobile, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Some UK cruise lines base their ships out of Barbados for the Caribbean season, operating direct charter flights out of the UK.

The busiest ports of call in the Caribbean for cruising in the 2014 year are listed below:

=== Alaskan cruising industry ===
2016 was the most recent year of CLIA (Cruise Lines International Association) studies conducted around the cruise industry specifically in the US and more specifically Alaska. In 2016, Alaskan cruises generated nearly 5 million passenger and crew visits, 20.3% of all passenger and crew visits in the US. (NASDAQ, 2017) Cruise lines frequently bring passengers to Glacier Bay National Park, Ketchikan, Anchorage, Skagway, and the state&#x27;s capital, Juneau.

Visitor volume is represented by overall visitors entering Alaskan waters and/or airspace. Between October 2016 and September 2017 Alaska had about 2.2 million visitors; 49% of those were through the cruise industry. That 2.2 million was a 27% increase since 2009, and the volume overall has steadily increased. Visitors generally spend money when travelling, and this is measured in two distinct areas: the cruising companies themselves and the visitors. There are no current numbers for cruise specific passenger spending ashore, but the overall visitor expenditure can be measured. Tours accounted for $394 million (18%), gifts and souvenirs $427 million (20%), food $428 million (20%), transportation $258 million (12%), lodging $454 million (21%), and other $217 million (10%). The second main area of economic growth comes from what the cruising companies and their crews spend themselves. Cruise liners spend around $297 million on the items that come in their packages on board and ashore as parts of group tours: things like stagecoach rides and boat tours on smaller vessels throughout their ports of call. This money is paid to the service providers by the cruise line company. Cruise liner crew are also a revenue generator, with 27,000 crew members visiting Alaska in 2017 alone, generating about $22 million. 2017 was also a good year for job generation within Alaska: 43,300 jobs were created, bringing in $1.5 billion in labor costs, and a total income of $4.5 billion was generated. These jobs were scattered across all of Alaska. Southeast Alaska had 11,925 jobs ($455 million labor income), Southwest 1,800 jobs ($50 million labor income), South Central 20,700 jobs ($761 million Labor income), Interior 8,500 jobs ($276 million labor income), Far North 375 jobs ($13 M labor income). Labor income is shown in the graph below.
==Shipyards==

The construction market for cruise ships is dominated by three European companies and one Asian company:
* Chantiers de l’Atlantique of France.
* Fincantieri of Italy with:
** Ancona shipyards (located at Ancona)
** Marghera shipyards (located at Marghera, Venice)
** Monfalcone shipyards (located at Monfalcone, Gorizia)
** Sestri Ponente shipyards (located at Genoa)
** VARD Braila shipyards (located at Braila)
** VARD Søviknes Shipyard (located in Norway)
** VARD Tulcea shipyards (located at Tulcea)
* Meyer Werft of Germany with two shipyards:
** Meyer Turku at Perno shipyard in Turku, Finland
** Meyer Werft of Germany.
* Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan.

, 54 new ships have been ordered and are due to be delivered by 2028.

As of August 2024, there are 62 ships on order until 2036, adding 154,146 berths.

==Safety and security==
===Piracy===

As most of the passengers on a cruise are affluent and have considerable ransom potential, not to mention a considerable amount of cash and jewelry on board (for example in casinos and shops), there have been several high-profile pirate attacks on cruise ships, such as on and .

As a result, cruise ships have implemented various security measures. While most merchant shipping firms have generally avoided arming crew or security guards for reasons of safety, liability and conformity with the laws of the countries where they dock, cruise ships have small arms (usually semi-automatic pistols) stored in a safe accessible only by the captain who distributes them to authorized personnel such as security or the master-at-arms. The ship&#x27;s high-pressure fire hoses can be used to keep boarders at bay, and often the vessel itself can be maneuvered to ram pirate craft. A recent technology to deter pirates has been the LRAD or sonic cannon which was used in the successful defence of &quot;Seabourn Spirit&quot;.

A related risk is that of terrorism, the most notable incident being that of the 1985 hijacking of &quot;Achille Lauro&quot;, an Italian cruise ship.

===Crime on-board===
Passengers entering the cruise ship are screened by metal detectors. Explosive detection machines used include X-ray machines and explosives trace-detection portal machines (a.k.a. &quot;puffer machines&quot;), to prevent weapons, drugs and other contraband on board. Security has been considerably tightened since 11 September 2001, such that these measures are similar to airport security.

In addition to security checkpoints, passengers are often given a ship-specific identification card, which must be shown in order to get on or off the ship. This prevents people boarding who are not entitled to do so, and also ensures the ship&#x27;s crew are aware of who is on the ship. The Cruise Ship ID cards are also used as the passenger&#x27;s room key. CCTV cameras are mounted frequently throughout the ship.

In 2010, the United States Congress passed the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act after numerous incidents of sexual violence, passenger disappearances, physical assault, and other serious crimes. Congress said:

Passengers on cruise vessels have an inadequate appreciation of their potential vulnerability to crime while on ocean voyages, and those who may be victimized lack the information they need to understand their legal rights or to know whom to contact for help in the immediate aftermath of the crime.

Congress said both passengers and crew committed crimes. It said data on the problem was lacking because cruise lines did not make it publicly available, multiple countries were involved in investigating incidents on international waters, and crime scenes could not be secured quickly by police. It recommended that owners of cruise vessels:
* install acoustic hailing and warning devices capable of working at a distance.
* install more security cameras
* install peep holes in passenger room doors
* limit access to passenger rooms to select staff at specific times

After investigating the death of Dianne Brimble in 2002, a coroner in Australia recommended:
* Federal police officers travel on ships to ensure a quick response to crime,
* scanners and drug detection dogs check passengers and crew at Australian ports,
* an end to overlaps between jurisdictions, and
* flags of ships be disregarded for nations unable to investigate incidents thoroughly and competently.

The lobby group International Cruise Victims Association, based in Arizona, pushes for more regulation of the cruise industry, and supports victims of crimes committed on cruise ships.

===Overboard drownings===
Passengers and crew sometimes drown after going overboard in what the industry calls &quot;man-overboard incidents&quot; (MOBs). From 2000 to 2018 more than 300 people fell off cruise ships or large ferries, which is an average of about 1.5 people each month. Of those, only about 17 to 25 percent were rescued. Critics of the industry blame alcohol promotion for many passenger deaths, and poor labour conditions for crew suicides. They also point to underinvestment in the latest MOB sensors, a lack of regulation and consumer protection, and a lack of on-board counselling services for crew. The industry blames irresponsible behaviour by passengers, and says overboard sensors are unreliable and generate false alarms.

Maritime lawyer Jim Walker estimates about half of all disappearances at sea involve some factor of foul play, and that a lack of police jurisdiction on international waters allows sexual predators to go unpunished.

===Stability===

Modern cruise ships are tall but remain stable due to their relatively low center of mass. This is due to large open spaces and the extensive use of aluminium, high-strength steel and other lightweight materials in the upper parts, and the fact that the heaviest components—engines, propellers, fuel tanks and such—are located at the bottom of the hull. Thus, even though modern cruise ships may appear tall, proper weight distribution ensures that they are not top-heavy. Furthermore, large cruise ships tend to be very wide, which considerably increases their initial stability by increasing the metacentric height.

Although most passenger ships utilize stabilizers to reduce rolling in heavy weather, they are only used for crew and passenger comfort and do not contribute to the overall intact stability of the vessel. The ships must fulfill all stability requirements even with the stabilizer fins retracted.

According to the &quot;Washington Post,&quot; a recent study by economic consultant G.P. Wild – commissioned by the cruise industry&#x27;s trade group and released in March 2019 – argued that cruises are getting safer over time. The study claims that, even as capacity increased 55 percent between 2009 and 2018, the number of overall &quot;operational incidents&quot; declined 37 percent and the rate of man-overboard cases dropped 35 percent.

===Disease===
====Norovirus====
Norovirus is a virus that commonly causes gastroenteritis, and is also a cause of gastroenteritis on cruise ships. It is typically transmitted from person to person. Symptoms usually last between 1 and 3 days and generally resolve without treatment or long term consequences. The incubation period of the virus averages about 24 hours.

Norovirus outbreaks are often perceived to be associated with cruise ships. According to the United States CDC, the factors that cause norovirus to be associated with cruise ships include the closer tracking and faster reporting of illnesses on cruise ships compared to those on land; the closer living quarters that increases the amount of interpersonal contact; as well as the turnover of passengers that may bring the viruses on board.

However, the estimated likelihood of contracting gastroenteritis from any cause on an average 7-day cruise is less than 1%. In 2009, during which more than 13 million people took a cruise, there were nine reported norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships. Outbreak investigations by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have shown that transmission among cruise ship passengers is primarily person-to-person; potable water supplies have not been implicated. In a study published in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;, the CDC reported that, &quot;Perceptions that cruise ships can be luxury breeding grounds for acute gastroenteritis outbreaks don&#x27;t hold water. A recent CDC report showed that from 2008 to 2014, only 0.18% of more than 73 million cruise passengers and 0.15% of some 28 million crew members reported symptoms of the illness.&quot;

Ships docked in port undergo surprise health inspections. In 2009, ships that underwent unannounced inspections by the CDC received an average CDC Vessel Sanitation Program score of approximately 97 out of a total possible 100 points. The minimum passing inspection score is 85. Collaboration with the CDC&#x27;s Vessel Sanitation Program and the development of Outbreak Prevention and Response Plans has been credited in decreasing the incidence of norovirus outbreaks on ships.

====Legionnaires&#x27; disease====
Other pathogens which can colonise pools and spas including those on cruise ships include &quot;Legionella&quot;, the bacterium which causes Legionnaires&#x27; disease. &quot;Legionella&quot;, and in particular the most virulent strain, &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot; serogroup 1, can cause infections when inhaled as an aerosol or aspirated. Individuals who are immunocompromised and those with pre-existing chronic respiratory and cardiac disease are more susceptible. Legionnaires&#x27; has been infrequently associated with cruise ships.

====Enterotoxigenic &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (ETEC)====
Enterotoxigenic &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; is a form of &quot;E. coli&quot; and the leading bacterial cause of diarrhea in the developing world, as well as the most common cause of diarrhea for travelers to those areas. Since 2008 there has been at least one reported incident each year of &quot;E. coli&quot; on international cruise ships reported to the Vessel Sanitation Program of the Centers for Disease Control, though there were none in 2015. Causes of &quot;E. coli&quot; infection include the consumption of contaminated food or water contaminated by human waste.

==== COVID-19 ====

News outlets reported several cases and suspected cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 associated with cruise ships in early 2020. Authorities variously turned away ships or quarantined them; cruise operators cancelled some port visits and ultimately suspended global cruise operations. People aboard cruise ships played a role in spreading the disease in some countries.

==Environmental impact==

Cruise ships generate a number of waste streams that can result in discharges to the marine environment, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste. They also emit air pollutants to the air and water. These wastes, if not properly treated and disposed of, can be a significant source of pathogens, nutrients, and toxic substances with the potential to threaten human health and damage aquatic life.

Most cruise ships run (primarily) on heavy fuel oil (HFO), or &quot;bunker fuel&quot;, which, because of its high sulphur content, results in sulphur dioxide emissions worse than those of equivalent road traffic. The international MARPOL IV-14 agreement for Sulphur Emission Control Areas requires that cruise ships must use fuel containing no more than 0.10% sulphur or make use of exhaust gas scrubbers to reduce sulfur oxide emissions to no worse than an engine running on &lt;0.1% sulfur fuel. Cruise ships may use 60 percent of the fuel energy for propulsion, and 40 percent for hotel functions, but loads and distribution depend highly on conditions.

It has been claimed that air pollution from maritime transport, including cruise ships, is responsible for 50,000 deaths per year in Europe.

Some cruise lines, such as Cunard, are taking steps to reduce environmental impact by refraining from discharges (&quot;Queen Mary 2&quot; has a zero-discharge policy) and reducing their carbon dioxide output every year.

Cruise ships require electrical power, normally provided by diesel generators, although an increasing number of new ships are fueled by liquified natural gas (LNG). When docked, ships must run their generators continuously to power on-board facilities, unless they are capable of using onshore power, where available. Some cruise ships already support the use of shore power, while others are being adapted to do so.

== Overtourism ==
Large cruise ships have been identified as one of the major causes of overtourism in places like Venice, Barcelona, and Dubrovnik.

Critics of the industry say it overwhelms the cities&#x27; infrastructure, causing overcrowding, damaging heritage sites, and changing the character of local neighbourhoods – as residential amenities and shops are replaced by tourist cafes and souvenir stands.

Cruise tourists contribute little economically to the places they visit. In Venice, short stay day trippers – including cruise tourists – account for 73% of all visitors, yet only contribute to 18% of the tourism economy. By contrast overnight visitors contribute 50%.

In Venice, campaigners have long been calling for a ban on large cruise ships entering the historic portion of the city. In 2021, they were successful. Ships weighing over 25,000 tonnes were banned from entering the Venice Lagoon along the Giudecca Canal in an attempt to protect the fragile lagoon ecosystem and to limit the damage to the underwater foundations of the city&#x27;s historic centre. At the time, UNESCO warned the city could be placed on its endangered list if ships were not diverted to another port.

In 2023, Barcelona Mayor, Ada Colau, spoke out in favour of limiting the number of cruise ships arriving in the city. Currently up to 200,000 people disembark each month in peak season, Colau&#x27;s new measures could halve this. In a 2019 study by Transport and Environment, Barcelona ranked as the worst cruise port for air pollution in Europe.

From 2024, only 1,000 cruise passengers per day will be allowed to disembark in Bar Harbor, Maine, United States. The average cruise ship holds 3,000 passengers. The move came after a 2021 survey showed the majority of local residents were unhappy with large cruise ships, and felt that the town was overrun by cruise tourists.

<doc id="314856" wikidata="Q52052" url="?curid=314856" title="Korea Strait">
<text>The Korea Strait is a sea passage in East Asia between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. It connects the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan in the northwest Pacific Ocean. The strait is split by Tsushima Island into two parts: the Western Channel, and the Tsushima Strait or Eastern Channel. It is economically important, as many shipping lanes pass through the strait, and both Japan and South Korea allow free passage through it.

In ancient times, both Buddhism and Mongol invaders passed over the strait to reach Japan. More recently, it was the site of the 1950 Battle of Korea Strait during the Korean War. A tunnel running underneath the strait connecting Japan and Korea, the Japan–Korea Undersea Tunnel, has been proposed to connect the two countries.

==Geography==
To the north, the Korea Strait is bounded by the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula. And to the south, it by the southwestern Japanese islands of Kyūshū and Honshū. It is about wide and averages about 90 to 100 meters (300 ft) deep.

Tsushima Island divides the Korea Strait into the western channel and the Tsushima Strait. The western channel is deeper (up to 227 meters) and narrower than the Tsushima Strait.

==Currents==
A branch of the Kuroshio Current passes through the strait. Its warm branch is sometimes called the Tsushima Current. Originating along the Japanese islands this current passes through the Sea of Japan then divides along either shore of Sakhalin Island, eventually flowing into the northern Pacific Ocean via the strait north of Hokkaidō and into the Sea of Okhotsk north of Sakhalin Island near Vladivostok. The water-mass characteristics vary widely because of the low-salinity waters of the southeast coasts of Korea and China.

==Economic significance==
Numerous international shipping lanes pass through the strait, including those carrying much of the traffic bound for the ports of southern South Korea. Both South Korea and Japan have restricted their territorial claims in the strait to from shore, so as to permit free passage through it.

Passenger ferries travel numerous routes across the strait. Commercial ferries run from South Korean Busan, Geoje to Japanese ports including Fukuoka, Tsushima, Shimonoseki, and Hiroshima. Ferries also connect Tsushima Island with Fukuoka, and South Korea&#x27;s Jeju Island with the Korean mainland. Ferries connecting Busan and Japanese cities with ports in China also traverse the strait.

Japan&#x27;s territorial waters extend to three nautical miles (5.6 km) into the strait instead of the usual twelve, reportedly to allow nuclear-armed United States Navy warships and submarines to transit the strait without violating Japan&#x27;s prohibition against nuclear weapons in its territory.

==Naming of the strait==
==Historic impact==
===Land bridge===

During the Pleistocene glacial cycles, the Korea Strait and the Bering Straits, and the Yellow Sea were often narrowed and the Japanese islands may at times have been connected to the Eurasian Continent through the Korean Peninsula or Sakhalin. At times, the Sea of Japan was said to be a frozen inner lake due to the lack of warm Tsushima Current and various plants and large animals, such as the &quot;Palaeoloxodon naumanni&quot; are believed to have spread into Japan.

===Early history===
Historically, these narrows served as a highway for high risk voyages. The shortest distance between Busan, South Korea, and Tsushima Island is about 50 km, as is the shortest distance from Tsushima to Iki Island, Japan.

In the 6th century, Buddhism (Mahāyāna Buddhism) was transmitted by Baekje people to the easternmost Japan of the Emperor Kinmei&#x27;s era over this strait (&quot;See also&quot;: East Asian Buddhism and Buddhism in Japan).

===Mongol invasion===

A joint Mongol-Korea fleet crossed this strait and attempted to invade Japan in 1274 and 1281. The force severely ravaged the Tsushima Island on the way to Japan but failed to defeat Japan.

===Wokou and Ōei Invasion===

After the Mongolian invasion ravaged Tsushima, it became a base of the Wokou (Japanese pirates). The Korean Joseon dynasty sent a fleet to Tsushima in 1419 for the suppression of Wokou activity. Korea subsequently agreed to grant the Japanese limited trading privileges.

===Battle of Tsushima===

The Battle of Tsushima, fought between the Japanese and Russian navies on May 27 and May 28, 1905, took place in the Tsushima Strait part of the Korea Strait, east of the north part of Tsushima and due north of Iki Island. The Russian fleet was destroyed by the Japanese.

===Battle of Korea Strait===

The Battle of Korea Strait was a naval battle fought on the first day of the Korean War, 25–26 June 1950, between the navies of South Korea and North Korea. A North Korean troop transport carrying hundreds of soldiers attempted to land its cargo near Busan but was encountered by a South Korean patrol ship and sunk. It was one of the first surface actions of the war and resulted in an important South Korean victory.

===Future===
The possibility of a Japan–Korea Undersea Tunnel or bridge, similar to the Channel Tunnel running under the English Channel between France and the United Kingdom, has been discussed for decades.

<doc id="314859" wikidata="Q1646950" url="?curid=314859" title="John Barleycorn">
<text>&quot;John Barleycorn&quot; is an English and Scottish folk song. The song&#x27;s protagonist is John Barleycorn, a personification of barley and of the beer made from it. In the song, he suffers indignities, attacks, and death that correspond to the various stages of barley cultivation, such as reaping and malting. 

The song may have its origins in ancient English or Scottish folklore, with written evidence of the song dating it at least as far back as the Elizabethan era. It is listed as number 164 in the Roud Folk Song Index. The oldest versions are Scottish and include the Scots poem &quot;Quhy Sowld Nocht Allane Honorit Be&quot;. In 1782, the Scottish poet Robert Burns published his own version of the song, which influenced subsequent versions. 

The song survived into the twentieth century in the oral folk tradition, primarily in England, and many popular folk revival artists have recorded versions of the song. In most traditional versions, including the sixteenth century Scottish version entitled &quot;Alan-a-Maut&quot;, the plant&#x27;s ill-treatment by humans and its re-emergence as beer to take its revenge are key themes.

== History ==

=== Possible ancient origins ===

The &quot;Penguin Book of English Folk Songs&quot; (London, 1959), edited by the folk singer A. L. Lloyd and the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, ponders whether the ballad is &quot;an unusually coherent folklore survival&quot; or &quot;the creation of an antiquarian revivalist, which has passed into popular currency and become &#x27;folklorised. It has been theorised that the figure could have some relation to the semi-mythical wicker man ritual, which involves burning a man in effigy.

A link between the mythical figure Beowa (a figure from Anglo-Saxon paganism, appearing in early Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies; his name means &quot;barley&quot;) and John Barleycorn is suggested by the author Kathleen Herbert. In her 1994 book &quot;Looking for the Lost Gods Of England&quot;, she suggests that Beowa and Barleycorn are one and the same, noting that the folksong details the suffering, death, and resurrection of Barleycorn, yet celebrates the &quot;reviving effects of drinking his blood&quot;.

===Written versions===

The first song to personify Barley was called &quot;Allan-a-Maut&quot; (&#x27;Alan of the malt&#x27;), a Scottish song written prior to 1568; 

Allan is also the subject of &quot;Quhy Sowld Nocht Allane Honorit Be&quot;, a fifteenth or sixteenth century Scots poem included in the Bannatyne Manuscript of 1568 and 17th century English broadsides. 

==== &quot;A Pleasant New Ballad&quot; (1624) ====

The first mention of &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; as the character was in a 1624 London broadside entitled introduced as &quot;A Pleasant New Ballad to sing Evening and morn, / Of the Bloody murder of Sir John Barley-corn&quot;&quot;.&quot; The following two verses are from this 1624 version:

The final two verses of this 1624 version show Barleycorn&#x27;s vengeance through intoxicating his killers:

==== Robert Burns (1782) ====

Robert Burns published his own version in 1782, which adds a more mysterious undertone and became the model for most subsequent versions of the ballad. Burns&#x27;s version begins:

Unlike other versions, Robert Burns makes John Barleycorn into a saviour:

=== Field recordings ===
Many field recordings of the song were made of traditional singers performing the song, mostly in England. In 1908, Percy Grainger used phonograph technology to record a Lincolnshire man named William Short singing the song; the recording can be heard on the British Library Sound Archive website. James Madison Carpenter recorded a fragment sung by a Harry Wiltshire of Wheald, Oxfordshire in the 1930s, which is available on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website as well as another version probably performed by a Charles Phelps of Avening, Gloucestershire. The Shropshire singer Fred Jordan was recorded singing a traditional version in the 1960s.

A version recorded in Doolin, Co. Clare, Ireland from a Michael Flanagan in the 1970s is available courtesy of the County Clare Library.

The Scottish singer Duncan Williamson also had a traditional version which was recorded.

Helen Hartness Flanders recorded a version sung by a man named Thomas Armstrong of Mooers Forks, New York, USA in 1935.

==Popular recordings and musical adaptations==
Ralph Vaughan Williams used a version of the song in his English Folk Song Suite (1923).

Many versions of the song have been recorded, including popular versions by the rock groups Traffic (appearing on their 1970 album &quot;John Barleycorn Must Die&quot;) and Jethro Tull (appearing first on their 1992 album &quot;A Little Light Music&quot; and then on various other albums). The song has also been recorded by Fire + Ice, Gae Bolg, Bert Jansch, the John Renbourn Group, Pentangle, Finest Kind, Martin Carthy, Roy Bailey, Martyn Bates in collaboration with Max Eastley, the Watersons, Steeleye Span, Joe Walsh, Fairport Convention, Donnybrook Fair, Oysterband, Frank Black, Quadriga Consort, Maddy Prior, Heather Alexander, Leslie Fish, Tim van Eyken, Barry Dransfield, Of Cabbages and Kings, Winterfylleth (band), John Langstaff, Ayreheart, and many other performers. The song is also a central part of Simon Emmerson&#x27;s &quot;The Imagined Village&quot; project. Martin and Eliza Carthy perform the song alongside Paul Weller on the &quot;Imagined Village&quot; album. Billy Bragg sang in Weller&#x27;s place on live performances. Rock guitarist Joe Walsh performed the song live in 2007 as a tribute to Jim Capaldi. English folk musician Sam Lee recorded a version on his album &quot;Old Wow,&quot; accompanied by a video filmed at Stonehenge. 

Julian Cope&#x27;s album &quot;Drunken Songs&quot; has the following written on its front cover: &quot;John Barleycorn died for somebody&#x27;s sins but not mine.&quot; This is both a reference to John Barleycorn, Patti Smith, and the Traffic album mentioned above.
For his 2017 album, “Sillion”, Johnny Flynn wrote the song “Barleycorn” which heavily references the character John Barleycorn.

In the 2014 album &quot;One and All, Together, For Home&quot;, Winterfylleth interprets the Robert Burns version of the poem.

In Green Lung&#x27;s 2021 single, &quot;Reaper&#x27;s Scythe&quot;, the character is referenced with the line &quot;&#x27;John Barleycorn must die&#x27;&quot;.

== Metaphorical usage and appearances in popular culture ==

&quot;John Barleycorn&quot; has been used as a symbol or a slang term for alcohol, and its association with alcohol has been used in various areas of life. Several pubs in the South of England are called &quot;John Barleycorn&quot;, in locations including Harlow, Southampton and Reading. Jack London&#x27;s 1913 autobiographical novel &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; takes its name from the song and discusses his enjoyment of drinking and struggles with alcoholism. 

The use of the term to symbolise alcohol misuse was so widespread that it was used as a headline on court reports about drunkenness in late Victorian times. 

In the climax of the &quot;Inside No. 9&quot; episode &#x27;Mr King&#x27;, the song is performed by a class of schoolchildren as they prepare to ritualistically sacrifice their teacher for their harvest festival.

<doc id="314865" wikidata="Q5960" url="?curid=314865" title="Premiership Rugby">
<text>Premiership Rugby, officially known as Gallagher Premiership Rugby, or the Gallagher Premiership for sponsorship reasons, is an English professional rugby union competition, consisting of 10 clubs, and is the top division of the English rugby union system.

Premiership clubs qualify for Europe&#x27;s two main club competitions, the European Rugby Champions Cup and the European Rugby Challenge Cup. The winner of the second division, the RFU Championship is promoted to the Premiership and until 2020, the team finishing at the bottom of the Premiership each season was relegated to the Championship. The competition is regarded as one of the three top-level professional leagues in the Northern and Western Hemispheres, along with the Top 14 in France, and the cross-border United Rugby Championship for teams from Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Italy and South Africa.

The competition has been played since 1987, and has evolved into the current Premiership system. The current champions are Northampton Saints who won the league in 2024.

==History==

===Beginnings: English domestic rugby union until 1972===
The governing body of rugby union in England, the Rugby Football Union (RFU), long resisted leagues as it was believed that the introduction of leagues would increase &#x27;dirty&#x27; play and put pressure on clubs to pay their players (thereby contravening the amateur ethos). Instead, clubs arranged their own fixtures and had traditional games. The only organised tournaments were the County Cups and County Championship – the former played by clubs and the latter by County representative teams e.g.1980- 81 Rugby Union County Championship. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and a few local newspapers – such as the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; – compiled &#x27;pennants&#x27; based on teams&#x27; performances, but as the strength of fixture lists varied, it was at best an estimate of a team&#x27;s performance throughout a season.

===1972–1995: Leagues and cups===
In 1972 the RFU sanctioned a national knock-out cup – the RFU Club Competition, the predecessor to the Anglo-Welsh Cup – followed first by regional merit tables and then, in the mid-1980s, by national merit tables. One of the casualties of the move to competitive leagues was the loss of some traditional games as the new fixture lists didn&#x27;t allow time for all of them.

The league system has evolved since its start in 1987 when the Courage Leagues were formed – a league pyramid with roughly 1,000 clubs playing in 108 leagues, each with promotion and relegation.

In the first season, clubs were expected to arrange the fixtures on mutually convenient dates. The clubs involved were Bath, Bristol, Coventry, Gloucester, Harlequins, Leicester, Moseley, Nottingham, Orrell, Sale, Wasps and Waterloo. That first season was an unqualified success, with clubs in the upper echelons of the national leagues reporting increased crowds, interest from both local backers and national companies, and higher skill levels among players exposed to regular competition. The fears that leagues would lead to greater violence on the field proved largely unfounded.

By the next season, the RFU allocated fixed Saturdays to the league season, removing the clubs&#x27; responsibility for scheduling matches. There was no home and away structure to the leagues in those early seasons, as sides played one another only once.

Initially two teams, Bath and Leicester, proved to be head and shoulders above the rest in the Courage League, and between them dominated the top of the table.

In 1994, the league structure expanded to include a full rota of home and away matches for the first time. The 1994–95 season was the first to be shown live on Sky Sports, a relationship which continued until the 2013–14 season when BT Sport acquired the exclusive rights in a deal which is currently scheduled to end after the 2023–24 season.

===1996: The dawn of professional rugby union===
The league turned professional for the 1996–97 season when the first winners were Wasps, joining Bath and Leicester as the only champions in the league&#x27;s first decade. Clubs like Saracens, Newcastle and Northampton were able to attract wealthy benefactors, but the professional era also had its casualties, as clubs like West Hartlepool, Richmond and London Scottish were forced into administration when their backers pulled out.

===2000–2002: Premiership, Championship and playoffs===
The start of the 2000–01 season brought with it a re-vamping of the season structure. In 2000–2001 an 8-team playoff (the Championship) was introduced. However, the team finishing top of the table at the end of the regular season was still considered English champions (&quot;Premiership title&quot;).

Halfway through the 2001–02 season, with Leicester odds-on to win their fourth title in succession, it was controversially decided that the winners of the 8-team playoff would be crowned English champions. There was an outcry from fans and this proposal was dropped.

===2003–2014: The ascendancy of the playoffs===
From the beginning of the 2002–03 season, a new playoff format was introduced to replace the 8-team Championship. The format required the first-placed team in the league to play the winner of a match between the second- and third-placed teams. Critically, the winner of this game (the Premiership Final) would be recognised as English champions. Although Gloucester won the league by a clear margin, they then faced a three-week wait until the final. Having lost their momentum, they were beaten by second-placed Wasps (who had defeated third-placed Northampton) in the play-offs. The playoff structure was reformatted in the 2005–06 season in which the first-placed team would play the fourth placed team in a semi-final (a Shaughnessy playoff).

Since the implementation of the playoff system, only six teams have won both the regular season and playoffs in the same year: Leicester twice in 2000–01 (the first year of the playoffs), 2008–09, 2009–10 and 2021–22 Sale Sharks in 2005–06, Harlequins in 2011–12, Saracens in 2015–16, Exeter in 2019–20, and Northampton Saints in 2023–24

Of all the Premiership teams, Wasps have made a reputation for playing the competition format to perfection, peaking at the right time to be crowned English Champions in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008. Wasps did not lead the league standings at the end of the season in any of these years. Conversely, Gloucester have garnered an unfortunate reputation for leading the table at the end of the regular season, only to fall short of winning the Premiership title, losing finals in 2003, 2007, and 2008. Gloucester&#x27;s single victory in the playoffs, in 2002, occurred when league leaders Leicester were still considered English champions, meaning Gloucester&#x27;s Championship victory was considered secondary.

The 2011–12 season saw Harlequins add their name to the trophy on their first attempt, winning 30–23 against the nine-times champions Leicester. Leicester would have to wait until 2012–13 for their 10th championship, where they defeated Northampton in the final.

The 2013–14 Aviva Premiership season saw Northampton become the 8th different team to win the trophy. This was achieved when they defeated Leicester Tigers in the semi-final 21–20, thus denying Leicester a 10th Consecutive Final. In the final, they defeated Saracens 20–24 with a try in the last minute of extra time to win the 2013–14 Aviva Premiership.

===2014–2018: US initiatives===
With the future of the Heineken Cup uncertain beyond 2013–14, due to a row between England&#x27;s Premiership Rugby Limited and France&#x27;s LNR on one side and the sport&#x27;s governing bodies on the other, Premiership Rugby Limited explored several moves toward expanding its brand into the United States. In May 2013, Premiership Rugby Limited and U.S.-based RugbyLaw entered into a plan by which the two organisations were to help back a proposed U.S. professional league that could have begun play as early as 2014. The first phase of the plan was to involve two preseason exhibitions featuring an &quot;American Barbarians&quot; side that would combine international veterans and young American talent. The &quot;Barbarians&quot; were intended to play matches in August 2013 in the U.S. and London, but those plans fell through, and the matches were indefinitely delayed.

In August 2013, Peter Tom, the chairman of Leicester Tigers, confirmed that discussions had taken place within Premiership Rugby Limited about the possibility of hosting selected Premiership matches in the US. The first match played in the USA was on 12 March 2016 when London Irish were defeated by Saracens at the Red Bull Arena in the New York Metropolitan Area. This match was intended to be the first of a three-year deal which would have seen London Irish play one home match each season in the US, but their relegation from the Premiership at the end of the 2015–16 season scuttled that plan. A new deal was reached with American sports marketing company AEG in 2017 which was intended to see at least one Premiership match taken to the US for four seasons starting in 2017–18. The first match under the new deal was held on 16 September 2017, with Newcastle Falcons taking their home fixture against Saracens to the Talen Energy Stadium in the Philadelphia suburb of Chester, Pennsylvania. In 2018–19, although no match was scheduled to take place in the US, the round 6 match between Saracens and Harlequins was the first broadcast on network television in the US of a Premiership Rugby game. The game was shown live on NBC. In 2019–20, and 2020–21 once again no matches were scheduled to take place in the US.

2018 also saw a revamp of the league&#x27;s secondary competition with the launch of the Premiership Rugby Shield.

===2018–19: CVC Capital Partners investment===
In December 2018, it was announced that the Luxembourg based investment advisory firm CVC Capital Partners had bought a 27% stake in Premiership Rugby in a deal worth £200m. A previous offer to purchase a 51% majority share was rejected. The money from the investment was planned to be used to improve facilities at clubs and grow the game globally.

===2019–20: Salary Cap investigation into Saracens===
In March 2019, allegations emerged that Saracens may have broken the league&#x27;s salary cap. In June, Premiership Rugby announced that they would investigate the allegations. In November 2019, Saracens were found to have been in breach of the salary cap regulations due to failure to disclose player payments in the 2016–17, 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons, which would have taken them over the senior player cap. They were handed a 35-point deduction for the 2019–20 season and fined £5.3 million. The judgement found that Saracens had been reckless in entering into the arrangements with players without disclosing them to Premiership Rugby.

On 18 January 2020, Premiership Rugby announced that Saracens would be relegated to the RFU Championship for the 2020–21 season. Premiership Rugby CEO Darren Childs said this punishment was due to Saracens lack of cooperation in a mid-season audit to prove compliance in the 2019–20 season.

On 23 January 2020, Lord Dyson&#x27;s full report into Saracens&#x27; spending was published, it revealed that Saracens had overspent the salary cap by £1.1m in 2016–17, £98,000 in 2017-18 and £906,000 in 2018–19. These included £923,947.63 of property investments between Nigel Wray and three unnamed Saracens players. It also included Saracens claim that the Salary Cap was unenforceable under competition law, this defence was rejected. On 28 January 2020, Premiership Rugby applied a further 70 point deduction for the 2019–20 season to ensure Saracens would finish bottom of the league table.

=== 2020–Present: COVID19, Clubs going bust and Five Winners in Five Years===
The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted all elite sports in England in spring 2020. The RFU initially suspended both the Premiership and Championship before eventually cancelling the Championship season. Newcastle Falcons, who topped the Championship table at the time of the season&#x27;s premature end were promoted based on their playing record and would replace Saracens in the Premiership the following season.

The 2019–20 Premiership Rugby season recommenced on 14 August and the final was held 24 October 2020.

The disruption of the 2019–20 season meant the 2020–21 season commenced 10 weeks late on 20 November 2020 and ran over a reduced timeframe of 32 weeks (down from 42).

The financial impact of the pandemic also caused the salary cap to be temporarily reduced for a maximum of 3 seasons from the 2021–22 season.

A moratorium on relegation was also approved in February 2021, meaning no teams would be relegated as a potential consequence of another team receiving more points due to games cancelled because of COVID-19. With this news it was also confirmed that the league&#x27;s minimum standards criteria for promotion would be reviewed as would league structure from the 2021–22 season. The new structure extended the moratorium on relegation for a further two-years. A playoff between the top team in the Championship and the bottom team in the Premiership is also introduced in the 2023–24 season.

On 26 September 2022, Worcester Warriors went into administration and were suspended from the league.
Their upcoming fixture against Gloucester on 1 October, was also cancelled.
On 6 October, Worcester Warriors were suspended for the rest of the season, relegated from the premiership, and all past and future fixtures for that season expunged.

On 17 October 2022, Wasps went into administration and were suspended from the league.
Their upcoming fixture against Sale Sharks on 18 October, was also cancelled.
On 28 October, Wasps were suspended for the rest of the season, relegated from the premiership, and all past and future fixtures for that season expunged.

On 6 June 2023, London Irish were suspended from the Premiership after missing a deadline to pay players and staff. Irish subsequently went into administration on 7 June.

Despite ongoing financial concerns the league remained very competitive during these years. Northampton Saints defeated Bath in the 2023–24 final. This meant the league had produced five different winners of the competition in five years stretching back to the 2019-20 season with Exeter Chiefs, Harlequins, Leicester Tigers, Saracens and Northampton Saints all winning the competition.

== Clubs ==
=== Current clubs ===
The Premiership began the 2022–23 season with 13 clubs, but both Wasps and Worcester Warriors were removed from the league, and automatically relegated, after going into administration. Ahead of the 2023–24 season, London Irish also dropped out of the league, as a result of financial insolvency.


* Note: Capacity listed for rugby union games may differ from official stadium capacity

=== All time ===
A total of 28 clubs have been involved in the top-flight since the league&#x27;s inception in the 1987–88 season. The most recent club to make its debut in the Premiership was London Welsh, which made their top flight debut in 2012–13.

Three clubs — Bath, Gloucester and Leicester Tigers — have appeared in every season to date. Harlequins have only missed the 2005–06 season due to relegation. Six other clubs have appeared in at least 20 seasons — Saracens, Northampton Saints, Sale Sharks, London Irish, Bristol Bears and Newcastle Falcons. The financial insolvency, expulsion and automatic relegation of Wasps during the 2022–23 season means their record of being ever-present effectively ended at the end of the 2021–22 season.

Coventry, Liverpool St Helens, Moseley, Nottingham, Rosslyn Park, Rugby and Waterloo only appeared during the amateur era, whereas Exeter Chiefs, Leeds Tykes, London Welsh, Richmond, Rotherham Titans and Worcester Warriors have only appeared during the professional era.

Below, the 2024–25 clubs are listed in bold; ever-present clubs are listed in bold italics. Years listed are the calendar years in which the seasons ended. All current teams will remain in the league until at least 2024.

=== League season ===
The Premiership Rugby league season typically runs from September to June and comprises 18 rounds of matches, with each club playing each other home and away. The results of the matches contribute points to the league as follows: 
* 4 points are awarded for a win
* 2 points are awarded for a draw
* 0 points are awarded for a loss, however
** 1 losing (bonus) point is awarded to a team that loses a match by 7 points or fewer
** 1 additional (bonus) point is awarded to a team scoring 4 tries or more in a match
Since the restart of the 2019–20 season, scheduled fixtures which are cancelled because of a COVID-19 outbreak in one of the competing teams will have their outcome and points allocation decided by a Premiership Rugby panel. As of the start of the 2021–22 season, if the fixture cannot be rescheduled, it is recorded as a 0–0 draw. In this situation, if one team would have been able to fulfil the fixture, they will be awarded 4 points, while the team unable to field a matchday squad due to a COVID-19 outbreak will be given 2 points – otherwise, if both teams are impacted by COVID-19, they will each receive 2 points for the affected fixture.

=== Play-offs ===
Following the completion of the regular season, the top 4 teams enter the play-offs, which are held in June. The top two teams receive home advantage, the league leaders hosting the 4th ranked team, and the 2nd place team hosting the 3rd place team. The winners of these semi-finals progress to the final, held at Twickenham Stadium, with the winner of the final being crowned champions.

=== Promotion and relegation ===
Admittance to the Premiership, which is Level 1 of the men&#x27;s 106-league English rugby union system, is achieved through a system of promotion and relegation between the Premiership and the RFU Championship. Originally this meant a season-winning Championship club was promoted, replacing the lowest placed Premiership club which was relegated (between 2021 and 2023 promotion continued but no Level 1 club has been relegated).

Promotion from the Championship is subject to the Minimum Standards Criteria. If a promotion-winning team does not meet these standards then there is no promotion. In the 2011–12 season London Welsh won promotion from the Championship but were initially denied promotion under the criteria, reprieving Newcastle Falcons from relegation. However London Welsh were found eligible on appeal and Newcastle were relegated.

;Relegation change and new regulations
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a moratorium was approved in February 2021 for a halt on top-flight clubs being relegated from the Premiership beginning that season. As promotion from the Championship would not be stopped, this meant the Premiership would expand to 13 teams in the following year.

The moratorium was extended by an additional two seasons in June 2021. New regulations would also include a moratorium on promotion from the Championship in the same season had the Premiership expanded to 14 teams and introduce a play-off between the bottom placed Premiership Club and top placed Championship club in 2023–24. New minimum standards criteria were announced in September 2022, confirming that promotion from the championship was still due to take place in 2023.

The Premiership could have expanded again to 14 teams from the 2023–23 season but the league returned to 12 teams on 6 October 2022 when Worcester Warriors were expelled from the league for the season after entering administration due to financial problems. Despite trying to find a buyer, the club was wound up in February 2023.
On 17 October 2022, Wasps became the second Premiership club to enter administration that season. The club was also automatically relegated from the Premiership, with their remaining games cancelled and all results expunged. London Irish finished the season but were suspended for the following season during the off season meaning the Premiership contracted to just ten teams from the 2023–24 season.

=== European competition qualification ===
The top seven teams qualify for the following season&#x27;s European Rugby Champions Cup. The eighth champions cup place is awarded to either the winner of the Challenge Cup or the team placed eighth. Teams placed 8 &amp; 9th that do not qualify for the Champions Cup play in the Challenge Cup. The final Challenge Cup place is offered to either the 10th team in the Premiership or the team promoted from the Championship.

== Champions ==
Between 1987 and 2002, the team at the top of the league was crowned English champions. Since 2002–03, the winner of the league has been determined by a Premiership Final, which takes place at Twickenham and consists of two rounds of knock-out play amongst the top four teams.

This change was originally considered controversial, particularly when Wasps won four of the first six play-off finals without ever topping the regular season table, with Sale the only team to both top the table and win the Premiership final in that period.

As of the end of the 2023–24 season, nine table-topping teams have won the Premiership in twenty-two seasons, including four times in the last five seasons. These teams’ names are italicised under the &quot;Top of Table&quot; column below.

In most seasons, at least one team has been relegated at the end of the season, although in 1995–96, there was no relegation to allow division expansion, and in 2001–02, Leeds were given a reprieve because the Division One champions did not have a suitable ground to allow promotion. Relegation was also suspended between 2020–21 and 2022–23 to allow further expansion – although Worcester and Wasps were both relegated for going into administration during the 2022–23 season, as was London Irish ahead of the 2023–24 season.

== Finance and governance aspects==

===Men’s Professional Game Partnership===
In 2024 the RFU, Premiership Rugby and the RPA agreed an 8-year Men&#x27;s Professional Game Partnership (MPGP).

===Salary cap ===
The English Premiership operates a salary cap, set by the Premiership Rugby Board, specifying the money a club can spend on the player salaries of its squad per season. Until the 2024–25 season, the base cap is £5 million, with an &quot;academy credit&quot; of up to £600,000 (£100,000 per player for up to six players).

A club may use the academy credit on a player that: (i) joined the club before his 18th birthday; (ii) is under age 24 at the start of the season; and (iii) earns a salary of more than £50,000. Under the credit scheme, the first £100,000 of a qualifying player&#x27;s salary is not counted against the cap.

==== Exclusions ====
Since the 2022–23 season, each club has been allowed to exclude one player from the cap calculations, a decrease from two in prior seasons. An exception is made for any team which had two excluded players currently under contract. Both players remain excluded until the first of their contracts expire.

The &quot;excluded player&quot; slot can be filled by any player on a team&#x27;s current roster who meets any of the following criteria:
* Played with his Premiership club for at least two full seasons before he was nominated as an excluded player.
* Played with his Premiership club for the full season before being nominated as an excluded player, after having played outside the Premiership.
* Played outside the Premiership in the season before he was nominated.
===P shares===
P shares were awarded in 2005 to the 13 clubs then in the Premiership. They are believed to entitle shareholders to a percentage of the central income of Premiership Rugby and voting rights on key issues.

== Media coverage ==
In the United Kingdom, Premiership Rugby is broadcast on TNT Sports (previously BT Sport) and streaming on Discovery+, under a contract most recently renewed in March 2024. The broadcaster carries all Premiership Rugby fixtures (an increase from 80 to 93 regular season fixtures), as well as selected Premiership Rugby Cup fixtures.

ITV holds rights to carry a free-to-air highlights show, aired on ITV4 and ITV1. For the 2024–25 season, the highlight show—previously hosted by Craig Doyle and a panel of players—was rebooted as &quot;Gallagher Premiership Unleashed&quot;; in addition to highlights, the new format includes feature segments hosted by popular rugby-oriented social media personalities. Doyle—who produces the programme—stated that the programme was intended to help reach a wider audience, amid a collapse in viewership for the more traditional format.

<text>The Roches were an American vocal trio of sisters Maggie, Terre and Suzzy Roche, from Park Ridge, New Jersey.

==Career==
In the late 1960s, eldest sister Maggie (October 26, 1951 – January 21, 2017) and middle sister Terre (pronounced &quot;Terry&quot;, born April 10, 1953) attended Park Ridge High School, but dropped out of school to tour as a duo. Maggie wrote most of the songs, with Terre contributing to a few. The sisters got a break when Paul Simon brought them in as backup singers on his 1973 album &quot;There Goes Rhymin&#x27; Simon&quot;. They got his assistance (along with an appearance by the Oak Ridge Boys) on their only album as a duo, &quot;Seductive Reasoning&quot; (1975).

Reviewing &quot;Seductive Reasoning&quot; in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau said, &quot;Female singing duos must function as mutual support groups; last time a women&#x27;s sensibility this assured, relaxed, and reflective made it to vinyl was Joy of Cooking. These folkies manque are a little flat here, a little arch there, but in general the shoe fits; no ideological feminism, but plenty of consciousness.&quot;

Later in the 1970s youngest sister Suzzy (rhymes with &quot;fuzzy&quot;, born September 29, 1956) joined the group to form the Roches trio.

Around this time, they parlayed bartending jobs at the Greenwich Village folk venue Gerde&#x27;s Folk City into stage appearances, an experience they commemorated in their song &quot;Face Down at Folk City&quot; (from &quot;Another World&quot;, 1985). There they met many of their future singing and songwriting collaborators. Terre was now writing songs as well, and by the time of their first album as a trio, &quot;The Roches&quot; (1979), Suzzy had also begun writing. Robert Fripp produced the album. Maggie&#x27;s &quot;The Married Men&quot; from this album was eventually to become the songwriting trio&#x27;s biggest hit—not for them, but for Phoebe Snow. After Snow and Linda Ronstadt performed the song in a duet on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, the Roches were invited to perform on the show a few months later in 1979 at Simon&#x27;s behest. They did two songs, both unreleased at the time: &quot;Bobby&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;The Hallelujah Chorus&quot;.

Throughout the 1980s, the Roches continued to release their music to small audiences, little or no air play, and only modest record sales. In February 1981 the BBC broadcast a 40-minute performance in its series &quot;Rock Goes to College&quot;. A 1983 episode of the PBS concert series &quot;Soundstage&quot; was devoted to an hourlong performance by the trio, and they appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in November 1985, performing their song &quot;Mr. Sellack&quot;. In 1990, they returned to their Christmas-caroling roots with the release of the 24-track &quot;We Three Kings&quot;, which included the &quot;a cappella&quot; &quot;Star of Wonder&quot;, written by Terre. After another pop album (&quot;A Dove&quot;, 1992), they recorded an entire album of children&#x27;s songs, &quot;Will You Be My Friend?&quot;, featuring a song by brother David and various young backup singers, including Suzzy&#x27;s daughter Lucy Wainwright Roche.

After a tour interrupted by the death of their father, the Roches released &quot;Can We Go Home Now&quot; (1995), the last original recording they released as a trio until 2007.

In 1997, the sisters formally put their group on long-term hold. They continued to work on solo projects and often collaborated on albums and performances. Terre teaches guitar workshops and has released a solo album. Suzzy, who has acted on the stage and in several movies, released two of her own albums and two with Maggie, with whom she toured. All three sisters periodically participated in New York-area events. At the end of 2005, the three Roches (with brother Dave) reunited for a short but successful holiday tour. Several more appearances in the U.S. and Canada took place in 2006–07, and in March 2007, after a 12-year hiatus, the Roches released a new studio album, &quot;Moonswept&quot;. After the tour for &quot;Moonswept&quot;, the Roches announced that they would no longer be touring, but they continued to make isolated appearances individually and as a group, mostly in and around New York City.

On January 21, 2017, Maggie Roche died from breast cancer at the age of 65. In a statement on Facebook, Suzzy wrote that Maggie &quot;was a private person, too sensitive and shy for this world, but brimming with life, love, and talent. She was smart, wickedly funny, and authentic — not a false bone in her body — a brilliant songwriter, with a distinct unique perspective, all heart and soul.&quot; She was survived by her partner Michael McCarthy and son Edward &quot;Felix&quot; McTeigue.

== Family ==
Maggie Roche had an &quot;unusual&quot; contralto voice—&quot;almost a baritone&quot;. Terre provided a soprano that bracketed the upper range of the sisters, while Suzzy filled in the middle range. While touring, the sisters accompanied themselves with guitars and keyboards, occasionally with additional musicians.

Terre Roche continues to perform publicly in New York City, and since 2016 she has led a &quot;Sunset Singing Circle&quot; at Battery Park in Manhattan under the auspices of the Parks Department.

Brother David is also a singer-songwriter with his own solo album, and often backed up the trio on their recordings. Maggie&#x27;s son, Felix McTeigue, has recorded three albums (one with his group Filo). Suzzy&#x27;s daughter, Lucy Wainwright Roche, has also contributed vocals on the Roches&#x27; and McTeigue&#x27;s albums, and in 2007 produced an EP of her own, &quot;8 Songs&quot;, followed by &quot;8 More&quot; in 2008 and tours opening for acts such as Amos Lee and the Indigo Girls. Lucy has released three full-length albums: &quot;Lucy&quot; (2010), &quot;There&#x27;s a Last Time for Everything&quot; (2013), and &quot;Little Beast&quot; (2018). Her father is Loudon Wainwright III, and she is the half-sister of singers Martha and Rufus Wainwright.

<text>The International Style is a major architectural style and movement that began in western Europe in the 1920s and dominated modern architecture until the 1970s. It is defined by strict adherence to functional and utilitarian designs and construction methods, typically expressed through minimalism. The style is characterized by modular and rectilinear forms, flat surfaces devoid of ornamentation and decoration, open and airy interiors that blend with the exterior, and the use of glass, steel, and concrete.

The International Style is sometimes called rationalist architecture and the modern movement, although the former is mostly used in English to refer specifically to either Italian rationalism or the style that developed in 1920s Europe more broadly. In continental Europe, this and related styles are variably called Functionalism, &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot; (&quot;New Objectivity&quot;), &quot;De Stijl&quot; (&quot;The Style&quot;), and Rationalism, all of which are contemporaneous movements and styles that share similar principles, origins, and proponents. 

Rooted in the modernism movement, the International Style is closely related to &quot;Modern architecture&quot; and likewise reflects several intersecting developments in culture, politics, and technology in the early 20th century. After being brought to the United States by European architects in the 1930s, it quickly became an &quot;unofficial&quot; North American style, particularly after World War II. The International Style reached its height in the 1950s and 1960s, when it was widely adopted worldwide for its practicality and as a symbol of industry, progress, and modernity. The style remained the prevailing design philosophy for urban development and reconstruction into the 1970s, especially in the Western world.

The International Style was one of the first architectural movements to receive critical renown and global popularity. Regarded as the high point of modernist architecture, it is sometimes described as the &quot;architecture of the modern movement&quot; and credited with &quot;single-handedly transforming the skylines of every major city in the world with its simple cubic forms&quot;. The International Style&#x27;s emphasis on transcending historical and cultural influences, while favoring utility and mass-production methods, made it uniquely versatile in its application; the style was ubiquitous in a wide range of purposes, ranging from social housing and governmental buildings to corporate parks and skyscrapers. 

Nevertheless, these same qualities provoked negative reactions against the style as monotonous, austere, and incongruent with existing landscapes; these critiques are conveyed through various movements such as postmodernism, new classical architecture, and deconstructivism.

Postmodern architecture was developed in the 1960s in reaction to the International Style, becoming dominant in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Concept and definition==
The term &quot;International Style&quot; was first used in 1932 by the historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock and architect Philip Johnson to describe a movement among European architects in the 1920s that was distinguished by three key design principles: (1) &quot;Architecture as volume – thin planes or surfaces create the building’s form, as opposed to a solid mass&quot;; (2) &quot;Regularity in the facade, as opposed to building symmetry&quot;; and (3) &quot;No applied ornament&quot;. 

International style is an ambiguous term; the unity and integrity of this direction is deceptive. Its formal features were revealed differently in different countries. Despite the unconditional commonality, the international style has never been a single phenomenon. However, International Style architecture demonstrates a unity of approach and general principles: lightweight structures, skeletal frames, new materials, a modular system, an open plan, and the use of simple geometric shapes.

The problem of the International Style is that it is not obvious what type of material the term should be applied to: at the same time, there are key monuments of the 20th century (Le Corbusier&#x27;s Villa Savoye; Wright&#x27;s Fallingwater House) and mass-produced architectural products of their time. Here it is appropriate to talk about the use of recognizable formal techniques and the creation of a standard architectural product, rather than iconic objects.

Hitchcock and Johnson&#x27;s 1932 MoMA exhibition catalog identified three principles of the style: volume of internal space (as opposed to mass and solidity), flexibility and regularity (liberation from classical symmetry). and the expulsion of applied ornamentation (&#x27;artificial accents&#x27;).

Common characteristics of the International Style include: a radical simplification of form, a rejection of superfluous ornamentation, bold repetition and embracement of sleek glass, steel and efficient concrete as preferred materials. Accents were found to be suitably derived from natural design irregularities, such as the position of doors and fire escapes, stair towers, ventilators and even electric signs.

Further, the transparency of buildings, construction (called the honest expression of structure), and acceptance of industrialized mass-production techniques contributed to the international style&#x27;s design philosophy. Finally, the machine aesthetic, and logical design decisions leading to support building function were used by the International architect to create buildings reaching beyond historicism. The ideals of the style are commonly summed up in three slogans: ornament is a crime, truth to materials, form follows function; and Le Corbusier&#x27;s description: &quot;A house is a machine to live in&quot;.

International style is sometimes understood as a general term associated with such architectural phenomena as Brutalist architecture, constructivism, functionalism, and rationalism.

Phenomena similar in nature also existed in other artistic fields, for example in graphics, such as the International Typographic Style and Swiss Style.

The Getty Research Institute defines it as &quot;the style of architecture that emerged in The Netherlands, France, and Germany after World War I and spread throughout the world, becoming the dominant architectural style until the 1970s. The style is characterized by an emphasis on volume over mass, the use of lightweight, mass-produced, industrial materials, rejection of all ornament and colour, repetitive modular forms, and the use of flat surfaces, typically alternating with areas of glass.&quot; Some researchers consider the International Style as one of the attempts to create an ideal and utilitarian form.

==Background==
Around the start of the 20th century, a number of architects around the world began developing new architectural solutions to integrate traditional precedents with new social demands and technological possibilities. The work of Victor Horta and Henry van de Velde in Brussels, Antoni Gaudí in Barcelona, Otto Wagner in Vienna and Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Glasgow, among many others, can be seen as a common struggle between old and new. These architects were not considered part of the International Style because they practiced in an &quot;individualistic manner&quot; and seen as the last representatives of Romanticism.

The International Style can be traced to buildings designed by a small group of modernists, the major figures of which include Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobus Oud, Le Corbusier, Richard Neutra and Philip Johnson.

The founder of the Bauhaus school, Walter Gropius, along with prominent Bauhaus instructor, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, became known for steel frame structures employing glass curtain walls.  One of the world&#x27;s earliest modern buildings where this can be seen is a shoe factory designed by Gropius in 1911 in Alfeld, Germany, called the Fagus Works building. The first building built entirely on Bauhaus design principles was the concrete and steel Haus am Horn, built in 1923 in Weimar, Germany, designed by Georg Muche. The Gropius-designed Bauhaus school building in Dessau, built 1925–26 and the Harvard Graduate Center (Cambridge, Massachusetts; 1949–50) also known as the Gropius Complex, exhibit clean lines and a &quot;concern for uncluttered interior spaces&quot;.

Marcel Breuer, a recognized leader in Béton Brut (Brutalist) architecture and notable alumnus of the Bauhaus, who also pioneered the use of plywood and tubular steel in furniture design, and who after leaving the Bauhaus would later teach alongside Gropius at Harvard, is as well an important contributor to Modernism and the International Style.

Prior to use of the term &#x27;International Style&#x27;, some American architects—such as Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Irving Gill—exemplified qualities of simplification, honesty and clarity.
Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Wasmuth Portfolio had been exhibited in Europe and influenced the work of European modernists, and his travels there probably influenced his own work, although he refused to be categorized with them. His buildings of the 1920s and 1930s clearly showed a change in the style of the architect, but in a different direction than the International Style.

In Europe the modern movement in architecture had been called Functionalism or Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity), &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau&quot;, or simply Modernism and was very much concerned with the coming together of a new architectural form and social reform, creating a more open and transparent society.
The &quot;International Style&quot;, as defined by Hitchcock and Johnson, had developed in 1920s Western Europe, shaped by the activities of the Dutch De Stijl movement, Le Corbusier, and the Deutscher Werkbund and the Bauhaus. Le Corbusier had embraced Taylorist and Fordist strategies adopted from American industrial models in order to reorganize society. He contributed to a new journal called &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau&quot; that advocated the use of modern industrial techniques and strategies to create a higher standard of living on all socio-economic levels. In 1927, one of the first and most defining manifestations of the International Style was the Weissenhof Estate in Stuttgart, overseen by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. It was enormously popular, with thousands of daily visitors.

==1932 MoMA exhibition==
The exhibition &quot;Modern Architecture: International Exhibition&quot; ran from February 9 to March 23, 1932, at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), in the Heckscher Building at Fifth Avenue and 56th Street in New York. Beyond a foyer and office, the exhibition was divided into six rooms: the &quot;Modern Architects&quot; section began in the entrance room, featuring a model of William Lescaze&#x27;s Chrystie-Forsyth Street Housing Development in New York. From there visitors moved to the centrally placed Room A, featuring a model of a mid-rise housing development for Evanston, Illinois, by Chicago architect brothers Monroe Bengt Bowman and Irving Bowman, as well as a model and photos of Walter Gropius&#x27;s Bauhaus building in Dessau. In the largest exhibition space, Room C, were works by Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, J. J. P. Oud and Frank Lloyd Wright (including a project for a house on the Mesa in Denver, 1932). Room B was a section titled &quot;Housing&quot;, presenting &quot;the need for a new domestic environment&quot; as it had been identified by historian and critic Lewis Mumford. In Room D were works by Raymond Hood (including &quot;Apartment Tower in the Country&quot; and the McGraw-Hill Building) and Richard Neutra. In Room E was a section titled &quot;The extent of modern architecture&quot;, added at the last minute, which included the works of thirty-seven modern architects from fifteen countries who were said to be influenced by the works of Europeans of the 1920s. Among these works was shown Alvar Aalto&#x27;s Turun Sanomat newspaper offices building in Turku, Finland.

After a six-week run in New York City, the exhibition then toured the US – the first such &quot;traveling-exhibition&quot; of architecture in the US – for six years.

===Curators===
MoMA director Alfred H. Barr hired architectural historian and critic Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson to curate the museum&#x27;s first architectural exhibition. The three of them toured Europe together in 1929 and had also discussed Hitchcock&#x27;s book about modern art. By December 1930, the first written proposal for an exhibition of the &quot;new architecture&quot; was set down, yet the first draft of the book was not complete until some months later.

===Publications===
The 1932 exhibition led to two publications by Hitchcock and Johnson:
* The exhibition catalog, &quot;Modern Architecture: International Exhibition&quot;
* The book, &quot;The International Style: Architecture Since 1922&quot;, published by W. W. Norton &amp; Co. in 1932.
**reprinted in 1997 by W. W. Norton &amp; Company

Previous to the 1932 exhibition and book, Hitchcock had concerned himself with the themes of modern architecture in his 1929 book &quot;Modern Architecture: Romanticism and Reintegration&quot;.

According to Terence Riley: &quot;Ironically the (exhibition) catalogue, and to some extent, the book &quot;The International Style&quot;, published at the same time of the exhibition, have supplanted the actual historical event.&quot;

=== Exemplary Uses of the International Style ===
The following architects and buildings were selected by Hitchcock and Johnson for display at the exhibition &quot;Modern Architecture: International Exhibition&quot;:

===Notable omissions===
The exhibition excluded other contemporary styles that were exploring the boundaries of architecture at the time, including: Art Deco; German Expressionism, for instance the works of Hermann Finsterlin; and the organicist movement, popularized in the work of Antoni Gaudí. As a result of the 1932 exhibition, the principles of the International Style were endorsed, while other styles were classed less significant.

In 1922, the competition for the Tribune Tower and its famous second-place entry by Eliel Saarinen gave some indication of what was to come, though these works would not have been accepted by Hitchcock and Johnson as representing the &quot;International Style&quot;. Similarly, Johnson, writing about Joseph Urban&#x27;s recently completed New School for Social Research in New York, stated: &quot;In the New School we have an anomaly of a building supposed to be in a style of architecture based on the development of the plan from function and facade from plan but which is a formally and pretentiously conceived as a Renaissance palace. Urban&#x27;s admiration for the New Style is more complete than his understanding.&quot;

California architect Rudolph Schindler&#x27;s work was not a part of the exhibit, though Schindler had pleaded with Hitchcock and Johnson to be included. Then, &quot;[f]or more than 20 years, Schindler had intermittently launched a series of spirited, cantankerous exchanges with the museum.&quot;

==Before 1932==
==1932–1944==
The gradual rise of the Nazi regime in Weimar Germany in the 1930s, and the Nazis&#x27; rejection of modern architecture, meant that an entire generation of avant-gardist architects, many of them Jews, were forced out of continental Europe. Some, such as Mendelsohn, found shelter in England, while a considerable number of the Jewish architects made their way to Palestine, and others to the US. However, American anti-Communist politics after the war and Philip Johnson&#x27;s influential rejection of functionalism have tended to mask the fact that many of the important architects, including contributors to the original Weissenhof project, fled to the Soviet Union. This group also tended to be far more concerned with functionalism and its social agenda. Bruno Taut, Mart Stam, the second Bauhaus director Hannes Meyer, Ernst May and other important figures of the International Style went to the Soviet Union in 1930 to undertake huge, ambitious, idealistic urban planning projects, building entire cities from scratch. In 1936, when Stalin ordered them out of the country, many of these architects became stateless and sought refuge elsewhere; for example, Ernst May moved to Kenya.

The White City of Tel Aviv is a collection of over 4,000 buildings built in the International Style in the 1930s. Many Jewish architects who had studied at the German Bauhaus school designed significant buildings here. A large proportion of the buildings built in the International Style can be found in the area planned by Patrick Geddes, north of Tel Aviv&#x27;s main historical commercial center. In 1994, UNESCO proclaimed the White City a World Heritage Site, describing the city as &quot;a synthesis of outstanding significance of the various trends of the Modern Movement in architecture and town planning in the early part of the 20th century&quot;. In 1996, Tel Aviv&#x27;s White City was listed as a World Monuments Fund endangered site.

The residential area of Södra Ängby in western Stockholm, Sweden, blended an international or functionalist style with garden city ideals. Encompassing more than 500 buildings, most of them designed by Edvin Engström, it remains the largest coherent functionalist or &quot;International Style&quot; villa area in Sweden and possibly the world, still well-preserved more than a half-century after its construction in 1933–40 and protected as a national cultural heritage.

Zlín is a city in the Czech Republic which was in the 1930s completely reconstructed on principles of functionalism. In that time the city was a headquarters of Bata Shoes company and Tomáš Baťa initiated a complex reconstruction of the city which was inspired by functionalism and the Garden city movement. Tomas Bata Memorial is the most valuable monument of the Zlín functionalism. It is a modern paraphrase of the constructions of high gothic style period: the supporting system and colourful stained glass and the reinforced concrete skeleton and glass.

With the rise of Nazism, a number of key European modern architects fled to the US. When Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer fled Germany they both arrived at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, in an excellent position to extend their influence and promote the Bauhaus as the primary source of architectural modernism. When Mies fled in 1938, he first fled to England, but on emigrating to the US he went to Chicago, founded the Second School of Chicago at IIT and solidified his reputation as a prototypical modern architect.

==1945–present==

After World War II, the International Style matured; Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum (later renamed HOK) and Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM) perfected the corporate practice, and it became the dominant approach for decades in the US and Canada. Beginning with the initial technical and formal inventions of 860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments in Chicago, its most famous examples include the United Nations headquarters, the Lever House, the Seagram Building in New York City, and the campus of the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, as well as the Toronto-Dominion Centre in Toronto. Further examples can be found in mid-century institutional buildings throughout North America and the &quot;corporate architecture&quot; spread from there, especially to Europe.

In Canada, this period coincided with a major building boom and few restrictions on massive building projects. International Style skyscrapers came to dominate many of Canada&#x27;s major cities, especially Ottawa, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Hamilton, and Toronto. While these glass boxes were at first unique and interesting, the idea was soon repeated to the point of ubiquity. A typical example is the development of so-called Place de Ville, a conglomeration of three glass skyscrapers in downtown Ottawa, where the plans of the property developer Robert Campeau in the mid-1960s and early 1970s—in the words of historian Robert W. Collier, were &quot;forceful and abrasive[;] he was not well-loved at City Hall&quot;—had no regard for existing city plans, and &quot;built with contempt for the existing city and for city responsibilities in the key areas of transportation and land use&quot;. Architects attempted to put new twists into such towers, such as the Toronto City Hall by Finnish architect Viljo Revell. By the late 1970s a backlash was under way against modernism—prominent anti-modernists such as Jane Jacobs and George Baird were partly based in Toronto.

The typical International Style or &quot;corporate architecture&quot; high-rise usually consists of the following:
# Square or rectangular footprint
# Simple cubic &quot;extruded rectangle&quot; form
# Windows running in broken horizontal rows forming a grid
# All facade angles are 90 degrees.

In 2000 UNESCO proclaimed University City of Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela, as a World Heritage Site, describing it as &quot;a masterpiece of modern city planning, architecture and art, created by the Venezuelan architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva and a group of distinguished avant-garde artists&quot;.

In June 2007 UNESCO proclaimed Ciudad Universitaria of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), in Mexico City, a World Heritage Site due to its relevance and contribution in terms of international style movement. It was designed in the late 1940s and built in the mid-1950s based upon a masterplan created by architect Enrique del Moral. His original idea was enriched by other students, teachers, and diverse professionals of several disciplines. The university houses murals by Diego Rivera, Juan O&#x27;Gorman and others. The university also features Olympic Stadium (1968). In his first years of practice, Pritzker Prize winner and Mexican architect Luis Barragán designed buildings in the International Style. But later he evolved to a more traditional local architecture. Other notable Mexican architects of the International Style or modern period are Carlos Obregón Santacilia, Augusto H. Alvarez, Mario Pani, , Vladimir Kaspé, Enrique del Moral, Juan Sordo Madaleno, Max Cetto, among many others.

In Brazil Oscar Niemeyer proposed a more organic and sensual International Style. He designed the political landmarks (headquarters of the three state powers) of the new, planned capital Brasília. The masterplan for the city was proposed by Lúcio Costa.

==Criticism==
In 1930, Frank Lloyd Wright wrote: &quot;Human houses should not be like boxes, blazing in the sun, nor should we outrage the Machine by trying to make dwelling-places too complementary to Machinery.&quot;

In Elizabeth Gordon&#x27;s well-known 1953 essay, &quot;The Threat to the Next America&quot;, she criticized the style as non-practical, citing many instances where &quot;glass houses&quot; are too hot in summer and too cold in winter, empty, take away private space, lack beauty and generally are not livable. Moreover, she accused this style&#x27;s proponents of taking away a sense of beauty from people and thus covertly pushing for a totalitarian society.

In 1966, architect Robert Venturi published &quot;Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture&quot;, essentially a book-length critique of the International Style. Architectural historian Vincent Scully regarded Venturi&#x27;s book as &#x27;probably the most important writing on the making of architecture since Le Corbusier&#x27;s &quot;Vers une Architecture&quot;. It helped to define postmodernism.

Best-selling American author Tom Wolfe wrote a book-length critique, &quot;From Bauhaus to Our House&quot;, portraying the style as elitist.

One of the supposed strengths of the International Style has been said to be that the design solutions were indifferent to location, site, and climate; the solutions were supposed to be universally applicable; the style made no reference to local history or national vernacular. This was soon identified as one of the style&#x27;s primary weaknesses.

In 2006, Hugh Pearman, the British architectural critic of &quot;The Times&quot;, observed that those using the style today are simply &quot;another species of revivalist&quot;, noting the irony. The negative reaction to internationalist modernism has been linked to public antipathy to overall development.

In the preface to the fourth edition of his book &quot;Modern Architecture: A Critical History&quot; (2007), Kenneth Frampton argued that there had been a &quot;disturbing Eurocentric bias&quot; in histories of modern architecture. This &quot;Eurocentrism&quot; included the US.

<text>Patrick Cox (born 28 November 1952) is an Irish former Fine Gael politician, journalist and television current affairs presenter who served as President of the European Parliament from 2002 to 2004 and Leader of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party Group from 1998 to 2002. He served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Munster constituency from 1989 to 2004 and a Teachta Dála (TD) for Cork South-Central from 1992 to 1994.

Cox was a presenter with RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Today Tonight&quot;.

==Early and personal life==
Cox was born in Dublin in 1952, but raised in Limerick. He was then educated at Ardscoil Rís in Limerick, the University of Limerick and Trinity College Dublin. He is married to Cathy, and lived at Ashboro, Shanakiel in the Cork north side suburb of Sunday&#x27;s Well for 16 years.

==Early career==
Cox first came to prominence as a journalist, then a presenter with RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Today Tonight&quot;, a four-nights-a-week current affairs programme which dominated the Irish television schedules in the 1980s. He left the programme to become a political candidate.

==Political career==
===Career in national politics===
Cox stood as a Fianna Fáil candidate at the 1979 local elections.

===Member of the European Parliament, 1989–2004===
Cox was elected an MEP in 1989 for the constituency of Munster, representing the Progressive Democrats (PDs). During his first term, he served on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy.

At the 1992 general election, Cox was also elected to Dáil Éireann as a TD for Cork South-Central. Following Desmond O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s retirement from the party leadership in 1993, Cox stood for election to the post but was beaten by Mary Harney. He became deputy leader.

Cox left the PDs in May 1994 in a dispute over his seat as an MEP. It was expected that Cox would not contest his seat in the 1994 European election; Des O&#x27;Malley, who had a large Munster base in Limerick city and County Limerick, was selected as the party candidate. However, Cox then decided to contest the seat as an independent, beating O&#x27;Malley. On being elected, he resigned his Dáil seat and a by-election was held on 10 November 1994, which was won by Fine Gael. He subsequently served on the Committee on Institutional Affairs from 1994 until 1997 and on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy from 1997 until 1999. In addition to his committee assignments, he was a member of the Parliament&#x27;s delegation for relations with South Africa.

When incumbent Gijs de Vries stepped down to enter the government of Prime Minister Wim Kok of the Netherlands, Cox was elected president of the ELDR group in the European Parliament in 1998, becoming the first Irishman to lead a political group in the Parliament. He subsequently played a key role in the fall of the Santer Commission by consistently – and loudly – calling for the Commissioners to resign.

Cox was unanimously re-elected Group President in June 1999, following his re-election as an MEP at the 1999 European Parliament election. He resigned this post when he became President of the European Parliament on 15 January 2002, in accordance with an agreement between the European People&#x27;s Party (Christian Democrats) and the ELDR groups at the start of the term (in the customary two-way split of the five-year Presidency of the European Parliament). He succeeded the Frenchwoman Nicole Fontaine. At his first press conference following his election as president he spoke positively of direct talks between the Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot President Rauf Denktaş.

In July 2003, Cox took a personal telephone apology from Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, after Berlusconi managed to offend several MEPs. The controversy arose after Berlusconi compared a German MEP to a Nazi concentration camp commandant.

Cox did not contest the 2004 elections to the European parliament. The Christian Democrats (European People&#x27;s Party – EPP) and Socialist Groups agreed at the customary two-way split of the Presidency of the European Parliament. Josep Borrell Fontelles, a Spanish Socialist, assumed the Presidency on 20 July 2004, holding it until 15 January 2007.

==Later career==
Cox is a member of the Comite d&#x27;Honneur of the Institute of European Affairs. In 2006, he was elected President of European Movement, an international pro-European lobby association. In June 2009, Pat Cox temporarily stepped down as president and took over the position of the campaign director for the pro-Lisbon treaty initiative Ireland for Europe. He resigned as president of European Movement in May 2013.

Also in 2009, Cox co-founded the European Privacy Association.

On 15 September 2010, Cox supported the new initiative Spinelli Group, which was founded to reinvigorate the drive toward federalisation of the European Union (EU). Other prominent supporters include Jacques Delors, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Guy Verhofstadt, Andrew Duff and Elmar Brok.

In June 2011 Irish media reported that Cox, who had previously said he wanted to stand as an independent candidate in 2011&#x27;s Irish presidential election, was seeking to join Fine Gael to get the party&#x27;s nomination. Fine Gael&#x27;s national executive on 16 June 2011 approved his application to join the party&#x27;s St Luke&#x27;s branch in Cork. In July 2011, Gay Mitchell became the Fine Gael candidate. Before that, Cox was &quot;pleased&quot; to help prepare Fine Gael&#x27;s first-100-day strategy after it won the 2011 general election.

Between 2012 and 2014, Cox and Aleksander Kwaśniewski led a European Parliament monitoring mission in Ukraine to monitor the criminal cases against Yulia Tymoshenko, Yuriy Lutsenko and Valeriy Ivaschenko.

<doc id="314899" wikidata="Q1421756" url="?curid=314899" title="Hard currency">
<text>In macroeconomics, hard currency, safe-haven currency, or strong currency is any globally traded currency that serves as a reliable and stable store of value. Factors contributing to a currency&#x27;s &quot;hard&quot; status might include the stability and reliability of the respective state&#x27;s legal and bureaucratic institutions, level of corruption, long-term stability of its purchasing power, the associated country&#x27;s political and fiscal condition and outlook, and the policy posture of the issuing central bank.

Safe haven currency is defined as a currency which behaves like a hedge for a reference portfolio of risky assets conditional on movements in global risk aversion. Conversely, a weak or soft currency is one which is expected to fluctuate erratically or depreciate against other currencies. Softness is typically the result of weak legal institutions and/or political or fiscal instability. Junk currency is even less trusted than soft currency, and has a very low currency value. Soft and junk currencies often suffer sharp falls in value.

== History ==
The paper currencies of some developed countries have earned recognition as hard currencies at various times, including the United States dollar, euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and to a lesser extent the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Swedish krona, Singapore dollar, and Hong Kong dollar. As times change, a currency that is considered weak at one time may become stronger, or vice versa; the Japanese yen is a recent example.

One measure of hard currencies is how they are favored within the foreign-exchange reserves of countries:

== Turmoil ==
The US dollar (USD) has been considered a strong currency for much of its history. Despite the Nixon shock of 1971, and the United States&#x27; growing fiscal and trade deficits, most of the world&#x27;s monetary systems have been tied to the US dollar due to the Bretton Woods system and dollarization. Countries have consequently been compelled to purchase dollars for their foreign exchange reserves, price their commodities in dollars for foreign trade, or even use dollars domestically, thus buoying the currency&#x27;s value.

The euro (EUR) has also been considered a hard currency for much of its short history. However, the European sovereign debt crisis has partially eroded that confidence.

The Swiss franc (CHF) has long been considered a hard currency, and in fact was the last paper currency in the world to terminate its convertibility to gold on 1 May 2000, following a referendum. In the summer of 2011, the European sovereign debt crisis led to rapid flows out of the euro and into the Swiss franc by those seeking hard currency, causing it to appreciate rapidly. On 6 September 2011, the Swiss National Bank announced that it would buy an &quot;unlimited&quot; number of euros to fix an exchange rate at 1.00 EUR = 1.20 CHF to protect its trade. This action temporarily eliminated the Swiss franc&#x27;s hard currency advantage over the euro, but was abandoned in January 2015.

The Japanese yen used to be a hard currency, but it is now regarded as a junk currency due to its sharp decline in value since 2022. For this reason, many exchange offices do not handle the Japanese yen. The impact of this junk currencyisation has also led to a series of moves by even Japanese companies to cease trading in Japanese yen.

== Demand ==
Investors as well as ordinary people generally prefer hard currencies to soft currencies at times of increased inflation (or, more precisely, times of increased inflation differentials between countries), at times of heightened political or military risk, or when they feel that one or more government-imposed exchange rates are unrealistic. There may be regulatory reasons for preferring to invest outside one&#x27;s home currency, e.g. the local currency may be subject to capital controls which makes it difficult to spend it outside the host nation.

For example, during the Cold War, the ruble in the Soviet Union was not a hard currency because it could not be easily spent outside the Soviet Union and because the exchange rates were fixed at artificially high levels for persons with hard currency, such as Western tourists. (The Soviet government also imposed severe limits on how many rubles could be exchanged by Soviet citizens for hard currencies.) After the fall of the Soviet Union in December 1991, the ruble depreciated rapidly, while the purchasing power of the US dollar was more stable, making it a harder currency than the ruble. A tourist could get 200 rubles per US dollar in June 1992, and 500 ruble per dollar in November 1992.

In some economies, which may be either planned economies or market economies using a soft currency, there are special stores that accept only hard currency. Examples have included Tuzex stores in the former Czechoslovakia, Intershops in East Germany, Pewex in Poland, or Friendship stores in China in the early 1990s. These stores offer a wider variety of goods many of which are scarce or imported than standard stores.

== Mixed currencies ==
Because hard currencies may be subject to legal restrictions, the desire for transactions in hard currency may lead to a black market. In some cases, a central bank may attempt to increase confidence in the local currency by pegging it against a hard currency, as is this case with the Hong Kong dollar or the Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark. This may lead to problems if economic conditions force the government to break the currency peg (and either appreciate or depreciate sharply) as occurred in the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression.

In some cases, an economy may choose to abandon local currency altogether and adopt another country&#x27;s currency as legal tender. Examples include the adoption of the US dollar in Panama, Ecuador, El Salvador and Zimbabwe and the adoption of the German mark and later the euro in Serbia and Montenegro.

<text>Skein relations are a mathematical tool used to study knots. A central question in the mathematical theory of knots is whether two knot diagrams represent the same knot. One way to answer the question is using knot polynomials, which are invariants of the knot. If two diagrams have different polynomials, they represent different knots. However, the converse is not true.

Skein relations are often used to give a simple definition of knot polynomials. A skein relation gives a linear relation between the values of a knot polynomial on a collection of three links which differ from each other only in a small region. For some knot polynomials, such as the Conway, Alexander, and Jones polynomials, the relevant skein relations are sufficient to calculate the polynomial recursively.

==Definition==
A skein relationship requires three link diagrams that are identical except at one crossing. The three diagrams must exhibit the three possibilities that could occur for the two line segments at that crossing, one of the lines could pass &quot;under,&quot; the same line could be &quot;over&quot; or the two lines might not cross at all. Link diagrams must be considered because a single skein change can alter a diagram from representing a knot to one representing a link and vice versa. Depending on the knot polynomial in question, the links (or tangles) appearing in a skein relation may be oriented or unoriented.
The three diagrams are labelled as follows. Turn the three link diagram so the directions at the crossing in question are both roughly northward. One diagram will have northwest over northeast, it is labelled &quot;L&quot;−. Another will have northeast over northwest, it&#x27;s &quot;L&quot;+. The remaining diagram is lacking that crossing and is labelled &quot;L&quot;0.
(The labelling is independent of direction insofar as it remains the same if all directions are reversed. Thus polynomials on undirected knots are unambiguously defined by this method. However, the directions on &quot;links&quot; are a vital detail to retain as one recurses through a polynomial calculation.)

It is also sensible to think in a generative sense, by taking an existing link diagram and &quot;patching&quot; it to make the other two—just so long as the patches are applied with compatible directions.

To recursively define a knot (link) polynomial, a function &quot;F&quot; is fixed and for any triple of diagrams and their polynomials labelled as above,
:formula_1
or more pedantically
:formula_2 for all formula_3
(Finding an &quot;F&quot; which produces polynomials independent of the sequences of crossings used in a recursion is no trivial exercise.)

More formally, a skein relation can be thought of as defining the kernel of a quotient map from the planar algebra of tangles. Such a map corresponds to a knot polynomial if all closed diagrams are taken to some (polynomial) multiple of the image of the empty diagram.

==Example==
Sometime in the early 1960s, Conway showed how to compute the Alexander polynomial using skein relations. As it is recursive, it is not quite so direct as Alexander&#x27;s original matrix method; on the other hand, parts of the work done for one knot will apply to others. In particular, the network of diagrams is the same for all skein-related polynomials.

Let function &quot;P&quot; from link diagrams to Laurent series in formula_4 be
such that formula_5 and a triple of skein-relation diagrams formula_6 satisfies the equation
:formula_7
Then &quot;P&quot; maps a knot to one of its Alexander polynomials.

In this example, we calculate the Alexander polynomial of the cinquefoil knot (), the alternating knot with five crossings in its minimal diagram. At each stage we exhibit a relationship involving a more complex link and two simpler diagrams. Note that the more complex link is on the right in each step below except the last. For convenience, let &quot;A&quot; = &quot;x&quot;−1/2−x1/2.

To begin, we create two new diagrams by patching one of the cinquefoil&#x27;s crossings (highlighted in yellow) so

:&quot;P&quot;() = &quot;A&quot; × &quot;P&quot;() + &quot;P&quot;()

The second diagram is actually a trefoil; the first diagram is two unknots with four crossings. Patching the latter

:&quot;P&quot;() = &quot;A&quot; × &quot;P&quot;() + &quot;P&quot;()

gives, again, a trefoil, and two unknots with &quot;two&quot; crossings (the Hopf link ). Patching the trefoil

:&quot;P&quot;() = &quot;A&quot; × &quot;P&quot;() + &quot;P&quot;()

gives the unknot and, again, the Hopf link. Patching the Hopf link

:&quot;P&quot;() = &quot;A&quot; × &quot;P&quot;() + &quot;P&quot;()

gives a link with 0 crossings (unlink) and an unknot. The unlink takes a bit of sneakiness:

:&quot;P&quot;() = &quot;A&quot; × &quot;P&quot;() + &quot;P&quot;()

===Computations===
We now have enough relations to compute the polynomials of all the links we&#x27;ve encountered, and can use the above equations in reverse order to work up to the cinquefoil knot itself. The calculation is described in the table below, where ? denotes the unknown quantity we are solving for in each relation:
Thus the Alexander polynomial for a cinquefoil is P(x) = x−2 -x−1 +1 -x +x2.

==Etymology==

In knot theory, the term skein appears to have been coined by John Conway around 1979, and refers to the unit of measure of yarn in the textiles industry.

<doc id="314905" wikidata="Q1056451" url="?curid=314905" title="Reflective programming">
<text>In computer science, reflective programming or reflection is the ability of a process to examine, introspect, and modify its own structure and behavior.

==Historical background==
The earliest computers were programmed in their native assembly languages, which were inherently reflective, as these original architectures could be programmed by defining instructions as data and using self-modifying code. As the bulk of programming moved to higher-level compiled languages such as Algol, Cobol, Fortran, Pascal, and C, this reflective ability largely disappeared until new programming languages with reflection built into their type systems appeared.

Brian Cantwell Smith&#x27;s 1982 doctoral dissertation introduced the notion of computational reflection in procedural programming languages and the notion of the meta-circular interpreter as a component of 3-Lisp.

==Uses==
Reflection helps programmers make generic software libraries to display data, process different formats of data, perform serialization and deserialization of data for communication, or do bundling and unbundling of data for containers or bursts of communication.

Effective use of reflection almost always requires a plan: A design framework, encoding description, object library, a map of a database or entity relations.

Reflection makes a language more suited to network-oriented code. For example, it assists languages such as Java to operate well in networks by enabling libraries for serialization, bundling and varying data formats. Languages without reflection such as C are required to use auxiliary compilers for tasks like Abstract Syntax Notation to produce code for serialization and bundling.

Reflection can be used for observing and modifying program execution at runtime. A reflection-oriented program component can monitor the execution of an enclosure of code and can modify itself according to a desired goal of that enclosure. This is typically accomplished by dynamically assigning program code at runtime.

In object-oriented programming languages such as Java, reflection allows &quot;inspection&quot; of classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime without knowing the names of the interfaces, fields, methods at compile time. It also allows &quot;instantiation&quot; of new objects and &quot;invocation&quot; of methods.

Reflection is often used as part of software testing, such as for the runtime creation/instantiation of mock objects.

Reflection is also a key strategy for metaprogramming.

In some object-oriented programming languages such as C# and Java, reflection can be used to bypass member accessibility rules. For C#-properties this can be achieved by writing directly onto the (usually invisible) backing field of a non-public property. It is also possible to find non-public methods of classes and types and manually invoke them. This works for project-internal files as well as external libraries such as .NET&#x27;s assemblies and Java&#x27;s archives.

==Implementation==

A language that supports reflection provides a number of features available at runtime that would otherwise be difficult to accomplish in a lower-level language. Some of these features are the abilities to:
* Discover and modify source-code constructions (such as code blocks, classes, methods, protocols, etc.) as first-class objects at runtime.
* Convert a string matching the symbolic name of a class or function into a reference to or invocation of that class or function.
* Evaluate a string as if it were a source-code statement at runtime.
* Create a new interpreter for the language&#x27;s bytecode to give a new meaning or purpose for a programming construct.

These features can be implemented in different ways. In MOO, reflection forms a natural part of everyday programming idiom. When verbs (methods) are called, various variables such as &quot;verb&quot; (the name of the verb being called) and &quot;this&quot; (the object on which the verb is called) are populated to give the context of the call. Security is typically managed by accessing the caller stack programmatically: Since &quot;callers&quot;() is a list of the methods by which the current verb was eventually called, performing tests on &quot;callers&quot;()[0] (the command invoked by the original user) allows the verb to protect itself against unauthorised use.

Compiled languages rely on their runtime system to provide information about the source code. A compiled Objective-C executable, for example, records the names of all methods in a block of the executable, providing a table to correspond these with the underlying methods (or selectors for these methods) compiled into the program. In a compiled language that supports runtime creation of functions, such as Common Lisp, the runtime environment must include a compiler or an interpreter.

Reflection can be implemented for languages without built-in reflection by using a program transformation system to define automated source-code changes.

==Security considerations==

Reflection may allow a user to create unexpected control flow paths through an application, potentially bypassing security measures. This may be exploited by attackers. Historical vulnerabilities in Java caused by unsafe reflection allowed code retrieved from potentially untrusted remote machines to break out of the Java sandbox security mechanism. A large scale study of 120 Java vulnerabilities in 2013 concluded that unsafe reflection is the most common vulnerability in Java, though not the most exploited.

==Examples==
The following code snippets create an instance of class and invoke its method . For each programming language, normal and reflection-based call sequences are shown.

=== Common Lisp ===
The following is an example in Common Lisp using the Common Lisp Object System:
(defclass foo () ())
(defmethod print-hello ((f foo)) (format T &quot;Hello from ~S~%&quot; f))

;; Normal, without reflection
(let ((foo (make-instance &#x27;foo)))
 (print-hello foo))

;; With reflection to look up the class named &quot;foo&quot; and the method
;; named &quot;print-hello&quot; that specializes on &quot;foo&quot;.
(let* ((foo-class (find-class (read-from-string &quot;foo&quot;)))
 (print-hello-method (find-method (symbol-function (read-from-string &quot;print-hello&quot;))
 nil (list foo-class))))
 (funcall (sb-mop:method-generic-function print-hello-method)
 (make-instance foo-class)))
=== C# ===
The following is an example in C#:
// Without reflection
var foo = new Foo();
foo.PrintHello();

// With reflection
Object foo = Activator.CreateInstance(&quot;complete.classpath.and.Foo&quot;);
MethodInfo method = foo.GetType().GetMethod(&quot;PrintHello&quot;);
method.Invoke(foo, null);
===Delphi, Object Pascal===
This Delphi and Object Pascal example assumes that a class has been declared in a unit called :
uses RTTI, Unit1;

procedure WithoutReflection;
var
 Foo: TFoo;
begin
 Foo := TFoo.Create;
 try
 Foo.Hello;
 finally
 Foo.Free;
 end;
end;

procedure WithReflection;
var
 RttiContext: TRttiContext;
 RttiType: TRttiInstanceType;
 Foo: TObject;
begin
 RttiType := RttiContext.FindType(&#x27;Unit1.TFoo&#x27;) as TRttiInstanceType;
 Foo := RttiType.GetMethod(&#x27;Create&#x27;).Invoke(RttiType.MetaclassType, []).AsObject;
 try
 RttiType.GetMethod(&#x27;Hello&#x27;).Invoke(Foo, []);
 finally
 Foo.Free;
 end;
end;
===eC===
The following is an example in eC:
// Without reflection
Foo foo { };
foo.hello();

// With reflection
Class fooClass = eSystem_FindClass(__thisModule, &quot;Foo&quot;);
Instance foo = eInstance_New(fooClass);
Method m = eClass_FindMethod(fooClass, &quot;hello&quot;, fooClass.module);
((void (*)())(void *)m.function)(foo);
===Go===
The following is an example in Go:
import &quot;reflect&quot;

// Without reflection
f := Foo{}
f.Hello()

// With reflection
fT := reflect.TypeOf(Foo{})
fV := reflect.New(fT)

m := fV.MethodByName(&quot;Hello&quot;)
if m.IsValid() {
 m.Call(nil)


===Java===
The following is an example in Java:

import java.lang.reflect.Method;

// Without reflection
Foo foo = new Foo();
foo.hello();

// With reflection
try {
 Object foo = Foo.class.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();

 Method m = foo.getClass().getDeclaredMethod(&quot;hello&quot;, new Class&lt;?&gt;[0]);
 m.invoke(foo);
} catch (ReflectiveOperationException ignored) {}
===JavaScript===
The following is an example in JavaScript:
// Without reflection
const foo = new Foo()
foo.hello()

// With reflection
const foo = Reflect.construct(Foo)
const hello = Reflect.get(foo, &#x27;hello&#x27;)
Reflect.apply(hello, foo, [])

// With eval
eval(&#x27;new Foo().hello()&#x27;)
===Julia===
The following is an example in Julia:

julia&gt; struct Point
 x::Int
 y
 end

# Inspection with reflection
julia&gt; fieldnames(Point)
(:x, :y)

julia&gt; fieldtypes(Point)
(Int64, Any)

julia&gt; p = Point(3,4)

# Access with reflection
julia&gt; getfield(p, :x)
3
===Objective-C===
The following is an example in Objective-C, implying either the OpenStep or Foundation Kit framework is used:
// Foo class.
@interface Foo : NSObject
- (void)hello;
@end

// Sending &quot;hello&quot; to a Foo instance without reflection.
Foo *obj = [[Foo alloc] init];
[obj hello];

// Sending &quot;hello&quot; to a Foo instance with reflection.
id obj = [[NSClassFromString(@&quot;Foo&quot;) alloc] init];
[obj performSelector: @selector(hello)];
===Perl===
The following is an example in [[Perl]]:
# Without reflection
my $foo = Foo-&gt;new;
$foo-&gt;hello;

# or
