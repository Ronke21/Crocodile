<text>Whoopi is an American television sitcom created by Bonnie and Terry Turner and starring Whoopi Goldberg that aired for one season on NBC. The series premiered on September 9, 2003, and ran until April 20, 2004. It was canceled by NBC in May 2004. The series revolved around the events and people at her hotel, the fictional Larchmont Hotel, in New York City.

==Premise==
Whoopi Goldberg starred in this comedy as one-hit wonder Mavis Rae, a cigarette-smoking, alcohol-drinking, menopausal and especially opinionated hotelier. In 1986, Mavis had one huge, spectacular hit song, the two-time Grammy Award-winning &quot;Don&#x27;t Hide Love&quot;. Quickly realizing that her initial success was a fluke, she parlayed her finances from that hit into purchasing the Lamont Hotel in Manhattan.

Mavis operates the hotel on her charm and wit while assisted by Iran native Nasim (Omid Djalili) and Eastern European housekeeper Jadwiga (Gordana Rashovich), who share a love-hate relationship with each other. Staying at the hotel is her baby brother Courtney (Wren T. Brown), a moderate Republican attorney who is attempting to get back on his feet after being laid off from Enron amidst its bankruptcy scandal. Courtney begins dating medical imager Rita Nash (Elizabeth Regen), who spoke jive and was portrayed with an exaggerated urban black stereotype despite the fact that she was white. Rita and Mavis frequently clashed over the course of the series, leading to many of the conflicts that drove the plot of each episode. Other plots revolved around political clashes between the conservative Courtney and the liberal Mavis; customer prejudice against the Persian Nasim, who was often mistaken for an Arab; and the all-female poker group that Mavis and Rita belong to.

<text>The Don River is a watercourse in southern Ontario that empties into Lake Ontario, at Toronto Harbour. Its mouth was just east of the street grid of the town of York, Upper Canada, the municipality that evolved into Toronto, Ontario. The Don is one of the major watercourses draining Toronto (along with the Humber, and Rouge Rivers) that have headwaters in the Oak Ridges Moraine.

The Don is formed from two rivers, the East and West Branches, that meet about north of Lake Ontario while flowing southward into the lake. The area below the confluence is known as the &quot;lower Don&quot;, and the areas above as the &quot;upper Don&quot;. The Don is also joined at the confluence by a third major branch, Taylor-Massey Creek. The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) is responsible for managing the river and its surrounding watershed.

==Toponymy==
In 1788, Alexander Aitkin, an English surveyor who worked in southern Ontario, referred to the Don River as &quot;Ne cheng qua kekonk&quot;. Elizabeth Simcoe, wife of Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe, reported in her diary that another name used was &quot;Wonscotanach&quot;. This is an Anishnaabe phrase meaning &quot;the river coming from the back burnt grounds&quot;, which could refer to an earlier forest fire in the poplar plains to the north. The name Don River was given by Lieutenant Governor Simcoe because the wide valley reminded him of the River Don in Yorkshire, England.
==History==
Humans are believed to have first arrived in the Don River area approximately 12,500 years BP, most likely as nomadic hunters. While there is little archaeological evidence in the Don valley itself, regional finds in the Great Lakes St. Lawrence area have revealed that permanent settlements started to occur about 6000 BP. The most significant recorded find is known as the &quot;Withrow Site&quot;. It was discovered in 1886 during road building just east of Riverdale Park. It contained human remains and other artifacts dating back to about 5000 years BP. 

Wendat longhouse villages were developed along the river starting in the 1300s when corn became a staple food. In the 1700s, the Mississaugas moved into the region, seeing the Haudenosaunee withdraw south of Lake Ontario. The French were the first Europeans to visit the region, trading at posts in the area. In the 1760s, the French were displaced by the British after the fall of Quebec.

The British and the Mississaugas concluded the problematic &quot;Toronto Purchase&quot; treaty in 1787. Believing the purchase to be a rental of the area, and not the release of their rights to the land, the Mississaugas surrendered most of the land that would become York, and then Toronto, and York County to the British. After a land claims process, the surrender of aboriginal title to the Toronto Purchase lands was eventually concluded in 2010 for financial considerations.

After the founding of York in 1793, several mills were constructed along the lower Don. One of the first was at Todmorden Mills. These mills initially turned out lumber, flour and paper products. By the 1850s, there were more than 50 mills along the Don and its tributaries. The Lower Don was becoming an industrial setting. Petroleum storage facilities, poultry and pork processing plants were constructed along the banks of the Don. In 1879, the Don Valley Brick Works opened. Polluted effluent from these factories and the growing city nearby was turning the Don and its marshy mouth into a polluted hazard.

There were two prominent hills that were north of Bloor. &quot;Sugar Loaf Hill&quot; at Bloor Street was a conical hill removed during the construction of the Prince Edward Viaduct (commonly referred to as the Bloor Viaduct). &quot;Tumper&#x27;s Hill&quot;, near Don Mills Road, was flattened in the 1960s during the construction of the Don Valley Parkway.

In the 1880s, the lower part of the Don south of the former Winchester Street bridge was straightened (east of the original mouth) and placed in a channel to create additional harbour space and industrial dock space for boats. Known as &quot;The Don Improvement Project&quot;, the straightened river was also supposed to divert the polluted waters into the Ashbridges Bay marsh. This proved unsuccessful so the mouth was turned 90 degrees west where it empties into the inner harbour. This short extension of the harbour is known as the Keating Channel. The channel north of Lake Shore Blvd. East ceased being navigable when the Gardiner Expressway was constructed in the 1950s. Boats may still enter the Keating Channel by going underneath a lift bridge at Cherry Street.

During the early part of the 20th century the river and the valley continued to be neglected. 31 separate sewage treatment facilities were constructed along the river. Over 20 sites in the valley and adjacent ravines were used as landfills for garbage and industrial refuse. In 1917, the Don Destructor was built beside the river, just north of Dundas Street East. The incinerator operated for 52 years, burning about 50,000 tonnes of rubbish annually.

In the 1910s through to the early 1930s, the Don Valley was used as a camping site by the homeless. These sites were commonly referred to as the &quot;hobo jungle&quot; of the valley. Campers at the hobo jungle were often harassed, arrested, and raided by police.

In 1946, a plan by the Shirriff company to demolish pioneer dwellings in the area of Todmorden Mills led outraged citizens to form the Don Valley Conservation Association volunteer organization. The Association&#x27;s opposition was successful in causing Shirriff to abandon the project in 1947. The Association continued its activities, planting tree seedlings, halting the picking of wild flowers, particularly trilliums and preventing vandalism. The Association held educational events to educate the public about the Don Valley, including special trains through the valley, and a recreation of Lt. Governor Simcoe&#x27;s journey up the Don by canoe. The Association also advocated for the building of trunk sewers to stop the run-off of pollution into the Don.

After World War II, rapid urban expansion occurred in the northern reaches of the watershed. At the same time, interest in conservation led to the formation of conservation authorities across Ontario for watershed management. Authorities were established to manage watersheds, and the Don Valley Conservation Authority was established in 1947. The authority had limited powers, and was funded by local municipalities which had to pay for specific land purchases. For example, a 1950 plan to build a large conservation area on the East Don River at Milne Hollow at Lawrence Avenue never came to fruition over the high cost of development.

In 1954, Hurricane Hazel struck the Toronto area. Most of the damage occurred in the Humber River area. While there was some flooding, substantially less rain fell over the Don Watershed and there was no loss of life. However, the impact of the hurricane led to changes for the conservation authorities in the Toronto region. In 1957, the DVCA, along with other Toronto-area conservation authorities, was reformed into the Metro Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and given a mandate to construct flood control features as well as acquire property in the Don and other valleys to prevent a future re-occurrence of the disaster. Large tracts of industrial land adjacent to the river were added to the regulatory floodplain. This meant that the MTRCA had a veto on any developments that were not flood-proofed. The MTRCA became the TRCA in 1998.

In the 1950s and early 1960s, the Don Valley Parkway (DVP) was constructed through the Lower Don to serve growing commuter traffic. The project was a large civil engineering project. Homes, farms, and cottages in the valley were expropriated. Two hills within the valley were leveled and the soil used for grading the highway. The railways and the river were re-routed, Don Mills Road was improved and the Eglinton Avenue and Lawrence Avenue concession roads were extended across the valley. At the intersection of Lawrence and the Parkway, the remains of the old village of Milneford Mills were removed. Bayview Avenue was extended south into the valley along the west bank of the valley.

Increasing development reduced the natural areas of the watershed. This impacted the Don with increased pollution, heavy flooding, and turbid sediment laden waters. The combined result meant that by the 1960s the river had become a neglected, polluted mess. In 1969, Pollution Probe held a much celebrated &quot;Funeral for the Don&quot; to highlight the plight of the river.

Efforts to restore the Don gathered steam in 1989 with a public forum at the Ontario Science Centre which was attended by about 500 people. The result was the formation of the Task Force to Bring Back the Don, a citizen&#x27;s advisory body to Toronto City Council. Their mandate and vision was to make the Don &quot;clean, green, and accessible&quot;. Since then they have hosted garbage cleanups, tree plantings, and help to create or restore eight wetlands in the lower reaches of the valley, including Chester Springs Marsh, a site south of the Bloor Viaduct. Other groups also became active including Friends of the Don East. In 1995, the MTRCA created the Don Watershed Regeneration Council to coordinate restoration efforts throughout the watershed.

In 1991 Bring Back the Don released a document called &quot;Bringing Back the Don&quot; which laid out plans for restoration, including a renaturalized mouth of the Don. In 1998 a plan to revive Toronto&#x27;s waterfront was initiated. One of the four projects mentioned was a natural mouth for the Don River. In 2001 an environmental assessment was started to look into a natural mouth of the Don. The project was also coupled with a plan to handle a major flood modeled on the expected output from a Hurricane Hazel size storm. In 2007, the Toronto Waterfront Development Corporation (now WaterfrontToronto) held a design competition that looked at four different configurations for the mouth of the Don. The winning bid was made by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates. The environmental assessment was completed in 2014 and construction began in 2016. In 2024, Waterfront Toronto announced that it had connected the Don River to the new mouth of the river channel and completed the creation of a new island, Ookwemin Minising. For the first time since the 1880s the Keating Channel was no longer the primary outlet for the river into Toronto Harbour.

Since the cessation of industrial pollution and the cleanup efforts by various groups, the river has regenerated to the point where a number of species of fish have returned to the river, and there is a limited sports fishery.

===Wonscotonach Parklands (Don River Valley Park)===
In October 2016, the city of Toronto announced the creation of a Don River Valley Park that will stretch for from the West Don Lands up to approximately Todmorden Village in the north. The park will have three zones, an urban zone from West Don Lands to Riverdale Park, a park zone from Riverdale north to Bloor and finally a natural zone for the remaining section to Todmorden Village. Trails for biking and pedestrian use will be connected from existing ones for recreational and transportation needs. Another aim for the park is restoration of land and the upper sections of the Don River. The project aims to revitalize the ravine space through a series of projects that will advance the priorities set out in the city of Toronto&#x27;s Lower Don Trail Master Plan, prepared by DTAH. Together with a series of accessible new entry points, the Master Plan calls for the reclamation of former green spaces throughout the valley, including the former snow dump site north of the Bloor Viaduct. Naturalized ecological conditions throughout the valley would offer improved flood protection. A &quot;nature-inspired&quot; public art program is set to launch in 2017, aiming to strengthen the cultural presence of the Don Valley, which—according to the Master Plan—already serves as a de facto backyard to some 250,000 Torontonians. This new park will be under the management of the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. In 2018 City Council directed staff to consult community about naming the network of parks in the Lower Don &quot;Wonscotonach Parklands&quot;, with &quot;Wonscotonach&quot; meaning &quot;black burnt grounds&quot; or &quot;area previously swept by fire&quot;, deriving as an Anglicized form of the name &quot;Waasayishkodenayosh&quot; meaning &quot;burning bright point&quot; or &quot;peninsula&quot; in Anishinaabemowin.

==Geography==
===Geology===
The Don Valley is notable because of its deep wide valley in the lower reaches. At the Bloor Street Viaduct, the valley is about 400 m wide while the river is only about 15 m wide. This is due to its glacial origins. The Don River and its deep valley were formed about 12,000 years ago at the end of the Wisconsinan Glaciation. During that glaciation which lasted for 35,000 years, all of Ontario was covered in ice. As the climate warmed the glaciers began to melt. As the ice front retreated in southern Ontario, several rivers were formed that drained into Lake Iroquois, a glacier lake which was the precursor to Lake Ontario. The Don River is now small in comparison to the deep and wide valley that resulted from its glacial origin. The Don River is now classified as an underfit river.

The landscape at that time was loose glacial till so the large amounts of glacier melt water eroded deep valleys over thousands of years. As time progressed, isostatic uplift caused the earth&#x27;s plate to rise and tilt. This caused Lake Iroquois to drain towards the south. A remnant of its shoreline can be seen on the north side of Davenport Road in Toronto. In the Don Valley, the old shoreline is evident just north of Eglinton Avenue. Today the source of the Don River is the Oak Ridges Moraine, another legacy of the Wisconsin glaciation.

The location of the old shoreline delineates a change in the soils in the Don watershed. Soils north of the old shoreline are mostly luvisolic &quot;Halton Till&quot; while south of the shoreline they are sandy glaciolacustrine deposits.

The Don Valley provides an appropriate location for studying the regional geological history. The Don Valley Brick Works was an old brick making factory with a quarry where they extracted shale. At the rear wall, local geologists discovered a record of the past three glaciations. There are nine distinct layers visible dating back 120,000 years.

===Hydrology===

Due to the urbanized nature of the watershed, the Don River experiences low base flows interspersed with high volume floods. The water level can rise very quickly following a moderate to heavy rainfall, up to 1–2 metres inside of three hours. The average base flow for the Don River is about 4 m3/s. Peak flows occur in late February and late September which corresponds to seasonal variation in the Toronto region. Maximum flows, based on a Hurricane Hazel level flood have been estimated at nearly 1700 m3/s. On August 19, 2005, an unusually strong summer storm caused short term flooding in the Don Valley. Peak flow rates for that event were measured at 55.3 m3/s. Since high flow rates occur during storm events, the resulting floods tend to scour the bottom of the river which reduces fish habitat. In addition, the flood waters carry a large amount of sediment washed into the river from surrounding tablelands. The sediment collects in the Keating Channel just past the mouth of the river. The TRCA which is responsible for the dredging estimates that the amount of sediment dredged is 35,000 m3/year weighing nearly .

===Course and tributaries===
The east branch of the Don, also called the Little Don River, rises at the south edge of the Oak Ridges Moraine just to the west of Yonge Street, flowing south-eastward through ravine forests in Richmond Hill, Thornhill, east of Willowdale and Don Mills.

A second branch of the eastern Don, known as German Mills Creek, parallels the main eastern branch and joins it at Steeles Avenue, the northern boundary of Toronto. South of Lawrence Avenue the river passes through the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve. This area is mostly undeveloped parkland. The reserve occupies the valley south to the forks of the Don. It was at one time home of a Maple sugar shack and tapline, which was visited yearly by students from across East York. Charles Sauriol was a historic protector of the Don.

The western branch starts Vaughan, in the Maple district; flowing south-east through the suburban industrial area of Concord, and the G. Ross Lord Reservoir. It crosses Yonge Street as it flows through Hoggs Hollow, past York University&#x27;s Glendon (&quot;valley of the Don&quot;) campus, and then flows on to Leaside, Flemingdon Park, and Thorncliffe Park before joining the eastern half.

The western section of Taylor-Massey Creek and the southern portion of the western branch are surrounded by parkland (see also: &quot;Toronto ravine system&quot;). In more recent years the retreat of the industrial plants and rail infrastructure has freed up room which is now being turned into bicycling trails, which now extend from the shore of Lake Ontario northward in several directions to provide some 30 km of off-road paved trails. While Toronto is fairly flat in general, local cyclists have developed a number of technically challenging singletrack trails throughout the area, following the main trails.

Downstream from the forks, the river flows through a wooded area known as Crothers&#x27; Woods which is designated as an Environmentally Sensitive Area due to the high quality beech-maple forest that grows on the ravine slopes. South of Pottery Road it enters a more degraded section and ends up in a straightened section that includes cement and steel dock wall, a remnant from an earlier industrial era. The river flows from there into the Keating Channel at Lake Shore Boulevard East which is at the north east corner of the Toronto Harbour.

To control flooding from the Don River, Waterfront Toronto&#x27;s Port Lands Flood Protection Project extended the river south past the Keating Channel (roughly parallel to the west side of the Don Roadway), and then west (roughly parallel to the south side of Commissioners Street) to a new mouth at Toronto Harbour. The man-made extension naturalized the river valley and provided new parkland. Since 2024, water now flows into the Keating Channel from the Don River and the new mouth of the river. A byproduct of the river extension is the creation of Ookewmin Minising, at the north-west corner of Toronto&#x27;s Port Lands.

==Cleanup==
In the 1880s, sewers were laid through ravines in the Don Valley to carry sewage, offal and industrial effluents. Pollution and foul odours continued until the late 1950s. Since then, small improvements have been made. The city installed waste water storage tanks, required homeowners to disconnect downspouts, and swept streets for contaminants that flowed into waterways. Since 1979, the Lower Don has shown improvements in dissolved oxygen, phosphates and suspended solids; however by 2021, the tributary Taylor-Massey Creek had shown little improvement.

, the Don River still suffers from sewage pollution during heavy rainfalls, when storm sewers carrying both rain water and sewage overflow into the Don River and its tributaries. To remedy this problem, the city is spending $3billion to build three tunnels totaling in length to divert sewage away from the river and redirect it to the Ashbridges Bay Treatment Plant. The project began in 2018 with an expected completion in 2038 of all three tunnels plus five storm water storage shafts. , a tunnel boring machine has completed roughly half of the Coxwell Bypass tunnel located underground alongside the Lower Don south of the Leaside Bridge.

<text>Within the field of icon painting, levkas is the mixture of fine alabaster powder, calcium sulfate (a form of gypsum), or calcium carbonate (chalk) along with glue (often rabbit skin glue, sometimes fish glue derived from the bladder of a sturgeon) applied in layers to a surface prior to gilding that surface with gold leaf or painting it, similar to gesso. The levkas is a bright white color which allows the colors of the paint to appear their brightest. As many as six to seven layers may be applied in preparation for the painting of a religious icon. A painting or icon whose surface has been damaged may have lost some of its layers of levkas.

The word derives from the Greek word &quot;leukos&quot; which means &quot;white&quot;, and is derived from the name of the Greek island sometimes referred to by the same name which was the source of much of the white chalk used for creating this mixture.

<text>Las Vegas is an American comedy-drama television series created by Gary Scott Thompson. It was broadcast by NBC from September 22, 2003, to February 15, 2008, airing for five seasons. It focuses on a team of people working at the Montecito, a fictional hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The employees deal with various issues that arise within the working environment, ranging from casino security to restaurant management and valet parking. &quot;Las Vegas&quot; starred James Caan, Josh Duhamel, Nikki Cox, James Lesure, Vanessa Marcil, Molly Sims, Marsha Thomason, and eventually Tom Selleck. The series originally centered on Ed Deline (Caan), a strict ex-CIA officer who serves as the president of operations for the Montecito. Former Marine Counterintelligence/HUMINT (CI/HUMINT) officer, Danny McCoy (Duhamel), who is Ed&#x27;s protégé, later becomes the Montecito&#x27;s new president.

The pilot episode began filming in March 2003, and was produced for $5 million, making it the most expensive pilot in NBC history. Production for a full season began later that year. Much of the series filming occurred at Culver Studios in California, where a set was constructed to represent the Montecito. Some filming also occasionally took place in Las Vegas. The Mandalay Bay and Green Valley Ranch, two hotel-casinos in the Las Vegas Valley, were sometimes used to portray the Montecito.

&quot;Las Vegas&quot; marked Caan&#x27;s first starring role in a television series. Thomason left the series after the second season to pursue other projects, and Caan and Cox departed in 2007, after completing season four. Caan wanted to resume his film career, and Cox was let go due to budget cuts, which were needed in order to greenlight a fifth season. After Caan&#x27;s departure, Selleck was added to the cast as a new character. The series originally aired on Monday nights, before being moved to Friday nights in 2006. Ratings declined following the move, and &quot;Las Vegas&quot; was eventually canceled on February 20, 2008, ending the series with several cliffhangers.

==Premise==
&quot;Las Vegas&quot; is a comedy drama that focuses primarily on Danny McCoy and his boss Ed Deline. They and others work at the Montecito, a fictional hotel-casino located on the Las Vegas Strip. The employees deal with a variety of issues, such as casino security, restaurant management, and valet parking. Danny, a former U.S. Marine 1st Lt. Counterintelligence/HUMINT (CI/HUMINT) officer initially works under the resort&#x27;s head of security, Ed, former CIA counterintelligence chief. Early in the first season, Ed is promoted to president of operations. Danny has on-and-off relationships with Mary, a childhood friend; and Delinda, who is Ed&#x27;s daughter.

The Montecito undergoes several ownership changes during the course of the series. The resort is demolished in the season-two finale in favor of a new Montecito, which opens in the third season under the ownership of Monica Mancuso. Following the end of season four, Ed and Mary go into hiding after killing her father, who sexually abused her as a child. In the fifth season, the Montecito is purchased by A.J. Cooper, a billionaire and former Marine. Danny becomes the new president of operations, and he moves in with Delinda, who is pregnant with their first child.

==Episodes==

==Cast and characters==
===Main===
* (James Caan) is initially the head of security and surveillance for the Montecito, but is promoted to president of operations in the eighth episode. He is portrayed as a loving husband and father, as well as a father figure to his employees, especially Danny. Nevertheless, he is a tough man and does not hesitate to use violence to get what he wants. As the former director of counterintelligence for the CIA, his past has come back to haunt him on several occasions. During season three, Ed is briefly in retirement due to disagreements with the new Montecito owner, although he soon returns to his position. Caan and his character depart the series in season five when Ed becomes a wanted man for killing Mary Connell&#x27;s father. Ed goes into hiding and resumes work for the CIA, being stationed in Paris.
* (Josh Duhamel) is initially Ed Deline&#x27;s apprentice and good friend who is later promoted to head of security for the Montecito. During season three, Danny briefly serves as president of operations for the resort, after Ed resigns. Upon Ed&#x27;s return, Danny is reinstated as head of security. Danny is officially named the new president in season 5. Danny was born and raised in Las Vegas. At the end of season two, his father Larry McCoy (John Terry) dies in an accident and Danny inherits his father&#x27;s house and construction company. Danny sells the house and uses the money to buy a condo. Danny is a former U.S. Marine, with guerrilla and counterintelligence training. He is recalled into military service in Iraq at the end of season one. In season two, he is awarded the Silver Star after calling in an air strike over his unit and himself when they were ambushed and overrun. Only he survives the strike. He is involved in an on-and-off relationship with Ed&#x27;s daughter, Delinda, in season one. Danny and Mary have known each other since childhood, and they also have an on-and-off relationship. Danny proposes to Mary, but she calls off the engagement because she feels that he has a lot of things to sort out for himself. He ultimately begins living with girlfriend Delinda, who is pregnant with their first child in the final season.
* Mary Connell (Nikki Cox) is the special events director at the casino. A Las Vegas native, her father sexually abused her when she was a child, and Danny always came to her rescue. She is sometimes involved in a relationship with Danny, who proposes to her in season two – she accepts, then later calls off the engagement. In season three, Mary is promoted to hotel manager. In season four, she helps her stepmother and half sisters testify against her father – a case which is lost because of his connections. Near the end of season four, she purchases a gun to shoot her father. Cox departed the series and did not return for the fifth season. Explaining her character&#x27;s absence, Mary is hiding from the law for her part in her father&#x27;s murder, but is apparently safe, as she sends Danny a photo with a house and white picket fence (her dream house).
* Mike Cannon (James Lesure) is Danny&#x27;s friend who studied mechanical engineering at MIT. He works as head valet for the first season, but is recruited by Ed to the security department to help during Danny&#x27;s military absence. He stays on as security personnel following Danny&#x27;s return. In season 5, Mike is promoted to head of security and surveillance. In the pilot episode, Mike has a wife and daughter; this plot line is seemingly abandoned thereafter. Mike and Nessa become close in season two, until she leaves to be with her father and sister. Mike and Piper get married in the final season.
* Samantha Jane &quot;Sam&quot; Marquez (Vanessa Marcil) is the self-proclaimed best casino host in the world. She lives in a Montecito suite and is portrayed as a ruthless businesswoman whose sole interest is to get high rollers to play at the Montecito. However, in the fourth season, she reveals that she is only &quot;cold and jaded because everyone expects it of her&quot;, and &quot;underneath it all, she is weak and pathetic like everyone else.&quot; She was married to billionaire Casey Manning, from whom she was estranged for seven years prior to divorcing. She is also involved in an on-and-off relationship with Det. Woody Hoyt from &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;, until it ends in the fourth season. During this season, she is seen to be currently in love with and waiting for Jeremy, who fell into a 20-year coma after falling off a stool at a slot machine; he is the man who first brought her to Las Vegas from Austin, Texas. After Casey&#x27;s death, Sam is left in control of the Montecito, but she fails to pay back taxes owed on the property. Her ownership lasts for a week, until A.J. Cooper buys the Montecito by paying off the taxes. In the season-five finale, Casey&#x27;s younger brother Vic Manning visits the Montecito to take over ownership. At the end of the show, Sam and Vic plan to get married. When asked why Sam wants to marry Vic – she always stated she did not have feelings for him, though he loved her – she says it is because Vic understands her and will not try to change her; plus, he reminds her of Casey.
* (Molly Sims) is Ed and Jillian&#x27;s daughter. She is the entertainment manager for the Montecito&#x27;s clubs, and also works as the food and beverage manager for the resort. Delinda is shown to have a genius-level IQ, and once majored in psychology, but decided the human race&#x27;s biggest problem is that they are boring. During season three, Delinda leaves the Montecito to work for another casino. She returns at the request of new Montecito owner Monica Mancuso, who is disappointed that club earnings have dropped without her. Derek, an old college flame, asks Delinda to marry him in season three. She accepts the proposal, but just before the ceremony, Ed is shot. In the fray of Ed&#x27;s medical crisis, Delinda calls off the wedding. In season five, she becomes pregnant with Danny&#x27;s child, and they begin a relationship. At the end of the season-five finale, Delinda becomes overwhelmed with pain after just learning that Montecito owner A.J. Cooper is alive; he was supposedly killed in a plane crash. Delinda begins bleeding, although the series ends on a cliffhanger, leaving the fate of her unborn baby unknown.
* (Marsha Thomason), also known as &quot;The Ice Queen&quot;, is the head pit boss of the Montecito and is described as being the best in Las Vegas. She was born in Manchester, England, and has a shady past due to her father&#x27;s connections with Ed Deline. Her father was a well-known gambler, cheater, and con artist, who was forcefully recruited into the CIA and faked his death. Nessa was raised by Ed and Jillian for some years, and is referred to as a sister to Delinda. At the opening of season three, Nessa is explained to have left Las Vegas and been given a new identity to be able to live with her father and long-lost sister. She and Mike had been getting closer to a relationship, although she fails to say goodbye to him.
* A.J. Cooper (Tom Selleck) becomes the latest owner of the Montecito in season five. He is a former Marine and cattle rancher from Wyoming who stirs things up at the casino. His net worth is about $2 billion. Cooper was a black ops Marine in the Vietnam War and awarded the Bronze Star for his work. During his time in the Marines, he served in the Battle of Khe Sanh. In the season five finale, Cooper&#x27;s jet crashes during a business trip, and he is presumed dead. However, during the final moments of the show, Cooper arrives at his memorial service and appears to be fine.

===Recurring===
* (Lara Flynn Boyle) becomes the new owner of the Montecito in season three. She is portrayed as self-centered and bull-headed, and is generally disliked by the staff. At age 25, she married an 83-year-old billionaire. Upon his death at age 93, she inherited his fortune and used it to purchase and upgrade the Montecito. Dedicated to proving that she is more than just a woman who inherited money, she is determined to make the Montecito a success. She uses the resort as collateral to try purchasing other casinos in Las Vegas. Nine episodes into the third season, Monica dies in a freak accident: a gust of wind blows her off the roof of the Montecito and down the Las Vegas Strip, before she crashes into a shoe store. Her outfit, with wing-like sleeves, contributed to her being blown off the roof. The scene was created to be humorous. In accordance with her final wishes, the Montecito staff flush her cremated remains down a toilet in her suite at the resort.
* Casey Manning (Dean Cain) is a shrewd and cunning businessman, and Sam Marquez&#x27;s ex-husband. He buys the Montecito in the third season, following Monica&#x27;s death. In season four, Casey is killed in a fishing accident: a giant squid envelops him off the coast of New Zealand. The autopsy reveals that he was poisoned before the accident. He leaves the Montecito to Sam, who faces tax problems he left. In the series finale, Sam plans to marry Casey&#x27;s brother Vic, though she does not love him, because Vic reminds her of Casey.
* Piper Nielsen (Camille Guaty), the newest concierge of the Montecito, is introduced in season five. She is fired for letting an underage person gamble, but Cooper pays a $1 million fine to hire her back, raising speculation among the casino staff about their relationship. Piper never knew who her father was, until Cooper reveals that they served together in the Marines. Before her father died, Cooper promised that he would keep an eye on Piper. As she moved to various states over the years, he did the same in order to be there for her, though without her knowledge. Mike and Piper get married near the end of the season.
* Mitch Sassen (Mitch Longley) is a regular member of the surveillance team, and like the actor who plays him, he is paraplegic and uses a wheelchair.
* Jillian Deline (Cheryl Ladd) is Ed&#x27;s wife and Delinda&#x27;s mother. Jillian expresses growing resentment of Ed&#x27;s time on the job. In the season-four finale, Jillian says she will leave Ed if he decides to purchase the Montecito. In the opening of season five, she is revealed to support Ed&#x27;s decision for better or worse after learning of her future grandchild. She leaves Ed after they move away under sketchy circumstances.
* Luis Perez (Guy Ecker) is a Las Vegas police detective who appears in the first two seasons. He is a childhood friend of Danny and Mary, and friend of Ed Deline and his team. He also had served in the Marines, and his unit is later recalled for service in Iraq, where he dies in the first week there. A funeral is held in his honor with Ed and everyone attending, and he is discovered to have a child whose existence was unknown to him.
* Kathy Berson (Rikki Klieman) is the Montecito&#x27;s main legal adviser and lawyer, introduced in season two. If any legal issues arise, Kathy is the first person whom everyone asks.
* Polly (Suzanne Whang) is a Korean manicurist in the Montecito&#x27;s spa. She is introduced in season three, and later forms a friendship with A.J. Cooper. Polly openly discusses her sexual experiences.
* Sarasvati Kumar (Lakshmi Manchu) is an accountant for the casino. She appears in the first three seasons, and eventually begins a relationship with Mike, although this ends in the season-three finale after she goes home with Delinda&#x27;s bachelorette party strippers.
* Gunther (Harry Groener), appearing in the first three seasons, is the temperamental executive chef at the Montecito&#x27;s original restaurant. He habitually has issues that require Delinda&#x27;s attention, and develops a rivalry with Wolfgang Puck when the more famous chef opens a restaurant at the casino. Gunther eventually quits after losing a cook-off to Puck; he sells his restaurant to Charo.
* Erika (Anna Pheil), appearing in seasons three through five, is a hard-as-nails barmaid Danny hires on a lark when he sees her dealing with customers while tending bar at a strip club.
* Shannon (Malaya Drew) is a member of the Montecito&#x27;s security. She plays a small role in six episodes, spanning the third and fourth season. She briefly shows interest in Mike.

===Notable guest stars===
Various guest stars have appeared on the show, sometimes portraying themselves. Notable guest stars have included Alec Baldwin, Little Richard, Mark McGrath, Sylvester Stallone, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman, Norm Clarke, Jewel, Wayne Newton and Gladys Knight. Larry Manetti and Roger E. Mosley made a guest appearance in season 5 as characters named Larry and Roger, who are friends of A.J. Cooper. Selleck, Manetti, and Mosley had previously starred on &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, and their appearance together in &quot;Las Vegas&quot; marked their first reunion since the ending of &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; in 1988.

==Production==
===Development===

&quot;Las Vegas&quot; was created by Gary Scott Thompson, who also served as an executive producer. The idea for the series dates back to Las Vegas vacations that Thompson would take in the late 1980s. On one trip, Thompson developed a vision of a dead body lying in the desert, and then &quot;we pan up and there&#x27;s the Strip 50 yards away. That was what ended up in the pilot, that opening shot, but I couldn&#x27;t ever figure out what that went to. So I had that thing in my head for 15 years.&quot; At various points, Thompson tried developing this idea into a novel or play.

In 2002, Thompson had been working with NBC on a television pilot for a different series; although this pilot was unsuccessful, NBC officials who worked with Thompson later asked him to create a Las Vegas-based series. At the time, Thompson felt that there was a lack of &quot;fun&quot; and entertaining shows on television, telling NBC that there were too many procedural dramas such as &quot;CSI&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. For &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, Thompson was inspired by the city&#x27;s evolving history and its megaresorts, saying, &quot;If there are 127,000 (hotel) rooms in the city, that means I&#x27;ve got a potential 127,000 stories every week, because everybody&#x27;s got a story, and so do all the people who live here.&quot; The show would be reminiscent of the 1970s series &quot;Vegas&quot;. Originally known under the working title &quot;Casino Eye&quot;, the new series would also include Scott Steindorff as producer. Initially, Don Johnson was also going to serve as an executive producer, although he ultimately had no involvement in the final project.

===Casting and character changes===

James Caan was among several actors considered for the role of Ed Deline, although the producers were initially unsure that they could get Caan to sign on. Johnson was considered for the role, but turned it down. Caan was cast at the last minute, marking his first starring role in a television series. Caan later said that he took the television role due to a lack of film offers. He also said in 2005 that he had never watched the series. Caan was initially doubtful about starring in a series; he insisted that his role require effort on his part, and that the character be &quot;multidimensional and complex.&quot; As originally written, the character would spend much of his time in a surveillance room looking at camera footage. Caan disliked this idea and considered the role limited, saying that Ed Deline should be &quot;more elastic, so there could be some humor.&quot; Caan had the role rewritten, allowing his character to spend time outside of the surveillance room. Actress Molly Sims said about Caan, &quot;If the writing&#x27;s not good, or he doesn&#x27;t like it, he&#x27;s very picky, but that&#x27;s what makes it good. He adds clout to our show.&quot; Caan and Sims did not get along for the first two seasons. Approximately 350 women auditioned for the role of Delinda Deline, before it eventually went to Sims.

The character of Danny McCoy was developed by Thompson to be a Las Vegas resident, like himself. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s a city of almost 2 million people. We wanted to capture not just the Strip. People live here and it&#x27;s their home, and we wanted to capture that.&quot; Nikki Cox&#x27;s character, Mary, was originally an escort in the pilot episode, although her title was changed to events planner for the rest of the series. According to Sims, &quot;I believe the network felt that it would be &#x27;unseemly&#x27; to have your protagonist&#x27;s girl-next-door sweetheart and the ultimate love of his life be an escort.&quot; The part of Nessa was originally written as a 60-year-old man, although Thompson was impressed enough with Marsha Thomason&#x27;s audition that he rewrote the role for her. Thomason signed a seven-year contract, but later departed the series after the second season, in order to pursue other projects.

===Filming===
Filming for the pilot episode began on March 17, 2003, in the Las Vegas Valley. Filming locations included the Mandalay Bay resort, the Fremont Street Experience, and a warehouse that the production crew used to build a surveillance room set. The pilot cost $5 million, making it the most expensive in NBC history. Filming lasted nearly three weeks, and the pilot was picked up shortly thereafter. Series production began in July 2003, with an eight-day shooting schedule for each hour-long episode. Each episode initially cost $2.3 million to produce, although the budget was gradually raised to $2.7 million as the series progressed.

Although most of the production occurred in California, some filming also occasionally took place in Las Vegas. Filming primarily occurred at Culver Studios in California. Steindorff said that the writers would make regular visits to Las Vegas to &quot;immerse themselves in that world&quot;. Thompson said that during these trips, the team would ask real security guards &quot;if it&#x27;s too far-fetched if we do X, Y and Z. They say, &#x27;Are you crazy? That happens all of the time&#x27;&quot;.

The series premiered in September 2003, and its success prompted NBC to greenlight nine additional episodes for the season. The show went over budget in its first season, necessitating the need for a cheap episode that would keep the cast on the Montecito set in California. As a result, an episode was written in which a blackout and a murder occur simultaneously at the Montecito, keeping the characters at the resort. Thompson said, &quot;We were not allowed to have any guest appearances. I thought, &#x27;How do we trap them all in the casino.&#x27;&quot; The episode received some criticism from people who doubted that a casino blackout was possible, although such an event occurred at the Bellagio resort a few months after the episode aired.

To refresh the series, Thompson wrote in the demolition of the Montecito for the end of season two, with a new version of the resort being opened in the third season. In addition, Lara Flynn Boyle was cast as Monica Mancuso, the new owner of the Montecito, in July 2005. For the role, Boyle took inspiration from Shirley MacLaine: &quot;I always daydreamed about being one of the Rat Pack. Shirley MacLaine could really hold her own with [Frank Sinatra and] the boys. I feel the same way — never let them see you sweat or cry.&quot;

====Montecito====
Early on, the Culver Studios complex had eight sets that depicted the Montecito resort, including a casino set. Other sets depicted hotel rooms, hallways, elevators, a dance club, and the Montecito&#x27;s surveillance room. A coffee shop set was added for the second season. Some Montecito scenes were also filmed at the Mandalay Bay, particularly in the casino and at the resort&#x27;s wave pool. Glenn Schaeffer, the president of Mandalay Resort Group, also made several appearances in early episodes. During season 1, the Green Valley Ranch, a hotel-casino in Henderson, Nevada, was also used to portray the Montecito.

A new Montecito set was created for the third season, measuring and occupying three stories across six sound stages. The production team incorporated product placement into the set to alleviate its high cost. Among the brands featured in the third season was Aston Martin, which is shown to have a dealership at the Montecito. This was done following the opening of a Ferrari dealership at the new Wynn resort. Thompson wanted the series to feel current with the latest attractions in Las Vegas. A Wolfgang Puck restaurant was also added to the set, and Puck appeared as himself in the series.

As of season 4, the Montecito set included 146 slot machines and 24 table games. This set went $2 million over budget, but was built in eight weeks to meet the deadline for the start of filming. Exterior shots show the Montecito at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip, across the street from the Luxor resort, although the views from interior shots imply different and contradictory locations on the Strip. Ahead of the fifth season premiere, Thompson joked about the Montecito&#x27;s location, &quot;We&#x27;re just going to keep moving it around, just to piss people off.&quot;

===Final seasons and cancellation===
Season 3 saw a drop in ratings, and &quot;Las Vegas&quot; was only renewed for 17 episodes in its next season, instead of the standard 22. The series was facing cancellation after the premiere of its fourth season. For the season finale, Thompson told NBC, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna make this the biggest cliffhanger anyone&#x27;s ever seen. And if you cancel us, you&#x27;re gonna have 15 million fans pissed off at you, not me.&quot; The fate of a fifth season was contingent on budget cuts. NBC announced a fifth season in February 2007, while stating that Caan and Nikki Cox would depart the series. Caan had wanted to resume his film career; he previously had to pass on several film opportunities due to conflicts with the &quot;Las Vegas&quot; production schedule. Cox was let go from the production due to budget cuts. Although she was upset and surprised by the decision, she had also suggested during season 4 that it may be time for her to move on from the series. Like Cox, Caan&#x27;s departure would also allow for budget cuts. The writers were caught off-guard by the cast departures, which were announced at the last minute.

Tom Selleck was cast in April 2007, as the Montecito&#x27;s new owner, A.J. Cooper. &quot;Las Vegas&quot; marked Selleck&#x27;s first main role on a television series since &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; Selleck was Thompson&#x27;s first choice for the role. To prepare, Selleck watched the previous season on DVD. Selleck&#x27;s character would fill the void left by Caan, while a new female concierge (ultimately played by Camille Guaty) would serve as a replacement for Cox&#x27;s character. Filming for the fifth season began at the end of April 2007, three months earlier than usual. Production began early to avoid a potential writers strike. Three episodes ultimately went unproduced because of the strike, leaving the season with 19 episodes.

Due to low ratings, NBC canceled the series on February 20, 2008, five days after the airing of the season 5 finale. Thompson said, &quot;I sold my soul to get a Season 5, so I didn&#x27;t have a soul left to sell. We fought an uphill battle from day one. We were the little big show that could.&quot; Thompson said that the series did not receive adequate promotion, and Caan later said that some poor episode plots helped contribute to the show&#x27;s downfall.

The series ended with several cliffhangers, including the fate of Delinda Deline&#x27;s unborn baby. In reaction to the cancellation, upset fans sent baby booties and dolls to NBC, demanding a proper ending. Discussions had been held about making a two-hour film to serve as a finale. In the event that a proper resolution should not be possible, Thompson had an alternate plan for Danny McCoy and Delinda Deline to cameo in an episode of &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, carrying their newborn. Due to &quot;Knight Rider&quot; cancellation, however, Danny and Delinda&#x27;s cameo appearance never came to fruition.

==Music==
A soundtrack for the series was released in September 2005.

Various theme songs have been used for the opening credits, depending on where, how, or when the show has aired. In France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and other countries, the theme song is &quot;Let It Ride&quot; by Charlie Clouser and Jon Ingoldsby, while in other countries, such as the United States and Canada, the theme song is &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; by Elvis Presley, off of the album &quot;&quot;.

For American DVD releases, episodes available for viewing on NBC&#x27;s website and reruns shown on the cable network E!, Clouser&#x27;s song is used (with the exception of the pilot episode), most likely because the original clearances for use of the Presley song did not extend to syndication and home video sales.

==Release==
===Broadcast===
&quot;Las Vegas&quot; aired on NBC and premiered on September 22, 2003. It originally aired on Monday nights, but was moved to Friday nights starting on March 3, 2006. NBC had acquired the rights to air &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;, through a contract with the National Football League (NFL). The NFL sought to distance itself from the city of Las Vegas, and a clause in the contract prohibited any mention of the city during &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;. This would include next-night promotion of &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, prompting the change to Fridays.

The third season ended with several cliffhangers, and the season 4 premiere was delayed twice, eventually premiering on October 27, 2006. This was done in order to give &quot;1 vs. 100&quot;, a popular new game show, another Friday night in the timeslot, while providing more time to promote the season premiere of &quot;Las Vegas&quot;.

The series aired its 100th episode on January 11, 2008.

The American channel TNT purchased the rights to air reruns, beginning in 2007. E! later started airing reruns, in 2020. Cozi TV acquired the broadcast rights in 2022.

In Bulgaria, the series was broadcast on NOVA, Fox Crime, Fox (three of which used the 1st dub, but for different reasons on reruns it has been replaced by a new dub), and is currently airing on bTV, which uses the 2nd dub done by Studio VMS, and in Italy it previously aired on Fox and Rai 2.

===Home media===
All five seasons were released on DVD. The DVDs include extra scenes that were too sexual for network television. These scenes were shot specifically for the DVDs, as Thompson said that extra features helped DVD sales. As of early 2008, the series had sold 500,000 DVD copies in North America, with four seasons available at the time.

===Online media===
The series is available to stream on both Amazon Prime Video and Peacock.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Alessandra Stanley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the pilot episode. She was critical of Caan&#x27;s acting, but wrote that the show &quot;manages to be slick, fast-paced and engaging&quot;, concluding that it &quot;leaves enough mysteries open to keep viewers coming back for another look&quot;. Robert Lloyd of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described Caan as the show&#x27;s only &quot;sign of real life&quot;, finding the other actors to be attractive but otherwise lacking: &quot;They are not so much characters—not yet, anyway—as extensions of their clothes, or cleavage. You don&#x27;t relate to them so much as simply stare.&quot; Lloyd considered the production values to be &quot;extremely high&quot; and wrote, &quot;This may be trash, but it comes in an attractive can.&quot;

Phil Gallo of &quot;Variety&quot; called the series a guilty pleasure and described the tone as &quot;light and unforced&quot;, thanks to the actors and &quot;some sharp editing&quot;. Reviewing the first season, DVD Talk described &quot;Las Vegas&quot; as a &quot;fast-paced, slick, and attractive television series that rarely takes itself too seriously and never fails to entertain.&quot;

In a review for the second season, Charlie McCollum of &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;/&quot;Contra Costa Times&quot; called &quot;Las Vegas&quot; a guilty pleasure and wrote, &quot;Flashy, often trashy and slickly produced, the drama may be fluff, but it&#x27;s good, sexy fluff with James Caan on hand to provide a bit of gravitas.&quot;

===Television ratings===
Originally, &quot;Las Vegas&quot; was not expected to succeed. However, it proved to be a ratings success in its first season, despite competition from &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Skin&quot;, and &quot;My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance&quot;. Ratings dropped after the series moved to Friday nights in 2006, with episodes averaging less than 9 million viewers. Caan said that the move to Fridays was &quot;like a death sentence.&quot;

As of early 2008, the series aired in multiple countries. It was popular among viewers in Australia, France, and Spain, but received limited viewership in Germany.

Below is a table of &quot;Las Vegas&quot; seasonal rankings in the U.S. television market, based on average total viewers per episode. Each U.S. network television season starts in September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.
==Other media==
&quot;Las Vegas&quot; had several crossover episodes with the NBC series &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;, starting in the second season. A total of eight crossover episodes were produced between the two shows.

The Montecito has appeared in several other shows — &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Monk&quot;, and &quot;Passions&quot; — when characters from those shows visited Las Vegas. Of these, only the daytime soap &quot;Passions&quot; included &quot;Las Vegas&quot; characters in cameo roles: Nikki Cox appeared as Mary Connell.

The &quot;Las Vegas&quot; episode &quot;The Story of Owe&quot; mentions a Dunder-Mifflin convention, obliquely linking to &quot;The Office&quot;.

In the episodes &quot;Father of the Bride Redux&quot; and &quot;Died in Plain Sight&quot;, when Ed Deline travels to Morocco to find and relocate a former CIA asset, the false passport he uses is in the name of Alan Bourdillion Traherne. This is the name of the character he played in the 1966 film &quot;El Dorado&quot;.

The &quot;Las Vegas&quot; tie-in novel &quot;High Stakes Game&quot;, by Jeff Mariotte, tells the tale of what could have occurred between the season-two finale and the season-three premiere when the casino was destroyed and rebuilt and the characters briefly went their separate ways. A second novel called &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot;, also by Mariotte, was launched in 2007.

<doc id="322147" wikidata="Q189267" url="?curid=322147" title="Two and a Half Men">
<text>Two and a Half Men is an American television sitcom created by Chuck Lorre and Lee Aronsohn that aired on CBS from September 22, 2003, to February 19, 2015, for 12 seasons and 262 episodes. The show originally starred Charlie Sheen in the lead role alongside Jon Cryer and Angus T. Jones and Marin Hinkle, Melanie Lynskey, and Holland Taylor in supporting roles. The series was about a hedonistic jingle writer, Charlie Harper, his uptight brother, Alan, and Alan&#x27;s mischievous son, Jake. As Alan&#x27;s marriage falls apart and divorce appears imminent, he and Jake move into Charlie&#x27;s beachfront Malibu house and complicate Charlie&#x27;s freewheeling life. In later seasons, Conchata Ferrell, April Bowlby, and Jennifer Taylor were promoted to main cast roles.

In mid-2010, CBS and Warner Bros. Television reached a multiyear broadcasting agreement for the series, renewing it through at least the 2011–12 season. In February 2011, however, CBS and Warner Bros. Television decided to end production for the rest of the eighth season after Sheen entered drug rehabilitation and made &quot;disparaging&quot; comments about the series&#x27; creator and executive producer Chuck Lorre. Sheen&#x27;s contract was terminated the following month and he was written out of the show after it was confirmed that he would not be returning to the series. Ashton Kutcher was hired to replace him for the ninth season as Walden Schmidt, a billionaire who buys Charlie&#x27;s house after his death. Cryer was promoted to the series lead, and Amber Tamblyn and Edan Alexander joined the main cast in season 11 and 12, respectively.

In April 2013, CBS renewed the series for an eleventh season after closing one-year deals with Kutcher and Cryer. Jones, who was attending college, was relegated to recurring status but did not make an appearance until the series finale. In March 2014, CBS renewed the series for a twelfth season, which was later announced to be the series&#x27; last. The season began airing in October 2014 and concluded in February 2015 with the 40-minute series finale &quot;Of Course He&#x27;s Dead&quot;. The success of the series led to it being the third-highest revenue-generating program for 2012, earning $3.24 million an episode.

During its run, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. While the first eight seasons of the show received a generally positive reception, with Sheen and Cryer&#x27;s chemistry being highlighted, the later seasons without Sheen were generally received negatively, although Kutcher&#x27;s performance was praised.

== Overview ==

The series revolved initially around the lives of the Harper brothers, Charlie (Charlie Sheen) and Alan (Jon Cryer), and Alan&#x27;s son Jake (Angus T. Jones). Charlie is a bachelor who writes commercial jingles for a living, while leading a hedonistic lifestyle. When Alan&#x27;s wife, Judith (Marin Hinkle), decides to divorce him, he moves into Charlie&#x27;s Malibu beach house, with Jake coming to stay over the weekends. Charlie&#x27;s housekeeper is Berta (Conchata Ferrell), a sardonic woman who initially resents the change to the household, but eventually accepts it. Charlie&#x27;s one-night stand Rose (Melanie Lynskey) was first introduced as his stalker in the pilot episode.

The first five seasons find Charlie in casual sexual misadventures with numerous women until the sixth season, when he becomes engaged to Chelsea (Jennifer Taylor), but the relationship does not last, as Chelsea breaks off their engagement. Afterwards, Charlie flies to Paris with his stalker Rose in the show&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; eighth-season finale. However, in the ninth-season premiere, Charlie is said to have died after he was struck by a Paris subway train. Rose hints that she threw Charlie into the train&#x27;s path after learning that he had cheated on her.

Alan&#x27;s attitude and experiences are contrasted with Charlie&#x27;s. Throughout the series, Alan deals with his son Jake&#x27;s growing up and the aftermath of his bitter divorce, while having little success with women. His marriage to Kandi (April Bowlby) at the end of the third season was short-lived. In the fourth season, Alan is back at the beach house paying alimony to two women out of his low earnings as a chiropractor. In the seventh season, he begins a relationship with Lyndsey McElroy (Courtney Thorne-Smith), the mother of one of Jake&#x27;s friends. Their relationship is temporarily suspended when Alan cheats on her and accidentally burns down her house, but the relationship is eventually resumed.

In the ninth-season premiere (after Charlie&#x27;s death), the beach house is sold to Walden Schmidt (Ashton Kutcher), an Internet billionaire going through a divorce from Bridget (Judy Greer). Alan leaves to live with his mother Evelyn (Holland Taylor) when the house is sold, but later Walden invites both Alan and Jake back to live in the beach house.

At the end of the ninth season, Jake joins the US Army; he appears occasionally during season 10, briefly dating Tammy (Jaime Pressly), who is 17 years his senior and has three kids, as well as Tammy&#x27;s daughter Ashley (Emily Osment). In the 10th season, Walden proposes to his English girlfriend Zoey (Sophie Winkleman), only to be turned down and discover she has another man. He becomes depressed. Meanwhile, Alan gets engaged to his girlfriend Lyndsey, while Judith leaves her second husband Herb Melnick (Ryan Stiles) (to whom she had been married since the fourth season) after he cheats on her with his receptionist (they later reconcile). Alan and Lyndsey&#x27;s relationship of three years ends as she wants to move on. Rose returns and briefly dates Walden, later stalking him as she did to Charlie. Walden begins to date a poor but ambitious woman named Kate (Brooke D&#x27;Orsay) and changes his name to &quot;Sam Wilson&quot;, pretending to be poor to find someone who wants him for him, not for his money. They later break up when he reveals who he really is, though Kate realizes that Walden&#x27;s money helped her become a successful clothing designer. Jake announces he is being shipped to Japan for at least a year, so he and Alan go on a father-son bonding trip. Other than a cameo in the series finale, this is the last time Jake appears on the show, though verbal references are made to him.

In the 11th season, a young woman arrives at the beach house, announcing that she is Charlie Harper&#x27;s biological daughter, Jenny (Amber Tamblyn). She moves in with Walden and Alan, and later displays many of Charlie&#x27;s traits, including a love of women and alcohol. Lyndsey begins dating a man named Larry (D. B. Sweeney). In an attempt to learn more about Larry, Alan takes on the pseudonym &quot;Jeff Strongman&quot;. His double-life becomes complicated when &quot;Jeff&quot; begins dating Larry&#x27;s sister, Gretchen (Kimberly Williams-Paisley).

In the 12th season, after a health scare, Walden decides to reprioritize his life by adopting a baby. He realizes that the only way to do this is to be married, but does not know anyone who will marry him. He asks Alan to marry him and pretend that they are a gay couple, thus ensuring success at adopting. Jenny moves out of the house, and moves in with Evelyn, due to Walden and Alan&#x27;s preparing to adopt. They adopt a child, Louis (Edan Alexander), and subsequently divorce to pursue relationships with women. Alan proposes to Lyndsey a second time and she accepts, while Walden begins a relationship with Louis&#x27; social worker, Ms. McMartin (Maggie Lawson). Charlie is revealed to be alive, having been kept prisoner by Rose until escaping, but he is killed before he can reunite with Walden and Alan.

=== Sheen&#x27;s dismissal and replacement ===
Following a February 2010 announcement that Sheen was entering drug rehabilitation, filming of the show was put on hiatus, but resumed the following month. On April 1, 2010, &quot;People&quot; reported that after seven seasons, Sheen announced he was considering leaving the show. According to one source, Sheen quit the show after filming the final episode of season seven, purportedly due to his rejection of CBS&#x27;s offer of $1 million per episode as too low. Sheen eventually stated that he would be back for two more seasons. On May 18, 2010, the New Zealand website Stuff.co.nz reported that a press release issued by Sheen&#x27;s publicist confirmed that Sheen had signed a new contract for two years at $1.78 million per episode. &quot;To put a fitting end on the two and one-half months of whirlwind speculation, I&#x27;m looking forward to returning to my CBS home on Monday nights,&quot; Sheen was quoted as saying.

On January 28, 2011, Sheen voluntarily entered a rehabilitation center for the third time in 12 months. According to Warner Bros. Television and CBS, the show was put on hiatus for an indefinite period of time.

The following month, after Sheen&#x27;s verbal denunciations of Chuck Lorre in a radio interview with Alex Jones and an online interview with TMZ.com, CBS announced that &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; would cease production for the rest of its eighth season. This affected an estimated 200 employees, and caused Warner Bros. Television, CBS, Lorre, Sheen and other profit participants an estimated $10 million loss from the unmade eight remaining episodes. Afterward, Sheen was interviewed on ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot;, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; and CNN&#x27;s &quot;Piers Morgan Tonight&quot;, where he continued to criticize Lorre and CBS. On March 7, CBS and Warner Bros. Television jointly announced that they had terminated Sheen&#x27;s &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; contract, citing &quot;moral turpitude&quot; as a main cause of separation. No further decisions about the show&#x27;s future were released.

Cast members Marin Hinkle and Holland Taylor expressed sadness at Sheen&#x27;s departure and personal problems. Jon Cryer did not publicly comment on the matter. In response, Sheen called him &quot;a turncoat, a traitor, [and] a troll&quot; in an E! Online interview, although he later issued a &quot;half-apology&quot; to Cryer for the remarks. Sheen sued Lorre and Warner Bros. Television for $100 million, saying that he had filed the lawsuit on behalf of himself and &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;&#x27;s cast and crew; however, only Sheen was named as a plaintiff in court documents.

In April 2011, Sheen mentioned during a radio interview during his tour&#x27;s stop in Boston that CBS and he were discussing a possible return to the show. Lorre announced the same month that he had developed an idea for a revival of &quot;Two and a Half Men,&quot; excluding Sheen, with Cryer in a key role alongside a new character. Hugh Grant was approached to replace Sheen but he declined. On May 13, CBS announced Ashton Kutcher would join the cast. Kutcher stated, &quot;I can&#x27;t replace Charlie Sheen, but I&#x27;m going to work my ass off to entertain the hell out of people!&quot;

On August 2, 2011, it was reported that the season nine premiere would begin with Sheen&#x27;s character killed off and his ex-girlfriends attending his funeral. Afterward, Charlie&#x27;s Malibu home would be put up for sale; interested buyers would include celebrities from Lorre&#x27;s other sitcoms and John Stamos, as well as Kutcher&#x27;s character, Walden Schmidt, &quot;an Internet billionaire with a broken heart.&quot; Reviewers compared the situation to what happened in 1987 to Valerie Harper, who was fired from the sitcom &quot;Valerie&quot; (later titled &quot;Valerie&#x27;s Family: The Hogans&quot; and then &quot;The Hogan Family&quot;). Her character was killed off-screen and she was replaced the following season.

Sheen said he would watch his &quot;fake funeral attended by [his] fake ex-girlfriends, from [his] very, very real movie theater, with [his] very real hotties in tow.&quot; His response to the season-nine premiere was very positive. He reportedly felt Charlie Harper&#x27;s funeral was &quot;eerie but fun&quot;, and that the introduction of Kutcher&#x27;s character in a cloud of his own character&#x27;s ashes was particularly enjoyable.

The attention &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; received due to the change in characters gave the series a boost. Average total viewers during the 2011–2012 season rose 13% to 15 million and the 5.2 rating in the 18–49 demographic rose by 27%. Kutcher&#x27;s debut as Walden Schmidt, in the episode &quot;Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt&quot;, was seen by 28.7 million people on September 19, 2011. The Nielsen company reported it the highest-rated episode since the series began. At the 2012 Emmys, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; was nominated for four awards and won three, the most Emmys it had won in a single year since it began. In 2012, Kutcher replaced Sheen as the highest-paid U.S. actor currently on the air, receiving $700,000 per episode. For Kutcher&#x27;s second season, the show moved to the 8:30 pm Thursday time slot, replacing &quot;Rules of Engagement.&quot; &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; improved ratings for the time slot, which were up from the previous year. Jennifer Graham Kizer of &quot;IVillage&quot; thought that the series changed tone in its Kutcher era, saying it felt &quot;less evil&quot;. Lorre, Cryer, Hinkle, Taylor, Ferrell and Lynskey had nothing but praise for Kutcher, believing he had &quot;saved the show&quot;.

Kutcher was the highest-paid actor on television for four years according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, earning an estimated $24 million between June 2012 and June 2013, $750,000 per episode. Cryer was the second-highest-paid star on American television, earning $600,000–700,000 per episode.

In 2021, Sheen expressed regret for his past behavior, saying &quot;There [were] 55 different ways for me to handle that situation and I chose number 56.&quot;

=== Jones&#x27; departure ===
In a November 2012 interview with a Christian website, Angus T. Jones (Jake) said he had recently converted to Christianity and joined a Seventh-day Adventist church. He attacked the show as &quot;filth that contradicts his moral values&quot; and said that he was &quot;sick of being a part of it&quot;. He also begged fans to stop watching the show. Producers explained that Jones was not expected back on the set until 2013, because his character was not scheduled to appear in the final two episodes before the winter hiatus. In response to the controversy, Sheen issued a public statement in which he blamed Chuck Lorre for the outburst and claimed that &quot;Jones&#x27; outburst isn&#x27;t an isolated incident but rather a symptom of the toxic environment surrounding the show.&quot; The following day, Jones issued a public apology for his remarks and explained that he &quot;cannot address everything that has been said or right every misstatement or misunderstanding.&quot; Jones left the series at the end of the 2012–2013 season and did not appear in season 11 despite initial reports that he would continue in a recurring, rather than a starring, role. The role of youngest family member was filled by Amber Tamblyn, who played Jenny, the long-lost illegitimate daughter of Charlie Harper; and later by Edan Alexander, who played Louis, Walden Schmidt&#x27;s adopted son. On March 18, 2014, Jones officially announced his departure from the show, stating he had been &quot;a paid hypocrite&quot;. Nevertheless, he apologized to Lorre for his actions and appeared in a cameo in the series finale on February 19, 2015.

== Cast and characters ==

=== Main ===
* Charlie Sheen as Charlie Harper (seasons 1–8), a hedonistic bachelor, jingle/children&#x27;s songwriter, Alan&#x27;s elder brother, Jake&#x27;s uncle and Jenny&#x27;s father. Despite his arrogant and rambunctious demeanor, he does possess a kind heart, though he very rarely shows it. He is written out of the series at the beginning of season nine, after being pushed in front of a train and killed offscreen, due to Charlie Sheen being fired from the show. In the episode &quot;Why We Gave Up Women&quot;, Charlie&#x27;s ghost, portrayed by Kathy Bates, visits Alan and is forced to spend eternity in hell as a woman with a pair of testicles. He has a daughter named Jenny, whose existence he never disclosed to his family. In season 11, she resurfaces as an adult, but has no idea he had died. The series finale abandons the idea that Charlie is deceased by revealing that Rose faked his death and held him prisoner in a pit for four years. Brainwashed into a violent psychopath, he escapes and portends his imminent arrival by sending threats to Alan, Evelyn and Walden, as well as generous checks to Jake, Berta, Jenny and his ex-girlfriends, but a helicopter drops a grand piano on him and kills him just before he enters the beach house.
* Jon Cryer as Alan Harper, Charlie&#x27;s younger brother, a struggling chiropractor, Jake&#x27;s twice-divorced father, Walden&#x27;s best friend and Jenny&#x27;s uncle. Alan is intelligent, a graduate of Cal State Long Beach but continually stricken with bad luck due to poor choices and mistakes, which are due to a lifetime of suffering from Charlie&#x27;s abuse and Evelyn&#x27;s neglect, as well as favoring Charlie over him. Due to a lack in income (partly the result of Charlie&#x27;s sabotaging Alan&#x27;s divorce-settlement by jilting Alan&#x27;s lawyer in the episode &quot;No Sniffing, No Wowing&quot;), Alan is forced to sponge off people throughout his life, but he genuinely cares about others despite this. His poverty ultimately led to the demise of his business. In the 12th and final season, Alan agrees to &quot;marry&quot; Walden for the latter to adopt a child and for months, the two pretend to be a gay couple. In the series&#x27; penultimate episode, Walden and Alan end the marriage as Walden had successfully adopted a six-year-old named Louis. Alan finally proposes to Lyndsey and agrees to marry her (as well as move out) in the final episodes. Cryer is the only cast member who appears in all 262 episodes of the series.
* Angus T. Jones as Jake Harper (seasons 1–10; guest, season 12), the slacker son of Alan and Judith and older half-brother (or brother, if Alan&#x27;s paternity claim is to be believed) of Milly and cousin of Jenny. In season one, episode 17 (&quot;Ate the Hamburgers, Wearing the Hats&quot;), his real name is revealed to actually be Jacob. As he grows older, he changes from a rather bright (but gullible), independent child into a dimwitted buffoon (who is nevertheless good at blackmailing Charlie and Alan). He eventually enlists in the U.S. Army working as a chef. At the end of season 10, he announces that he is going to Japan for a year. Despite his absence, he is mentioned often in seasons 11 and 12 and makes an uncredited cameo via archive footage in season 12, as well as returning briefly in person in the series finale.
* Ashton Kutcher as Walden Schmidt (seasons 9–12), Alan&#x27;s best friend, roommate and ephemeral husband. A friendly, hopelessly romantic internet tycoon, he is a billionaire despite being somewhat immature and naïve for most of his life. He purchases the Harper beach house after Charlie&#x27;s death. During his time in the household, he grows into a responsible adult and forms close friendships with Jake, Herb, Berta, Judith, Evelyn and Jenny. He also serves as a surrogate uncle figure to Jake, in place of Charlie. In season 12, he and Alan adopt a six-year-old boy named Louis.
* Holland Taylor as Evelyn Harper (seasons 1–9; recurring, seasons 10–12), Charlie and Alan&#x27;s vain mother and the grandmother of Jake and Jenny. A high-powered Los Angeles broker/realtor, she is bisexual.
* Marin Hinkle as Judith Harper-Melnick (seasons 1–9; recurring, seasons 10–12), Alan&#x27;s selfish, mean-spirited ex-wife and Jake and Milly&#x27;s mother. She considers Charlie&#x27;s lifestyle and attitude to be a bad example for Jake and also occasionally has issues with Alan&#x27;s own parenting practices.
* Conchata Ferrell as Berta (seasons 2–12; recurring, season 1), the family&#x27;s outspoken housekeeper and close family friend. She shows great animosity towards Alan and Jake, while she adores Charlie and later, Walden. During the Kutcher years, her role was increased on the show, appearing in more episodes. Season 11 was the first season where she appeared in every episode. The role was originally only intended for a two-episode arc in the first season, in which she would leave as a result of Alan and his son moving in.
* Melanie Lynskey as Rose (seasons 1–2; recurring, seasons 3–12), the Harpers&#x27; strange neighbor and Charlie&#x27;s stalker and friend. Initially, Charlie hated Rose and wanted nothing to do with her, but eventually they became friends and he later fell in love with her. In the ninth-season premiere, Rose claimed that Charlie &quot;slipped&quot; in front of a Paris Métro train after she had caught him cheating on her. She was later seen taking Bridget Schmidt under her wing as an apprentice stalker, but this storyline was eventually aborted. After formally meeting Walden at the local tavern, Rose rushed into a relationship with him and caused her ferrets to attack Walden and Alan when Walden broke up with her. Naturally, she continues to stalk Walden, as well as the Harpers, despite Charlie&#x27;s apparent death. In the finale, she is revealed to have kept Charlie imprisoned in a pit for four years.
* April Bowlby as Kandi (season 4; recurring, season 3; guest, seasons 10 and 12), Charlie&#x27;s dimwitted girlfriend, then later as Alan&#x27;s girlfriend and second wife and also Judith&#x27;s best friend (for one episode). In season 10, after Alan rejects her sexual advances, she has a one-night stand with Alan&#x27;s girlfriend, Lyndsey McElroy.
* Jennifer Taylor as Chelsea (season 7; recurring, season 6; guest, seasons 9 and 12), Charlie&#x27;s girlfriend for most of season six, she has moved into his house by the end of the season. She then becomes Charlie&#x27;s fiancée in season seven. They later end the relationship, which deeply hurt Charlie for a while. She is absent throughout season eight, but makes a brief, speaking cameo at Charlie&#x27;s funeral in season nine. (While credited on-screen among the main cast during the seventh season, CBS press releases billed her as a recurring character.)
* Amber Tamblyn as Jenny (season 11; recurring, season 12), Charlie&#x27;s illegitimate daughter who shares many personality traits with her father, including indulging in alcohol and women. She quickly bonds with Alan and Walden, often flaunting her female lovers in front of them. (While credited on-screen among the main cast during the 12th season, CBS press releases bill her as a recurring character.)
* Edan Alexander as Louis (season 12), a six-year-old boy whom Walden adopts.

== Broadcast ==

=== Episodes ===


Each episode&#x27;s title is a dialogue fragment from the episode itself, usually offering no clue to the episode&#x27;s actual plotline. The show&#x27;s 100th episode (&quot;City of Great Racks&quot;) aired on October 15, 2007. To celebrate this, a casino-inspired party was held at West Hollywood&#x27;s Pacific Design Center. Warner Bros. Television also distributed blue Micargi Rover bicycles adorned with the &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; logo along with the words &quot;100 Episodes&quot;. Each bicycle came with a note saying, &quot;You&#x27;ve made us very proud. Here&#x27;s to a long ride together.&quot; The cast also gave the crew sterling silver key rings from Tiffany &amp; Co. The key rings were attached to small pendants with &quot;100&quot; inscribed on one side and &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; on the other.

Seasons one through four, six and nine consist of 24 episodes. Season five was reduced to 19 episodes due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Due to Sheen&#x27;s personal life problems, season seven had 22 episodes. Season eight premiered on September 20, 2010, at 9:00 pm ET. CBS initially ordered 24 episodes for the season, but again due to Sheen&#x27;s personal life, the show was put on hiatus after 16 episodes were produced, with production scheduled to resume on February 28. After a series of comments made by Sheen on February 24, 2011, CBS and Warner Bros. canceled the remainder of the season.

On May 13, 2011, actor Ashton Kutcher was widely reported to be replacing Charlie Sheen as the lead on the show. The show&#x27;s ninth season premiered on September 19, 2011. The first episode, &quot;Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt&quot;, begins with Charlie Harper&#x27;s funeral and introduces Kutcher as billionaire Walden Schmidt, who buys Harper&#x27;s house. On May 12, 2012, CBS renewed &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; for a 10th season, moving it to Thursday nights at 8:30 pm, following &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. For the 2013–14 season, the show was moved to the Thursday 9:30–10:00 pm Eastern slot. As of February 27, 2014, the series&#x27; time slot was moved to a half-hour earlier at the 9:00–9:30 slot.

=== Syndication and streaming===
&quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; entered local United States broadcast syndication in 2007, with the first four seasons available to local stations (largely CW and Fox Television Stations, LLC affiliates in the major U.S. television markets through major deals with Tribune Broadcasting and the Sinclair Broadcast Group). From September 6, 2010, to November 24, 2017, FX aired the series daily nationwide (Charlie Sheen most recently starred on &quot;Anger Management&quot; on FX from 2012 to 2014). Syndicated shows are sold in multiyear cycles, with the first cycle the most expensive. &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;″s first cycle is nine years in length. If no ninth season had occurred because of Sheen&#x27;s departure, due to the first cycle&#x27;s premature end, Warner Bros. Television would not have received about $80 million in license fees. While local stations would prefer to have as many episodes as possible available to them, an early start to the second cycle would lower the cost of the show for them. The series began airing on Viacom-owned networks Nick at Nite and Spike (now Paramount Network) in December 2017 and on IFC on January 1, 2018. As of July 2, 2018, the series has moved from Nick at Nite to TV Land, switching places with &quot;Mom&quot;.

The show is available in the United States for streaming on Peacock.

== Crossovers and other appearances ==

=== &quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot; ===
In 2007, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; creator Chuck Lorre contacted &quot;&quot; executive producer Carol Mendelsohn about a crossover. At first, the idea seemed unlikely to receive approval; however, it resurfaced when Mendelsohn and Lorre were at the World Television Festival in Canada and they decided to get approval and run with it. When Mendelsohn was giving a talk, she accidentally mentioned the crossover, that same day &quot;Variety&quot; was already inquiring about the crossover episodes. Mendelsohn later stated: &quot;We&#x27;re all used to being in control and in charge of our own shows and even though this was a freelance-type situation ... there was an expectation and also a desire on all of our parts to really have a true collaboration. You have to give a little. It was sort of a life lesson, I think.&quot;

&quot;The biggest challenge for us was doing a comedy with a murder in it. Generally, our stories are a little lighter,&quot; stated Lorre in an interview. &quot;Would our audience go with a dead body in it? There was a moment where it could have gone either way. I think the results were spectacular. It turned out to be a really funny episode.&quot; The &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; episode &quot;Fish in a Drawer&quot; was the first part of the crossover to air, on May 5, 2008, written by &quot;CSI&quot; writers Sarah Goldfinger, Evan Dunsky, Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar. George Eads is the only &quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot; cast member to make a cameo in this episode.

Three days later, the second part of the crossover aired, the &quot;CSI&quot; episode &quot;Two and a Half Deaths&quot;. Gil Grissom (William Petersen) investigated the murder of a sitcom diva named Annabelle (Katey Sagal), who was found murdered while she was filming her show in Las Vegas. The episode was written by &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; creators Lorre and Aronsohn; Sheen, Cryer and Jones all make uncredited cameos in this episode, in the same clothes their characters were wearing in &quot;Fish in a Drawer&quot;.

=== &quot;Due Date&quot; ===
At the end of 2010 film &quot;Due Date&quot;, a scene from &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; is shown, in which Sheen and Cryer appear as their characters, while Ethan Chase (played by Zach Galifianakis in the movie) plays Stu, Jake&#x27;s tutor.

== Reception ==

===Critical reception===
&quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; received mostly mixed reviews from critics throughout its run. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; has described the sitcom as &quot;solid, well-acted and occasionally funny.&quot; Conversely Graeme Blundell, writing for &quot;The Australian&quot;, described it as a &quot;sometimes creepy, misogynistic comedy&quot;. Ashton Kutcher&#x27;s debut was met with mixed reviews, and reviews for season nine were also mixed. One reviewer commented that the show was made for Charlie Sheen&#x27;s character and the way he interacted with other characters, and the setup did not work with Kutcher&#x27;s character. 

However, it has been labeled as &quot;one of America&#x27;s most successful comedy shows.&quot; Ellen Gray of &quot;Daily News&quot; praised the shows&#x27; legacy just before the premiere of the finale. The show is credited as being the reason &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;Mike &amp; Molly&quot; and &quot;Mom&quot; were all made. &quot;Men&quot;″s success was what enabled these other Chuck Lorre shows to be made and be successful.
Following the filming of the final episode, Stage 26 of the Warner Brothers lot was renamed the &quot;Two and a Half Men stage&quot;.
After the finale, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; fans launched a global petition under the name &quot;Yes To &quot;The Harpers&quot;, to have Charlie Sheen reprise the role of Charlie Harper alongside his former co-star Jon Cryer. This idea surfaced after fans saw Chuck Lorre&#x27;s vanity card about Charlie Sheen&#x27;s idea of a spinoff show named &quot;The Harpers&quot;.

The first season received generally positive reviews from critics. 

The ninth season of the show, its first without Sheen, received generally mixed reviews from critics. 

The show&#x27;s final season received generally negative reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 33% of 12 critics&#x27; reviews are positive. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; putters to an unpleasant end that continues to beat the dead Charlie horse while spinning an offensive, homophobic subplot.&quot;

== Potential revival ==
When Sheen appeared on the April 2019 broadcast of &quot;Loose Women&quot;, he expressed interest in a potential revival, hoping to make two more seasons to tie up loose characters ends. In response, Jon Cryer expressed reluctance to return to working with Sheen full time, comparing it to a roller coaster.

<text>In Royal Navy jargon, a man-of-war (also man-o&#x27;-war, or simply man) was a powerful warship or frigate of the 16th to the 19th century, that was frequently used in Europe. Although the term never acquired a specific meaning, it was usually reserved for a sailing ship armed with cannon. The rating system of the Royal Navy classified men-of-war into six &quot;rates&quot;, a &quot;first-rate&quot; having the greatest armament, and a &quot;sixth-rate&quot; the least.

==Description==
The man-of-war was developed in Portugal in the early 15th century from earlier roundships with the addition of a second mast to form the carrack. The 16th century saw the carrack evolve into the galleon and then the ship of the line. The evolution of the term has been given thus:

The man-of-war design developed by Sir John Hawkins was a type of galleon which had three masts, each with three to four sails. The ship could be up to 60 metres long and could have up to 124 guns: four at the bow, eight at the stern, and 56 in each broadside. All these cannons required three gun decks to hold them, one more than any earlier ship. It had a maximum sailing speed of eight or nine knots.

<text>&quot;La campanella&quot; (Italian for &quot;The little bell&quot;) is the subtitle given to the third of Franz Liszt&#x27;s six &quot;Grandes études de Paganini&quot;, S. 141 (1851). It is in the key of G-sharp minor. 

== Background ==
&quot;La campanella&quot; is a revision of an earlier version from 1838, the &quot;Études d&#x27;exécution transcendente d&#x27;après Paganini&quot;, S. 140. Its melody comes from the final movement of Niccolò Paganini&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 2 in B minor, where the tune was reinforced by a &quot;little handbell.&quot; This is illustrated by the large intervals of sixteenth notes in the right hand.

== Music ==

::Incipit for &quot;La campanella&quot; by Franz Liszt (&quot;Grandes études de Paganini&quot; S. 141 no. 3)

The étude is played at a gentle, brisk &quot;allegretto&quot; tempo and features constant octave hand jumps between intervals larger than one octave, sometimes even stretching for two whole octaves within the time of a sixteenth note. As a whole, the étude can be practiced to increase dexterity and accuracy at large jumps on the piano, along with agility of the weaker fingers of the hand and muscles within the forearm and wrist. The largest intervals reached by the right hand are fifteenths (two octaves) and sixteenths (two octaves and a second). Sixteenth notes are played between the two notes, and the same note is played two octaves or two octaves and a second higher with little (depending on the arrangement) no rest. Little time is provided for the pianist to move the hand, thus forcing the pianist to avoid tension within the muscles. Fifteenth intervals are quite common in the beginning of the étude, while the sixteenth intervals appear twice, at the first thirtieth and thirty-second measures.
However, the left hand studies about four extremely large intervals, larger than those in the right hand. For example, in bar 101, the left hand makes a sixteenth-note jump of just a half-step below three octaves. The étude also involves other technical difficulties, e.g. trills with the fourth and fifth fingers starting on measure 80 and lasting for 4 bars, and fast chromatic scales starting on measure 73.

== Arrangements ==
The work of Franz Liszt has been arranged by other composers and pianists, most notably Ferruccio Busoni and Marc-André Hamelin.

== Derivative works ==
In September 2022, &quot;La Campanella&quot; was sampled as part of the instrumental for the song &quot;Shut Down&quot; by South Korean girl group Blackpink.
The song is in the key of B-flat minor.

<doc id="322155" wikidata="Q1404206" url="?curid=322155" title="Paul van Buitenen">
<text>Paul van Buitenen (; born 28 May 1957) is a retired Dutch politician of the Europe Transparent Party who served as a Member of the European Parliament from 2004 to 2009.

He was an assistant-auditor in the European Commission&#x27;s Financial Control Directorate becoming the whistleblower who first drew the attention of a Member of the European Parliament to the irregularities, fraud and mismanagement within the Commission in 1998. In May 2005, he also asked the European Commission to create an investigation, after learning that Frits Bolkestein (author of the Directive on services in the internal market) was a member of the Russian Bank Menatep&#x27;s international consultative council (owned by Mikhail Khodorkovsky) and that he had worked for the Shell British-Dutch petrol company, two firms &quot;detaining secret accounts in Clearstream&quot;.

== 1998 whistleblowing ==
His whistleblowing on 9 December 1998 indirectly led to the resignation of the Commission presided by Jacques Santer (who has also been prime minister of Luxembourg) and the fall of Édith Cresson. For this, he was suspended, had his salary halved and ordered to face disciplinary action. He fought on and the combination of his exposures with the public indignation of his treatment by the Commission triggered the collapse of Jacques Santer&#x27;s Commission, of which Édith Cresson was particularly criticised.

Eventually he was – at least partially – forgiven and returned to the organisation, albeit in a different capacity.
Nevertheless, he would later leave on &#x27;unpaid leave&#x27; in order to pursue a political career.

He has been named &#x27;European of the Year&#x27; by Reader&#x27;s Digest magazine
and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He donated his prize money to a fund in the Netherlands for helping other whistleblowers and in 1999 he wrote a book which reveals the whole story – followed by a sequel in 2004. The second book only came out in Dutch and German. An English version risked causing trouble with Commissioner Neil Kinnock.

== 2006 whistleblowing ==
On 26 April 2006, daily &quot;20 Minutes&quot; revealed that &quot;in May 2005, MEP Paul van Buitenen was shocked by Frits Bolkestein&#x27;s presence to Menatep&#x27;s international consultative council, a sulfurous Russian banking establishment, and by his work for Shell, British-Dutch petrol company. Two firms &#x27;detaining secret accounts in Clearstream&#x27; ... van Buitenen, also Dutch, then asked for &#x27;clarification&#x27; to the European Commission and the opening of a parliamentary investigation. The Commission&#x27;s president, José Manuel Barroso, answered that these facts &quot;don&#x27;t bring up any new question&quot; and that it is not known &quot;if Menatep took contact with Bolkestein while he was in his functions&quot;. No investigation thereby took place.&quot; The free daily underlines that &quot;in 2001, it was Bolkestein himself that announced the Commission&#x27;s refusal to open up a parliamentary investigation on Clearstream&quot;, following Harlem Désir&#x27;s requests and accusations that Menatep had an &quot;undeclared account&quot; at Clearstream. Bolkestein refused to answer any questions by the newspaper.

== 2008 whistleblowing ==
On 5 March 2008, Paul van Buitenen published on his website a summary of a confidential internal report dealing with abuse of the EU expenses and staff allowance system.

== Transparency and current functions ==

Pledging to continue the fight against fraud and bureaucratic inefficiency on the European level, Van Buitenen founded a party named Europe Transparent, ran with it for the European Parliament in the 2004 elections (in the Netherlands) and won two seats for his party. Van Buitenen joined the Greens-EFA group in the European Parliament as an independent member.

His functions in the European Parliament were
*Member of the Committee on Budgetary Control,
*Substitute for the Committee on Petitions and
*Substitute for the Delegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland and Norway and to the European Economic Area (EEA) Joint Parliamentary Committee.

In 2007, he submitted a parliamentary question, along with Hannu Takkula (ALDE) and Paulo Casaca (PSE), accusing Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of incitement to genocide (based on statements that the &quot;Regime [Israel] that is occupying Qods [Jerusalem] must be eliminated from the pages of history&quot;) and urging the European Commission to take action.

On 29 January 2008 Van Buitenen announced that his party Europe Transparent was to be dissolved and that he personally intended to join the ChristianUnion.

After the European elections of June 2009 Van Buitenen returned to the European Commission, this time in DG RTD, at a stone&#x27;s throw from the European Parliament. He checked for possible irregularities in Framework 7 contracts, under acting Head of Unit Peter Baader, a former OLAF official.

Van Buitenen has retired as an EU official in mid-2011.

== Quotes ==
* &quot;The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has had success in combating external corruption in the member states, but it is in the internal cases where it has found problems. Working with the EU authorities makes it very difficult to proceed in an investigation ... OLAF&#x27;s independence exists only on paper ... Every time the committee is approached about corruption, it promises to improve the situation. But then a new case arises... We must decide if we are to continue with the European arrangement. If we do, then we must also create these democratic structures at European level. Otherwise we should revert to allowing the national authorities and parliaments to take over the controlling functions again. But at the moment, as it stands, everything goes wrong... Things have got even worse. There is now a regulation which supposedly protects so-called whistleblowers which makes officials believe that they can uncover scandals. But in reality, if one does this, they are destroyed. So the regulation does not work.&quot;&quot;(Deutsche Welle, 2 April 2007)&quot;

<doc id="322159" wikidata="Q317499" url="?curid=322159" title="Prince George of Denmark">
<text>Prince George of Denmark and Norway, Duke of Cumberland (; 2 April 165328 October 1708), was the husband of Anne, Queen of Great Britain. He was the consort of the British monarch from Anne&#x27;s accession on 8 March 1702 until his death in 1708.

The marriage of George and Anne was arranged in the early 1680s with a view to developing an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain Dutch maritime power. As a result, George was disliked by his Dutch brother-in-law, William III, Prince of Orange, who was married to Anne&#x27;s elder sister, Mary. Anne and Mary&#x27;s father, the British ruler James II and VII, was deposed in the Glorious Revolution in 1688, and William and Mary succeeded him as joint monarchs with Anne as heir presumptive. The new monarchs granted George the title of Duke of Cumberland.

William excluded George from active military service, and neither George nor Anne wielded any great influence until after the deaths of Mary and then William, at which point Anne became queen. During his wife&#x27;s reign, George occasionally used his influence in support of his wife, even when privately disagreeing with her views. He had an easy-going manner and little interest in politics; his appointment as Lord High Admiral of England in 1702 was largely honorary.

Anne&#x27;s seventeen pregnancies by George resulted in twelve miscarriages or stillbirths, four infant deaths, and a chronically ill son, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, who died at the age of eleven. Despite the deaths of their children, George and Anne&#x27;s marriage was a strong one. George died aged 55 from a recurring and chronic lung disease, much to the devastation of his wife, and he was buried in Westminster Abbey.

==Early life==
George was born in Copenhagen Castle, and was the younger son of Frederick III, King of Denmark and of Norway, and Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg. His mother was the sister of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, later Elector of Hanover. From 1661, his governor was Otto Grote, later Hanoverian minister to Denmark. Grote was &quot;more courtier and statesman than educator&quot; and when he left for the Hanoverian court in 1665, he was replaced by the more effective Christen Lodberg. George received military training, and undertook a Grand Tour of Europe, spending eight months in 1668–69 in France and mid-1669 in England. His father died in 1670, while George was in Italy, and George&#x27;s elder brother, Christian V, inherited the Danish throne. George returned home through Germany. He travelled through Germany again in 1672–73, to visit two of his sisters, Anna Sophia and Wilhelmine Ernestine, who were married to the electoral princes of Saxony and the Palatinate.

In 1674, George was a candidate for the Polish elective throne, for which he was backed by King Louis XIV of France. George&#x27;s staunch Lutheranism was a barrier to election in Roman Catholic Poland, and John Sobieski was chosen instead. In 1677, George served with distinction with his elder brother Christian in the Scanian War against Sweden.

As a Protestant, George was considered a suitable partner for the niece of King Charles II of England, Lady Anne. They were distantly related (second cousins once removed; they were both descended from King Frederick II of Denmark), and had never met. George was hosted by Charles II in London in 1669, but Anne had been in France at the time of George&#x27;s visit. Both Denmark and Britain were Protestant, and Louis XIV was keen on an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain the power of the Dutch Republic. Anne&#x27;s uncle Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester, and the English Secretary of State for the Northern Department, Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland, negotiated a marriage treaty with the Danes in secret, to prevent the plans leaking to the Dutch. Anne&#x27;s father, James, Duke of York, welcomed the marriage because it diminished the influence of his other son-in-law, Dutch Stadtholder William III of Orange, who was naturally unhappy with the match.

==Marriage==

George and Anne were married on 28 July 1683 in the Chapel Royal at St James&#x27;s Palace, London, by Henry Compton, Bishop of London. The guests included King Charles II, Queen Catherine, and the Duke and Duchess of York. Anne was voted a parliamentary allowance of £20,000 a year, while George received £10,000 a year from his Danish estates, although payments from Denmark were often late or incomplete. King Charles gave them a set of buildings in the Palace of Whitehall known as the Cockpit (near the site of what is now Downing Street in Westminster) as their London residence.

George was not ambitious, and hoped to live a quiet life of domesticity with his wife. He wrote to a friend:

Within months of the marriage, Anne was pregnant but the baby, a girl, was stillborn in May. Anne recovered at the spa town of Tunbridge Wells, and over the next two years, she gave birth to two daughters in quick succession, Mary and Anne Sophia. In early 1687, within a matter of days, George and his two young daughters caught smallpox, and Anne suffered another miscarriage. George recovered, but both his daughters died. Lady Rachel Russell wrote that George and Anne had &quot;taken [the deaths] very heavily. The first relief of that sorrow proceeded from the threatening of a greater, the Prince being so ill of a fever. I never heard any relation more moving than that of seeing them together. Sometimes they wept, sometimes they mourned in words; then sat silent, hand in hand; he sick in bed, and she the carefullest nurse to him that can be imagined.&quot; He returned to Denmark for a two-month visit in mid-1687, while Anne remained in England. Later that year, after his return, Anne gave birth to another dead child, this time a son.

In February 1685, King Charles II died without legitimate issue, and George&#x27;s father-in-law, the Roman Catholic Duke of York, became king as James II in England and Ireland and James VII in Scotland. George was appointed to the Privy Council and invited to attend Cabinet meetings, although he had no power to alter or affect decisions. William of Orange refused to attend James&#x27;s coronation largely because George would take precedence over him. Although they were both sons-in-law of King James, George was also the son and brother of a king and so outranked William, who was an elected stadtholder of a republic.

Anne&#x27;s older sister Mary had moved to the Netherlands after her marriage to William of Orange. Protestant opposition to James was therefore increasingly focused around Anne and George instead of Mary, who was heir presumptive. The social and political grouping centred on George and Anne was known as the &quot;Cockpit Circle&quot; after their London residence. On 5 November 1688, William invaded England in an action, known as the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot;, which ultimately deposed King James. George was forewarned by the Danish envoy in London, Frederick Gersdorff, that William was assembling an invasion fleet. George informed Gersdorff that James&#x27;s army was disaffected, and as a result he would refuse any command under James, but only serve as an uncommissioned volunteer. Gersdorff&#x27;s alternative plan to evacuate George and Anne to Denmark was rejected by George. George accompanied the King&#x27;s troops to Salisbury in mid-November, but other nobles and their soldiers soon deserted James for William. At each defection, George apparently exclaimed, (Is it possible?). He abandoned James on 24 November, and sided with William. &quot;So is gone too&quot;, James supposedly remarked. In his memoirs, James dismissed George&#x27;s defection as trivial, saying the loss of one good trooper was of more consequence, but Gersdorff claimed the defection greatly perturbed the King. The defection of George and other nobles was instrumental in whittling away the King&#x27;s support. In December, James fled to France, and early the following year William and Mary were declared joint monarchs, with Anne as heir presumptive.

==Duke of Cumberland==

In early April 1689, William assented to a bill naturalizing George as an English subject, the (1 Will. &amp; Mar. c. &quot;3&quot;) and George was created Duke of Cumberland, Earl of Kendal and Baron of Okingham (Wokingham) by the new monarchs. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 20 April 1689, being introduced by the Dukes of Somerset and Ormonde.

The mistrust between George and William was set aside during the revolution of 1688–89 but dogged relations during the latter&#x27;s reign. George held mortgages on Femern, Tremsbüttel and Steinhorst, Schleswig-Holstein, which he surrendered to the Duke of Holstein as part of the peace of Altona of 1689 negotiated by William between Denmark and Sweden. William agreed to pay George interest and the capital in compensation, but George remained unpaid. During the military campaign against James&#x27;s supporters in Ireland, George accompanied the Williamite troops at his own expense, but was excluded from command, and was even refused permission to travel in his brother-in-law&#x27;s coach. Snubbed from the army by William, George sought to join the navy, without rank, but was again thwarted by his brother-in-law. When William&#x27;s Dutch guards failed to salute George, Anne assumed they were acting under orders. George and Anne retired from court. Some degree of reconciliation was achieved following Queen Mary&#x27;s sudden and unexpected death from smallpox in 1694, which made Anne heiress apparent. In November 1699, William finally recommended that Parliament pay the mortgage debt to George and, in early 1700, the debt was honoured.

By 1700, Anne had been pregnant at least seventeen times; twelve times, she miscarried or gave birth to stillborn children, and two of their five children born alive died within a day. The only one of the couple&#x27;s children to survive infancy—Prince William, Duke of Gloucester—died in July 1700 at the age of 11. With Gloucester&#x27;s death, Anne was the only person in the line of succession to the throne, as established by the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot;. To extend the line and secure the Protestant succession, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which designated William and Anne&#x27;s nearest Protestant cousins, the House of Hanover, as the next in line after Anne.

George did not play a senior role in government until his wife Anne succeeded as queen on William&#x27;s death in 1702. George was the chief mourner at William&#x27;s funeral. Anne appointed him generalissimo of all English military forces on 17 April, and Lord High Admiral, the official but nominal head of the Royal Navy, on 20 May. Actual power at the Admiralty was held by George Churchill, whose elder brother was John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, a great friend of Anne&#x27;s and the captain-general of English land forces. Prince George had known the Churchills for years: another brother Charles Churchill, had been one of his gentlemen of the bedchamber in Denmark, and Marlborough had accompanied George on his journey from Denmark to England for his marriage to Anne in 1683. George&#x27;s secretary in the 1680s was Colonel Edward Griffith, brother-in-law of the Duchess of Marlborough, who was Anne&#x27;s close confidante and friend. George followed William III as Captain-General of the Honourable Artillery Company, and was made Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Anne failed, however, in her attempts to persuade the States General of the Netherlands to elect her husband captain-general of all Dutch forces, to maintain the unified command of the Maritime Powers that William had held.

Anne obtained a parliamentary allowance of £100,000 a year for George in the event of her death. The bill sped through the House of Commons easily but it was only narrowly passed by the House of Lords. Marlborough supported the bill, but one of the lords against was Marlborough&#x27;s son-in-law, Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland. Marlborough dissuaded her from asking Parliament to make &quot;her dearly loved husband King Consort&quot;.

Generally, during her reign, Anne and George spent the winter at Kensington and St James&#x27;s Palaces, and the summer at Windsor Castle or Hampton Court Palace, where the air was fresher. George had recurrent asthma, and the cleaner air in the country was better for his breathing. They visited the spa town of Bath, Somerset, in mid-1702, on the advice of George&#x27;s doctors, and again in mid-1703. They occasionally visited Newmarket, Suffolk, to view the horse racing. On one visit, Anne bought George a horse, Leeds, for the vast sum of a thousand guineas.

At the end of 1702, the Occasional Conformity Bill was introduced to Parliament. The bill aimed to disqualify Protestant Dissenters from public office by closing a loophole in the Test Acts, legislation that restricted public office to Anglican conformists. The existing law permitted nonconformists to take office if they took Anglican communion once a year. Anne was in favour of the measure, and forced George to vote for the bill in the House of Lords, even though, being a practising Lutheran, he was an occasional conformist himself. As he cast his vote, he reportedly told an opponent of the bill, &quot;My heart is vid you&quot; . The bill did not gather sufficient parliamentary support and was eventually dropped. The following year, the bill was revived, but Anne withheld support, fearing its reintroduction was a deliberate pretence to cause a quarrel between the two main political groups: the Tories (who supported the bill) and the Whigs (who opposed it). Once again it failed. George never became a member of the Church of England, which was headed by his wife throughout her reign. He remained Lutheran even after her accession, and had his own personal chapel.

In the first years of Anne&#x27;s reign, the Whigs gained more power and influence at the expense of the Tories. In his capacity as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, George held influence in parliamentary boroughs on the south coast of England, which he used to support Whig candidates in the general election of 1705. In that year&#x27;s election for Speaker of the House of Commons, George and Anne supported a Whig candidate, John Smith. George instructed his secretary, George Clarke, who was a Member of Parliament, to vote for Smith, but Clarke refused, instead supporting the Tory candidate William Bromley. Clarke was sacked, and Smith was elected.

==Illness and death==

In March and April 1706, George was seriously ill. There was blood in his sputum, but he seemed to recover, although he was too ill to attend a thanksgiving service at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in June for a British victory in the Battle of Ramillies. He missed another thanksgiving service in May 1707, to celebrate the union of England and Scotland, as he was recuperating at Hampton Court.

The Scilly naval disaster of 1707, in which a fleet commanded by Sir Cloudesley Shovell foundered, highlighted mismanagement at the Admiralty, for which George was nominally responsible. Pressure grew to replace Admiral Churchill with someone more dynamic. By October 1708, five powerful politicians, known as the Whig Junto—Lords Somers, Halifax, Orford, Wharton and Sunderland—were clamouring for the removal of both Prince George and Churchill. Marlborough wrote to his brother telling him to resign, but Churchill refused, protected by Prince George.

Amid the political pressure, George was on his deathbed, suffering from severe asthma and dropsy. He died at 1:30 p.m. on 28 October 1708 at Kensington Palace. The Queen was devastated. James Brydges wrote to General Cadogan,

His death has flung the Queen into an unspeakable grief. She never left him till he was dead, but continued kissing him the very moment his breath went out of his body, and &#x27;twas with a great deal of difficulty my Lady Marlborough prevailed upon her to leave him.

Anne wrote to her nephew, Frederick IV of Denmark, &quot;the loss of such a husband, who loved me so dearly and so devotedly, is too crushing for me to be able to bear it as I ought.&quot; Anne was desperate to stay at Kensington with the body of her husband, but under pressure from the Duchess of Marlborough, she reluctantly left Kensington for St James&#x27;s Palace. Anne resented the Duchess&#x27;s intrusive actions, which included removing a portrait of George from the Queen&#x27;s bedchamber and then refusing to return it, in the belief that it was natural &quot;to avoid seeing of papers or anything that belonged to one that one loved when they were just dead&quot;. Anne and the Duchess had been very close, but their friendship had become strained over political differences. The immediate aftermath of George&#x27;s death damaged their relationship further. He was buried privately at midnight on 13 November in Westminster Abbey.

==Legacy==

Anne refused initially to appoint a new Lord High Admiral, and insisted on carrying out the duties of the office herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George&#x27;s place. She burst into tears on the first occasion she was brought papers to sign in George&#x27;s stead. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of Lord Orford, a member of the Junto and one of Prince George&#x27;s leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory Lord Pembroke to lead the Admiralty, instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke&#x27;s vacated posts of Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.

===Personal traits and portrayal===
Charles II, Anne&#x27;s uncle, famously said of Prince George, &quot;I have tried him drunk, and I have tried him sober and there is nothing in him&quot;. He was quiet and self-effacing. John Macky thought him &quot;of a familiar, easy disposition with a good sound understanding but modest in showing it ... very fat, loves news, his bottle &amp; the Queen.&quot; In making fun of George&#x27;s asthma, Lord Mulgrave said the Prince was forced to breathe hard in case people mistook him for dead and buried him. By the time of Queen Victoria, George had a reputation as a dullard, and was the target of disdain. Victoria hoped her own husband, Prince Albert, would never fill the &quot;subordinate part played by the very stupid and insignificant husband of Queen Anne&quot;. In the 1930s, Winston Churchill said he &quot;mattered very little&quot;, except to Anne.

He had little impact on the running of the navy, but he was interested enough in navigation and welfare at sea to sponsor the publication of John Flamsteed&#x27;s &quot;Observations&quot; in 1704. He was not one of the most colourful political characters of his day—he was content to spend his time building model ships—but he was a loyal and supportive husband to Queen Anne. Their marriage was a devoted, loving and faithful one, though beset by personal tragedy.

The previous husband of a British queen regnant, William of Orange, had become king, refusing to take a subordinate rank to Mary. William and Mary had exemplified the traditional gender roles of seventeenth-century Europe: Mary was the dutiful wife and William held the power. George and Anne, however, reversed the roles: George was the dutiful husband and it was Anne who exercised the royal prerogatives. William had assumed incorrectly that George would use his marriage to Anne as a means of building a separate power base in Britain, but George never challenged his wife&#x27;s authority and never strove to accrue influence. Anne occasionally used the image of wifely virtue to escape unpalatable situations by claiming, as a woman, she knew &quot;nothing except what the prince tells me&quot;, but it was an artifice. Husbands had a legal right to their wife&#x27;s property, and it was argued that it was unnatural and against the church&#x27;s teachings for a man to be subject to his wife. George made no such claim or demand; he was content to remain a prince and duke. &quot;I am her Majesty&#x27;s subject&quot;, he said, &quot;I shall do naught but what she commands me.&quot; In the words of historian Anne Somerset, &quot;the fact that Prince George was widely regarded as a nonentity helped reconcile people to his anomalous status, and so, almost by accident, George achieved a major advance for feminism.&quot; Winston Churchill wrote that he

was a fine-looking man, tall, blond, and good-natured ... He was neither clever nor learned—a simple, normal man without envy or ambition, and disposed by remarkable appetite and thirst for all the pleasures of the table. Charles&#x27;s well-known verdict ... does not do justice to the homely virtues and unfailing good-humour of his staid and trustworthy character.

The Prince of Denmark&#x27;s March by Jeremiah Clarke was written in his honour, and Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, was named after him in 1696. Portraits by Sir Godfrey Kneller are at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, Drumlanrig Castle in Dumfriesshire, and (in a double portrait with George Clarke) All Souls College, Oxford. Portraits in Denmark include one by Willem Wissing in the Reedtz-Thott collection and one by Karel van Mander in the national collection at Frederiksborg Palace.

Prince George was a character in the 2015 play &quot;Queen Anne&quot; by Helen Edmundson. Despite being alive and married to Queen Anne for the majority of the timeframe depicted in 2018 period comedy film &quot;The Favourite&quot;, he was not depicted at all.

<text>In number theory, a -hyperperfect number is a natural number for which the equality formula_1 holds, where is the divisor function (i.e., the sum of all positive divisors of ). A hyperperfect number is a -hyperperfect number for some integer . Hyperperfect numbers generalize perfect numbers, which are 1-hyperperfect.

The first few numbers in the sequence of -hyperperfect numbers are , with the corresponding values of being . The first few -hyperperfect numbers that are not perfect are .

==List of hyperperfect numbers==
The following table lists the first few -hyperperfect numbers for some values of , together with the sequence number in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) of the sequence of -hyperperfect numbers:

It can be shown that if is an odd integer and formula_2 and formula_3 are prime numbers, then is -hyperperfect; Judson S. McCranie has conjectured in 2000 that all -hyperperfect numbers for odd are of this form, but the hypothesis has not been proven so far. Furthermore, it can be proven that if are odd primes and is an integer such that formula_4 then is -hyperperfect.

It is also possible to show that if and formula_5 is prime, then for all such that formula_6 is prime, formula_7 is -hyperperfect. The following table lists known values of and corresponding values of for which is -hyperperfect:

<text>Penile cancer, or penile carcinoma, is a cancer that develops in the skin or tissues of the penis. Symptoms may include abnormal growth, an ulcer or sore on the skin of the penis, and bleeding or foul smelling discharge.

Risk factors include phimosis (inability to retract foreskin of the penis), chronic inflammation, smoking, HPV infection, condylomata acuminate, having multiple sexual partners, and early age of sexual intercourse.

Around 95% of penile cancers are squamous-cell carcinomas. Other types of penile cancer such as Merkel-cell carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma, and melanoma are generally rare. In 2020, it occurred in 36,000 men and caused 13,000 deaths.

==Signs and symptoms==
Penile cancer can present as redness and irritation on the penis with a skin thickening on the glans or inner foreskin or an ulcerative, outward growing (exophytic) or “finger-like” (papillary) growth. Penile cancer may accompany penile discharge with or without difficulty or burning or tingling while urinating (dysuria) and bleeding from the penis.

==Risk factors==

* HIV infection—HIV-positive men have eight-fold increased risk of developing penile cancer than HIV-negative men.
* Human papillomavirus—HPV is a risk factor in the development of penile cancer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HPV is responsible for about 800 (about 40%) of 1,570 cases of penile cancer diagnosed annually in the United States. There are more than 120 types of HPV.
* Genital warts—Genital or perianal warts increase the risk of invasive penile cancer by about 3.7 times if they occurred more than two years before the reference date. About half of men with penile cancer also have genital warts, which are caused by HPV.

===Hygiene and injury===
* Poor hygiene—Poor hygiene can increase a man&#x27;s risk of penile cancer.
* Smegma—Smegma, a whitish substance that can accumulate beneath the foreskin, is associated with greater risk of penile cancer. The American Cancer Society suggests that smegma may not be carcinogenic, but may increase the risk by causing irritation and inflammation of the penis.
* Balanitis and penile injury—Inflammation of the foreskin and/or the glans penis (balanitis) is associated with about 3.1 times increased risk of penile cancer. It is usually caused by poor hygiene, allergic reactions to certain soaps, or an underlying health condition such as reactive arthritis, infection, or diabetes. Small tears and abrasions of the penis are associated with about 3.9 times increased risk of cancer.
* Phimosis—Phimosis is a medical condition where the foreskin cannot be fully retracted over the glans. It is considered a significant risk factor in the development of penile cancer (odds ratio of 38–65). Phimosis may also be a symptom of penile cancer.
* Paraphimosis—Paraphimosis is a medical condition where the foreskin becomes trapped behind the glans. It is considered a risk factor for the development of penile cancer.
* Circumcision—Some studies show that circumcision during infancy or in childhood may provide partial protection against penile cancer, but this is not the case when performed in adulthood. It has been suggested that the reduction in risk may be due to reduced risk of phimosis; other possible mechanisms include reduction in risk of smegma and HPV infection.

===Other===
* Age—Penile cancer is rarely seen in men under the age of 50. About 4 out of 5 men diagnosed with penile cancer are over the age of 55.
* Lichen sclerosus—Lichen sclerosus is a disease causing white patches on the skin. Lichen sclerosus increases the risk of penile cancer. As the exact cause of lichen sclerosus is unknown, there is no known way to prevent it.
* Tobacco—Chewing or smoking tobacco increases the risk of penile cancer by 1.5–6 times depending on the duration smoking and daily number of cigarettes.
* Ultraviolet light—Men with psoriasis who have been treated using UV light and a drug known as psoralen have an increased risk of penile cancer.

==Pathogenesis==
Penile cancer arises from precursor lesions, which generally progress from low-grade to high-grade lesions. For HPV related penile cancers this sequence is as follows:
# Squamous hyperplasia;
# Low-grade penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN);
# High-grade PIN (carcinoma in situ—Bowen&#x27;s disease, Erythroplasia of Queyrat and bowenoid papulosis (BP));
# Invasive carcinoma of the penis.

However, in some cases, non-dysplastic or mildly dysplastic lesions may progress directly into cancer. Examples include flat penile lesions (FPL) and &quot;condylomata acuminata&quot;.

In HPV negative cancers, the most common precursor lesion is lichen sclerosus (LS).

==Diagnosis==
The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) recommends the use of p16INK4A immunostaining for the diagnosis and classification of HPV-related penile cancer.

===Classification===
Around 95% of penile cancers are squamous-cell carcinomas. They are classified into the following types:
* basaloid (4%)
* warty (6%)
* mixed warty-basaloid (17%)
* verrucous (8%)
* papillary (7%)
* other SCC mixed (7%)
* sarcomatoid carcinomas (1%)
* not otherwise specified (49%)
Other types of carcinomas are rare and may include small-cell, Merkel-cell, clear-cell, sebaceous-cell or basal-cell tumors. Non-epithelial malignancies such as melanomas and sarcomas are even more rare.

====Staging====
Like many malignancies, penile cancer can spread to other parts of the body. It is usually a primary malignancy, the initial place from which cancer spreads in the body. Much less often it is a secondary malignancy, one in which the cancer has spread to the penis from elsewhere. The staging of penile cancer is determined by the extent of tumor invasion, nodal metastasis, and distant metastasis.

The T portion of the AJCC TNM staging guidelines are for the primary tumor as follows:
* TX: Primary tumor cannot be assessed.
* T0: No evidence of primary tumor.
* Tis: Carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot;.
* Ta: Noninvasive verrucous carcinoma.
* T1a: Tumor invades subepithelial connective tissue without lymph vascular invasion and is not poorly differentiated (i.e., grade 3–4).
* T1b: Tumor invades subepithelial connective tissue with lymph vascular invasion or is poorly differentiated.
* T2: Tumor invades the corpus spongiosum or cavernosum.
* T3: Tumor invades the urethra or prostate.
* T4: Tumor invades other adjacent structures.

Anatomic Stage or Prognostic Groups of penile cancer are as follows:
* Stage 0—Carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot;.
* Stage I—The cancer is moderately or well-differentiated and only affects the subepithelial connective tissue.
* Stage II—The cancer is poorly differentiated, affects lymphatics, or invades the corpora or urethra.
* Stage IIIa—There is deep invasion into the penis and metastasis in one lymph node.
* Stage IIIb—There is deep invasion into the penis and metastasis into multiple inguinal lymph nodes.
* Stage IV—The cancer has invaded into structures adjacent to the penis, metastasized to pelvic nodes, or distant metastasis is present.

====HPV positive tumors====
Human papillomavirus prevalence in penile cancers is high at about 40%. HPV16 is the predominant genotype accounting for approximately 63% of HPV-positive tumors. Among warty/basaloid cancers the HPV prevalence is 70–100% while in other types it is around 30%.

== Prevention ==
* HPV vaccines such as Gardasil or Cervarix may reduce the risk of HPV and, consequently, penile cancer.
* The use of condoms is thought to be protective against HPV-associated penile cancer.
* Good genital hygiene, which involves washing the penis, the scrotum, and the foreskin daily with water, may prevent balanitis and penile cancer. However, soaps with harsh ingredients should be avoided.
* Cessation of smoking may reduce the risk of penile cancer.
* Circumcision during infancy or in childhood may provide partial protection against penile cancer. Several authors have proposed circumcision as a possible strategy for penile cancer prevention; however, the American Cancer Society points to the rarity of the disease and notes that neither the American Academy of Pediatrics nor the Canadian Academy of Pediatrics recommend routine neonatal circumcision.
* Phimosis can be prevented by practising proper hygiene and by retracting the foreskin on a regular basis.
* Paraphimosis can be prevented by not leaving the foreskin retracted for prolonged periods of time.

==Treatment==
Treatment of penile cancer will vary depending on the clinical stage of the tumor at the time of diagnosis. There are several treatment options for penile cancer, depending on staging. They include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and biological therapy. The most common treatment is one of five types of surgery:
* Wide local excision—the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue are removed
* Microsurgery—surgery performed with a microscope is used to remove the tumor and as little healthy tissue as possible
* Laser surgery—laser light is used to burn or cut away cancerous cells
* Circumcision—cancerous foreskin is removed
* Amputation (penectomy)—a partial or total removal of the penis, and possibly the associated lymph nodes.

The role of radiation therapy includes an organ-sparing approach for early-stage penile cancer at specialized centres. Furthermore, adjuvant therapy is used for patients with locally advanced disease or for symptom management.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis can range considerably for patients, depending where on the scale they have been staged. Generally speaking, the earlier the cancer is diagnosed, the better the prognosis. The overall 5-year survival rate for all stages of penile cancer is about 50%.

==Epidemiology==
Penile cancer is a rare cancer in developed nations, with annual incidence varying from 0.3 to 1 per 100,000 per year, accounting for around 0.4–0.6% of all malignancies. The annual incidence is approximately 1 in 100,000 men in the United States, 1 in 250,000 in Australia, and 0.82 per 100,000 in Denmark. In the United Kingdom, fewer than 500 men are diagnosed with penile cancer every year.

In the developing world, penile cancer is much more common. For instance, in Paraguay, Uruguay, Uganda and Brazil the incidence is 4.2, 4.4, 2.8 and 1.5–3.7 per 100,000, respectively. In some South American countries, Africa, and Asia, this cancer type constitutes up to 10% of malignant diseases in men.

 the lifetime risk was estimated as 1 in 1,437 in the United States and 1 in 1,694 in Denmark.

<text>Thurgau (; ; ; ), anglicized as Thurgovia, and formally as the Canton of Thurgau, is one of the 26 cantons forming the Swiss Confederation. It is composed of five districts. Its capital is Frauenfeld.

Thurgau is part of Eastern Switzerland. It is named after the river Thur, and the name &quot;Thurgovia&quot; was historically used for a larger area, including part of this river&#x27;s basin upstream of the modern canton. The area of what is now Thurgau was acquired as subject territories by the cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy from the mid 15th century. Thurgau was first declared a canton in its own right at the formation of the Helvetic Republic in 1798.

The population, , is . In 2007, there were a total of 47,390 resident foreigners, constituting 19.9% of the population.

==History==

In prehistoric times the lands of the canton were inhabited by people of the Pfyn culture along Lake Constance. During Roman times the canton was part of the province &quot;Raetia&quot; until 450, when Alemanni settled on the lands.

In the sixth century, &quot;Thurgovia&quot; became a Gau of Francia as part of Alamannia, passing to the Duchy of Swabia in the early 10th century. At this time, &quot;Thurgovia&quot; included not just what is now the canton of Thurgau, but also much of the territory of the modern canton of St. Gallen, the Appenzell and the eastern parts of the canton of Zürich.

The most important cities of Thurgovia in the early medieval period were Konstanz as the seat of the bishop and St. Gallen for the Abbey of Saint Gall.

The dukes of the House of Zähringen and the counts of the Kyburg family took over much of the land in the High Middle Ages. The town of Zürich was part of the Thurgau until it became &quot;reichsunmittelbar&quot; in 1218. When the Kyburg dynasty became extinct in 1264 the House of Habsburg took over that land.

The Old Swiss Confederacy allied with ten freed bailiwicks of the former Toggenburg seized the lands of the Thurgau from the Habsburgs in 1460, and it became a subject territory of seven Swiss cantons (Zurich, Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug and Glarus).

During the Protestant Reformation in Switzerland, both the Catholic and emerging Reformed parties sought to swing the subject territories, such as the Thurgau, to their side. In 1524, in an incident that resonated across Switzerland, local peasants occupied the cloister of Ittingen in the Thurgau, driving out monks, destroying documents, and devastating the wine-cellar. Between 1526 and 1531, most of the Thurgau&#x27;s population adopted the new Reformed faith spreading from Zurich; Zurich&#x27;s defeat in the 1531 Second War of Kappel ended Reformed predominance. Instead, the First Peace of Kappel protected both Catholic and Reformed worship, though the provisions of the treaty generally favored the Catholics, who also made up a majority among the seven ruling cantons. Religious tensions over the Thurgau were an important background to the First War of Villmergen (1656), during which Zurich briefly occupied the Thurgau.

In 1798 the land became a canton for the first time as part of the Helvetic Republic. In 1803, as part of the Act of Mediation, the canton of Thurgau became a member of the Swiss confederation. The cantonal coat of arms was designed in 1803, based on the coat of arms of the Kyburg family, which ruled the Thurgau in the 13th century, changing the background to green-and-white, at the time considered &quot;revolutionary&quot; colours (c.f. tricolour); as the placement of a yellow (&quot;or&quot;) charge on white (&quot;argent&quot;) is a violation of heraldic principles, there have been suggestions to modify the design, including a 1938 suggestion to use a solid green field divided by a diagonal white line, but they were unsuccessful.

On March 26, 1806, Thurgau became the first state in the world to introduce compulsory smallpox vaccinations, by order of the cantonal councillor &quot;Jakob Christoph Scherb&quot;.

The current cantonal constitution of Thurgau dates from 1987.

==Geography==

To the north the canton is bound by the Lake Constance across which lies Germany (Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria) and Austria (Vorarlberg). The Rhine creates the border in the northwest. To the south lies the canton of St. Gallen; to the west lie the cantons of Zürich and Schaffhausen.

The area of the canton is and commonly divided into three hill masses. One of these stretches along Lake Constance in the north. Another is further inland between the Thur and the river Murg. The third one forms the southern border of the canton and merges with the Hörnli mountain in the pre-Alps.

==Demographics==
The population of the canton (as of ) is . The canton is mostly German speaking. The population () is split between Protestants (45%) and Roman Catholics (36%).

=== Federal election results ===

: FDP before 2009, FDP.The Liberals after 2009
: &quot;*&quot; indicates that the party was not on the ballot in this canton.

==Economy==
The canton of Thurgau is known for its agricultural produce. Particularly, apples, pears. The many orchards in the canton are mainly used for the production of cider. Wine is produced in the Thur valley.

There is also industry in the canton of Thurgau. The main industries are printing, textiles and handicrafts. Small and middle-sized businesses are important for the cantonal economy. Many of these are concentrated around the capital.

<text>Speed skiing is the sport of skiing downhill in a straight line at as high a speed as possible, as timed over a fixed stretch of ski slope. There are two types of contest: breaking an existing speed record or having the fastest run at a given competition. Speed skiers regularly exceed 

==History==
Speed skiing dates from 1898 with a run by American Tommy Todd, reported at . Official records began with an run by Leo Gasperl in 1932. While training for the 1956 Winter Olympics, American downhiller Ralph Miller is credited with being the first to break , at nearly in August 1955 at Portillo, Chile, a record which held up for fifteen years.

In 1978, also at Portillo, American Steve McKinney&#x27;s record-breaking run of made him the first to break the barrier. It was a demonstration sport at the Albertville 1992 Winter Olympics on the Les Arcs speed skiing course, but was deemed too dangerous after several recorded deaths.

==Description==
Speed skiing is practiced on steep, specially designed courses in length. There are approximately thirty of these courses worldwide, many of them at high altitudes to minimize air resistance. The first of the course (the launching area) is used to gain speed, the top speed is measured in the next (the timing zone) and the last (the run-out area) is used for slowing down and coming to a stop. The start point in FIS races is chosen so that, in theory, skiers should not exceed , hence competition is aimed at winning a particular event, not breaking world speed records. At pro races, there is no maximum speed and the speed attained is determined by conditions and safety.

In theory, speeds could continue to increase by using even longer and steeper slopes; this would eventually change speed skiing into something closer to skydiving except with skis rather than a parachute. Since a slight bump or gentle turn can easily prove fatal at such speeds, there is little appetite for this.

==Equipment==
Speed skiers wear dense foam fairings on their lower legs and aerodynamic helmets to increase streamlining. Their ski suits are made from air-tight latex or have a polyurethane coating to reduce wind resistance, with only a minimal (but mandatory) back protector to give some protection in the case of a crash.

The special skis used must be in length and at most wide, with a maximum weight of for the pair. Ski boots are attached to the skis by bindings. The ski poles are bent to shape around the body, with a minimum length of .

==Official world records==
The following records were set under FSV (France Ski de Vitesse) rules at Vars, France:
*&quot;Men&quot; – Simon Billy (France) on March 22, 2023.
*&quot;Women&quot; – Valentina Greggio (Italy) 247.083 km/h (153.530 mph) on 26 March 2016.

<doc id="322192" wikidata="Q969772" url="?curid=322192" title="Free agent">
<text>In professional sports, a free agent is a player or manager who is eligible to sign with other clubs or franchises; i.e., not under contract to any specific team. The term is also used in reference to a player who is under a contract at present but who is allowed to solicit offers from other teams. In some circumstances, the free agent&#x27;s options are limited by the league&#x27;s rules.

Free agency was severely restricted in many sports leagues, instead clubs had a reserve clause which allowed them to retain players indefinitely.

== Usage ==

=== Association football===

In professional association football, a free agent is either a player that has been released by a professional association football club and now is no longer affiliated with any league, or a player whose contract with their current club has expired and is thus free to join any other club under the terms of the Bosman ruling.

Free agents do not have to be signed during the normal transfer window that is implemented in some countries&#x27; leagues. If they are signed by a team, the team signing them does not have to pay any fees – sometimes this is known as &quot;a free transfer&quot;.

If a player is released from their club when the transfer window is closed, they cannot sign for another team until the window reopens. A notable case of this being Sol Campbell who in September 2009 was released from Notts County, just after a month from signing on a free transfer. He signed for his former club Arsenal in January 2010 during the winter transfer window, after spending a few months training with the team to maintain his fitness.


=== Australian Football League (AFL)===
The Australian Football League introduced free agency at the end of 2012, after having had a brief &quot;ten-year rule&quot; in 1973 (when it was known as the Victorian Football League).

Out-of-contract players who are not within the top 25% paid players at their club will become unrestricted free agents after eight seasons of service at one club. Out-of-contract players who are within the top 25% paid players at their club become restricted free agents after eight seasons, then become unrestricted free agents after ten seasons. 
Clubs receive compensation in the form of draft picks for the loss of out-of-contract free agents, but players who are delisted become unrestricted free agents, regardless of length of service, and clubs are not compensated for the transfer of such free agents.


=== Major League Baseball (MLB)===
=== National Basketball Association (NBA)===

=== National Football League (NFL)===
The NFL&#x27;s current free agency system was introduced on March 1, 1993.

;Unrestricted free agents
Unrestricted free agents (UFAs) are players with expired contracts that have completed four or more accrued seasons of service. They are free to sign with any franchise.

;Restricted free agents
Restricted free agents (RFAs) are players who have three accrued seasons of service and whose contracts have expired. RFAs have received qualifying offers from their old clubs and are free to negotiate with any club until a deadline which occurs approximately a week prior to the NFL Draft (for the deadline was April 15), at which time their rights revert to their original club. If a player accepts an offer from a new club, the old club will have the right to match the offer and retain the player. If the old club elects not to match the offer, it may receive draft-choice compensation depending on the level of the qualifying offer made to the player.

;Exclusive-rights free agents
Exclusive-rights free agents (ERFAs) are players with two or fewer seasons of service time and whose contracts have expired. If their team tenders a qualifying offer (a one-year contract usually at league-minimum salary) the player has no negotiating rights with other teams, and must either sign the tender with the team or sit out the season.

;Undrafted free agents
Undrafted free agents are players eligible for the NFL draft but were not selected; they can sign with any team.

;&quot;Plan B&quot; free agency
Plan B free agency was a type of free agency that became active in the National Football League in February 1989 to 1992. Plan B free agency permitted all teams in the NFL to preserve limited rights of no more than 37 total players a season; if a player was a protected Plan B free agent, he was incapable of signing with another team without providing his old team the first opportunity to sign him again. The rest of the players were left unprotected, liberated to negotiate contracts with the rest of the teams in the league.

Eight players sued the NFL in U.S. federal court, stating that Plan B was an unlawful restraint of trade. In 1992, a jury found that Plan B violated antitrust laws and awarded damages to these players.

=== National Hockey League (NHL) ===
In the National Hockey League (NHL), between 2005 and 2008, the age of unrestricted free agency declined from 31 to 27. Under the old collective agreement, which expired in 2004, draft picks were awarded as compensation when a team lost an unrestricted free agent; however, under the current CBA teams losing unrestricted free agents do not receive any compensation.

In addition, any player at least 22 years of age who has not been selected in the NHL entry draft can sign with any team as a free agent. Any player who is not entry-level, but does not meet the qualifications of unrestricted free agency becomes a restricted free agent when his contract expires.

===Major League Soccer (MLS) ===
Players eligible for free agency are 24 years of age and older with five MLS service years and are out of contract or have had their option declined.

===National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL) ===
Free agency has been available in the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League since 2023; players eligible for free agency are required six years of service within the NWSL.

===Major League Rugby (MLR) ===
In Major League Rugby, a player can be signed by any team as a free agent at 18 years old as long as they don&#x27;t enroll in college. In case they do, they have to wait for MLR Draft at 21 years old.

== Deadlines and terms ==
In some leagues, free agency has deadlines. For example, under the most recent NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement, restricted free agents who do not sign contracts by December 1 of a given year will be ineligible to play in the National Hockey League for the balance of that season. However, other leagues (such as the National Basketball Association) have no such restrictions on signing periods in season, despite having a moratorium in the offseason.

In Europe, players can only move during transfer windows—during the close season and halfway through the league season. There are exceptions for unsigned professional players in the lower divisions.

=== Unrestricted free agent ===
Unrestricted free agents (UFA) are players not under contract with a team. They have either been released from their club, had the term of their contract expire without a renewal, or were not chosen in a league&#x27;s draft of amateur players. These people, generally speaking, are free to entertain offers from all other teams in the player&#x27;s most recent league and elsewhere and to decide with whom to sign a contract. Players who have been bought out of league standard contracts may have restrictions within that league, such as not being able to sign with the buy-out club for a period of time in the NHL, but are otherwise not restricted.

=== Restricted free agent ===

Restricted free agents (RFA) are typically players under contract with a team but are able to negotiate offers from other teams, with their current team able to match the terms of the newly offered contract. For a restricted free agent, some leagues require the comp team to offer to the original team one or more draft picks, when an offer is not matched, as compensation for losing the player.

=== Undrafted free agent ===

Undrafted free agents (UDFA) are players who were unselected in a league&#x27;s annual draft of amateur players and are then free to negotiate contracts with any team. In most American professional sports, players are drafted by sequencing each team from worst to best (according to the teams&#x27; winloss records the previous season, sometimes invoking a draft lottery factor to avoid having teams intentionally lose their last games to gain higher draft position) and allowing said teams to claim rights to the top players entering the league that year. Players that pass through an entire draft (usually several rounds) without being selected by any of the league&#x27;s teams become unrestricted free agents, and these players are sometimes identified simply as an &quot;undrafted free agent&quot; (UDFA) or &quot;undrafted sportsperson&quot; and are free to sign with any team they choose. The term &quot;undrafted free agent&quot; is most common in the National Football League (NFL), where rookies enter directly into the NFL and do not play in a minor league system. It can also occasionally be seen in the National Hockey League (NHL), which increasingly uses college hockey as a source; the NHL entry draft usually drafts players of high school age (i.e., junior leagues), which allows overlooked players who excel at the college level or in European professional leagues to bypass the draft and sign directly with the NHL.

=== Legal provisions in the EU ===
In the European Union, the 1995 Bosman ruling by the European Court of Justice established the right of free agency for association football players in all EU member nations. The Bosman ruling has since been extended to cover other professional sports and players from Eastern Europe. Players were still tied to their clubs unless their contract ran out until the Webster ruling allowed players the opportunity to move between nations, though it does not allow free players to move within the national league in which they currently play.

==Other terminology==
===Free agent bust===
A &quot;free agent bust&quot; is a highly touted or highly signed free agent who does not meet expectations. This can be for a variety of reasons such as being unable to adjust to the team&#x27;s more demanding role, system or scheme of the team or if their time with team was affected by injuries.

===NFL===
In the NFL, numerous of notable highly touted free agents have signed with other teams, with the tenures being busts. One example is Larry Brown, most known from his two interception game which earned him a Super Bowl MVP award and championship in Super Bowl XXX, signed a five-year, $12.5 million free-agent deal with the Oakland Raiders. Brown played just 12 games with Oakland and then was waived after two seasons with the team. Another well known example is Albert Haynesworth. The highly coveted defensive tackle signed with the Redskins for a seven-year, $100 million deal which ultimately busted with his laziness and ineffectiveness on the team. He was let go after two years.

<doc id="322197" wikidata="Q1338684" url="?curid=322197" title="Tension headache">
<text>Tension headache, stress headache, or tension-type headache (TTH), is the most common type of primary headache. The pain usually radiates from the lower back of the head, the neck, the eyes, or other muscle groups in the body typically affecting both sides of the head. Tension-type headaches account for nearly 90% of all headaches.
Pain medications, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, are effective for the treatment of tension headache. Tricyclic antidepressants appear to be useful for prevention. Evidence is poor for SSRIs, propranolol and muscle relaxants.
The 2016 Global Burden of Disease study revealed that TTHs affect about 1.89 billion people and are more common in women than men (30.8% to 21.4% respectively). TTH was most prevalent between ages 35 and 39. Despite its benign character, tension-type headache, especially in its chronic form, can impart significant disability on patients as well as burden on society at large. In 2016, the global burden of TTH was reported to be 7.2 million years of life lived with disability (YLDs). The YLD was calculated using TTH prevalence and average time spent with TTH multiplied by percentage health loss caused by TTH (3.7%).

== Signs and symptoms ==
According to the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, the attacks must meet the following criteria:

* A duration of between 30 minutes and 7 days.
* At least two of the following four characteristics:
** bilateral location
** pressing or tightening (non-pulsating) quality
** mild or moderate intensity
** not aggravated by routine physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs
* Both of the following:
** no nausea or vomiting
** no more than one of photophobia (sensitivity to bright light) or phonophobia (sensitivity to loud sounds)

Tension-type headaches may be accompanied by tenderness of the scalp on manual pressure during an attack.

== Risk factors ==
Various precipitating factors may cause tension-type headaches in susceptible individuals:

* Anxiety
* Stress
* Sleep problems
* Young age
* Poor health

== Mechanism ==
Although the musculature of the head and neck and psychological factors such as stress may play a role in the overall pathophysiology of TTH, neither is currently believed to be the sole cause of the development of TTH. The pathologic basis of TTH is most likely derived from a combination of personal factors, environmental factors, and alteration of both peripheral and central pain pathways. Peripheral pain pathways receive pain signals from pericranial (around the head) myofascial tissue (protective tissue of muscles) and alteration of this pathway likely underlies episodic tension-type headache (ETTH). In addition, pericranial muscle tenderness, inflammation, and muscle ischemia have been postulated in headache literature to be causal factors in the peripheral pathophysiology of TTH. However, multiple studies have failed to illustrate evidence for a pathologic role of either ischemia or inflammation within the muscles. Pericranial tenderness is also not likely a peripheral causal factor for TTH, but may instead act to trigger a chronic pain cycle. This is when the peripheral pain response is transformed over time into a centralized pain response. These prolonged alterations in the peripheral pain pathways can lead to increased excitability of the central nervous system pain pathways, resulting in the transition of ETTH into chronic tension-type headache (CTTH). Specifically, the hyperexcitability occurs in central nociceptive neurons (the trigeminal spinal nucleus, thalamus, and cerebral cortex) resulting in central sensitization, which manifests clinically as allodynia and hyperalgesia of CTTH. Additionally, CTTH patients exhibit decreased thermal and pain thresholds which further bolsters support for central sensitization occurring in CTTH.

The alterations in physiology that leads to the overall process of central sensitization, involves changes at the level of neural tracts, neurotransmitters and their receptors, the neural synapse, and the post-synaptic membrane. Evidence also suggests that dysfunction in supraspinal descending inhibitory pain pathways may contribute to the pathogenesis of central sensitization in CTTH.

===Neurotransmitters===

Specific neuronal receptors and neurotransmitters thought to be most involved include NMDA and AMPA receptors, glutamate, serotonin (5-HT), β-endorphin, and nitric oxide (NO). Of the neurotransmitters, NO plays a major role in central pain pathways and likely contributes to the process of central sensitization. Briefly, the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) forms NO which ultimately results in vasodilatation and activation of central nervous system pain pathways. Serotonin may also be of significant importance and involved in malfunctioning pain filter located in the brain stem. The view is that the brain misinterprets information—for example from the temporal muscle or other muscles—and interprets this signal as pain. Evidence for this theory comes from the fact that chronic tension-type headaches may be successfully treated with certain antidepressants such as nortriptyline. However, the analgesic effect of nortriptyline, as well as amitriptyline in chronic tension-type headache, is not solely due to serotonin reuptake inhibition, and likely other mechanisms are involved.

===Synapses===
Regarding synaptic level changes, homosynaptic facilitation and heterosynaptic facilitation are both likely to be involved in central sensitization. Homosynaptic facilitation occurs when synapses normally involved in pain pathways undergo changes involving receptors on the post-synaptic membrane as well as the molecular pathways activated upon synaptic transmission. Lower pain thresholds of CTTH result from this homosynaptic facilitation. In contrast, heterosynaptic facilitation occurs when synapses not normally involved in pain pathways become involved. Once this occurs innocuous signals are interpreted as painful signals. Allodynia and hyperalgesia of CTTH represent this heterosynaptic facilitation clinically.

===Stress===
In the literature, stress is mentioned as a factor and may be implicated via the adrenal axis. This ultimately results in downstream activation of NMDA receptor activation, NFκB activation, and upregulation of iNOS with subsequent production of NO leading to pain as described above.

== Diagnosis ==
With TTH, the physical exam is expected to be normal with perhaps the exception of either pericranial tenderness upon palpation of the cranial muscles, or presence of either photophobia or phonophobia.

=== Classification ===

The International Headache Society&#x27;s most current classification system for headache disorders is the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3) as of 2018. This classification system separates tension-type headache (TTH) into two main groups: episodic (ETTH) and chronic (CTTH). CTTH is defined as fifteen days or more per month with headache for greater than three months, or one-hundred eighty days or more, with headache per year. ETTH is less than fifteen days per month with headache or less than one-hundred eighty days with headache per year. However, ETTH is further sub-divided into frequent and infrequent TTH. Frequent TTH is defined as ten or more episodes of headache over the course of one to fourteen days per month for greater than three months, or at least twelve days per year, but less than one-hundred eighty days per year. Infrequent TTH is defined as ten or more episodes of headache for less than one day per month or less than twelve days per year. Furthermore, all sub-classes of TTH can be classified as having presence or absence of pericranial tenderness, which is tenderness of the muscles of the head. Probable TTH is utilized for patients with some characteristics, but not all characteristics of a given sub-type of TTH.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Extensive testing is not needed as TTH is diagnosed by history and physical examination. However, if symptoms indicative of a more serious diagnosis are present, a contrast enhanced MRI may be utilized. Furthermore, giant cell arteritis should be considered in those 50 years of age and beyond. Screening for giant cell arteritis involves the blood tests of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and c-reactive protein.

* Cervical spine disease
* Infection in immunocompromised
* Intracranial mass
* Idiopathic intracranial hypertension 
*Medication overuse headache
* Secondary headache (headache due to other disorder)
*Giant cell arteritis (≥50 years of age)
*Dermatochalasis

==Prevention==

===Lifestyle===
Good posture might prevent headaches if there is neck pain.

Drinking alcohol can make headaches more likely or severe.

Drinking water and avoiding dehydration helps in preventing tension headache.

People who have jaw clenching might develop headaches, and getting treatment from a dentist might prevent those headaches.

Using stress management and relaxing often makes headaches less likely.

Biofeedback techniques may also help.

===Medications===
People who have 15 or more headaches in a month may be treated with certain types of daily antidepressants which act to prevent continued tension headaches from occurring. In those who are predisposed to tension type headaches the first-line preventative treatment is amitriptyline, whereas mirtazapine and venlafaxine are second-line treatment options. Tricyclic antidepressants appear to be useful for prevention. Tricyclic antidepressants have been found to be more effective than SSRIs but have greater side effects. Evidence is poor for the use of SSRIs, propranolol, and muscle relaxants for prevention of tension headaches.

== Treatment ==
Treatment for a current tension headache is to drink water and confirm that there is no dehydration. If symptoms do not resolve within an hour for a person who has had water, then stress reduction might resolve the issue.

=== Exercise ===
Evidence supports simple neck and shoulder exercises in managing ETTH and CTTH for headaches associated with neck pain. Exercises include stretching, strengthening and range of motion exercises. CTTH can also benefit from combined therapy from stress therapy, exercises and postural correction.

=== Medications ===

==== Episodic ====
Over-the-counter drugs, like paracetamol, or NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen, ketoprofen), can be effective but tend to only be helpful as a treatment for a few times in a week at most. For those with gastrointestinal problems (ulcers and bleeding), and/or kidney problems, acetaminophen is the better choice over aspirin, though both provide roughly equivalent pain relief. It is important to note that large daily doses of paracetamol should be avoided as it may cause liver damage especially in those that consume 3 or more drinks/day and those with pre-existing liver disease. Ibuprofen, one of the NSAIDs listed above, is a common choice for pain relief but may also lead to gastrointestinal discomfort.

Analgesic/caffeine combinations are popular such as the aspirin-caffeine combination or the aspirin, paracetamol and caffeine combinations. Frequent use (daily or skipping just one day in between use for 7–10 days) of any of the above analgesics may, however, lead to medication overuse headache.

Analgesic/sedative combinations are widely used (e.g., analgesic/antihistamine combinations, analgesic/barbiturate combinations such as Fiorinal).

Muscle relaxants are typically used for and are helpful with acute post-traumatic TTH rather than ETTH. Opioid medications are not utilized to treat ETTH. Botulinum toxin does not appear to be helpful.

==== Chronic ====
Classes of medications involved in treatment of CTTH include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), SSRIs, benzodiazepine (Clonazepam in small evening dose), and muscle relaxants. The most commonly utilized TCA is amitriptyline due to the postulated role in decreasing central sensitization and analgesic relief. Another popular TCA used is Doxepine. SSRIs may also be utilized for management of CTTH. For patients with concurrent muscle spasm and CTTH, the muscle relaxant Tizanidine can be a helpful option.

These medications however, are not effective if concurrent overuse of over the counter medications or other analgesics is occurring. Stopping overuse must occur prior to proceeding with other forms of treatment.

=== Manual therapy ===
Current evidence for acupuncture is slight. A 2016 systematic review suggests better evidence among those with frequent tension headaches, but concludes that further trials comparing acupuncture with other treatment options are needed.

People with tension-type headache often use spinal manipulation, soft tissue therapy, and myofascial trigger point treatment. Studies of effectiveness are mixed. A 2006 systematic review found no rigorous evidence supporting manual therapies for tension headache. A 2005 structured review found only weak evidence for the effectiveness of chiropractic manipulation for tension headache, and that it was probably more effective for tension headache than for migraine. Two other systematic reviews published between 2000 and May 2005 did not find conclusive evidence in favor of spinal manipulation. A 2012 systematic review of manual therapy found that hands-on work may reduce both the frequency and the intensity of chronic tension-type headaches. More current literature also appears to be mixed however, CTTH patients may benefit from massage and physiotherapy as suggested by a systemic review examining these modalities via RCTs specifically for this patient population Despite being helpful, the review also makes a point to note that there is no difference in effectiveness long term (6 months) between those CTTH patients utilizing TCAs and physiotherapy. Another systemic review comparing manual therapy to pharmacologic therapy also supports little long term difference in outcome regarding TTH frequency, duration, and intensity.

==Epidemiology==
As of 2016 tension headaches affect about 1.89 billion people and are more common in women than men (23% to 18% respectively). Despite its benign character, tension-type headache, especially in its chronic form, can impart significant disability on patients as well as burden on society at large.

<text> (Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major), K. 525, is a 1787 composition for a chamber ensemble by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791). The German title means &quot;a little night music&quot;. One of Mozart&#x27;s most famous works, the serenade is written for an ensemble of two violins, viola, cello and double bass, but is often performed by string orchestras.

==Composition, publication, and reception==

The serenade was completed in Vienna on 10 August 1787, around the time Mozart was working on the second act of his opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. It is not known why it was composed. Wolfgang Hildesheimer, noting that most of Mozart&#x27;s serenades were written on commission, suggests that this serenade, too, was a commission, whose origin and first performance were not recorded.

The traditionally used name of the work comes from the entry Mozart made for it in his personal catalog, which begins, &quot;Eine kleine Nacht-Musick&quot;. As Zaslaw and Cowdery point out, Mozart almost certainly was not giving the piece a special title, but only entering in his records that he had completed a little serenade.

The work was not published until about 1827, long after Mozart&#x27;s death, by Johann André in Offenbach am Main. It had been sold to this publisher in 1799 by Mozart&#x27;s widow Constanze, part of a large bundle of her husband&#x27;s compositions.

Today, the serenade is widely performed and recorded; indeed, Hildesheimer opines that the serenade is the most popular of all Mozart&#x27;s works. Of the music, Hildesheimer writes, &quot;even if we hear it on every street corner, its high quality is undisputed, an occasional piece from a light but happy pen.&quot;

==Movements==
The work has four movements:
===I. Allegro===

This first movement is in sonata-allegro form. It opens with an ascending Mannheim rocket theme. The second theme is more graceful and in D major, the dominant key of G major. The exposition closes in D major and is repeated. The development section begins on D major and touches on D minor and C major before the work returns to G major for the recapitulation.

&lt;/score&gt;

===II. Romance: Andante===

The second movement, with the tempo marked &quot;Andante&quot;, is a Romance in the subdominant key of C major. It is in rondo form, taking the shape A–B–A–C–A plus a final coda. The keys of the sections are C major for A and B, C minor for C. The middle appearance of A is truncated, consisting of only the first half of the theme. Daniel Heartz describes the movement as evoking gavotte rhythm: each of its sections begins in the middle of the measure, with a double upbeat.

&lt;/score&gt;

===III. Menuetto: Allegretto===

The third movement, marked &quot;Allegretto&quot;, is a minuet and trio, both in time. The minuet is in the home key of G major, the contrasting trio in the dominant key of D major. As is normal in this form, the minuet is played again da capo following the trio.

===IV. Rondo: Allegro===

The fourth and last movement is in lively tempo, marked &quot;Allegro&quot;; the key is again G major, and the movement is written in sonata form. Mozart specifies repeats not just for the exposition section but also for the following development and recapitulation section. The recapitulation&#x27;s first theme is unusual because only its last two bars return in the parallel minor. A coda ends the piece.

==Possible extra movement==
In the catalogue entry mentioned above, Mozart listed the work as having five movements (&quot;Allegro – Minuet and Trio – Romance – Minuet and Trio – Finale.&quot;). The second movement in his listing — a minuet and trio — was long thought lost, and no one knows if Mozart or someone else removed it. In his 1984 recording, Christopher Hogwood used a minuet of Thomas Attwood (found in his sketchbooks used while he took lessons from Mozart), and an additional newly composed trio to substitute the missing movement. Musicologist Alfred Einstein suggested, however, that a minuet in the Piano Sonata in B major, K. 498a, is the missing movement. K. 498a, which is credited to the composer August Eberhard Müller, incorporates significant amounts of Mozart&#x27;s work in the form of reworkings of material from the piano concertos K. 450, K. 456, and K. 595, leading Einstein to suggest that the minuet in Müller&#x27;s sonata might be an arrangement of the missing movement from &quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot;.

In 1971, this movement was incorporated into a recording of the work prepared by the musicologist and performer Thurston Dart. In 1989, the minuet and trio of K. 498a was again recorded as part of an arrangement of &quot;Eine Kleine Nachtmusik&quot; made by Jonathan Del Mar for Nimbus Records.

<text>Sarah Louise Teather (born 1 June 1974) is the Director of Jesuit Refugee Service UK and a former British Member of Parliament and Minister. As a Liberal Democrat politician, she founded the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Guantanamo Bay and was chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Refugees. On stepping down as an MP, she joined the Jesuit Refugee Service as an advocacy adviser and was appointed as country director of JRS UK in December 2015.

After serving in the Islington London Borough Council, she was first elected as an MP on 18 September 2003 at the Brent East by-election and was re-elected with an increased majority at the 2005 general election. After the seat was abolished due to boundary changes, Teather was selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate for the successor seat, Brent Central. Her main opponent was sitting Labour MP Dawn Butler, whose Brent South seat was also abolished. Teather won by a small margin, and, after the election, she served as Minister of State in the Department for Education in the coalition government between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats until she returned to the backbenches on 4 September 2012. On 7 September 2013, she announced that she would leave the House of Commons in 2015.

==Early life==
Teather was educated at the independent Leicester Grammar School and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where she gained a 2:1 degree in Natural Sciences specialising in pharmacology.

Teather initially embarked on a PhD at University College London, but left the course at the end of her first year. She went on to work as a policy adviser for a number of prominent groups including the Royal Society and the charity Macmillan Cancer Relief.

Teather first contested an election on 7 June 2001 in the seat of Finchley and Golders Green. On 3 May 2002 she was elected to Islington London Borough Council as one of the three councillors representing Hillrise Ward. She was then appointed by the council to serve as a school governor at Ashmount Primary School.

Subsequent to her first election as an MP she resigned from Islington Council, resigned as a school governor at Ashmount Primary and withdrew as a candidate for the Greater London Assembly seat in North East London.

==In Westminster and Whitehall==

===Member of Parliament===
In 2003 Teather was selected as the party&#x27;s candidate in the Brent East by-election, which was called after the death of the Labour MP Paul Daisley.

The by-election took place during the early stages of the Iraq War, which the Liberal Democrats strongly opposed under leader Charles Kennedy, and was a controversial involvement denting support for the Labour government. The Liberal Democrats came from third place behind Labour and the Conservatives, with a 39.12% share of the total and 1,118 majority. At 29, Teather became the youngest Member of Parliament, known as Baby of the House. The by-election was Labour&#x27;s first by-election defeat in 15 years.

In her maiden speech when first elected as an MP in 2003, she spoke about her opposition to tuition fees:
She successfully defended her seat in the 2005 general election, increasing her majority to over 2,700. In May 2009, she was listed by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as one of the &quot;Saints&quot; in the expenses scandal. In Autumn 2006, she spent a week observing in schools, writing a daily blog of the experience for Guardian Unlimited.

On 31 August 2006, she announced her intention to stand for the new Brent Central constituency. In her campaign for re-election in May 2010, Teather reiterated her opposition to tuition fees, signing a pledge to vote against them. She defeated by 1,300 votes the Labour candidate Dawn Butler, who had been the MP for Brent South in the previous parliament, despite Butler having a notional 50.1% share of the vote in the new constituency.

She established the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Guantanamo Bay in March 2007, and used the group to campaign against the detention without charge of Jamil el-Banna, a constituent. She visited Washington twice to lobby on his behalf, and also worked closely on the case with the anti-death penalty charity, Reprieve and Amnesty International.

===Liberal Democrats Frontbench Team===
In parliament Teather became one of the highest-profile Liberal Democrat MPs. Initially acting as her party&#x27;s spokesperson on London, after the 2005 general election she was promoted to the front bench to serve as Liberal Democrat spokesperson on Community and Local Government.

On 6 January 2006, 25 Liberal Democrat MPs signed a letter drafted by Teather and fellow frontbencher Ed Davey, indicating their unwillingness to continue working under party leader Charles Kennedy. &quot;The Guardian&quot; claimed the letter to be &quot;the most damning&quot; of the publicly expressed sentiments regarding Kennedy&#x27;s position, and later that day Kennedy announced his resignation. Teather supported Sir Menzies Campbell in the subsequent leadership election.

She was promoted again to Education spokesperson following Sir Menzies Campbell&#x27;s election as leader on 2 March 2006. In 2007 Teather became Business spokesperson, followed by becoming Housing spokesperson from 2008.

===Minister in the coalition government===
Following the formation of the coalition government in May 2010 Teather became Minister of State for Children and Families.

In September 2010 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that she had been accused by several members of parliament of lobbying her boss, the Education Secretary Michael Gove, for two schools in her constituency to be spared from the government&#x27;s plans to cancel refurbishment projects on over 700 schools nationwide.The plans for refurbishment of the two schools, which had been previously cancelled, was reinstated.

On 13 July 2011, Teather told the Family and Parenting Institute that she was extremely worried about the £26,000 Benefit Cap that the Coalition Government was introducing as part of the Welfare Reform Act 2012. Teather then failed to turn up to a number of key votes on the Welfare Reform Act despite there being a three-line whip, which resulted in a number of Conservative backbench MPs publicly calling for her to be sacked.

In April 2011, Teather was questioned on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; over replacing the Education Maintenance Allowance. Arguing against the claim that fewer poor pupils would be served by its replacement, Teather claimed that it would actually be targeted better at those who actually needed government support.

On 6 February 2012 Teather was part of a ministerial working group together with Tim Loughton and justice minister Jonathan Djanogly that was asked to come up with proposals within two months on how the law should be changed regarding how to amend the Children Act of 1989. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; of 3 February 2012, that working group is aimed to include in the new Children Act one &quot;presumption of shared parenting&quot; for children&#x27;s fathers and mothers after cases of divorce or spousal break-up.

On 4 September 2012, she was sacked from her post, as part of a broad government reshuffle, and returned to the backbenches.

===Post-ministerial activities===
After leaving Government, Teather gave an interview to &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper, in which she called the Benefit Cap &quot;immoral and divisive&quot;. She then voted against the coalition for the first time, on a deferred division on the final regulations needed to put the Benefit Cap in place. In late 2012, Teather chaired a Parliamentary inquiry into asylum support for children and young people, which was supported by The Children&#x27;s Society.

In February 2013, Teather voted against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill at its second reading. She later expressed regret for this vote, writing that she has since &quot;thanked God that I was then in an irrelevant minority&quot;.

On 7 September 2013, Teather released a statement through her website to announce she would not contest the 2015 general election, saying her decision was &quot;to do with some aspects of government policy&quot;, adding that she &quot;no longer feels that Nick Clegg&#x27;s party fights sufficiently for social justice and liberal values on immigration&quot;.

On 3 March 2015, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Refugees and the All Party Parliamentary Group on Migration published a report on the use of immigration detention. The inquiry panel, chaired by Sarah Teather, found that &quot;the UK uses detention disproportionately and inappropriately&quot; and recommended that a time limit of 28 days be introduced as the maximum length of time an individual can be held in an immigration removal centre.

==Later career==
Teather stood down as the MP for Brent Central at the 2015 general election and joined the International Advocacy team of the Jesuit Refugee Service in June 2015. As an advocacy advisor, she visited JRS projects all over the world, including: Lebanon, South Sudan, Uganda, North Macedonia and the southern coast of Italy where thousands of migrants were attempting dangerous overseas crossings to mainland Europe across the Mediterranean Sea. On 3 December 2015, it was announced that Teather had been appointed as the country director of JRS UK.

==Personal life==
Teather is Catholic. At , she has been the shortest woman member of Parliament in British history.

<text>Malinao, officially the Municipality of Malinao (Aklanon: &quot;Banwa it Malinao&quot;; Hiligaynon: &quot;Banwa sang Malinao&quot;; ), is a municipality in the province of Aklan, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 24,517 people.

==History==
Once an &quot;arrabal&quot; of the town of Banga to the east, Malinao&#x27;s town leaders in the mid-18th century were able to submit a petition of separation direct, to Manila that was approved. In addition, Malinao rose to prominence in Philippine history during the struggle against colonial rule under Spain at the end of the 19th century. Candido Iban, a resident of Malinao, was a member of the inner circle of the original Katipuneros, directly under Andres Bonifacio.

The people of Malinao are mainly of Malay stock. Aklanons are believed to be descendants of the settlers who fled the oppressive rule of Makatunaw, Sultan of Brunei. Led by Datu Puti, ten datus settled in the plains of the island of Panay. The colonization by the Spaniards, the trading by the Chinese have infused new blood to the original Malay race into what are now the people of Malinao.

There is no record of the history of Malinao until the 18th century. By this time, the area of what is now Malinao was part of the adjacent municipality of Banga. The &quot;Poblacion&quot; of Banga then was the &quot;Poblacion&quot; of Malinao today. In 1792, however, the town authorities transferred the Poblacion of Banga across the Aklan River at the foot of Manduyog Hill where it is now located.

Some prominent families decided to remain in the &#x27;old town&#x27; which was reduced to the status of &quot;barrio&quot; and named Malinao - derived from the name of the placid river that traverses the western and southern portion of the area as it empties into the Aklan River.

The people who remained in Malinao led by Don Juan Nepomuceno agitated to separate the lands west of the Aklan River to form a new town with Malinao as its poblacion.

Malinao as a municipality came into being in the year 1796 with Don Casimiro Barrera as its first &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot;.

Little written history is known of Malinao in its early existence, except for church records on baptism which starts on the year 1796, the same year Malinao became a town. The Spanish decree on change family names for easy identification of inhabitants led to the assignment of the initial letter &#x27;Y&#x27;/ &#x27;I&#x27; for families originating from Malinao.

By the close of the 19th century, the political, economic and even the physical structure of Malinao conform to the classical colonial and feudal set-up existing throughout Christian Philippines. The layout of the Poblacion follows the classical Spanish town plan of the church facing the &quot;municipio&quot; with the plaza in between and streets laid out in grid pattern. The &quot;principalia&quot; partook of choice residential lots around the plaza. Their importance and influence reflected in the proximity of their lots to the center of power.

There was no concentration of land holdings by few families, unlike in other areas of the country. Original families in Malinao have their own pieces of land to work on. The land west of the Aklan River, because of its topography, must have escaped the &quot;encomiendero&quot;s and &quot;haciendero&quot;s in the early part of Spanish colonization.

Despite its seeming ordinariness and unimportance in the national or provincial scheme of things, Malinao rose in prominence during the struggle against colonial rule at the end of the 19th century.

A native of Lilo-an, Malinao, Candido Iban was a member of the inner circle of the original Katipuneros directly under Andres Bonifacio. Candido Iban was the first overseas contract worker from Malinao, diving for pearls in Australia. As luck would have it, he won a considerable sum in a lottery and came back to Manila. He was befriended by Procopio Bonifacio, the brother of Andres, and was inducted as a Katipunero by Andres in the caves of Montalban. The first printing press of the Katipunan was paid for the lottery winnings of Candido Iban.

In 1897, Candido Iban and Francisco Castillo were sent to Aklan to organize the Katipunan in the Visayas. Barrio Lilo-an became the base of the katipunan. And in 1897, believing that the time was ripe for the start of the revolution, eighty-two (82) Katipuneros from Lilo-an marched to the Poblacion to persuade the local authorities to join the revolution. The uprising failed and the leaders captured. Candido Iban, Benito Iban and Gabino Yonsal were among the 19 Martyrs of Aklan executed by the Spanish authorities on March 23, 1897.

A monument of Candido Iban and the failed uprising called &quot;El Levantamiento de los 82 de Lilo-an&quot; stands prominently beside the town hall.

When the Japanese Imperial Army invaded the country during World War II, young men from Malinao were among the first to organize the guerrilla movement in this part of the country. During the Marcos dictatorship, many young Malinaonons took up arms to fight it.

The leadership of the town since the Spanish regime always come from the leading families of the Poblacion. From Juan Nepomuceno in 1792 to Atty. Wilbert Ariel Igoy in 2016, this leadership reflect the political and economic clout of the leading families. Leaders were appointed by Spanish authorities during the Spanish period. When democratic election were started during the American colonial regime, the leading families divided into two factions, each vying for leadership of the town. Whether it is the Nationalista Party or Liberal Party, KBL or Laban, Puersa ng Masa or Lakas, these politicos come from these two factions.

<doc id="322208" wikidata="Q5309077" url="?curid=322208" title="Drum and bugle corps (classic)">
<text>Classic drum and bugle corps are musical ensembles that descended from military bugle and drum units returning from World War I and succeeding wars. Traditionally, drum and bugle corps served as signaling units as early as before the American Civil War, with these signaling units having descended in some fashion from ancient drum and fife corps. With the advent of the radio, bugle signaling units became obsolete and surplus equipment was sold to veteran organizations (such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion, two major organizers for classic drum corps). These organizations formed drum and bugle corps of civilians and veterans, and the corps performed in community events and local celebrations. Over time, rivalries between corps emerged and the competitive drum and bugle corps circuit evolved.

The term &quot;classic&quot; is used for the purposes of this article to differentiate it from modern drum and bugle corps, using the time period of the establishment of Drum Corps International as a dividing point in the timeline of the two types of drum and bugle corps. Modern drum and bugle corps are a continuation of the classic variety, for all intents and purposes, having the same origins, though some corps in the &quot;classic&quot; model do still exist.

Traditionally, drum and bugle corps consisted of bell-front brass horns, field drums, a color guard, and an honor guard. Drum and bugle corps have often been mistaken for marching bands, since there is a similarity to both groups having horns and drums; and they are both essentially bands of musicians that march. The activities are different in organization (marching bands usually associate with high schools and colleges while drum corps are freestanding organizations), competition and performance (marching bands perform in the fall at football games, drum corps usually compete during the summer), and instrumentation (drum corps use only brass bugles and drums, marching bands incorporate woodwinds and other alternative instruments).

== History ==

Within the mainland United States drum and bugle corps can trace their origins to the many Veterans of Foreign Wars (&quot;VFW&quot;) and American Legion (&quot;AL&quot;) meeting halls, where First World War and Spanish–American War veterans met and formed musical ensembles to entertain their communities, some of them being veterans of drum and bugle/field trumpet ensembles within the armed forces (Army, Marine Corps and Navy). The tradition of these military ensembles would later be adopted by civilian groups beginning in the 1880s, and no less than John Philip Sousa saw their potential, for these formations he wrote his first book, &quot;Trumpet and Drum&quot;, which included his own compositions for such formations. In addition to VFW- and AL-sponsored corps, other drum corps were founded by Boy Scouts of America troops (such as the corps that would become the modern-day corps: the Racine Scouts, The Cavaliers and the Madison Scouts), Elks lodges, YMCAs, the Catholic Youth Organization, Police Athletic Leagues (such as would found the Bluecoats), fire fighter organizations, and local businesses, as well as Churches, grammar schools, high schools and colleges. By far, Church-sponsored organizations predominated the drum corp circuits in the eastern coast states. In addition, the touring concerts of the drum and bugle band of the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada regiment of the Canadian Army Primary Reserve, which by then was among the pioneer bands of that type in North America, would also be an inspiration for the formation of early military and civil corps in the 1910s and 1920s, spurred on with the 1934 formation of what is now today the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps.

Rivalries between corps led to a shift towards competition and the AL and VFW both ran successful competition circuits through the late 1960s and early 1970s.

With improved national transportation trends by the 1960s, drum and bugle corps proliferated, both in the sheer numbers of both new and established corps across North America, in the many competitions held then, and in the stadium attendance counts.

At this time, however, there was unrest among some directors and instructors who were critical of the competition-rules committees of the veterans&#x27; organizations which governed and sanctioned state and national championship competitions.

The payment structure for shows was weighted so that the corps with the highest placement got the most prize money; corps who attended shows from great distances but placed poorly were at times left with financial losses, and some corps sought a fixed payment structure for all participating corps.

The second major reason was the desire by the some corps to have more control over their competitive performances. As an example, at the height of the Vietnam War a 1971 show by the Garfield Cadets drew criticisms from VFW organizers over a formation where the corps formed a large peace sign, which angered the staff of that corps over its loss of &quot;artistic freedom&quot;. Both the Combine and Drum Corps International demanded that corps themselves should control rulemaking decisions.

The VFW and American Legion rules differed to a degree (although American Legion rules predominated in nearly every contest) and pressure increased to find a common judging system. Concerns were also voiced over contest promoters&#x27; rights in choosing sponsors and judges, and complaints arose regarding the lack of self-governance of competition circuits. The dissenters also expressed reservations about the increasing numbers of independent non-corps-sponsored competitions.

Some corps managers, directors and instructors walked out of the 1969 VFW national rules committee meeting after their requests for major rules changes were not approved, and some of the protesting participants then formed the by-invitation-only (and short-lived) Midwest Combine in 1971. In 1972, Drum Corps International was founded, and was designed to create one uniform, corps-governed competitive circuit for junior drum and bugle corps (members aged twenty-one or less). DCI formed its own rules-governing body and enacted membership fees causing further disparity between startup drum corps and more professional units. This milestone event marked the beginning of the modern drum corps era.

Most of the still-numerous North American competitive corps joined in the movement of change under new leadership, and by the mid-1970s the rapid introduction and proliferation into competitive drum and bugle corps of previously-unfamiliar innovations (on-field dancing, creative costuming, novelty effects and unusual instrumentation) effectively ended the Classic competitive era.

== Instrumentation ==

=== Bugles ===
With the widespread use of the 1892 Army field trumpet, which was actually a &quot;straight&quot; (valveless) bugle in the key of G, American drum &amp; bugle corps evolved in that key. However, some members in some corps wished to add more notes to their brass repertoire. Some corps in the 1920s added D crooks on some horns in order to play more complicated songs in two lines, similar to a handbell ensemble. Ludwig added the first valve to a bugle to make the G-D horn-in-one, wisely making the valve horizontal rather than vertical in order to preserve the look and handling of the straight bugle (and to make it more difficult to spot by unobservant judges in circuits which had not yet legalized the valve). The single horizontal valve allowed the diatonic scale to be played by each bugle. While those of the Army sported tabards of their reporting units or commands, only several civil corps carried the tabards of their affiliated organization on their bugles.

The acceptance of the single-valved bugle took some time. Originally, the American Legion required that valved bugles have screws to allow the valve to be locked onto either the G or D open scale during certain competitions. Some smaller corps had straight bugles even into the 1960s, and there are still some corps, bands and other groups who continue to use straight bugles or G-D piston bugles to this day, as entire horn lines or as bugle sections.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, inventive buglers across the country took to sanding one of the tuning slides so it could be used like a trombone slide. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, the slide was sometimes replaced with a half-tone rotary valve to F#, which allowed for nearly a full chromatic scale to be played. Some bass-baritones were equipped with full-tone rotary valves to F in order for some of the hornline to be able to achieve the desired Bugle Low A, and in the mid-1960s a bass-baritone rotor to E was briefly offered.

By 1967, the American Legion Uniformed Groups Rules Congress approved a mutual request by a number of instructors and managers to permit G-F-F# piston-rotor bugles in competition. This lighter bugle is able to achieve better intonation and a more complete chromatic scale than the G-D-F# bugles.

Slide-piston and/or rotor-piston bugles were common into the mid-1970s, and many non-competitive parade corps still existed that used straight bugles and single-valved models.

Manufacture of horizontal-piston bugles ceased in the 1990s, as most bugles were being sold to DCI drum corps, which legalized two-valved vertical piston instruments in 1977 and three-valved instruments in 1987.

The main advantages of horizontal-valved one-piston-with-slide and/or piston-rotor bugles include:

# Ease of learning. The basic simplicity of the instrument allows for the possibility of rapid mastery by beginners
# Substantially lower cost
# Lightness
# Ease of repair

Additions to drum and bugle corps voicings occurred in the mid-1930s with the popularity of the baritone bugle, pitched one octave below the soprano.

The tenor bugle also came into use at about this time, and although it was pitched in the soprano range, its slightly larger bore offered a darker, almost cornet-like and more robust tone. The tenor bugle fell from general favor by 1960 though they remained in bugle catalogs.

French horn bugles became popular by mid-century, serving as bridges between sopranos and baritones.

By 1950 a few bass-baritone bugles began to be seen. These larger euphonium-like instruments, pitched like the baritone one octave below the soprano and tenor, added a deep foundation. By 1960, the bass-baritones had largely supplanted the baritones in most corps.

One widely applauded and popular 1962 addition was the contrabass, the biggest horn and lowest voice, two octaves below the soprano, which partially rests on the shoulder.

The mellophone or mellophonium was introduced soon after, and was quickly popular for its capability of soaring above the rest of the bugle section. However it did not supplant the French horn, which remained the dominant middle voice.

Other less-popular bugle types introduced in the 1960 included herald trumpet bugles, euphoniums, pistonless slide sopranos and piccolo bugles or &quot;angel bugles&quot; pitched an octave above the sopranos. The valve-rotor bugle remained popular until the late 1970s, when rules changes moved toward two-valve upright bugles.

=== Drum lines ===

Classic corps drum lines of the 1950s and 1960s used fewer exotic percussion instruments and relied instead on the stadium-filling power of a traditional line (or &quot;battery&quot;) consisting of six or eight by double-tension maple snare and tenor drum shells and two or occasionally three by bass drums with an ornamental shell covering of hard plastic in a glossy sparkle or pearlescent finish.

Until 1965, usually only one cymbalist was used in the field corps although two or even three cymbalists were not uncommon, especially on parade.

Until 1963, bass drummers used one stick or mallet and provided the foundation note in the battery. But in that year, drum instructors nationwide added two-stick rudimental bass-drumming to their drumlines, a historic style adopted from fife and drum corps. While rudimental bass drummers now had more to do, the one-stick bass drummers were often kept on as &quot;foundation bass&quot; or &quot;straight bass&quot; (also as standard bass) drummers. (In the 1930s and 1940s, those corps bass drummers using two mallets were termed as scotch bass drummers.)

Until 1965 single tenor drums were commonplace in some corps, the single tenor drum, beaten by 2 soft or hard mallets in the tradition of British corps of drums, served in the same role as the snare drums but without the snares below. The action of beating the mallets was following the British, Dutch or US Marine Corps practice, in which the tenor drummers played their drums as either flourishing tenors following British precedence or rhythm tenors similar to snares. The first multiple tenor drums appeared in 1966 and would be adopted by many corps in later years. A few corps even mounted glockenspiel in the vertical bell lyre form as part of their percussion unit.

The older-type, less-expensive and lighter single-tension drums, such as most corps used through the 1940s, were most often ordered for novice and feeder &quot;cadet&quot; corps.

Until 1956, drum heads were of stretched unborn calfskin, but beginning in 1957 the Ludwig Drum Company introduced mylar drum heads that gave a crisper sound and were impervious to damp weather.

The movement in classic corps is to drums which retain the Golden Age&#x27;s unique sound.

== Color guard and Honor guard/drill team ==
The color guard and non-musical marching members in drum &amp; bugle corps largely developed out of military honor guards. Over the years, some corps have included baton majors and majorettes — but largely, the auxiliary units have consisted of tall flag carriers (8&#x27; foot pikes), rifles (developed from military rifle drill teams) and saber squads.

The drum &amp; bugle corps still maintains an honor squad, consisting of the corps&#x27; country&#x27;s National Flag and &quot;protectors&quot;, or &quot;sidearms&quot;. Often, the honor squad will contain rifle or saber carriers, or carriers of sponsors/posts&#x27; flags and if needed, the honorary flags of the corps&#x27; past championships. Sometimes the &quot;sidearm&quot; member is just that — someone who sports a gun holster.

In the 1960s and prior, most color guards tended to be small, consisting of a few squads. As most big corps — again, with exceptions — were often all-male, many color guards were all-female in order to provide a marching opportunity for young women. There have, however, been many all-girl and all-male corps throughout drum and bugle corps&#x27; rich history, up to the present times. But prior to 1960, there were far more, which provided competitive opportunities for those corps who wished them, often without the touring requirements of today. And some units/areas of the country had mixed-gender corps going back decades.

In the modern era, now that gender is culturally less divisive and the requirements of corps memberships being military veterans (to a certain percentage) is uncommon, sections are much more rarely limited by gender. Mostly during the late 1960s, flag lines in particular mushroomed in size. During the days of execution drill, wherein yard lines on football fields were more rare and optional, the color guard often was an integral part of drill &quot;dress&quot; (positioning by sight, interval and direction).

Unlike the color guard, drill teams or honor guards in the DBCs of the 1960s were male-dominated, with mock rifles and sabres used.

== Drum majors ==
The field leader in drum &amp; bugle corps is called a drum major. Some corps appoint more than one, but there is usually one designated chief drum major who leads the corps in both marching direction and musical direction. Traditional corps drum majors are effective showmen who command the corps in all venues. Early in the 20th Century, commands were usually issued either through a mace or baton, and/or with whistle signals. Eventually this evolved into vocal commands and manual signals, although military units still maintain the baton-signaling methods.

== Performance ==

A drum and bugle corps performance consists of the playing of music, usually accompanied by marching on parade, in field-drill formation(s) or in a standstill performance. It is similar to that of a marching band, but more in line with military presentation and heritage. Further, perfection of execution is more traditional to drum &amp; bugle corps. A marching band takes instruments which are used indoors and takes them outside in order to participate in outdoor ceremonies. A drum &amp; bugle corps took outdoor instruments and remained outdoors, occasionally going inside for &quot;standstill&quot; concerts.

Drum and bugle corps is, traditionally, a musical activity which extended the camaraderie of combat to a musical &quot;battle&quot; on (football)-sized fields. The evolution and perceived &quot;politics&quot; of judging, however, has led most &quot;classic&quot; corps to move to exhibition-only performances which not only avoids judging preferences and politics but also cuts the costs of performing and of producing field presentations.

Until the 1960s, competitive shows traditionally began with an inspection — owing to the corps&#x27; military heritage — to ensure all on the field were qualified to compete, and that the uniforms and equipment were presentable according to standards. Scoring was done by circuit-approved judges which considered performance and overall effect in both music and movement.

Classic-era drum and bugle corps emphasized the stages of their presentations (beginning, middle and end) by their location on the field. A performance typically begins with the corps stepping &quot;off the line&quot; (the left goal line on a standard American football field).

The corps signals its readiness to the audience and judges by a drum major&#x27;s salute. At the first step or note of music, the timekeeper will fire a timing pistol to designate the official start of post-inspection judging.(The timing pistol will be used again as an eleven-minute warning to designate the end of the minimum time permitted for the field performance.)

The corps might perform an &quot;opening fanfare&quot;, followed by an &quot;off the line&quot; number which takes the corps to mid-field. The next traditional number is a &quot;color presentation&quot; or &quot;color pre&quot; (presenting the national flag according to the United States Flag Code). Following the presentation of the colors is an &quot;into concert&quot; or &quot;park and Bark&quot; piece which takes the corps into a concert formation (usually played standing still). Then, an &quot;out of concert number&quot; follows. There is the &quot;exit&quot; piece off the field — the opposite sideline, followed by the final fanfare, often but not always played at a standstill.

The corps then reconfigures into a single or double file and proceeds to &quot;troop the stands&quot; - marching from the audience&#x27;s right to its left in columns close to the main grandstands while saluting, to the accompaniment of the drumline. Rarely, the bugles may offer an encore tune at this time.

The corps members then will be at liberty until the final corps is on the field, and then will again muster for the massed &quot;retreat&quot; ceremony at which all the participating corps re-enter the field simultaneously, each usually in its own parade formation as only one corps &quot;plays them on&quot;.

As the music and motion halts, the field announcer summons the corps&#x27; commanding officers to center front, recognitions are made, and lastly the scores (if this was a judged contest) are announced. Each corps then marches off individually with its own music in order of placement, and the winning corps often remains, continuing to perform.

=== Example competition rules ===
The type of competitive rules drum and bugle corps used to compete under are exemplified by the following example from the All-American Judging Association:

;Drum &amp; Bugle Corps Rules — June 29, 1958

* A minimum drill of 11 minutes, a maximum 13 minutes.
* All judging will continue through entire performance.
# Inspection. Condition of uniforms, equipment and general appearance as a military unit. All instruments used must be on the inspection line. Total penalty will be deducted from the General Effect score.
# Musical quality of bugles or fifes...25%
# Excellence of drumming...25%
# Marching and maneuvering (M&amp;M)...30%
# General effect...20%
* A penalty of two points will be deducted from the total score for each minute or fraction thereof for over or under time on the field.
* If a member of the corps proper steps over the side boundary, a penalty of one point for each error will be assessed.
* A two-point penalty for any breach of the flag code.
* All competing drum and bugle corps must march in the parade and appear in the grand finale to qualify for competition and prizes.

== Break between &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; corps ==
To many, the late 1960s marked a high point in American drum corps activity and participation. Based on a meeting in 1970, a group of five corps of that era met to organize a by-invitation-only cooperative group that took on the working title of &quot;The Combine&quot;.

The Combine&#x27;s member corps all agreed to demand, starting in the 1971 competitive season, a fixed and predetermined appearance fee from contest sponsors where Combine corps would compete, rather than accept traditional prize money awards dependent on contest placements.

Contest audiences of 1971 also noticed that some Combine corps were attempting &quot;Total Programs&quot; - a phrase describing daring, controversial theme-based competitive innovations in costuming, marching and music that were clearly different and more radical than the then-standard norms.

From the Combine soon evolved the more structured, open-membership Drum Corps International (DCI). The first DCI National competition was held at Warhawk Stadium at Whitewater, Wisconsin in August 1972.

Beginning in the early 1970s, many corps chose to become members of DCI or DCA (the &quot;modern&quot; drum corps organizations), often driven by the withdrawal of support by their traditional veterans-group or church sponsors, although by this point in time the traditional sponsors were in many cases already withdrawing their support of the activity due to financial difficulties. The increased requirements of time and money to participate in DCI and DCA circuits proved prohibitive for many non-profit organizations with other primary missions. Groups without adequate funding did not survive. Many other groups chose not to move to the new style, citing tradition or principle. It was at this point that &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; drum and bugle corps became two very different activities.

Since the mid-1980s the classic drum corps movement has continued to grow with approximately forty such American corps currently active. Several of these corps incorporate the word &quot;Alumni&quot; into their name, though previous membership in a classic era corps is often not required. However, not all Alumni Corps or Senior Corps are classic corps; organizations such as the Bridgemen Alumni Corps and the Defenders Alumni Corps follow the modern corps style.

Most current classic corps are intended to serve as tributes and to remember the heritage of the Golden Age. Even so, they still are usually made up of people from a much larger area than the immediate city each represents.

The main Classic corps organization is the East-coast-based Great Alliance Seniors (GAS). Forsaking competitive judging, the GAS-affiliated corps meet to rehearse, socialize, and perform to parade, standstill and field-exhibition audiences.

<text>A medication overuse headache (MOH), also known as a rebound headache, usually occurs when painkillers are taken frequently to relieve headaches. These cases are often referred to as painkiller headaches. Rebound headaches frequently occur daily, can be very painful and are a common cause of chronic daily headache. They typically occur in patients with an underlying headache disorder such as migraine or tension-type headache that &quot;transforms&quot; over time from an episodic condition to chronic daily headache due to excessive intake of acute headache relief medications.
MOH is a serious, disabling and well-characterized disorder, which represents a worldwide problem and is now considered the third-most prevalent type of headache. The proportion of patients in the population with Chronic Daily Headache (CDH) who overuse acute medications ranges from 18% to 33%. The prevalence of medication overuse headache (MOH) varies depending on the population studied and diagnostic criteria used. However, it is estimated that MOH affects approximately 1-2% of the general population, but its relative frequency is much higher in secondary and tertiary care.

==Classification==
Medication overuse headache is a recognized ICHD (International Classification of Headache Disorders) classification. Over the years different sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed and revised by the major experts of headache disorders. The term MOH first appeared in the ICHD 2nd edition in 2004. It was defined as a secondary headache, with the aim of emphasising excessive drug intake as the basis of this form of headache. The two subsequent revisions of the diagnostic criteria for MOH (2005 and 2006) refined and extended the definition of the condition on the basis of both its chronicity (headache on more than 15 days/month for more than three months) and drug classes, thereby identifying the main types of MOH. In the case of ergotamine, triptans, opioids and combination medications in particular, intake on &gt; 10 days/month for &gt; 3 months is required, whereas simple analgesics are considered overused when they are taken on &gt; 15 days/month for &gt;3 months.

==Causes==

MOH is known to occur with frequent use of many different medications, including most commonly: triptans, ergotamines, simple and combination analgesics, and opioids. Common over-the-counter medicines that can cause headaches when overused include Excedrin Migraine, Cafergot, and Advil. Dietary and medicinal caffeine consumption appears to be a modest risk factor for chronic daily headache onset, regardless of headache type.

A lifelong history of headaches is a major risk factor for MOH. MOH is very rare in patients without a history of recurrent headaches, and it rarely develops in patients who take analgesics for non-headache pain, like arthritis or irritable bowel syndrome. Furthermore, MOH is more probable when a family history of MOH is present, thus indicating a genetic susceptibility. It is thought that rebound headaches are caused by a neuronal re-adjustment process. Analgesic intake raises the pain threshold. Thus, lacking pain stimuli for longer times, the brain re-calibrates to experience normal stimuli as pain.

The time it takes for someone to develop medication overuse headaches (MOH) after taking medication too often depends on the type of medication they are using. If someone is taking triptans (such as Sumatriptan etc.), it may take about 1.7 years for them to develop MOH. If they are taking ergots (such as Ergotamine etc.), it may take about 2.7 years, and if they are taking analgesics (such as Naproxen etc.), it may take about 4.8 years. So, the delay between taking medication too often and developing MOH varies based on the type of medication being used.

The underlying mechanisms that lead to the development of the condition are still widely unknown and clarification of their role is hampered by a lack of experimental research or suitable animal models. Various pathophysiological abnormalities have been reported and they seem to have an important role in initiating and maintaining chronic headache (genetic disposition, receptor and enzyme physiology and regulation, psychological and behavioural factors, physical dependencies, recent functional imaging results).

In some cases, individuals may be genetically predisposed to developing medication overuse headache. A PET study in patients with chronic analgesic overuse showed decreased activity in the orbitofrontal cortex of the brain, which is also seen in substance abuse. This suggests that there may be an underlying neurological susceptibility to addiction in some individuals. However, more research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay of factors that contribute to the development of MOH.

===Headache treatment===
Opioids and butalbital are sometimes inappropriately used as treatment for migraine and headache and should be avoided in favor of more effective, migraine-specific treatments. Opioid and butalbital use can worsen headaches and cause MOH. When a patient fails to respond to other treatment or migraine specific treatment is unavailable, then opioids may be used.

Regular use of over-the-counter drugs (OTC) such as paracetamol and NSAIDs can also be a cause of MOH. OTC medication for headache should be limited to use for not more than two days weekly, and it is recommended to seek medical counsel when any pain lasts more than a few days. Concurrent with MOH, overuse of acetaminophen (known as paracetamol in some countries) for treating headaches risks causing liver damage and NSAID overuse can cause gastrointestinal bleeding.

==Prevention==
In general, any patient who has frequent headaches or migraine attacks should be considered as a potential candidate for preventive medications instead of being encouraged to take more and more painkillers or other rebound-causing medications. Preventive medications are taken on a daily basis. Some patients may require preventive medications for many years; others may require them for only a relatively short period of time such as six months. Effective preventive medications have been found to come from many classes of medications including neuronal stabilizing agents (aka anticonvulsants), antidepressants, antihypertensives, and antihistamines. Some effective preventive medications include Elavil (amitriptyline), Depakote (valproate), Topamax (topiramate), and Inderal (propranolol).

==Treatment==
MOH is common and can be treated. The overused medications must be stopped for the patient&#x27;s headache to resolve, though there is limited evidence to suggest this can be done without using other preventive measures. Clinical data shows that the treatment of choice is abrupt drugs withdrawal, followed by starting prophylactic therapy. However, the discontinuation of overused drugs may lead to the initial worsening of headaches, nausea, vomiting, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and restlessness. These symptoms greatly depend on the previously overused drugs and typically last from two to ten days. They are relieved by the further intake of the overused medication, which might reinforce the continuation of overuse and noncompliance toward discontinuation. Where physical dependence or a rebound effect such as rebound headache is possible, gradual reduction of medication may be necessary. It is important that the patient&#x27;s physician be consulted before abruptly discontinuing certain medications as such a course of action has the potential to induce medically significant physical withdrawal symptoms. Abruptly discontinuing butalbital, for example, can actually induce seizures in some patients, although simple over the counter analgesics can safely be stopped by the patient without medical supervision. A long-acting analgesic/anti-inflammatory, such as naproxen (500 mg twice a day), can be used to ease headache during the withdrawal period. Two months after the completion of a medication withdrawal, patients with MOH typically notice a marked reduction in headache frequency and intensity.

Drug withdrawal is performed very differently within and across countries. Most physicians prefer inpatients programmes, however effective drug withdrawal may also be achieved in an outpatient setting in uncomplicated MOH patients (i.e. subjects without important co-morbidities, not overusing opioids or ergotaminics and who are at their first detoxification attempt). In the absence of evidence-based indications, in MOH patients the choice of preventive agent should be based on the primary headache type (migraine or TTH), on the drug side-effect profile, on the presence of co-morbid and co-existent conditions, on patient&#x27;s preferences, and on previous therapeutic experiences.

Following an initial improvement of headache with the return to an episodic pattern, a relevant proportion (up to 45%) of patients relapse, reverting to the overuse of symptomatic drugs.

Predictors of the relapse, and that could influence treatment strategies, are considered the type of primary headache, from which MOH has evolved, and the type of drug abused (analgesics, and mostly combination of analgesics, but also drugs containing barbiturates or tranquillisers cause significantly higher relapse rates), while gender, age, duration of disease and previous intake of preventative treatment do not seem to predict relapse rate.

MOH is clearly a cause of disability and, if not adequately treated, it represents a condition of risk of possible co-morbidities associated to the excessive intake of drugs that are not devoid of side-effect. MOH can be treated through withdrawal of the overused drug(s) and by means of specific approaches that focus on the development of a close doctor-patient relationship in the post-withdrawal period.

==History==
Rebound headache was first described by Dr. Lee Kudrow in 1982.

<text>Kevin Aviance (born Eric Snead on June 22, 1968) is an American drag queen, club/dance musician, fashion designer, and nightclub personality. He is a personality in New York City&#x27;s gay scene and has performed throughout North America, Europe and Asia. He is a member of the House of Aviance, one of the most notable vogue-ball houses in the U.S. He is known for his trademark phrase, &quot;Work. Fierce. Over. Aviance!&quot; He won the 1998 and 1999 Glammy Awards, the award for nightlife personalities in New York City. He has worked with several artists, including Janet Jackson and Whitney Houston. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; ranked him as the 93rd most successful dance artist of all time.

== Career ==
Aviance was raised in Richmond, Virginia, in a close-knit family of eight siblings. His father provided for them as a landscape contractor. From an early age, Aviance dedicated himself to the study of music and theatre, his first experience in drag was in the seventh grade. His early influences were &quot;punk, Boy George, Devo, and Grace Jones&quot;. He moved to Washington D.C. where he worked as a hairdresser and did drag performances. He developed a bad crack habit but with help of the House of Aviance he was able to overcome it, after his initiation in the house he took the name Kevin Aviance. He later moved to New York City and made a name for himself as a dancer/performer at Sound Factory, a club mainly for queer Latinos and Blacks. Major DJs and club promoters saw him performing and started hiring him, he became one of a handful of drag performers in NYC able to support themselves solely on performances. His career as a performance artist and club personality began in Washington, DC, continued in Miami, and eventually landed him in New York City. The House of Aviance was founded in 1989 (in Washington, DC) by Mother Juan Aviance. Kevin is regarded as Mother Juan and the House&#x27;s &quot;oldest daughter&quot;. In 1993, Aviance, who was living in Florida at the time, was asked to move to New York City by Mother Juan. He accepted his House Mother&#x27;s request and shortly after landed a cameo role in Madonna&#x27;s 1994 &quot;Secret&quot; video. In July 1999, Aviance performed as part of Billboard&#x27;s sixth annual Dance Music Summit.

Aviance has appeared in several films, including &quot;Flawless&quot; starring Robert De Niro and the independent film &quot;Punks&quot;. Besides his feature-film work he has made guest appearances on such shows as &quot;The Tyra Banks Show&quot;, and &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, also hosted by Tyra Banks, and worked with artists like Janet Jackson and Whitney Houston. His songs &quot;Din Da Da&quot;, &quot;Rhythm Is My Bitch&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Give It Up&quot; and &quot;Strut&quot;, have all reached Number 1 of the Billboard dance chart. The only one of his singles not to peak at Number 1 to date is &quot;Dance for Love&quot;. Aviance&#x27;s most successful dance radio hit to date is &quot;Give It Up&quot; released in 2004. His second album, &quot;Entity&quot; is a more consistent effort than his first.

== Hate crime incident ==
On June 10, 2006, while exiting the Phoenix, a popular gay bar located in the East Village section of Manhattan, Aviance was robbed and beaten by a group of men who yelled anti-gay slurs at him. Four suspects were arrested under New York&#x27;s hate-crime law, but reports say up to seven men were involved in the attack. Aviance was not dressed in his gender-bending performance clothes but as a boy. He had to have his jaw wired for a month. He also suffered a fractured knee and neck injuries as well as blows to the face. Despite suffering a broken jaw, he insisted on appearing in the city&#x27;s gay pride parade later that month.

The four suspects, who ranged between 17 and 21 years old, were charged with gang assault as a hate crime. On March 21, 2007, they pleaded guilty and were sentenced to between six and fifteen years in prison. Without the plea agreement, they had faced up to 25 years. In 2015, Canadian filmmaker Raymond Helkio produced the documentary &quot;WERK. FIERCE. OVAH. Aviance!&quot; which premiered at the 2018 NYC East Village Queer Film Festival.

== Recent times ==

Recently, Aviance appeared on the song &quot;This is New York City (Bitch!)&quot; by the transgender rap group La&#x27;Mady from the album &quot;Jonny McGovern Presents: This is NYC, Bitch! The East Village Mixtape&quot;. In 2007, Aviance&#x27;s song &quot;Strut&quot; was featured as the theme song for the documentary series &quot;Indie Sex&quot;. In April 2008, Aviance staged a comeback to the club scene and entertainment world, and was reunited on stage with Junior Vasquez, who previously worked together but had become estranged over a professional dispute. At Cielo, a club in New York known for its lighted walls, the tandem performance marked the return to the spotlight for Aviance, performing two of his new hit singles. He most recently recorded a cover of Britney Spears&#x27;s &quot;Gimme More&quot;, produced by Jonny McGovern and Adam Joseph on &quot;The East Village Mixtape 2: The Legends Ball&quot;. In 2022, Aviance&#x27;s hit song &quot;Cunty&quot; was sampled for 15 seconds on Beyoncé&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Renaissance&quot; for the track &quot;Pure/Honey&quot;.

<text>James Alan Bidgood (March 28, 1933 – January 31, 2022), also known by the pseudonym Les Folies des Hommes, was an American filmmaker, photographer and visual and performance artist, known for his highly stylized and homoerotic works.

== Life and career ==

James Alan Bidgood was born in Stoughton, Wisconsin, and grew up in Madison, Wisconsin. He moved to New York City in 1951, and attended Parsons The New School for Design in the late 1950s. His artistic output embraced a number of media and disciplines, including music, set and window design, and drag performance. He got his start performing at East Village drag club Club 82, using the stage name Terri Howe.

His interests led him to photography and film and it is for this work that he is most widely known. His photographs are distinguished by an aesthetic of high fantasy and camp, inspired by an early interest in Florenz Ziegfeld, Folies Bergère, and George Quaintance. He wanted to bring artistry to gay male erotic photography, believing that the genre at the time he started out had not been pushed to its limits. He explained in a 2005 interview:

Bidgood released the film &quot;Pink Narcissus&quot; in 1971, after filming in his small apartment from 1963 to 1970. The film is a dialogue-free fantasy centered around a young and often naked man. The film took seven years to make, and Bidgood built all the sets and filmed the entire piece in his tiny apartment. He later removed his name from the film because he felt editors had changed his original vision. Consequently, the identity of the film&#x27;s creator was only a matter of speculation for nearly three decades after its release, with Andy Warhol frequently floated as a candidate. It was not until 1998 that writer Bruce Benderson decided to investigate the matter, and eventually traced them to Bidgood, then living on 14th Street in Manhattan. Through a friend who was an agent, Benderson arranged publication of Bidgood&#x27;s output under his own name for the first time and also wrote the first complete monograph on Bidgood, which was published by Taschen. Bidgood&#x27;s film &quot;Pink Narcissus&quot; was re-released in 2003 by Strand Releasing.

When the pornographic film industry began to blossom in the early 1970s, Bidgood signed with Hand in Hand Films, a burgeoning gay production company with only a handful of films to its name, to produce his second film. 

&quot;Beyond These Doors&quot; was to feature Bidgood&#x27;s lush and colourful photography showcased in scenes of hardcore pornography. However, for unknown reasons, the film was only partially completed and is considered lost. One excerpt of an orgy scene from the film can be seen in the 1975 porn documentary &quot;Good Hot Stuff,&quot; which showcases the footage under the working title &quot;Baghdad.&quot; After the negative experience, Bidgood effectively left the film industry.

When a profile on Bidgood was written by Artforum in 2019, the author noted that at the time of publishing the piece, he &quot;lives in poverty in New York City.&quot;

Bidgood&#x27;s work is characterized by a heavy reliance on invention. His photographs feature elaborate sets built ground up from the materials of the theatre, fashion, design, and fine art. In a profile of the artist published in &quot;Aperture&quot;, Philip Gefter wrote,

Many contemporary themes are found even in the earliest of Bidgood&#x27;s work. Camp, identity, erotica, desire, marginality, and performance all figure heavily in his portraits of nude men. Bidgood&#x27;s complex references to the theatre and performance seem to presage Queer articulations of Performance. His techniques, working processes, and masterful use of illusionistic color indicate both a mature understanding of his influences and goals and an important contrast to the art movements of the time the work was first created.
In 1999, the art book publisher Taschen published a monograph of his work including biographical images and stills from his film.

In 2005, Bidgood was honored with a Creative Capital grant which facilitated a return to art photography after a hiatus of nearly 40 years. His later projects include work for Christian Louboutin and &quot;Out&quot; magazine.
In 2008, Taschen included an interview with Bidgood in its publication &quot;The Big Penis Book&quot;, and published his monograph in 2009. Bidgood&#x27;s more recent work was featured in &quot;Out&quot; in February 2009. Bidgood was represented by ClampArt in New York City, as well as Larry Collins Fine Art in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

Bidgood died from complications of COVID-19 at a Manhattan hospital, on January 31, 2022, at age 88.

Bidgood is often credited as inspiration for photographic artists, including Pierre et Gilles and David LaChapelle. He was also an inspiration for and once collaborated with designer Christian Louboutin.

== Personal life ==
Bidgood met his partner Alan Blair in 1975. They would be together for 10 years until Blair&#x27;s death in 1985.

<doc id="322221" wikidata="Q1138777" url="?curid=322221" title="National debt of the United States">
<text>The national debt of the United States is the total national debt owed by the federal government of the United States to treasury security holders. The national debt at a given point in time is the face value of the then outstanding treasury securities that have been issued by the Treasury and other federal agencies. 

Related terms such as &quot;national deficit&quot; and &quot;national surplus&quot; most often refer to the federal government budget balance from year to year and not the cumulative amount of debt held. In a deficit year the national debt increases as the government needs to borrow funds to finance the deficit. In a surplus year the debt decreases as more money is received than spent, enabling the government to reduce the debt by buying back Treasury securities. Broadly, US government debt increases as a result of government spending and decreases from tax or other funding receipts, both of which fluctuate during the course of a fiscal year. The aggregate, gross amount that Treasury can borrow is limited by the United States debt ceiling.

There are two components of gross national debt:

* &quot;Debt held by the public&quot; – such as Treasury securities held by investors outside the federal government, including those held by individuals, corporations, the Federal Reserve, and foreign, state and local governments.
* &quot;Debt held by government accounts&quot; or &quot;intragovernmental debt&quot; – is non-marketable Treasury securities held in accounts of programs administered by the federal government, such as the Social Security Trust Fund. Debt held by government accounts represents the cumulative surpluses, including interest earnings, of various government programs that have been invested in Treasury securities.
Historically, the U.S. public debt as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) increases during wars and recessions and then subsequently declines. For instance, most recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government spent trillions in virus aid and economic relief. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the budget deficit for fiscal year 2020 would increase to $3.3 trillion or 16% GDP, more than triple that of 2019 and the largest as % GDP since 1945. In December 2021, debt held by the public was estimated at 96.19% of GDP, and approximately 33% of this public debt was owned by foreigners (government and private). 

The ratio of debt to GDP may decrease as a result of a government surplus or via growth of GDP and inflation. The CBO estimated in February 2024 that Federal debt held by the public is projected to rise from 99 percent of GDP in 2024 to 116 percent in 2034, and would continue to grow if current laws generally remained unchanged. Over that period, the growth of interest costs and mandatory spending outpaces the growth of revenues and the economy, driving up debt. If those factors persist beyond 2034, pushing federal debt higher still, to 172 percent of GDP in 2054. 

The United States has the largest external debt in the world. The total amount of U.S. Treasury securities held by foreign entities in December 2021 was $7.7 trillion, up from $7.1 trillion in December 2020.Total US federal government debt breached the $30 trillion mark for the first time in history in February 2022. As of December 2023, total federal debt was $33.1 trillion; $26.5 trillion held by the public and $12.1 trillion in intragovernmental debt. The annualized cost of servicing this debt was $726 billion in July 2023, which accounted for 14% of the total federal spending. Additionally, in recent decades, aging demographics and rising healthcare costs have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government&#x27;s fiscal policies. 

In February 2024, the total federal government debt grew to $34.4 trillion after having grown by approximately $1 trillion in both of two separate 100-day periods since the previous June. As of February 28, 2025 the federal government debt is $36.22 trillion.


==History==

The United States federal government has continuously had a fluctuating public debt since its formation in 1789, except for about a year during 1835–1836, a period in which the nation, during the presidency of Andrew Jackson, completely paid the national debt. To allow comparisons over the years, public debt is often expressed as a ratio to GDP. The United States public debt as a percentage of GDP reached its highest level during Harry Truman&#x27;s first presidential term, during and after World War II. Public debt as a percentage of GDP fell rapidly in the post-World War II period and reached a low in 1974 under Richard Nixon. Debt as a share of GDP has consistently increased since then, except during the presidencies of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.

Public debt rose sharply during the 1980s, as Ronald Reagan negotiated with Congress to cut tax rates and increase military spending. It fell during the 1990s because of decreased military spending, increased taxes and the 1990s boom. Public debt rose sharply during George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency and in the wake of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, with resulting significant tax revenue declines and spending increases, such as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

In their September 2018 monthly report published on October 5 and based on data from the Treasury Department&#x27;s &quot;Daily Treasury Statements&quot; (DTS), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) wrote that the federal budget deficit was c.$782 billion for the fiscal year 2018—which runs from October 2017 through September 2018. This is $116 billion more than in FY2017. The Treasury statements as summarized by in the CBO report that corporate taxes for 2017 and 2018 declined by $92 billion representing a drop of 31%. The CBO added that &quot;about half of the decline ... occurred since June&quot; when some of the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 took effect, which included the &quot;new lower corporate tax rate and the expanded ability to immediately deduct the full value of equipment purchases&quot;. (~$ in )

According to articles in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Business Insider&quot;, based on documents released on October 29, 2018, by the Treasury Department, the department&#x27;s projection estimated that by the fourth quarter of the FY2018, it would have issued c. $1.338 trillion (~$ in ) in debt. This would have been the highest debt issuance since 2010, when it reached $1.586 trillion (~$ in ). The Treasury anticipated that the total &quot;net marketable debt&quot;—net marketable securities—issued in the fourth quarter would reach $425 billion; which would raise the 2018 &quot;total debt issuance&quot; to over a trillion dollars of new debt, representing a &quot;146% jump from 2017&quot;. According to the &quot;Journal&quot; that is the highest fourth quarter issuance &quot;since 2008, at the height of the financial crisis.&quot; As cited by the &quot;Journal&quot; and the &quot;Business Insider&quot;, the primary drivers of new debt issuance are &quot;stagnant&quot;, &quot;sluggish tax revenues&quot;, a decrease in &quot;corporate tax revenue&quot;, due to the GOP Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the &quot;bipartisan budget agreement&quot;, and &quot;higher government spending&quot;.

==Valuation and Measurement Measures==
===Public and government accounts===

As of February 28, 2025 debt held by the public was $28.91 trillion, and intragovernmental holdings were $7.31 trillion, for a total of $36.22 trillion. Debt held by the public was approximately 77% of GDP in 2017, ranked 43rd highest out of 207 countries. The CBO forecast in April 2018 that the ratio will rise to nearly 100% by 2028, perhaps higher if current policies are extended beyond their scheduled expiration date.

The national debt can also be classified into marketable or non-marketable securities. Most of the marketable securities are Treasury notes, bills, and bonds held by investors and governments globally. The non-marketable securities are mainly the &quot;government account series&quot; owed to certain government trust funds such as the Social Security Trust Fund, which represented $2.82 trillion (~$ in ) in 2017.

The non-marketable securities represent amounts owed to program beneficiaries. For example, in the cash upon receipt but spent for other purposes. If the government continues to run deficits in other parts of the budget, the government will have to issue debt held by the public to fund the Social Security Trust Fund, in effect exchanging one type of debt for the other. Other large intragovernmental holders include the Federal Housing Administration, the Federal Savings and Loan Corporation&#x27;s Resolution Fund and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Medicare).

===Accounting treatment===
Only debt held by the public is reported as a liability on the consolidated financial statements of the United States government. Debt held by US government accounts is an asset to those accounts but a liability to the Treasury; they offset each other in the consolidated financial statements. Government receipts and expenditures are normally presented on a cash rather than an accrual basis, although the accrual basis may provide more information on the longer-term implications of the government&#x27;s annual operations. The United States public debt is often expressed as a ratio of public debt to GDP. The ratio of debt to GDP may decrease as a result of a government surplus as well as from growth of GDP and inflation.

===Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac obligations excluded===

Under normal accounting rules, fully owned companies would be consolidated into the books of their owners, but the large size of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has made U.S. governments reluctant to incorporate them into its own books. When the two mortgage companies required bail-outs, White House Budget Director Jim Nussle, on September 12, 2008, initially indicated their budget plans would not incorporate the government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) debt into the budget because of the temporary nature of the conservator intervention. As the intervention has dragged out, some pundits began to question this accounting treatment, noting that changes in August 2012 &quot;makes them even more permanent wards of the state and turns the government&#x27;s preferred stock into a permanent, perpetual kind of security&quot;.

The federal government controls the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which would normally criticize inconsistent accounting practices, but it does not oversee its own government&#x27;s accounting practices or the standards set by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board. The on- or off-balance sheet obligations of those two independent GSEs was just over $5 trillion at the time the conservatorship was put in place, consisting mainly of mortgage payment guarantees and agency bonds. The confusing &quot;independent but government-controlled&quot; status of the GSEs resulted in investors of the legacy common shares and preferred shares launching various activist campaigns in 2014.

=== Guaranteed obligations excluded ===
U.S. federal government guarantees were not included in the public debt total as they were not drawn against. In late 2008, the federal government had guaranteed large amounts of obligations of mutual funds, banks, and corporations under several programs designed to deal with the problems arising from the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The guarantee program lapsed at the end of 2012, when Congress declined to extend the scheme. The funding of direct investments made in response to the crisis, such as those made under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, was included in the debt totals.

=== Unfunded obligations excluded ===

The U.S. federal government is obligated under current law to make mandatory payments for programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) projects that payouts for these programs will significantly exceed tax revenues over the next 75 years. The Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) payouts already exceed program tax revenues, and social security payouts exceeded payroll taxes in fiscal year 2010. These deficits require funding from other tax sources or borrowing. The present value of these deficits or unfunded obligations is an estimated $45.8 trillion. This is the amount that would have had to be set aside in 2009 in order to pay for the unfunded obligations which, under current law, will have to be raised by the government in the future. Approximately $7.7 trillion relates to Social Security, while $38.2 trillion relates to Medicare and Medicaid. In other words, health care programs will require nearly five times more funding than Social Security. Adding this to the national debt and other federal obligations would bring total obligations to nearly $62 trillion. However, these unfunded obligations are not counted in the national debt, as shown in monthly Treasury reports of the national debt.

=== Measuring burden of debt ===
GDP is a measure of the total size and output of the economy. One measure of the debt burden is its size relative to GDP, called the &quot;debt-to-GDP ratio&quot;. Mathematically, this is the debt divided by the GDP amount. The Congressional Budget Office includes historical budget and debt tables along with its annual &quot;Budget and Economic Outlook&quot;. Debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP rose from 34.7% GDP in 2000 to 40.5% in 2008 and 67.7% in 2011. Mathematically, the ratio can decrease even while debt grows if the rate of increase in GDP (which also takes account of inflation) is higher than the rate of increase of debt. Conversely, the debt to GDP ratio can increase even while debt is being reduced, if the decline in GDP is sufficient.

According to the &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot;, during 2015, the U.S. debt to GDP ratio of 73.6% was the 39th highest in the world. This was measured using &quot;debt held by the public.&quot; However, $1 trillion in additional borrowing since the end of FY 2015 raised the ratio to 76.2% as of April 2016 [See Appendix#National debt for selected years]. Also, this number excludes state and local debt. According to the OECD, general government gross debt (federal, state, and local) in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $22.5 trillion (125% of GDP); subtracting out $5.25 trillion for intragovernmental federal debt to count only federal &quot;debt held by the public&quot; gives 96% of GDP.

The ratio is higher if the total national debt is used, by adding the &quot;intragovernmental debt&quot; to the &quot;debt held by the public.&quot; For example, on April 29, 2016, debt held by the public was approximately $13.84 trillion (~$ in ) or about 76% of GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5.35 trillion, giving a combined total public debt of $19.19 trillion. U.S. GDP for the previous 12 months was approximately $18.15 trillion, for a total debt to GDP ratio of approximately 106%.

===Calculating annual change in debt===

Conceptually, an annual deficit (or surplus) should represent the change in the national debt, with a deficit adding to the national debt and a surplus reducing it. However, there is complexity in the budgetary computations that can make the deficit figure commonly reported in the media (the &quot;total deficit&quot;) considerably different from the annual increase in the debt. The major categories of differences are the treatment of the Social Security program, Treasury borrowing, and supplemental appropriations outside the budget process.

Social Security payroll taxes and benefit payments, along with the net balance of the U.S. Postal Service, are considered &quot;off-budget&quot;, while most other expenditure and receipt categories are considered &quot;on-budget&quot;. The total federal deficit is the sum of the on-budget deficit (or surplus) and the off-budget deficit (or surplus). Since FY1960, the federal government has run on-budget deficits except for FY1999 and FY2000, and total federal deficits except in FY1969 and FY1998–FY2001.

For example, in January 2009 the CBO reported that for FY2008, the &quot;on-budget deficit&quot; was $638 billion, offset by an &quot;off-budget surplus&quot; (mainly due to Social Security revenue in excess of payouts) of $183 billion, for a &quot;total deficit&quot; of $455 billion. This latter figure is the one commonly reported in the media. However, an additional $313 billion was required for &quot;the Treasury actions aimed at stabilizing the financial markets,&quot; an unusually high amount because of the subprime mortgage crisis. This meant that the &quot;debt held by the public&quot; increased by $768 billion ($455B + $313B = $768B). The &quot;off-budget surplus&quot; was borrowed and spent (as is typically the case), increasing the &quot;intra-governmental debt&quot; by $183 billion. So the total increase in the &quot;national debt&quot; in FY2008 was $768B +$183B = $951 billion. The Treasury Department reported an increase in the national debt of $1,017B for FY2008. The $66 billion difference is likely from &quot;supplemental appropriations&quot; for the War on Terror, some of which were outside the budget process entirely until President Obama began including most of them in his FY2010 budget.

In other words, spending the &quot;off budget&quot; Social Security surplus adds to the total national debt (by increasing the intragovernmental debt) while the &quot;off-budget&quot; surplus reduces the &quot;total&quot; deficit reported in the media. Certain spending called &quot;supplemental appropriations&quot; is outside the budget process entirely but adds to the national debt. Funding for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was accounted for this way prior to the Obama administration. Certain stimulus measures and earmarks were also outside the budget process. The federal government publishes the total debt owed (public and intragovernmental holdings) daily.

== Holders of debt ==
Because a large variety of people own the notes, bills, and bonds in the &quot;public&quot; portion of the debt, the Treasury also publishes information that groups the types of holders by general categories to portray who owns United States debt. In this data set, some of the public portion is moved and combined with the total government portion, because this amount is owned by the Federal Reserve as part of United States monetary policy. (See Federal Reserve System.)

As is apparent from the chart, a little less than half of the total national debt is owed to the &quot;Federal Reserve and intragovernmental holdings&quot;. The foreign and international holders of the debt are also put together from the notes, bills, and bonds sections. To the right is a chart for the data as of June 2008:

===Foreign holdings===
As of October 2018, foreigners owned $6.2 trillion of U.S. debt, or approximately 39% of the debt held by the public of $16.1 trillion and 28% of the total debt of $21.8 trillion. In December 2020, foreigners held 33% ($7 trillion out of $21.6 trillion) of publicly held US debt; of this $7 trillion, $4.1 trillion (59.2%) belonged to foreign governments and $2.8 trillion (40.8%) to foreign investors. Including both private and public debt holders, the top three December 2020 national holders of American public debt are Japan ($1.2 trillion or 17.7%), China ($1.1 trillion or 15.2%), and the United Kingdom ($0.4 trillion or 6.2%).

Historically, the share held by foreign governments had grown over time, rising from 13% of the public debt in 1988 to 34% in 2015. In more recent years, foreign ownership has retreated both in percent of total debt and total dollar amounts. China&#x27;s maximum holding of 9.1% or $1.3 trillion of U.S. debt occurred in 2011, subsequently reduced to 5% in 2018. Japan&#x27;s maximum holding of 7% or $1.2 trillion occurred in 2012, subsequently reduced to 4% in 2018.
According to Paul Krugman, &quot;America actually earns more from its assets abroad than it pays to foreign investors.&quot; Nonetheless, the country&#x27;s net international investment position represents a debt of more than $9 trillion.

==Forecasts==

===CBO ten-year outlook 2018–2028 (pre–COVID-19 pandemic)===
The CBO estimated the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and separate spending legislation over the 2018–2028 period in their annual &quot;Budget &amp; Economic Outlook&quot;, released in April 2018:
* The budget deficit in fiscal 2018 (which runs from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2018, the first year budgeted by President Trump) is forecast to be $804 billion, an increase of $139 billion (21%) from the $665 billion in 2017 and up $242 billion (39%) over the previous baseline forecast (June 2017) of $580 billion for 2018. The June 2017 forecast was essentially the budget trajectory inherited from President Obama; it was prepared prior to the Tax Act and spending increases under President Trump.
* For the 2018–2027 period, CBO projects the sum of the annual deficits (i.e., debt increase) to be $11.7 trillion, an increase of $1.6 trillion (16%) over the previous baseline (June 2017) forecast of $10.1 trillion.
* The $1.6 trillion debt increase includes three main elements:
*#$1.7 trillion less in revenues due to the tax cuts;
*#$1.0 trillion more in spending; and
*#Partially offsetting incremental revenue of $1.1 trillion due to higher economic growth than previously forecast.
* Debt held by the public is expected (Congressional Budget Office Outlook) to rise from 78% of GDP ($16 trillion) at the end of 2018 to 96% GDP ($29 trillion) by 2028. That would be the highest level since the end of World War II.
* CBO estimated under an alternative scenario (in which policies in place as of April 2018 are maintained beyond scheduled initiation or expiration) that deficits would be considerably higher, rising by $13.7 trillion over the 2018–2027 period, an increase of $3.6 trillion over the June 2017 baseline forecast. Maintaining current policies for example would include extending the individual Trump tax cuts past their scheduled expiration in 2025, among other changes.
* The debt increase of $1.6 trillion represents approximately $12,700 per household (assuming 126.2 million households in 2017), while the $3.6 trillion represents $28,500 per household.

===CBO ten-year outlook 2020–2030 (during the COVID-19 pandemic)===
The CBO estimated that the budget deficit for fiscal year 2020 would increase to $3.3 trillion or 16% GDP, more than triple that of 2019 and the largest as % GDP since 1945, because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. CBO also forecast the debt held by the public would rise to 98% GDP in 2020, compared with 79% in 2019 and 35% in 2007 before the Great Recession.

===CBO long-term outlook===


The CBO reports its &quot;Long-Term Budget Outlook&quot; annually, providing at least two scenarios for spending, revenue, deficits, and debt. The 2019 Outlook mainly covers the 30-year period through 2049. The CBO reported:

Large budget deficits over the next 30 years are projected to drive federal debt held by the public to unprecedented levels—from 78 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 to 144 percent by 2049. That projection incorporates CBO&#x27;s central estimates of various factors, such as productivity growth and interest rates on federal debt. CBO&#x27;s analysis indicates that even if values for those factors differed from the agency&#x27;s projections, debt several decades from now would probably be much higher than it is today.

Furthermore, under alternative scenarios:

If lawmakers changed current laws to maintain certain major policies now in place—most significantly, if they prevented a cut in discretionary spending in 2020 and an increase in individual income taxes in 2026—then debt held by the public would increase even more, reaching 219 percent of GDP by 2049. By contrast, if Social Security benefits were limited to the amounts payable from revenues received by the Social Security trust funds, debt in 2049 would reach 106 percent of GDP, still well above its current level.

Over the long term, the CBO projects that interest expense and mandatory spending categories (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) will continue to grow relative to GDP, while discretionary categories (e.g., Defense and other Cabinet Departments) continue to fall relative to GDP. Debt is projected to continue rising relative to GDP under the above two scenarios, although the CBO did also offer other scenarios that involved austerity measures that would bring the debt to GDP ratio down.

==Debt Reductions Proposals ==
===Negative real interest rates===
Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining negative real interest rates on government debt, meaning the inflation rate is greater than the interest rate paid on the debt. Such low rates, outpaced by the inflation rate, occur when the market believes that there are no alternatives with sufficiently low risk, or when popular institutional investments such as insurance companies, pensions, or bond, money market, and balanced mutual funds are required or choose to invest sufficiently large sums in Treasury securities to hedge against risk. Economist Lawrence Summers states that at such low interest rates, government borrowing actually saves taxpayer money and improves creditworthiness.

In the late 1940s through the early 1970s, the U.S. and UK both reduced their debt burden by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking advantage of negative real interest rates, but there is no guarantee that government debt rates will continue to stay this low. Between 1946 and 1974, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 121% to 32% even though there were surpluses in only eight of those years which were much smaller than the deficits.

=== Raising reserve requirements and full reserve banking ===
Two economists, Jaromir Benes and Michael Kumhof, working for the International Monetary Fund, published a working paper called &quot;The Chicago Plan Revisited&quot; suggesting that the debt could be eliminated by raising bank reserve requirements and converting from fractional-reserve banking to full-reserve banking. Economists at the Paris School of Economics have commented on the plan, stating that it is already the &quot;status quo&quot; for coinage currency, and a Norges Bank economist has examined the proposal in the context of considering the finance industry as part of the real economy. A Centre for Economic Policy Research paper agrees with the conclusion that &quot;no real liability is created by new fiat money creation and therefore public debt does not rise as a result.&quot;

==Economic Risks and Debates==

===CBO risk factors===
The CBO reported several types of risk factors related to rising debt levels in a July 2010 publication:
* A growing portion of savings would go towards purchases of government debt, rather than investments in productive capital goods such as factories and computers, leading to lower output and incomes than would otherwise occur;
* If higher marginal tax rates were used to pay rising interest costs, savings would be reduced and work would be discouraged;
* Rising interest costs would force reductions in government programs;
* Restrictions to the ability of policymakers to use fiscal policy to respond to economic challenges; and
* An increased risk of a sudden fiscal crisis, in which investors demand higher interest rates.

===Credit default===
The U.S. has never fully defaulted. In April 1979, however, the U.S. may have technically defaulted on $122 million (~$ in ) in Treasury bills, which was less than 1% of U.S. debt. The Treasury Department characterized it as a delay rather than as a default, but it did have consequences for short-term interest rates, which jumped 0.6%. Others view it as a temporary, partial default.

=== Debt ceiling ===

The United States debt ceiling is a legislative constraint on the amount of national debt that can be incurred by the U.S. Treasury. It limits how much money the federal government may pay on the debt it already has by borrowing even more money. The debt ceiling applies to almost all federal debt, including accounts owned by the public and intra-government funds for Medicare and Social Security.

=== Sustainability ===
In 2009 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that the United States was on a &quot;fiscally unsustainable&quot; path because of projected future increases in Medicare and Social Security spending. According to the Treasury report in October 2018, summarized by &quot;Business Insider&quot;&#x27;s Bob Bryan, the U.S. federal budget deficit rose as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 signed into law by President Donald Trump on December 22, 2017 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 signed into law on March 23, 2018.

===Risks to economic growth===
Debt levels may affect economic growth rates. In 2010, economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart reported that among the 20 developed countries studied, average annual GDP growth was 3–4% when debt was relatively moderate or low (i.e., under 60% of GDP), but it dips to just 1.6% when debt was high (i.e., above 90% of GDP). In April 2013, the conclusions of Rogoff and Reinhart&#x27;s study came into question when a coding error in their original paper was discovered by Herndon, Ash and Pollin of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Herndon, Ash and Pollin found that after correcting for errors and unorthodox methods used, there was no evidence that debt above a specific threshold reduces growth. Reinhart and Rogoff maintain that after correcting for errors, a negative relationship between high debt and growth remains. However, other economists, including Paul Krugman, have argued that it is low growth which causes national debt to increase, rather than the other way around.

Commenting on fiscal sustainability, former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke stated in April 2010 that &quot;Neither experience nor economic theory clearly indicates the threshold at which government debt begins to endanger prosperity and economic stability. But given the significant costs and risks associated with a rapidly rising federal debt, our nation should soon put in place a credible plan for reducing deficits to sustainable levels over time.&quot;

=== Interest and debt service costs ===

Interest expense on the public debt was approximately $678 billion in FY2023. During FY2023, the government also accrued a non-cash interest expense of $197 billion for intra-governmental debt, primarily the Social Security Trust Fund, for a total interest expense of $875 billion. This accrued interest is added to the Social Security Trust Fund and therefore the national debt each year and will be paid to Social Security recipients in the future. However, since it is a non-cash expense it is excluded from the budget deficit calculation.

The federal debt at the end of the 2018/19 fiscal year (ended September 30, 2019) was $22.7 trillion (~$ in ). The portion that is held by the public was $16.8 trillion. Neither figure includes approximately $2.5 trillion owed to the government. Interest on the debt was $404 billion.

The cost of servicing the U.S. national debt can be measured in various ways. The CBO analyzes net interest as a percentage of GDP, with a higher percentage indicating a higher interest payment burden. During 2015, this was 1.3% GDP, close to the record low 1.2% of the 1966–1968 era. The average from 1966 to 2015 was 2.0% of GDP. However, the CBO estimated in 2016 that the interest amounts and % GDP will increase significantly over the following decade as both interest rates and debt levels rise: &quot;Interest payments on that debt represent a large and rapidly growing expense of the federal government. CBO&#x27;s baseline shows net interest payments more than tripling under current law, climbing from $231 billion in 2014, or 1.3% of GDP, to $799 billion in 2024, or 3.0% of GDP—the highest ratio since 1996.&quot;

According to a study by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the U.S. government will spend more on servicing their debts than they do for their national defense budget by 2024.

In October 2023, yields for 10-year Treasury notes breached 5% as traders adjusted their assessment of United States&#x27; fiscal position and lowered their expectation that Congress or the White House would take any action to improve it. The impact was felt by homebuyers, with 30-year mortgage rate at its highest in two decades, and corporations facing higher costs of borrowing. Interests paid by the federal government jumped by $184 billion during the 2022 fiscal year and are still climbing.

==== Recent US debt service/interest statistics ====
===Chinese holdings of U.S. debt===
According to a 2013 Forbes article, many American and other economic analysts have expressed concerns on the amount of United States government debt the People&#x27;s Republic of China is holding as part of their reserves. The National Defense Authorization Act of FY2012 included a provision requiring the Secretary of Defense to conduct a &quot;national security risk assessment of U.S. federal debt held by China.&quot; The department issued its report in July 2012, stating that &quot;attempting to use U.S. Treasury securities as a coercive tool would have limited effect and likely would do more harm to China than to the United States.” An August 19, 2013 Congressional Research Service report said that the threat is not credible and the effect would be limited even if carried out. The report said that the threat would not offer &quot;China deterrence options, whether in the diplomatic, military, or economic realms, and this would remain true both in peacetime and in scenarios of crisis or war.&quot;

A 2010 article by James K. Galbraith in &quot;The Nation&quot;, defends deficits and dismisses concerns over foreign holdings of United States government debt denominated in U.S. dollars, including China&#x27;s holdings. In 2010, Warren Mosler, wrote that &quot;When[ever] the Chinese redeem those T-securities, the money is transferred back to China&#x27;s checking account at the Fed. During the entire purchase and redemption process, the dollars never leave the Fed.&quot; Australian economist Bill Mitchell argued that the United States government had a &quot;nearly infinite capacity...to spend.&quot; Against the backdrop of escalating Sino-U.S. tensions in 2020, Yuzo Sakai, a manager at Ueda Totan Forex Ltd., said that if China undertakes a massive sales of U.S. bonds, investors may flock to the Japanese yen as a safe-haven currency. Since 2018, China had been gradually decreasing its holdings of U.S. federal debt, bringing the total to $1.07 trillion in June 2020, behind Japan who became the biggest foreign creditor of the United States. Stephen Nagy, a professor at the International Christian University, said a sell-off by China &quot;might damage the United States in the short term&quot; but also cause &quot;critical economic instability&quot; in the Chinese and global economy. Jeff Kingston, a professor and director of Asian Studies at Temple University, Japan, echoed the view, adding that dumping would lower the price of U.S. bonds, making it more attractive to other countries. According to an institutional investor, however, it may be difficult for Japan to boost its already large holdings of U.S. government debt, as such a move could be seen as &quot;currency manipulation&quot;.

===Definition dispute of public debt===
Economists also debate the definition of public debt. Krugman argued in May 2010 that the debt held by the public is the right measure to use, while Reinhart has testified to the President&#x27;s Fiscal Reform Commission that gross debt is the appropriate measure. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) cited research by several economists supporting the use of the lower debt held by the public figure as a more accurate measure of the debt burden, disagreeing with these Commission members.

There is debate regarding the economic nature of the intragovernmental debt, which was approximately $4.6 trillion in February 2011. For example, the CBPP argues: that &quot;large increases in [debt held by the public] can also push up interest rates and increase the amount of future interest payments the federal government must make to lenders outside of the United States, which reduces Americans&#x27; income. By contrast, intragovernmental debt (the other component of the gross debt) has no such effects because it is simply money the federal government owes (and pays interest on) to itself.&quot; However, if the U.S. government continues to run &quot;on budget&quot; deficits as projected by the CBO and OMB for the foreseeable future, it will have to issue marketable Treasury bills and bonds (i.e., debt held by the public) to pay for the projected shortfall in the Social Security program. This will result in &quot;debt held by the public&quot; replacing &quot;intragovernmental debt&quot;.

===Intergenerational equity===
One debate about the national debt relates to intergenerational equity. For example, if one generation is receiving the benefit of government programs or employment enabled by deficit spending and debt accumulation, to what extent does the resulting higher debt impose risks and costs on future generations? There are several factors to consider:
* For every dollar of debt held by the public, there is a government obligation (generally marketable Treasury securities) counted as an asset by investors. Future generations benefit to the extent these assets are passed on to them.
* As of 2010, approximately 72% of the financial assets were held by the wealthiest 5% of the population. This presents a wealth and income distribution question, as only a fraction of the people in future generations will receive principal or interest from investments related to the debt incurred today.
* To the extent the U.S. debt is owed to foreign investors (approximately half the &quot;debt held by the public&quot; during 2012), principal and interest are not directly received by U.S. heirs.
* Higher debt levels imply higher interest payments, which create costs for future taxpayers (e.g., higher taxes, lower government benefits, higher inflation, or increased risk of fiscal crisis).
* To the extent the borrowed funds are invested today to improve the long-term productivity of the economy and its workers, such as via useful infrastructure projects or education, future generations may benefit.
* For every dollar of intragovernmental debt, there is an obligation to specific program recipients, generally non-marketable securities such as those held in the Social Security Trust Fund. Adjustments that reduce future deficits in these programs may also apply costs to future generations, via higher taxes or lower program spending.

Krugman wrote in March 2013 that by neglecting public investment and failing to create jobs, we are doing far more harm to future generations than merely passing along debt: &quot;Fiscal policy is, indeed, a moral issue, and we should be ashamed of what we&#x27;re doing to the next generation&#x27;s economic prospects. But our sin involves investing too little, not borrowing too much.&quot; Young workers face high unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout their careers as a result. Teacher jobs have been cut, which could affect the quality of education and competitiveness of younger Americans.

==COVID-19 pandemic and aftermath==
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States impacted the economy significantly beginning in March 2020, as businesses were shut-down and furloughed or fired personnel. About 16 million persons filed for unemployment insurance in the three weeks ending April 9. It caused the number of unemployed persons to increase significantly, which is expected to reduce tax revenues while increasing automatic stabilizer spending for unemployment insurance and nutritional support. As a result of the adverse economic impact, both state and federal budget deficits will dramatically increase, even before considering any new legislation.

To help address lost income for millions of workers and assist businesses, Congress and President Trump enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) on March 27, 2020. It included loans and grants for businesses, along with direct payments to individuals and additional funding for unemployment insurance. The act carried an estimated $2.3 trillion price tag, with an expectation that some or all of the loans would ultimately be paid back including interest. While the law would have almost certainly increased budget deficits relative to the January 2020 10-year CBO baseline (completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic), in the absence of the legislation, a complete economic collapse could have occurred. However, as of 2023, many of these loans have been forgiven.

CBO provided a preliminary score for the CARES Act on April 16, 2020, estimating that it would increase federal deficits by about $1.8 trillion over the 2020-2030 period. The estimate includes: 
*A $988 billion increase in mandatory outlays; 
*A $446 billion decrease in revenues; and 
*A $326 billion increase in discretionary outlays, stemming from emergency supplemental appropriations.

CBO reported that not all parts of the bill will increase deficits: “Although the act provides financial assistance totaling more than $2 trillion, the projected cost is less than that because some of that assistance is in the form of loan guarantees, which are not estimated to have a net effect on the budget. In particular, the act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to provide up to $454 billion to fund emergency lending facilities established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Because the income and costs stemming from that lending are expected to roughly offset each other, CBO estimates no deficit effect from that provision.”

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the budget deficit for fiscal year 2020 would increase to a record $3.8 trillion (~$ in ), or 18.7% GDP. For scale, in 2009 the budget deficit reached 9.8% GDP ($1.4 trillion nominal dollars) in the depths of the Great Recession. CBO forecast in January 2020 that the budget deficit in FY2020 would be $1.0 trillion (~$ in ), prior to considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or CARES. CFRB further estimated that the national debt would reach 106% of U.S. GDP in September 2020, a record since the aftermath of World War II.

President Biden also allocated significant amounts of money towards relief of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a May 2021 report, Biden has or plans to spend $5.72 (~$ in ) trillion dollars toward this effort and others such as climate change including providing stimulus checks and serving schools and low-income children. Many economists have agreed that this unprecedented level of spending from the Biden Administration has, in part, contributed to the inflation spike from 2021 to 2022 as a result of increasing the money supply in the economy.

==Appendix==
===National debt for selected years===

===Interest paid===
According to federal government data, interest payment on debt has crossed above one trillion on October 1, 2023.&lt;br&gt; 
Note that this is all interest the U.S. paid, including interest credited to Social Security and other government trust funds, not just &quot;interest on debt&quot; frequently cited elsewhere.

===Foreign holders of U.S. Treasury securities===

The following is a list of the top foreign holders of Treasury securities as listed by the Federal Reserve Board (revised by December 2024 survey):
===Statistics===
* U.S. official gold reserves total 261.5 million troy ounces with a book value of approximately $11.04 billion.
* Foreign exchange reserves $140 billion . 
* The national debt was up to $80,885 per person as of 2020.
* The national debt equated to $59,143 per person U.S. population, or $159,759 per member of the U.S. working taxpayers, back in March 2016.
* In 2008, $242 billion was spent on interest payments servicing the debt, out of a total tax revenue of $2.5 trillion, or 9.6%. Including non-cash interest accrued primarily for Social Security, interest was $454 billion or 18% of tax revenue.
* Total U.S. household debt, including mortgage loan and consumer debt, was $11.4 trillion in 2005. By comparison, total U.S. household assets, including real estate, equipment, and financial instruments such as mutual funds, was $62.5 trillion in 2005.
* Total U.S. Consumer Credit Card revolving credit was $931.0 billion in April 2009.
* The U.S. balance of trade deficit in goods and services was $725.8 billion in 2005.
* According to the U.S. Department of Treasury Preliminary 2014 Annual Report on U.S. Holdings of Foreign Securities, the United States valued its foreign treasury securities portfolio at $2.7 trillion. The largest debtors are Canada, the United Kingdom, Cayman Islands, and Australia, whom account for $1.2 trillion of sovereign debt owed to residents of the U.S.
* The entire public debt in 1998 was equal to the cost of research, development, and deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons-related programs during the Cold War.

A 1998 Brookings Institution study published by the Nuclear Weapons Cost Study Committee (formed in 1993 by the W. Alton Jones Foundation), calculated that total expenditures for U.S. nuclear weapons from 1940 to 1998 was $5.5 trillion in 1996 Dollars. The total public debt at the end of fiscal year 1998 was $5,478,189,000,000 in 1998 Dollars or $5.3 trillion in 1996 Dollars.

<doc id="322222" wikidata="Q1618933" url="?curid=322222" title="Hilton Edwards">
<text>Hilton Edwards (2 February 1903 – 18 November 1982) was an English-born Irish actor, lighting designer, and theatrical producer. He co-founded the Gate Theatre with his partner Micheál Mac Liammóir and two others, and has been referred to as the founder of Irish theatre. He was one of the most recognisable figures in the arts in 20th-century Ireland.

==Early life==
Edwards was born in London, the son of Thomas George Cecil Edwards and Emily Edwards ( Murphy).

==Career==

Edwards began his career acting with the Charles Doran Shakespeare Company in 1920 in Windsor and then joined the Old Vic in London, playing in all but two of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays before leaving the company a few years later. Trained in music, he also sang baritone roles with the Old Vic Opera Company.

As an actor he played leading parts, including the title roles in &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; and Sheridan Whiteside in &quot;The Man Who Came To Dinner&quot;. On Broadway in 1966, he directed Brian Friel&#x27;s &quot;Philadelphia, Here I Come!&quot; and &quot;The Loves of Cass McGuire&quot;.

After touring with various companies in Britain and South Africa, he went to Ireland in 1927 for a season with Anew McMaster&#x27;s company and met Mr. McMaster&#x27;s brother-in-law, Micheál Mac Liammóir. As he told an interviewer once, both men wanted a theatre of their own; MacLiammóir wanted it to be in Ireland and Edwards did not care. &quot;I don&#x27;t care about nationalism, I care about the theatre,&quot; he said.

===The Gate Theatre===
Along with his romantic partner, Micheál Mac Liammóir, Edwards co-founded the Gate Theatre in Dublin. He directed more than 300 plays at the Gate ranging from the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles, Goethe and Ibsen to the comedies of Shaw and Sheridan and new Irish plays, by such authors as W. B. Yeats, Brian Friel, and Mac Liammóir.

During their first season, they presented seven plays, including Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, O’Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Hairy Ape&quot;, and Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salomé&quot;. Their productions were innovative and experimental and they offered Dublin audiences an introduction to the world of European and American theatre as well as classics from the modern and Irish repertoire. 

The company played for two seasons at the Peacock Theatre and then on Christmas Eve 1929, in Groome’s Hotel, the lease was signed for the 18th Century Rotunda Annex –– the &#x27;Upper Concert Hall&#x27;, the Gate&#x27;s present home, with Goethe&#x27;s Faust opening on 17 February 1930.

In 1931, the newly established Gate Theatre ran into financial difficulties and Lord Longford and his wife Christine provided financial support. The Longfords worked with Edwards and MacLiammóir at the Gate until 1936, then a split developed and two separate companies were formed and played at the Gate for six months each. The companies also toured for six months until the death of Lord Longford in 1961.
During this period, Edwards and MacLiammóir (Gate Theatre Productions) ran shows in Dublin&#x27;s Gaiety Theatre and toured productions to Europe, Egypt and North America.

===RTÉ===
In 1961, he took a two-year break from theatre to become the first Head of Drama at Telefís Éireann, Ireland&#x27;s national broadcaster and, a year later, he won a Jacob&#x27;s Award for his television series, &quot;Self Portrait.&quot;

===Film===
Edwards appeared in 15 films, including &quot;Othello&quot; (1952), &quot;Captain Lightfoot&quot; (1955), &quot;David and Goliath&quot; (1960), &quot;Victim&quot; (1961) and &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot; (1967). He also wrote and directed Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Return to Glennascaul&quot; (1951). However, he was primarily known for his theatre work; he was nominated for a Tony Award in 1966 for Best Director of a Drama for &quot;Philadelphia, Here I Come!&quot;

===Death===
Hilton Edwards died in Dublin, Ireland, aged 79. Edwards and Mac Liammóir are buried alongside each other at St. Fintan&#x27;s Cemetery, Sutton, Dublin

==Coverage and recognition==
Edwards and Mac Liammóir were the subject of a biography, titled &quot;The Boys&quot; by Christopher Fitz-Simon. He also features extensively in Mac Liammóir&#x27;s books.

Frank McGuinness&#x27;s play &quot;Gates of Gold&quot; is a nod to Edwards and Mac Liammóir.

In 1973, Edwards and Mac Liammóir were granted the Freedom of the City of Dublin.

==Relationship with Mac Liammóir and legacy==
The academic Éibhear Walshe of University College Cork notes that MacLiammóir and Edwards did not ever identify themselves as gay as &quot;Irish cultural discourse simply didn’t accommodate any public sexual identity outside the heterosexual consensus&quot;, noting that Irish society at the time only recorded lesbian and gay communities and cultures &quot;in police records, prosecutions of men for same-sex activities or medical records of institutional committals of men and women for the mental illness of inversion&quot;.

They were, however, prominent features on the Dublin social scene and as Walshe notes elsewhere &quot;MacLiammóir and his partner Edwards survived, and even flourished, as Ireland&#x27;s only visible gay couple&quot;. The couple lived together at 4 Harcourt Terrace. Walshe goes on to say that &quot;when MacLiammóir died in 1978, the president of Ireland attended his funeral, as did the taoiseach and several government ministers, while Hilton Edwards was openly deferred to and sympathised [with] as chief mourner&quot;.

The International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival presents an award for &quot;Best Aspect of Production&quot; in his name.

<text>Micheál Mac Liammóir (born Alfred Lee Willmore; 25 October 1899 – 6 March 1978) was an actor, designer, dramatist, writer, and impresario in 20th-century Ireland. Though born in London to an English family with no Irish connections, he emigrated to Ireland in early adulthood, changed his name, invented an Irish ancestry, and remained based there for the rest of his life, successfully maintaining a fabricated identity as a native Irishman born in Cork.

With his partner, Hilton Edwards, and two others, Mac Liammóir founded the Gate Theatre in Dublin, and became one of the most recognisable figures in the arts in twentieth-century Ireland. As well as acting at the Gate and internationally, he designed numerous productions, wrote eleven plays, and published stories, verse and travel books in Irish and English. He wrote and appeared in three one-man shows, of which &quot;The Importance of Being Oscar&quot; (1960) was the most celebrated, achieving more than 1,300 performances.

==Life and career==
===Early years===

Mac Liammóir was born Alfred Lee Willmore, in Willesden, in north-west London, into a family with no Irish connections. He was the youngest child and only son of Alfred George Willmore (1863–1934), a forage buyer for the firm of Whitney&#x27;s of Bayswater, and his wife, Mary, &quot;née&quot; Lee (1867–1918). 

He attended primary school in Willesden and then attended a children&#x27;s theatre academy run by Lila Field. He became a professional actor at the age of twelve; his sister Marjorie took charge of his general education and was his chaperone on tours that included visits to venues in Ireland as well as Britain. He made his debut in 1911, as King Goldfish in Field&#x27;s play &quot;The Goldfish&quot;, alongside another child actor, Noël Coward. He later said, &quot;I learned from Lila Field the absolute ABC of getting on and off the stage without disgracing oneself; I learned what a cue meant, what a stick of greasepaint was, the elements of timing, and that ghastly thing, the exploitation of childish charm&quot;. In September of that year he first worked for Sir Herbert Tree, playing Macduff&#x27;s son in &quot;Macbeth&quot;. From Tree he quickly learned &quot;a rude lesson&quot; that charm was not enough: &quot;I think it was Tree who first awoke the actor&#x27;s imagination in me and made me feel the terror of the Witches&#x27; Coven and the horror of the ghost-haunted banquet&quot;.
In the Christmas season of 1911, he played Michael Darling in &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, and in June 1912, he played Oliver Twist in Tree&#x27;s revival of the stage version of the novel. After two further child roles, and appearances in four silent films (now lost) he temporarily abandoned acting. After a summer in Spain, visiting his grandparents and becoming fluent in Spanish, he studied painting at Willesden Polytechnic and then the Slade School of Art in 1915–16.

With a fellow student, Mary O&#x27;Keefe, he attended Irish language classes at the Ludgate Circus branch of the Gaelic League; the biographer Christopher Fitz-Simon thinks it probable that they saw plays by W. B. Yeats, Lady Gregory and J. M. Synge during the visits of the Abbey Theatre company in this period. Both students developed a keen interest in the Irish Literary Revival.

===Move to Ireland===
Mac Liammóir, now calling himself &quot;Michael Willmore&quot;, made a brief return to the stage in February 1917, in &quot;Felix Gets a Month&quot;, a &quot;whimsical comedy&quot; at the Haymarket Theatre. The following month he went with O&#x27;Keefe and her mother to Ireland, the former having contracted tuberculosis and been prescribed &quot;fresh air&quot;, the latter anxious to escape Zeppelin raids. Fitz-Simon suggests that Mac Liammóir&#x27;s motive was to escape conscription into the army in the latter stages of the First World War.

In Ireland Mac Liammóir earned a modest living as a freelance illustrator for newspapers and books, acted from time to time, and designed for the Irish Theatre and Dublin Drama League. He assimilated himself into Irish culture and politics. He campaigned for Sinn Féin in the 1918 General Election, published his first book, a collection of stories in Irish, in 1922, and continued to write verse and prose in Irish and English. He experimented with various gaelicised versions of his name, including &quot;Mac Uaimmhóir&quot; and &quot;Mac Liaimmhóir&quot;. He built up a fictitious identity as a native Irishman born in Cork.

During most of the 1920s Mac Liammóir continued to live with the O&#x27;Keefes. In search of a healthy environment for Mary, they moved between Switzerland and the French Riviera. He exhibited successfully in local galleries and, in 1923, at the Leigh Gallery in London. He later wrote a book of recollections – in Irish – about his travels. In 1925 he starred in a silent film, &quot;Land of Her Fathers&quot; with a cast of mainly Abbey Theatre players.

Mary O&#x27;Keefe died in 1927. Mac Liammóir, now known by that name, returned to the theatre. His sister Marjorie had married the actor-manager Anew McMaster whose touring company Mac Liammóir joined, playing Shakespearean roles including Bassanio in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, Laertes in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and Cassio in &quot;Othello&quot;. While on tour in the south of Ireland, he met another young English actor, Hilton Edwards, who was to become his lifelong partner, both personal and professional. Mac Liammóir and Edwards decided to settle in Dublin, with the intention of setting up their own theatre there.

===Gate Theatre===

In 1928 Mac Liammóir wrote, directed, designed and starred in &quot;Diarmuid and Gráinne&quot; for the opening of the Irish language theatre, An Taibhdhearc, in Galway. He subsequently produced twenty plays there.

Also in 1928, Mac Liammóir was one of the four founders of the Gate Theatre Studio, later simply the Gate Theatre, alongside Hilton Edwards, Daisy Bannard Cogley, and Gearóid Ó Lochlainn. Mac Liammóir and Edwards had been considering theatrical plans for Dublin, while Bannard Cogley (a friend of Mac Liammóir) and Ó Lochlainn had been discussing finding a more permanent theatre space, and they met, along with some mutual friends, in Bannard Cogley&#x27;s club at 7 Harcourt Street, in spring 1928. After further meetings, the quartet rented the Peacock Theatre and launched the Gate Theatre Studio there on 14 October 1928. The theatre studio spent its early years at the 102-seat Peacock Theatre and opened with a production of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, and Mac Liammóir subsequently acted in and designed nearly 300 productions at the Peacock and, after the company gained its own home in 1930, on Cavendish Row, at the Gate. He appeared in a wide range of plays, from Shakespeare (Romeo and Othello) to Ibsen (Oswald in &quot;Ghosts&quot; and the title role in &quot;Brand&quot;) and Eugene O&#x27;Neill (Orin in &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot;), as well as lighter pieces. Over the next fifty years the Gate Theatre company presented a programme of new or experimental plays by Wilde, Shaw, Coward and many others. Mac Liammóir and Edwards fostered the careers of new Irish dramatists such as Denis Johnston and rising young actors including Orson Welles.

Mac Liammóir returned to the West End in 1935, with the Gate company. The theatrical paper &quot;The Era&quot; rated his Hamlet one of the best in recent years: &quot;charged with force, intelligence, humanity and dramatic certainty … a dominating and moving piece of acting&quot;, and said that the Gate company &quot;looks like putting the Abbey in the shade&quot;. The cosmopolitan atmosphere of Mac Liammóir and Edwards&#x27; Gate Theatre was contrasted with the earnest Celticism of the Abbey, and the two Dublin theatres were affectionately dubbed &quot;Sodom and Begorrah&quot;.

===Wartime and later years===
Mac Liammóir remained based in Ireland during the Second World War. In the post-war years, he returned to the West End in his own play &quot;Ill Met by Moonlight&quot;. &quot;The Stage&quot; thought the piece &quot;too obscure and too discursive&quot;, but praised the performances of Mac Liammóir, Edwards and their supporting cast. The following year the company played a short season on Broadway – Mac Liammóir&#x27;s début there – giving his &quot;Where Stars Walk&quot;, Johnston&#x27;s &quot;The Old Lady Says No!&quot;, and Shaw&#x27;s &quot;John Bull&#x27;s Other Island&quot;. In 1951 he played Iago to Welles&#x27;s Othello in the latter&#x27;s film adaptation. In his early fifties, he was unusually old for the role, but Welles wanted Iago played as an older, impotent man consumed by envy of the younger Othello. Mac Liammóir returned to the role onstage at the Dublin Festival in 1962 opposite William Marshall in the title role.

In 1954 Mac Liammóir returned to London, playing Brack in &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; with Peggy Ashcroft as Hedda. In the role he was judged to be both sinister and amusing. Most of his work continued to be at the Gate, but in 1959 he returned to New York to play Don Pedro in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, with John Gielgud as Benedick and Margaret Leighton as Beatrice.

Mac Liammóir&#x27;s biggest theatrical success came in 1960, with his one-man show &quot;The Importance of Being Oscar&quot;, which won enthusiastic reviews and did well at the box office. It opened at the Gate, after which he played it on Broadway, in London and on tour around the world. He appeared in the piece more than 1,300 times between 1960 and 1975. He followed this in May 1963 with a new one-man entertainment &quot;I Must Be Talking to My Friends&quot;, and in 1970 presented a third, &quot;Talking About Yeats&quot;. Also in 1963 he had a key role as the ironic, mocking, unseen narrator of the multi-Oscar-winning film Tom Jones.

In his later years Mac Liammóir relaxed his insistence on his fictitious origins and admitted the truth to interviewers, but for many years after his death reference books nonetheless continued to record him as a native of Cork. Despite Ireland&#x27;s anti-gay laws, not repealed in their lifetimes, Edwards&#x27; and Mac Liammóir&#x27;s relationship gained wide acceptance. The writer Éibhear Walshe has described them as Ireland&#x27;s only publicly acknowledged homosexuals. They were jointly created freemen of the city of Dublin in 1973, the first theatre people to be thus honoured. Before that, MacLiammóir had received the Lady Gregory Medal for literature in 1960 and an honorary doctorate from Trinity College in 1963.

MacLiammóir made his final stage performance at the Gate in 1975 in &quot;The Importance of Being Oscar&quot;. He died at his and Edwards&#x27;s Dublin home, 4 Harcourt Terrace, on 6 March 1978. Walshe records, &quot;as a measure of the public acceptance of the MacLiammóir–Edwards partnership, the president of Ireland attended Micheál&#x27;s funeral, two days later, at St Fintan&#x27;s, Howth, Dublin, and paid his respects to Hilton Edwards as chief mourner&quot;.

<text>The Blue Ridge Parkway is a National Parkway and All-American Road in the United States, noted for its scenic beauty. The parkway, which is the longest linear park in the U.S., runs for through 29 counties in Virginia and North Carolina, linking Shenandoah National Park to Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It runs mostly along the spine of the Blue Ridge, a major mountain chain that is part of the Appalachian Mountains. Its southern terminus is at U.S. Route 441 (US 441) on the boundary between Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Qualla Boundary of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina, from which it travels north to Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. The roadway continues through Shenandoah as Skyline Drive, a similar scenic road which is managed by a different National Park Service unit. Both Skyline Drive and the Virginia portion of the Blue Ridge Parkway are part of Virginia State Route 48 (SR 48), though this designation is not signed.

The parkway has been the most visited unit of the National Park System every year since 1946 except four (1949, 2013, 2016 and 2019). Land on either side of the road is owned and maintained by the National Park Service, and in many places parkway land is bordered by United States Forest Service property. There is no fee for using the parkway; however, commercial vehicles are prohibited without approval from the Park Service Headquarters, near Asheville, North Carolina. The roadway is not maintained in the winter, and sections that pass over especially high elevations and through tunnels are often impassable and therefore closed from late fall through early spring. Weather is extremely variable in the mountains, so conditions and closures often change rapidly. The speed limit is never higher than and is lower in some sections.

In addition to the road, the parkway has a folk art center located at mile marker 382 and a visitor center located at mile marker 384, both near Asheville. There are also numerous parking areas at trailheads for the various hiking trails that intersect the parkway, and several campgrounds located along the parkway allow for overnight stays. The Blue Ridge Music Center (also part of the park) is located in Galax, and Mount Mitchell (the highest point in eastern North America) is only accessible via North Carolina Highway 128 (NC 128), which intersects the parkway at milepost 355.4.

==Route description==
The parkway runs from the southern terminus of Shenandoah National Park&#x27;s Skyline Drive in Virginia at Rockfish Gap to U.S. Route 441 (US 441) at Oconaluftee in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park near Cherokee, North Carolina. It is an undivided two-lane expressway for most of its route. Access is controlled via interchanges with local roads and state/US highways. The parkway crosses (but does not interchange with) several interstate highways along its route and is carried across streams, railway ravines and cross roads by 168 bridges and six viaducts. Frequent pull-offs, rest areas, and scenic overlooks line the sides of the road. Outside of the Asheville, Boone and Roanoke areas, it largely avoids major population centers, and the road parallels several US and Interstate Highways along sections of its route, which are generally used for longer haul traffic. Because of this, the road and its vistas are designed to be the attraction itself, rather than merely a means of efficient travel. The use of interchanges and grade separation at cross roads is designed to allow for freer flowing traffic and better vistas than frequent intersections and stoplights would allow for.

The parkway uses short side roads to connect to other highways, and there are no direct interchanges with Interstate Highways, making it possible to enjoy wildlife and other scenery without stopping for cross-traffic. Mileposts along the parkway start at zero at the northeast end in Virginia and count to 469 at the southern end in North Carolina. The mileposts can be found on the right-hand side of the road while traveling southbound on the parkway. Major towns and cities along the way include Waynesboro, Roanoke, and Galax in Virginia; and in North Carolina, Boone and Asheville, where it runs across the property of the Biltmore Estate. The Blue Ridge Parkway tunnels were constructed through the rock—one in Virginia and 25 in North Carolina.

===Cold weather===
Much of the parkway is located at high elevation, with colder, wetter and windier conditions than in surrounding areas. The highest point on the parkway (south of Waynesville, near Mount Pisgah in North Carolina) is above sea level on Richland Balsam at milepost 431. Sections of the parkway may be temporarily closed to repair damage caused by the cold winter climate of the mountains or for other maintenance. The parkway&#x27;s natural resource protection protocol limits the use of ice melting chemicals, and certain areas could remain closed for extended periods. During road closures alternative routes are used, but short-term closures may not have a signed detour route. Sections of the parkway near the tunnels are often closed in winter due to icy conditions.

==History==

Begun during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the project was originally called the Appalachian Scenic Highway.

Original plans called for the parkway to connect Shenandoah National Park and Great Smoky Mountains National Park with the parkway either turning west into Tennessee at Linville, North Carolina, or continuing southward through North Carolina. Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes put together a three-person panel to study the possible routes the parkway could take. That panel, named after its chairman George L.P. Radcliffe, recommended the Tennessee route. However, Roosevelt had remained friends with Josephus Daniels, Roosevelt&#x27;s superior as Secretary of the Navy during World War I. Daniels wanted the parkway to go through North Carolina and persuaded Ickes to choose the North Carolina route. The Bruce Bowers documentary &quot;The Blue Ridge Parkway: The Long and Winding Road&quot; gives Congressman Robert Doughton the credit for getting the route changed. The documentary claims Doughton worked to pass the Social Security Act only after getting the route changed.

Most construction was carried out by private contractors under federal contracts under an authorization by Ickes in his role as federal public works administrator. Work began on September 11, 1935, near Cumberland Knob in North Carolina; construction in Virginia began the following February. On June 30, 1936, Congress formally authorized the project as the Blue Ridge Parkway and placed it under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service. Some work was carried out by various New Deal public works agencies. The Works Progress Administration did some roadway construction. Crews from the Emergency Relief Administration carried out landscape work and development of parkway recreation areas. Personnel from four Civilian Conservation Corps camps worked on roadside cleanup, roadside plantings, grading slopes, and improving adjacent fields and forest lands. During World War II, the CCC crews were replaced by conscientious objectors in the Civilian Public Service program.

The parkway&#x27;s construction created jobs in the region, but also displaced many residents and created new rules and regulations for landowners, including requirements related to how farmers could transport crops. Residents could no longer build on their lands without permission, or develop land except for agricultural use. They were not permitted to use the parkway for any commercial travel but were required to transport equipment and materials on side roads.

The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians were also affected by the parkway, which was built through their lands. From 1935 to 1940, they resisted giving up the right-of-way through the Qualla Boundary, and they were successful in gaining more favorable terms from the U.S. government. Specifically, the revised bill &quot;specified the parkway route, assured the $40,000 payment for the tribe&#x27;s land, and required the state to build [a] regular highway through the Soco Valley&quot;. (The highway referred to is part of U.S. Route 19.) Cherokee leaders participated in the dedications when the Cherokee sections opened in the 1950s.

Construction of the parkway was complete by the end of 1966 with one notable exception. The stretch including the Linn Cove Viaduct around Grandfather Mountain did not open until 1987. The project took over 52 years to complete.

Due to serious damage in 2004 from Hurricane Frances, then again by Hurricane Ivan, many areas along the parkway were closed until the spring of 2005, with two areas that were not fully repaired until the spring of 2006.

The parkway was on North Carolina&#x27;s version of the America the Beautiful quarter in 2015.

The parkway was closed in October 2024 due to damage from Hurricane Helene.
===Proposed extension===
An extension of the parkway from its terminus at Beech Gap, North Carolina to a point north of Atlanta, Georgia, was proposed in 1961 by North Carolina Congressman Roy A. Taylor. The route was proposed to pass Whiteside Mountain, Bridal Veil Falls, Cuilasaja Gorge, and Estatoah Falls, ending between Atlanta and Gainesville, Georgia after crossing the Chattahoochee River and passing to the east of Lake Sidney Lanier. By 1963 the National Park Service had proposed a terminus at Interstate 75 north of Marietta, Georgia, in the vicinity of Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a bill to extend the parkway in 1967. A five-year schedule was proposed, with a budget of $87,536,000 (equivalent to $ in ). In 1970 planning was interrupted by the projected commercial development of land in the proposed path. Increasing costs associated with rerouting and the passage of time coincided with efforts to cut national debt and concerns about the project&#x27;s environmental impact, and the project stalled in 1973. The project was formally cancelled on September 11, 1985; no construction work had ever taken place.

==Ecology==
Flowering shrubs and wildflowers dominate the parkway in the spring, including rhododendrons and dogwoods, moving from valleys to mountains as the cold weather retreats. Smaller annuals and perennials such as the daisy and aster flower through the summer. Brilliant autumn foliage occurs later in September on the mountaintops, descending to the valleys by later in October. Often in early-to-middle October and middle to late April, all three seasons can be seen simply by looking down from the cold and windy parkway to the green and warm valleys below. October is especially dramatic, as the colored leaves stand out boldly and occur mostly at the same time, unlike the flowers.

Major trees include oak, hickory, and tulip tree at lower elevations and buckeye and ash in the middle, turning into conifers such as fir and spruce at the highest elevations on the parkway. Trees near ridges, peaks, and passes (often called gaps or notches) are often distorted and even contorted by the wind, and persistent rime ice is deposited by passing clouds in the winter.

The Blue Ridge Parkway has also been a corridor for the spread of many invasive species, including oriental bittersweet, privet, and multiflora rose.

==Major intersections==




















==Tunnels==
There are 26 tunnels constructed along the Blue Ridge Parkway. One, the Bluff Mountain Tunnel, is in Virginia and twenty-five are in North Carolina.

The design standards specified a minimum impact on the land. The vehicle tunnels were often constructed to reduce excessive landscape scarring that open cuts would have produced. They are used in areas of steep terrain where ridges run perpendicular to the roadway alignment.

North Carolina&#x27;s more rugged terrain required the majority of the tunnels. Most of the work on the tunnel digging was done by hand and provided by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Little machinery was used with the intention of creating manual labor in depressed economic times. They did have for tunneling truck-mounted water-cooled compressed air drills called &quot;Jumbos.&quot; After the initial holes were drilled into the substrata, dynamite was used for blasting away the rock.

Concrete lining was done during construction due to tunnel cave-ins. This concrete lining was first used in the Devil&#x27;s Courthouse Tunnel. It was later discovered that it enhanced the interior lighting within the tunnel itself. Where done the lining covered about a quarter of the interior structure. An additional benefit was the elimination of moisture entering the tunnel. Moisture in the winter caused ice problems.

The Pine Mountain Tunnel is the longest on the parkway at . Ferrin Knob Tunnel #1 is the first and longest of the &quot;triplet tunnels.&quot; The local people once referred to ferns as &quot;ferrins.&quot; Ferrin Knob Tunnel #2 is located at milepost 401.3 and Ferrin Knob Tunnel #3 is located at milepost 401.5.

The distinctive stone masonry portals now on the parkway tunnels were generally not part of the original construction of the 1930s. They were added later.

The tunnels are listed below by milepost, name, and length. The maximum height is in the center of the tunnel and the minimum height is at the edge stripe.

<doc id="322237" wikidata="Q311454" url="?curid=322237" title="Garcinia">
<text>Garcinia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Clusiaceae native to Asia, America, Australia, tropical and southern Africa, and Polynesia. The number of species is disputed; Plants of the World Online (POWO) recognise up to 400. Commonly, the plants in this genus are called saptrees, mangosteens (which may also refer specifically to &quot;Garcinia mangostana&quot;), or garcinias, and is one of several plants known as by the name &quot;monkey fruit&quot;.

Many species are threatened by habitat destruction, and at least one species, &quot;G. cadelliana&quot;, from South Andaman Island, is almost or even completely extinct already.

The fruits are a food source for several animals, such as the archduke butterflies (&quot;Lexias&quot; spp.) of tropical eastern Asia which relish the sap of overripe mangosteens.

The genus is named after French botanist Laurent Garcin (1683–1751).

==Description==
&quot;Garcinia&quot; species are evergreen trees and shrubs, dioecious and in several cases apomictic. The fruit is a berry with fleshy endocarp, which in several species is delicious. Among neotropical &quot;Garcinia&quot; several species are dioecious (G. leptophylla, G. macrophylla and G. magnifolia), although male and female trees have often been observed to have some degree of self-fertility.

==Uses==

The fruit of most species of &quot;Garcinia&quot; are eaten locally; some species&#x27; fruits are highly esteemed in one region, but unknown just a few hundred kilometres away. The best-known species is &quot;Garcinia mangostana&quot;, which is now cultivated throughout Southeast Asia and other tropical countries, having become established in the late 20th century. Less well-known, but still of international importance, are kandis (&quot;G. forbesii&quot;) with small round red fruits with subacid taste and melting flesh, the lemon drop mangosteen (&quot;G. intermedia&quot;) with yellow fruit that look like a wrinkled lemon, and the thin-skinned orange button mangosteen (&quot;G. prainiana&quot;).

In addition, mangosteen rind (exocarp) extract is used as a spice. It figures prominently in Kodava culture, and &quot;G. multiflora&quot; is used to flavour and colour the famous &quot;bún riêu&quot; soup of Vietnam, where this plant is known as &quot;hạt điều màu&quot;. &quot;Garcinia gummi-gutta&quot; yields a spice widely used in South Asia, in particular in Kerala, where it is called &quot;kodumpulli&quot;.

Most species in Garcinia are known for their gum resin, brownish-yellow from xanthonoids such as mangostin, and used as purgative or cathartic, but most frequently – at least in former times – as a pigment. The colour term gamboge refers to this pigment.

Extracts of the exocarp of certain species – typically &quot;G. gummi-gutta&quot;, but also &quot;G. mangostana&quot; – are often contained in appetite suppressants, but their effectiveness at normal consumption levels is unproven, while at least one case of severe acidosis caused by long-term consumption of such products has been documented. Furthermore, they may contain significant amounts of hydroxycitric acid, which is somewhat toxic and might even destroy the testicles after prolonged use.

Bitter kola (&quot;G. kola&quot;) seeds are used in folk medicine. &quot;G. mannii&quot; is popular as a chew stick in western Africa, freshening the breath and cleaning the teeth.

&quot;G. subelliptica&quot;, called &quot;fukugi&quot; in Japanese, is the floral emblem of Mobuto and Tarama on Okinawa. The Malaysian town of Beruas – often spelled &quot;Bruas&quot; – derives its name from the seashore mangosteen (&quot;G. hombroniana&quot;), known locally as &quot;pokok bruas&quot;. It has been used for many years by certain African tribes as a tonic believed to increase &#x27;energy levels&#x27; and to possess digestive and fat-busting properties.

==Selected species==


, Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online lists more than 400 accepted species, which include:
== Genetic Diversity ==
The genetic diversity of 22 Garcinia accessions was analyzed using peroxidase, RAPD markers, and gene sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (GSSAP). Genetic diversity assessment revealed low genetic variation among them. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Garcinia species clustered into five groups at a mean similarity coefficient of 0.54. This study showed that the &quot;G. magostana&quot; accessions can be clearly distinguished by combined peroxidase, RAPD, and gene sequence-specific amplification polymorphism.

<text>The European hare (Lepus europaeus), also known as the brown hare, is a species of hare native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is among the largest hare species and is adapted to temperate, open country. Hares are herbivorous and feed mainly on grasses and herbs, supplementing these with twigs, buds, bark and field crops, particularly in winter. Their natural predators include large birds of prey, canids and felids. They rely on high-speed endurance running to escape predation, having long, powerful limbs and large nostrils.

Generally nocturnal and shy in nature, hares change their behaviour in the spring, when they can be seen in broad daylight chasing one another around in fields. During this spring frenzy, they sometimes strike one another with their paws (&quot;boxing&quot;). This is not just competition between males, but also a female hitting a male, either to show she is not yet ready to mate or to test his determination. The female nests in a depression on the surface of the ground rather than in a burrow and the young are active as soon as they are born. Litters may consist of three or four young and a female can bear three litters a year, with hares living for up to twelve years. The breeding season lasts from January to August.

The European hare is listed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature because it has a wide range and is moderately abundant. However, populations have been declining in mainland Europe since the 1960s, at least partly due to changes in farming practices. The hare has been hunted across Europe for centuries, with more than five million being shot each year; in Britain, it has traditionally been hunted by beagling and hare coursing, but these field sports are now illegal. The hare has been a traditional symbol of fertility and reproduction in some cultures and its courtship behaviour in the spring inspired the English idiom &quot;mad as a March hare&quot;.

== Taxonomy and genetics ==
The European hare was first described in 1778 by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas. It shares the genus &quot;Lepus&quot; (Latin for &quot;hare&quot;) with 32 other hare and jackrabbit species, jackrabbits being the name given to some species of hare native to North America. They are distinguished from other leporids (hares and rabbits) by their longer legs and wider nostrils. The Corsican hare, broom hare and Granada hare were at one time considered to be subspecies of the European hare, but DNA sequencing and morphological analysis support their status as separate species.

There is some debate as to whether the European hare and the Cape hare are the same species. A 2005 nuclear gene pool study suggested that they are, but a 2006 study of the mitochondrial DNA of these same animals concluded that they had diverged sufficiently widely to be considered separate species. A 2008 study claims that in the case of &quot;Lepus&quot; species, with their rapid evolution, species designation cannot be based solely on mtDNA but should also include an examination of the nuclear gene pool. It is possible that the genetic differences between the European and Cape hare are due to geographic separation rather than actual divergence. It has been speculated that in the Near East, hare populations are intergrading and experiencing gene flow. Another 2008 study suggests that more research is needed before a conclusion is reached as to whether a species complex exists; the European hare remains classified as a single species until further data contradicts this assumption.

Cladogenetic analysis suggests that European hares survived the last glacial period during the Pleistocene via refugia in southern Europe (Italian peninsula and Balkans) and Asia Minor. Subsequent colonisations of Central Europe appear to have been initiated by human-caused environmental changes. Genetic diversity in current populations is high with no signs of inbreeding. Gene flow appears to be biased towards males, but overall populations are matrilineally structured. There appears to be a particularly large degree of genetic diversity in hares in the North Rhine-Westphalia region of Germany. It is however possible that restricted gene flow could reduce genetic diversity within populations that become isolated.

Historically, up to 30 subspecies of European hare have been described, although their status has been disputed. These subspecies have been distinguished by differences in pelage colouration, body size, external body measurements, skull morphology and tooth shape.

Sixteen subspecies are listed in the IUCN red book, following Hoffmann and Smith (2005): 
Twenty-nine subspecies of &quot;very variable status&quot; are listed by Chapman and Flux in their book on lagomorphs, including the subspecies above (with the exceptions of &quot;L. e. connori&quot;, &quot;L. e. creticus&quot;, &quot;L. e. cyprius&quot;, &quot;L. e. judeae&quot;, &quot;L. e. rhodius&quot;, and &quot;L. e. syriacus&quot;) and additionally:
== Description ==
The European hare, like other members of the family Leporidae, is a fast-running terrestrial mammal; it has eyes set high on the sides of its head, long ears and a flexible neck. Its teeth grow continuously, the first incisors being modified for gnawing while the second incisors are peg-like and non-functional. There is a gap (diastema) between the incisors and the cheek teeth, the latter being adapted for grinding coarse plant material. The dental formula is 2/1, 0/0, 3/2, 3/3. The dark limb musculature of hares is adapted for high-speed endurance running in open country. By contrast, cottontail rabbits are built for short bursts of speed in more vegetated habitats. Other adaptions for high speed running in hares include wider nostrils and larger hearts. In comparison to the European rabbit, the hare has a proportionally smaller stomach and caecum.

This hare is one of the largest of the lagomorphs. Its head and body length can range from with a tail length of . The body mass is typically between . The hare&#x27;s elongated ears range from from the notch to tip. It also has long hind feet that have a length of between . The skull has nasal bones that are short, but broad and heavy. The supraorbital ridge has well-developed anterior and posterior lobes and the lacrimal bone projects prominently from the anterior wall of the orbit.

The fur colour is grizzled yellow-brown on the back; rufous on the shoulders, legs, neck and throat; white on the underside and black on the tail and ear tips. The fur on the back is typically longer and more curled than on the rest of the body. The European hare&#x27;s fur does not turn completely white in the winter as is the case with some other members of the genus, although the sides of the head and base of the ears do develop white areas and the hip and rump region may gain some grey.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The European hare is native to much of continental Europe and part of Asia. Its range extends from northern Spain to southern Scandinavia, eastern Europe, and northern parts of Western and Central Asia. It has been extending its range into Siberia. It may have been introduced to Great Britain by the Romans about 2000 years ago, based on a lack of archaeological evidence before that, although new radiocarbon dates suggest that it was introduced earlier, between 500-300BCE. It is not present in Ireland, where the mountain hare is the only native hare species. Undocumented introductions probably occurred in some Mediterranean Islands. It has also been introduced, mostly as game animal, to North America in Ontario and New York State, and unsuccessfully in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, the Southern Cone in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Peru and the Falkland Islands, Australia, both islands of New Zealand and the south Pacific coast of Russia.

The European hare primarily lives in open fields with scattered brush for shelter. It is very adaptable and thrives in mixed farmland. According to a study in the Czech Republic, the mean hare densities were highest at elevations below , 40 to 60 days of annual snow cover, of annual precipitation, and a mean annual air temperature of around . With regards to climate, the European hare density was highest in &quot;warm and dry districts with mild winters&quot;. In Poland, the European hare is most abundant in areas with few forest edges, perhaps because foxes can use these for cover. It requires cover, such as hedges, ditches and permanent cover areas, because these habitats supply the varied diet it requires, and are found at lower densities in large open fields. Intensive cultivation of the land results in greater mortality of young hares.

In Great Britain, the European hare is seen most frequently on arable farms, especially those with crop rotation and fallow land, wheat and sugar beet crops. In mainly grass farms, its numbers increased with are improved pastures, some arable crops and patches of woodland. It is seen less frequently where foxes are abundant or where there are many common buzzards. It also seems to be fewer in number in areas with high European rabbit populations, although there appears to be little interaction between the two species and no aggression. Although European hares are shot as game when plentiful, this is a self-limiting activity and is less likely to occur in localities where the species is scarce.

== Behaviour and life history ==

The European hare is primarily nocturnal and spends a third of its time foraging. During daytime, it hides in a depression in the ground called a &quot;form&quot; where it is partially hidden. It can run at , and when confronted by predators it relies on outrunning them in the open. It is generally thought of as asocial but can be seen in both large and small groups. It does not appear to be territorial, living in shared home ranges of around . It communicates with each other by a variety of visual signals. To show interest it raises its ears, while lowering the ears warns others to keep away. When challenging a conspecific, a hare thumps its front feet; the hind feet are used to warn others of a predator. It squeals when hurt or scared, and a female makes &quot;guttural&quot; calls to attract her young. It can live for as long as twelve years.

=== Food and foraging ===

The European hare is primarily herbivorous and forages for wild grasses and weeds. With the intensification of agriculture, it has taken to feeding on crops when preferred foods are not available. During the spring and summer, it feeds on soy, clover and corn poppy as well as grasses and herbs. During autumn and winter, it primarily chooses winter wheat, and is also attracted to piles of sugar beet and carrots provided by hunters. It also eats twigs, buds and the bark of shrubs and young fruit trees during winter. It avoids cereal crops when other more attractive foods are available, and appears to prefer high energy foodstuffs over crude dietary fiber. When eating twigs, it strips off the bark to access the vascular tissues which store soluble carbohydrates. Compared to the European rabbit, food passes through the gut more rapidly in the European hare, although digestion rates are similar. It is sometimes coprophagial eating its own green, faecal pellets to recover undigested proteins and vitamins. Two to three adult hares can eat more food than a single sheep.
European hares forage in groups. Group feeding is beneficial as individuals can spend more time feeding knowing that other hares are being vigilant. Nevertheless, the distribution of food affects these benefits. When food is well-spaced, all hares are able to access it. When food is clumped together, only dominant hares can access it. In small gatherings, dominants are more successful in defending food, but as more individuals join in, they must spend more time driving off others. The larger the group, the less time dominant individuals have in which to eat. Meanwhile, the subordinates can access the food while the dominants are distracted. As such, when in groups, all individuals fare worse when food is clumped as opposed to when it is widely spaced.

=== Mating and reproduction ===

European hares have a prolonged breeding season which lasts from January to August. Females, or does, can be found pregnant in all breeding months and males, or bucks, are fertile all year round except during October and November. After this hiatus, the size and activity of the males&#x27; testes increase, signalling the start of a new reproductive cycle. This continues through December, January and February when the reproductive tract gains back its functionality. Matings start before ovulation occurs and the first pregnancies of the year often result in a single foetus, with pregnancy failures being common. Peak reproductive activity occurs in March and April, when all females may be pregnant, the majority with three or more foetuses.

The mating system of the hare has been described as both polygynous (single males mating with multiple females) and promiscuous. Females have six-weekly reproductive cycles and are receptive for only a few hours at a time, making competition among local bucks intense. At the height of the breeding season, this phenomenon is known as &quot;March madness&quot;, when the normally nocturnal bucks are forced to be active in the daytime. In addition to dominant animals subduing subordinates, the female fights off her numerous suitors if she is not ready to mate. Fights can be vicious and can leave numerous scars on the ears. In these encounters, hares stand upright and attack each other with their paws, a practice known as &quot;boxing&quot;, and this activity is often between a female and a male and not purely between competing males as was previously believed. When a doe is ready to mate, she runs across the countryside, starting a chase that tests the stamina of the following males. When only the fittest male remains, the female stops and allows him to copulate. Female fertility continues through May, June and July, but testosterone production decreases in males and sexual behaviour becomes less overt. Litter sizes decrease as the breeding season draws to a close with no pregnancies occurring after August. The testes of males begin to regress and sperm production ends in September.
Does give birth in hollow depressions in the ground. An individual female may have three litters in a year with a 41- to 42-day gestation period. The young have an average weight of around at birth. The leverets are fully furred and are precocial, being ready to leave the nest soon after they are born, an adaptation to the lack of physical protection relative to that afforded by a burrow. Leverets disperse during the day and come together in the evening close to where they were born. Their mother visits them for nursing soon after sunset; the young suckle for around five minutes, urinating while they do so, with the doe licking up the fluid. She then leaps away so as not to leave an olfactory trail, and the leverets disperse once more. Young can eat solid food after two weeks and are weaned when they are four weeks old. While young of either sex commonly explore their surroundings, natal dispersal tends to be greater in males. Sexual maturity occurs at seven or eight months for females and six months for males.

=== Health and mortality ===

European hares are large leporids and adults can only be tackled by large predators such as canids, felids and the largest birds of prey. In Poland it was found that the consumption of hares by foxes was at its highest during spring, when the availability of small animal prey was low; at this time of year, hares may constitute up to 50% of the biomass eaten by foxes, with 50% of the mortality of adult hares being caused by their predation. In Scandinavia, a natural epizootic of sarcoptic mange which reduced the population of red foxes dramatically, resulted in an increase in the number of European hares, which returned to previous levels when the numbers of foxes subsequently increased. The golden eagle preys on the European hare in the Alps, the Carpathians, the Apennines and northern Spain. In North America, foxes and coyotes are probably the most common predators, with bobcats and lynx also preying on them in more remote locations.

European hares have both external and internal parasites. One study found that 54% of animals in Slovakia were parasitised by nematodes and over 90% by coccidia. In Australia, European hares were reported as being infected by four species of nematode, six of coccidian, several liver flukes and two canine tapeworms. They were also found to host rabbit fleas (&quot;Spilopsyllus cuniculi&quot;), stickfast fleas (&quot;Echidnophaga myrmecobii&quot;), lice (&quot;Haemodipsus setoni&quot; and &quot;H. lyriocephalus&quot;), and mites (&quot;Leporacarus gibbus&quot;).

European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) is a disease caused by a calicivirus similar to that causing rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) and can similarly be fatal, but cross infection between the two mammal species does not occur. Other threats to the hare are pasteurellosis, yersiniosis (pseudo-tuberculosis), coccidiosis and tularaemia, which are the principal sources of mortality.

In October 2018, it was reported that a mutated form of the rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV2) may have jumped to hares in the UK. Normally rare in hares, a significant die-off from the virus has also occurred in Spain.

== Relationship with humans ==
=== In folklore, literature, and art ===
In Europe, the hare has been a symbol of sex and fertility since at least Ancient Greece. The Greeks associated it with the gods Dionysus, Aphrodite and Artemis as well as with satyrs and cupids. The Christian Church connected the hare with lustfulness and homosexuality, but also associated it with the persecution of the church because of the way it was commonly hunted.

In Northern Europe, Easter imagery often involves hares or rabbits. Citing folk Easter customs in Leicestershire, England, where &quot;the profits of the land called Harecrop Leys were applied to providing a meal which was thrown on the ground at the &#x27;Hare-pie Bank&#x27;&quot;, the 19th-century scholar Charles Isaac Elton proposed a possible connection between these customs and the worship of Ēostre. In his 19th-century study of the hare in folk custom and mythology, Charles J. Billson cites folk customs involving the hare around Easter in Northern Europe, and argues that the hare was probably a sacred animal in prehistoric Britain&#x27;s festival of springtime. Observation of the hare&#x27;s springtime mating behaviour led to the popular English idiom &quot;mad as a March hare&quot;, with similar phrases from the sixteenth century writings of John Skelton and Sir Thomas More onwards. The mad hare reappears in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; by Lewis Carroll, in which Alice participates in a crazy tea-party with the March Hare and the Hatter.

Any connection of the hare to Ēostre is doubtful. John Andrew Boyle cites an etymology dictionary by Alfred Ernout and Antoine Meillet, who wrote that the lights of Ēostre were carried by hares, that Ēostre represented spring fecundity, love and sexual pleasure. Boyle responds that almost nothing is known about Ēostre, and that the authors had seemingly accepted the identification of Ēostre with the Norse goddess Freyja, but that the hare is not associated with Freyja either. Boyle adds that &quot;when the authors speak of the hare as the &#x27;companion of Aphrodite and of satyrs and cupids&#x27; and &#x27;in the Middle Ages [the hare] appears beside the figure of [mythological] Luxuria&#x27;, they are on much surer ground.&quot;

The hare is a character in some fables, such as &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot; of Aesop. The story was annexed to a philosophical problem by Zeno of Elea, who created a set of paradoxes to support Parmenides&#x27; attack on the idea of continuous motion, as each time the hare (or the hero Achilles) moves to where the tortoise was, the tortoise moves just a little further away. The German Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer realistically depicted a hare in his 1502 watercolour painting &quot;Young Hare&quot;.

=== Food and hunting ===
Across Europe, over five million European hares are shot each year, making it probably the most important game mammal on the continent. This popularity has threatened regional varieties such as those of France and Denmark, through large-scale importing of hares from Eastern European countries such as Hungary. Hares have traditionally been hunted in Britain by beagling and hare coursing. In beagling, the hare is hunted with a pack of small hunting dogs, beagles, followed by the human hunters on foot. In Britain, the 2004 Hunting Act banned hunting of hares with dogs, so the 60 beagle packs now use artificial &quot;trails&quot;, or may legally continue to hunt rabbits. Hare coursing with greyhounds was once an aristocratic pursuit, forbidden to lower social classes. More recently, informal hare coursing became a lower class activity and was conducted without the landowner&#x27;s permission; it is also now illegal. In Scotland concerns have been raised over the increasing numbers of hares shot under license.

Hare is traditionally cooked by jugging: a whole hare is cut into pieces, marinated and cooked slowly with red wine and juniper berries in a tall jug that stands in a pan of water. It is traditionally served with (or briefly cooked with) the hare&#x27;s blood and port wine. Hare can also be cooked in a casserole. The meat is darker and more strongly flavoured than that of rabbits. Young hares can be roasted; the meat of older hares becomes too tough for roasting, and may be slow-cooked.

== Status ==

The European hare has a wide range across Europe and western Asia and has been introduced to a number of other countries around the globe, often as a game species. In general it is considered moderately abundant in its native range, but declines in populations have been noted in many areas since the 1960s. These have been associated with the intensification of agricultural practices. The hare is an adaptable species and can move into new habitats, but it thrives best when there is an availability of a wide variety of weeds and other herbs to supplement its main diet of grasses. The hare is considered a pest in some areas; it is more likely to damage crops and young trees in winter when there are not enough alternative foodstuffs available.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature has evaluated the European hare&#x27;s conservation status as being of least concern. However, at low population densities, hares are vulnerable to local extinctions as the available gene pool declines, making inbreeding more likely. This is the case in northern Spain and in Greece, where the restocking by hares brought from outside the region has been identified as a threat to regional gene pools. To counteract this, a captive breeding program has been implemented in Spain, and the relocation of some individuals from one location to another has increased genetic variety. The Bern Convention lists the hare under Appendix III as a protected species. Several countries, including Norway, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, have placed the species on their Red Lists as &quot;near threatened&quot; or &quot;threatened&quot;.

<doc id="322244" wikidata="Q233516" url="?curid=322244" title="Louise, Princess Royal">
<text>Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife (Louise Victoria Alexandra Dagmar; 20 February 1867 – 4 January 1931) was the third child and eldest daughter of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom; she was a younger sister of King George V. Louise was given the title of Princess Royal in 1905. Known for her shy and quiet personality, Louise remained a low-key member of the royal family throughout her life.

==Early life==

Louise was born on 20 February 1867 at Marlborough House, the London residence of her parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales. Louise&#x27;s father was the eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Her mother was the eldest daughter of Christian IX and Queen Louise of Denmark. From birth, as a male-line granddaughter of the British monarch, she had the title &quot;Her Royal Highness Princess Louise of Wales&quot;. She spent much of her childhood at Sandringham House in Norfolk. She was baptised at Marlborough House on 10 May by Charles Longley, Archbishop of Canterbury. Like her sisters Victoria and Maud, she was educated under the supervision of tutors and studied guitar under Catharina Pratten. She occasionally spent the summer in Denmark, her mother&#x27;s homeland. In her youth, Louise was described as a very withdrawn girl.

Louise and her sisters, Victoria and Maud, were bridesmaids at the wedding of their paternal aunt Princess Beatrice to Prince Henry of Battenberg in 1885.

==Marriage and children==

Despite her mother&#x27;s attempts to keep her daughters unmarried and by her side, on 27 July 1889, Louise married Alexander Duff, 6th Earl Fife, who was eighteen years her senior, at the Private Chapel in Buckingham Palace with the Archbishop of Canterbury officiating at the service. They were third cousins through an illegitimate line, as Alexander was a great-grandchild of William IV and Dorothea Jordan. Her bridesmaids were Princesses Maud and Victoria of Wales, Victoria Mary of Teck, Marie Louise and Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein and the Countesses Feodora, Helena and Valda Gleichen. “O Perfect Love, all human thought transcending&quot;, was written by Dorothy Blomfield for her sister&#x27;s marriage in 1883, and was intended to be sung to Strength and Stay, in Hymns Ancient &amp; Modern, No. 12. Subsequently, it was set as an anthem by J. Barnby for the marriage of the Duke of Fife with the Princess Louise of Wales that day. Two days after the wedding, Queen Victoria created him Duke of Fife and Marquess of Macduff in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The letters patent creating this dukedom contained the standard remainder to heirs male of the body lawfully begotten. After the birth of their two daughters, on 24 April 1900, Queen Victoria signed letters patent creating a second Dukedom of Fife, along with the Earldom of Macduff in the Peerage of the United Kingdom with a special remainder: in default of a male heir, these peerages would pass to the daughters of the 1st Duke, and then to their male descendants.
The Duke and Duchess of Fife had three children:

* Alastair Duff, Marquess of Macduff (stillborn 16 June 1890)
* Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife (17 May 1891 – 26 February 1959); married her first cousin once removed Prince Arthur of Connaught (13 January 1883 – 12 September 1938), and had issue.
* Princess Maud (3 April 1893 – 14 December 1945); married Charles Carnegie, 11th Earl of Southesk, and had issue.

The couple made their home at Mar Lodge, a sporting lodge built for them by Alexander Marshall Mackenzie.

==Princess Royal==

On 9 November 1905, Edward VII created Louise the Princess Royal, the highest honour bestowed on a female member of the royal family. At the same time, the King declared that the two daughters of the Princess Royal would be styled as princesses, with the style and attribute of &quot;Highness&quot; and with precedence immediately after all members of the royal family bearing the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.

In December 1911, while sailing aboard SS &quot;Delhi&quot; to Egypt, the Princess Royal and her family were shipwrecked off the coast of Morocco. Although they were otherwise unharmed, the Duke of Fife fell ill with pleurisy, probably contracted as a result of the shipwreck. He died at Assuan, Egypt, in January 1912, and Princess Alexandra succeeded to his dukedom, becoming Duchess of Fife in her own right.

==Later life and death==
After the death of her husband, Louise led a reclusive life. Sometimes, she accompanied her mother and her sister Victoria to public events. In the years leading up to her death, Louise suffered from heart disease. In October 1929, at Mar Lodge, she was taken ill with gastric haemorrhage and was brought back to London. Louise succumbed to heart disease in her sleep at 2:30PM on 4 January 1931 at age 63 at her home at 15 Portman Square London, with her two daughters, Alexandra and Maud, at her bedside. She was tenth in line to the throne at the time of her death. Her brother, King George V, wrote to their sister Maud, &quot;Louise suffered so terribly these last few months that one can but thank God. She is at peace with her dear ones. But it&#x27;s sad for us, and the loss of a sister comes very near one&#x27;s heart.&quot; She was buried in St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. Her remains were later removed to the Private Chapel, Mar Lodge, Braemar, Aberdeenshire. Her will was sealed and her estate was valued at £46,383 (or £2.2 million in 2022 when adjusted for inflation).

==Honours and arms==
* 1885: Royal Order of Victoria and Albert
* 6 August 1887: Imperial Order of the Crown of India
* 1929: Dame Grand Cross of the Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem (GCStJ)
** 1888–1929: Lady of the Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem (LJStJ)

=== Honorary military appointments ===
* 1911: Lady Sponsor of HMS &quot;Princess Royal&quot;
* 1914: Colonel-in-chief of the 7th Dragoon Guards
* 1922: Colonel-in-chief of the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards

===Arms===
Upon her marriage, Louise was granted a coat of arms, being the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom with an inescutcheon for Saxony, all differenced with a label argent of five points, the outer pair and centre bearing crosses gules, and the inner pair bearing thistles proper. The inescutcheon was dropped by royal warrant in 1917.

<text>The 1900 Galveston hurricane, also known as the Great Galveston hurricane and the Galveston Flood, and known regionally as the Great Storm of 1900 or the 1900 Storm, is the deadliest natural disaster in United States history. The strongest storm of the 1900 Atlantic hurricane season, it left between 6,000 and 12,000 fatalities in the United States; the number most cited in official reports is 8,000. Most of these deaths occurred in and near Galveston, Texas, after the storm surge inundated the coastline and the island city with 8 to 12 ft (2.4 to 3.7 m) of water. As of 2025, it remains the fourth deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record, behind Hurricane Fifi of 1974. In addition to the number killed, the storm destroyed about 7,000 buildings of all uses in Galveston, which included 3,636 demolished homes; every dwelling in the city suffered some degree of damage. The hurricane left approximately 10,000 people in the city homeless, out of a total population of fewer than 38,000. The disaster ended the Golden Era of Galveston, as the hurricane alarmed potential investors, who turned to Houston instead. In response to the storm, three engineers designed and oversaw plans to raise the Gulf of Mexico shoreline of Galveston Island by and erect a seawall.

On August 27, 1900, a ship east of the Windward Islands detected a tropical cyclone, the first observed that year. The system proceeded to move steadily west-northwestward and entered the northeastern Caribbean on August 30. It made landfall in the Dominican Republic as a weak tropical storm on September 2. It weakened slightly while crossing Hispaniola, before re-emerging into the Caribbean Sea later that day. On September 3, the cyclone struck modern-day Santiago de Cuba Province and then slowly drifted along the southern coast of Cuba. Upon reaching the Gulf of Mexico on September 6, the storm strengthened into a hurricane. Significant intensification followed and the system peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of on September 8. Early on the next day, it made landfall to the south of Houston. The cyclone weakened quickly after moving inland and fell to tropical storm intensity late on September 9. The storm turned east-northeastward and became extratropical over Iowa on September 11. The extratropical system strengthened while accelerating across the Midwestern United States, New England, and Eastern Canada before reaching the Gulf of Saint Lawrence on September 13. After striking Newfoundland later that day, the extratropical storm entered the far North Atlantic Ocean and weakened, with the remnants last observed near Iceland on September 15.

The great storm brought flooding and severe thunderstorms to portions of the Caribbean, especially Cuba and Jamaica. It is likely that much of South Florida experienced tropical storm-force winds, though mostly minor damage occurred. Hurricane-force winds and storm surge inundated portions of southern Louisiana, though the cyclone left no significant structural damage or fatalities in the state. The hurricane brought strong winds and storm surge to a large portion of east Texas, with Galveston suffering the brunt of the impact. Farther north, the storm and its remnants continued to produce heavy rains and gusty winds, which downed telegraph wires, signs, and trees in several states. Fatalities occurred in other states, including fifteen in Ohio, two in Illinois, two in New York, one in Massachusetts, and one in Missouri. Damage from the storm throughout the U.S. exceeded US$34 million. The remnants also brought severe impact to Canada. In Ontario, damage reached about C$1.35 million, with CAD$1 million to crops. The remnants of the hurricane caused at least 52 deaths – and possibly as many as 232 deaths – in Canada, mostly due to sunken vessels near Newfoundland and the French territory of Saint-Pierre. Throughout its path, the storm caused more than $35.4 million in damage. ($1.3 billion in 2023.)

==Meteorological history==

The storm is believed to have originated from a tropical wave which moved off the west coast of Africa and then emerged into the Atlantic Ocean. However, this is not completely certain because of the limited observational methods available to contemporary meteorologists, with ship reports being the only reliable tool for observing hurricanes. The first formal sighting of the tropical storm occurred on August 27, about east of the Windward Islands, when a ship encountered an area of unsettled weather. Over the next couple of days, the system moved west-northwestwards and is thought to have maintained its intensity as a weak tropical storm, before it passed through the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea on August 31.

On September 1, Father Reese Gangoite, the director of the Belen College Observatory in Havana, Cuba, noted that the storm was in its formative stages, with only vague indications of a small tropical cyclone to the southwest of Saint Croix. During that day, the system passed to the south of Puerto Rico before it made landfall near Baní, Dominican Republic, early on September 2. Moving west-northwestward, the storm crossed the island of Hispaniola and entered into the Windward Passage near Saint-Marc, Haiti, several hours later. The system made landfall on Cuba near Santiago de Cuba during September 3, before it moved slowly west-northwestward across the island and emerged into Straits of Florida as a tropical storm on September 5. As the system emerged into the Straits of Florida, Gangoite observed a large, persistent halo around the moon, while the sky turned deep red and cirrus clouds moved northwards. This indicated to him that the tropical storm had intensified and that the prevailing winds were moving the system towards the coast of Texas. However, the United States Weather Bureau (as it was then called) disagreed with this forecast, as they expected the system to recurve and make landfall in Florida before impacting the American East Coast. An area of high pressure over the Florida Keys ultimately moved the system northwestward into the Gulf of Mexico, where favorable conditions such as warm sea surface temperatures allowed the storm to intensify into a hurricane.

In the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September 6, the ship &quot;Louisiana&quot; encountered the hurricane, and its captain, T. P. Halsey, estimated that the system had wind speeds of . The hurricane continued to strengthen significantly while heading west-northwestward across the Gulf. On September 7, the system reached its peak intensity with estimated sustained wind speeds of , which made it equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson scale. That day, the Weather Bureau realized that the storm was continuing west-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, rather than turning northward over Florida and the East Coast as it had predicted. However, Weather Bureau director Willis Luther Moore insisted that the cyclone was not of hurricane intensity. The hurricane weakened slightly on September 8 and recurved to the northwest as it approached the coast of Texas, while the Weather Bureau office in Galveston began observing hurricane-force winds by 22:00 UTC.

The cyclone made landfall around 8:00 p.m CST on September 8 (02:00 UTC on September 9) to the south of Houston as a Category 4 hurricane. While crossing Galveston Island and West Bay, the eye passed southwest of the city of Galveston. The hurricane quickly weakened after moving inland, falling to tropical storm intensity late on September 9. The storm lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Iowa by 12:00 UTC on September 11. Moving rapidly east-northeastward, the extratropical system re-intensified, becoming the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane over Ontario on September 12. The extratropical remnants reached the Gulf of Saint Lawrence early the following day. After crossing Newfoundland and entering the far northern Atlantic hours later, the remnants of the hurricane weakened and were last noted near Iceland on September 15 where the storm finally dissipated.

==Background==

The city of Galveston, formally founded in 1839, had weathered numerous storms, all of which the city survived with ease. In the late 19th century, Galveston was a boomtown with the population increasing from 29,084 people in 1890 to 37,788 people in 1900. The city was the fourth largest municipality in terms of population in the state of Texas in 1900, and had among the highest per capita income rates in the U.S. Galveston had many ornate business buildings in a downtown section called The Strand, which was considered the &quot;Wall Street of the Southwest&quot;. The city&#x27;s position on the natural harbor of Galveston Bay along the Gulf of Mexico made it the center of trade in Texas, and one of the busiest ports in the nation. With this prosperity came a sense of complacency, as residents believed any future storms would be no worse than previous events. In fact, Isaac Cline, director of the Weather Bureau&#x27;s Galveston office, wrote an 1891 article in the &quot;Galveston Daily News&quot; that it would be impossible for a hurricane of significant strength to strike Galveston Island.

A quarter of a century earlier, the nearby town of Indianola on Matagorda Bay was undergoing its own boom. Then in 1875, a powerful hurricane blew through and nearly destroyed the town. Indianola was rebuilt, though a second hurricane in 1886 caused most of the town&#x27;s residents to move elsewhere. Many Galveston residents took the destruction of Indianola as an object lesson on the threat posed by hurricanes. Galveston is built on a low, flat island, little more than a large sandbar along the Gulf Coast. These residents proposed a seawall be constructed to protect the city, but the majority of the population and the city&#x27;s government dismissed their concerns. Cline further argued in his 1891 article in the &quot;Daily News&quot; that a seawall was not needed due to his belief that a strong hurricane would not strike the island. As a result, the seawall was not built, and development activities on the island actively increased its vulnerability to storms. Sand dunes along the shore were cut down to fill low areas in the city, removing what little barrier there was to the Gulf of Mexico.

==Preparations==
On September 4, the Weather Bureau&#x27;s Galveston office began receiving warnings from the Bureau&#x27;s central office in Washington, D.C. that a tropical disturbance had moved northward over Cuba. At the time, they discouraged the use of terms such as &quot;hurricane&quot; or &quot;tornado&quot; to avoid panicking residents in the path of any storm event. The Weather Bureau forecasters had no way of knowing the storm&#x27;s trajectory, as Weather Bureau director Willis Luther Moore implemented a policy to block telegraph reports from Cuban meteorologists at the meteorological observatory of the Colegio de Belén in Havana – considered one of the most advanced meteorological institutions in the world at the time – due to tensions in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War. Moore also changed protocol to force local Weather Bureau offices to seek authorization from the central office before issuing storm warnings.

Weather Bureau forecasters believed that the storm had begun a northward curve into Florida and that it would eventually turn northeastward and emerge over the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, the central office of the Weather Bureau issued a storm warning in Florida from Cedar Key to Miami on September 5. By the following day, a hurricane warning was in effect along the coast from Cedar Key to Savannah, Georgia, while storm warnings were displayed from Charleston, South Carolina, to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, as well as from Pensacola, Florida, to New Orleans, Louisiana. Cuban forecasters adamantly disagreed with the Weather Bureau, saying the hurricane would continue west. One Cuban forecaster predicted the hurricane would continue into central Texas near San Antonio.

In Galveston on the morning of September 8, the swells persisted despite only partly cloudy skies. Largely because of the unremarkable weather, few residents saw cause for concern. Few people evacuated across Galveston&#x27;s bridges to the mainland, and the majority of the population was unconcerned by the rain clouds that began rolling in by midmorning. According to his memoirs, Isaac Cline personally traveled by horse along the beach and other low-lying areas to warn people of the storm&#x27;s approach. However, these accounts by Cline and his brother, Galveston meteorologist Joseph L. Cline, have since been in dispute. Although Isaac Cline is credited with issuing a hurricane warning without permission from the Bureau&#x27;s central office, author Erik Larson points to his earlier insistence that a seawall was unnecessary and his notion that an intense hurricane could not strike the island, with Cline even considering it &quot;simply an absurd delusion&quot; to believe otherwise. Further, according to Larson, no other survivors are known to have corroborated these accounts.

==Impact==
===Caribbean===
Antigua reported a severe thunderstorm passing over on August 30, with lower barometric pressures and of rain on the island. In Puerto Rico, the storm produced winds up to at San Juan. In Jamaica, heavy rainfall from the storm caused all rivers to swell. Floodwaters severely damaged banana plantations and washed away miles of railroads. Damage estimates ranged in the thousands of British pounds. Heavy rains fell in Cuba in association with the cyclone, including a peak 24-hour total of in the city of Santiago de Cuba. The city experienced its worst weather since 1877. The southern end of the city was submerged with about of water. Firefighters and police rescued and aided stranded residents. &quot;St. George&quot;, a German steamer, ran aground at Daiquirí. A telegraph from the mayor of Trinidad, who was asking for assistance from the U.S. occupation government, indicated that the storm destroyed all crops and left many people destitute.

===United States===

The Great Galveston hurricane made landfall on September 8, 1900, near Galveston, Texas. It had estimated winds of at landfall, making the cyclone a Category 4 storm on the modern day Saffir–Simpson scale.
The hurricane caused great loss of life, with a death toll of between 6,000 and 12,000 people; the number most cited in official reports is 8,000, giving the storm the third-highest number of deaths of all Atlantic hurricanes, after the Great Hurricane of 1780 and Hurricane Mitch in 1998. The Galveston hurricane of 1900 is the deadliest natural disaster to strike the United States. This loss of life can be attributed to the fact that officials for the Weather Bureau in Galveston brushed off the reports and they did not realize the threat.

More than US$34 million in damage occurred throughout the United States, with about US$30 million in Galveston County, Texas, alone. If a similar storm struck in 2010, damage would total approximately US$104.33 billion (2010 USD), based on normalization, a calculation that takes into account changes in inflation, wealth, and population. In comparison, the costliest United States hurricanes – Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Harvey in 2017 – both caused about US$125 billion in damage.

The hurricane occurred before the practice of assigning official code names to tropical storms was instituted, and thus it is commonly referred to under a variety of descriptive names. Typical names for the storm include the &quot;Galveston hurricane of 1900&quot;, the &quot;Great Galveston hurricane&quot;, and, especially in older documents and publications, the &quot;Galveston Flood&quot;. It is often referred to by Galveston locals as the &quot;Great Storm of 1900&quot; or the &quot;1900 Storm&quot;.

====Florida to Louisiana====

Portions of South Florida experienced tropical storm-force winds, with a sustained wind speed of in Jupiter and in Key West. The hurricane left &quot;considerable damage&quot; in the Palm Beach area, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Many small boats were torn from their moorings and capsized. The bulkhead of the pier was washed away, while docks and several seawalls were damaged. Rainfall in the state peaked at in Hypoluxo. High winds in North Florida downed telegraph lines between Jacksonville and Pensacola. In Mississippi, the city of Pass Christian recorded winds of . Tides produced by the storm inundated about of railroad tracks in Pascagoula (then known as Scranton), while a quarantine station on Ship Island was swept away.

In Louisiana, the storm produced gale-force winds as far inland as DeRidder and as far east as New Orleans, with hurricane-force winds observed in Cameron Parish. Along the coast, storm surge inundated Johnson Bayou, while tides at some locations reached their highest level since the 1875 Indianola hurricane. Winds and storm surge caused severe damage to rice crops, with at least 25% destroyed throughout the state. The community of Pointe à la Hache experienced a near-total loss of rice crops. Farther east, roads were flooded by storm surge in the communities of Gretna and Harvey near New Orleans, leaving the streets impassable via horses. Winds downed telegraph lines in the southeastern Louisiana in the vicinity of Port Eads. Two men were initially presumed to have drowned after sailing away from Fort St. Philip and not returning in a timely manner, but they were both later found alive.

====Texas====

Nearly all of the damage in the United States occurred in Texas, with much of the damage in Galveston. However, many communities outside of Galveston also suffered serious damage and it caused many casualties and affected many families economically, with several cities reporting a near or complete loss of all buildings or homes, including Alta Loma, Alvin, Angleton, Brazoria, Brookshire, Chenango, El Campo, Pearland, and Richmond. Throughout Texas – in areas other than Galveston – at least $3 million in damage occurred to cotton crops, $75,000 to telegraph and telephone poles, and $60,000 to railroads.

At Alvin, of rain fell on September 8, the highest 24-hour total for that city in the month of September. The city suffered nine fatalities and about $50,000 in damage. In West Columbia, the storm destroyed the old capitol building of the former Republic of Texas. Eight deaths occurred in the city. In Quintana, the city experienced extensive damage during this storm and a flood in 1899, causing portions of the community to be abandoned. Throughout Brazoria County alone, the hurricane caused nearly $200,000 in damage and 47 deaths. Houston also experienced significant damage. The hurricane wrought damage to many buildings, including a Masonic temple, a railroad powerhouse, an opera house, a courthouse, and many businesses, churches, homes, hotels, and school buildings. Streets were littered with branches from shade trees and downed electrical wires, leaving several roads completely impassable to vehicles. The city of Houston suffered about $250,000 in damage and two deaths, one of which occurred when a man was struck by falling timber.

A train heading for Galveston left Houston on the morning of September 8 at 9:45 a.m. CST (15:45 UTC). It found the tracks washed out, and passengers were forced to transfer to a relief train on parallel tracks to complete their journey. Even then, debris on the track slowed the train&#x27;s progress to a crawl. The 95 travelers on the train from Beaumont found themselves at the Bolivar Peninsula waiting for the ferry that would carry them to the island. When it arrived, the high seas forced the ferry captain to give up on his attempt to dock. The train crew attempted to return the way they had come, but rising water blocked the train&#x27;s path. Ten refugees from the Beaumont train sought shelter at the Point Bolivar lighthouse with 190 residents of Port Bolivar who were already there. The 85 who stayed with the train died when the storm surge overran the tops of the cars, while every person inside the lighthouse survived.

=====Galveston=====
At the time of the 1900 hurricane, the highest point in the city of Galveston was only above sea level. The hurricane brought with it a storm surge of over that washed over the entire island. Storm surge and tides began flooding the city by the early morning hours of September 8. Water rose steadily from 3:00 p.m. (21:00 UTC) until approximately 7:30 p.m. (01:30 UTC September 9), when eyewitness accounts indicated that water rose about in just four seconds. An additional of water had flowed into portions of the city by 8:30 p.m. (02:30 UTC September 9). The cyclone dropped of precipitation in Galveston on September 8, setting a record for the most rainfall for any 24-hour period in the month of September in the city&#x27;s history.

The highest measured wind speed was just after 6:15 p.m. on September 8 (00:15
 UTC September 9), but the Weather Bureau&#x27;s anemometer was blown off the building shortly after that measurement was recorded. Contemporaneous estimates placed the maximum sustained wind speed at . However, survivors reported observing bricks, slate, timbers, and other heavy objects becoming airborne, indicating that winds were likely stronger. Later estimates placed the hurricane at the higher Category 4 classification on the Saffir–Simpson scale. The lowest recorded barometric pressure was , but this was subsequently adjusted to the storm&#x27;s official lowest measured central pressure of about .

Few streets in the city escaped wind damage and all streets suffered water damage, with much of the destruction caused by storm surge. All bridges connecting the island to the mainland were washed away, while approximately of railroad track was destroyed. Winds and storm surge also downed electrical, telegraph, and telephone wires. The surge swept buildings off their foundations and dismantled them. Many buildings and homes destroyed other structures after being pushed into them by the waves, which even demolished structures built to withstand hurricanes. Every home in Galveston suffered damage, with 3,636 homes destroyed. Approximately 10,000 people in the city were left homeless, out of a total population of nearly 38,000. Portrait and landscape artist Verner Moore White who moved from Galveston the day before the hurricane and survived, had his studio and much of his portfolio destroyed. The Tremont Hotel, where hundreds of people sought refuge during the storm, was severely damaged. All public buildings also suffered damage, including city hall – which was completely deroofed – a hospital, a city gas works, a city water works, and the custom house. The Grand Opera House also sustained extensive damage, but was quickly rebuilt.

Three schools and St. Mary&#x27;s University were nearly destroyed. Many places of worship in the city also received severe damage or were completely demolished. Of the 39 churches in Galveston, 25 experienced complete destruction, while the others received some degree of damage. During the storm, the St. Mary&#x27;s Orphans Asylum, owned by the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word, was occupied by 93 children and 10 sisters. As tides began approaching the property, the sisters moved the children into the girl&#x27;s dorm, as it was newer and sturdier. Realizing they were under threat, the sisters had the children repeatedly sing Queen of the Waves to calm them. As the collapse of the building appeared imminent, the sisters used a clothesline to tie themselves to six to eight children. The building eventually collapsed. Only three of the children and none of the sisters survived. The few buildings that survived, mostly solidly built mansions and houses along the Strand District, are today maintained as tourist attractions.
Early property damage estimates were placed at $25 million. However, itemized estimates from 1901 based on assessments conducted by the &quot;Galveston News&quot;, the Galveston chamber of commerce, a relief committee, and multiple insurance companies indicated that the storm caused just over $17 million in damage throughout Galveston, including about $8.44 million to residential properties, $500,000 to churches, $656,000 to wharves and shipping properties, $580,000 to manufacturing plants, $397,000 to mercantile buildings, $1.4 million to store merchandise, $670,000 to railroads and telegraph and telephone services, $416,000 to products in shipment, $336,000 to municipality properties, $243,000 to county properties, and $3.16 million to United States government properties. The total also included $115,000 in damage to schools and approximately $100,000 in damage to roads.

The area of destruction – an area in which nothing remained standing after the storm – consisted of approximately of land and was arc-shaped, with complete demolition of structures in the west, south, and eastern portions of the city, while the north-central section of the city suffered the least amount of damage. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, a long, wall of debris was situated in the middle of the island. As severe as the damage to the city&#x27;s buildings was, the death toll was even greater. Because of the destruction of the bridges to the mainland and the telegraph lines, no word of the city&#x27;s destruction was able to reach the mainland at first. 

On the morning of September 9, one of the few ships at the Galveston wharfs to survive the storm, the &quot;Pherabe&quot;, set sail and arrived in Texas City on the western side of Galveston Bay with a group of messengers from the city. When they reached the telegraph office in Houston early on September 10, a short message was sent to Texas Governor Joseph D. Sayers and U.S. President William McKinley: &quot;I have been deputized by the mayor and Citizen&#x27;s Committee of Galveston to inform you that the city of Galveston is in ruins.&quot; The messengers reported an estimated five hundred dead; this was initially considered to be an exaggeration. The citizens of Houston knew a powerful storm had blown through and had prepared to provide assistance. Workers set out by rail and ship for the island almost immediately. Rescuers arrived to find the city completely destroyed.

A survey conducted by the Morrison and Fourmy Company in early 1901 indicated a population loss of 8,124, though the company believed that about 2,000 people left the city after the storm and never returned. On this basis, the death toll is no less than 6,000, while estimates range up to 12,000. It is believed 8,000 people—20% of the island&#x27;s population—had lost their lives. Most had drowned or been crushed as the waves pounded the debris that had been their homes hours earlier. A number of fatalities also occurred after strong winds turned debris into projectiles. Many survived the storm itself but died after several days being trapped under the wreckage of the city, with rescuers unable to reach them. The rescuers could hear the screams of the survivors as they walked on the debris trying to rescue those they could. More people were killed in this single storm than the total of those killed in at least the next two deadliest tropical cyclones that have struck the United States since. The Galveston hurricane of 1900 remains the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history. The disaster did not even spare the buried dead; a number of coffins, including reportedly that of actor-playwright Charles Francis Coghlan who had died in Galveston the previous year, were washed out of the local cemetery to sea by the tidal storm surge.

====Midwest====
After moving northward from Texas into Oklahoma, the storm produced winds of near at Oklahoma City. The extratropical remnants of the cyclone then re-intensified to the equivalence of a tropical storm and continued to strengthen, bringing strong winds to the Midwestern United States. High winds in Missouri toppled a brick wall under construction in St. Joseph, killing a man and severely injuring another. In Illinois, particularly hard hit was the city of Chicago, which experienced wind gusts up to . Thousands of dollars in damage occurred to roofs, trees, signs, and windows. Several people were injured and two deaths occurred in the city, one from a live wire and the other was a drowning after a boat capsized in Lake Michigan. In Wisconsin, many weather stations in the northern and central portions of the state recorded at least of rainfall, including a peak total of in Shawano. Heavy rains fell in parts of Minnesota. The Minneapolis–Saint Paul area recorded of precipitation over a period of 16 hours. Farther north, several washouts occurred, especially in the northern areas of the state. A bridge, along with a few train cars, were swept away during a washout in Cold Spring.

In Michigan, the storm produced winds around at Muskegon. Tides from Lake Michigan were the highest in several months. According to &quot;The Times Herald&quot;, the city of Marshall experienced &quot;the severest windstorm of the season&quot;, which uprooted trees and damaged several buildings. Throughout the state, winds left at least $12,000 in losses to peach orchards, with many peach trees uprooted. Significant losses to apples and pears also occurred. Rough seas in Lake Erie resulted in several maritime incidents offshore Ohio. The &quot;John B. Lyon&quot;, a steamer, capsized about north of Conneaut. Fourteen out of sixteen crew members drowned. A survivor suggested that the ship being overloaded may have been a factor in its sinking. About farther north, the schooner &quot;Dundee&quot; sank, causing at least one death. In another incident nearby, the steamer &quot;City of Erie&quot;, with about 300 passengers aboard, was hit by a wave that swept over the bulwarks. The engine slowed and the steamers later reached safety in Canada with no loss of lives. In Toledo, strong winds disrupted telegraph services. Winds also blew water out of parts of the Maumee River and Maumee Bay to such an extent that they were impassable by vessels due to low water levels. A number of vessels were buried in mud several feet deep, while about 20 others were beached.

====New York====

Of the many cities in New York affected by the remnants of the hurricane, Buffalo was among the hardest hit. There, winds peaked at , downing hundreds of electrical, telegraph, and telephone wires, while numerous trees toppled and some branches fell onto roadways. An oil derrick blew away and landed on the roof of a house, crushing the roof and nearly killing the occupants. A newly built iron works building was virtually destroyed, causing a loss of about $10,000. At the Pan-American Exposition, the storm damaged several structures, including part of the government building, while two towers were destroyed. Losses at the exposition alone were conservatively estimated at $75,000. One death occurred in Buffalo after a woman inadvertently touched a downed electrical wire obscured by debris. Several nearby resorts received extensive damage. At Woodlawn Beach, several dozens of small boats and a pier were destroyed. Nearly all vessels owned by the Buffalo Canoe Club suffered severe damage or destruction at Crystal Beach. A toboggan slide and a restaurant were also destroyed. Losses in Crystal Beach reached about $5,000. Heavy crop losses occurred over western New York, with fallen apples and peaches completely covering the ground at thousands of acres of orchards. Losses reportedly ranged in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The rapidly moving storm was still exhibiting winds of while passing well north of New York City on September 12. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that pedestrian-walking became difficult and attributed one death to the storm. A sign pole, snapped by the wind, landed on a 23-year-old man, crushing his skull and killing him instantly, while two others were knocked unconscious. Awnings and signs on many buildings broke and the canvas roofing at the Fire Department headquarters was blown off. Closer to the waterfront, along the Battery seawall, waves and tides were reported to be some of the highest in recent memory of the fishermen and sailors. Spray and debris were thrown over the wall, making walking along the waterfront dangerous. Small craft in New York Harbor were thrown off course and tides and currents in the Hudson River made navigation difficult. In Brooklyn, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that trees were uprooted, signs and similar structures were blown down, and yachts were torn from moorings with some suffering severe damage. Because of the direction of the wind, Coney Island escaped the fury of the storm, though a bathing pavilion at Bath Beach suffered damage from wind and waves.

====New England====
In Connecticut, winds gusted up to about . The apple crops, already endangered by drought conditions, suffered severe damage, with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; noting that there was, &quot;hardly an apple left on a tree in the entire state&quot;. In the town of Orange, twelve large tents at a fair were ripped. At another fair in New Milford, fifteen tents collapsed, forcing closure of the fair. Along the coast, the storm produced abnormally high tides, with tides reaching their highest heights in six years at Westbrook. Water reached the bulkheads and remained there for several hours. In Rhode Island, the storm left damage in the vicinity of Providence. Telegraph and telephone services were interrupted, but not to such a large extent. Some small crafts in Narragansett Bay received damage, while apple orchards experienced slight losses.

Lightning produced by the storm ignited several brush fires in Massachusetts, particularly in the southeastern portions of the state, with winds spreading the flames. In Plymouth and other nearby towns, some residents evacuated from the fires by boat. Most cottages around the Big Long, Gallows, Halfway, and Little Long ponds were reduced to burning coals. In Everett, orchards in the Woodlawn section suffered complete losses of fruit. Two wooden frame building were demolished, while winds also toppled fences throughout the city. Winds damaged many telephone and electric wires in Cambridge. A lineman sent to fix the electrical wires nearly died when a pole snapped during a fierce wind gust. Orchards in the city suffered near complete loss and many shade trees were also damaged. At least a few chimneys toppled and several others were left leaning. A bathhouse at Harvard University lost a portion of its tin roof and its copper cornices. At Cape Cod, a wind speed of was observed at Highland Light in North Truro. Waves breached the sand dunes at multiple locations along the cape, with water sweeping across a county road at Beach Point in North Truro. A number of fishing boats sank and several fish houses received severe damage. One man drowned in a lake near Andover while canoeing during the storm.

Strong winds in Vermont generated rough seas in Lake Champlain. Early reports indicated that a schooner sunk near Adams Ferry with no survivors, but the vessel was later found safely anchored at Westport, New York. According to a man near the lake, all water from the New York portion of the lake was blown to the Vermont side, crashing ashore in waves as high as . In the state capital of Montpelier, several large trees at the state house were uprooted. Within Montpelier and vicinity, farmers suffered some losses to apples and corn. Telephone and telegraph services were almost completely cut off. In Vergennes, a number of telephone wires snapped, while many apples, pears, and plums were blown off the trees. Additional damage to fruit and shade trees occurred in Middlebury and Winooski. The city of Burlington experienced its worst storm in many years. Winds downed all telephone and telegraph wires, whereas many trees had severe damage. Some homes were deroofed.

In New Hampshire, the storm left wind damage in the city of Nashua. Winds tore roofs off a number of buildings, with several roofs landing on the streets or telephone wires. Chimneys in each section of the city collapsed; many people narrowly escaped injury or death. In Nashua and the nearby cities of Brookline and Hollis, thousands of dollars in losses occurred to apple crops, described as &quot;practically ruined&quot;. The city of Manchester was affected by &quot;one of the most furious windstorms which visited this city in years&quot;. Telephone and telegraph communications were nearly completely out for several hours, while windows shattered and trees snapped. Street railway traffic experienced delays. In Maine, the storm downed trees and chimney and caused property damage in the vicinity of Biddeford.

===Canada===

From September 12–September 14, the extratropical remnants of the Galveston hurricane affected six Canadian provinces, resulting in severe damage and extensive loss of life. In Ontario, storm surge in Lake Ontario ranged from , wreaking havoc on vessels, beaching several boats, destroying a number of boats, and setting some others adrift. Many other vessels canceled or postponed their departures. Winds reached as high as in Toronto, breaking windows throughout the city. A fire broke out at a flour mill in Paris, and the flames were fanned by the storm, resulting in $350,000 in damage to the mill and 50 other stores and offices. High winds downed electrical, telegraph, and telephone lines in many areas. Total crop damage in Ontario alone amounted to $1 million. Impact to crops was particularly severe at St. Catharines, where many apple, peach, pear, and plum orchards were extensively damaged, with a loss of thousands of dollars. One person died in Niagara Falls, when a man attempted to remove debris from a pump station, but he was swept away into the river instead. Maximum rainfall in Canada reached 3.9 in (100 mm) in Percé, Quebec.

In Nova Scotia, damage was reported in the Halifax area. A plethora of fences and trees fell over, while windows shattered and a house under construction collapsed. Two schooners were driven ashore at Sydney and a brigantine was also beached at Cape Breton Island. Another schooner, known as &quot;Greta&quot;, capsized offshore Cape Breton Island near Low Point, with the fate of the crew being unknown. On Prince Edward Island, a few barns, a windmill, and a lobster factory were destroyed. Falling trees downed about 40 electrical wires. A house suffered damage after its own chimney fell and collapsed through the roof. Strong winds also tossed a boxcar from its track. A bridge and wharf at St. Peters Bay were damaged. Fruit crops were almost entirely ruined throughout Prince Edward Island. The majority of loss of life in Canada occurred due to numerous shipwrecks off the coasts of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island. The overall death toll in Canadian waters is estimated to be between 52 and 232, making this at least the eighth deadliest hurricane to affect Canada. The large discrepancy between the fatality figures is due to the fact that many people were reported missing. Thus, the exact number of deaths is unknown.

==Aftermath==

The city of Galveston was effectively obliterated. With the city in ruins and railroads to the mainland destroyed, the survivors had little to live on until relief arrived. On September 9, Galveston city officials established the Central Relief Committee for Galveston Storm Sufferers (CRC), chaired by Mayor Walter C. Jones. The CRC was composed of subcommittees for specific aspects of relief efforts, including burial of the deceased, correspondence, distribution of food and water, finances, hospitalization and rehabilitation for the injured, and public safety.

The dead bodies were so numerous that burying all of them was impossible. Initially, bodies were collected by &quot;dead gangs&quot; and then given to 50 African American men – who were forcibly recruited at gunpoint – to load them onto a barge. About 700 bodies were taken out to sea to be dumped. However, after gulf currents washed many of the bodies back onto the beach, a new solution was needed. Funeral pyres were set up on the beaches, or wherever dead bodies were found, and burned day and night for several weeks after the storm. The authorities passed out free whiskey to sustain the distraught men conscripted for the gruesome work of collecting and burning the dead.

With thousands dead and roughly 2,000 survivors leaving the city and never returning according to a Morrison and Fourmy Company survey, Galveston initially experienced a significant population decline. Between 1907 and 1914, Congregation B&#x27;nai Israel rabbi Henry Cohen and philanthropist Jacob Schiff spearheaded the Galveston Movement. Cohen, Schiff, and others created the movement to draw Jewish immigrants away from the crowded area along the East Coast and toward cities farther west, such as Galveston. Although approximately 10,000 Jewish immigrants arrived in Galveston during this period, few settled in the city or the island, but about one-fourth of them remained in Texas. The 1910 Census reported a population of 36,891 people in Galveston. Although a decline from the 1900 Census, the population loss of thousands of people was nearly reversed.

In the months prior to the hurricane, valet Charles F. Jones and lawyer Albert T. Patrick began conspiring to murder wealthy businessman William Marsh Rice in order to obtain his wealth. Patrick fabricated Rice&#x27;s legal will with the assistance of Jones. Rice&#x27;s properties in Galveston suffered extensive damage during the storm. After being informed of the damage, Rice decided to spend $250,000, the entire balance of his checking account, on repairing his properties. With the duo realizing that they would fail to obtain Rice&#x27;s wealth, Patrick convinced Jones to kill Rice with chloroform as he slept. Immediately after murdering Rice, Jones forged a large check to Patrick in Rice&#x27;s name. However, Jones misspelled Patrick&#x27;s name on the check, arousing suspicion and eventually resulting in their arrests and convictions. Rice&#x27;s estate was used to open an institute for higher learning in Houston in 1912, which was named Rice University in his honor.

===Rebuilding===

Survivors set up temporary shelters in surplus United States Army tents along the shore. They were so numerous that observers began referring to Galveston as the &quot;White City on the Beach&quot;. In the first two weeks following the storm, approximately 17,000 people resided in these tents, vacant storerooms, or public buildings. Others constructed so-called &quot;storm lumber&quot; homes, using salvageable material from the debris to build shelter. The building committee, with a budget of $450,000, opened applications for money to rebuild and repair homes. Accepted applicants were given enough money to build a cottage with three rooms. By March 1901, 1,073 cottages were built and 1,109 homes had been repaired.

Winifred Bonfils, a young journalist working for William Randolph Hearst, was the first reporter on the line at the hurricane&#x27;s ground zero in Galveston. She delivered an exclusive set of reports and Hearst sent relief supplies by train. By September 12, Galveston received its first post-storm mail. The next day, basic water service was restored, and Western Union began providing minimal telegraph service. Within three weeks of the storm, cotton was again being shipped out of the port.

A number of cities, businesses, organizations, and individuals made monetary donations toward rebuilding Galveston. By September 15, less than one week after the storm struck Galveston, contributions totaled about $1.5 million. More than $134,000 in donations poured in from New York City alone. Five other major cities – St. Louis, Chicago, Boston, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia – had also donated at least $15,000 by September 15. By state, the largest donations included $228,000 from New York, $67,000 from Texas, $56,000 from Illinois, $53,000 from Massachusetts, and $52,000 from Missouri. Contributions also came from abroad, such as from Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, England, and South Africa, including $10,000 each from Liverpool and Paris. Andrew Carnegie made the largest personal contribution, $10,000, while an additional $10,000 was donated by his steel company. 
Clara Barton, the founder and president of the American Red Cross and famous for her responses to crises in the latter half of the 19th century, responded to the disaster and visited Galveston with a team of eight Red Cross workers. This would be the last disaster that Barton responded to, as she was 78 years old at the time and would retire in 1904. After Barton and the team observed the catastrophe, the Red Cross set up a temporary headquarters at a four-story warehouse in the commercial district. Her presence in Galveston and appeals for contributions resulted in a substantial amount of donations. Overall, 258 barrels, 1,552 pillow cases, and 13 casks of bedding, clothing, crockery, disinfectants, groceries, hardware, medical supplies, and shoes were received at the warehouse, while $17,341 in cash was donated to the Red Cross. Contributions, both monetary gifts and supplies, were estimated to have reached about $120,000.

Before the hurricane of 1900, Galveston was considered to be a beautiful and prestigious city and was known as the &quot;Ellis Island of the West&quot; and the &quot;Wall Street of the Southwest&quot;. However, after the storm, development shifted north to Houston, which reaped the benefits of the oil boom, particularly after the discovery of oil at Spindletop on January 10, 1901. The dredging of the Houston Ship Channel began by 1909, which opened in 1914, ending Galveston&#x27;s hopes of regaining its former status as a major commercial center.

The Galveston city government was reorganized into a commission government in 1901, a newly devised structure wherein the government is made of a small group of commissioners, each responsible for one aspect of governance. This was prompted by fears that the existing city council would be unable to handle the problem of rebuilding the city. The apparent success of the new form of government inspired about 500 cities across the United States to adopt a commission government by 1920. However, the commission government fell out of favor after World War I, with Galveston itself switching to council–manager government in 1960.

===Protection===

To prevent future storms from causing destruction like that of the 1900 hurricane, many improvements to the island were made. The city of Galveston hired a team of three engineers to design structures for protection from future storms – Alfred Noble, Henry Martyn Robert, and H. C. Ripley. The three engineers recommended and designed a seawall. In November 1902, residents of Galveston overwhelmingly approved a bond referendum to fund building a seawall, passing the measure by a vote of 3,085–21. The first of the Galveston Seawall, high, were built beginning in 1902 under the direction of Robert. In July 1904, the first segment was completed, though construction of the seawall continued for several decades, with the final segment finished in 1963. Upon completion, the seawall in its entirety stretched for more than .

Another dramatic effort to protect Galveston was its raising, also recommended by Noble, Robert, and Ripley, and similar to the earlier raising of Chicago and Sacramento, California. Approximately of sand was dredged from the Galveston shipping channel to raise the city, some sections by as much as . Over 2,100 buildings were raised in the process of pumping sand underneath, including the 3,000-st (2,700-t) St. Patrick&#x27;s Church. According to historian David G. McComb, the grade of about 500 blocks had been raised by 1911. The seawall was listed among the National Register of Historic Places on August 18, 1977, while the seawall and raising of the island were jointly named a National Historical Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers on October 11, 2001.

In 1915, a storm similar in strength and track to the 1900 hurricane struck Galveston. The 1915 storm brought storm surge up to , testing the integrity of the new seawall. Although 53 people on Galveston Island lost their lives in the 1915 storm, this was a great reduction from the thousands who died in 1900. Other powerful tropical cyclones would test the effectiveness of the seawall, including Hurricane Carla in 1961, Hurricane Alicia in 1983, and Hurricane Ike in 2008. Carla primarily caused severe coastal flood-related damage to structures unprotected by the seawall. Following Hurricane Alicia, the Corps of Engineers estimated that the seawall prevented about $100 million in damage. Despite the seawall, Ike left extensive destruction in Galveston due to storm surge, with preliminary estimates indicating that up to $2 billion in damage occurred to beaches, dwellings, hospitals, infrastructure, and ports. Damage in Galveston and surrounding areas prompted proposals for improvements to the seawall, including the addition of floodgates and more seawalls.

===Open Era and beyond===

In historiography, the hurricane and the rebuilding afterward divide what is known as the &quot;Golden Era&quot; (1875–1900) from the &quot;Open Era&quot; (1920–1957) of Galveston. The most important long-term impact of the hurricane was to confirm fears that Galveston was a dangerous place to make major investments in shipping and manufacturing operations; the economy of the Golden Era was no longer possible as investors fled. However, the city experienced a significant economic rebound beginning in the 1920s, when Prohibition and lax law enforcement opened up new opportunities for criminal enterprises related to gambling and bootlegging in the city. Galveston rapidly became a prime resort destination enabled by the &quot;open&quot; vice businesses on the island. This new entertainment-based economy brought decades-long prosperity to the island.

To commemorate the hurricane&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 2000, the 1900 Storm Committee was established and began meeting in January 1998. The committee and then-Mayor of Galveston, Roger Quiroga, planned several public events in remembrance of the storm, including theatrical plays, an educational fundraising luncheon, a candlelight memorial service, a 5K run, the rededication of a commemorative Clara Barton plaque, and the dedication of the Place of Remembrance Monument. At the dedication of the Place of Remembrance Monument, the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word sang &quot;Queen of the Waves&quot; and placed 10 roses and 90 other flowers around the monument to commemorate the 10 nuns and 90 children who perished after the hurricane destroyed the St. Mary&#x27;s Orphans Asylum. Speakers at the candlelight memorial service included U. S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who was born in Galveston; Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration D. James Baker; and CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather, who gained fame for his coverage during Hurricane Carla in 1961. &quot;The Daily News&quot; published a special 100th anniversary commemorative edition newspaper on September 3, 2000.

The last reported survivor of the Galveston hurricane of 1900, Maude Conic of Wharton, Texas, died November 14, 2004, at the claimed age of 116, although the 1900 census and other records indicate she was about 10 years younger than that.

The Galveston Historical Foundation maintains the Texas Seaport Museum at Pier 21 in the port of Galveston. Included in the museum is a documentary titled &quot;The Great Storm&quot;, that gives a recounting of the 1900 hurricane.

<text>Timbales () or pailas are shallow single-headed drums with metal casing. They are shallower than single-headed tom-toms and usually tuned much higher, especially for their size. They were developed as an alternative to classical timpani in Cuba in the early 20th century and later spread across Latin America and the United States.

Timbales are struck with wooden sticks on the heads and shells, although bare hands are sometimes used. The player (called a &quot;timbalero&quot;) uses a variety of stick strokes, rim shots, and rolls to produce a wide range of percussive expression during solos and at transitional sections of music, and usually plays the shells (or auxiliary percussion such as a cowbell or cymbal) to keep time in other parts of the song. The shells and the typical pattern played on them are referred to as &quot;cáscara&quot;. Common stroke patterns include abanico, baqueteo (from danzón), mambo, and chachachá.

Timbales have average diameters of (&quot;macho&quot; drum) and (&quot;hembra&quot; drum). Originally made of calfskin, the heads are most commonly made of plastic for increased volume and durability and mounted on a steel rim. The shells are usually made of metal, although wooden shells are also available. In general, the drums are mounted on a stand and played while standing. Smaller timbales called timbalitos are often incorporated into larger drum kits.

== Etymology ==
In Spain and in classical music contexts across the Hispanophone world, the word &quot;timbales&quot; (sing. &quot;timbal&quot;) refers to timpani (kettledrums). The Spanish word &quot;tímpano&quot; is less commonly used. &quot;Timbal&quot;, &quot;tímpano&quot; and &quot;timpani&quot; all derive from the Latin &quot;tympănum&quot;, from the Greek &quot;týmpanon&quot;, meaning drum. (The Spanish word for drum, &quot;tambor&quot;, although similar, actually derives from Arabic &quot;tabl&quot;).

In Cuba and Latin America, &quot;timbales&quot; (timpani) were adapted into &quot;pailas&quot;, which is the name given to various Spanish metallic bowls and pans used as cookware (see paila). &quot;Paila&quot; derives from Old French &quot;paele&quot;, from Latin &quot;patĕlla&quot;. However, the term &quot;timbales&quot; continued to be used to refer to &quot;pailas&quot;, which is a less common term restricted to Cuba. Because of the historical overlap in the use of timpani and pailas (both called timbales) by danzón orchestras between 1900 and 1930, usage of the term in that period is ambiguous.

Similar ambiguities exist in other languages. For example, in French, &quot;timbales&quot; () is also the word for timpani, thus the French refer to Cuban timbales as &quot;timbales latines&quot;. In Brazil, the term &quot;timbal&quot; refers to an unrelated drum, timbau.

== History ==
===Origins and popularization===
Timpani were imported into Cuba in the 19th century and used by wind orchestras known as orquestas típicas. These were the same general type of drum used in military bands and in symphonic orchestras. They were, and are, played with mallets (sticks with large, soft, round heads). Timpani were replaced by pailas, which were made from the body of a commonly used metal pan (later, cans of lard were used to make &quot;timbalitos&quot;). These new &quot;timbales&quot; were originally designed to be used by street bands. Unlike classical timpani, these are always hit with straight batons (thicker than standard drumsticks, and not shaped: they are of uniform thickness along the length) that have no additional head.

Timbales became an integral part of a smaller type of orchestra that superseded the &quot;orquestas típicas&quot; in the early 20th century, the charanga. Ulpiano Díaz, timbalero in some of the most popular charangas in Cuba, those directed by Tata Alfonso, Antonio Arcaño and later José Fajardo, was the first to add a cowbell and to popularize the &quot;abanico&quot; technique in the 1930s. In the 1950s, timbalero Silvano &quot;Chori&quot; Shueg became a sensation in the nightclubs of Havana due to his skillful improvisations on timbales and other homemade percussion instruments, while Walfredo de los Reyes and Guillermo Barreto explored new idioms with the instrument in jam sessions known as descargas; they were influenced by American jazz drummers such as Max Roach and often doubled on the drum kit. Walfredo was an important influence on his student Amadito Valdés, later a member of Buena Vista Social Club, and his own sons Walfredo Reyes Jr. and Daniel de los Reyes. In the 1970s, innovations in timbales playing mostly came from songo groups such as Orquesta Revé, directed by timbalero Elio Revé, Orquesta Ritmo Oriental, featuring Daniel Díaz on timbales, and Los Van Van, whose timbaleros, first Blas Egües and later Changuito became masters of the instrument. In the 1990s, Changuito filmed a series of instructional videos on timbales, as well as congas and drums, which were released on VHS.

===In the United States===
Ubaldo Nieto, timbalero in Machito and his Afro-Cubans, was one of the first musicians to popularize the instrument in the United States. However, it was New York-born percussionist and bandleader Tito Puente who became the leading figure for the rest of the 20th century, often being referred to as the &quot;king of the timbales&quot;. He often acted as a bandleader in his studio recordings, leaving the timbales spot for up-and-coming artists such as Willie Bobo and Monchito, son of bandleader Rafael Muñoz. Several other Puerto Rican timbaleros also rose to prominence during the 1950s, like Willie Rodríguez, Humberto Morales and Rafael Cortijo. The former two often played in mambo and Latin jazz bands, while Cortijo established one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s most popular groups, Cortijo y su Combo. In the 1960s, the incipient New York salsa scene saw the emergence of Kako, Manny Oquendo, Jimmy Sabater, Orestes Vilató and Nicky Marrero. Timbales were also popular in boogaloo bands such as Pucho &amp; His Latin Soul Brothers, whose leader was timbalero Henry &quot;Pucho&quot; Brown. In the 1970s, timbales began to be used in other genres such as Latin rock and reggae. Mexican-American percussionist Pete Escovedo, his brother Coke and his daughter Sheila all became accomplished timbaleros in rock, jazz and funk. Later on, timbales were introduced in hip hop by percussionists such as Eric Bobo, the son of Willie Bobo.
==Technique==
===Baqueteo===
The basic timbales part for danzón is called the baqueteo. In the example below, the slashed noteheads indicate muted drum strokes, and the regular noteheads indicate open strokes. The danzón was the first written music to be based on the organizing principle of sub-Saharan African rhythm, known in Cuba as &quot;clave&quot;.

During the mambo era of the 1940s, timbaleros began to mount cowbells on their drums. The cowbells, or wood blocks, may be mounted slightly above and between the two timbales a little further from the player. The following four timbale bell patterns are based on the folkloric rumba cáscara part. They are written in 3-2 clave sequence.

In the 1970s José Luis Quintana &quot;Changuito&quot; developed the technique of simultaneously playing timbale and bongo bell parts when he held the timbales chair in the songo band Los Van Van. The example below shows the combined bell patterns (written in a 2–3 clave sequence).

Tito Puente was frequently seen in concerts, and on posters and album covers, with seven or eight timbales in one set. The timbales were occasionally expanded with drum kit pieces, such as a kick or snare drum. By the late 1970s this became the norm in the genre known as songo. Changuito and others brought rumba and funk influences into timbales playing. In contemporary timba bands, drummers, such as Calixto Oviedo, often use a timbales/drum kit hybrid.

===Solos===
====Típico style====
The original style of soloing on timbales is known as típico (&#x27;typical&#x27;). Manny Oquendo (1931–2009) played timbales solos famous for their tastefully sparse, straight forward típico phrasing. The following five measure excerpt is from a timbales solo by Oquendo on &quot;Mambo.&quot; The clave pattern is written above for reference. Notice how the passage begins and ends by coinciding with the strokes of clave.

====Rumba quinto rhythmic vocabulary====
By the late 1940s and early 1950s, some timbaleros (&#x27;timbales players&#x27;), particularly Tito Puente, began incorporating the rhythmic vocabulary of rumba quinto into their solos.

==Derivative instruments==
===Timbalitos===
Timbalitos or pailitas are small timbales with diameters of , or . The timbalitos are used to play the part of the bongos with sticks, but are not used to play the traditional timbales part. Manteca, Papaíto, Félix Escobar &quot;El Gallego&quot; and Manny Oquendo were masters at playing the bongó part on timbalitos. Timbalitos are sometimes incorporated into expanded timbales set-ups, or incorporated into drum kits. The instrument was invented in Cuba in the mid 1920&#x27;s as a substitute for the bongó which at the time was outlawed in La Habana by the then President of Cuba, Gerardo Machado. The groups at this time that predominantly used it were La Gloria Mantancera and La Sonora Mantancera.

===Mini timbales===
Mini timbales small timbales, similar to timbalitos, often used by rock drummers as part of their drum kits. For examples, drummer John Dolmayan of System of a Down is known for using two (6&quot; and 8&quot;) mini timbales in his kit and Dave Mackintosh uses a pair of 8&quot; diameter attack timbales 9&quot; and 11&quot; deep made by Meinl Percussion to produce a similar sound to a pair of octobans. Meinl also produce a set of mini timbales of traditional depth but 8&quot; and 10&quot; diameter, also suitable for drum kit usage.

===Marching Timbales===
The Ohio University Marching 110 is the only collegiate marching band in the United States to march timbales in their percussion section. Timbales were added to the band in 1971, accompanying five snare drums, two bass drums, two tenor bass drums, and two sets of cymbals. The band does not use a normal set of multi tenor drums that most marching bands do, and instead use a combination of timbales and duo-tenor drums to fulfill the mid-ranges of the percussion section&#x27;s sound. Together, the section is known as the &quot;Middle Voices&quot; or &quot;Middles&quot;.

<doc id="322247" wikidata="Q469027" url="?curid=322247" title="Issey Miyake">
<text>was a Japanese-French fashion designer. He was known for his technology-driven clothing designs, exhibitions and fragrances, such as &quot;L&#x27;eau d&#x27;Issey&quot;, which became his best-known product.

==Early life and education==
Miyake was born on 22 April 1938 in Hiroshima. He was still living in the city seven years later when the U.S. military dropped an atomic bomb there in August 1945. He first disclosed this in 2009, when Barack Obama advocated for global nuclear disarmament. 

As a child, Miyake wanted to become a dancer. His interest in fashion started by studying his sister&#x27;s fashion magazines. He studied graphic design at the Tama Art University in Tokyo, graduating in 1964. He entered designs into fashion competition at the Bunka Fashion College in Tokyo. However, he did not win a competition due to his lack of pattern-making or sewing skills. After graduation, he enrolled in the &quot;Chambre syndicale de la couture parisienne&quot; school in Paris and was apprenticed to Guy Laroche as assistant designer. He also worked with Hubert de Givenchy, drawing 50 to 100 sketches daily.

==Career==
In 1969, Miyake moved to New York City, where he met artists like Christo and Robert Rauschenberg. He was enrolled in English classes at Columbia University and worked on Seventh Avenue for designer Geoffrey Beene. Returning to Tokyo in 1970, he founded the Miyake Design Studio, a high-end producer of women&#x27;s fashion.

From a young age, Miyake respected artist Isamu Noguchi, whose novelty and sense of fun in his designs inspired Miyake. He was also inspired by fashion designer Madeleine Vionnet&#x27;s use of geometric calculations and &quot;a single piece of beautiful cloth&quot;. In Paris, he visited several museums and he mentioned that he was influenced by sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși and Alberto Giacometti.

In the late 1980s, Miyake began to experiment with new methods of pleating that would allow both flexibility of movement for the wearer as well as ease of care and production. The garments are cut and sewn first, then sandwiched between layers of paper and fed into a heat press, where they are pleated. The fabric&#x27;s &#x27;memory&#x27; holds the pleats and when the garments are liberated from their paper cocoon, they are ready-to wear. 

Miyake had a long friendship with Austrian-born pottery artist Dame Lucie Rie. She presented him with her archival ceramic buttons, which he integrated into his designs.

He also developed a friendship with Apple&#x27;s Steve Jobs, who came to him after seeing the uniforms Miyake designed for employees of Sony&#x27;s factories. At Jobs&#x27;s request, Miyake designed similar vests for Apple employees, but Jobs encountered strong opposition to the idea of a uniform. Nonetheless, Miyake went on to produce the black turtlenecks which would become a part of Jobs&#x27; signature attire. Jobs said, &quot;So I asked Issey to make me some of his black turtlenecks that I liked, and he made me like a hundred of them.&quot;

Legendary designer Geoffrey Beene stated that he admired Issey Miyake for Miyake&#x27;s technique, this in an interview with poet/artist Steven Vita in &quot;Veery&quot; journal, 1991.

In March 1992, Miyake was quoted in the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; as saying &quot;Design is not for philosophy—it&#x27;s for life.&quot;

Between 1996 and 1999, Miyake collaborated with artists for his Guest Artist series. The first collaboration was with the photographer and collage maker Yasumasa Morimura; the other artists were Nobuyoshi Araki, Tim Hawkinson, and Cai Guo-Qiang. Miyake stated that his intention was not to answer the question &quot;Is fashion art?&quot; but instead to create an &quot;interactive relationship&quot; between the art and the people who admired it. By wearing the artworks upon their bodies, the wearers interacted with fashion and art simultaneously.

Miyake was also one of the co-Directors of 21 21 DESIGN SIGHT, Japan&#x27;s first design museum.

Miyake died of liver cancer on 5 August 2022, at the age of 84.
==&quot;Issey Miyake&quot;==
===Main line===
&quot;Issey Miyake&quot; is the main collection line, subdivided into &quot;men&quot; (since 1978/85) and &quot;women&quot; (since 1971) collections.

The first Issey Miyake collection, for fall 1971, featured a dress with a Japanese-style tattoo print of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix created by Makiko Minagawa, an artist who joined the studio staff. 

Shortly after, Miyake did the costume for Ballett Frankfurt with an ultra feather-polyester jersey permanently pleated in a piece named &quot;the Loss of Small Detail&quot; William Forsythe and also work on ballet &quot;Garden in the setting&quot;. He realized that the new method of making clothes fit well in dancers. After studying how dancers move, he sent 200 to 300 garments for dancers to wear a different one in each performance of &quot;The Last Detail&quot;. This led to the development of the &quot;Pleats, Please&quot; range and inspired him to use dancers to display his work. 

Released in 1993, Miyake&#x27;s Pleats Please line of clothing, made from a near weightless polyester, featured waterfalls of razor-sharp, accordionlike pleats offering the ease of loungewear. They became his most recognizable look, with &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; fashion editor Sylvia Rubin crediting Miyake together with Babette Pinsky with &quot;reinventing&quot; the Mariano Fortuny pleat.

In 1994 and 1999, Miyake turned over the design of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s collections respectively, to his associate, Naoki Takizawa, so that he could return to research full-time. In 2007, Naoki Takizawa opened his own brand supported by the Issey Miyake Group and was replaced as Creative Director by Dai Fujiwara, who ran the House of Issey Miyake until 2012. The design duties were split as of the Spring/Summer 2012 collections, with Yoshiyuki Miyamae appointed head designer of the women&#x27;s collection and Yusuke Takahashi designing the men&#x27;s line.

===Other lines and brands===
Miyake &quot;oversaw the overall direction of all lines created by his company&quot;, even though the individual collections have been designed by his staff since his &#x27;retirement&#x27; from the fashion world in 1997.
*Issey Miyake Fête – colorful women&#x27;s line that &quot;draws on the technological innovations of Pleats Please&quot; (Fête means &#x27;celebration&#x27; in French) (since 2004)
*Pleats Please Issey Miyake – polyester jersey garments for women that are first &quot;cut and sewn and then pleated [...] (normally, fabric is first pleated and then cut and sewn [...])&quot; &quot;to permanently retain washboard rows of horizontal, vertical or diagonal knife-edge pleats&quot;. Miyake patented the technique in 1993
*HaaT – women&#x27;s line, designed by Miyake&#x27;s former textile designer, Makiko Minagawa. HaaT means &#x27;village market&#x27; in Sanskrit, and the word sounds similar to &#x27;heart&#x27; in English
*A-POC – 1998– custom-collection for men and women. Tubes of fabric are machine-processed and can be cut into various shapes by the consumer. A-POC is an acronym of &#x27;a piece of cloth&#x27;, and a near homophone of &#x27;epoch&#x27;.
*132 5. Issey Miyake – an evolution of the A-POC concept. Works are presented as two-dimensional geometric shapes made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate mixed with natural fibers and dyes, which then unfold into structured garments. (since 2014)
*APOC Able – a further evolution of the A-POC concept centered around advanced and innovative weaving technologies (since 2020) 
*me Issey Miyake – line of &quot;exclusive one-sized shirts that stretch to fit the wearer&quot; that are sold in a plastic tube, named Cauliflower for the non-Asian market. (since 2001)
*Homme Plisse – men&#x27;s clothing in the signature Issey Miyake pleating (since 2013)
*IM Men – men&#x27;s line for casual wear (since 2020); the brand&#x27;s logo, developed by graphic designer Taku Satoh, consists of an IM motif that was originally designed by Ikko Tanaka in 1979 and was previously used for non-clothing products
*Bao Bao Issey Miyake – line of bags
*Issey Miyake Watches – men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s watches
*Issey Miyake Perfumes – line of fragrances for men and women. See below

*Issey Skyline – produced in limited quantities to promote the release of the Nissan Skyline in 1982.

===Perfumes===
Like many fashion designers, Issey Miyake also had a line of perfumes. His first fragrance, L&#x27;eau d&#x27;Issey, was created by perfumer Jacques Cavallier.

The scent was followed by L&#x27;eau d&#x27;Issey Pour Homme (for men) in 1994. L&#x27;eau Bleue d&#x27;Issey Pour Homme was introduced in 2004; and its evolution, L&#x27;eau Bleue d&#x27;Issey Eau Fraiche was introduced in 2006. Every year from 2007 on, Issey Miyake brought out a &quot;limited time only&quot; fragrance for ladies, for which he brought in a &quot;guest&quot; perfumer. In 2007, he launched &#x27;Drop on a Petal&#x27;, and in 2008 he launched &#x27;Reflections in a Drop&#x27;. A new Issey Miyake men&#x27;s fragrance, L&#x27;eau d&#x27;Issey Pour Homme Intense, was introduced at Nordstrom in the United States in June 2007, with a larger worldwide rollout following in September 2007. Issey Miyake fragrances are produced under a long-term agreement by the Beauté Prestige International division of Shiseido.

===Other activities===
In 1992, Issey Miyake designed the Lithuanian national team&#x27;s official uniform for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

Working with Ron Arad, Miyake created A-POC Trampoline, which was a knit jacket, pants and stole.

==Miyake Issey Foundation==
The Miyake Issey Foundation, founded in Tokyo in 2004, operates the &quot;21_21 Design Sight&quot; center, organizes exhibitions and events, and publishes literature.

21 21 Design Sight (a play on 20/20 vision) is a museum-style research center for design, constructed by Tadao Ando, that was opened in Roppongi, Tokyo in March 2007. The center was headed by Issey Miyake (until his death in 2022) and four other Japanese designers, and operated by &quot;The Miyake Issey Foundation&quot;.

==Recognition==
===Exhibitions===
Many of Miyake&#x27;s designs are in museums, including the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection. From March 2016, the largest retrospective of his work was organized at The National Art Center, Tokyo, celebrating 45 years of career.

<doc id="322252" wikidata="Q132429" url="?curid=322252" title="Clusiaceae">
<text>The Clusiaceae or Guttiferae (&quot;nom. alt. et cons.&quot; = alternative and valid name) are a family of plants including 13 genera and ca 750 species. Several former members of Clusiacae are now placed in Calophyllaceae and Hypericaceae. They are mostly trees and shrubs, with milky sap and fruits or capsules for seeds. The family is primarily tropical. More so than many plant families, it shows large variation in plant morphology (for example, three to 10, fused or unfused petals, and many other traits). According to the APG III, this family belongs to the order Malpighiales.

One feature which is sometimes found in this family, and rarely in others (e.g., Malpighiaceae), is providing pollinators with &quot;pollination rewards&quot; other than pollen or nectar; specifically, some species offer resin, which certain bees use in nest construction (each Clusiaceae species offers only one type of reward).

==Taxonomic history ==
The family Clusiaceae was divided by Cronquist into two subfamilies: the Clusioideae (typical subfamily) and the Hypericoideae. The latter was often treated as a family—the Hypericaceae or St. John&#x27;s wort family. Elements of the Hypericoideae are more common in northern temperate areas and those of the Clusioideae are centered in the tropics.

Later classifications, however, divide the family in a finer way. Molecular studies have shown that the family Podostemaceae—the riverweeds—as well as the Bonnetiaceae are nested in this group. Their inclusions make the Clusiaceae in a wide sense polyphyletic, and Stevens&#x27;s subfamilies need to be recognised at family level: Clusioideae as Clusiaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;; Hypericoideae as Hypericaceae; and Kielmeyeroideae as Calophyllaceae.

<text>Dunbartonshire () or the County of Dumbarton is a historic county, lieutenancy area and registration county in the west central Lowlands of Scotland lying to the north of the River Clyde. Dunbartonshire borders Perthshire to the north, Stirlingshire to the east, Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire to the south, and Argyllshire to the west.

The county covered a similar area to the earldom and later duchy of Lennox. The historic county gives its name to two of Scotland&#x27;s modern council areas, being East Dunbartonshire and West Dunbartonshire.

==Name==

The town name &quot;Dumbarton&quot; comes from the Scottish Gaelic meaning &quot;fort of the Britons&quot;. Historically, the spelling of the county town and the county were not standardised. By the 18th century the names &quot;County of Dunbarton&quot; and &quot;County of Dumbarton&quot; were used interchangeably. The n in &quot;Dunbarton&quot; represents the etymology &quot;fort&quot;; the &quot;m&quot; in &quot;Dumbarton&quot; reflects a pronunciation with assimilation of to the labial , due to the influence of the neighbouring labial sound.

Different county bodies used the two spellings: the Dunbarton County Constabulary were formed in 1857 by the Commissioners of Supply for the County of Dunbarton.

In 1890 elected county councils were established under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, which referred to the area as the &quot;County of Dumbarton&quot;. However, one of the county council&#x27;s first acts was to adopt an official seal, for which it chose to use the spelling &quot;Dunbarton&quot;, with an &quot;n&quot;, as being closer to the name&#x27;s etymology, despite protests from some residents who maintained that the spelling with an &quot;m&quot; was better established in general usage. The town of Dumbarton continued to use the spelling with an &quot;m&quot;. Statutory recognition of the spelling with an &quot;n&quot; being used for the county came with the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 6. c. 43).

==History==
Dunbartonshire&#x27;s origins as a shire (the area administered by a sheriff) are obscure, but it had become a shire by the end of the twelfth century. The shire of Dumbarton was initially similar in area to the earldom of Lennox, covering an area north of the River Clyde and around Loch Lomond. In the thirteenth century an area north-east of Loch Lomond was transferred to Stirlingshire, whilst the two parishes of Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld were transferred from Stirlingshire to Dunbartonshire, despite not adjoining the rest of the county. The changes were reversed in 1504, when Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld were restored to Stirlingshire and the area north-east of Loch Lomond came back to Dunbartonshire, but the change was short-lived, being reverted again in 1509.
Commissioners of Supply were established in 1667 to act as the main administrative body for the shire outside the burghs. Elected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners (which were eventually abolished in 1930). The burgh of Dumbarton was deemed capable of managing its own affairs and so was excluded from the administrative area of the county council, although the county council still chose to base itself in that town. The county council held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at the County Buildings (which also served as the sheriff court) on Church Street in Dumbarton. The 1889 act also led to a review of boundaries; in the case of Dunbartonshire the parish of New Kilpatrick had previously straddled Dunbartonshire and Stirlingshire, with the town of Milngavie being in the part of the parish in Stirlingshire. The parish was brought entirely within Dunbartonshire on 15 May 1891.
Reforms to local government in 1930 saw the burgh of Dumbarton brought within the administrative area of the county council. The county council was based at the old county buildings at the sheriff court until 1965, when it moved to new County Buildings on Garshake Road in Dumbarton. The new building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, on 28 June 1965 during a royal visit to the area.

Dunbartonshire was abolished for local government purposes in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, becoming part of the large Strathclyde Region. Strathclyde was divided into nineteen districts, with Dunbartonshire being divided between Dumbarton, Bearsden and Milngavie, Clydebank, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth and Strathkelvin Districts. The combined area of these five districts continued to be used as a lieutenancy area.

Local government in Scotland was reorganised again in 1996, with the regions and districts abolished and replaced with unitary council areas. Two of the new council areas include Dunbartonshire in their name. Since 1996 the area of the pre-1975 county of Dunbartonshire has been split between four council areas:
*East Dunbartonshire Council, with its administrative headquarters at Kirkintilloch (also includes parts of the pre-1975 counties of Stirlingshire and Lanarkshire).
*West Dunbartonshire Council, with its administrative centre at Dumbarton.
*Argyll and Bute Council (which took over the Helensburgh and Lomond part of Dumbarton District).
*North Lanarkshire (for the Cumbernauld area).

The Dunbartonshire lieutenancy area continues to be defined in terms of the five districts that existed between 1975 and 1996, with the only change made to the lieutenancy areas at the time of the 1996 local government reorganisation being that the Chryston area of Strathkelvin district was transferred to the Lanarkshire lieutenancy. The historic boundaries of Dunbartonshire are still used for land registration purposes, being a registration county.

==Geography==

The northern half of the county is sparsely populated and dominated by Loch Lomond (now part of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park), which it shares with Stirlingshire. There are many islands in the loch which form part of the county, the most notable being Island I Vow, Tarbet Isle, Inchlonaig, Inchconnachan, Inchmoan, Inchtavannach, Fraoch Eilean, Inchgalbraith, Torrinch, Creinch, Inchmurrin and Aber Isle. The much smaller Geal Loch, Lochan Beinn Damhain, Lochan Strath Dubh-uisge, and Loch Sloy can also be found here. The area is also home to Ben Vorlich, the highest point of Dunbartonshire at 943 m (3,094 ft) and the 229th tallest mountain in Scotland.
South-western Dunbartonshire has a long coastline along Loch Long, culminating in the Rosneath peninsula which is separated from the main body of the county by Gare Loch. Both of these lead into the Firth of Clyde which forms the southern border. The area east of the river Leven is dominated geographically by the Kilpatrick Hills which also contains a number of small lochs and reservoirs. In the far south-east the county encompasses a portion of the Greater Glasgow conurbation.

The Cumbernauld exclave is largely flat and heavily urbanised.

===Boundaries and the Cumbernauld exclave===
The county retained a large exclave situated east of the main part of the county despite the boundary changes in the 1890s elsewhere in Scotland, consisting of the civil parishes of Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld, between Stirlingshire and Lanarkshire. This area had originally been part of Stirlingshire, but had been annexed to Dunbarton in the reign of David II at the request of Malcolm Fleming, Earl of Wigtown, the owner of the land, who was also Sheriff of Dumbarton.

The exclave was dealt with in 19th century legislation as greater administrative duties were given to the counties.

The Police (Scotland) Act 1857 established police forces throughout Scotland. Section 70 of the act allowed for the parishes to be transferred to the jurisdiction of either Stirlingshire or Lanarkshire Constabulary on resolution of two-thirds of the Commissioners of Supply for the County of Dumbarton.

Similar provisions allowing for the transfer of the area for all purposes were included in the County General Assessment (Scotland) Act 1868. No such resolution was made, and the two parishes remained in Dunbartonshire.

Section 40 of the Roads and Bridges (Scotland) Act 1878 (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. 51) provided that for the purposes of that act all detached parts of counties should be placed in the county by which they were surrounded, or with which they had the longest boundary. Accordingly, Cumbernauld and Kirkintilloch came under the control of the Stirlingshire Road Board. It was originally anticipated that the area would be transferred to Stirlingshire for all other purposes by the boundary commissioners proposed by the Local Government Bill of 1889. However, a clause was inserted in the bill that stated &quot;the parishes of Cumbernauld and Kirkintilloch, including the burghs and police burghs situate therein, shall for the purposes of this Act, be considered as forming part of the county of Dumbarton&quot;. The clause was vigorously opposed by the Stirlingshire Commissioners of Supply as they had incurred considerable expense in maintaining the roads of the two parishes. The Act as passed provided that the Dunbartonshire County Council was to financially compensate Stirlingshire on the transfer of road powers.

==Transport==

The West Highland Line runs through the county connecting Glasgow to Oban and Fort William and is popular with tourist due to its scenic view of the Highlands. The North Clyde line serves the towns of the Vale of Leven, and many suburban and commuter lines serve those parts of Dunbartonshire that form part of the Glasgow conurbation. Two lines run west–east through the Cumbernauld exclave, linking this area to Glasgow and Falkirk.

Various ferries criss-cross Loch Lomond, linking some of the towns along its banks. The Rosneath peninsula is connected by a ferry from Kilcreggan to Gourock in Renfrewshire.

<doc id="322258" wikidata="Q701346" url="?curid=322258" title="Wiman of Gojoseon">
<text>Wi Man (in Korean) or Wei Man (in Chinese) was a Chinese military general and monarch. He was originally a military leader of the Chinese Kingdom of Yan. When king Lu Wan of Yan was defeated by the Han in 195 BCE, Wi Man fled to Gojoseon in north-western Korea and later usurped power from its king in 194 BCE, establishing Wiman Joseon. Recorded in the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; and the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, Wiman was the first ruler in the history of Korea to have been recorded in documents from the same time period.

== Biography ==
After Emperor Gaozu of Han suppressed the rebellion of Zang Tu, king of Yan, he appointed general Lu Wan as Yan&#x27;s new king. In 196 BC, Emperor Gaozu suspected Lu Wan of plotting rebellion and ordered an attack against Yan. Lu Wan fled to the Xiongnu while his general Wiman (Wei Man) led a thousand followers east to Gojoseon. He was initially ordered to fortify Gojoseon&#x27;s northwestern border by King Jun of Gojoseon, however with the help of Yan refugees, Wiman usurped the throne (194~180 BCE). King Jun fled to Jin and called himself the &quot;King of Han.&quot;

Wiman&#x27;s capital of Gojoseon was Wanggeom-seong, generally identified as Pyongyang. Since the Han dynasty was not completely stabilized yet, the governor of Liaodong appointed Wiman as an outer subject, provided that he did not prevent natives going up to the empire. The appointment is dated at 191 or 192 BCE. Having superior military strength, Wiman Joseon was able to subjugate the state of Jinbeon () and Imdun (), vastly extending its borders. His kingdom was eventually conquered by Emperor Wu of Han in 108 BCE during the reign of Ugeo of Gojoseon.

== Family ==
*Son and successor: name not recorded, second king of Wiman Joseon
**Grandson: Ugeo (右渠), last king of Wiman Joseon
***Great-grandson: Wi Jang (衛長),

<text>Ira Remsen (February 10, 1846 – March 4, 1927) was an American chemist who introduced organic chemistry research and education in the United States along the lines of German universities where he received his early training. He was the first professor of chemistry and the second president of Johns Hopkins University. He founded the &quot;American Chemical Journal&quot;, which he edited from 1879 to 1914. The discovery of saccharin was made in his laboratory by Constantine Fahlberg who worked in collaboration with Remsen but patented the synthesis on his own, earning the ire of Remsen.

== Early life==

Ira Remsen was born in New York City on February 10, 1846. He was the son of James Vanderbelt Remsen (1818–1892) and Rosanna née Secor (1823–1856) who came from family of Dutch settlers. His mother had Huguenot ancestors. He went to the New York Free Academy where he studied Greek, Latin, maths and sciences. He also attended popular lectures by Robert Ogden Doremus at the Cooper Institute. He did not complete his bachelor&#x27;s degree but apprenticed for a while under a homeopathic physician who was on the faculty of New York Homeooathic Medical School. He dropped out of this as well and joined the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University receiving an MD in 1867 with a thesis on fatty degeneration of the liver. He then practiced at Irving Place, New York and a year later sought to study chemistry in Germany. He went to the University of Munich where he worked under Jacob Volhard (1834–1910) as well as one series of lectures under Justus von Liebig (1803–1873) who was the main attraction for Remsen to move to Germany. He then went to the University of Göttingen, on the recommendation of Friedrich Wöhler, and studied organic chemistry under Rudolph Fittig (1835–1910). His 1870 doctorate was on investigations on piperic acid and its derivatives. He worked as an assistant to Fittig from 1870 to 1872 and during this time he met William Ramsay (1852–1916).

He married Elisabeth Hilleard Mallory on April 3, 1875, in New York City, New York. They had two children together. Their son, Ira Mallory Remsen (1876–1928), became an artist and playwright living in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.

== Career==
In 1872, after researching pure chemistry at University of Tübingen, Remsen returned to the United States and became a professor at Williams College, where he wrote the popular text &quot;Theoretical Chemistry&quot;. Remsen&#x27;s book and reputation brought him to the attention of Daniel Coit Gilman, who invited him to become one of the original faculty of Johns Hopkins University. Remsen accepted and founded the department of chemistry there, overseeing his own laboratory. In 1879, Remsen founded the &quot;American Chemical Journal&quot;, which he edited for 35 years. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1879.

In 1879 Constantine Fahlberg, working with Remsen in a post-doctoral capacity, made an accidental discovery that changed Remsen&#x27;s career. Eating rolls at dinner after a long day in the lab researching coal tar derivatives, Fahlberg noticed that the rolls tasted initially sweet but then bitter. Since his wife tasted nothing strange about the rolls, Fahlberg tasted his fingers and noticed that the bitter taste was probably from one of the chemicals in his lab. The next day at his lab he tasted the chemicals that he had been working with the previous day and discovered that it was the oxidation of o-toluenesulfonamide he had tasted the previous evening. He named the substance saccharin and he and his research partner Remsen published their finding in 1880. Later Remsen became angry after Fahlberg, in patenting saccharin (along with his uncle Adolph Moritz List), claimed that he alone had discovered saccharin. Remsen had no interest in the commercial success of saccharin, from which Fahlberg profited, but he was incensed at the perceived dishonesty of not crediting him as the head of the laboratory. Fahlberg would soon grow wealthy, while Remsen merely grew irritated, believing he deserved credit for substances produced in his laboratory. In a letter to Scottish chemist William Ramsay, Remsen commented, &quot;Fahlberg is a scoundrel. It nauseates me to hear my name mentioned in the same breath with him.&quot; The controversy would enter court when Constantine Fahlberg, Adolph List, George Merck and Theodore Weicker went to court to sue A. Klipstein &amp; Company of New York for patent violation. Klipstein used the claim that Remsen and Fahlberg were involved in the discovery and that Fahlberg had falsely claimed himself as the inventor. Remsen&#x27;s testimony was also included in the case but the documents are lost. The suit was ultimately dropped. When the American Chemical Society gave him the Priestley medal in 1923 the citation would mention that Remsen served the science of chemistry and sought no commercial gains from his work.

Throughout his academic career, Remsen was known as an excellent teacher, rigorous in his expectations but patient with the beginner. &quot;His lectures to beginners were models of didactic exposition, and many of his graduate students owe much of their later success in their own lecture rooms to the pedagogical training received from attendance upon Remsen&#x27;s lectures to freshmen.&quot; Remsen made his teaching laboratory centric. He founded the &quot;American Chemical Journal&quot; that he edited out of Baltimore and competed with the &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot; run by the American Chemical Society. The latter journal did not publish much in organic chemistry. Remsen had joined the ACS in 1878 but he let his membership expire. When he rejoined he was elected president in 1902. In 1913 he allowed his journal to be merged into the ACS journal.

In 1901 Remsen was appointed the president of Johns Hopkins, where he proceeded to found a School of Engineering and helped establish the school as a research university. He introduced many of the German laboratory techniques he had learned and wrote several important chemistry textbooks. In 1912 he stepped down as president, due to ill health, and retired to Carmel, California. While serving as a president of Johns Hopkins, he also took part in civil projects. He served on the Baltimore School Commission in efforts to improve the infrastructure of secondary education. In 1906 he was also involved in improvements to the Baltimore sewerage system. He also served on the Maryland Good Roads Commission. In 1909 he was posted as chairman of a board that dealt with food purity under the department of agriculture. The board came to be popularly called the &quot;Remsen Board&quot;. There was considerable pressure from manufacturers to vilify the members of the board who were criticized in the press. A cartoon from this period depicted him sitting on a board with nails.

==Death==
He died on March 4, 1927, in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. His ashes are interred behind a plaque in the chemistry building on the Homewood campus at Johns Hopkins University.

== Legacy ==
In the 37 years of his service he guided 107 PhD students. In 1925 eighty-four of his students held positions as professors and forty were heads of chemistry departments in the US. After his death, the new chemistry building, completed in 1924, was named after him at Johns Hopkins. His ashes are located behind a plaque in Remsen Hall; he is the only person buried on campus.

His Baltimore house was added to the National Register of Historic Places and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975.

Remsen Hall in Queens College is also named for him.

== Remsen Award ==
In 1946, to commemorate the centenary of Remsen, the Maryland chapter of the American Chemical Society, began awarding the Remsen award, in his honor. Awardees are frequently of the highest caliber, and included a sequence of 16 Nobel laureates between 1950 and 1980.

<doc id="322269" wikidata="Q55998" url="?curid=322269" title="Pleurisy">
<text>Pleurisy, also known as pleuritis, is inflammation of the membranes that surround the lungs and line the chest cavity (pleurae). This can result in a sharp chest pain while breathing. Occasionally the pain may be a constant dull ache. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, cough, fever, or weight loss, depending on the underlying cause.
Pleurisy can be caused by a variety of conditions, including viral or bacterial infections, autoimmune disorders, and pulmonary embolism. The most common cause is a viral infection. Other causes include 
bacterial infection, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, autoimmune disorders, lung cancer, following heart surgery, pancreatitis and asbestosis. Occasionally the cause remains unknown. The underlying mechanism involves the rubbing together of the pleurae instead of smooth gliding. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include pericarditis, heart attack, cholecystitis, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax. Diagnostic testing may include a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood tests.
Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen may be used to decrease pain. Incentive spirometry may be recommended to encourage larger breaths. About one million people are affected in the United States each year. Descriptions of the condition date from at least as early as 400 BC by Hippocrates.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The defining symptom of pleurisy is a sudden sharp, stabbing, burning or dull pain in the right or left side of the chest during breathing, especially when one inhales and exhales. It feels worse with deep breathing, coughing, sneezing, or laughing. The pain may stay in one place, or it may spread to the shoulder or back. Sometimes, it becomes a fairly constant dull ache.

Depending on its cause, pleuritic chest pain may be accompanied by other symptoms:

* Dry cough
* Fever and chills
* Rapid, shallow breathing
* Shortness of breath
* Fast heart rate
* Sore throat followed by pain and swelling in the joints

=== Related problems ===
Pleurisy is often associated with complications that affect the pleural space.

==== Pleural effusion ====
In some cases of pleurisy, excess fluid builds up in the pleural space. This is called a pleural effusion. The buildup of excess fluid, will more often than not force the two layers of the pleura apart so they do not rub against each other when breathing. This can relieve the pain of pleurisy. A large amount of fluid can result in collapse of the lung. This can make it difficult to breathe.

In some cases of pleural effusion, the excess fluid becomes infected and turns into an abscess. This is called an empyema.

Pleural effusion involving fibrinous exudates in the fluid may be called fibrinous pleurisy, which sometimes occurs as a later stage of pleurisy.

A person can develop a pleural effusion in the absence of pleurisy. For example, pneumonia, heart failure, cancer, or a pulmonary embolism can lead to a pleural effusion.

==== Pneumothorax ====
Air or gas also can build up in the pleural space. This is called a pneumothorax. It can result from acute lung injury or a lung disease like emphysema. Lung procedures, like surgery, drainage of fluid with a needle, examination of the lung from the inside with a light and a camera, or mechanical ventilation, also can cause a pneumothorax.

The most common symptom is sudden pain in one side of the lung and shortness of breath. A pneumothorax also can put pressure on the lung and cause it to collapse.

If the pneumothorax is small, it may go away on its own. If large, a chest tube is placed through the skin and chest wall into the pleural space to remove the air.

==== Hemothorax ====
Blood also can collect in the pleural space. This is called hemothorax. The most common cause is injury to the chest from blunt force or surgery on the heart or chest. Hemothorax also can occur in people with lung or pleural cancer.

Hemothorax can put pressure on the lung and force it to collapse. It also can cause shock, a state of hypoperfusion in which an insufficient amount of blood is able to reach the organs.

== Causes ==

The pleural space can be invaded by fluid, air, and particles from other parts of the body, which fairly complicates diagnosis. Viral infection (coxsackie B virus, HRSV, CMV, adenovirus, EBV, parainfluenza, influenza, COVID-19) is the most common cause of pleurisy. However, many other different conditions can cause pleuritic chest pain:
* Aortic dissections
* Autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (or drug-induced lupus erythematosus), Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), rheumatoid arthritis and Behçet&#x27;s disease.
* Bacterial infections associated with pneumonia and tuberculosis
* Chest injuries (blunt or penetrating)
* Familial Mediterranean fever, an inherited condition that often causes fever and swelling in the abdomen or the lungs
* Fungal or parasitic infections
* Heart surgery, especially coronary-artery bypass grafting
* Cardiac problems (ischemia, pericarditis)
* Inflammatory bowel disease
* Lung cancer and lymphoma
* Other lung diseases like cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, asbestosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and mesothelioma
* Pneumothorax
* Pulmonary embolisms, which are blood clots that enter the lungs
When the space between the pleurae starts to fill with fluid, as in pleural effusion, the chest pain can be eased but a shortness of breath can result, since the lungs need room to expand during breathing. Some cases of pleuritic chest pain are idiopathic, which means that the exact cause cannot be determined.

== Diagnosis ==
A diagnosis of pleurisy or another pleural condition is based on a medical history, physical examinations, and diagnostic tests. The goals are to rule out other sources of the symptoms and to find the cause of the pleurisy so that the underlying disorder can be treated.

=== Physical examination ===
A doctor uses a stethoscope to listen to the breathing. This method detects any unusual sounds in the lungs. A person with pleurisy may have inflamed layers of the pleurae that make a rough, scratchy sound as they rub against each other during breathing. This is called pleural friction rub.

=== Diagnostic tests ===
Depending on the results of the physical examination, diagnostic tests are sometimes performed.

==== Chest X-ray ====
A chest X-ray takes a picture of the heart and lungs. It may show air or fluid in the pleural space. It also may show the cause (e.g., pneumonia, a fractured rib, or a lung tumor) of the pleurisy.

Sometimes an X-ray is taken while lying on the painful side. This may show fluid, as well as changes in fluid position, that did not appear in the vertical X-ray.

==== Blood test ====
Blood tests can detect bacterial or viral infections, pneumonia, rheumatic fever, a pulmonary embolism, or lupus.

==== ECG ====
Electrocardiography test can determine if a heart condition contributes to the symptoms.

==== Ultrasound ====
Ultrasonography uses sound waves to create an image. It may show where fluid is located in the chest. It also can show some tumors. Although ultrasound may detect fluid around the lungs, also known as a pleural effusion, sound waves are scattered by air. Therefore, an actual picture of the lungs cannot be obtained with ultrasonography.

==== Computed tomography (CT) scan ====
A CT scan provides a computer-generated picture of the lungs that can show pockets of fluid. It also may show signs of pneumonia, a lung abscess, or a tumor.

==== Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ====
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), also called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scanning, uses powerful magnets to show pleural effusions and tumors.

==== Arterial blood gas ====
In arterial blood-gas sampling, a small amount of blood is taken from an artery, usually in the wrist. The blood is then checked for oxygen and carbon-dioxide levels. This test shows how well the lungs are taking in oxygen.

==== Thoracentesis ====
Once the presence of an excess fluid in the pleural cavity, or pleural effusion, is suspected and location of fluid is confirmed, a sample of fluid can be removed for testing. The procedure to remove fluid in the chest is called a diagnostic thoracentesis. The doctor inserts a small needle or a thin, hollow, plastic tube in the chest wall and withdraws fluid.

Thoracentesis can be done in the doctor&#x27;s office or at the hospital. Ultrasound is used to guide the needle to the fluid that is trapped in small pockets around the lungs.

Thoracentesis usually does not cause serious complications. Generally, a chest x-ray is done after the procedure to evaluate the lungs. Possible complications of thoracentesis include the following:
* Bleeding and bruising where the needle went in. In rare cases, bleeding may occur in or around the lung. The doctor can use a chest tube to drain the blood. In some cases, surgery is needed.
* Infection where the needle went in
* Injury to the liver or spleen (in rare cases)
* Pain.
* Pneumothorax, or buildup of air in the pleural space, with a collapsed or partially collapsed lung. Sometimes air comes in through the needle or the needle makes a hole in the lung. Usually, a hole seals itself—but sometimes air builds up around the lung and makes it collapse. A chest tube removes the air and lets the lung expand again.

The lung fluid is examined under a microscope and is evaluated for the presence of chemicals and for its color and texture. The degree of clarity is an indicator of infection, cancer, or other conditions that may be causing the buildup of fluid or blood in the pleural space.

==== Biopsy ====
If tuberculosis or cancer is suspected, a small piece of the pleura may be examined under a microscope to make a definitive diagnosis. This is called a biopsy.

Several approaches to taking tissue samples are available 
# Insertion of a needle through the skin on the chest to remove a small sample of the outer layer of the pleura
# Insertion of a small tube with a light on the end (endoscope) into tiny cuts in the chest wall to visualize the pleura, and biopsy of small pieces of tissue through the endoscope
# Removal of a sample of the pleura through a small cut in the chest wall (open pleural biopsy), usually done if the sample from the needle biopsy is too small for accurate diagnosis

== Treatment ==
Treatment has several goals:
* Relief of symptoms
* Removal of the fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space
* Treatment of the underlying condition

=== Procedures ===
If large amounts of fluid, air, or blood are not removed from the pleural space, they may cause the lung to collapse.

The surgical procedures used to drain fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space are as follows:

* During thoracentesis, a needle or a thin, hollow, plastic tube is inserted through the ribs in the back of the chest into the chest wall. A syringe is attached to draw fluid out of the chest. This procedure can remove more than 6 cups (1.5 litres) of fluid at a time.
* When larger amounts of fluid must be removed, a chest tube may be inserted through the chest wall. The doctor injects a local anesthetic into the area of the chest wall outside where the fluid is. A plastic tube is then inserted into the chest between two ribs. The tube is connected to a box that suctions the fluid out. A chest x-ray is taken to check the tube&#x27;s position.
* A chest tube is also used to drain blood and air from the pleural space. This can take several days. The tube is left in place, and the patient usually stays in the hospital during this time.
* Sometimes the fluid contains thick pus or blood clots, or it may have formed a hard skin or peel. This makes it harder to drain the fluid. To help break up the pus or blood clots, the doctor may use the chest tube to put certain medicines into the pleural space. These medicines are called fibrinolytics. If the pus or blood clots still do not drain out, surgery may be necessary.

=== Medications ===
A couple of medications are used to relieve pleurisy symptoms:
* Paracetamol (acetaminophen) or anti-inflammatory agents to control pain and decrease inflammation. Only indomethacin (brand name Indocin) has been studied with respect to relief of pleurisy.
* Codeine-based cough syrups to control the cough

There may be a role for the use of corticosteroids (for tuberculous pleurisy), tacrolimus (Prograf) and methotrexate (Trexall, Rheumatrex) in the treatment of pleurisy. Further studies are needed.

=== Lifestyle changes ===
The following may be helpful in the management of pleurisy:
* Lying on the painful side may be more comfortable
* Breathing deeply and coughing to clear mucus as the pain eases. Otherwise, pneumonia may develop.
* Getting rest

=== Treating the cause ===
Ideally, the treatment of pleurisy is aimed at eliminating the underlying cause of the disease.
* If the pleural fluid is infected, treatment involves antibiotics and draining the fluid. If the infection is tuberculosis or from a fungus, treatment involves long-term use of antibiotics or antifungal medicines.
* If the fluid is caused by tumors of the pleura, it may build up again quickly after it is drained. Sometimes anti-tumor medicines prevent further fluid buildup. If they do not, the doctor may seal the pleural space. This is called pleurodesis. Pleurodesis involves the drainage of all the fluid out of the chest through a chest tube. A substance is inserted through the chest tube into the pleural space. This substance irritates the surface of the pleura. This causes the two layers of the pleurae to squeeze shut so there is no room for more fluid to build up.
* Chemotherapy or radiation treatment also may be used to reduce the size of the tumors.
* If congestive heart failure is causing the fluid buildup, treatment usually includes diuretics and other medicines.

The treatment for pleurisy depends on its origin and is prescribed by a physician on a base of an individual assessment. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and amoxicillin, or other antibiotics in case of bacterial infections, are common remedies dispensed by doctors to relieve the initial symptoms and pain in the chest, while viral infections are self-limited. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), preferably indometacin, are usually employed as pain control agents.

=== Alternative treatments ===
A number of alternative or complementary medicines are being investigated for their anti-inflammatory properties, and their use in pleurisy. At this time, clinical trials of these compounds have not been performed.

Extracts from the Brazilian folk remedy &quot;Wilbrandia ebracteata&quot; (&quot;Taiuia&quot;) have been shown to reduce inflammation in the pleural cavity of mice. The extract is thought to inhibit the same enzyme, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), as the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

== Prognosis ==
Pleurisy, and other disorders of the pleurae, can be serious, depending on what caused them. Generally, pleurisy treatment has an excellent prognosis, but if left untreated it can cause severe complications. For example, a resulting pulmonary heart disease, cor pulmonale, which manifests itself in an inflammation of the arms and legs, can lead to heart failure. If the conditions that caused the pleurisy or other pleural disorders were adequately diagnosed and treated early, one can expect a full recovery. Help of a pulmonologist (respiratory physician in the U.K. and Australia) may be enlisted to deal with the underlying cause, and chart post-illness rehabilitation.

<text>John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr, (23 September 1880 – 25 June 1971), styled Sir John Boyd Orr from 1935 to 1949, was a Scottish teacher, medical doctor, biologist, nutritional physiologist, politician, businessman and farmer who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his scientific research into nutrition and his work as the first Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

He was the co-founder and the first President (1960–1971) of the World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS). In 1945, he was elected President of the National Peace Council and was President of the World Union of Peace Organisations and the World Movement for World Federal Government.

== Early life and family background ==

John Boyd Orr was born at Kilmaurs, near Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, Scotland, the middle child in a family of seven children. His father, Robert Clark Orr, was a quarry owner, and a man of deep religious convictions, being a member of the Free Church of Scotland. His mother, Annie Boyd, was the daughter of another quarry master, wealthier than Robert Orr, and Past Master of a Masonic lodge.

He was taught to read at an early age by his widowed grandmother, who lived with the family. The family home was well supplied with books, and his father was widely read in political, sociological and metaphysical subjects, as well as religion. As he grew older, John would regularly discuss these subjects with his father, brothers, and visiting friends.

When he was five years old, the family suffered a setback when a ship owned by Robert Orr was lost at sea. They had to sell their home in Kilmaurs, and moved to West Kilbride, a village on the North Ayrshire coast. According to Kay, the new house and environment were a great improvement on Kilmaurs, despite the family&#x27;s reduced means. The major part of his upbringing took place in and around West Kilbride. Apart from a four-month break at age thirteen, he attended the village school until age nineteen, the last four years as a pupil-teacher. Religion was then an important part of junior education in Scotland, and the school gave him a good knowledge of the Bible, which stayed with him for the rest of his life.

At the age of 13, Boyd Orr won a bursary to Kilmarnock Academy, a significant achievement as such bursaries were then rare. The new school was some from his home in West Kilbride, but his father owned a quarry about two miles (3 km) from the academy, and John was provided with accommodation nearby. His family cut short his education at the academy because, at the expense of his school attendance, he was spending time with the quarry workers, who let him work the machinery, and from whom he picked up a &quot;wonderful vocabulary of swear words&quot;. After four months he returned to the village school in West Kilbride where he continued his education under the inspirational tutelage of Headmaster John G. Lyons. There he became a pupil teacher at a salary of £10 for the first year, and £20 for the second. This was a particularly demanding time for the young Boyd Orr, as in addition to his teaching duties, and studying at home for his university entrance and teacher-training qualifications, he also had to work every day in his father&#x27;s business.

==University of Glasgow==
After four years as a pupil-teacher, at the age of 19, he won a Queen&#x27;s Scholarship to study at a teacher training college in Glasgow, plus a bursary which paid for his lodgings there. The course required attending classes at the college, in addition to following the three-year Arts course, based on classics, at the university. As Boyd Orr had passed his university entrance examinations, the fees for the university were also covered. The university education was considered the more important part of the course.

Boyd Orr criticised the university course because the hard work required to pass the exams did not allow sufficient time to meet and to discuss with students of different social backgrounds.

== First encounters with poverty and teaching career ==
As an undergraduate in Glasgow, he explored the interior of the city, usually at weekends. He was shocked by what he found in the poverty-stricken slums and tenements, which then made up a large part of the city. Rickets was obvious among the children, malnutrition (in some cases, associated with drunkenness) was shown by many of the adults, and many of the aged were destitute. In his first teaching job after graduating MA in 1902, he was posted to a school in the slums. His first class was overcrowded and the children ill-fed or actually hungry, inadequately clothed, visibly lousy and physically wretched. He resigned after a few days since he realised that he could not teach children in such a condition and that there was nothing he could do to relieve their misery.

After working for a few months in his father&#x27;s business, he taught for three years at Kyleshill School in Saltcoats, also a poor area, but less squalid than the slums of Glasgow. Boyd Orr needed to augment his teacher&#x27;s salary, and decided to do so by instructing an evening class in book-keeping and accountancy. After intensive study he passed the necessary examinations, and duly instructed his class. The knowledge and skills he learned by studying for and teaching this class were to prove useful in his later career.

== Return to university ==
Boyd Orr realised that his heart was not in teaching, and after fulfilling his teaching obligations under the terms of his Queen&#x27;s Scholarship, he returned to the university to study biology, a subject he had always been interested in since childhood. As a precaution, he entered simultaneously for a degree in medicine.

He found the university to be a stimulating environment. Diarmid Noel Paton (son of the artist Joseph Noel Paton) was Regius Professor of Physiology, and Edward Provan Cathcart head of Physiological Chemistry, both men of outstanding scientific ability. He was impressed by Samson Gemmell, Professor of Clinical Medicine, a philosopher whose deep thinking on social affairs also influenced Boyd Orr&#x27;s approach to such questions.

Half-way through his medical studies, his savings ran out. Reluctant to ask his family for support, he bought a block of tenanted flats on mortgage, with the help of a bank overdraft, and used the rents to pay for the rest of his studies. On graduating, he sold the property for a small profit.

He graduated with a BSc in 1910, and MB ChB in 1912, at the age of 32, placing sixth in a year of 200 students. Two years later, in 1914, he graduated MD with honours, receiving the Bellahouston Gold Medal for the most distinguished thesis of the year.

== Research career ==
On leaving the university, he took a position as a ship&#x27;s surgeon on a ship trading between Scotland and West Africa, choosing this job because it offered the possibility of paying off his bank overdraft faster than any other. He resigned after four months, when he had repaid the debt. He then tried general practice, working as a &quot;locum&quot; in the practice of his family doctor in Saltcoats, and was offered a partnership there. Realising that a career in medicine was not for him, he instead accepted the offer of a two-year Carnegie research scholarship, to work in E. P. Cathcart&#x27;s laboratory. The work he began there covered malnutrition, protein and creatine metabolism, the effect of water intake on nitrogenous metabolism in humans, and the energy expenditure of military recruits in training.

=== The beginnings of the Rowett Research Institute ===
On 1 April 1914, Boyd Orr took charge of a new research institute in Aberdeen, a project of a joint committee for research into animal nutrition of the North of Scotland College of Agriculture and the University of Aberdeen. He had been offered the post on the recommendation of E. P. Cathcart, who had originally been offered the job, but had turned it down in favour of a chair in physiology in London.

The joint committee had allocated a budget of £5,000 for capital expenditure and £1,500 for annual running costs. Boyd Orr recognised immediately that these sums were inadequate. Using his experience in his father&#x27;s business of drawing up plans and estimating costs, he submitted a budget of £50,000 for capital expenditure and £5,000 for annual running costs. Meanwhile, with the £5,000 he had already been allocated he specified a building, not of wood as had been envisaged by the committee, but of granite and designed so that it could serve as a wing of his proposed £50,000 Institute. He accepted the lowest tender of £5,030, and told the contractors to begin work immediately. The committee were not pleased, but had to accept the &quot;fait accompli&quot;. When war broke out the contractors were told to finish the walls and roof, but to do no more for the time being.

=== War service (1914–1918) ===
On the outbreak of the First World War he was given leave to join the British Army, and asked his former colleague E. P. Cathcart to help him obtain a medical commission in an infantry unit overseas. Cathcart thought he would be more useful at home, and his first commission was in a special civilian section of the R.A.M.C. dealing with sanitation. Several divisions of non-conscripted recruits were in training in emergency camps at home, some of them in poor sanitary conditions. Boyd Orr was able to push through schemes for improvement in hygiene, preventing much sickness.

After 18 months he was posted as Medical Officer to an infantry unit, the 1st battalion Sherwood Foresters. He spent much of his time in shell holes, patching up the many wounded. His courage under fire and devotion to duty were recognised by the award of a Military Cross after the Battle of the Somme, and of the Distinguished Service Order after Passchendaele. He also made arrangements for the battalion&#x27;s diet to be supplemented by vegetables collected from local deserted gardens and fields. As a result, unlike other units, he did not need to send any of the men in his medical charge to hospital. He also prevented his men getting trench foot by personally ensuring they were fitted with boots a size larger than usual.

Worried that he was losing touch with medical and nutritional advances, he asked to be transferred to the navy, where he thought he would have more time available for reading and research. The army was reluctant to let him go, but agreed, since he was still a civilian surgeon. He spent a busy three months in the naval hospital at Chatham, studying hard while practicing medicine in the wards, before being posted to HMS &quot;Furious&quot;. On board ship his medical duties were light, enabling him to do a great deal of reading. He was later recalled to work studying food requirements of the army.

=== Post-war expansion of the Rowett Research Institute ===
When Boyd Orr returned to Aberdeen in early 1919, his plan for a larger Institute had still not been accepted. Indeed, even his plans for the annual maintenance grant had to be approved by the Professor of Agriculture in Cambridge, Thomas Barlow Wood. Despite gaining the latter&#x27;s support, his expansion plans were at first rebuffed, although he succeeded in having the annual grant increased to £4,000. In 1920 he was introduced to John Quiller Rowett, a businessman who seemed to have qualms of conscience over the large profits he had made during the war. Shortly afterwards, the government agreed to finance half the cost of Boyd Orr&#x27;s plan, provided he could raise the other half elsewhere. Rowett agreed to provide £10,000 for the first year, £10,000 for the second year, and gave an additional £2,000 for the purchase of a farm, provided that, &quot;if any work done at the Institute on animal nutrition was found to have a bearing on human nutrition, the Institute would be allowed to follow up this work&quot;, a condition the Treasury was willing to accept. By September 1922 the buildings were nearly completed, and the renamed Rowett Research Institute was opened shortly thereafter by Queen Mary.

Boyd Orr proved to be an effective fund-raiser from both government and private sources, expanding the experimental farm to around , building a well-endowed library, and expanding the buildings. He also built a centre for accommodating students and scientists attracted by the institute&#x27;s growing reputation, a reputation enhanced by Boyd Orr&#x27;s many publications. His research output suffered from the time and energy he had to devote to fund-raising, and in later life he said, &quot;I still look with bitter resentment at having to spend half my time in the humiliating job of hunting for money for the Institute.&quot;

Through the 1920s, his own research was devoted mainly to animal nutrition, his focus changed to human nutrition both as a researcher and an active lobbyist and propagandist for improving people&#x27;s diets. Isabella Leitch had been employed as a temporary librarian but she was soon his assistant where she spread &quot;the gospel according to Sir John&quot;. In 1927, Boyd Orr proved the value of milk being supplied to school children, which led to free school milk provision in the UK. His 1936 report &quot;Food, Health and Income&quot; showed that at least one third of the UK population were so poor that they could not afford to buy sufficient food to provide a healthy diet and revealed that there was a link between low-income, malnutrition and under-achievement in schools.

From 1929 to 1944, Boyd Orr was Consultant Director to the Imperial Bureau of Animal Nutrition, later the Commonwealth Bureau of Nutrition (part of the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux), which was based at the Rowett Research Institute. During the Second World War he was a member of Churchill&#x27;s Scientific Committee on Food Policy and helped to formulate food rationing

== International and political work ==
In October 1945, Orr was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow after standing as an Independent Progressive candidate. He was elected as an independent Member of Parliament (MP) for the Combined Scottish Universities in a by-election in April 1945, and kept his seat at the general election shortly after. He resigned in 1946.

After the Second World War, Boyd Orr resigned from the Rowett Institute, and took several posts, most notably as Director-General of the United Nations&#x27; new Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Although his tenure in this position was short (1945–1948), he worked not only to alleviate the immediate postwar food shortage through the International Emergency Food Committee (IEFC) but also to propose comprehensive plans for improving food production and its equitable distribution.His proposal to create a World Food Board to increase price stability by way of large scale commodity storage. Although the board failed to get the support of Britain and the US, Boyd Orr laid a firm foundation for the new UN-specialized agency.

He then resigned from the FAO and became director of a number of companies and proved a canny investor in the stock market, making a considerable personal fortune. When he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1949, he donated the entire financial award to organizations devoted to world peace and a united world government. He was elevated to the peerage in 1949 as Baron Boyd-Orr, of Brechin Mearns in the County of Angus.

In 1960 Boyd Orr was elected the first president of the World Academy of Art and Science, which was set up by eminent scientists of the day concerned about the potential misuse of scientific discoveries, most especially nuclear weapons.

Along with Albert Einstein, Orr was one of the sponsors of the Peoples&#x27; World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples&#x27; World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place in 1950–51 at Palais Electoral, Geneva, Switzerland. He was also one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

Boyd Orr was a member of Bertrand Russell&#x27;s &quot;Who Killed Kennedy Committee?&quot; which challenged the official version of the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

==Personal life==
In 1915, Boyd Orr married Elizabeth Pearson Callum, whom he had met as a teenager in West Kilbride. They had three children: Elizabeth Joan (born 1916), Helen Anne (born 1919) and Donald Noel (1921–1942). His son was killed on active service during the Second World War. A committed Christian, Boyd Orr was President of the Free Church Association at the University of Glasgow for many years.

==Death and legacy==
Boyd Orr died on 25 June 1971 in Brechin, Scotland; he was 90 years old. His grave is at Stracathro Kirkyard, Angus.

The University of Glasgow has a Boyd Orr Building and the Boyd Orr Centre for Population and Ecosystem Health named after him, and the university&#x27;s Hunterian Museum holds his Nobel medal. There is a street named after Boyd Orr in his home town of Kilmaurs in Ayrshire, as well as in Brechin, Angus, Penicuik, Midlothian, Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire, Aberdeen and in Saltcoats, Ayrshire.

There is a road named after him in Harare, Zimbabwe.

<doc id="322281" wikidata="Q1589444" url="?curid=322281" title="Inter-American Commission on Human Rights">
<text>The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (the IACHR or, in the three other official languages Spanish, French, and Portuguese CIDH, &quot;Comisión Interamericana de los Derechos Humanos&quot;, &quot;Commission Interaméricaine des Droits de l&#x27;Homme&quot;, &quot;Comissão Interamericana de Direitos Humanos&quot;) is an autonomous organ of the Organization of American States (OAS).

The separate Inter-American Court of Human Rights is an autonomous judicial institution based in the city of San José, Costa Rica. Together the Court and the Commission make up the human rights protection system of the OAS.

== Composition ==
The IACHR is a permanent body, with headquarters in Washington, D.C., United States, and it meets in regular and special sessions several times a year to examine allegations of human rights violations in the hemisphere.

Its human rights duties stem from three documents:
* the OAS Charter
* the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man
* the American Convention on Human Rights

== History of the Inter-American human rights system ==
The inter-American system for the protection of human rights emerged with the adoption of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man by the OAS in April 1948 the first international human rights instrument of a general nature, predating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by more than six months.

The IACHR was created in 1959. It held its first meeting in 1960, and it conducted its first on-site visit to inspect the human rights situation in the Dominican Republic in 1961.

A major step in the development of the system was taken in 1965 when the commission was expressly authorized to examine specific cases of human rights violations. Since that date the IACHR has received thousands of petitions and has processed in excess of 12,000 individual cases.

In 1969, the guiding principles behind the American Declaration were taken, reshaped, and restated in the American Convention on Human Rights. The Convention defines the human rights that the states parties are required to respect and guarantee, and it also ordered the establishment of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. It is currently binding on 24 of the OAS&#x27;s 35 member states.

The commission&#x27;s performance has not been always welcomed. Among others, Venezuela has accused the Commission of politicization. Others criticize the commission&#x27;s stress on certain issues over others. These criticisms have given rise to what was called the &quot;Strengthening Process of the Commission&quot;. This process began in 2011, led by the States belonging to the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas.

== Functions ==

The main task of the IACHR is to promote the observance and defense of human rights in the Americas.

In pursuit of this mandate it:

* Receives, analyzes, and investigates individual petitions alleging violations of specific human rights protected by the American Convention on Human Rights.
* Works to resolve petitions in a collaborative way that is amiable to both parties.
* Monitors the general human rights situation in the OAS&#x27;s member states and, when necessary, prepares and publishes country-specific human rights reports.
* Conducts on-site visits to examine members&#x27; general human rights situation or to investigate specific cases.
* Encourages public awareness about human rights and related issues throughout the hemisphere.
* Holds conferences, seminars, and meetings with governments, NGOs, academic institutions, etc. to inform and raise awareness about issues relating to the inter-American human rights system.
* Issues member states with recommendations that, if adopted, would further the cause of human rights protection.
* Requests that states adopt precautionary measures to prevent serious and irreparable harm to human rights in urgent cases.
* Refers cases to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and litigates those same cases before the Court.
* Asks the Inter-American Court to provide advisory opinions on matters relating to the interpretation of the convention or other related instruments.

==Rapporteurships and units==
The IACHR has created several thematic rapporteurships and two special rapporteurships to monitor OAS states&#x27; compliance with inter-American human rights treaties in the following areas:

* Rapporteurship on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (1990)
* Rapporteurship on the Rights of Women (the first rapporteurship created by the IACHR in 1994)
* Rapporteurship on Migrant Workers and their Families (1996)
* Rapporteurship on the Rights of the Child (1998)
* Rapporteurship on Human Rights Defenders (2001)
* Rapporteurship on the Rights of Persons Deprived of Liberty (2004)
* Rapporteurship on the Rights of Afro-Descendants and against Racial Discrimination (2005)
* Rapporteurship on the Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Trans, Bisexual, and Intersex Persons (2014) 
* Rapporteurship on Memory, Truth, and Justice (2019)
* Rapporteurship on the Rights of Older Persons (2019)
* Rapporteurship on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2019

The Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression and the are full-time dedicated positions. The former was created in 1997, while the latter was established in 2017, with Soledad García Muñoz of Argentina as the first holder of the office.
The other rapporteurships are in the hands of the commissioners, who have other functions at the IACHR and also their own jobs in their home countries, since their work as commissioners is unpaid.

Rapporteurships are initially established by the commission as thematic units prior to being upgraded to rapporteurships.

The IACHR also has a Press and Outreach Office.

==Petitions==
The Commission processes petitions lodged with it pursuant to its Rules of Procedure.

Petitions may be filed by NGOs or individuals. Unlike most court filings, petitions are confidential documents and are not made public. Petitions must meet three requirements; domestic remedies must have already been tried and failed (exhaustion), petitions must be filed within six months of the last action taken in a domestic system (timeliness), petitions can not be before another court (duplication of procedure).

Once a petition has been filed, it follows the following procedure:

* Petition is forwarded to the Secretariat and reviewed for completeness; if complete, it is registered and is given a case number. This is where the state is notified of the petition.
* Petition reviewed for admissibility.
* The Commission tries to find a friendly settlement.
* If no settlement is found, then briefs are filed by each side on the merits of the case.
* The Commission then files a report on the merits, known as an Article 50 report from relevant article of the convention. This is a basically a ruling by the commission with recommendations on how to solve the conflict. The Article 50 report is sent to the state. This is a confidential report; the petitioner does not get a full copy of this report.
* The state is given two months to comply with the recommendations of the report.
* The petitioner then has one month to file a petition asking for the issue to be sent to the Inter-American Court (only applicable if the State in question has recognized the competence of the Inter-American Court).
* The commission has three months, from the date the Article 50 report is given to the state, to either publish the Article 50 report or send the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Alternatively, the commission can also choose to monitor the situation. The American Convention establishes that if the report is not submitted to the Court within three months it may not be submitted in the future, but if the State asks for more time in order to comply with the recommendations of the Article 50 report, the Commission might grant it on the condition that the State signs a waiver on this requirement.

== Composition ==
The IACHR&#x27;s ranking officers are its seven commissioners. The commissioners are elected by the OAS General Assembly, for four-year terms, with the possibility of re-election on one occasion, for a maximum period in office of eight years. They serve in a personal capacity and are not considered to represent their countries of origin but rather &quot;all the member countries of the Organization&quot; (Art. 35 of the convention).
The convention (Art. 34) says that they must &quot;be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights&quot;.
No two nationals of the same member state may be commissioners simultaneously (Art. 37), and commissioners are required to refrain from participating in the discussion of cases involving their home countries.

=== Current commissioners (2024) ===


=== Past commissioners ===


=== Executive Secretaries ===
The staff of the IACHR comprise its Secretariat, which is led by an Executive Secretary, who serves for what have recently been four-year, renewable contracts.

In August 2020, OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro announced that he would not renew Paulo Abrão&#x27;s contract as Executive Secretary of the IACHR, citing 61 personnel complaints by staff of the organization. The Commissioners of the IACHR had unanimously approved the contract extension in January 2020, and expressed their &quot;profound rejection&quot; of Almagro&#x27;s action &quot;whose refusal to renew this contract breaks with a 20-year practice of respecting the IACHR&#x27;s decision to appoint its own Executive Secretary and thus makes it difficult to obtain truth, justice, and reparation for those whose labor rights have been affected.&quot; UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, Human Rights Watch, and the Mexican government have also objected to Abrão&#x27;s removal.

Tania Reneaum, a Mexican, was appointed as the new Executive Secretary in 2021.

<doc id="322288" wikidata="Q21164" url="?curid=322288" title="Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany">
<text>The Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (, or , BVO) is the only federal decoration of Germany. It is awarded for special achievements in political, economic, cultural, intellectual or honorary fields. It was created by the first President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Theodor Heuss, on 7 September 1951. Colloquially, the decorations of the different classes of the Order are also known as the Federal Cross of Merit ().

It has been awarded to over 262,000 individuals in total, both Germans and foreigners. Since the 1990s, the number of annual awards has declined from over 4,000, first to around 2,500, then from 2015 to under 1,500, with a low of 918 awards in 2022. Since 2013, women have made up a steady 30–35% of recipients.

Most of the German federal states () have each their own order of merit as well, with the exception of the Free and Hanseatic Cities of Bremen and Hamburg, which reject any orders (by tradition their citizens, particularly former or present senators, will refuse any decoration in the form of an order, the most famous example being former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt).

==History==
The order was established on 7 September 1951 by the decree of Federal President Theodor Heuss. Signed by Heuss, German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, and Minister of the Interior Robert Lehr, the decree states:

In 2022 Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier introduced a gender quota which demands a minimum of 40% of nominees to the order to be women.

==Classes==
The Order comprises four groups with eight regular classes and one special (medal) class (hereafter enumerated in English):
* Grand Cross ()
** Grand Cross special class of the Order of Merit (, Special Class of Grand Cross), official insignia of the President of Germany, reserved for heads of state and their spouses
** Grand Cross 1st class of the Order of Merit in exceptional finish (, Grand Cross 1st class in exceptional finish), reserved for former Federal Chancellors of Germany
** Grand Cross 1st class of the Order of Merit (, Grand Cross 1st class)
* Great Cross of Merit ()
** Grand Cross of the Order of Merit (, Great Cross of Merit with Star and Sash)
** Knight Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit (, Great Cross of Merit with Star)
** Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit (, Great Cross of Merit)
* Cross of Merit ()
** Officer&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit (, Cross of Merit 1st Class)
** Cross of the Order of Merit (, Cross of Merit)
* Medal of Merit ()
** Medal of the Order of Merit (, Medal of Merit)

The President of the Federal Republic holds the &quot;Grand Cross special class&quot; ex officio. It is awarded to him in a ceremony by the President of the Bundestag, attended by the Chancellor of Germany, the President of the Bundesrat, and the Supreme Court President. Other than the German president, only a foreign head of state and their spouse can be awarded with this highest class. There is also the provision of awarding the &quot;Grand Cross 1st class in exceptional finish&quot; (), in which the central medallion with the black eagle is surrounded by a stylized laurel wreath in relief. This &quot;Grand Cross 1st class in exceptional finish&quot; has been awarded only to three persons, the former German chancellors Konrad Adenauer, Helmut Kohl and Angela Merkel.

==Insignia==

Except for the lowest class, the medal, the badge is the same for all classes, but with slightly different versions for men and women (slightly smaller badge and ribbon for women):

The badge for the Member and Officer classes however are only enamelled on one side, and flat on the reverse. The &quot;badge&quot; of the Order is made up of a golden four-armed cross enamelled in red, with a central gold disc bearing a black enamelled German federal eagle ().

The &quot;star&quot; is a golden star with straight rays, its size and points vary according to class, with the badge superimposed upon it. An interesting fact about the stars, of which no less than four grades use one, is that they all have the same basic shape as various other breast stars from German history. 

* 8-pointed golden Star: Grand Cross special class - the same shape as the Prussian Order of the Black Eagle
* 6-pointed golden Star: Grand Cross 1st class (and &quot;special issue&quot; design if golden oak crown between the cross branches around the medallion) - the same shape as the Third Reich Order of the German Eagle
* 4-pointed golden Star: Grand Cross (Grand Cross of Merit with Star and Sash) - the same shape as the Third Reich Social Welfare Decoration
* silver Square-upon-point: Knight Commander (Grand Officer) - the same shape as the Grand Cross of the Pour le Mérite

The reasoning behind this is not clear. It is not known if this is deliberate or coincidence, as the tools used to make the stars were in short supply after the war, and using stamping dies that were readily available and could be reused or acquired from other manufacturers would have been a good way of cutting costs and simplifying production in a Germany only just starting to experience the . It is of course possible that this could have been deliberate, and a way to celebrate German history in the design of the new honour for the Federal Republic. This is unlikely however as two stars represent decorations awarded during the Third Reich, and the other two are of Prussian origin. Prussia itself had only been recently abolished and the legacy of so called &quot;Prussian militarism&quot; was not something openly celebrated in the new Federal Republic of Germany. 

The &quot;riband&quot; of the Order is made up of the colours of the German flag. The pattern is a large central band of red, edged on both sides in a smaller band of gold-black-gold.
