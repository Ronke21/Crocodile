<text>Music is an integral part of Mongolian culture. Among the unique contributions of Mongolia to the world&#x27;s musical culture are the long songs, overtone singing, and morin khuur, the horse-headed fiddle. The music of Mongolia is also rich with varieties related to the various ethnic groups of the country: Oirats, Hotogoid, Tuvans, Darhad, Buryats, Tsaatan, Dariganga, Uzemchins, Barga, Kazakhs and Khalha.

Besides the traditional music, Western classical music and ballet flourished during the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic. Among the most popular forms of modern music in Mongolia are Western pop and rock genres and the mass songs, which are written by modern authors in a form of folk songs.

==Traditional music==
===Overtone singing===

Overtone singing, known as &quot;höömij&quot; (throat), is a singing technique also found in the general Central Asian area. This type of singing is considered more as a type of instrument. It involves different ways of breathing: producing two distinctively audible pitches at the same time, one being a whistle like sound and the other being a drone bass. The sound is a result of locked breaths in the chest.

In Mongolia, the most famous throat-singers include Khalkhas like Gereltsogt and Sundui.

Khalkha singers have conceptualized Mongolian lyrical xöömei into several different styles while kharkhiraa remains a separate technique.

*uyangiin xöömii /melodic or lyrical xöömii
**uruulyn / labial xöömii
**tagnain /palatal xöömii
**xamryn/ nasal xöömii
**bagaIzuuryn, xooloin / glottal, throat xöömii
**tseejiin xondiin, xeviiin / chest cavity, stomach xöömii
**türlegt or xosmoljin xöömii / xöömii combined with long song

===Long song===
&quot;Long songs&quot; (&quot;Urtyin duu&quot;) are one of the main formats of Mongolian music. Firstly, when Genghis Khan first united Mongolia (13th century), many different tribes were brought together, and this allowed sharing of music that had not happened before. The song &quot;Ertnii Saikhan&quot; was a popular song at weddings and imperial meetings, and the song &quot;Oyunt Khuu&quot; was a popular song. The most distinguishing feature is that each syllable of text is extended for a long duration; a four-minute song may only consist of ten words. Other features are a slow tempo, wide intervals and no fixed rhythm. The richer and longer hold a singer has, the more appreciated the singer. Lyrical themes vary depending on context; they can be philosophical, religious, romance, or celebratory, and often use horses as a symbol or theme repeated throughout the song. Eastern Mongols typically use a &quot;morin khuur&quot; (horse-head fiddle) as accompaniment, sometimes with a type of indigenous flute named limbe. Oirat groups of the Western Mongols typically sing long songs unaccompanied or accompanied with the igil.

===Court music===

In neighboring China&#x27;s autonomous region of Inner Mongolia, 15 notated chapters of the court music of the last Mongolian Great Khan Ligdan (1588–1634) was found in a temple near the ruins of his palace Chagan Haote (Ochirt Tsagan Khot). It was already known that the Qing Dynasty of China greatly valued Mongol court music and made it an integral part of its royal ceremonies, especially at feasts.

==Pop music==
Largely unknown outside of Mongolia, there is a thriving popular music scene centred in the city of Ulaanbaatar. Actually, this is a mixture of various kinds of popular music. It is often subdivided into pop, rock, hip hop, and alternative (consisting of alternative rock and heavy metal). The pop scene includes solo artists, such as the renowned Ariunaa, also Altaa, Bayartsetseg, Bold, BX, Delgermörön, Erdenetsetseg, Jargalsaikhan.D, Onon, Sarantuya and Serchmaa, boy bands like Camerton, Nomin Talst and Motive, and girl groups like Kiwi, Gala, 3 ohin, Lipstick, SweetYmotion, Anemone and The Wasabies.

The alternative scene bands incclude Nisvanis, Night train,Otgoo, Magnolian, and The Lemons, the rock scene rock-n-roll like the Pilots and Soyol Erdene, folk rock like Altan Urag and hard rock bands like Haranga, Hurd, Chinggis khaan and Niciton, and there are also some techno bands such as Khar Sarnai. A few of the younger Mongolian popular artists are becoming increasingly well-established internationally, most notably, the young female singer Nominjin (singing in eight languages in a variety of genres), singer Enguun, the winner of the season 1 of The Voice of Mongolia, and Amarkhuu Borkhuu, a star of the Russian pop music.

Hip-hop/Rap has gained considerable popularity in Mongolia. From the early 1990s, Mongolian teenagers and youngsters formed dancing groups with anywhere between three and thirty members that started to compete in national tournaments. This was the beginning of the Mongolian hip-hop movement. For some reason, single rappers had never &quot;made it&quot; into the Mongolian hip-hop scene. Although, the Mongolian-Swedish rapper Battulga Munkhbayar, also known as &quot;The yellow Eminem&quot; and &quot;50 öre&quot;, has made it to the big stages in Sweden because of his unique rap style. He wasn&#x27;t so successful as a pickpocket on the streets of Bangkok, though, being arrested there for thieving a Slovak tourist&#x27;s wallet in 2019. Early bands include Har Tas and MC Boys. The latter two groups represented the beginning of rap in Mongolia. Their songs mostly stressed social issues, philosophy and rebellious ideas. A later generation consisted of bands and solo artists like Dain ba Enkh, &quot;2 Khüü&quot;, &quot;Erkh-Chölöö&quot;, Lumino, Mon-Ta-Rap, Ice Top, Odko, Big Gee, Quiza, B.A.T, URMC, and female rappers Gennie with Hulan. They continued with similar messages as their predecessors but also came to include “soft” touches in their songs, which faced strong resistance from hardcore rap fans but were welcomed by the general public.

==Popular folk music==

There is also a long established and distinctive &quot;Mongolian pop&quot; genre that occupies the same place on the musical spectrum as Japanese Enka music or Western soft-pop-oriented folk music or country music. Classic singers from the late 20th and early 21st centuries include Vandan and Dulamsüren, Batsükh, Tömörkhuyag and Egschiglen. Some of the repeatedly heard lyrical themes are very distinctive for Mongolia: heartfelt tributes to the songwriter&#x27;s mother, for example, or paeans to great horses.

Mongolian popular folk music is not considered world music in the west and was long generally unavailable outside Mongolia, but can now be downloaded from various Mongolian websites. It may be filed under the designation &quot;Zohioliin Duu&quot; (Зохиoлын Дyy) (schlagers). In the Mongolian language, &quot;duu&quot; means song; and the genitive word &quot;zohioliin&quot; derives from the noun for a literary composition. A typical zohioliin duu may include three four-line stanzas and a refrain. The lyrics of zohioliin duu, like those of Mongolian folk poetry, tend to be alliterative. Often, the lines of a zohioliin duu share not only initial letters, but also initial syllables.

==Classical music==

Mongolia features a rich tradition of classical music and ballet. The classical music owes its prosperity in the 2nd half of the 20th century to a patronage of then Socialist government that favoured Western and Russian/Soviet classical arts to Western pop culture. In addition, the Mongolian composers developed a rich diversity of national symphony and ballet.

==Musical Instruments==

===Horse-head fiddle===

The horse-head fiddle, or &quot;morin khuur&quot;, is a distinctively Mongolian instrument and is seen as a symbol of the country. The instrument has two strings. There is some controversy regarding the traditional carving of a horse on the upper end of the pegbox. Some scholars believe that this is proof that the instrument was originally a shamanistic instrument. The staffs of shamans have a horse similarly carved on top; the horse is a much-revered animal in Mongolia.

===Other traditional instruments===
Other instruments used in Mongolian traditional music include the &quot;shudraga&quot; or &quot;shanz&quot; (a three-stringed, long-necked, strummed lute similar to the Chinese sanxian or Japanese shamisen), &quot;khuuchir&quot; (a bowed spike-fiddle), &quot;yatga&quot; (a plucked zither related to the Kazakh Jetigen), &quot;everburee&quot; (a folk oboe), &quot;khel khuur&quot; (Jew&#x27;s harp), &quot;tobshuur&quot; (a plucked lute similar to the dombra), &quot;ikh khuur&quot; (bass &quot;morin khuur&quot;), and &quot;bishhuur&quot; (a pipe similar in sound to a clarinet).

<text>Evander McNair (April 15, 1820 – November 13, 1902) was a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.

==Early life==
Evander McNair was born at Laurel Hill in Scotland County, North Carolina. His parents moved to Simpson County, Mississippi soon after his birth.

In his early twenties McNair opened a mercantile business in Jackson, Mississippi. During the Mexican War McNair joined the 1st Mississippi Rifles under the command of Colonel Jefferson Davis, who would later become President of the Confederacy.

In 1856 McNair moved to Washington, Arkansas, and continued his business there until Arkansas seceded from the Union. McNair raised seven companies of infantry which was augmented with other volunteers and designated the 4th Arkansas Infantry.

Evander McNair became colonel of the 4th Arkansas Infantry Regiment on August 17, 1861. He led his unit into battle first at the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek in southwest Missouri and later at the Battle of Pea Ridge. When General Benjamin McCulloch was killed and Colonel Louis Hébert was captured, McNair became the commander of the brigade.

Soon after the Battle of Pea Ridge McNair and his brigade were transferred east of the Mississippi River. McNair&#x27;s brigade was sent to General Edmund Kirby Smith for his invasion of Kentucky and fought at the Battle of Richmond.

On November 4, 1862, McNair received his commission as Brigadier General. Several other units were folded into his brigade including the 1st and 2nd Arkansas Mounted Rifles (dismounted), the 4th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, 30th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, 4th Arkansas Infantry Battalion, and Humphrey&#x27;s Arkansas Artillery Battery.

On December 31, 1862, McNair and his troops participated in McCown&#x27;s charge on the Union right at the Battle of Stones River near Murfreesboro, Tennessee. In May 1863 McNair and his division were sent to reinforce the Army of Tennessee under General Joseph E. Johnston for the relief of the siege at Vicksburg, Mississippi. McNair participated in the various battles around Jackson, Mississippi.

At the Battle of Chickamauga McNair&#x27;s brigade participated in exploiting the break in the Union lines that turned the battle for the Confederates. During the fierce fighting McNair was wounded and both he and his brigade were sent to Mississippi for recuperation. In 1864 McNair was transferred to the Trans-Mississippi Department where he served for the remainder of the war.

==Postbellum==
After the conflict McNair moved to New Orleans and later to Hattiesburg, Mississippi and Magnolia, Mississippi.

Evander McNair died at Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and is buried at Magnolia Cemetery in Magnolia. His wife, Hannah Merrill McNair, a New York Yankee, preceded him in death in 1878 and is buried next to him.

<text>Angband is a dungeon-crawling roguelike video game derived from &quot;Umoria&quot;. It is based on the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien, in which Angband is the fortress of Morgoth. The current version of &quot;Angband&quot; is available for all major operating systems, including Unix, Windows, Mac OS X, and Android. It is identified as one of the &quot;major roguelikes&quot; by John Harris. &quot;Angband&quot; is free and open source game under the GNU GPLv2 or the angband license.

==Gameplay==
The goal of &quot;Angband&quot; is to survive 100 floor levels of the fortress Angband in order to defeat Morgoth. The game is reputed to be extremely difficult.

The player begins in a town where they can buy equipment before beginning the descent. Once in the maze-like fortress, the player encounters traps, monsters, equipment, and hidden doors. With the help of found objects and enchantments, the player&#x27;s attack and defense power increases, and can even neutralise specific attacks. The player also meets characters and finds artifacts from Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium.

&quot;Angband&quot; gameplay emphasises combat and careful resource management. The player has a certain amount of health points. Although &quot;Angband&quot; records the player&#x27;s progress to a save file, it does not allow one to resume a saved game in which the player character has already been beaten. The levels are procedurally generated, allowing for a unique game in every play.

==Development==
The first version of &quot;Angband&quot; was created by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand at the University of Warwick in 1990. They wanted to expand the game &quot;Umoria&quot; by adding items, monsters, and features. After Cutler and Astrand, the source code was maintained at the University of Warwick by Geoff Hill and Sean Marsh. They finally released the game to the public with the version named &quot;2.4.frog_knows&quot; on 11 April 1993. The game, which was previously confined to the University of Warwick, was then enhanced by others and widely ported to non-Unix platforms.

Following their departure, the later principals of &quot;Angband&quot; have included Charles Swiger, Ben Harrison, and Robert Rühlmann. Harrison was the maintainer responsible for the &quot;Great Code Cleanup&quot;, modularizing, extending, and greatly improving the readability of the &quot;Angband&quot; source code. This in turn led to the large number of variants currently available, as well as the rather large number of ports. Like other maintainers, he eventually moved on to other interests, passing the title to Robert Rühlmann in 2000.

Rühlmann&#x27;s contributions included releasing version 3.0, which included many monster and object changes contributed by Jonathan Ellis. He also introduced Lua, a lightweight scripting language, with the intention of simplifying development of both the main game and its variants. The &quot;Angband&quot; community, however, did not generally embrace the addition of scripting, with many expressing confusion over its usage, and was therefore later removed.

The original Moria/Angband software license allowed distribution of the game, but only does so if &quot;not for profit&quot;, which precludes packaging with many Linux distributions or inclusion within a magazine cover disc. The license also does not explicitly allow code modification, something which is in practice ignored by the &quot;Angband&quot; community. In light of these perceived issues, an initiative to re-license &quot;Angband&quot; was therefore started by maintainer Rühlmann in 2000. This &quot;Angband Open Source Initiative&quot; was designed to make &quot;Angband&quot; proper Open source under the GPL license. The process was completed on 9 January 2009.

Rühlmann stepped down in October 2005, leading to a brief period of uncertainty. Julian Lighton was later announced as the new maintainer in March 2006, but did not release a new version of the game. Due to the absence of Lighton, Andi Sidwell assumed maintainership, with the support of the community, in December 2007. Under their watch, other developers have come on board and the game has seen significant gameplay and internal code changes. Maintainership passed over to the current maintainer Nick McConnell, starting from version 4.0.0 (2015).

==Community==
Some loci of &quot;Angband&quot; discussion are the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.roguelike.angband, the Angband Forum website, and the IRC channels #angband (on WorldIRC) and #angband-dev (on Freenode). Some players continue to play &quot;Angband&quot; for several years.

==Derivative works==
Among &quot;Angband&quot;&#x27;s many derivatives are &quot;MAngband&quot; (1997), a multiplayer variant; &quot;Zangband&quot; (&quot;&quot;Zelazny&quot;+&quot;Angband&quot;&quot;) (1994), which incorporates elements of Roger Zelazny&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Amber&quot; novels; and &quot;Tales of Middle Earth&quot; (1998), a Tolkien-themed game developed from the &quot;ZAngband&quot; code base. &quot;Tales of Middle Earth&quot;&#x27;s source code and story were later rewritten, and the game became &quot;Tales of Maj&#x27;Eyal&quot; (2012).

==Legacy==
David Brevik cited &quot;Angband&quot;″s randomized levels and items as a &quot;huge influence&quot; on &quot;Diablo&quot; and &quot;the model of what we wanted&quot;.

Ernest Cline&#x27;s novel &quot;Ready Player Two&quot; features the dungeon from &quot;Angband&quot; and &quot;Morgoth&#x27;s crown&quot; as the location of one of the Seven Shards that the protagonists must collect.

<doc id="316481" wikidata="Q1030003" url="?curid=316481" title="Agonidae">
<text>Agonidae is a family of small, bottom-dwelling, cold-water marine fish. Common names for members of this family include poachers, Irish lords, sea ravens, alligatorfishes, starsnouts, hooknoses, and rockheads. They are notable for having elongated bodies covered by scales modified into bony plates, and for using their large pectoral fins to move in short bursts. The family includes about 59 species in some 25 genera, some of which are quite widespread.

The pelvic fins are nearly vestigial, typically consisting of one small spine and a few rays. The swim bladder is not present.

At in length, the dragon poacher (&quot;Percis japonica&quot;) is the largest member of the family, while &quot;Bothragonus occidentalis&quot; is long as an adult; most are in the 20–30 cm range.

Agonidae species generally feed on small crustaceans and marine worms found on the bottom. Some species camouflage themselves with hydras, sponges, or seaweed. They live at deep, with only a few species preferring shallower, coastal waters. All but one species are restricted to the Northern Hemisphere.

==Taxonomy==
The family Agonidae was first proposed as a family in 1839 by the English naturalist William Swainson. The Agonidae is classified within the superfamily Cottoidea in the suborder Cottoidei in the order Scorpaeniformes in the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; but other authorities states that if Scorpaeniformes is excluded from Perciformes then Perciformes is recovered as paraphyletic and so classify this family within the infraorder Cottales within the suborder Cottoidei of the Perciformes. A number of taxa which were previously classified within the Cottidae were reclassified within the Agonidae which meant that the Cottidae was confined to the freshwater sculpins.

==Subfamilies and genera==
The Agonidae is divided into the following subfamilies and genera:
* Hemilepidontinae 
** &quot;Hemilepidotus&quot; 
* Hemitripterinae 
** &quot;Blepsias&quot; 
** &quot;Hemitripterus&quot; 
** &quot;Nautichthys&quot; 
* Bothragoninae 
** &quot;Bothragonus&quot;

** &quot;Agonomalus&quot; 
** &quot;Hypsagonus&quot; 
** &quot;Percis&quot; 
* Anoplagoninae 
** &quot;Anoplagonus&quot; 
** &quot;Aspidophoroides&quot; 
* Brachyopsinae 
** &quot;Brachyopsis&quot; 
** &quot;Chesnonia&quot; 
** &quot;Occella&quot; 
** &quot;Pallasina&quot; 
** &quot;Stellerina&quot; 
** &quot;Tilesina&quot; 
* Agoninae 
** &quot;Agonopsis&quot; 
** &quot;Agonus&quot; 
** &quot;Freemanichthys&quot; 
** &quot;Leptagonus&quot; 
** &quot;Podothecus&quot;

<text>The Lakewood Church Central Campus is the main facility of Lakewood Church, a non-denominational evangelical Christian megachurch in Houston, Texas, five miles southwest of Downtown Houston and next to Greenway Plaza.

From 1975 to 2003, the building served as a multi-purpose sports arena for professional teams, notably the NBA&#x27;s Houston Rockets. It was known as The Summit until 1998, when technology firm Compaq bought naming rights and dubbed it Compaq Center. That name was dropped when Toyota Center opened as a new and more advanced professional sports venue in the same city, and the building was leased to Lakewood Church. Seven years later, in 2010, the church bought the building outright.

==Construction of The Summit==

In 1971, the National Basketball Association&#x27;s San Diego Rockets were purchased by new ownership group Texas Sports Investments, who moved the franchise to Houston. The city, however, lacked an indoor arena suitable to host a major sports franchise. The largest arena in the city at the time was 34-year-old Sam Houston Coliseum, but the Rockets would not even consider using it as a temporary facility. Plans were immediately undertaken to construct the new venue that would become The Summit. The Rockets played their home games in various local facilities such as Hofheinz Pavilion and the Astrodome during the interim.

Completed in 1975 at a cost of $18 million, there was an Opening Night Spectacular called &quot;Heart To Heart&quot;, benefitting the Baylor College of Medicine, The Methodist Hospital, and the Texas Heart Institute. Andy Williams was the headliner for that evening&#x27;s extravaganza. The Summit represented a lavish new breed of sports arena, replete with amenities, that would help the NBA grow from a second-tier professional sport into the multibillion-dollar entertainment industry that it is today. The Omni in Atlanta (now the site of State Farm Arena), McNichols Sports Arena in Denver (now a parking lot for Empower Field at Mile High), and the Richfield Coliseum in Richfield, Ohio (now an open meadow in the process of being reclaimed by forest) were all constructed during this period and remained in service until the continued growth of the NBA sparked a new arena construction boom in the late 1990s.

On each end of the arena was a Fair-Play scoreboard with a small two-line monochrome message center. Both scoreboards would be upgraded in 1986 with the addition of three front-projection videoboards on top of each scoreboard. The center videoboard showed live game footage, fan shots, and replays while the left and right videoboards showed slides displaying advertisements for the Rockets&#x27; (and Aeros&#x27;) sponsors.

==Notable events==
===Sports===
The Summit housed the NBA&#x27;s Rockets, the now defunct WHA/IHL/AHL Aeros, the now also defunct WNBA Comets, a several now defunct arena football and Indoor soccer sports teams until they vacated the arena in favor of the new Toyota Center in downtown Houston. Additionally, the arena was a prime Houston venue for popular music concerts and special events such as Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, the Harlem Globetrotters, Sesame Street Live and Disney on Ice.

The NBA Finals were hosted by The Summit in 1981, 1986, 1994, and 1995, including the deciding games of 1994 and 1995, and the celebrations that followed. The Summit also hosted the WNBA championships of 1997 through 2000, all of which were won by the Houston Comets.

The first professional wrestling event at the Summit was promoted by Houston Wrestling on May 29, 1977, headlined by the American Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Champion Nick Bockwinkel drawing Terry Funk. On January 7, 1979, Dusty Rhodes won the NWA Texas Brass Knuckles Championship from Mark Lewin. The World Wrestling Federation aired the first TV card from the venue on October 19, 1986, featuring Hulk Hogan defending his title against Paul Orndorff and a $50,000 tag team battle royal. It held the Royal Rumble on January 15, 1989. This was the first time the Royal Rumble, won by Big John Studd, was televised on pay-per-view (PPV). The newly renamed Compaq Center hosted the No Way Out of Texas PPV on February 15, 1998, and Bad Blood (the first brand-exclusive PPV held in the United States) on June 15, 2003. It hosted a live episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; on September 13, 2001, the first major entertainment event in the US after the September 11 attacks.

===Notable concerts===
Prior to the construction of Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion and later, the Toyota Center, the Summit was the main Houston venue for large pop and rock music concerts. Before the Summit was opened, most large venue concerts were held at the Sam Houston Coliseum. Smaller concerts were held at Houston Music Hall or Hofheinz Pavilion.
==From vacancy to church==

In 1998, it became the first Houston sports arena to sell its naming rights. The Arena Operating Company entered into a five-year, $900,000 per year deal with then Houston-based Compaq Computer Corporation to change the name of the venue from The Summit to Compaq Center, keeping that name even after the acquisition of Compaq by Hewlett-Packard in 2002 (there was another arena named the Compaq Center in San Jose, California around this time, but has since been renamed the SAP Center). The length of the agreement was significant, because in 2003 the lease that Arena Operating Company held on Compaq Center would expire, and the tenants of the building were lobbying vigorously for the construction of a new downtown venue to replace the aging and undersized arena.

When the sports teams moved to the new Toyota Center in 2003, the City of Houston leased the arena to Lakewood Church, a megachurch, which invested $95 million in renovations to convert the arena into the current configuration of seats and rooms for its needs; the renovations took over 15 months to complete, and the renovations included adding five stories to add more capacity. During the lease, Lakewood Church had an exclusive agreement with the City of Houston for use of the former Summit, and as such, invested heavily in the structure for its use. In 2001, the church signed a 30-year lease with the city.

In March 2010, the church announced that it would buy the campus outright from the city of Houston for $7.5 million, terminating the lease after 7 years. Marty Aaron, a real estate appraiser, said that although an &quot;untrained eye&quot; would &quot;wonder how Lakewood Church purchased the Compaq Center for $7.5 million, [actually] this is not really an arms-length sale from the city to Lakewood Church.&quot; Aaron explained that the church &quot;put a phenomenal amount of money into the facility after the lease was initially structured, and it&#x27;s really not fair that someone else would get the benefit of that.&quot; Aaron added that converting the property to a stadium-oriented facility &quot;would probably cost as much or more than it took to turn it into a church, and right now there are probably not very many organizations that would be willing to step forward and do that.&quot; The Houston City Council was scheduled to vote on the matter on Wednesday March 24, 2010. City council delayed the vote. On March 30 of that year, Ronald Green, the city&#x27;s chief financial officer, said that he approved of the sale of the building. On March 31, 2010, the Houston City Council voted 13–2 to sell the property to Lakewood.

<text>Kanyakumari (Tamil; /kəɳjɑkʊmɑɾiː/; referring to Devi Kanya Kumari, officially known as Kanniyakumari, formerly known as Cape Comorin) is a town and a second grade municipality in Kanyakumari district in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is the southernmost tip of the contiguous Indian subcontinent and the southernmost city in mainland India, and thus it is informally referred to as &quot;The Land&#x27;s End&quot;. The city is situated south of Thiruvananthapuram city, and about south of Nagercoil, the headquarters of Kanyakumari district.

Kanyakumari is a popular tourist destination and pilgrimage centre in India. Notable tourist spots include its unique sunrise and sunset points, the &quot;Thiruvalluvar Statue&quot;, and Vivekananda Rock Memorial off the coast. Lying at the tip of peninsular India, the town is bordered on the west, south, and east by the Laccadive Sea. It has a coastline of stretched along these three sides.

On the shores of the city is a temple dedicated to the goddess Kanya Kumari (the unmarried goddess), after which the town is named. Kanyakumari has been a town since the Sangam period and was referred to in old Malayalam literature and in the accounts of Ptolemy and Marco Polo.

==History==
===Etymology===
The place derives its name from the goddess Kanya Kumari, considered to be the sister of Krishna. The goddess is believed to remove the rigidity from the mind, and women pray for marriage at her temple. In 1656, the Dutch East India Company conquered Portuguese Ceylon from the Portuguese East Indies, and the name eventually corrupted to &quot;Comorin&quot; and was called &quot;Cape Comorin&quot; during British rule in India. In 2016, the town and its district were renamed to &quot;Kanniyakumari&quot; by the Government of India and the Government of Madras.

===Legend ===
According to a Hindu legend, Kanya Devi, an avatar of Parvati, was to marry Shiva, who failed to show up on his wedding day. Rice and other grains meant for the wedding feast remained uncooked and unused. The uncooked grains turned into stones as time went by. Some believe that the small stones on the shore today, which look like rice, are indeed grains from the wedding that was never solemnised. Kanya Devi is now considered a virgin goddess who blesses pilgrims and tourists who flock to the town. Her temple in Kanyakumari is a Shakta pitha: a holy shrine in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism.

According to another Hindu legend, Hanuman dropped a piece of earth near Kanyakumari as he was carrying a mountain with his life-saving herb, Mrita Sanjivani, from the Himalayas to Lanka (Sri Lanka) during the Ramayana War. The fallen earth formed an area called Marunthuvazh Malai, literally &quot;hills where medicine lives&quot;. This legend explains the abundance of unique native medicinal plants in the area. Marunthuvazh Malai is located near Kottaram, about from Kanyakumari town on the Kanyakumari–Nagercoil highway. The sage Agasthya, who was an expert in medicinal herbs, is believed to have lived around this site in ancient days. There is an ashram on the middle of the hillside; tourists trek up to visit the ashram and to glimpse the sea near Kanyakumari town, a few kilometres away.

==Demographics==
As per the 2011 Census, Kanyakumari town consisted of 61.16% Christians, 32.97% Hindus, and 5.47% Muslims. It had a population of 19,739, comprising 9,884 males and 9,855 females, making the sex ratio (number of females per thousand males) of the town 997. A total of 2,403 people were under six years of age and the child sex ratio (number of females per thousand males under six years of age) stood at 1,024. The town had an average literacy of 88.62%, higher than the national average of 59.5%. There were a total of 4,236 households in the town.

Kanyakumari is at the southern tip and is the southernmost point of the contiguous Indian Subcontinent. As such, it is part of the common Hindustani phrase used to describe the length of India: &quot;Kashmir se Kanyakumari&quot;; before the partition, the phrase in undivided India was &quot;Khyber se Kanyakumari&quot;. However, the southernmost point of Republic of India is at Indira Point on Great Nicobar Island, at 6°45’10″N and 93°49’36″E.

===Climate===

The climate is a hot semi arid climate, bordering on a tropical savanna climate, influenced by monsoons.

==Notable landmarks==

The Thiruvalluvar Statue is a 7,000-ton stone statue of poet and philosopher Valluvar. It has a height of and stands upon an rock that represents the 38 chapters of virtue in the &quot;Thirukkural&quot;. The statue standing on the rock represents wealth and pleasures, signifying that wealth and love be earned and enjoyed on the foundation of solid virtue. The combined height of the statue and pedestal is , denoting the 133 chapters in the &quot;Thirukkural&quot;.

The statue is reminiscent of a dancing pose of Nataraja. It was sculpted by the Indian sculptor V. Ganapati Sthapati, who also created the Iraivan Temple, and its opening ceremony was on 1 January 2000. The monument was hit by the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2004, but stood unaffected. The statue is designed to survive earthquakes of high magnitude. During maintenance work, as well as during rough sea, entry is restricted for tourists.

===Vivekananda Rock Memorial===

The Vivekananda Rock Memorial is a popular tourist monument in Vavathurai, Kanyakumari, India. The memorial stands on one of two rocks in the Laccadive Sea, located about east of the mainland of Vavathurai. It was built in 1970 in honour of Swami Vivekananda who is said to have attained enlightenment on the rock. According to local legends, it was on this rock that Goddess Kumari performed austerity. A meditation hall (Dhyana Mandapam) is also attached to the memorial for visitors to meditate. The design of the mandapa incorporates different styles of temple architecture from all over India. It houses a statue of Vivekananda. The memorial consists of two main structures: the Vivekananda Mandapam and the Shripada Mandapam.

===Bhagavathy Amman Temple===

It is mentioned in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, and &quot;Purananuru&quot;.
===Gandhi Memorial Mandapam===

The Gandhi Memorial Mandapam has been built on the spot where the urn containing the Mahatma&#x27;s ashes was kept for public viewing before immersion. Resembling central Indian Hindu temples in form,the memorial was designed such that on Gandhi&#x27;s birthday, 2 October, the first rays of the sun fall on the exact place where his ashes were kept.

Kamarajar Mani Mantapa Monument was raised and dedicated to K. Kamarajar, a freedom fighter, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, and President of Indian National Congress. He is also popularly known as &quot;Black Gandhi&quot; among the masses. Like the Gandhi Memorial Mandapam, this monument is where Kamarajar&#x27;s ashes were kept for the public to pay homage before immersion into the sea.

===Tsunami Memorial Park===

Near Kanyakumari&#x27;s southern shore stands a monument to the memory of those who died in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, an underwater megathrust earthquake that claimed around 230,000 lives in many countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Somalia, Thailand, Maldives, and Indonesia.

<doc id="316497" wikidata="Q1514276" url="?curid=316497" title="Virtual Storage Access Method">
<text>Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) is an IBM direct-access storage device (DASD) file storage access method, first used in the OS/VS1, OS/VS2 Release 1 (SVS) and Release 2 (MVS) operating systems, later used throughout the Multiple Virtual Storage (MVS) architecture and now in z/OS. Originally a record-oriented filesystem, VSAM comprises four data set &quot;organizations&quot;: key-sequenced (KSDS), relative record (RRDS), entry-sequenced (ESDS) and linear (LDS). The KSDS, RRDS and ESDS organizations contain records, while the LDS organization (added later to VSAM) contains a sequence of pages with no intrinsic record structure, for use as a memory-mapped file.

==Overview==
An IBM &quot;Redbook&quot; named &quot;VSAM PRIMER&quot; (especially when used with the &quot;Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) Options for Advanced Applications&quot; manual) explains the concepts needed to make use of VSAM. IBM uses the term &quot;data set&quot; in official documentation as a synonym for &quot;file&quot;, and &quot;direct-access storage device&quot; (&quot;DASD&quot;) for devices with random access to data locations, such as disk drives, as opposed to devices such as tape drives that can only be read sequentially.

VSAM records can be of fixed or variable length. They are organised in fixed-size blocks called control intervals (CIs), and then into larger divisions called Control Areas (CAs). Control Interval sizes are measured in bytes for example 4 kilobytes while Control Area sizes are measured in disk tracks or cylinders. Control Intervals are the units of transfer between disk and computer so a read request will read one complete Control Interval. Control Areas are the units of allocation so, when a VSAM data set is defined, an integral number of Control Areas will be allocated.

The Access Method Services utility program IDCAMS is commonly used to manipulate (&quot;delete and define&quot;) VSAM data sets. Custom programs can access VSAM datasets through Data Definition (DD) statements in Job Control Language (JCL), via dynamic allocation or in online regions such as in Customer Information Control System (CICS).

Both IMS/DB and Db2 are implemented on top of VSAM and use its underlying data structures.

==Files==
The physical organization of VSAM data sets differs considerably from the organizations used by other access methods, as follows.

A VSAM file is defined as a cluster of VSAM components, e.g., for KSDS a DATA component and an INDEX component.

===Control intervals and control areas===
VSAM components consist of fixed length physical blocks grouped into fixed length control intervals (CI) and control areas (CA). The size of the CI and CA is determined by the Access Method Services (AMS), and the way in which they are used is normally not visible to the user. There will be a fixed number of control intervals in each control area.

A control interval normally contains multiple records. The records are stored within the control interval starting from the low address upwards. Control information is stored at the other end of the control interval, starting from the high address and moving downwards. The space between the records and the control information is free space. The control information comprises two types of entry: a control interval descriptor field (CIDF) which is always present, and record descriptor fields (RDF) which are present when there are records within the control interval and describe the length of the associated record. Free space within a CI is always contiguous.

When records are inserted into a control interval, they are placed in the correct order relative to other records. This may require records to be moved out of the way inside the control interval. Conversely, when a record is deleted, later records are moved down so that the free space remains contiguous. If there is not enough free space in a control interval for a record to be inserted, the control interval is split. Roughly half the records are stored in the original control interval while the remaining records are moved into a new control interval. The new control interval is taken from a pool of free control intervals within the same control area as the original control interval. If there is no remaining free control interval within that control area, the control area itself is split and the control intervals are distributed equally between the old and the new control areas.

You can use three types of record-orientated file organization with VSAM (the contents of linear data sets have no record structure):

===Sequential organization===
An ESDS may have an index defined to it to enable access via keys, by defining an Alternate Index. Records in ESDS are stored in order in which they are written by address access. Records are loaded irrespective of their contents and their byte addresses cannot be changed.

===Indexed organization===

A KSDS has two parts: the index component and the data component. These may be stored on separate disk volumes.

While a basic KSDS only has one key (the primary key), alternate indices may be defined to permit the use of additional fields as secondary keys. An alternate index (AIX) is itself a KSDS.

The data structure used by a KSDS is nowadays known as a B+ tree.

===Relative organization===
An RRDS may have an index defined to it to enable access via keys, by defining an Alternate Index.

=== Linear organization ===

An LDS is an unstructured VSAM dataset with a control interval size of a multiple of 4K. It is used by certain system services.

== Data access techniques ==
There are four types of access techniques for VSAM data:

* Local Shared Resources (LSR), is optimised for &quot;random&quot; or direct access. LSR access is easy to achieve from CICS.
* Global Shared Resources (GSR)
* Non-Shared Resources (NSR), which is optimised for sequential access. NSR access has historically been easier to use than LSR for batch programs.
* Distributed File Management (DFM), an implementation of a Distributed Data Management Architecture server, enables programs on remote computers to create, manage, and access VSAM files.

==Sharing data==
Sharing of VSAM data between CICS regions can be done by VSAM Record-Level Sharing (RLS). This adds record caching and, more importantly, record locking. Logging and commit processing remain the responsibility of CICS which means that sharing of VSAM data outside a CICS environment is severely restricted.

Sharing between CICS regions and batch jobs requires Transactional VSAM, DFSMStvs. This is an optional program that builds on VSAM RLS by adding logging and two-phase commit, using underlying z/OS system services. This permits generalised sharing of VSAM data.

==History==
VSAM was introduced as a replacement for older access methods and was intended to add function, to be easier to use and to overcome problems of performance and device-dependence. VSAM was introduced in the 1970s when IBM announced virtual storage operating systems (DOS/VS, OS/VS1 and OS/VS2) for its new System/370 series, as successors of the DOS/360 and OS/360 operating systems running on its System/360 computer series. While backwards compatibility was maintained, the older access methods suffered from performance problems due to the address translation required for virtual storage.

The KSDS organization was designed to replace ISAM, the Indexed Sequential Access Method. Changes in disk technology had meant that searching for data in ISAM data sets had become very inefficient. It was also difficult to move ISAM data sets as there were embedded pointers to physical disk locations which became invalid if the data set was moved. IBM also provided a compatibility interface to allow programs coded to use ISAM to use a KSDS instead.

The RRDS organization was designed to replace BDAM, the Basic Direct Access Method. In some cases, BDAM data sets contained embedded pointers which prevented them from being moved. However, most BDAM data sets did not and the incentive to move from BDAM to VSAM RRDS was much less compelling than that to move from ISAM to VSAM KSDS.

Linear data sets were added later, followed by VSAM RLS and then Transactional VSAM.

<text>Dandridge McRae (October 10, 1829 – April 23, 1899) was an American lawyer, court official, and Inspector General of Arkansas State Troops, as well as a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He served in several key battles that helped secure Arkansas for the Confederacy, prolonging the war in the Western Theater.

==Biography==
Dandridge McRae was born in Baldwin County, Alabama, the son of Margaret (Bracy) and D. R. W. McRae. He graduated in 1849 from South Carolina College, where he was a member of the Euphradian Society and the Corps of Cadets. McRae moved to Searcy in White County, Arkansas. He was admitted to the bar and served as clerk of the county and circuit courts for six years.

McRae began his military service in Arkansas on September 12, 1860, when he was elected captain of the &quot;Arkansas Guards&quot;, an element of the 21st Regiment of the Arkansas militia, headquartered in White County. He led this company as part of the militia forces that seized the Federal Arsenal at Little Rock in early February 1861. After the arsenal seizure, McRae returned to White County and organized a volunteer cavalry troop, the &quot;Border Rangers&quot;, in Searcy, Arkansas, in April 1861, where he was elected and served as captain. McRae had also been appointed by Governor Henry Massey Rector to serve as the inspector general of the new Arkansas State Troops. McRae was first sent to Camp Rector at Hopefield, (near modern-day West Memphis, Arkansas) to begin the mustering in of troops. During this time McRae is occasionally referenced by other militia commanders as General McRae, probably in connection with his role as inspector general. McRae left Hopefield shortly after the Arkansas State secession convention dispatched a political general, Thomas H. Bradley of Crittenden County, to assume command. McRae was next dispatched to Northwest Arkansas to assist Brigadier General Nicholas Bartlett Pearce in the mustering of Arkansas State Troops in the Western Division of the Provisional Army of Arkansas.

McRae was elected as lieutenant colonel in command of the 3rd Arkansas Infantry Battalion on 15 July 1861. He led his battalion in action at the Battle of Wilson’s Creek, Missouri, on 10 August 1861 and was commended for his coolness under fire and his leadership of his soldiers. In December 1861 Colonel McRae’s battalion was augmented with additional volunteer infantry companies and reorganized into the 15th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, and he was promoted to colonel. The regiment was transferred to Missouri under the command of the Army of the West, but, shortly after the transfer, Colonel McRae was granted a transfer back to his adopted state to take command of the then forming 28th Arkansas Infantry Regiment.

McRae took part in the Battle of Pea Ridge in March 1862 and received commendations from his commander, Earl Van Dorn. McRae remained in Arkansas while most troops were moved eastward across the Mississippi River and participated in operations there. On November 5, 1862, he was commissioned as a brigadier general.

In 1863, McRae and his command took part in the Battle of Helena in a failed effort to secure that river port for the Confederacy. After the battle there were many accusations as to the causes for the failure of the attack. Two officers were brought up on formal charges of misbehavior before the enemy. Most notably, Brigadier General McRae was accused by Brigadier General Fagan of willful failure to provide assistance during the attack on the Graveyard Hill. On 29 December 1864 a court of inquiry found that Brigadier General McRae was not guilty of any misconduct before the enemy, by order of General E. Kirby Smith.

During the Camden Expedition of the 1864 Red River Campaign, McRae&#x27;s brigade formed part of the force under General Sterling Price. They participated in the Battle of Marks&#x27; Mills and the Battle of Jenkins&#x27; Ferry, forcing the Union forces out of southern Arkansas and back to Little Rock. McRae then led his brigade in battles in northern Arkansas and in Missouri later that year until he resigned his commission.

After leaving the service, McRae returned to Searcy and took up the practice of law. Along with future three-term Arkansas Secretary of State Jacob Frolich, McRae headed the White County chapter of the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction. Both Frolich and McRae were part of a group of men indicted for the 1868 murder of Albert Parker, an agent of Gov. Powell Clayton sent to investigate KKK activity in White County. Though the charges were ultimately dropped, both men fled Searcy upon warrants being issued for their arrest. McRae took shelter with a friend in neighboring Woodruff County, while Frolich fled to Canada. In 1881, McRae was elected as the deputy secretary of state, serving under Secretary of State Jacob Frolich. He focused his post-war activities on promoting the commercial interests of the State of Arkansas. He was a delegate to various commercial expositions and served as president of the bureau of information for Arkansas.

After suffering a stroke in 1897, McRae began to decline physically. He died on April 23, 1899, at Searcy, Arkansas, where he is buried.

<text>The flag of Qatar () is in the ratio of 11:28. It is maroon with a broad white serrated band (nine white points) on the hoist side. It was adopted shortly before the country declared independence from the United Kingdom on 3 September 1971.

The flag is similar to the flag of Bahrain, which has fewer points, a 3:5 proportion, and a red colour instead of maroon. Qatar&#x27;s flag is the only national flag having a width more than twice its height.

==History==
Qatar&#x27;s historic flag was plain red, in correspondence with the red banner traditionally used by the Kharjite leader Qatari ibn al-Fuja&#x27;a. In the 19th century, the country modified its entirely red flag with the addition of a white vertical stripe at the hoist to suit the British directive. After this addition, Sheikh Mohammed bin Thani officially adopted a patterned purple-red and white flag which bore a strong resemblance to its modern derivative. Several additions were made to the Qatari flag in 1932, with the nine-pointed serrated edge, diamonds, and the word &quot;Qatar&quot; being integrated into its design. The maroon colour was standardised in 1936. In the 1960s, Sheikh Ali Al Thani removed the wording and diamonds from the flag. The flag was officially adopted on 9 July 1971 and was virtually identical to the 1960s flag, except the height-to-width proportion.

==Characteristics==
===Design influence from the national flag===
The outer ring of the emblem is essentially the flag of Qatar. This design was changed multiple times throughout Qatar&#x27;s history, and has been the same since 1960, when the final change happened under the rule of Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani. This followed with the US recognition of Qatar&#x27;s independence in 1971. Qatar became such a large producer of this dye that it was referred to in the Middle East as “Qatari maroon”. This same maroon is used in the emblem for the outer halo, dhow, and palm trees. 

The flag of Qatar has nine points at the separation point between the white and maroon, and the emblem employs these nine points on each side of the outer halo. These nine points signify Qatar&#x27;s introduction as the 9th member of the “Reconciled Emirates” in the wake of the Qatari-British treaty of 1916. From 1972 to 2002, Bahrain&#x27;s flag had eight points and visually resembled the flag of Qatar, however Bahrain later changed theirs to have five points rather than eight, to symbolise the five pillars of Islam. The original flag further resembled a shade of red, and the inclusion of the white stripe is believed to be a British directive during the time of the protectorate.

===Pattern===
Nine serrated edges separate the coloured and white portions. They signify Qatar&#x27;s inclusion as the ninth member state of the Emirates of Trucial Oman after Bahrain, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Fujairah, Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Quwain at the conclusion of the Qatari-British treaty in 1916.

===Colour===
In 2012, the Qatari government defined the exact shade of the Qatari flag as Pantone 1955 C, or &#x27;Qatar maroon&#x27;. The history of purple dye in the country dates back several centuries. It has been asserted that Qatar was the site of the earliest known production of shellfish dye during the rule of the Kassites due to the presence of a purple dye industry on Al Khor Islands. Qatar was also known for its production of purple dye during the rule of the Sasanian Empire. Mohammed bin Thani, who ruled from 1847 to 1876, proposed the creation of a flag with a purple-red colour in order to unify the state, and to highlight its historic role in the production of dye. In 1932, the British Navy suggested an official flag should be designed. According to the Qatari government, the British proposed that the flag be white and red, but Qatar rejected the red colouring and continued using a mixture of purple and red instead. According to letters from the British political agent in the Persian Gulf to British India, the white cloth was purchased in Bahrain and was originally dyed red locally. The locally purchased dye was of poor quality that faded rapidly, causing the flag to take a chocolate colour. Due to the country&#x27;s subtropical desert climate, the flag&#x27;s colours were prone to be tinted darker by the sun, which resulted in the eventual adoption of a maroon colouring in 1936. The white portion of the flag symbolises the peace procured from signing anti-piracy treaties with the British.

<doc id="316522" wikidata="Q899507" url="?curid=316522" title="Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase">
<text>The enzyme fructose bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11; systematic name -fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphohydrolase) catalyses the conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate in gluconeogenesis and the Calvin cycle, which are both anabolic pathways:

:-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate + H2O = -fructose 6-phosphate + phosphate

Phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) catalyses the reverse conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, but this is not just the reverse reaction, because the co-substrates are different (and so thermodynamic requirements are not violated). The two enzymes each catalyse the conversion in one direction only, and are regulated by metabolites such as fructose 2,6-bisphosphate so that high activity of one of them is accompanied by low activity of the other. More specifically, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate allosterically inhibits fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, but activates phosphofructokinase-I. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is involved in many different metabolic pathways and found in most organisms. FBPase requires metal ions for catalysis (Mg2+ and Mn2+ being preferred) and the enzyme is potently inhibited by Li+.

== Structure ==

The fold of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase from pigs was noted to be identical to that of inositol-1-phosphatase (IMPase). Inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (IPPase), IMPase and FBPase share a sequence motif (Asp-Pro-Ile/Leu-Asp-Gly/Ser-Thr/Ser) which has been shown to bind metal ions and participate in catalysis. This motif is also found in the distantly-related fungal, bacterial and yeast IMPase homologues. It has been suggested that these proteins define an ancient structurally conserved family involved in diverse metabolic pathways, including inositol signalling, gluconeogenesis, sulphate assimilation and possibly quinone metabolism.

== Species distribution ==

Three different groups of FBPases have been identified in eukaryotes and bacteria (FBPase I-III). None of these groups have been found in Archaea so far, though a new group of FBPases (FBPase IV) which also show inositol monophosphatase activity has recently been identified in Archaea.

A new group of FBPases (FBPase V) is found in thermophilic archaea and the hyperthermophilic bacterium &quot;Aquifex aeolicus&quot;. The characterised members of this group show strict substrate specificity for FBP and are suggested to be the true FBPase in these organisms. A structural study suggests that FBPase V has a novel fold for a sugar phosphatase, forming a four-layer alpha-beta-beta-alpha sandwich, unlike the more usual five-layered alpha-beta-alpha-beta-alpha arrangement. The arrangement of the catalytic side chains and metal ligands was found to be consistent with the three-metal ion assisted catalysis mechanism proposed for other FBPases.

The fructose 1,6-bisphosphatases found within the &quot;Bacillota&quot; (low GC Gram-positive bacteria) do not show any significant sequence similarity to the enzymes from other organisms. The &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; enzyme is inhibited by AMP, though this can be overcome by phosphoenolpyruvate, and is dependent on Mn(2+). Mutants lacking this enzyme are apparently still able to grow on gluconeogenic growth substrates such as malate and glycerol.

==Interactive pathway map==
==Hibernation and cold adaptation==

Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase also plays a key role in hibernation, which requires strict regulation of metabolic processes to facilitate entry into hibernation, maintenance, arousal from hibernation, and adjustments to allow long-term dormancy. During hibernation, an animal&#x27;s metabolic rate may decrease to around 1/25 of its euthermic resting metabolic rate. FBPase is modified in hibernating animals to be much more temperature sensitive than it is in euthermic animals. FBPase in the liver of a hibernating bat showed a 75% decrease in Km for its substrate FBP at 5 °C than at 37 °C. However, in a euthermic bat this decrease was only 25%, demonstrating the difference in temperature sensitivity between hibernating and euthermic bats. When sensitivity to allosteric inhibitors such as AMP, ADP, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate were examined, FBPase from hibernating bats was much more sensitive to inhibitors at low temperature than in euthermic bats.

During hibernation, respiration also dramatically decreases, resulting in conditions of relative anoxia in the tissues. Anoxic conditions inhibit gluconeogenesis, and therefore FBPase, while stimulating glycolysis, and this is another reason for reduced FBPase activity in hibernating animals. The substrate of FBPase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, has also been shown to activate pyruvate kinase in glycolysis, linking increased glycolysis to decreased gluconeogenesis when FBPase activity is decreased during hibernation.

In addition to hibernation, there is evidence that FBPase activity varies significantly between warm and cold seasons even for animals that do not hibernate.
In rabbits exposed to cold temperatures, FBPase activity decreased throughout the duration of cold exposure, increasing when temperatures became warmer again. The mechanism of this FBPase inhibition is thought to be digestion of FBPase by lysosomal proteases, which are released at higher levels during colder periods. Inhibition of FBPase through proteolytic digestion decreases gluconeogenesis relative to glycolysis during cold periods, similar to hibernation.

Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase is another temperature dependent enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis during hibernation. Its main role is in glycolysis instead of gluconeogenesis, but its substrate is the same as FBPase&#x27;s, so its activity affects that of FBPase in gluconeogenesis. Aldolase shows similar changes in activity to FBPase at colder temperatures, such as an upward shift in optimum pH at colder temperatures. This adaptation allows enzymes such as FBPase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase to track intracellular pH changes in hibernating animals and match their activity ranges to these shifts. Aldolase also complements the activity of FBPase in anoxic conditions (discussed above) by increasing glycolytic output while FBPase inhibition decreases gluconeogenesis activity.

==Diabetes==
Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is also a key player in treating type 2 diabetes. In this disease, hyperglycemia causes many serious problems, and treatments often focus on lowering blood sugar levels. Gluconeogenesis in the liver is a major cause of glucose overproduction in these patients, and so inhibition of gluconeogenesis is a reasonable way to treat type 2 diabetes. FBPase is a good enzyme to target in the gluconeogenesis pathway because it is rate-limiting and controls the incorporation of all three-carbon substrates into glucose but is not involved in glycogen breakdown and is removed from mitochondrial steps in the pathway. This means that altering its activity can have a large effect on gluconeogenesis while reducing the risk of hypoglycemia and other potential side effects from altering other enzymes in gluconeogenesis.

Drug candidates have been developed that mimic the inhibitory activity of AMP on FBPase. Efforts were made to mimic the allosteric inhibitory effects of AMP while making the drug as structurally different from it as possible. Second-generation FBPase inhibitors have now been developed and have had good results in clinical trials with non-human mammals and now humans.

<text>In fructose bisphosphatase deficiency, there is not enough fructose bisphosphatase for gluconeogenesis to occur correctly. Glycolysis (the breakdown of glucose) will still work, as it does not use this enzyme.

==History==
The first known description of a patient with this condition was published in 1970 in &quot;The Lancet&quot; journal.

Early research into the disorder was conducted by a team led by Anthony S. Pagliara and Barbara Illingworth Brown at Washington University Medical Center, based on the case of an infant girl from Oak Ridge, Missouri.

==Presentation==
Without effective gluconeogenesis (GNG), hypoglycaemia will set in after about 12 hours of fasting. This is the time when liver glycogen stores have been exhausted, and the body has to rely on GNG. When given a dose of glucagon (which would normally increase blood glucose) nothing will happen, as stores are depleted and GNG doesn&#x27;t work. (In fact, the patient would already have high glucagon levels.)

There is no problem with the metabolism of glucose or galactose, but fructose and glycerol cannot be used by the liver to maintain blood glucose levels. If fructose or glycerol are given, there will be a buildup of phosphorylated three-carbon sugars. This leads to phosphate depletion within the cells, and also in the blood. Without phosphate, ATP cannot be made, and many cell processes cannot occur.

High levels of glucagon will tend to release fatty acids from adipose tissue, and this will combine with glycerol that cannot be used in the liver, to make triacylglycerides causing a fatty liver.

As three carbon molecules cannot be used to make glucose, they will instead be made into pyruvate and lactate. These acids cause a drop in the pH of the blood (a metabolic acidosis). Acetyl CoA (acetyl co-enzyme A) will also build up, leading to the creation of ketone bodies.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is made by measurement of FDPase in cultured lymphocytes and confirmed by detection of mutation of FBP1, encoding FDPase.

==Treatment==
To treat people with a deficiency of this enzyme, they must avoid needing gluconeogenesis to make glucose. This can be accomplished by not fasting for long periods, and eating high-carbohydrate food. They should avoid fructose containing foods (as well as sucrose which breaks down to fructose).

As with all single-gene metabolic disorders, there is always hope for genetic therapy, inserting a healthy copy of the gene into existing liver cells.

<text>Thallus (: thalli), from Latinized Greek (), meaning &quot;a green shoot&quot; or &quot;twig&quot;, is the vegetative tissue of some organisms in diverse groups such as algae, fungi, some liverworts, lichens, and the Myxogastria. A thallus usually names the entire body of a multicellular non-moving organism in which there is no organization of the tissues into organs. Many of these organisms were previously known as the thallophytes, a polyphyletic group of distantly related organisms. An organism or structure resembling a thallus is called thalloid, thalloidal, thalliform, thalline, or thallose.

Even though thalli do not have organized and distinct parts (leaves, roots, and stems) as do the vascular plants, they may have analogous structures that resemble their vascular &quot;equivalents&quot;. The analogous structures have similar function or macroscopic structure, but different microscopic structure; for example, no thallus has vascular tissue. In exceptional cases such as the Lemnoideae, where the structure of a vascular plant is in fact thallus-like, it is referred to as having a thalloid structure, or sometimes as a thalloid.

Although a thallus is largely undifferentiated in terms of its anatomy, there can be visible differences and functional differences. A kelp, for example, may have its thallus divided into three regions. The parts of a kelp thallus include the holdfast (anchor), stipe (supports the blades) and the blades (for photosynthesis).

The thallus of a fungus is usually called a mycelium. The term thallus is also commonly used to refer to the vegetative body of a lichen. In seaweed, thallus is sometimes also called &#x27;frond&#x27;.

The gametophyte of some non-thallophyte plants – clubmosses, horsetails, and ferns is termed &quot;prothallus&quot;.

<doc id="316531" wikidata="Q181279" url="?curid=316531" title="The Song of Australia">
<text>&quot;The Song of Australia&quot; was composed as the result of 1859 competition to create a &quot;patriotic song&quot;, sponsored by the Gawler Institute in Adelaide. The winning lyrics were written by an English-born poet, Caroline Carleton, and the music chosen by the judges was composed by the German-born Carl Linger (1810-1862), a prominent member of the Australian Forty-Eighters.

It was one of the options in the 1977 plebiscite to choose a new Australian National Anthem, in which it was preferred by South Australians, but lost in the other states to &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;.

==Contest==
On 1 October 1859, the &quot;South Australian Register&quot; announced:

A few weeks later, the judges announced the winner, and the second stage of the competition:

The winner was announced in early November:

==Lyrics==
This is the poem as published in The South Australian Register on 21 October 1859:

==Criticism==
Publication of Caroline Carleton&#x27;s poem caused immediate controversy, generally along the lines that it was nice poetry, but &quot;too tame&quot;. One person regretted that nothing more inspiring than the colour of the sky and the prettiness of the scenery could be found for the poem. Another wondered &quot;how hidden wealth could gleam in the darkness&quot;. Someone else complained that the poem could equally refer to, say, California, while another commentator longed for a time when such a peaceful song accorded with international politics, and regretted that the contest was restricted to South Australians, that the prize was so paltry, and there was no mention of sheep.

The &quot;Advertiser&quot; of 24 October, gave a spirited defence of the judges, and of Mrs. Carleton&#x27;s poem, culminating in several parodies purporting to be the &quot;real Song of Australia&quot;.

==Performances and public reaction==
One of its first public performances was by the Adelaide Liedertafel, conducted by Herr Linger, for a South Australian Institute soirée at White&#x27;s Rooms, King William Street, Adelaide, on 14 December 1859.

The song, played by orchestra and chorus under Professor Joshua Ives, was a feature of the opening ceremony of the Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition in 1887.

&quot;Song of Australia&quot; was a particular favourite of the Australian baritone Peter Dawson. who called it &quot;the finest national anthem ever written&quot;. His notable performances included:
*Recital in London as a duet with Richard Nitschke in 1905.
*Duet with Clara Serena at Wembley on (the then) Australia Day 24 July 1924.
*A gramophone recording His Master&#x27;s Voice EA1003 of Dawson and vocal quartet singing &quot;Song of Australia&quot; was released in 1932.

==Proposed national anthem==
In 1924, George Edwin Yates, the federal member for Adelaide, proposed in parliament that the song be adopted as the national anthem. He proceeded to sing the first verse, despite the objections of his fellow members.

The song was one of four included in a national plebiscite to choose Australia&#x27;s national song in 1977. Nationwide it was the least popular of the four choices, but it had the distinction of being the most popular choice in South Australia. This result can be attributed to the fact of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; being exposed to schoolchildren in the more populous States, where &quot;The Song of Australia&quot; was sung in schools only in South Australia and, to a lesser extent, in Western Australia and Tasmania.

The four songs in the plebiscite were &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;; the then anthem, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;; the now current anthem, &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;; and &quot;Song of Australia&quot;.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Song of Australia&quot; is featured in the TV series &quot;ANZAC Girls&quot;, episode 4, &quot;Love&quot;, in which the Peter Dawson recording is played on a wind-up gramophone in several scenes, and sung in snatches by &quot;Pat Dooley&quot; (Brandon McClelland) while digging a latrine pit.

<doc id="316532" wikidata="Q1312" url="?curid=316532" title="Spring (season)">
<text>Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding winter and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies according to local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. At the spring equinox, also called the vernal equinox, days and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with daytime length increasing and nighttime length decreasing as the season progresses until the summer solstice. The spring equinox is in March in the Northern Hemisphere and in September in the Southern Hemisphere, while the summer solstice is in June in the Northern Hemisphere and in December in the Southern Hemisphere.

Spring and &quot;springtime&quot; refer to the season, and also to ideas of rebirth, rejuvenation, renewal, resurrection and regrowth. Subtropical and tropical areas have climates better described in terms of other seasons, e.g. dry or wet, monsoonal or cyclonic. Cultures may have local names for seasons which have little equivalence to the terms originating in Europe.

==Etymology==
According to the &quot;Online Etymological Dictionary&quot;, &quot;spring&quot; in the sense of the season comes from phrases such as &quot;springing time&quot; (14th century) and &quot;the spring of the year&quot;. This use is from an archaic noun meaning &quot;act or time of springing or appearing; the first appearance; the beginning, birth, rise, or origin&quot;. Spring as a word in general appeared via the Middle English &quot;springen&quot;, via the Old English &quot;springan&quot;. These were verbs meaning to rise up or to burst forth, (see also the modern German &quot;springen&quot; &#x27;jump&#x27;) and are not believed to have originally related to the season. These all originate from Proto-Germanic *sprenganan.

==Meteorological reckoning==
Meteorologists generally define four seasons in many climatic areas: spring, summer, autumn (fall), and winter. These are determined by the values of their average temperatures on a monthly basis, with each season lasting three calendar months. The three warmest months are by definition summer, the three coldest months are winter, and the intervening gaps are spring and autumn. Meteorological spring can therefore, start on different dates in different regions.

In the United States and United Kingdom, spring months are March, April, and May.

In Ireland, following the Irish calendar, spring is often defined as February, March, and April.

In Sweden, meteorologists define the beginning of spring as the first occasion on which the average 24 hours temperature exceeds zero degrees Celsius for seven consecutive days, thus the date varies with latitude and elevation (but no earlier than 15 February, and no later than 31 July).

In Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Brazil the spring months are September, October, and November.

==Astronomical and solar reckoning==
In the Northern Hemisphere (with countries such as Germany, the United States, Canada, and the UK), solar reckoning was traditionally used with the solstices and equinoxes representing the midpoints of each season, however, the astronomical vernal equinox (varying between 19 and 21 March) can be taken to mark the first day of spring with the summer solstice (around 21 June) marked as first day of summer. By solar reckoning, Spring is held to begin 1 February until the first day of Summer on May Day, with the summer and winter solstices being marked as Midsummer and Midwinter respectively, instead of as the beginning of the season as is the case with astronomical reckoning. 

In Persian culture the first day of spring is the first day of the first month (called Farvardin) which begins on 20 or 21 March.

In the traditional Chinese calendar, the &quot;spring&quot; season () consists of the days between Lichun (3–5 February), taking Chunfen (20–22 March) as its midpoint, then ending at Lixia (5–7 May). Similarly, according to the Celtic tradition, which is based solely on daylight and the strength of the noon sun, spring begins in early February (near Imbolc or Candlemas) and continues until early May (Beltane), with Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day (17 March) being regarded as the middle day of spring. Late Roman Republic scholar Marcus Terentius Varro defined spring as lasting from the seventh day before the Ides of Februarius (7 February) to the eighth day before the Ides of Maius (8 May).

The spring season in India is culturally in the months of March and April, with an average temperature of approx 32 °C. Some people in India especially from Karnataka state celebrate their new year in spring, Ugadi.

==Ecological reckoning==
The beginning of spring is not always determined by fixed calendar dates. The phenological or ecological definition of spring relates to biological indicators, such as the blossoming of a range of plant species, the activities of animals, and the special smell of soil that has reached the temperature for micro flora to flourish. These indicators, along with the beginning of spring, vary according to the local climate and according to the specific weather of a particular year. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the National Trust runs the #BlossomWatch campaign, which encourages people to share images of blossom with one another, as an early indicator of the arrival of the season.

Some ecologists divide the year into six seasons. In addition to spring, ecological reckoning identifies an earlier separate prevernal (early or pre-spring) season between the hibernal (winter) and vernal (spring) seasons. This is a time when only the hardiest flowers like the crocus are in bloom, sometimes while there is still some snowcover on the ground.

==Natural events==
 


During early spring, the axis of the Earth is increasing its tilt relative to the Sun, and the length of daylight rapidly increases for the relevant hemisphere. The hemisphere begins to warm significantly, causing new plant growth to &quot;spring forth&quot;, giving the season its name.

Any snow begins to melt, swelling streams with runoff and any frosts become less severe. In climates that have no snow, and rare frosts, air and ground temperatures increase more rapidly.

Many flowering plants bloom at this time of year, in a long succession, sometimes beginning when snow is still on the ground and continuing into early summer. In normally snowless areas, &quot;spring&quot; may begin as early as February (Northern Hemisphere) or August (Southern Hemisphere), heralded by the blooming of deciduous magnolias, cherries, and quince. Many temperate areas have a dry spring, and wet autumn (fall), which brings about flowering in this season, more consistent with the need for water, as well as warmth. Subarctic areas may not experience &quot;spring&quot; at all until May.

While spring is a result of the warmth caused by the changing orientation of the Earth&#x27;s axis relative to the Sun, the weather in many parts of the world is affected by other, less predictable events. The rainfall in spring (or any season) follows trends more related to longer cycles—such as the solar cycle—or events created by ocean currents and ocean temperatures—for example, the El Niño effect and the Southern Oscillation Index.

Unstable spring weather may occur more often when warm air begins to invade from lower latitudes, while cold air is still pushing from the Polar regions. Flooding is also most common in and near mountainous areas during this time of year, because of snow-melt which is accelerated by warm rains. In North America, Tornado Alley is most active at this time of year, especially since the Rocky Mountains prevent the surging hot and cold air masses from spreading eastward, and instead force them into direct conflict. Besides tornadoes, supercell thunderstorms can also produce dangerously large hail and very high winds, for which a severe thunderstorm warning or tornado warning is usually issued. Even more so than in winter, the jet streams play an important role in unstable and severe Northern Hemisphere weather in springtime.

In recent decades, season creep has been observed, which means that many phenological signs of spring are occurring earlier in many regions by around two days per decade.

Spring in the Southern Hemisphere is different in several significant ways to that of the Northern Hemisphere for several reasons, including:
#There is no land bridge between Southern Hemisphere countries and the Antarctic zone capable of bringing in cold air without the temperature-mitigating effects of extensive tracts of water;
#The vastly greater amount of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere at most latitudes;
#There is a circumpolar flow of air (&quot;the roaring 40s and 50s&quot;) uninterrupted by large land masses;
#No equivalent jet streams; and
#The peculiarities of the reversing ocean currents in the Pacific.

==Cultural associations==

===Carnival===
Carnival is practiced by many Christians around the world in the days before Lent (40 days, without Sundays, before Easter). It is the first spring festival of the new year for many.

===Easter===
Easter is the most important religious feast in the Christian liturgical year.
Christians believe that Jesus was resurrected from the dead on the &quot;third day&quot; (two days &quot;after&quot; his crucifixion), and celebrate this resurrection on Easter Day, two days after Good Friday. Since the Last Supper was a Passover Seder, the date of Easter can be calculated as the first Sunday after the start of Passover. This is usually (see Passover below) the first Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox. The date of Easter varies between 22 March and 25 April (which corresponds to between 4 April and 8 May in the Gregorian Calendar for the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches using the Julian Calendar). In this celebration, the children do an easter egg hunt.

===May Day===
The First of May is the date of many public holidays. In many countries, May Day is synonymous with International Workers&#x27; Day, or Labour Day, which celebrates the social and economic achievements of the labour movement. As a day of celebration, the holiday has ancient origins, and it can relate to many customs that have survived into modern times. Many of these customs are due to May Day being a cross-quarter day, meaning that (in the Northern Hemisphere where it is almost exclusively celebrated) it falls approximately halfway between the spring equinox and summer solstice. In the Celtic tradition, this date marked the end of spring and the beginning of summer.

===Passover===

The Passover begins on the 15th day of the month of Nisan, which typically falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar on the night of a full moon after the northern spring equinox. However, due to leap months falling after the vernal equinox, Passover sometimes starts on the second full moon after vernal equinox, as in 2016. Jews celebrate this holiday to commemorate their escape from slavery in Egypt as described in the book of Exodus in the Torah.
Foods consumed during Passover seders, such as lamb and barley, are tied to springtime seasonal availability. In this celebration, children recite the Four Questions during the seder and hunt for the afikoman afterwards.

===Allhallowtide===
The Western Christian season encompassing the triduum of All Saints&#x27; Eve (Halloween), All Saints&#x27; Day (All Hallows&#x27;) and All Souls&#x27; Day are observed in the spring in the Southern hemisphere.

<text>Thallophytes (Thallophyta or Thallobionta) are a polyphyletic group of non-motile organisms traditionally described as &quot;thalloid plants&quot;, &quot;relatively simple plants&quot; or &quot;lower plants&quot;. They form a division of kingdom Plantae that include lichens and algae and occasionally bryophytes, bacteria and slime moulds. Thallophytes have a hidden reproductive system and hence they are also incorporated into the similar Cryptogamae category (together with ferns), as opposed to Phanerogamae. Thallophytes are defined by having undifferentiated bodies (thalloid, pseudotissue), as opposed to cormophytes (Cormophyta) with roots and stems. Various groups of thallophytes are major contributors to marine ecosystems.

==Definitions==
Several different definitions of the group have been used. 

Thallophytes (Thallophyta or Thallobionta) are a polyphyletic group of non-mobile organisms traditionally described as &quot;thalloid plants&quot;, &quot;relatively simple plants&quot; or &quot;lower plants&quot;. 
Stephan Endlicher, a 19th-century Austrian botanist, separated the vegetable kingdom into the thallophytes (algae, lichens, fungi) and the cormophytes (including bryophytes and thus being equivalent to Embryophyta in this case) in 1836. This definition of Thallophyta is approximately equivalent to Protophyta, which has always been a loosely defined group.

In the Lindley system (1830–1839), Endlicher&#x27;s cormophytes were divided into the thallogens (including the bryophytes), and cormogens (&quot;non-flowering&quot; plants with roots), as well as the six other classes. Cormogens were a much smaller group than Endlicher&#x27;s cormophytes, including just the ferns (and Equisetopsida) and the plants now known as lycopodiophytes.

Thallophyta is a division of the plant kingdom including primitive forms of plant life showing a simple plant body. Including unicellular to large algae, fungi, lichens.

The first ten phyla are referred to as thallophytes. They are simple plants without roots stems or leaves.

They are non-embryophyta. These plants grow mainly in water.

==Subdivisions==
The Thallophyta have been divided into two subdivisions:
* Myxothallophyta (myxomycetes)
* Euthallophyta (bacteria, fungi, lichens, algae)

The term Euthallophyta was originally used by Adolf Engler.

<text>Duwamish is a retired fireboat in the United States. She is the second oldest vessel designed to fight fires in the US, after &quot;Edward M. Cotter&quot;, in Buffalo, New York.

==Career==
&quot;Duwamish&quot; was built in 1909 for the Seattle Fire Department in Richmond Beach, Washington, just north of Seattle. She was powered by &quot;double vertical (compound) marine steam engines&quot; capable of driving her at . She was equipped with three American LaFrance steam piston pumps rated at a capacity of each. She was originally designed to ram and sink burning wooden vessels, as a last resort, and was equipped with a ram bow for doing so.

On July 30, 1914, &quot;Duwamish&quot; was involved in fighting the fire on the Grand Trunk Pacific dock. In the 1930s, as a cost-saving measure, the Seattle City Council directed that &quot;Duwamish&quot; be used as a tug to push the city&#x27;s garbage scow.

After an upgrade in 1949, the pumps delivered a total of . This capacity was only exceeded in 2003 by the Los Angeles Fire Department&#x27;s &quot;Warner Lawrence&quot;, which delivers .

&quot;Duwamish&quot; is long with a beam and a draft. Her registered gross tonnage is .

== Current status ==
Retired in 1985, &quot;Duwamish&quot; was purchased by the Puget Sound Fireboat Foundation. She is permanently moored at the Historic Ships Wharf near the Museum of History &amp; Industry at South Lake Union Park in Seattle. Visitors may board the vessel when volunteer staff is available.

&quot;Duwamish&quot; was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989.

She is a city landmark.

<doc id="316540" wikidata="Q2384898" url="?curid=316540" title="Macross Plus">
<text>is a four-episode anime OVA and theatrical movie in the &quot;Macross&quot; series. It was the first sequel to the original &quot;Macross&quot; television series that took place in the official timeline (&quot;Macross II&quot; was quickly retconned by series creator Shōji Kawamori as a parallel world story in the &quot;Macross&quot; universe). &quot;Plus&quot; was a groundbreaking combination of traditional cel and computer-generated animation at the time of its release, paving the way for the incorporation of more computer-generated imagery in Japanese animation.

Both the OVA series and movie were released in Japan by Bandai Visual and in North America and Europe by Manga Entertainment. The Australian VHS version was released by Manga Entertainment and the DVD version by Madman Entertainment under sub-license from Manga Entertainment. It features several new mecha designs inspired by the original series.

==Plot==
Three decades after the great war between the humans and the Zentradi, in January 2040, the U.N. government is developing new technologies to use in their transforming fighter aircraft by running tests on the colony planet &quot;Eden&quot;. Military test pilots and former childhood friends, loose cannon Isamu Alva Dyson and the Zentradi mixed race Guld Goa Bowman, are selected to each pilot a new aircraft (Shinsei Industries&#x27; YF-19 &amp; General Galaxy&#x27;s YF-21) for Project Super Nova, to choose the newest successor to the VF-11 Thunderbolt variable fighter which is currently still in use by the U.N. Spacy military forces. Their own personal grudges end up disrupting the tests, and begin to wreak havoc on the program.

Their rivalry heats up when a mutual friend, Myung Fang Lone, shows up. Myung was a childhood friend of both pilots, but the three of them had a falling out, and quickly grew apart. This is alluded to throughout the story, and evidence of the strained relationship between Myung and either of the two men is apparent, while their distaste for one another is obvious. When they meet again, they discover that Myung is now the producer of Sharon Apple, the hottest entertainer in the galaxy, who just happens to be an AI hologram. Unbeknownst to the public, the Sharon AI is incomplete and requires Myung to provide emotions during concerts.

During a testing session, Guld and Isamu finally face off against each other – and an all-out fight begins as each tries to best the other. Despite being in the middle of a testing area, they quickly proceed to tear the surrounding area to shreds in their fight to gain superiority over the other. Having turned off their communications equipment, both pilots fight using the test aircraft in a series of stunning dog-fight maneuvers before going into battroid form and finishing the fight on the ground. In the process, an &quot;accidental&quot; gun pod discharge injures Isamu and he is taken to the hospital, where he awakens to Myung standing watch over him. After returning to duty, a military tribunal questions Guld about their fight in the test area, but ultimately the decision is left up to the Admiral in charge of the project. Chief Millard, the station commander of New Edwards Test Flight Facility, reluctantly tells both pilots that their mission and the project has been scrubbed by the U.N. Spacy High Command – due to the completion of a newer, and previously unknown aircraft, the Ghost X-9 (ゴースト X-9), an advanced stealth UCAV prototype which was secretly being produced on Earth while two other prototypes (YF-19 and YF-21) were simultaneously being tested for Project Super Nova in planet Eden. With the Ghost X-9 completed, testing on the YF-19 and YF-21 was halted indefinitely, since the higher-ups believe that the new unmanned fighter is superior in every way.

Meanwhile, the AI Sharon Apple has developed a malevolent consciousness, due to an illegal bio-chip having been installed by lead scientist on the project, Marge Gueldoa. During her concert in the Atlantis Dome inside Earth&#x27;s Macross City, Sharon quickly takes over both the Ghost X-9 and the SDF-1 Macross Fortress and hypnotizes her audience and the Macross&#x27; staff, while trapping Myung in the Macross itself.

Wanting to prove that manned fighter units are a necessity and to prove his worth, Isamu and Yang (the YF-19&#x27;s engineer) take the fighter jet and space-fold to Earth to beat the X-9 at its own game, while Guld gives chase in the YF-21. Sharon hacks into Earth&#x27;s outer space defences, but both Isamu and Guld make it through. They then proceed to attack each other again, as they argue about childhood grudges. At the climax of the fight Guld, finally achieving a target lock, releases a large fury of missiles seemingly destroying the YF-19. As this happens, Guld is flooded by repressed memories. Now realizing it was truly his own jealous rage that had torn the friendship apart. Having saved himself and Yang by cutting engine throttle and gliding, the YF-19 then appears in the skies above Guld and the two old friends reconcile.

When discovering that Myung&#x27;s life is in danger, Isamu and Guld quickly go to her aid. While Isamu goes after Sharon, Guld fights the X-9 and ultimately destroys it by removing the gravitational safety limiters on his aircraft, and matching the X-9&#x27;s velocity/maneuverability, which is much higher than normally possible due to it being computer-controlled and having no pilot, until he achieves a target lock and shoots the X-9 down. However, removing the limiters allows Guld to achieve accelerations exceeding human (even Zentradi-Human) limitations, which ultimately leads to his death, the g-forces generated by his piloting literally crushing him even as he crashes the YF-21 into the X-9, destroying it.

While fighting the SDF-1 Macross, Sharon hypnotises Yang who shoots at Isamu but only hits his helmet. Isamu ejected Yang but then is hypnotized by Sharon&#x27;s voice, and is left to crash to his death. At the last second, Myung&#x27;s voice reaches him and brings him out back to consciousness. Dodging the Macross&#x27; fire, Isamu is able to destroy the central computer, effectively eliminating Sharon.

The story ends as the sun rises over the Macross Fortress, with Myung waving to Isamu, who has survived the destruction of Sharon&#x27;s computer.

Eventually, the U.N. government banned all AI technology developments after the incident, and allowed the continuation of Project Super Nova.

==Production==
Following Big West&#x27;s 1992 release of &quot;Macross II&quot; (which was subsequently retconned as an alternate universe title), original &quot;Macross&quot; staff member Shōji Kawamori began work on a true sequel to the original &quot;Macross&quot; series. To realistically depict the intense flight scenes in the anime, Kawamori – along with action choreographer and animator Ichiro Itano and other staff members – traveled to Edwards Air Force Base (which was the basis for New Edwards Air Force Base on planet Eden in the series) in Edwards, California, for a few training sessions with dogfighting school Air Combat USA. The Advanced Tactical Fighter program of the 1980s was the basis of the Project Supernova contest between the YF-19 and YF-21. Consequently, the YF-21&#x27;s design was heavily influenced by the Northrop YF-23 while the YF-19 resembles the Grumman X-29 when in jet mode.

The design of Eden City was influenced by the San Francisco landscape (which also served as a backdrop for Frontier City in &quot;Macross Frontier&quot;). The wind farms throughout the planet were based on those found in California&#x27;s Central Valley, while Eden&#x27;s highways were designed from those seen in Orlando, Florida.

The series was directed by Shinichirō Watanabe, featuring character designs by Masayuki and animation direction by Kōji Morimoto, who designed the Sharon Apple concert scene. Shōji Kawamori designed all the new variable fighters in the anime. Kazutaka Miyatake was credited for the use of his previous designs for the Macross and the Destroid Monster, and he was also involved in the project as mecha designer for the YF-21 cockpit, both the YF-21 and YF-19 flightsuits, the X-9 &quot;Ghost&quot; drone fighter and the renegade &quot;Zentradi&quot; battlesuits.

===Score===

Yoko Kanno composed the score for &quot;Macross Plus&quot;. The orchestral score was recorded in Tel Aviv, Israel, by members of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, except for &quot;Dogfight&quot; (an orchestral track used during the final battle between Isamu and Guld), which was recorded in Prague, Czech Republic by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra.

Sharon Apple&#x27;s songs are performed by a number of different artists – namely Gabriela Robin, Akino Arai, Mai Yamane, Melodie Sexton, Wuyontana and the Raiché Coutev Sisters. The most notable song in the series is Myung&#x27;s song &quot;Voices&quot;, which is performed by Arai and is the only Japanese-language song in the soundtrack. For the English dub of the series, &quot;Voices&quot; was translated into English and performed by Michelle Flynn. Three songs (&quot;Information High&quot;, &quot;The Borderline&quot; and &quot;Pulse&quot;) are in English, while &quot;Idol Talk&quot; is in French. Four songs (&quot;After, in the Dark – Torch Song&quot;, &quot;Santi-U&quot;, &quot;A Sai En&quot; and &quot;Wanna Be an Angel&quot;) are sung in the fictional Zentran language.

The soundtrack CDs were released in Japan by Victor Entertainment. In North America, only the first two soundtracks were made available; first through JVC, then subsequently through AnimeTrax (a division of The Right Stuf International).

==Versions==

===&quot;Macross Plus&quot; OVA===
The OVA version (マクロスプラス) consists of four episodes, each approximately 37–40 minutes in length. The Japanese voice cast is as follows:

*Isamu Alva Dyson (Takumi Yamazaki)
*Guld Goa Bowman (Unshou Ishizuka)
*Myung Fang Lone (Rica Fukami)
*Lucy McMillan (Megumi Hayashibara)
*Sharon Apple (Mako Hyōdō)
*Marge Gueldoa (Show Hayami)
*Millard Johnson (Kenji Utsumi)
*Yang Neumann (Tomohiro Nishimura)
*Kate Masseau (Urara Takano)

===&quot;Macross Plus: International Version&quot;===
An English dub version was produced for the international market, featuring a North American cast and an English version of the main theme &quot;Voices&quot;. When it came to Episode 4 of the original translation, due to a rights issue at the time, the entire soundmix including music and sound effects had to be recreated from scratch. Only the songs performed by Sharon Apple (&quot;Pulse,&quot; &quot;Information High,&quot; and &quot;Santi-U(second half)/Torch Song&quot;) and the English version of &quot;Voices&quot; were retained. The background music entitled &quot;Dogfight&quot; was replaced with another track entitled &quot;Breakout&quot; (featured in Episode 1 and 2), notably in the main Dogfight sequence and just after Isamu recovers from his trance.

It was later that Bandai Visual commissioned a new dub for Episode 4, retaining the original Japanese soundmix but utilizing a new voice cast due to actor availability. Most notably Isamu&#x27;s part was recast with David Hayter, most famous for his voicework on the Metal Gear series. This version was exclusive to Japan, also being included as the English dub of choice on the Japanese Blu-ray release in 2012, still retaining the original Manga versions of Episodes 1 - 3.

In Japan, this version was released with Japanese subtitles as the &quot;International Version&quot;.

*Isamu Alva Dyson (Bryan Cranston, David Hayter (Bandai Dub of Episode 4))
*Guld Goa Bowman (Richard Epcar, Michael Gregory (Bandai Dub of Episode 4))
*Myung Fang Lone (Riva Spier)
*Lucy McMillan (Dyanne DiRosario)
*Sharon Apple (Melora Harte)
*Marge Gueldoa (Steven Blum)
*Millard Johnson (Beau Billingslea)
*Yang Neumann (Dan Woren, Derek Stephen Prince (Bandai Dub of Episode 4))
*Kate Masseau (Edie Mirman)

In January 1998, it broadcast in 3 parts, each twice on midnights on the new Teletoon station in Canada along with the film &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;.

===&quot;Macross Plus: Movie Edition&quot;===
After completion, the series was re-edited for theatrical release, with a shortened 115 minute runtime. This version, entitled &quot;Macross Plus: Movie Edition&quot;, features multiple new and alternate scenes, while removing and shortening many other scenes from the original OVA series.

&quot;Macross Plus Movie Edition&quot; had a limited theatrical release at the Barbican Centre in the UK on September 14, 2019, and in the U.S. through Fathom Events on December 14, 2021.

==Home video==
Macross Plus was first released in Japan on VHS and Laserdisc formats by Bandai Visual, and on DVD, the very latter on August 25, 2001 (Ep.1) &amp; February 25, 2002 (Ep.4) respectively. Said discs include English dialogue. Manga Entertainment released the series in VHS (dubbed and subtitled versions) and Laserdisc formats in Europe and as their first title in the North American market. The English-dubbed series was also released in MovieCD format for Windows 3.1/Windows 95-based PCs. In 1999, Manga Entertainment released &quot;Macross Plus&quot; on DVD format, with two episodes per disc. Sales of disc 2 of the series were affected by a subtitle timing error, which was corrected on subsequent reprints.

A subtitle-only version of &quot;Macross Plus: Movie Edition&quot; was released on VHS in the U.S. through Manga Entertainment, with a DVD release in 2000. The DVD version is a direct transfer from the VHS release, causing the subtitles to be part of the footage itself, so they can&#x27;t be turned off. There is no English dub for the movie version.

On August 24, 2007, an HD Remastered DVD box set containing both the entire OVA series and the Movie Edition was released in Japan. Unlike the episodic releases however, which included the English dub alongside the Japanese track, the dub was omitted, and a PCM mix replaced both (Dolby Digital) stereo options heard before. On June 21, 2013, a Blu-ray box, again featuring episodes 1-4 &amp; Movie released. This time however, the English dub was reinstated, and episodes 1-4 include both English &amp; Japanese audio, with episode 4 using the newer Bandai mix, while retaining Manga&#x27;s original for episodes 1-3. The Movie Edition is Japan-exclusive but offers English subtitles, plus a new DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track to go alongside its PCM option. A stand-alone Blu-ray of the theatrical cut was made available on January 29, 2016.

==Merchandise==

===Books===
During the release of the series, Shogakukan published the companion visual book &quot;This Is Animation Special: Macross Plus&quot;, which covered the first two episodes. A follow-up book was released, covering the production of the Movie Edition.

===Toys===
&quot;Macross Plus&quot; toys were not available until 2000, when Yamato Toys released a 1/72 scale diecast replica of the YF-19. Since then, aside from Yamato, replicas and figures of the series&#x27; variable fighters have been manufactured by Doyusha and Kaiyodo (under the Revoltech line).

None of these toys are widely available in the U.S. due to ongoing legal disputes between Big West and Tatsunoko Production/Harmony Gold USA over the &quot;Macross&quot; copyright.

===Model kits===
Hasegawa Hobby Kits released non-transforming model kits of the YF-19 and YF-21 in fighter modes between 2001 and 2002. The molds for both planes were re-used for the VF-19A (from &quot;Macross VF-X2&quot;) and VF-22S (from &quot;Macross 7&quot;), respectively.

In 2009, Hasegawa has released a new-tool 1:48 scale kit of the YF-19, in conjunction with their new 1:48 VF-1 Valkyrie model kit.

Resin and garage kits of the &quot;Macross Plus&quot; variable fighters have been manufactured by several different companies in Japan. The most well-known of these kits is the 1/100 Perfect Variable YF-19 by Studio HalfEye, which became the basis for Yamato Toys&#x27; 1/72 diecast toy.

Bandai released High grade 1/100 plastic model kit in early 2023. The kit has transformable feature by switching parts.

===Manga adaptation===
A new manga adaptation of the anime is being serialized by comic publisher Kadokawa Comics A with the name &quot;Macross Plus: TAC Name&quot;. The story of the comic is a retelling of the events from the anime as well as a more detailed description of the background and past history of the characters. The artist of the manga is Naoki Moriya and is available since February 10, 2012.

=== Video games ===
In 1997, Banpresto released a vertically scrolling shooter arcade game adaptation of &quot;Macross Plus&quot;.

A video game adaptation of the OVA series titled was released by Shoeisha Co. Ltd. for the PlayStation in 2000 in Japan only. The game features some members of the original cast and staff, and includes parts of the original soundtrack, as well as some cutscenes in the form of excerpts from the Movie Edition of &quot;Macross Plus&quot;. It includes the variable fighters and mecha used in the OVA, as well as select units from the original &quot;Macross&quot; series. The game also introduces the Neo Glaug (a transformable version of the Zentradi battle pod) as an in-game exclusive. Unlike other &quot;Macross&quot; games, transformation of variable fighters is not possible during gameplay; each level has the player&#x27;s unit fixed in one mode only. Aside from the single-player story mode, two players can battle each other in vs. mode.

<text>Daniel Chevilette Govan (July 4, 1829 – March 12, 1911) was an American miner, planter, and soldier. He served as a Confederate general during the American Civil War, prominent in campaigns and battles in the Western Theater.

==Early life and career==
Daniel C. Govan was born in Northampton County, North Carolina. His father was U.S. Representative Andrew R. Govan from South Carolina, who in 1832 relocated the family to Marshall County, Mississippi, where he was raised. Govan received his primary education from private tutoring and then attended South Carolina College (modern day University of South Carolina) graduating in 1848.

Govan participated in the 1849 California Gold Rush along with his cousin Benjamin McCulloch, who would also become a Confederate general. In 1850 Govan was elected deputy sheriff of Sacramento, and two years later he returned to Mississippi and took up work as a planter. In December 1853 Govan married Mary Fogg Otey, the daughter of prominent theologian James Hervey Otey, with whom he would have 14 children. In 1860 he moved to Helena, Arkansas, and again became a planter.

==Civil War service==
At the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861, Govan chose to follow his home state and the Confederate cause. He raised a company of men and in May he was appointed a captain in the Arkansas State forces. On June 5 he was elected lieutenant colonel in the 2nd Arkansas Infantry, and on January 28, 1862, was promoted to colonel and given command of the regiment.
Govan and his men participated in the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. Following Shiloh, Govan took part in Edmund Kirby Smith&#x27;s Kentucky Campaign and fought at the Battle of Perryville in October. At one point during this battle Govan temporarily commanded a brigade. He then fought at the Battle of Stones River that winter and at the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863. Govan led a brigade in the Reserve Corps of the Army of Tennessee from August to November. During the Battle of Missionary Ridge Govan played a prominent role in the Battle of Ringgold Gap, receiving high praise from his commander, Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne.

On December 29, 1863, Govan was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. His command consisting of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Arkansas Infantry Regiments. Govan&#x27;s brigade participated in the Atlanta Campaign, and he received particular mention for his conduct at the Battle of Pickett&#x27;s Mill in May 1864. Govan was captured after a fierce battle at the Battle of Jonesborough on September 1, but was exchanged for George Stoneman on October 2.

Govan served the remainder of the war with the Army of Tennessee, participating in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign and then the Carolinas Campaign. He was seriously wounded in his throat on December 16 at Nashville. Govan surrendered in 1865 with Gen. Joseph E. Johnston at Greensboro, North Carolina. He was paroled from there on May 1 and was pardoned by the U.S. Government on December 12.

==Postbellum career==
Following the war, Govan returned home and resumed farming. He later served as the Indian agent at the Tulalip Agency in the state of Washington in 1894. Govan died in 1911 at the home of one of his children in Memphis, Tennessee. His body was brought to Holly Springs, Mississippi, and was buried at the city&#x27;s Hillcrest Cemetery.

<doc id="316549" wikidata="Q1200368" url="?curid=316549" title="Astralwerks">
<text>Astralwerks (or Astralwerks Records) is an American record label primarily focused on electronic music that is now owned by Universal Music Group. Its material is distributed via Capitol Music Group in the United States. The label was founded in 1993 and, in its early years, featured prominent British acts like The Future Sound of London, Fatboy Slim and The Chemical Brothers. In recent years, its roster has expanded to include acts like Halsey, Marshmello, Porter Robinson, Illenium, Zhu and numerous others. In 2018, Astralwerks&#x27; headquarters were moved from its original home of New York City to Los Angeles.

==History==

Astralwerks was founded in New York City in July 1993 by Brian Long as an electronic and dance imprint of Caroline Records. Long had previously helped curate an electronic music compilation that was released on Caroline called &quot;Excursions in Ambience&quot;. Caroline&#x27;s parent company, Virgin Records, sold the label to Thorn EMI soon after Astralwerks&#x27; foundation. The first album released on Astralwerks was &quot;Tales of Ephidrina&quot; by Amorphous Androgynous, an alter ego of The Future Sound of London. In 1994, Peter Wohelski was brought on as the head of A&amp;R. Wohelski is credited with discovering the Chemical Brothers and bringing them into the Astralwerks fold. Their 1995 debut studio album, &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot;, sold 750,000 copies in the United States. The duo&#x27;s 1997 follow-up, &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot;, reached number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

Other albums released under Astralwerks in its first five years included Seefeel&#x27;s &quot;Quique&quot; (1994), Soul Oddity&#x27;s &quot;Soul Oddity&quot; (1996), μ-Ziq&#x27;s &quot;Lunatic Harness&quot; (1997), Photek&#x27;s &quot;Modus Operandi&quot; (1997), and Fatboy Slim&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby&quot; (1998), among many others. 1999 saw the releases of Basement Jaxx&#x27;s &quot;Remedy&quot; and Cassius&#x27; &quot;1999&quot;, the latter of which had three singles peak in the top 30 of the U.S. Dance chart. That year, Peter Wohelski also left his position as general manager of the label and was replaced by Errol Kolosine. In the early 2000s, Astralwerks releases included Air&#x27;s 2001 album, &quot;10 000 Hz Legend&quot; (which reached number 88 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200) and the 2003 re-issue of Motorbass&#x27; &quot;Pansoul&quot;. In 2005, the label released Kraftwerk&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Minimum-Maximum&quot;, and a Brian Eno compilation called, &quot;More Music for Films&quot;.

In 2007, EMI reorganized its distribution arm, which ultimately saw Glenn Mendlinger take over for Errol Kolosine as the label&#x27;s general manager. In 2009, the label released David Guetta&#x27;s &quot;One Love&quot;. The lead single off that album, &quot;When Love Takes Over,&quot; would go on to win a Grammy Award. In 2012, the label released Swedish House Mafia&#x27;s &quot;Until Now&quot; which featured the single &quot;Don&#x27;t You Worry Child.&quot; The album reached number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 while the single made it to number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

That year, the Universal Music Group (UMG) purchased EMI, bringing Astralwerks under UMG control where it remains today. As part of the corporate restructuring, Astralwerks became an imprint under the Capitol Music Group. In 2013, the label signed both Porter Robinson and Deadmau5 (along with his Mau5trap imprint). The following year, Astralwerks signed singer Halsey to a record deal. Also that year, Robinson released his debut studio album, &quot;Worlds&quot; and Deadmau5 also released his Astralwerks debut, &quot;While(1&lt;2)&quot;. Halsey&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Badlands&quot;, came in 2015 and peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Her 2017 follow-up, &quot;Hopeless Fountain Kingdom&quot;, would top the chart.

===2018–present: Relaunch and relocation===

In 2018, it was announced that Astralwerks would move from New York City to its current home base of Los Angeles. Glenn Mendlinger also stepped down as general manager and was replaced by Toby Andrews. In September 2018, the label announced that it had &quot;relaunched&quot; with a spate of new signings and a new staff at their Los Angeles offices. The new signings included Axwell &amp; Ingrosso and Illenium. Marshmello, another recent Astralwerks signee, released the song &quot;Happier&quot; featuring Bastille which reached number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped several &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. In October 2018, the label partnered with gaming personality Ninja on a compilation album that was released in December and featured original songs from Tycho, Alesso, and 3lau, among others. In 2021, Astralwerks and Blue Note Records collaborated on a series of jazz/electronica albums titled &quot;Bluewerks.&quot;

In 2023, it was announced that AstralWerks would enter into a partnership with SIZE Records, distributing all of the label&#x27;s future recordings in addition to handling its back catalog prior to the distribution deal.

<doc id="316553" wikidata="Q933634" url="?curid=316553" title="Shorinji Kempo">
<text>is a Japanese martial art claimed to be a modified version of Shaolin kung fu. The name &quot;Shōrinji Kempo&quot; is the Japanese reading of &quot;Shàolínsì Quánfǎ&quot;. It was established in 1947 by [born ], a Japanese martial artist and former military intelligence agent who lived in China for many years before and during World War II.

Shorinji Kempo is a holistic system, whose training methods are divided into three parts: self-defence training, mental training and, health training. The basis are the concepts that &quot;spirit and body are not separable&quot; (心身一如: &quot;shinshin-ichinyo&quot;) and that it is integral to train both &quot;body and mind as one&quot; (拳禅一如: &quot;kenzen ichinyo&quot;).

Through employing a well-organised technical course outline, Shorinji Kempo aims to help the practitioner &quot;establish oneself&quot; and to promote &quot;mutual comfort&quot;. The philosophy and techniques of Shorinji Kempo are outlined in their master text, (少林寺拳法教範) &quot;Shōrinji-Kempō-kyōhan&quot;.

==Overview==

There are two sides of Shorinji Kempo – true &quot;budō&quot; (武道) and educational system. As the latter, the organisation is well known for their mental training institution as well as body training facilities &quot;dōjō&quot; (道場).

The founder, Doshin So, wanted to establish not only an organisation which incorporated mental and physical training but also wanted to educate Japanese people who had been completely demoralised by World War II.
His aim was to help those who had lost their way and rebuild Japan for the future. It is said that he tried to teach Buddhist philosophy but no one followed him. Later on, So reportedly saw a vision of Bodhidharma, which inspired him to pursue teaching martial arts, as Bodhidharma was believed to have done. Both of these are later to become the main training methods of Shorinji Kempo.

Shorinji Kempo includes a broad curriculum of self-defense techniques, known as &quot;hokei&quot; (法形). For demonstration or competition purposes, these are combined into a choreographed sequence known as an &quot;embu&quot; (演武). The &quot;embu&quot; consists of (typically) 6 sections and each section includes a series of &quot;gōhō&quot; (剛法) or hard techniques and &quot;jūhō&quot; (柔法) or soft techniques. During a pair-form or &quot;kumi&quot; &quot;embu&quot;, one person attacks and another person defends for one section, and they then swap roles for the next section. The application of technique within an embu is known as &quot;hien&quot; (飛燕) or flying swallow which represents speed and smoothness of those techniques. The &quot;embu&quot; is occasionally performed wearing a black robe, called &quot;hōi&quot; (法衣), for example at an opening or closing ceremony of a &quot;taikai&quot; (大会, convention/tournament).

===Hombu===
Headquartered in Tadotsu town, Kagawa Prefecture (on Shikoku island) in Japan.

Buildings:
* Hondo (main &quot;dojo&quot;/hall)
* Kodo (lecture hall)
* Rensei-dojo (former 1st &quot;dojo&quot;)
* Shokudo (dining room)
* Daigan-toh (memorial tower)
* Zenrin Gakuen (college house)

The bones and ashes of Doshin So are buried behind the lecture hall.

===Organizations===
The organisation of the Shorinji Kempo group is divided into 5 entities:

* Religious entity (金剛禅総本山少林寺: &quot;Kongō-zen Sōhon-zan Shōrinji&quot;),
* Foundation entity Shorinji Kempo Foundation Federation (一般財団法人少林寺拳法連盟: &quot;Ippan-zaidan-hōjin Shōrinji-kempō Renmei&quot;),
* Educational entity Zenrin Gakuen College (学校法人禅林学園: &quot;Gakkō-hōjin Zenrin Gakuen&quot;),
* Global entity World Shorinji Kempo Organization, WSKO (少林寺拳法世界連合: &quot;Shōrinji-kempō Sekai Rengō&quot;),
* Intellectual property entity (一般社団法人SHORINJI KEMPO UNITY: &quot;Ippan-shadan-hōjin Shōrinji-kempō Yunitī&quot;).

The relationship between these five entities is very close because of the unique fusion of religion, martial arts, and education. (Source: web site of Shorinji Kempo Foundation Federation and Shorinji Kempo Kyohan written by Doshin So)

*Indonesian Shorinji Kempo Federation

*Swiss Shorinji Kempo Federation 
*Finnish Shorinji Kempo Federation 
*Swedish Shorinji Kempo Federation

=== The Shaolin monastery ===

The name &quot;Shōrinji&quot; is a literal reading of the Chinese &quot;Shaolin Temple&quot; from the Shaolin Monastery in Henan Province, China. Dōshin Sō claimed to have inherited the title of the 21st master of the &quot;Giwamon-ken&quot; (義和門拳) system (in Mandarin: Yihe Mén Quán) which is believed to have been used during the Boxer rebellion of 1899 to 1901.

Dōshin Sō claimed to have been much impressed to see paintings on the wall of &quot;Byakue-den&quot; (白衣殿) chapel at Shaolin Temple, although there is no evidence that ever visited it. The style of the monks practicing the martial arts was supposedly very fresh and vital to him. He believed it was the origin of the existing quan fa in China. (source: a book &quot;Hi-den Shorinji Kempo&quot; 秘伝少林寺拳法「光文社」written by Doshin So, published by Kobun-sha Kappa Books)

=== Emblem ===

The swastika, called &quot;manji&quot; in Japanese, was originally the emblem for Shorinji Kempo, as it is used in Dharmic religions, as well as by many cultures around the world, for centuries. The swastika can either mean love (left-facing) and strength (right-facing) which symbolise Kongo-zen teaching. However, given the social stigma that the swastika carries, the WSKO replaced it with the character 拳 (&quot;ken&quot;), which means &quot;fist&quot;, in the center of &quot;tate-manji&quot; (swastika guarded by shields) on the emblem or using &quot;nagare-manji&quot; which meant &quot;rounded swastika&quot;.

In 2005, the Shorinji Kempo Group introduced a new symbol for all the international Shorinji Kempo federations. The new mark is called &quot;so-en&quot; (double circle) and it is said that this is the extreme shape of two swastikas intertwined. The &quot;so-en&quot; emblem is put on the training uniform (&quot;keikogi&quot;), belt (&quot;obi&quot;), and the &quot;hōi&quot;, a black robe worn by high-ranking practitioners during exhibitions.

== History ==

Doshin Sō, birthname Michiomi Nakano, was born in Okayama Prefecture and spent his youth in northern China, first with his grandfather and then as an intelligence agent of the occupying Imperial Japanese Army to collect military information during the war. As part of his cover, he was posted to a Taoist school as an apprentice. There, Nakano met Chen Liang (陳 良), a Taoist priest and master of Báilián Mén Quán or &quot;Báilián Quán&quot; (meaning &quot;White Lotus Fist&quot;). After some time, Chen introduced Nakano to Wen Taizong (文 太宗), a master in Yihe Mén Quán or &quot;Yihe Quán&quot; (meaning &quot;Righteous Harmony Fist&quot;). Wen would take in Nakano as his student at the Shaolin Temple, at Henan, and passed onto him the title of grandmaster in that specific style of quan fa.

In the final days of the Second World War, the Soviet Union broke its neutrality pact with Japan, declaring war. The Soviets invaded Manchuria on 9 August, and overran the Japanese in less than 11 days. The aftermath was appalling; Japanese casualties were tenfold than that of the Soviets&#x27;; both civilians and wounded Japanese soldiers were left to die while the army retreated; and many Japanese civilians committed mass suicide. It was in this carnage that Dōshin Sō recognised and understood the &quot;nature of the human being&quot;. According to his book, the nature and quality of the person is extremely important since politics, law, and day-to-day living are all conducted by human beings.

After returning to Japan, Sō thought of establishing a cram school for young people. He was stationed in the small town of Tadotsu, on Shikoku island, to teach Buddhist philosophy. He established Shorinji Kempo to take the concept of &quot;ken-zen ichinyo&quot; by following Bodhidharma and made use of techniques he had learned in China (source: the book &quot;Hi-den Shōrinji Kempō&quot; (秘伝少林寺拳法) written by Dōshin Sō, published by Kobun-sha Kappa Books).
This promotion and campaign was known as &quot;Kongō-zen undō&quot; (Diamond-zen campaign) and expanded Shorinji Kempo throughout Japan by his pupils. This campaign and concept was inherited by his daughter after his death in 1980 till present. After his death, Dōshin Sō is called &quot;Kaiso&quot; or founder.

== Philosophy ==

Shorinji Kempo is neither a traditional form of martial art nor a kind of competitive sport. It is said to be as a religious &quot;gyō&quot; among pupils.
According to the Buddhist doctrine, the spirit and fleshly body are inseparable. By practicing Shorinji Kempo techniques and learning its philosophy, it is believed to develop a firm body like a pair of standing Vajradhara (金剛神: &quot;Kongō-shin&quot; or 金剛力士 &quot;Kongō-rikishi&quot;) and the never-give-up spirit of Bodhidharma (菩提達磨: &quot;Bodai-daruma&quot;).

=== Zen ===

Shorinji Kempo incorporates zen for mental training. 
Techniques are mainly divided into 3 categories: &quot;gōhō&quot; (剛法 &quot;hard techniques&quot; - hand strikes, chops, hammers, elbows, knees, kicks, reaps, stomps, and blocks); &quot;jūhō&quot; (柔法 &quot;soft techniques&quot; - throws, pins, chokes, joint manipulations, dodges and releases) and; &quot;seihō&quot; (整法 &quot;healing techniques&quot; - acupressure, bone setting, and resuscitation techniques).

Doshin So in his book, &quot;What is Shorinji Kempo?&quot;, said that he pursued his revelations and the development of the fighting technique of Bodhidharma known as the &quot;Arakan no ken&quot; (阿羅漢之拳) or the &quot;Arhat fist&quot;. He believed this to have originated in India around 5,000 years ago. He was inspired by seeing representations of the wall paintings at the Shaolin Temple in China.

Those who practice Shorinji Kempo are called &quot;kenshi&quot; (拳士; meaning &#x27;boxers&#x27;). Kenshi always salute with &quot;gassho&quot; (合掌) the greeting commonly used among Buddhist pupils. The &quot;gassho-rei&quot;(合掌礼) is also &quot;gassho-gamae&quot; (合掌構) stance, with both palms put together and raised in front of one&#x27;s face.

== Qualifications ==
There are qualifications for 1st degree black belt (1st &quot;dan&quot;) in order to achieve the steps of body and spiritual training: These are &quot;bukai&quot;, &quot;hōkai&quot;, and &quot;sōkai&quot;.

Examples of &quot;bukai&quot; (武階 martial rank) and corresponding &quot;hōkai&quot; (法階 philosophical rank):
* 1st &quot;dan&quot; (初段 &quot;sho-dan&quot;) - 准拳士 &quot;Jun-kenshi&quot;
* 2nd &quot;dan&quot; (弐段 &quot;ni-dan&quot;) - 少拳士 &quot;Sho-kenshi&quot;
* 3rd &quot;dan&quot; (参段 &quot;san-dan&quot;) - 中拳士 &quot;Chu-kenshi&quot;

* 5th &quot;dan&quot; (五段 &quot;go-dan&quot;) - 大拳士 &quot;Dai-kenshi&quot;

After having 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree &quot;bukai&quot; qualifications, &quot;kenshi&quot; practicing at &quot;doin&quot; will automatically have &quot;Jun-kenshi&quot;, &quot;Sho-kenshi&quot; and &quot;Chu-kenshi&quot; in &quot;hokai&quot; qualifications,
those &quot;kenshi&quot; practicing at branches will have these corresponding &quot;hokai&quot; after joining the training at Shorinji Kempo headquarters in Tadotsu town in Kagawa prefecture in Japan.

From 1st to 3rd degree, the examinations are held in each prefectural Shorinji Kempo organization headquarters.
However, the special examination is only held at its main headquarters in Tadotsu for the qualifications of 4th degree and above.
Outside Japan 3rd degree practitioners (san-dan) are considered teachers. In Japan, 4th degree practitioners (yon-dan) and above are considered teachers, but those ranking at the 5th degree (go-dan) and above are officially called &quot;sensei&quot; (先生: teacher). Kenshi who obtained 4th &quot;dan&quot; automatically obtain &quot;Sei-kenshi&quot; as well.

WSKO&#x27;s qualifications and conditions are a little different from its Japanese domestic counterparts.

== Embu ==

&quot;Embu&quot; is a combination of &quot;hokei&quot; (organised patterns of &quot;goho&quot; and &quot;juho&quot; techniques) which has 6 sections. 
It is similar to &quot;kata&quot;, except that two or more people participate. &quot;Embu&quot; is performed in the court, in the gym, at a Taikai or other ceremonial occasions. In these patterns one kenshi takes the part of attacker (kōsha 攻者) and one acts as defender (shusha 守者); they then change roles and repeat the technique. After the set form technique the kenshi perform ren-han-ko (連反攻: a series of offence after defence) which is a free form counter-attack which continues until the original attacker successfully blocks/parries and counters. The juho techniques are followed by &quot;katame&quot; (pinning techniques) or kime (finishing techniques with various hand strikes or kicks to nerve points).

Embu start with &quot;gassho-rei&quot; and are performed usually in kumi embu (pair), tandoku embu (single) and dantai embu (6 or 8 in a group).

Initially, there was no regulation in performing embu. Nowadays, it is rated out of 5 (sometimes 3 at preliminary selection) judges having 60 points each for the 6 sections and 40 points each for other factors for comprehensiveness. The maximum possible total of 300 points can be achieved after eliminating the highest and the lowest scores when 5 judges are judging. Kumi-embu and dantai-embu are performed within a time limit of between one and a half to two minutes.

The most famous embu pair was Masuomi Nakano and Toshio Misaki whose embu was said to have impressed Doshin So.

== Unyo-ho ==
Earlier in Shorinji Kempo&#x27;s history, was the Unyo-ho, a fighting competition. After many accidents during sparring bouts with no headgear, the organization required the wearing of headgear, body protectors, and groin guards. A system of limiting each kenshi to one role of defender or attacker was also introduced for safety. Rating is done by judging attacking points, defensive techniques and counter-attacks.

== Current status ==
Currently, Kouma So, son of Yuuki So and grandson of Kaiso So Doshin, the founder of Shorinji Kempo, is the president of the World Shorinji Kempo Organization (WSKO). He took over from his mother in 2020 at which point she had retired from office after 40 years of service. Kazuhiro Kawashima is the national president of the Japanese Shorinji Kempo Federation.

In 2010, the British Shorinji Kempo Federation (BSKF) split from the WSKO, in response to the latter&#x27;s announcement on March 3 that it was dissolving the former. However, the United Kingdom Shorinji Kempo Federation (UKSKF) still remains affiliated with WSKO.

The BSKF applied to the British Intellectual Property Office (IPO) to register the trademark that it has used for 25 years. Shorinji Kempo Unity opposed the application, but the IPO found that SKU had not demonstrated genuine use of its registered trademark. SKU appealed the decision. In the High Court, the appeal judge found that SKU had shown genuine use of its mark, but that the BSKF mark can be registered. Judge Warren found that Shorinji Kempo is a generic term, which simply describes a martial art, and even if this were not the case, there is no possibility of confusion of the BSKF&#x27;s mark with that of the SKU.

In 2015, the International Kempo Association (IKA) was formed (and incorporated in the UK), as an umbrella organisation and loose collective for several ex-WSKO groups. It currently includes member organisations from Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland, and UK (BSKF).

<text>The Duwamish (, ) are a Lushootseed-speaking Southern Coast Salish people in western Washington, and the Indigenous people of metropolitan Seattle.

Prior to colonization, the center of Duwamish society was around the Black and Duwamish rivers in Washington. The modern Duwamish primarily descend from two separate groups: the , or Duwamish, and the , a group of peoples whose traditional territory extends around Lake Washington. Although the primary language used by the Duwamish today is English, the Duwamish historically spoke a subdialect of the southern dialect of Lushootseed, a Coast Salish language spoken throughout much of western Washington.
For centuries the Duwamish were living in at least 17 villages around the Seattle area. In 1855, the Duwamish were among the signatories of the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott, in which they ceded their land to the United States government and in return would remove to reservation lands established by the treaty. Two reservations were created for the Duwamish: the Muckleshoot and Suquamish reservations. However, no reservation was ever created directly in the Duwamish homeland. Since then, although many Duwamish did move to the reservations, many others did not, preferring to remain in their homelands, creating a schism between Duwamish descendants. Today, the Duwamish, including the modern tribes descended from the aboriginal Duwamish such as the Suquamish Nation, the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, and the unrecognized Duwamish Tribe, have been a large part of the modern history of the Seattle area, continuing to advocate for their treaty rights and the preservation and revitalization of their culture, language, and land.

Duwamish people today are enrolled in several different tribes. These include the unrecognized Duwamish Tribe and the federally recognized tribes:
* Lummi Tribe of the Lummi Reservation
* Muckleshoot Indian Tribe
* Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port Madison Reservation
* Swinomish Indian Tribal Community
* Tulalip Tribes of Washington

== Name and etymology ==
The name &quot;Duwamish&quot; is an anglicization of the Lushootseed name . The name means &quot;people inside the bay.&quot; The name refers to the Cedar River, which is called in Lushootseed, and means &quot;inside the bay.&quot; The name references the way the Duwamish villages were located inland, rather than along Puget Sound.

The name is composed of the prefix &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;toward, to,&quot; the suffix , meaning &quot;people,&quot; and the root word , a variant form of , meaning &quot;inside something relatively small.&quot; has also been spelled variantly as .

== Classification ==
The Duwamish are a Southern Coast Salish people. The Southern Coast Salish are a group of related peoples who share similar culture, history, and customs. Included in this classification are the many Lushootseed-speaking peoples and the Twana (who speak the Twana language). The broader Coast Salish are a group of related peoples who have elements of shared history and culture and speak related languages.

Prior to colonization, &quot;Duwamish&quot; () originally referred to just those from Elliot Bay and the Duwamish, Black, and Cedar Rivers. However, beginning around 1855, the word &quot;Duwamish&quot; was used to also include the Green and White river peoples and the . The were composed of several related peoples whose villages were located along Lake Washington and the Sammamish River; the &#x27;, whose villages were located around Lake Union, and the Shilshole (&#x27;), whose village was located on Salmon Bay. At the time of initial major European contact, these peoples considered themselves wholly distinct from the Duwamish.

== Territory ==
The center of Duwamish territory was historically the area at the confluence of the Black and Cedar Rivers, called the Lake Fork.

== History ==
=== Prehistory and early contact period ===
Western Washington has been permanently inhabited since at least 12,000 years ago, to the Pleistocene epoch and the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. Although it is possible that humans lived in the region before that time, the landscape was highly volcanic and unstable, leading to vast alteration of the coastline and rivers over time. Archaeological sites at the former village at West Point () date back at least 4,200 years. Villages at the mouth of the Duwamish River such as and had been continuously inhabited since the 6th century CE.

In the first half of the 19th century, the Duwamish began facing extreme raiding from the Lekwiltok and Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw, who raided much of the Puget Sound area for slaves and loot. Food resources varied, and resources were not always sufficient to last through to spring. There is evidence that an extensive trade and potlatch network evolved to help distribute resources to areas in need that varied year to year, and was potent and effective until European diseases arriving in the 1770s and ravaged the region for more than a century.

By 1851, the Duwamish had 17 villages with at least 93 buildings, including longhouses, around the present-day Seattle area. There were four prominent villages on Elliott Bay and the lower Duwamish River. Before modern civil engineering, the area at the mouth of Elliot Bay had extensive tidelands which were abundantly rich in marine life and a plentiful source of food for the Duwamish.

Duwamish contact with Europeans was sporadic until the 1850s. From the early 19th century, the maritime fur trade in the Puget Sound–Strait of Georgia regions greatly accelerated the pace of social and organizational change. American settlements at Alki Point (&quot;&quot;) and what is now Pioneer Square in Downtown Seattle were established in 1851 and 1852. From this point on, Americans settled the region at ever-increasing rates, eventually leading to the Treaty of Point Elliot in 1855.

In 1854, American ethnologist George Gibbs conducted a survey of the Indigenous peoples of Puget Sound. In this survey, he recorded 162 Duwamish people living at Lake Fork and along the Duwamish River, and 189 Duwamish and their relatives living on Lake Washington and along the Green and White rivers, for an estimated total of 351.

=== Treaty of Point Elliott and the Puget Sound War ===

The Duwamish attended and took part in the signing of the Treaty of Point Elliot on January 22, 1855, at (Point Elliott, now Mukilteo, Washington). The treaty was drawn up hastily and negotiations were conducted only in English and Chinook Jargon, a trade language which was not spoken by many attending and later deemed not suitable for diplomatic processes. This poor diplomacy created several misunderstandings and disputes between the parties that persist into the modern day. The treaty was signed by then-territorial governor Isaac Stevens and representatives from the Duwamish (led by Chief Seattle) and 14 other treaty tribes. It would not be ratified until 1859, four years after the negotiations. During that time, the unsigned treaty was used as justification for many illegal encroachments on Duwamish territory.

Due to the American government&#x27;s policy of consolidating many smaller peoples into large treaty tribes and Stevens&#x27; personal political motivations, prominent leaders were designated as chiefs for the purposes of the treaties. Signatories were appointed more or less at the behest of the Americans, bypassing what they saw as the maddening fluidity of tribal leadership. Four people represented the Duwamish on the treaty: Seattle, Ts&#x27;huahntl, Nowachais, and Hasehdooan. Seattle signed the treaty under for the Duwamish, Suquamish, and twenty-one other tribes designated as &quot;allied tribes&quot; under the Duwamish, creating the notion that he was the paramount chief of a large confederation of tribes. This did not reflect the reality of Duwamish political organization at the time. Hasehdooan/Keokuck was one of the leaders of the Black River settlements, and his signature was likely intended to serve as a signature for all the people in the core area of the Duwamish. Seattle&#x27;s signature was intended to serve for all Suquamish and Duwamish as well.

The Duwamish signed away the title to more than 54,000 acres, which today includes the cities of Seattle, Renton, Tukwila, Bellevue, and Mercer Island. Among other things, the treaty guaranteed both hunting and fishing rights, and reservations for all signatory tribes. As part of that guarantee, the Port Madison, Snohomish, Swinomish, and Lummi reservations were established as temporary reservations, and it was promised by the American side that other reservations would soon be expanded and new reservations established for other tribes. It was originally planned by the treaty commission that all tribes west of the Cascades would eventually locate to the Tulalip Reservation, including the Duwamish, and some Duwamish did indeed move to the Tulalip Reservation at the time. The then-believed temporary Port Madison reservation was established for use primarily by the Duwamish, Suquamish, and several other tribes. While many Duwamish later moved to the Port Madison reservation, including Seattle, many did not, and either never left or returned to their homelands along the Duwamish watershed to await a reservation of their own. This was due to several reasons. The Port Madison Reservation was not large enough to sustain the 1000+ individuals estimated to be assigned there, the reservation was too far from their usual and accustomed areas, and the mainland Duwamish were not on friendly terms with the Suquamish of the Port Madison area at the time.

Later that year, due to dissatisfaction with the established reservations, lack of followthrough on promises, abuse of power, and murder of Indigenous people at the hands of settlers, the Puget Sound War began. The Stkelmish village of , south of modern-day Bellevue, was used as a staging ground by the in the 1856 Battle of Seattle. The Duwamish took part in the battle on both sides, with many of the Hachuamish fighting against the Americans, and Chief Seattle aiding the settlers in the siege.

In August 1856, the Fox Island Council was held to address the grievances held by people after the treaty. There, Isaac Stevens agreed to establish a reservation, the Muckleshoot reservation, for the Duwamish and other tribes living along the Duwamish watershed, including the White and Green rivers, in hopes that the remaining Duwamish would move to the reservation. The reservation was understood by the Indigenous people at the meeting to consist of a wedge of land between the White and Green rivers, however the official documents only include the area of today&#x27;s reservation. It was created in 1857 by executive order.

=== Reservation era (late 19th century) ===
In the years following, most of the remaining Duwamish moved from their historical homelands along Lake Washington and along the Duwamish and Cedar Rivers to the Suquamish Reservation, with others moving to the Muckleshoot and Tulalip reservations, although some still stayed behind, refusing to move. Some of those who remained assimilated into white society. This period led to the modern split between the Duwamish descendants: the Muckleshoot, Suquamish, and eponymous Duwamish tribes. The remaining Duwamish were expelled from the town of Seattle following the passage of Town of Seattle Ordinance No. 5.

Efforts were made to increase the size of the already existing reservations or create another reservation for the Duwamish to accommodate the influx of people. G. A. Paige, the Indian Agent in charge of the Port Madison reservation, wrote in 1857 that a reservation should be established at the Lake Fork, as requested by the Duwamish. Around that time, around 150 Duwamish had requested to speak to Isaac Stevens about the creation of a reservation, and he promised to them that &quot;if he were properly informed about their situation&quot; he would create a reservation for them. In 1864, the Port Madison reservation was enlarged by executive order at the request of Seattle and a delegation of other natives. Proposals were made by the US Superintendent of Indian Affairs in 1866 to create another reservation in the Duwamish homeland near what is now Renton and Tukwila, but American settlers wrote to Arthur Denny, the territorial delegate to congress, complaining about the proposal. Denny himself signed the complaint petition, as well as David Denny, Henry Yesler, David &quot;Doc&quot; Maynard, and virtually all of Seattle&#x27;s establishment, saying that &quot;such a reservation would do a great injustice&quot; and be &quot;of little value to the Indians.&quot; The petition was forwarded to the BIA and subsequently, the proposal was blocked later that year. In 1868 President Andrew Johnson was recommended to sign an executive order to designate all land between the Green and White rivers as part of the Muckleshoot reservation. However, the order was either misplaced or set aside, and no action was taken. The Muckleshoot reservation was eventually expanded by executive order in 1874, in order to provide a home for the other Duwamish living on the lower Duwamish drainage system.

After the 1860s, the Duwamish who remained off-reservation continued to live in their traditional communities along Lake Washington and the Black, Cedar, White, and Green rivers. Traditional longhouses were built at these sites into the mid-1800s. One such settlement was located at the confluence of the Black and Cedar rivers. The settlement was led by William (also known as Stoda), the most powerful political leader of the Duwamish from the mid-1800s until his death. William led both the Duwamish at the confluence, and on the reservations, keeping their political integrity intact. William brought Duwamish from the still-existing Duwamish villages, as well as those living on the Port Madison and Muckleshoot reservations, to a sing gamble ceremony in 1894. After his death in 1896, the off-reservation Duwamish community began to move to new white settlements. By 1910, all known independent Duwamish settlements had disappeared. This was greatly effected by Ordinance No. 5, which in 1865 banned Native Americans from living in the city unless housed and employed by a white settler, and also by the repeated burning of still-existing Duwamish settlements.

By this time, all Duwamish were either living on reservations or as part of white settlements. However, William Rogers (the nephew of William/Stoda) and Charles Satiacum continued the sociopolitical relationships between individual Duwamish both on and off the reservation. In 1915, in cooperation with the Northwest Federation of American Indians, they produced a list of 361 Duwamish people, on and off-reservation, who were part of the &quot;Duwamish Tribe of Indians&quot; led by them, chief and sub-chief, respectively.

In 1925, another group of Duwamish descendants organized as the Duwamish Tribal Organization. While the earlier 1915 organization was primarily composed of people who had lived in or descended from the Duwamish communities in the area, the Duwamish Tribal Organization&#x27;s initial membership was primarily (71%) composed of people descended from early mixed-race marriages in the 1850s, but otherwise had little to no contact with extant Duwamish communities at the time.

In the early 1900s, many Duwamish had converted to the Indian Shaker Church, a local religion of mixed Christian and Indigenous beliefs. Since then, the primary religion of the Duwamish has been Christianity, albeit of several different denominations.

=== Modern history ===
Much of the 20th- and 21st-century history of the Duwamish has been marked by a struggle for defending treaty rights and claims. In 1962, the Duwamish were awarded $62,000 for their land claims. In 1974, &quot;United States v. Washington&quot; (commonly known as the Boldt Decision), ruled that federally-recognized tribes in the state of Washington have rights to 50% of the fishing harvest, as guaranteed by the treaties. The ruling was appealed and upheld in 1979. Duwamish descendants enrolled in the federally recognized tribes had fishing rights; however, the Duwamish Tribe, as they are unrecognized, were not included in the Boldt Decision.

The Duwamish Tribe themselves have also been working towards federal recognition. In 1977, the Duwamish Tribe filed a petition for federal recognition.

The Duwamish continue to be involved in Seattle&#x27;s urban Indian culture and are represented in institutions such as United Indians of All Tribes and the Seattle Indian Health Board.

Federally-recognized tribes such as the Muckleshoot and Suquamish as well as the Duwamish Tribe have worked closely with the city of Seattle to promote and develop and preserve local Native culture and history, both for the Duwamish, and non-Duwamish urban Indians. As of late 2022, Indigenous businesses have begun to open in Seattle, including ʔálʔal Cafe, which uses local ingredients and shares traditional Native American dishes from around North America.

The Duwamish also work with nearby cities to preserve and protect their history. The Duwamish Hill Preserve in Tukwila is a culturally significant space in traditional stories and served as a historical vantage point. In addition, the Renton History Museum in Renton, Washington, has a small exhibit on the archaeological and cultural history of the Duwamish.

== Traditional culture and society ==
=== The village ===
Like many other Coast Salish societies, traditional Duwamish society was dominated by the village. It was the basis of societal organization for the Puget Sound peoples and, in the pre-contact period, the village was the highest form of social organization. Each village had one or more cedar plank longhouses housing one or more extended families. Longhouses were often divided into sections by dividers made of cattail or cedar, with each family having their own section of the house with a fire pit in the center of the section. A single longhouse could support as few as tens of people, to as many as hundreds of people.

The Duwamish, a primarily riverine people, built most of their villages along the , today the Duwamish, Black, and Cedar Rivers. The , on the other hand, were primarily lake-oriented peoples and their villages were mostly located along Lake Washington and Lake Union.

Although the village was the highest form of social cohesion, it was not centralized. There were no formal organs of government or authority which ruled over a village. Although members of the Duwamish have been historically called &quot;chiefs,&quot; the Duwamish (along with other Puget Sound peoples) did not have chiefs. Rather, that term was bestowed upon important individuals of local villages by members of the United States government and the general public. In reality, authority was entrusted to high-status individuals when called for, such as leading a war party, constructing a house, or gathering berries. The highest-status male of the highest-status family in a village was generally seen as the leader of the village for most purposes, and this position fluctuated often.

Longhouse architecture continues to be used to this day in cultural settings. An example is the north face of the Burke Museum at the University of Washington. More recently, the design of the main hall of the Duwamish Longhouse and Cultural Center closely echoes a traditional longhouse.

=== Social organization ===
For most of their history, the Duwamish were not a unified tribe. Instead, villages were completely autonomous, linked by shared language, culture, location, and family. While some villages held higher status and had a certain influence over others, there was no official authority of one village over another.

Duwamish villages, due to their geographical and familial closeness, were historically tightly allied within their drainage. Duwamish villages also were closely allied with their neighbors, such as the Hachuamish, the Sammamish, the Snoqualmie, the Stkamish, the Puyallup, the Homamish, Suquamish, and many more. As marrying distant peoples to get unique access to far-away resources was ideal, some Duwamish intermarried and allied with peoples as far away as the Stillaguamish. Good marriages gave prestige and could result in the gain of material wealth.

Intermarriage between villages created a large trade network stretching across much of the Pacific Northwest, extending up into what is now British Columbia and over the Cascade Range. The Puget Sound was the primary waterway connecting the Lushootseed-speaking peoples with the rest of the world, allowing swift water travel across great distances.

Duwamish society was divided into an upper class, lower class, and slave class. Each of these classes were largely hereditary, although social movement did happen. Nobility was based on impeccable genealogy, inter-tribal kinship, wise use of resources, and possession of esoteric knowledge about the workings of spirits and the spirit world, making an effective marriage of class, secular, religious, and economic power. There were physical distinctions for high-status individuals: mothers carefully shaped the heads of their young babies, binding them with cradle boards just long enough to produce a steep sloping forehead.

== Successor tribes ==
Today, Duwamish people are primarily enrolled in the federally recognized tribes, the Lummi Tribe of the Lummi Reservation, Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port Madison Reservation, Swinomish Indian Tribal Community, and Tulalip Tribes of Washington, and the unrecognized Duwamish Tribe. They are all located in western Washington. The Muckleshoot Tribe and the Suquamish Nation are the federally recognized successors-in-interest to the aboriginal Duwamish, and the Duwamish Tribe is seeking recognition as one of the successors to the aboriginal Duwamish as well.

=== Duwamish Tribe ===

The Duwamish Tribe is an unrecognized tribe based in Seattle, Washington which has been seeking federal recognition as the Duwamish Indian Tribe.

In 1925, the Duwamish Tribal Organization (commonly known as the Duwamish Tribe) was formed, where they drafted a constitution, wrote bylaws, and implemented structure for the organization. To this day, they are not recognized as a tribe by the U.S. federal government or the state of Washington. Until 1974, the Duwamish Tribe mostly pursued land claims agreements in court, entitled to treaty tribes by Congress. They first and unsuccessfully attempted to pursue claims against the Court of Claims and in Congress in 1934, however, in 1962, they were successful in submitting a claim to the Indian Claims Commission.

They have sought and been denied federal recognition by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1996, 2015, and 2019. In 2001, they were briefly granted recognition by an executive order from President Bill Clinton as he left office. However, it was reversed less than two days later as the incoming President George W. Bush cancelled the many executive orders Clinton signed in his final days citing &quot;procedural errors.&quot; Most recently, in May 2022, they once again sued the Department of the Interior for recognition.

In 2022, the Duwamish Tribe sued for federal recognition in &quot;The Duwamish Tribe et al. v. Haaland&quot; &quot;et al.&quot;, which is still being heard in Washington Western District Court as of 2023. Representatives of the Muckleshoot, Suquamish, Tulalip and Puyallup tribes have voiced their opposition to federal recognition for the Duwamish Tribe, pointing out that many Duwamish people are enrolled in their tribes.

The Duwamish tribe owns and operates several services and organizations. In 1979, the Duwamish Tribe established the Duwamish Tribal Services, a 501(c) nonprofit organization which provides social services to the organization&#x27;s members. In addition, the Duwamish Tribe constructed the on purchased land along Marginal Way, across from Terminal 107 Park. It is built near the site of the former village .

In 1991, the Duwamish Tribe had about 400 members, and in 2019, they had about 600 members. Since 1975, the tribe has been led by Chairwoman Cecile Hansen, an enrolled member of the Suquamish Tribe and the great-great-grandniece of Chief Seattle.

=== Muckleshoot Indian Tribe ===

The Muckleshoot Indian Tribe is a federally-recognized tribe located in Auburn, Washington. They are descended from the Duwamish and several other related peoples whose territories were mostly located along the Duwamish River watershed. They are one of the largest tribes in Washington state with a population of over 3,000.

Their reservation was established by the 1856 Fox Island Council, and is located mostly along the White River. The Muckleshoot Tribe was created by the merger of the tribes living on the Muckleshoot Reservation after the 1934 Wheeler-Howard Act (also known as the Indian Reorganization Act). They operate several tribal businesses, casinos, schools, and other services, and they work closely with state, federal, and city affairs in the Seattle area and beyond.

<text>Jorn Barger (; born 1953) is an American blogger, best known as editor of &quot;Robot Wisdom&quot;, an early weblog. He has written extensively on James Joyce and artificial intelligence, among other subjects; his writing is almost entirely self-published.

==Life==
Born 1953 in Yellow Springs, Ohio, as the second child of Rex Barger and Criss Barger Stange, Jorn Barger spent his childhood in his hometown. At age 11 he got to use an early programmable digital computer, the Minivac 601. His family moved to Bemus Point, New York, in 1966.

He graduated high school a year early and attended Jamestown Community College, Antioch College, New College of Florida and University at Buffalo without earning a degree. In 1973 he decided against a career in computing and &quot;worked on self-discovery&quot; instead for the next six years. During this period, in 1978, he lived for six months at The Farm, Stephen Gaskin&#x27;s intentional community in Tennessee.

During the first half of the 1980s he programmed games and educational software for the Apple II, Commodore 64, and Atari 8-bit computers. From 1989 to the end of 1992, Barger worked as a research programmer at Northwestern University&#x27;s Institute for the Learning Sciences under the artificial intelligence researcher Roger Schank. He is not known to have held regular employment since and supports himself with &quot;odd bits of contract work.&quot;

Previously a longtime resident of the Rogers Park neighborhood in Chicago, Barger was living in Socorro, New Mexico as of late 2003. He has a daughter named Elizabeth.

==Usenet==
Barger has been an active Usenet participant since 1989, with &quot;nearly ten thousand postings&quot;. He wrote early FAQs on ASCII art, Kate Bush, Thomas Pynchon, and James Joyce. In 1994 he proposed the idea of the &quot;Inverse Law of Usenet Bandwidth&quot;: &quot;The more interesting your life becomes, the less you post... and vice versa.&quot; As an &quot;unstoppable Usenet poster who could carry on simultaneous debates about Ibsen, Chomsky, artificial intelligence, and Kate Bush,&quot; he became an &quot;online legend&quot; who would also get cited in the national press as an expert on Usenet.

==Weblog==
Barger started Robot Wisdom in February 1995, publishing essays and resources on James Joyce, AI, history, Internet culture, hypertext design, and technology trends. Announcements of plans for a future &quot;hardcopy edition&quot; of &quot;Robot Wisdom&quot; for purchase began appearing at the foot of some of the site&#x27;s pages.

On December 17, 1997, inspired by Dave Winer&#x27;s Scripting News and running on Winer&#x27;s Frontier publishing software, Barger began posting daily entries to his &quot;Robot Wisdom Weblog&quot; in the hope of finding &quot;an audience who might see the connections between [his] many interests.&quot; These postings featured &quot;a list of links each day shaped by his own interests in the arts and technology,&quot; thus offering a &quot;day-to-day log of his reading and intellectual pursuits&quot; and coining the term &quot;weblog&quot; as a novel form of web publishing. The term was shortened to &quot;blog&quot; by Peter Merholz in 1999.

Barger has also described his intentions in terms of exploration and discovery: to elucidate &quot;what treasures were there&quot; and to &quot;make the web as a whole more transparent,&quot; a weblog needed to provide a constantly updated and well-described stream of the &quot;best web links.&quot; Robot Wisdom&#x27;s Net.literate portal, which started in July 1998, was a human-edited web directory that served as a complement to Barger&#x27;s weblog and aimed to provide the best links on a wide range of topics arranged in ten categories.

&quot;Robot Wisdom Weblog&quot; acquired a large and enthusiastic following: after a computing newsletter had celebrated the weblog as &quot;offbeat,&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; described it as &quot;one of the best collections of news and musings culled from the Web,&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; called Barger &quot;a highly observant and thoughtful surfer at work&quot; and named his site &quot;one of the most popular weblogs.&quot; &quot;InfoWorld&quot; counted it among the very few weblogs that were &quot;worth a visit,&quot; &quot;Brill&#x27;s Content&quot; claimed that it presented &quot;news the way web pioneers envisioned it—hypertextual, wide-reaching, and exhaustive,&quot; &quot;Fast Company&quot; called it &quot;one of the best Web logs on the Net,&quot; &quot;Feed&quot; wrote that the site was &quot;frequented by thousands of the Net&#x27;s most knowledgeable,&quot; &quot;Wired&quot; hailed it as &quot;one of the oldest and most popular weblogs,&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; commended Barger&#x27;s &quot;healthy appetite for everything from literature to science,&quot; whereas &quot;The Register&quot; found that &quot;there&#x27;s no better reader on the Internet than Jorn Barger.&quot; The contents of Robot Wisdom Weblog in its heyday have been recalled as a &quot;mesmerizing sequence of arcana&quot; and a &quot;cornucopia of offbeat delights.&quot;

Barger has also been recognized for his contribution to the emergence of the blogosphere. He was nominated among the &quot;visionaries who changed the face of the Web in 1998&quot; in CNET&#x27;s &quot;Web Innovator Awards&quot; for having &quot;inspired the Web Log community.&quot; Barger&#x27;s work has been judged &quot;seminal,&quot; and he reportedly &quot;set the tone for a million blogs to come.&quot; An ACM paper discusses Barger and Chris Gulker, along with other early bloggers such as Raphael Carter, as the originators of blogging as a networked practice.

In September 1999, Barger posted one of the first in-depth examinations of weblogs, the &quot;Weblog FAQ,&quot; and he led a weblog forum between August 1999 and April 2000.

In December 1999, Barger linked to a passage by anti-zionist critic Israel Shahak, which drew a concerned response from a fellow blogger and led to allegations of anti-Semitism. Subsequently, criticism of Israel and Judaism became a staple of Robot Wisdom Weblog and the site came to carry slogans in the header banner, such as &quot;judaism is racism is incompatible with democracy,&quot; that many readers and fellow bloggers found &quot;objectionable.&quot; Along with a reduced posting schedule and intermittent cessation of updates after 2000, Barger&#x27;s unexpected anti-Israel turn has been cited as a main contributing factor to a &quot;slow fade-out&quot; of the site&#x27;s popularity and reputation.

Robot Wisdom has stopped updating or gone offline repeatedly for protracted periods of time. By December 2001, Barger was experiencing financial difficulties that he announced would cause an interruption in keeping &quot;Robot Wisdom&quot; online. The site then went offline for a couple of months. Barger allowed his domain registration to lapse in early 2005, but managed to bring the site back online a few weeks later. Robot Wisdom went offline again in late January 2007. On 10 February, Barger placed a note on his Robot Wisdom Auxiliary weblog soliciting $10 (US) donations, payable to his web host, to help &quot;save robotwisdom.com&quot;. By 12 February, Robotwisdom.com was online again.

Barger has experimented with monetizing &quot;Robot Wisdom&quot; soliciting advertisements in 2000, and, in 2005, donations via PayPal, yet never made &quot;any money from his Web log.&quot;

==On James Joyce==
Barger seeks to establish a &quot;connection between artificial intelligence and the masterworks of James Joyce,&quot; whom he refers to as a master of descriptive psychology. He has studied Joyce&#x27;s notebooks and manuscripts for &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot; He has also prepared an online &quot;shorter&quot; annotated version of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. Barger&#x27;s website has been cited for &quot;extensive research into the &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; manuscripts,&quot; yet very little of this work has passed academic peer review. As a result, it can sometimes be difficult to tell what is agreed upon by Joyce scholars and what is Barger&#x27;s conjecture. Barger seemed to acknowledge this when he published his list of &quot;50+ Joycean Conjectures&quot;.

Barger has contributed one book chapter on Finnegans Wake and a book review in the &quot;James Joyce Quarterly&quot;.

<doc id="316560" wikidata="Q732738" url="?curid=316560" title="Maine (province)">
<text>Maine () is one of the traditional provinces of France. It corresponds to the former County of Maine, whose capital was also the city of Le Mans. The area, now divided into the departments of Sarthe and Mayenne, has about 857,000 inhabitants.

==History==

=== Antiquity ===
The Gallic tribe Aulerci Cenomani lived in the region during the Iron Age and Roman period. The province of Maine was named after them, in the 6th century AD as &quot;in Cinomanico&quot; (&quot;in&quot; &quot;pago Celmanico&quot; in 765, &quot;*Cemaine&quot;, then &quot;Le Maine&quot; from the 12th century).

=== Early Middle Ages ===
In the 8th and 9th centuries, there existed a Duchy of Cénomannie (ducatus Cenomannicus), which several of the Carolingian kings used as an appanage. This duchy was a march that may have included several counties including Maine, and extended into Lower Normandy, all the way to the Seine. In 748, Pepin the Short, then Mayor of the Palace and thus the most powerful man in Francia after the king, gave this duchy to his half-brother Grifo. In 790 Charlemagne in turn gave it to his younger son, Charles the Younger. Charlemagne&#x27;s grandson, the future Charles the Bald, and his son Louis the Stammerer inherited the title. The son-in-law of Charlemagne, Rorgon, was the count of Maine between 832 and 839. In the last half of the 9th century, Maine took on strategic importance because of invasions from Normandy and Brittany. Rorgon&#x27;s son Gauzfrid in turn became Count of Maine. He fought against Salomon, King of Brittany and in 866 participated in the battle of Brissarthe alongside Robert the Strong, the Frankish Margrave of Neustria. When Gauzfrid died, Charles the Bald granted the title, as well as the county and the wider Neustrian march to Ragenold of Neustria, because Gauzfrid&#x27;s children were too young to act in that capacity. Ragenold, who may have been the son of Renaud d&#x27;Herbauges, died in 885 fighting the Vikings who were pillaging Rouen.

King Rudolph of France is said to have given Maine to the Norse nobleman Rollo, Duke of Normandy, in 924.

=== High Middle Ages ===
==== Angevin period (c. 1000–1063) ====
Bordering the county of Anjou to the south and the Duchy of Normandy to the north, Maine became a bone of contention between the rulers of these more powerful principalities. Hugh III of Maine (ruled c. 991–c. 1015) was forced to recognize Fulk III, Count of Anjou as his overlord.

Sometime between 1045 and 1047 Hugh IV married Bertha, daughter of Odo II, Count of Blois and widow of Alan III, Duke of Brittany. The Angevins did not want Maine to come under the influence of Blois, and Count Geoffrey Martel invaded Maine. But the Normans did not want Maine to return to the Angevin orbit, so were pulled into the conflict. The precise chronology is disputed, but it is clear that in 1051 Hugh IV died and the citizens of Le Mans opened their gate to the Angevins. Anjou wound up with effective control of most of the county, but the Normans did take several important strongholds on the Maine–Normandy border.

==== Norman conquest and rule (1062–1070) ====
Hugh IV&#x27;s son Herbert II fled to the Norman court (though some historians say he was under Angevin control for a few years first) and his death in 1062 precipitated a succession crisis. 
Herbert died childless in 1062 after declaring William the Bastard, then Duke of Normandy, his heir. His sister Marguerite was engaged to William&#x27;s eldest son, Robert Curthose and Herbert had taken refuge at William&#x27;s court in 1056 when Geoffrey Martel, Duke of Anjou, invaded Le Mans.

While the county was in Angevin hands, Anjou had its own succession problem. Duke William of Normandy claimed the county on their behalf of Herbert&#x27;s young sister Margaret, betrothed to his son Robert Curthose. The other claimant was Herbert&#x27;s aunt Biota, a sister of Hugh IV, and her husband Walter, Count of the Vexin. William invaded Maine in force in 1063 and despite stiff opposition from Fulk IV, Count of Anjou and from local barons such as Geoffrey of Mayenne and Hubert de Sainte-Suzanne, he controlled the county by the beginning of 1064. Biota and Walter were captured at the taking of Le Mans. They died sometime later in 1063, poisoned, it was rumoured, though there is no hard evidence for this. Norman control of Maine secured the southern border of Normandy against Anjou and is one factor which enabled William to launch his successful invasion of England in 1066.

In 1069 the citizens of Le Mans revolted against the Normans. Soon some of the Manceaux barons joined the revolt, the Normans were expelled in 1070, and young Hugh V was proclaimed Count of Maine.

==== Independent period (1070–1129) ====
Hugh was the son of Azzo d&#x27;Este and his wife Gersendis, the other sister of Count Hugh IV. Azzo returned to Italy, leaving Gersendis in charge. The real power, however, was one of the Manceaux barons, Geoffrey of Mayenne, who may also have been Gersendis&#x27; lover. After Norman attacks in 1073, 1088, 1098 and 1099, Elias I succeeded his cousin Hugh V, who sold Maine to him in 1092 for ten thousand shillings. His daughter married Fulk V, Count of Anjou, who took Maine over in 1110 after the death of Elias. Henri Beauclerc, agreed to recognize him as Count of Maine so long as he acknowledged the Duke of Normandy as his overlord.

==== Plantagenet period (1129–1204) ====
Fulk&#x27;s son Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou inherited Maine. When Geoffrey died in 1151, it passed to his son, King Henry II of England. Since Henry had been Duke of Normandy since 1150, Anjou, Maine, and Normandy all had the same ruler for the first time. Henry later founded the Plantagenet dynasty in England.

When Richard the Lionheart, ruler of England, Normandy, Aquitaine, Anjou, Brittany, Maine and Touraine, collectively known as the Angevin Empire, died in 1199, it sparked a war of succession that lasted until 1204. While John Lackland managed to become recognised as King of England, the Plantagenet holdings of Normandy, Touraine, Anjou and Maine were invaded and conquered by King Philip II of France. During the invasion, the French seneschal William des Roches took Touraine, Anjou and Maine on behalf of the French king.

=== Late Middle Ages ===
In 1331 the Count of Maine became a peer of the realm.

After the Battle of Verneuil in 1424, the English occupied Maine, and John of Lancaster took the title of Duke. The English held Le Mans until 1448 and Fresnay until 1449. In 1481, Charles IV, Duke of Anjou bequeathed his lands to Louis XI of France, thus returning the county to the crown.

=== French Revolution ===

At the beginning, a part of the Maine population supported the French Revolution that took place in Paris. The extension of it and the general opposition of the other European countries provoked a war, that forced the authorities of the new founded French Republic to engage soldiers to fight against its European enemies. The growing need of soldiers had bad consequences in the Maine, the south of Normandy and the eastern part of Brittany: Young men refused to join the army and preferred to disappear and hide themselves. They organized a sort of secret army and they got the name of Chouans, from the nickname of their chief, Jean Cottereau. With such chiefs, Maine became quickly the centre of Chouan counter-revolution. They found local support everywhere among the peasants, who were shocked by the way the administration and the army treated the priests and the Roman Catholic religion.

=== Modern times ===
During the French Revolution Maine became part of the new created &quot;départements&quot; Mayenne and Sarthe, now they are incorporated together in the Pays de la Loire Region.

<text>Larry Hovis (February 20, 1936 – September 9, 2003) was an American singer and actor best known for the 1960s television sitcom &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Hovis was born in Wapato, Washington, and moved to Houston, Texas, as a small child. Wapato is within the external boundaries of the Yakama Nation and is not a part of the Yakama Indian Reservation. As a youth, he was a singer, appearing on Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s &quot;Talent Scouts&quot;. Hovis attended the University of Houston. During the mid-1950s, Hovis sang in nightclubs with groups including the Mascots. He wrote songs and signed with Capitol Records, which released one album. His biggest song was &quot;We Could Have Lots of Fun&quot;. He was part of the Houston-based Bill Gannon Trio and appears on their 1959 Carlton album, &quot;Sweet Singing Swing&quot;.
After his 1966 screenplay credit in the Universal film &quot;Out of Sight&quot;, Hovis began appearing in local theater productions. After some success, he moved to New York City in 1959 and appeared in the 1960 Broadway revue &quot;From A to Z&quot;, which showcased his singing and comedy talents.

==Television==
Hovis moved to California in 1963, where he performed comedy and tried to break into television. In 1964, he was discovered by Andy Griffith&#x27;s manager and was hired to appear on the TV series &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, where he played &quot;Pvt. Larry Gotschalk&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show.&quot;

In 1965, when another actor backed out of the television show &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, Hovis was cast as &quot;Sgt. Andrew Carter&quot;, a POW in a German prison camp who was an expert on explosives. In the pilot episode, Carter was a lieutenant, and was only going to appear in that one episode. For the series, the character became Sgt. Carter, replacing a character played by Leonid Kinskey in the pilot. (Kinskey decided after the pilot that he did not want to stay with a show that had actors pretending to be Nazis.) In the series, Carter was of partial Sioux ancestry. A few sources say that Hovis was partly of Yakama Indian ancestry, but no documentation supports his membership within the Yakama Nation. Later, in an episode of the comedy &quot;Alice&quot;, Hovis played an American Indian police detective who arrests a fake American Indian conman.

While Hovis was a regular on &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, he also did other work in the entertainment industry, including writing the screenplay for the 1966 spy-spoof &quot;Out of Sight&quot;. He also co-wrote Mitzi Gaynor&#x27;s 1968 and 1969 television specials, and appeared in and wrote comedy bits for &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;.

==After &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;==
Even before &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; was canceled in 1971, Hovis had already made appearances on other TV shows.

In the mid-1970s, Hovis made appearances on the game show &quot;Match Game&quot; and the comedy series &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; alongside his &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; castmate. Richard Dawson, Later in the decade, he produced and was a regular panelist on the game show &quot;Liar&#x27;s Club&quot;.

From 1979 to 1981, Hovis toured in the musical &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; as Melvin P. Thorpe. In 1982, Hovis was a writer/producer on the show &quot;So You Think You Got Troubles&quot;, which was hosted by actor and ventriloquist Jay Johnson. Later in the decade, Hovis teamed up with Gary Bernstein to form Bernstein-Hovis Productions, which produced the game shows &quot;Anything for Money&quot;, the original version of &quot;Lingo&quot; and the short-lived &quot;Yahtzee&quot;, a TV version of the classic dice game, for which Hovis also announced and served as a regular panelist.

Hovis was hired as a co-producer for the hidden-camera television show &quot;Totally Hidden Video&quot;, but was fired by Fox executives who conducted an investigation of the pilot episode’s segments and found that 3 of 4 taped segments included paid actors and scripted content. The investigation was initially prompted by a lawsuit filed by &quot;Candid Camera&quot; creator Allen Funt, alleging that the new series was copying old &quot;Candid Camera&quot; situational contrivances.

Beginning in the 1990s, Hovis taught drama at Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas – now called Texas State University-San Marcos.

==Death==
Hovis died of esophageal cancer in Austin, Texas, on September 9, 2003. He was 67 years old.

<text>This is an overview of the [[postage stamp]]s and [[postal history]] of [[Denmark]].

== Early postal history ==
Denmark&#x27;s postal history begins with an ordinance of 24 December 1624 by King Christian IV, establishing a national postal service . This service consisted of nine main routes, and was to be operated by the mayor of Copenhagen and several guilds. Initially the mail was carried by foot, with riders being used after 1640.

The service was turned over to a Paul Klingenberg on 16 July 1653, who introduced a number of innovations, including mail coaches able to carry parcels, and service to Norway. He ran the service until 14 March 1685, when he handed it over to Count Christian Gyldenløve, an eleven-year-old son of King Christian V. The Gyldenløve family continued in control until 1711; in 1694 new routes and rates were established. The state took over control in 1711.

The first steamship carrying mail was the SS &quot;Caledonia&quot;, which began carrying mail between Copenhagen and Kiel on 1 July 1819.


== The classic stamps ==
The first postage stamps were introduced on 1 April 1851, by a law passed on 11 March. The first value was a four (&quot;Fire&quot;) rigsbankskilling stamp printed in brown, a square design with a crown, sword, and sceptre in the center. This was followed on 1 May by a 2rbs value in blue using the denomination as the design. Both stamps were typographed, watermarked (with a crown), and imperforate, and distinctive for having a yellow-brown burelage printed on top of the design. The 2rbs prepaid the local postage rate in København, while the 4rbs was the national rate. Four rbs stamps were introduced on 1 May 1851 for use in the Duchy of Slesvig.

The design and first printings were made by M. W. Ferslew, but he died and the subsequent printing was by H. H. Thiele, whose firm printed Denmark&#x27;s stamps for the next 80 years.

Few of the 2rbs values were printed, and today copies are priced at around 3,000 US$ unused and $1,000 used. The 4rbs was more common, with unused at $700 and used copies at just $40.

In 1854 the currency was renamed to just &quot;skilling&quot; and &quot;rigsdaler&quot;, and new stamps were printed, still square and using the coat of arms, but with the new currency names, and the inscriptions abbreviated so that they could be read as either Danish or German (&quot;FRM&quot; instead of &quot;FRIMAERKE&quot; for instance). Values of 2s, 4s, 8s, and 16s were issued at various times from 1854 to 1857. In 1858 the dotted pattern in the background was replaced with wavy lines, in 1863 a larger crown was used in the watermark and the stamps were rouletted.

Along with postage stamps, the use of numeral cancellations was adopted, consisting of a number with several concentric circles, each number corresponding to a particular post office. &quot;1&quot; was Copenhagen, &quot;2&quot; the office in Hamburg, &quot;5&quot; Aarhus, and so forth.

The Second War of Schleswig in 1864 was a traumatic loss for Denmark, and immediately after it a new issue of stamps featured the traditional symbols of royalty more prominently than the previous issues. Values of 2s, 3s, 4s, 8s, and 16s came out between May 1864 and 1868. These were the first Danish stamps to be perforated.

== Numeral issues ==
In 1870 the first of the long-running &quot;numeral&quot; issue appeared. The design was an oval with the denomination in large numerals in the center, surrounded by an ornate frame in a different color. The frame is very nearly symmetric, but not entirely, and the sharp-eyed can identify the stamps with inverted frames. Some of the inverts are quite common, the employees at the printing plant presumably also having difficulties knowing which way was up.

In 1873, the currency was changed to the decimal kroner, which necessitated new stamps. The perforation spacing was changed in 1895, and the watermark in 1902.

Meanwhile, in 1882 the Universal Postal Union standardized on particular colors of stamps for international mail. The &quot;Arms type&quot; was designed to meet this requirement; the 5 øre printed in green, and the 20 øre in blue, followed up in 1885 by a 10 øre in red.

== 20th century ==
In 1904, King Christian IX became the first king of Denmark to be depicted on a stamp.

In the following year, a new type of numeral design appeared for the lower values - denomination in an oval with three wavy lines on each side, representing the three waters separating the largest Danish islands. This design proved so popular that variations on it remain in use .

In 1907, the Christian IX design was updated with a portrait of the new King, Frederik VIII.

In 1912, several types of stamps were surcharged to 35 øre. In the same year, Denmark&#x27;s first pictorial stamp was a 5-kroner issue depicting the Copenhagen General Post Office.

King Christian X appeared in profile between 1913 and 1928, in a long-lived series that featured a number of color and value changes.

In 1918, a need for 27 øre value resulted in surcharges on newspaper stamps, some of which are scarce, with prices today of up to 200 US$.

On 5 October 1920, Denmark&#x27;s first commemorative stamps, a set of three pictorials, marked the reunion of northern Schleswig with Denmark following a plebiscite. 1924 saw commemoratives for the 300th anniversary of the postal service, and in 1926 the original two designs were adapted for an issue noting the 75th anniversary of their introduction.

In 1927 a set of six stamps depicted a caravel, modeled after an old engraving. The 1927 set was typographed; from 1933 to 1940 the design was reissued with the use of engraving instead. The engraved design was soon changed to reduce the left-side margin, with the &quot;Type IIs&quot; having only one column of squares between sail and frame line, where the &quot;Type Is&quot; have two columns. (Both types are common today, except for the type I 25o blue.)

During World War II, Germany occupied Denmark, but the stamp program gives no evidence of that. A new series depicted Christian X full-face instead of in profile, and continued in use after the war. However mail was subject to German postal censorship.

In 1946, a new design appeared for high values; the three lions of the state seal. Like the wavy lines design, this design remained in regular use for the highest denominations into the 1990s.

In 1976 Denmark handed over responsibility for the postal service in the Faroe Islands to Postverk Føroya.

== Modern issues ==
The modern stamp program of Denmark tends to use relatively small stamps produced using engraving. While the quality is high, engraving limits the range of colors available, and so the use of lithography has been creeping into issues, often in addition to engraving. The number of issued stamps has gradually climbed, from 5–10 per year in the 1960s, to around 20 annually in the 1990s, with several thematic sets (usually of four stamps each) per year.

== Postal stationery ==
Postal stationery envelopes were produced in Denmark from 21 December 1864 till 1967; during which time a total of 78 different items were produced. Envelopes were only produced in two values to cover the first weight class for both the local rate and the inland rate. The local postal rate for letters was discontinued after 1 April 1957.

The first letter cards were issued on 3 September 1888. By the time production ceased in 1979 a total of 83 different items had been issued. The postal rates were the same as the envelopes. Letter cards were available at both a local rate and an inland rate. The local rate was discontinued after 1 April 1957.

Postcards first made their appearance in 1871 and are still being produced currently.

Reply-paid postcards or double postcards were in use from 1883 till 1967. Till 1886 they could only be used for inland purposes or to selected countries with whom Denmark had an agreement for their use. From 1886 these cards could be sent to any country in the UPU.

From 28 May 1872 newspaper wrappers were available in three different rates – local, inland and foreign in the first weight class. Newspaper wrappers were discontinued after 1965, during which time a total of 50 different wrappers were issued.

Aerogrammes were first introduced on 9 October 1949 and continue to be available to date.

<text>A launch pad is an above-ground facility from which a rocket-powered missile or space vehicle is vertically launched. The term &quot;launch pad&quot; can be used to describe just the central launch platform (mobile launcher platform), or the entire complex (launch complex). The entire complex will include a &quot;launch mount&quot; or &quot;launch platform&quot; to physically support the vehicle, a service structure with umbilicals, and the infrastructure required to provide propellants, cryogenic fluids, electrical power, communications, telemetry, rocket assembly, payload processing, storage facilities for propellants and gases, equipment, access roads, and drainage.

Most launch pads include fixed service structures to provide one or more access platforms to assemble, inspect, and maintain the vehicle and to allow access to the spacecraft, including the loading of crew. The pad may contain a flame deflection structure to prevent the intense heat of the rocket exhaust from damaging the vehicle or pad structures, and a sound suppression system spraying large quantities of water may be employed. The pad may also be protected by lightning arresters. A spaceport typically includes multiple launch complexes and other supporting infrastructure.

A launch pad is distinct from a missile launch facility (or missile silo or missile complex), which also launches a missile vertically but is located underground in order to help harden it against enemy attack. 

The launch complex for liquid fueled rockets often has extensive ground support equipment including propellant tanks and plumbing to fill the rocket before launch. Cryogenic propellants (liquid oxygen oxidizer, and liquid hydrogen or liquid methane fuel) need to be continuously topped off (i.e., boil-off replaced) during the launch sequence (countdown), as the vehicle awaits liftoff. This becomes particularly important as complex sequences may be interrupted by planned or unplanned holds to fix problems.

Most rockets need to be supported and held down for a few seconds after ignition while the engines build up to full thrust. The vehicle is commonly held on the pad by hold-down arms or explosive bolts, which are triggered when the vehicle is stable and ready to fly, at which point all umbilical connections with the pad are released.

== History ==

Precursors to modern rocketry, such as fireworks and rocket launchers, did not generally require dedicated launch pads. This was due in part to their relatively portable size, as well as the sufficiency of their casings in sustaining stresses. One of the first pads for a liquid-fueled rocket, what would later be named the Goddard Rocket Launching Site after Robert H. Goddard&#x27;s series of launch tests starting in 1926, consisted of a mount situated on an open field in rural Massachusetts. The mount consisted of a frame with a series of gasoline and liquid oxygen lines feeding into the rocket. 

It wasn&#x27;t until the 1930s that rockets were increasing enough in size and strength that specialized launch facilities became necessary. The Verein für Raumschiffahrt in Germany was permitted after a request for funding in 1930 to move from farms to the Berlin rocket launching site (), a repurposed ammunition dump. 

A test stand was built for liquid-propellant rockets in Kummersdorf in 1932, where the early designs from the Aggregat series of ballistic missiles were afterwards developed. This site was also the location of the first casualties in rocket development, when Dr. Wahmke and 2 assistants were killed, and another assistant was injured. A propellant fuel tank exploded, while experimenting with mixing 90% hydrogen peroxide and alcohol, before combustion.

In May 1937, Dornberger, and most of his staff, moved to the Peenemünde Army Research Center on the island of Usedom on the Baltic coast which offered much greater space and secrecy. Dr. Thiel and his staff followed in the summer of 1940. Test Stand VI at Pennemünde was an exact replica to Kummersdorf&#x27;s large test stand. It was this site which saw the development of the V-2 rocket. Test Stand VII was the principle testing facility at the Peenemünde Airfield and was capable of static firing rocket motors with up to 200 tons of thrust.

Launch pads would increase in complexity over the following decades throughout and following the Space Race. Where large volumes of exhaust gases are expelled during engine testing or vehicle launch, a flame deflector might be implemented to mitigate damage to the surrounding pad and direct exhaust. This is especially important with reusable launch vehicles to increase efficiency of launches while minimizing time spent refurbishing.

== Construction ==

The construction of a launch pad begins with site selection, considering various geographical and logistical factors. It is often advantageous to position the launch pad on the coast, particularly with the ocean to the east, to leverage the Earth&#x27;s rotation and increase the specific impulse of launches. Space programs such as Soviet space program or the French space program without this luxury may utilize facilities outside of their main territory such as the Baikonur Cosmodrome or Guiana Space Centre to launch for them. This orientation also allows for safe trajectory paths, minimizing risks to populated areas during ascent.

== Facilities ==
=== Transport of rockets to the pad ===

Each launch site is unique, but a few broad types can be described by the means by which the space vehicle gets to the pad.

* Horizontally integrated rockets travel horizontally with the tail forward to the launch site on a transporter erector launcher and are then raised to the vertical position over the flame duct. Examples include all large Soviet rockets, including Soyuz, Proton, N1, and Energia. This method is also used by the SpaceX and Electron launch vehicles.
* Silo launched rockets are assembled inside of a missile silo. This method is only used by converted ICBMs due to the difficulty and expense of constructing a silo that can contain the forces of a rocket launch.
* Vertically integrated rockets can be assembled in a separate hangar on a mobile launcher platform (MLP). The MLP contains the umbilical structure and is carried to the launch site on a large vehicle called Crawler-transporter. Launch Complex 39 at the Kennedy Space Center is an example of a facility using this method. A similar system is used to launch Ariane 5 rockets at ELA-3 at Guiana Space Centre.
* Vertically assembled vehicles can also be transported on a mobile launcher platform resting on two parallel standard gauge railroad tracks that run from the integration building to launch area. This system is in use for the Atlas V and future Vulcan.
* At SLC-6 and SLC-37, rockets are assembled on the launch mount. A windowless rail-mounted building encloses the launch pad and gantry to protect the vehicle from the elements, and for purposes of military secrecy. Prior to launch, the building is rolled away. This method is also used at Kagoshima for the M-V.
* The former Sea Launch service used the converted self-propelled oil drilling platform &quot;Ocean Odyssey&quot; to transport Zenit 3SL rockets horizontally to the Equator, and then to erect and launch them from a floating launch platform into geostationary transfer orbits.

=== Service structure ===

A service structure is a steel framework or tower that is built on a launch pad to facilitate assembly and servicing. 

An umbilical tower also usually includes an elevator which allows maintenance and crew access. Immediately before ignition of the rocket&#x27;s motors, all connections between the tower and the craft are severed, and the bridges over which these connections pass often quickly swing away to prevent damage to the structure or vehicle.

=== Flame deflector systems ===

A flame deflector, flame diverter or flame trench is a structure or device designed to redirect or disperse the flame, heat, and exhaust gases produced by rocket engines or other propulsion systems. The amount of thrust generated by a rocket launch, along with the sound it produces during liftoff, can damage the launchpad and service structure, as well as the launch vehicle. The primary goal of the diverter is to prevent the flame from causing damage to equipment, infrastructure, or the surrounding environment. Flame diverters can be found at rocket launch sites and test stands where large volumes of exhaust gases are expelled during engine testing or vehicle launch.

=== Sound suppression systems ===

Sites for launching large rockets are often equipped with a sound suppression system to absorb or deflect acoustic energy generated during a rocket launch. As engine exhaust gasses exceed the speed of sound, they collide with the ambient air and shockwaves are created, with noise levels approaching 200 db. This energy can be reflected by the launch platform and pad surfaces, and could potentially cause damage to the launch vehicle, payload, and crew. For instance, the maximum admissible overall sound power level (OASPL) for payload integrity is approximately 145 db. Sound is dissipated by huge volumes of water distributed across the launch pad and launch platform during liftoff.

Water-based acoustic suppression systems are common on launch pads. They aid in reducing acoustic energy by injecting large quantities of water below the launch pad into the exhaust plume and in the area above the pad. Flame deflectors or flame trenches are designed to channel rocket exhaust away from the launch pad but also redirect acoustic energy away.

=== Hydrogen burn-off systems ===
In rockets using liquid hydrogen as their source of propellant, hydrogen burn-off systems (HBOI), also known as radially outward firing igniters (ROFI), can be utilized to prevent the build up of free gaseous hydrogen (GH2) in the aft engine area of the vehicle prior to engine start. Too much excess hydrogen in the aft during engine start can result in an overpressure blast wave that could damage the launch vehicle and surrounding pad structures.

== Validating engine performance and system readiness ==
The SpaceX launch sequence includes a hold-down feature of the launch pad that allows full engine ignition and systems check before liftoff. After the first-stage engine starts, the launcher is held down and not released for flight until all propulsion and vehicle systems are confirmed to be operating normally. Similar hold-down systems have been used on launch vehicles such as Saturn V and Space Shuttle. An automatic safe shut-down and unloading of propellant occur if any abnormal conditions are detected. Prior to the launch date, SpaceX sometimes completes a test cycle, culminating in a three-and-a-half second first stage engine static firing as well.

<doc id="316592" wikidata="Q220556" url="?curid=316592" title="Brock Lesnar">
<text>Brock Edward Lesnar ( ; born July 12, 1977) is an American professional wrestler and former mixed martial artist, amateur wrestler and professional American football player. As a professional wrestler, he is currently signed to WWE, but as of 2023, is on hiatus from active competition. Often regarded as one of the most prolific combat sport athletes in the world, Lesnar is the only person to have won the primary heavyweight championships of WWE, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), the Inoki Genome Federation (IGF), and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

Lesnar competed in collegiate wrestling for the University of Minnesota, winning the NCAA Division I national championship in 2000. He soon signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, renamed WWE in 2002), rising to industry prominence in mid-2002 by winning the WWE Championship at age 25, setting the record for the youngest performer to win the championship. In 2004, Lesnar departed WWE to join the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL), but was cut from the team during pre-season. He returned to wrestling and signed with NJPW in 2005 where he won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Lesnar later departed NJPW and continued to be promoted as the IWGP Heavyweight Champion in the IGF before taking a hiatus from wrestling to pursue a career in mixed martial arts (MMA). Years later in 2012, he re-signed with WWE; his 504-day first reign with the WWE Universal Championship is the seventh-longest world championship reign in the promotion&#x27;s history and he holds the record for most reigns as Universal Champion at three. He also won the Royal Rumble match twice (2003 and 2022), the Money in the Bank ladder match (2019), the King of the Ring tournament (2002), and has headlined several pay-per-view events, including WWE&#x27;s flagship event WrestleMania five times (19, 31, 34, 36, and 38), nine SummerSlams (2002, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2022); in addition, he also ended The Undertaker&#x27;s undefeated WrestleMania streak in 2014.

Lesnar began his MMA career for Hero&#x27;s in 2007, and signed with the UFC in 2008. He quickly won the UFC Heavyweight Championship, but was sidelined with diverticulitis in 2009. On his return in 2010, Lesnar defeated Interim UFC Heavyweight Champion Shane Carwin to unify the heavyweight championships and become the undisputed UFC Heavyweight Champion. After a couple of losses and further struggles with diverticulitis, Lesnar retired from MMA in 2011. He returned at UFC 200 in 2016 to defeat Mark Hunt, but his victory was overturned to a no-contest after he tested positive for a banned substance on UFC&#x27;s anti-doping policy. He then retired from MMA for the second time in 2017. A box office sensation, he competed in some of the bestselling pay-per-view events in promotion history, including headlining UFC 91, UFC 100, UFC 116 and UFC 121. He also co-headlined &quot;UFC 200&quot;, briefly being the main headliner before that spot was given to Amanda Nunes vs. Miesha Tate.

== Early life ==
Brock Edward Lesnar was born in Webster, South Dakota, on July 12, 1977, the son of Stephanie and Richard Lesnar. Even though his surname is Slovenian, he is of German descent, and grew up on his parents&#x27; dairy farm in Webster. He has two older brothers named Troy and Chad, and a younger sister named Brandi. At the age of 17, he joined the Army National Guard and was assigned to an office job after his red–green colorblindness was deemed hazardous to his desire to work with explosives. He was discharged after failing a computer typing test and later worked for a construction company.

== Amateur wrestling ==
Lesnar attended Webster High School, playing football and competing in wrestling, placing third in the state championships his senior year. He then went to Bismarck State College where in 1997, his freshman year, he placed 5th in the 275 lb. division of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). In 1998, his sophomore year, he won the 275 lb championship. After two years at Bismarck State College, Lesnar transferred to the University of Minnesota on a wrestling scholarship, where he was roommates with future WWE colleague Shelton Benjamin, who was also his assistant coach.

Lesnar won the 2000 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I heavyweight wrestling championship his senior year after being the runner-up to Stephen Neal the year prior. He finished his amateur career as a two-time NJCAA All-American, the 1998 NJCAA Heavyweight Champion, two-time NCAA All-American, two-time Big Ten Conference Champion and the 2000 NCAA Heavyweight Champion, with a record of 106–5 overall in four years of college.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2000–2004)===
==== Ohio Valley Wrestling (2000–2002) ====
In 2000, Lesnar signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and was sent to its developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he first met future friend and manager Paul Heyman. OVW booker Jim Cornette paired Lesnar with his former college roommate Shelton Benjamin in October 2000. They were known as The Minnesota Stretching Crew and won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on three separate occasions. Lesnar wrestled several dark matches in 2001 and 2002 before being called up to the WWF&#x27;s main roster.

==== The Next Big Thing (2002–2003) ====
Lesnar debuted on WWF television on the March 18, 2002, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as a heel, attacking Al Snow, Maven and Spike Dudley during their WWF Hardcore Championship match, while also being accompanied by Paul Heyman, who was seen giving instructions to Lesnar. When the brand extension was introduced in the WWF, Lesnar was drafted to the Raw brand. Later, Heyman was confirmed to be Lesnar&#x27;s agent and gave Lesnar the nickname &quot;The Next Big Thing&quot;. Lesnar&#x27;s first feud was with The Hardy Boyz. He defeated Jeff Hardy by knockout after Hardy did not respond to referee Theodore Long at Backlash on April 21, his first official televised match. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar faced off against Jeff&#x27;s brother, Matt Hardy, and defeated him in the same fashion. Lesnar and Shawn Stasiak lost to The Hardy Boyz at the UK-based Insurrextion on May 4 after Stasiak was pinned, but Lesnar attacked all the participants after the match. At Judgment Day on May 19, Lesnar and Heyman defeated The Hardy Boyz. This was also the first pay-per-view held after the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).

In June 2002, Lesnar won the 2002 King of the Ring tournament, defeating Bubba Ray Dudley in the first round, Booker T in the quarter-finals, Test in the semi-finals and Rob Van Dam in the finals at King of the Ring on June 23, earning him a shot at the WWE Undisputed Championship at SummerSlam. At Vengeance on July 21, Lesnar lost to Van Dam in a WWE Intercontinental Championship match by disqualification. On July 22, Lesnar joined the SmackDown! brand. After a quick feud with Hollywood Hulk Hogan in August 2002, Lesnar defeated The Rock at SummerSlam on August 25 to become the new WWE Undisputed Champion and youngest WWE Champion at age 25. He also became the second fastest professional wrestler to win the WWE Championship since his debut (126 days) behind only Ric Flair (113 days). At the time, the WWE Undisputed Championship was being defended on both brands, so Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff expected Lesnar to return on &quot;Raw&quot; the following night. SmackDown! General Manager Stephanie McMahon declared that Lesnar was only required to defend the title on SmackDown! shows and events, prompting Bischoff to establish a new championship for the Raw brand (the World Heavyweight Championship); the WWE Undisputed Championship was then renamed the WWE Championship.
Lesnar&#x27;s rapid rise to the top of WWE in 2002 led to a feud with The Undertaker, which involved a match at Unforgiven on September 22. The match ended in a double disqualification, with Lesnar retaining the title. Lesnar faced The Undertaker again at No Mercy on October 20, this time in a Hell in a Cell match. Leading up to the match, in the storyline, Lesnar broke The Undertaker&#x27;s hand with a propane tank. Despite Heyman begging McMahon not to let The Undertaker use his cast as a weapon, the request was denied and the match went on as planned. At No Mercy, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker in the Hell in a Cell match to retain the title, thus ending their feud. He retained the WWE Championship in a handicap match with Heyman against Edge at Rebellion on October 26.

Lesnar&#x27;s next opponent was Big Show and Heyman was convinced more than anyone that Lesnar could not win, trying to talk him out of defending the title. Lesnar refused and defended the championship against Big Show at Survivor Series on November 17. At Survivor Series, Heyman turned on Lesnar, allowing Big Show to chokeslam him onto a steel chair and pin him to win the WWE Championship, resulting in Lesnar&#x27;s first pinfall loss in WWE. This led to Lesnar turning face for the first time. Following Survivor Series, Heyman made it clear that Lesnar would not get a rematch, and had snuck a special clause saying so into his contract. To gain his revenge on Big Show and Heyman, Lesnar interfered in Big Show&#x27;s first title defense, which came against Kurt Angle the next month at Armageddon on December 15, where Lesnar executed the &quot;F-5&quot; on Big Show, which enabled Angle to win the WWE Championship. On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Angle introduced Heyman as his manager and, despite promising Lesnar a title shot earlier in the evening, declared that Lesnar still would not get it. Lesnar&#x27;s rivalry with Heyman and Big Show resumed, which culminated in a match at the Royal Rumble on January 19, 2003, with the winner being placed into the Royal Rumble match later in the evening. At the Royal Rumble, he defeated Big Show and entered the Royal Rumble match as the #29 entry. He eliminated Matt Hardy and Team Angle (Charlie Haas and Lesnar&#x27;s former OVW teammate Shelton Benjamin), who at the time, were mentored by Angle as a three-man stable. He eliminated The Undertaker last and won the Royal Rumble match, which guaranteed him a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30 since he was a SmackDown! wrestler. After the Royal Rumble, Lesnar and Chris Benoit defeated Angle, Haas and Benjamin in a three-on-two handicap match at No Way Out on February 23, despite Team Angle injuring their partner, Edge, backstage before the match. At WrestleMania, Lesnar defeated Angle to win his second WWE Championship; during the match, he botched a shooting star press (a move he had used numerous times in OVW) and landed on his head and neck, resulting in a concussion. This forced Angle (who entered the match with a broken neck) and Lesnar to improvise the finish of the match.
==== WWE Champion, various feuds and departure (2003–2004) ====
After WrestleMania, Lesnar turned his attention to John Cena, who had returned from injury in February 2003 after an &quot;F-5&quot; into a ringpost from Lesnar, with Cena claiming that Lesnar nearly ended his career and even named his new finishing move the &quot;F.U.&quot; as a jab at the new champion. The feud ended in a match at Backlash on April 27, where Lesnar defeated Cena to retain the WWE Championship. On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Lesnar resumed his rivalry with Big Show after, in the storyline, Big Show injured Rey Mysterio during their match at Backlash. Big Show&#x27;s attack resulted in Mysterio being carried out on a stretcher and backboard, and Big Show took Mysterio off the stretcher and swung the backboard into the ringpost, compounding the injury. Lesnar called out Big Show, who demanded that Lesnar put his title on the line against him. This led to a stretcher match for the WWE Championship at Judgment Day on May 18, which Lesnar won. During a rematch on the June 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Lesnar lifted Big Show off the top-rope in a superplex which caused the ring to collapse on impact. As Lesnar and Big Show continued their rivalry, Kurt Angle returned from his neck surgery and began to form a more friendly rivalry with Lesnar, as the two were allies, yet contenders for the title. At the first-ever SmackDown! brand-exclusive pay-per-view on July 27, Vengeance, Lesnar lost the WWE Championship to Angle in a triple threat match involving Big Show, after he was pinned by Angle.
Lesnar continued to aggressively pursue the WWE Championship despite his friendship with Angle. Mr. McMahon became involved in the angle, at first berating Lesnar, who had involved himself in McMahon&#x27;s rivalry with Zach Gowen, for losing to Angle. This all turned out to be a swerve that came into focus on the August 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. That night, Lesnar and McMahon were to face each other in a steel cage match with Angle as the special guest referee as per McMahon&#x27;s orders on the previous week&#x27;s program. During the match, Lesnar had passed out due to a staged backstage incident and McMahon was set to pin him, but Angle refused to allow McMahon to win that way. As the two men began to argue, Lesnar attacked Angle with an &quot;F-5&quot; and kept attacking Angle while McMahon watched and celebrated with him afterward, turning heel once again in the process. At SummerSlam on August 24, Lesnar lost to Angle after submitting to the ankle lock. On the September 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Lesnar defeated Angle in an Iron Man match to win his third WWE Championship by a final score of five to four, thus ending their long-standing feud.

Lesnar successfully defended his newly won title against the debuting Paul London on the October 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. He returned to feud with The Undertaker, as Lesnar had previously cost The Undertaker the title in a match against then-champion Kurt Angle on the September 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, which granted him a shot at Lesnar&#x27;s title. At No Mercy on October 19, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker in a Biker Chain match after interference from The Full Blooded Italians and Mr. McMahon. After Paul Heyman returned to WWE as SmackDown! General Manager, Lesnar aligned himself with Heyman. With Survivor Series coming up, he challenged Angle to a traditional Survivor Series elimination tag team match. Lesnar chose Big Show as his first teammate, with Heyman adding a returning Nathan Jones and a debuting Matt Morgan to bring the team number to four. Angle chose Chris Benoit and The APA (Bradshaw and Faarooq) to join his team. Faarooq was injured during a match with Lesnar and Angle&#x27;s team was forced to find a replacement for him. Lesnar&#x27;s team picked A-Train to fill the fifth and final spot for them after he attacked John Cena, who refused to accept an invitation to join Lesnar&#x27;s team. Cena instead joined Angle&#x27;s team and Angle added Hardcore Holly as the fifth member (Lesnar had legitimately injured Holly the year before and he had not wrestled since). On November 16 at Survivor Series, Lesnar was eliminated after Benoit forced him to tap out to the &quot;Crippler Crossface&quot;. His team lost the match. On the December 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he defended the WWE Championship from Benoit after Benoit passed out to Lesnar&#x27;s debuting submission hold, the &quot;Brock Lock&quot;.
Survivor Series in November 2003 also marked the first time Lesnar met Goldberg from the Raw brand. After Lesnar claimed in a backstage interview that he could beat anybody in the world, Goldberg interrupted the interview and introduced himself to Lesnar, shaking hands with him before leaving with a staredown. Lesnar followed this rivalry with a feud involving Hardcore Holly. In the storyline, Holly wanted revenge on Lesnar for legitimately injuring his neck during a previous match between the two in 2002 which left Holly in need of neck surgery and out of action for a year. At the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2004, Lesnar defeated Holly to retain the WWE Championship. Later in the Royal Rumble match, Lesnar attacked Goldberg with an &quot;F-5&quot;, enabling Kurt Angle to eliminate him by throwing him off the top rope.

Lesnar defended the WWE Championship against Eddie Guerrero at No Way Out on February 15. Goldberg attacked Lesnar with a spear while the referee was unconscious, allowing Guerrero to get a near-fall on Lesnar. Lesnar then attempted an &quot;F-5&quot; on Guerrero but Guerrero reversed it into a DDT on the title belt and executed a frog splash to win the WWE Championship. An angry Lesnar then began feuding with Goldberg, blaming him for losing his title, and a match was set up between the two at WrestleMania XX on March 14. During the feud with Goldberg, Lesnar was also at odds with Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was shown suggesting to Goldberg that he attack Lesnar at No Way Out. After Lesnar attacked Austin on the February 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and stole his four-wheeler, Austin was inserted as the special guest referee for the WrestleMania match. On the March 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Lesnar defeated Hardcore Holly in his last match on a weekly WWE televised show until 2019. Behind the scenes, it was widely known that the match was Goldberg&#x27;s last in WWE. Only a week before WrestleMania, rumors surfaced that Lesnar too was leaving WWE to pursue a career in the National Football League (NFL). As a result, Lesnar&#x27;s match with Goldberg became a fiasco as the fans at Madison Square Garden jeered and heckled both of them vociferously. Goldberg defeated Lesnar after a &quot;Jackhammer&quot; and both men subsequently received &quot;Stone Cold Stunners&quot; from Austin. After WrestleMania XX, Lesnar left WWE, citing burnout, injuries, poor creative decisions, an addiction to alcohol and painkillers and the rigorous travel schedule as reasons for his departure.

=== Japanese promotions (2005–2007) ===
On October 8, 2005, Lesnar won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship on his debut match in a three-way match with Kazuyuki Fujita and Masahiro Chono at a New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) show in the Tokyo Dome. Lesnar is one of the few American wrestlers to have held this title. He won the match by pinning Chono after an &quot;F-5&quot;, which he had renamed the &quot;Verdict&quot; since WWE owns the trademark on the &quot;F-5&quot; name. After the match, Lesnar stated that this name was referring to his lawsuit against WWE, who filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent Lesnar from continuing to work with NJPW on December 6, but the court did not grant it. Following that, he had two non-title victories against Manabu Nakanishi and Yuji Nagata. Lesnar successfully defended the championship on January 4, 2006, against former champion Shinsuke Nakamura. On January 13, WWE once again filed an injunction against Lesnar to stop him from defending the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, which was also not enforced as he went on to retain his championship against former Sumo Wrestling Grand Champion Akebono on March 19, at the Sumo Hall. Lesnar had another successful title defense against Giant Bernard on May 3. This was the first American vs. American title match in NJPW since Vader vs. Stan Hansen in 1990. On July 15, NJPW stripped Lesnar of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship as he did not return to defend it due to visa issues. A tournament was held on July 16 to determine the new champion, which was won by Hiroshi Tanahashi. Lesnar continued to possess the physical IWGP Heavyweight Championship belt until late June 2007.

Approximately one year later on June 29, 2007, Lesnar defended his IWGP Heavyweight Championship against TNA World Heavyweight Champion Kurt Angle in a champion vs. champion match, at the debut event of the Inoki Genome Federation (IGF). IGF promoter Antonio Inoki had stated Lesnar was the &quot;proper&quot; IWGP Heavyweight Champion as he was not defeated for the title. Angle made him tap out to the ankle lock to win the IWGP Heavyweight Championship as recognized by IGF and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). This was Lesnar&#x27;s last match as a professional wrestler until 2012, when he re-signed with WWE.

=== Return to WWE (2012–2020, 2021–present)===
==== Return and ending The Streak (2012–2014) ====
Lesnar returned to WWE on April 2, 2012, on &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, as a heel, by confronting and delivering an &quot;F-5&quot; to John Cena. The following week on &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, General Manager John Laurinaitis revealed that he signed Lesnar to bring &quot;legitimacy&quot; back to WWE and become the &quot;new face of the WWE&quot;. Laurinaitis also scheduled Lesnar to face Cena at Extreme Rules in an Extreme Rules match. At Extreme Rules on April 29, Lesnar lost to Cena despite dominating the match.

The following night on &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, WWE&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer Triple H refused to give in to Lesnar&#x27;s unreasonable contract demands (which included being given his own personal jet and having &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot; renamed to &quot;Monday Night Raw Starring Brock Lesnar&quot;), resulting in Lesnar attacking him and breaking his arm with a kimura lock in storyline. The next week on &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, Paul Heyman returned as Lesnar&#x27;s legal representative; he claimed that Lesnar was quitting WWE and was suing WWE for breach of contract. At No Way Out on June 17, Triple H challenged Lesnar (who was not present) to a match at SummerSlam, which Lesnar refused. Stephanie McMahon later goaded Heyman into accepting the match on Lesnar&#x27;s behalf on July 23 at &quot;Raw 1000&quot;. At SummerSlam on August 19, Lesnar defeated Triple H by submission after once again breaking his arm in storyline. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar declared himself the new &quot;King of Kings&quot; and said that he would depart from WWE after his victory over Triple H, stating that he had conquered everything in the company.
Lesnar returned on the January 28, 2013, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, confronting Mr. McMahon who was about to fire Heyman, and despite Heyman&#x27;s pleas, Lesnar attacked McMahon with an &quot;F-5&quot;, breaking McMahon&#x27;s pelvis in storyline. The following week during The Miz&#x27;s &quot;Miz TV&quot; talk show, &quot;Raw&quot; Managing Supervisor Vickie Guerrero revealed herself as the one who signed Lesnar to a new contract to impress McMahon. On the February 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar once again attempted to attack McMahon, only to get into a brawl with the returning Triple H, which resulted in Lesnar legitimately having his head split open and requiring eighteen stitches. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Triple H issued a challenge to Lesnar, requesting a rematch with him at WrestleMania 29, which Lesnar accepted but only after Triple H signed a contract and Lesnar named the stipulation. After Triple H signed the contract and assaulted Heyman, the stipulation was revealed as No Holds Barred with Triple H&#x27;s career on the line. At WrestleMania on April 7, Lesnar lost to Triple H after a &quot;Pedigree&quot; onto the steel steps. On the April 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar attacked 3MB (Heath Slater, Drew McIntyre, and Jinder Mahal) before Heyman challenged Triple H to face Lesnar in a steel cage match at Extreme Rules, which Triple H accepted the following week. At Extreme Rules on May 19, after interference from Heyman, Lesnar defeated Triple H to end their feud. Lesnar returned on the June 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, attacking Heyman&#x27;s fellow client CM Punk with an &quot;F-5&quot;. Despite the accusations from Punk, Heyman claimed that he was not behind Lesnar&#x27;s attack on him. Heyman turned on Punk in July, and claimed that Punk could not beat Lesnar, which led to Lesnar making his return and attacking Punk on the July 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Punk challenged Lesnar to a match at SummerSlam on August 18, where Lesnar defeated Punk in a no disqualification match.

On the December 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar returned with Heyman to challenge the winner of the upcoming WWE World Heavyweight Championship match between Randy Orton and John Cena at the Royal Rumble. Lesnar then dared any wrestler who disapproved of that notion to challenge him, which was answered by Mark Henry. The ensuing brawl ended with Lesnar delivering an &quot;F-5&quot; to Henry. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Henry challenged Lesnar again, only to have Lesnar dislocate his elbow with the Kimura lock in storyline, which led Big Show to confront Lesnar, thus starting a feud which was settled at the Royal Rumble on January 26, 2014, where Lesnar defeated Big Show after attacking him with a steel chair before the match began. On the February 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman stated that Lesnar had requested a match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXX, but received an open contract to face anyone else of his choosing instead. The Undertaker then returned and attacked Lesnar with a chokeslam through a table, setting up their match at WrestleMania XXX. At WrestleMania on April 6, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker after executing three &quot;F-5&quot;s, ending his undefeated WrestleMania streak at 21, a feat that was described by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as being &quot;the most shocking result since the Montreal Screwjob&quot;.

==== WWE World Heavyweight Champion (2014–2015) ====

At SummerSlam on August 17, Lesnar defeated John Cena to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship; during the match he delivered sixteen suplexes (most of which were German suplexes) and two &quot;F-5&quot;s to Cena, who barely managed any offense. In a rematch at Night of Champions on September 21, Lesnar was disqualified due to Seth Rollins interfering, but retained his championship. Later in the year, Rollins reunited with The Authority and was added to Lesnar and Cena championship match at the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2015, making it a triple threat match, which Lesnar won despite (storyline) breaking a rib during the match.

Lesnar&#x27;s next challenger was Roman Reigns, who had won the Royal Rumble match to earn a title match at WrestleMania 31 on March 29. During his main event match against Reigns, Lesnar delivered multiple suplexes and was heard exclaiming, &quot;Suplex City, bitch!&quot; and thereafter &quot;Suplex City&quot; became one of his signature catchphrases and merchandise motifs. After Lesnar and Reigns traded a few false finishes, Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract while the match was in progress, making it a triple threat; Rollins then pinned Reigns to win the title after delivering a &quot;Curb Stomp&quot;. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar tried to invoke his rematch clause and subsequently attacked commentators Booker T, John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) and Michael Cole, as well as a cameraman after Rollins refused the rematch, which led to Stephanie McMahon suspending Lesnar indefinitely in storyline.

Lesnar returned on the June 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, being chosen by The Authority as the number one contender to Rollins&#x27; WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Battleground. On July 4, Lesnar made his first non-televised wrestling appearance for WWE since his 2012 return, defeating Kofi Kingston at The Beast in the East live event in Tokyo in a quick winning effort; he also delivered &quot;F-5&quot;s to Kingston&#x27;s New Day stablemates Big E and Xavier Woods after the match. At Battleground on July 19, Lesnar dominated Rollins, delivering thirteen suplexes, but mid-pinfall, after performing an &quot;F-5&quot;, he was attacked by The Undertaker (who incapacitated Lesnar with a chokeslam and two &quot;Tombstone Piledrivers),&quot; thus ending the match with Lesnar winning by disqualification and Rollins retaining the championship.

==== Suplex City (2015–2017) ====

The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, The Undertaker explained that he had attacked Lesnar not for ending his WrestleMania streak, but rather for Lesnar allowing Heyman to constantly taunt him about it, which led to the two brawling throughout the arena and a WrestleMania rematch being scheduled for SummerSlam on August 23, where The Undertaker controversially defeated Lesnar. The timekeeper rang the bell as The Undertaker had supposedly submitted to Lesnar&#x27;s Kimura lock, though the referee had not seen any submission. In the ensuing confusion, The Undertaker hit Lesnar with a low blow and applied his &quot;Hell&#x27;s Gate&quot; submission hold, in which Lesnar passed out. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar and Heyman challenged The Undertaker to an immediate rematch, only to be confronted by Bo Dallas (who mocked Lesnar about his defeat); Lesnar responded with five German suplexes and an &quot;F-5&quot;.

At Hell in a Cell on October 25, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match after a low blow and &quot;F-5&quot; onto the exposed ring floor, ending their feud. The match was later voted &quot;Match of the Year&quot; during the 2015 Slammy Awards.

On the January 11, 2016, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar returned, attacking The New Day, The League of Nations (Sheamus, King Barrett, Rusev and Alberto Del Rio) and Kevin Owens, before performing an &quot;F-5&quot; on Roman Reigns. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, he brawled with Reigns until they were attacked by The Wyatt Family. At the Royal Rumble on January 24, Lesnar was the 23rd entrant, eliminating Jack Swagger and The Wyatt Family minus Bray Wyatt before being eliminated by the Wyatt Family members he had eliminated first. He later defeated Wyatt and Luke Harper in a two-on-one handicap at the Road Block pay-per-view event.

On the January 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Stephanie McMahon scheduled a triple threat match between Lesnar, Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose for Fastlane to determine who would challenge Triple H&#x27;s for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 32. In the following weeks, Lesnar was continuously provoked by Ambrose, with Reigns saving him from the subsequent attacks by Lesnar. At Fastlane on February 21, Lesnar dominated most of the match before he was put through two broadcast tables by Ambrose and Reigns; he lost the match after Reigns pinned Ambrose. Because of this, Lesnar attacked Ambrose in the parking lot as he was arriving at the arena. Ambrose returned later in the night, having hijacked an ambulance, and challenged Lesnar to a No Holds Barred Street Fight match at WrestleMania 32 on April 3, where Lesnar defeated Ambrose after an &quot;F-5&quot; onto a pile of chairs.
On the July 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Lesnar was revealed as the returning Randy Orton&#x27;s opponent for SummerSlam. Two days later on July 9, WWE allowed Lesnar to have a one-off fight for UFC 200. Lesnar failed two of his drug tests for this fight but was not suspended by WWE because he is not a full-time performer. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Lesnar was the #5 draft pick for the Raw brand. Reports claimed that he would have been #1 had he not failed his UFC drug tests. Orton was drafted to SmackDown, thus making their match an interbrand match, while WWE billed their face-off as a match fifteen years in the making. Along with Heyman, Lesnar made his return to &quot;Raw&quot; on August 1 (his first appearance on WWE programming since WrestleMania 32), but during his segment Orton appeared and attacked Lesnar with an &quot;RKO&quot;. Lesnar then attacked Orton during his match the following night on &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;, performing an &quot;F-5&quot; on Orton. At SummerSlam on August 21, Lesnar defeated Orton by technical knockout, leaving Orton with a forehead wound which required ten staples. He then hit SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon with an &quot;F-5&quot;. The end made many people believe Lesnar had gone off script due to the severity of Orton&#x27;s head wound, out of which Vince McMahon confirmed that the ending was planned. Lesnar was later storyline fined $500 for delivering an &quot;F-5&quot; to Shane McMahon and his assault on Orton. On September 24 at a house show in Chicago, Illinois, Lesnar defeated Orton in a no-disqualification rematch, with the match being billed as a Suplex City death match.

On the October 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman, on Lesnar&#x27;s behalf, challenged Goldberg to a fight after the pair had been feuding for several months through social media and during promotional work for the &quot;WWE 2K17&quot; video game, which featured Lesnar as the cover star and Goldberg as the pre-order bonus. Heyman stated that Goldberg was the one blemish on Lesnar&#x27;s WWE career, as Goldberg had defeated Lesnar at WrestleMania XX in 2004. On the October 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg returned to WWE after a twelve-year absence and accepted Lesnar&#x27;s request for a fight with their match later scheduled for Survivor Series. On the final &quot;Raw&quot; before Survivor Series, Lesnar and Goldberg had a confrontation for the first time in twelve years, resulting in a brawl with security after Heyman insulted Goldberg&#x27;s family. On November 20 at Survivor Series, Lesnar quickly lost to Goldberg in 1 minute and 26 seconds, marking the first time in three years that Lesnar was pinned. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg declared himself the first entrant in the 2017 Royal Rumble match. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman addressed the Survivor Series match, stating that they underestimated Goldberg and that the match was a humiliation and embarrassment for him and Lesnar, who would also be in the Royal Rumble as he has something to prove. Lesnar returned on the January 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to confront other Royal Rumble participants, attacking Sami Zayn, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns. At the Royal Rumble on January 29, Lesnar entered at number 26 and went on to eliminate Enzo Amore, Dean Ambrose and Dolph Ziggler before confronting Goldberg, who entered at number 28 and quickly eliminated Lesnar after a spear.

==== Year-long Universal Championship reign (2017–2018) ====
The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar challenged Goldberg to a final match at WrestleMania 33. On the February 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg accepted Lesnar&#x27;s challenge and was named number one contender for Kevin Owens&#x27; Universal Championship, which he won on March 5 at Fastlane thus turning his match with Lesnar into a title match. At WrestleMania on April 2, Lesnar beat Goldberg to win his fifth world title in WWE and became the first man to have won both the WWE Championship and the Universal Championship. Lesnar also became the second person to kick-out from Goldberg&#x27;s &quot;Jackhammer&quot; and gave him the first clean singles loss of his professional wrestling career. After several weeks of feuding, Lesnar&#x27;s first title defense came at the inaugural Great Balls of Fire event on July 9, 2017, where he successfully retained against Samoa Joe, before defeating him a second time for the title at a house show.
On the July 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar was scheduled to defend his title in a fatal four-way match at SummerSlam against Samoa Joe, Roman Reigns and Braun Strowman. Lesnar and Heyman stated that both would leave WWE should Lesnar lose the championship in the match. At SummerSlam on August 20, Lesnar retained the title by pinning Reigns. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar was attacked by Strowman. The subsequent title match at No Mercy on September 24 was won by Lesnar. Lesnar then defeated WWE Champion AJ Styles in an interbrand champion vs. champion non-title match at Survivor Series on November 19. His next title defense was scheduled for the Royal Rumble on January 28, 2018, where he successfully defended the title in a triple threat match against Strowman and Kane. Lesnar then re-ignited his feud with Roman Reigns, who won the Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber on February 25 to become the number one contender to Lesnar&#x27;s title at WrestleMania 34. At WrestleMania on April 8, Lesnar pinned Reigns to retain the title in the main event. Rumors arose that Lesnar would leave WWE and rejoin the UFC. On April 9, Lesnar re-signed with WWE. At the Greatest Royal Rumble pay-per-view on April 27, he again defeated Reigns in a steel cage when Reigns speared Lesnar through the cage wall. As Lesnar escaped the cage first, he was declared the winner.

After the Greatest Royal Rumble, Lesnar was absent from WWE television for nearly three months. At Extreme Rules on July 15, Raw General Manager Kurt Angle threatened to strip Lesnar of the Universal Championship if he did not show up to &quot;Raw&quot; the following night. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Heyman agreed that Lesnar would defend his title at SummerSlam; Reigns became the number one contender later that same night. On the July 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar was at the arena but refused to appear in the ring. Angle threatened to fire Heyman if he could not persuade Lesnar to come to the ring. Throughout the broadcast, Heyman&#x27;s attempts were unsuccessful. At the end of the show, after Angle had fired him, Lesnar appeared to attack Angle and choke Heyman. Two weeks later, the dissension between Lesnar and Heyman was revealed to be just a ruse when Lesnar returning on the August 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to attack Reigns. At SummerSlam on August 19, Strowman was at ringside ready to cash in his Money in the Bank contract on the winner. Lesnar incapacitated Strowman, allowing Reigns to capitalize on the distracted Lesnar and win the Universal Championship, ending Lesnar&#x27;s title reign at 504 days. As of 2018, the reign was the sixth-longest world championship reign in WWE history and the longest since 1988.

==== World championship reigns and first retirement (2018–2020) ====
Lesnar returned at Hell in a Cell on September 16, interrupting the Hell in a Cell match between defending Universal Champion Reigns and Braun Strowman, kicking in the door and attacking both men, thus rendering the match a no-contest and costing Strowman his Money in the Bank cash-in match. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Acting General Manager Baron Corbin scheduled Reigns to defend the Universal Championship in a triple threat match against Lesnar and Strowman at Crown Jewel on November 2. After Reigns relinquished the title due to a legitimate leukemia relapse, the match was changed to a singles match between Lesnar and Strowman for the vacant title. At Crown Jewel, Lesnar defeated Strowman in three minutes to become the first two-time Universal Champion, thanks to a pre-match attack from Corbin.

After his title win, Lesnar was scheduled to face WWE Champion AJ Styles at Survivor Series in another champion vs. champion non-title match. Five days before, Styles lost the WWE Championship to Daniel Bryan on &quot;SmackDown&quot;. At Survivor Series on November 18, Lesnar overcame a late rally from Bryan to defeat him. Lesnar then successfully defended the title against Finn Bálor via submission at the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2019. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar attacked 2019 Royal Rumble match winner Seth Rollins with six F-5s, setting up a title match for WrestleMania 35. At WrestleMania on April 7, Lesnar attacked Rollins before the match. Rollins then attacked Lesnar with a low blow while the referee was down and pinned Lesnar, ending his second reign as Universal Champion at 156 days.

At Money in the Bank on May 19, 2019, Lesnar surprisingly replaced Sami Zayn in the Money in the Bank ladder match. Before the match, Zayn had been attacked backstage. Later, the match began with only seven of the scheduled eight participants. At the climax of the match, Lesnar ran in, took out Ali, who was on top of a ladder, and won the Money in the Bank contract, granting him either a Universal Championship or WWE Championship match at any time of his choosing within the next year. After teasing cashing in on Universal Champion Seth Rollins and WWE Champion Kofi Kingston and failing an attempt to cash-in on Rollins at Super ShowDown on June 7, Lesnar successfully cashed in his contract to win the Universal Championship from Rollins at Extreme Rules on July 14 right after Rollins and Raw Women&#x27;s Champion Becky Lynch had retained their respective titles against Baron Corbin and Lacey Evans in an Extreme Rules mixed tag team match. At SummerSlam on August 11, Lesnar lost the title back to Rollins, ending his third title reign at 28 days.

Lesnar and Heyman returned on the September 17 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; to challenge Kofi Kingston for the WWE Championship. Kingston accepted and Lesnar proceeded to &quot;F-5&quot; him. On &quot;SmackDown&quot;″s 20th Anniversary on October 4, Lesnar quickly defeated Kingston in about eight seconds to win his fifth WWE Championship; this was Lesnar&#x27;s first match on &quot;SmackDown&quot; in 15 years. After his victory, Lesnar was attacked by former UFC opponent Cain Velasquez, making his WWE debut. Lesnar was then scheduled to defend the WWE Championship against Velasquez at Crown Jewel on October 31. During the 2019 draft, Lesnar was drafted to SmackDown. At the Crown Jewel event, Lesnar defeated Velasquez in under five minutes via submission with the Kimura Lock. After the match, Rey Mysterio attacked Lesnar with a chair. On the November 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Lesnar and Heyman quit the brand in order to go after Mysterio, who had been drafted to Raw, thus transferring to Raw with the WWE Championship. This led to Mysterio challenging Lesnar for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series on November 24, which was made official as a No Holds Barred match, where Lesnar retained, despite Mysterio&#x27;s son, Dominik&#x27;s attempt to aid Mysterio during the match.

Lesnar returned on the January 6, 2020, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to declare that no one deserved an opportunity at the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble, so instead he would enter the Royal Rumble match as entrant number one. At the Royal Rumble on January 26, Lesnar eliminated the first thirteen competitors he faced, tying the record for most eliminations in a Royal Rumble match, before being eliminated by Drew McIntyre, who won the match. After retaining the championship against Ricochet at Super ShowDown on February 27, Lesnar ultimately lost the WWE Championship to McIntyre in the main event of WrestleMania 36 Part 2 (which was taped on March 25–26 and aired on April 5). This was his final appearance until 2021 – it was later reported by several sources that Lesnar was not under contract with WWE after the match. Lesnar confirmed in March 2022 that he had initially retired from professional wrestling after WrestleMania 36, until deciding to return in 2021.

==== Second return and feud with Roman Reigns (2021–2022) ====
Lesnar, now sporting a cowboy/farmer look with a beard and ponytail, returned as a face at SummerSlam in August 2021 and confronted Universal Champion Roman Reigns after Reigns&#x27; successful title defense against John Cena. During the 2021 WWE Draft, it was revealed that Lesnar had become a free agent, allowing him to appear on any brand. He then primarily appeared on SmackDown, and he and Reigns faced each other for the title at Crown Jewel on October 21, which Lesnar lost after interference from The Usos. On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, he started a locker room-clearing brawl with Reigns, resulting in an indefinite suspension by on-air authority figure Adam Pearce, whom Lesnar attacked. On the November 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, it was announced his suspension had been lifted. On the December 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, it was announced that Lesnar would once again face Reigns for the title, this time at the Day 1 event. The match was canceled after Reigns contracted COVID-19, and Lesnar was instead added to Raw&#x27;s WWE Championship match at the event to make it a fatal five-way match. At Day 1 on January 1, 2022, Lesnar won his sixth WWE Championship, defeating Bobby Lashley, Kevin Owens, Seth Rollins, and defending champion Big E, who he pinned. On the following episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar reunited with his advocate Paul Heyman.

At Royal Rumble on January 29, he lost the WWE Championship to Lashley due to Reigns&#x27; interference and Heyman&#x27;s betrayal (who realigned with Reigns), ending his sixth reign at 29 days, however later that night, he entered the Royal Rumble match as the surprise 30th entrant and won the match by last eliminating Drew McIntyre and becoming the fourth person to win from the #30 spot (after The Undertaker in 2007, John Cena in 2008, and Triple H in 2016). This made Lesnar the ninth two-time Rumble winner, after his first win in 2003, while also making him the first person to lose their world championship and then win the Rumble in the same night. Among the other multi-time Rumble winners, Lesnar also set a record for the longest time between Rumble wins at 19 years. He also set the record for the least amount of time spent in the Rumble before winning it, being in the match for 2 minutes and 30 seconds and beating Edge&#x27;s 2010 record by 5 minutes and 7 seconds. On the following episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar revealed he would challenge Reigns for the Universal Championship at WrestleMania 38, and was also scheduled to compete in the Elimination Chamber match for the WWE Championship on February 19 at Elimination Chamber. Lesnar won the match to win the title for a seventh time by single-handedly eliminating all other opponents (Seth &quot;Freakin&quot; Rollins, Riddle, AJ Styles, and Austin Theory), except Lashley, who was removed early in the match due to a concussion protocol. This also converted his Universal Championship match against Reigns at WrestleMania into a Winner Takes All match. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, their Winner Takes All match was then stipulated as a title unification match. Lesnar lost the WWE Championship to Reigns in the unification match at the event on April 3. On the June 17 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Lesnar once again returned to confront and attack Reigns after he successfully defended the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Riddle, renewing their rivalry. This resulted in a Last Man Standing match being made for the title at SummerSlam, with WWE billing it as the ultimate finale to the feud. At the event on July 30, Lesnar failed to beat Reigns for the title after interference from The Usos and Heyman.

==== Various feuds (2022–2023) ====
On the October 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar made a surprise return, attacking United States Champion Bobby Lashley and injuring his shoulder before his scheduled title defense against Seth &quot;Freakin&quot; Rollins, resuming their feud. At Crown Jewel on November 5, Lesnar defeated Lashley despite Lashley dominating the majority of the match. Lesnar&#x27;s next appearance occurred on Raw Is XXX on January 23, 2023, where he caused Lashley to lose his United States Championship match. At the Royal Rumble, Lesnar entered the Royal Rumble match at #12 eliminating Chad Gable, Santos Escobar and Angelo Dawkins before being eliminated by Lashley. At Elimination Chamber on February 18, Lesnar lost to Lashley by disqualification after he hit Lashley with a low blow and attacked both the referee and Lashley ending their feud.

On the February 20 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Omos challenged Lesnar to a match at WrestleMania 39. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Lesnar appeared on the &quot;VIP Lounge&quot; with Omos&#x27; manager MVP; Lesnar accepted the challenge, then proceeded to attack MVP with an &quot;F-5&quot;. At the event, Lesnar defeated Omos.

On the April 3, 2023, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the day after Night 2 of WrestleMania 39, Triple H introduced Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns, accompanied by Paul Heyman and Solo Sikoa. Cody Rhodes interrupted and challenged Reigns to a rematch, only for Reigns to decline. Rhodes then challenged Reigns and Sikoa to a tag team match later that night, and Reigns accepted under the condition that Rhodes&#x27; partner was someone who competed at WrestleMania 39 but also that person could not challenge Reigns for his title as long as Reigns was champion. Lesnar answered, with the latter stipulation not applying to him as he was already banned from challenging Reigns for the title following their match at SummerSlam in 2022. However, the match never occurred due to Lesnar suddenly assaulting Rhodes before the match could begin, thus turning heel for the first time since 2020. It was later reported that Lesnar was mad due to his position on the WrestleMania card, as his match had opened Night 2 instead of being in a main event slot. Rhodes addressed the attack the following week and challenged Lesnar to a match at Backlash. On the April 17 episode, Rhodes appeared ready to fight despite not being medically cleared to compete. To keep Rhodes from fighting Lesnar that night, Adam Pearce made the match for Backlash official. Lesnar lost to Rhodes at Backlash, defeated Rhodes at Night of Champions by submission, and lost to Rhodes again at SummerSlam to end their feud. After the final match, Lesnar hugged Rhodes and shook his hand.

====Vince McMahon scandal and hiatus (2024–present)====
According to several reports, Lesnar was scheduled to make his return to WWE at the 2024 Royal Rumble event as a participant in the Royal Rumble match. During the match, he would have been eliminated by Dominik Mysterio, as part of the build to a match against Mysterio at Elimination Chamber: Perth. However, a lawsuit was filed a few days before the Royal Rumble by Janel Grant, a former employee at WWE global headquarters between 2019 and 2022. Grant alleged that WWE co-founder Vince McMahon had coerced her into a sexual relationship and, along with WWE executive John Laurinaitis and an unnamed WWE wrestler &quot;who was also a former UFC fighter&quot;, sexually trafficked her and repeatedly sexually assaulted her in 2020 and 2021. The unnamed talent was later identified by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as Lesnar. As a result of the lawsuit, he was removed from the Royal Rumble and replaced by Bron Breakker. It was later reported that he was removed from WWE&#x27;s creative plans ahead of their WrestleMania XL event, despite originally being planned to have a match against WWE Intercontinental Champion Gunther at the event. In February, he was removed from the &quot;WWE SuperCard&quot; video game. He would also be removed from the cover of &quot;WWE 2K24&quot;″s &quot;40 Years of WrestleMania&quot; edition, as well as the playable roster, only being accessible through the game&#x27;s Showcase Mode. He was also removed from the introduction video of WWE&#x27;s weekly programming, with LA Knight replacing him.

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==

Since Lesnar&#x27;s debut, he was portrayed as a powerhouse athlete. He is often called by his nickname &quot;The Beast Incarnate&quot; or simply &quot;The Beast&quot;. During his initial run when he was consistently main-eventing, WWE was in what is labeled by the company and fans as the &quot;Ruthless Aggression Era&quot;. His go-to finishing maneuver for his entire career has been a fireman&#x27;s carry facebuster known as the &quot;F-5&quot; (or &quot;The Verdict&quot; when he wrestled outside of WWE). After his return in 2012, Lesnar focused on an MMA-oriented gimmick, sporting MMA gloves during his matches and adding the Kimura lock as a submission hold. Lesnar is also known for performing several suplexes (especially German suplexes) on his rivals, with these often being described as the opponent being taken to &quot;Suplex City&quot;, named after an ad-lib Lesnar delivered to Roman Reigns during their WrestleMania 31 match. Lesnar has been managed by Paul Heyman for the majority of his WWE career with Heyman being Lesnar&#x27;s mouthpiece for storylines and feuds.

Throughout the second half of the 2010s, Lesnar began to receive an increasing amount of criticism for his character and performances. Many reporters thought his Suplex City character &quot;jumped the shark&quot; and his matches had &quot;become formulaic&quot;. He was largely criticized due to his absences from television during his time as Universal Champion. It was pointed out that he had the longest world championship reign since Hulk Hogan, but only defended the title 13 times, all on pay-per-views, with Tim Fiorvanti from ESPN commenting that he had &quot;removed the top title on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; from circulation&quot;. The short length of his matches was also criticized by journalists and fans. Former WWE Champion Bob Backlund criticized the fact that Lesnar used mostly suplexes during his matches, saying &quot;it gets old to do the same thing over and over and over again&quot;.

== Professional football career ==

After his match with Goldberg at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, Lesnar sidelined his career in WWE to pursue a career in the National Football League (NFL), despite not playing football since high school. WWE issued this statement on their official website, WWE.com, following his departure:

Lesnar later told a Minnesota radio show that he had &quot;three wonderful years&quot; in WWE, but had grown unhappy and always wanted to play professional football, adding that he did not want to be 40 years old and wondering if he could have &quot;made it&quot; in football. In an interview about the NFL, he stated:

Lesnar had a great showing at the NFL Scouting Combine, but on April 17, a minivan collided with his motorbike and he suffered a broken jaw and left hand, a bruised pelvis and a pulled groin. Several NFL teams expressed interest in watching Lesnar work out. The Minnesota Vikings worked out Lesnar on June 11, but he was hampered by the groin injury suffered in the April motorcycle accident. On July 24, it was reported that he was nearly recovered from his groin injury. He signed with the Vikings on July 27 and played in several preseason games for the team. He was released by the Vikings on August 30. Lesnar received an invitation to play as a representative for the Vikings in NFL Europa, but declined due to his desire to stay in the United States with his family. He had several football cards produced of him during his time with the Vikings.

== Mixed martial arts career ==
=== Hero&#x27;s (2007) ===
On April 29, 2006, after the final match of the K-1 World Grand Prix 2006 in Las Vegas, Lesnar stated his intent to join K-1&#x27;s mixed martial arts league, Hero&#x27;s. He trained with Minnesota Martial Arts Academy under Greg Nelson and Minnesota assistant head wrestling coach Marty Morgan. Lesnar signed the deal in August. His first fight was scheduled against Hong-man Choi of South Korea on June 2, 2007, at the Dynamite!! USA show. Prior to the match, Choi was replaced by Min-soo Kim. Lesnar submitted Kim with strikes in 1:09 of the first round to win his first official MMA match.

=== Ultimate Fighting Championship (2008–2011) ===
==== Debut and UFC Heavyweight Champion ====
During UFC 77 on October 20, Lesnar joined Ultimate Fighting Championship with a one-fight contract. On February 2, 2008, Lesnar made his debut with the promotion at UFC 81 against former UFC Heavyweight Champion Frank Mir. Due to his large hands, Lesnar was wearing 4XL gloves for the fight, making him the second man in Nevada&#x27;s combat sports history to wear such gloves, after Hong-man Choi. Lesnar secured an early takedown and began landing numerous punches, but was docked a point, after a punch hit Mir on the back of the head. He scored another takedown and continued landing ground and pound, before Mir secured a kneebar and forced a submission at 1:30 of the first round.

Despite losing on his debut, he was offered a new contract and at UFC 82 on March 1, former UFC Heavyweight Champion and Hall of Famer Mark Coleman was announced to fight Lesnar at UFC 87. Coleman withdrew from the fight due to an injury and was replaced by Heath Herring. In the first round Lesnar scored an early knockdown and went on to dominate the fight winning via unanimous decision by 30–26 on all three judges&#x27; scorecards.

Lesnar then faced Randy Couture for the UFC Heavyweight Championship at UFC 91 on November 15. He denied Couture&#x27;s takedown attempts and outstruck him on the feet, eventually knocking him down and landing ground and pound until he was awarded the technical knockout and UFC Heavyweight Championship.

On December 27 at UFC 92, Mir defeated Antônio Nogueira for the Interim Heavyweight Championship and was to face Lesnar for the Undisputed UFC Heavyweight Championship at UFC 98. Immediately after winning the Interim Heavyweight title, Mir found Lesnar in the crowd and shouted, &quot;You&#x27;ve got my belt&quot;. Due to a knee injury to Mir, the title unification match with Lesnar that was originally slated to be the &quot;UFC 98&quot; main event was postponed. Lesnar instead fought Mir at UFC 100 on July 11, 2009. Mir attempted to grab ahold of Lesnar&#x27;s leg early in the fight but was denied and Lesnar held top position landing punches for the rest of the round. In the second round, the two traded blows but Mir hurt Lesnar with a knee and a punch, leading him to take Mir down and land heavy ground and pound winning the fight via technical knockout. During his post-match celebration, Lesnar flipped off the crowd who had been booing him. Lesnar also made a disparaging comment about the pay-per-view&#x27;s primary sponsor Bud Light, claiming they &quot;won&#x27;t pay me nothin and promoted Coors Light instead. Lesnar later apologized for his remarks at the post-fight press conference, where he held a bottle of Bud Light and endorsed their product.

On July 1, it was reported that the winner of the Shane Carwin vs. Cain Velasquez fight at UFC 104 would face Lesnar, but the match was scrapped and Lesnar was scheduled to defend the title against Carwin at UFC 106 on November 21. On October 2, Lesnar pulled out of his Carwin bout due to an illness. UFC President Dana White said Lesnar had been ill for three weeks, claiming he had never been this sick in his life and that it would take him a while to recover, therefore his fight with Carwin was rescheduled for UFC 108 on January 2, 2010. Lesnar initially sought treatment in Canada, but later told reporters that he had received &quot;Third World treatment&quot; at a hospital in Brandon, Manitoba and that seeking better treatment in the United States saved his life. Lesnar went on to criticize Canadian health care further and stated that he shared his experience to speak &quot;on the behalf of the doctors in the United States that don&#x27;t want health care reform to happen&quot;.

On November 4, it was confirmed that Lesnar had mononucleosis and that his bout with Carwin would have to wait a bit longer and the fight for Lesnar&#x27;s heavyweight championship was canceled. On November 14 at the UFC 105 post-fight conference, White stated, &quot;[Lesnar]&#x27;s not well and he&#x27;s not going to be getting well anytime soon&quot; and that an interim title match might need to be set up. In addition to mononucleosis, it was revealed that he had developed a serious case of diverticulitis, an intestinal disorder, which required surgery. After further diagnosis, Lesnar underwent surgery on November 16 to close a perforation in his intestine that had been leaking fecal matter into his abdomen, causing pain, abscesses and overtaxing his immune system to the point that he contracted mononucleosis. From the level of damage to Lesnar&#x27;s system, the surgeon estimated that the intestinal condition had been ongoing for around a year.

In January 2010, Lesnar revealed on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; that he was scheduled to make a return to the UFC in the summer. A match between Mir and Carwin took place on March 27 at UFC 111 to determine the Interim Heavyweight Champion and Lesnar&#x27;s next opponent. Carwin defeated Mir via knockout in the first round, becoming the new Interim Champion. After the fight, Lesnar came into the ring and stated, &quot;It was a good fight but he&#x27;s wearing a belt that&#x27;s a make-believe belt. I&#x27;ve got the real championship belt&quot;. Lesnar faced Carwin at UFC 116 on July 3, to unify the heavyweight titles. Early in the first round, Carwin knocked Lesnar down with heavy punches, and continued landing ground and pound throughout the round, opening a cut on Lesnar&#x27;s eye. In the next round, Carwin was noticeably fatigued and Lesnar scored a takedown, attained full mount, then move into side-control and finish the fight with an arm-triangle choke. With the victory, Lesnar became the undisputed UFC Heavyweight Champion, earning his first Submission of the Night and giving Carwin his first loss. The win also tied a UFC record for most consecutive successful UFC Heavyweight Championship defenses.

==== Title loss and first retirement ====
Lesnar&#x27;s next defense was against undefeated top contender Cain Velasquez on October 23 at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California at UFC 121. Dana White announced via SportsNation that the UFC would bring back &quot;UFC Primetime&quot; to hype the fight. In the first round, Lesnar scored a takedown and land some heavy knees but eventually succumbed to Velasquez&#x27;s superior striking and was finished by technical knockout late in the round.

Lesnar was advertised as a coach of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter Season 13&quot;, opposite Junior dos Santos, with the two expected to fight on June 11 at UFC 131, but he was struck with another bout of diverticulitis and had to withdraw from the fight on May 12. He was replaced by Shane Carwin, who ended up losing against dos Santos. Lesnar underwent surgery on May 27 to help battle his problems with diverticulitis. White said that he had a 12-inch piece of his colon removed.

In its May 2011 issue, &quot;ESPN&quot; magazine published a story listing the highest-paid athlete based on base salary and earnings for the most recent calendar year or most recent season in 30 sports. Lesnar topped the list for MMA at $5.3 million, which included his reported bout salaries and estimated pay-per-view bonuses.

In the summer of 2011, Lesnar announced that he was returning to action, stating, &quot;I feel like a new man. Healthy. Strong. I feel like I used to feel&quot;. His return match was scheduled to be at UFC 141 on December 30 in Las Vegas against former Strikeforce heavyweight champion Alistair Overeem. Lesnar attempted to takedown Overeem but was unable and ate heavy body shots to his surgically repaired stomach, eventually being finished with a liver kick and punches. Lesnar then retired from MMA, mentioning his struggles with diverticulitis and saying &quot;tonight was the last time you&#x27;ll see me in the octagon&quot;.

Speculation about a return to MMA lasted until March 24, 2015, when Lesnar revealed in an interview on &quot;SportsCenter&quot; that he had re-signed with WWE and officially closed the door on a return to MMA, even though he was offered a deal &quot;ten times more&quot; than what he had made previously in his MMA career. He further elaborated that, while he was training for months for a return to the UFC, he felt &quot;physically great but something was lacking mentally&quot;. Lesnar added that &quot;[he&#x27;s] an older caveman now, so [he] makes smarter caveman decisions&quot; and that he chose to sign with WWE instead of returning to MMA because he could &quot;work part-time with full-time pay&quot;.

=== Return to the UFC (2016–2018) ===
==== Fight against Mark Hunt ====
Though Lesnar said he was &quot;closing the door on MMA&quot; in March 2015, UFC announced on June 4, 2016, that he would return at UFC 200 on July 9. WWE confirmed it had granted Lesnar &quot;a one-off opportunity&quot; to compete at UFC 200 before he returned to the company for SummerSlam on August 21. Lesnar dominated the first and third rounds, battering Hunt with ground and pound in the third to secure the unanimous decision win. He also was paid a UFC record $2.5 million purse. This record was broken at UFC 202 by Conor McGregor, who was also the previous holder.

==== Suspension and second retirement ====
On July 15, 2016, Lesnar was notified of a potential anti-doping policy violation by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) stemming from an undisclosed banned substance in an out-of-competition sample collected on June 28. On July 19, a second test sample taken in-competition on July 9 was revealed as positive for the same banned substance discovered in the previous out-of-competition sample. On August 23, the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) confirmed that Lesnar had twice been tested positive for clomiphene and was suspended.

On December 15, it was confirmed that Lesnar was fined $250,000 and suspended from competition for one year by the NSAC. He would be eligible to return in July 2017. As a result of the suspension, the result of his fight with Mark Hunt was overturned to a no contest. As of January 2019, Lesnar has yet to pay the fine.

On February 14, 2017, it was reported that Lesnar had notified UFC he was retiring from MMA for the second time. On July 7, 2018, Lesnar stormed the cage after the main event fight at UFC 226 and challenged the new UFC Heavyweight Champion, Daniel Cormier. On July 8, USADA confirmed that Lesnar had begun the process to get back into their drug-testing pool. UFC officials were reportedly targeting a bout between Lesnar and Cormier for the UFC Heavyweight Championship, but Dana White claimed Lesnar told him he was &quot;done&quot; with MMA and the bout ultimately did not occur.

In September 2020, White said he could organize a fight between Lesnar and Jon Jones if both men wanted it. That same month, Bellator president Scott Coker expressed interest in booking Lesnar to fight Fedor Emelianenko. Lesnar did not respond to either man&#x27;s comments, and once again confirmed in March 2022 that he would stay retired.

== Other media ==
In 2003, WWE Home Video released a DVD chronicling Lesnar&#x27;s career entitled &quot;Brock Lesnar: Here Comes the Pain&quot;. It was re-released in 2012 as a three-disc DVD and two-disc Blu-ray collector&#x27;s edition to tie in with Lesnar&#x27;s WWE return. It was also expanded to include new matches and interviews. In 2016, a new home video was released on DVD and Blu-ray, as well as a collector&#x27;s edition, called &quot;Brock Lesnar: Eat. Sleep. Conquer. Repeat.&quot; and includes accomplishments from his second run in WWE.

Lesnar was featured on the covers of &quot;Flex&quot; and &quot;Muscle &amp; Fitness&quot; magazine in 2004 and Minneapolis&#x27; &quot;City Pages&quot; in 2008. He is the cover athlete for the &quot;WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain&quot;, &quot;UFC Undisputed 2010&quot; and &quot;WWE 2K17&quot; video games.

In 2009, Lesnar signed an endorsement deal with Dymatize Nutrition. A CD containing footage of Lesnar training was included with Dymatize&#x27;s &quot;Xpand&quot; product.

Lesnar co-wrote an autobiography with Paul Heyman, titled &quot;Death Clutch: My Story of Determination, Domination, and Survival&quot;, which was published by William Morrow and Company in 2011.

In a 2013 post on his blog, &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; author Hajime Isayama revealed that he drew inspiration from Lesnar for the character of the Armored Titan.

== Personal life ==

Lesnar married fellow WWE performer Rena Greek, better known as Sable, on May 6, 2006. They relocated in 2014 to Canada, where they reside on a farm in Maryfield, Saskatchewan. Together, they have two sons named Turk (born 2009) and Duke (born 2010), both of whom play ice hockey. With his former fiancée, Nicole McClain, Lesnar also has twins who were born in 2002: a daughter named Mya Lynn, who competes in track and field, and a son named Luke, who also plays ice hockey. He is also the stepfather of Greek&#x27;s daughter with her first husband.

Lesnar is an intensely private individual who has expressed his disdain for the media; he rarely participates in interviews and avoids questions pertaining to his private life. He is a supporter of the Republican Party and a member of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA). He made an appearance at the NRA&#x27;s annual meeting in May 2011 to discuss his passion for hunting and his role as a spokesman for the Fusion Ammunition company. He is a fan of the Winnipeg Jets ice hockey team and the Saskatchewan Roughriders Canadian football team.

Lesnar developed addictions to alcohol and painkillers during his first run in WWE, later claiming that he would drink a bottle of vodka per day and take hundreds of Vicodin pills per month to manage the pain caused by wear and tear on his body. He cited the incident in which he botched a shooting star press at WrestleMania XIX and landed on the top of his head as a primary source of pain. As a result of the addiction and mental exhaustion, he says that he cannot remember the entire two years that made up his first WWE tenure.

== Legal issues ==
In January 2001, Lesnar was arrested in Louisville, Kentucky, for suspicion of possessing large amounts of illegal substances. The charges were dropped when it was discovered that the substances were legal hormones. His lawyer described it as a &quot;vitamin type of thing&quot;.

Lesnar had previously signed a non-compete clause in order to be released from his contract with WWE, which prohibited him from working for any other professional wrestling companies before June 2010. He challenged this ruling in court. WWE responded with a counterclaim after Lesnar breached the agreement by appearing at a New Japan Pro-Wrestling show in 2004. In July 2005, the two sides dropped their claims and entered negotiations to renew their relationship. WWE had offered Lesnar a contract, but on August 2, their official website reported that Lesnar had withdrawn from any involvement with the company. The lawsuit began to enter settlement talks on September 21, but did not get solved.

On January 14, 2006, Judge Christopher Droney stated that unless WWE gave him a good argument between then and the 25th, he would rule in favor of Lesnar, giving him a summary judgment. This would have enabled Lesnar to work anywhere immediately. WWE was later granted a deadline postponement. On April 24, both parties reached a settlement. On June 12, a federal judge dismissed the case at the request of both legal parties.

On December 15, 2011, Lesnar was charged with hunting infractions on a trip to Alberta on November 19, 2010. Two charges were dropped, but Lesnar pleaded guilty to the charge of improper tagging of an animal. He was fined $1,725 and given a six-month hunting suspension.

<doc id="316593" wikidata="Q550493" url="?curid=316593" title="Darrell Huff">
<text>Darrell Huff (July 15, 1913 – June 27, 2001) was an American writer, and is best known as the author of &quot;How to Lie with Statistics&quot; (1954), the best-selling statistics book of the second half of the twentieth century.

==Career==
Huff was born in Gowrie, Iowa, and educated at the University of Iowa, (BA 1938, MA 1939). Before turning to full-time writing in 1946, Huff served as editor of &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot; and &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine. As a freelancer, Huff produced hundreds of &quot;How to&quot; feature articles and wrote at least sixteen books, most of which concerned household projects. One of his biggest projects was a prize-winning home in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, where he lived until his death.

==Personal life==
Huff married Frances Marie Nelson in 1937. At her instigation, Huff gave up his editorial work (which had become a &quot;rat race&quot; for him) and they moved to California in 1946, bought ten acres in the Valley of the Moon. They built their own house, and later several more houses. Frances Marie would sometimes be Huff&#x27;s co-author. They had four daughters. Two would assist with his last books.

==Social role and reception ==
Huff is credited with introducing statistics to a generation of college and high-school students through clear writing and amusing anecdotes, even though he had no formal training in statistics. His most famous book, &quot;How to Lie with Statistics&quot;, was &quot;possibly the most popular book on statistics ever published&quot;. His books have been published in over 22 languages.

Huff also worked for the cigarette companies. Stanford historian Robert N. Proctor wrote that Huff &quot;was paid to testify before Congress in the 1950s and then again in the 1960s, with the assigned task of ridiculing any notion of a cigarette-disease link. On March 22, 1965, Huff testified at hearings on cigarette labeling and advertising, accusing the recent Surgeon General&#x27;s report of myriad failures and &#x27;fallacies&#x27;.&quot;

Huff was later funded by the tobacco industry to publish a follow-up to his book on statistics: &quot;How to Lie with Smoking Statistics&quot; as an counterattack to the Surgeon General&#x27;s 1964 Smoking and Health report. The book was intended to be published by Macmillan, but near the end of 1968, the plans for its publication came to an abrupt halt for unclear reasons. It was not until the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement in 1998 that the existence of the book, letters between Huff and tobacco industry lawyers discussing it, and the entire unpublished manuscript itself became publicly available. Huff himself never gave an explanation why the project was stopped. Gelman (Columbia University) suggested Huff could have intentionally killed the project to save his reputation, but thinks we&#x27;ll never known since the documents provide no clue.

<doc id="316594" wikidata="Q1718707" url="?curid=316594" title="Sauk-Suiattle">
<text>The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe (; Commonly known as the Sauk-Suiattle Tribe) is a federally-recognized tribe of Sauk people located in western Washington state. The tribe historically lived along the banks of the Sauk, Suiattle, Cascade, Stillaguamish, and Skagit rivers, in the area known as Sauk Prairie at the foot of Whitehorse Mountain in the North Cascade Range.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Sauk-Suiattle&quot; is a combination of the names for two groups of people. The Sauk are the ethnic group who make up the majority of the population of the tribe today, while &quot;Suiattle&quot; ()&quot;&quot; is a term used for those among the Sauk who travelled to the Suiattle River during the summer, and is not an ethnic identifier. However, due to the closeness of the two groups, they are commonly known together as the &quot;Sauk-Suiattle.&quot;

The name for the Sauk-Suiattle in Lushootseed is . The first part of the name, (also spelled or ) was recorded on the Treaty of Point Elliott as &quot;Sah-ku-méhu&quot; or &quot;Sah-ku-me-hu.&quot; The Sauk were also recorded as the Sabbu-uqu.

==History==

For generations, the Sauk () lived in the Sauk River valley, fishing, hunting, and gathering along the waterways of the Sauk, Suiattle, Cascade, Skagit, and Stillaguamish rivers. The people traveled to Puget Sound and across the mountains as well, using horses and canoes for travel.

In 1855, the aboriginal Sauk people were party to the Treaty of Point Elliot at what is now Mukilteo, Washington. The Sauk were listed on the treaty as the Sah-ku-mehu (spelled also Sah-ku-me-hu). The man appointed as &quot;chief,&quot; Wawsitkin, refused to sign the treaty, because he feared they would not receive a reservation. Thus, Dahtldemin, an appointed &quot;sub-chief,&quot; was the signatory for the Sah-ku-me-hu.

The Sauk had an important village at Sauk Prairie, near the confluence of the Sauk and Suiattle rivers, which had eight longhouses. This village was destroyed in the 1880s by American settlers claiming land under the Homestead Act of 1862. Due to this encroachment by settlers, many were forced to move to local reservations such as the Swinomish Reservation.

The Sauk continued to seek reparations from the United States government, and in 1936, sued in the Indian Claims Commission. Their case was dismissed as the commission found that they were not a distinct tribal entity, separate from the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe (with whom they were currently affiliated). They were included in the Upper Skagit claim, which was allowed.

In 1946, the Sauk separated from the Upper Skagit, forming their own government and seeking federal recognition as a sovereign nation. They received this on September 17, 1975. They also received a reservation in 1984, which, as of 2008, was 84 acres. 

==Government==
In 1946, the Sauk-Suiattle separated from the Upper Skagit and wrote a constitution and bylaws. The Sauk-Suiattle Tribe achieved federal recognition on September 17, 1975. Their constitution and bylaws were approved by the Secretary of the Interior on the same day.

The Sauk-Suiattle Tribe is governed by the seven-member Sauk-Suiattle Tribal Council. The current membership of the Tribal Council is as follows.

* Nino Maltos (chairperson)
* Nino Maltos Sr. (vice-chair)
* Natalie Misanses (secretary)
* Demi Maltos (treasurer)
* Karen Misanes
* Cammie Carrigan
* Alen Price

== Sauk-Suiattle Indian Reservation ==
The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Reservation is an Indian reservation belonging to the Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe, located in western Washington state. The reservation was established on July 9, 1984, and was originally 15 acres. By 2008, the reservation had grown to 84 acres. 23 acres are in trust, while the rest is in the process of gaining trust status.

The tribe also holds additional lands in trust jointly with the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe, and individual citizens own public-domain allotments.

The reservation is located near the present-day town of Darrington. It lies in two non-contiguous sections: the largest () is in southern Skagit County, comprising , or 73.5 percent of the reservation&#x27;s total land area and all of its resident population of 45 persons (2000 census); the smaller section (), in northern Snohomish County, has a land area of and no resident population.

==Economy and services==
The tribe operates several services, including education, medical, housing, and natural resources services. The Health and Social Services department of the tribe operates a community clinic in Darrington. The department provides health care, social services, drug and alcohol prevention, rehabilitation, and counseling. The tribe also operates a preschool and daycare on the reservation, where they offer nutrition, language, wellness, and family services. In 2004, the Sauk-Suiattle became the first tribe in Washington to receive a tribal Wi-Fi hotspot and high-speed wireless.

The tribe operates a smokeshop and a country store through its economic development group. It opened a casino and bingo hall located on Washington State Route 530 in September 2018 It closed less than a year later. In early 2021 they opened a marijuana store.

The tribe has a police department (with six members on the force) and natural resources enforcement (nine members).

Under the Point Elliot Treaty, the Sauk-Suiattle has fishing rights on the rivers. They are a member of the Skagit River System Cooperative together with the Swinomish.

==Demographics==
Around 1855, the Sauk-Suiattle were estimated to be around 4,000. By 1924, their population had decreased to 18. In 1985, their population was 260, and by 2008, it was 233. As of 2024, the Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe has at least 314 citizens, with some estimates going as high as 350.

The tribe sets the requirements for citizenship. Individuals seeking to enroll must have at least 1/4 Indian blood and proof of descendancy from one or more Native American ancestors recorded in the 1942 federal census as living in the Sauk River valley.

==Culture==
The tribe celebrates an annual pow-wow, held in August in Darrington, Washington. It also holds traditional stickgames at the same time.

The language of the Sauk-Suiattle is Lushootseed, a Coast Salish language historically spoken by a number of peoples from roughly modern-day Bellingham to Olympia. The last native speaker of the Lushootseed language within the Sauk-Suiattle community, Katherine Brown Joseph, died in 2007.

<text>Henry Gregor Felsen (August 16, 1916 – March 2, 1995) was an American writer, particularly of middle grade (MG) and teen (YA) books. He wrote both under his own name and a title under the pen name of Angus Vicker.

==Biography==

Felsen was born and attended school in Brooklyn, the son of Harry and Sabina Bedrick Felsen. He attended the University of Iowa for two years, where he met his first wife Penny, from whom he was later divorced.

He taught part-time at Drake University (1964–1969), and in 1977 left Iowa to spend his remaining years travelling. His second wife Karen Kangas survived him, as did a son (Dan) and daughter (Holly) from his first marriage, and two stepchildren.

==Career==

After struggling financially during the Great Depression, Felsen sold nine books and hundreds of stories in his first eighteen months of full-time freelance writing in the early 1940s. After war service with the Marine Corps, during which he edited the Corps magazine &quot;Leatherneck&quot; and also wrote magazine articles while stationed in the Pacific, he returned to Iowa where he lived for most of the rest of his life.

His best-selling book was &quot;Hot Rod&quot;, one of a rodding series that also included &quot;Street Rod&quot; and &quot;Crash Club&quot; and sold about eight million copies in all. He wrote about 60 books, many of them moralistically exploring the evils of drugs, sexism and racism.

He is also credited with one screenplay, for the 1968 film &quot;Fever Heat&quot;, based on his novel of the same name which had been published under the pen name of Angus Vicker.

<text>Sleepycat Software, Inc. was the software company primarily responsible for maintaining the Berkeley DB packages from 1996 to 2006.

==Company==
Berkeley DB is freely-licensed database software originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley for 4.4BSD Unix. Developers from that project founded Sleepycat in 1996 to provide commercial support after a request by Netscape to provide new features in the software. In February 2006, Sleepycat was acquired by Oracle Corporation, which continued developing Berkeley DB.

The founders of the company were spouses Margo Seltzer and Keith Bostic, who are also original authors of Berkeley DB. Another original author, Michael Olson, was the President and CEO of Sleepycat. They were all at University of California, Berkeley, where they developed the software that grew to become Berkeley DB. Sleepycat was originally based in Carlisle, Massachusetts and moved to Lincoln, Massachusetts.

Sleepycat distributed Berkeley DB under a proprietary software license that included standard commercial features, and simultaneously under the newly created Sleepycat License, which allows open source use and distribution of Berkeley DB with a copyleft redistribution condition similar to the GNU General Public License.

Sleepycat had offices in California, Massachusetts and the United Kingdom, and was profitable during its entire existence.

<doc id="316603" wikidata="Q457933" url="?curid=316603" title="S. R. Ranganathan">
<text>Shiyali Ramamrita Ranganathan ( 12 August 1892 – 27 September 1972) was an Indian librarian and mathematician. His most notable contributions to the field were his five laws of library science and the development of the first major faceted classification system, the colon classification. He is considered to be the father of library science, documentation, and information science in India and is widely known throughout the rest of the world for his fundamental thinking in the field. His birthday is observed every year as National Librarian Day in India.

He was a university librarian and professor of library science at Banaras Hindu University (1945–47) and professor of library science at the University of Delhi (1947–55), the first Indian school of librarianship to offer higher degrees. He was president of the Indian Library Association from 1944 to 1953. In 1957 he was elected as an honorary member of the International Federation for Information and Documentation (FID) and was made vice-president for life of the Library Association of Great Britain.

==Early life and education==
Ranganathan was born on 9 August 1892 in Sirkazhi, Mayiladuthurai district, Tamil Nadu into a Brahmin family. His birth date is sometimes written as 12 August 1892 but he wrote his own birth date as 9 August 1892 in his book, &quot;The Five Laws of Library Science&quot;.

Ranganathan began his professional life as a mathematician; he earned B.A. and M.A. degrees in mathematics from Madras Christian College in his home state, and then went on to earn a teaching license in 1917. His lifelong goal was to teach mathematics, and he was successively a member of the mathematics faculties at universities in Mangalore, Coimbatore, and Madras. As a mathematics professor, he published papers mainly on the history of mathematics. His career as an educator was somewhat hindered by stammering (a difficulty he gradually overcame in his professional life). The government of India awarded the Padma Shri to Ranganathan in 1957 for valuable contributions to library science.

==Early career==

In 1923, the University of Madras created the post of University Librarian to oversee their poorly organized collection. Among the 900 applicants for the position, none had any formal training in librarianship, and Ranganathan&#x27;s handful of papers satisfied the search committee&#x27;s requirement that the candidate should have a research background. His only knowledge of librarianship came from an &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; article he read days before the interview. Ranganathan was initially reluctant to pursue the position, and had forgotten about his application by the time he was called for an interview. To his surprise, he received the appointment and accepted the position in January 1924.

At first, Ranganathan found the solitude of the position intolerable. Within weeks, complaining of total boredom, he went back to the university administration to ask for his teaching position back. A deal was struck wherein Ranganathan would travel to London to study contemporary Western practices in librarianship and if he returned and still rejected librarianship as a career, the mathematics lectureship would be his again.

Ranganathan travelled to University College London, which at that time housed the only graduate degree program in library science in Britain. At University College, he earned marks only slightly above average, but his mathematical background made him latch onto the problem of classification, a subject typically taught by rote in library programs of the time. As an outsider, he focused on what he perceived to be flaws with the popular decimal classification, and began to explore new possibilities on his own.

He also devised the Acknowledgment of Duplication, which states that any system of classification of information necessarily implies at least two different classifications for any given datum. He anecdotally proved this with the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) by taking several books and showing how each might be classified with two totally different resultant DDC numbers. For example, a book on &quot;warfare in India&quot; could be classified under &quot;warfare&quot; or &quot;India&quot;. Even a general book on warfare could be classified under &quot;warfare&quot;, &quot;history&quot;, &quot;social organisation&quot;, &quot;Indian essays&quot;, or many other headings, depending upon the viewpoint, needs, and prejudices of the classifier. To Ranganathan, a structured, step-by-step system acknowledging each facet of the topic of the work was preferable to the &quot;intellectual laziness&quot; (as he termed it) of the DDC. Given the poor technology for information retrieval available at that time, the implementation of this concept was a large step forwards for the science of information retrieval.

He began drafting the system that would ultimately become colon classification while in England, and refined it as he returned home, even reordering the ship&#x27;s library on his voyage back to India. He initially got the idea for the system from seeing a Meccano set in a toy store in London. Ranganathan returned with interest in librarianship and a vision of its importance for India. He returned to and held the position of University Librarian at the University of Madras for twenty years. During that time, he helped to found the Madras Library Association, and lobbied actively for the establishment of free public libraries throughout India and for the creation of a comprehensive national library. 

Ranganathan was considered by many to be a workaholic. During his two decades in Madras, he consistently worked 13-hour days, seven days a week, without taking vacations. Although he married in November 1928, he returned to work the afternoon following the marriage ceremony. A few years later, he and his wife Sarada had a son. The couple remained married until Ranganathan&#x27;s death.

The first few years of Ranganathan&#x27;s tenure at Madras were years of deliberation and analysis as he addressed the problems of library administration and classification. It was during this period that he produced what have come to be known as his two greatest legacies: his five laws of library science (1931) and the colon classification system (1933).

Ranganathan sought to institute massive changes to the library system and to write about such things as open access and education for all. His changes to the library resulted in more available education and information available to all, including women and minorities. When writing about the harmful effects of low budget on the good functioning of a library, Ranganathan described it as &quot;making an Ulster of the ... law of parsimony.&quot;

==Later career==

After two decades of serving as librarian at Madras – a post he had intended to keep until his retirement –, Ranganathan resigned from his position at the age of 54 after conflicts with a new university vice-chancellor. After a brief bout with depression, he accepted a professorship in library science at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi, his last formal academic position, in August 1945. There, he catalogued the university&#x27;s collection; by the time he left four years later, he had personally classified over 100,000 items.

Ranganathan headed the Indian Library Association from 1944 to 1953, but left amid controversy when the Delhi Public Library chose to use the Dewey Decimal Classification system instead of his own colon classification. He held an honourary professorship at Delhi University from 1949 to 1955 and helped build that institution&#x27;s library science programs with Surendranath Dasgupta, a former student of his. While at Delhi, Ranganathan drafted a comprehensive 30-year plan for the development of an advanced library system for the whole of India. In 1951, Ranganathan released an album on Folkways Records entitled, &quot;Readings from the Ramayana: In Sanskrit Bhagavad Gita.&quot;

Ranganathan briefly moved to Zürich from 1955 to 1957, when his son married a European woman; this allowed him to expand his contacts within the European library community, where he gained a significant following. However, he soon returned to India and settled in the city of Bangalore, where he spent the rest of his life. While in Zürich, he endowed a professorship at Madras University in honour of his wife.

Ranganathan established the Documentation Research and Training Centre of the Indian Statistical Institute in Bangalore in 1962, where he served as honorary director for five years. In 1965, the Indian government honoured him for his contributions to the field with the title of National Research Professor.

In the final years of his life, Ranganathan suffered from ill health and was largely confined to his bed. On 27 September 1972, he succumbed to complications from bronchitis.

Upon the 1992 centenary of his birth, several biographical volumes and collections of essays on Ranganathan&#x27;s influence were published in his honour. Ranganathan&#x27;s autobiography, published serially during his life, is titled &quot;A Librarian Looks Back&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==
Ranganathan dedicated his book &quot;The Five Laws of Library Science&quot; to his maths tutor at Madras Christian College, Edward Burns Ross. Ranganathan’s influence was analyzed bibliometrically in 1992. His birthday, August 12, has been denoted National Librarians&#x27; Day in India.

<text>The five laws of library science is a theory that S. R. Ranganathan proposed in 1931, detailing the principles of operating a library system. Many librarians from around the world accept the laws as the foundations of their philosophy.

These laws, as presented in Ranganathan&#x27;s &quot;The Five Laws of Library Science&quot;, are:
#Books are for use.
#Every person his or her book. 
#Every book its reader.
#Save the time of the reader.
#A library is a growing organism.

==Overview==

===First Law: Books are for use===
The first law of library science, &quot;Books are for use,&quot; constitutes the basis for library services. This law means that books in libraries are not meant to be shut away from users. Ranganathan observed that books were often chained to prevent their removal and that the emphasis was on storage and preservation rather than use. He did not reject the notion that preservation and storage were important, but he asserted that the purpose of such activities should be to promote use. Without user access to materials, there is little value in these items. By emphasizing use, Dr. Ranganathan refocused the attention of the field to access-related issues, such as the library&#x27;s location, loan policies, hours and days of operation, the quality of staffing, and mundane matters, such as library furniture and temperature control.

===Second Law: Every person his or her book===
The second law of library science, &quot;Every person his or her book,&quot; means that librarians are to serve a wide collection of patrons, acquire literature to fit a wide variety of needs, and refrain from prejudice or judging what specific patrons choose to read. Librarians should respect that everyone is different and that everyone has different tastes regarding the books they choose. After the publication of &quot;The Five Laws of Library Science,&quot; Ranganathan named children, the physically disabled, artisans, newly literate adults, the intellectually disabled, working-class individuals, and individuals with niche interests as specific groups of potential readers that are served through the application of the second law. In addition, a library collection must represent the community it serves.

===Third Law: Every book its reader===
The third law of library science, &quot;Every book its reader,&quot; means all books have a place in the library, even if only a small demographic might choose to read them. Ranganathan later clarified that the term &quot;book&quot; could be generalized to mean any document.

===Fourth Law: Save the time of the reader===
The fourth law of library science, &quot;Save the time of the reader,&quot; means that all patrons should be able to easily locate the materials they desire quickly and efficiently. The practice of librarianship creates systems, services, workflows, guides and frameworks to the benefit of practicality to the user. Ranganathan said the fourth law in turn saves the time of the library staff through such practices as centralized classification and cataloging, documenting materials before sending them to the library that ordered them, and mechanizing methods for information retrieval.

===Fifth Law: A library is a growing organism===
The fifth law of library science, &quot;A library is a growing organism,&quot; means that a library should be a dynamic institution that is never static in its outlook. Ranganathan identified two types of growth: growth that increases the quantity of items in the library&#x27;s collection, and growth that improves the collection&#x27;s overall quality through the replacement of materials. Books, methods, and the physical library should be updated over time. There needs to be a consideration of growing physical space, but in the 21st century this has come to mean the multiple formats and platforms a collection can encompass.

==Variants==

===The Law of Parsimony===
Ranganathan also wrote about what he called &quot;The Law of Parsimony.&quot; According to this law, fiscal resources should generally not be allocated to books that have a limited audience.

===By other individuals===
In 1998, Michael Gorman, a past president of the American Library Association, recommended the following laws in addition to Ranganathan&#x27;s five:

#Libraries serve humanity.
#Respect all forms by which knowledge is communicated.
#Use technology intelligently to enhance service.
#Protect free access to knowledge.
#Honor the past and create the future.

Gorman repeated these laws in Chapter 1 of his book &quot;Future Libraries: Dreams, Madness, &amp; Realities&quot;, which was co-written by Walt Crawford, and in &quot;Our Singular Strengths: Meditations for Librarians.&quot;

In 2004, librarian Alireza Noruzi recommended the application of Ranganathan&#x27;s laws to the Web:

#Web resources are for use.
#Every user has his or her web resource.
#Every web resource its user.
#Save the time of the user.
#The Web is a growing organism.

In 2008, librarian Carol Simpson recommended the following edits to Ranganathan&#x27;s laws to reflect the richness of media:

#Media are for use.
#Every patron his information.
#Every medium its user.
#Save the time of the patron.
#The library is a growing organism.

In 2016, Dr. Achala Munigal recommended the following edits to Ranganathan&#x27;s laws due to the introduction and application of social tools in libraries:

# Social Media is for use – increasingly in libraries by librarians.
# Every user his or her Social Tool.
# Every Social Tool its user.
# Save time of user by providing information he or she seeks using the social tool he or she is familiar with.
# Social Media is a growing organism, with various tools and apps being introduced every day. Libraries are not brick and stone anymore. They serve members and non-members alike in terms of non-traditional library service, irrespective of space and time.

In 2019, Basheerhamad Shadrach proposed the Five Laws of Knowledge, adapted from those of Ranganathan:

#Knowledge is for use in &quot;all&quot; forms.
#&quot;Every citizen&quot; has the right to access &quot;all&quot; forms of knowledge.
#Every knowledge [&quot;sic&quot;] is for access by &quot;all&quot; without discrimination of any kind.
#Save the time of &quot;all&quot; knowledge seekers.
#A knowledge system is one that evolves with time to achieve all of the above laws.

<doc id="316610" wikidata="Q112177529" url="?curid=316610" title="List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Nations">
<text>The United States ambassador to the United Nations is the leader of the U.S. delegation, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. The position is formally known as the permanent representative of the United States of America to the United Nations, with the rank and status of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary, and representative of the United States of America in the United Nations Security Council.

The deputy ambassador assumes the duties of the position in the ambassador&#x27;s absence. As with all United States ambassadors, the ambassador to the UN and the deputy ambassador are both nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. The ambassador serves at the pleasure of the President. The ambassador may be assisted by one or more appointed delegates, often appointed for a specific purpose or issue.

The U.S. permanent representative is charged with representing the United States on the UN Security Council, and during all plenary meetings of the General Assembly, except when a more senior officer of the United States (such as the secretary of state or the president of the United States) is in attendance.

Despite the title head of external mission, the United States ambassador to the United Nations is also responsible for importing United Nations policies and motions voted in the main organs of the United Nations onto the national territory.

The most recent ambassador is Linda Thomas-Greenfield, who was nominated by President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate on February 23, 2021. 

Following his presidential inauguration, Donald Trump formally nominated Elise Stefanik, who is currently serving in the United States House of Representatives, to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in his second term.

== Cabinet status ==
Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., a leading moderate Republican who lost his seat in the United States Senate to John F. Kennedy in the 1952 elections, was appointed ambassador to the United Nations in 1953 by Dwight D. Eisenhower in gratitude for the defeated senator&#x27;s role in the new president&#x27;s defeat of conservative leader Robert A. Taft for the 1952 Republican nomination and subsequent service as his campaign manager in the general election; Eisenhower raised the ambassadorship to Cabinet rank in order to give Lodge direct access to him without having to go through the State Department.

The ambassadorship continued to hold this status throughout the remainder of the Cold War but was removed from Cabinet rank by George H. W. Bush, who had previously held the position himself. It was restored under the Clinton administration. It was not a Cabinet-level position under the George W. Bush administration (from 2001 to 2009), but was once again elevated under the Obama administration, and initially retained as such by the Trump administration during the tenure of Nikki Haley. However, in December 2018, it was reported by several news organizations that the Trump administration would once again downgrade the position to non-Cabinet rank. The position was again elevated to Cabinet rank in the Biden administration.

Former UN ambassador and national security advisor John R. Bolton has publicly opposed the granting of Cabinet-level status to the office, stating &quot;One, it overstates the role and importance the U.N. should have in U.S. foreign policy, second, you shouldn&#x27;t have two secretaries in the same department&quot;.

== List of ambassadors ==
;Status
The following is a chronological list of those who have held the office:

==List of deputy ambassadors==

The United States deputy ambassador to the United Nations serves as the second most senior American diplomat before the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council in New York and carries the diplomatic rank of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary. The deputy ambassador assumes the duties of the position in the ambassador&#x27;s absence.

†These deputy ambassadors later served as full U.S. ambassadors to the United Nations (see above).

==List of deputies to the ambassador==

The deputy to the ambassador to the UN is a separate position from the Senate-confirmed role of deputy ambassador to the United Nations. The deputy to the ambassador assists the U.S. ambassador to the UN by acting as a liaison in Washington, D.C., managing their Washington office, interacting with Congress and acting as a stand-in for the UN ambassador. The two roles co-exist, as in 2019 when Taryn Frideres was Deputy to the Ambassador at the same time that Jonathan Cohen was Deputy Ambassador to the UN.

* Taryn Frideres – October 2019 – February 25, 2021
* Jeffrey Prescott – February 25, 2021 – February 25, 2024
* Ned Price – February 29, 2024 – January 20, 2025

<doc id="316612" wikidata="Q124714" url="?curid=316612" title="Spring (hydrology)">
<text>A spring is a natural exit point at which groundwater emerges from an aquifer and flows across the ground surface as surface water. It is a component of the hydrosphere, as well as a part of the water cycle. Springs have long been important for humans as a source of fresh water, especially in arid regions which have relatively little annual rainfall.

Springs are driven out onto the surface by various natural forces, such as gravity and hydrostatic pressure. A spring produced by the emergence of geothermally heated groundwater is known as a hot spring. The yield of spring water varies widely from a volumetric flow rate of nearly zero to more than for the biggest springs.

== Formation ==

Springs are formed when groundwater flows onto the surface. This typically happens when the water table reaches above the surface level, or if the terrain depresses sharply. Springs may also be formed as a result of karst topography,[aquifers or volcanic activity. Springs have also been observed on the ocean floor, spewing warmer, low-salinity water directly into the ocean.

Springs formed as a result of karst topography create karst springs, in which ground water travels through a network of cracks and fissures—openings ranging from intergranular spaces to large caves, later emerging in a spring.

The forcing of the spring to the surface can be the result of a confined aquifer in which the recharge area of the spring water table rests at a higher elevation than that of the outlet. Spring water forced to the surface by elevated sources are artesian wells. This is possible even if the outlet is in the form of a cave. In this case the cave is used like a hose by the higher elevated recharge area of groundwater to exit through the lower elevation opening.

Non-artesian springs may simply flow from a higher elevation through the earth to a lower elevation and exit in the form of a spring, using the ground like a drainage pipe. Still other springs are the result of pressure from an underground source in the earth, in the form of volcanic or magma activity. The result can be water at elevated temperature and pressure, i.e. hot springs and geysers.
The action of the groundwater continually dissolves permeable bedrock such as limestone and dolomite, creating vast cave systems.

=== Types ===

* Depression springs occur along a depression, such as the bottom of alluvial valleys, basins, or valleys made of highly permeable materials.
* Contact springs, which occur along the side of a hill or mountain, are created when the groundwater is underlaid by an impermeable layer of rock or soil known as an aquiclude or aquifuge
* Fracture, or joint occur when groundwater running along an impermeable layer of rock meets a crack (fracture) or joint in the rock.
* Tubular springs occur when groundwater flows from circular fissures such as those found in caverns (solution tubular springs) or lava tubular springs found in lava tube caves.
* Artesian springs typically occur at the lowest point in a given area. An artesian spring is created when the pressure for the groundwater becomes greater than the pressure from the atmosphere. In this case the water is pushed straight up out of the ground.
* Wonky holes are freshwater submarine exit points for coral and sediment-covered, sediment-filled old river channels.
* Karst springs occur as outflows of groundwater that are part of a karst hydrological system.
* Thermal springs are heated by geothermal activity; they have a water temperature significantly higher than the mean air temperature of the surrounding area. Geysers are a type of hot spring where steam is created underground by trapped superheated groundwater resulting in recurring eruptions of hot water and steam.
* Carbonated springs, such as Soda Springs Geyser, are springs that emit naturally occurring carbonated water, due to dissolved carbon dioxide in the water content. They are sometimes called boiling springs or bubbling springs.
* &quot;Gushette springs pour from cliff faces&quot;
* Helocrene springs are diffuse that sustain marshlands with groundwater.

== Flow ==

Spring discharge, or resurgence, is determined by the spring&#x27;s recharge basin. Factors that affect the recharge include the size of the area in which groundwater is captured, the amount of precipitation, the size of capture points, and the size of the spring outlet. Water may leak into the underground system from many sources including permeable earth, sinkholes, and losing streams. In some cases entire creeks seemingly disappear as the water sinks into the ground via the stream bed. Grand Gulf State Park in Missouri is an example of an entire creek vanishing into the groundwater system. The water emerges away, forming some of the discharge of Mammoth Spring in Arkansas. Human activity may also affect a spring&#x27;s discharge—withdrawal of groundwater reduces the water pressure in an aquifer, decreasing the volume of flow.

=== Classification ===
Springs fall into three general classifications: perennial (springs that flow constantly during the year); intermittent (temporary springs that are active after rainfall, or during certain seasonal changes); and periodic (as in geysers that vent and erupt at regular or irregular intervals).

Springs are often classified by the volume of the water they discharge. The largest springs are called &quot;first-magnitude&quot;, defined as springs that discharge water at a rate of at least 2800 liters or of water per second. Some locations contain many first-magnitude springs, such as Florida where there are at least 27 known to be that size; the Missouri and Arkansas Ozarks, which contain 10 known of first-magnitude; and 11 more in the Thousand Springs area along the Snake River in Idaho. The scale for spring flow is as follows:

==Water content==
Minerals become dissolved in the water as it moves through the underground rocks. This mineral content is measured as total dissolved solids (TDS). This may give the water flavor and even carbon dioxide bubbles, depending on the nature of the geology through which it passes. This is why spring water is often bottled and sold as mineral water, although the term is often the subject of deceptive advertising. Mineral water contains no less than 250 parts per million (ppm) of tds. Springs that contain significant amounts of minerals are sometimes called &#x27;mineral springs&#x27;. (Springs without such mineral content, meanwhile, are sometimes distinguished as &#x27;sweet springs&#x27;.) Springs that contain large amounts of dissolved sodium salts, mostly sodium carbonate, are called &#x27;soda springs&#x27;. Many resorts have developed around mineral springs and are known as spa towns. Mineral springs are alleged to have healing properties. Soaking in them is said to result in the absorption of the minerals from the water. Some springs contain arsenic levels that exceed the 10 ppb World Health Organization (WHO) standard for drinking water. Where such springs feed rivers they can also raise the arsenic levels in the rivers above WHO limits.

Water from springs is usually clear. However, some springs may be colored by the minerals that are dissolved in the water. For instance, water heavy with iron or tannins will have an orange color.

In parts of the United States a stream carrying the outflow of a spring to a nearby primary stream may be called a spring branch, spring creek, or run. Groundwater tends to maintain a relatively long-term average temperature of its aquifer; so flow from a spring may be cooler than other sources on a summer day, but remain unfrozen in the winter. The cool water of a spring and its branch may harbor species such as certain trout that are otherwise ill-suited to a warmer local climate.

===Types of mineral springs===

* Sulfur springs contain a high level of dissolved sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the water. Historically they have been used to alleviate the symptoms of arthritis and other inflammatory diseases.
* Borax springs 
* Gypsum springs
* Saline springs
* Iron springs (chalybeate spring)
* Radium springs (or radioactive springs) have a detectable level of radiation produced by the natural radioactive decay process

== Uses ==

Springs have been used for a variety of human needs - including drinking water, domestic water supply, irrigation, mills, navigation, and electricity generation. Modern uses include recreational activities such as fishing, swimming, and floating; therapy; water for livestock; fish hatcheries; and supply for bottled mineral water or bottled spring water. Springs have taken on a kind of mythic quality in that some people falsely believe that springs are always healthy sources of drinking water. They may or may not be. One must take a comprehensive water quality test to know how to use a spring appropriately, whether for a mineral bath or drinking water. Springs that are managed as spas will already have such a test.

===Drinking water===
Springs are often used as sources for bottled water. When purchasing bottled water labeled as spring water one can often find the water test for that spring on the website of the company selling it.

===Irrigation===
Springs have been used as sources of water for gravity-fed irrigation of crops. Indigenous people of the American Southwest built spring-fed acequias that directed water to fields through canals. The Spanish missionaries later used this method.

=== Sacred springs ===
A sacred spring, or holy well, is a small body of water emerging from underground and revered in some religious context: Christian and/or pagan and/or other. The lore and mythology of ancient Greece was replete with sacred and storied springs—notably, the Corycian, Pierian and Castalian springs. In medieval Europe, pagan sacred sites frequently became Christianized as holy wells. The term &quot;holy well&quot; is commonly employed to refer to any water source of limited size (i.e., not a lake or river, but including pools and natural springs and seeps), which has some significance in local folklore. This can take the form of a particular name, an associated legend, the attribution of healing qualities to the water through the numinous presence of its guardian spirit or of a Christian saint, or a ceremony or ritual centered on the well site. Christian legends often recount how the action of a saint caused a spring&#x27;s water to flow - a familiar theme, especially in the hagiography of Celtic saints.

===Thermal springs===

The geothermally heated groundwater that flows from thermal springs is greater than human body temperature, usually in the range of , but they can be hotter. Those springs with water cooler than body temperature but warmer than air temperature are sometimes referred to as warm springs.

====Bathing and balneotherapy====
Hot springs or geothermal springs have been used for balneotherapy, bathing, and relaxation for thousands of years. Because of the folklore surrounding hot springs and their claimed medical value, some have become tourist destinations and locations of physical rehabilitation centers.
====Geothermal energy====
Hot springs have been used as a heat source for thousands of years. In the 20th century, they became a renewable resource of geothermal energy for heating homes and buildings. The city of Beppu, Japan contains 2,217 hot spring well heads that provide the city with hot water. Hot springs have also been used as a source of sustainable energy for greenhouse cultivation and the growing of crops and flowers.

==Terminology==
* Spring boil
* Spring pool
* Spring runs also called rheocrene springs
* Spring vent

==Cultural representations==
Springs have been represented in culture through art, mythology, and folklore throughout history. The Fountain of Youth is a mythical spring which was said to restore youth to anyone who drank from it. It has been claimed that the fountain is located in St. Augustine, Florida, and was discovered by Juan Ponce de León in 1513. However, it has not demonstrated the power to restore youth, and most historians dispute the veracity of Ponce de León&#x27;s discovery.

Pythia, also known as the Oracle at Delphi was the high priestess of the Temple of Apollo. She delivered prophesies in a frenzied state of divine possession that were &quot;induced by vapours rising from a chasm in the rock&quot;. It is believed that the vapors were emitted from the Kerna spring at Delphi.

The Greek myth of Narcissus describes a young man who fell in love with his reflection in the still pool of a spring. Narcissus gazed into &quot;an unmuddied spring, silvery from its glittering waters, which neither shepherds nor she-goats grazing on the mountain nor any other cattle had touched, which neither bird nor beast nor branch fallen from a tree had disturbed.&quot; (Ovid)

The early 20th century American photographer, James Reuel Smith created a comprehensive series of photographs documenting the historical springs of New York City before they were capped by the city after the advent of the municipal water system. Smith later photographed springs in Europe leading to his book, &quot;Springs and Wells in Greek and Roman Literature, Their Legends and Locations&quot; (1922).

The 19th century Japanese artists Utagawa Hiroshige and Utagawa Toyokuni III created a series of wood-block prints, &quot;Two Artists Tour the Seven Hot Springs (Sōhitsu shichitō meguri)&quot; in 1854.

The Chinese city Jinan is known as &quot;a City of Springs&quot; (Chinese: 泉城), because of its 72 spring attractions and numerous micro spring holes spread over the city centre.

<text>Katharine Lee Bates (August 12, 1859 – March 28, 1929) was an American author and poet, chiefly remembered for her anthem &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;, but also for her many books and articles on social reform, on which she was a noted speaker.

Bates enjoyed close links with Wellesley College, Massachusetts, where she had graduated with a B.A., and later became a professor of English literature, helping to launch American literature as an academic speciality, and writing one of the first-ever college textbooks on it. She never married, possibly because she would have lost tenure if she had. Throughout her long career at Wellesley, she shared a house with her close friend and companion Katharine Coman. Some scholars have assumed that this was a lesbian relationship, considering some exchanges of letters sufficient proof, others believe their relationship may have been a platonic &quot;Boston marriage&quot; in the contemporary phrase.

==Life and career==
Bates was born in Falmouth, Massachusetts, to the town&#x27;s Congregational minister William Bates and Cornelia Frances (Lee) Bates. Her father died a few weeks after she was born, and she was primarily raised by her mother and a literary aunt, both of whom had graduated from the all-women&#x27;s Mount Holyoke Seminary. She attended Wellesley High School (then called Needham High School) in 1872 and then Newton High School until 1876. Bates entered Wellesley College, a women&#x27;s college, as part of its second class in 1876. She graduated with a B.A. in 1880. She taught at Natick High School in 1880–81 and at Dana Hall School from 1881 until 1885.

In 1889, Bates&#x27;s young adult novel &quot;Rose and Thorn&quot; won a prize awarded by the Congregational Sunday School and Publishing Society. It incorporated poor and working class women as characters to teach readers about social reform. She popularized the concept of Mrs. Claus in her poem &quot;Goody Santa Claus on a Sleigh Ride&quot; from the collection &quot;Sunshine and other Verses for Children&quot; (1889). The Mrs. Claus character is the chief organizer of Christmas Eve.

Taking advantage of new educational opportunities available to women after the Civil War, Bates used prize money from &quot;Rose and Thorn&quot; to travel to England and study at Oxford University in 1890–91. She then returned to Wellesley as an associate professor in 1891, earned her M.A. there, and was promoted to a full professor of English literature. Near the end of the Spanish–American War, she worked as a war correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and strove to reduce widely-circulating negative stereotypes about Spaniards. She contributed regularly to periodicals (sometimes under the pseudonym James Lincoln), including &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot;, &quot;Christian Century&quot;, &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s,&quot; and &quot;The Delineator&quot;.

In 1900, she wrote &quot;Spanish Highways and Byways&quot; for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a travelogue that not only described with beauty and precision the landscapes of a post-war Spain, but also made a commentary on the political and social panorama that she found once the war was over. 
Bates&#x27;s style is distinct in that, if Spain is thought of as an orientalized East inside the West, then she applied the Oriental picturesquism concepts to Spanish models, which is a logical paradox. She uses this picturesque technique to depict not just the natural world and art, but also the subjects themselves.

In 1906, Bates and her brother, Arthur, signed a mortgage for a Wellesley houselot and house (now 70 Curve St.) to be built on it for the Bates family (Cornelia, Jeanne, and Katharine) and their tenants. Among the latter was Katharine Coman, who would eventually rent an attic bedroom and photographic darkroom. While the house was being built, Bates traveled to Egypt and the Holy Land with Wellesley College president Caroline Hazard. Upon returning to Wellesley, Bates named the house &quot;The Scarab,&quot; after the sacred Egyptian insect she admired as &quot;always climbing.&quot;
 While working at Wellesley, Bates was elected a member of the newly-formed Pi Gamma Mu honor society for the social sciences because of her interest in history and politics. She retired from Wellesley in 1925 at the age of 66. In retirement, Bates continued to write and to publish poetry, and was in great demand as a writer and speaker.

Bates was also a social activist interested in the struggles of women, workers, people of color, tenement residents, immigrants, and poor people. She helped organize the Denison House, a college women&#x27;s settlement house, with other women friends and colleagues in 1892. She wrote and spoke extensively about the need for social reform and was an avid advocate for the global peace movement that emerged after World War I. She was especially active in attempts to establish the League of Nations. Long an active Republican, Bates broke with the party to endorse Democratic presidential candidate John W. Davis in 1924 because of Republican opposition to American participation in the League of Nations. She said: &quot;Though born and bred in the Republican camp, I cannot bear their betrayal of Mr. Wilson and their rejection of the League of Nations, our one hope of peace on earth.&quot; Thinking of herself as a &quot;global citizen,&quot; Bates decried the American policy of isolationism.

Bates died in Wellesley, Massachusetts, on March 28, 1929, aged 69, while listening to a friend read poetry to her. She is buried in Oak Grove Cemetery at Falmouth. Most of her papers are housed at the Wellesley College Archives and include &quot;diaries, correspondences, musical scores, publications, scrapbooks, manuscripts, reports, memorials and tributes, memorabilia; concerning &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; and other writings of Katharine Lee Bates, her travels, and her life at Wellesley and in Falmouth, Mass.&quot;

==&quot;America the Beautiful&quot;==
The first draft of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; was hastily jotted down in a notebook during the summer of 1893, which Bates spent teaching English at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Later she remembered:
One day some of the other teachers and I decided to go on a trip to 14,000-foot Pikes Peak. We hired a prairie wagon. Near the top we had to leave the wagon and go the rest of the way on mules. I was very tired. But when I saw the view, I felt great joy. All the wonder of America seemed displayed there, with the sea-like expanse.

Bates had personally experienced sexist prejudice and discrimination, had witnessed the ravages of the industrial revolution in both America and Britain, had seen first hand urban poverty and misery, and keenly wished for equality. It was this desire for an all-inclusive egalitarian American community that inspired the poem, which was written during the severe economic depression of 1893. The words to her famous poem first appeared in print in &quot;The Congregationalist&quot;, a weekly journal, for Independence Day, 1895. The poem reached a wider audience when her revised version was printed in the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot; on November 19, 1904. Her final expanded version was written in 1913. When a version appeared in her collection &quot;America the Beautiful, and Other Poems&quot; (1912), a reviewer in the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;we intend no derogation to Miss Katharine Lee Bates when we say that she is a good minor poet.&quot; On November 11, 1918, a battalion of the 26th Infantry Division of the US Army (colloquially known as the Yankee Division) sang &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; upon hearing the announcement of the Armistice. The hymn has been sung to several tunes, but the familiar one is by Samuel A. Ward (1847–1903), written for his hymn &quot;Materna&quot; (1882).

==Relationship with Katharine Coman==

The nature of Bates&#x27;s relationship with her Wellesley College faculty colleague, friend, occasional traveling companion, and &quot;Scarab House&quot; tenant Katharine Coman has been the subject of scholarly discussion for four decades. In her 2017 biography of Bates, Melinda M. Ponder describes Bates as an independent-minded social activist who set an example for women&#x27;s intellectualism and independence in the late 1800s. Bates&#x27; adult diaries and surviving letters confirm Bates&#x27;s warm friendships with several female peers, as well as her intense emotional involvement with, and delight in the companionship of, two men: Oscar Triggs, whom she met while at Oxford, and Theophilus Huntington Root, the brother of one of her Wellesley classmates. That said, the end of her courtship with Theophilus Root precipitated in Bates a period of suicidal depression. Bates never married. Had she done so, she would have lost her tenure-track Wellesley faculty position, as well as some of the independence she was accustomed to from her childhood in a woman-led household and subsequent life-course.

Bates destroyed most of the letters she and Coman had written to each other. One of the few to survive was written by Bates to Coman in 1893, just before she left Oxford to return to Wellesley: &quot;You are always in my heart and in my longings... It was the living away from you that made, at first, the prospect of leaving Wellesley so heartachy ... and it seemed least of all possible when I had just found the long-desire way to your dearest heart.&quot; Ponder stresses Coman&#x27;s importance to Bates in showing her how college professors like themselves could &quot;challenge accepted attitudes towards women&#x27;s social, economic, cultural, and gender roles&quot;. In her virtuosic corona of sonnets &quot;In Bohemia,&quot; Bates celebrates the &quot;vitality, adventurous spirit, and abiding spiritual presence of their love&quot;.

In earlier commentary, Judith Schwarz interpreted Bates&#x27;s letters and poems to Coman as evidence of a lesbian relationship, citing as an example Bates&#x27;s 1891 letter to Coman: &quot;It was never very possible to leave Wellesley [for good], because so many love-anchors held me there, and it seemed least of all possible when I had just found the long-desired way to your dearest heart... Of course I want to come to you, very much as I want to come to Heaven.&quot; And in 1999, historian Lillian Faderman also concluded that the relationship between Bates and Coman was a &quot;lesbian arrangement,&quot; including them among the other women faculty at Wellesley who paired off with each other. Other scholars contest the use of the term lesbian to describe what was characterized at the time as a &quot;Boston marriage&quot;. Writes one: &quot;We cannot say with certainty what sexual connotations these relationships conveyed. We do know that these relationships were deeply intellectual; they fostered verbal and physical expressions of love.&quot; Certainly, Bates long shared rental housing with various Wellesley faculty members, all of whom thereby economized while earning small salaries. Occasionally, she traveled with her long-time friend, Katharine Coman. And in 1910, when a colleague described &quot;free-flying spinsters&quot; as &quot;fringe on the garment of life&quot;, Bates answered: &quot;I always thought the fringe had the best of it. I don&#x27;t think I mind not being woven in.&quot;

Bates&#x27;s and Coman&#x27;s connection is perhaps destined to be interpreted differently by different readers forever. The facts remain that Coman and Bates met at Wellesley by 1890 when the president of Wellesley College, Alice Freeman Palmer, determined to add women to the college&#x27;s faculty. Coman served as a history and political economy professor, and founded the Wellesley College Economics Department. During her lifetime, Coman was nearly as well known as Bates. Both colleagues became influential independent women within their fields during their lifetimes; and Bates&#x27;s work has continued to influence American life and literature to this day. In the days after Coman&#x27;s death from breast cancer in 1915, Bates wrote a memorial to Coman, which is thought to be the first American narrative about breast cancer. Bates intended that the manuscript be privately circulated among the women&#x27;s close circle of friends and family, writing on the title page: &quot;For Katharine Coman&#x27;s family and innermost circle of friends: Not for print nor in any way for general circulation.&quot; In 1922, Bates published &quot;Yellow Clover: A Book of Remembrance&quot;, a collection of poems she had addressed to Coman while alive or since her death. She dedicated the volume to Coman, referred to her as &quot;my Friend [sic]&quot;, and included as a &quot;Prefatory Note&quot; a three-page biography of Coman largely focused on her career as an economist and historian, but written in a tone personal enough to allow a reference to her &quot;vigorous and adventurous personality&quot; and her &quot;undaunted courage&quot; in continuing to work during her final illness.

==Honors==
The Bates family home on Falmouth&#x27;s Main Street is preserved by the Falmouth Historical Society. There is also a street named in her honor, &quot;Katharine Lee Bates Road&quot; in Falmouth. The Shining Sea Bikeway, named in honor of Bates, extends 11 miles from North Falmouth to Woods Hole, passing just a block from the Bates home. A plaque marks the site of the home where she lived as an adult on Centre Street in Newton, Massachusetts. The historic home and birthplace of Bates in Falmouth, was sold to Ruth P. Clark in November 2013 for $1,200,000.

The Katharine Lee Bates Elementary School on Elmwood Road in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and the Katharine Lee Bates Elementary School, founded in 1957 in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Bates Hall dormitory at Wellesley College are named for her. The Katharine Lee Bates Chair in English Composition and Literature was established at Wellesley shortly after her death.

Bates was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

Collections of Bates&#x27;s manuscripts are housed at the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe College; Falmouth Historical Society; Houghton Library, Harvard University; Wellesley College Archives.

In 2012, she was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the 2015 LGBT History Month.

<text>The Klallam (; also known as the S&#x27;Klallam or Clallam) are a Coast Salish people Indigenous to the northern Olympic Peninsula. The language of the Klallam is the Klallam language (), a language closely related to the North Straits Salish languages. The Klallam are today citizens of four recognized bands: Three federally-recognized tribes in the United States and one band government in Canada. Two Klallam tribes, the Jamestown S&#x27;Klallam and Lower Elwha Klallam, live on the Olympic Peninsula, and one, the Port Gamble S&#x27;Klallam, on the Kitsap Peninsula in Washington state. In Canada, the Scia&#x27;new First Nation is based at Becher Bay on southern Vancouver Island in British Columbia.

==Name and etymology==
The Klallam-language name for the tribe is (meaning &quot;strong people&quot;). According to the oral history of the Klallam, the name was earned after the tribe won a challenge around hoisting a log onto a house. They put the log in the water, and then floated it onto their shoulders. When they came back with the log, other tribes started cheering &quot;strong people.&quot;

There exists a wide variety of English spellings including &quot;Chalam,&quot; &quot;Clalam,&quot; &quot;Clallem,&quot; &quot;Clallum,&quot; &quot;Khalam,&quot; &quot;Klalam,&quot; &quot;Noodsdalum,&quot; &quot;Nooselalum,&quot; &quot;Noostlalum,&quot; &quot;Tlalum,&quot; &quot;Tlalam,&quot; &quot;Wooselalim,&quot; &quot;S&#x27;Klallam,&quot; &quot;Ns&#x27;Klallam,&quot; &quot;Klallam&quot; and &quot;Clallam.&quot; &quot;Clallam&quot; was used by the Washington Territory legislature in 1854 when it created Clallam County. The following year &quot;S&#x27;klallam&quot; was used in the Point No Point Treaty. In the following decades the simpler &quot;Klallam&quot; or &quot;Clallam&quot; predominated in the media and research literature. In 1981 &quot;S&#x27;Klallam&quot; was used when the United States Department of the Interior officially recognized the Lower Elwha, Jamestown, and Port Gamble (or Little Boston) tribes.

In local media today &quot;Clallam&quot; is usually used to refer to Clallam County, Washington. It is also used in the names of a number of non-native commercial enterprises. The spellings with &#x27;K&#x27; are used to refer to the native peoples. The Lower Elwha tribe has adopted &quot;Klallam&quot; as its official spelling. The Port Gamble and Jamestown tribes have adopted &quot;S&#x27;Klallam&quot; as their official spelling.

==History==

===Pre-Contact===
Before the arrival of Europeans to the Pacific Northwest the territory inhabited by the Klallam stretched across the north coast of the Olympic Peninsula from the mouth of the Hoko River on the west to Port Discovery Bay on the east. There were also some Klallam living across the Strait of Juan de Fuca on Vancouver Island, in or near today&#x27;s Saanich, Sooke, and Beecher Bay. Klallam villages were mostly located along the coast, while some villages were inland along rivers, inlets or large lakes.

Based on early interviews of tribal elders by early ethnologists and anthropologists, the estimated number of Klallam villages has ranged from ten to over thirty, with some ambiguity in distinguishing permanent from seasonal settlements, and some villages with mixed or disputed tribal identity.

While language and tradition united the Klallam people, there were extensive trade, inter-marriage, and other forms of cooperation between the Klallam and surrounding tribes.

Like many other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest coast, the Klallam held potlatches, which played a large role in determining social status.

===Post-Contact===
Europeans first began to explore the Pacific Northwest coast with Juan Pérez in 1774, James Cook in 1778, and many others, especially maritime fur traders, from the 1780s on. Early explorers did not enter the Strait of Juan de Fuca or make direct contact with the Klallam. By the time direct contact was made, sometime before 1789, the Klallam had already heard about the European newcomers. Charles William Barkley was the first European known to have entered the Strait of Juan de Fuca, in 1787. Robert Gray reached Clallam Bay in 1789. From 1790 to 1792 the Spanish, based at Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island, made multiple expeditions into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Manuel Quimper reached Port Discovery Bay in 1790. In 1791 Francisco de Eliza led a small exploring fleet, which for a time based itself at Port Discovery. It is not known which ship first made contact with the Klallam, but it was most likely before 1789 and probably at the village at Clallam Bay or Port Discovery, and involved gifts of knives, buttons, and copper. George Vancouver made contact with the Klallam in 1792. He thought he was the first European to visit them and wrote about their indifference, which surprised him. He traded them copper, knives, and minor trade goods.

In 1825 the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) established Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River. There was little traffic between the Klallam and the fort. The only serious incident between the two occurred in 1828 when five white men were killed by a number of Klallam, two of which had been serving as guides and had been mistreated by the white men. In response a party of about 60 men from Fort Vancouver visited Klallam territory and attacked the first group they found, killing seven including women and children, and burning their house. Then, with the help of an HBC ship they attacked, plundered, and destroyed a Klallam village near Dungeness Spit. HBC records say they killed 25 Klallam altogether.

In 1832 the HBC trading post Fort Nisqually was established on the southern shore of Puget Sound, in what is the city of DuPont today. Fort records indicate that Klallam were visiting to trade furs and game by 1833. Between 1833 and 1835 Klallam parties visited Fort Nisqually at least nine times, and more regularly in the following decade. During the same period an HBC trading party visited Klallam territory. This party found the Klallam mostly unwilling to sell furs, saying the HBC&#x27;s prices were too low and that they would instead wait for some other, more competitive trader.

Paul Kane visited Fort Nisqually and the larger region in 1847. His descriptions of the Klallam indicate that they still practiced slavery, had given up bows and arrows for guns, that duck netting was common, shell money was still valued, and shamanism still practiced. One village he visited was fortified and inhabited by about 200 Klallam.

In 1847 about 150 Klallam warriors joined with Suquamish led by Chief Seattle in a major attack on the Chimakum people, intending to wipe them out completely. They largely succeeded, destroying the last Chimakum villages and leaving nearly everyone dead or enslaved. The few surviving Chimakum fled and subsequently joined the Twana, or Skokomish, near the southern end of Hood Canal. After this the Klallam occupied the former Chimakum territory, which was the northeastern part of the Olympic Peninsula, especially on the Quimper Peninsula, where Port Townsend is today, and along northern Hood Canal.

The first white settler of Port Townsend arrived in 1850. That same year the Klallam chief Chetzemoka, known as the Duke of York—many Klallam were given royal names by whites who had difficulty pronouncing Klallam names—was taken by a ship captain on a visit to San Francisco, returning very impressed. In the early 1850s many settlers came to Port Townsend and elsewhere in the region. By 1853 there were sawmills operating at Port Townsend, Port Gamble, and Port Ludlow. A small settlement was established in Klallam territory near Dungeness Spit and present-day Sequim. These early settlers, who lived in conditions little better, or worse than the Klallam, began selling large amounts of liquor to the Klallam, which quickly had deleterious effects.

The ethnologist George Gibbs visited the Klallam in 1855. He reported their population as 926 and blamed alcohol and disease for their population decline. Although his count was probably too low, the Klallam population was significantly reduced from earlier times, mostly due to alcohol and disease. According to Gibbs, the Klallam regularly raided their neighbors but had almost completely stopped using clubs and bows. The Klallam had many tools and utensils of European manufacture. They were growing potatoes in cultivated fields. The fur trade, formerly vital, was almost extinct. Slavery and potlatching were still practiced.

In 1855 the Klallam, along with the Skokomish and the surviving Chimakum, signed the Point No Point Treaty. Under the treaty the Klallam were supposed to give up their land and move to the Skokomish Reservation, near today&#x27;s Skokomish, Washington, in exchange for government aid in the form of rations and instruction. However the Klallam never made this move and remained in their territory along the northern coast of the Olympic Peninsula.

Clallam County was established in 1854, but its population and infrastructure remained minimal for decades. Around 1860 there was smallpox among the Klallam, but it is not known how serious it was. The last act of intertribal warfare involving the Klallam occurred in 1869. A band of over thirty Tsimshian, men, women, and children, were killed on Dungeness Spit by a group of about twenty Klallam men. One Tsimshian woman survived by pretending to be dead. The attack was in retaliation for the abduction of some Klallam women by the Tsimshian a few years earlier. Before the attack the Klallam debated over how the white settlers would react, but after some hesitation the attack was carried out in the traditional manner. One Klallam man was killed, which led to arguments among the Klallam who in the end threw away their trophies and went home dejected. A few were arrested by white settlers and sentenced to hard labor at the Skokomish Reservation, but they were not held for long and the punishment was generally considered to have been mild.

After Gibbs&#x27;s questionable census of 1855, which counted 926 Klallam, somewhat better censuses were conducted in the 1860s and 1870s. It appears that from initial contact to about 1862 the Klallam population declined but not too severely. Between 1862 and 1878 a more rapid decline occurred—from about 1,300 to 597. By 1870 most Klallam lived near Dungeness Spit and what is now Sequim. The period around 1870 marked what appears to be the lowest point in Klallam history. Due to rampant alcoholism, petty bickering and fighting, and thievery, the white residents of Dungeness forced them to relocate to other nearby areas twice, and then threatened to have them moved to the Skokomish Reservation. This led to Chief James Balch, who had been a heavy drinker until his reform in 1873, to lead the Klallam in purchasing their own land and create their own community. He and other leading Klallam collected enough money to purchase a parcel of 250 acres, in 1874, and found a town they named Jamestown, after James Balch. This was very unusual for the time, not least because Native people were legally barred from buying land at the time. By doing this and not moving to the Skokomish Reservation they gave up the possibility of federal assistance of any kind. For many decades Jamestown was one of the few examples of a Native settlement fully owned and managed by the native people themselves, with no governmental assistance or oversight.

In 1981, over a century later, and after six years of effort to gain official recognition as a tribe, the federal government agreed, resulting in the federally recognized Jamestown S&#x27;Klallam Tribe of Washington. Some Klallam never joined the Jamestown project. Today there are several other Klallam groups, such as the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, the Port Gamble Band of S&#x27;Klallam Indians, and, in Canada, the Scia&#x27;new First Nation.

==Culture==

=== Transportation ===
The rugged terrain and dense vegetation of the Olympic Peninsula made the canoe the preferred mode of transportation. The canoes were carved from western red cedar (&quot;Thuja plicata&quot;) through an intricate and arduous process requiring great skill, beginning with the selection of the proper tree. Stone adzes, fire, and heated water were used to hollow and shape the canoe. This knowledge was passed to a select few of each generation, and some of the canoes were purchased from other tribes, especially the larger ones.

There were two main types of canoes used by the Klallam: The smaller Coast Salish type used on protected waters, and the larger Chinook style for use in rougher waters. The smaller type of canoe had a rounded bottom and was long, wide, and deep. This type was used on calm waters for fishing or to haul small loads. The larger canoes had flat bottoms and could be over long, wide, and deep. These were used on the rougher waters of Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and in particular off the Pacific coast, for whaling, transporting larger loads, and carrying up to thirty passengers.

Early white settlers in the area noted the great skill the Klallam used in canoe handling and navigation, and that the Klallam canoes tended to be larger than those used by other Puget Sound tribes.

=== Diet ===

The lands, rivers, marine waters, and beaches in Klallam territory provided an abundant, year-round supply of food. Strategic intertribal marriages and agreements also allowed them permission to hunt or forage outside their homeland. Though their diet included large and small land game, sea fowl, and shellfish, the most important source of food was fish. Salmon still plays a significant nutritional and spiritual role in the Klallam culture.

The Klallam fished year round using a variety of tools and techniques particular to the species, location, and season. They were known to use traps, trolling, gillnets, spears, rakes, dip nets, and holes dug in the beach. Specific locations were known to produce certain fishes at the right time of year, and special implements and skills were employed for a successful catch.

===Ethnobotany===
They apply a poultice of the smashed flowers of &quot;Viola adunca&quot; to the chest or side for pain.

==Schools==
The Klallam tribes do not operate their own schools.

Lower Elwha Klallam children are offered a Klallam cultural and language immersion program at the Lower Elwha Klallam Head Start. Older children are provided with Klallam language and tribal history courses at Dry Creek Elementary School, Stevens Middle School and Port Angeles High School, where most Lower Elwha Klallam children attend school.

A majority of Jamestown S&#x27;Klallam children attend Sequim School District schools.

A majority of Port Gamble S&#x27;Klallam children attend schools in the North Kitsap School District in the Kingston area.

<text>Samuel Augustus Ward (December 28, 1848 – September 28, 1903) was an American organist and composer. Born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of a shoemaker, he studied under several teachers in New York and became an organist at Grace Episcopal Church in his home town in 1880. He married Virginia Ward in 1871, with whom he had four daughters.

He is remembered for the 1882 tune &quot;Materna&quot;, which he intended as a setting for the hymn &quot;O Mother Dear, Jerusalem&quot;. This was published ten years later, in 1892. In 1903, after Ward had died, the tune was first combined by a publisher with the Katharine Lee Bates poem &quot;America&quot;, itself first published in 1895, to create the patriotic song &quot;America the Beautiful.&quot; The first book with the combination was published in 1910. Ward never met Bates.

Ward was founder and first director of the Orpheus Club of Newark, where he died on September 28, 1903. He is buried in Newark‘s Mount Pleasant Cemetery. Ward was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

<text>A spring is a device consisting of an elastic but largely rigid material (typically metal) bent or molded into a form (especially a coil) that can return into shape after being compressed or extended. Springs can store energy when compressed. In everyday use, the term most often refers to coil springs, but there are many different spring designs. Modern springs are typically manufactured from spring steel. An example of a non-metallic spring is the bow, made traditionally of flexible yew wood, which when drawn stores energy to propel an arrow.

When a conventional spring, without stiffness variability features, is compressed or stretched from its resting position, it exerts an opposing force approximately proportional to its change in length (this approximation breaks down for larger deflections). The &quot;rate&quot; or &quot;spring constant&quot; of a spring is the change in the force it exerts, divided by the change in deflection of the spring. That is, it is the gradient of the force versus deflection curve. An extension or compression spring&#x27;s rate is expressed in units of force divided by distance, for example or N/m or lbf/in. A torsion spring is a spring that works by twisting; when it is twisted about its axis by an angle, it produces a torque proportional to the angle. A torsion spring&#x27;s rate is in units of torque divided by angle, such as N·m/rad or ft·lbf/degree. The inverse of spring rate is compliance, that is: if a spring has a rate of 10 N/mm, it has a compliance of 0.1 mm/N. The stiffness (or rate) of springs in parallel is additive, as is the compliance of springs in series.

Springs are made from a variety of elastic materials, the most common being spring steel. Small springs can be wound from pre-hardened stock, while larger ones are made from annealed steel and hardened after manufacture. Some non-ferrous metals are also used, including phosphor bronze and titanium for parts requiring corrosion resistance, and low-resistance beryllium copper for springs carrying electric current.

==History==
Simple non-coiled springs have been used throughout human history, e.g. the bow (and arrow). In the Bronze Age more sophisticated spring devices were used, as shown by the spread of tweezers in many cultures. Ctesibius of Alexandria developed a method for making springs out of an alloy of bronze with an increased proportion of tin, hardened by hammering after it was cast.

Coiled springs appeared early in the 15th century, in door locks. The first spring powered-clocks appeared in that century and evolved into the first large watches by the 16th century.

In 1676 British physicist Robert Hooke postulated Hooke&#x27;s law, which states that the force a spring exerts is proportional to its extension.

On March 8, 1850, John Evans, Founder of John Evans&#x27; Sons, Incorporated, opened his business in New Haven, Connecticut, manufacturing flat springs for carriages and other vehicles, as well as the machinery to manufacture the springs. Evans was a Welsh blacksmith and springmaker who emigrated to the United States in 1847, John Evans&#x27; Sons became &quot;America&#x27;s oldest springmaker&quot; which continues to operate today.

== Types ==



=== Classification ===

Springs can be classified depending on how the load force is applied to them:

; Tension/extension spring: The spring is designed to operate with a tension load, so the spring stretches as the load is applied to it.
; Compression spring: Designed to operate with a compression load, so the spring gets shorter as the load is applied to it.
; Torsion spring: Unlike the above types in which the load is an axial force, the load applied to a torsion spring is a torque or twisting force, and the end of the spring rotates through an angle as the load is applied.
; Constant spring: Supported load remains the same throughout deflection cycle
; Variable spring: Resistance of the coil to load varies during compression
; Variable stiffness spring: Resistance of the coil to load can be dynamically varied for example by the control system, some types of these springs also vary their length thereby providing actuation capability as well 

They can also be classified based on their shape:

; Flat spring: Made of a flat spring steel.
; Machined spring: Manufactured by machining bar stock with a lathe and/or milling operation rather than a coiling operation. Since it is machined, the spring may incorporate features in addition to the elastic element. Machined springs can be made in the typical load cases of compression/extension, torsion, etc.
; Serpentine spring: A zig-zag of thick wire, often used in modern upholstery/furniture.
; Garter spring: A coiled steel spring that is connected at each end to create a circular shape.

=== Common types ===

The most common types of spring are:

; Cantilever spring: A flat spring fixed only at one end like a cantilever, while the free-hanging end takes the load.
; Coil spring: Also known as a helical spring. A spring (made by winding a wire around a cylinder) is of two types:
* &quot;Tension&quot; or &quot;extension springs&quot; are designed to become longer under load. Their turns (loops) are normally touching in the unloaded position, and they have a hook, eye or some other means of attachment at each end.
* &quot;Compression springs&quot; are designed to become shorter when loaded. Their turns (loops) are not touching in the unloaded position, and they need no attachment points.
* &quot;Hollow tubing springs&quot; can be either extension springs or compression springs. Hollow tubing is filled with oil and the means of changing hydrostatic pressure inside the tubing such as a membrane or miniature piston etc. to harden or relax the spring, much like it happens with water pressure inside a garden hose. Alternatively tubing&#x27;s cross-section is chosen of a shape that it changes its area when tubing is subjected to torsional deformation: change of the cross-section area translates into change of tubing&#x27;s inside volume and the flow of oil in/out of the spring that can be controlled by valve thereby controlling stiffness. There are many other designs of springs of hollow tubing which can change stiffness with any desired frequency, change stiffness by a multiple or move like a linear actuator in addition to its spring qualities.
; Arc spring: A pre-curved or arc-shaped helical compression spring, which is able to transmit a torque around an axis.
; Volute spring: A compression coil spring in the form of a cone so that under compression the coils are not forced against each other, thus permitting longer travel.
; Balance spring: Also known as a hairspring. A delicate spiral spring used in watches, galvanometers, and places where electricity must be carried to partially rotating devices such as steering wheels without hindering the rotation.
; Leaf spring: A flat spring used in vehicle suspensions, electrical switches, and bows.
; V-spring: Used in antique firearm mechanisms such as the wheellock, flintlock and percussion cap locks. Also door-lock spring, as used in antique door latch mechanisms.

=== Other types ===

Other types include:

; Belleville washer: A disc shaped spring commonly used to apply tension to a bolt (and also in the initiation mechanism of pressure-activated landmines)
; Constant-force spring: A tightly rolled ribbon that exerts a nearly constant force as it is unrolled
; Gas spring: A volume of compressed gas.
; Ideal spring: An idealised perfect spring with no weight, mass, damping losses, or limits, a concept used in physics. The force an ideal spring would exert is exactly proportional to its extension or compression.
; Mainspring: A spiral ribbon-shaped spring used as a power store of clockwork mechanisms: watches, clocks, music boxes, windup toys, and mechanically powered flashlights
; Negator spring: A thin metal band slightly concave in cross-section. When coiled it adopts a flat cross-section but when unrolled it returns to its former curve, thus producing a constant force throughout the displacement and &quot;negating&quot; any tendency to re-wind. The most common application is the retracting steel tape rule.
; Progressive rate coil springs: A coil spring with a variable rate, usually achieved by having unequal distance between turns so that as the spring is compressed one or more coils rests against its neighbour.
; Rubber band: A tension spring where energy is stored by stretching the material.
; Spring washer: Used to apply a constant tensile force along the axis of a fastener.
; Torsion spring: Any spring designed to be twisted rather than compressed or extended. Used in torsion bar vehicle suspension systems.
; Wave spring: various types of spring made compact by using waves to give a spring effect.
==Physics==
===Hooke&#x27;s law===
An ideal spring acts in accordance with Hooke&#x27;s law, which states that the force with which the spring pushes back is linearly proportional to the distance from its equilibrium length:
:formula_1,
where
: formula_2 is the displacement vector – the distance from its equilibrium length.
: formula_3 is the resulting force vector – the magnitude and direction of the restoring force the spring exerts
: formula_4 is the rate, spring constant or force constant of the spring, a constant that depends on the spring&#x27;s material and construction. The negative sign indicates that the force the spring exerts is in the opposite direction from its displacement
Most real springs approximately follow Hooke&#x27;s law if not stretched or compressed beyond their elastic limit.

Coil springs and other common springs typically obey Hooke&#x27;s law. There are useful springs that don&#x27;t: springs based on beam bending can for example produce forces that vary nonlinearly with displacement.

If made with constant pitch (wire thickness), conical springs have a variable rate. However, a conical spring can be made to have a constant rate by creating the spring with a variable pitch. A larger pitch in the larger-diameter coils and a smaller pitch in the smaller-diameter coils forces the spring to collapse or extend all the coils at the same rate when deformed.

===Simple harmonic motion===

Since force is equal to mass, &quot;m&quot;, times acceleration, &quot;a&quot;, the force equation for a spring obeying Hooke&#x27;s law looks like:
:formula_5

The mass of the spring is small in comparison to the mass of the attached mass and is ignored. Since acceleration is simply the second derivative of x with respect to time,
:formula_6
This is a second order linear differential equation for the displacement formula_2 as a function of time. Rearranging:
:formula_8
the solution of which is the sum of a sine and cosine:
:formula_9
formula_10 and formula_11 are arbitrary constants that may be found by considering the initial displacement and velocity of the mass. The graph of this function with formula_12 (zero initial position with some positive initial velocity) is displayed in the image on the right.

=== Energy dynamics ===
In simple harmonic motion of a spring-mass system, energy will fluctuate between kinetic energy and potential energy, but the total energy of the system remains the same. A spring that obeys Hooke&#x27;s Law with spring constant &quot;k&quot; will have a total system energy &quot;E&quot; of:

formula_13

Here, A is the amplitude of the wave-like motion that is produced by the oscillating behavior of the spring.

The potential energy &quot;U&quot; of such a system can be determined through the spring constant &quot;k&quot; and its displacement &quot;x&quot;:

formula_14

The kinetic energy &quot;K&quot; of an object in simple harmonic motion can be found using the mass of the attached object &quot;m&quot; and the velocity at which the object oscillates &quot;v&quot;:

formula_15

Since there is no energy loss in such a system, energy is always conserved and thus:

formula_16

=== Frequency &amp; period ===
The angular frequency ω of an object in simple harmonic motion, given in radians per second, is found using the spring constant &quot;k&quot; and the mass of the oscillating object &quot;m&quot;&quot;:&quot;

formula_17

The period &quot;T&quot;, the amount of time for the spring-mass system to complete one full cycle, of such harmonic motion is given by:

formula_18

The frequency &quot;f&quot;, the number of oscillations per unit time, of something in simple harmonic motion is found by taking the inverse of the period:

formula_19

==Theory==
In classical physics, a spring can be seen as a device that stores potential energy, specifically elastic potential energy, by straining the bonds between the atoms of an elastic material.

Hooke&#x27;s law of elasticity states that the extension of an elastic rod (its distended length minus its relaxed length) is linearly proportional to its tension, the force used to stretch it. Similarly, the contraction (negative extension) is proportional to the compression (negative tension).

This law actually holds only approximately, and only when the deformation (extension or contraction) is small compared to the rod&#x27;s overall length. For deformations beyond the elastic limit, atomic bonds get broken or rearranged, and a spring may snap, buckle, or permanently deform. Many materials have no clearly defined elastic limit, and Hooke&#x27;s law can not be meaningfully applied to these materials. Moreover, for the superelastic materials, the linear relationship between force and displacement is appropriate only in the low-strain region.

Hooke&#x27;s law is a mathematical consequence of the fact that the potential energy of the rod is a minimum when it has its relaxed length. Any smooth function of one variable approximates a quadratic function when examined near enough to its minimum point as can be seen by examining the Taylor series. Therefore, the force – which is the derivative of energy with respect to displacement – approximates a linear function.

Force of fully compressed spring

:formula_20

where

: E – Young&#x27;s modulus
: d – spring wire diameter
: L – free length of spring
: n – number of active windings
: formula_21 – Poisson ratio
: D – spring outer diameter

==Zero-length springs==
Zero-length spring is a term for a specially designed coil spring that would exert zero force if it had zero length. That is, in a line graph of the spring&#x27;s force versus its length, the line passes through the origin. A real coil spring will not contract to zero length because at some point the coils touch each other. &quot;Length&quot; here is defined as the distance between the axes of the pivots at each end of the spring, regardless of any inelastic portion in-between.

Zero-length springs are made by manufacturing a coil spring with built-in tension (A twist is introduced into the wire as it is coiled during manufacture; this works because a coiled spring &quot;unwinds&quot; as it stretches), so if it &quot;could&quot; contract further, the equilibrium point of the spring, the point at which its restoring force is zero, occurs at a length of zero. In practice, the manufacture of springs is typically not accurate enough to produce springs with tension consistent enough for applications that use zero length springs, so they are made by combining a &quot;negative length&quot; spring, made with even more tension so its equilibrium point would be at a &quot;negative&quot; length, with a piece of inelastic material of the proper length so the zero force point would occur at zero length.

A zero-length spring can be attached to a mass on a hinged boom in such a way that the force on the mass is almost exactly balanced by the vertical component of the force from the spring, whatever the position of the boom. This creates a horizontal pendulum with very long oscillation period. Long-period pendulums enable seismometers to sense the slowest waves from earthquakes. The LaCoste suspension with zero-length springs is also used in gravimeters because it is very sensitive to changes in gravity. Springs for closing doors are often made to have roughly zero length, so that they exert force even when the door is almost closed, so they can hold it closed firmly.

<text>The Jamestown S&#x27;Klallam Tribe is a federally recognized tribe of S&#x27;Klallam or Klallam Native Americans. They are on the northern Olympic Peninsula of Washington state in the northwestern United States.

==History==
The Jamestown S&#x27;Klallam Tribe was formalized by members of S&#x27;Klallam communities along the eastern end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca in 1874 when, faced with the threat of forced relocation by European colonizers, a group purchased a tract of and established a community near Dungeness named &quot;Jamestown&quot; in honor of village leader James Balch. This was a notable feat, since at the time Native people were legally barred from buying property. Despite periodic pressures to relocate to reservations, and without the Federal financial assistance that such relocation would have enabled, the Jamestown band maintained its independent community, and developed a viable economic base.

A century later, after a six-year effort to receive official recognition as a tribe, the United States Department of the Interior granted them such recognition on February 10, 1981.

==Reservation==

The Jamestown S&#x27;Klallam Indian Reservation is very small in area, comprising 0.145 km (13.49 acres) of land area on and near Sequim Bay along U.S. Route 101 in the community of Blyn, in extreme eastern Clallam County at the southwest corner of the Miller Peninsula. The reservation is the location of the tribal government administration, not a residential area. It includes the Jamestown S&#x27;Klallam Tribal Center (location of the tribe&#x27;s administration, natural resources, social and community services departments as well as the Tribal Library and Jamestown Family Dental Clinic), the Tribe&#x27;s Seven Cedars Casino, Longhouse Market Deli and Fueling Station, Cannabis and natural remedies shop, and newly built resort hotel.

In addition to the small parcel of reservation land, the Tribe also owns more than 1,000 acres of land in Clallam and Jefferson Counties. That land includes Railroad Bridge Park and The Cedars at Dungeness Golf Course in Sequim, and Tamanowas Rock, a sacred S&#x27;Klallam site in Chimacum.

==Language==
The S&#x27;Klallam language (called Clallam or Klallam) belongs to the Salishan family of Native American languages. The word S&#x27;Klallam means &quot;the strong people.&quot;

==Tribal government==
The community is governed by a democratically elected tribal council. , the tribe had 594 enrolled citizens, and provided services to almost 640 Indians in the northeast Olympic Peninsula.

===Mission statement===
The tribal mission statement reads:
&quot;The Jamestown S&#x27;Klallam Tribe seeks to be self-sufficient and to provide quality governmental programs and services to address the unique social, cultural, natural resource and economic needs of our people. These programs and services must be managed while preserving, restoring and sustaining our Indian heritage and community continuity.&quot;

===Tribal council===
The Tribe is governed by the five-member Jamestown S&#x27;Klallam Tribal Council. Council members are elected on a staggered basis by the registered adult tribal members for two-year terms. The council acts in accordance with the Jamestown S&#x27;Klallam Tribal Constitution and is led by the Tribal Chairman.

== Native American Advocacy ==
On April 4, 2014, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, part of the United States Department of the Interior, approved the Jamestown S&#x27;Klallam Tribe leasing regulations under the HEARTH Act after testimony from the Tribal Chairman, W. Ron Allen. With this approval, the Tribe is authorized to enter into the following type of leases without BIA approval: Business leases. This has allowed the tribe to expand their business ventures for the welfare of the members with the prosperity and benefits of a casino, golf course, medical and dental facilities, and other small enterprises.

The Jamestown S&#x27;Klallam Tribe is also heavily involved in protecting and preserving their ancestral lands. Their natural resources department works to reach all parts of the diverse Pacific Northwestern ecosystem, but is mainly focused on the Dungeness River watershed. Headed primarily by their Dungeness River Management Team, the tribe has been involved in the completion of over 40 watershed planning documents, studies, and recovery plans since 1989.

In 1924, he took courses on teaching in rural areas in the town of Aguadilla. The courses were taught by Carmen Gómez Tejera. After this, he taught from 1925 to 1988, both at the elementary school and university levels.

Laguerre was known to use the pen-names of Tristán Ronda, Luis Urayoán, Motial and Alberto Prado, among others. Married for many years to the well-respected writer Luz V. Romero García, he also worked in many Puerto Rican publications before joining the staff of &quot;El Vocero&quot;.

In 1998, his peers as well as former governors Rafael Hernández Colón and Luis A. Ferré, advocated for Laguerre to be considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Despite their efforts, Laguerre was not awarded the prestigious award.

Laguerre was an emeritus member of the Center for Advanced Studies on Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.

Enrique Laguerre died on June 16, 2005, at the age of 99. His body was buried on the grounds of the Palacete Los Moreau, an old hacienda restored as a museum, in his native town of Moca.

==Writings==
Laguerre was one of the most prolific novelists of Puerto Rico and was nominated for a Nobel Prize in Literature. Following in the steps of Manuel Zeno Gandía, Laguerre&#x27;s most influential work focused on the problems of the colonized society. His novel &quot;La Llamarada&quot; offers a comprehensive view of rural Puerto Rico during the Great Depression. Most of his novels are essential readings in Puerto Rican literature courses.

<text>is simmered, smoked and fermented skipjack tuna (&quot;Katsuwonus pelamis&quot;, sometimes referred to as bonito). It is also known as bonito flakes or broadly as .

Shaved &quot;katsuobushi&quot; and dried kelp—&quot;kombu&quot;—are the main ingredients of &quot;dashi&quot;, a broth that forms the basis of many soups (such as miso) and sauces (such as &quot;soba no tsukejiru&quot;) in Japanese cuisine.

&quot;Katsuobushi&quot;″s distinct umami taste comes from its high inosinic acid content. Traditionally made &quot;katsuobushi&quot;, known as &quot;karebushi&quot;, is deliberately fermented with &quot;Aspergillus glaucus&quot; fungus in order to reduce moisture. &quot;Katsuobushi&quot; has also been shown to impart &quot;kokumi&quot; (a term translated as &quot;heartiness&quot;).

==Traditional production process==

The fish is beheaded, gutted, and filleted, with the fatty belly, which does not lend well to being preserved, trimmed off. The fillets are then arranged in a basket and simmered just below boiling for an hour to an hour and a half, depending on their size.

The rib bones are then removed and the fillets smoked for up to a month using oak, pasania, or castanopsis wood. They are smoked for five to six hours in one session, left to rest one day for the condensation to rise to the surface, then fired and smoked again the next day. This smoking and resting cycle is repeated 12–15 times in total. At this point, the fish is dry and hard, and the built-up tar from the smoke and excess fat is cleaned from the surface using a grinder. At this stage the fillets are called and most commonly found in stores shaved and packaged for sale under the name or &quot;hanakatsuo&quot;. They are not true &quot;katsuobushi&quot; without the last fermentation stage, but still valued as a good substitute.

The last stage of creating &quot;katsuobushi&quot; is to allow the fish to sun-dry using the assistance of mold. The fillets are sprayed with &quot;Aspergillus glaucus&quot; culture and left for two weeks in a closed cultivation room. The mold ferments the fillets and also draws out any residual moisture.

The mold is continually scraped off, with further sun-drying increasing hardness and dryness until the fillet resembles a piece of wood, with less than 20% of its original weight. By definition, only fillets that have been treated in this manner may be referred to as &quot;katsuobushi&quot;. After repeating this process of mold growth and sun-drying at least twice, the &quot;katsuobushi&quot; can also be called , and fillets repeating this process more than three times can be called . When tapped together lightly, they sound almost metallic, and unlike their dull beige outer appearance, when broken open they are a translucent deep ruby color inside. Rarely, very high-end &quot;honkarebushi&quot; repeat this drying process for over two years.

In the Edo era, it was common for &quot;katsuobushi&quot; to go through an extra step, the so-called process. After the fillets are boiled and their rib bones removed the fish are put in steaming baskets stacked atop one another for one to two hours a few meters above a burning wood fire. These are rotated to assure an equal exposure to the smoke. The result is more flavorful and resistant to deterioration. Due to the extra cost and facilities required only a few factories following &quot;tebiyama-shiki&quot; remain.

== Shaving ==

Traditionally, chunks of &quot;katsuobushi&quot; were shaved as needed with an instrument similar to a wood plane called a &quot;katsuobushi kezuriki&quot;.

Today &quot;katsuobushi&quot; is typically sold in bags of small pink-brown shavings, which vary by thickness: smaller, thinner shavings, called &quot;hanakatsuo&quot; (), are used as a flavoring and topping for many Japanese dishes, such as okonomiyaki, while the larger thicker, called &quot;kezurikatsuo&quot; (), are favored for making the widely used dashi stock.

==Uses==
In addition to making dashi, other popular uses of &quot;katsuobushi&quot; include:
* Okaka, finely chopped &quot;katsuobushi&quot; dressed with soy sauce.
** As a stuffing for rice balls (&quot;onigiri&quot;).
** As a topping for rice. Popular for bentō, often covered with strips of laver.
** Dried okaka is used as an ingredient of &quot;furikake&quot; rice topping (called &quot;okaka furikake&quot;).
* As a seasoning for cold tofu (&quot;hiyayakko&quot;, ) along with grated ginger and Welsh onion (a type of spring onion).
* Sprinkled with sesame seeds and chopped laver atop cold soba noodles (zarusoba).
* As a topping on takoyaki, okonomiyaki or agedashi dōfu.
* As a seasoning on century egg along with sesame oil and soy sauce.
* As a high-protein treat for cats sold at pet stores.
* As a topping for ramen mixed with salt.

== Health ==
The mycotoxin beta-nitropropionic acid has been found on &quot;katsuobushi&quot; as well as in miso and in soy sauce, two other Japanese fungal fermented products. Certain strains of &quot;A. glaucus&quot; are reported to produce mycotoxins.

Due to the smoking process which involves tar and charcoal, amounts of benzopyrene exceeding EU standards, as much as 37μg per kilogram, have been detected in commercially sold &quot;katsuobushi&quot;. As a result, they have been banned for sale in the European Union.

<doc id="316624" wikidata="Q7460152" url="?curid=316624" title="Shachtmanism">
<text>Shachtmanism is the form of Marxism associated with Max Shachtman (1904–1972). It has two major components: a bureaucratic collectivist analysis of the Soviet Union and a third camp approach to world politics. Shachtmanites believe that the Stalinist rulers of proclaimed socialist countries are a new ruling class distinct from the workers and reject Trotsky&#x27;s description of Stalinist Russia as a &quot;degenerated workers&#x27; state&quot;.

== Origin ==
Shachtmanism originated as a tendency within the US Socialist Workers Party in 1939, as Shachtman&#x27;s supporters left that group to form the Workers Party in 1940. The tensions that led to the split extended as far back as 1931. However, the theory of &quot;bureaucratic collectivism,&quot; the idea that the USSR was ruled by a new bureaucratic class and was not capitalist, did not originate with Shachtman, but seems to have originated within the Trotskyist movement with Yvan Craipeau, a member of the French Section of the Fourth International, and Bruno Rizzi.

Although the Shachtman group&#x27;s resignation from the SWP was not only over the defence of the Soviet Union, rather than the class nature of the state itself, that was a major point in the internal polemics of the time.

== Currents influenced by Shachtman ==
Regardless of its origins in the American SWP, Shachtmanism&#x27;s core belief is opposition to the American SWP&#x27;s defence of the Soviet Union. This originated not with Shachtman but Joseph Carter (1910–1970) and James Burnham (1905–1987), who proposed this at the founding of the SWP in 1938. C. L. R. James (1901–1989) referred to the implied theory, from which he dissented, as Carter&#x27;s little liver pill. The theory was never fully developed by anybody in the Workers Party and Shachtman&#x27;s book, published many years later in 1961, consists earlier articles from the pages of &quot;New International&quot; with some political conclusions reversed. Ted Grant (1913–2006) has alleged that some Trotskyist thinkers, including Tony Cliff (1917–2000), who have described such societies as &quot;state capitalist&quot; share an implicit theoretical agreement with some elements of Shachtmanism. Cliff, who published a critique of Shachtmanism in the late 1940s, would have rejected this allegation.

=== Left Shachtmanism ===
Left Shachtmanism, influenced by Max Shachtman&#x27;s work of the 1940s, sees Stalinist nations as being potentially imperialist and does not offer any support to their leadership. This has been crudely described as seeing the Stalinist and capitalist countries as being equally bad, although it would be more accurate to say that neither is seen as occupying a more progressive stage in the global class struggle.

A more current term for Left Shachtmanism is Third Camp Trotskyism, the Third Camp being differentiated from capitalism and Stalinism. Prominent Third Camp groupings include the Workers&#x27; Liberty grouping in Australia and the United Kingdom and by the International Socialist predecessor of Solidarity.

The foremost left Shachtmanite was Hal Draper (1914–1990), an independent scholar who worked as a librarian at the University of California, Berkeley, where he organized the Independent Socialist Club and became influential with left-wing students during the Free Speech Movement. Julius Jacobson (1922–2003) and the New Politics journal continued to develop and apply this political tradition.

=== Social democratic Shachtmanism ===
Social democratic Shachtmanism, later developed by Shachtman and associated with some members of the Social Democrats, USA, holds Soviet Communist states to be so repressive that communism must be contained and, when possible, defeated by the collective action of the working class. Consequently, adherents support free labor unions and democracy movements around the world. Domestically, they organized in the civil rights movement and in the labor movement. Social democrats influenced by Shachtman rejected calls for an immediate cease-fire and the immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam, but rather opposed bombings in Vietnam and supported a negotiated peace that would allow labor unions and government-opposition to survive. Such social democrats helped provide funding and supplies to Solidarity, the Polish labor union, as requested by the Polish workers.

=== Libertarian Shachtmanism ===

Libertarian socialist tendencies developed within early Shachtmanism, leading to certain individuals and groups moving towards anarchism and libertarian Marxism. Dwight Macdonald left the Workers Party shortly after it was first established, founding the &quot;Politics&quot; magazine and becoming an anarcho-pacifist during World War II. While still within the Workers Party, the Johnson–Forest Tendency developed a form of libertarian Marxism that characterized the Soviet Union as state capitalist, while also developing a black liberationist program. The trade union activist Stan Weir was in turn inspired by the Johnsonites to reject vanguardism and traditional trade unionism, in favor of a bottom-up syndicalist model. While Murray Bookchin himself had stayed with the Cannonite Socialist Workers Party, he briefly joined a group that worked together with the Shachtmanite Workers Party, later developing towards a green anarchist philosophy - which he labelled &quot;social ecology&quot;.

In the wake of World War II, the Independent Socialist League began to forge alliances with other &quot;third camp&quot; groups, holding joint conferences with such organizations as the Industrial Workers of the World, the Libertarian League and the War Resisters League. An anarchist newspaper noted that the ISL&#x27;s political thought had developed greatly since its break with orthodox Trotskyism in 1939, stating that &quot;in some respects these comrades are evolving in a generally libertarian direction.&quot; However, as Shachtman himself moved towards social democratic tendencies, the further left segments led by Hal Draper split to form the International Socialists, attracting many libertarian socialists through Draper&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Two Souls of Socialism&quot; - which advocated for a popular and democratic &quot;socialism from below&quot;. However, due to the International Socialists&#x27; preoccupation with electoralism, revolutionary socialists split from the organization to form the Revolutionary Socialist League, which included a sizeable number of libertarian socialists. Libertarians of the RSL, led by Christopher Z. Hobson and Ron Tabor, eventually broke entirely from Trotskyism, Leninism and Marxism, becoming anarchists and forming the founding nucleus of the Love &amp; Rage Anarchist Federation. Tabor later identified Left Shachtmanism as having provided a bridge between Trotskyism and anarchism, through the concepts of the &quot;Third Camp&quot;, &quot;socialism from below&quot; and the &quot;united front&quot;. He also criticized the International Socialists for its social democratic, centrist and reformist tendencies. Draper, in turn, has criticized anarchism as &quot;fundamentally antidemocratic in ideology&quot;, labeling it as an elitist and authoritarian ideology.

The International Socialist Organization also established itself around Draper&#x27;s conception of &quot;socialism from below&quot;, and like the Revolutionary Socialist League before it, a number of anarchists have since left the organization after developing towards more libertarian philosophies.

<text>The Nooksack (; Nooksack: &quot;Noxwsʼáʔaq&quot;) are a federally recognized Native American tribe near the Pacific Northwest Coast. They are a sovereign nation, located in the mainland northwest corner of Washington state in the United States along the Nooksack River near the small town of Deming (in western Whatcom County), and 12 miles south of the Canadian border. As of 2008, they had more than 1,800 enrolled members. Their terms for citizenship include descent from persons listed in a 1942 tribal census.

They are part of the Coast Salish people and have traditionally spoken Nooksack, one of the Salishan family of languages. It is closely related to the Halkomelem language of coastal British Columbia, and at one time was considered a dialect of the latter. At the time of European encounter, the Nooksack people occupied territory extending into present-day British Columbia. But the setting of the border between Canada and the United States split the people into two territories. Halkomelem was still dominant in the Nooksack watershed in the US.

==History==
Like most Northwest Coast indigenous peoples, the Nooksack long occupied a watershed area where they relied on fishing, hunting, and clamming, as well as gathering root vegetables and berries, and processing these for sustenance. Their territory extended from the mountains to the coast of present-day northwest Washington state in the watershed of the Nooksack River, and into British Columbia, Canada. They set up seasonal camps for hunting or fishing, such as timing when they could harvest salmon runs. European exploration and colonization of the Pacific Northwest resulted in social disruption, high death rates from infectious disease, and their losing access to much of their historic territory. The surviving Nooksack continued to live near the river by which they are known.

In 1934 Congress and President Franklin D. Roosevelt passed the Wheeler-Howard Act, also known as the Indian Reorganization Act. It was intended to help improve the condition of indigenous peoples by enabling them to revive and restore Indian self-government, which had been largely reduced, especially on Indian reservations. Because the Nooksack had not been granted reservation land by the U.S. government in the 19th century, they were not recognized as a tribe at the time by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

In the 1930s the Nooksack tribe voted to accept the Wheeler-Howard Act and began working on a tribal constitution to establish an elected government under its model. They took a census in 1942 of persons considered members of the tribal community. Their constitution also provided for other forms of documentation and identity recognition. During the later decades of the 20th century, the people worked to organize their community and gain federal recognition as a tribe. In this period many Nooksack and other Coastal Salish worked and lived away from Whatcom County, further south in the Puget Sound area where there were more jobs.

The Nooksack acquired a one-acre (4,000m2) parcel of land in 1970, as their reservation, and gained full federal recognition in 1973. That land was taken into trust by the US Department of Interior, as has been much of the other lands they have acquired. Their land base has subsequently increased to 3,133.61 acres, which includes fee land, trust land, and individual trust land. Trust land is land held by the federal government in trust for a native tribe or nation. It is the area where the tribe exercises its sovereign authority.

Federal court decisions in the 1970s, including what is known as the Boldt decision, have affirmed Native American rights in Washington state to fish and gather food in their traditional ways from their historic territories.

==Government==
The tribe created a constitution conforming to the model of elected government as proposed under the Indian Reorganization Act. Under its constitution, tribal members elect representatives to an 8-person council. Half the positions are elected in alternating years. The tribal chairman is elected as one of the eight, as are the vice-chairman, treasurer, and secretary. All terms are for two years. The tribal council approves policy and passes laws affecting members.

The tribe also has a judicial branch, a tribal court.

===Membership===
The tribe set its rules for membership as: &quot;recipients of early land allotments, recipients of a 1965 government settlement, or people who appeared on a 1942 tribal census&quot;, and their direct descendants. Section H of the Nooksack constitution also allowed the enrollment of “persons who possess at least ¼ Indian blood and who can prove Nooksack ancestry to any degree.”

In 2014 Chairman Bob Kelly initiated a referendum removing Section H from the constitution; it passed with 61% of the vote.

===Disenrollment controversy===
Like other federally recognized tribes, the Nooksack set their own membership qualifications. 
Since 2012 the tribe has been embroiled in a bitter political controversy, in part related to determining membership. That year the tribe refused enrollment of several young children of Terry St. Germain, although they had enrolled his two oldest children. Claiming descent from Annie George, he had become an enrolled member as a teenager. His brother Rudy St. Germain was also enrolled and in 2012 was serving on the tribal council, as was their cousin Michelle Roberts, another George descendant. The enrollment office said the family had insufficient documentation of Nooksack descent.

Following rejection of St. Germain&#x27;s application for his children, under the leadership of Chairman Bob Kelly, the tribe conducted a review of membership and descent across several families. Kelly personally reviewed the confusing records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Everett, concluding the Annie George descendants were insufficiently documented. In 2013, the tribal council sent out a notice of disenrollment to 306 living descendants of ancestor Annie George (born 1875) and her three daughters. Thirty-seven were elders.

Annie George&#x27;s name did not appear in a 1942 tribal census, which has been the basis required for documenting descent for tribal membership, nor was there a record that she was granted land. But her brother Louis George was listed on the 1942 tribal census. Her daughters: Elizabeth (Libby), Emma and Louisa) married Filipino migrant workers, and lived and worked in other areas of the southern Puget Sound for years. Their descendants were accepted for enrollment as Nooksack members in the early 1980s under Section H of the constitution, about a decade after the tribe was federally recognized.

Annie George is known as a daughter of Matsqui George, known leader of a Nooksack village in what is now British Columbia. The ancestral tribal members were considered one people until Canada and the United States established boundaries across former common land. Annie&#x27;s mother died soon after her birth and her father remarried. He and his family later moved to Washington state. In the 1910 federal census Annie&#x27;s half-brother Louis George was recorded as living with his mother (the second wife) and his and Annie&#x27;s father Matsqui George in Washington state, and all are identified as Nooksack.

Over time descendants of the three daughters&#x27; families, known as the Rabang, Rapada, and Narte-Gladstone, gained political power in the tribe. By the 21st century, some were elected to office. Some other tribal members resented their power, as well as worrying because some members of these families were prosecuted for drug trade. In the 21st century, the now 306 living descendants comprise about 15 percent of the tribe.

According to Kelly (and current chair Ross Cline Sr.), Annie George&#x27;s descendants had been mistakenly enrolled in the 1980s under Section H of the constitution. Kelly believed he had to correct the situation. In February 2013, the tribal council sent notices to the 306 individuals, informing them that their citizenship would be revoked within 30 days. This would result in their losing status as members, losing their community and formal identity as Nooksack, and affecting access to federal education and health benefits.

Opponents protested the disenrollment, saying that it was an effort by Kelly to gain more power before a competitive tribal election. People opposed to the disenrollment marched in protest in March 2013 in Seattle, the largest city in the state. The families hired Gabriel S. Galanda (Round Valley Indian Tribes) to represent them. Born and raised in Port Angeles, Washington, he became an attorney and set up his own practice in Seattle, specializing in Native American issues. He consulted with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) on behalf of The 306.

Opponents of Kelly&#x27;s position have said the disenrollment decision was political, and that Kelly was trying to get rid of critics before the next council election. Votes were very close among candidates in the primary election in the spring of 2014.

In March 2014, the disenrollment case was pending in tribal court, which, a KUOW reporter noted, usually decided in alliance with the majority on the tribal council. This would have been the largest mass disenrollment by any tribe within Washington state.

Kelly allegedly fired tribal employees who supported or were members of the Nooksack 306. In addition, &quot;the tribal council allegedly fired a judge who was about to rule against them, disbarred the attorney representing the 306, and by most accounts refused to hold new tribal elections until after the 306 are officially disenrolled.&quot;

After a close primary, four tribal council positions were up for election in March 2014. The council refused to call elections until action was finished on disenrollment of the Nooksack 306. As the delay continued into 2016, Tribal Elder George Adams, the tribe&#x27;s election superintendent, believed the council had gone too far. He &quot;invoked the right of General Council, an ancient tradition meaning the voice of the people. According to tradition, the tribe gives authority to its leaders, but in extreme cases of misuse this authority can be revoked by the tribe, which acts together as a single unit, the General Council.&quot;

In March 2016, Tribal Judge Susan Alexander ruled that the tribe could not disbar Galanda from representing the 306 clients in tribal court. Alexander was later removed from her post. In March 2016 an appeals court ruled that the 306 members could still vote in tribal elections.

Because the tribal council refused to schedule an election, Tribal Elder George Adams on July 14, 2016, called a General Council meeting in order to conduct a &#x27;special election&#x27; of the four open council seats. More than 200 attendees met off the reservation to ensure they did not have tribal interference. They elected four interim council members and also invalidated the recall of Carmen Tageant from the Tribal Council, returning her to office.

Elected as vice chairman was Bob Doucette, who had served on the council in the 1970s; Bernadine Roberts, also a former council member, was elected treasurer. Jeremiah Johnny and Ron Roberts were elected to the two council positions, and Tageant was returned to her seat. A majority of the council now opposed disenrollment of the 306. These were interim positions, and the tribal council said they wanted the federal government to supervise an election for the four open positions.

Chairman Bob Kelly said he would not recognize this General Council election as valid. His supporters on the council include Secretary Nadene Rapada and member Bob Solomon. A new &#x27;supreme court&#x27; was created by the tribal council with Kelly as chief justice, an action that was invalidated by the federal government in 2019 as it went against the Nooksack constitution.

The tribe lost federal funding in 2017 because the Bureau of Indian Affairs said it had acted improperly by trying to disenroll the 306 and postponing an important election related to this controversy.

After a supervised general election was held in December 2017, the federal government reinstated tribal funding in March 2018. The elections resulted in further legal challenges after allegations of fraud and irregularities surfaced, as Kelly supporters were returned to office.

In 2018 the newly elected tribal council, with a majority of Kelly supporters, voted to proceed with disenrolling the George descendants. Several families continued to live on tribal land in tribal housing.

In 2019 the council passed a new rule requiring a ground sublease with the tribe for underlying Tribal Trust Land. Eligibility for such subleases were limited to enrolled tribal members. The council said that growth in the tribe meant these houses were needed for Nooksack members. They notified 61 former members (of the 306 disenrolled) that they would have to leave this housing.

Twenty-one homes had been federally funded under a program with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Many George descendants had occupied such housing for more than a decade, and some had nearly completed a lease-to-own program, making payments to the tribe. Galanda, who continues to dispute the legality of the disenrollment of the 306, has suggested that the tribe violated due process in proposing eviction. The tribe had to comply with federal civil rights law for units built with federal funding. The case has gained renewed federal attention from both the Department of Interior and HUD. They initiated an investigation in fall 2021 related to civil rights issues and accounting for payments from tenants to the tribe for this housing.

Despite appeals, in December 2021 the tribe was set to evict 61 former members, and two of their children who were enrolled members. Ross Cline Sr., serves as the current tribal chairman.

In December 2021, the Nooksack 306 through Galanda appealed to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, &quot;seeking to have that organization intervene, review the situation and ask the Biden administration to immediately take steps to halt the evictions.&quot; UN rapporteurs, or monitors, traveled to Whatcom County to review the issues and also consulted with related US agencies.

&quot;Balakrishnan Rajagopal is the special rapporteur on adequate housing, and Francisco Cali Tzay is the special rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous peoples.&quot; In early February 2022 they called on the US government to prevent eviction of the families. Galanda said this was the first case he knew of in which UN monitors reviewed a dispute within an indigenous tribe.

==Demographics==
As of the 2000 census, the Nooksack Indian Reservation, at in Whatcom County, had a resident population of 547 persons living on ) of land. Of these residents, 373 persons, or 68.2 percent, identified as being solely of Native American ancestry.

==Language==

The Nooksack language (&quot;Lhéchalosem&quot;) belongs to the Salishan family of Native American languages, and is most similar to the Halkomelem language of British Columbia, of which it was once considered a dialect. Until the mid-20th century, Halkomelem had become the dominant indigenous language of the Nooksack in the United States. This demonstrated how closely the people were related on each side of the border. As of 2016, the last fluent speaker of Nooksack and its dialects was George Adams, a 70-year-old elder of the tribe.

In the late 20th century, observers thought the language had become extinct around 1988. In the 1970s American linguist Brent Galloway had worked closely with another fluent native speaker. He was trying to create a dictionary of the Nooksack language but it is unclear if that work was published before his death. Galloway&#x27;s book &quot;Dictionary of Upriver Halkomelem&quot; (2009) covers a language that was in the same region but distinct from that earlier spoken by the Nooksack people.

After this Cheryl Gomez moved the family to Little Rock, Arkansas, then to Philadelphia. In Philadelphia, Gomez-Preston was enrolled in acting, dancing, and singing lessons at Philadelphia&#x27;s Freedom Theatre. Her parents eventually divorced. In 1994, she moved from Philadelphia to Los Angeles with her mother and brother Kyle, so she could pursue an acting career.

<doc id="316640" wikidata="Q554175" url="?curid=316640" title="Feroze Gandhi">
<text>Feroze Jehangir Gandhi (12 September 1912 – 8 September 1960) was an Indian freedom fighter, politician and journalist. He served as a member of the provincial parliament between 1950 and 1952, and later a member of the Lok Sabha, the Lower house of Indian parliament. He published &quot;The National Herald&quot; and &quot;The Navjivan newspapers&quot;. His wife, Indira Gandhi (daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India), and their elder son Rajiv Gandhi were both prime ministers of India. He was a member of Indian National Congress.

==Early life and education==
Feroze Gandhi was born on 12 September 1912 to a Parsi family at the Tehmulji Nariman Hospital in the Fort district of Bombay; his parents, Jehangir Faredoon Gandhi and Ratimai (née Commissariat), lived in Nauroji Natakwala Bhawan in Khetwadi Mohalla in Bombay. His father Jehangir was a marine engineer working for Killick Nixon and was later promoted as a warrant engineer. 

Feroze was the youngest of the five children with two brothers Dorab and Faridun Jehangir, and two sisters, Tehmina Kershasp and Aloo Dastur. The family had migrated to Bombay from Bharuch (now in South Gujarat) where their ancestral home, which belonged to his grandfather, still exists in Kotpariwad. 
In the early 1920s, after the death of his father, Feroze and his mother moved to Allahabad to live with his unmarried maternal aunt, Shirin Commissariat, a surgeon at the city&#x27;s Lady Dufferin Hospital. 

Feroze attended the Vidya Mandir High School, and then the British-staffed Ewing Christian College, Prayagraj. Later, in 1935, he went to London to complete his education at the London School of Economics and obtained a B.Sc. degree. 

Feroze Jehangir Gandhi, originally named Feroze Jehangir Ghandy, left his studies at a British-run college to join the freedom movement. Then he became closely involved with the Nehru family, spending significant time at Anand Bhawan, their residence and a key hub for political activity. During this period, he adopted the surname Gandhi as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, altering it from its original form, Ghandy.

==Family and career==
In 1930, the wing of Congress Freedom fighters, the &quot;Vanar Sena&quot; was formed. Feroze met Kamala Nehru and Indira among the women demonstrators picketing outside Ewing Christian College. Kamala fainted from the sun&#x27;s heat and Feroze went to look after her. The next day, he abandoned his studies to join the Indian independence movement.

He was imprisoned in 1930, along with Lal Bahadur Shastri (the 2nd Prime Minister of India), head of Allahabad District Congress Committee, and lodged in Faizabad Jail for nineteen months over his participation in the independence movement. Soon after his release, he was involved with the agrarian no-rent campaign in the United Province (now Uttar Pradesh) and was imprisoned twice, in 1932 and 1933, while working closely with Nehru.

Feroze first proposed to Indira in 1933, but she and her mother rejected it, pointing out that she was too young, only 16. He grew close to the Nehru family, especially to Indira&#x27;s mother Kamala Nehru, accompanying her to the TB sanatorium at Bhowali in 1934, helping arrange her trip to Europe when her condition worsened in April 1935, and visiting her at the sanitarium at Badenweiler and finally at Lausanne, where he was at her bedside when she died on 28 February 1936. In the following years, Indira and Feroze grew closer to each other while in England. They married in March 1942 according to Adi Dharam Hindu rituals.
The couple was arrested and jailed in August 1942, during the Quit India Movement less than six months after their marriage. He was imprisoned for a year in Allahabad&#x27;s Naini Central Prison. The following five years were of comfortable domestic life and the couple had two sons, Rajiv and Sanjay, born in 1944 and 1946, respectively.

After independence, Jawaharlal became the first Prime Minister of India. Feroze and Indira settled in Allahabad with their two young children, and Feroze became Managing Director of &quot;The National Herald&quot;, a newspaper founded by his father-in-law, Jawaharlal Nehru.

After being a member of the provincial parliament (1950–1952), Feroze won independent India&#x27;s first general elections in 1952, from Rae Bareli constituency in Uttar Pradesh. Indira travelled from Delhi and worked as his campaign organizer. Feroze soon became a prominent force in his own right, criticizing the government of his father-in-law and beginning a fight against corruption.

In the years after independence, many Indian business houses had become close to the political leaders, and some of them resulted in various financial irregularities. In a case exposed by Feroze in December 1955, he revealed how Ram Kishan Dalmia, as chairman of a bank and an insurance company, used these companies to fund his takeover of Bennett and Coleman and started laundering money from publicly held companies for personal benefit.

In 1957, he was re-elected from Rae Bareli. In the parliament in 1958, he raised the Haridas Mundhra scandal involving the government controlled LIC insurance company. This revelation eventually led to the resignation of the Finance Minister T.T. Krishnamachari.

Feroze also initiated a number of nationalization drives, starting with the Life Insurance Corporation. At one point he also suggested that TATA Engineering and Locomotive Company (TELCO) be nationalized since they were charging nearly double the price of a Japanese railway engine. This raised a stir in the Parsi community since the Tatas were also Parsi. He continued challenging the government on a number of other issues, and emerged as a parliamentarian well-respected on both sides of the bench.

==Death and legacy==
Feroze suffered a heart attack in 1958. Indira, who stayed with her father at Teen Murti House, the official residence of the prime minister, was at that time away on a state visit to Bhutan. She returned to look after him in Kashmir. Feroze died in 1960 at the Willingdon Hospital in Delhi, after suffering a second heart attack. He was cremated and his ashes interred at the Parsi cemetery in Allahabad.

His Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency seat was held by his wife, Indira Gandhi from 1967 to 1976 and his future daughter-in-law, and wife of Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi from 2004 to 2024.

A school of higher education that he helped found was named after him in Rae Bareli. NTPC Limited renamed their Unchahar Thermal Power Station in Uttar Pradesh to Feroze Gandhi Unchahar Thermal Power Plant.

<text>Abraham Pais (; May 19, 1918 – July 28, 2000) was a Dutch-American physicist and science historian. Pais earned his Ph.D. from University of Utrecht just prior to a Nazi ban on Jewish participation in Dutch universities during World War II. When the Nazis began the forced relocation of Dutch Jews, he went into hiding, but was later arrested and saved only by the end of the war. He then served as an assistant to Niels Bohr in Denmark and was later a colleague of Albert Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Pais wrote books documenting the lives of these two great physicists and the contributions they and others made to modern physics. He was a physics professor at Rockefeller University until his retirement.

==Early life==
Pais was born in Amsterdam, the first child of middle-class Dutch-Jewish parents. His father, Isaiah &quot;Jacques&quot; Pais, was the descendant of Sephardic Jewish immigrants from Portugal to the Low Countries around the beginning of the 17th century. His mother, Kaatje &quot;Cato&quot; van Kleeff, was the daughter of an Ashkenazi Jewish diamond cutter. His parents met while studying to become elementary-school teachers. They both taught school until his mother quit when they married on December 2, 1916. His only sibling, Annie, was born on November 1, 1920. During Pais&#x27;s childhood his father was a principal of both a secular school and a Hebrew school.

Pais was a bright student and a voracious reader during his early education and said he had a happy childhood and felt integrated in Dutch society. At age twelve he passed examinations to enter a Hogere Burgerschool and attended a school in Amsterdam with a five-year curriculum of basic subjects. He passed his final examinations as number one in his class. He graduated with a working knowledge of English, French, and German.

==Higher education==
In the fall of 1935 Pais began his studies at the University of Amsterdam without a clear idea regarding his desired career. With an interest in the exact sciences, he gradually gravitated to chemistry and physics as major subjects, and mathematics and astronomy as minor subjects. In the winter of 1936/1937 his career goals were defined by two guest lectures by George Uhlenbeck, professor of theoretical physics at University of Utrecht. Pais was fascinated by Uhlenbeck&#x27;s discussion of Enrico Fermi&#x27;s incorporation of the neutrino into the theory of beta radiation.

On February 16, 1938, Pais was awarded two Bachelor of Science degrees in physics and mathematics, with minors in chemistry and astronomy. He began attending graduate courses in Amsterdam, including those in physics. He soon became disappointed by the only professor there in theoretical physics, (the son of the 1910 Nobel laureate Johannes Diderik van der Waals), whom he found dull and averse to the new developments in physics. Pais soon wrote to Uhlenbeck at Utrecht and was granted an interview. During the remainder of the spring term he discontinued attending classes in Amsterdam and made several trips to visit Uhlenbeck in his laboratory.

In the fall of 1938 Pais enrolled for graduate classes at University of Utrecht. Uhlenbeck, however, spent that term as a visiting professor at Columbia University in New York City. He left Pais with the use of his laboratory and a list of topics to study and work on. Pais was soon exposed to other prominent Dutch physicists and areas of research in experimental physics. He became well-acquainted with Hendrik Anthony Kramers, a physics professor at Leiden University who lectured at Utrecht twice a week on quantum physics. When Uhlenbeck returned from America, he brought news of a meeting he had attended in Washington, D.C., in which Niels Bohr and Enrico Fermi had first made public their news about nuclear fission. Uhlenbeck also announced that he would be leaving in the summer of 1939 for a professorship at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

In the fall of 1939 Pais dedicated himself to preparing for his master&#x27;s degree. Utrecht experimental physicist Leonard Salomon Ornstein provided him guidance in his independent physics studies. He was also influenced then by discussions with Léon Rosenfeld of the University of Liège, who was invited to Utrecht to give a colloquium in an effort to find a successor for Uhlenbeck and reported on the work he was then doing with Christian Møller on the meson theory of nuclear forces.

Pais successfully passed the examination for his master&#x27;s degree on April 22, 1940. On May 7 the Dutch minister of education appointed Rosenfeld to succeed Uhlenbeck at the University of Utrecht. On May 8 Pais wrote to Rosenfeld at Liège to ask if he might continue his studies under him if his appointment came through, and again on May 9 to congratulate him on his appointment. On May 10, 1940, the Germans invaded the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, disrupting the mail between Utrecht and Liège for months.

After mail service was restored, Pais again wrote to Rosenfeld in Liège. In the meantime Pais had been appointed as Rosenfeld&#x27;s assistant — Kees van Lier, who had been Uhlenbeck&#x27;s assistant and was to continue as such under Rosenfeld, had committed suicide following the German invasion. Rosenfeld approved of his appointment and arrived at Utrecht in September 1940 and Pais began working on his doctoral dissertation.

Rosenfeld proposed that for his thesis Pais should formulate Rosenfeld and Møller&#x27;s meson theory in terms of the five-dimensional space known as projective relativity theory, and then to use this theory to calculate the probability for the disintegration of deuterons when irradiated by energetic photons. Pais set to work studying projective relativity, meson theories, and nuclear physics related to the deuteron.

In November 1940 the German authorities issued a decree banning Jews from all civil service positions, including academic posts. Pais therefore lost his assistant professorship, though Rosenfeld secretly arranged for his successor to unofficially share the responsibilities and salary of the position with Pais. Professor Leonard Ornstein, however, lost his directorship of and access to the laboratory and died a broken man on May 20, 1941. A subsequent German decree ordered that doctorate degrees could not be issued to Jews after June 14, 1941. Pais worked feverishly to complete his dissertation and meet other requirements for his doctorate. He obtained his doctoral degree in theoretical physics on June 9, just five days before the deadline. His was the last Ph.D. issued to a Dutch Jew until after the war.

==German occupation==

During his student years Pais had been involved in the Zionist movement, through which he became acquainted with Trusha (Tirtsah) van Amerongen and Tina (Tineke) Strobos, and developed a close friendship with these two women and their families.

The Germans began to gradually restrict the activities of the Dutch Jews and in early 1942 required them to wear yellow stars. At first Pais felt safe because his former university status exempted him from being sent to a labor camp. In early 1943, however, the Dutch secretary general of internal affairs, Frederiks, made arrangements for the university Jews to report to Barneveld for their own safety, where they would be housed in a chateau. Pais did not trust that and instead went into hiding. Those who reported to Barneveld were later sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp where most of them did survive.

His friend and for a time fiancee Tina Strobos was not Jewish and thus was freer of restrictions and threat of incarceration. She arranged hiding places for Pais and other Jews in Amsterdam. When the Germans began forcing the Dutch Jews into a ghetto in the old Jewish quarter of Amsterdam, his sister Annie and her husband Hermann complied. Tina found them a place to hide, but despite Pais&#x27;s urgent pleas for them to take advantage of it, they did not think it necessary. Annie was later killed at the Sobibór extermination camp. Tina had found refuge for Pais&#x27;s parents on a farm outside Amsterdam where they survived the war. She also acted as a courier between Pais and his parents during the war, though neither knew of the other&#x27;s specific location.

His last hiding place was in an apartment with his university friend Lion Nordheim, his wife Jeanne, and her sister Trusha van Amerongen. In the course of his hiding he kept in touch with the scientific community through visits at his hiding place by Hendrik Anthony Kramers and Lambertus Broer. Jeanne and Trusha had blond hair and blue eyes and ventured out in public as non-Jews, while Lion and Pais hid in the apartment. In March 1945, however, they were betrayed and all four were arrested. The same week the Americans had crossed the Rhine and cut the rail lines, making impossible their transfer to a concentration camp. The women were soon released. After a month of interrogation by the Gestapo, Pais was released several days before the end of the war. Nordheim was executed ten days before the end of the war.

==Career in particle physics==
During World War II, Pais&#x27;s doctoral dissertation had attracted the attention of Niels Bohr, who invited him to come to Denmark as his assistant. Pais was forced into hiding before he could leave the Netherlands. In 1946, following the war, Pais was able to accept that invitation and served as a personal assistant to Bohr at his country home in Tisvilde for a year.

In 1947 he accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in the United States and thus became a colleague of Albert Einstein.

In 1949 he became corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

For the next 25 years he worked on elementary particle theory with a primary interest in quantum field theory and symmetry. The technical contributions for which he is recognized include a precise definition of G-parity with Res Jost, and his treatment of SU(6) symmetry breaking.

He is primarily associated with two concepts that directly contributed to major breakthroughs in his field. The first was the idea of &quot;associated production&quot; to explain the puzzling properties of strange particles. His ideas and those of Murray Gell-Mann resulted in the idea of a quantum number called strangeness. The second concept was Pais&#x27;s and Gell-Mann&#x27;s theory regarding the composition of the neutral kaons, proposing that the observed states were admixtures of particles and antiparticles, having different lifetimes; this was experimentally confirmed in the following year by Lederman and collaborators.
In 1956, Pais became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

Pais was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1962.

In 1963 Pais accepted a position at Rockefeller University to head the theoretical physics group while Rockefeller was in transition from being a medical institute to a university. He finished his career there as the Detlev W. Bronk professor emeritus.

In 1972, Pais was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1979, Pais was awarded the J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize.

In 1984, Pais was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

== Science historian ==
In the late 1970s Pais became interested in documenting the history of modern physics. He felt he was in a unique position to do so, having known many of the key people and with his knowledge of the language, culture, and science.

Pais was perhaps best known for his biography of Albert Einstein, &quot;Subtle is the Lord: The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein&quot;, and its companion volume, &quot;Einstein Lived Here&quot; (Clarendon Press/Oxford University Press, 1994). &quot;Subtle is the Lord&quot; won the 1983 U.S. National Book Award in Science.

His &quot;Inward Bound: Of matter and forces in the physical world&quot; (Clarendon Press/Oxford University Press, 1988) describes the events in physics during the preceding 100 years, and tries to explain why they happened as they did.

In 1991 he published &quot;Niels Bohr&#x27;s Times: In physics, philosophy, and polity&quot; (Clarendon Press/Oxford University Press, 1991) which describes the life and scientific contributions of Bohr.

In 1995 he teamed with Laurie M. Brown and Sir Brian Pippard to compile a three-volume reference collection of articles portraying the scientific and cultural development of modern physics in &quot;Twentieth Century Physics&quot; (American Institute of Physics and the Institute of Physics, U.K., 1995). That same year Rockefeller University awarded him the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science.

&quot;A Tale of Two Continents: A physicist&#x27;s life in a turbulent world&quot; (Princeton University Press, 1997) was his autobiography. It refers to the &#x27;esemplastic power of the imagination&#x27;.

His book &quot;The Genius of Science: A portrait gallery&quot; (Oxford University Press, 2000) contains biographies of seventeen distinguished physicists he had known personally: Niels Bohr, Max Born, Paul Dirac, Albert Einstein, Mitchell Feigenbaum, Res Jost, Oskar Klein, Hans Kramers, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang, John von Neumann, Wolfgang Pauli, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Robert Serber, George Uhlenbeck, Victor Frederick Weisskopf, and Eugene Wigner.

Pais was working on a biography of Robert Oppenheimer at the time of his death. (Pais was a colleague of Oppenheimer&#x27;s at the Institute for Advanced Studies.) The biography was finished by Robert P. Crease and published posthumously as &quot;J. Robert Oppenheimer: A Life&quot; (Oxford University Press, 2006).

The American Physical Society has awarded an Abraham Pais Prize for History of Physics annually since 2005.

==Later life==
After his retirement Pais and his third wife Ida Nicolaisen spent half their time in Denmark where he worked at the Niels Bohr Institute. His son Josh Pais is an American actor. His grandson, Zane Pais, is also an actor. Pais died of a heart attack in Copenhagen.

<text>The Future Sound of London (often abbreviated FSOL) is a British electronic music duo composed of Garry Cobain and Brian Dougans. They have been described as a &quot;boundary-pushing&quot; electronic act, covering techno, ambient, house music, trip hop, psychedelia, and dub.

While keeping an enigmatic image and releasing music under many aliases, the band found commercial success with singles &quot;Papua New Guinea&quot; (1991) and &quot;Cascade&quot; (1993), and albums &quot;Lifeforms&quot; (1994), &quot;ISDN&quot; (1995) and &quot;Dead Cities&quot; (1996). In recent years, the duo has become more candid with their fanbase online. Their later work include their series of experimental &quot;Environments&quot; and &quot;Archives&quot; albums.

==History==

=== Formation ===
Garry Cobain and Brian Dougans met in the mid-1980s while studying electronics at university in Manchester. Dougans had already been making electronic music, working between Glasgow and Manchester, when the pair first began working together in local clubs. In 1988, Dougans embarked on a project for a graphic studio &quot;Stakker&quot;, which resulted with a single &quot;Stakker Humanoid&quot; that reached number 17 in the UK charts, introducing acid house to mainstream audience. Cobain contributed to the accompanying album &quot;Global&quot;. In the following years the pair produced music under a variety of aliases, releasing a number of singles and EPs, including &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Metropolis&quot;, later featured on the 1992 compilation &quot;Earthbeat&quot;. They were initially signed to the British sub-label of Passion Music, Jumpin&#x27; &amp; Pumpin&#x27;.

In 1991, Cobain and Dougans released their breakthrough single, &quot;Papua New Guinea&quot; on Jumpin&#x27; &amp; Pumpin&#x27;. The song was based upon a sample from &quot;Dawn of the Iconoclast&quot; by Dead Can Dance and a bassline from &quot;Radio Babylon&quot; by Meat Beat Manifesto. It enjoyed great success, charting at #22 for seven weeks in 1992. The single was followed by their debut album, &quot;Accelerator&quot;, which included &quot;Papua New Guinea&quot; among other new tracks. After a few other releases on Jumpin&#x27; &amp; Pumpin&#x27;, they were signed by Virgin Records, with the free rein to experiment.

In 1993, the duo released an ambient album &quot;Tales of Ephidrina&quot;, the first under the alias Amorphous Androgynous. The focus on texture and mood, while retaining dance beats, was well received. The album was released on Quigley, the band&#x27;s own short-lived offshoot of Virgin. The band begun experimenting with radio performance, broadcasting three-hour radio shows to Manchester&#x27;s Kiss FM from their studio.

===&quot;Lifeforms&quot; and the &quot;ISDN&quot; tour===
In 1993, the band released &quot;Cascade,&quot; a nearly 40 minutes single which made the UK top 30. It was followed in 1994 by the album &quot;Lifeforms&quot;, released to critical acclaim and a top 10 hit on the UK album chart. The eponymous single featured Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins on vocals. The record introduced an array of exotic, tropical sound samples. Dougans&#x27; father&#x27;s involvement in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop had a heavy influence on &quot;Lifeforms&quot;. Often asked whether Brian Eno was an influence, Cobain and Dougans said they were about looking to the future not the past. To them, &quot;Lifeforms&quot; was a new work not just another Eno-type ambient album.

That year, the Future Sound of London released a limited-edition album &quot;ISDN&quot;, which featured live broadcasts made over ISDN lines to various radio stations worldwide to promote &quot;Lifeforms&quot;, including The Kitchen, an avant-garde performance space in New York, and several appearances on BBC &quot;Sessions&quot; hosted by John Peel. The shows featured ambient soundscapes with previously released material performed alongside unheard tracks. One performance for BBC Radio 1 featured Robert Fripp. The tone of &quot;ISDN&quot; was darker and more rhythmic than &quot;Lifeforms&quot;. The band wanted to achieve something epic and grand, but no matter how much technological or personal support they had they never got to truly do what they envisioned. Cobain said that the 90s were a time of frustration because the technology didn&#x27;t fit the band&#x27;s ideas. In 1995, the album was re-released with expanded artwork and a slightly altered track list.

The band&#x27;s interests have covered different areas including film and video, 2D and 3D computer graphics, animation in making almost all their own videos for their singles, radio broadcasting and creating electronic devices for sound making.

===&quot;Dead Cities&quot;===

The 1995 edition of &quot;John Peel Sessions&quot; featured new tracks which moved away from breakbeat and the free sampling of &quot;ISDN&quot;. In 1996, the band released &quot;Dead Cities&quot; which expanded upon these early demos, in a mix of ambient textures and dance music. The new sound was introduced in the lead single &quot;My Kingdom.&quot; The album featured the first collaboration with composer Max Richter, including on a 1997 big beat single &quot;We Have Explosive&quot; that featured manipulated samples of Run DMC. The track was used on popular soundtracks to &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, and the video game &quot;WipE&#x27;out&quot; 2097&quot;, the latter also including a new track &quot;Landmass.&quot; &quot;We Have Explosive&quot; was the band&#x27;s highest-charting single, and over the course of its five-part extended version included hints of funk.

The album was promoted by what the band described as &quot;the fuck rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll tour&quot; via ISDN, gaining attention as the first world tour without leaving a studio. While the 1994 tour focused on creating soundscapes and unreleased material, the 1996 and 1997 shows were more conventional, each offering a different take on music featured on &quot;Dead Cities&quot;, blending current with occasional unreleased tracks. The final performances included considerable use of live guitar and percussion. These sessions were the basis of the band&#x27;s later psychedelic projects of the following decade, while others appeared on the subsequent album series &quot;From The Archives&quot;.

===New millennium===
After a four-year hiatus, rumours of mental illness began to spread. In an interview, Cobain revealed that he had been undertaking spiritual experimentation and had dealt with a bout of mercury poisoning, with over one hundred times the amount deemed to be safe. He gained much from his experience, realising that he could use music as a tool for psychic exploration, entertainment, and healing. The pair returned in 2002 with &quot;The Isness&quot;, a record heavily influenced by 1960s and 1970s psychedelia and released under their alias Amorphous Androgynous. It was preceded by &quot;Papua New Guinea Translations&quot;, a mini album which contained a mixture of remixes of FSOL&#x27;s track as well as new material from &quot;The Isness&quot; sessions. The album received mixed press due to the drastic change in sound which was inspired by Cobain&#x27;s and Dougan&#x27;s (separate) travels to India and immersion in spiritualism, nevertheless the majority was positive with &quot;Muzik&quot; magazine offering the album a 6/5 mark and dubbing it &quot;...a white beam of light from heaven...&quot; and other British publications such as &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;MOJO&quot; praising the album and the band&#x27;s ability to do something so completely different from what they had done before.

Three years on, they followed the album with a continuation of the Amorphous Androgynous project, &quot;Alice in Ultraland&quot;. Rumoured to be accompanied by a film of the same title, the album took &quot;The Isness&quot;″ psychedelic experimentation and toned it down, giving the album a singular theme and sound, and replacing the more bizarre moments with funk and ambient interludes. The album was ignored by the press, but was received more favourably among fans than its predecessor. Unlike &quot;The Isness&quot;, which featured almost 100 musicians over the course of it and the various alternative versions and remix albums, &quot;Alice in Ultraland&quot; featured a fairly solid band lineup throughout, which extended to live shows which the band had undertaken away from the ISDN cables from 2005 onwards.
===5.1 and digital experimentation===
The FSOL moniker re-appeared in 2006 with a piece entitled &quot;A Gigantic Globular Burst of Anti-Static&quot;, intended as an experiment in 5.1 Surround Sound and created for an exhibition at the Kinetica art museum entitled, appropriately, &quot;Life Forms&quot;. The piece contained reworked material from their archives and newer, more abstract ambient music. The piece was coupled with a video called &quot;Stereo Sucks&quot;, marking the band&#x27;s theories on the limitations of stereo music, which was released on a DVD packaged with issue 182 of &quot;Future Music Magazine&quot; in December 2006 and on FSOL&#x27;s own download site in March 2007.

They also moved into creating their own sounds when they began constructing electronic instruments, the result of which can be heard on the 2007 release &quot;Hand-Made Devices&quot;. At their website Glitch TV (where the motto is &quot;[A] sudden interruption in sanity, continuity or programme function&quot;) they sell and explain their devices such as the &quot;Electronic Devices Digital Interface&quot; glitch equipment.

===FSOLdigital and the Archives===
In 2007, the band uploaded several archive tracks online, for the first time revealing much of their unreleased work and unveiling some of the mystery behind the band. The old FSOL material, including the previously unreleased album &quot;Environments&quot;, along with a selection of newer experiments, the 5.1 experiments and a promise of unreleased Amorphous Androgynous psychedelic material, was uploaded for sale on their online shop, FSOLdigital.com.
In early March 2008, the band released a new online album as Amorphous Androgynous entitled &quot;The Peppermint Tree and Seeds of Superconsciousness&quot;, which they describe as &quot;A collection of psychedelic relics from The Amorphous Androgynous, 1967–2007&quot;. The release retains the sound of their last two psychedelic albums, while expanding on the element of funk first introduced on 2005&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Ultraland&quot;. They recorded their following album, &quot;The Woodlands of Old&quot;, under the alias of their imaginary engineer Yage. Unlike the techno work recorded as Yage in 1992, this new record was darker, more trip hop and world music-oriented and featured ex-Propellerheads member Will White.

From 2008, the band showcased a series of radio broadcasts and podcasts called The Electric Brain Storms, originally on stations such as Proton Radio, PBS radio in Australia, and Frisky Radio. The remaining shows appeared on the band&#x27;s official site and SoundCloud. The shows featured electronic, krautrock, experimental and psychedelic favourites of the band mixed in with known and unknown FSOL material, including newly recorded tracks, archived pieces, and new alias recordings. Many of the new tracks appeared on the band&#x27;s &quot;Environments&quot; series. Cobain has described the new music as having &quot;the introspective, kind of euphoric sadness that was always there in the FSOL melodies&quot;.

From this point, the band have been alternating their focus between different projects. In 2008, &quot;Environments II&quot; and &quot;From the Archives Vol. 5&quot; were released on the band&#x27;s site, followed by &quot;Environments 3&quot; and &quot;From the Archives Vol. 6&quot; in 2010; and &quot;Environments 4&quot; and &quot;From the Archives Vol. 7&quot; in 2012. Whilst the Archives feature old, unreleased material, the &quot;Environments&quot; albums feature a mixture of old demos, recently completed, and new tracks.

The band have continued to use the FSOLDigital platform to release side-projects and solo work, under names such as Blackhill Transmitter, EMS : Piano, Suburban Domestic and 6 Oscillators in Remittance, as well as distributing digital releases from other artists, including Daniel Pemberton, Herd, Kettel &amp; Secede, Neotropic, Ross Baker and Seafar; they also continue to update The Pod Room with ISDN transmissions from the 1990s.

===&quot;A Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble Exploding in Your Mind&quot;===
Following on from the band&#x27;s 1997 DJ set of the same name, a series of &quot;Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble Exploding in Your Mind&quot; mix CDs were begun in 2006. The first two were released under the Amorphous Androgynous alias, subtitled &quot;Cosmic Space Music&quot; and &quot;Pagan Love Vibrations&quot;, with the first taking over two years to compile, mix and gain sample clearance, both featuring the band&#x27;s psychedelic influences. A third is set for release sometime in 2010, and will be more electronic, mixed by the Future Sound of London. Further mixes in the series are expected in the future, to be curated by related artists, and the band took the concept live with an eleven-hour spot at 2009&#x27;s Green Man festival, to contain live bands and DJ spots.

Noel Gallagher of British rock band Oasis, after hearing the first release, became a fan and asked the band to remix the following Oasis single &quot;Falling Down&quot;. The Amorphous Androgynous responded with a 5 part, 22-minute Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble remix, which Noel liked enough to release on its own 12&quot;. Noel also invited Cobain to DJ at the afterparty for one of Oasis&#x27; gigs at Wembley Arena.

The band continue the psychedelic theme to the mixes on their podcast site The Pod Room and on February 2010s Mojo Magazine cover CD. The &quot;Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble&quot; remixes grow in popularity with commissions from Paul Weller and Pop Levi, and Cobain has suggested a full album of remixes and covers will appear on their recently formed &quot;Monstrous Bubble&quot; label

On 6 July 2011 it was announced that Noel Gallagher&#x27;s second solo album would be in collaboration with The Amorphous Androgynous, and was set for release in 2012. In August 2012, Gallagher mentioned in various interviews that he was considering scrapping the collaborative album with Amorphous Androgynous due to not being completely satisfied with the mixes. Two songs from the project have surfaced as B-sides to Gallagher&#x27;s singles in 2012: &quot;Shoot a Hole into the Sun&quot; (based on Gallagher&#x27;s track &quot;If I Had a Gun...&quot;) was a B-side to the single &quot;Dream On&quot;, and a mix of &quot;AKA... What a Life!&quot; featured on the B-side of &quot;Everybody&#x27;s on the Run&quot;. However, as the project was shelved in November 2012, the group have returned to original material, releasing the first in a series of &quot;Monstrous Bubble Soundtracks&quot;, entitled &quot;The Cartel&quot;. On Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds&#x27; album &quot;Chasing Yesterday&quot;, The Amorphous Androgynous are credited as Co-producers of the tracks &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; and &quot;The Mexican&quot;.

===Recent work===
With the freedom of working independently from a record label, the group have remained prolific, working on multiple projects at once. Since 2014, the majority have releases through FSOLDigital have been of newly recorded material, with &quot;Environment Five&quot; being the first in the series to feature all new tracks. Since then, FSOL releases have been less conventional, with &quot;Environment Six&quot; being split over three volumes, named &quot;Environment Six&quot;, &quot;Environment 6.5&quot; and &quot;Environmental&quot;, the latter part of a triple LP release called &quot;Archived : Environmental : Views&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Environment 7&quot; is planned as a trilogy, the first volume released for Record Store Day 2022 under the name &quot;Rituals&quot;. In a move further from traditional structures, several albums have been released under the banner FSOLDigital Presents, including yearly &quot;Calendar Albums&quot;, presented to subscribers as a track each month, and mix albums as part of the &quot;A Controlled Vista&quot; and &quot;Mind Maps&quot; series. FSOLDigital has also been used as a publishing outlet, with books exploring the artwork and history of the band, each combined with a music package; a series of A6 books entitled &quot;The Ramblings of a Madman&quot; was also produced, with the accompanying download EPs later repackaged into an album entitled &quot;Music for 3 Books&quot;. Alongside books, the band have further explored multimedia, including a series of digital artwork releases as NFTs on Foundation and a pair of synthesisers created in collaboration with Digitana, the SX-1 and the HALia, the former being manufactured as of July 2018, the latter still in pre-production. A series of re-recordings of older tracks, combined with new remixes and related material, was released between 2018 and 2021 for Record Store Day, in place of conventional reissues; the reissue series so far features &quot;My Kingdom Re-Imagined&quot;, &quot;Yage 2019&quot;, &quot;Cascade 2020&quot; and &quot;We Have Explosive 2021&quot;.

As well as The Future Sound of London, Dougans and Cobain have also revisited older side-projects. Dougans&#x27;s solo project Humanoid has been active again since 2014, releasing the albums &quot;Built by Humanoid&quot; and &quot;7 Songs&quot; as well as a string of EPs. Meanwhile, Cobain, in collaboration with Dougans and new co-producer Enrico Berto, began work on new Amorphous Androgynous material, with a double album of versions and remixes of the track &quot;We Persuade Ourselves We Are Immortal&quot; appearing in 2020. Alongside contributors such as Paul Weller, Ray Fenwick and Brian Hopper, the release features lead vocals by Peter Hammill, who is also credited on the album cover. Further alias releases have included albums released under the Blackhill Transmitter and Synthi-A names, as well as collaborations with Ross Baker and Daniel Pemberton.

==Independence==
Since the millennium, FSOL took a more independent turn with their career, releasing their more psychedelic &quot;Amorphous Androgynous&quot; on an independent label, &quot;The Isness&quot; on Artful Records and &quot;Alice in Ultraland&quot; on the progressive Harvest Records (an arm of EMI). They also have their own label called &quot;Electronic Brain Violence&quot; on which off-beat electronic artists such as Oil and Simon Wells (Headstone Lane) have released EPs and singles. Simon Wells also contributed to &quot;Dead Cities&quot; on the track &quot;Dead Cities Reprise&quot;

Nevertheless, Virgin records still controls FSOL&#x27;s back catalog and was going to release the &quot;Teachings from the Electronic Brain&quot; compilation without them, but the duo insisted on taking control of the production of the project. Cobain says that, even with Virgin, the reason they were able to do their own thing and create the music they wanted in the 1990s was because they already had some major hits under their belts such as &quot;Papua New Guinea&quot;, &quot;Metropolis&quot; and &quot;Stakker Humanoid&quot; before joining the label.

Cobain has said that FSOL&#x27;s mentality has always been about making a journey of an album rather than focusing on trying to have hit singles. He said that they had several top 40 singles (and albums) in the 90s because they had enough fans and had built up enough of a reputation to achieve these hits while still concentrating on the album rather than any potential singles during their time at Virgin.

They have been signed to Passion Records sub-label Jumpin&#x27; &amp; Pumpin&#x27; since they started out.

<text>Reset also known as fixing is a generic concept in the EV financial markets, meaning the determination and recording of a reference rate, usually in order to calculate the settlement value of a periodic payment schedule between two parties.

Resets are most commonly used in Interest rate swaps, to determine the value of the floating rate payment for each period. The parties will have agreed a source for the reference rate (usually a named screen on an information vendors system, though any public domain source will do, such as a newspaper or government publication). Fixing involves looking up the reference value on the agreed date, recording, then computing a payment based on the rate.

Fixing can often change the value of a financial instrument, and can be difficult to encode in the software models used to price such instruments. Other examples of fixing are in asian options, where the underlying of the option is an average of some kind, and in OIS type swaps, where periodic payments are made on the basis of simple composition or average of overnight interest rates observed during each coupon period.

<text>Circular error probable (CEP), also circular error probability or circle of equal probability, is a measure of a weapon system&#x27;s precision in the military science of ballistics. It is defined as the radius of a circle, centered on the aimpoint, that is expected to enclose the landing points of 50% of the rounds; said otherwise, it is the median error radius, which is a 50% confidence interval. That is, if a given munitions design has a CEP of 100 m, when 100 munitions are targeted at the same point, an average of 50 will fall within a circle with a radius of 100 m about that point.

There are associated concepts, such as the DRMS (distance root mean square), which is the square root of the average squared distance error, a form of the standard deviation. Another is the R95, which is the radius of the circle where 95% of the values would fall, a 95% confidence interval.

The concept of CEP also plays a role when measuring the accuracy of a position obtained by a navigation system, such as GPS or older systems such as LORAN and Loran-C.

==Concept==

The original concept of CEP was based on a circular bivariate normal distribution (CBN) with CEP as a parameter of the CBN just as μ and σ are parameters of the normal distribution. Munitions with this distribution behavior tend to cluster around the mean impact point, with most reasonably close, progressively fewer and fewer further away, and very few at long distance. That is, if CEP is &quot;n&quot; metres, 50% of shots land within &quot;n&quot; metres of the mean impact, 43.7% between &quot;n&quot; and &quot;2n&quot;, and 6.1% between &quot;2n&quot; and &quot;3n&quot; metres, and the proportion of shots that land farther than three times the CEP from the mean is only 0.2%.

CEP is not a good measure of accuracy when this distribution behavior is not met. Munitions may also have larger standard deviation of range errors than the standard deviation of azimuth (deflection) errors, resulting in an elliptical confidence region. Munition samples may not be exactly on target, that is, the mean vector will not be (0,0). This is referred to as bias.

To incorporate accuracy into the CEP concept in these conditions, CEP can be defined as the square root of the mean square error (MSE). The MSE will be the sum of the variance of the range error plus the variance of the azimuth error plus the covariance of the range error with the azimuth error plus the square of the bias. Thus the MSE results from pooling all these sources of error, geometrically corresponding to radius of a circle within which 50% of rounds will land.

Several methods have been introduced to estimate CEP from shot data. Included in these methods are the plug-in approach of Blischke and Halpin (1966), the Bayesian approach of Spall and Maryak (1992), and the maximum likelihood approach of Winkler and Bickert (2012). The Spall and Maryak approach applies when the shot data represent a mixture of different projectile characteristics (e.g., shots from multiple munitions types or from multiple locations directed at one target).

==Conversion==
While 50% is a very common definition for CEP, the circle dimension can be defined for percentages. Percentiles can be determined by recognizing that the horizontal position error is defined by a 2D vector which components are two orthogonal Gaussian random variables (one for each axis), assumed uncorrelated, each having a standard deviation formula_1. The &quot;distance error&quot; is the magnitude of that vector; it is a property of 2D Gaussian vectors that the magnitude follows the Rayleigh distribution, with scale factor formula_1. The &quot;distance root mean square&quot; (DRMS), is formula_3 and doubles as a sort of standard deviation, since errors within this value make up 63% of the sample represented by the bivariate circular distribution. In turn, the properties of the Rayleigh distribution are that its percentile at level formula_4 is given by the following formula:

:formula_5

or, expressed in terms of the DRMS:

:formula_6

The relation between formula_7 and formula_8 are given by the following table, where the formula_8 values for DRMS and 2DRMS (twice the distance root mean square) are specific to the Rayleigh distribution and are found numerically, while the CEP, R95 (95% radius) and R99.7 (99.7% radius) values are defined based on the 68–95–99.7 rule

We can then derive a conversion table to convert values expressed for one percentile level, to another. Said conversion table, giving the coefficients formula_10 to convert formula_11 into formula_12, is given by:

For example, a GPS receiver having a 1.25 m DRMS will have a 1.25 m × 1.73 = 2.16 m 95% radius.

<text>The Kenny Everett Video Show (later renamed The Kenny Everett Video Cassette) is a British television comedy and music programme that was made by Thames Television for ITV from 3 July 1978 to 21 May 1981.

==Overview==
Philip Jones, Thames Television&#x27;s head of light entertainment, asked his son who he would like to see on television - he replied Kenny Everett. The show&#x27;s format was conceived over lunch and a walk between producer David Mallet and Everett himself, having decided that they could not watch on television what they wanted to watch.

Originally, the &quot;Video Show&quot; consisted of Everett in the role of a visual DJ linking studio performances from bands, singers, and the show&#x27;s resident dance troupe Hot Gossip, along with occasional sketches and Captain Kremmen cartoons. As the series developed, the linking material became longer and more varied - to such an extent that the final series, renamed &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Cassette&quot;, focused far more heavily on the comedy with just one musical guest per week.

The &quot;Video Show&quot; was performed to the studio crew with their laughter heard on the finished programme, unlike Everett&#x27;s later BBC series, &quot;The Kenny Everett Television Show&quot;, which had a conventional live studio audience. Bloopers were often not edited out of sketches. Two pilot episodes were made, which no longer exist. Initially, the series was produced at Thames&#x27; Euston Road headquarters in central London and recorded in small studios normally used for news and current affairs programmes. Production later transferred to Thames&#x27; main studios in Teddington.

As of October 2021, the series was being repeated on nostalgia-themed Freeview station That&#x27;s TV Gold alongside another Thames TV comedy show licensed from Fremantle, &quot;The Best of Tommy Cooper&quot;. That&#x27;s TV have kept Everett&#x27;s &#x27;naughty bits&#x27; intact with a warning added at the beginning of the programme and after the advert break, due to the prospect of the content causing offence to modern viewers.

==Series guide==
===Series 1===
The first episode of the &quot;Video Show&quot; aired at 6:45pm on Monday, 3 July 1978. The eight-part series (45 minutes per episode) continued until 21 August 1978 and consisted mostly of musical performances, alongside Hot Gossip routines, Captain Kremmen cartoons and occasional OB segments.

The &quot;Video Vault&quot; clips segment included a &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; section, which predominantly featured clips from the ABC Television music series, &quot;Oh Boy!&quot;. Regular comic characters included &#x27;Sid Snot&#x27;, &#x27;Angry of Mayfair&#x27; and Everett dressed in a chicken outfit. A &quot;Best of...&quot; compilation aired in some regions after the end of the series.

The following year, series one won the BAFTA television award for Best Light Entertainment Programme.

===Series 2===
Prior to the second series, the programme returned on New Year&#x27;s Day 1979 in most ITV regions (except Scottish Television, which aired the special on 7 January 1979) with the &quot;Didn&#x27;t Quite Make it in Time for Christmas Video Show&quot;, which also aired in a shortened version on 18 April 1979 - as ITV&#x27;s entry for the Golden Rose of Montreux.

Series Two began at 7:00pm on Monday 19 February 1979 with an extended ten-episode run (30 minutes per episode) and a greater reliance on comedy material.

===Series 3===
The &quot;Video Show&quot; returned at 11:00pm on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1979 with an hour-long special, &quot;Will Kenny Everett Make it to 1980?&quot; on most of the ITV network. Scottish Television aired it the following afternoon while Grampian Television opted out of the final part on its original transmission.

Series 3 ran for eight episodes, starting at 7:00pm on Monday 18 February 1980.

===Series 4: &quot;Video Cassette&quot;===
Everett&#x27;s last New Year&#x27;s special, &quot;The Kenny Everett New Year&#x27;s Daze Show&quot; aired at 11:50pm on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1980 over most of the ITV network. Ulster Television never aired this special, while Grampian and Scottish broadcast it two days later.

The final series, renamed &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Cassette&quot;, saw the show moved to Thursday evenings at 7:30 in a bid to compete with BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. There was an even greater reliance on comedy with only one musical guest per episode. The Captain Kremmen cartoons were replaced by shorter live-action studio sketches featuring Anna Dawson as Kremmen&#x27;s assistant Carla.

Unhappy with the scheduling of the series, among other concerns, Everett left Thames and moved to BBC Television.

==VHS and DVD releases==
During the 1980s, several VHS, Betamax and Laserdisc compilations of the series were released by Thames Video. A six-DVD set containing four series - plus the three New Year specials - was released in November 2018. These are edited down, however, due to licensing issues restricting the use of certain musical acts in some episodes.

<doc id="316656" wikidata="Q1417538" url="?curid=316656" title="Fourth World">
<text>The Fourth World is an extension of the three-world model, used variably to refer to
# Sub-populations socially excluded from global society, such as uncontacted peoples;
# Hunter-gatherer, nomadic, pastoral, and some subsistence farming peoples living beyond the modern industrial norm.
# Sub-populations existing in a First World country, but with the living standards of those of a Third World.

The term is not commonly used. &quot;Fourth World&quot; has also been used to refer to other parts of the world in relation to the three-world model.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Fourth World&quot; follows the First World, Second World, and Third World classification of nation-state status; however, unlike the former categories, &quot;Fourth World&quot; is not spatially bounded, and is usually used to refer to size and shape which does not map onto citizenship in a specific nation-state. It can denote nations without a sovereign state, emphasizing the perceived non-recognition and exclusion of ethnically- and religiously-defined peoples from the politico-economic world system, such as the First Nations groups throughout North, Central and South America. Spanish sociologist Manuel Castells of the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication has made extensive use of the term &quot;fourth world&quot;.

== Coinage ==
The term was coined in 1969 by Father Joseph Wresinski when he renamed the charity he had founded in 1957 with families from the Noisy-le-Grand (France) shanty town to &quot;ATD Quart Monde&quot;.

The term was recycled in the 1970s by Mbuto Milando, first secretary of the Tanzanian High Commission, in conversation with George Manuel, Chief of the National Indian Brotherhood (now the Assembly of First Nations). Milando stated that &quot;When Native peoples come into their own, on the basis of their own cultures and traditions, that will be the Fourth World.&quot;

Since publication of Manuel&#x27;s &quot;The Fourth World: An Indian Reality&quot; (1974), the term &quot;Fourth World&quot; became synonymous with stateless, poor, and marginal nations. Since 1979, think tanks such as the Center for World Indigenous Studies have used the term in defining the relationships between ancient, tribal, and non-industrial nations and modern industrialised nation-states. With the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, communications and organizing amongst Fourth World peoples have accelerated in the form of international treaties between aboriginal nations for the purposes of trade, travel, and security.
In the Indian left movement, M. P. Parameswaran&#x27;s ideas on the fourth world caused widespread debates, which eventually led to his expulsion from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in 2004.

<text>Karlovy Vary (; , formerly also spelled &quot;Carlsbad&quot; in English) is a spa city in the Karlovy Vary Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 49,000 inhabitants. It is located at the confluence of the Ohře and Teplá rivers.

Karlovy Vary is named after Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Bohemia, who founded the city in the 14th century. The site of numerous hot springs, the city grew into a spa resort in the 19th century and was a popular destination for the European aristocracy and other luminaries. Karlovy Vary&#x27;s rapid growth was brought to an end by the outbreak of World War I. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, Karlovy Vary once again became a major tourist destination.

Karlovy Vary is the most visited spa town in the Czech Republic. In 2021, the city became part of the transnational UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name &quot;Great Spa Towns of Europe&quot; because of its spas and architecture from the 18th through 20th centuries. The historic city centre with the spa cultural landscape is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation.

==Administrative division==
Karlovy Vary consists of 15 municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Karlovy Vary (11,539)
*Bohatice (2,317)
*Čankov (110)
*Cihelny (16)

*Rybáře (9,204)
*Sedlec (570)
*Stará Role (7,614)
*Tašovice (1,031)
Cihelny forms an exclave of the municipal territory.

==Etymology==
The city is named after its founder Charles IV. The name Karlovy Vary means &quot;Charles&#x27; Baths&quot;. The city was also colloquially called &quot;Warmbad&quot; (German for &#x27;hot bath&#x27;).

==Geography==
Karlovy Vary is located about west of Prague. The northern part of the municipal territory with most of the built-up area lies in a relatively flat landscape of the Sokolov Basin. The southern part, including the valley of the Teplá River, lies in a hilly landscape of the Slavkov Forest and in the eponymous protected landscape area. The highest point is the hill Vítkův vrch at above sea level.

The city lies at the confluence of the Ohře (which flows across the city) with the Teplá and Rolava rivers. There are several small bodies of water in the northern half of the Karlovy Vary territory. The most notable is the natural reservoir Rolava, which is located right in the centre of the city. It is used for recreational purposes.

===Climate===
Karlovy Vary&#x27;s climate is classified as humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dclo&quot;). Among them, the annual average temperature is , the hottest month in July is , and the coldest month is in January. The annual precipitation is , of which June is the wettest with , while February is the driest with only . The extreme temperature throughout the year ranged from on 21 December 1969 to on 27 July 1983 and 20 August 2012.

==History==

An ancient late Bronze Age fortified settlement was found in Drahovice. A Slavic settlement on the site of Karlovy Vary is documented by findings in Tašovice and Sedlec. People lived in close proximity to the site as far back as the 13th century and they must have been aware of the curative effects of thermal springs.

From the end of the 12th century to the early 13th century, German settlers from nearby German-speaking regions came as settlers, craftsmen and miners to develop the region&#x27;s economy. Eventually, Karlovy Vary/Karlsbad became a town with a German-speaking population.

In 1325, Obora, a village in today&#x27;s city area, was mentioned. Karlovy Vary as a small spa settlement was founded most likely around 1349. According to legend, Charles IV organized an expedition into the forests surrounding modern-day Karlovy Vary during a stay in Loket. It is said that his party once discovered a hot spring by accident, and thanks to the water from the spring, Charles IV healed his injured leg. On the site of a spring, he established a spa mentioned as &quot;in dem warmen Bade bey dem Elbogen&quot; in German, or &quot;Horké Lázně u Lokte&quot; (&quot;Hot Spas at the Loket&quot;). The location was subsequently named &quot;Karlovy Vary&quot; after the emperor. Charles IV granted the town privileges on 14 August 1370. Earlier settlements can also be found on the outskirts of today&#x27;s city.

===19th and 20th centuries===

An important political event took place in the city in 1819, with the issuing of the Carlsbad Decrees following a conference there. Initiated by the Austrian Minister of State Klemens von Metternich, the decrees were intended to implement anti-liberal censorship within the German Confederation.

Due to publications produced by physicians such as David Becher and Josef von Löschner, the city developed into a spa resort in the 19th century and was visited by many members of European aristocracy as well as celebrities from many fields of endeavour. It became even more popular after railway lines were completed from Prague to Cheb in 1870.

The number of visitors rose from 134 families in the 1756 season to 26,000 guests annually at the end of the 19th century. The greatest year for tourism was 1911, when the number of visitors reached 70,956. World War I ended the development of tourism. Other disasters for tourism were the world economic crisis and the beginning of World War II.

At the end of World War I in 1918, the large German-speaking population of Bohemia was incorporated into the new state of Czechoslovakia in accordance with the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919). As a result, the German-speaking majority of Karlovy Vary protested. A demonstration on 4 March 1919 passed peacefully, but later that month, six demonstrators were killed by Czech troops after a demonstration became unruly.

According to the 1930 census, the city was home to 23,901 inhabitants – 20,856 were ethnic Germans, 1,446 were Czechoslovaks (Czechs or Slovaks), 243 were Jews, 19 were Hungarians and 12 were Poles.

In 1938, the city was annexed by Nazi Germany according to the terms of the Munich Agreement and administered as part of the Reichsgau Sudetenland. During World War II, the Germans established a Gestapo prison here. After the war, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and Beneš decrees, most German inhabitants were expelled.

After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, spas and tourism began to develop rapidly again. The spa buildings were reconstructed and the spa became competitive again within Europe. The spa became popular with Russian clientele, and brought many Russian investors and developers to the city and its surroundings.

==Demographics==
In 2017, non-Czech residents were around 7% of the population of the Karlovy Vary region. After Prague, this is the highest proportion in the Czech Republic. The largest group of foreigners were Vietnamese, followed by Germans, Ukrainians and Russians.
==Economy==
The city&#x27;s economy is focused on services and only small and medium-sized industrial enterprises are based in it. The main industry is the food and beverage industry, characterized by the bottling of mineral waters and the production of unique delicacies. The largest industrial employer based in the city is Mattoni 1873. Karlovy Vary is known for the popular Czech liqueur &quot;Becherovka&quot;, which has been produced here since 1807. The &quot;Karlovarské oplatky&quot; (Carlsbad wafers) originated in the city in 1867. The city has also lent its name to &quot;Carlsbad plums&quot;, candied stuffed prune plums.

The second important industry is the production of glass and porcelain. Karlovy Vary is known for the lead glass manufacturer Moser Glass founded in 1857, which is considered the most luxurious Czech brand.

The Karlovy Vary agglomeration was defined as a tool for drawing money from the European Structural and Investment Funds. It is an area that includes the city and its surroundings, linked to the city by commuting and migration. It has about 138,000 inhabitants.

===Spa===

Karlovy Vary is the most visited spa town in the Czech Republic. As the principal city on the West Bohemian Spa Triangle and the largest spa complex in Europe, Karlovy Vary has over 80 springs. They are a part of the Eger Graben, a tectonically active region in western Bohemia. Although the infiltration area is several hundred square kilometres, each spring has the same hydrological origins, and therefore shares the same dissolved minerals and chemical formula. The hottest of the springs can approach 74 °C, while the coldest have temperatures under 40 degrees. All of the springs combined provide roughly 2,000 litres of water every minute.

==Transport==
Local buses (Dopravní podnik Karlovy Vary) and cable cars take passengers to most areas of the city. The Imperial funicular is the oldest tunnel funicular in Europe and the steepest in the Czech Republic, the Diana funicular was at the time of commissioning the longest funicular in Austria-Hungary.

The city is accessible via the D6 motorway and inter-city public transport options include inter-city buses, České dráhy, and Deutsche Bahn via the Karlovy Vary–Johanngeorgenstadt railway. Karlovy Vary Airport is an international airport located southeast from the city centre, at the village of Olšová Vrata.

==Culture==

In the 19th century, Karlovy Vary became a popular tourist destination, especially known for international celebrities who visited for spa treatment. The city is also known for the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, which is one of the oldest in the world and one of Europe&#x27;s major film events.

The city has been used as the location for a number of film-shoots, including the 2006 films &quot;Last Holiday&quot; and &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, both of which used the city&#x27;s Grandhotel Pupp in different guises. Moreover, the Palace Bristol Hotel in Karlovy Vary was used as a model for &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot;.

==Sport==
Karlovy Vary is home to the top-tier ice hockey club HC Karlovy Vary, and the top-tier volleyball club VK Karlovarsko.

The city is also represented by the football club FC Slavia Karlovy Vary, which plays in the third tier of the Czech football system.

==Sights==
Karlovy Vary is notable for its large concentration of monuments and architecturally valuable buildings. The origin of most of them is connected with the spa tradition of the city. Since 2018, the spa centre of the city along the Teplá river and the wider surroundings with the spa cultural landscape have been protected as an urban monument reservation. As part of the Great Spa Towns of Europe, Karlovy Vary became a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its spas and architecture from the 18th through 20th centuries.

===Spa buildings===

&quot;Císařské lázně&quot; is the most important spa building, protected as a national cultural monument. It was built in the historicist style of the French Neo-Renaissance in 1893–1895. The largest colonnade with five mineral springs is the Mill Colonnade (Czech: &quot;Mlýnská&quot;; pseudo-Renaissance structure, built in 1871–1881). The best-known spring is Vřídlo, located in Hot Spring Colonnade (&quot;Vřídelní&quot;; built in Functionalistic style in 1975). The spring gushes out in a geyser up to high. Other colonnades in the city are Park Colonnade (&quot;Sadová&quot;; cast-iron architecture structure built in 1880–1881 by Fellner &amp; Helmer), Market Colonnade (&quot;Tržní&quot;; a wooden structure, built in Swiss style in 1882–1883 by Fellner &amp; Helmer), and Castle Colonnade (&quot;Zámecká&quot;; built in Art Nouveau style in 1910–1912 by Friedrich Ohmann).

===Churches===

The most valuable church is the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene. It is a Catholic church, built in the Baroque style in 1732–1736 on the site of an old Gothic church from the second half of the 14th century. It was built according to the design by Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer and belongs to the most important buildings of the Czech Baroque. It is protected as a national cultural monument.

Among the most famous buildings of the city is the Church of Saint Peter and Paul. It was built in the Byzantine style in 1893–1897. It is the largest Orthodox church west of Post-Soviet states.

The Church of Saint Andrew was built in the late Gothic style around 1500, reconstructed in the Empire style in 1840–1841. A cemetery was established next to the church for foreign guests of the spa who died in Karlovy Vary. In 1911, the cemetery was converted into a park, known as Mozart&#x27;s Park, with many Neoclassical tombstones. Since 2005, it is owned by the Greek Catholic Church.

The Church of Saint Anne was built in the Baroque style in 1738–1749 on the site of an old church. It is a pilgrimage church, in the construction of which K. I. Dientzenhofer took part.

The Church of Saints Peter and Paul is a pseudo-Gothic church, built in 1854–1856 and rebuilt in 1893–1894. Since 1946, it is property of the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.

The Church of Saint Luke is a Methodist pseudo-Gothic two-aisle church, built in 1876–1877. It was built with the financial support of English spa guests. Today it no longer serves religious purposes and houses a wax museum.

The Church of Saint Leonard of Noblac was the oldest ecclesiastical structure in the territory of Karlovy Vary. It was first documented in 1246. This late Romanesque structure is located in the woods south of the city proper, where a village used to be. From the end of the 15th century, after the village was depopulated, the church began to deteriorate and became a ruin.

<doc id="316660" wikidata="Q214350" url="?curid=316660" title="The Libertines">
<text>The Libertines are an English rock band, formed in London in 1997 by frontmen Carl Barât (vocals/guitar) and Pete Doherty (vocals/guitar). The band, centred on the songwriting partnership of Barât and Doherty, has also included John Hassall (bass), and Gary Powell (drums) for most of its recording career. The band was part of the garage rock revival and spearheaded the movement in the UK.

The band gained some notoriety in the early 2000s, due to Doherty&#x27;s use of illegal drugs and conflicts between Barât and Doherty. Although their mainstream success was initially limited, their profile soon grew, culminating in a No. 2 single and No. 1 album on the UK Charts. In December 2004, their self-titled second studio album was voted the second best album of the year by &quot;NME&quot; magazine. The first two of their studio albums were produced by Mick Jones, co-founder of the punk band the Clash.

In spite of their critical and commercial success, the band&#x27;s music was often eclipsed by its internal conflicts, stemming from Doherty&#x27;s addictions to crack cocaine and heroin, which eventually led to the break-up of the band. Doherty has since stated that the break-up of the band was due to relationship difficulties between Barât and himself that were not related to his drug addictions. The members of the Libertines went on to form new bands with varying degrees of success.

In August 2010, the four members of the Libertines reunited to play a series of shows, including slots at the 2010 Reading and Leeds Festivals. The reunion shows received a highly positive response from the press and fans. In April 2014, the Libertines announced they would again reform for a show at London&#x27;s Hyde Park. In November 2014 the band signed a recording contract with Virgin EMI Records, and released their third studio album, &quot;Anthems for Doomed Youth&quot; on 11 September 2015.
&quot;All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade&quot; is their fourth studio album, released on the 5th of April 2024.

==History==
===Early history (1997–2001)===
The founding members of the Libertines, Peter Doherty and Carl Barât, met when Barât was studying drama at Brunel University in Uxbridge and sharing a flat in Richmond with Amy-Jo Doherty, Peter&#x27;s elder sister. This lasted until they realised their collective creative capabilities and forged a bond over their shared passion for songwriting.
Barât abandoned his course two years in; Doherty left his English literature course at Queen Mary, University of London, after only a year, and they moved into a flat together on Camden Road in North London, which they named &quot;The Albion rooms.&quot;

They formed a band with their neighbour Steve Bedlow, commonly referred to as &quot;Scarborough Steve,&quot; and named themselves &quot;the Strand&quot;, later discarded for &quot;the Libertines&quot; after the French writer Marquis de Sade&#x27;s unfinished novel Lusts of the Libertines (&quot;the Albions&quot; was also considered, but rejected; Albion is an archaic name for Britain). They later met John Hassall and Johnny Borrell, who played bass with the Libertines for a short period. Many of their early gigs took place in the flat shared by Doherty and Barât.

They had booked themselves into the Odessa studios and played at Filthy Macnasty&#x27;s Whiskey Cafe in Islington, where Doherty was working as a barman. Roger Morton thought they had potential and offered, with a friend, to manage the Libertines. Despite a separate offer from an experienced member of the music industry, John Waller, the band accepted Morton&#x27;s services as manager. However, Morton would eventually give up the job after an unsuccessful six months.

In March 2000 the Libertines met Banny Poostchi, a lawyer for Warner Chappell Music Publishing. Recognizing their potential, she took on an active role in managing them. They recorded &quot;Legs XI&quot;, a set of their best 8 tracks at the time (and later a popular bootleg recording among fans). However, by December 2000, they had still not been signed and this caused Dufour, Hassall and Pootschi to part ways with the Libertines.

The subsequent success of the Strokes, a band with a similar style, caused Pootschi to reconsider her position. She formed a plan (dubbed &quot;Plan A&quot;) to get the Libertines signed to Rough Trade Records within 6 months. In this period, Barât and Doherty wrote many of the songs which ended up on their debut studio album. Gary Powell was recruited to play drums, as Paul Dufour was deemed by Pootschi to be &#x27;too old&#x27;. On 1 October 2001, Barât and Doherty played a showcase for James Endeacott from Rough Trade. After Borrell failed to attend this important rehearsal, they telephoned him to discover he was on tour &quot;living the high life.&quot; Endeacott&#x27;s support led to them playing for the heads of Rough Trade, Geoff Travis and Jeanette Lee, on 11 December. They were told they would be signed, and the official deal took place on 21 December.

The Libertines were in need of a bassist, so Hassall rejoined the band at their request, but was informed he would have to stay in the background, as the band would be focused on the partnership of Doherty and Barât. After signing with Rough Trade, Doherty and Barât rented a flat together at 112a Teesdale Street in Bethnal Green which they named &quot;The Albion Rooms&quot;, a venue that became a location for many of their Guerrilla gigs.

===Success (2002–2003)===
Now with a firm line-up, they began to play more gigs alongside the Strokes and the Vines in quick succession. This succeeded in spreading their name around the music press, with the &quot;NME&quot; taking a particular interest in them (an interest which continued throughout their career).

Their first single was a double A-side of &quot;What a Waster&quot; and &quot;I Get Along&quot;, produced by former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler. It was released on 3 June 2002 to highly positive reception but received little airplay due to its liberal use of profanities. A censored version appeared as BBC Radio 1 DJs Mark and Lard&#x27;s single of the week. On the week the single came out, the Libertines featured on the cover of the &quot;NME&quot; for the first time. The single reached No. 37 in the UK Singles Chart.
Their debut studio album was recorded and produced by Mick Jones, formerly of the Clash and Big Audio Dynamite. Entitled &quot;Up the Bracket&quot;, it was recorded at the RAK studios in St John&#x27;s Wood, with mixing taking place at Whitfield studios. During this time, the band were playing as many gigs as possible (over 100 in 2002 alone) including support acts for the Sex Pistols and Morrissey of the Smiths.

Their second single and title track from the album, &quot;Up the Bracket&quot;, was released on 30 September and charted at No. 29. This was soon followed by the release on 21 October of the album, which charted at No. 35. They won Best New Band at the NME Awards for that year and Barât moved out of The Albion Rooms.

===Problems (2003)===

During the recording of &quot;Up the Bracket&quot; and in the subsequent touring, Doherty&#x27;s drug use had increased greatly (he was using both crack cocaine and heroin by this time) and his relationship with the rest of the band deteriorated. The band had become fractious, and some of this tension was visible in their performances. Doherty expressed himself in the &quot;Books of Albion&quot;, his personal collection of notes, thoughts and poems, and also more and more frequently on the libertines.org fan forums. His posts and writings at this time were unpredictable: at times, he seemed distressed and angry; at others, he came across as calm and happy.
They went to the US to promote themselves and work on new material. While in New York City around May 2003, they recorded the &quot;Babyshambles Sessions&quot;, where they recorded versions of current and future Libertines and Babyshambles releases such as &quot;Last Post on the Bugle&quot;, &quot;Albion&quot;, &quot;In Love With a Feeling&quot; and &quot;Side of the Road&quot;. As a mark of their commitment to the band, Doherty and Barât both got tattoos of the word &quot;Libertine&quot; on their arms, written in Carl&#x27;s handwriting. The prelude to this moment can be heard on &quot;The Good Old Days&quot; from the Babyshambles Sessions, in which, after the lyric, &quot;A list of things we said we&#x27;d do tomorrow,&quot; Doherty yells &#x27;Get a tattoo!&#x27; However, Barât became increasingly exasperated with the people with whom Doherty was associating and the drugs they brought. Barât quit the sessions in disgust and Doherty finished recording alone. The sessions were given to a fan called Helen Hsu who, as Doherty allegedly instructed, put them out for free on the Internet.

Back in the UK, tensions continued to grow as Doherty organised and played guerrilla gigs which Barât did not attend. Their new single &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back into the Sun&quot; saw the return of Bernard Butler as producer. The lyrical quality of the song was praised, and the single held as a prime example of Doherty and Barât&#x27;s songwriting talents. However, Doherty did not work well with Butler and was rarely present during the recording process. This led to rumors that the song had to be pieced together from the vocals he provided, with Butler himself recording Doherty&#x27;s guitar parts.

As Barât&#x27;s birthday approached, Doherty organised a special celebration gig in an attempt to smooth the tensions between them. Barât, however, was already attending a party organised by some of his friends, and the hosts convinced him not to leave. Doherty was left to play the gig himself. Feeling betrayed, Doherty neglected to take the train to Germany the next day for the Libertines&#x27; European tour. The Libertines were forced to play without Doherty: a guitar technician learned his guitar parts and several songs were dropped altogether. Soon, however, positions changed and it was Barât who refused to let Doherty into the band unless he cleaned himself up. Doherty continued to play with separate musical project Babyshambles whilst the Libertines completed tour commitments in Japan without him. Distraught and angry, Doherty burgled Barât&#x27;s flat and was subsequently arrested. On 11 August, he pleaded guilty at the preliminary hearing to the charge of burglary.

Amidst the internal turmoil, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back into the Sun&quot; was released on 18 August and charted at No. 11, the highest position they had managed at that point. The Libertines played the Carling Weekend with replacement guitarist Anthony Rossomando (who later joined Dirty Pretty Things). On 7 September, Judge Roger Davies sentenced Doherty to 6 months in prison. He served his sentence in Wandsworth prison. This sentence was later reduced on appeal by Judge Derek Inman to two months.

===Second studio album and the initial break-up of the Libertines (2003–2004)===
Barât was waiting for Doherty at the prison gates when he was released in October 2003. After an emotional reunion they played a gig the same day at the Tap&#x27;n&#x27;Tin pub, in Chatham, Kent – with both Hassall and Powell, who had not been expected to come. The show became &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s Gig of the Year. The Libertines went on to play three consecutive sold-out dates at the London Forum in mid-December 2003, ending in stage invasions by the fans. These gigs would be named amongst the top 100 gigs of all time by &quot;Q&quot; magazine. The Libertines also went on a widely acclaimed UK tour in March 2004 that included three more consecutive sold-out dates in London, this time at Brixton Academy.

Banny Pootschi resigned and was replaced as manager by Alan McGee, previously the founder and MD of Creation Records (most famous for signing Oasis) and later to become manager of Dirty Pretty Things. They continued to play gigs and commenced recording their second album with Bernard Butler. However, the relationship between Doherty and Butler was as unsuccessful as before and the attempts were soon abandoned. In early 2004 the Libertines won Best Band at the NME Awards, despite the fact that &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back into The Sun&quot; was their only official release during the preceding year.

As an aside from the Libertines, Doherty had recorded the vocals for &quot;For Lovers&quot;, a song written by his friend and local poet Peter &quot;Wolfman&quot; Wolfe. &quot;For Lovers&quot; was released on 13 April 2004 and reached No. 7 in the charts, eclipsing the Libertines&#x27; highest charting single to that date. Despite Barât&#x27;s intolerance of Wolfe and the associated drugs, he recorded guitar for the B-side to the single, &quot;Back From the Dead&quot;.

Mick Jones returned as producer for the second attempt to record the second album. Doherty had returned to his drug habit and so relationships were strained. Security hired for the protection of Doherty and Barât had to be used to keep them from fighting. The album was finished and Doherty left the mixing and dubbing to the others; he would not return to the studio with the Libertines for another ten years. On 14 May 2004, he was admitted to The Priory, a high-profile retreat, in an attempt to overcome his addictions. He left early, then returned, only to leave again a week later on 7 June.

During this time, Barât had been setting up a weekly club night called Dirty Pretty Things (a later dispute forced it to be renamed Bright Young Things) at the Infinity Club in the West End. The day Doherty left the Priory for the second time, he went to the club and spoke with Barât, with Hassall and Powell present as well. Doherty told him that he was going to Wat Tham Krabok in Thailand to get clean. The Libertines performed a short set that night: it was the last time they would all play together for more than six years, and the last time Doherty would speak to Barât for more than nine months.

The Libertines did not let Doherty play with them but promised that &quot;when he cleans up his addictions he will be immediately welcomed back into the band.&quot; However, Doherty had managed to achieve growing success and fame with his new venture, Babyshambles, which further reduced the likelihood of reconciliation.

Meanwhile, the Libertines were still releasing fresh material. The new single &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Me Now&quot;, which detailed the breakdown of the ailing frontmen&#x27;s once seemingly cast iron friendship while illustrating the love-hate relationship between Doherty and Barât, was released on 9 August and charted at No. 2. The song included Doherty asking the question: &#x27;Have we enough to keep it together?&#x27; Their eponymous second album, &quot;The Libertines&quot; was released in late August and topped the albums chart. Their final single &quot;What Became of the Likely Lads&quot; reached No. 9.

The Libertines played what would be their final show for over five years in Paris on 17 December 2004, still without Doherty. Barât chose to then dissolve the Libertines as he was no longer willing to tour and record under the name without Doherty.

===Reunion (2010)===
Doherty and Barât remained out of contact for several months after the Libertines had ended, due to Doherty&#x27;s spiralling drug abuse. Members of the band reunited several times on stage through the years to play Libertines songs, but talks of a reunion remained tepid as Doherty and Barât concentrated on their respective bands Babyshambles and Dirty Pretty Things. A retrospective collection &quot;Time for Heroes - The Best of The Libertines&quot; was released in 2007.

It wouldn&#x27;t be until 2010, when it was announced on 29 March, that the Libertines were to reform for the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2010. They were special guests to headliners Arcade Fire on Friday 27 August at Bramham Park, Leeds and Saturday 28 August at Little John&#x27;s Farm, Reading. Following the announcement, the band held a press conference on 31 March 2010 to discuss their reformation at the Boogaloo pub. The press conference then turned into an impromptu &quot;guerilla gig&quot; with the band playing many of their old tunes. The Reading and Leeds festival appearances were preluded by 2 nights at the HMV Forum. A 300-strong rehearsal gig for friends, family and some members of the musical press on Tuesday 24 August 2010 and a sold-out fans-only show on Wednesday 25 August.

Doherty promised the Libertines&#x27; special guest performance at Reading and Leeds Festivals would be to be remembered. The performance at the festival received very positive reviews from both fans and the press. After the gigs at the Reading and Leeds festival, it remained unclear as to what the Libertines would do next as both Carl Barât and Pete Doherty were embarking on solo tours. There were hints of more Libertines gigs in the future which both Barât and Doherty confirming they have received offers for gigs at some point in 2011. However, an interview with Carl Barât in May 2011 for NME magazine suggested the band did not have any current plans for future activities together.

In 2012, for the 2012 NME Awards, Barât stated, &quot;I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll do Libertines or something at some point.&quot; However, the Libertines still had no plans to reunite. In the same interview, Barât said that for the majority of 2012 he would be focusing on acting, making the possibility of a reunion unlikely. Also in 2012, Doherty said that the Libertines definitely have a future as a band.

===Reformation and &quot;Anthems for Doomed Youth&quot; (2014–present)===

On 20 April 2014, an image of London&#x27;s Hyde Park was released to the band&#x27;s Facebook page. Around this time, both Carl Barât and Peter Doherty indicated in interviews that they had accepted an offer to play the venue on 5 July 2014. On 25 April, it was confirmed that the Libertines would play on Saturday 5 July in London&#x27;s Hyde Park, headlining the day, as part of the Barclaycard British Summer Time series of concerts. Support for the concert was to be provided by a number of bands and artists, most notably the Pogues, Spiritualized, Maxïmo Park, Raglans and the Enemy. At their 5 July Hyde Park gig, they announced three new gigs, taking place in Alexandra Palace, on 26, 27 and 28 September.

In January 2015, it was announced that Doherty had successfully completed his rehab treatment at the Hope Rehab Centre in Thailand, and had joined his bandmates in the recording of their third studio album. In January 2015 it was also revealed that the Libertines would be headlining the festival T in the Park in Scotland. In February 2015, it was announced that the Libertines would be headlining Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2015. In May 2015, it was announced that the Libertines would be headlining Corona Capital Music Festival in Mexico City. In June 2015, Carl Barât shared an image of the band in Thailand with the caption, &#x27;Kitchen sink dramas over track listings&#x27;, suggesting that the album was now complete.

In June, the band also announced that the first single off the new album would be &quot;Gunga Din&quot;, which they also debuted live at Best Kept Secret headline show, Hilvarenbeek On 26 June 2015, the Libertines were the surprise special guests on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury 2015, and were joined by special guest Ed Harcourt. On 2 July 2015, the Libertines announced their 3rd album, named &quot;Anthems for Doomed Youth&quot;, to be released on 4 September 2015. The release date was later delayed by a week to accommodate the demand for their album launch events, &quot;Somewhere Over the Railings&quot;. The album was released on 11 September 2015.

The Libertines&#x27; Anthems for Doomed Youth UK arena tour in January 2016 was supported by Blossoms, the View, Sleaford Mods, the Enemy, Reverend &amp; the Makers, the Sherlocks and Jack Jones of Trampolene.

In 2017, the Libertines started off their concert at Prenton Park by allowing Labour Party leader and candidate for Prime Minister, Jeremy Corbyn to deliver a speech in the run up to the 2017 United Kingdom general election. In 2019, the Libertines announced their &quot;On the Road to the Wasteland&quot; tour. The tour included a nine-date Christmas jaunt across the UK in December, along with shows in France, Germany, Luxembourg, Brussels and the Netherlands in October and November.

The Libertines opened The Glastonbury Festival in 2022 and celebrated the 20th anniversary of Up The Bracket&#x27;s release with a deluxe edition featuring live and early recordings. On 13 October 2023 the band released their first single in eight years, as well as announcing that their new album, &quot;All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade&quot;. To celebrate the announcement of the new album the band announced &quot;The Albionay Tour&quot;, an intimate club tour that sold out in seconds.

===&quot;All Quiet On The Eastern Esplanade &quot; (2024–present)===

The Libertines released their fourth studio album, &quot;All Quiet On The Eastern Esplanade, &quot;on 5 April 2024. The album reached Number One on the UK album charts. The band’s only other time reaching peak position was in 2004, with their eponymous sophomore album, &quot;The Libertines&quot;.

In support of the album, The Libertines embarked on a sold-out UK tour in late 2024. This tour features a mix of new tracks from All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade alongside fan favorites from their earlier work. The Libertines are set to continue touring with a series of European dates in early 2025. On 5 November 2024 The Libertines announced three major outdoor shows for summer 2025. The tour includes performances at Dreamland in Margate on 5 July, the historic Piece Hall in Halifax on 8 August and Gunnersbury Park in London on 9 August. 
==Musical style and legacy==
The Libertines have been characterized as indie rock, garage rock revival and post-punk revival with punk rock influences. Lead singers and guitarists Doherty and Barât had different influences musically. Doherty was inspired by bands such as (principally) the Jam, Sex Pistols, the Smiths, and Chas &amp; Dave. Doherty has expressed &quot;Still Ill&quot; by the Smiths as a song that means a lot to him, in an interview. Barât admired the Velvet Underground, the Clash, the Doors, Django Reinhardt and Nirvana. Doherty liked the written works of William Blake, Emily Dickinson and Thomas Chatterton, whereas Barât preferred Saki and the Edwardian idea of wit.

On their collective sound, Doherty commented, &quot;It&#x27;s like they say: Oasis is the sound of a council estate singing its heart out, and the Libertines is the sound of someone just put in the rubbish chute at the back of the estate, trying to work out what day it was&quot;.

Doherty and Barât followed one common dream whilst in the Libertines: &quot;It&#x27;s either to the top of the world, or the bottom of a canal&quot;, Barât once said this phrase to Doherty in the early days of their friendship.

The Libertines&#x27; lyrics occasionally reference their idea of sailing on &quot;the good ship Albion to Arcadia&quot;. This idea was especially important to Doherty who has continued the theme when writing for Babyshambles. He thinks of Arcadia as a utopia without any rules or authority.

Their recordings were fairly lo-fi. Mick Jones&#x27; recording method was hands-off: he allowed the band to perform one song several times through and would then choose the best take. He performed minimal audio mixing and dubbing. While Bernard Butler was less strict with this, the final sound still came across as raw and unpolished.

The band has been compared to many classic British rock bands, as their angle on rock is uniquely British. Their sound is often likened to that of the Jam and the Kinks&#x27; early records as well as the Clash&#x27;s first album and early singles. They are perhaps most similar to pioneer rockers, Buzzcocks. Morrissey is another strong influence cited by the band members. Many of their lyrics refer to elements of British life, use English/cockney slang and are sung in a near-drunken sounding slur. In their attitude they are sometimes compared to the Sex Pistols due to their chaotic and energetic live performances.

The Libertines were praised for forming a very close relationship with fans. The band befriended several of their fans, and their Guerrilla gigs allowed devoted supporters to see them in close proximity. The film &quot;Fuck the Police&quot;, shot in 2003 by Anne McCloy, captured one such gig at The Albion Rooms when the police raided and closed down an impromptu gig after complaints by irate neighbours. Doherty published the &quot;Books of Albion&quot; online, sharing his personal thoughts and feelings freely. He also frequently posted on the fan forums. This allowed fans a deep insight into his life and helped cement the relationship between the band and the public. They were also very free with their recordings, releasing songs free onto the internet and via word-of-mouth giveaways. This allowed their fan base to hear unfinished songs or ideas, some of which would grow into finished versions on the albums, some of which would be discarded.

The Libertines have had two biographies written about them, both written after the band split. The first was &quot;Kids in the Riot: High and Low with The Libertines&quot; written by Peter Welsh, a friend. The second was &quot;The Libertines Bound Together: The Story of Peter Doherty and Carl Barât and How They Changed British Music&quot; written by Anthony Thornton and Roger Sargent, an &quot;NME&quot; journalist and photographer respectively who had followed the band from an early stage.

The Libertines have had a lasting effect on the British music scene. The image of Doherty and Barât entwined, Barât looking up protectively as his friend leans into his shoulder, on the front of their second album, has been called by Anthony Thornton &quot;one of the most iconic rock images of the last decade&quot;.

===&quot;The Libertines: Bound Together&quot;===
Writer Anthony Thornton and photographer Roger Sargent collaborated on a best-selling book about the band. &quot;The Libertines: Bound Together&quot; was first published in hardback on 23 February 2006 by Time Warner Books. &quot;Bound Together&quot; documents, in words and pictures, the band&#x27;s existence from early conception to the various bands spawned from the Libertines&#x27; demise. This book contains over 100 images of the Libertines, dozens of which were previously unpublished. The book was critically well-received with both Mojo and Q giving it four stars. It got to number seven in the Sunday Times Best Seller Non-Fiction on the week of release.

The book was released as an e-book for the first time on 23 May 2013, for iPad, Kindle, Kindle Fire, Kobo and other devices.

===&quot;There Are No Innocent Bystanders&quot;===
Longtime collaborator Roger Sargent directed a feature-length documentary on the band&#x27;s 2010 reunion, that was released in Spring 2012. &quot;The Libertines: There Are No Innocent Bystanders&quot; offers an account of the band&#x27;s 2010 Reading and Leeds Festival shows, including Sargent&#x27;s &quot;NME&quot; cover shoot announcing the festival appearances, rehearsals and warm-up shows, and their festival stage appearances.

Sargent was the Libertines&#x27; photographer from their first live show, and has been responsible for many of their now iconic images, most recently winning acclaim for two major exhibitions, The Libertines – Boys in the Band and Future Legends. The film is purported to include some of the over 10,000 unseen stills that chart the band throughout their career.

The film is produced by Pulse Films and had its World Premiere at East End Film Festival in April 2011. The film toured UK O2 Academy venues in March 2012, which was followed by a limited theatrical release in the UK and a DVD release.

==Relationship between Barât and Doherty==
Roger Sargent (a close friend and photographer of the band) described their relationship as like &quot;first love, and all the jealousy and obsessiveness that comes with that&quot; – adding &quot;I think there&#x27;s, y&#x27;know, obsession and jealousy on both of their sides. They bitch about each other to each other or to other people. They have a bond, intellectually and spiritually, like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen ... but sometimes, you know, you just think, God, why don&#x27;t you just get a room?!&quot; In the same interview, a Radio One documentary, upon being asked just how close their relationship was, Doherty responded &quot;I love him. Wouldn&#x27;t go, um – certainly not on Radio 1 – go into too much detail, but... we had lots of wonderful times together, yeah.&quot; Barât, when questioned similarly, steadfastly denied that the relationship had involved anything &quot;physical&quot;. Barât has insisted that &quot;people are really into conjecture&quot;, however in a 2011 interview when asked if the two had ever had a physical relationship, he replied &quot;There have been moments in our relationship where physicality has ensued.&quot;

The volatility and ardency of Barât&#x27;s relationship with Doherty formed a significant, if not essential, aspect of their music and live performances. Doherty frequently posted about Barât on the Libertines forum; in one post from 2003, referring to an incident in 1997 in which Barât had wanted to form a suicide pact, Doherty wrote: &quot;let&#x27;s keep going i love you i love you so much.&quot; Speaking of his separation from Doherty in 2004, Barât revealed, &quot;There was one point where I very very nearly, just to be close to him, started taking full on heroin.&quot;

In a March 2009 interview with NME Radio, when discussing a potential Libertines reunion, Doherty revealed, &quot;He [Carl] was saying, &#x27;Well, look, what if it&#x27;s all gonna happen again?&#x27; and I said, &#x27;One thing: maybe it will, maybe it won&#x27;t, but one thing that&#x27;s going to help me &quot;not&quot; fuck up again is &quot;you&quot;, and doing all that together.&#x27; Because he means a lot...&quot; Referring to their relationship in a January 2010 interview, Barât said: &quot;...it&#x27;s a deep love. Deep love does funny things to people&quot;.

In a February 2024 interview with The Guardian, Doherty said, &quot;Maybe I’m not thinking it when I write the song, but the first thing I think afterwards is, ‘I wonder what Carl will think of that?’, whoever I’m writing the song with. The honest answer is, everything I write is for Carl.”
