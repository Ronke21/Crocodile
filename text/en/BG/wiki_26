<text>Episiotomy, also known as perineotomy, is a surgical incision of the perineum and the posterior vaginal wall generally done by an obstetrician. This is usually performed during the second stage of labor to quickly enlarge the aperture, allowing the baby to pass through. The incision, which can be done from the posterior midline of the vulva straight toward the anus or at an angle to the right or left (medio-lateral episiotomy), is performed under local anesthetic (pudendal anesthesia), and is sutured after delivery.
Its routine use is no longer recommended, as perineal massage applied to the vaginal opening, is an alternative to enlarge the orifice for the baby. It was once one of the most common surgical procedures specific to women. In the United States, as of 2012, it was performed in 12% of vaginal births. It is also widely practiced in many parts of the world, including Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China, and Spain in the early 2000s.

== Uses ==
Vaginal tears can occur during childbirth, most often at the introitus as the baby&#x27;s head passes through, especially if the baby descends quickly. Episiotomies are used in an effort to prevent soft-tissue tearing (perineal tear) which may involve the anal sphincter and rectum. Tears can involve the perineal skin or extend to the muscles and the anal sphincter and anus. The midwife or obstetrician may decide to make a surgical cut to the perineum with scissors or a scalpel to make the baby&#x27;s birth easier and prevent severe injuries that can be difficult to repair. The cut is repaired with stitches (sutures). Some childbirth facilities have a policy of routine episiotomy.

Specific reasons to do an episiotomy are unclear. Though indications on the need for episiotomy vary and may even be controversial (see discussion below), where the technique is applied, there are two main variations. Both are depicted in the above image.
* In one variation, the midline episiotomy, the line of incision is central over the anus. This technique bifurcates the perineal body, which is essential for the integrity of the pelvic floor. Precipitous birth can also sever—and more severely sever—the perineal body, leading to long-term complications such as incontinence. Therefore, the oblique technique is often applied (also pictured above).
* In the oblique technique, the perineal body is avoided, cutting only the vagina epithelium, skin, and muscles (transversalius and bulbospongiosus). This technique aids in avoiding trauma to the perineal body by either surgical or traumatic means.

In 2009, a Cochrane meta-analysis based on studies with over 5,000 women concluded that: &quot;Restrictive episiotomy policies appear to have a number of benefits compared to policies based on routine episiotomy. There is less posterior perineal trauma, less suturing and fewer complications, no difference for most pain measures and severe vaginal or perineal trauma, but there was an increased risk of anterior perineal trauma with restrictive episiotomy&quot;. The authors were unable to find quality studies that compared mediolateral versus midline episiotomy.

== Types ==

There are four main types of episiotomy:
* Medio-lateral: The incision is made downward and outward from the midpoint of the fourchette either to the right or left. It is directed diagonally in a straight line which runs about away from the anus (midpoint between the anus and the ischial tuberosity).
* Median: The incision commences from the centre of the fourchette and extends on the posterior side along the midline for .
* Lateral: The incision starts from about away from the centre of the fourchette and extends laterally. Drawbacks include the chance of injury to the Bartholin&#x27;s duct, therefore some practitioners have strongly discouraged lateral incisions.
* &quot;J&quot;-shaped: The incision begins in the centre of the fourchette and is directed posteriorly along the midline for about and then directed downwards and outwards along the 5 or 7 o&#x27;clock position to avoid the internal and external anal sphincter. This procedure is also not widely practised.

== Controversy ==

Traditionally, physicians have used episiotomies in an effort to deflect the cut in the perineal skin away from the anal sphincter muscle, as control over stool (faeces) is an important function of the anal sphincter, i.e. lessen perineal trauma, minimize postpartum pelvic floor dysfunction, and as muscles have a good blood supply, by avoiding damaging the anal sphincter muscle, reduce the loss of blood during delivery, and protect against neonatal trauma. While episiotomy is employed to obviate issues such as post-partum pain, incontinence, and sexual dysfunction, some studies suggest that episiotomy surgery itself can cause all of these problems, the episiotomy and wound can continue as a tear and damage the ring of muscle around the lower part of the large bowel , the anal sphincter. Research has shown that natural tears typically are less severe (although this is perhaps surprising since an episiotomy is designed for when natural tearing will cause significant risks or trauma). Slow delivery of the head in between contractions will result in the least perineal damage. Studies in 2010 based on interviews with postpartum women have concluded that limiting perineal trauma during birth is conducive to continued sexual function after birth. At least one study has recommended that routine episiotomy be abandoned for this reason.

In various countries, routine episiotomy has been an accepted medical practice for many years. Since about the 1960s, routine episiotomies have been rapidly losing popularity among obstetricians and midwives in almost all countries in Europe, Australia, Canada, and the United States. A nationwide U.S. population study suggested that 31% of women having babies in U.S. hospitals received episiotomies in 1997, compared with 56% in 1979. In Latin America, it remains popular and is performed in 90% of hospital births.

=== Discussion ===
Having an episiotomy may increase perineal pain during postpartum recovery, resulting in trouble defecating, particularly in midline episiotomies. In addition, it may complicate sexual intercourse by making it painful and replacing erectile tissues in the vulva with scar tissue.

In cases where an episiotomy is indicated, a mediolateral incision may be preferable to a median (midline) incision, as the latter is associated with a higher risk of injury to the anal sphincter and the rectum. Damage to the anal sphincter caused by episiotomy can result in fecal incontinence (loss of control over defecation). Conversely, one of the reasons episiotomy is performed is to prevent tearing of the anal sphincter, which is also associated with fecal incontinence.

=== Impacts on sexual intercourse ===

Some midwives compare routine episiotomy to female genital mutilation. One study found that women who underwent episiotomy reported more painful intercourse and insufficient lubrication 12–18 months after birth but did not find any problems with orgasm or arousal.

==Pain management==

Perineal pain after episiotomy has immediate and long-term negative effects on women and their babies. These effects can interfere with breastfeeding and the care of the infant. The pain from injection sites and episiotomy is managed by the frequent assessment of the report of pain from the mother. Pain can come from possible lacerations, incisions, uterine contractions and sore nipples. Appropriate medications are usually administered. Nonpharmacologic interventions can also be used: a warm salt bath increases blood flow to the area, decreases local discomfort, and promotes healing. Routine episiotomies have not been found to reduce the level of pain after the birth.

<doc id="311366" wikidata="Q467321" url="?curid=311366" title="American wire gauge">
<text>American Wire Gauge (AWG) is a logarithmic stepped standardized wire gauge system used since 1857, predominantly in North America, for the diameters of round, solid, nonferrous, electrically conducting wire. Dimensions of the wires are given in ASTM standard B 258. The cross-sectional area of each gauge is an important factor for determining its current-carrying capacity.

== Origin ==
The AWG originated in the number of drawing operations used to produce a given gauge of wire. Very fine wire (for example, 30 gauge) required more passes through the drawing dies than 0 gauge wire did. Manufacturers of wire formerly had proprietary wire gauge systems; the development of standardized wire gauges rationalized selection of wire for a particular purpose.

While the AWG is essentially identical to the Brown &amp; Sharpe (B&amp;S) sheet metal gauge, the B&amp;S gauge was designed for use with sheet metals as its name suggests. These are functionally interchangeable but the use of B&amp;S in relation to wire gauges, rather than sheet metal gauges, is technically improper.

== Specifications ==
Increasing gauge numbers denote logarithmically decreasing wire diameters, which is similar to many other non-metric gauging systems such as British Standard Wire Gauge (SWG). However, AWG is dissimilar to IEC 60228, the metric wire-size standard used in most parts of the world, based directly on the wire cross-section area (in square millimetres, mm2). 

The AWG tables are for a single, solid and round conductor. The AWG of a stranded wire is determined by the cross-sectional area of the equivalent solid conductor. Because there are also small gaps between the strands, a stranded wire will always have a slightly larger overall diameter than a solid wire with the same AWG.

=== Formulae ===
By definition, 36 AWG is 0.005 inches in diameter, and 0000 AWG is 0.46 inches in diameter. The ratio of these diameters is 1:92, and there are 40 gauge sizes from 36 to 0000, or 39 steps. Because each successive gauge number increases cross sectional area by a constant multiple, diameters vary geometrically. Any two successive gauges (e.g., and ) have diameters whose ratio is formula_1 (approximately 1.12293), while for gauges two steps apart (e.g., , , and ), the ratio of the to is about 1.122932 ≈ 1.26098. Similarly for gauges &quot;n&quot; steps apart the ratio of the first to last gauges is about 1.12293&quot;n&quot;.

The diameter of an AWG wire is determined according to the following formula:
:formula_2

(where is the AWG size for gauges from 36 to 0, for 00, for 000, and for 0000. See below for rule.)

or equivalently:
:formula_3

The gauge can be calculated from the diameter using 
:formula_4

and the cross-section area is
:formula_5.

The standard ASTM B258-02 (2008), &quot;Standard Specification for Standard Nominal Diameters and Cross-Sectional Areas of AWG Sizes of Solid Round Wires Used as Electrical Conductors&quot;, defines the ratio between successive sizes to be the 39th root of 92, or approximately 1.1229322. ASTM B258-02 also dictates that wire diameters should be tabulated with no more than 4 significant figures, with a resolution of no more than 0.0001 inches (0.1 mils) for wires thicker than 44 AWG, and 0.00001 inches (0.01 mils) for wires 45 AWG and thinner.

Sizes with multiple zeros are successively thicker than 0 AWG and can be denoted using &quot;&quot;number of zeros&quot;/0&quot;, for example 4/0 AWG for 0000 AWG. For an /0AWG wire, use in the above formulas. For instance, for 0000 AWG or 4/0 AWG, use .

==== Rules of thumb ====
The sixth power of is very close to 2, which leads to the following rules of thumb:
* When the &quot;cross-sectional area&quot; of a wire is doubled, the AWG will decrease by 3. (E.g. two 14 AWG wires have about the same cross-sectional area as a single 11 AWG wire.) This doubles the conductance.
* When the &quot;diameter&quot; of a solid round wire is doubled, the AWG will decrease by 6. (E.g. 1 mm diameter wire is ≈18 AWG, 2 mm diameter wire is ≈12 AWG, and 4 mm diameter wire is ≈6 AWG.) This quadruples the cross-sectional area and conductance.
* A decrease of ten gauge numbers (E.g. from 24 AWG to 14 AWG) multiplies the area, weight, and conductance by approximately 10.
Convenient coincidences result in the following rules of thumb for resistances:
* The resistance of copper wire is approximately for 10 AWG, for 20 AWG, for 30 AWG, and so on. For an arbitrary gauge &quot;n&quot;, it&#x27;s approximately 10&quot;n&quot;/10 Ω per .
* Because aluminum wire has a conductivity of approximately 61% of copper, an aluminum wire has nearly the same resistance as a copper wire that is two sizes smaller, which has 62.9% of the area.

===Tables of AWG wire sizes===
The table below shows various data including both the resistance of the various wire gauges and the allowable current (ampacity) based on a copper conductor with plastic insulation. The diameter information in the table applies to &quot;solid&quot; wires. Stranded wires are calculated by calculating the equivalent cross sectional copper area. Fusing current (melting wire) is estimated based on ambient temperature. The table below assumes DC, or AC frequencies equal to or less than 60 Hz, and does not take skin effect into account. &quot;Turns of wire per unit length&quot; is the reciprocal of the conductor diameter; it is therefore an upper limit for wire wound in the form of a helix (see solenoid), based on uninsulated wire.


In the North American electrical industry, conductors thicker than 4/0AWG are generally identified by the area in thousands of circular mils (kcmil), where 1 kcmil = 0.5067 mm2. The next wire size thicker than 4/0 has a cross section of 250 kcmil. A &quot;circular mil&quot; is the area of a wire one mil in diameter. One million circular mils is the area of a circle with 1,000 mil (1 inch) diameter. An older abbreviation for one thousand circular mils is &quot;MCM&quot;.

===Stranded wire AWG sizes===
AWG can also be used to describe stranded wire. The AWG of a stranded wire represents the sum of the cross-sectional diameter of the individual strands; the gaps between strands are not counted. When made with circular strands, these gaps occupy about 25% of the wire area, thus requiring the overall bundle diameter to be about 13% larger than a solid wire of equal gauge.

Stranded wires are specified with three numbers, the overall AWG size, the number of strands, and the AWG size of a strand. The number of strands and the AWG of a strand are separated by a slash. For example, a 22AWG 7/30 stranded wire is a 22AWG wire made from seven strands of 30AWG wire.

As indicated in the Formulas and Rules of Thumb sections above, differences in AWG translate directly into ratios of diameter or area. This property can be employed to easily find the AWG of a stranded bundle by measuring the diameter and count of its strands. (This only applies to bundles with circular strands of identical size.) To find the AWG of 7-strand wire with equal strands, subtract 8.4 from the AWG of a strand. Similarly, for 19-strand subtract 12.7, and for 37 subtract 15.6.

Measuring strand diameter is often easier and more accurate than attempting to measure bundle diameter and packing ratio. Such measurement can be done with a wire gauge go-no-go tool or with a caliper or micrometer.

==Nomenclature and abbreviations in electrical distribution==

Alternative ways are commonly used in the electrical industry to specify wire sizes as AWG.
* 4 AWG (proper)
** #4 (the number sign is used as an abbreviation of &quot;number&quot;)
** № 4 (the numero sign is used as an abbreviation for &quot;number&quot;)
** No. 4 (an approximation of the numero is used as an abbreviation for &quot;number&quot;)
** No. 4 AWG
** 4 ga. (abbreviation for &quot;gauge&quot;)
* 000 AWG (proper for thick sizes)
** 3/0 (common for thick sizes) Pronounced &quot;three-aught&quot; or &quot;triple-aught&quot;
** 3/0 AWG
** #000

===Pronunciation===
&quot;AWG&quot; is colloquially referred to as &quot;gauge&quot; and the zeros in thick wire sizes are referred to as &quot;aught&quot; . Wire sized 1 AWG is referred to as &quot;one gauge&quot; or &quot;No. 1&quot; wire; similarly, thinner sizes are pronounced &quot; gauge&quot; or &quot;No. &quot; wire, where is the positive-integer AWG number. Consecutive AWG wire sizes thicker than No. 1 wire are designated by the number of zeros:
* No. 0, often written 1/0 and referred to as &quot;one-aught&quot; or &quot;single-aught&quot; wire
* No. 00, often written 2/0 and referred to as &quot;two-aught&quot; or &quot;double-aught&quot; wire
* No. 000, often written 3/0 and referred to as &quot;three-aught&quot; or &quot;triple-aught&quot; wire
and so on.

<doc id="311379" wikidata="Q553358" url="?curid=311379" title="Mehdi Ghezali">
<text>Mehdi Mohammad Ghezali (; born 5 July 1979), in media previously known as the Cuban-Swede (), is a Swedish citizen of Algerian and Finnish descent who was held in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detainment camp in Cuba between January 2002 and July 2004. Ghezali claimed to have been &quot;physically and mentally tortured&quot; at Guantanamo.

Prior to his capture, Ghezali attended a Muslim religious school and mosque in the United Kingdom before travelling to Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and finally ended up in Pakistan where he was captured. Following his release from detention the Swedish government dropped all charges against him for criminal misconduct prior to his capture.

In December 2002, Pakistan withdrew all charges against Ghezali in connection with his arrest at the Afghan border. Pakistan suspected him of having participated in a prison uprising in Pakistan where 17 people (including seven prison guards) were killed. Ghezali denied having any knowledge of or participation in the prison uprising.

A man bearing Ghezali&#x27;s passport was one of twelve foreigners Pakistani security officials reported were captured trying to cross into Afghanistan on 28 August 2009. According to the &quot;Associated Press&quot; Ghezali was &quot;reportedly part of a group of 156 suspected al-Qaeda fighters caught while fleeing Afghanistan&#x27;s Tora Bora mountains.&quot; Ghezali denied any links to al-Qaeda.

In July 2012, a day after the Burgas bus bombing Bulgarian media reported that Ghezali was the suicide bomber. Swedish and Bulgarian officials denied that he was involved in any way and investigators ruled him out as a suspect within 48 hours. Ghezali was featured in the documentary &quot;Gitmo – The New Rules of War&quot;.

==Early life and travel==
Mehdi Ghezali was born in Botkyrka, Stockholm, on 5 July 1979 and grew up in Örebro, the son of an Algerian and a Finnish woman.
He finished secondary studies in 1999 and trained as a welder. He was suspected of theft the same year, but left the country and could not be questioned by the Swedish police. When police officers visited Ghezali&#x27;s father he stated that Ghezali had left for Algeria in order to complete his military service; however, Ghezali had traveled to Portugal, supposedly to pursue a career as a football player. Ghezali was apprehended by the Portuguese police in the Algarve region of Portugal on 31 July 1999 for a suspected bank robbery and a jewelry theft together with his partner Stavros Christos Toilos. The bank robbery in Albufeira netted 600,000 euros while the jewelry theft in Playa de la Galé netted 5,000 euros.
Ghezali and his partner were released from prison on 12 June 2000 after having spent 10 months in a Portuguese prison without being charged, and returned to Sweden.

Ghezali then traveled to Medina in Saudi Arabia to study at the university. 
However, he was not accepted and returned to Sweden in March or April 2001 for a brief period before travelling to London where he studied at the madrasah of the Muslim cleric Omar Bakri. 
He then travelled to Pakistan in the summer of 2001 in order to study at one of the madrasahs situated there. 
After failing to gain acceptance into any of the madrasahs, he then travelled to Afghanistan, where he, according to his own statements, stayed with a family in Jalalabad. Ghezali stated that: &quot;I lived a simple life, playing with the children and seeing how Afghans lived.&quot; &quot;Sweden&#x27;s security police chief, Jan Danielsson, described Ghezali more as a confused youth traveling the world looking for spiritual fulfillment rather than a terrorist. &#x27;We have no information that indicates he&#x27;s an al-Qaeda member, much less that he held a leading position,&#x27; Danielsson said in an interview.&quot;

==Capture and detention==
After the U.S. military, together with the Afghan Northern Alliance, initiated a bombing campaign on the Tora Bora mountains, a large number of al-Qaeda sympathisers and others in the affected areas fled southward to Pakistan. Mehdi Ghezali was captured by local warlords in Pakistan in the Tora Bora mountains which are close to the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and then handed over to the U.S. Armed Forces which transported him to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base on Cuba where Ghezali was held at Guantanamo Bay detainment camp.

In December 2002, Pakistan withdrew all charges against Ghezali in connection with his arrest at the Afghan border. Pakistan suspected him of having participated in a prison uprising in Pakistan, where 17 people (including seven prison guards) were killed. When questioned about the prison uprising at the press conference following his release Ghezali denied having any knowledge of or participation in the prison uprising.

During his stay at Guantanamo Bay, Ghezali was visited by representatives of the Swedish government (February 2002, January and July 2003 and January 2004) and was informed that he had been assigned an attorney in Sweden (Peter Althin) and that his case had been brought up in inter-governmental contacts and had been featured on several occasions in the Swedish media. Ghezali supposedly refused to discuss what he was doing in Afghanistan and Pakistan with the agents of the Swedish government.

On 15 May 2006, the United States Department of Defense released a list of all the individuals who had been held in military custody in their Guantanamo Bay detainment camps. That list gave Ghezali&#x27;s Guantanamo detainee ID as 166.
The DoD listed his place of birth as Stockholm.

==Release==
After being held as an enemy combatant for 930 days, Ghezali was released into the custody of the Swedish government on 8 July 2004 since he was no longer considered a threat to the United States, since he had no information that was of interest to the American Intelligence Service and since he had not committed a crime which could be proven in a military court. 
Ghezali was transported home by the Swedish Air Force on a Gulfstream IV jet, at the expense of the Swedish government (estimated at 500 000 – 600 000 Swedish kronor).

Initially, Swedish prosecutors stated that they would press charges against him for crimes committed prior to Ghezali&#x27;s departure from Sweden, but they were subsequently dropped. There were also threats made against Ghezali, it was perceived that the Swedish government had given Ghezali too much help.

Ghezali was the subject of the English-language documentary &quot;Gitmo - The New Rules of War&quot;. A film about the Guantanamo Bay detention camp by film director Erik Gandini and Tarik Saleh.

An article in the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, published four months after Ghezali&#x27;s release from Guantanamo, said he was being &quot;monitored by Swedish intelligence agents&quot;. The article also said that Swedish security agents have said Ghezali is not a threat. 
Ghezali has stated in his book that he feels he is being intensely monitored by the Swedish Security Service (SÄPO), both in his home and when he moves around. He claims that the surveillance has caused him to feel depressed.

==Statements after release==
After his release Ghezali criticized the Swedish government for not helping him sufficiently and denied having been told that he was assigned an attorney or being informed of actions taken on his behalf by the Swedish government, however this was refuted by the Swedish foreign ministry which had documented their meetings with Ghezali. It has been suggested by a psychologist that Ghezali&#x27;s recollection of events might have been affected by the stress of capture and detention.
Ghezali has also made statements describing his stay at the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp. He claims to have been subject to torture such as sleep deprivation and made to sit in an interrogation room for thirteen hours in a row. He is planning a class-action lawsuit against the USA. He has together with Gösta Hultén published a book, &quot;Fånge På Guantánamo: Mehdi Ghezali berättar&quot; (&quot;Prisoner on Guantanamo: Mehdi Ghezali tells his story&quot;) , in which he chronicles his experiences.

==Activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan==
Ghezali says that he was in Afghanistan on September 11, 2001, living with a normal family in Jalalabad. &quot;I lived a simple life, playing with the children and seeing how Afghans lived.&quot; He also said that he had no contact with al-Qaeda.

At a press conference following his return to Sweden, Ghezali said the following about the al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden:

==Subsequent appearances==
On 4 July 2006, Ghezali made his first public appearance since his release at a demonstration held outside the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm, Sweden. Ghezali and approximately 60 others called for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay facility. Ghezali, who declined to answer any questions from reporters, and the other demonstrators also appeared in support of Oussama Kassir, the Swedish citizen at the time being held in the Czech Republic for alleged involvement with al-Qaeda.

==Lawsuit dropped==
Ghezali is reported to have dropped his suit against the US government.
According to &quot;The Muslim News&quot;: &quot;The Swede eventually found a [U.S.] firm willing to take the case on, but it dropped out shortly before the deadline for bringing a case expired.&quot;

==2009 arrest and release in Pakistan==
On 10 September 2009, the Swedish television programme &quot;Rapport&quot; reported that Ghezali was among a group of twelve foreign citizens who had been arrested one week earlier in the Dera Ghazi Khan District in Punjab, Pakistan, on suspicions of having ties to al-Qaeda.
Pakistani security officials reported the 12 men were captured on 28 August 2009.

Among the twelve arrested men, three (including Ghezali) were Swedish, seven were Turkish, one was Russian and another one was an Iranian citizen. According to the Pakistani police chief Mohammad Rizwan, the individuals were arrested when they were trying to sneak into the Punjab province through a checkpoint. According to Rizwan, the police had found CDs, exchange money and literature which all indicated links to terrorist activity. Following their arrest, Ghezali and the two other Swedish citizens were moved to Islamabad. 
Rizwan described Ghezali as &quot;&quot;a very dangerous man&quot;.&quot;

Ghezali&#x27;s attorney, Anton Strand response to the news that Ghezali was reported to have been captured was: &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m surprised by it. One should remember that Ghezali has traveled in that region previously and he has an interest in the region. He is religious and has friends and contacts.&quot;

Swedish newspaper, &quot;The Local&quot; quoted Gösta Hultén, the author of a book on Ghezali, who said that Ghezali&#x27;s father believed he was on a religious pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. 
He reported that Ghezali had called from Saudi Arabia &quot;a few days ago&quot;—which would be about a week after Pakistani authorities reported the ten men were captured. According to Hultén: &quot;The father is very upset about the allegations that Mehdi has ties to al-Qaeda. He has already been cleared from those suspicions once.&quot;

On 13 September 2009, Swedish officials confirmed that Pakistan had 
apprehended three Swedish citizens.
But they declined to comment further on their identity.

On 16 September 2009, two of Ghezali&#x27;s traveling companions were identified.
He was reported to have been captured with &quot;28-year-old Munir Awad and 19-year-old Safia Benaouda, and their two and a half-year-old boy.&quot; The most recent allegations state the four Swedes were traveling to Miranshah in Waziristan, to meet Zahir Noor, alleged to be a Taliban leader.

Ghezali is reported to have explained that the group were traveling to Lahore to participate in what Swedish newspaper &quot;The Local&quot; described as &quot;a harmless meeting with a Muslim revivalist movement, Tablighi Jamaat.&quot;

The Swedes were released on 10 October 2009.
They were placed on a plane to Sweden at 800 GMT.
Rehman Malik Pakistan&#x27;s Minister of the Interior had told Swedish diplomats on 6 October 2009 that he would be receiving a formal report on the Swedes on 7 October 2009, and that he would make a decision about their continued detention at that point.
Swedish paper &quot;The Local&quot; reported one additional anonymous allegation, that the group &quot;were found in a prohibited area near a nuclear power facility.&quot;
Ulrika Sundberg, the Swedish Ambassador, accompanied the Swedes to their flight.
As of the time of their release Swedish officials had still not received a formal report from Pakistan explaining why the four were detained.
During a 23 November 2009 press conference, Ghezali&#x27;s lawyers offered more details of the trip.
The asserted that Ghezali and his companions had made a last-minute decision, during a tour of middle eastern countries, to alter their plans to include Pakistan in their itinerary. They were told by their tour coordinator that the visas for travel within Pakistan could be arranged upon their arrival.
His lawyers expressed concern that Swedish intelligence officials continued to keep Ghezali under surveillance.
They expressed concern that the press speculation that his travel to Pakistan had been inspired by support for Islamic extremism was unfair and unsupported by any evidence.

==Alleged involvement in Bulgarian bombing attack==
Bulgarian media suggested on 19 July 2012 that Ghezali might have been the suicide bomber responsible for the 18 July Burgas bus attack. The Swedish Security Service responded with a brief statement that Ghezali was not the bomber. Within 48 hours Bulgarian investigators ruled him out as a suspect.

<text>Storsien is a small village in Kalix Municipality in northern Sweden. It is best known for the internment camp located there where about 300–370 communists and pacifists were held during the winter of 1939–1940.

The village was founded in 1798 and grew to its maximum size at the end of the 1940s with about 80 inhabitants. Today it consists of thirteen farms with a total of about twenty-five people. Mail service, with one delivery per week, was started in early 1900. Telephones were installed in 1927, and electricity in 1941.

<text>Löbau-Zittau (, ; Polish: &quot;Lubawa-Żytawa&quot; ) is a former Kreis (district) in the east of Saxony, Germany. Neighboring districts were the district Bautzen in the north-west and the Niederschlesischer Oberlausitzkreis in the north. To the east was Poland, and to the south the Czech Republic.

== History ==
The district was formed in 1994 by merging two previous districts, Löbau and Zittau. In August 2008, it became a part of the new district of Görlitz.

== Geography ==
The main river in the district is the Lusatian Neisse, which also forms the boundary to Poland. It is mostly hilly landscape of the Lausitzer Bergland; the highest elevation is the &quot;Lausche&quot; with 793 m above sea level.

<text>The 87th Precinct is a series of police procedural novels and stories by American author Ed McBain (a writing pseudonym of Evan Hunter). McBain&#x27;s 87th Precinct works have been adapted, sometimes loosely, into movies and television on several occasions.

==Setting==
The series is based on the work of the police detective squad of the 87th Precinct in the central district of Isola, a large fictional city obviously based on New York City. Isola is the name of the central district of the city (it fulfills the role of the borough of Manhattan within New York City). Other districts in McBain&#x27;s fictionalized version of New York broadly correspond to NYC&#x27;s other four boroughs, Calm&#x27;s Point standing in for Brooklyn, Majesta representing Queens, Riverhead substituting for the Bronx, and Bethtown for Staten Island.

Other recognizable locations that correspond to New York City landmarks are Grover Park (Central Park), Sand&#x27;s Spit (Long Island), the rivers Harb (Hudson) and Dix (East River), neighborhoods such as The Quarter (The Village), Devil&#x27;s Break (Spuyten Duyvil), Stewart City (Tudor City), and Diamondback (Harlem), and specific places such as Buena Vista Hospital (Bellevue), Ramsey University (New York University), Hall Avenue (Fifth Avenue), Jefferson Avenue (Madison Avenue), and the Stem or Stemmler Avenue (Broadway). 

The 87th Precinct has 16 detectives on its regular roster and is said to have the highest crime rate in the city and the busiest Fire Department in the world. Every single 87th Precinct novel begins with a disclaimer:

&quot;&quot;The city in these pages is imaginary.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The people, the places are all fictitious.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Only the police routine is based on established investigatory technique.&quot;&quot;

==Characters==
The books feature a large ensemble cast, often but not always centered on about half a dozen police detectives and other supporting characters. Detective Steve Carella is a major character in the series, alongside officers Cotton Hawes, Hal Willis, Bert Kling, the ambitious youngster, the hot-tempered Roger Havilland, and comic relief from the unfortunately named Meyer Meyer. A mysterious antagonist known as The Deaf Man appears occasionally over the years. The Deaf Man is a master criminal, who is &quot;a little hard of hearing&quot; and whose identity is never revealed. He is the precinct&#x27;s, and, specifically, Carella&#x27;s nemesis, and appears in the novels &quot;The Heckler&quot;, &quot;Fuzz&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear it for the Deaf Man&quot;, &quot;Eight Black Horses&quot;, &quot;Mischief&quot;, and &quot;Hark!&quot;

<text>Distributed Language Translation (, DLT) was a project to develop an interlingual machine translation system for twelve European languages. It ran between 1985 and 1990.

:The distinctive feature of DLT was the use of [a version of] Esperanto as an intermediate language (IL) and the idea that translation could be divided into two stages: from L1 into IL and then from IL into L2. The intermediate translation could be transmitted over a network to any number of workstations which would take care of the translation from IL into the desired language. Since the IL format would have been disambiguated at the source, it could itself serve as a source for further translation without human intervention. — Job M. van Zuijlen (one of the DLT researchers)

DLT was undertaken by the Dutch software house BSO (now part of Atos Origin) in Utrecht in cooperation with the now defunct Dutch airplane manufacturer Fokker and the Universal Esperanto Association.

A prototype application of DLT in technical translation (through &#x27;AECMA Simplified English&#x27;, in collaboration with Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker) achieved an accuracy rate of around 95 percent. Not only the specific technical vocabulary was checked, but also narrow and broad contexts. For more general texts (e.g. reports from UNESCO meetings), the accuracy of the translation was around 50 to 60 percent. BSO failed to attract investment for a further development phase after 1990, and DLT was abandoned unfinished. However, the value of this research project, which according to external experts was very promising, remains in the form of published articles and a whole series of books, detailed and comprehensive enough to support future developments, as if according to the concept of &quot;open source&quot;.

<doc id="311396" wikidata="Q144000" url="?curid=311396" title="Lists of endangered languages">
<text>Lists of endangered languages are mainly based on the definitions used by UNESCO. In order to be listed, a language must be classified as &quot;endangered&quot; in a cited academic source. Researchers have concluded that in less than one hundred years, almost half of the languages known today will be lost forever.
The lists are organized by region.

==Discussion==
SIL Ethnologue (2005) lists 473 out of 6,909 living languages inventorised (6.8%) as &quot;nearly extinct&quot;, indicating cases where &quot;only a few elderly speakers are still living&quot;; this figure dropped to 6.1% as of 2013.

When judging whether or not a language is endangered, the number of speakers is less important than their age distribution. There are languages in Indonesia reported with as many as two million native speakers alive now, but all of advancing age, with little or no transmission to the young. On the other hand, while there are only 30,000 Ladin speakers left, almost all children still learn it as their mother tongue; thus Ladin is not currently endangered. Similarly, the Hawaiian language has only about 1,000 speakers, but it has stabilised at this number, and there is now school instruction in the language, from preschool through the 12th grade; thus the language is classified as merely vulnerable.

While there are somewhere around six or seven thousand languages on Earth today, about half of them have fewer than about 3,000 speakers. Experts predict that even in a conservative scenario, about half of today&#x27;s languages will become extinct within the next 50 to 100 years.

<text>A common year is a calendar year with 365 days, as distinguished from a &quot;leap year&quot;, which has 366 days. More generally, a common year is one without intercalation. The Gregorian calendar (like the earlier Julian calendar) employs both common years and leap years to keep the calendar aligned with the tropical year, which does not contain an exact number of days. A common year is approximately a quarter day shorter than a tropical year, which has 365.24 days.

The common year of 365 days has 52 weeks and one day, hence a common year always begins and ends on the same day of the week (for example, January 1 and December 31 will fall on a Wednesday in 2025) and the year following a common year will start on the subsequent day of the week. In common years, February has exactly four weeks, so March begins on the same day of the week. November also begins on this day. For example, February 2025 starts on a Saturday, so March will also begin on a Saturday. November will follow the same characteristic.

Each common year has 179 even-numbered days and 186 odd-numbered days.

In the Gregorian calendar, 303 out of every 400 years are common years. By comparison, in the Julian calendar, 300 out of every 400 years are common years, and in the Revised Julian calendar (used by Greece) 682 out of every 900 years are common years.

<doc id="311401" wikidata="Q1133779" url="?curid=311401" title="Renaissance art">
<text>Renaissance art (1350 – 1620) is the painting, sculpture, and decorative arts of the period of European history known as the Renaissance, which emerged as a distinct style in Italy in about AD 1400, in parallel with developments which occurred in philosophy, literature, music, science, and technology. Renaissance art took as its foundation the art of Classical antiquity, perceived as the noblest of ancient traditions, but transformed that tradition by absorbing recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and by applying contemporary scientific knowledge. Along with Renaissance humanist philosophy, it spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities. For art historians, Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the medieval period to the Early Modern age.
The body of art, including painting, sculpture, architecture, music and literature identified as &quot;Renaissance art&quot; was primarily produced during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries in Europe under the combined influences of an increased awareness of nature, a revival of classical learning, and a more individualistic view of man. Scholars no longer believe that the Renaissance marked an abrupt break with medieval values, as is suggested by the French word &quot;renaissance&quot;, literally meaning &quot;rebirth&quot;. In many parts of Europe, Early Renaissance art was created in parallel with Late Medieval art.

==Origins==
Many influences on the development of Renaissance men and women in the early 15th century have been credited with the emergence of Renaissance art; they are the same as those that affected philosophy, literature, architecture, theology, science, government and other aspects of society. The following list presents a summary of changes to social and cultural conditions which have been identified as factors which contributed to the development of Renaissance art. Each is dealt with more fully in the main articles cited above. The scholars of Renaissance period focused on present life and ways improve human life. They did not pay much attention to medieval philosophy or religion. During this period, scholars and humanists like Erasmus, Dante and Petrarch criticized superstitious beliefs and also questioned them. The concept of education also widened its spectrum and focused more on creating &#x27;an ideal man&#x27; who would have a fair understanding of arts, music, poetry and literature and would have the ability to appreciate these aspects of life. 

* Classical texts, lost to European scholars for centuries, became available. These included documents of philosophy, prose, poetry, drama, science, a thesis on the arts, and early Christian theology.
* Europe gained access to advanced mathematics, which had its provenance in the works of Islamic scholars.
* The advent of movable type printing in the 15th century meant that ideas could be disseminated easily, and an increasing number of books were written for a broader public.
* The establishment of the Medici Bank and the subsequent trade it generated brought unprecedented wealth to a single Italian city, Florence.
* Cosimo de&#x27; Medici set a new standard for patronage of the arts, not associated with the church or monarchy.
* Humanist philosophy meant that man&#x27;s relationship with humanity, the universe and God was no longer the exclusive province of the church.
* A revived interest in the Classics brought about the first archaeological study of Roman remains by the architect Brunelleschi and sculptor Donatello. The revival of a style of architecture based on classical precedents inspired a corresponding classicism in painting and sculpture, which manifested itself as early as the 1420s in the paintings of Masaccio and Uccello.
* The improvement of oil paint and developments in oil-painting technique by Belgian and French artists such as Robert Campin, Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden and Hugo van der Goes led to its adoption in Italy from about 1475 and had ultimately lasting effects on painting practices worldwide.
* The serendipitous presence within the region of Florence in the early 15th century of certain individuals of artistic genius, most notably Masaccio, Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Piero della Francesca, Donatello and Michelozzo formed an ethos out of which sprang the great masters of the High Renaissance, as well as supporting and encouraging many lesser artists to achieve work of extraordinary quality.
* A similar heritage of artistic achievement occurred in Venice through the talented Bellini family, their influential in-law Mantegna, Giorgione, Titian and Tintoretto.
* The publication of two treatises by Leone Battista Alberti, &quot;De pictura&quot; (&quot;On Painting&quot;) in 1435 and &quot;De re aedificatoria&quot; (&quot;Ten Books on Architecture&quot;) in 1452.

==History==
===Proto-Renaissance in Italy, 1280–1400===
In Italy in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the sculpture of Nicola Pisano and his son Giovanni Pisano, working at Pisa, Siena and Pistoia shows markedly classicising tendencies, probably influenced by the familiarity of these artists with ancient Roman sarcophagi. Their masterpieces are the pulpits of the Baptistery and Cathedral of Pisa. 

Contemporary with Giovanni Pisano, the Florentine painter Giotto developed a manner of figurative painting that was unprecedentedly naturalistic, three-dimensional, lifelike and classicist, when compared with that of his contemporaries and teacher Cimabue. Giotto, whose greatest work is the cycle of the &quot;Life of Christ&quot; at the Arena Chapel in Padua, was seen by the 16th-century biographer Giorgio Vasari as &quot;rescuing and restoring art&quot; from the &quot;crude, traditional, Byzantine style&quot; prevalent in Italy in the 13th century.

===Early Renaissance in Italy, 1400–1495===
Although both the Pisanos and Giotto had students and followers, the first truly Renaissance artists were not to emerge in Florence until 1401 with the competition to sculpt a set of bronze doors of the Baptistery of Florence Cathedral, which drew entries from seven young sculptors including Brunelleschi, Donatello and the winner, Lorenzo Ghiberti. Brunelleschi, most famous as the architect of the dome of Florence Cathedral and the Church of San Lorenzo, created a number of sculptural works, including a life-sized crucifix in Santa Maria Novella, renowned for its naturalism. His studies of perspective are thought to have influenced the painter Masaccio. Donatello became renowned as the greatest sculptor of the Early Renaissance, his masterpieces being his humanist and unusually erotic statue of David, one of the icons of the Florentine republic, and his great monument to Gattamelata, the first large equestrian bronze to be created since Roman times.

The contemporary of Donatello, Masaccio, was the painterly descendant of Giotto and began the Early Renaissance in Italian painting in 1425, furthering the trend towards solidity of form and naturalism of face and gesture that Giotto had begun a century earlier. From 1425 to 1428, Masaccio completed several panel paintings but is best known for the fresco cycle that he began in the Brancacci Chapel with the older artist Masolino and which had a profound influence on later painters, including Michelangelo. Masaccio&#x27;s developments were carried forward in the paintings of Fra Angelico, particularly in his frescos at the Convent of San Marco in Florence.

The treatment of the elements of perspective and light in painting was of particular concern to 15th-century Florentine painters. Uccello was so obsessed with trying to achieve an appearance of perspective that, according to Giorgio Vasari, it disturbed his sleep. His solutions can be seen in his masterpiece set of three paintings, the Battle of San Romano, which is believed to have been completed by 1460. Piero della Francesca made systematic and scientific studies of both light and linear perspective, the results of which can be seen in his fresco cycle of &quot;The History of the True Cross&quot; in San Francesco, Arezzo.

In Naples, the painter Antonello da Messina began using oil paints for portraits and religious paintings at a date that preceded other Italian painters, possibly about 1450. He carried this technique north and influenced the painters of Venice. One of the most significant painters of Northern Italy was Andrea Mantegna, who decorated the interior of a room, the Camera degli Sposi for his patron Ludovico Gonzaga, setting portraits of the family and court into an illusionistic architectural space.

The end period of the Early Renaissance in Italian art is marked, like its beginning, by a particular commission that drew artists together, this time in cooperation rather than competition. Pope Sixtus IV had rebuilt the Papal Chapel, named the Sistine Chapel in his honour, and commissioned a group of artists, Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Rosselli to decorate its wall with fresco cycles depicting the Life of Christ and the Life of Moses. In the sixteen large paintings, the artists, although each working in his individual style, agreed on principles of format, and utilised the techniques of lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation that had been carried to a high point in the large Florentine studios of Ghiberti, Verrocchio, Ghirlandaio and Perugino.
===Early Netherlandish art, 1425–1525===
The painters of the Low Countries in this period included Jan van Eyck, his brother Hubert van Eyck, Robert Campin, Hans Memling, Rogier van der Weyden and Hugo van der Goes. Their painting developed partly independently of Early Italian Renaissance painting, and without the influence of a deliberate and conscious striving to revive antiquity.

The style of painting grew directly out of medieval painting in tempera, on panels and illuminated manuscripts, and other forms such as stained glass; the medium of fresco was less common in northern Europe. The medium used was oil paint, which had long been utilised for painting leather ceremonial shields and accoutrements because it was flexible and relatively durable. The earliest Netherlandish oil paintings are meticulous and detailed like tempera paintings. The material lent itself to the depiction of tonal variations and texture, so facilitating the observation of nature in great detail.

The Netherlandish painters did not approach the creation of a picture through a framework of linear perspective and correct proportion. They maintained a medieval view of hierarchical proportion and religious symbolism, while delighting in a realistic treatment of material elements, both natural and man-made. Jan van Eyck, with his brother Hubert, painted &quot;The Altarpiece of the Mystical Lamb&quot;. It is probable that Antonello da Messina became familiar with Van Eyck&#x27;s work, while in Naples or Sicily. In 1475, Hugo van der Goes&#x27; &quot;Portinari Altarpiece&quot; arrived in Florence, where it was to have a profound influence on many painters, most immediately Domenico Ghirlandaio, who painted an altarpiece imitating its elements.

A very significant Netherlandish painter towards the end of the period was Hieronymus Bosch, who employed the type of fanciful forms that were often utilized to decorate borders and letters in illuminated manuscripts, combining plant and animal forms with architectonic ones. When taken from the context of the illumination and peopled with humans, these forms give Bosch&#x27;s paintings a surreal quality which have no parallel in the work of any other Renaissance painter. His masterpiece is the triptych &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;.

===Early Renaissance in France, 1375–1528===
The artists of France (including duchies such as Burgundy) were often associated with courts, providing illuminated manuscripts and portraits for the nobility as well as devotional paintings and altarpieces. Among the most famous were the Limbourg brothers, Flemish illuminators and creators of the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry manuscript illumination. Jean Fouquet, painter of the royal court, visited Italy in 1437 and reflects the influence of Florentine painters such as Paolo Uccello. Although best known for his portraits such as that of Charles VII of France, Fouquet also created illuminations, and is thought to be the inventor of the portrait miniature. 

There were a number of artists at this date who painted famous altarpieces, that are stylistically quite distinct from both the Italian and the Flemish. These include two enigmatic figures, Enguerrand Quarton, to whom is ascribed the &quot;Pieta of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon&quot;, and Jean Hey, otherwise known as &quot;the Master of Moulins&quot; after his most famous work, the Moulins Altarpiece. In these works, realism and close observation of the human figure, emotions and lighting are combined with a medieval formality, which includes gilt backgrounds.

===High Renaissance in Italy, 1495–1520===

The &quot;universal genius&quot; Leonardo da Vinci further perfected the aspects of pictorial art (lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening, and characterisation) that had preoccupied artists of the Early Renaissance in a lifetime of studying and meticulously recording his observations of the natural world. His adoption of oil paint as his primary media meant that he could depict light and its effects on the landscape and objects more naturally and with greater dramatic effect than had ever been done before, as demonstrated in the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (1503–1506). His dissection of cadavers carried forward the understanding of skeletal and muscular anatomy, as seen in the unfinished &quot;Saint Jerome in the Wilderness&quot; (c. 1480). His depiction of human emotion in &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, completed 1495–1498, set the benchmark for religious painting.
The art of Leonardo&#x27;s younger contemporary Michelangelo took a very different direction. Michelangelo in neither his painting nor his sculpture demonstrates any interest in the observation of any natural object except the human body. He perfected his technique in depicting it, while in his early twenties, by the creation of the enormous marble statue of &quot;David&quot; and the group &quot;Pietà&quot;, in the St Peter&#x27;s Basilica, Rome. He then set about an exploration of the expressive possibilities of the human anatomy. His commission by Pope Julius II to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling resulted in the supreme masterpiece of figurative composition, which was to have profound effect on every subsequent generation of European artists. His later work, &quot;The Last Judgement&quot;, painted on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel between 1534 and 1541, shows a Mannerist (also called Late Renaissance) style with generally elongated bodies which took over from the High Renaissance style between 1520 and 1530.

Standing alongside Leonardo and Michelangelo as the third great painter of the High Renaissance was the younger Raphael, who in a short lifespan painted a great number of lifelike and engaging portraits, including those of Pope Julius II and his successor Pope Leo X, and numerous portrayals of the Madonna and Christ Child, including the &quot;Sistine Madonna&quot;. His death in 1520 at age 37 is considered by many art historians to be the end of the High Renaissance period, although some individual artists continued working in the High Renaissance style for many years thereafter.

In Northern Italy, the High Renaissance is represented primarily by members of the Venetian school, especially by the latter works of Giovanni Bellini, especially religious paintings, which include several large altarpieces of a type known as &quot;Sacred Conversation&quot;, which show a group of saints around the enthroned Madonna. His contemporary Giorgione, who died at about the age of 32 in 1510, left a small number of enigmatic works, including &quot;The Tempest&quot;, the subject of which has remained a matter of speculation. The earliest works of Titian date from the era of the High Renaissance, including the massive altarpiece &quot;The Assumption of the Virgin&quot;, which combines human action and drama with spectacular colour and atmosphere. Titian continued painting in a generally High Renaissance style until near the end of his career in the 1570s, although he increasingly used colour and light over line to define his figures.

===German Renaissance art===
German Renaissance art falls into the broader category of the Renaissance in Northern Europe, also known as the Northern Renaissance. Renaissance influences began to appear in German art in the 15th century, but this trend was not widespread. Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Art Through the Ages&quot; identifies Michael Pacher, a painter and sculptor, as the first German artist whose work begins to show Italian Renaissance influences. According to that source, Pacher&#x27;s painting, &quot;St. Wolfgang Forces the Devil to Hold His Prayerbook&quot; (c. 1481), is Late Gothic in style, but also shows the influence of the Italian artist Mantegna.

In the 1500s, Renaissance art in Germany became more common as, according to Gardner, &quot;The art of northern Europe during the sixteenth century is characterized by a sudden awareness of the advances made by the Italian Renaissance and by a desire to assimilate this new style as rapidly as possible.&quot; One of the best known practitioners of German Renaissance art was Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528), whose fascination with classical ideas led him to Italy to study art. Both Gardner and Russell recognized the importance of Dürer&#x27;s contribution to German art in bringing Italian Renaissance styles and ideas to Germany. Russell calls this &quot;Opening the Gothic windows of German art,&quot; while Gardner calls it Dürer&#x27;s &quot;life mission.&quot; Importantly, as Gardner points out, Dürer &quot;was the first northern artist who fully understood the basic aims of the southern Renaissance,&quot; although his style did not always reflect that. The same source says that Hans Holbein the Younger (1497–1543) successfully assimilated Italian ideas while also keeping &quot;northern traditions of close realism.&quot; This is contrasted with Dürer&#x27;s tendency to work in &quot;his own native German style&quot; instead of combining German and Italian styles. Other important artists of the German Renaissance were Matthias Grünewald, Albrecht Altdorfer and Lucas Cranach the Elder.

Artisans such as engravers became more concerned with aesthetics rather than just perfecting their crafts. Germany had master engravers, such as Martin Schongauer, who did metal engravings in the late 1400s. Gardner relates this mastery of the graphic arts to advances in printing which occurred in Germany, and says that metal engraving began to replace the woodcut during the Renaissance. However, some artists, such as Albrecht Dürer, continued to do woodcuts. Both Gardner and Russell describe the fine quality of Dürer&#x27;s woodcuts, with Russell stating in &quot;The World of Dürer&quot; that Dürer &quot;elevated them into high works of art.&quot;

===Britain===

Britain was very late to develop a distinct Renaissance style and most artists of the Tudor court were imported foreigners, usually from the Low Countries, including Hans Holbein the Younger, who died in England. One exception was the portrait miniature, which artists including Nicholas Hilliard developed into a distinct genre well before it became popular in the rest of Europe. Renaissance art in Scotland was similarly dependent on imported artists, and largely restricted to the court.

==Themes and symbolism==

Renaissance artists painted a wide variety of themes. Religious altarpieces, fresco cycles, and small works for private devotion were very popular. For inspiration, painters in both Italy and northern Europe frequently turned to Jacobus de Voragine&#x27;s &quot;Golden Legend&quot; (1260), a highly influential source book for the lives of saints that had already had a strong influence on Medieval artists. The rebirth of classical antiquity and Renaissance humanism also resulted in many mythological and history paintings. Ovidian stories, for example, were very popular. Decorative ornament, often used in painted architectural elements, was especially influenced by classical Roman motifs.

==Techniques==
* The use of proportion – The first major treatment of the painting as a window into space appeared in the work of Giotto di Bondone, at the beginning of the 14th century. True linear perspective was formalized later, by Filippo Brunelleschi and Leon Battista Alberti. In addition to giving a more realistic presentation of art, it moved Renaissance painters into composing more paintings.
* Foreshortening – The term foreshortening refers to the artistic effect of shortening lines in a drawing so as to create an illusion of depth.
* Sfumato – The term &quot;sfumato&quot; was coined by Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci and refers to a fine art painting technique of blurring or softening of sharp outlines by subtle and gradual blending of one tone into another through the use of thin glazes to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. This stems from the Italian word &quot;sfumare&quot; meaning to evaporate or to fade out. The Latin origin is &quot;fumare&quot;, to smoke.
* Chiaroscuro – The term &quot;chiaroscuro&quot; refers to the fine art painting modeling effect of using a strong contrast between light and dark to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. This comes from the Italian words meaning light (&quot;chiaro&quot;) and dark (&quot;scuro&quot;), a technique which came into wide use in the Baroque period.

<doc id="311402" wikidata="Q232873" url="?curid=311402" title="René Cassin">
<text>René Samuel Cassin (5 October 1887 – 20 February 1976) was a French known for co-authoring the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.

Born in Bayonne, Cassin served as a soldier in the First World War during which he was seriously wounded. He was of Portuguese-Jewish descent.

On 24 June 1940, during the Second World War, Cassin heeded General Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s radio appeal and joined him in London. Cassin used his legal expertise to help de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French.

Between 1944 and 1959, Cassin was a member of the Council of State.

Seconded to the UN Commission on Human Rights after the war, he was a major contributor to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For that work, he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1968. The same year, he was awarded one of the UN General Assembly&#x27;s Human Rights Prizes.

== Early life ==

Cassin was born in Bayonne on 5 October 1887, to a Sephardi Jewish family. He grew up in Nice, where he attended the , and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree at 17. At the University of Provence he studied political economics, constitutional history, and Roman law and was awarded distinctions in law, a university degree with distinction and the first prize in the competitive examinations in the faculty of law. He was an invited speaker at international peace conferences. In 1914 in Paris, he was awarded his doctorate in juridical science, economics and politics.

== First World War ==

Cassin served in the First World War in 1916 at the Battle of the Meuse. In one operation, he led the attack on enemy positions and was gravely injured in the arm, side and stomach by machine gunfire. A medic saved his life, but he received surgical treatment only ten days later at Antibes. He was awarded the for his actions but was too seriously injured to return to active duty, and he was mustered out as a war invalid.

==Interwar period==
He helped to found the Union fédérale, a leftist pacifist organization for veterans.

Cassin also headed many non-governmental organizations (NGO) and founded the French Federation of Disabled War Veterans in 1918 and served until 1940 as its president and then as its honorary president.

In 1920, Cassin was appointed professor of law at Lille and in 1929 at Paris, where he continued to teach until 1960. In addition, he taught at the Academy of International Law of The Hague, and at the Geneva Graduate Institute, among other places.

As a French delegate to the League of Nations from 1924 to 1938, Cassin pressed for progress on disarmament and for developing institutions to aid the resolution of international conflicts.

== Second World War ==

Refusing the armistice, Cassin embarked on a British ship, the &quot;SS Ettrick&quot;, in Saint-Jean-de-Luz on 24 June 1940, and joined General Charles de Gaulle in London to help him continue the war against Germany. Cassin was, therefore, one of the first to join de Gaulle.
De Gaulle needed legal help to draft the statutes of Free France and so Cassin&#x27;s arrival in London was very welcome.

René Cassin did not speak English but already knew leading academics and political figures like British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden.

In April 1941, Cassin made a radio broadcast from London by addressing himself especially to French Jews from a secular viewpoint and reminding them of the full and equal protection that France had always offered to Jews since the French Revolution. He exhorted them to help pay back that debt by joining the forces of Free France. In May, Vichy France stripped Cassin of his French citizenship and in 1942 sentenced him to death in absentia.

== Later life and career ==
After the war, Cassin was assigned to the United Nations to help draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Working from a list of rights elaborated by the Canadian scholar and professor of law John Humphrey, Cassin produced a revised draft and expanded the text.

He served on the UN Human Rights Commission and the Hague Court of Arbitration.

He was also a member (1959–1965) and president (1965–1968) of the European Court of Human Rights. The court building is now on &quot;Allée René Cassin&quot;, in Strasbourg.

In 1945, General de Gaulle suggested that Cassin, having done so much for the French people, also do something to help the Jewish people. Cassin became the president of the French-Jewish Alliance Israelite Universelle (AIU) which had been dedicated primarily to educating Sephardi Jews living in the Ottoman Empire according to a modern French curriculum. As president of the AIU, Cassin worked with the American Jewish Committee and the Anglo-Jewish Association to found the Consultative Council of Jewish Organisations, a network dedicated to building support for Cassin&#x27;s platform of human rights from a Jewish perspective while the UN human rights system was in its early stages of development.

In 1947, Cassin created the French Institute of Administrative Sciences (IFSA). He was the first president of the association, which organized many conferences to help to develop the French doctrine in administrative law.

On 10 November 1950, he was photographed at a UN radio, alongside Karim Azkoul, Georges Day and Herald CL Roy, participating in a roundtable discussion for the use of French-speaking countries. That is perhaps all the more interesting because Azkoul and Cassin differed so strongly in their perspectives concerning the politics of Zionism.

Cassin died in Paris in 1976 and was initially interred at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris. In 1987, his remains were exhumed and enshrined in the crypt of the Pantheon in Paris.

== Legacy ==
In 2001, the CCJO René Cassin was founded in Cassin&#x27;s memory to promote universal human rights from a Jewish perspective.

The René Cassin Medal is awarded by the CCJO to those who have made an outstanding global contribution to human rights. As the head of the Alliance Israélite in France, Cassin had pursued civil rights for the Jews and was an active Zionist.

A high school in Jerusalem is named after him. 

In 2003, the Basque government created the René Cassin Award &quot;with the goal of publicly acknowledging and rewarding individuals or collectives that, through their personal or professional path, showed a strong commitment to the promotion, defence and divulgation of Human Rights&quot;. The award is given on 10 December, which is International Human Rights Day.

The law campus of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University is named after him.

<doc id="311406" wikidata="Q217041" url="?curid=311406" title="Leap year starting on Sunday">
<text>A leap year starting on Sunday is any year with 366 days (i.e. it includes 29 February) that begins on Sunday, 1 January, and ends on Monday, 31 December. Its dominical letters hence are AG. The most recent year of such kind was 2012, and the next one will be 2040 in the Gregorian calendar or, likewise 2024 and 2052 in the obsolete Julian calendar.

This is the only leap year with three occurrences of Friday the 13th: those three in this leap year occur three months (13 weeks) apart: in January, April, and July. Common years starting on Thursday share this characteristic, in the months of February, March, and November.

Additionally, these types of years are the only ones which contain 54 different calendar weeks (2 partial, 52 in full) in areas of the world where Monday is considered the first day of the week.

==Calendars==

==Applicable years==
===Gregorian Calendar===
Leap years that begin on Sunday, along with those starting on Friday, occur most frequently: 15 of the 97 (≈ 15.46%) total leap years in a 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar. Thus, their overall occurrence is 3.75% (15 out of 400).

===Julian Calendar===
Like all leap year types, the one starting with 1 January on a Sunday occurs exactly once in a 28-year cycle in the Julian calendar, i.e., in 3.57% of years. As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years, it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e., 25 cycles. The formula gives the year&#x27;s position in the cycle ((year + 8) mod 28) + 1).

<text>A pregnancy test is used to determine whether a female is pregnant or not. The two primary methods are testing for the female pregnancy hormone (human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)) in blood or urine using a pregnancy test kit, and scanning with ultrasonography. Testing blood for hCG results in the earliest detection of pregnancy. Almost all pregnant women will have a positive urine pregnancy test one week after the first day of a missed menstrual period.

== Types ==

=== Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) ===
Identified in the early 20th century, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone that rises quickly in the first few weeks of pregnancy, typically reaching a peak at 8- to 10-weeks gestational age. hCG is produced by what will become the placenta. hCG testing can be performed with a blood (serum) sample (typically done in a medical facility) or with urine (which can be performed in a medical facility or at home). The assays used to detect the presence of hCG in blood or urine are generally reliable and inexpensive. Secretion of hCG can occur as soon as 6 days following ovulation and on average 8–10 days following ovulation; this is the earliest hCG can be detected in a blood sample. The hCG concentration in blood is higher than in urine. Therefore, a blood test can be positive while the urine test is still negative.

Qualitative tests (yes/no or positive/negative results) look for the presence of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin in blood or urine. For a qualitative test the thresholds for a positive test are generally determined by an hCG cut-off where at least 95% of pregnant women would get a positive result on the day of their first missed period. Qualitative urine pregnancy tests vary in sensitivity. High-sensitivity tests are more common and typically detect hCG levels between 20 and 50 milli-international units/mL (mIU/mL). Low-sensitivity tests detect hCG levels between 1500 and 2000 mIU/mL and have unique clinical applications, including confirmation of medication abortion success. Qualitative urine tests available for home use are typically designed as lateral flow tests.

Quantitative tests measure the exact amount of hCG in the sample. Blood tests can detect hCG levels as low as 1 mIU/mL, and typically clinicians will diagnose a positive pregnancy test at 5mIU/mL.

There is a multilevel urine pregnancy test (MLPT) that measures hCG levels semiquantitatively. The hCG levels are measured at &lt;25, 25 to 99, 100 to 499, 500 to 1999, 2000 to 9999, and &gt;10,000 mIU/mL. This test has utility for determining the success of medication abortion.
=== Ultrasound ===
Obstetric ultrasonography may also be used to detect and diagnose pregnancy. It is very common to have a positive at-home urine pregnancy test before an ultrasound. Both abdominal and vaginal ultrasound may be used, but vaginal ultrasound allows for earlier visualization of the pregnancy. With obstetric ultrasonography the gestational sac (intrauterine fluid collection) can be visualized at 4.5 to 5 weeks gestation, the yolk sac at 5 to 6 weeks gestation, and fetal pole at 5.5 to 6 weeks gestation. Ultrasound is used to diagnose multiple gestation, which cannot be diagnosed based on the presence of hCG in urine or blood. Determination of the gestational age of the embryo/fetus is an additional benefit of ultrasound compared to hCG tests.

==Accuracy==
A systematic review published in 1998 showed that home pregnancy test kits, when used by experienced technicians, are almost as accurate as professional laboratory testing (97.4%). When used by consumers, however, the accuracy fell to 75%: the review authors noted that many users misunderstood or failed to follow the instructions included in the kits.

=== False positive ===
False positive pregnancy test results are rare and may occur for several reasons, including:

* user error in performing and interpreting the test,
* biochemical pregnancy (loss of pregnancy before signs of pregnancy are apparent on ultrasound, likely very soon after implantation),
* and non-pregnant production of the hCG molecule (i.e. secretion due to a tumor or the pituitary gland, some diseases of the liver, cancers, including choriocarcinoma and other germ cell tumors, IgA deficiencies, heterophile antibodies, enterocystoplasties, gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTD), and gestational trophoblastic neoplasms).
* bacterial contamination and blood in urine&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallach 2007 https://archive.org/details/interpretationof0000wall_t4n7/page/866 866&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurious &quot;evaporation lines&quot; may appear on many home pregnancy tests if read after the suggested 3–5 minute window or reaction time, independent of an actual pregnancy. False positives may also appear on tests used past their expiration date.

====Due to use of medication====
Urine tests can be falsely positive in those that are taking the medications: chlorpromazine, promethazine, phenothiazines, methadone, aspirin, carbamazepine and drugs that cause high urinary pH.

=== False negative ===
False negative readings can occur when testing is done too early. hCG levels rise rapidly in early pregnancy and the chances of false negative test results diminish with time (increasing gestational age). Less sensitive urine tests and qualitative blood tests may not detect pregnancy until three or four days after implantation. Menstruation occurs on average 14 days after ovulation, so the likelihood of a false negative is low once a menstrual period is late. Ovulation may not occur at a predictable time in the menstrual cycle. A number of factors may cause an unexpectedly early or late ovulation, even for people with a history of regular menstrual cycles. Medical providers often struggle to &#x27;rule out&#x27; pregnancy for medical testing or treatment that cannot be conducted during pregnancy before they can do an accurate urine pregnancy test. 

More rare, false negative results can also occur due to a &quot;hook effect&quot;, where a sample with a very high level of hCG is tested without dilution, causing an invalid result.

== Other uses ==
Pregnancy tests may be used to predict if a pregnancy is likely to continue or is abnormal. Miscarriage, or spontaneous abortion or pregnancy loss, is common in early pregnancy. Serial quantitative blood tests may be done, usually 48 hours apart, and interpreted based on the knowledge that hCG in a viable normal pregnancy rises rapidly in early pregnancy. For example, for a starting hCG level of 1,500 mIU/ml or less, the hCG of continuing, normal pregnancy will increase at least 49% in 48 hours. However, for pregnancies with a higher starting hCG, between 1,500 and 3,000 mIU/ml, the hCG should rise at least 40%; for a starting hCG greater than 3,000 mIU/ml, the hCG should increase at least 33%. Failure to rise by these minimums may indicate that the pregnancy is not normal, either as a failed intrauterine pregnancy or a possible ectopic pregnancy.

Ultrasound is also a common tool for determining viability and location of a pregnancy. Serial ultrasound may be used to identify non-viable pregnancies, as pregnancies that do not grow in size or develop expected structural findings on repeated ultrasounds over a 1–2 week interval may be identified as abnormal. Occasionally, a single ultrasound may be used to identify a pregnancy as non-viable; for example, an embryo that is greater than a certain size but that lacks a visible heart beat may be confidently determined to be not viable without the need for follow up ultrasound for confirmation.

== Research ==
Research has identified at least one other possible marker that may appear earlier and exclusively during pregnancy. For example, early pregnancy factor (EPF) can be detected in blood within 48 hours of fertilization, rather than after implantation. However, its reliable use as a pregnancy test remains unclear as studies have shown its presence in physiological situations besides pregnancy, and its application to humans remains limited.

==History==

Records of attempts at pregnancy testing have been found as far back as the ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian cultures. The ancient Egyptians watered bags of wheat and barley with the urine of a possibly pregnant woman. Germination indicated pregnancy. The type of grain that sprouted was taken as an indicator of the fetus&#x27;s sex. Hippocrates suggested that a woman who had missed her period should drink a solution of honey in water at bedtime: resulting abdominal distention and cramps would indicate the presence of a pregnancy. Avicenna and many physicians after him in the Middle Ages performed &quot;uroscopy&quot;, a nonscientific method to evaluate urine.

Selmar Aschheim and Bernhard Zondek introduced testing based on the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in 1928. Early studies of hCG had concluded that it was produced by the pituitary gland. In the 1930s, Doctor Georgeanna Jones discovered that hCG was produced not by the pituitary gland, but by the placenta. This discovery was important in relying on hCG as an early marker of pregnancy. In the Aschheim and Zondek test, an infantile female mouse was injected subcutaneously with urine of the woman to be tested, and the mouse later was killed and dissected. Presence of ovulation indicated that the urine contained hCG and meant that the subject was pregnant. A similar test was developed using immature rabbits. Here, too, killing the animal to check her ovaries was necessary.

At the beginning of the 1930s, Hillel Shapiro and Harry Zwarenstein, who were researchers at the University of Cape Town, discovered that if urine from a pregnant woman was injected into the South African &quot;Xenopus&quot; frog and the frog ovulated, this indicated that the subject was pregnant. This test, known as the frog test, was used throughout the world from the 1930s to 1960s, with &quot;Xenopus&quot; frogs being exported in great numbers. Shapiro&#x27;s advisor, Lancelot Hogben, claimed to have developed the pregnancy test himself, but this was refuted by both Shapiro and Zwarenstein in a letter to the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;. A later article, independently authored, granted Hogben credit for the principle of using &quot;Xenopus&quot; to determine gonadotropin levels in a pregnant woman&#x27;s urine, but not for its usage as a functional pregnancy test.

Hormonal pregnancy tests such as Primodos and Duogynon were used in the 1960s and 1970s in the UK and Germany. These tests involved taking a dosed amount of hormones, and observing the response a few days later. A pregnant woman does not react, as she is producing the hormones in pregnancy; a subject who is not pregnant responds to the absence of the hormone by beginning a new menstrual cycle. While the test was (is) generally considered accurate, research advancements have replaced it with simpler techniques.

Immunologic pregnancy tests were introduced in 1960 when Wide and Gemzell presented a test based on in-vitro hemagglutination inhibition. This was a first step away from in-vivo pregnancy testing and initiated a series of improvements in pregnancy testing leading to the contemporary at-home testing. Direct measurement of antigens, such as hCG, was made possible after the invention of the radioimmunoassay in 1959. Radioimmunoassays require sophisticated apparatus and special radiation precautions and are expensive.

Organon International obtained the first patent on a home pregnancy test in 1969, two years after product designer Margaret Crane noticed that the laboratory testing procedure was relatively simple and made a prototype. The product became available in Canada in 1971, and the United States in 1977, after delays caused by concerns over sexual morality and the ability of potentially pregnant women to perform the test and cope with the results without a doctor.

Another home pregnancy testing kit was based on the work of Judith Vaitukaitis and Glenn Braunstein, who developed a sensitive hCG assay at the National Institutes of Health. That test went onto the market in 1978.
In the 1970s, the discovery of monoclonal antibodies led to the development of the relatively simple and cheap immunoassays, such as agglutination-inhibition-based assays and sandwich ELISA, used in modern home pregnancy tests. Tests are now so cheap that they can be mass-produced in a general publication and used for advertising.

<doc id="311414" wikidata="Q212955" url="?curid=311414" title="Albert Luthuli">
<text>Albert John Luthuli ( – 21 July 1967) was a South African anti-apartheid activist, traditional leader, and politician who served as the President-General of the African National Congress from 1952 until his death in 1967.

Luthuli was born to a Zulu family in 1898 at a Seventh-day Adventist mission in Bulawayo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). In 1908 he moved to Groutville, where his parents and grandparents had lived, to attend school under the care of his uncle. After graduating from high school with a teaching degree, Luthuli became principal of a small school in Natal where he was the sole teacher. He accepted a government bursary to study for the Higher Teacher&#x27;s Diploma at Adams College. After the completion of his studies in 1922, he accepted a teaching position at Adams College where he was one of the first African teachers. In 1928, he became the secretary of the Natal Native Teachers&#x27; Association, then its president in 1933.

Luthuli&#x27;s entered South African politics and the anti-apartheid movement in 1935, when he was elected chief of the Umvoti River Reserve in Groutville. As chief, he was exposed to the injustices facing many Africans due to the South African government&#x27;s increasingly segregationist policies. This segregation would later evolve into apartheid, a form of institutionalized racial segregation, following the National Party&#x27;s election victory in 1948. Luthuli joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1944 and was elected the provincial president of the Natal branch in 1951. A year later in 1952, Luthuli led the Defiance Campaign to protest the pass laws and other laws of apartheid. As a result, the government removed him from his chief position as he refused to choose between being a member of the ANC or a chief at Groutville. In the same year, he was elected President-General of the ANC. After the Sharpeville massacre, where sixty-nine Africans were killed, leaders within the ANC such as Nelson Mandela believed the organisation should take up armed resistance against the government. Luthuli was initially against the use of violence.  He later gradually came to accept it, but stayed committed to nonviolence on a personal level. Following four banning orders, the imprisonment and exile of his political allies, and the banning of the ANC, Luthuli&#x27;s power as President-General gradually waned. The subsequent creation of uMkhonto we Sizwe, the ANC&#x27;s paramilitary wing, marked the anti-apartheid movement&#x27;s shift from nonviolence to an armed struggle.

Inspired by his Christian faith and the nonviolent methods used by Gandhi, Luthuli was praised for his dedication to nonviolent resistance against apartheid as well as his vision of a non-racial South African society. In 1961, Luthuli was awarded the 1960 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in leading the nonviolent anti-apartheid movement. Luthuli&#x27;s supporters brand him as a global icon of peace similar to Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr, the latter of whom was a follower and admirer of Luthuli. He formed multi-racial alliances with the South African Indian Congress and the white Congress of Democrats, frequently drawing a backlash from Africanists in the ANC. The Africanist bloc believed that Africans should not ally themselves with other races, since Africans were the most disadvantaged race under apartheid. This schism led to the creation of the Pan-Africanist Congress.

== Early life ==

Albert John Luthuli was born at the Solusi Mission Station, a Seventh-day Adventist missionary station, in 1898 to John and Mtonya Luthuli (née Gumede) who had settled in the Bulawayo area of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). He was the youngest of three children and had two brothers, Mpangwa, who died at birth, and Alfred Nsusana. Luthuli&#x27;s father died when he was about six months old, and Luthuli had no recollection of him. His father&#x27;s death led to him being mainly raised by his mother Mtonya, who had spent her childhood in the royal household of King Cetshwayo in Zululand.

Mtonya had converted to Christianity and lived with the American Board Mission prior to her marriage to John Luthuli. During her stay, she learned how to read and became a dedicated reader of the Bible until her death. Despite being able to read, Mtonya never learned how to write. After their marriage, Luthuli&#x27;s father left Natal and went to Rhodesia during the Second Matabele War to serve with the Rhodesian forces. When the war ended, John stayed in Rhodesia with a Seventh-day Adventist mission near Bulawayo and worked as an interpreter and evangelist. Mtonya and Alfred then travelled to Rhodesia to reunite with John, and Luthuli was born there soon after.

Luthuli&#x27;s paternal grandparents, Ntaba ka Madunjini and Titsi Mthethwa, were born in the early nineteenth century and had fought against potential annexation from Shaka&#x27;s Zulu Kingdom. They were also among the first converts of Aldin Grout, a missionary from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABM), which was based near the Umvoti River north of Durban. The abasemakholweni, a converted Christian community within the Umvoti Mission Station, elected Ntaba as their chief in 1860. This marked the start of a family tradition, as Ntaba&#x27;s brother, son Martin, and grandson Albert were also subsequently elected as chiefs.

=== Youth ===

Around 1908 or 1909, the Seventh-day Adventists expressed their interest in beginning missionary work in Natal and requested the services of Luthuli&#x27;s brother, Alfred, to work as an interpreter. Luthuli and his mother followed, and departed Rhodesia to return to South Africa. Luthuli&#x27;s family settled in the Vryheid district of Northern Natal, and resided on the farm of a Seventh-day Adventist. During this time, Luthuli was responsible for tending to the missionary&#x27;s mules as educational opportunities were not available. Luthuli&#x27;s mother recognised his need for a formal education and sent him to live in Groutville under the care of his uncle. Groutville was a small village inhabited predominantly by poor Christian farmers who were affiliated with the nearby mission station run by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABM). The ABM, which commenced operations in Southern Africa in 1834, was a Congregationalist organisation responsible for setting up the Umvoti Mission Station. After the death of ABM missionary Aldin Grout in 1894, the town surrounding the mission station was renamed Groutville.

Luthuli resided in the home of his uncle, Chief Martin Luthuli, and his family. Martin was the first democratically elected chief of Groutville. In 1901, Martin founded the Natal Native Congress, which would later become the Natal branch of the African National Congress. Luthuli had a pleasant childhood as his uncle Martin was guardian over many children in Groutville, which led to Luthuli having many friends of his own age. In Martin&#x27;s traditional Zulu household, Luthuli completed chores expected of a Zulu boy his age such as fetching water, herding, and building fires. Additionally, he attended school for the first time. Under Martin&#x27;s care, Luthuli was also provided with an early knowledge of traditional African politics and affairs, which aided him in his future career as a traditional chief.

=== Education ===

Luthuli&#x27;s mother, Mtonya, returned to Groutville and Luthuli returned to her care. They lived in a brand-new house built by his brother, Alfred, on the site where their grandfather, Ntaba, had once lived. In order to be able to send her son to boarding school, Mtonya worked long hours in the fields of the land she owned. She also took in laundry from European families in the township of Stanger to earn the necessary money for school. Luthuli was educated at a local ABM mission school until 1914, and then transferred to the Ohlange Institute.

Ohlange was founded by John Dube, who was the school principal at the time Luthuli attended. Dube was educated in America but returned to South Africa to open the Ohlange Institute to provide an education to black children. He was the first President-General of the South African Native National Congress and founded the first Zulu-language newspaper, Ilanga lase Natal. Luthuli joined the ANC in 1944, partially out of respect to his former school principal.

Luthuli describes his experience at the Ohlange Institute as &quot;rough-and-tumble.&quot; The outbreak of World War I led to rationing and a scarcity of food among the African population. After attending Ohlange for only two terms, Luthuli was transferred to Edendale, a Methodist school near Pietermaritzburg, the capital of Natal. It was at Edendale that Luthuli participated in his first act of civil disobedience. He joined a protest against a punishment which made boys carry large stones long distances, damaging their uniforms, and leaving many unable to afford replacements. The demonstration failed and Luthuli along with the rest of the strikers were punished by the school. At Edendale, Luthuli developed a passion for teaching and went on to graduate with a teaching degree in 1917.

=== Teaching ===

Around the age of nineteen years old, Luthuli&#x27;s first job after graduation came as a principal at a rural intermediate school in Blaauwbosch, located in the Natal midlands. The school was small, and Luthuli was the sole teacher working there. While teaching at Blaauwbosch, Luthuli lived with a Methodist&#x27;s family. As there were no Congregational churches around him, he became the student of a local Methodist minister, the Reverend Mthembu. He was confirmed in the Methodist church and later became a lay preacher.

Luthuli proved himself to be a good teacher and the Natal Department of Education offered him a bursary in 1920 to study for a Higher Teacher&#x27;s Diploma at Adams College. Following the completion of his two years of study, he was offered another bursary, this time to study at the University of Fort Hare in the Eastern Cape. He refused, as he wanted to earn a salary to take care of his ageing mother. This led him to accept a teaching position at Adams College, where he and Z. K. Matthews were among the first African teachers at the school. Luthuli taught Zulu history, music, and literature, and during his time as a teacher, he met his future wife, Nokukhanya Bhengu. She was also a teacher at Adams and the granddaughter of a Zulu chief. Luthuli was committed to providing quality education to African children and led the Teachers&#x27; College at Adams where he trained aspiring teachers and travelled to different institutions to teach students.

== Early political activity ==
=== Natal Native Teachers&#x27; Association ===

Luthuli was elected as the secretary of the Natal Native Teachers&#x27; Association in 1928 and served under Z. K. Matthews&#x27; presidency. He became the president of the association in 1933. The association had three goals: improving working conditions for African teachers, motivating members to expand their skills, and encouraging members to participate in leisure activities such as sports, music and social gatherings. Despite making little progress in achieving its stated goals, the association is remembered for its opposition to the Chief Inspector for Native Education in Natal, Charles Loram, and his proposal that Africans be educated in &quot;practical functions&quot; and left to &quot;develop along their own lines&quot;. Loram&#x27;s position would serve as the ideological basis for the National Party&#x27;s Bantu Education policy.

=== The Zulu Language and Cultural Society ===
After becoming disappointed with the Natal Native Teachers&#x27; Association&#x27;s slow progress, Luthuli shifted his attention to establishing a new branch of the Teachers&#x27; Association called the Zulu Language and Cultural Society in 1935. Dinizulu, the Zulu king, served as one of the society&#x27;s patrons, and John Dube served as its inaugural president. Luthuli described the purpose of the society as the preservation of what is valuable to Zulu culture while removing the inappropriate practices and beliefs. Luthuli&#x27;s involvement with the society was brief, as he assumed the role of chief in Groutville and could not remain actively involved. As a result, the society&#x27;s goals changed from its original purpose. According to historian Shula Marks, the primary goal of the Zulu Language and Cultural Society was to secure government recognition of the Zulu royal family as the official leaders of the Zulu people. The preservation of Zulu tradition and custom was a secondary goal. Grants and gifts from the South African Native Affairs Department as well as the society&#x27;s involvement with the Zulu royal house led to its demise as it collapsed in 1946. Seeing no real progress being made by the Teachers&#x27; Association and Zulu Society, Luthuli felt compelled to reject the government as a potential collaborator.

=== Cane Growers&#x27; Association ===
The 1936 Sugar Act limited production of sugar in order to keep the price from falling. A quota system was implemented, and, for African cane growers, it was severely limiting. As a response Luthuli decided to revive the Groutville Cane Growers&#x27; Association of which he became chairman. The association was used to make collective bargaining and advocacy more effective. The association achieved a significant victory: an amendment was made to the Sugar Act that allowed African cane growers to have a comprehensive quota. This meant if some farmers were unable to meet their individual quotas, others could make up the difference, ensuring that all cane would be sold and not wasted in the farms.

Luthuli then founded the Natal and Zululand Bantu Cane Growers&#x27; Association, which he served as chairman. The association brought almost all African cane growers into a single union. It had very few achievements, but one of them was securing indirect representation on the central board through a non-white advisory board that was concerned with the production, processing, and marketing of sugar. The structural inequalities and discrimination present in South African society hindered the association&#x27;s efforts to promote the interests of non-white canegrowers, and they proved to be little match for the white canegrowers&#x27; associations. As with the Teachers&#x27; Association, Luthuli was disappointed with the Growers&#x27; Association&#x27;s few successes. He believed that whatever political role he took part in, the stubbornness and hostility of the government would prevent any significant progress from being made. Luthuli continued to support the interests of black cane growers, and was the only black representative on the central board until 1953.

In 1933, Luthuli was asked to succeed his uncle, Martin, as chief of the Umvoti River Reserve. He took two years to make his decision. His salary as a teacher was enough for him to send money home to support his family, but if he accepted the chieftainship he would earn less than one-fifth of his current salary. Furthermore, leaving a job at Adams College, where he worked with people of different ethnicities from all over South Africa, to become a Zulu chief appeared to be a move towards a more insular way of life. Luthuli opted for the role of chief and said he was not motivated by a desire for wealth, fame, or power. At the end of 1935, he was elected as chief and relocated to Groutville. He commenced his duties in January 1936 and continued in the role until he was deposed by the South African government in 1952.

Some chiefs abused their power and used their close relationship with the government to act as dictators. They increased their wealth by claiming ownership of land that was not rightfully theirs, charged excessive fees for services, and accepted bribes to resolve disputes. Despite his reduced salary as a chief, Luthuli rejected corrupt practices. He embraced the concept of Ubuntu, which emphasized the humanity of all people, and governed with an inclusive and democratic approach. He believed that traditional Zulu governance was inherently democratic, with chiefs obligated to respond to the needs of their people. Luthuli was seen as a chief of his people: one community member remembered Luthuli as a &quot;man of the people who had a very strong influence over the community. He was a people&#x27;s chief.&quot; Luthuli involved women, who were considered socially inferior, in the decision-making process of his leadership. He also improved their economic status by allowing them to engage in activities such as beer brewing and running unlicensed bars, despite a government prohibition on these practices.

The position of Africans in the reserves continued to regress as a result of laws passed that controlled their social mobility. The Hertzog Bills were introduced a year after Luthuli was elected chief and were instrumental in the restriction and control of Africans. The first bill, the Natives Representation Bill, removed Africans from the voters&#x27; roll in the Cape and created the Natives Representative Council (NRC). The second bill, the Natives Land and Trust Bill, restricted the land available to the African population of 12 million to less than 13 per cent. The remaining 87 per cent of land in South Africa was primarily reserved for the white population of approximately 3 million in 1936. Limited access to land and poor agricultural technology negatively affected the people of Groutville, and the government&#x27;s policies led to a shortage of land, education, and job opportunities, which limited the potential achievements of the population. Luthuli viewed the conditions of Groutville as a microcosm that affected all black people in South Africa.

== Natives Representative Council ==

The Natives Representative Council (NRC), an advisory body to the government, was established in 1936 with the purpose of compensating and appeasing the African population, who had lost their limited voting rights in the Cape Province due to the enactment of the Hertzog Bills.

In 1946, after John Dube&#x27;s death, Luthuli became a member of the Natives Representative Council through a by-election. He brought his long-standing grievances about insufficient land for African people to the NRC meetings. In August 1946, Luthuli, along with other councilors, objected to the government&#x27;s use of force to quell a large strike by African mineworkers. Luthuli accused the government of disregarding African complaints against their segregationist policies, and African councilors adjourned in protest. He would later describe the NRC as a &quot;toy telephone&quot; requiring him to &quot;shout a little louder&quot; even though no one was listening. The NRC reconvened later in 1946 but adjourned again indefinitely. Its members refused to co-operate with the government, which caused it to become ineffective. The NRC never met after that point and it was disbanded by the government in 1952.

Luthuli frequently addressed the criticism from black South Africans who believed that serving in the Native Representative Council would lead to nothing but talk, and that the NRC was a form of deceit served by the South African government. He often agreed with these sentiments, but he and other contemporary African leaders believed that Africans should represent themselves in all structures created by the government, even if only to change them. He was determined to take the demands and grievances of his people to the government. In the end, like others before him, Luthuli realized that his efforts were futile. In an interview with Drum Magazine in May 1953, Luthuli said that joining the NRC gave White South Africans &quot;a last chance to prove their good faith&quot; but they &quot;had not done so&quot;.

== President of the Natal ANC ==
After John Dube suffered a stroke in 1945, Allison Champion succeeded him as Natal president in 1945 after defeating conservative leader Reverend A. Mtimkulu. During the election meeting, Luthuli was unexpectedly appointed as acting chair. Serving on Champion&#x27;s executive, Luthuli remained politically active. However, the Youth League&#x27;s adoption of a more confrontational Programme of Action in 1949 led to growing dissatisfaction with Champion&#x27;s leadership, as he prioritised Natal&#x27;s separateness over the new strategy. Champion frequently failed to implement strategies and programmes set forth by the national ANC or Youth League, which made the Natal ANC lag behind. Members of the Youth League in Natal nominated Luthuli for Natal president in 1951 as they viewed him as a new brand of leadership. Luthuli and Champion were the two nominees for the election; Luthuli was elected president of the Natal ANC by a small majority.

In Luthuli&#x27;s first appearance as Natal ANC president at the ANC&#x27;s national conference, he pleaded for more time to be given to the Natal ANC in preparation for the planned Defiance Campaign, a large act of civil disobedience by non-white South Africans. Some members of the ANC did not support his request, and he was jeered at and labelled a coward. However, Luthuli had no prior knowledge of this planned campaign and only found out about it as he was travelling to Bloemfontein, where the ANC&#x27;s national conference was held. Many of the details about the campaign were given to his predecessor, A.W.G Champion. The Natal ANC agreed to prepare for the Defiance Campaign, which was slated for the latter half of 1952, and participate as soon as they were ready.

=== Defiance Campaign ===
The preparations for the Defiance Campaign began on 6 April 1952, while the campaign itself was scheduled for 26 June 1952. The preparation day served as a warm-up, with large demonstrations in cities such as Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London, Pretoria, and Durban. Concurrently, many White South Africans observed the three-hundredth anniversary of Jan van Riebeeck&#x27;s landing at the Cape.

Beginning in June, around 8500 volunteers of the ANC and South African Indian Congress, who were carefully selected to follow the method of nonviolent resistance, deliberately set out to break the laws of apartheid. Using strategies inspired by Gandhi, the Defiance Campaign required a strict adherence to a policy of nonviolence. Africans, Indians, and Coloureds used amenities marked &quot;Europeans Only&quot;; they sat on benches and used reserved station platforms, carriages in trains, and post office counters. Until the end of October, the Defiance Campaign remained nonviolent and disciplined. As the movement gained momentum, violence suddenly flared. The outbreaks were not a planned part of the campaign, and many, including Luthuli, believe it to be the work of provocateur agents. The police, frustrated by the passive resistors, responded harshly when outbreaks of violence occurred, resulting in a chain reactions that caused dozens of Africans to be shot.

Despite the efforts of the Defiance Campaign, the government&#x27;s attitude remained unchanged, and they viewed the event as &quot;communist-inspired&quot; and a threat to law and order. This perception led to increased security measures and tighter controls. The Criminal Law Amendment Act allowed for individuals to be banned without trial, and the Public Safety Act allowed the government to suspend rule of law. With more restrictions put in place, the ANC leaders decided to end the campaign in January 1953.

Prior to the campaign, the ANC&#x27;s membership numbered 25,000 in 1951. After the conclusion of the Campaign in 1953, it had increased to 100,000. For the first time African, Indian, and Coloured communities across the country cooperated on a national scale. The Defiance Campaign was also praised for its absence of violence. Even though there were thousands of protesters and some incidents of violence occurred, the low level of violence overall was a notable accomplishment. Due to Luthuli&#x27;s role in the Defiance Campaign as president of the Natal ANC, he was given an ultimatum by the government to choose between his work as a chief at Umvoti or his affiliation with the ANC. He refused to choose, and the government deposed him as chief in November 1952.

== President-General of the ANC ==
In December 1952, Albert Luthuli was elected president general of the ANC with the support of the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) and African communists. Nelson Mandela was elected as his deputy. The ANCYL&#x27;s support for Luthuli reflected its desire for a leader who would enact its programmes and goals, and marked a pattern of younger, more militant members within the ANC ousting presidents they deemed inflexible. The ANCYL had previously succeeded in removing Xuma, Moroka, and Champion when they no longer met their expectations.

Luthuli led the ANC in its most difficult years; many of his executive members, such as Secretary-General Walter Sisulu, Moses Kotane, JB Marks, and David Bopape were either to be banned or imprisoned. The 1950s witnessed the erosion of black civil liberties, through the Treason Trial and the passage of the Suppression of Communism Act, which gave the police power to suppress government critics.

=== First ban ===
On 30 May 1953, the government banned Luthuli for a year, prohibiting him from attending any political or public gatherings and from entering major cities. He was restricted to small towns and private meetings for the rest of 1953. The Riotous Assemblies Act and the Criminal Law Amendment Act provided the legal framework for the issuing of banning orders. It was the first of four banning orders that Luthuli would receive as President-General of the ANC. Following the expiration of his ban, Luthuli continued to attend and speak at anti-apartheid conferences.

=== Second ban ===
In mid-1954, following the expiration of his ban, Luthuli was due to lead a protest in the Transvaal against the Western Areas Removals, a government scheme where close to 75,000 Africans were forced to move from Sophiatown and other townships. As he stepped off his plane in Johannesburg, the Special Branch handed him new banning orders, not only prohibiting the attendance of meetings but confining him to the Groutville area for two years until July 1956.

=== Congress of the People and Freedom Charter===

In 1953, Z. K. Matthews proposed a large democratic convention, to be known as the Congress of the People, where all South Africans would be invited to create a Freedom Charter. Despite complaints within the ANC from Africanists who believed the ANC should not work with other races, a multiracial organization, the Congress Alliance, was created as part of the preparation for the Congress of the People. The alliance was led by the ANC and included the South African Indian Congress, Coloured Peoples Conference, Federation of South African Women, Congress of Trade Unions, and the Congress of Democrats. Luthuli viewed the multiracial organisation as a way to bring freedom to South Africa. After convening a secret meeting in December 1954 due to Luthuli&#x27;s ban, the Congress of the People took place in Kliptown, Johannesburg, in June 1955.

Inspired by the values held in the United States Declaration of Independence and the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the Congress of the People developed the Freedom Charter, a list of demands for a democratic, multi-racial, and free South Africa. While well-received by the attendants of the Congress of the People, the Africanist bloc of the ANC rejected it. They opposed the multiracial nature of the charter and what they perceived as communist principles. Although Luthuli recognised the socialist clauses in the Freedom Charter, he rejected any comparison to the communist ideology of the Soviet Union. The ANC ratified the Charter at a conference one year after it was ratified by the Congress of the People.

Luthuli was not able to attend the Congress of the People or the framing of the Freedom Charter due to a stroke and heart attack as well as the banning order that confined him to Groutville. In his absence, he was bestowed the honour of the Isitwalandwe, which is awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions in the fight for freedom in South Africa.

=== Treason Trial ===
After his second banning order expired in July 1956, he was arrested on 5 December and detained during the preliminary Treason Trial hearings in 1957. Luthuli was one of 156 leaders who were arrested on charges of high treason due to their opposition to apartheid and the Nationalist Party government. High treason carried the death penalty. One of the main charges against the African National Congress leaders were that they were involved in a communist conspiracy to overthrow the government. Anti-apartheid activists were often accused of being communists, and Luthuli was accustomed to such accusations and frequently dismissed them.

The charges brought against the accused covered the period from 1 October 1952 to 13 December 1956, which included events such as the Defiance Campaign, Sophiatown removals protest, and the Congress of the People. Following the preparatory examination period that began on 19 December 1956, all defendants were released on bail. The pre-trial examination concluded in December 1957, resulting in charges being dropped against 65 of the accused, including Luthuli who was acquitted. The trial for the remaining 91 accused individuals began in August 1958 as the Treason Trial commenced. By 1959, only thirty of the accused remained. The trial concluded on 29 March 1961 as all of the remaining defendants were found not guilty.

Many of the lawyers who defended the accused were drawn by Luthuli and Z. K. Matthews being on trial. Their involvement contributed to raising global awareness and support for the accused. The impression that Luthuli made on the foreigners who came to observe the trial led him to be suggested for the Nobel Peace Prize.

=== Third ban and banning of the ANC ===

On 25 May 1959, the government served Luthuli his third banning order, which lasted for five years. This ban prevented Luthuli from attending any meeting held within South Africa and confined him to his home district. Luthuli&#x27;s democratic values had been recognised by many white South Africans, and he had gained a minor celebrity status among some white people, which caused the government to view him with more contempt. When news of his ban spread, supporters of all races gathered to bid farewell to Luthuli.

While Luthuli was still under a banning order, the ANC, led by Luthuli, announced an anti-pass campaign starting at the end of March 1960. The recently created Pan-Africanist Congress, who split from the ANC because of their opposition to the ANC&#x27;s multi-racial alliances, decided to jump ahead of the ANC&#x27;s planned protest by ten days. On 21 March the PAC called for all African men to go to police stations and hand over their passbooks. The peaceful march in Sharpeville resulted in sixty-nine people killed by police fire. Additionally, three people were also killed in Langa. Luthuli and several other ANC leaders ceremonially burned their passbooks in protest against the Sharpeville massacre. Following a state of emergency and the passing of the Unlawful Organisations Act, the government banned the PAC and the ANC. Luthuli and other political leaders were arrested and found guilty of burning their passbooks. In August, Luthuli was fined 100 pounds and initially sentenced to six months in jail. However, in September, this was later reduced to a three year suspended sentence on the condition that he would not be found guilty of a similar offense during that time.

Following his return from prison to Groutville, Luthuli&#x27;s power began to wane due to the banning of the ANC and the banning and imprisonment of supporting leaders, a decline in his health since his stroke and heart attack, and the rise of members in the ANC advocating for an armed struggle. Duma Nokwe, Walter Sisulu, and Nelson Mandela, who had provided leadership for the ANC during South Africa&#x27;s state of emergency, were determined to steer the ANC in a new direction. In May 1961, following a strike, they believed that &quot;traditional weapons of protest… were no longer appropriate.&quot; They constantly evaluated whether the conditions were favourable to launch an armed resistance.

=== uMkhonto we Sizwe ===

In June 1961, during a National Executive Committee Working Group session, Mandela proposed that the ANC adopt a self-defense platform. With the government&#x27;s bans on the ANC and nonviolent protests, Mandela believed waiting for revolutionary conditions to arise, which was favoured by communist members, was not an option. Instead, the ANC had to adapt to their new underground conditions and draw inspiration from successful uprisings in Cuba, Algeria, and Vietnam. Mandela argued that the ANC was the only anti-apartheid organisation that had the capacity to adopt an armed struggle and if they didn&#x27;t take the lead, they would fall behind in their own movement.

In July 1961, the ANC and Congress Alliance met to hold debates during an ANC NEC meeting surrounding the feasibility of Nelson Mandela&#x27;s proposal of armed self-defence. Luthuli did not support an armed struggle as he believed the ANC members were ill-prepared without modern firearms and battlefield experience. In a following meeting a day later, a contentious back-and-forth arose. Supporters of armed defence believed the ANC was afraid and running from a physical fight while others believed counter-violence would provoke the government into arresting and killing them.

While Luthuli did not support an armed struggle, he also did not oppose it. According to Mandela, Luthuli suggested &quot;two separate streams of the struggle&quot;: the ANC, which would remain nonviolent, and a &quot;military movement [that] should be a separate and independent organ, linked to the ANC and under the overall control of the ANC, but fundamentally autonomous&quot;. The formation of uMkhonto we Sizwe was part of a larger shift towards armed resistance in southern Africa. Other militant organisations were created in South West Africa, Mozambique, and Southern Rhodesia in the early 1960s. The stated goal of uMkhonto we Sizwe was to cripple South Africa&#x27;s economy without bloodshed and force the government into negotiating. Mandela explained to Luthuli that only attacks against military installations, transportation links, and power plants would be carried out, which eased Luthuli&#x27;s fears of the potential of loss of life.

=== Nobel Peace Prize ===

In October 1961, during his most severe ban yet, Luthuli received the 1960 Nobel Peace Prize, becoming the first African person to win the award. He was awarded the prize for his use of nonviolent methods in his fight against racial discrimination. His nomination was put forward by Andrew Vance McCracken, the editor of &quot;Advance&quot;, a Congregational Church magazine. His name was supported by Norwegian Socialist MPs who nominated him in February 1961. He travelled to Oslo, Norway, to receive the award with his wife and his secretary, Massabalala Yengwa.

The Nobel Prize transformed Luthuli from being relatively unknown to a global celebrity. He received congratulatory letters from leaders of 25 countries, including U.S. President John F. Kennedy. In Groutville, journalists lined up to interview Luthuli who dedicated the award to the ANC and expressed gratitude to his wife Nokukhanya. He also used his newfound status as a global podium, and he pleaded to the UN and South Africa&#x27;s trading partners to impose sanctions on Verwoerd&#x27;s government. His comments to the press made the world focus on apartheid and its effects on Africans. During Luthuli&#x27;s Nobel Peace Prize speech he spoke about the contribution of people among all races to find a peaceful solution to South Africa&#x27;s race problem. He went on to speak of how the &quot;true patriots&quot; of South Africa would not be satisfied until there were full democratic rights for everyone, equal opportunity, and the abolition of racial barriers. Norwegian newspaper Arbeiderbladet described the effect of Luthuli&#x27;s visit claiming: &quot;We have suddenly begun to feel Africa&#x27;s nearness and greatness.&quot; The Times highlighted the strong impression that Luthuli made on the global stage following his appeal to end racial discrimination and establish an equal South Africa. The day after Luthuli returned to South Africa from the award ceremony, uMkhonto we Sizwe launched their first operations on 16 December 1961.

The reaction from South Africa&#x27;s government, as well as many White South Africans, was hostile. Luthuli still had to apply for permission to receive the prize in Oslo, Norway on 10 December 1961. Minister of the Interior, Jan de Klerk initially refused to issue Luthuli a passport but after intense domestic and international pressure, the government finally issued him one. After he was granted permission and received his award, Eric Louw, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, rejected Luthuli&#x27;s demands for universal suffrage and claimed that Luthuli&#x27;s speech justified the government restricting his travel within South Africa. The government-operated South African Broadcasting Corporation aired a defamatory broadcast about Luthuli. Volksblad argued the way Luthuli had &quot;grasped every opportunity to besmirch South Africa was shocking&quot;. The Star stated: &quot;Mr. Luthuli demands a universal franchise, which is just as silly as restricting the vote to people of one colour and he asks the world to apply sanctions to his own country, which is as reckless and damaging as has been another leader&#x27;s (HF Verwoerd) impetuous withdrawal from the commonwealth. Neither speaks for the authentic South African&quot;. The belief that qualified franchise could be extended to Africans without accepting a democracy based on &quot;one person, one vote&quot; was the view of a majority of White South Africans.

Luthuli received congratulations from some White South Africans, such as parliamentarian Jan Steytler and the Pietermaritzburg City Council. The Natal Daily News, a white-owned newspaper, described him as &quot;a man with moral and intellectual qualities that have earned him the respect of the world and a position of leadership&quot;. They also urged the government to &quot;listen to the voice of responsible African opinion&quot;. South African author and Liberal Party leader Alan Paton concluded that Luthuli was &quot;the only man in South Africa who could lead both the left and the right... both Africans and non-Africans&quot;.

=== International popularity ===
Following his Nobel Peace Prize win, Luthuli was in a position of international renown for his nonviolence despite the concurrent sabotage operations of uMkhonto we Sizwe. On 22 October 1962, University of Glasgow students elected Luthuli as Lord Rector in recognition of his &quot;dignity and restraint&quot;. The rectorship position was honorary. Luthuli&#x27;s role would have been chair of the university court, the university&#x27;s executive body, which met every month. Students elected Luthuli knowing he would serve in absentia. Although ceremonial, Luthuli&#x27;s election was significant as he was the first African and first non-white person to be nominated as Rector. The South African government allegedly intercepted all mail from the University to Luthuli, an allegation the government denied.

Luthuli&#x27;s adherence to nonviolence also had support from his friend and civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., who commended Luthuli&#x27;s reputation and spoke of his admiration for Luthuli&#x27;s &quot;dedication to the cause of freedom and dignity&quot;. In September 1962, King and Luthuli had issued the Appeal For Action Against Apartheid organised by the American Committee on Africa, which boosted solidarity between the anti-apartheid and civil rights movements and urged Americans to protest apartheid through nonviolent measures such as boycotts. In 1964, King became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner receiving the award for his nonviolent activism against racial discrimination, similar to Luthuli. While travelling to Oslo to receive his Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, King stopped in London to give an &quot;Address on South African Independence.&quot; The audience included Luthuli&#x27;s exiled compatriots, citizens of different African countries, and human rights advocates from India, Pakistan, the West Indies, and the United States. King compared the racism in America to South Africa stating: &quot;clearly there is much in Mississippi and Alabama to remind South Africans of their own country.&quot; He praised Luthuli for his leadership and identified &quot;with those in a far more deadly struggle for freedom in South Africa.&quot; King anticipated that the withdrawal of all economic investments and trade from South Africa by the United States and Britain would end apartheid and enable people of all races to build the society they want. During King&#x27;s Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech on 10 December 1964, Luthuli received a special mention. King called Luthuli a &quot;pilot&quot; of the freedom movement and claimed South Africa was the &quot;most brutal expression of man&#x27;s inhumanity to man&quot;.

Artist Ronald Harrison, 22 years old at the time, unveiled his painting, The Black Christ, in 1962. Harrison portrayed Luthuli as Christ crucified on a cross. The painting was unveiled in St. Luke&#x27;s Anglican Church in Salt River with the permission of Archbishop de Blank. The painting garnered controversy across South Africa. Along with Christ being depicted as Black, the two Roman soldiers resembled Prime Minister H. F. Verwoerd and Minister of Justice John Vorster. Minister of the Interior, Jan de Klerk, ordered the painting to be taken down and Harrison to appear before the Censorship Board. The Censorship Board banned the painting, deeming it disrespectful to religious sentiments. Following a CBS television documentary on the artwork, the government mandated its destruction. Danish and Swedish supporters of the anti-apartheid movement smuggled the painting to Britain where, under Anglican priest John Collins&#x27; supervision, its display raised money for the International Defence and Aid Fund, a fund created to defend political prisoners. Harrison was arrested and tortured by the Special Branch who intended on discovering who Harrison collaborated with to paint and display The Black Christ. He would later serve eight years of house arrest on charges related to his painting. Luthuli desired to meet Harrison after learning of his painting and its significance, and the Norwegian Embassy arranged a visit for Harrison to Luthuli. Norwegians took Harrison from Cape Town to Durban, and Harrison met Luthuli clandestinely in Groutville.

== Fourth ban ==
Effective 31 May 1964, John Vorster, the Minister of Justice, issued Luthuli a more severe banning order than the one he received in 1959. Unlike the previous ban, the new ban prevented Luthuli from travelling to the closest town of Stanger until 31 May 1969. Vorster believed that Luthuli&#x27;s activism advanced communism, and he cautioned him against publishing any statements, making contact with banned individuals, or addressing gatherings. NUSAS, the Liberal Party, and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions publicly protested this banning order. The ban increased Luthuli&#x27;s isolation from the ANC, but he continued to share his message with the world through visitors such as United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy. During Kennedy&#x27;s 1966 tour of South Africa, he criticized white South Africa&#x27;s racism and described apartheid as an abandonment of all that western civilization holds sacred. He later flew by helicopter to Groutville to visit Luthuli where they discussed the anti-apartheid and civil rights movements. Kennedy later gave a press conference where he described Luthuli as one of the most impressive men he had ever met.

Luthuli&#x27;s political and physical activity declined significantly in the period leading up to his death. During the 33 months from October 1964 until his passing in July 1967, there are only a few archival records produced by Luthuli&#x27;s hand, which consist of sermon notes and medical reminders scribbled on scraps of paper. These notes suggest that Luthuli had little contact with others during the last six months of his life and focused primarily on religious matters, including dates of service and scripture readings. Although it is not certain, it appears that Luthuli&#x27;s mental state may have been declining, as his handwriting became increasingly difficult to decipher. There are no archival records from his last two years of life, casting doubt on his ability to function as the President-General of the ANC or pose a political threat to the government. Newspaper articles reported that Luthuli&#x27;s ability to read and write had significantly declined, and he devoted most of his time listening to radio broadcasts. According to The Sunday Times, Luthuli underwent delicate surgery on his left eye at McCord Zulu Hospital, and as a result, he was granted a suspension of his banning orders. The eye had been causing him constant pain and had been &#x27;virtually useless&#x27; ever since his stroke in 1955. The pain caused by the eye had been a long-standing issue, and doctors had even discussed with Luthuli the option of removing it. According to other newspaper articles, Luthuli was facing more health issues than just his eye problem. He stayed in the hospital for up to four weeks, and other health concerns, including high blood pressure, may have extended his stay. The fact that he drafted and signed his will immediately before his hospitalization raise doubts about the common belief that Luthuli was in good health leading up to his death.

== Death ==
On Friday 21 July 1967, Luthuli left his house at 08:30 and informed his wife that he would be walking to his store near Gledhow train station. Luthuli traveled from his house to his store and back daily. An hour later at 09:30, he arrived at his store where he delivered a package to his employee. Around 10:00, Luthuli left his store and told his store employee that he was going to his field, and would return later. Forty minutes later Luthuli crossed the river again to return to his store without having met with any of his field workers. On his way back to his store, Luthuli was struck by a goods train.

At 10:29, a goods train pulled by a locomotive left Stanger for Durban. Aboard the train were the driver, conductor, and fireman. At 10:36 the train passed Gledhow station without stopping. Two minutes later at 10:38, the train began to cross the Umvoti River railway bridge. Someone entering the bridge would have passed a sign that read, &quot;Cross This Bridge At Their Own Risk&quot; in English and Afrikaans. The driver indicated in his testimony that he blew the whistle from the time he saw Luthuli walking towards the train until the train hit him. The driver informed the fireman that the train had hit someone, and the driver testified that he immediately applied the brakes and brought the train to a halt. The driver and the fireman left the train and attended to Luthuli, who was still alive and breathing despite having received head injuries. Luthuli was brought to Stanger Hospital at approximately 11:50, where the Senior Medical Superintendent described his condition as &quot;semi-conscious&quot; and &quot;bleeding freely&quot; due to injuries sustained to his head.

For two and a half hours, from 11:50 to 14:20, the doctors treated Luthuli&#x27;s wounds by giving a blood transfusion and providing heart stimulant medication. Around 13:00, Luthuli&#x27;s son, Christian, arrived at the hospital to see Luthuli who was still conscious. Christian informed Nokukhanya about Luthuli&#x27;s potential relocation to King Edward VIII Hospital in Durban, prompting her to search for him there. At Stanger Hospital, Luthuli&#x27;s condition started to deteriorate despite treatment. It was then decided to not transfer Luthuli to a different hospital due to his worsening condition. Instead, a neurosurgeon from Durban would come to Stanger Hospital. Upon hearing the news, Nokukhanya travelled to Stanger. At 14:20, neurosurgeon Mauritius Joubert arrived at Stanger Hospital. He found Luthuli in a coma not responding to stimulation. Five minutes after his examination, at 14:25, Luthuli died. Nokukhanya arrived at the hospital five minutes after his death without having said goodbye to him. 

=== Reaction ===
After learning of Luthuli&#x27;s death, people around the world immediately suspected foul play from the South African government. Despite a formal inquest concluding he was killed by a train, speculation remained rampant and still carries on years after his death. As soon as they learned about Luthuli&#x27;s death, the ANC and its allies suspected that the South African government was responsible for it. The Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union repeated the same claims in Sechaba, the official organ of the ANC. The Tanganyika African National Union described Luthuli&#x27;s death as &quot;dubious&quot;. In a letter to the ANC, vice-president of FRELIMO, Uria Simango, claimed Luthuli&#x27;s death was premeditated. Many of Luthuli&#x27;s family members believe that he was deliberately killed. Daughters Thandeka and Albertinah both maintained that he was murdered in the decades following his death. Albert Luthuli biographer, Scott Everett Couper, states that the myth of Luthuli being killed leads to an inaccurate portrayal of Luthuli, stating: &quot;To say that Luthuli was mysteriously killed is to understand that he still had a vital role in the struggle for liberation at the time of his death, that he was a threat to the apartheid regime. Sadly, Luthuli had long since been considered obsolete by leaders of his own movement and he had little contact with those imprisoned, banned or exiled. Since Sharpeville... Luthuli served only as the honorary, emeritus, titular leader of the ANC&quot;. In May 2024 the South African Minister of Justice Ronald Lamola announced that the inquest into Luthuli&#x27;s death would be reopened.

<doc id="311423" wikidata="Q80442" url="?curid=311423" title="Robert Campin">
<text>Robert Campin (c. 1375 – 26 April 1444), now usually identified with the Master of Flémalle (earlier the Master of the Merode Triptych, before the discovery of three other similar panels), was a master painter who, along with Jan van Eyck, initiated the development of early Netherlandish painting, a key development in the early Northern Renaissance.

While the existence of a highly successful painter called Robert Campin is relatively well documented for the period, no works can be certainly identified as by him through a signature or contemporary documentation. A group of paintings, none dated, have been long attributed to him, and a further group were once attributed to an unknown &quot;Master of Flémalle&quot;. It is now usually thought that both groupings are by Campin, but this has been a matter of some controversy for decades.

A corpus of work is attached to the unidentified &quot;Master of Flémalle,&quot; so named in the 19th century after three religious panels said to have come from a monastery in Flémalle. They are each assumed to be wings of triptychs or polyptychs, and are the &quot;Virgin and Child with a Firescreen&quot; now in London, a panel fragment with the &quot;Thief on the Cross&quot; in Frankfurt, and the Brussels version of the &quot;Mérode Altarpiece&quot;.

Campin was active by 1406 as a master painter in Tournai, in today&#x27;s Belgium, and became that city&#x27;s leading painter for 30 years. He had attained citizenship by 1410. His fame had spread enough by 1419 that he led a large and profitable workshop. He had an extra-marital affair with a woman named Leurence Pol, which led to his imprisonment. Campin, however, was able to maintain his public standing and workshop until his death in 1444.
The early Campin panels show the influence of the International Gothic artists the Limbourg brothers (1385–1416) and Melchior Broederlam (c. 1350 – c.1409), but display a more realistic observation than any earlier artists, achieved through innovations in the use of oil paints. He was successful in his lifetime, and the recipient of a number of civic commissions. Campin taught both Rogier van der Weyden, named in these early records as Rogelet de la Pasture, a French version of his name) and Jacques Daret. Campin was a contemporary of Jan van Eyck, and they are recorded as meeting in 1427. Campin&#x27;s best known work is the &quot;Mérode Altarpiece&quot; of c. 1425–28.

==Life==

Campin first appears as settled in Tournai from the archives of 1405–06, as a free master of the guild of goldsmiths and painters, and there has been a lot of speculation about his origin and birthplace which is actually unknown, although he is sometimes listed as having been born in Valenciennes. In 1408 he had purchased the house that he had been leasing since 1406 near the Tournai Cathedral. In 1410, he bought full citizenship. Records show a large number of commissions from individuals and guilds, as well as from ecclesiastical and civic authorities. Campin owned several houses, purchased city bonds and invested in mortgages.

Between 1423 and 1429, the city government was dominated by the guilds. Campin was the deputy dean of the guild of goldsmiths and painters in 1423–24 and 1425. In 1427 he represented the guild on the city council.
Between 1426 and 1428, during his time at the guild, Campin employed four different apprentices Rogelet de le Pasture, Haquin de Blandain, Jaquelotte Daret, Willemet. After restoration of the oligarchy of full citizens, the leaders of the guild regime, including Robert Campin, were brought to court. Campin was ordered to make a pilgrimage to Saint-Gilles and pay the fine.

Campin was married to Ysabel de Stocquain (Elisabeth van Stokkem). The couple was childless. He had an affair with Laurence Polette, for which he was prosecuted in 1432 and sentenced to banishment for a year. Margaret of Burgundy, wife of the Count of Holland and sister of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy intervened on his behalf, and this was reduced to a fine. 
A short time after the verdict Campin&#x27;s apprentices Rogier van der Weyden and Jacques Daret were accepted as masters into the guild of painters. However, the dated &quot;Werl Altarpiece&quot; (1438) shows he continued to work (the two outer wings are in the Prado; the main panel is lost). He died in his adopted city of Tournai in 1444.

==Identity and style==

Although heavily indebted to late 14th-century manuscript illumination aesthetics, Campin displayed greater powers of realistic observation than any other painter before him. He was one of the first to experiment with the use of oil-based colours, in lieu of egg-based tempera, to achieve the brilliance of color typical for this period. Campin used the new technique to convey strong, rounded characters by modelling light and shade in compositions of complex perspectives.
Art historians have long been keen to trace the beginnings of the Northern Renaissance – with far less evidence to go on than in Italy. For a long time it was thought that Jan van Eyck was the first painter to make full use of the innovations apparent in manuscript illumination in panel painting. By the end of the 19th century it became clear, however, that Van Eyck was the contemporary of an artist who painted a number of works, including the &quot;Mérode Altarpiece&quot;. Dated to about 1428, the altarpiece (now in the Cloisters of the Metropolitan Museum of Art) is permeated with loving attention to details and realism. Three other panels in a similar manner, supposed to come from the so-called abbey of Flémalle (it has been established that there was, in fact, no such abbey), are now in Frankfurt. It was argued that these works belong to one &quot;Master of Flémalle&quot;, whose identity at that time could not be established.

In the 20th century, several scholars suggested that the Master of Flémalle may be Robert Campin, documented as a master painter in Tournai from 1406. The argument turns around a paper mentioning two pupils entering his studio in 1427 – Jacques Daret and Rogelet de la Pasture. The latter was probably Rogier van der Weyden. A very well-documented altarpiece by Daret shows striking similarities with the works of Master of Flémalle, as do early works by Rogier. Therefore, it is tempting to assume that both Daret and Rogier were disciples of the Master of Flémalle, i.e. Robert Campin. Another possibility, however, is that the Flémalle panels were painted by Rogier himself when he was still in his twenties. Some scholars have even attributed the famous &quot;Deposition&quot; in the Prado (Madrid) to Campin rather than Van der Weyden.

The tightest definition of the works from his own hand includes only the &quot;Flémalle&quot; panels, a &quot;&#x27;Nativity&quot; at Dijon, a &quot;Crucified Thief&quot; (fragment of a &quot;Crucifixion&quot;) in Frankfurt, two portraits of a man and woman in London (of around 1430), and perhaps the &quot;Seilern Triptych&quot;. This, which excludes the best known works usually attributed to him, which are then assigned to his workshop or followers, is the position taken by Lorne Campbell.

==Work==
The &quot;Entombment Triptych&quot; (or &quot;Seilern Triptych&quot; Courtauld Institute, London) is dated to around 1425. The central panel shows his debt to the sculpture of the time (Campin was known to have polychromed several statues). After this, he painted the &quot;Marriage of the Virgin&quot; (Museo del Prado, Madrid) and &quot;Nativity&quot; (Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon) around 1420–1425.

Around 1425–1428 Campin painted the &quot;Mérode Altarpiece&quot;, a triptych (three paneled paintings) commissioned for private use. The Annunciation occupies the central panel. The Archangel Gabriel is shown approaching Mary, who sits reading. She is depicted in a well-kept middle-class Flemish home. Several works attributed to Robert Campin may be seen in the Hermitage, including diptych panels depicting &quot;The Holy Trinity&quot; and &quot;The Virgin and Child&quot;. Other works are displayed in the Prado, and the London National Gallery. Campin also collaborated with other artists, e.g. with Jean Delemer in creating (presumably painting) two wooden sculptures of the Annunciation currently in the Church of Saint Quentin, Tournai.

<doc id="311424" wikidata="Q1427231" url="?curid=311424" title="Valsalva maneuver">
<text>The Valsalva maneuver is performed by a forceful attempt of exhalation against a closed airway, usually done by closing one&#x27;s mouth and pinching one&#x27;s nose shut while expelling air, as if blowing up a balloon. Variations of the maneuver can be used either in medical examination as a test of cardiac function and autonomic nervous control of the heart (because the maneuver raises the pressure in the lungs), or to clear the ears and sinuses (that is, to equalize pressure between them) when ambient pressure changes, as in scuba diving, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, or air travel.

A modified version is done by expiring against a closed glottis. This will elicit the cardiovascular responses described below but will not force air into the Eustachian tubes.

== History ==
The technique is named after Antonio Maria Valsalva, a 17th-century physician and anatomist from Bologna whose principal scientific interest was the human ear. He described the Eustachian tube and the maneuver to test its patency (openness).

==Physiological response==
The normal physiological response consists of four phases.
# Initial pressure rise
#: On application of expiratory force, pressure rises inside the chest forcing blood out of the pulmonary circulation into the left atrium. This causes a mild rise in stroke volume during the first few seconds of the maneuver.
# Reduced venous return and compensation
#: Return of systemic blood to the heart is impeded by the pressure inside the chest. The output of the heart is reduced, and stroke volume falls. This occurs from 5 to about 14 seconds in the illustration. The fall in stroke volume reflexively causes blood vessels to constrict with some rise in pressure (15 to 20 seconds). This compensation can be marked with pressure returning to near or above normal, but the cardiac output and blood flow to the body remain low. During this time, the pulse rate increases (compensatory tachycardia).
# Pressure release
#: The pressure on the chest is released, allowing the pulmonary vessels and the aorta to re-expand, causing a further initial slight fall in stroke volume (20 to 23 seconds) due to decreased left atrial return and increased aortic volume, respectively. Venous blood can once more enter the chest and the heart; cardiac output increases.
# Return of cardiac output
#: Blood return to the heart is enhanced by the effect of the entry of blood that has been dammed back, causing a rapid increase in cardiac output (24 seconds on). The stroke volume usually rises above normal before returning to a normal level. With the return of blood pressure, the pulse rate returns to normal.

In summary, the maneuver increases intrathoracic pressure and, thus, a decrease in preload to the heart. This decreased preload leads to cardiovascular changes through the baroreflex and other compensatory reflex mechanisms. Deviation from this response pattern signifies either abnormal heart function or abnormal autonomic nervous control of the heart. Dentists also use Valsalva following extraction of a maxillary molar tooth. The maneuver is performed to determine if there is a or antral communication.

== Applications ==

=== Normalizing middle-ear pressures ===
When rapid ambient pressure increase occurs, as in underwater diving or aircraft descent, this pressure tends to hold the Eustachian tubes closed, preventing pressure equalization across the eardrum and causing pain. To avoid this painful situation, divers, caisson workers and people in pressurised aircraft attempt to open the Eustachian tubes by swallowing, which tends to open the tubes, allowing the ear to equalize itself.

If this fails, then the Valsalva maneuver may be used. This maneuver, when used as a tool to equalize middle ear pressure, carries with it the risk of auditory damage from over-pressurization of the middle ear. The Valsalva maneuver generates about 20–40 mm of Hg pressure. It is safer, if time permits, to attempt to open the Eustachian tubes by swallowing a few times, or yawning, or by using the Valsalva technique of breathing a minimal amount of air gently into nostrils held closed by the fingers as soon as mild pressure is felt before it increases to the point that its release would be painful. The effectiveness of the &quot;yawning&quot; method can be improved with practice; some people can achieve release or opening by moving their jaw forward or forward and down, rather than straight down as in a classical yawn, and some can do so without moving their jaw at all by activating the tensor tympani muscle, which is heard by the individual as a deep, rumbling sound. 

During swallowing or yawning, several muscles in the pharynx (throat) elevate the soft palate and open the throat. One of these muscles, the tensor veli palatini, also acts to open the Eustachian tube. This is why swallowing or yawning is successful in equalizing middle ear pressure. Contrary to popular belief, the jaw does not pinch the tubes shut when closed. The Eustachian tubes are not located close enough to the mandible to be pinched off. People often recommend chewing gum during ascent/descent in aircraft because chewing gum increases the rate of salivation, and swallowing the excess saliva opens the Eustachian tubes.

In a clinical setting, the Valsalva maneuver is commonly done against a closed glottis or an external pressure measuring device, thus eliminating or minimizing the pressure on the Eustachian tubes. Straining or blowing against resistance, as in blowing up balloons, has a Valsalva effect, and the fall in blood pressure can result in dizziness and even fainting.

=== Strength training ===
The Valsalva maneuver is commonly believed to be the optimal breathing pattern for producing maximal force. It is frequently used in powerlifting to stabilize the trunk during exercises such as the squat, deadlift, and bench press, and in both lifts of Olympic weightlifting.

=== Pain management ===
The Valsalva maneuver can reduce pain during lumbar puncture. According to Kumar, et al., performing the maneuver on an awake patient triggers predictable cardiovascular and autonomic responses that can be timed by a skilled surgeon to maximize anesthetic benefit for the patient.

=== Regulation of heart rhythm ===
The Valsalva maneuver may be used to arrest episodes of supraventricular tachycardia. Blood pressure (BP) rises at onset of straining-because the increased intrathoracic pressure (ITP) is added to the pressure in the aorta. It then falls because the ITP compresses the veins, decreasing the venous return and cardiac output. This inhibits the baroreceptors, causing tachycardia and a rise in peripheral vascular resistance (PVR). When the glottis is opened and the ITP returns to normal, cardiac output is restored, but the peripheral vessels are constricted. The blood pressure therefore rises above normal, and this stimulates the baroreceptors, causing bradycardia and a drop in BP to a normal level.

=== Medical diagnostics ===

==== Cardiology ====

The maneuver can sometimes be used to diagnose heart abnormalities, especially when used in conjunction with an echocardiogram. For example, the Valsalva maneuver (phase II) increases the intensity of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy murmurs, namely those of dynamic subvalvular left ventricular outflow obstruction. This is due to the decreased preload in this phase, worsening the obstruction and thus accentuating the murmur. At the same time, the Valsalva maneuver (phase II) decreases the intensity of most other murmurs, including those resulting from aortic stenosis and atrial septal defect. The decrease in murmur intensity occurs from a smaller preload, which reduces the amount of blood ejected through the stenotic aortic valve, thereby decreasing murmur intensity.

==== Neurology ====
The Valsalva maneuver is used to aid in the clinical diagnosis of problems or injuries in the nerves of the cervical spine. Upon performing the Valsalva maneuver, intraspinal pressure slightly increases. Thus, neuropathies or radicular pain may be felt or exacerbated, which may indicate nerve impingement by an intervertebral disc or other part of the anatomy. Headache and pain upon performing the Valsalva maneuver are also one of the main symptoms in Arnold–Chiari malformation. The Valsalva maneuver may help check for a dural tear following certain spinal operations, such as a microdiscectomy. An increase in intra-spinal pressure will cause cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) to leak out of the dura, causing a headache.

The Valsalva maneuver has been associated with transient global amnesia.

==== Palpation of supraclavicular lymph nodes ====
As the lymph nodes may be buried, asking the patient to perform the Valsalva maneuver can push the cupola of the lung upward, bringing deep-seated nodes to a more accessible position for palpation. Palpation may identify an enlargement of the supraclavicular lymph nodes, a diagnostic indicator of cancer. The prevalence of malignancy in the presence of supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is reported to be in the range of 54% to 85%.

==== Oral–antral communication ====
A variant of the Valsalva maneuver is used to aid diagnosis of oral–antral communication, i.e., the existence of a connection between the oral cavity and the maxillary sinus.

==== Urogenital medicine ====
The Valsalva maneuver is used to aid in the diagnosis of intrinsic sphincteric deficiency (ISD) in urodynamic tests. Valsalva leak point pressure is the minimum vesicular pressure associated with urine leakage. Although there is no consensus on the threshold value, values &gt; 60 cm H2O are commonly considered to indicate hypermobility of the bladder neck and normal sphincter function. Also, when examining women with pelvic organ prolapse, asking the patient to perform the Valsalva maneuver is used to demonstrate maximum pelvic organ descent.

== Complications ==
The Valsalva maneuver is relatively safe, and side effects are rare. Yet, complications include Valsalva retinopathy in susceptible patients. There are also reports of syncope, chest pain, and arrhythmias due to the performance of the maneuver, so caution is necessary for patients with preexisting coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, or congenital heart defects.

=== Preretinal ===
Valsalva retinopathy is pathological syndrome associated with the Valsalva maneuver. It presents as preretinal hemorrhage (bleeding in front of the retina) in people with a history of transient increase in the intrathoracic pressure and may be associated with heavy lifting, forceful coughing, straining on the toilet, or vomiting. The bleeding may cause visual loss if it obstructs the visual axis, and patients may note floaters in their visual field. Usually, this causes no permanent visual impairments, and sight is fully restored.

== Valsalva device in spacesuits ==
Some spacesuits contain a device called the Valsalva device to enable the wearer to block their nose to perform the Valsalva maneuver when wearing the suit. Astronaut Drew Feustel describes it as &quot;a spongy device called a Valsalva that is typically used to block the nose in case a pressure readjustment is needed&quot;. One use of the device is to equalize pressure during suit pressurization.

<text>Andrew Eldritch (born Andrew William Harvey Taylor, 15 May 1959) is an English singer, songwriter and musician. He is the lead vocalist and only remaining original member of the Sisters of Mercy, a band that emerged from the British post-punk scene, transformed into a gothic rock band, and, in later years, flirted with hard rock.

Formerly a drummer, Eldritch also programs the tracks for the Sisters of Mercy&#x27;s drum machine (known as &quot;Doktor Avalanche&quot;) and plays guitars and keyboards in its studio recordings but uses live shows to focus solely on his vocal performance. Eldritch is well known for his deep and melancholic bass-baritone singing voice as well as his poetic (and sometimes politically charged) lyrics.

The Sisters of Mercy is regarded as a major influence on gothic rock, and Eldritch, with his (former) shock of black hair, bass-baritone vocal style and pale and thin look (with prominent cheekbones), was described in the media as a poster boy for the genre, earning him the label &quot;the Godfather of Goth&quot;, which he frequently rejects.

He also established the record label Merciful Release. In addition to the Sisters of Mercy, in 1986 Andrew Eldritch established a side-project, the Sisterhood, which was quickly abandoned in favour of continuing working under the Sisters of Mercy.

==Early life and education==
Andrew Eldritch was born on 15 May 1959 in the small cathedral city Ely. He later wrote a piano song named &quot;1959&quot;, referring to the year of his birth and starting with the line &quot;Living as an angel in the place that I was born&quot;.

Eldritch studied French and German literature at the University of Oxford before moving to Leeds around 1978 to study Mandarin Chinese at the University of Leeds: he left both courses before graduating. He speaks fluent French and German and has some knowledge of Dutch, Italian, Russian, Serbian, Croatian, and Latin, but stated he had forgotten the Chinese he learned. During this period, Eldritch was a freelance drummer in the local Leeds punk scene.

==Musical career==
===The Sisters of Mercy===

In 1980, Eldritch and Gary Marx formed the Sisters of Mercy. On the first single, &quot;Damage Done/Watch/Home of the Hit-men&quot;, Eldritch played the drums, a task he was later relieved of by a series of drum machines referred to as Doktor Avalanche, allowing him instead to focus on his vocal performance. Over the years, nine members have left the group, several of them citing conflicts with the frontman as a reason for their departure. These former members include Patricia Morrison, who claimed she had been paid an average of £300 per month; and Wayne Hussey, with whom Eldritch had a personal feud which contributed to heavy criticism of both by the music press during the 1980s. Hussey formed a breakaway band called the Mission as a result of this conflict.

Following the release of the band&#x27;s last studio album to date, &quot;Vision Thing&quot; (1990), Eldritch initiated a 1991 US tour of the Sisters of Mercy in a triple bill with Gang of Four and American hip hop group Public Enemy. The tour was cancelled midway and the band relocated to Europe.

In 1995 Eldritch interviewed David Bowie and Leonard Cohen for the German edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. He also contributed articles on computers to German magazines. That year, he briefly rejuvenated his working relationship with erstwhile Sisters of Mercy guitarist Gary Marx. Marx wrote an album&#x27;s worth of backing tracks, to which Eldritch could contribute lyrics for release as a new studio album. Eldritch eventually backed out of the project and Marx released the tracks over a decade later as a solo album.

Prevented by contractual obligations from appearing under his own name, he is also rumoured to have produced a couple of techno albums under various pseudonyms during the 1990s, a rumour he would not deny when asked about it in an interview by Alexa Williamson in May 1997. Two musical projects Eldritch set up with his label, Merciful Release, have later been confirmed as &quot;Paris Riots&quot; (a collaboration with James Ray) and &quot;Leeds Underground&quot;. Both projects were abandoned before any tracks were released to the public.

In 1997 Eldritch produced the SSV studio album &quot;Go Figure&quot;, featuring his vocals over drumless electronic music. The album finally freed him from his contractual obligations, as East West Records agreed to waive their claims for two more Sisters of Mercy albums in exchange for the recordings. The SSV tracks were, however, never officially released. The full name of the band is SSV-NSMABAAOTWMODAACOTIATW, said to be an acronym for &quot;Screw Shareholder Value – Not So Much a Band as Another Opportunity to Waste Money on Drugs and Ammunition Courtesy of the Idiots at Time Warner&quot;.

The Sisters of Mercy tour every year, but no new recorded material has been released for sale since 1993. New songs have been created yet have only been played live.

In 2009 Eldritch gave his first interview in 12 years to &quot;Classic Rock&quot; writer Joel McIver, in which he rejected the need for any new recorded material from the Sisters and talked at length about the band&#x27;s career.

Speculation about a new Sisters of Mercy studio album release was renewed in November 2016 when Eldritch was quoted by TeamRock website: &quot;I can tell you one thing: If Donald Trump actually does become President, that will be reason enough for me to release another album. I don&#x27;t think I could keep quiet if that happened.&quot; As of September 2024, no new album has been released.

===Songwriting and philosophy===
The devices in Eldritch&#x27;s lyrics include literary allusions (notably to the works of T. S. Eliot, Leonard Cohen and Shakespeare), erotic imagery, and drug culture metaphors. He has made pointed criticism of the Republican Party of the United States, a group with which Eldritch claims to have a &quot;hate-hate&quot; relationship. Politically, he has claimed to be &quot;traditionally a Labour supporter&quot; despite his &quot;anarcho-syndicalist tendencies&quot;.

===Gothic associations===
Though Andrew Eldritch has been called the &quot;Godfather of Goth&quot;, for inspiring and defining the gothic scene musically and aesthetically, the Sisters of Mercy, despite being formed in 1980, were originally not very popular in the early-1980s post-punk subgenre of bands and music fans which the British press had labelled goth. The Sisters of Mercy were, however, accused by the press of plagiarising Joy Division, who were marketed by their management as &quot;gothic&quot; in the late 1970s.

Since the early 1990s, Eldritch has publicly rejected associations with the goth subculture. He describes the Sisters of Mercy as humanist, modernist, and implies he wants nothing to do with goth, stating: &quot;it&#x27;s disappointing that so many people have in all seriousness adopted just one of our many one-week-of-stupid-clothes benders.&quot; He also notes: &quot;I&#x27;m constantly confronted by representatives of popular culture who are far more goth than we, yet I have only to wear black socks to be stigmatised as the demon overlord.&quot;

<text>Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a condition in which severely overweight people fail to breathe rapidly or deeply enough, resulting in low oxygen levels and high blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. The syndrome is often associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which causes periods of absent or reduced breathing in sleep, resulting in many partial awakenings during the night and sleepiness during the day. The disease puts strain on the heart, which may lead to heart failure and leg swelling.
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is defined as the combination of obesity and an increased blood carbon dioxide level during the day that is not attributable to another cause of excessively slow or shallow breathing.
The most effective treatment is weight loss, but this may require bariatric surgery to achieve. Weight loss of 25 to 30% is usually required to resolve the disorder. The other first-line treatment is non-invasive positive airway pressure (PAP), usually in the form of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at night. The disease was known initially in the 1950s, as &quot;Pickwickian syndrome&quot; in reference to a Dickensian character.

==Signs and symptoms==
Most people with obesity hypoventilation syndrome have concurrent obstructive sleep apnea, a condition characterized by snoring, brief episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated blood levels of carbon dioxide, which causes drowsiness (&quot;CO2 narcosis&quot;). Other symptoms present in both conditions are depression, and hypertension (high blood pressure) which is difficult to control with medication. The high carbon dioxide can also cause headaches, which tend to be worsening in the morning.

The low oxygen level leads to physiologic constriction of the pulmonary arteries to correct ventilation-perfusion mismatching, which puts excessive strain on the right side of the heart. When this leads to right sided heart failure, it is known as &quot;cor pulmonale&quot;. Symptoms of this disorder occur because the heart has difficulty pumping blood from the body through the lungs. Fluid may, therefore, accumulate in the skin of the legs in the form of edema (swelling), and in the abdominal cavity in the form of ascites; decreased exercise tolerance and exertional chest pain may occur. On physical examination, characteristic findings are the presence of a raised jugular venous pressure, a palpable parasternal heave, a heart murmur due to blood leaking through the tricuspid valve, hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), ascites and leg edema. Cor pulmonale occurs in about a third of all people with OHS.

==Mechanism==
It is not fully understood why some obese people develop obesity hypoventilation syndrome while others do not. It is likely that it is the result of an interplay of various processes. Firstly, work of breathing is increased as adipose tissue restricts the normal movement of the chest muscles and makes the chest wall less compliant, the diaphragm moves less effectively, respiratory muscles are fatigued more easily, and airflow in and out of the lung is impaired by excessive tissue in the head and neck area. Hence, people with obesity need to expend more energy to breathe effectively. These factors together lead to sleep-disordered breathing and inadequate removal of carbon dioxide from the circulation and hence hypercapnia; given that carbon dioxide in aqueous solution combines with water to form an acid (CO2[g] + H2O[l] + excess H2O[l] --&gt; H2CO3[aq]), this causes acidosis (increased acidity of the blood). Under normal circumstances, central chemoreceptors in the brain stem detect the acidity, and respond by increasing the respiratory rate; in OHS, this &quot;ventilatory response&quot; is blunted.

The blunted ventilatory response is attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone leptin, which is secreted by adipose tissue and under normal circumstances increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep apnea) lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali bicarbonate. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a vicious circle.

Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, the tightening of small blood vessels in the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.

The chronically low oxygen levels in the blood also lead to increased release of erythropoietin and the activation of erythropoeisis, the production of red blood cells. This results in polycythemia, abnormally increased numbers of circulating red blood cells and an elevated hematocrit.

==Diagnosis==
Formal criteria for diagnosis of OHS are:
* Body mass index over 30 kg/m2 (a measure of obesity, obtained by taking one&#x27;s weight in kilograms and dividing it by one&#x27;s height in meters squared)
* Arterial carbon dioxide level over 45 mmHg or 6.0 kPa as determined by arterial blood gas measurement
* No alternative explanation for hypoventilation, such as use of narcotics, severe obstructive or interstitial lung disease, severe chest wall disorders such as kyphoscoliosis, severe hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), neuromuscular disease or congenital central hypoventilation syndrome

If OHS is suspected, various tests are required for its confirmation. The most important initial test is the demonstration of elevated carbon dioxide in the blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a blood sample from an artery, usually the radial artery. Given that it would be complicated to perform this test on every patient with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27 mmol/L or higher), blood gasses should be measured.

To distinguish various subtypes, polysomnography is required. This usually requires brief admission to a hospital with a specialized sleep medicine department where a number of different measurements are conducted while the subject is asleep; this includes electroencephalography (electronic registration of electrical activity in the brain), electrocardiography (same for electrical activity in the heart), pulse oximetry (measurement of oxygen levels) and often other modalities. Blood tests are also recommended for the identification of hypothyroidism and polycythemia.

To distinguish between OHS and various other lung diseases that can cause similar symptoms, medical imaging of the lungs (such as a chest X-ray or CT/CAT scan), spirometry, electrocardiography and echocardiography may be performed. Echo- and electrocardiography may also show strain on the right side of the heart caused by OHS, and spirometry may show a restrictive pattern related to obesity.

=== Classification ===
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is a form of sleep disordered breathing. Two subtypes are recognized, depending on the nature of disordered breathing detected on further investigations. The first is OHS in the context of obstructive sleep apnea; this is confirmed by the occurrence of 5 or more episodes of apnea, hypopnea or respiratory-related arousals per hour (high apnea-hypopnea index) during sleep. The second is OHS primarily due to &quot;sleep hypoventilation syndrome&quot;; this requires a rise of CO2 levels by 10 mmHg (1.3 kPa) after sleep compared to awake measurements and overnight drops in oxygen levels without simultaneous apnea or hypopnea. Overall, 90% of all people with OHS fall into the first category, and 10% in the second.

==Treatment==
In people with stable OHS, the most important treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, with medication, or sometimes weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery). This has been shown to improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. Weight loss may take a long time and is not always successful. If the symptoms are significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again uncertain.

While many people with obesity hypoventilation syndrome are cared for on an outpatient basis, some deteriorate suddenly and when admitted to the hospital may show severe abnormalities such as markedly deranged blood acidity (pH&lt;7.25) or depressed level of consciousness due to very high carbon dioxide levels. On occasions, admission to an intensive care unit with intubation and mechanical ventilation is necessary. Otherwise, &quot;bi-level&quot; positive airway pressure (see the next section) is commonly used to stabilize the patient, followed by conventional treatment.

===Positive airway pressure===
Positive airway pressure, initially in the form of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive sleep apnea coexists. CPAP requires the use during sleep of a machine that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of obstructive sleep apnea and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.

In some occasions, the oxygen levels are persistently too low (oxygen saturations below 90%). In that case, the hypoventilation itself may be improved by switching from CPAP treatment to an alternate device that delivers &quot;bi-level&quot; positive pressure: higher pressure during inspiration (breathing in) and a lower pressure during expiration (breathing out). If this too is ineffective in increasing oxygen levels, the addition of oxygen therapy may be necessary. As a last resort, tracheostomy may be necessary; this involves making a surgical opening in the trachea to bypass obesity-related airway obstruction in the neck. This may be combined with mechanical ventilation with an assisted breathing device through the opening.

===Other treatments===
People who fail first-line treatments or have very severe, life-threatening disease may sometimes be treated with tracheotomy, which is a reversible procedure. Treatments without proven benefit, and concern for harm, include oxygen alone or respiratory stimulant medications. Medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin, and acetazolamide are both associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and are not recommended.

==Prognosis==
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is associated with a reduced quality of life, and people with the condition incur increased healthcare costs, largely due to hospital admissions including observation and treatment on intensive care units. OHS often occurs together with several other disabling medical conditions, such as asthma (in 18–24%) and type 2 diabetes (in 30–32%). Its main complication of heart failure affects 21–32% of patients.

Those with abnormalities severe enough to warrant treatment have an increased risk of death reported to be 23% over 18 months and 46% over 50 months. This risk is reduced to less than 10% in those receiving treatment with PAP. Treatment also reduces the need for hospital admissions and reduces healthcare costs.

==Epidemiology==
The exact prevalence of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is unknown, and it is thought that many people with symptoms of OHS have not been diagnosed. About a third of all people with morbid obesity (a body mass index exceeding 40 kg/m2) have elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood.

When examining groups of people with obstructive sleep apnea, researchers have found that 10–20% of them meet the criteria for OHS as well. The risk of OHS is much higher in those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American Black people are more likely to be obese than American whites, and are therefore more likely to develop OHS, but obese Asians are more likely than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.

It is anticipated that rates of OHS will rise as the prevalence of obesity rises. This may also explain why OHS is more commonly reported in the United States, where obesity is more common than in other countries.

==History==
The discovery of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is generally attributed to the authors of a 1956 report of a professional poker player who, after gaining weight, became somnolent and fatigued and prone to fall asleep during the day, as well as developing edema of the legs suggesting heart failure. The authors coined the condition &quot;Pickwickian syndrome&quot; after the character Joe from Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club&quot; (1837), who was markedly obese and tended to fall asleep uncontrollably during the day. This report, however, was preceded by other descriptions of hypoventilation in obesity. In the 1960s, various further discoveries were made that led to the distinction between obstructive sleep apnea and sleep hypoventilation.

The term &quot;Pickwickian syndrome&quot; has fallen out of favor because it does not distinguish obesity hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea as separate disorders (which may coexist).

<text>Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common hereditary blood-clotting disorder in humans. An acquired form can sometimes result from other medical conditions. It arises from a deficiency in the quality or quantity of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion. It is known to affect several breeds of dogs as well as humans. The three forms of VWD are hereditary, acquired, and pseudo or platelet type. The three types of hereditary VWD are VWD type 1, VWD type 2, and VWD type 3. Type 2 contains various subtypes. Platelet type VWD is also an inherited condition.

In 2008 a new diagnostic category of &quot;Low VWF&quot; was proposed to include those individuals whose von Willebrand factor levels were in the 30–50 IU/dL range, below the normal reference range but not low enough to be von Willebrand disease. Patients with low VWF were sometimes noted to experience bleeding, despite mild reductions in VWF levels. The 2021 ASH/ISTH guidelines re-classified patients with levels in the 30–50 IU/dl range as &quot;Low VWF&quot; if they have no bleeding, but as having VWD if they have bleeding.

VWD type 1 is the most common type of the disorder, with mild bleeding symptoms such as nosebleeds, though occasionally more severe symptoms can occur. Blood type can affect the presentation and severity of symptoms of VWD.

VWD type 2 is the second most common type of the disorder and has mild to moderate symptoms.

The factor is named after the Finnish physician Erik Adolf von Willebrand who first described the condition in 1926. Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of VWD were updated in 2021.
==Signs and symptoms==
The various types of VWD present with varying degrees of bleeding tendency, usually in the form of easy bruising, nosebleeds, and bleeding gums. Women may experience heavy menstrual periods and blood loss during childbirth.

Severe internal bleeding and bleeding into joints are uncommon in all but the most severe type, VWD type 3.

==Genetics==
The VWF gene is located on the short arm &quot;p&quot; of chromosome 12 (12p13.2). It has 52 exons spanning 178 kbp. Types 1 and 2 are inherited as autosomal dominant traits. Occasionally, type 2 also inherits recessively. Type 3 is inherited as autosomal recessive. However, some individuals heterozygous for type 3 may be diagnosed with VWD type 1, indicating an intermediate inheritance in those cases. VWD occurs in approximately 1% of the population and affects men and women equally.

Genetic testing is typically not part of the initial workup for von Willebrand disease, and is not needed for people diagnosed with type 1 VWD based on clinical history and laboratory tests. It is mainly useful for:
* Evaluating family members of individuals who have known variants.
* Differentiating between type 2B and platelet-type VWD, as well as between type 2N VWD and hemophilia A.

==Pathophysiology==
Von Willebrand factor is mainly active in conditions of high blood flow and shear stress. Deficiency of VWF, therefore, shows primarily in organs with extensive small vessels, such as skin, gastrointestinal tract, and uterus. In angiodysplasia, a form of telangiectasia of the colon, shear stress is much higher than in average capillaries, and the risk of bleeding is increased concomitantly.

In more severe cases of type 1 VWD, genetic changes are common within the VWF gene and are highly penetrant. In milder cases of type 1 VWD, a complex spectrum of molecular pathology may exist in addition to polymorphisms of the VWF gene alone.

The individual&#x27;s ABO blood group can influence presentation and pathology of VWD. Those individuals with blood group O have a lower mean level than individuals with other blood groups. Unless ABO group-specific VWF:antigen reference ranges are used, normal group O individuals can be diagnosed as type I VWD, and some individuals of blood group AB with a genetic defect of VWF may have the diagnosis overlooked because VWF levels are elevated due to blood group.

==Diagnosis==
Basic tests performed in any patient with bleeding problems are a complete blood count-CBC (especially platelet counts), activated partial thromboplastin time-APTT, prothrombin time with International Normalized Ratio-PTINR, thrombin time-TT, and fibrinogen level. Patients with abnormal tests typically undergo further testing for hemophilias. Other coagulation factor assays may be performed depending on the results of a coagulation screen. Patients with von Willebrand disease typically display a normal prothrombin time and a variable prolongation of APTT, depending on whether sufficient VWF is available to perform its carrier function for factor VIII.

When VWD is suspected, blood plasma of a patient must be investigated for quantitative and qualitative deficiencies of VWF. This is achieved by measuring the amount of VWF in a VWF antigen assay and the functionality of VWF with a glycoprotein (GP)Ib binding assay, VWF antibody assay, or a ristocetin cofactor activity (RiCof) assay. Factor VIII levels are also performed because factor VIII is bound to VWF which protects the factor VIII from rapid breakdown within the blood. Deficiency of VWF can then lead to a reduction in factor VIII levels, which explains the elevation in PTT. Normal levels do not exclude all forms of VWD, particularly type 2, which may only be revealed by investigating platelet interaction with subendothelium under flow, a highly specialized coagulation study not routinely performed in most medical laboratories. Ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination (RIPA), collagen binding, and/or VWF multimer assays may be performed to follow up abnormal screening tests. A platelet aggregation assay will show an abnormal response to ristocetin with normal responses to the other agonists used:

A platelet function assay may give an abnormal collagen/epinephrine closure time, and in most cases, a normal collagen/ADP time. Type 2N may be considered if factor VIII levels are disproportionately low, but confirmation requires a &quot;factor VIII binding&quot; assay. Additional laboratory tests that help classify sub-types of VWD include von Willebrand multimer analysis, modified ristocetin induced platelet aggregation assay and VWF propeptide to VWF propeptide antigen ratio. In cases of suspected acquired von Willebrand syndrome, a mixing study (analysis of patient plasma along with pooled normal plasma/PNP and a mixture of the two tested immediately, at one hour, and at two hours) should be performed. Detection of VWD is complicated by VWF being an acute-phase reactant with levels rising in infection, pregnancy, and stress.

The testing for VWD can be influenced by laboratory procedures. Numerous variables exist in the testing procedure that may affect the validity of the test results and may result in a missed or erroneous diagnosis. The chance of procedural errors are typically greatest during the preanalytical phase (during collecting storage and transportation of the specimen) especially when the testing is contracted to an outside facility and the specimen is frozen and transported long distances. Diagnostic errors are not uncommon, and the rate of testing proficiency varies amongst laboratories, with error rates ranging from 7 to 22% in some studies to as high as 60% in cases of misclassification of VWD subtype. To increase the probability of a proper diagnosis, testing should be done at a facility with immediate on-site processing in a specialized coagulation laboratory.

===Types===

The four hereditary types of VWD described are type 1, type 2, type 3, and pseudo- or platelet-type. Most cases are hereditary, but acquired forms of VWD have been described. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis&#x27;s classification depends on the definition of qualitative and quantitative defects.
====Type 1====
Type 1 VWD (40-80% of all VWD cases) is a quantitative defect which is heterozygous for the defective gene. It arises from failure to secrete VWF into the circulation or, in the case of Type 1C, from VWF being cleared more quickly than normal. If VWF levels are greater than 50%, VWD can be ruled out. If VWF activity is below 30%, VWD is present. Patients with VWF activity between 0.30-0.50 IU/mL are classified based on their bleeding phenotype. If they have bleeding symptoms, they have VWD. If they have no bleeding, they are considered to have &quot;Low VWF&quot;.

Many patients are asymptomatic or may have mild symptoms and not have clearly impaired clotting, which might suggest a bleeding disorder. Often, the discovery of low VWF occurs incidentally to other medical procedures requiring a blood work-up. Most cases of low VWF are never diagnosed due to its asymptomatic or mild presentation, and most people with type I VWD end up leading a normal life free of complications, with many being unaware that they have the disorder.

Trouble may, however, arise in some patients in the form of bleeding following surgery (including dental procedures), noticeable easy bruising, or menorrhagia (heavy menstrual periods). The minority of cases of type 1 may present with severe hemorrhagic symptoms.

====Type 1C====
Type 1C VWD indicates patients with quantitative deficiency due to an enhanced VWF clearance, accounting for ~15% to 20% of cases. Such patients may require VWF concentrate to treat/prevent bleeds.

====Type 2====
Type 2 VWD (15-50% of cases) is a qualitative defect and the bleeding tendency can vary between individuals. Four subtypes exist: 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N. These subtypes depend on the presence and behavior of the underlying multimers. Type 2 VWD (other than 2N) features an activity-to-antigen ratio of less than 0.7. This ratio is obtained by dividing the VWF activity by the VWF antigen.

=====Type 2A=====
VWD Type 2A results from a loss-of-function mutation in von Willebrand factor (VWF), leading to reduced binding of VWF with Platelet GP1b receptors. This disorder follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with only occasional cases following autosomal recessive pattern. It accounts for 10-15% of all VWD cases. It manifests with moderate to moderately severe bleeding. Diagnostic features of VWD Type 2A include greater reduction in VWF activity (measured by a functional assay) compared to VWF antigen (quantity). This results in a decreased VWF Activity to Antigen ratio. Additionally, high molecular weight multimers are either absent or very low on electrophoresis due to impaired multimer assembly or increased susceptibility to ADAMTS13 (a protease that cleaves VWF). Factor VIII activity can be normal or low. Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) is typically low.

=====Type 2B=====
This is a &quot;gain of function&quot; defect. The ability of the qualitatively defective VWF to bind to glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) receptor on the platelet membrane is abnormally enhanced, leading to its spontaneous binding to platelets and subsequent rapid clearance of the bound platelets and of the large VWF multimers. Thrombocytopenia may occur. Large VWF multimers are reduced or absent from the circulation.

The ristocetin cofactor activity is low when the patient&#x27;s platelet-poor plasma is assayed against formalin-fixed, normal donor platelets. However, when the assay is performed with the patient&#x27;s own platelets (platelet-rich plasma), a lower-than-normal amount of ristocetin causes aggregation to occur. This is due to the large VWF multimers remaining bound to the patient&#x27;s platelets. Patients with this subtype are unable to use desmopressin as a treatment for bleeding, because it can lead to unwanted platelet aggregation and aggravation of thrombocytopenia.

=====Type 2M=====
VWD Type 2M results from a loss-of-function mutation in von Willebrand factor (VWF). This mutation leads to reduced binding of VWF with GP1b (similar to VWD Type 2A) or with collagen. Like other Type 2 VWD subtypes, there is a decreased ratio of VWF Activity to antigen. Differentiating VWD Type 2M from Type 2A involves analyzing VWF multimers through electrophoresis. In VWD Type 2M, all multimers are identified but uniformly decreased in quantity, resembling the pattern seen in VWD Type 1. Conversely, in VWD Type 2A, high molecular weight multimers are either absent or present in very low quantities. VWD Type 2M can be further differentiated from VWD Type 1 based on the VWF Activity to antigen ratio. In Type 1, the ratio is &gt;0.7. In Type 2M, the ratio is &lt;0.7. In Type 2M, factor VIII activity can be normal or low while the ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) is typically low. It is uncommon and manifests with moderate to severe bleeding. The disease may follow either an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance.

=====Type 2N (Normandy)=====
Type 2N VWD results from a loss-of-function mutation that reduces the binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to factor VIII. Although VWF antigen (quantity) and activity levels (Ristocetin cofactor assay) remain normal, factor VIII levels are typically low (usually 5-15%) due to impaired VWF binding. This vulnerability to proteolysis in the circulation leads to clinical manifestations resembling those of Hemophilia A. The significantly reduced factor VIII levels in VWD Type 2N can sometimes lead to misdiagnosis as mild Hemophilia A. Like Hemophilia A, VWD Type 2N presents with joint and soft tissue bleeds. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, requiring either homozygosity or double heterozygosity for disease manifestation. Diagnostic tools include assessing the ratio of VWF binding to VWF antigen levels. A ratio &lt;0.3 indicates homozygous or double heterozygous VWD Type 2N, while a ratio &lt;0.5 suggests heterozygous VWD Type 2N. Conversely, a VWF antigen-to-binding ratio &gt;3 confirms the diagnosis of VWD Type 2N. Ristocetin-Induced Platelet Agglutination (RIPA) and VWF multimer analysis are typically normal.

====Type 3====
VWD type 3 is a rare but the most severe form of VWD. It occurs in individuals who are homozygous for the defective gene, resulting in a severe quantitative deficiency or complete absence of von Willebrand factor (VWF) production. In VWD type 3, VWF is undetectable in the VWF antigen assay. Since VWF normally protects coagulation factor VIII from proteolytic degradation, the total absence of VWF leads to extremely low factor VIII levels (typically 1-10%). These low levels are equivalent to those seen in severe hemophilia A, with clinical manifestations of life-threatening external and internal hemorrhages. The inheritance pattern of VWD type 3 is autosomal recessive, meaning that both parents must carry the defective gene for their child to be affected. In contrast, hemophilia A follows an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. Additional diagnostic tools for VWD type 3 include assessing VWF activity using the Ristocetin cofactor assay and Collagen binding assay. In VWD type 3, VWF activity is either absent or approaching undetectable. VWF multimer analysis reveals no bands or very faint bands on electrophoresis. Additionally, Ristocetin-Induced Platelet Agglutination (RIPA) is typically absent or severely low.

====Comparison====
====Platelet-type====

Platelet-type VWD (also known as pseudo-VWD) is an autosomal dominant genetic defect of the platelets. The VWF is qualitatively normal and genetic testing of the von Willebrand gene and VWF protein reveals no mutational alteration. The defect lies in the qualitatively altered GPIb receptor on the platelet membrane which increases its affinity to bind to the VWF. Large platelet aggregates and high molecular weight VWF multimers are removed from the circulation resulting in thrombocytopenia and diminished or absent large VWF multimers. The ristocetin cofactor activity and loss of large VWF multimers are similar to VWD type 2B.

====Acquired====
Acquired Von Willebrand syndrome can occur due to autoantibodies,
either interfering with platelet or collagen binding;
increasing VWF clearance from the plasma; adsorption to
myeloma cells or platelets; or proteolytic cleavage of VWF after shear stress-induced unfolding.

A form of acquired VWD occurs in patients with aortic valve stenosis, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding (Heyde&#x27;s syndrome). This form of acquired VWD may be more prevalent than is presently thought. In 2003, Vincentelli &quot;et al.&quot; noted that patients with acquired VWD and aortic stenosis who underwent valve replacement experienced a correction of their hemostatic abnormalities, but that the hemostatic abnormalities can recur after 6 months when the prosthetic valve is a poor match with the patient.
Similarly, acquired VWD contributes to the bleeding tendency in people with an implant of a left ventricular assist device (a pump that pumps blood from the left ventricle of the heart into the aorta).

==Treatment==
For patients with VWD type 1 and VWD type 2A, desmopressin is available as different preparations, recommended for use in cases of minor trauma, or in preparation for dental or minor surgical procedures. Desmopressin stimulates the release of VWF from the Weibel–Palade bodies of endothelial cells, thereby increasing the levels of VWF (as well as coagulant factor VIII) three- to five-fold. Desmopressin is also available as a preparation for intranasal administration (Stimate) and as a preparation for intravenous administration. Desmopressin is contraindicated in VWD type 2b because of the risk of aggravated thrombocytopenia and thrombotic complications. Desmopressin is probably not effective in VWD type 2M and is rarely effective in VWD type 2N. It is totally ineffective in VWD type 3.

For women with heavy menstrual bleeding, estrogen-containing oral contraceptive medications are effective in reducing the frequency and duration of the menstrual periods. Estrogen and progesterone compounds available for use in the correction of menorrhagia include ethinylestradiol,levonorgestrel, drospirenone and cyproterone. Administration of ethinylestradiol diminishes the secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone from the pituitary, leading to stabilization of the endometrial surface of the uterus.

Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of the natural antidiuretic hormone vasopressin. Its overuse can lead to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia with consequent convulsion.

For patients with VWD scheduled for surgery and cases of VWD disease complicated by clinically significant hemorrhage, human-derived medium purity factor VIII concentrates, which also contain von Willebrand factors, are available for prophylaxis and treatment. Humate P, Alphanate, Wilate and Koate HP are commercially available for prophylaxis and treatment of VWD, and have varying levels of factor VIII. Products with higher VWF:RCo/FVIII ratios allow for more frequent dosing of VWF if needed, without the risk of accumulation to supranormal levels of FVIII. Recombinant factor VIII products contain insignificant quantity of VWF, so are not clinically useful as standalone therapy for VWD.

Risks of thrombosis, development of alloantibodies, and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis must be considered when administering these preparations. Such risks have emerged as the main concerns in factor replacement therapies as infectious risks have diminished.

Blood transfusions are given as needed to correct anemia and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia. Infusion of platelet concentrates is recommended for correction of hemorrhage associated with platelet-type VWD.

Vonicog alfa is a recombinant von Willebrand factor that was approved for use in the United States in December 2015, and for use in the European Union in August 2018. If baseline factor VIII activity is &gt;40%, rVWF may be administered as a standalone product when immediate response is needed, but if Factor VIII activity is &lt;40% and immediate response is needed, rVWF must be administered in conjunction with FVIII replacement therapy.

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of VWD is about one in 100 individuals. However, the majority of these people do not have symptoms. The prevalence of clinically significant cases is one per 10,000. Because most forms are rather mild, they are detected more often in women, whose bleeding tendency shows during menstruation. It may be more severe or apparent in people with blood type O.

==History==

In 1924, a 5-year-old girl from Föglö, Åland, Finland, was brought to the Deaconess Hospital in Helsinki, where she was seen by Finnish physician Erik Adolf von Willebrand. He ultimately assessed 66 members of her family and reported in a 1926 Swedish-language article that this was a previously undescribed bleeding disorder that differed from hemophilia. He published another article on the disorder in 1931, in the German language, which attracted international attention in the disease. The eponymous name was assigned to the disease between the late 1930s and the early 1940s, in recognition of von Willebrand&#x27;s extensive research.

In the 1950s, it became clear that a &quot;plasma factor&quot;, factor VIII, was decreased in these persons and that Cohn fraction I-0 could correct both the plasma deficiency of FVIII and the prolonged bleeding time. Since this time, the factor causing the long bleeding time was called the &quot;von Willebrand factor&quot; in honor of Erik Adolf von Willebrand.

Variant forms of VWF were recognized in the 1970s, and these variations are now recognized as the result of synthesis of an abnormal protein. During the 1980s, molecular and cellular studies distinguished hemophilia A and VWD more precisely. Persons who had VWD had a normal FVIII gene on the X chromosome, and some had an abnormal VWF gene on chromosome 12. Gene sequencing identified many of these persons as having a VWF gene mutation. The genetic causes of milder forms of low VWF are still under investigation, and these forms may not always be caused by an abnormal VWF gene.

==Other animals==
VWD can also affect dogs, pigs, and mice. Furthermore, cases have been reported in cats, horses, cattle, and rabbits.

The causal mutation for VWD type 1 was identified in dogs of the breeds Doberman Pinscher, German Pinscher, Bernese Mountain Dog, Manchester Terrier, Kerry Blue Terrier, Cardigan Welsh Corgi, Poodle, Coton de Tulear, Drentse Patrijshond, Papillon, and Stabyhoun. Causal mutations for type 2 were identified in dogs of the breeds German Wirehaired Pointer, German Shorthaired Pointer, and Chinese Crested; and for type 3 in dogs of the breeds
Kooikerhondje, Scottish Terrier and Shetland Sheepdog. In dogs affected by type 1 VWD, the causal mutation was the same across all breeds and the same mutation was also detected in some human VWD type 1 patients. In contrast, the mutations causing VWD type 3 in dogs are specific to each breed. Genetic screening is offered for known breeds.

In pigs, the causal mutation for VWD type 3 has also been identified. It is a large duplication within the VWF gene and causes serious damage to the gene function, so that virtually no VWF protein is produced. The clinical picture in pigs is most similar to that in humans with VWD type 3. Therefore, those pigs are valuable models for clinical and pharmacological research.

Mice affected by VWD type 3 were produced by genetic engineering to obtain a small sized model for the human disease. In these strains, the VWF gene has been knocked out.

In animals of other species affected by VWD, the causal mutations have not yet been identified.

== Oral manifestations ==
In the case of severe deficiency, there may be spontaneous gingival bleeding, ecchymosis, and epistaxis. Symptoms of VWD include postoperative bleeding, bleeding after dental extraction, gingival bleeding, epistaxis and easy bruising. The intake of oral contraceptives as the first-line treatment for menorrhagia may lead to gingival enlargement and bleeding in women.

Platelet or coagulation disorders with severely altered hemostasis can cause spontaneous gingival bleeding, as seen in conjunction with hyperplastic hyperemic gingival enlargements in leukemic patients. Deposition of hemosiderin and other blood degradation products on the tooth surfaces turning them brown can occur with continuous oral bleeding over long periods.

The location of oral bleeds was as follows: labial frenum, 60%; tongue, 23%; buccal mucosa, 17% and gingiva and palate, 0.5%. Severe hemophilia will have most frequent bleeding occurrences, followed by moderate and then mild hemophilia. They mostly come from traumatic injuries. Bleeding will also be induced by iatrogenic factors and poor oral hygiene practices. The frequency of oral hemorrhage by location in people with deficiency of F VIII and F IX is: gingiva, 64%; dental pulp, 13%; tongue, 7.5%; lip, 7%; palate, 2% and buccal mucosa, 1%.

== Dental considerations ==
The protocols suggest the use of factor concentrate along with the use of local hemostatic techniques, such as suturing, and local measures, such as the use of oxidized cellulose, for example, Surgicel or fibrin glue in conjunction with post-operatively administered antifibrinolytic agents where appropriate.

The use of any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) must be discussed beforehand with the patient&#x27;s hematologist because of their effect on platelet aggregation. There are no restrictions regarding the type of local anaesthetic agent used although those with vasoconstrictors may provide additional local hemostasis.

<doc id="311438" wikidata="Q1784680" url="?curid=311438" title="Korotkoff sounds">
<text>Korotkoff sounds are the sounds that medical personnel listen for when they are taking blood pressure using a non-invasive procedure. They are named after Nikolai Korotkov, a Russian physician who discovered them in 1905, when he was working at the Imperial Medical Academy in St. Petersburg, the Russian Empire.

== Description ==
The sounds heard during the measurement of blood pressure are not the same as the heart sounds heard during chest auscultation that are due to vibrations inside the ventricles associated with the snapping shut of the valves. If a stethoscope is placed over the brachial artery in the antecubital fossa in a normal person (without arterial disease), no sound should be audible. As the heart beats, these pulses are transmitted smoothly via laminar (non-turbulent) blood flow throughout the arteries, and no sound is produced. Similarly, if the cuff of a sphygmomanometer is placed around a patient&#x27;s upper arm and inflated to a pressure above the patient&#x27;s systolic blood pressure, there will be no sound audible. This is because the pressure in the cuff is high enough such that it completely occludes the blood flow. This is similar to a flexible tube or pipe with fluid in it that is being pinched shut.

If the pressure is dropped to a level equal to that of the patient&#x27;s systolic blood pressure, the first Korotkoff sound will be heard. As the pressure in the cuff is the same as the pressure produced by the heart, some blood will be able to pass through the upper arm when the pressure in the artery rises during systole. This blood flows in spurts as the pressure in the artery rises above the pressure in the cuff and then drops back down beyond the cuffed region, resulting in turbulence that produces an audible sound.

As the pressure in the cuff is allowed to fall further, thumping sounds continue to be heard as long as the pressure in the cuff is between the systolic and diastolic pressures, as the arterial pressure keeps on rising above and dropping back below the pressure in the cuff.

Eventually, as the pressure in the cuff drops further, the sounds change in quality, then become muted, and finally disappear altogether. This occurs because, as the pressure in the cuff drops below the diastolic blood pressure, the cuff no longer provides any restriction to blood flow allowing the blood flow to become smooth again with no turbulence and thus produce no further audible sound.

It has been suggested that the mechanism of Korotkoff sounds may not be a sound waves at all, but vibrations of the arterial walls that transmits into surrounding tissues, a bit like seismic waves. Others have hypothesized that the Korotkoff sounds are due to cavitation 

==The five Korotkoff sounds==
There are five Korotkoff sounds:
# Phase I: The first appearance of faint, repetitive, clear tapping sounds which gradually increase in intensity for at least two consecutive beats is the systolic blood pressure.
# Phase II: A brief period may follow during which the sounds soften and acquire a .
# Phase III: The return of sharper sounds, which become crisper to regain, or even exceed, the intensity of Phase I sounds.
# Phase IV: The distinct abrupt muffling of sounds, which become soft and blowing in quality.
# Phase V: The point at which all sounds finally disappear completely is the diastolic pressure.

The second and third Korotkoff sounds have no known clinical significance.

In some patients, sounds may disappear altogether for a short time between Phase II and III, which is referred to as auscultatory gap.

==Systolic and diastolic blood pressure==
Traditionally, the systolic blood pressure is taken to be the pressure at which the first Korotkoff sound is first heard and the diastolic blood pressure is the pressure at which the fourth Korotkoff sound is just barely audible. However, there has recently been a move towards the use of the fifth Korotkoff sound (i.e. silence) as the diastolic blood pressure, as this has been felt to be more reproducible.

For paediatrics, there has been controversy regarding whether to use auscultation of the fourth or fifth Korotkoff sound as an indicator of diastolic pressure. Current clinical practice guidelines recommend using the fifth Korotkoff sound (but if this is undetectable, using the fourth).

The time average of the first Korotkoff sound represents a reliable pressure marker of systole of the heart. The time average of the fourth Korotkoff sound represents a reliable pressure marker of diastole of the heart.

<doc id="311439" wikidata="Q235684" url="?curid=311439" title="Common year starting on Tuesday">
<text>A common year starting on Tuesday is any non-leap year (i.e. a year with 365 days) that begins on Tuesday, 1 January, and ends on Tuesday, 31 December. Its dominical letter hence is F. The most recent year of such kind was 2019, and the next one will be 2030, or, likewise, 2025 and 2031 in the obsolete Julian calendar, see below for more.

Any common year that starts on Tuesday has two Friday the 13ths: those two in this common year occur in September and December. Leap years starting on Monday share this characteristic. From July of the year preceding this year until September in this type of year is the longest period (14 months) that occurs without a Friday the 13th. Leap years starting on Saturday share this characteristic, from August of the common year that precedes it to October in that type of year.

== Calendars ==

== Applicable years ==

=== Gregorian Calendar ===
In the (currently used) Gregorian calendar, along with Thursday, the fourteen types of year (seven common, seven leap) repeat in a 400-year cycle (20871 weeks). Forty-four common years per cycle or exactly 11% start on a Tuesday. The 28-year sub-cycle only spans across century years divisible by 400, e.g. 1600, 2000, and 2400.

=== Julian Calendar ===
In the now-obsolete Julian calendar, the fourteen types of year (seven common, seven leap) repeat in a 28-year cycle (1461 weeks). A leap year has two adjoining dominical letters (one for January and February and the other for March to December in the Church of England as 29 February has no letter). Each of the seven two-letter sequences occurs once within a cycle, and every common letter thrice.

As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e. 25 cycles. The year&#x27;s position in the cycle is given by the formula ((year + 8) mod 28) + 1). Years 7, 18 and 24 of the cycle are common years beginning on Tuesday. 2017 is year 10 of the cycle. Approximately 10.71% of all years are common years beginning on Tuesday.

<text>A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in humans and other mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the Latin word &quot;mamma&quot;, &quot;breast&quot;. The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, sheep, and deer), and the of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals, lactation, the production of enough milk for , occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur. With humans, male lactation can occur only under specific circumstances.

Mammals are divided into 3 groups: prototherians, metatherians, and eutherians. In the case of prototherians, both males and females have functional mammary glands, but their mammary glands are without nipples. These mammary glands are modified sebaceous glands. Concerning most metatherians and eutherians, only females have functional mammary glands, with the exception of some bat species. Their mammary glands can be termed as breasts or udders. In the case of breasts, each mammary gland has its own nipple (e.g., human mammary glands). In the case of udders, pairs of mammary glands comprise a single mass, with more than one nipple (or teat) hanging from it. For instance, cows and buffalo udders have two pairs of mammary glands and four teats, whereas sheep and goat udders have one pair of mammary glands with two teats protruding from the udder. Each gland produces milk for a single teat. These mammary glands are evolutionarily derived from sweat glands.

==Structure==
The basic components of a mature mammary gland are the &quot;alveoli&quot; (hollow cavities, a few millimeters large), which are lined with milk-secreting cuboidal cells and surrounded by myoepithelial cells. These alveoli join to form groups known as &quot;lobules&quot;. Each lobule has a &quot;lactiferous duct&quot; that drains into openings in the nipple. The myoepithelial cells contract under the stimulation of oxytocin, excreting the milk secreted by alveolar units into the lobule lumen toward the nipple. As the infant begins to suck, the oxytocin-mediated &quot;let down reflex&quot; ensues, and the mother&#x27;s milk is secreted—not sucked—from the gland into the infant&#x27;s mouth.

All the milk-secreting tissue leading to a single lactiferous duct is collectively called a &quot;simple mammary gland&quot;; in a &quot;complex mammary gland&quot;, all the simple mammary glands serve one nipple. Humans normally have two complex mammary glands, one in each breast, and each complex mammary gland consists of 10–20 simple glands. The opening of each simple gland on the surface of the nipple is called a &quot;pore.&quot; The presence of more than two nipples is known as polythelia and the presence of more than two complex mammary glands as polymastia.

Maintaining the correct polarized morphology of the lactiferous duct tree requires another essential component – mammary epithelial cells extracellular matrix (ECM) which, together with adipocytes, fibroblast, inflammatory cells, and others, constitute mammary stroma. Mammary epithelial ECM mainly contains myoepithelial basement membrane and the connective tissue. They not only help to support mammary basic structure, but also serve as a communicating bridge between mammary epithelia and their local and global environment throughout this organ&#x27;s development.

===Histology===
A mammary gland is a specific type of apocrine gland specialized for manufacture of colostrum (first milk) when giving birth. Mammary glands can be identified as apocrine because they exhibit striking &quot;decapitation&quot; secretion. Many sources assert that mammary glands are modified sweat glands.

==Development==

Mammary glands develop during different growth cycles. They exist in both sexes during the embryonic stage, forming only a rudimentary duct tree at birth. In this stage, mammary gland development depends on systemic (and maternal) hormones, but is also under the (local) regulation of paracrine communication between neighboring epithelial and mesenchymal cells by parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). This locally secreted factor gives rise to a series of outside-in and inside-out positive feedback between these two types of cells, so that mammary bud epithelial cells can proliferate and sprout down into the mesenchymal layer until they reach the fat pad to begin the first round of branching. At the same time, the embryonic mesenchymal cells around the epithelial bud receive secreting factors activated by PTHrP, such as BMP4. These mesenchymal cells can transform into a dense, mammary-specific mesenchyme, which later develop into connective tissue with fibrous threads, forming blood vessels and the lymph system. A basement membrane, mainly containing laminin and collagen, formed afterward by differentiated myoepithelial cells, keeps the polarity of this primary duct tree. These components of the extracellular matrix are strong determinants of duct morphogenesis.

===Biochemistry===
Estrogen and growth hormone (GH) are essential for the ductal component of mammary gland development, and act synergistically to mediate it. Neither estrogen nor GH are capable of inducing ductal development without the other. The role of GH in ductal development has been found to be mostly mediated by its induction of the secretion of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which occurs both systemically (mainly originating from the liver) and locally in the mammary fat pad through activation of the growth hormone receptor (GHR). However, GH itself also acts independently of IGF-1 to stimulate ductal development by upregulating estrogen receptor (ER) expression in mammary gland tissue, which is a downstream effect of mammary gland GHR activation. In any case, unlike IGF-1, GH itself is not essential for mammary gland development, and IGF-1 in conjunction with estrogen can induce normal mammary gland development without the presence of GH. In addition to IGF-1, other paracrine growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), amphiregulin, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are involved in breast development as mediators downstream to sex hormones and GH/IGF-1.

During embryonic development, IGF-1 levels are low, and gradually increase from birth to puberty. At puberty, the levels of GH and IGF-1 reach their highest levels in life and estrogen begins to be secreted in high amounts in females, which is when ductal development mostly takes place. Under the influence of estrogen, stromal and fat tissue surrounding the ductal system in the mammary glands also grows. After puberty, GH and IGF-1 levels progressively decrease, which limits further development until pregnancy, if it occurs. During pregnancy, progesterone and prolactin are essential for mediating lobuloalveolar development in estrogen-primed mammary gland tissue, which occurs in preparation of lactation and nursing.

Androgens such as testosterone inhibit estrogen-mediated mammary gland development (e.g., by reducing local ER expression) through activation of androgen receptors expressed in mammary gland tissue, and in conjunction with relatively low estrogen levels, are the cause of the lack of developed mammary glands in males.

===Timeline===

====Before birth====
Mammary gland development is characterized by the unique process by which the epithelium invades the stroma. The development of the mammary gland occurs mainly after birth. During puberty, tubule formation is coupled with branching morphogenesis which establishes the basic arboreal network of ducts emanating from the nipple.

Developmentally, mammary gland epithelium is constantly produced and maintained by rare epithelial cells, dubbed as mammary progenitors which are ultimately thought to be derived from tissue-resident stem cells.

Embryonic mammary gland development can be divided into a series of specific stages. Initially, the formation of the milk lines that run between the fore and hind limbs bilaterally on each side of the midline occurs around embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). The second stage occurs at E11.5 when placode formation begins along the mammary milk line. This will eventually give rise to the nipple. Lastly, the third stage occurs at E12.5 and involves the invagination of cells within the placode into the mesenchyme, leading to a mammary anlage (biology).

The primitive (stem) cells are detected in embryo and their numbers increase steadily during development

====Growth====
Postnatally, the mammary ducts elongate into the mammary fat pad. Then, starting around four weeks of age, mammary ductal growth increases significantly with the ducts invading towards the lymph node. Terminal end buds, the highly proliferative structures found at the tips of the invading ducts, expand and increase greatly during this stage. This developmental period is characterized by the emergence of the terminal end buds and lasts until an age of about 7–8 weeks.

By the pubertal stage, the mammary ducts have invaded to the end of the mammary fat pad. At this point, the terminal end buds become less proliferative and decrease in size. Side branches form from the primary ducts and begin to fill the mammary fat pad. Ductal development decreases with the arrival of sexual maturity and undergoes estrous cycles (proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus). As a result of estrous cycling, the mammary gland undergoes dynamic changes where cells proliferate and then regress in an ordered fashion.

====Pregnancy====
During pregnancy, the ductal systems undergo rapid proliferation and form alveolar structures within the branches to be used for milk production. After delivery, lactation occurs within the mammary gland; lactation involves the secretion of milk by the luminal cells in the alveoli. Contraction of the myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli will cause the milk to be ejected through the ducts and into the nipple for the nursing infant. Upon weaning of the infant, lactation stops and the mammary gland turns in on itself, a process called &quot;involution&quot;. This process involves the controlled collapse of mammary epithelial cells where cells begin apoptosis in a controlled manner, reverting the mammary gland back to a pubertal state.

====Postmenopausal====
During postmenopause, due to much lower levels of estrogen, and due to lower levels of GH and IGF-1, which decrease with age, mammary gland tissue atrophies and the mammary glands become smaller.

==Physiology==

===Hormonal control===
Lactiferous duct development occurs in females in response to circulating hormones. First development is frequently seen during pre- and postnatal stages, and later during puberty. Estrogen promotes branching differentiation, whereas in males testosterone inhibits it. A mature duct tree reaching the limit of the fat pad of the mammary gland comes into being by bifurcation of duct terminal end buds (TEB), secondary branches sprouting from primary ducts and proper duct lumen formation. These processes are tightly modulated by components of mammary epithelial ECM interacting with systemic hormones and local secreting factors. However, for each mechanism the epithelial cells&#x27; &quot;niche&quot; can be delicately unique with different membrane receptor profiles and basement membrane thickness from specific branching area to area, so as to regulate cell growth or differentiation sub-locally. Important players include beta-1 integrin, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), laminin-1/5, collagen-IV, matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and others. Elevated circulating level of growth hormone and estrogen get to multipotent cap cells on TEB tips through a thin, leaky layer of basement membrane. These hormones promote specific gene expression. Hence cap cells can differentiate into myoepithelial and luminal (duct) epithelial cells, and the increased amount of activated MMPs can degrade surrounding ECM helping duct buds to reach further in the fat pads. On the other hand, basement membrane along the mature mammary ducts is thicker, with strong adhesion to epithelial cells via binding to integrin and non-integrin receptors. When side branches develop, it is a much more &quot;pushing-forward&quot; working process including extending through myoepithelial cells, degrading basement membrane and then invading into a periductal layer of fibrous stromal tissue. Degraded basement membrane fragments (laminin-5) roles to lead the way of mammary epithelial cells migration. Whereas, laminin-1 interacts with non-integrin receptor dystroglycan negatively regulates this side branching process in case of cancer. These complex &quot;Yin-yang&quot; balancing crosstalks between mammary ECM and epithelial cells &quot;instruct&quot; healthy mammary gland development until adult.

There is preliminary evidence that soybean intake mildly stimulates the breast glands in pre- and postmenopausal women.

===Pregnancy===
Secretory alveoli develop mainly in pregnancy, when rising levels of prolactin, estrogen, and progesterone cause further branching, together with an increase in adipose tissue and a richer blood flow. In gestation, serum progesterone remains at a stably high concentration so signaling through its receptor is continuously activated. As one of the transcribed genes, Wnts secreted from mammary epithelial cells act paracrinely to induce more neighboring cells&#x27; branching. When the lactiferous duct tree is almost ready, &quot;leaves&quot; alveoli are differentiated from luminal epithelial cells and added at the end of each branch. In late pregnancy and for the first few days after giving birth, colostrum is secreted. Milk secretion (lactation) begins a few days later due to reduction in circulating progesterone and the presence of another important hormone prolactin, which mediates further alveologenesis, milk protein production, and regulates osmotic balance and tight junction function. Laminin and collagen in myoepithelial basement membrane interacting with beta-1 integrin on epithelial surface again, is essential in this process. Their binding ensures correct placement of prolactin receptors on the basal lateral side of alveoli cells and directional secretion of milk into lactiferous ducts. Suckling of the baby causes release of the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates contraction of the myoepithelial cells. In this combined control from ECM and systemic hormones, milk secretion can be reciprocally amplified so as to provide enough nutrition for the baby.

===Weaning===
During weaning, decreased prolactin, missing mechanical stimulation (baby suckling), and changes in osmotic balance caused by milk stasis and leaking of tight junctions cause cessation of milk production. It is the (passive) process of a child or animal ceasing to be dependent on the mother for nourishment. In some species there is complete or partial involution of alveolar structures after weaning, in humans there is only partial involution and the level of involution in humans appears to be highly individual. The glands in the breast do secrete fluid also in nonlactating women. In some other species (such as cows), all alveoli and secretory duct structures collapse by programmed cell death (apoptosis) and autophagy for lack of growth promoting factors either from the ECM or circulating hormones. At the same time, apoptosis of blood capillary endothelial cells speeds up the regression of lactation ductal beds. Shrinkage of the mammary duct tree and ECM remodeling by various proteinase is under the control of somatostatin and other growth inhibiting hormones and local factors. This major structural change leads loose fat tissue to fill the empty space afterward. But a functional lactiferous duct tree can be formed again when a female is pregnant again.

==Clinical significance==
Tumorigenesis in mammary glands can be induced biochemically by abnormal expression level of circulating hormones or local ECM components, or from a mechanical change in the tension of mammary stroma. Under either of the two circumstances, mammary epithelial cells would grow out of control and eventually result in cancer. Almost all instances of breast cancer originate in the lobules or ducts of the mammary glands.

==Other mammals==

===General===
The breasts of female humans vary from most other mammals that tend to have less conspicuous mammary glands. The number and positioning of mammary glands varies widely in different mammals. The protruding teats and accompanying glands can be located anywhere along the two milk lines. In general most mammals develop mammary glands in pairs along these lines, with a number approximating the number of young typically birthed at a time. The number of teats varies from 2 (in most primates) to 18 (in pigs). The Virginia opossum has 13, one of the few mammals with an odd number. The following table lists the number and position of teats and glands found in a range of mammals:

Male mammals typically have rudimentary mammary glands and nipples, with a few exceptions: male mice do not have nipples, male marsupials do not have mammary glands, and male horses lack nipples. The male dayak fruit bat has lactating mammary glands. Male lactation occurs infrequently in some species.

Mammary glands are true protein factories, and several labs have constructed transgenic animals, mainly goats and cows, to produce proteins for pharmaceutical use. Complex glycoproteins such as monoclonal antibodies or antithrombin cannot be produced by genetically engineered bacteria, and the production in live mammals is much cheaper than the use of mammalian cell cultures.

===Evolution===

There are many theories on how mammary glands evolved. For example, it is thought that the mammary gland is a transformed sweat gland, more closely related to apocrine sweat glands. Because mammary glands do not fossilize well, supporting such theories with fossil evidence is difficult. Many of the current theories are based on comparisons between lines of living mammals—monotremes, marsupials, and eutherians. One theory proposes that mammary glands evolved from glands that were used to keep the eggs of early mammals moist and free from infection (monotremes still lay eggs). Other theories suggest that early secretions were used directly by hatched young, or that the secretions were used by young to help them orient to their mothers.

Lactation is thought to have developed long before the evolution of the mammary gland and mammals; see evolution of lactation.

<text>Data rate and data transfer rate can refer to several related and overlapping concepts in communications networks:

==Achieved rate==
* Bit rate, the number of bits that are conveyed or processed per unit of time
** Data signaling rate or gross bit rate, a bit rate that includes protocol overhead
* Symbol rate or baud rate, the number of symbol changes, waveform changes, or signaling events across the transmission medium per unit of time
* Data-rate units, measures of the bit rate or baud rate of a link
* Data transfer rate (disk drive), a data rate specific to disk drive operations
* Throughput, the rate of successful message delivery, or level of bandwidth consumption
* Transfers per second

==Capacity==
* Bandwidth (computing), the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path
* Channel capacity, an information-theoretic upper bound on the rate at which data can be reliably transmitted, given noise on a channel</text><links>

<text>Prince of Darkness is a 1987 American supernatural horror film, written, co-scored and directed by John Carpenter, and starring Donald Pleasence, Victor Wong, Jameson Parker, and Lisa Blount. The second installment in what Carpenter calls his &quot;Apocalypse Trilogy&quot;—which began with &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982) and concludes with &quot;In the Mouth of Madness&quot; (1994)—the film follows a group of quantum physics students in Los Angeles who are asked to assist a Catholic priest in investigating an ancient cylinder of liquid discovered in a monastery, which they come to find is a sentient, liquid embodiment of Satan.

==Plot==
Centuries ago, in the Middle East, The Brotherhood of Sleep—a secret order of the Catholic church—recover a large cylinder of swirling green liquid. Kept secret from even the Vatican, the cylinder was eventually moved to Los Angeles, where it has since been guarded by the Brotherhood. In the present day, the orders&#x27; last member dies before he can warn the cardinal that &quot;the sleeper awakens.&quot; A Catholic priest recovers a key from his possessions, which leads him to the cylinder’s hiding place beneath Saint Goddard monastery.

The priest invites quantum physicist, Professor Howard Birack, to analyse the cylinder. Birack invites his best students to assist—wise-cracking Walter Fong, demure Kelly, the highly-strung Susan Cabot, laid-back Mullins, and lovers Brian Marsh and Catherine Danforth—and fellow scientists Calder, Lisa, Etchinson, Lomax, Wyndham, and Dr. Paul Leahy. The priest tells Birack that he can sense the growing influence of the liquid, and needs him to scientifically evidence its true nature to the wider populace as he fears it will soon escape. After the team arrives at the monastery, the local homeless population begins surrounding the building. The team analyses the cylinder, discovering that it can only be opened from inside, and is at least seven million years old. Brian realizes that the liquid is prebiotic, but is evolving with purpose instead of decaying.

Translating the Brotherhood&#x27;s ancient textbooks, Catherine identifies differential equations from before their known invention. Lisa&#x27;s translations, meanwhile, claim that the cylinder contains Satan, who was buried by his father, an ancient god who was banished to the dark side. Jesus Christ was an extraterrestrial humanoid who warned humanity about the cylinder. Though he was killed by those who deemed him insane and too powerful, his disciples passed on his warning. Birack hypothesizes that Satan&#x27;s father may be the Anti-God, an even more powerful force of evil bound to the realm of anti-matter.

The liquid begins to exert its influence beyond its container, possessing Susan, who spreads the possession to or kills several other team members. Those who leave the building are brutally murdered by the increasingly enthralled homeless people. The survivors realize that, since their arrival, they have experienced a shared dream of a dark figure emerging from the monastery. Brian surmises that the dreams are a warning sent from the future using tachyons. The possessed bring the cylinder to a sleeping Kelly, where the remaining liquid forces itself into her body, transforming her into the physical vessel of Satan: a gruesomely disfigured being, with powers of telekinesis and regeneration. Satan attempts to summon the Anti-God by reaching through a handheld mirror, but it is too small and the effort fails.

The possessed attack the survivors, while Satan locates a larger mirror and reaches through, grasping the Anti-God&#x27;s large, clawed hand. The priest cuts off Satan&#x27;s arm and head with an axe, but it instantly regenerates and again reaches for the Anti-God. Seeing this, Catherine charges at Satan and they both fall through the portal. The priest shatters the mirror, trapping Satan, the Anti-God, and, to Brian&#x27;s horror, Catherine in the other realm. The possessed immediately die as the liquid evaporates from their bodies, while the homeless people wander away. The survivors, Brian, Walter, Birack, and the priest, are rescued as emergency services arrive to investigate.

Sometime later, Brian experiences the dream again, now seeing a seemingly possessed Catherine as the figure emerging from the church. He awakens and finds Catherine lying next to him, disfigured as Kelly was by Satan&#x27;s possession. Startled awake, he realizes it was a nightmare. He approaches his bedroom mirror, reaching his hand out towards it.

==Analysis==
Film critic John Kenneth Muir suggests that &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; serves as a parable for the AIDS epidemic that was at its peak during the time the film was made. Throughout the film, demonic possession is depicted as something that is transmitted like a communicable disease, via fluid passed between people. Muir goes on to note a number of references to homosexuality in the film, namely regarding the character of Walter, who makes several statements implying that he is gay (although he briefly flirted with Lisa, one of the female characters). In particular, Muir notes a sequence in which Walter, attacked by a number of possessed women while trapped inside a closet, emerges and flees. In addition to this, Muir writes that the film &quot;pointedly asks some rather big questions about human nature, our existence, and the universe at large.&quot;

==Production==
&quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; was shot in Los Angeles, California in 30 days. Carpenter became inspired while researching theoretical physics and atomic theory. He recalled, &quot;I thought it would be interesting to create some sort of ultimate evil and combine it with the notion of matter and anti-matter.&quot; This idea, which would eventually develop into the screenplay for &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;, was to be the first of a multi-picture deal with Alive Pictures, where Carpenter was allocated $3 million per picture and complete creative control.

Executive producer Shep Gordon was also manager to singer Alice Cooper, and suggested Cooper record a song for the film. Carpenter also cast Cooper as one of the homeless zombies. Cooper allowed the &quot;impaling device&quot; from his stage show to be used in the film in the scene where Cooper&#x27;s character kills Etchinson. The song Cooper wrote for the film, also titled &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;, can be heard briefly in the same scene playing through Etchinson&#x27;s headphones.

Carpenter cast people that he had worked with previously, including Victor Wong, Dennis Dun and Donald Pleasence. It was Peter Jason&#x27;s first film for Carpenter, and he would afterward become a Carpenter regular. The film was shot with wide-angle lenses, which combined with anamorphic format to create a lot of distortion.

Carpenter wrote the screenplay but was credited as &quot;Martin Quatermass&quot;, which, along with the name of Professor Birack&#x27;s institution (Kneale University), was an homage to British film and television writer Nigel Kneale and his best-known character, Bernard Quatermass. The story features elements associated with Kneale, including a confrontation with ancient evil (&quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; and &quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot;), messages from the future (&quot;The Road&quot;), and the scientific investigation of the paranormal (&quot;The Stone Tape&quot;).

The poster for &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; was created and designed by Henry Rosenthal, who worked for print production vendor Rod Dyer. According to Carpenter in the DVD audio commentary, the post-production was done at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California.

In an interview with Michael Doyle in the November 2012 issue of &quot;Rue Morgue&quot;, John Carpenter revealed how he created the eerie dream sequences in &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; that feature a shadowy figure emerging from a church doorway. Carpenter first shot the action of the figure (played by actor Jessie Ferguson) with a video camera and then &quot;re-photographed it on a television set&quot; in order to give the image a peculiar, dislocated feeling that also appeared as if it was being filmed live. Doyle also reminded Carpenter that the director himself provided the disembodied voice that narrates each dream.

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; holds an approval rating of 63%, based on 40 reviews, and an average rating of 6.2/10. Its consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; has a handful of chillingly clever ideas, but they aren&#x27;t enough to put John Carpenter&#x27;s return to horror at the same level as his classic earlier outings.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

In his review for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Richard Harrington wrote, “At one point Pleasence vows that &#x27;it&#x27;s a secret that can no longer be kept.&#x27; Here&#x27;s another: ″&quot;The Prince of Darkness&quot; stinks.&#x27; It too deserves to be shut up in a canister for 7 million years&quot;. Liam Lacey, in his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, wrote, “There is no character really worth caring about, no sympathy to any of these characters. The principal romantic couple, Jameson Parker and Lisa Blount, are unpleasant enough to create an unfortunate ambivalence about their eternal destinies”. In his review for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby called the film a &quot;surprisingly cheesy horror film to come from Mr. Carpenter, a director whose work is usually far more efficient and inventive.&quot; Nigel Floyd in &quot;Time Out&quot; gave a positive review of the film, calling &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; &quot;engrossing&quot; and adding &quot;the claustrophobic terror generated by fluid camerawork and striking angles&quot; leads &quot;to a heart-racing climax&quot;.

In 2004, Jim Emerson wrote that &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; was an undervalued horror film: &quot;What makes me goose-pimply about &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; is its goofy-but-ingenious central conceit and its truly surrealistic imagery, some of which could have sprouted out of Buñuel and Dali&#x27;s &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot;.&quot;

Like most of Carpenter&#x27;s films, &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; went on to have a cult following.

The dream sequence narrations have been sampled by a variety of musicians and producers over the years, including DJ Shadow on his debut &quot;Endtroducing...&quot; LP and Marilyn Manson on the track &quot;Down in the Park&quot; from his &quot;Lunchbox&quot; CD single.

===Accolades===
In 1988, the film was nominated for a Saturn Award for best music, and won the Critics Award at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival.

===Home media===
On September 24, 2013, the film was released by Scream Factory on Blu-ray and DVD. On February 18, 2019 the film was released on 4K by StudioCanal. In January 2021, Scream Factory issued their own 4K release of the film, which includes both a 4K UHD disc and a Blu-ray disc.

<text>Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease (HD or HSCR) is a birth defect in which nerves are missing from parts of the intestine. The most prominent symptom is constipation. Other symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and slow growth. Most children develop signs and symptoms shortly after birth. However, others may be diagnosed later in infancy or early childhood. About half of all children with Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease are diagnosed in the first year of life. Complications may include enterocolitis, megacolon, bowel obstruction and intestinal perforation.
The disorder may occur by itself or in association with other genetic disorders such as Down syndrome or Waardenburg syndrome. About half of isolated cases are linked to a specific genetic mutation, and about 20% occur within families. Some of these occur in an autosomal dominant manner. The cause of the remaining cases is unclear. If otherwise normal parents have one child with the condition, the next child has a 4% risk of being affected. The condition is divided into two main types, short-segment and long-segment, depending on how much of the bowel is affected. Rarely, the small bowel may be affected, as well. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and confirmed by biopsy.
Treatment is generally by surgery to remove the affected section of bowel. The surgical procedure most often carried out is known as a &quot;pull through&quot;. Occasionally, an intestinal transplantation may be recommended. Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease occurs in about one in 5,000 of newborns. Males are more often affected than females. The condition is believed to have first been described in 1691 by Dutch anatomist Frederik Ruysch and is named after Danish physician Harald Hirschsprung following his description in 1888.

==Signs and symptoms==
Typically, Hirschsprung disease is diagnosed shortly after birth, although it may develop well into adulthood, because of the presence of megacolon, or because the baby fails to pass the first stool (meconium) within 48 hours of delivery. Normally, 90% of babies pass their first meconium within 24 hours, and 99% within 48 hours.

Some other signs and symptoms in newborns include a swollen belly, vomiting (green or brown vomit), and flatulence. In older children, some other signs and symptoms include chronic constipation, flatulence, swollen belly, fatigue, and failure to thrive.

Other symptoms include symptoms of bowel perforation such as vomiting, constipation, poor feeding, lethargy, and diarrhea. Symptoms of bowel obstruction would include vomiting of bile and abdominal distension. Those who do not pass stools after 36 to 48 hours after birth should raise suspicion of Hirschsprung disease. Such suspicion can also be risen if there is only passage of stools after suppository, rectal exam, or enema. Children who do not respond to constipation treatment for six months should also raise suspicion of such disease. Enterocolitis, an acute complication of Hirschsprung disease, is characterised by sudden onset of fever, abdominal distension, vomiting, passage of bloody stools or release of explosive gas or stools after rectal examination.

Some cases are diagnosed later, into childhood, but usually before age 10. The child may experience fecal retention, constipation, or abdominal distention.

===Associated syndromes===
Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease can also present as part of multi system disorders, such as:
* Bardet–Biedl syndrome
* Cartilage–hair hypoplasia
* Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome
* MEN2
* Mowat–Wilson syndrome
* Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome
* Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) 
* Some forms of Waardenburg syndrome

==Cause==
The disorder may occur by itself or in association with other genetic disorders such as Down syndrome. About half of isolated cases are linked to a specific genetic mutation and about 20% occur within families. Some of these occur in an autosomal dominant manner. The cause of the remaining cases is unclear. If otherwise normal parents have one child with the condition, the next child has a 4% risk of being affected.

===Genetics===
Several genes and specific regions on chromosomes (loci) have been shown or suggested to be associated with Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease

The &quot;RET&quot; proto-oncogene accounts for the highest proportion of both familial and sporadic cases, with a wide range of mutations scattered along its entire coding region. A proto-oncogene can cause cancer if it is mutated or overexpressed.

===&quot;RET&quot; proto-oncogene===
&quot;RET&quot; is a gene that codes for proteins that assist cells of the neural crest in their movement through the digestive tract during the development of the embryo. Those neural crest cells eventually form bundles of nerve cells called ganglions. &quot;EDNRB&quot; codes for proteins that connect these nerve cells to the digestive tract. Thus, mutations in these two genes could directly lead to the absence of certain nerve fibers in the colon. Research suggests that several genes are associated with Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease. Also, new research suggests that mutations in genomic sequences involved in regulating&quot; EDNRB&quot; have a bigger impact on Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease than previously thought.

&quot;RET&quot; can mutate in many ways and is associated with Down syndrome. Since Down syndrome is comorbid in 2% of Hirschsprung&#x27;s cases, a likelihood exists that &quot;RET&quot; is involved heavily in both Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease and Down syndrome. &quot;RET&quot; is also associated with medullary thyroid cancer and neuroblastoma, which is a type of cancer common in children. Both of these disorders are more common in Hirschsprung&#x27;s patients than in the general population. One function that &quot;RE&quot;T controls is the travel of the neural crest cells through the intestines in the developing fetus. The earlier the &quot;RET&quot; mutation occurs in Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease, the more severe the disorder becomes.

===Other genes===
Common and rare DNA variations in the neuregulin 1 (&quot;NRG1&quot;) and NRG3 (&quot;NRG3&quot;) were first shown to be associated with the disease in Chinese patients through a Genome Wide Association Study by the Hong Kong team in 2009 and 2012, respectively Subsequent studies in both Asian and Caucasian patients confirmed the initial findings by the University of Hong Kong. Both rare and common variants in these two genes have been identified in additional Chinese, Thai, Korean, Indonesian, and Spanish patients. These two genes are known to play a role in the formation of the enteric nervous system; thus, they are likely to be involved in the pathology of Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease, at least in some cases.

Another gene associated with this condition is NADPH oxidase, EF-hand calcium binding domain 5 (NOX5). This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q23).

==Pathophysiology==
During normal prenatal development, cells from the neural crest migrate into the large intestine (colon) to form the networks of nerves called the myenteric plexus (Auerbach plexus) (between the smooth muscle layers of the gastrointestinal tract wall) and the submucosal plexus (Meissner plexus) (within the submucosa of the gastrointestinal tract wall). In Hirschsprung disease, the migration is not complete and part of the colon lacks these nerve bodies that regulate the activity of the colon. The affected segment of the colon cannot relax and pass stool through the colon, creating an obstruction.

The most accepted theory of the cause of Hirschsprung is a defect in the craniocaudal migration of neuroblasts originating from the neural crest that occurs during the first 12 weeks of gestation. Defects in the differentiation of neuroblasts into ganglion cells and accelerated ganglion cell destruction within the intestine may also contribute to the disorder.

This lack of ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexus is well documented in Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease. With Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease, the segment lacking neurons (aganglionic) becomes constricted, causing the normal, proximal section of bowel to become distended with feces. This narrowing of the distal colon and the failure of relaxation in the aganglionic segment are thought to be caused by the lack of neurons containing nitric oxide synthase.

The most cited feature is absence of ganglion cells: notably in males, 75% have none in the end of the colon (rectosigmoid) and 8% lack ganglion cells in the entire colon. The enlarged section of the bowel is found proximally, while the narrowed, aganglionic section is found distally, closer to the end of the bowel. The absence of ganglion cells results in a persistent overstimulation of nerves in the affected region, resulting in contraction.

The equivalent disease in horses is lethal white syndrome.

==Diagnosis==

Definitive diagnosis is made by suction biopsy of the distally narrowed segment. A histologic examination of the tissue would show a lack of ganglionic nerve cells. Diagnostic techniques involve anorectal manometry, barium enema, and rectal biopsy. The suction rectal biopsy is considered the current international gold standard in the diagnosis of Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease.

Radiologic findings may also assist with diagnosis. An abdominal x-ray can reveal a lack of stool in the large intestine or a bulging caused by blocked stool. Cineanography (fluoroscopy of contrast medium passing anorectal region) assists in determining the level of the affected intestines.

==Treatment==
Treatment of Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease consists of surgical removal (resection) of the abnormal section of the colon, followed by reanastomosis.

===Colostomy===
The first stage of treatment used to be a reversible colostomy. In this approach, the healthy end of the large intestine is cut and attached to an opening created on the front of the abdomen. The contents of the bowel are discharged through the hole in the abdomen and into a bag. Later, when the patient&#x27;s weight, age, and condition are right, the &quot;new&quot; functional end of the bowel is connected with the anus. The first surgical treatment involving surgical resection followed by reanastomosis without a colostomy occurred as early as 1933 by Doctor Baird in Birmingham on a one-year-old boy.

===Other procedures===
The Swedish-American surgeon Orvar Swenson (1909–2012), who discovered the cause of Hirschsprung&#x27;s, first performed its surgical treatment, the pull-through surgery, in 1948. The pull-through procedure repairs the colon by connecting the functioning portion of the bowel to the anus. The pull-through procedure is the typical method for treating Hirschsprung&#x27;s in younger patients. Swenson devised the original procedure, and the pull-through surgery has been modified many times.&#x27;

Currently, several different surgical approaches are used, which include the Swenson, Soave, Duhamel, and Boley procedures. The Swenson procedure leaves a small portion of the diseased bowel. The Soave procedure, named after the Italian pediatric surgeon, (1917–1984), leaves the outer wall of the colon unaltered. The Boley procedure, pioneered by the American surgeon, Scott Boley (born 1941), is a small modification of the Soave procedure, so the term &quot;Soave-Boley&quot; procedure is sometimes used. The Duhamel procedure, named for the French pediatric surgeon Bernard Duhamel (1917–1996), uses a surgical stapler to connect the good and bad bowel.

For the 15% of children who do not obtain full bowel control, other treatments are available. Constipation may be remedied by laxatives or a high-fiber diet. In those patients, serious dehydration can play a major factor in their lifestyles. A lack of bowel control may be addressed by an ileostomy – similar to a colostomy, but uses the end of the small intestine rather than the colon. The Malone antegrade colonic enema (ACE) is also an option. In a Malone ACE, a tube goes through the abdominal wall to the appendix, or if available, to the colon. The bowel is then flushed daily. Children as young as 6 years of age may administer this daily flush on their own.

If the affected portion of the lower intestine is restricted to the lower portion of the rectum, other surgical procedures may be performed, such as a posterior rectal myectomy. The prognosis is good in 70% of cases. Chronic postoperative constipation is present in 7 to 8% of the operated cases. Postoperative enterocolitis, a severe manifestation, is present in the 10–20% of operated patients.

==Epidemiology==
According to a 1984 study conducted in Maryland, Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease appears in 18.6 per 100,000 live births. In Japan, it occurs at a similar rate of about one in 5,000 births (20 per 100,000). It is more common in male than female (4.32:1) and in white rather than nonwhite. Nine percent of the Hirschsprung cases were also diagnosed as having Down syndrome. Most cases are diagnosed before the patient is 10 years of age.

==History==
The first report of Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease dates to 1691, when it was described by Dutch anatomist Frederik Ruysch. However, the disease is named after Harald Hirschsprung, the Danish physician who first described two infants who died of this disorder in 1888.

Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease is a congenital disorder of the colon in which certain nerve cells, known as ganglion cells, are absent, causing chronic constipation. In patients with Hirschsprung disease, both myenteric and submucosal plexuses are absent. A barium enema is the mainstay of diagnosis of Hirschsprung&#x27;s, though a rectal biopsy showing the lack of ganglion cells is the only certain method of diagnosis.

The first publication on an important genetic discovery of the disease was from Martucciello Giuseppe &quot;et al.&quot; in 1992. The authors described a case of a patient with total colonic aganglionosis associated with a 46, XX, del 10 (q11.21 q21.2) karyotype. The major gene of Hirschsprung disease was identified in this chromosomal 10 region, it was the RET proto-oncogene.

The usual treatment is &quot;pull-through&quot; surgery where the portion of the colon that does have nerve cells is pulled through and sewn over the part that lacks nerve cells. For a long time, Hirschsprung&#x27;s was considered a multifactorial disorder, where a combination of nature and nurture was considered to be the cause. However, in August 1993, two articles by independent groups in &quot;Nature Genetics&quot; said that Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease could be mapped to a stretch of chromosome 10.

<text>The Most Honourable Order of the Bath is a British order of chivalry founded by King George I on 18 May 1725. Recipients of the Order are usually senior military officers or senior civil servants, and the monarch awards it on the advice of His Majesty&#x27;s Government. The name derives from an elaborate medieval ceremony for preparing a candidate to receive his knighthood, of which ritual bathing (as a symbol of purification) was an element. While not all knights went through such an elaborate ceremony, knights so created were known as &quot;knights of the Bath&quot;.

George I constituted the Knights of the Bath as a regular military order. He did not revive the order, which did not previously exist, in the sense of a body of knights governed by a set of statutes and whose numbers were replenished when vacancies occurred.

The Order consists of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently King Charles III), the Great Master (currently William, Prince of Wales), and three Classes of members:
* Knight Grand Cross (GCB) &quot;or&quot; Dame Grand Cross (GCB);
* Knight Commander (KCB) &quot;or&quot; Dame Commander (DCB); and
* Companion (CB).
Members belong to either the Civil Division or the Military Division. Knight Companion (KB), the order&#x27;s only class prior to 1815, is no longer an option. Commonwealth citizens who are not subjects of the British monarch and foreign nationals may be made honorary members.

The Order of the Bath is the fourth most senior of the British orders of chivalry, after the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, and the (dormant) Order of St Patrick.

==History==
===Knights of the Bath===

In the Middle Ages, a knighthood was often conferred with elaborate ceremonies. These usually involved the knight-to-be taking a bath (possibly symbolic of spiritual purification), during which he was instructed in the duties of knighthood by more senior knights. He was then put to bed to dry. Clothed in a special robe, he was led with music to the chapel where he spent the night in a vigil. At dawn, he made confession and attended Mass, then retired to his bed to sleep until it was fully daylight. He was then brought before the King, who after instructing two senior knights to buckle the spurs to the knight-elect&#x27;s heels, fastened a belt around his waist, then struck him on the neck (with either a hand or a sword), thus making him a knight. It was this accolade which was the essential act in creating a knight, and a simpler ceremony developed, conferring knighthood merely by striking or touching the knight-to-be on the shoulder with a sword, or &#x27;dubbing&#x27; him, as is still done today. In the early medieval period, the difference seems to have been that the full ceremonies were used for men from more prominent families.

From the coronation of Henry IV in 1399, the full ceremonies were restricted to major royal occasions, such as coronations, investitures of the Prince of Wales or royal dukes, and royal weddings, and the knights so created became known as &quot;Knights of the Bath&quot;. Knights Bachelor continued to be created with the simpler form of ceremony. The last occasion on which Knights of the Bath were created was the coronation of Charles II in 1661.

From at least 1625, and possibly from the reign of James I, Knights of the Bath were using the motto &quot;Tria juncta in uno&quot; (Latin for &#x27;Three joined in one&#x27;), and wearing as a badge three crowns within a plain gold oval. These were both subsequently adopted by the Order of the Bath; a similar design of badge is still worn by members of the Civil Division. Their symbolism however is not entirely clear. The &#x27;three joined in one&#x27; may be a reference to the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and either France or Ireland, which were held (or claimed in the case of France) by English and, later, British monarchs. This would correspond to the three crowns in the badge. Another explanation of the motto is that it refers to the Holy Trinity. Nicolas quotes a source (although he is sceptical of it) who claims that prior to James I the motto was &quot;Tria numina juncta in uno&quot; (three powers/gods joined in one), but from the reign of James I, the word &quot;numina&quot; was dropped, and the motto understood to mean &quot;Tria [regna] juncta in uno&quot; (three kingdoms joined in one).

===Foundation of the order===
The prime mover in the establishment of the Order of the Bath was John Anstis, Garter King of Arms, England&#x27;s highest heraldic officer. Sir Anthony Wagner, a recent holder of the office of Garter King of Arms, wrote of Anstis&#x27;s motivations:

It was Martin Leake&#x27;s opinion that the trouble and opposition Anstis met with in establishing himself as Garter so embittered him against the heralds that when at last in 1718 he succeeded, he made it his prime object to aggrandise himself and his office at their expense. It is clear at least that he set out to make himself indispensable to the Earl Marshal, which was not hard, their political principles being congruous and their friendship already established, but also to Sir Robert Walpole and the Whig ministry, which can by no means have been easy, considering his known attachment to the Pretender and the circumstances under which he came into office. ... The main object of Anstis&#x27;s next move, the revival or institution of the Order of the Bath was probably that which it in fact secured, of ingratiating him with the all-powerful Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole.

The use of honours in the early eighteenth century differed considerably from the modern honours system, in which hundreds, if not thousands, of people each year receive honours on the basis of deserving accomplishments. The only honours available at that time were hereditary (not life) peerages and baronetcies, knighthoods, and the Order of the Garter (or the Order of the Thistle for Scots), none of which were awarded in large numbers (the Garter and the Thistle are limited to twenty-four and sixteen living members respectively). The political environment was also significantly different from today:

The Sovereign still exercised a power to be reckoned with in the eighteenth century. The Court remained the centre of the political world. The King was limited in that he had to choose Ministers who could command a majority in Parliament, but the choice remained his. The leader of an administration still had to command the King&#x27;s personal confidence and approval. A strong following in Parliament depended on being able to supply places, pensions, and other marks of Royal favour to the government&#x27;s supporters.

The attraction of the new Order for Walpole was that it would provide a source of such favours to strengthen his political position. He made sure that most of the 36 new honorees were peers and MPs who would provide him with useful connections. George I having agreed to Walpole&#x27;s proposal, Anstis was commissioned to draft statutes for the Order of the Bath. As noted above, he adopted the motto and badge used by the Knights of the Bath, as well as the colour of the riband and mantle, and the ceremony for creating a knight. The rest of the statutes were mostly based on those of the Order of the Garter, of which he was an officer (as Garter King of Arms). The Order was founded by letters patent under the Great Seal dated , and the statutes issued the following week.

The Order initially consisted of the Sovereign, a Prince of the blood Royal as Principal Knight, a Great Master, and thirty-five Knights Companion. Seven officers (see below) were attached to the Order. These provided yet another opportunity for political patronage, as they were to be sinecures at the disposal of the Great Master, supported by fees from the knights. Despite the fact that the Bath was represented as a military Order, only a few military officers were among the initial appointments (see List of knights companion of the Order of the Bath). They may be broken down into categories as follows (some are classified in more than one category):
* Members of the House of Commons: 14
* The Royal Household or sinecures: 11
* Diplomats: 4
* The Walpole family, including the Prime Minister: 3
* Naval and Army officers: 3
* Irish peers: 2
* Country gentlemen with Court appointments: 2

The majority of the new Knights Companions were knighted by the King, and invested with their ribands and badges on 27 May 1725. Although the statutes set out the full medieval ceremony which was to be used for creating knights, this was not performed, and indeed, was possibly never intended to be, as the original statutes contained a provision allowing the Great Master to dispense Knights Companion from these requirements. The original knights were dispensed from all the medieval ceremonies with the exception of the Installation, which was performed in the Order&#x27;s Chapel, the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey, on 17 June. This precedent was followed until 1812, after which the Installation was also dispensed with, until its revival in the twentieth century. The ceremonies however remained part of the Statutes until 1847.

Although the initial appointments to the Order were largely political, from the 1770s, appointments to the Order were increasingly made for naval, military, or diplomatic achievements. This is partly due to the conflicts Britain was engaged in over this period. The Peninsular War resulted in so many deserving candidates for the Bath, that a statute was issued allowing the appointment of &quot;Extra Knights&quot; in time of war, who were to be additional to the numerical limits imposed by the statutes, and whose number was not subject to any restrictions. Another statute, this one issued some 80 years earlier, had also added a military note to the Order. Each knight was required, under certain circumstances, to supply and support four men-at-arms for a period not exceeding 42 days in any year, to serve in any part of Great Britain. This company was to be captained by the Great Master, who had to supply four trumpeters, and was also to appoint eight officers for this body. However, the statute was never invoked.

===Restructuring in 1815===
In January 1815, after the end of the Peninsular War, the Prince Regent (later George IV) expanded the Order of the Bathto the end that those Officers who have had the opportunities of signalising themselves by eminent services during the late war may share in the honours of the said Order, and that their names may be delivered down to remote posterity, accompanied by the marks of distinction which they have so nobly earned.

The Order was now to consist of three classes: Knights Grand Cross, Knights Commander, and Companions. At the same time, the large and small Naval Gold Medals were suspended, while the bearers became Knights Commander and Companions, respectively. The existing Knights Companion (of which there were 60) became Knight Grand Cross; this class was limited to 72 members, of which twelve could be appointed for civil or diplomatic services. The military members had to be of the rank of at least major-general or rear admiral. The Knights Commander were limited to 180, exclusive of foreign nationals holding British commissions, up to ten of whom could be appointed as honorary Knights Commander. They had to be of the rank of lieutenant-colonel or post-captain. The number of Companions was not specified, but they had to have received a medal or been mentioned in despatches since the start of the war in 1803. A list of about 500 names was subsequently published. Two further officers were appointed, an &#x27;Officer of arms attendant on the Knights Commanders and Companions&#x27;, and a &#x27;Secretary appertaining to the Knights Commanders and Companions&#x27;. The large increase in numbers caused some complaints that such an expansion would reduce the prestige of the Order.

===Victorian era===

In 1847, Queen Victoria issued new statutes eliminating all references to an exclusively military Order. As well as removing the word &#x27;Military&#x27; from the full name of the Order, this opened up the grades of Knight Commander and Companion to civil appointments, and the Military and Civil Divisions of the Order were established. New numerical limits were imposed, and the opportunity also taken to regularise the 1815 expansion of the Order. The 1847 statutes also abolished all the medieval ritual, but they did introduce a formal Investiture ceremony, conducted by the Sovereign wearing the Mantle and insignia of the Order, attended by the Officers and as many GCBs as possible, in their Mantles.

In 1850, a special statute authorised appointments of Knight Commander and Companion, in the Military Division, to Commissariat and Medical officers serving with the Army and Navy, including those serving with the East India Company.

In 1859, a further edition of the Statutes was issued; the changes related mainly to the costs associated with the Order. Prior to this date, it had been the policy that the insignia (which were provided by the Crown) were to be returned on the death of the holder; the exception had been foreigners who had been awarded honorary membership. In addition, foreigners had usually been provided with stars made of silver and diamonds, whereas ordinary members had only embroidered stars. The decision was made to award silver stars to all members, and only require the return of the Collar. The Crown had also been paying the fees due to the officers of the Order for members who had been appointed for the services in the recent war. The fees were abolished, and replaced with a salary of approximately the same average value. The offices of Genealogist and Messenger were abolished, and those of Registrar and Secretary combined.

===Contemporary era===

In 1910, after his accession to the throne, George V ordered the revival of the Installation ceremony, perhaps prompted by the first Installation ceremony of the more junior Order of St Michael and St George, held a few years earlier, and the building of a new chapel for the Order of the Thistle in 1911. The Installation ceremony took place on 22 July 1913 in the Henry VII Chapel, and Installations have been held at regular intervals since.

Prior to the 1913 Installation, it was necessary to adapt the chapel to accommodate the larger number of members. An appeal was made to the members of the Order, and following the Installation a surplus remained. A Committee was formed from the Officers to administer the &#x27;Bath Chapel Fund&#x27;, and over time this committee has come to consider other matters than purely financial ones.

Another revision of the statutes of the Order was undertaken in 1925, to consolidate the 41 additional statutes which had been issued since the 1859 revision.

Women were admitted to the Order in 1971. In the 1971 New Year Honours, Jean Nunn became the first woman admitted to the order. In 1975, Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, an aunt of Elizabeth II, became the first woman to reach the highest rank, Dame Grand Cross. Princess Alice (née Douglas-Montagu-Scott) was a direct descendant of the Order&#x27;s first Great Master, and her husband, who had died the previous year, had also held that office. The second Dame Grand Cross, Sally Davies, was appointed in the 2020 New Year Honours.

==Composition==
===Sovereign===
The British Sovereign is the Sovereign of the Order of the Bath. As with all honours, except those in the Sovereign&#x27;s personal gift, the Sovereign makes all appointments to the Order on the advice of the Government.

===Great Master===

The next-most senior member of the Order is the Great Master, of which there have been ten:
* 1725–1749 — John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu
* 1749–1767 — &quot;vacant&quot;
* 1767–1827 — Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany
* 1827–1830 — Prince William, Duke of Clarence and St Andrews (later King William IV)
* 1830–1837 — &quot;vacant&quot;
* 1837–1843 — Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex
* 1843–1861 — Albert, Prince Consort
* 1861–1897 — &quot;vacant&quot;
* 1897–1901 — Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII)
* 1901–1942 — Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn
* 1942–1974 — Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester
* 1974–2022 — Charles, Prince of Wales (later King Charles III)
* 2022–2024 — &quot;vacant&quot;
* 2024–present — William, Prince of Wales

Originally a Prince of the Blood Royal, as the Principal Knight Companion, ranked next after the sovereign. This position was joined to that of the Great Master in the statutes of 1847. The Great Master and Principal Knight is now either a descendant of George I or &#x27;some other exalted personage&#x27;; the holder of the office has custody of the seal of the order and is responsible for enforcing the statutes.

===Members===
The statutes also provide for the following:
* 120 Knights or Dames Grand Cross (GCB) (of whom the Great Master is the First and Principal);
* 355 Knights Commander (KCB) or Dames Commander (DCB); and
* 1,925 Companions (CB).

Regular membership is limited to citizens of the United Kingdom and of other Commonwealth countries of which the British monarch is Sovereign. Appointees are usually officers of the armed forces or senior civil servants, such as permanent secretaries.

Members appointed to the Civil Division must &quot;by their personal services to [the] crown or by the performance of public duties have merited ... royal favour.&quot; Appointments to the Military Division are restricted by the minimum rank of the individual. GCBs hold the rank of admiral in the Royal Navy, general in the British Army or Royal Marines, or air chief marshal in the Royal Air Force. KCBs must at least hold the rank of vice admiral, lieutenant general in the Army or Marines, or air marshal. CBs tend be of the rank of rear admiral, major general in the Army, Royal Navy or Royal Marines, or air vice marshal in the Royal Air Force, and in addition must have been Mentioned in Despatches for distinction in a command position in a combat situation, although the latter is no longer a requirement. Non-line officers (e.g. engineers, medics) may be appointed only for meritorious service in wartime.

Commonwealth citizens not subjects of the British monarch and foreigners may be made honorary members. Queen Elizabeth II established the custom of appointing visiting (republican) heads of state honorary GCBs, for example Gustav Heinemann and Josip Broz Tito (in 1972), Ronald Reagan (in 1989), Lech Wałęsa (in 1991), Censu Tabone (in 1992), Fernando Henrique Cardoso, George H. W. Bush (in 1993), Nicolas Sarkozy (in 2008), and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (in 2012), as well as Turkish President Abdullah Gül, Slovenian President Danilo Türk, Mexican President Felipe Calderón, and South African President Jacob Zuma (royal heads of state are instead usually made Stranger Knights and Ladies Companion of the Order of the Garter). Foreign generals are also often given honorary appointments to the Order, for example: Marshal Ferdinand Foch and Marshal Joseph Joffre during the First World War; Marshal Georgy Zhukov, King Abdul-Aziz of Saudi Arabia, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, General George C. Marshall, General Douglas MacArthur, General George S. Patton Jr. during the Second World War; and General Norman Schwarzkopf and General Colin Powell after the Gulf War. A more controversial member of the Order was Robert Mugabe, whose honour was stripped by the Queen, on the advice of the Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, on 25 June 2008 &quot;as a mark of revulsion at the abuse of human rights and abject disregard for the democratic process in Zimbabwe over which President Mugabe has presided.&quot;

Honorary members do not count towards the numerical limits in each class. In addition, the statutes allow the Sovereign to exceed the limits in time of war or other exceptional circumstances.

=== Officers ===
The office of Dean is held by the Dean of Westminster. The King of Arms, responsible for heraldry, is known as Bath King of Arms; he is not, however, a member of the College of Arms, like many heralds. The Order&#x27;s Usher is known as the Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod; he does not, unlike his Order of the Garter equivalent (the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod) perform any duties in the House of Lords.

There were originally seven officers, each of whom was to receive fees from the Knights Companion both on appointment, and annually thereafter. The office of Messenger was abolished in 1859. The office of Genealogist was abolished at the same time, but revived in 1913. The offices of Registrar and Secretary were formally merged in 1859, although the two positions had been held concurrently for the previous century. An Officer of Arms and a Secretary for the Knights Commander and Companions were established in 1815, but abolished in 1847. The office of Deputy Secretary was created in 1925.

Under the Hanoverian kings, certain of the officers also held heraldic office. The office of Blanc Coursier Herald of Arms was attached to that of the Genealogist, Brunswick Herald of Arms to the Gentleman Usher, and Bath King of Arms was also made Gloucester King of Arms with heraldic jurisdiction over Wales. This was the result of a move by Anstis to give the holders of these sinecures greater security; the offices of the Order of the Bath were held at the pleasure of the Great Master, while appointments to the heraldic offices were made by the King under the Great Seal and were for life.

==Habit and insignia==

Members of the Order wear elaborate uniforms on important occasions (such as its quadrennial installation ceremonies and coronations), which vary by rank:

The &quot;mantle&quot;, worn only by Knights and Dames Grand Cross, is made of crimson satin lined with white taffeta. On the left side is a representation of the star (see below). The mantle is bound with two large tassels.

The &quot;hat&quot;, worn only by Knights and Dames Grand Cross and Knights and Dames Commander, is made of black velvet; it includes an upright plume of feathers.

The &quot;collar&quot;, worn only by Knights and Dames Grand Cross, is made of gold and weighs . It consists of depictions of nine imperial crowns and eight sets of flowers (roses for England, thistles for Scotland, and shamrocks for Ireland), connected by seventeen silver knots.

On lesser occasions, simpler insignia are used: The &quot;star&quot; is used only by Knights and Dames Grand Cross and Knights and Dames Commander. Its style varies by rank and division; it is worn pinned to the left breast:

The star for &quot;military Knights and Dames Grand Cross&quot; consists of a Maltese Cross on top of an eight-pointed silver star; the star for &quot;military Knights and Dames Commander&quot; is an eight-pointed silver cross pattée. Each bears in the centre three crowns surrounded by a red ring bearing the motto of the Order in gold letters. The circle is flanked by two laurel branches, and is above a scroll bearing the words &quot;Ich dien&quot; (older German for &#x27;I serve&#x27;) in gold letters. Stylised versions of this are known as &quot;Bath stars&quot;, and are used as epaulette pips to indicate British Army officer ranks and for police ranks.

The star for &quot;civil Knights and Dames Grand Cross&quot; consists of an eight-pointed silver star, &quot;without&quot; the Maltese cross; the star for &quot;civil Knights and Dames Commander&quot; is an eight-pointed silver cross pattée. The design of each is the same as the design of the military stars, except that the laurel branches and the words &quot;Ich dien&quot; are excluded.

The &quot;badge&quot; varies in design, size, and manner of wearing by rank and division. The Knight and Dame Grand Cross&#x27; badge is larger than the Knight and Dame Commander&#x27;s badge, which is in turn larger than the Companion&#x27;s badge; however, these are all suspended on a crimson ribbon. Knights and Dames Grand Cross wear the badge on a riband or sash, passing from the right shoulder to the left hip. Knights Commander and male Companions wear the badge from a ribbon worn around the neck. Dames Commander and female Companions wear the badge from a bow on the left side:

The &quot;military badge&quot; is a gold Maltese Cross of eight points, enamelled in white. Each point of the cross is decorated by a small gold ball; each angle has a small figure of a lion. The centre of the cross bears three crowns on the obverse side, and a rose, a thistle and a shamrock, emanating from a sceptre on the reverse side. Both emblems are surrounded by a red circular ring bearing the motto of the Order, which are in turn flanked by two laurel branches, above a scroll bearing the words &quot;Ich dien&quot; in gold letters.

The &quot;civil badge&quot; is a plain gold oval, bearing three crowns on the obverse side, and a rose, a thistle and a shamrock, emanating from a sceptre on the reverse side; both emblems are surrounded by a ring bearing the motto of the Order.

On certain &#x27;collar days&#x27; designated by the Sovereign, members attending formal events may wear the Order&#x27;s collar over their military uniform or evening wear. When collars are worn (either on collar days or on formal occasions such as coronations), the badge is suspended from the collar.

The collars and badges of Knights and Dames Grand Cross are returned to the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood upon the decease of their owners. All other insignia may be retained by their owners.

==Chapel==
The Chapel of the Order is the Henry VII Lady Chapel in Westminster Abbey. The Sovereign, Great Master, and the Knights and Dames Grand Cross are allotted stalls in the choir of the chapel, above which their heraldic devices are displayed.

Every four years, an installation ceremony, presided over by the Great Master, and a religious service are held in the chapel. The last such service was on Tuesday 24 May 2022, and was presided over by the Prince of Wales. The Sovereign and each knight who has been installed is allotted a stall in the choir of the chapel.

As there are a limited number of stalls in the chapel, only the most senior Knights and Dames Grand Cross are installed. A stall made vacant by the death of a military Knight Grand Cross is offered to the next most senior uninstalled military GCB, and similarly for vacancies among civil GCBs. Waits between admission to the Order and installation may be very long; for instance, Marshal of the Air Force David Craig, Baron Craig of Radley was created a Knight Grand Cross in 1984, but was not installed until 2006.

Above each stall, the occupant&#x27;s heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight&#x27;s stall is his helm, decorated with a mantling and topped by his crest. Under English heraldic law, women other than monarchs do not bear helms or crests; instead, the coronet appropriate to the dame&#x27;s rank (if she is a peer or member of the Royal family) is used.

Above the crest or coronet, the knight&#x27;s or dame&#x27;s heraldic banner is hung, emblazoned with his or her coat of arms. At a considerably smaller scale, to the back of the stall is affixed a piece of brass (a &#x27;stall plate&#x27;) displaying its occupant&#x27;s name, arms, and date of admission into the Order.

Upon the death of a Knight, the banner, helm, mantling, and crest (or coronet or crown) are taken down. The stall plates, however, are not removed; rather, they remain permanently affixed somewhere about the stall, so that the stalls of the chapel are festooned with a colourful record of the Order&#x27;s Knights (and now Dames) throughout history.

When the grade of Knight Commander was established in 1815, the regulations specified that they too should have a banner and stall plate affixed in the chapel. This was never implemented (despite some of the KCBs paying the appropriate fees) primarily due to lack of space, although the 1847 statutes allow all three classes to request the erection of a plate in the chapel bearing the member&#x27;s name, date of nomination, and (for the two higher classes) optionally the coat of arms.

==Privileges==
=== Precedence ===

Members of the Order of the Bath are assigned positions in the order of precedence. Wives of male members also feature on the order of precedence, as do sons, daughters, and daughters-in-law of Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commander; relatives of female members, however, are not assigned any special precedence. Generally, individuals can derive precedence from their fathers or husbands, but not from their mothers or wives. (See order of precedence in England and Wales for the exact positions.)

Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commander prefix &#x27;Sir&#x27;, and Dames Grand Cross and Dames Commander prefix &#x27;Dame&#x27;, to their forenames. Wives of Knights may prefix &#x27;Lady&#x27; to their surnames, but no equivalent privilege exists for husbands of Dames. Such forms are not used by peers and princes, except when the names of the former are written out in their fullest forms. Furthermore, honorary foreign members and clergymen do not receive the accolade of knighthood, and so are not entitled to the prefix &#x27;Sir&#x27;, unless the former subsequently become Commonwealth citizens.

Knights and Dames Grand Cross use the post-nominal GCB; Knights Commander use KCB; Dames Commander use DCB; Companions use CB.

=== Heraldry ===
Knights and Dames Grand Cross are also entitled to receive heraldic supporters. Furthermore, they may encircle their arms with a depiction of the circlet (a red circle bearing the motto) with the badge pendant thereto and the collar; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter.

Knights and Dames Commander and Companions may display the circlet, but not the collar, around their arms. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar or circlet. Members of the Military division may encompass the circlet with &#x27;two laurel branches issuant from an escrol azure inscribed &quot;Ich dien&quot;&#x27;, as appears on the badge.

Members of the Order of the Bath and their children are able to be married in Westminster Abbey in London.

==Revocation==
It is possible for membership in the Order to be revoked. Under the 1725 statutes, the grounds for this were heresy, high treason, or fleeing from battle out of cowardice. Knights Companion could in such cases be degraded at the next Chapter meeting. It was then the duty of the Gentleman Usher to &#x27;pluck down the escocheon [i.e. stallplate] of such knight and spurn it out of the chapel&#x27; with &#x27;all the usual marks of infamy&#x27;.

Only two people were ever degraded: Lord Cochrane in 1813, and Eyre Coote in 1816, both for political reasons, rather than any of the grounds given in the statute. Lord Cochrane was subsequently reinstated, but Coote died a few years after his degradation.

Under Queen Victoria&#x27;s 1847 statutes, a member &#x27;convicted of treason, cowardice, felony, or any infamous crime derogatory to his honour as a knight or gentleman, or accused and does not submit to trial in a reasonable time, shall be degraded from the Order by a special ordinance signed by the sovereign.&#x27; The Sovereign was to be the sole judge, and also had the power to restore such members.

The situation today is that membership may be cancelled or annulled, and the entry in the register erased, by an ordinance signed by the Sovereign and sealed with the seal of the Order, on the recommendation of the appropriate minister. Such cancellations may be subsequently reversed.

In 1923, the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was made an honorary Knight Grand Cross, by King George V. Mussolini was stripped of his GCB in 1940, after he had declared war on the UK.

George Pottinger, a senior civil servant, lost both his status of CB and Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1975 when he was jailed for corruptly receiving gifts from the architect John Poulson.

Romanian president Nicolae Ceauşescu was stripped of his honorary GCB status by Queen Elizabeth II on 24 December 1989, the day before his execution. Robert Mugabe, the President of Zimbabwe, was stripped of his honorary GCB status by the Queen, on the advice of the Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, on 25 June 2008, &#x27;as a mark of revulsion at the abuse of human rights and abject disregard for the democratic process in Zimbabwe over which President Mugabe has presided.&#x27;

Vicky Pryce, former wife of Chris Huhne, was stripped of her CB by Queen Elizabeth II on 30 July 2013, following her conviction for perverting the course of justice.

<doc id="311465" wikidata="Q7808473" url="?curid=311465" title="Tinsley Viaduct">
<text>Tinsley Viaduct is a two-tier road bridge in Sheffield, England; it was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. It carries the M1 and the A631 for a distance of over the Don Valley, from Tinsley to Wincobank, also crossing the Sheffield Canal, the Midland Main Line and the former South Yorkshire Railway line from Tinsley Junction to Rotherham Central. The Supertram route to Meadowhall runs below part of the viaduct on the trackbed of the South Yorkshire Railway line to Barnsley.

==History==

The lower deck of the viaduct was opened in March 1968 and the upper deck, carrying the M1, on 19 October 1968. The build cost was £6 million. The structure is unusual in that it is built as steel box girders, at a time when most long span bridges were being built of post-tensioned concrete deck design. The use of steel allowed a significant cost saving over alternative methods, but became controversial following two disasters involving steel bridges in 1970 (the West Gate Bridge in Australia and the Cleddau Bridge in Wales) and another in 1971 (the in Germany). Fifty-one people were killed in these failures, leading in the UK to the formation of the Merrison Committee. The report of the Merrison committee resulted in the temporary closure of two of the carriageways on the lower deck and two on the upper deck, the installation of extra steel strengthening bands around the bridge&#x27;s support columns and other works which were completed in 1983. A further programme of strengthening was completed in 2006. The recent work to strengthen the bridge was a very complex operation, with a lot of the work happening inside the box beam spine. The works took over 3 years and cost £82 million (nearly 9 times the original bridge building cost, adjusting for inflation). The strengthening project won the British construction industry&#x27;s Major Project Award in 2005.

Although originally designed to carry a dual 3-lane motorway on the top deck, during and subsequent to the strengthening work the M1 was reduced to 2 lanes following an EU directive on load bearing capacity to allow for the introduction of 40-tonne trucks in the UK. This arrangement allowed the third lane in each direction to join from Junction 34 to make the busy junction safer. Since the opening of the M1 junction 32 to 35a smart motorway scheme in January 2017, the viaduct once again carries 3 lanes of traffic plus hard shoulders in each direction.

The viaduct is balanced on rollers to allow for thermal expansion and contraction, and the route weaves slightly in order to make its way past obstacles. The viaduct, due to its construction, is very flexible. Movement may be felt on the lower deck as the traffic passes overhead. The Meadowhall Shopping Centre lies in the valley to the west; to the east is the Blackburn Meadows sewage works and new biomass power station.

==Tinsley cooling towers==
The viaduct is one of Sheffield&#x27;s most prominent landmarks, and was once made all the more so by the adjacent pair of cooling towers that were left standing for safety reasons after the demolition of the Blackburn Meadows Power Station. The cooling towers were a major point of contention over the years and were once saved from destruction only after being chosen as a nesting site by a rare bird. More recently, plans were made to turn them into a piece of public art. Other plans for the towers included concert halls, skate parks and a theme park.

Their iconic status, and the possibly prohibitive costs of demolishing the towers safely, looked to have cemented their status in Sheffield&#x27;s future as much as they were a part of its history, until the owner of the towers (and the now-demolished power station), E.ON UK, stated its intention to demolish them once the strengthening of the viaduct made it feasible.

The towers were demolished at 03:00 BST on 24 August 2008, though a significant portion of the north tower remained standing for a short while. The demolition attracted widespread attention. A viewing platform was set up so the public could watch the demolition. Part of the site has been converted for use as a biomass power station by the owners E.ON UK.

==In popular culture==
The Tinsley Viaduct is featured among several other locations as the site of &quot;ground zero&quot; for a fictional Soviet Union nuclear strike on Sheffield depicted in &quot;Threads&quot; (1984), a depiction of what might have happened had NATO and the Soviet Union entered conflict over hypothetical instability in Iran that escalated into full nuclear war. In the ensuing nuclear exchange, a one-megaton nuclear missile explodes above the Tinsley Viaduct, devastating most of surrounding Sheffield.

<text>TAXAN was a brand of Kaga Electronics Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan. It was founded in July 1981. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the US division published several video games on the NES and Game Boy. The company shut down in 1991 according to former employee Ken Lobb.

==Taxan (UK) Ltd and Taxan (Europe) Ltd==

On 12 December 1985, Kaga Electronic Company Ltd opened a UK office in Bracknell, Berkshire.

Taxan (UK) Ltd initially sold a range of monochrome and colour monitors for IBM, IBM-compatible and Apple personal computers as well the highly successful KP810 and KP910 dot matrix printers with NLQ printing technology.

The company appointed Northamber plc and P&amp;P Micro Distributors followed by Bytech Peripherals Ltd to sell Taxan products to computer resellers. In addition, Taxan appointed approximately 50 leading resellers who purchased directly from Taxan and were chosen specifically to build the brand in the UK. Taxan also supplied a number of system integrators and OEM customers either under the Taxan brand or original brand. This included Dell Computer Corporation who set up their first UK office in the building next door to Taxan.

Despite considerable success in the dot matrix printer market, Taxan (UK) Ltd made a decision in 1987 to focus on monitors and thus the KP815 and KP915 were the last printers sold in the UK.

By 1987, Taxan became the market leader in the UK and as a result of this position Kaga Electronics decided to transfer all activities for Europe to the UK office, renaming the Company Taxan (Europe) Ltd.

Taxan (Europe) Ltd expanded operations in Europe rapidly, which included opening subsidiary companies and offices in Germany, France, and Sweden. Distributors were appointed throughout Europe and the company enjoyed considerable growth.

In addition to selling computer monitors, the company also sold a range of graphics cards under Taxan brand. This included products designed and manufactured in Japan as well as a highly successful relationship with Paradise System Inc.

In 1987, Taxan added the ATI EGA Wonder Graphics adaptor (under the ATI brand) to its product range establishing a strong relationship with the founder of ATI Technologies in Toronto, Canada. This led to Taxan eventually working with ATI on an exclusive basis selling graphics adapters under the Taxan brand and eventually under the ATI brand only.

At its peak, Taxan (Europe) Ltd revenues exceeded $80 million per year.

<doc id="311468" wikidata="Q4689064" url="?curid=311468" title="Afghan Constitution Commission">
<text>The Afghan Constitution Commission (or Afghan Constitutional Commission) was established October 5, 2002 as required by the Bonn Agreement, which stipulated that a new Afghan constitution be adopted by a loya jirga. The loya jirga was required to convene within eighteen months of the establishment of Afghan Transitional Administration, which was established by the Emergency Loya Jirga in June 2002. After some delay, the proposed Afghan Constitution was presented to President Hamid Karzai on November 3, 2003. A loya jirga began December 14, 2003 (four days after schedule) in Kabul and was endorsed January 4, 2004.

==Make up of the commission==

The initial Commission was made up of nine members and started work on October 5, 2002. After its work was completed (although no draft was released) the initial Commission was replaced on May 7, 2003, by a 35-member Reviewing Commission, referred to as the Constitution Commission. The 35 members were all appointed by president Karzai. Seven of the members were women.

The commission set up eight regional offices in Jalalabad, Herat, Kunduz, Kabul, Gardez, Kandahar, Mazar and Bamyan as well as in the Pakistani cities of Peshawar and Quetta, and in the Iranian cities of Tehran and Mashhad.

The process was being monitored by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and was funded by the United Nations Development Programme.

==Consultation process==

Consultations with the Afghan public started June 10, 2003. Commission teams from Kabul and regional offices made trips through Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan. Afghan refugees in the United States were also said to be consulted. The commission also distributed posters and leaflets, and a monthly newsletter. Radio and television announcements were also made.

==Delays and final release==

The initial goal was for the commission to present the draft constitution by September 1, 2003, but in August commission members asked for a two-month delay to allow more time to gather reactions. On August 28 Ghulam Farooq Wardak announced that the loya jirga had been postponed until December 10. The commission wanted more time to consult with Afghans. Ghulam Farooq Wardak, the director of the commission&#x27;s secretariat, said the delay would give Afghans more time to decide if they wanted a republic, a parliamentary system, or a return to a monarchy. Other issues, he said, included the degree of centralization in Kabul and the role of Islam. He said 100,000 questionnaires from all provinces of Afghanistan had been completed and sent to the commission.

The Commission presented its proposed constitution on November 3, 2003. The ceremony was attended by president Karzai, former king Mohammad Zaher Shah, and United Nations special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi.

The draft was distributed throughout the country to Provincial Governors and Wuluswals for distribution to political leaders. It was also widely distributed via the Regional Offices of Secretariat of the Constitutional Commission to ELJ district representatives, to the media, including magazines Kellid and Morsal.

==Opposition to the proposed constitution==

Bacha Khan Zadran, a Pashtun warlord in Paktia province, criticized the proposed Constitution for abolishing the hereditary monarchy.

Mahbuba Hoquqmal, the Afghan Minister of Women&#x27;s Affairs, said the constitution does not grant protection to women&#x27;s property rights, and does not prevent women being forced to marry without their consent, and does not offer better guarantees of equal treatment by Afghanistan&#x27;s courts.

Members of Uzbeks, Turkmens and Baluch said that the Proposed Constitution alienated their cultures. For example, the draft states that Pashto and Dari would be the two official languages, and that the national anthem would be sung in Pashto.

Other issues raised by some loya jirga delegates included whether former king Mohammed Zahir Shah should maintain the title &quot;father of the nation,&quot; whether Afghanistan should be a free market economy, and whether higher education should be free.

<text>Asparuh (also &quot;Ispor&quot; or (rarely) &quot;Isperih&quot;) was а Bulgar khan in the second half of the 7th century and is credited with the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681.

==Early life==

The &quot;Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans&quot; states that Asparuh belonged to the Dulo clan and reigned for 61 years. This long period cannot be accepted as accurate due to chronological constraints, and may indicate the length of Asparuh&#x27;s life. According to the chronology developed by Moskov, Asparuh would have reigned 668–695. Other chronologies frequently end his reign in 700 or 701 but cannot be reconciled with the testimony of the &quot;Namelist&quot;. According to the Byzantine sources, Asparuh was a younger son of Kubrat, who had established a spacious state (&quot;Great Bulgaria&quot;) in the steppes of modern Ukraine. Asparuh may have gained experience in politics and statesmanship during the long reign of his father, who probably died in 665 (apud Moskov). According to Djagfar Tarikhy (a work of disputed authenticity) Asparuh was made the leader of the Onogur tribe by his father. After his father&#x27;s death, Asparuh would have acknowledged the rule of his older brother Bat Bayan, but the state disintegrated under Khazar attack in 668, and he and his brothers parted ways, leading their people to seek a more secure home in other lands.

==Establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire==

Asparuh was followed by 30,000 to 50,000 Bulgars. He reached the Danube and while the Byzantine capital Constantinople was besieged by Muawiyah I, Caliph of the Arabs (674–678), he and his people settled in the Danube delta, probably on the now-disappeared Peuce Island. After the Arab siege of Constantinople ended, the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IV marched against the Bulgars and their Slav allies in 680 and forced his opponents to seek shelter in a fortified encampment. Compelled to abandon the leadership of his army in order to seek medical treatment for his ailments in Anchialo (today&#x27;s Pomorie), Constantine IV inadvertently demoralized his troops, who gave in to rumours that their emperor had fled. With segments of the Byzantine army starting to desert, the Bulgars and their allies broke through the blockade and routed their enemy at the Battle of Ongala in 680. Asparuh then swiftly moved from the Danubian delta down to the Balkan range.

==Reign==

Asparuh&#x27;s victory led to the Bulgarian conquest of Moesia and the establishment of some sort of alliance between the Bulgars and the local Slavic groups (described as the Severi and Seven Slavic tribes). As Asparuh commenced to raid across the mountains into Byzantine Thrace in 681, Constantine IV decided to cut his losses and conclude a treaty, whereby the Byzantine Empire paid the Bulgars an annual tribute. These events are seen in retrospect as the establishment of the Bulgarian state and its recognition by the Byzantine Empire. In later tradition Asparuh is credited with building the major centers of Pliska and Drăstăr, as well as at least one of the Bulgarian &quot;limes&quot; walls from the Danube to the Black Sea. While the multi-tribal and hegemonic character of the Bulgarian state in the first century or two after its establishment is readily apparent, Bulgarian historians have stressed the establishment of a capital and of a state tradition that could be viewed retrospectively as national. According to a late tradition, Asparuh died fighting the Khazars on the Danube. According to one theory, advanced by the Bulgarian historian Vaklinov, his grave is located near Voznesenka (&quot;Ascension&quot;) on the Dnieper in Ukraine.

The town of Isperikh, several villages and Asparuh Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica are named after Asparuh of Bulgaria.

<doc id="311470" wikidata="Q336516" url="?curid=311470" title="Reverse domain hijacking">
<text>Reverse domain name hijacking (also known as reverse cybersquatting or commonly abbreviated as &#x27;RDNH&#x27;), occurs where a rightful trademark owner attempts to secure a domain name by making cybersquatting claims against a domain name’s &quot;cybersquatter&quot; owner. This often intimidates domain name owners into transferring ownership of their domain names to trademark owners to avoid legal action, particularly when the domain names belong to smaller organizations or individuals. Reverse domain name hijacking is most commonly enacted by larger corporations and famous individuals, in defense of their rightful trademark or to prevent libel or slander.

Reverse domain name &quot;hijacking&quot; is a legal remedy to counter the practice of domain squatting, wherein individuals hold many registered domain names containing famous third party trademarks with the intent of profiting by selling the domain names back to trademark owners. Trademark owners initially responded by filing cybersquatting lawsuits against registrants to enforce their trademark rights. However, as the number of cybersquatting incidents grew, trademark owners noticed that registrants would often settle their cases rather than litigate. Cybersquatting lawsuits are a defensive strategy to combat cybersquatting, however such lawsuits may also be used as a way of strongarming innocent domain name registrants into giving up domain names that the trademark owner is not, in fact, entitled to.

== UDRP restrictions on reverse domain name hijacking ==

Paragraph 15(e) of the UDRP rules defines reverse domain name hijacking as the filing of a complaint in bad faith, resulting in the abuse of the UDRP administrative process. It becomes difficult to objectively quantify what constitutes subjective “bad faith,” resulting in panels often viewing parties’ factual discrepancies as indeterminable or immaterial at best. Therefore, despite its express recognition in the UDRP, reverse domain name hijacking findings are rare and based heavily on the factual circumstances surrounding each case.

Circumstances which have been cited by WIPO panels as justification for a finding of reverse domain name hijacking includes:
* When the registration of the domain predates any trademark rights of the Complainant.
* When the complaint has provided no evidence of bad faith registration or use directed towards the Complainant.
* Where the Complainant has used the UDRP as a Plan &quot;B&quot; option to attempt to secure the domain after commercial negotiations have broken off.
* Where the Complainant has attempted to deceive the domain owner or makes misrepresentations or fails to disclose material information to the panel.

Examples of such findings include the following WIPO cases: Sanofi SA vs. Monogram Naming LLC over domain Initiv.com (2022). Gregory Ricks vs. RVK, Inc. (Formally RVKuhns and Associates) (2015). &quot;Ron Paul vs. RonPaul.org&quot; (2013), &quot;Webpass, Inc. v. Paul Breitenbach&quot; (2010), &quot;Urban Logic, Inc. vs. Urban Logic, Peter Holland&quot; (2009), &quot;David Robinson v. Brendan&quot; (2008), &quot;Decal v.

A list of over one hundred reverse domain name hijacking decisions is available at rdnh.com.

Although UDRP panelists currently have no tools by which to punish abuses such as Reverse Domain Name Hijacking, such a finding might be used in a local jurisdiction where such abuses might constitute a tort such as tortious interference with contract or an unfair business practice.

== ACPA restrictions on reverse domain name hijacking ==

The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act does not expressly recognize reverse domain name hijacking and often only limits defendants’ recovery to retention or transference of the domain name. It also fails to provide any remedies for victims of attempted reverse cybersquatting. However, the statute permits some monetary relief where bad faith, reckless disregard or the willful violation of a court order are involved.

Similarly, a 1975 amendment to the Lanham Act gives courts discretion in awarding reasonable attorneys’ fees to a prevailing party in “exceptional” circumstances. In attempting to define “exceptional,” Circuit courts are split as to what objectively constitutes malicious, fraudulent, or deliberate misconduct. Some courts award such fees where bad faith or baseless litigation is involved while other courts look for economic coercion or failure to reference controlling law. Nevertheless, due to the inherent animosity arising from being sued, courts generally hold prevailing defendants to a higher level of scrutiny, requiring vexatious or harassing conduct to shift attorney’s fees in their favor.

== Implications ==

Neither the UDRP nor the ACPA provides much deterrent to curb trademark owners’ abuse of their rights. To abate reverse domain name hijacking practices, some legal professionals believe Congress should enact laws that are specifically designed to facilitate litigation against reverse cybersquatters. Similarly, some advocates argue for stronger penalties to deter the unlawful deprivation of validly registered domain names, such as fines and precluding offending trademark owners from filing cybersquatting claims for a designated period of time.

<doc id="311477" wikidata="Q4992405" url="?curid=311477" title="Girlfriend in a Coma (novel)">
<text>Girlfriend in a Coma is a novel by Canadian writer and artist Douglas Coupland. It was first published by HarperCollins Canada in 1998. The novel tells the story of a group of friends growing up in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in the late 1970s. On the night of a teenage house-wrecking party, one of the protagonists, Karen, falls into a coma. More alarmingly, she seemed to expect it, having given her boyfriend, Richard, a letter detailing the vivid dreams of the future she had experienced and how she wanted to sleep for a thousand years to avoid that dystopia.

The book was named after the 1987 single &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma&quot; by The Smiths. Additionally, Coupland uses other Smiths lyrics, song and album titles within the book such as &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot;, &quot;Hand in Glove&quot;, and &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;.

==Plot summary==

The first part of the book covers the 17 years in the lives of a group of friends, after one of the friends, Karen, lapses into a coma. Richard has to cope with losing Karen but gaining a daughter, Megan, as fatherhood is thrust upon him: the outcome of their mutual loss of virginity just hours before Karen fell into her coma. Wendy throws herself into work and Linus loses himself, looking for that which is lost. Pamela becomes a supermodel and Hamilton a demolition expert, but none of the friends&#x27; lives turn out how they imagined. Broken and lacking, they return to the suburbs of their youth to try to pull themselves together until one day, almost two decades after she fell asleep, Karen regains consciousness.

The book is divided into three parts. The first chapter of the book is narrated by Jared, the ghost of a friend of the characters who died of leukemia at a young age. The rest of Part 1 is narrated by Richard, in the first person, as he tells the story of what happened in the 17 years.

The second part of the book, with no narrator, deals with Karen&#x27;s return to the world. It also begins to explain where she had been all those years and the reality she had hoped to escape. Then, suddenly, the world ends. This section is narrated in the third person, with insight into all the characters&#x27; minds.

The final part of the book details life after everyone except these seven people have fallen asleep and not reawakened. This section is again narrated by Jared. The characters have to deal with the end of the world as predicted by Karen in her coma.

==Characters==

; Karen
: Thrust into a coma after having a glimpse of the future, Karen is the tragic figure in this novel. She has a vision of the future she carries into her coma. Upon returning from her coma, she has the mind of a seventeen-year-old, and a daughter, Megan, physically the same age as she is mentally. She constantly wonders what the future and technology has really given humanity.
; Richard
: The boyfriend of the comatose girlfriend, and the father of her child, Richard&#x27;s struggle through life is one of the primary focuses of the first part of the novel. He was a close friend to Jared. Jared&#x27;s death and Karen&#x27;s coma cause Richard&#x27;s mental state to be quite weak. A frequent alcoholic, Richard struggles with addiction while waiting for Karen to possibly wake up.
; Wendy
: The smart one of the group, Wendy moves on to become a doctor working in the Emergency Room of the hospital. While the other characters seem to disappear into addiction or misery, Wendy gives herself to her schooling and work. She later gets together with Linus, though her heart still bears feelings for Jared.
; Linus
: Shortly after university, Linus leaves to travel the world in a quest to find himself. He spends quite a stay in Las Vegas, but what Linus finds does not give him the closure that he searches for. Instead, it leaves him feeling emptier than when he left. Linus later marries Wendy.
; Pamela
: Pamela is the supermodel of the group. She leaves the group to enter the decadent lifestyle of the rich and famous. Pamela continually drops celebrity names in conversation, and hints at many drug-induced exploits. She has a problem with heroin. She later marries Hamilton, with whom she indulges in her heroin frenzy.
; Hamilton
: Hamilton is an eccentric member of the group. He, too, has a problem with heroin. He later marries Pamela.
; Megan
: Born to Karen while in her coma, Megan is raised by Karen&#x27;s parents. She is a rebellious child, finding solace in thoughts of death. Her father, Richard, is distant yet there when needed. She dates a very low class man named Skitter, and becomes pregnant by him.
; Jared
: A high school friend of the main cast, Jared was very promiscuous. He was also a jock. At the beginning of the novel, he has already died of leukemia and exists as a ghost. The leukemia progressed rapidly, giving him little time after learning of his disease. He is the only other presence to visit the main cast after the End of the World.

==Inspiration==

In late 1995, Coupland was touring for Microserfs throughout Europe. Coupland returned from his tour burnt out and very fatigued mentally. The period after this tour was, for Coupland, &quot;one of the darkest periods of [his] life&quot;. &quot;I could barely open a can of soup or put gas in the car tank&quot;. During this dark period, Coupland began to write a new novel. This novel became &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma&quot;; however, he wasn&#x27;t sure where the novel was going to take him when he began to write it. The novel &quot;pretty well erupted out of [him]&quot;.

The novel is set in Vancouver &quot;because [his] brain was so incapacitated [he] decided [it] had to be set in [his] own neighbourhood.&quot;

Comas were also an inspiration for him. &quot;Comas really are peculiar only to the late 20th century. Before, say, 1960, people who might have gone into a coma simply died. Comas are more modern than plastics or TV. I like the notion that comas can allow a person to radically reinvent themselves upon awakening. I think we all want to do that—radically reinvent ourselves—I think it&#x27;s our deepest need.&quot;

Karen&#x27;s full name is Karen Ann McNeil and the circumstances of her lapse into a coma are similar to those in the famous Karen Ann Quinlan case.

The title, a Smiths song title, was chosen because &quot;It&#x27;s clearly descriptive of the book, but it&#x27;s also a little salute to those points in my life when I was melting down to soundtracks provided by British gloom rockers.&quot;

==History of the novel==

It is considered one of Coupland&#x27;s finest novels, with a stronger narrative than some of his earlier books but still providing relevant cultural criticism and commentary. In the UK, &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the book as Coupland &quot;becoming extraordinary&quot; (25 April 1998) and &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;a disturbing, thought-provoking and moving novel. &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma&quot; has something of the quality of a fairytale, but it contains a sharp realism that makes the book scarily contemporary&quot; (15 May 1999).

BBC Radio 3 broadcast an adaptation of the novel as part of its &quot;Drama on 3&quot; strand on 24 February 2008.


It was adapted by Dan Rebellato.

== Television adaptation ==
* It was announced on 22 January 2013, that NBC ordered a pilot for an adaptation. It is written by Liz Brixius and starring Christina Ricci and Miranda Cosgrove. On March 19, 2013, it was announced that Ricci would not be a part of the cast and the show was cancelled.
* A TV movie directed by David Frankel was in pre-production as of August 2013.

==Editions==
* (first edition, hardback, 1998)
* (paperback, 1999)
* (paperback, 2000)

<text>Nicolas Charles Oudinot, duc de [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (; 25 April 1767 – 13 September 1847), was a French general of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. He is known to have been wounded 34 times in battle, being hit by artillery shells, sabres, and at least twelve bullets over the course of his military career. A Marshal of the Empire, he is best known for his contributions to the Napoleonic Wars with his famous grenadier division. Oudinot is one of the Names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, Eastern pillar Columns 13, 14.

==Early life==
Nicolas Charles Oudinot was the son of Nicolas Oudinot and Marie Anne Adam, the only one of their nine children to live to adulthood. His father was a brewer, farmer and distiller of brandy in Bar-le-Duc, Lorraine. He decided upon a military career, and served in the regiment of Medoc from 1784 to 1787, when, having no hope of promotion on account of his non-noble birth, he retired with the rank of sergeant.

==French Revolutionary Wars==

The French Revolution changed his fortunes, and in 1792, on the outbreak of war, he was elected lieutenant-colonel of the 3rd battalion of the volunteers of the Meuse. His gallant defense of the little fort of Bitsch in the Vosges in 1792 drew attention to him; he was transferred to the regular army in November 1793, and after serving in numerous actions on the Belgian frontier he was promoted general of brigade, in June 1794 for his conduct at the Battle of Kaiserslautern.

He continued to serve with distinction on the German frontier under Louis Lazare Hoche, Charles Pichegru and Jean Victor Marie Moreau, was repeatedly wounded and once (in 1795) taken prisoner after having been wounded again. He was André Masséna&#x27;s right hand all through the Swiss campaign of 1799, first as a general of division, then as chief of staff, and won extraordinary distinction at the Second Battle of Zurich. He was present under Massena at the Siege of Genoa, and so distinguished himself at the Battle of Monzambano that Napoleon presented him with a sword of honour (an especially uncommon award replaced later by the Légion d&#x27;Honneur). He was made inspector-general of infantry, and, on the establishment of the empire, given the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, but was not included in the first creation of marshals.

==Napoleonic Wars==

Oudinot was elected a member of the chamber of deputies, but had little time to devote to politics. He took a leading role in the War of the Third Coalition, commanding the famous division of &quot;grenadiers Oudinot,&quot; made up of hand-picked troops and organised by him, with which he seized the Vienna bridges, received a wound at the Battle of Schöngrabern in Lower Austria against the Russians. In 1807, he participated in Joachim Murat&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Ostrolenka in Poland and fought with resolution and success at the Battle of Friedland.
In 1808 he was made governor of Erfurt and Count of the French Empire, and in 1809, after the Battle of Wagram, he was promoted to the rank of Marshal of France. He was made a titular duke in chief of the duché-grand fief of Reggio in the satellite Kingdom of Naples, and received a large money grant in April 1810.

From 1810 to 1812 Oudinot administered the government of the former Kingdom of Holland, and commanded the II Corps of La Grande Armée in the Russian campaign. His corps was instrumental in building the bridge over the Berezina that allowed the evacuation of troops after the defeat at the Battle of Berezina. During this period he suffered another wounding in battle.

He was present at the Battle of Lützen and the Battle of Bautzen, and when holding the independent command of the corps directed to take Berlin was defeated at the Battle of Grossbeeren. He was then superseded by Marshal Ney, but the latter was defeated at the Battle of Dennewitz.

Oudinot was not disgraced. He held important commands at the Battle of Leipzig and in the campaign of 1814. On Napoleon&#x27;s abdication, he rallied to the new government, and was made a Peer of France by the Bourbon Restoration King Louis XVIII. Unlike many of his old comrades, he did not desert to his former master during Bonaparte&#x27;s 1815 return.

==Later life==
His last active service was in the French invasion of Spain in 1823, in which he commanded a corps and was for a time governor of Madrid. He died as Governor of the Parisian veterans institution Les Invalides.

== Honours ==
* 1849 : Knight Grand Cross in the Order of Pope Pius IX.

==Personal life==
He married first, in September 1789, Charlotte Derlin (1768–1810) and had 7 children:
*Marie-Louise (1790–1832): wife (1808) of general Pierre Claude Pajol (1772–1844) 
*Charles (1791–1863)
*Nicolette (1795–1865): wife (1811) of general (1772–1855)
*Emilie (1796–1805)
*Auguste (1799–1835)
*Elise (1801–1882)
*Stephanie (1808–1893)

He married secondly, in January 1812, Eugenie de Coucy (1791–1868) and had 4 children:
*Louise-Marie (1816–1909)
*Caroline (1817–1896)
*Charles-Joseph (1819–1858)
*Henri (1822–1891)

<text>Sandton is a financial, commercial and residential area, located in the northern part of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. Formerly an independent municipality, Sandton&#x27;s name came from the combination of two of its suburbs, Sandown and Bryanston.

== History ==

===Early settlers===

Archaeological findings suggest the area which Sandton comprises today, had originally been occupied by various indigenous groups, before European settlement, most notably the Tswana and, to a lesser extent, Sotho people. The remains of an Iron Age smelter was discovered in Lone Hill, a suburb of northern Sandton.

One of the first Voortrekker parties to settle in the area were the Esterhuysen family on the farm Zandfontein (Afrikaans and Dutch for &quot;Sandy Spring&quot; or &quot;Sand Fountain&quot;). A monument to commemorate them may be found just off Adrienne Street in Sandown where the family cemetery is located.
Zandfontein, Driefontein (Afrikaans and Dutch for &quot;Three Springs/Fountains&quot;) and Rietfontein (Afrikaans and Dutch for &quot;Reed Spring&quot; or &quot;Fountain of Reeds&quot;) encumbered what was to become Sandton. The municipal coat of arms of Sandton pays homage to the three farms with three round fountain barrels on its chevron.

In the late 19th-century the Wilhelmi family of Hannover, Germany acquired the farm Driefontein No. 3 while Rietfontein was owned by the Ehler family. The original Driefontein homestead, now within the confines of the Field &amp; Study Centre, was looted during the Anglo-Boer War. The ruins are visible on the northern bank of the Klein Jukskei River. The Wilhemi family, upon return from Germany built the &#x27;new&#x27; 1906 Driefontein Farmhouse on what is present-day Fifteenth Street, Parkmore cum Riverclub. The farmhouse served as the icon and headquarters for the now defunct Sandton Historical Foundation and is listed as a City of Johannesburg Owned Heritage Site.

=== 1960s and 1970s===
Sandton was established as a separate municipality in 1969 by the office of the Administrator of the Transvaal. It had formerly not formed part of Johannesburg but was managed, in part by its administrators and Pretoria through the North Eastern Peri-Urban Land administration. Initially, it was very much a residential area consisting mostly of small holdings with a rural equestrian lifestyle attracting many of the upper-middle classes and Johannesburg elites.
Prior to the 1960s a stream was located at the site of present day Katherine Street.

The Rivonia Trial derives its name from the Liliesleaf Farm precinct situated in the Sandton suburb where many of the Black freedom fighters such as Nelson Mandela were captured by the South African state and subsequently tried for treason. Rivonia had previously been known as Edenburg and was changed to make itself distinct from Edenburg, Free State. It was named for the surname Riven.
Sandton and its constituencies were traditionally relatively more liberal than surrounds. For example, the motion which never materialised by residents in favour for the inclusion of Alexandra, Gauteng then a demarcated black township in terms of the Group Areas Act, into Sandton&#x27;s jurisdiction proved troublesome for the National Party government which had a strong constituency in the adjacent town of Randburg.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
The construction of Sandton City by Rapp &amp; Maister (which was eventually taken over by the Liberty Group which still retains 75% of the complex) marked a significant change for the Sandton area. It created rapid commercialisation and industrialisation. Sandton came to symbolise the White Flight movement of Johannesburg and secured itself as Johannesburg&#x27;s second Central Business District.
After the demise of Apartheid, by 1996, Sandton initially formed part of the interim Eastern Metropolitan Substructure, and in 2000 came to be included, along with the former towns of Randburg and Roodepoort, as part of the newly demarcated City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality thus losing its separate municipal government and town status. Despite this, Sandton is still unofficially regarded as a distinct region of the city and operates as a macro-suburb.

== Role in 21st century Johannesburg ==
=== Financial and business centre ===

Urban decay in downtown Johannesburg caused many corporate offices to move from the Johannesburg Central Business District to Sandton in the 1990s. It has become the new financial district of South Africa and Johannesburg&#x27;s premier business centre. Much of the financial focus of Johannesburg has shifted from the Central Business District to Sandton. However, three of South Africa&#x27;s four largest banks have kept their head offices in downtown Johannesburg. The other bank, Nedbank, has its headquarters in Sandton. A considerable amount of the city&#x27;s A-grade office space is to be found in Sandton. The JSE Securities Exchange, Johannesburg&#x27;s stock exchange, relocated its offices to Sandton from the central business district in the late 1990s.

Sandton is home to the Sandton Convention Centre, one of the largest convention centres on the continent and primary site of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (also known as &quot;Rio + 10&quot;), which Johannesburg hosted. The convention centre also hosted the African National Congress&#x27; victory celebrations after the party was re-elected at the 2004 election.

When it comes to green buildings in Africa, Sandton is an epicentre. One of the highest rated green buildings in South Africa – rated by Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA) – is Upper Grayston Office Park, located in Sandton.

=== Tourism and retail hub ===
One of the main attractions in Sandton is Sandton City, which ranks among the largest shopping centres in Africa. The completion of this precinct by the Liberty Group was the catalyst for the subsequent development of this entire area. Together with Nelson Mandela Square, the centre, with some 144,000 m2 of shopping space, is one of the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. Much of Johannesburg&#x27;s business tourism is centred on Sandton, which has various 5-star hotels under the Southern Sun, Hilton, Radisson and Protea brands.
Liberty Group announced in 2008 that Sandton City will receive a R 1.77-billion upgrade. Nelson Mandela Square, formerly known as Sandton Square, was renamed in March 2004, after the unveiling of a 6-metre bronze statue of the former South African president. Liliesleaf Farm, where Nelson Mandela lived in the early 1960s and where many leading political activists were arrested in 1963 and tried as part of the now infamous Rivonia Trial, is just north of Nelson Mandela Square, close to the N1 Highway, off Rivonia Road. Discovery Holdings has, in 2018, completed a large new head office along with shopping mall in the area.
A 55-floor mixed use building, The Leonardo, become the tallest building in all of Africa at the time following its completion in 2018, but has since been replaced by other taller buildings.

==Sandton Central Management District==
The central business area of Sandton is divided into three City Improvement Districts, which have a unified identity called the Sandton Central Management District, branded as &quot;Sandton Central&quot;. This district is responsible, using additional funds levied on its behalf by the municipality, for the provision of additional services. The Sandton Central Management district provides additional cleaning, law enforcement, beautification and planning services to the area it services.

== Geography ==
Sandton is located approximately 16 kilometres north of the Johannesburg CBD, bordered by Midrand to the north, Johannesburg to the south, Randburg to the west and Alexandra to the east. 

==Transport==

===Gautrain===
Sandton houses the flagship station of the Gautrain rapid rail link. The station is located on the corner of West Street and Rivonia Road. The system has direct connections to OR Tambo International Airport and an inter-city commuter service from Pretoria through Rosebank to Johannesburg Park Station Sandton&#x27;s associated Gaubus network comprises direct routes to Fourways, Gallo Manor, Randburg and Rivonia. People can also connect busses and travel to many parts of Centurion, Marlboro, Parktown, Rosebank and Pretoria using the service.

=== Roads ===
The main freeway to get in to the city is the M1 freeway through the M60 at Marlboro Drive, the M40 at Grayston Drive and the M30 at Corlett Drive. The N1 freeway (Western Bypass) passes through the northern part of Sandton, with off-ramps at the M9 (Rivonia Road) &amp; R511/M81 (Winnie Mandela Drive). One can use the M9, M27, M71, M75 and M85 metropolitan routes.

==Education==

The main campus of the &quot;Lycée Jules Verne&quot;, a French international school, is in Sandton.

<text>Hovertank One, also known under a variety of other names (Hovertank or Hovertank 3D), is a vehicular combat game developed by id Software and published by Softdisk in April 1991.

==Plot==
&quot;Hovertank One&quot; is set during a nuclear war. In &quot;Hovertank One&quot;, the player controls Brick Sledge, a mercenary hired by an unknown organization (referred to by the game as the &quot;UFA&quot;) to rescue people from cities under the threat of nuclear attack (largely political activists or scientists), both by the government and by large corporations, but the cities are also full of mutated humans, strange creatures and enemy hovertanks.

== Gameplay ==

The player must drive a hovertank through the levels and try to find the people Brick is supposed to rescue. There are many enemies in the levels, who are hunting down the people as well as the player. The player can keep track of both people and enemies in the radar box at the bottom of the screen. There is a timer that counts how long until the nuke is dropped. Once all the living people are collected a yellow teleporter appears somewhere in the level, and the player must find it to win. The player receives their fee, based on the number of people safely rescued, and how fast the operation was completed. All damage to the hovertank is repaired at the end of the level.

==Development==
John Carmack&#x27;s research in the game&#x27;s engine took six weeks, two weeks longer than any id engine before it. The engine written for this game was expanded upon with texture mapping to make &quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot;, and then later &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;. Following the engine&#x27;s completion, the id staff decided on the nuclear war theme and developed the game. Adrian Carmack enjoyed drawing the monsters and other ghoulish touches. The credits are John Carmack and John Romero as programmers, Tom Hall as game designer and Adrian Carmack as video game artist.

The source code to the game, owned by Flat Rock Software, was released in June 2014 under GNU GPL-2.0-or-later in a manner similar those done by id and partners.

==Reception==
&quot;Hovertank One&quot; is a landmark 3D game. Other 3D titles at the time, such as flight simulators and other games (such as &quot;Alpha Waves&quot;) that had more detailed environments, were noticeably slower. A similar engine was used by &quot;MIDI Maze&quot; for the Atari ST in 1987, as well as &quot;Wayout&quot; for the Apple II from 1982 and &quot;The Eidolon&quot; from 1985 for the Atari 8-bit.

<text>Catacomb 3-D (also known as Catacomb 3-D: A New Dimension, Catacomb 3-D: The Descent, and Catacombs 3) is a first-person shooter video game, the third in the &quot;Catacomb&quot; series, the first of which to feature 3D computer graphics. It was developed by id Software and originally published by Softdisk under the Gamer&#x27;s Edge label, released in November 1991. The player takes control of the high wizard Petton Everhail, descending into the catacombs of the Towne Cemetery to defeat the evil lich Nemesis and rescue his friend Grelminar.

&quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot; is a landmark title in terms of first-person graphics. It is one of the first examples of the modern, character-based first-person shooter genre, and a direct ancestor to the games that popularized the genre. It was released for MS-DOS with EGA graphics. The game introduced the concept of showing the player&#x27;s hand in the three-dimensional viewpoint, and an enhanced version of its technology was later used for the more successful &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;. The game&#x27;s more primitive technological predecessor was &quot;Hovertank 3D&quot;. The game was published at retail by GT Interactive as &quot;Catacomb 3&quot; in 1993. A special collector&#x27;s edition box containing three variations of the game by Romero Games was released in 2024.

==Production==
The origin of the games is &quot;Catacomb&quot; by John Carmack for IBM PC compatibles and Apple II. This was a two-dimensional game using a third-person view from above, released in 1989–1990. It was followed up with &quot;Catacomb II&quot;, which used the same game engine with new levels. The first release of &quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot; was called &quot;Catacomb 3-D: A New Dimension&quot;, but was later re-released as &quot;Catacomb 3-D: The Descent&quot;, as well as &quot;Catacombs 3&quot; for a re-release as commercially packaged software (the earlier versions had been released by other means such as disk magazines and downloads). The game creators were John Carmack, John Romero, Jason Blochowiak (programmers), Tom Hall (creative director), Adrian Carmack (artist), and Robert Prince (musician). The game was programmed using the Borland C++ programming language.

id Software&#x27;s use of texture mapping in &quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot; was influenced by &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; (still in development at &quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot;″s release). Conflicting accounts exist regarding the extent of this influence, however. In the book &quot;Masters of Doom&quot;, author David Kushner asserts that the concept was discussed only briefly during a 1991 telephone conversation between &quot;Underworld&quot; developer Paul Neurath and John Romero. In contrast, Paul Neurath has stated multiple times that John Carmack and John Romero had seen the game&#x27;s 1990 CES demo, and recalled a comment from Carmack that he could write a faster texture mapper.

==&quot;Catacomb Adventure Series&quot;==
&quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot; was followed by three games, in the so-called &quot;Catacomb Adventure Series&quot;. They were not developed by id Software but internally by Softdisk with a new staff for Gamer&#x27;s Edge, who also made the later &quot;Dangerous Dave&quot; sequels. All of the games, including the original &quot;Catacomb&quot; titles, are now distributed legally by Flat Rock Software through their own web store and via GOG.com. Flat Rock have also released the source code for the games under GNU GPL-2.0-or-later in June 2014 in a manner similar those done by id and partners. This has led to the creation of the source port &quot;Reflection Catacomb&quot;, also called &quot;Reflection Keen&quot; due to shared support for &quot;Keen Dreams&quot;, and ports all of the 3D &quot;Catacomb&quot; games to modern systems. Another project, &quot;CatacombGL&quot;, is an enhanced OpenGL port for Microsoft Windows and Linux.

The credits for the series are Mike Maynard, James Row, Nolan Martin (programming), Steven Maines (art direction), Carol Ludden, Jerry Jones, Adrian Carmack (art production), James Weiler, Judi Mangham (quality assurance), and id Software (3D imaging effects). The series&#x27; development head, Greg Malone, later became creative director for &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; and also worked on &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; for 3D Realms. Department heads Mike Maynard and Jim Row, meanwhile, would co-found JAM Productions (soon joined by Jerry Jones), the creators of &quot;Blake Stone&quot; using an enhanced &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; engine.

The series also introduced an item called crystal hourglasses, which would temporarily freeze time and allow the player to stage shots to destroy enemies upon the resumption of normal time, pre-dating later bullet time features in games such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Max Payne&quot;.

===&quot;Catacomb Abyss&quot;===

&quot;Catacomb Abyss&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot;, and featured the same main character in a new adventure: since his defeat, some of Nemesis&#x27; minions have built a mausoleum in his honour. Fearful of the dark mage&#x27;s return, the townspeople hire Everhail to descend below and end the evil. The environments are more varied than in &quot;Catacomb 3D&quot;, featuring crypts, gardens, mines, aqueducts, volcanic regions and various other locales. It was the only game in the series that was distributed as shareware, released by Softdisk in 1992.

===&quot;Catacomb Armageddon&quot;===

&quot;Catacomb Armageddon&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Catacomb Abyss&quot;, only now set in the present day. The levels feature towns, forests, temples, torture chambers, an ant colony, and a crystal maze. It was developed by Softdisk and was later republished by Froggman under the title &quot;Curse of the Catacombs&quot;.

===&quot;Catacomb Apocalypse&quot;===
&quot;Catacomb Apocalypse&quot; is the final game in the &quot;Catacomb Adventure Series&quot;. It was set in the distant future, accessible via time portals, and mixed fantasy and science fiction elements, pitting players against robotic necromancers and the like. It is also the only game in the trilogy to have a hub system, though it was present in the original &quot;Catacomb 3D&quot;. It was developed by Softdisk and later republished by Froggman under the title &quot;Terror of the Catacombs&quot;.

==Reception==
According to John Romero, the team felt it lacked the coolness and fun of &quot;Commander Keen&quot;, although the 3D technology was interesting to work with. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in May 1993 called &quot;The Catacomb Abyss&quot; &quot;very enjoyable&quot; despite the &quot;minimal&quot; EGA graphics and sound. The magazine stated in February 1994 that &quot;Terror of the Catacombs&quot;″s &quot;playability is good, almost addictive, and offers bang for the buck in spite of its lackluster&quot; EGA graphics. Transend Services Ltd. sold over 1,000 copies of the game in the first month of its release.

<doc id="311488" wikidata="Q62202" url="?curid=311488" title="Peter Struck (politician)">
<text>Peter Struck (24 January 1943 – 19 December 2012) was the German Minister of Defence under chancellor Gerhard Schröder from 2002 to 2005. A lawyer, Struck was a member of the Social Democratic Party.

==Education==
* 1962: Abitur
* 1964: Member of the SPD

Struck studied law at the universities of Göttingen and Hamburg. In 1971 he graduated to &quot;Dr. iur.&quot; (Doctor of Laws).

==Political career==
Peter Struck was a member of the Bundestag from 1980 until 2009. He first became a member of the Bundestag in the 1980 West German elections, via the party list, for the constituency of Celle-Uelzen. Due to his growing popularity, in the years 1998, 2002 and 2005, Struck was directly elected. From 1990 to 1998 he was whip (&quot;Parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer&quot;) of the SPD parliamentary group. From 1998 to 2002 he was chairman of the SPD parliamentary group.

===Federal Minister of Defence, 2002-2005===
In 2002 Struck succeeded Rudolf Scharping as Federal Minister of Defence, and served in that position until 2005.

During Struck&#x27;s tenure, Germany was trying to revamp its military into a nimbler fighting force capable of responding to smaller, regional conflicts. While being a strong supporter of conscription, Struck announced in 2003 that Germany would reduce its military by more than 10 percent by 2010, leaving 250,000 troops. Also, he ordered a reduction in Germany&#x27;s inventory of heavy Leopard 2 tanks from almost 2,000 to 350. At the time, he said the cuts were necessary because of strained finances and a need to adapt to new security needs; in 2003, he had to work with a defence budget of a mere 1.48 percent of Germany&#x27;s gross domestic product, compared with the 2 percent average of his European Union counterparts. Under Struck&#x27;s plan, the military&#x27;s civilian work force was to be reduced by 45,000, to 75,000, and as many as 100 military bases closed.

During his time at the Defence Ministry, Struck oversaw the early years of Germany&#x27;s engagement in Afghanistan, famously coining the phrase that &quot;German security is being defended in the Hindu Kush&quot;. In 2004, he said “there will be a clear no from the German side” to any request to place the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force and Operation Enduring Freedom under a unified command, expressing fears a unified command could be a step towards merging the two forces and that political opposition and military dangers could increase if their soldiers were identified with the US-led coalition.

After Germany joined with France in April 2003 to announce the creation of a European Union defense group with a military planning unit separate from NATO, Struck later held that no separate headquarters was necessary and that a planning staff for eventual operations under solely European auspices should be attached to NATO.

In 2003, Struck dismissed General Reinhard Günzel, the commander of a German special forces army unit, after he praised Martin Hohmann, a conservative member of Parliament, for a speech that had been widely criticized as anti-Semitic; Struck called Günzel a &quot;lone, confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement.&quot;

After accusations began appearing in the German press that conscripts in the German Army had been physically abused by trainers at some of the country&#x27;s army bases, Struck announced in December 2004 that 30 or 40 trainers were being investigated.

Following a 2004 trip to the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, Struck was hospitalized with a mild stroke.

===Chairman of the SPD Parliamentary Group, 2005-2009===
After the 2005 elections, Struck became &quot;Fraktionschef&quot; (chairman) of the SPD parliamentary group once again, until his retirement in 2009.

Between 2007 and 2009, Struck served as co-chair (alongside Günther Oettinger) of the Second Commission on the modernization of the federal state (&quot;Föderalismuskommission II&quot;), which had been established to reform the division of powers between federal and state authorities in Germany.

After retiring from active politics following the 2009 elections, Struck served as chairman of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, a political think tank with connections to the SPD.

==Death==
Struck suffered from poor health in the last several years of his career and died of a heart attack in the Charité hospital in Berlin on 19 December 2012. Funeral guests included the President of the Bundestag, Norbert Lammert, former chancellors Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schröder, the Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia Hannelore Kraft, SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel, former Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück, and the chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group in the Bundestag, Volker Kauder. Thomas de Maizière, Frank-Walter Steinmeier and General Wolfgang Schneiderhan gave eulogies.

==Controversies==
When an elderly man was severely beaten up in Munich by two immigrant youths, Struck claimed that his political opponent, Roland Koch, was probably happy for the beating because now Koch could start a supposedly polemic discussion about problems with young violent immigrants. When Koch demanded an apology, Struck replied &quot;Bite me!&quot;. In a Parliament debate some days later, Jürgen Gehb, CDU Speaker for law politics, said that &quot;we will try to continue working with you, but with minimal contact to your backside&quot;.

At a 2002 meeting of NATO defense ministers in Warsaw, United States Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld refused to meet Struck after Chancellor Gerhard Schröder had won narrow re-election in part by opposing the American-led Iraq War.

==Quotes==
Peter Struck is famous for two quotes:
*&quot;The security of the Federal Republic of Germany is being defended in the Hindu Kush too&quot;.
:&quot;as Minister of Defence, reconciling the traditional view of the Bundeswehr as defence-only army with the problems of asymmetric war.&quot;
*&quot;Legislation always obeys the First Struckian Law: No bill comes out of Parliament in the form it came into Parliament.&quot;
:&quot;as SPD whip, rather humorously describing the legislative process.&quot;

<doc id="311490" wikidata="Q339228" url="?curid=311490" title="Acclaim Entertainment">
<text>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. was an American video game publisher based in Glen Cove, New York. Originally founded by Greg Fischbach, Robert Holmes, and Jim Scoroposki from a storefront in Oyster Bay in 1987, the company built a global development team through a series of acquisitions during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Following disappointing financial results in their 2003 fiscal year, Acclaim filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2004. The properties owned by Acclaim were subsequently auctioned off to various parties.

== History ==
=== 1987–1990: Founding ===
In the early 1980s, Greg Fischbach was employed by the American video game company Activision, where he worked alongside Robert Holmes and Jim Scoroposki. After leaving Activision, he joined RCA Records, which was subsequently acquired by Bertelsmann, leaving Fischbach unemployed. In 1987, he met with Scoroposki in Oyster Bay, where Scoroposki owned a sales rep company, to discuss a potential joint venture. After Scoroposki suggested that they re-enter the video game industry, they contacted Holmes to join them, and the three co-founded Acclaim Entertainment. Acclaim did not secure any venture financing and was entirely financed by Fischbach and Scoroposki. In its early years, Acclaim operated exclusively as a video game publisher, either outsourcing the development of its video games to external developers or localizing existing titles from overseas. However, as the company expanded, it acquired several independent studios, including Iguana Entertainment of Austin, Texas; Probe Entertainment of London, England; and Sculptured Software of Salt Lake City, Utah.

The company&#x27;s name was chosen to ensure it was alphabetically positioned above its co-founder&#x27;s former employer, Activision, as well as above Accolade, another company established by former Activision employees. This naming convention was a common practice among new companies founded by ex-Activision employees, as the founders of Activision had similarly adopted this strategy when they left Atari.

Many of Acclaim&#x27;s products featured licenses from popular comics, television series, and movies. Fischbach noted that during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the video game market was less discerning, with specialized gaming publications exerting minimal influence on consumer opinion. Consequently, leveraging a popular license became one of the few reliable strategies to persuade retailers to stock a game. In its early years, the company entered into an agreement with Interactive VCR Games Inc., whose bestsellers included &quot;NFL Quarterback&quot;, to produce interactive VCR games, as well as expand into the handheld game market. Acclaim was also responsible for porting many of Midway&#x27;s arcade games in the early to mid-1990s, including the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series. Additionally, they published several games from companies that, at the time of publication, did not have an American branch, such as Technōs Japan&#x27;s &quot;Double Dragon II: The Revenge&quot; and Taito&#x27;s &quot;Bust-a-Move&quot; series.

=== 1990–2004: Success ===
In 1990, Acclaim partnered with TV producer Saban Entertainment and distributor Bohbot Entertainment to launch &quot;Video Power&quot;, which subsequently premiered in the fall of 1990. 

In December 1993, Acclaim signed a distribution deal with the European Spanish branch of Buena Vista Home Video, allowing the company to distribute its titles in Spain.

In May 1994, Tom Petit, former president of Sega Enterprises USA, who had worked at Sega for nine years, became the president of Acclaim&#x27;s coin-op division.

Throughout much of the 1990s, Acclaim was one of the most successful publishers of console video games in the world. In the financial year ending August 1994, the company reported a profit of $481 million, which rose to $585 million the following year. Franchises such as &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, &quot;NBA Jam&quot;, and &quot;NFL Quarterback Club&quot; served as reliable cash cows for Acclaim. Acclaim&#x27;s expansion continued with the signing of a relationship with Marvel Entertainment Group, wherein Acclaim managed the video game licenses for some of Marvel&#x27;s comic book properties. Later that year, the company acquired a minority interest in the FMV gaming studio Digital Pictures and began releasing its titles through Acclaim Distribution.

In 1995, the company acquired Sculptured Software, Iguana Entertainment, and Probe Entertainment, with these entities transitioning to the first-party development studio known as Acclaim Studios from 1999 to 2004. Acclaim&#x27;s gaming business further expanded with the acquisition of exclusive rights to publish Taito&#x27;s games in the Western Hemisphere. The company also constructed a motion capture studio at its headquarters, making it the first video game company to have an in-house motion capture facility.

A less prominent aspect of Acclaim&#x27;s business was the development and publication of strategy guides related to their software products, along with the issuance of &quot;special edition&quot; comic magazines via Acclaim Comics to support their more lucrative brand names. Additionally, they created the ASF/AMC motion capture format, which remains in use in the industry today.

Acclaim enjoyed a long-standing relationship with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) that dates back to 1988&#x27;s &quot;WWF WrestleMania&quot;. However, after failing to replicate the success of World Championship Wrestling (WCW)&#x27;s THQ/AKI games during the Monday Night Wars, the WWF announced in April 1998 that it would not renew its deal with Acclaim, opting instead to sign a joint-publishing agreement with Jakks Pacific and THQ after WCW&#x27;s contract with the latter publisher expired and signed a deal with rival Electronic Arts. 

In October 1999, Acclaim signed a contract with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) to publish video games based on the promotion. Under this agreement, Acclaim released two video games until ECW declared bankruptcy in 2001, leaving the promotion still owing Acclaim money. The game publisher subsequently released three wrestling titles under the &quot;Legends of Wrestling&quot; banner during its final years.

=== 2004: Decline and bankruptcy ===
Acclaim faced significant financial difficulties in 2004, primarily due to poor sales of its video game titles. This situation led to the closure of Acclaim Studios Cheltenham and Acclaim Studios Manchester in England, along with other locations, and resulted in their filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, leaving many employees unpaid. Among the titles under development at the UK studios were &quot;Emergency Mayhem&quot;, &quot;ATV Quad Power Racing 3&quot;, &quot;The Last Job&quot;, &quot;Interview with a Made Man&quot;, and &quot;Kung Faux&quot;.

In May 2004, it was announced that Major League Baseball had revoked its licensing agreement with Acclaim for the &quot;All-Star Baseball&quot; franchise due to a failure to make royalty payments. The following month, in June, &quot;Turok&quot; owners Classic Media announced that they had terminated Acclaim&#x27;s video game rights to the franchise, also due to non-payment of royalties.

When Acclaim&#x27;s agreement with GMAC Commercial Finance, their primary lender, expired on August 20, 2004, the company closed all of its facilities on August 27. This closure resulted in the termination of all employees at the Austin and New York studios. Prior to the closures, Acclaim employed 585 staff worldwide as of March 31, 2004. On August 30, Acclaim announced its intention to file for bankruptcy, officially filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy with the United States bankruptcy court in Central Islip, New York on September 1. 

In September 2005, a complaint filed in the same court sought to hold the company&#x27;s founders, including Fischbach and Scorposki, and several executives accountable for Acclaim&#x27;s financial losses shortly before the bankruptcy filing, seeking in damages.

== Asset selling ==
On October 1, 2004, Rod Cousens acquired the former Acclaim Studios Cheltenham and Acclaim Studios Manchester development studios, along with several of its unfinished projects. Cousens sought to reopen the studios under a new publisher provisionally named &quot;Exclaim&quot; on October 11, but his efforts were hindered by a lawsuit and legal disputes over Acclaim&#x27;s intellectual property, with both US and UK administrators asserting their claims.

Following interested offers from Take Two Interactive, it was announced on October 8 that THQ had acquired the worldwide publishing rights to &quot;Juiced&quot;.

In November 2004, Acclaim&#x27;s headquarters were sold to Anthony Pistilli of Pistilli Realty Group for $6 million.

On April 20, 2005, Fund4Games announced that Acclaim&#x27;s upcoming European titles had been sold to them, with &quot;Interview with a Made Man&quot; and &quot;ATV Quad Power Racing 3&quot; being returned to development at the Manchester studios, which were reopened by Fund4Games under the name Silverback Studios. In June 2006, Mastertronic announced that it had acquired the publishing rights to &quot;Made Man&quot; in Europe.

The &quot;Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX&quot; and &quot;ATV: Quad Power Racing&quot; franchises were sold to Crave Entertainment in July 2005.

In August 2005, former Activision executive Howard Marks acquired the Acclaim brand and logo for a reported $100,000. At the beginning of 2006, Marks established a new company named Acclaim Games. According to a job listing for the company, Acclaim Games targeted the US and UK preteen multiplayer markets. However, the second iteration of Acclaim struggled due to connectivity and payment issues for their online games, as well as a lack of action against dishonest players, earning this iteration an &quot;F&quot; grade from the Los Angeles/Southern California Better Business Bureau.

In 2006, Throwback Entertainment acquired more than 50 of Acclaim&#x27;s games and committed to bringing titles such as &quot;Re-Volt&quot;, &quot;Extreme-G&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Vexx&quot;, &quot;Fur Fighters&quot;, and many other franchises into the next generation and beyond.

In March 2007, budget publisher XS Games acquired the publishing rights to &quot;The Red Star&quot;, with Take-Two Interactive managing European distribution. In April 2007, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, then the North American distributor for Codemasters&#x27; products, announced that the British publisher had acquired the rights to &quot;Emergency Mayhem&quot;.

In July 2010, the South Korean-based company We Go Interactive acquired &quot;Re-Volt&quot;, &quot;RC Revenge&quot;, and &quot;RC De Go!&quot; (developed and owned by Taito) from Throwback.

In May 2016, the Acclaim brand itself—distinct from any of the intellectual property previously held by Acclaim—was acquired by Collectorvision, an independent game developer, publisher, and manufacturer.

In October 2018, Liquid Media Group purchased 65 former Acclaim titles from Throwback for $1 million. This acquisition primarily included installments in the &quot;NBA Jam&quot;, &quot;AFL Live&quot;, &quot;All-Star Baseball&quot;, and &quot;NFL Quarterback Club&quot; franchises, as well as games from Japanese developer Taito that Acclaim had published outside of Japan.

== Controversies == 
During Acclaim&#x27;s decline towards bankruptcy, the company made several controversial business and marketing decisions in the United Kingdom. One notable example was a promise to award a US$10,000 (£6,000) prize to UK parents who named their baby &quot;Turok&quot; to promote the release of &quot;&quot;. A subsequent investigation by &quot;VG247&quot; revealed that all those who had reportedly changed their names were actors. Another controversial initiative involved an attempt to purchase advertising space on tombstones for &quot;Shadow Man: 2econd Coming&quot;. To promote &quot;Burnout 2: Point of Impact&quot;, Acclaim offered to reimburse any driver in the United Kingdom who received a speeding ticket. However, following negative reactions from the UK government, the plan was ultimately canceled.

In the United States, Acclaim faced multiple lawsuits, several of which involved former partners. Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen sued over unpaid royalties. Another lawsuit was brought by Acclaim&#x27;s own investors, who claimed that Acclaim management had published misleading financial reports.

In the final iteration of the BMX series, &quot;BMX XXX&quot;, nudity and semi-nudity (including full motion video of strippers and nude female riders) were incorporated in an attempt to boost sales. However, like most of Acclaim&#x27;s video games during the company&#x27;s final years, &quot;BMX XXX&quot; sold poorly and was criticized for its sexual content and subpar gameplay. Dave Mirra publicly disowned the game, stating that he had no involvement in the decision to include nudity, and he subsequently sued Acclaim out of concern for being associated with &quot;BMX XXX&quot;.

In 1997, two years after its acquisition of Sculptured Software, Acclaim terminated approximately half of the staff at the Salt Lake City studio, violating the terms of the contracts it had provided to employees, which appeared to be iron-clad and included stock that would vest over the contract period. The layoffs were abrupt, forcing employees to choose between accepting a reasonable severance package (the terms of which changed multiple times during the initial weeks after the layoff) and foregoing the right to sue, or joining other creditors in litigation, thereby losing their severance packages. In 2007, one of several class action suits filed on behalf of stockholders was won, enabling some employees to recover a portion of the stock that had vested.

<doc id="311501" wikidata="Q16321" url="?curid=311501" title="Sphenoid bone">
<text>The sphenoid bone is an unpaired bone of the neurocranium. It is situated in the middle of the skull towards the front, in front of the basilar part of the occipital bone. The sphenoid bone is one of the seven bones that articulate to form the orbit. Its shape somewhat resembles that of a butterfly, bat or wasp with its wings extended. The name presumably originates from this shape, since () means in Ancient Greek.

==Structure==
It is divided into the following parts:
* a median portion, known as the body of sphenoid bone, containing the sella turcica, which houses the pituitary gland as well as the paired paranasal sinuses, the sphenoidal sinuses
* two greater wings on the lateral side of the body and two lesser wings from the anterior side.
* Pterygoid processes of the sphenoides, directed downwards from the junction of the body and the greater wings.

Two sphenoidal conchae are situated at the anterior and inferior part of the body.

=== Intrinsic ligaments of the sphenoid ===
The more important of these are: 
* the pterygospinous, which stretches between the spina angularis and the lateral pterygoid plate, superiorly attached to the root of the lateral pterygoid plate anteriorly; 
* the interclinoid ligament, a band of dura mater that connects the anterior clinoid process and posterior clinoid process of the sphenoid bone;
* the caroticoclinoid, connecting the anterior to the middle clinoid process.

These ligaments occasionally ossify, though the incidence of ligamentous ossification (both partial and complete) varies according to the ligament type, with the interclinoid ligament being most commonly identified as having ossified and the pterygoalar ligament least commonly identified.

===Features===
* pterygoid notch
* pterygoid fossa
* scaphoid fossa
* pterygoid hamulus
* pterygoid canal
* pterygospinous process
* sella turcica

===Articulations===
The sphenoid articulates with the frontal, parietal, ethmoid, temporal, zygomatic, palatine, vomer, and occipital bones and helps to connect the neurocranium to the facial skeleton.

==Body of sphenoid==

===Superior or cerebral surface===

Articulates with ethmoid bone anteriorly and basilar part of occipital bone posteriorly.
It shows:
# Jugum sphenoidale
# Sulcus chiasmaticus
# Tuberculum sellae
# Sella turcica
# Dorsum sellae
# Clivus

===Inferior surface===

# Rostrum of sphenoid
# Sphenoidal conchae
# Vaginal processes of medial pterygoid plate

===Anterior surface===

Sphenoidal crest articulates with the perpendicular plate of ethmoid leading to formation of a part of the septum of nose.

===Posterior surface===

Basilar part of occipital bone

===Lateral surface===

Carotid sulcus lodging cavernous sinus and internal carotid artery

==Sphenoidal sinuses==
Sphenoidal or sphenoid sinuses are asymmetrical air sinuses in the body of the sphenoid, closed by sphenoidal conchae.

==Greater wings==
===Superior or cerebral surface===

This forms the floor of the middle cranial fossa. It presents (starting from the front):
* foramen rotundum
* foramen ovale
*Sphenoidal emissary foramen
* foramen spinosum

===Lateral surface===

This is divided into (by infratemporal crest):
* Upper or temporal surface
* Lower or infratemporal surface

Foramen pierce it:
* Foramen ovale
* Foramen spinosum

===Orbital surface===
This forms the posterior wall of the orbit

==Lesser wings==
These are two triangular wings projecting laterally from anterosuperior part of the body. Each consists of:
* A base forming medial end of the wing.
* Tip forming the lateral end of the wing.
* Superior surface forming floor of anterior cranial fossa.
* Inferior surface forming upper boundary of superior orbital fissure.
* Posterior surface projects into the Sylvian point.
* Medially, terminates in the anterior clinoid process.

===Development===

Until the seventh or eighth month of fetal development, the body of the sphenoid consists of two parts: one in front of the tuberculum sellae, the presphenoid, with which the small wings are continuous; the other, consisting of the sella turcica and dorsum sellae, the postsphenoid, with which are associated the great wings, and pterygoid processes.

The greater part of the bone is ossified in cartilage. There are fourteen centers in all, six for the presphenoid and eight for the postsphenoid.

==== Presphenoid ====
By about the ninth week of fetal development an ossific center appears for each of the small wings (orbito-sphenoids) just lateral to the optic foramen; this is followed by the appearance of two nuclei in the presphenoid part of the body.

The sphenoidal conchae are each developed from a center that makes its appearance about the fifth month; at birth they consist of small triangular laminae, and it is not until the third year that they become hollowed out and coneshaped; about the fourth year they fuse with the labyrinths of the ethmoid bone, and between the ninth and twelfth years they unite with the sphenoid bone.

==== Postsphenoid ====
The first ossific nuclei are those for the great wings (alisphenoids). One makes its appearance in each wing between the foramen rotundum and foramen ovale about the eighth week. The orbital plate and that part of the sphenoid, which is found in the temporal fossa, as well as the lateral pterygoid plate, are ossified in membrane (Fawcett).

Soon after, the centers for the postsphenoid part of the body appear, one on either side of the sella turcica, and become blended together about the middle of fetal life.

Each medial pterygoid plate (except its hamulus) is ossified in membrane, and its center probably appears about the ninth or tenth week; the hamulus becomes chondrified during the third month, and almost at once ossifies (Fawcett).

The medial joins the lateral pterygoid plate about the sixth month.

About the fourth month, a center appears for each lingula and speedily joins the rest of the bone.

The presphenoid is united to the postsphenoid about the eighth month, and at birth the sphenoid is in three pieces [Fig. 4]: a central, consisting of the body and small wings, and two lateral, each comprising a great wing and pterygoid process.

In the first year after birth the great wings and body unite, and the small wings extend inward above the anterior part of the body, and, meeting with each other in the middle line, form an elevated smooth surface, termed the jugum sphenoidale.

By the twenty-fifth year the sphenoid and occipital are completely fused.

Between the pre- and postsphenoid there are occasionally seen the remains of a canal, the canalis cranio-pharyngeus, through which, in early fetal life, the hypophyseal diverticulum of the buccal ectoderm is transmitted.

The sphenoidal sinuses are present as minute cavities at the time of birth (Onodi), but do not attain their full size until after puberty.

==Function==
This bone assists with the formation of the base and the sides of the skull, and the floors and walls of the orbits. It is the site of attachment for most of the muscles of mastication. Many foramina and fissures are located in the sphenoid that carry nerves and blood vessels of the head and neck, such as the superior orbital fissure (with ophthalmic nerve), foramen rotundum (with maxillary nerve) and foramen ovale (with mandibular nerve).

==Other animals==

The sphenoid bone of humans is homologous with a number of bones that are often separate in other animals, and have a somewhat complex arrangement.

In the early lobe-finned fishes and tetrapods, the pterygoid bones were flat, wing-like bones forming the major part of the roof of the mouth. Above the pterygoids were the epipterygoid bones, which formed part of a flexible joint between the braincase and the palatal region, as well as extending a vertical bar of bone towards the roof of the skull. Between the pterygoids lay an elongated, narrow parasphenoid bone, which also spread over some of the lower surface of the braincase, and connected, at its forward end, with a sphenethmoid bone helping to protect the olfactory nerves. Finally, the basisphenoid bone formed part of the floor of the braincase and lay immediately above the parasphenoid.

Aside from the loss of the flexible joint at the rear of the palate, this primitive pattern is broadly retained in reptiles, albeit with some individual modifications. In birds, the epipterygoids are absent and the pterygoids considerably reduced. Living amphibians have a relatively simplified skull in this region; a broad parasphenoid forms the floor of the braincase, the pterygoids are relatively small, and all other related bones except the sphenethmoid are absent.

In mammals, these various bones are often (though not always) fused into a single structure; the sphenoid. The basisphenoid forms the posterior part of the base, while the pterygoid processes represent the pterygoid bones. The epipterygoids have extended into the wall of the cranium; they are referred to as alisphenoids when separate in mammals, and form the greater wings of the sphenoid when fused into a larger structure. The sphenethmoid bone forms as three bones: the lesser wings and the anterior part of the base. These two parts of the sphenethmoid may be distinguished as orbitosphenoids and presphenoid, respectively, although there is often some degree of fusion. Only the parasphenoid appears to be entirely absent in mammals.

In the dog the sphenoid is represented by eight bones: basisphenoid, alisphenoids, presphenoid, orbitosphenoids, pterygoids. These bones remain separate and are the:
*2 Alisphenoids: each greater wing
*2 Orbitosphenoids: each lesser wing
*Basisphenoid: back part of body
*Presphenoid: front part of body
*2 Pterygoids: medial pterygoid plate

<text>MapQuest (stylized as mapquest) is an American free online web mapping service. It was launched in 1996 as the first commercial web mapping service. MapQuest&#x27;s competitors include Apple Maps, Here, and Google Maps.

==History==

MapQuest&#x27;s origins date to 1967 with the founding of Cartographic Services, a division of R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons in Chicago, which moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1969. In the mid-1980s, R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons began generating maps and routes for customers, with cooperation by Barry Glick, a University at Buffalo Ph.D. In 1994, it was spun off as GeoSystems Global Corporation. Much of the code was adapted for use on the Internet to create the MapQuest web service in 1996. MapQuest&#x27;s original services were mapping (referred to as &quot;Interactive Atlas&quot;) and driving directions (called &quot;TripQuest&quot;).

Sensing the emerging demand for spatial applications on the Internet, and with crippling network latency in Lancaster, the executive team of Barry Glick and Perry Evans moved MapQuest to the up-and-coming LoDo area of Denver, Colorado.

The initial Denver team consisted of Evans, Simon Greenman, Chris Fanjoy and Harry Grout. To make MapQuest a serious contender in the online spatial application market, a robust set of geographical tools was developed under Greenman&#x27;s direction. Grout, who had spent time at Rand McNally, Etak and Navigation Technologies Corporation building digital map data, was tasked with acquiring data and licensing arrangements. The initial team experienced rapid growth in the Denver office, and in a short time MapQuest was becoming a well-known brand.

On 25 February 1999, MapQuest went public, trading on Nasdaq. In December 1999, America Online (AOL) announced it would acquire MapQuest for $1.1 billion. The deal closed in 2000. Chief Operating Officer / Chief Financial Officer Jim Thomas managed these transactions.

For a period (until 2004), MapQuest included satellite images through a licensing deal with GlobeXplorer, but later removed them because of the unorthodox business mechanics of the arrangement brokered by AOL. In September 2006, the website once again began serving satellite imagery in a new beta program.

In 2004, MapQuest, uLocate, Research in Motion and Nextel launched MapQuest Find Me, a buddy-finder service that worked on GPS-enabled mobile phones. MapQuest Find Me let users automatically find their location, access maps and directions and locate nearby points of interest, including airports, hotels, restaurants, banks and ATMs. Users also had the ability to set up alerts to be notified when network members arrive at or depart from a designated area. In 2005, the service became available on Sprint (as a result of their merger with Nextel), and on Boost Mobile in 2006.

In July 2006, MapQuest created a beta version of a new feature with which users could build customized routes by adding additional stops, reordering stops along the way and avoiding any undesired turns or roads. Users could also write out the starting address.

In October 2006, MapQuest sold its publishing division to concentrate on its online and mobile services.

In April 2007, MapQuest announced a partnership with General Motors&#x27; OnStar to allow OnStar subscribers to plan their driving routes on MapQuest.com and send their destination to OnStar&#x27;s turn-by-turn navigation service. The OnStar Web Destination Entry pilot program began in the summer of 2007 with a select group of OnStar subscribers.

Around 2008, the general public made a significant shift away from MapQuest to the much younger Google Maps service.

In July 2010, MapQuest announced plans to become the first major mapping site to embrace open-source mapping data, launching a new site separate from its main site, entirely using data from the OpenStreetMap project. On July 14, 2010, MapQuest launched a simplified user interface and made the site more compact. MapQuest also introduced &quot;My Maps&quot; personalization, which enables the user to personalize the interface.

In July 2012, Brian McMahon became the CEO and GM of MapQuest.

In May 2015, with the purchase of AOL by Verizon Communications, MapQuest came under the ownership of Verizon.

On 11 July 2016, MapQuest discontinued its open tile API, and users such as GNOME Maps were switched to a temporarily free tier of the Mapbox tileserver, while considering alternatives.

In 2019, Verizon Media sold Mapquest to System1.

In early 2025, following an executive order by President Donald Trump to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the &quot;Gulf of America,&quot; MapQuest gained attention for its satirical response. Through its official Bluesky account, MapQuest announced they wouldn&#x27;t be renaming the gulf on their map. They later announced &quot;Name Your Own Gulf,&quot; a website allowing you to generate an image of a map saying &quot;Gulf of&quot; something, which garnered attention on social media and got featured on several news outlets.

==Services and programs==
From 2014, MapQuest uses some of TomTom&#x27;s services for its mapping system.

MapQuest provides some extent of street-level detail or driving directions for a variety of countries. Users can check if their country is available using a dropdown menu on the MapQuest home page.

The company offers a free mobile app for Android and iOS that features POI search, voice-guided navigation, real-time traffic and other features. MapQuest also offers a mobile-friendly website.

MapQuest has several travel products and also includes a feature to let users compare nearby gas prices, similar to the service offered by GasBuddy. However, this feature is only available in the United States.

MapQuest&#x27;s POI data helps the service differentiate itself from other wayfinding software by guiding users directly to the entrances of businesses and destinations, rather than to general street addresses.

<text>Opodeldoc is a medical plaster or liniment invented, or at least named, by the German Renaissance physician Paracelsus in the 1500s. In modern form opodeldoc is a mixture of soap in alcohol, to which camphor and sometimes a number of herbal essences, most notably wormwood, are added. 

== Origins == 

In his &quot;Bertheonea Sive Chirurgia Minor&quot; published in 1603, Paracelsus mentioned &quot;oppodeltoch&quot; twice, but with uncertain ingredients. 

As to the origin of the name, Kurt Peters speculated that it was coined by Paracelsus from syllables from the words &quot;&quot;opo&quot;ponax, b&quot;del&quot;lium, and aristol&quot;och&quot;ia.&quot; &quot;Opoponax&quot; is a variety of myrrh; &quot;bdellium&quot; is &quot;Commiphora wightii&quot;, which produces a similar resin; and &quot;Aristolochia&quot; is a widely distributed genus which includes &quot;A. pfeiferi&quot;, &quot;A. rugosa&quot; and &quot;A. trilobata&quot; that are used in folk medicine to cure snakebites. The name suggests that these aromatic plants may have figured in Paracelsus&#x27;s recipe. 

In his &quot;Medicina Militaris&quot; of 1620, German military physician Raymund Minderer (&quot;Mindererus&quot;; 1570-1621) praised the Paracelsus compound as a plaster, good for wounds. Minderer compared it to his own variant, which set more like sealing wax. Opodeldoc and Paracelsus were acknowledged in English no later than 1646, in Sir Thomas Browne&#x27;s popular and influential &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot;. 

Paracelsus&#x27;s recipe is completely unrelated to later preparations of the same name. By the second printing of the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia in 1722 the name applied to a soap-based liniment. Such a liniment in patent form, sold by John Newbery&#x27;s company in Great Britain &quot;ever since A.D. 1786&quot;, was called &quot;Dr. Steer&#x27;s Opodeldoc&quot;. Produced for decades, the &quot;Dr. Steer&quot; preparation had been successfully imported into the U.S., and was common enough there to rank as one of the eight patent medicines to be analyzed (although not condemned) by the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in 1824. 

The name &quot;Old Opodeldoc&quot; was formerly used as a standard name for a stock character who was a physician, especially when played as a comic figure. Edgar Allan Poe used &quot;Oppodeldoc&quot; as a pseudonym for a character in the short story &quot;&quot; 

== Modern usage == 

The Pharmacopoeia of the United States (U.S.P.) gives a recipe for opodeldoc that contains:
* Powdered soap, 60 grams;
* Camphor, 45 grams;
* Oil of rosemary, 10 milliliters;
* Alcohol, 700 milliliters;
* Water, enough to make 1000 milliliters

As late as the early 1990s &#x27;Epideldoc&#x27; (sic) was compounded on request by several pharmacists in the Northwest of England.

<text>In mathematics, a function formula_1 defined on some set formula_2 with real or complex values is called bounded if the set of its values is bounded. In other words, there exists a real number formula_3 such that 
:formula_4
for all formula_5 in formula_2. A function that is &quot;not&quot; bounded is said to be unbounded.

If formula_1 is real-valued and formula_8 for all formula_5 in formula_2, then the function is said to be bounded (from) above by formula_11. If formula_12 for all formula_5 in formula_2, then the function is said to be bounded (from) below by formula_15. A real-valued function is bounded if and only if it is bounded from above and below.

An important special case is a bounded sequence, where &quot;formula_2&quot; is taken to be the set formula_17 of natural numbers. Thus a sequence formula_18 is bounded if there exists a real number formula_3 such that

:formula_20
for every natural number formula_21. The set of all bounded sequences forms the sequence space formula_22.

The definition of boundedness can be generalized to functions formula_23 taking values in a more general space formula_24 by requiring that the image formula_25 is a bounded set in formula_24.

== Related notions ==
Weaker than boundedness is local boundedness. A family of bounded functions may be uniformly bounded. 

A bounded operator &quot;formula_27&quot; is not a bounded function in the sense of this page&#x27;s definition (unless formula_28), but has the weaker property of preserving boundedness; bounded sets formula_29 are mapped to bounded sets &quot;formula_30.&quot; This definition can be extended to any function formula_23 if &quot;formula_2&quot; and &quot;formula_24&quot; allow for the concept of a bounded set. Boundedness can also be determined by looking at a graph.

==Examples==
* The sine function formula_34 is bounded since formula_35 for all formula_36.
* The function formula_37, defined for all real formula_5 except for −1 and 1, is unbounded. As &quot;formula_5&quot; approaches −1 or 1, the values of this function get larger in magnitude. This function can be made bounded if one restricts its domain to be, for example, formula_40 or formula_41.
* The function formula_42, defined for all real &quot;formula_5&quot;, &quot;is&quot; bounded, since formula_44 for all &quot;formula_5&quot;.
* The inverse trigonometric function arctangent defined as: formula_46 or formula_47 is increasing for all real numbers &quot;formula_5&quot; and bounded with formula_49 radians
* By the boundedness theorem, every continuous function on a closed interval, such as formula_50, is bounded. More generally, any continuous function from a compact space into a metric space is bounded.
*All complex-valued functions formula_51 which are entire are either unbounded or constant as a consequence of Liouville&#x27;s theorem. In particular, the complex formula_52 must be unbounded since it is entire.
* The function formula_1 which takes the value 0 for formula_5 rational number and 1 for &quot;formula_5&quot; irrational number (cf. Dirichlet function) &quot;is&quot; bounded. Thus, a function does not need to be &quot;nice&quot; in order to be bounded. The set of all bounded functions defined on formula_56 is much larger than the set of continuous functions on that interval. Moreover, continuous functions need not be bounded; for example, the functions formula_57 and formula_58 defined by formula_59 and formula_60 are both continuous, but neither is bounded. (However, a continuous function must be bounded if its domain is both closed and bounded.)

<text>Viby J (or just Viby) is a former town and now a district, in the southwestern part of Aarhus in Denmark. The district has almost 30,000 inhabitants. The &quot;J&quot; stands for Jutland, as there is another town called Viby on the island of Zealand, officially referred to as Viby Sj and also a village on Funen.

== Etymology and origin ==
Viby derives from the Old Norse words &quot;vé&quot; and &quot;býr&quot;, meaning holy place and town respectively.

&quot;Vi&quot; is a word represented in many place names in both Denmark and Sweden. Several places are named Viby in both Denmark and Sweden (see Viby (disambiguation) for examples) and &quot;vi&quot; is also present in names like Viborg or the Swedish towns of Odensvi, Torsvi, Frösvi, Ullavi or Visby. &quot;Vi&quot; refers to &quot;an enclosed holy place&quot;, and it is believed that Viby was once a holy place where the Norse gods were worshipped, with one or several cult houses. The shrines were probably located at what was formerly known as Tyrseng - the area around the large association football fields in the southwest of Viby. The name &quot;Tyrseng&quot; translates as &quot;Tyrs-meadow&quot;, referring to the Norse God Tyr. These theories are backed up by other more or less sound evidence. In 1915, remains of an old hall dating from the Viking Age, was unearthed at the hill of Kongsbakke (lit.: &quot;kings-hill&quot;), when the public school of Viby Skole was constructed. Medieval sources explains, that the hill of Kongsbakke was once the site of a royal estate in ancient times. Our general research-based knowledge of the Norse culture in the Iron Age and Viking Age tells us, that kings and magnates settled near vis and hofs, as they also worked as priests of the Norse religion and were needed there to attend the rituals. Archaeological excavations conducted by Moesgård Museum at a motorway junction in Viby, has also revealed a former holy spring, a chapel and a cemetery used from the 11th century to around 1200.

== Description ==

Apart from the former suburban town of Viby J, the postal district also includes the neighbourhoods of Kongsvang and Stavtrup

Viby J is primarily a working-class neighbourhood, including many immigrants, but the area also presents large boroughs of detached family houses for the upper-middle class. There are several educational institutions here, such as Viby Gymnasium and Aarhus Business College, making it a centre of education for its part of the city. Two major public housing projects are located in Viby J. Rosenhøj is made up by low-rise apartment blocks, while Grøfthøjparken comprise row house quarters, low-rise apartment blocks 4–6 stories tall and the landmark high-rise block of Grøfthøjhuset, with 17 floors and 51 meters tall. It is also the 6th tallest building in greater Aarhus.

The urban square of Viby Torv, is one of Aarhus&#x27; southernmost traffic nodes, joining the international E45 motorway with the Ring 2 ring road. There is a shopping centre at the square by the name of Viby Centret, including parking lots, a high-rise hotel and several office buildings and businesses.

Viby J houses the main editorial office of Jyllands-Posten.

=== Sports ===
Viby is known for its taekwondo-club, which has fostered several European Champions.

==History==
In the Viking Age and early Middle Ages there might have been a royal residence in Viby.

Viby Church was finished in the later part of the 1100s.

Viby J became a railway town in 1884.

The 1960s marked the beginning of large scale urban development projects in Viby. The expansions were intended to increase the population from 16,000 to 50,000. In early July 1961, Århus Stiftstidende could announce that:

*100 acres (40 ha) of land were to be designated for industry;
*1800 new flats were to be built;
*The centre would be freshened up to include a 10 storeys tall hotel, and a shopping centre;
*Two new schools and a church would be constructed;
*Road expansions would be made.

In 1970, a municipality reform made Viby a part of Aarhus and the Viby Centret shopping centre was finished. The centre project ended up costing about £4 million, instead of the originally estimated £1.85 million.

<text>The Mauritius lowland forest day gecko (&quot;Phelsuma guimbeaui)&quot;, also known commonly as Guimbeau&#x27;s day gecko and the orange-spotted day gecko, is a diurnal species of gecko, a lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The species is native to the western coast of Mauritius and typically inhabits large trees. The Mauritius lowland forest day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;guimbeaui&quot;, is in honor of the collector of the holotype, &quot;Mr. B[ernard] Guimbeau&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Phelsuma. guimbeaui&quot; belongs to the mid-sized genus &quot;Phelsuma&quot;. Males can reach a total length (including tail) of about . Females are only . The Mauritius lowland forest day gecko has a short, compact body form. The dorsal body colour is a brilliant green with a diffuse blue area on the neck region. There are irregular shaped orange-red bars and spots on the back and tail, the tip of which may be blue. The ventral side is whitish-yellow. One or two brown v-shaped bars are present on the chin. Juveniles are greyish-brown with little white spots, and start changing colour after six months. After 12–15 months, they have the adult appearance.

==Geographic range==
&quot;Phelsuma guimbeaui&quot; inhabits the western side of Mauritius. It occurs at low and mid elevation. Populations can be found at the villages of Chamarel, Yemen, Tamarin and Grande Rivière Noire. &quot;P. guimbeaui&quot; is also established on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.

==Habitat==
The Mauritius lowland forest day gecko prefers large trees such as palms and acacia species. &quot;P. guimbeaui&quot; is only rarely seen near human dwellings. It lives in the drier and warmer part of Mauritius. Much of the lowland forest of Mauritius, which is the original habitat of &quot;P. guimbeaui&quot;, has been cleared to make way for sugar cane plantations. &quot;P. guimbeaui&quot; sometimes shares its habitat with &quot;P. cepediana&quot; and &quot;P. ornata&quot;.

==Diet==
The Mauritius lowland forest day gecko feeds on various insects and other invertebrates. It also likes to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

==Behaviour==
The Mauritius lowland forest day gecko is rather shy as it is heavily predated by different bird species.

==Reproduction==
In &quot;P. guimbeaui&quot; the pairing season is between March and the first weeks of September. During this period, the females lay up to 6 pairs of eggs. The young will hatch after approximately 60–90 days. The juveniles measure . The Mauritius lowland forest day gecko is an egg gluer and often a colony nester. It often lays its eggs in tree holes. Juveniles reach pubescence after 18–20 months.

==Threats==
&quot;Phelsuma guimbeaui&quot; has been evaluated by the IUCN as &quot;endangered&quot;. Its habitat is small and fragmented. Moreover, 12 of 19 endemic reptile species from mainland Mauritius are extinct. It is traded commercially as a terrarium pet and this may be a threat; little is known about trade in &quot;Phelsuma&quot; species. &quot;Phelsuma&quot; are all CITES Appendix II listed.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
&quot;Phelsuma guimbeaui&quot; should be housed in pairs in a large, well planted terrarium for the highest success. The daytime temperature should be between . During the night, the temperature should drop to approximately . The humidity should be maintained between 60 and 70%. In captivity, &quot;P. guimbeaui&quot; can be fed with crickets, commercial fructivorous gecko diets, wax moths, fruits flies, mealworms, and houseflies.

<text>Ecash was conceived by David Chaum as an anonymous cryptographic electronic money or electronic cash system in 1982. It was realized through his corporation Digicash and used as micropayment system at one US bank from 1995 to 1998.

==Design==
Chaum published the idea of anonymous electronic money in a 1983 paper; eCash software on the user&#x27;s local computer stored money in a digital format, cryptographically signed by a bank. The user could spend the digital money at any shop accepting eCash, without having to open an account with the vendor first, or transmitting credit card numbers. Security was ensured by public key digital signature schemes. The RSA blind signatures achieved unlinkability between withdrawal and spend transactions. Depending on the payment transactions, one distinguishes between on-line and off-line electronic cash: If the payee has to contact a third party (e.g., the bank or the credit-card company acting as an acquirer) before accepting a payment, the system is called an on-line system. In 1990, Chaum together with Moni Naor proposed the first off-line e-cash system, which was also based on blind signatures.

==History==
Chaum started the company DigiCash in 1989 with &quot;ecash&quot; as its trademark. He raised $10 million from David Marquardt and by 1997 Nicholas Negroponte was its chairman. Yet, in the United States, only one bank the Mark Twain bank in Saint Louis, MO implemented ecash, testing it as micropayment system; Similar to credit cards, the system was free to purchasers, while merchants paid a transaction fee. After a three-year trial that signed up merely 5,000 customers, the system was dissolved in 1998, one year after the bank had been purchased by Mercantile Bank, a large issuer of credit cards. David Chaum opined then “As the Web grew, the average level of sophistication of users dropped. It was hard to explain the importance of privacy to them”.

In Europe, with fewer credit cards and more cash transactions, micropayment technologies made more sense. In June 1998, ecash became available through Credit Suisse in Switzerland, was available from Deutsche Bank in Germany, Bank Austria, Sweden&#x27;s Posten AB, and Den norske Bank of Norway, while in Japan Nomura Research Institute marketed eCash to financial institutions.
In Australia, ecash was implemented by St.George Bank and Advance Bank, but transactions were not free to purchasers. In Finland Merita Bank/EUnet made ecash available.

DigiCash went bankrupt in 1998, despite flourishing electronic commerce, but with credit cards as the &quot;currency of choice&quot;.

DigiCash was sold to eCash Technologies, including its eCash patents.

In 2000 eCash Technologies sued eCash.com, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. eCash.com counterclaimed that eCash Technologies&#x27; trademark registration was fraudulently obtained, because it failed to disclose eCash.com&#x27;s registration of the &quot;ecash.com&quot; domain name to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The court rejected eCash.com&#x27;s counterclaim saying a trademark applicant must disclose a third party&#x27;s rights only if they are &quot;clearly established.&quot; The court argued because the &quot;mere registration of a domain name does not confer trademark rights, let alone &quot;clearly established&quot; rights, ECash Technologies had no duty to disclose defendant&#x27;s registration of the “ecash.com” domain name to the PTO, however eCash Technologies subsequently went bankrupt and the domain &quot;Ecash.com&quot; remained in possession of the original owner.

In 2002 eCash Technologies was acquired by InfoSpace, currently known as Blucora. As of 2015, the term eCash is used for the digital cash that can be stored on an electronically sensitive card including online or alternative payment portals and mobile applications.

<text>A state senator is a member of a state&#x27;s senate in the bicameral legislature of 49 U.S. states, or a member of the unicameral Nebraska Legislature.

== Description ==
A state senator is a member of an upper house in the bicameral legislatures of 50 U.S. states or a member of the unicameral Nebraska Legislature.

== History ==
There are typically fewer state senators than there are members of a state&#x27;s lower house; a senator&#x27;s job is to represent the people at a higher level than a state representative in the lower house. In the past, this meant that senators represented various geographic regions within a state, regardless of the population, as a way of balancing the power of the lower house, which was apportioned according to population. This system changed in 1964, when the Supreme Court of the United States announced in &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; that state legislatures must apportion seats in both houses according to population. However, the single-member district system remained, and as a result, the State Senates became redundant bodies, as other solutions, such as abolition (as in Canada) or switching to statewide proportional representation (as in Australia) have not been adopted.

<doc id="311527" wikidata="Q3206072" url="?curid=311527" title="LJN">
<text>LJN Toys Ltd. was an American toy company and video game publisher founded by Jack Friedman in 1967. MCA Inc. acquired the company in 1985, and sold to Acclaim Entertainment in 1990. The toy division of the company was closed by Acclaim and a majority of its employees were fired as the company was shifted towards video game publishing. It was closed in 1994, but its label was used once more in 2000.

==History==
===Early history (1967–1985)===
Jack Friedman founded LJN in 1967 using funds from his employer Norman J. Lewis Associates (from which the company name &quot;LJN&quot; is derived, being a reversal of Lewis&#x27; initials) after seeing the sale figures of Mattel and Milton Bradley Company increase. Friedman later founded THQ and Jakks Pacific after leaving LJN. LJN shifted money used for television advertising to instead purchase licenses to make toys based on television shows. The first toyline by LJN based on a television show was for &quot;Emergency!&quot; The highest amount the company paid for a license by 1982 was $250,000.

LJN purchased the license to make toys based on &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; for $25,000 due to other companies declining the option, including Kenner Products and Ideal Toy Company, and sold over $16–25 million worth of merchandise without the need of an advertising campaign. A doll based on Brooke Shields was released with a $2 million advertising budget and made over $12 million in 1982. LJN&#x27;s revenue rose from $5 million in 1971 to $70 million in 1982 due to the E.T. and Brooke Shields toys.

In 1984 LJN became the toy licensee of the World Wrestling Federation. The Wrestling Superstars line, which featured action figures based on WWF&#x27;s roster of wrestlers, was produced from 1984 to 1989. LJN competed with Mattel in the toy market. The company produced the &quot;ThunderCats&quot; toyline in competition with Mattel&#x27;s &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;.

===MCA ownership (1985–1990)===
On March 26, 1985, MCA Inc. announced that it would purchase 63% of LJN&#x27;s stocks for $39.8 million and proposed to buy the remainder of the stock for $14.26 for each share which would increase the total value of the deal to almost $65 million. However, the company failed to make a net income from 1986 to 1989, and MCA had to take a $53 million after-tax charge due to the expenses of the company before selling it to Acclaim Entertainment for $30 million in April 1990. LJN had a revenue of $110,510,000 and a net loss of $37.3 million in 1987. MCA received 1.2 million shares in Acclaim as part of the LJN deal. 181,000 shares were returned as part of a price adjustment agreement and the remainder was sold for around $4.3 million in 1991.

LJN entered the video game industry by publishing games based on movies and television shows developed by companies including Atlus, Beam Software, and Rare for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987. The company released the LJN Video Art in 1987. At least 75% of the company&#x27;s $70 million in sales in 1990 came from video game sales on the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy.

The company released a paint gun line named Gotcha! with a license from the film &quot;Gotcha!&quot;, but this line were criticized by consumer protection groups due to the danger it posed to eyes. The toyline was financially unsuccessful, and MCA had to take a $35 million after-tax charge due to its failure and the expenses of the Coleco. The company was also criticized by police officers and Americans for Democratic Action for its Entertech line of toy water guns due to how realistic they looked; LJN changed the design of the toys after three people in the United States from ages 13 to 19 were killed as a result of police officers thinking they had actual guns, and multiple cities and states banned the sale of realistic toy guns.

Lawrence J. Kirk Jr. fired half of the company&#x27;s employees as part of a cost-cutting plan during his seven months as president from 1989 to 1990. LJN attempted to acquire Buddy L during his tenure, but MCA ended the negotiations before announcing that it was selling LJN.

===Acclaim Entertainment ownership (1990–2000)===
Acclaim closed LJN&#x27;s toy division and shifted the company&#x27;s focus to video game publishing. It fired 45 of the company&#x27;s 70 employees and moved its headquarters from Lyndhurst, New Jersey to Oyster Bay, New York, the same place as Acclaim&#x27;s headquarters.

Lawrence Kanaga filed a lawsuit on behalf of Clark Thiemann on January 31, 1990, against LJN, Nintendo, and Major League Baseball claiming that the game &quot;Major League Baseball&quot; was falsely advertised to Thiemann stating that it would allow him to simulate being a baseball team manager and Kanaga stating that the game was advertised as having all of the players, but instead only had their uniform numbers. In 1991, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled LJN&#x27;s Sling &#x27;Em-Fling &#x27;Em wrestling ring toys based on the World Wrestling Federation, which sold 1.4 million products from 1985 to 1989, due to multiple children between six and ten being injured by the toys.

Acclaim closed LJN in 1994, but reused the company&#x27;s name for the release of &quot;Spirit of Speed 1937&quot; in 2000.

<text>Jean Salmon Macrin (1490 – 1557) was a Neo-Latin poet of French nationality. His poetry sold massively well, and was thought of as quite influential during his lifetime; however his fame did not live on, and his poetry was never republished after the 16th century.

==Life and works==
Salmon Macrin was born in Loudun in 1490, and retained an intimate attachment to the countryside of his youth throughout his life. Patriotism and nostalgia for his &#x27;patria&#x27; feature as prominent themes in his poetry. His father supported him in his poetic vocation, and in his teens he was sent to Paris to study under Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Etaples. There he mastered Greek and Latin, and honed his poetic art alongside Quintianus Stoa. When his studies ended, he became secretary to Antoine Bohier, and later entered Court life as tutor to the sons of René de Savoie. After the death of the latter, Salmon Macrin remained in the service of his son Honorat. The poet found that Court life was not well-suited to his temperament, and he composed little during this period. It was his marriage to Guillone Boursault (&#x27;Gelonis&#x27;) that reignited his passion for poetry, and his two most famous works (the &#x27;Epithalamiorum liber&#x27; of 1528–1531 and the &#x27;Carminum libri quattuor&#x27; of 1530) contained many poems dedicated to her. Salmon Macrin&#x27;s poetry met with great success in his later years, and he enjoyed the favour of the king, Francis I.

Salmon Macrin boasted of having been the first to introduce Catullus and Horace into French poetry. His principal Neo-Latin models were the Italians Pontano, Marullus, Poliziano and Sannazaro. He was widely known as the French Horace, and his works had a great influence on vernacular poetry, especially the Pléiade.

Du Bellay, in his &#x27;Amores Faustinae&#x27;, mentions Macrin in his list of great contemporary love poets, alongside Pontano, Sannazaro, Marullus, Petrarch, Bèze, Tyard and Baïf.

<text>Mauritius upland forest day gecko (Phelsuma rosagularis) is a diurnal species of geckos.

It lives in the upland forest of Mauritius and typically inhabits large trees. The Mauritius upland forest day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

== Description ==
This lizard belongs to the mid-sized &quot;Phelsuma&quot; species. Males can reach a total length of about 15.5 cm. Females are only 9–13 cm. The Mauritius upland forest day gecko has a short, compact body form. The green body colour is paler than in the Mauritius lowland forest day gecko. The neck region may have a diffuse blue area. There are irregular shaped pale orange-red bars and spots on the back and tail. The rear portion of the tail often is turquoise or blue. The ventral side is light grey. The chin is pink or rust-coloured without the typical v-shaped baring as seen in &quot;Phelsuma guimbeaui&quot;. Juveniles are greyish-brown with little white spots. They start changing their colour after 6 months and after 12-15 they have the adult appearance.

== Distribution ==
This species inhabits the upland forest of Mauritius. It occurs only in parts of the mountain forests of Macchabée and Les Mares, the Brise Fer area, and in the mountain forest of Montagnes Bambous.

== Habitat ==
The Mauritius upland forest day gecko prefers large endemic forest trees. This day gecko is only rarely seen on secondary vegetation. &quot;P. rosagularis&quot; typically basks high on tree trunks.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

== Behaviour ==
The Mauritius upland forest day gecko is rather shy because it is heavily predated by different bird species.

== Reproduction ==
The pairing season is between march and the first weeks of September. During this period, the females lay up to 6 pairs of eggs. The young will hatch after approximately 60–90 days. The juveniles measure 36–40 mm. The Mauritius lowland forest day gecko is an egg gluer and often a colony nester. Tree holes are often used to lay the eggs in. Juveniles reach pubescence after 18–20 months.

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a large, well planted terrarium. The daytime temperature should be between 29 and 32 °C. During the night, the temperature should drop to approximately 20 °C. The humidity should be maintained between 60 and 70. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth, fruits flies, meal worms and houseflies.

<text>Ultra Software Corporation was a shell corporation and publishing label created in 1988 as a subsidiary of Konami of America, in an effort to get around Nintendo of America&#x27;s strict licensing rules in place at the time for the North American market. One of these rules was that a third-party company could only publish up to five games per year for the Nintendo Entertainment System in the US.

This was hardly convenient for Konami, which had begun releasing more than ten games a year for both the Famicom and its Disk System add-on in Japan. With a greater library than it was allowed to localize, Konami formed the Ultra Games brand to extend its annual library to ten games a year.

==History==
Ultra&#x27;s first NES game was &quot;Metal Gear&quot;. At first, Ultra was dedicated to localizing Konami&#x27;s pre-existing software from Japan, but later it began publishing works from other companies as well. Some of Konami&#x27;s most notable games released under the Ultra label include &quot;Operation C&quot;, &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and the first few &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; games for the NES and Game Boy. The IBM PC and Commodore 64 conversions of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear&quot; were also published under the Ultra branding.

After the North American launch of the Super NES in 1991, Nintendo started relaxing the restriction on the number of games third parties could publish each year. As a result, Ultra Games began losing its purpose and Konami dropped the label in 1992. The last games released by Ultra Games were &quot;Ultra Golf&quot; and &quot;World Circuit Series&quot;, both released in March 1992.

In Europe, Konami established the Palcom Software Limited subsidiary for similar purposes. Its library was relatively similar to Ultra&#x27;s but the company also published games that were not released in North America, notably &quot;Road Fighter&quot;, &quot;Parodius&quot; and &quot;Crackout&quot;. Palcom also released Super NES games that were published in America by Konami itself. In contrast, some games that were released under the Ultra name in North America, such as &quot;Metal Gear&quot; and &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, were published under the regular Konami brand in Europe. The European subsidiary lasted longer than Ultra Games, until it was closed down in early 1994.

<doc id="311538" wikidata="Q1138224" url="?curid=311538" title="Cowlitz people">
<text>The term Cowlitz people covers two culturally and linguistically distinct indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest; the Lower Cowlitz or Cowlitz proper, and the Upper Cowlitz / Cowlitz Klickitat or Taitnapam. Lower Cowlitz refers to a southwestern Coast Salish people, which today are enrolled in the federally recognized tribes: Cowlitz Indian Tribe, Quinault Indian Nation, and Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation. The Upper Cowlitz or Taitnapam, is a Northwest Sahaptin speaking people, part of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation.

Their traditional homelands are in western Washington state in the United States.

== Cowlitz tribal groups or bands ==
There is an ongoing dispute over the Cowlitz people, their history, territory, ancestry, ethnicity, and language; which is important for land claims and treaty negotiations with the U.S. government by Cowlitz descendants.

Some scholars believe that they were originally divided into four multi-linguistic tribal bands and generally spoke two different dialects of Salish; the common language of Western Washington and British Columbia native peoples, and one Sahaptin dialect. However, not every band understood the specific dialect of another, and they bridged the language barrier with an intertribal trade language called Chinook Jargon.
Today, the majority is of the opinion that the tribal term &quot;Cowlitz&quot; is a regional collective designation applied by the Europeans to ethnically and linguistic different groups or bands of Indian peoples of the entire Cowlitz River Basin.

These are the four (or two) Cowlitz tribal groups or bands:

* the Lower Cowlitz or Cowlitz proper (&quot;The People Who Seek Their Medicine Spirit&quot;, occupied 30 villages along the Lower Cowlitz River, other villages along the Toutle River; today the majority are enrolled within the Cowlitz Indian Tribe, some are part of Quinault Indian Nation, and Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation)
* the Upper Cowlitz, sometimes called Stick Indians, today identified as Sahaptin-speaking Taidnapam (″People of the Tieton River″, occupied and controlled fourteen villages along the Upper Cowlitz River (shch&#x27;il) above Morton and Mossyrock, other villages along the Cispus River (shíshpash), and the Tilton River (lalálx) and had frequent contact with their Upper and Lower Yakama and Klickitat kin who lived on the east side of the Cascade Range and spoke Sahaptin. They apparently intermarried with Salish-speaking Lower Cowlitz communities downriver and traveled freely as far as the mouth of the Cowlitz River but were not originally Salish-speaking people. Their own name &quot;Taitnapam&quot; indicates that they originally came from east of the Cascades - along the Tieton River (in Yakama: Táitin) hence territory of the &quot;Nahchísh-ħlama&quot;, a Yakama/Lower Yakama band along the Naches River and had strong linguistic and family ties to that band and the Klikatat / Klickitat; today as &quot;Yakima Cowlitz&quot; or &quot;Cowlitz Klickitat Band&quot; part of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation). 
* the Lewis River Cowlitz, sometimes called Lewis River Chinook, today considered to be regional group of Taidnapam (lived along Upper Lewis River and uppermost Nisqually River as neighbors to their Sahaptin kin the Mishalpam (Mical-ɫa’ma) (″Eatonville people″, lit. ″Mashel River people″) and Klickitat; today as &quot;Lewis River Klickitat Band&quot; part of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation) 
* the Mountain Cowlitz or Kwalhiokwa Cowlitz (lived between the Upper Chehalis River in the north and in the Willapa Hills to the south, intermarried with Salish-speaking Upper Chehalis and the now extinct Northern Athapaskan-speaking Willapa (Kwalhioqua); today part of the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation) They no longer existed as an independent tribe by 1855.

==Language==
Comparably with the dispute over who the &quot;original&quot; Cowlitz people were, there is debate over the &quot;original&quot; language of the Cowlitz tribes.
The commonly called Cowlitz language or &quot;Sƛ̕púlmš&quot; is placed closer to the Upper Chehalis language, closer than Lower Chehalis itself is placed to Upper Chehalis, and belongs to the Tsamosan (Olympic) branch of the Coast Salish family of the Salishan languages, and was spoken by the &quot;Lower Cowlitz / Cowlitz proper&quot;. There is a dispute over the original language of the &quot;Upper Cowlitz&quot; and &quot;Lewis River Cowlitz&quot; bands. The question concerns whether they had adopted the Sahaptin language from east of the Cascade Mountains, ceased to use their original, heritage language, and developed a separate &quot;Taitnapam / Upper Cowlitz / Lewis River dialect&quot; of Sahaptin, or whether they were Sahaptin-speaking people from east of the Cascade Range who came to occupy the Upper Cowlitz River Basin by conquest and intermarriage.

Modeste Demers reported that the Cowlitz peoples were fluent in Chinook Jargon.

==Government==
The Cowlitz Indian Tribe was federally recognized on February 14, 2000, and their acknowledgement was reaffirmed in 2002. They are now recognized officially by the United States federal government and have an establishing federally recognized tribal lands (on a reservation) in Ridgefield, Washington. The tribal offices are in Longview, Washington.

The Cowlitz political system evolved:

from a strong system of chiefs to an elective presidential system in the early 20th century; and a constitutional elective Tribal Council system after 1950. Chief How-How (c. 1815), Chief Kiscox (c. 1850), Chief Umtux (c. 1850), Chief Scanewa (c. 1855), Chief Richard Scanewa (c. 1860), and Chief Antoine Stockum [Atwin Stokum] (1878) led the Cowlitz in the 19th century. Twentieth-century figures include Chief Baptiste Kiona (1912), President Dan Plamondon (1921), President John Ike Kinswa (1922), Chairman John B. Sareault (c. 1925), Chairman Jas. E. Sareault (c. 1930), Chairman Manual L. Forrest (1950), Chairman Joseph Cloquet (1959), Chairman Clifford Wilson (1961), Chairman Roy Wilson (1974), Chairman John Barnett (1982), Chairman Bill Iyall (2008), Chairman Phil Harju (2020), Chairman David Barnett (2021), and Chairman Patty Kinswa-Gaiser (2022).
The current Cowlitz Tribe General Council Chair is William Iyall.

==Culture==
The Cowlitz tribe was unique among other tribes of Western Washington and Oregon in that they did not typically have access to saltwater or the coast and the Columbia River&#x27;s resources were of little use to the tribe. Salmon was important to their diet, but not as much as compared to other tribes; as they were accomplished hunters who relied on harvesting roots as diet supplements, and utilizing horses for multiple purposes.

The Cowlitz tribe completed a yearly cycle where they inhabited locations during certain seasons and harvested seasonal crops, in preparation for cold winter months. The season started in spring, when the Cowlitzes left their cedar houses along the river and streams by traveling via canoe and horseback to harvest camas bulbs, roots, barks, and grasses to make mats, fishnets, and basketry. Followed by the arrival of summer, where they would move into the higher country to pick and harvest seasonal berries. Lastly, followed by the return to fall, where the Cowlitzes would return to their cedar homes along the river to harvest Salmon, for the upcoming season. Generally, hunting and fishing were practiced all year round, but only roots and fruits had to be harvested seasonally.

The Cowlitz, like the Chinookian tribes, practiced the custom of flattening the head; signifying the mark of freedom and an intellect similar to that of round-head Indian tribes. Indian Mothers typically practice head flattening on newborn infants until they reach eight to twelve months old; when the head has lost its original shape. The process is completed by placing a child onto a wooden board, usually covered with moss or loose fibers of cedar bark, then placing a pad between a piece of smooth bark, strapped on through the holes with leather bands, creating great pressure on the forehead. The result creates a wedge in between the skull, with the front of the skull flat and the skull risen at the crown. These practices were not seen as harmful to the mothers and their children; in fact, some children would cry until they were placed back into the head flattening device.

The Cowlitz produced fully imbricated, coiled baskets with strong geometric designs. These were made of bear grass, cedar root, horsetail root, and cedar bark and were used to gather berries and fruits. The pigments were made from very bright fruits and vegetables like beets or blackberries. Such baskets were often repaired and kept through many generations.

Today, the Cowlitz continue to practice their culture.

==History==
The Cowlitz tribe was historically based along the Cowlitz and Lewis Rivers, as well as having a strong presence at Fort Vancouver.

The first white man known to have contacted the Cowlitz was French-Canadian Simon Plamondon of Quebec. Plamondon was hired as a fur trapper for Fort Astoria at the age of sixteen. In 1818 while making his first trip up the Cowlitz, Simon was captured by Chief Scanewea, of the Lower Cowlitz. He was then asked to stay with Scanewa&#x27;s tribe and to prove his loyalties through the exchange of goods for furs. Once he had gained the trust of the tribe, he was rewarded with the marriage of Chief Scanewea&#x27;s daughter, Thas-e-muth. When Chief Scanewea passed, Plamondon inherited most of his land and settled down with his wife on the Cowlitz Prairie where they bore four children: Sophie, Simon Jr., Theresa, and Marianne. It is rumored that Plamondon was married many different times and very young; fathering nearly 100 descendants. Plamondon was employed with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company until 1837 and in 1838 oversaw the building of Cowlitz Farm under the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company agricultural subsidiary.

The first European who attempted to convert the Cowlitz to Christianity was Herbert Beaver, an Anglican, who settled with his wife at Fort Vancouver in 1836. The couple set their sights on the Cowlitz tribe, only 50 miles southeast of Fort Vancouver, but growing tensions with John McLoughlin, the head at Fort Vancouver, prevented the couple from having any influence over the tribe; implementing their practices was with great difficulty. When the intermittent fever broke out, Beaver was responsible for vaccinating nearly 120 Lewis River Cowlitzes. After conflicts arose with McLoughlin, Beaver and his wife headed home to London in 1838, to continue on their work.

Later that same year in December 1838, Catholic missionaries began to visit the Cowlitz tribe, including François N. Blanchet, a Roman Catholic Priest, who arrived near Toledo, Washington, and established St. Francis Xavier Mission. A once optimistic priest, he became discouraged when the Cowlitz tribe did not fully immerse themselves into Catholicism, and instead held onto sediments of Native spirituality. As a response, a replacement, Father Modeste Demers, continued with Catholic teachings and baptizing, but he continued to remain just as pessimistic as his past predecessor did. After the priest left, the Cowlitz reportedly told the French-Canadian farmers, &quot;We want to do something for them, we will work, make fences, and whatever they wish us to do.&quot;

With the arrival of American settlers and conflicts arising over land claims, the 1846 Oregon Treaty gave the US government power back over once owned British lands of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. With British influence and French-Canadian fur trappers out of the picture, newly appointed Washington governor Isaac Stevens drafted four main treaty negotiations: Point Elliot, Point No Point, Neah Bay, and Medicine Creek. The Chehalis River Treaty, which included the Cowlitz tribe, was the last negotiation for Stevens; his refusal to listen to the tribe leader&#x27;s negotiations and concerns led to the document never being signed. The fever struck the tribe during this time, and Stevens&#x27;s assistant George Gibbs had determined that &quot;the Cowlitz, a once numerous and powerful tribe, are now insignificant and fast disappearing.&quot; As a consequence, this led to the Indian Wars of 1855–1856, in which the U.S. Army was called to settle disputes with Indian tribes. The Cowlitz tribe remained neutral because of the government&#x27;s promise of reservation lands if they remained peaceful, but after returning home, they found their land destroyed and property stolen.

In 1924 the Cowlitz sent Frank Iyall as a delegate to congress for the American Indian Citizenship Act. He also served as delegate for the recognition of the Cowlitz Indian Tribe which received approval from congress but a veto from President Calvin Coolidge.

In the 1960s Dale M. Kinkade conducted interviews and audio recordings with Emma Mesplie and Lucy Foster for the Cowlitz Language which went on to be much of the basis for the Lower Cowlitz dictionary the Cowlitz Indian Tribe uses today.

The Cowlitz tribe did not receive federal recognition until 2000.

<doc id="311544" wikidata="Q224787" url="?curid=311544" title="Kenneth Appel">
<text>Kenneth Ira Appel (October 8, 1932 – April 19, 2013) was an American mathematician who in 1976, with colleague Wolfgang Haken at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, solved the four-color theorem, one of the most famous problems in mathematics. They proved that any two-dimensional map, with certain limitations, can be filled in with four colors without any adjacent &quot;countries&quot; sharing the same color.

==Biography==
Appel was born in Brooklyn, New York, on October 8, 1932. He grew up in Queens, New York, and was the son of a Jewish couple, Irwin Appel and Lillian Sender Appel. He worked as an actuary for a brief time and then served in the U.S. Army for two years at Fort Benning, Georgia, and in Baumholder, Germany. In 1959, he finished his doctoral program at the University of Michigan, and he also married Carole S. Stein in Philadelphia. The couple moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where Appel worked for the Institute for Defense Analyses from 1959 to 1961. His main work at the Institute for Defense Analyses was doing research in cryptography. Toward the end of his life, in 2012, he was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society. He died in Dover, New Hampshire, on April 19, 2013, after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer in October 2012.

Kenneth Appel was also the treasurer of the Strafford County Democratic Committee. He played tennis through his early 50s. He was a lifelong stamp collector, a player of the game of Go and a baker of bread. He and Carole had two sons, Andrew W. Appel, a noted computer scientist, and Peter H. Appel, and a daughter, Laurel F. Appel, who died on March 4, 2013. He was also a member of the Dover school board from 2010 until his death.

==Schooling and teaching==
Kenneth Appel received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Queens College in 1953. After serving the army he attended the University of Michigan where he earned his M.A. in 1956, and then later his Ph.D. in 1959. Roger Lyndon, his doctoral advisor, was a mathematician whose main mathematical focus was in group theory.

After working for the Institute for Defense Analyses, in 1961 Appel joined the Mathematics Department faculty at the University of Illinois as an Assistant Professor. While there Appel researched in group theory and computability theory. In 1967 he became an associate professor and in 1977 was promoted to professor. It was while he was at this university that he and Wolfgang Haken proved the four color theorem. From their work and proof of this theorem they were later awarded the Delbert Ray Fulkerson prize, in 1979, by the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Programming Society.

While at the University of Illinois Appel took on five students during their doctoral program. Each student helped contribute to the work cited on the Mathematics Genealogy Project.

In 1993 Appel moved to New Hampshire as Chairman of the Mathematics Department at the University of New Hampshire. In 2003 he retired as professor emeritus. During his retirement he volunteered in mathematics enrichment programs in Dover and in southern Maine public schools. He believed &quot;that students should be afforded the opportunity to study mathematics at the level of their ability, even if it is well above their grade level.&quot;

==Contributions to mathematics==

===The four color theorem===
Kenneth Appel is known for his work in topology, the branch of mathematics that explores certain properties of geometric figures. His biggest accomplishment was proving the four color theorem in 1976 with Wolfgang Haken. The &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote in 1976:

Now the four-color conjecture has been proved by two University of Illinois mathematicians, Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken. They had an invaluable tool that earlier mathematicians lacked—modern computers. Their present proof rests in part on 1,200 hours of computer calculation during which about ten billion logical decisions had to be made. The proof of the four-color conjecture is unlikely to be of applied significance. Nevertheless, what has been accomplished is a major intellectual feat. It gives us an important new insight into the nature of two-dimensional space and of the ways in which such space can be broken into discrete portions.

At first, many mathematicians were unhappy with the fact that Appel and Haken were using computers, since this was new at the time, and even Appel said, &quot;Most mathematicians, even as late as the 1970s, had no real interest in learning about computers. It was almost as if those of us who enjoyed playing with computers were doing something non-mathematical or suspect.&quot; The actual proof was described in an article as long as a typical book titled &quot;Every Planar Map is Four Colorable&quot;, Contemporary Mathematics, vol. 98, American Mathematical Society, 1989.

The proof has been one of the most controversial of modern mathematics because of its heavy dependence on computer number-crunching to sort through possibilities, which drew criticism from many in the mathematical community for its inelegance: &quot;a good mathematical proof is like a poem—this is a telephone directory!&quot; Appel and Haken agreed in a 1977 interview that it was not &quot;elegant, concise, and completely comprehensible by a human mathematical mind&quot;.

Nevertheless, the proof was the start of a change in mathematicians&#x27; attitudes toward computers—which they had largely disdained as a tool for engineers rather than for theoreticians—leading to the creation of what is sometimes called experimental mathematics.

===Group theory===
Kenneth Appel&#x27;s other publications include an article with P.E. Schupp titled &quot;Artin Groups and Infinite Coxeter Groups&quot;. In this article Appel and Schupp introduced four theorems that are true about Coxeter groups and then proved them to be true for Artin groups. The proofs of these four theorems used the &quot;results and methods of small cancellation theory.&quot;

<doc id="311545" wikidata="Q1138229" url="?curid=311545" title="Cowlitz River">
<text>The Cowlitz River is a river in the state of Washington in the United States, a tributary of the Columbia River. Its tributaries drain a large region including the slopes of Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, and Mount St. Helens.

The Cowlitz has a drainage basin, located between the Cascade Range in eastern Lewis County, Washington and the cities of Kelso and Longview. The river is roughly long, not counting tributaries.

Major tributaries of the Cowlitz River include the Cispus River and the Toutle River, which was overtaken by volcanic mudflows (lahars) during the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.

When the smelt spawn in the Cowlitz River, the gulls go into a feeding frenzy that lasts for weeks. Kelso, Washington is known as the &quot;Smelt Capital of the World&quot;.

==Dams==
The Cowlitz River has three major hydroelectric dams, with several small-scale hydropower and sediment retention structures within the Cowlitz Basin.

The Cowlitz Falls Project is a 70 megawatt hydroelectric dam built in the early 1990s and completed in 1994. The dam is high and wide. The Cowlitz Falls Project produces on average 260 GWh annually for Lewis County PUD. Its reservoir, Lake Scanewa, is located at the confluence of the Cowlitz and Cispus Rivers downstream of Randle.

Mossyrock Dam began generating power for Tacoma City Light in 1968. It rises from bedrock and created the long Riffe Lake (previously Davisson Reservoir). It is the highest dam in the Pacific Northwest. The dam is named for the nearby city of Mossyrock, and the lake for the town of Riffe, which, along with Kosmos, was destroyed by the flooding of the Cowlitz River valley above the dam.

The Mayfield Dam is long and high. An tunnel connects the reservoir to the powerhouse. The dam began producing electricity in 1963. Mayfield Lake offers many recreational opportunities: there are several county and state parks and the lake is below the Mossyrock Dam. The modulated inflow from the Mossyrock Dam allows Mayfield Lake to maintain a water level that rarely fluctuates more than a few feet. It is located several miles downstream of Mossyrock.

Packwood Lake was dammed in 1964 by the Washington Public Power Supply System (now called Energy Northwest). The dam holds back the lake (previously held back by an ancient landslide), redirecting streamflow to a 27 megawatt hydroelectric generator in the Cowlitz River valley floor 2,000 feet (600 m) below just outside the town of Packwood. When designing and building the dam, care was taken so as not to affect the abundant wildlife of the lake and surrounding area: the dam raised the water level by only a few feet.
A serious side effect of the Mount St. Helens 1980 eruption has been the downstream movement of enormous amounts of sediment through the North Fork Toutle River. After the eruption, river-borne sediment increased over five thousand-fold, making the Toutle River one of the most sediment-laden rivers in the world. The Toutle River Sediment Retention Structure was constructed to trap this sediment before it was carried farther downstream, where it could clog the river channel, exacerbate floods along the lower Toutle and Cowlitz Rivers, and fill the Columbia River shipping channel, which still requires periodic dredging. An overflow channel has been added to divert lahars around the dam.

==Bridges==

Numerous road and rail bridges span the Cowlitz.

Just upstream from its mouth at the Columbia river, a railroad bridge connecting the Port of Longview to the BNSF rail line crosses the Cowlitz, with a road bridge for SR 432 (Tennant Way) beside.

Further upstream are the Allen St. and Cowlitz Way bridges, connecting West Kelso with the rest of Kelso. Just north of Kelso, a railroad bridge provides crossing for the Columbia &amp; Cowlitz Railroad.

Connecting SR 411 to Interstate-5 is the Lexington bridge, a two-lane bridge between the large unincorporated community of Lexington to Exit 42 on the east side of the bank.

At Castle Rock, the A St. bridge provides access from downtown to the school and residential areas across the river. A few miles north, after the Toutle River split, the BNSF line crosses the river.

Across the Lewis/Cowlitz County line, between the towns of Vader and Toledo, Washington, I-5 crosses the river. At Toledo, SR-505 crosses the river as well.

Where Highway 12 crosses Mayfield Lake, just west of Mossyrock, causeways were built out to the middle of the lake, where a short bridge section connects the two sides. A small bridge provides a crossing for SR 122 at the head of Mayfield Lake. Just east of Mossyrock, the Cowlitz River Bridge on Highway 12 was the largest concrete arch bridge in North America until 1971 at .
At the head of Riffe Lake, the 27 Road provides access to the forestland south of the Cowlitz from Morton and Glenoma to the north.

At Randle, SR 131 crosses the Cowlitz to provide access to the Cispus basin and the northern areas of the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.

Between Randle and Packwood, Highway 12 crosses the Cowlitz at the Cora bridge.

At Packwood, Skate Creek Road spans the river, providing access to the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and Tatoosh Wilderness, as well as connecting the downtown and residential areas of Packwood.

Upstream from Packwood, the Cowlitz splits into the Muddy and Clear Forks, with several Forest Service and Park Service roads crossing each.

==Other river structures==
When the Cowlitz Salmon Hatchery began operation in 1968, it was the largest of its kind in the world. Currently, it produces nearly 13 million fish each year. Adjacent is the barrier dam, which diverts spawning and upriver migrating fish to a separating station where fish are sorted by species. Some of the fish are used by the hatchery while others are transported upstream to continue migration.

The Bonneville Power Administration, in cooperation with the Lewis County PUD, state and federal agencies and Tacoma Power, constructed a downstream anadromous fish collection facility as part of the Cowlitz Falls Project. The fish facility, along with the Cowlitz River Salmon Hatchery&#x27;s diversion dam below Mayfield Lake, has permitted the reintroduction of salmon and steelhead in the upper Cowlitz River basin for the first time since the construction of the Mossyrock and Mayfield dams in the 1960s.

<text>Wolfgang Haken (; June 21, 1928 – October 2, 2022) was a German American mathematician who specialized in topology, in particular 3-manifolds.

==Biography==
Haken was born on June 21, 1928, in Berlin, Germany. His father was Werner Haken, a physicist who had Max Planck as a doctoral thesis advisor. In 1953, Haken earned a Ph.D. degree in mathematics from Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel (Kiel University) and married Anna-Irmgard von Bredow, who earned a Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the same university in 1959. In 1962, they left Germany so he could accept a position as visiting professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He became a full professor in 1965, retiring in 1998.
In 1976, together with colleague Kenneth Appel at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Haken solved the four-color problem: they proved that any planar graph can be properly colored using at most four colors. Haken has introduced several ideas, including Haken manifolds, Kneser-Haken finiteness, and an expansion of the work of Kneser into a theory of normal surfaces. Much of his work has an algorithmic aspect, and he is a figure in algorithmic topology. One of his key contributions to this field is an algorithm to detect whether a knot is unknotted.

In 1978, Haken delivered an invited address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki. He was a recipient of the 1979 Fulkerson Prize of the American Mathematical Society for his proof with Appel of the four-color theorem.
Haken died in Champaign, Illinois, on October 2, 2022, aged 94.

==Family==

Haken&#x27;s eldest son, Armin, proved that there exist propositional tautologies that require resolution proofs of exponential size. Haken&#x27;s eldest daughter, Dorothea Blostein, is a professor of computer science, known for her discovery of the master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences. Haken’s second son, Lippold, is the inventor of the Continuum Fingerboard. Haken’s youngest son, Rudolf, is a professor of music, who established the world&#x27;s first Electric Strings university degree program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Wolfgang is the cousin of Hermann Haken, a physicist known for laser theory and synergetics.

<text>The White River is a river that flows through the U.S. states of Arkansas and Missouri. Originating in the Boston Mountains of northwest Arkansas, it arcs northwards through southern Missouri before turning back into Arkansas, flowing southeast to its mouth at the Mississippi River.

==Hydrography==
=== Course ===
The source of the White River is in the Boston Mountains of northwest Arkansas, in the Ozark–St. Francis National Forest southeast of Fayetteville. The river flows northwards from its source to loop through southwest Missouri before heading southeast through Arkansas to its mouth on the Mississippi River.

On entering the Mississippi River Valley region near Batesville, Arkansas, the river becomes navigable to shallow-draft vessels, and its speed decreases considerably. The final serves as the last segment of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System; this part of the channel is deeper than the rest of the river.

=== Discharge ===
Despite being much shorter than the Arkansas River, it carries nearly as much water—normally more than , and occasionally more than during periods of flooding.
===Flood management and reservoir creation===
In the 20th century, large sections of the White River were modified via dam construction to form a series of artificial reservoirs for the purpose of flood control, as well as hydroelectric power generation, water distribution and management, and recreation. The first of these encountered from the headwaters is Beaver Lake in northwest Arkansas, followed by Table Rock Lake and Lake Taneycomo in southern Missouri, and finally Bull Shoals Lake as the river loops southward into northern Arkansas. Downstream of Bull Shoals Dam, the White River returns to its natural riparian state as it heads southeast through the eastern Ozark-St. Francis National Forest.

==== Ozark Power and Water Company ====
In 1910, Congress authorized construction of a hydroelectric dam on the White River by the newly formed Ozark Power and Water Company. Completed in 1913 at a cost of $2.3 million, Powersite Dam near Forsyth, Missouri confined a section of the White River to create Lake Taneycomo. The project brought electricity to a rural area of the Ozark Mountains south of Springfield, Missouri with rural electrification programs in the 1940s expanding service to the surrounding region. Recreation on Taneycomo drew tourism to Rockaway Beach and Branson. The Ozark Power and Electric Company operated independently until 1927 when it merged with Empire District Electric Company in 1927, who own and operate Powersite to this day.

==== Army Corps of Engineers ====
Beaver Lake, Bull Shoals Lake, and Table Rock Lake are man-made lakes or reservoirs created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under the authority of the Flood Control Act of 1938.

Bull Shoals Dam near Mountain Home, Arkansas was constructed from 1947 to 1951 at a cost of $86 million and is the 5th largest concrete dam in the United States. It confines Bull Shoals Lake, the largest of the lakes on the White River and the most downstream.

The next to be constructed was Table Rock Dam near Branson, Missouri, completed in 1958 at a cost of $65 million. It confines Table Rock Lake, the second largest on the White and a popular tourist destination as part of the Branson area.

Beaver Dam near Eureka Springs, Arkansas was built between 1960 and 1966 for $46 million. It confines Beaver Lake, the most upstream dam and reservoir on the river.

A total of eight dams impound the upper White River, six in Arkansas and two in Missouri. The White River National Wildlife Refuge lies along the lower part of the river.

===Major tributaries===
The tributaries of the White River include Cache River, Bayou des Arc, Little Red River, Black River, North Fork River, Crooked Creek, Buffalo River, Kings River, James River, and Roaring River.

=== Settlements ===

==== Arkansas ====

* Augusta
* Batesville
* Calico Rock
* Newport

==== Missouri ====

* Branson
* Hollister
* Rockaway Beach

==Angling==
Fishing for trout is popular in the upper portions of the river from the Beaver Lake tailwaters in northwestern Arkansas, through its course through southwest Missouri (including all of Lake Taneycomo), and back down through Arkansas to the Highway 58 bridge in Guion. The river has long been ranked one of the top trout fisheries in the country. Fishing is popular in these waters for a number of trout species including rainbow, brown, and cutthroat trout. A number of trout fishing resorts lie on the tailwaters of Bull Shoals Lake and the North Fork River. Fishing for white bass is also popular in these waters.

<doc id="311554" wikidata="Q17108527" url="?curid=311554" title="Newtons (cookie)">
<text>Newtons are a Nabisco-trademarked version of a cookie filled with sweet fruit paste. &quot;Fig Newtons&quot; are the most popular variety (fig rolls filled with fig paste). They are produced by an extrusion process. Their distinctive shape is a characteristic that has been adopted by competitors, including generic fig bars sold in many markets.

== History ==
The Newton was invented by Philadelphia baker Charles Roser, who likely took inspiration for the recipe from the fig roll, a baked good introduced to the U.S. by British immigrants. Roser used a machine invented by James Henry Mitchell which allowed for the extrusion of fig jam and cookie dough at the same time into a long, continuous roll. The recipe was sold to the Kennedy Biscuit company, and entered mass production at the F. A. Kennedy Steam Bakery in 1891. The cookie was christened the &quot;Newton&quot; by the plant manager, James Hazen, using the name of the Boston suburb of Newton, Massachusetts.

The Kennedy Biscuit Company was one of eight bakeries bought out by William Moore in 1889 to create the New York Biscuit Company. This company merged with the American Biscuit Company in 1898 to form the &quot;National Biscuit Company&quot;, or Nabisco. The recipe for Newtons along with the manufacturing machine were among the assets brought into the new company, and the cookies were trademarked as &quot;Fig Newtons&quot;.

In 1991, Nabisco held a 100th-anniversary celebration of the cookie in the town of Newton, Massachusetts.

Since 2012, the &quot;Fig&quot; has been dropped from the product name (now just &quot;Newtons&quot;). According to Nabisco, one reason this was done is that the cookie had long been available in other flavors, like strawberry, raspberry, and blueberry. Another reason was a general negative perception of figs, and their association with &quot;old&quot; things.

==Production==
In 1991, Nabisco was producing around a billion Newtons per year, with the cookie generating $200 million in sales.

The cookie is Nabisco&#x27;s third best-selling product, with sales of more than 700 million bars a year as of 2018.

===Varieties===
Original Fig Newtons were the only variety available until the 1980s. As of 2012, Nabisco makes several varieties of the Newton, which, in addition to the original fig filling, include versions filled with apple cinnamon, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, blueberry and mixed berry. The Fig Newton also is sold in a 100% whole-grain variety and a fat-free variety. Fig Newton Minis have also been introduced. 

In 2011, a crisp cookie was introduced in the United States named Newtons Fruit Thins, after being successfully marketed by Kraft in Canada as Lifestyle Selections, a variety of Peek Freans. The product line has since been discontinued.

<doc id="311557" wikidata="Q42675898" url="?curid=311557" title="Paubrasilia">
<text>Paubrasilia echinata is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae, that is endemic to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a Brazilian timber tree commonly known as Pernambuco wood or brazilwood (, ; Tupi: ) and is the national tree of Brazil. This plant has a dense, orange-red heartwood that takes a high shine, and it is the premier wood used for making bows for stringed instruments. The wood also yields a historically important red dye called brazilin, which oxidizes to brazilein.

The name &quot;pau-brasil&quot; was applied to certain species of the genus &quot;Caesalpinia&quot; in the medieval period, and was given its original scientific name &quot;Caesalpinia echinata&quot; in 1785 by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. More recent taxonomic studies have suggested that it merits recognition as a separate genus, and it was thus renamed &quot;Paubrasilia echinata&quot; in 2016. The Latin specific epithet of &quot;echinata&quot; refers to hedgehog, from &quot;echinus&quot;, and describes the thorns which cover all parts of the tree (including the fruits).

The name of Brazil is a shortened form of , &#x27;land of brazilwood&#x27;.

== Name ==
When Portuguese explorers found &quot;Paubrasilia&quot; on the coast of South America, they recognised it as a relative of an Asian species of sappanwood already used in Europe for producing red dye. The Portuguese named these trees &quot;pau-brasil&quot;, the term &quot;pau&quot; meaning wood, and &quot;brasil&quot; meaning reddish/ember-like. The South American trees soon dominated trading as a better source of dye. Such a vigorous trade resulted from the woods that early sailors and merchants started referring to the land itself as &quot;Terra do Brasil&quot;, or simply, the &quot;Land of Brazil&quot;; from this use, the present name of Brazil was derived.

Botanically, several tree species are involved, all in the family Fabaceae (the pulse family). The term &quot;brazilwood&quot; is most often used to refer to the species &quot;Paubrasilia echinata&quot;, but it is also applied to other species, such as &quot;Biancaea sappan&quot; and &quot;Haematoxylum brasiletto&quot;. The tree is also known by other names: such as &quot;ibirapitanga&quot;, from Tupi 
&quot;ïbi&#x27;rá pi&#x27;tãga&quot; meaning &quot;reddish wood&quot;; or &quot;pau de pernambuco&quot;, named after the Brazilian state of Pernambuco.

In the bow-making business, it is usual to refer to some species other than &quot;Paubrasilia echinata&quot; as &quot;brazilwood&quot;; examples include pink ipê (&quot;Handroanthus impetiginosus&quot;), Massaranduba (&quot;Manilkara bidentata&quot;) and palo brasil (&quot;Haematoxylum brasiletto&quot;). The highly prized &quot;Paubrasilia echinata&quot; is usually called &quot;Pernambuco wood&quot; in this particular context.

==Description==

The brazilwood tree may reach up to in height, and the dark brown bark flakes in large patches, revealing the lustrous blood-red sapwood underneath. The leaves are pinnate and each consists of between 9 and 19 small, leathery leaflets, which are broadly oblong in shape. The flower stalk, or inflorescence, is also branched and contains between 15 and 40 yellow, strongly perfumed flowers, which may be pollinated by bees. The petals are usually yellow with a blood-red blotch. The fruits are oval-shaped woody seedpods, measuring up to long and across; they hang off the branches and after the seeds are expelled, the pods become twisted. The branches, leaves and fruit are covered with small thorns.

There are some important differences between geographically distinct populations and it is thought that separate subspecies of the pau brasil may exist. This tree may have some medicinal properties and has been used as an astringent and antidiuretic by local people; extracts have been tested as possible cancer treatments.

==Historical importance==
Starting in the 16th century, brazilwood became highly valued in Europe and quite difficult to get. A related wood, sappanwood, coming from Asia was traded in powder form and used as a red dye in the manufacture of luxury textiles, such as velvet, in high demand during the Renaissance. When Portuguese navigators landed in present-day Brazil, on April 22, 1500, they immediately saw that brazilwood was extremely abundant along the coast and in its hinterland, along the rivers. In a few years, a hectic and very profitable operation for felling and shipping all the brazilwood logs they could get was established, as a crown-granted Portuguese monopoly. The rich commerce which soon followed stimulated other nations to try to harvest and smuggle brazilwood contraband out of Brazil, and corsairs to attack loaded Portuguese ships in order to steal their cargo. For example, the unsuccessful attempt in 1555 of a French expedition led by Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon, vice-admiral of Brittany and corsair under the King, to establish a colony in present-day Rio de Janeiro (France Antarctique) was motivated in part by the bounty generated by economic exploitation of brazilwood. In addition, this plant is also cited in &quot;Flora Brasiliensis&quot; by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius.

== Use in the music industry and excessive harvesting ==
Excessive harvesting led to a steep decrease in the number of brazilwood trees in the 18th century, causing the collapse of this economic activity. Presently, the species is nearly extirpated in most of its original range. Brazilwood is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN, and it is cited in the official list of endangered flora of Brazil.
The trade of brazilwood is likely to be banned in the immediate future, creating a major problem in the bow-making industry which highly values this wood. The International Pernambuco Conservation Initiative (IPCI), whose members are the bowmakers who rely on pernambuco for their livelihoods, is working to replant the trees. IPCI advocates the use of other woods for violin bows to raise money to plant pernambuco seedlings. The shortage of pernambuco has also helped the carbon fiber and composite bow industry to thrive.

== Replanting efforts ==
Restoration of the species in the wild is hampered by the fact that it is a climax community species, which will develop well only when planted amongst secondary forest vegetation. Although many saplings have been distributed or sold during recent decades, that has led to the tree being planted in places outside its natural range, with somewhat poor results, such as what happens with brazilwood trees used for urban landscaping in the city of São Paulo, whose development and flowering is usually hampered by the colder environment.

<text>The Pink and White Terraces ( and ), were natural wonders of New Zealand. They were reportedly the largest silica sinter deposits on Earth. They disappeared in the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera and were generally thought to have been destroyed, until evidence emerged in the early twenty-first century of their survival.

The Pink and White Terraces were formed by upwelling geothermal springs containing a cocktail of silica-saturated, near-neutral pH chloride water. These two world-famous springs were part of a group of hot springs and geysers, chiefly along an easterly ridge named Pinnacle Ridge (or the Steaming Ranges by Mundy). The main tourist attractions included Ngahapu, Ruakiwi, Te Tekapo, Waikanapanapa, Whatapoho, Ngawana, Koingo and Whakaehu.

The Pink and the White Terrace springs were around apart. The White Terraces were at the north-east end of Lake Rotomahana and faced west to north west at the entrance to the Kaiwaka Channel. Te Tarata descended to the lake edge around below. The Pink Terraces lay four fifths of the way down the lake on the western shore, facing east to south-east. The pink appearance over the mid and upper basins (similar to the colour of a rainbow trout) was due to antimony and arsenic sulfides, although the Pink Terraces also contained gold in ore-grade concentrations.

==Formation==
The process of formation of the Pink and White Terraces was described by geology professor Marshall of Otago University: &quot;The water is alkaline, and contains much silica in solution. As the water cools, its solvent power is diminished, and some of the silica is deposited. As the cooling is most rapid on the margin of the pool, deposition is also most rapid there, and a basin of white silica is gradually built up [so that] basins are formed wherever the water collected into small pools when it first flowed down the slope.&quot;

The White Terraces were the larger formation, covering about and descending over about 50 layers with a drop in elevation of about , and over about . The most northerly White Terrace was fed by the Te Tarata spring at its top. The Pink Terraces descended about over about . The Pink Terraces started at the top wide and the bottom layers were about wide. Tourists preferred to bathe in the upper Pink Terrace pools as due to their clarity and the range of temperature and depths.

Geologist Ferdinand von Hochstetter wrote after his visit in 1859 that &quot;doubtless thousands of years were required&quot; for their formation. A more recent calculation by independent researcher Rex Bunn has provided a White Terrace date of ~5,000 BCE.

==History==
One of the first Europeans to visit Rotomahana was Ernst Dieffenbach. He briefly visited the lake and terraces while on a survey for the New Zealand Company in early June 1841. The description of his visit in his book &quot;Travels in New Zealand&quot; inspired an interest in the Pink and White Terraces by the outside world.

The terraces became New Zealand&#x27;s most famous tourist attraction, sometimes referred to as the Eighth Wonder of the World. New Zealand was still relatively inaccessible to Europeans and passage took several months by ship. The journey from Auckland was typically by steamer to Tauranga, the bridle track to Ohinemutu on Lake Rotorua, by coach to Te Wairoa (the home of the missionary the Reverend Seymour Mills Spencer), by canoe across Lake Tarawera, and then on foot or by canoe up and/or down the Kaiwaka Channel; over the hill to the swampy shores of Lake Rotomahana and the terraces, access to which was controlled by Tūhourangi. Artist Charles Blomfield recounted that tourists would arrive at the White Terrace about 11 a.m., view the sights there, lunch on potatoes and kōura (freshwater crayfish) cooked at a boiling spring, cross over to the Pink Terraces, bathe there and then go back.

Those who made the journey to the terraces were most frequently well-to-do, young male overseas tourists or officers from the British forces in New Zealand. The list of notable tourists included Sir George Grey in 1849, Alfred Duke of Edinburgh in 1869, and Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope in 1874.

The appearance of the terraces was recorded for posterity by a number of photographers, but as it was before colour photography was invented, their images lack the enticing colour the formations were known for. Several artists drew and painted the terraces before their loss in 1886, most notably Charles Blomfield who visited on more than one occasion. Their atmospheric views are the main record of the Eighth Wonder of the World. The colour chemistry of the Pink Terraces can be seen today at Waiotapu, where the Champagne Pool is lined with these same colloidal sulfides.

Sophia Hinerangi, sometimes known as Te Paea, took over as principal guide from the older Kate Middlemass in the early 1880s. She became recognised as the principal tourist guide of the Pink and White Terraces. Hinerangi observed the disturbances to Lake Tarawera water levels in the days preceding the eruption. In 1885, Alfred Warbrick, a boat builder at Te Wairoa, began guiding, though he was not from Te Tūhourangi.

==Mapping==

A number of people mapped and commented on the region before the loss of the terraces. No Māori maps are known. The first colonial sketch map of the lake was by Assistant Surveyor-General Percy Smith in 1858. Hochstetter carried out the first topographic and geological survey of the Lake Rotomahana area in 1859, producing four maps of the lake while camped on its shore; culminating in his defining &quot;Method of Squares&quot; (or Grid) lake map of 30/4/1859. His lake research was later published in his &quot;Geographic and Geological survey&quot; where the formation of the terraces was also examined. A commissioned map by August Petermann was included in that work and this was considered valid until 2011 when researcher Sascha Nolden discovered Hochstetter&#x27;s original maps in Switzerland and repatriated them to New Zealand in digital form. In 2017 the Hochstetter and Petermann maps were compared and Petermann&#x27;s map found defective. Hochstetter&#x27;s 30/4/1859 map is now considered the more accurate map of Lake Rotomahana.

High quality photographs of the terraces were available in Europe by 1875.

==Disappearance==

On 10 June 1886, Mount Tarawera erupted. The eruption spread from west of Wahanga dome, to the north, down to Lake Rotomahana. The volcano belched out hot mud, red hot boulders, and immense clouds of black ash from a rift that crossed the mountain, passed through the lake, and extended beyond into the Waimangu valley.

After the eruption, a crater over in depth encompassed the former site of the terraces. After some years this filled with water to form a new Lake Rotomahana, higher, ten times larger and deeper than the old lake.

After methodically examining the region over the months following the eruption, along with a number of government experts, Percy Smith declared that either the terraces were buried under stone, or else had sunk into the main crater.

==Location==
The prevailing view in the years following the 1886 eruption was that the terraces had been destroyed and that they would never be seen again. However, there were some, Chief Guide Warbrick principal among them, who continued to maintain that they had survived, buried beneath a deposit of mud and volcanic ash, although none was able to produce any evidence to support claims of survival.

Although active searching for the terraces had long ceased, in February 2011 a team of researchers from GNS Science, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory and Waikato University reported discovering part of the Pink Terraces in the course of their mapping the floor of Lake Rotomahana with a REMUS underwater vehicle. The lowest two tiers of the terraces were reported found at 60 metres (200 ft) deep. A part of the White Terraces was also reported as rediscovered in June 2011.

The 2011 GNS claims of rediscovery were challenged by Bill Keir, a freelance researcher, who calculated that the &#x27;rediscovered&#x27; structures were not where the terraces had been before the eruption and speculated that they were either prehistoric terraces or step-shaped objects created by the eruption. Keir&#x27;s speculations were rebutted by Cornel de Ronde, Research Geologist at GNS Science.

In February 2014, Bunn founded PAWTL (Pink &amp; White Terraces Limited), a social enterprise company, with the objective of draining the lake and recovering the &quot;in situ&quot; terraces, relying on the GNS locations. The company was to be operated by the Tūhourangi and Ngati Rangitihi Arawa hapū that had been associated with tourist ventures to the Terraces in the nineteenth century, However, after GNS advised of the risk of an eruption, the project was suspended.

In March 2016, the GNS team published in the &quot;Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research&quot; results of returns to the site in 2012 and 2014. In that paper, they retracted their previous claims of rediscovery and concluded that &quot;the majority of both sets of terraces were destroyed&quot;.

Later in 2016, in December, Bunn and Nolden published a paper that drew on Nolden&#x27;s discovery in 2010 of Hochstetter&#x27;s original maps to suggest the locations may have survived the eruption. In a follow-up paper published in June 2017 in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand&quot;, Bunn and Nolden concluded that, contrary to the prevailing belief, the Pink and White Terraces were not submerged beneath Lake Rotomahana, but were instead buried 10 to 15 metres (33 to 49 ft) underground along the shoreline, and could potentially be excavated and restored to public view, dependent on the permission of the Māori iwi which owned the land.

A paper by Keir in December 2017 disputed Bunn and Nolden&#x27;s findings and contended that the terraces could not have survived intact.

Tūhourangi Tribal Authority chairman Alan Skipwith, speaking after TV3 in March 2018 had referred to the terraces&#x27; &quot;discovery&quot;, thanked Bunn and Nolden for their research that potentially proved the location of the terraces but stated that the Authority was in no position to conclusively identify a location. Two researchers from NIWA, acknowledging the relevance of their research to the Tūhourangi iwi, disputed the location of the terraces using Hochstetter&#x27;s mapping; Bunn countered with a commentary that pointed out errors in their findings and their conclusion that the terraces were destroyed.

In June 2018, a paper by Bunn, Davies and Stewart used a novel &quot;field of view&quot; approach to establish &quot;with maximum possible accuracy&quot; the locations of the terraces, taking previously unpublished photographs from Hochstetter&#x27;s 1859 expedition, along with his diary entries, as reference points.

Later in 2018, de Ronde, Tontini and Keam contended that the locations identified in Bunn and Nolden&#x27;s 2016 and 2017 papers were unsupported by their own analyses, which indicated that the terraces &quot;largely would have been destroyed&quot;.

Between 2019 and 2024, Bunn and fellow researchers published books and papers that accumulated a body of evidence for the survival of the terraces in the locations that they had identified. This evidence included the first altimetric measurements of the landscape, triangulation of coordinates for the White Terrace, mātauranga Māori knowledge, and the analysis of a recently restored pre-eruption photograph by pioneer photographer Wiliam Fitzgerald Crawford. A major conclusion was that the White Terraces presently lie buried on the existing Lake Rotomahana shoreline outside the 1886 crater and that excavation of the terraces is feasible.

<doc id="311560" wikidata="Q1074448" url="?curid=311560" title="Chinookan peoples">
<text>Chinookan peoples include several groups of Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest in the United States who speak the Chinookan languages. Since at least 4000 BCE Chinookan peoples have resided along the upper and Middle Columbia River (Wimahl) (&quot;Great River&quot;) from the river&#x27;s gorge (near the present town of The Dalles, Oregon) downstream (west) to the river&#x27;s mouth, and along adjacent portions of the coasts, from Tillamook Head of present-day Oregon in the south, north to Willapa Bay in southwest Washington. In 1805 the Lewis and Clark Expedition encountered the Chinook Tribe on the lower Columbia.

The term &quot;Chinook&quot; also has a wider meaning in reference to the Chinook Jargon, which is based on Chinookan languages, in part, and so the term &quot;Chinookan&quot; was coined by linguists to distinguish the older language from its offspring, Chinuk Wawa. There are several theories about where the name &quot;Chinook&quot; came from. Some say it is a Chehalis word &quot;Tsinúk&quot; for the inhabitants of and a particular village site on Baker Bay, or &quot;Fish Eaters&quot;. It may also be a word meaning &quot;strong fighters&quot;.

Some Chinookan peoples are part of several federally recognized Tribes: the Yakama Nation (primarily Wishram), the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation (primarily Wasco), and the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community.

The Chinook Indian Nation, consisting of the five westernmost tribes of Chinookan peoples, Lower Chinook, Clatsop, Willapa, Wahkiakum, and Kathlamet is currently (2024) working to restore federal recognition. The Chinook Nation gained Federal Recognition on January 3, 2001 from the Department of Interior under President Bill Clinton. After President George W. Bush was elected, his political appointees reviewed the case and, in a highly unusual action, revoked the recognition.

The Chinook Nation sought Congressional support for recognition by the legislature in 2008 with a Bill Introduced by Brian Baird. The Bill died in Congress.

The unrecognized &quot;Tchinouk Indians of Oregon&quot; trace their Chinook ancestry to two Chinook women who married French Canadians traders from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company prior to 1830. The specific Chinook band these women were from or if they were Lower or Upper Chinook could not be determined. These individuals, settled in the French Prairie region of northwestern Oregon, becoming part of the community of French Canadians and Métis (Mix-Bloods). There is no evidence that they are a distinct Indian community within French Prairie. The Chinook Indian Nation denied that the Tchinouk had any common history with them or any organizational affiliation. On January 16, 1986, the Bureau of Indian Affairs determined that the Tchinouk Indians of Oregon do not meet the requirements necessary to be a federally recognized tribe.

The unrecognized &quot;Clatsop-Nehalem Confederate Tribes&quot; was formed in 2000. The Clatsop-Nehalem have approximately 130 members and claim to have Chinookan and Salish-speaking Tillamook (Nehalem) ancestry. This is contested by the Chinook Indian Nation. The Indian Claims Commission, Docket 234, found, in 1957, that the Clatsop Chinooks were part of the Chinook Indian Nation. The Indian Claims Commission also found in Docket 240, 1962, that the Nehalem people were part of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians.

==Historic culture==

===Practices and lifestyle===
The Chinookan peoples were relatively settled and occupied traditional tribal geographic areas, where they hunted and fished; salmon was a mainstay of their diet. The women also gathered and processed many nuts, seeds, roots and other foods. They had a society marked by social stratification, consisting of a number of distinct social castes of greater or lesser status. Upper castes included shamans, warriors, and successful traders. They composed a minority of the community population compared to common members. Members of the superior castes are said to have practiced social discrimination, limiting contact with commoners and forbidding play between the children of the different social groups.

Some Chinookan peoples practiced slavery, a practice borrowed from the northernmost tribes of the Pacific Northwest. They took slaves as captives in warfare, and used them to practice thievery on behalf of their masters. The latter refrained from such practices as unworthy of high status.
The elite of some tribes had the practice of head binding, flattening their children&#x27;s forehead and top of the skull as a mark of social status. They bound the infant&#x27;s head under pressure between boards when the infant was about 3 months old and continued until the child was about one year of age. This custom was a means of marking social hierarchy; flat-headed community members had a rank above those with round heads. Those with flattened skulls refused to enslave other persons who were similarly marked, thereby reinforcing the association of a round head with servility. The Chinook were known colloquially by early white explorers in the region as &quot;Flathead Indians&quot;.

Living near the coast of the Pacific Ocean, the Chinook were skilled elk hunters and fishermen. The most popular fish was salmon. Owing partly to their settled living patterns, the Chinook and other coastal tribes had relatively little conflict over land, as they did not migrate through each other&#x27;s territories and they had rich resources in the natural environment. In the manner of numerous settled tribes, the Chinook resided in longhouses. More than fifty people, related through extended kinship, often resided in one longhouse. Their longhouses were made of planks made from red cedar trees. The houses were about 20–60 feet wide and 50–150 feet long.

===Language and storytelling===

====Franz Boas (1858–1942)====
In 1888, Franz Boas published &quot;The Journal of American Folk-Lore&quot; a journal discussing American Folklore, here he describes some &quot;Chinook songs&quot; and offers them in both the Chinook language and English translation.

The &quot;Native Legends of Oregon and Washington Collected&quot; is collection of Chinook legends and stories written and collected by Boas in 1893, it was a collection of different Chinook folklore taken from his time spent with the Chinookan people between the years of 1890 and 1891 during his summer trips to Oregon and Washington.

He also wrote the &quot;Chinook Texts&quot;, which was published in 1894. In this reference book, Boas includes various, myths, beliefs, customs, tales, and historical tales, as told by the Chinookan people themselves.

====George Gibbs (1815–1873) ====
George Gibbs was another popular anthropologist of his time. He collected the &quot;Alphabetical Vocabulary of the Chinook Language&quot;. Gibbs was assisted by Robert Shortess and Soloman H. Smith of Oregon and A. C. Anderson of Victoria, Vancouver Island. The many words were collected and scattered from various different tribes given the scarcity of the Chinookan people at the time. The book was mainly written for trading purposes and Gibbs collected the majority of his translation from the traders themselves.

==Chinook people today==
The Chinookan peoples have long had a community on the lower Columbia River. These lower Columbia Chinook tribes and bands re-organized in the 20th century, setting up an elected form of government and reviving tribal culture. They first sought recognition as a federally recognized sovereign tribe in the late 20th century, as this would provide certain treaty-promised benefits for education and welfare. The Department of Interior&#x27;s Bureau of Indian Affairs rejected their application in 1997. Since the late 20th century, the Chinook Indian Nation has engaged in a continuing effort to secure formal recognition, conducting research and developing documentation to demonstrate its history. They are referred to in government and historic accounts, but treaties signed at Tansy Point in 1851 were not acted upon by Congress through a formal ratification process. This inaction caused the Chinook territories defined in the treaties to remain unceded. Nevertheless, these territories were taken by the federal government. If Congress had formally ratified the treaties, a reservation would have been established, which would have meant automatic recognition.

In 2001, the U.S. Department of Interior recognized the Chinook Indian Nation, a confederation of the Cathlamet, Clatsop, Lower Chinook, Wahkiakum and Willapa Indians, as a tribe, according to its rules established in consultation with other recognized tribes. The tribe had documented continuity of their community over time on the lower Columbia. This recognition was announced during the last months of the administration of President Bill Clinton.
Since the 1930s, individual Chinook people have had Allotments on the timber-rich Quinault Reservation in Grays Harbor County, Washington. The Quinault appealed recognition of the Chinook in August 2001, and the matter was taken up by the new administration.

After President George W. Bush was elected, his new political appointees reviewed the Chinook materials. In 2002, in a highly unusual action, they revoked the recognition of the Chinook and of two other tribes also approved by the previous administration. Efforts by Brian Baird, D-Wash. from Washington&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, to gain passage of legislation in 2011 to achieve recognition of the tribe were not successful. In his decision on a lawsuit filed in late 2017, U.S. District Court Judge Ronald B. Leighton ruled recognition could only be granted from Congress and other branches of government, but largely sided with the tribe; Leighton denied seven of eight claims by the Interior Department to dismiss the case, including a challenge to a 2015 rule that bars tribes from seeking recognition again.
The Chinook Indian Nation&#x27;s offices are in Bay Center, Washington. The tribe holds an Annual Winter Gathering at the plankhouse in Ridgefield, Washington. It also holds an Annual First Salmon Ceremony at Chinook Point (Fort Columbia) on the North Shore of the Columbia River. In 2019, the Chinook Indian Nation purchased ten acres of the 1851 Tansy Point treaty grounds.

In the 21st century, a large proportion of Chinook people live in the regions surrounding the towns of Bay Center, Chinook, and Ilwaco in southwest Washington and in Astoria, Oregon.

==List of Chinookan peoples==

Chinookan-speaking groups include:

=== Lower Chinookans ===
The Lower Chinookans are the related groups who spoke dialects of Lower Chinook, and who had their villages around the mouth of the Columbia River and along the coast:

* Clatsop – On the southern bank of the Columbia, from Point Adams to Youngs Bay, and on the Clatsop Plains south to Tillamook Head.
* Lower Chinook – On the northern bank of the Columbia, from Cape Diasppointment to Grays Bay.
* Shoalwater (Willapa) Chinook – On Willapa Bay

=== Kathlamet (Downstreamers) ===
The Kathlamet/Downstreamers grouping includes several small village groups which all spoke the Kathlamet language:
* Kathlamet – At Cathlamet Head.
* Qaniak – East of Oak Point.
* Skilloot(s) – The exact identity of the Skilloot(s) (or even if they were a tribe at all) is disputed. Theories range from it being a Tillamookan name for the Kalapuyans to a simple miscommunication.
* Wahkiakum – In the vicinity of Pillar Rock.

=== Multnomah (Wapato Valley) ===
This grouping refers to a dense stretch of Upper Chinook-speaking villages between the mouth of the Lewis River to Government Island:
* Cathlapotle – Above the Lewis River 
* Multnomah – on Sauvie Island
* Shoto – Recorded by Lewis and Clark, said to live on Lake Vancouver

=== Clackamas ===
The Clackamas were a Kiksht-speaking group that had one village along the Clackamas River:
* Clackamas

=== Willamette Falls ===

* Clawiwalla – On the eastern bank of the Willamette River, opposite Oregon City. Alternatively, linguist Michael Silverstein placed them with the Clackamas.

=== Shakhlatksh/Shahalas (Upstreamers) ===
The &quot;Upstreamers&quot; group refers to village groups and villages in the Cascades region of the Columbia:

* Watlala

=== Wasco-Wishram ===
* Wasco (known also by their Sahaptin name as &quot;Wascopam&quot;, lived traditionally on the south bank of the Columbia River, Oregon, they were divided into three subtribes: the &quot;Dalles Wasco&quot; or &quot;Wasco proper&quot; (near The Dalles in Wasco County), the &quot;Hood River Wasco&quot; (along the Hood River to its mouth into the Columbia River, sometimes divided into two bands: the &quot;Hood River Band&quot; in Oregon, and the &quot;White Salmon River Band&quot; in Washington). In 1822 their population was estimated to be 900, today 200 tribal members out of 4,000 of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs are estimated to be Wasco)
* Wishram (a Yakama-Sahaptin term), their autonym as &quot;Ita&#x27;xluit&quot; was the source of transliteration as &quot;Tlakluit&quot; or &quot;Echelut (Echeloot)&quot; (lived traditionally on the north bank of the Columbia River, Washington, Wishram village or &quot;Nixlúidix&quot; (&quot;trading place&quot;) near Five Mile Rapids, was the center of the regional trade system for Pacific Coast, Plateau, Great Basin and Plains tribes, in the 1700s, the estimated Wishram population was 1,500. In 1962 only 10 Wishrams were counted on the Washington census, today they are predominantly enrolled in the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation)
*&quot;Chilluckittequaw&quot; or &quot;Chiluktkwa&quot; (living on the north side of Columbia River in Klickitat and Skamania counties, Washington, from about 10 miles below the Dalles to the neighborhood of the Cascades. In 1806 Lewis and Clark estimated their number at 2,400. According to Mooney a remnant of the tribe lived near the mouth of White Salmon River until 1880, when they removed to the Cascades, where a few still resided in 1895, today sometimes considered as &quot;White Salmon River Band&quot; of Washington of the Hood River Wasco subtribe)
==Notable Chinook==
* Comcomly, chief in the early to mid-19th century
* Charles Cultee, the principal informant to early 20th-century anthropologist Franz Boas on his language and tribal studies, especially for &quot;Chinook Texts&quot;.
* Ranald MacDonald, mixed-race son of Archibald McDonald, a Scottish Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fur trader, and Raven, Chief Comcomly&#x27;s daughter, in Astoria, Oregon, was the first Westerner to teach English in Japan, in 1847–1848. He taught Einosuke Moriyama, who served as one of the chief interpreters during negotiations between Commodore Perry and the Tokugawa Shogunate
* J. Christopher Stevens, American diplomat and lawyer who served as the U.S. Ambassador to Libya from June 2012 to September 2012. He was killed when the U.S. consulate was attacked in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012
* Catherine Troeh, historian, artist, activist and advocate for Native American rights and culture. An elder of the Chinook tribe, she was a direct descendant of Chief Comcomly.
* Chief Tumulth, signed the 1855 treaty that created the Grand Ronde Reservation; he was later killed by General Philip Sheridan&#x27;s forces
* Tsin-is-tum, &quot;Princess Jennie Michel&quot;, a Native American folklorist. Called &quot;Last of the Clatsops.&quot;

<text>In a general sense, a lockout chip is a chip within an electronic device to prevent other manufacturers from using a company&#x27;s device to perform certain functions.

A notable example is the lockout chip found in Nintendo&#x27;s Nintendo Entertainment System (called 10NES), designed to prevent &quot;unlicensed&quot; manufacturers from creating games for the console. The presence of the chip forced unlicensed companies to raise the price of each cartridge (due to a bypass chip having to be added to the cartridge), and allowed Nintendo a foothold for a lawsuit.

Lockout functions are commonly used in printers to prevent the use of third-party ink or toner cartridges.
