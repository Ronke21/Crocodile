<text>William Rory Gallagher ( ; 2 March 1948 – 14 June 1995) was an Irish musician, singer, and songwriter. He is known for his virtuosic style of guitar playing and live performances, and has sometimes been referred to as &quot;the greatest guitarist you&#x27;ve never heard of&quot;. 

Gallagher gained international recognition in the late 1960s as the frontman and lead guitarist of the blues rock power trio Taste. Following the band&#x27;s break-up in 1970, he launched a solo career and was voted Guitarist of the Year by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine in 1972. Throughout his career, Gallagher performed over 2,000 concerts worldwide, including many in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. He had global record sales exceeding 30 million. 

In the 1980s, Gallagher&#x27;s health gradually declined, resulting in a liver transplant in March 1995 at King&#x27;s College Hospital in London. Following the operation, he contracted a staphylococcal infection (MRSA) and died three months later at the age of 47.

A number of guitarists in the world of rock and blues cite Gallagher as an influence, including Alex Lifeson (Rush), Brian May (Queen), Johnny Marr (The Smiths), Glenn Tipton (Judas Priest) Robert Smith (The Cure), The Edge (U2), Slash (Guns N&#x27; Roses), Jake Burns (Stiff Little Fingers), Janick Gers (Iron Maiden), James Dean Bradfield (Manic Street Preachers), Vivian Campbell (Def Leppard), Gary Moore and Joe Bonamassa. 

In 2013, he was posthumously honoured with the Tommy Vance Inspiration award at the &quot;Classic Rock&quot; Roll of Honour Awards, while in 2025, he received the &#x27;in memoriam&#x27; Cork Person of the Year award. He is also commemorated with statues in Ballyshannon and Belfast and a memorial sculpture in Cork.

==Early life==
Gallagher was born on 2 March 1948 to Daniel (Danny) and Monica Gallagher (&quot;née&quot; Roche) at the Rock Hospital in Ballyshannon in County Donegal, Ireland. He was baptised in the nearby St Joseph&#x27;s Church. Danny was from Derry, and served for a time in the Irish Army, while Monica was from County Cork.

His father, Danny, was employed by the Irish Electricity Supply Board (ESB), who were constructing Cathaleen&#x27;s Fall hydroelectric power station on the River Erne above Ballyshannon. Danny Gallagher also played the accordion and sang with the Inishowen Céilí Band in County Donegal.

Rory Gallagher&#x27;s mother, Monica, sang and acted with the Abbey Players in Ballyshannon. The main theatre of the Abbey Arts Centre in Ballyshannon, where she used to perform, was renamed the Rory Gallagher Theatre in 2005.

In 1949, the family moved to Derry City and settled at 32 Orchard Row. It was here that Gallagher&#x27;s younger brother Dónal was born later that year. Dónal would go on to manage Gallagher throughout most of his career. While in Derry, Gallagher attended the Christian Brothers Primary School, known locally as the Brow of the Hill.

In 1956, Gallagher, along with his mother and brother, relocated to Cork, where they lived with his maternal grandparents in an apartment above the Modern Bar (later renamed Roche&#x27;s Bar) at 27 MacCurtain Street in the city. He attended the North Monastery School and, later St Kieran&#x27;s College.

Gallagher displayed musical aptitude at an early age. He taught himself how to play the ukulele, and received a guitar from his parents at age nine. He began performing at minor functions and won a cash prize in a talent contest when he was twelve that he used to buy a new guitar. Three years later, in 1963, he purchased a 1961 Fender Stratocaster for £100 from Crowley&#x27;s Music Shop. This guitar became his primary instrument and was most associated with him during his career.

Gallagher was initially attracted to skiffle after hearing Lonnie Donegan on the radio. Donegan frequently covered blues and folk performers from the United States. He relied entirely on radio programmes and television. Occasionally, the BBC would play some blues numbers, and he slowly found some songbooks for guitar that revealed the names of the actual composers of blues pieces.

While still in school, playing songs by Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran, he discovered his greatest influence in Muddy Waters. He began experimenting with folk, blues, and rock music. Unable to find or afford albums, Gallagher stayed up late to hear Radio Luxembourg and AFN where the radio brought him his only exposure to the actual songwriters and musicians whose music moved him most.

Influences he discovered, and cited as he progressed, included Woody Guthrie, Big Bill Broonzy, and Lead Belly. Singing and later using a brace for his harmonica, Gallagher taught himself to play slide guitar. He would go on to learn alto saxophone, bass, mandolin, banjo, electric sitar, and bouzouki with varying degrees of proficiency. By his mid-teens, he began experimenting heavily with different blues styles.

== The showband years ==
Gallagher was eager to form a band but struggled to find anyone in Cork who shared his interest. In the summer of 1963, while searching through local newspapers, he came across an advertisement from brothers Oliver and Bernie Tobin, who were looking for a lead guitarist to join their newly-formed band, the Fontana Showband. The six-piece ensemble, which played the popular hits of the day, featured Bernie Tobin on trombone, Oliver Tobin on bass, John Lehane on saxophone, Eamonn O&#x27;Sullivan on drums, and Jimmy Flynn on guitar. Gallagher impressed the band with his audition and soon secured the position. Shortly after, Flynn left the band by mutual consent and Declan O’Keefe joined as rhythm guitarist.

The band performed in ballrooms and dancehalls across Ireland almost every evening, often for 5-6 hours at a time. This allowed Gallagher to earn the money for the payments that were due on his Stratocaster guitar. During Lent, when dances were &quot;banned&quot; by the Catholic Church in Ireland, they toured Great Britain. 

Despite not playing the music he truly wanted, Gallagher saw the Fontana Showband as a valuable training ground. Gradually, he began to influence the band&#x27;s repertoire, steering it away from mainstream pop music and incorporating some of Chuck Berry&#x27;s songs. By 1965, he had successfully moulded Fontana into &quot;The Impact&quot;, now with Michael Lehane on keyboards and Johnny Campbell on drums, replacing O’Sullivan.

On 22 April 1965, The Impact made an appearance on Irish television show &quot;Pickin’ the Pops&quot;, where they were scheduled to perform Buddy Holly’s &#x27;Valley of Tears’. However, at the last minute, Gallagher switched the song to Larry Williams’ ‘Slow Down’ instead, an act that caused a sensation. 

In June 1965, the band went to Spain for a residency at an American Air Force base outside Madrid, in Alcalá de Henares. With Spain under dictatorship at this time, Gallagher was required to cut his hair before entering the country. After their time in Spain, the band returned to Ireland to play at the Bandon Carnival, followed by a three-week tour in Britain. 

By early summer 1966, The Impact had dissolved. Gallagher, along with bassist Oliver Tobin and drummer Johnny Campbell, formed a trio and started a three-week stint at the Big Apple in Hamburg, Germany. They were billed as ‘The Fendermen’ by their former showband manager Neil Crawford. 

Upon returning to Ireland, Gallagher stepped in as vocalist and guitarist for the local Cork band, The Axills. The band had been left short-handed after the departure of members Derek ‘Doc’ Green and Peter Sanquest and faced the challenge of fulfilling their remaining gig commitments.

==Taste==

=== 1966-1968 Taste Mark 1 ===
Having completed a musical apprenticeship in the showbands, and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early 1960s, Gallagher decided it was time to form his own band. In 1966, he enlisted the two remaining members of The Axills - bassist Norman Damery and drummer Eric Kitteringham - and together they formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply Taste, a blues rock and R&amp;B power trio. The band was formed inside the Long Valley Bar, with the name Taste inspired by a beermat boasting the superior taste of Beamish stout.

The band began rehearsing on the upper floor of 5 Park View, where the Kitteringham family lived, and made their debut on 10 September 1966 at a school dance held at the Imperial Hotel on Grand Parade in Cork. Looking to expand their reach to Belfast&#x27;s blues scene, they performed at the city&#x27;s Sammy Houston&#x27;s Jazz Club on Great Victoria Street in December 1966. Their performance caught the attention of promoter Eddie Kennedy, who signed them to a residency at the Maritime Hotel. During this time, they opened for acts like Cream, Fleetwood Mac and Chris Farlowe &amp; The Thunderbirds.

In 1968, Taste moved to London when Kennedy secured a residency for them at the Marquee Club. The band&#x27;s raw sound made an immediate impression on both critics and fellow musicians, with John Lennon telling a New Musical Express writer, “I heard Taste for the first time the other day and that bloke is going places.” However, when Polydor showed interest in signing them, Kennedy insisted on replacing Damery and Kitteringham, citing the label&#x27;s concerns. Despite initial resistance from Gallagher, the rhythm section was replaced by drummer John Wilson and bassist Richard McCracken, both experienced musicians from Belfast. 

=== 1968-1970 Taste Mark 2 ===
In August 1968, the new line-up of Taste signed with Polydor. Three months later, at Eric Clapton&#x27;s request, they were invited to support Cream at their farewell concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. Taste would later tour the U.S as the opening act for blues supergroup Blind Faith, featuring Clapton, Ginger Baker, Steve Winwood and Ric Grech. 

In early 1969, Taste recorded their eponymous debut album &quot;Taste&quot; in a single day at De Lane Lea Studios in London. It was released in April and praised by critics for its &quot;raw and honest&quot; sound, selling particularly well in Northern Europe. This was followed by &quot;On the Boards&quot; in January 1970, which reached no. 18 on the UK Albums Chart. The album showcased Gallagher’s creative range, mixing blues rock with acoustic ballads and experimental jazz-blues fusion. 

Throughout 1970, Taste continued to build their reputation as a live band, breaking the Marquee Club’s all-time box office record on 21 July, previously held by Jimi Hendrix. Other notable performances that year include the Isle of Wight Festival and the Montreux Jazz Festival. However, behind the scenes, tensions were escalating due to creative differences and management issues. Notably, Wilson refused to go back onstage for an encore at a gig in Glasgow, and Gallagher claims they were not talking to each other at the Isle of Wight Festival. 

Amid these tensions, Gallagher decided to disband Taste, feeling that the band had &quot;just came to the end of our natural life.&quot; Their final concert took place at Queen’s University in Belfast on 24 October 1970. Following the breakup, Polydor released two unofficial live albums, &quot;Live Taste&quot; and &quot;Live at the Isle of Wight.&quot;. 

Speaking to &quot;Good Times&quot; in 1992, Gallagher described the break-up of Taste as a &quot;traumatic&quot; and &quot;very dreadful time&quot;, particularly because &quot;the press all attacked me as if I was some kind of dictator.&quot; He would later reflect on the situation with regret, describing it as a &quot;communications breakdown&quot; that &quot;shouldn&#x27;t have been allowed to happen.&quot;

Gallagher&#x27;s brother Dónal, who took on the role of his manager, insisted they bring his previous manager, Eddie Kennedy, to court to recoup royalty payments, but Kennedy capitulated before the case reached trial. He agreed to transfer the Taste royalties, though he claimed to have no money. This meant that Gallagher never received any of the funds generated from Taste’s album sales. The episode made Gallagher reluctant to seek out &#x27;big&#x27; management deals in future, and he later turned down an approach from Led Zeppelin&#x27;s manager, Peter Grant. He also never performed a Taste song on stage again.

==Solo career==
After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name, hiring former Deep Joy bass player Gerry McAvoy ( later of Nine Below Zero ) to play on Gallagher&#x27;s self-titled debut album, &quot;Rory Gallagher&quot;.

It was the beginning of a twenty-year musical relationship between Gallagher and McAvoy; the other band member was drummer Wilgar Campbell. The 1970s were Gallagher&#x27;s most prolific period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, &quot;Live! in Europe&quot; and &quot;Irish Tour &#x27;74&quot;. November 1971 saw the release of the album &quot;Deuce&quot;.

In 1972, he was voted &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Guitarist/Musician of the Year. However, despite a number of his albums from this period reaching the UK Albums Chart, Gallagher did not attain major star status.

Gallagher played and recorded what he said was &quot;in me all the time, and not just something I turn on ...&quot;. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him the greatest acclaim. He is documented in &quot;Irish Tour &#x27;74&quot;, a film directed by Tony Palmer.

During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about playing there at least once a year during his career. In 1974, they stayed in the Europa Hotel in Belfast, which was known as &quot;the most bombed hotel in Europe&quot;. This approach won him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, he became a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

Gallagher said in several interviews that there were not any international Irish acts until Van Morrison and he, and later Phil Lynott and Thin Lizzy. The line-up which included Rod de&#x27;Ath on drums and Lou Martin on keyboards performed together between 1973 and 1976. However, he eventually dropped down to just bass, guitar and drums, and his act became a power trio. In January 1975, when the Rolling Stones gathered in Rotterdam, Netherlands, to continue working towards their album &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, they auditioned new guitarists, to replace Mick Taylor, as they recorded. Gallagher went over for a jam with the band &quot;just to see what was going on,&quot; but did not join the group, happy with his solo career.

In 1975, Gallagher&#x27;s contract with Polydor came to an end, and he signed with Chrysalis Records. At the time, it was hoped that Chrysalis &quot;wanted to give him the close, personal attention that he never really had before. [They] wanted to go all-out with him.&quot; Some early interaction with Chrysalis showed that Gallagher liked to keep tight artistic control over his work: while making &quot;Calling Card&quot;, he resisted producer Roger Glover of Deep Purple&#x27;s effort to make a cleaner sound; rejected the mixes made by Elliot Mazer, and &quot;hit the roof&quot; when Chris Wright suggested that the song &quot;Edged in Blue&quot; be cut in length to make it a single, and the album&#x27;s name be changed to match it. Other releases from the Chrysalis period include &quot;Photo-Finish&quot; and &quot;Top Priority&quot;.

The Gallagher band performed on several TV and radio shows across Europe, including &quot;Beat-Club&quot; in Bremen, Germany and the &quot;Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;. He recorded two &quot;Peel Sessions&quot; (both February 1973 and containing the same tracks), but only the first was broadcast. Along with Little Feat and Roger McGuinn, Gallagher performed at the first Rockpalast live concert at the Grugahalle, Essen, Germany in 1977.

Gallagher collaborated with Jerry Lee Lewis and Muddy Waters on their respective &quot;London Sessions&quot; in the mid-1970s. He played on Lonnie Donegan&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Style&quot;.

In the 1980s he continued recording, producing &quot;Jinx&quot;, &quot;Defender&quot;, and &quot;Fresh Evidence&quot;. After &quot;Fresh Evidence&quot;, he embarked on a tour of the United States. In addition, he played with Box of Frogs, a band formed in 1983 by former members of The Yardbirds. Becoming obsessive over details and plagued by self-doubt, Gallagher nevertheless retained a loyal fanbase. During this period he stated &quot;I agonize too much&quot;.

&quot;Notes From San Francisco&quot;, an album of unreleased studio tracks and a San Francisco 1979 concert, was released in May 2011.

==Guitars and equipment==

===1961 Fender Stratocaster===
The main instrument that Gallagher played throughout his career was a sunburst 1961 Fender Stratocaster (Serial Number 64351). It was reputedly the first in Ireland, and originally owned by Jim Conlon, lead guitarist in the Irish band Royal Showband. Gallagher bought it second-hand from Crowley&#x27;s Music Shop of Cork&#x27;s MacCurtain Street in August 1963 for £100. Speaking about Gallagher&#x27;s purchase, his brother Dónal recalled: &quot;His dream ambition was to have a guitar like Buddy Holly. This Stratocaster was in the store as a used instrument, it was 100 pounds. In today&#x27;s money you couldn&#x27;t even compare; you might as well say it was a million pounds. My mother was saying we&#x27;ll be in debt for the rest of our lives and Rory said, &#x27;Well, actually with a guitar like this I can play both parts, rhythm and lead, we won&#x27;t need a rhythm player so I can earn more money and pay it off.&#x27; So the Stratocaster became his partner for life if you like.&quot;

In 1967, while in Dublin to visit Pat Egan at the Five Club, Gallagher&#x27;s Stratocaster was stolen, along with a Telecaster he had borrowed from a friend. Gallagher contacted the producers of a television programme called &quot;Garda Patrol&quot;, who featured the stolen guitars in one of their segments. A few days later, the Stratocaster was discovered abandoned in a ditch behind a garden wall on the South Circular Road and was returned to him. 

Virtually all of the finish on Gallagher&#x27;s Stratocaster was stripped away over time, and, while he took care to keep the guitar in playable condition, Gallagher never had it restored, stating &quot;the less paint or varnish on a guitar, acoustic or electric, the better. The wood breathes more. But it’s all psychological. I just like the sound of it&quot;. Gallagher&#x27;s brother Dónal has also stated that, owing to his rare blood type, Gallagher&#x27;s sweat was unusually acidic, acting to prematurely age the instrument&#x27;s paintwork.

The guitar was extensively modified by Gallagher. The tuning pegs and the nut were replaced, the latter changed a number of times. The pickguard was also changed during Gallagher&#x27;s time with Taste. Only the middle pick-up is original. The final modification was the wiring – Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone pot and rewired it so he had just a master tone control along with the master volume control. He installed a five-way selector switch in place of the vintage three-way type.

Speaking of the Stratocaster in a 1993 interview, Gallagher said, &quot;This is the best, it&#x27;s my life, this is my best friend. It&#x27;s almost like knowing its weak spots are strong spots. I don&#x27;t like to get sentimental about these things, but when you spend 30 years of your life with the same instrument, it&#x27;s like a walking memory bank of your life there in your arms.&quot;

In late October 2011, Dónal Gallagher brought the guitar out of retirement to allow Joe Bonamassa to perform with it on his two nights at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. Bonamassa opened both night&#x27;s performances with his rendition of &quot;Cradle Rock&quot; using Gallagher&#x27;s Stratocaster.

In July 2024, Dónal Gallagher announced that he would be auctioning the Stratocaster through Bonhams. The guitar was sold later in 2024 for £700,000. The buyer, the concert promoter Denis Desmond, made the purchase following discussions with the Irish Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the intention of donating the guitar to the National Museum of Ireland (NMI). On 5 February 2025, it was announced that the Stratocaster would be put on display by the NMI from September 2025.

===Other equipment===

Known for his Stratocaster, Gallagher also used a number of other guitars, including acoustic examples, during his career. In April 2014 one of the last guitars owned by Gallagher, a custom-built Patrick Eggle &#x27;JS Berlin Legend&#x27;, was sold at auction in England for £25,000.

Gallagher used a number of models of amplifiers during his career, generally preferring smaller &#x27;combo&#x27; amplifiers to more powerful Marshall stacks popular with rock and hard rock guitarists. To make up for the relative lack of power on stage, he would link several different combo amps together.
When Gallagher was with Taste, he used a single Vox AC30 with a Dallas Rangemaster treble booster plugged into the &#x27;normal&#x27; input. Gallagher also used an Ibanez Tube Screamer, and several Boss effects, including a flanger.

In the 1970s, Gallagher began to use Fender amplifiers with a Hawk booster. Later in the 1970s, when Gallagher was moving towards a hard rock sound, he experimented with Ampeg VT40 and VT22 amplifiers, and also used Marshall combos.

Gallagher was an early adopter of Boss ME-5 all-in-one floor-based effects units, and used such a unit for his live work until his death. He also used Stramp 2100a amplifiers, which can be seen in his appearances on the German &quot;Beat Club&quot; programme. Another company that built amplifiers for Gallagher was PCL Vintage Amp.

==Death==

In the later years of his life, Gallagher developed a phobia of flying. To overcome this, he was prescribed various drugs. Gallagher also had a series of health problems for which he was prescribed steroids (e.g., thyroid disorder, psoriasis, asthma). By the time of his final performance on 10 January 1995 in the Netherlands, he was visibly ill with severe abdominal pain and the tour had to be cancelled.

Gallagher was admitted to London&#x27;s King&#x27;s College Hospital in March 1995, and it was only then that the extent of his ill health became apparent; his liver was failing and the doctors determined that, in spite of his relatively young age, a liver transplant was the only possible course of action. After thirteen weeks in intensive care, while waiting to be transferred to a convalescent home, his health suddenly worsened when he contracted a staphylococcal (MRSA) infection, and he died on 14 June 1995, at the age of 47. He was unmarried and had no children.

Gallagher was buried in St Oliver&#x27;s Cemetery in Ballincollig, near Cork City, in Ireland. The grave&#x27;s headstone is in the image of an award he received in 1972 for International Guitarist of the Year.

==Legacy==
In 2003, &quot;Wheels Within Wheels&quot;, a collection of acoustic tracks, was released posthumously by Gallagher&#x27;s brother Dónal. Collaborators on this album included Bert Jansch, Martin Carthy, The Dubliners, Spanish flamenco guitarist Juan Martin and Lonnie Donegan.

Many modern-day musicians, including The Edge from U2, Slash of Guns N&#x27; Roses, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, Davy Knowles, Janick Gers of Iron Maiden, Alex Lifeson of Rush, James Dean Bradfield of Manic Street Preachers, Glenn Tipton of Judas Priest, Vivian Campbell of Def Leppard, Gary Moore, and Joe Bonamassa, cite Gallagher as an inspiration in their formative musical years.

Brian May, lead guitarist of Queen, relates: &quot;So these couple of kids come up, who&#x27;s me and my mate, and say &#x27;How do you get your sound Mr Gallagher?&#x27; and he sits and tells us. So I owe Rory Gallagher my sound.&quot; The sound to which May refers consists of a Dallas Rangemaster Treble Booster in combination with a Vox AC30 amplifier. In 2010, Gallagher was ranked No. 42 on Gibson.com&#x27;s List of their Top 50 Guitarists of All Time. Gallagher was also listed in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time, at 57th place. In April 2014, at the time of the auction of Gallagher&#x27;s Patrick Eggle &quot;JS Berlin Legend&quot; guitar, the BBC noted: &quot;Eric Clapton credited him with &#x27;getting me back into the blues&#x27;&quot;.

===Tributes===

<doc id="316153" wikidata="Q577809" url="?curid=316153" title="Victor Atiyeh">
<text>Victor George Atiyeh (; February 20, 1923 – July 20, 2014) was an American politician who served as the 32nd Governor of Oregon from 1979 to 1987. He was also the first elected governor of Middle Eastern descent and of Syrian descent in the United States.

Atiyeh was elected in 1978, defeating incumbent Democratic governor Robert W. Straub. He was re-elected against future governor Ted Kulongoski with 61.6% of the vote in 1982, the largest margin in 32 years. Prior to being elected governor, Atiyeh had served continuously in the Oregon legislature since 1959, initially in the House and later in the Senate.

As of , Atiyeh is the most recent Republican to have held the office of Governor of Oregon to date.

==Early life==
Atiyeh&#x27;s parents, George Atiyeh and Linda Asly, immigrated to the United States from Amar al-Husn, Syria and Beirut, Lebanon respectively. Atiyeh&#x27;s father came through Ellis Island in 1898 to join his brother Aziz&#x27;s carpet business. Atiyeh&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family belonged to the Antiochian Orthodox Church though Atiyeh would join the Episcopal Church later in life.

Atiyeh grew up in Portland, Oregon, attending Holladay Grade School and Washington High School. He spent two years at the University of Oregon in Eugene, where he played guard for the Oregon Ducks football program and became a regional leader in the Boy Scouts of America. When his father died, Atiyeh dropped out of college and took over his family&#x27;s rug and carpet business, Atiyeh Brothers.

==Career==

Atiyeh served as a member of the Oregon House of Representatives for Washington County from 1959 to 1964 and in the Oregon State Senate for the 9th district from 1965 to 1978.

=== Governor of Oregon ===
In 1974, Atiyeh ran for governor and lost to Democrat Robert W. Straub. After defeating former governor Tom McCall in the primary, Atiyeh ran against Straub again in the 1978 election, but won this time with 55 percent of the vote. He was the first Arab American to be elected as a U.S. governor.

In 1982, Atiyeh won re-election to a second four-year term, winning 61.4% of the vote over Democrat Ted Kulongoski - the largest victory margin in 32 years for a gubernatorial election in Oregon. Atiyeh carried all 36 counties in the state.

As governor, Atiyeh established new public safety programs for Oregon&#x27;s traditional fishing and lumber trades. He provided incentives to bring new industries to the state to diversify the economy, including the opening of a trade office in Tokyo, Japan, Oregon&#x27;s first overseas trade office. He launched a worldwide tourism initiative and worked towards the designation of the Columbia River Gorge as a national scenic preservation area. These efforts earned him the nickname &quot;Trader Vic.&quot; As a result, the international concourse at Portland International Airport is dedicated to him and contains a statue of him.

Atiyeh helped establish a statewide food bank, which was the nation&#x27;s first. He also worked to raise awareness of the dangers of drunk driving and signed new laws against the practice. He chaired the Republican Governors Association and was the Republican National Convention&#x27;s floor leader for President Ronald Reagan in 1984.

===Volunteer and charitable work===
Atiyeh had a long relationship with Forest Grove-based Pacific University, serving as a trustee and trustee emeritus and accepting an honorary doctorate from the university in 1996. He donated a trove of his memorabilia to the university library in 2011.

===Later career===
After leaving office, Atiyeh became an international trade consultant.

In 2006, Atiyeh co-chaired the &quot;Yes on 49&quot; campaign, supporting Ballot Measure 49, along with Democratic former governor Barbara Roberts, former and future governor John Kitzhaber, and then-governor Ted Kulongoski. He solicited a $100,000 donation to the campaign from Phil Knight, CEO of Nike.

== Personal life ==
Atiyeh lived in Portland with his wife, Dolores (&quot;née&quot; Hewitt), whom he married on July 5, 1944. They had two children, Tom and Suzanne. Dolores Atiyeh died on August 29, 2016, in Portland at the age of 92.

===Health and death===
On August 31, 2005, Atiyeh underwent quadruple bypass surgery; he drove himself to St. Vincent Medical Center after suffering chest pains. Atiyeh was noted for his fiscal conservatism; his spokesman noted that he had stopped on his way to the hospital to fill his car with gas, having observed the sharply rising prices. In the weeks following the surgery, Atiyeh was readmitted to the hospital for several brief stays after suffering shortness of breath and pain in his arms.

On July 5, 2014, Atiyeh fell at his home. He was admitted again to Providence St. Vincent Medical Center, where he was treated for internal bleeding; while he was briefly released, he was re-hospitalized after incurring an adverse reaction to pain medication, and died from kidney failure on July 20, at age 91.

<text>The chamois (; ) (Rupicapra rupicapra) or Alpine chamois is a species of goat-antelope native to the mountains in Southern Europe, from the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Apennines, the Dinarides, the Tatra to the Carpathian Mountains, the Balkan Mountains, the Rila–Rhodope massif, Pindus, the northeastern mountains of Turkey, and the Caucasus. It has also been introduced to the South Island of New Zealand. Some subspecies of chamois are strictly protected in the EU under the European Habitats Directive.

==Description==


The chamois is a very small bovid. A fully grown chamois reaches a height of and measures . Males, which weigh , are slightly larger than females, which weigh . Both males and females have short, straightish horns which are hooked backwards near the tip, the horn of the male being thicker. In summer, the fur has a rich brown colour which turns to a light grey in winter. Distinct characteristics are white contrasting marks on the sides of the head with pronounced black stripes below the eyes, a white rump and a black stripe along the back.

==Biology and behaviour==

Female chamois and their young live in herds of up to 15 to 30 individuals; adult males tend to live solitarily for most of the year.

During the rut (late November/early December in Europe, May in New Zealand), males engage in fierce battles for the attention of unmated females. An impregnated female undergoes a gestation period of 170 days, after which a single kid is usually born in May or early June. On rare occasions, twins may be born. If a mother is killed, other females in the herd may try to raise the young.

Kids are weaned at six months of age and are fully grown by one year of age, but do not reach sexual maturity until they are three to four years old, although some females may mate at as early two years old. At sexual maturity, young males are forced out of their mother&#x27;s herds by dominant males (who sometimes kill them), to wander somewhat nomadically until they can establish themselves as mature breeding specimens at eight to nine years of age.

Chamois eat various types of vegetation, including highland grasses and herbs during the summer and conifers, barks and needles from trees in winter. Primarily diurnal in activity, they often rest around mid-day and may actively forage during moonlit nights.

Chamois can reach an age of 22 years in captivity, although the average recorded age in the wild ranges from 15 to 17 years. Common causes of mortality can include avalanches, epidemics and predation. In the past, the principal predators were Eurasian lynxes, Persian leopards and Golden Jackal, gray wolves, and possibly brown bears and golden eagles, but humans are now the main predators of chamois. Chamois usually use speed and stealthy evasion to escape predators and can run at and can jump vertically into the air or over a distance of .

==Distribution and habitat==
The chamois is native to the Pyrenees, the mountains of south and central Europe, Turkey, and the Caucasus. It lives in precipitous, rugged, rocky terrain at moderately high elevations of up to at least . In Europe, the chamois spends the summer months in alpine meadows above the tree line, but moves to elevations of around to spend the winter in pine-dominated forests.

===In New Zealand===
Alpine chamois arrived in New Zealand in 1907 as a gift from the Austrian Emperor, Franz Joseph I in exchange for specimens of living ferns, rare birds and lizards. Albert E. L. Bertling, formerly head keeper of the Zoological Society&#x27;s Gardens, Regent&#x27;s Park, London, accepted an invitation from the New Zealand Government to deliver a consignment of chamois (two bucks and six does) to the colony. They arrived in Wellington, New Zealand, on 23 January 1907, on board SS &quot;Turakina&quot;. From Wellington the chamois were transhipped to the &quot;Manaroa&quot; and conveyed to Lyttelton, then by rail to Fairlie in South Canterbury and a four-day horse trek to Mount Cook. The first surviving releases were made in the Aoraki / Mount Cook region and these animals gradually spread over much of the South Island.

In New Zealand, chamois hunting is unrestricted and even encouraged by the Department of Conservation to limit the animal&#x27;s impact on New Zealand&#x27;s native alpine flora.

New Zealand chamois tend to weigh about 20% less than European individuals of the same age, suggesting that food supplies may be limited.

==Taxonomy==
The species &quot;R. rupicapra&quot; is categorized into seven subspecies:
==Hunting and wildlife management==
As their meat is considered tasty, chamois are popular game animals. Chamois have two traits that are exploited by hunters: the first is that they are most active in the morning and evening when they feed; the second is that they tend to look for danger originating from below, which means that a hunter stalking chamois from above is less likely to be observed and more likely to be successful.

The tuft of hair from the back of the neck, the &quot;gamsbart&quot; (chamois &quot;beard&quot;), is traditionally worn as a decoration on hats throughout the alpine countries.

==Chamois leather==
Chamois leather, traditionally made from the hide of the chamois, is very smooth and absorbent and is favoured in cleaning, buffing, and polishing because it produces no scratching. Modern chamois leather may still be made from chamois hides, but hides of deer or domestic goats or sheep are much more commonly used.

===Chamois fabric===
An artificial fabric known as &quot;chamois&quot; is made variously from cotton flannel, PVA, viscose, and other materials with similar qualities. It is napped to produce a plush surface similar to moleskin or chamois leather.

<doc id="316158" wikidata="Q153500" url="?curid=316158" title="Joseph Radetzky von Radetz">
<text>Johann Josef Wenzel Anton Franz Karl, Graf Radetzky von Radetz (2 November 1766 – 5 January 1858) was a Czech nobleman and Austrian field marshal. He served as chief of the general staff in the Habsburg monarchy during the later period of the Napoleonic Wars and proved instrumental in the allied victory as one of the primary architects of the Trachenberg Plan and the Leipzig Campaign. Afterwards, he embarked on military reforms of the Austrian army. His reputation was one of discipline and fairness; he was revered by his troops among whom he was known as (&#x27;Father&#x27;) Radetzky. He is best known for the victories at the Battles of Custoza (24–25 July 1848) and Novara (23 March 1849) during the First Italian War of Independence. Johann Strauss I&#x27;s &quot;Radetzky March&quot; was commissioned to commemorate Radetzky&#x27;s victories at the Battle of Custoza.

== Early years ==


Radetzky, a titled &quot;Graf&quot; (&#x27;Count&#x27;), was born into a noble Bohemian military family of Czech origin at Chateau Třebnice () near Sedlčany in Bohemia (now part of the town). His father, Count Peter Eusebius Radetzky von Radetz (1732-1766) died shortly after his birth, while his mother, Baroness Marie Venantia Anna Barbara Josepha (1738-1772), died while he was still a child. Orphaned at an early age Radetzky was educated by his grandfather, and after the latter&#x27;s death, he continued at the Theresa Academy in Vienna. The academy was dissolved during his first year&#x27;s residence in 1785, and Radetzky became a cadet in the Austrian Army. The following year he became an officer, and in 1787 was promoted to first lieutenant in a cuirassier regiment. He served as an adjutant to both Count von Lacy and Field Marshal von Laudon during the Austro-Turkish War of 1787–1791, and in the Austrian Netherlands from 1792 to 1795.

In 1798, he married Countess Franziska von Strassoldo-Grafenberg from Tržič, Carniola (now in Slovenia). On her mother&#x27;s side, she was a descendant of the Austrian House of Auersperg, which ruled one of the hereditary Habsburg duchies in what is now Slovenia. They had five sons and three daughters, only two of whom outlived their father. Radetzky also had a longstanding romantic relationship with his Italian mistress, Giuditta Meregalli of Sesto San Giovanni. She was 40 years his junior and bore him four children, all of whom took his name and were recognized by Radetzky. Meregalli received extensive letters from him, written during his battles. He was a devout lifelong Roman Catholic.

== Napoleonic wars ==
In 1795 Radetzky fought on the Rhine. The following year he served with Johann Beaulieu against Napoleon in Italy, but disliked the indecisive &quot;cordon&quot; system of warfare which Count von Lacy had instituted and other Austrian generals imitated. His personal courage was conspicuous. At the Battle of Fleurus (1794) he led a party of cavalry through the French lines to discover the fate of Charleroi, at the Battle of Voltri he was in the thick of the action and roused the troops to victory and at Valeggio sul Mincio in 1796, with a few hussars, he rescued Beaulieu from the enemy. Promoted to major, Radetzky was made head of the pioneer corps, a unit responsible for road and bridge building which he transformed into one of the most elite units in the army. He took part in Dagobert Wurmser&#x27;s Siege of Mantua campaign, which ended in the fall of that fortress. During the four and a half month siege, Radetzky impressed everyone with his determination and defensive tactics, leading sorties and erecting defensive fortifications at San Giorgio and in front of the Tore Ceresa. As lieutenant-colonel and colonel, his unit was expanded and he displayed bravery and skill in the battles of Trebbia and Novi (1799), winning praise from his superiors for his inspiring leadership and quick thinking when leading decisive attacks. At the Battle of Marengo, as colonel on the staff of Melas, he was hit by five bullets, after endeavouring on the previous evening to bring about modifications in the plan suggested by the &quot;scientific&quot; Anton von Zach. He was then transferred to take command of a regiment in Germany where he distinguished himself at the Battle of Hohenlinden. In 1801 Radetzky was made a Knight of the Military Order of Maria Theresa.

In 1805, on the march to Ulm, he received news of his promotion to major-general and his assignment to a command in Italy under the Archduke Charles of Austria. He thus took part in the failed Battle of Caldiero and was highly critical of the way in which the campaign had been conducted (1805). Peace provided a short respite, which he spent in studying and teaching the art of war. In 1809 he distinguished himself in rearguard actions at Abensberg and led a brigade in V Corps during the Battle of Eckmühl. Promoted lieutenant field marshal, he commanded a division in IV Corps at the Battle of Wagram. In 1810 he was created a Commander of the Order of Maria Theresa and became &quot;Inhaber&quot; of the 5th Radetzky Hussars. From 1809 to 1812, as chief of the general staff, he was active in reorganizing the army and its tactical system, but, unable to carry out the reforms he desired owing to the opposition of the Treasury, he resigned his position. In 1813 he was Schwarzenberg&#x27;s chief of staff and had considerable influence on the councils of the Allied sovereigns and generals. Langenau, the quartermaster-general of the Grand Army, found him an indispensable assistant. He was involved in directing the operations that led to the crushing defeat of an entire French corps at the Battle of Kulm and had a considerable share in planning the Leipzig campaign. He won praise for his tactical skills in the battles of Brienne, La Rothière, Arcis-sur-Aube and Fère-Champenoise. He entered Paris with the allied sovereigns in March 1814, and returned with them to the Congress of Vienna, where he appears to have acted as an intermediary between Metternich and Tsar Alexander I of Russia, when the two were not on speaking terms.

== Italian campaigns ==
During the succeeding years of peace he disappeared from public view. He resumed his functions as chief of staff, but his ardent ideas for reforming the army came to nothing in the face of the general war-weariness and desire to &quot;let well enough alone.&quot; His zeal added to the number of his enemies, and in 1829, after twenty years as lieutenant field marshal, it was proposed to place him on the retired list. The emperor, unwilling to go as far as that, promoted him general of cavalry and shelved him by making him governor of a fortress. But very soon afterwards, the Restoration settlement of Europe was shaken by fresh upheavals, and Radetzky was brought back into the field of war again. He took part under Frimont in the campaign against the Papal States insurgents, and succeeded that general in the chief command of the Austrian army in Italy in 1834.

In 1836, Radetzky was promoted to full field marshal. He was then seventy, but still displayed the vigor and zeal of his youth in the training and discipline of the army he commanded. But there too he was in advance of his time, and the government not only disregarded his suggestions and warnings but also refused the military the money that would have enabled the finest army it possessed to take the field at a moment&#x27;s notice. Thus the events of 1848 in Italy, which gave the old field marshal his place in history among the great commanders, found him, in the beginning, not unprepared but seriously handicapped in the struggle with Charles Albert&#x27;s army, and the insurgents in Milan and elsewhere. By falling back to the Quadrilatero and there, rebuffing one opponent after another, he was able to buy time until reinforcements arrived, and thenceforward up to the final triumph at the Battle of Novara on 23 March 1849, he and his army carried all before them. He also commanded the Austrian troops who reconquered Venice after the year-long siege of the rebellious city in May 1848 – August 1849. He became a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1848.

His well-disciplined sense of duty towards officers of higher rank had become more intense in the long years of peace, and, after keeping his army loyal midst the confusion of 1848, he made no attempt to play the part of Wallenstein or even to assume Wellington&#x27;s role of &quot;family adviser to the nation&quot;. While as a patriot he dreamed a little of a united Germany, he remained to the end simply the commander of one of the emperor&#x27;s armies.

After his triumph in Italy, he was made Viceroy of Lombardy–Venetia from 1848 to 1857 – being the only one not of royal Habsburg blood.

Repression in Lombardy–Venetia was severe: The Austrians could act with impunity and little denunciation from the exiled patriots in the rest of Italy, and masking their action as &quot;repression of banditry,&quot; there was little danger of it acquiring international resonance. From 1849, Radetzky introduced public caning as a form of punishment, the death penalty for armed uprising and life sentences for plotting revolutionary activities. The Belfiore martyrs, Luigi Dottesio and Amatore Sciesa were among the many who were executed for treason.

== Death ==

Josef Wenzel Graf Radetzky of Radetz died from pneumonia on 5 January 1858 in Milan. The Emperor wished him to be buried in the Capuchin crypt (the Imperial Crypt in Vienna); however, Radetzky had bequeathed his earthly remains, and the right to bury him, to Joseph Gottfried Pargfrieder, an army supplies merchant and land owner, who decades earlier had settled his debts.

On 19 January 1858, Radetzky was buried at the Heldenberg Memorial site &quot;(Gedenkstätte Heldenberg)&quot; in Lower Austria, an open-air pantheon with warrior statues celebrating the heroes of Austrian military history from Middle Ages to the 19th century (&quot;Heldenberg&quot; literally translates as &quot;Heroes Mountain&quot;). Radetzky lies buried in a crypt under a monumental obelisk in the central part of the pantheon, together with Field Marshal Maximilian von Wimpffen and Pargfrieder himself.

== Legacy ==
In military history Radetzky is highly regarded as a brilliant field marshal, while some social historians consider his role as a viceroy as the point of no return in the troubled relationship between Austria and the Italian population. Radetzky was the namesake of several Austrian and Austro-Hungarian Navy warships, including the screw frigate SMS &quot;Radetzky&quot;&quot;,&quot; which fought Italy in the Third Italian War of Independence, and the SMS &quot;Radetzky&quot;&quot;,&quot; the lead ship of the &quot;Radetzky-&quot;class of pre-dreadnought battleships.

The Radetzky March (German: &quot;Radetzkymarsch&quot;) is a military march composed by Johann Strauss (senior) that was first performed on August 31, 1848, to celebrate the victory of the Austrian Empire under Field Marshal Radetzky von Radetz over Italian forces at the Battle of Custoza.

<text>Nathan-melech ( 7th century BCE) is described as one of Josiah&#x27;s officials in 2 Kings 23:11 of the Hebrew Bible. He lived near the entrance to the temple, close to the courtyard where King Solomon had kept chariot-horses used to worship the Moabite sun-god Chemosh. Josiah eventually disposed of the horses and chariots.

==Archeology==
In March 2019, a clay bulla dated to the middle of the seventh or beginning of the sixth century BC was found in the Givati Parking Lot dig excavation in the City of David area of Jerusalem bearing the Ancient Hebrew inscription, &quot;(belonging) to Nathan-melech, servant of the king&quot;. The wording on the seal was deciphered by Anat Mendel-Geberovich of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Center for the Study of Ancient Jerusalem.

<text>Philip Peter Foglio (born May 1, 1956) is an American cartoonist and comic book artist known for his humorous science fiction and fantasy art.

==Early life and career==
Foglio was born on May 1, 1956, in Mount Vernon, New York, and moved with his family to Hartsdale, New York, where he lived until he was 17. He attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in Chicago, Illinois, and was a member of the university&#x27;s science fiction club, art-directing and co-editing the group&#x27;s fanzine, &quot;Effen Essef&quot;. He was nominated for both the Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1976, and won &quot;Best Fan Artist&quot; in 1977 and 1978. After living in the DePaul dorms for a few years, Phil moved to the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago and hosted weekly Thursday night meetings of Chicago-area science fiction fans. He drew the first known Unix daemons for a limited series of T-shirts in 1979.

Beginning in 1980, Foglio wrote and illustrated the comic strip &quot;What&#x27;s New with Phil &amp; Dixie&quot; for &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; from TSR Games, satirizing the world of role-playing games. The strip ran monthly for three years. In the early 1980s, after some time in Chicago attempting to find work doing science fiction magazine and book illustration, Foglio moved to New York City. He formed the independent comic-book company &quot;&quot; [no capitals] with science-fiction writer-artist Connor Freff Cochran (Freff) and science-fiction book editor Melissa Ann Singer. Working with editorial input from Chris Claremont, Foglio and Freff wrote and drew a single issue of a science-fiction/historical title called &quot;D&#x27;Arc Tangent&quot; before ending their collaboration in 1984.

He eventually returned to the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago and continued fantasy and science-fiction art. For publisher Donning/Starblaze, Foglio illustrated the &quot;MythAdventures&quot; series of fantasy novels by Robert Lynn Asprin, and he later adapted the first book, &quot;Another Fine Myth&quot;, into an eight-issue comic-book series from WaRP Graphics. The WaRP work eventually led to comic-book assignments from DC Comics (&quot;Angel and the Ape&quot;, &quot;Plastic Man&quot; and &quot;Stanley and His Monster&quot; miniseries), Marvel Comics, and First Comics (back-up stories in issues of &quot;Grimjack&quot; and scripting over Doug Rice&#x27;s plots in &quot;Dynamo Joe&quot;). He also joined the Moebius theatre group, and he held regular meetings and poker parties for the local science fiction community.

Foglio initiated his long-running character Buck Godot for the publication &quot;Just Imagine&quot;, published by Denny Meisinger. Basing the humorous science-fiction detective on a real-life friend, John Buckley, Foglio &quot;did a couple of those in the black-and-whites and then Donning said they wanted Buck Godot graphic novels&quot;, two of which followed.

==Later work==

In the 1990s, Foglio met and married his wife, Kaja. The two contributed art to the collectible card game &quot;&quot;, from Wizards of the Coast and resurrected the comic strip &quot;What&#x27;s New with Phil &amp; Dixie&quot; for that company&#x27;s &quot;Duelist&quot; magazine. During this decade, Foglio co-founded Palliard Press and published additional comics, including a new Buck Godot series and the whimsical erotic series &quot;XXXenophile&quot;. The Foglios later founded Studio Foglio and began to produce the steampunk-fantasy series &quot;Girl Genius&quot;.

In April 2005, the Foglios abandoned publishing periodical-style comic books and began publishing &quot;Girl Genius&quot; online as a free webcomic, updated three times a week. Foglio told an interviewer that as of November 2005, &quot;[W]e&#x27;ve quadrupled our number of readers, and tripled our sales&quot; of traditional comics and related merchandise.

==Awards==
In 1976, the slide show &quot;The Capture&quot;, which Robert Asprin wrote and Foglio illustrated, was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation; in the same year, he was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist for the first time. Foglio won the Fan Artist Hugo twice, in 1977 and 1978. He was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist in 2008. He, his wife (Kaja Foglio), and their colorist (Cheyenne Wright) won the first graphic story Hugo for &quot;Girl Genius, Volume 8: Agatha Heterodyne and the Chapel of Bones&quot; in 2009. The three again won the award for subsequent volumes in 2010 and 2011. Having won the Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story in all three of its first three years, Kaja, Phil, and Cheyenne announced that, in order to show that the category was a &quot;viable award&quot; (with quality competitors besides themselves), they were refusing nomination for the following year (2012). Girl Genius was once again nominated for a Hugo in 2014, but did not win.

In 1993, he was awarded the Inkpot Award.

Foglio won a Reuben divisional award from the National Cartoonist Society for Best Online Comics: Long Form for 2022.

<text>Noel Dempsey (born 6 January 1953) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Transport from 2007 to 2011, Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources from 2004 to 2007, Minister for Education and Science from 2002 to 2004, Minister for the Environment and Local Government from 1997 to 2002, Minister of State at the Department of Finance from 1993 to 1994, Minister of State at the Department of Defence and Government Chief Whip from 1992 to 1994. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1987 to 2011.

==Early and private life==
Dempsey was born in Trim, County Meath, in 1953. He is one of twelve sons born and educated locally at Scoil Naomh Brid in Boardsmill and St. Michael&#x27;s CBS in Trim. Dempsey later attended University College Dublin where he was conferred with a Bachelor of Arts degree as well as a diploma in career guidance. He subsequently completed a Higher Diploma in Education at St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth and worked as a career guidance teacher for many years.

Dempsey is married to Bernadette Rattigan and they have four children – two sons and two daughters. He is also a member of the Gaelic Athletic Association and is a keen supporter of the Meath Gaelic football team as well as his local club teams. He has also been a member of Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre.

==Early political career==
Dempsey first became involved in politics in the early 1970s when he joined Ógra Fianna Fáil, the youth wing of Fianna Fáil. He later attended and spoke at the first-ever national conference of Ógra in 1973. Within three years of this Dempsey was co-opted onto Meath County Council as a Fianna Fáil County Councillor in 1977, following the death of John Bird. At the time he was the youngest ever member of that authority and he later served as the youngest ever chairman of the council in 1986. Dempsey enhanced his local political profile at this time by also serving as a member of Trim Urban District Council.

Dempsey was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1987 general election as a Fianna Fáil TD for Meath. Shortly after being elected, he became a member of the Public Accounts Committee, one of the most high-profile committees in the Oireachtas. Dempsey was initially a supporter of the Fianna Fáil leader Charles Haughey; however, he became disillusioned with his leadership when he led Fianna Fáil into coalition with the Progressive Democrats following the 1989 general election. He was one of a number of TDs who were vehemently opposed to such a move. As a result of this Dempsey remained on the backbenches.

In September 1991, Dempsey was a key member of the so-called &quot;gang of four&quot; which proposed a motion of no confidence in Charles Haughey as the leader of the party. The other members of the group were Seán Power, Liam Fitzgerald and M. J. Nolan. Dempsey supported Albert Reynolds in his unsuccessful bid to oust Haughey on that occasion. In 1992, Reynolds eventually became party leader and Taoiseach and Dempsey&#x27;s loyalty was rewarded by being appointed Minister of State with responsibility as government Chief Whip. He also took charge of the Office of Public Works. He served in these positions until the resignation of Reynolds as Taoiseach and the collapse of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party in 1994.

In December 1994, Bertie Ahern became leader of Fianna Fáil as the party moved into opposition. Dempsey was appointed to the front bench as Spokesperson on the Environment and Local Government. During this period in opposition, he was heavily involved in key election strategies, most notably in the Dublin West by-election which was won by Brian Lenihan Jnr. It was Fianna Fáil&#x27;s first by-election victory since 1985.

==Cabinet career: 1997–2011==
===Minister for the Environment and Local Government: 1997–2002===
Following the 1997 general election Dempsey was a key player in helping to negotiate a programme for government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. When Bertie Ahern became Taoiseach Dempsey was appointed to the position of Minister for the Environment and Local Government. His tenure as Minister has been described as one of reform and modernisation, with Frank McDonald of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; even describing Dempsey as the best holder of the environment portfolio since the position was created.

Some of Dempsey&#x27;s major achievements as Minister include the introduction of the Local Government Act 2000 which was seen as the most comprehensive reform of local government in Ireland for over a century. One of his best-known initiatives was the introduction of a levy on plastic shopping bags leading to a reduction in the usage of these bags and a serious decrease in the litter problem related to these plastic bags. Dempsey also proposed to end the &#x27;dual mandate&#x27; whereby a person can serve as a county councillor and hold another elected office at the same time. This proposal, however, led to severe opposition from the Independent TDs who supported the government at the time and had to be deferred. The legislation eventually became law in 2003.

During his tenure as Minister, Dempsey continued to serve as the Fianna Fáil director of elections. His first major success was the election of Mary McAleese to the position of President of Ireland in 1997. Two years later in 1999 he presided over the most successful local election campaign for the party ever.

===Minister for Education and Science: 2002–2004===
Following the re-election of the government in 2002, Dempsey became Minister for Education and Science. He took over as Minister at a time when one of the teachers&#x27; unions was extremely dissatisfied with a number of pay issues. These issues were eventually resolved in 2002 shortly after taking office. As Minister for Education, Dempsey was forced into an embarrassing climb down in 2004 on his proposal to re-introduce third-level fees. The move was opposed by the Union of Students in Ireland and by the Progressive Democrats.

===Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources: 2004–2007===
In a cabinet reshuffle in September 2004, Dempsey was appointed as Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. During his tenure, he oversaw the controversial Corrib gas project. After agreeing to have an independent assessment of the raw gas pipeline planned for Kilcommon, Erris, Dempsey employed a firm to carry it out. Only after the report was concluded did it emerge that the firm was half owned by Royal Dutch Shell, a fact which they neglected to relate to the Minister. An embarrassed Dempsey was forced to hastily commission another report.

Coming to the end of his tenure at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and before the 2007 general election, his department pursued the resurrection of Digital Terrestrial Television following its failure to be established under the Broadcasting Act 2001 due to unfavourable economic conditions for venture capital around the DTT market in many countries in 2001. First, his department invited tenders to build and programme a DTT trial in Dublin and County Louth. The failure seemed to lie around a commercial network builder model and the difficulties in creating revenue generation return for such investment and the solution seems to be the involvement of broadcasters in building the networks. An amended piece of legislation amended this model towards a multiple-operator model and resulted in the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007. A similar model has been successful during the intervening years in the UK and Spain.

To that end his department also established a DTT trial in August 2006 to run for 2 years around Three Rock, Dublin transmitter and Clermont Carn, in County Louth.

===Minister for Transport: 2007–2011===
Following the 2007 general election Dempsey was appointed as Minister for Transport. Among the legislation introduced was the requirement of those on provisional driving licences to be accompanied by a qualified driver, which came into effect on 1 July 2008. Dempsey received widespread criticism across the Irish media over his January 2010 holiday in Malta and perceived lack of contactability when severe weather conditions led to massive disruption across Ireland&#x27;s transport systems.

===Retirement from politics===
On 17 December 2010, he announced that he would not be contesting the 2011 general election. On 19 January 2011, he announced his resignation as Minister for Transport.

Dempsey receives annual pension payments of €119,177.

In August 2020, he attended a golf party in County Galway which breached the COVID-19 guidelines.

<doc id="316165" wikidata="Q981985" url="?curid=316165" title="John O'Donoghue (politician)">
<text>John O&#x27;Donoghue (born 28 May 1956) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 2007 to 2009, Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism from 2002 to 2007, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform from 1997 to 2002 and Minister of State at the Department of Finance from 1991 to 1992. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Kerry South constituency from 1987 to 2011.

==Early and private life==
O&#x27;Donoghue was born in Cork in 1956 but is a native of Cahersiveen, County Kerry. He was educated locally at Cahersiveen CBS and later attended University College Cork (UCC) where he studied law. He graduated from UCC in 1976 with a BCL and in 1977 with a LLB. O&#x27;Donoghue attended the Law Society of Ireland from where he graduated as a solicitor in 1978. He practised as a solicitor in his Cahersiveen before entering political life.

O&#x27;Donoghue is married to Kate Ann Murphy and they have two sons and one daughter. His father-in-law Michael Pat Murphy was a Labour Party TD for Cork South-West from 1951 until 1981.

==Early political career==
O&#x27;Donoghue first became involved in politics in the early 1980s. He first ran for the Dáil as a Fianna Fáil candidate at the 1981 general election, however, despite polling over 3,700 he failed to be elected. O&#x27;Donoghue contested both the February and November general elections in 1982 but, although he increased his vote, he still failed to be elected. Building on his electoral profile O&#x27;Donoghue was elected to Kerry County Council following the 1985 local elections. Both his mother and his father had served on the council before him. He served on that authority until 1997 and was elected chairperson in 1990.

O&#x27;Donoghue was finally elected to the Dáil on his fourth attempt at the 1987 general election. A supporter of the party leader, Charles Haughey, he remained on the backbenches until 1991 when he became Minister of State at the Department of Finance following Albert Reynolds&#x27;s failed attempt to oust Haughey as Taoiseach. In this capacity, O&#x27;Donoghue was in charge of the Office of Public Works. He returned to the backbenches again when Reynolds finally became leader of Fianna Fáil and Taoiseach in February 1992. Two years later Fianna Fáil were back in opposition and Bertie Ahern was the new party leader. O&#x27;Donoghue was appointed to the front bench as spokesperson for Justice. In this capacity, he constantly criticised the incumbent Minister for Justice, Nora Owen of Fine Gael. He demanded &#x27;zero tolerance&#x27; for criminals, and campaigned for harsher sentencing and increased prison places.

==Cabinet career: 1997–2007==
When Fianna Fáil returned to power with the Progressive Democrats following the 1997 general election, O&#x27;Donoghue joined the cabinet as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In this capacity, he was involved in the British-Irish negotiations which led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. 

In 2002, Fianna Fáil again failed to obtain an overall majority and formed a coalition government with the Progressive Democrats. O&#x27;Donoghue, in what was seen as a demotion, was appointed Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. He was involved in the finalisation of details for the rebuilding of Lansdowne Road. In mid-2004, Ahern announced that he would be reshuffling his cabinet in September, prompting speculation over O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s cabinet position, and a possible move to another portfolio. O&#x27;Donoghue, however, retained his post.

==Ceann Comhairle==
Following the 2007 general election, he was elected Ceann Comhairle by 90 votes to 75. O&#x27;Donoghue was nominated for the position by Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern. Labour Party leader Pat Rabbitte said that for the first time in almost 20 years, there would be an alternative and nominated Ruairi Quinn. Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny seconded Quinn&#x27;s nomination but the nomination was not put to a vote. On the evening of Tuesday, 6 October 2009, O&#x27;Donoghue announced his resignation from the post of Ceann Comhairle, effective from the following week.

===Expenses scandal===

Following an investigation in 2009 by Ken Foxe, Public Affairs correspondent with the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot;, a controversy erupted over the amount and nature of O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s spending and expenses. Foxe submitted several Freedom of Information requests that resulted in embarrassing forensic details of O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s expense claims.

During a two-year tenure as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s ministerial expenses amounted to €126,000. The Minister claimed expense claims that involved foreign trips for himself and both his wife and personal secretary. Sinn Féin raised the spending spree with the Dáil, while a Fine Gael spokesperson branded the expense claims as &quot;indulgent&quot;.

In May 2006, O&#x27;Donoghue used the government jet for a six-day journey at the cost of €32,450. O&#x27;Donoghue, accompanied by his wife, attended the Cannes Film Festival. He returned from Cannes to Kerry to attend the opening of new offices for the Fexco company in Killorglin. He then travelled from Kerry to Cardiff for the Heineken Cup final, which Munster won, and travelled back to Cannes by government jet. He went from Cannes to London for a Ryder Cup promotional event, before returning to Dublin on 24 May 2006.

Expenses for car-hire services provided by a London-based firm to O&#x27;Donoghue during four visits to Britain in 2006 and 2007 came to a total of €21,289.57, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act. Documents released to &quot;The Irish Times&quot; showed that three of the four visits were connected with O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s attendance at race meetings in Cheltenham and Ascot.

In 2006, when O&#x27;Donoghue visited Manchester on official business during St Patrick&#x27;s week before attending Cheltenham, car-hire payments made to Terry Gallagher of Cartel Limousines Ltd came to €7,591.96 for &quot;airport pick-ups&quot;. This covered the period 11–13 March. In June 2007, O&#x27;Donoghue attended the Royal Ascot race meeting over four days and Gallagher&#x27;s firm was paid a total of €3,582.22, according to the official receipts.

On 21 August 2009, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; reported that in January 2006 O&#x27;Donoghue spent €472 on a limousine to commute between terminals in London Heathrow Airport despite a free airport service between the terminals existing for passengers. Fine Gael Environment spokesman Phil Hogan further criticised O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s expense claims, labelling them as unjustifiable and inexcusable.

On 31 August 2009, O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s expense claim controversy appeared on the front page of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, revealing how O&#x27;Donoghue received €330,000 in allowances and expenses in addition to his basic TD salary. It was further revealed that O&#x27;Donoghue flew to and from County Kerry at the expense of the taxpayer 73 times, despite having a full-time car driver to his service.

In August 2009, government Minister Dick Roche called upon O&#x27;Donoghue to explain his expense claims. These claims were echoed by opposition TDs including Fine Gael politician Leo Varadkar who called for a &quot;full and Public&quot; explanation, requesting an investigation as to whether O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s expense claims were standard under Fianna Fáil leadership during his tenure as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. In August 2009, Independent TD Jackie Healy-Rae requested a public statement from O&#x27;Donoghue, reiterating the need for O&#x27;Donoghue to defend himself, claiming that &quot;the people want answers&quot;.

In a letter sent to all members of the Dáil on 11 September 2009, O&#x27;Donoghue defended his record as a Minister and as Ceann Comhairle. He said he had stayed silent so far on the issue to protect the impartiality of his current position. He acknowledged that some of the costs incurred appeared high, and regretted that they occurred. He also pointed out that a minister would not be informed of the details of such expenditure and he said he would work to ensure such costs are reduced to the minimum in the future.

Despite the extravagance of the reported expense claims and his delay in addressing the controversy, O&#x27;Donoghue maintained that he acted in &quot;good faith&quot;. O&#x27;Donoghue refused to comment on newspaper articles that revealed indulgent expenditure. In response to O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s letter, Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny called on O&#x27;Donoghue to issue a public apology to the Irish public for the expenses incurred, claiming that the O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s response &quot;did not go far enough&quot;. Fianna Fáil TD Mattie McGrath speaking on Today FM compared O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s actions to that of a &#x27;latter-day prince&#x27;.

In an interview on the RTÉ News: Six One on 14 September 2009, Róisín Shortall of the Labour Party claimed that O&#x27;Donoghue had underestimated the public&#x27;s anger against what she called his &quot;junketeering&quot;. She questioned the nature of O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s statement that failed to address the public, maintaining that it &quot;would be very very&quot; difficult for him to hold his position of Ceann Comhairle.

On 3 October 2009, some hours after the information had been provided to an Irish newspaper under an FOI request, O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s expenses record was released by his office. €45,000 had been spent on internal flights, while a reported €5,000 was claimed for VIP lounge access. Further spending included presents for dignitaries and flights for his wife. Coincidentally, two of O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s trips to Paris took place at the same time as the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe. On 4 October 2009, the full extent of O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s trips to Paris were revealed by several national newspapers. It was reported that in 2007, Mr O&#x27;Donoghue spent two days at the races while his meeting with the French National Assembly only took place while travelling between his hotel and Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. Further spending which was branded as lavish included €1,543 spent on transport over three days and hotel costs over €500 per night. It was widely reported that in total O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s trip cost €6,126.42, which was later claimed as &#x27;expenses&#x27;.

Sinn Féin were the first to call for O&#x27;Donoghue to resign, claiming his position was untenable given &quot;a continued waste of public money&quot; since he took the job. In a debate in the Dáil on 6 October 2009, Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore also said that John O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s position as Ceann Comharile was &quot;untenable&quot;, and that the Labour Party would table a motion of no confidence in him. After the Dáil debate, the Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny issued a statement calling on O&#x27;Donoghue to &quot;resign forthwith&quot; in the interest of the independence of the office of the Ceann Comhairle.

===Resignation===

O&#x27;Donoghue resigned his position of Ceann Comhairle on 13 October 2009. In his resignation statement, O&#x27;Donoghue defended his record in the controversy surrounding his foreign travel expenses, and said he was a scapegoat for an expenses regime that had fallen into disrepute. He stated that his overseas travel spending was not markedly different from other Ministers and he also alleged that Eamon Gilmore&#x27;s call for his resignation in the Dáil on 6 October 2009 had denied him the right to defend his position.

O´Donoghue subsequently took out a defamation case against the newspaper, Kerry&#x27;s Eye over articles alleging that the politician had been forced out of office because of his lavish expenses.

==2011 general election and aftermath==
O&#x27;Donoghue lost his seat in the 2011 general election, to former Fianna Fáil councillor Tom Fleming who ran as an Independent. In his concession speech, O&#x27;Donoghue remarked &quot;I hope that the irony will not be lost upon you that I stand here, on my evening of defeat, in a hall – this magnificent sports complex – which I helped to build&quot;. He received a lump sum of €237,000 and an annual pension of €128,000.

After losing office, he repeatedly signalled his intention to contest the subseequent Irish general election. However, internal party figures dismissed this, with one describing him as &quot;political toast as far as the party is concerned&quot;.

In July 2014, he qualified for the bar, and now practices as a barrister.

<text>The Simple Magnetic Overunity Toy (SMOT) is a 1985 invention by Greg Watson from Australia that claims to show &quot;over-unity&quot; energy — that is, it supposedly produces more energy than it consumes, a perpetual motion machine. It is a type of magnet motor.

==Overview==

In the theoretical SMOT design, a steel ball is pulled up a ramp by an array of permanent magnets. At the top of the ramp it falls, converting magnetic attraction into kinetic energy. A SMOT-like structure is shown in Emil T. Hartman&#x27;s patent. Watson claims that a mechanism called &quot;regauging&quot; happens that allows the cycle to be repeated without the application of outside energy.

Perpetual motion (&quot;over-unity&quot;) has not been achieved with a SMOT. The ball can be cycled from the starting point of one SMOT to the starting point of a second SMOT (and third and fourth), and by arranging multiple SMOT&#x27;s in a circle the ball can be circulated along the SMOT&#x27;s thus giving the illusion of overunity, but the ball can never return to its starting place without adding energy to compensate for frictional losses or for any other energy dissipated by the system.

==Construction==

The SMOT consists of a non-magnetic inclined plane, a series of permanent magnets, a steel ball and a non-magnetic track (e.g. aluminium). Some versions have a pair of long bar magnets in place of the series of permanent magnets. The inclined plane has a very low grade, but still enough to provide a gain in height.

The track is positioned so that it is directly in the center of the inclined plane. Usually, the surface of the track is almost flush with the inclined plane&#x27;s surface. The two permanent magnets are long bar magnets, polarized with their poles being at the long side, that are placed almost parallel to the track, but the poles nearest to the top of the inclined plane are closer to the track than they are at the bottom. The ball moves up the track because the magnetic field is stronger when the magnets are closer to the steel ball and each other, and since the net force is towards the top of the ramp, the motion of the ball is also that direction. This is why it is imperative that the magnets are constantly getting closer to the ball, in order to create a net force upwards. The track serves to keep the ball away from the magnets. If the track is not constructed carefully a slight imbalance can send the steel ball off the track into one of the magnets.

==Analysis of operation==
At the starting point, the ball has the potential energy given it by being put there under the forces of the magnets. When the ball is released, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the ball rolls up the track and drops off the top. The sum of kinetic energy and potential energy is always constant (minus energy lost due to friction). The ball never has more energy than it did when first put into position.

The magnetostatic field produced by any arrangement of stationary permanent magnets is a conservative field of the magnetic scalar potential. This means any magnetic object which moves in a closed-loop path in the field, like the ball in this device, gains no energy from the field, and in the absence of friction ends with the same total energy (kinetic plus potential) it started with. Since any moving object is also subject to friction forces, which dissipate the kinetic energy as it moves, the ball will always end a cycle with less energy than it started with, and will eventually stop moving.

<text>Rainbow Records was a record label based in the United States of America in 1920 which featured recordings of Christian gospel music, hymns, and spirituals.

Rainbow Records were made by the Rodeheaver Record Company of Chicago, Illinois, which in turn was owned by trombonist and composer Homer Rodeheaver.

Rainbow Records were standard lateral-cut &quot;78&quot; double-sided disc records. The audio fidelity is decidedly below average for the era, and all are acoustically recorded. Some seem to have been recorded and pressed by Gennett Records.

<doc id="316175" wikidata="Q212452" url="?curid=316175" title="Popery">
<text>The words Popery (adjective Popish) and Papism (adjective Papist, also used to refer to an individual) are mainly historical pejorative words in the English language for Roman Catholicism, once frequently used by Protestants and Eastern Orthodox Christians to label their Roman Catholic opponents, who differed from them in accepting the authority of the Pope over the Christian Church. The words were popularised during the English Reformation (1532–1559), when the Church of England broke away from the Roman Catholic Church and divisions emerged between those who rejected papal authority and those who continued to follow Rome. The words are recognised as pejorative; they have been in widespread use in Protestant writings until the mid-nineteenth century, including use in some laws that remain in force in the United Kingdom.

&quot;Popery&quot; and &quot;Papism&quot; are sometimes used in modern writing as dog whistles for anti-Catholicism or they are used as pejorative ways of distinguishing Roman Catholicism from other forms of Christianity that refer to themselves as &quot;Catholic&quot;, such as Eastern Orthodoxy, Lutherans of Evangelical Catholic churchmanship or Anglicans of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship. Papist was used in the latter way in 2008 by the Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki at a conference opposing ecumenism, and the word sees some wider use in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

== History ==

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;Papist&quot; was first used in 1528.

The word was in common use by Protestant writers until the mid-nineteenth century, as shown by its frequent appearance in Thomas Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;History of England from the Accession of James II&quot; and in other works of that period, including those with no sectarian bias.

The word is found in certain surviving statutes of the United Kingdom, for example in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 and the Scottish Claim of Right of 1689. Catholics have been excluded from the British throne for centuries. In 1701, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement, which requires that only a Protestant monarch could rule over England and Ireland. Under the Act of Settlement of 1701, no one who professes &quot;the popish religion&quot; may succeed to the throne of the Kingdom of England and the Act continues to apply to the United Kingdom and all of the Commonwealth Realms; until the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 amended it with effect from 2015, the Act of Settlement also banned from the throne anyone who married &quot;a papist&quot;. Fears that Roman Catholic secular leaders would be anti-Protestant and would be unduly influenced from Rome arose after all allegiance to the Pope was banned in England in the reigns of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. 
Jonathan Swift (1667–1745), the author of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, employed the term in his satirical essay &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;, in which he proposed selling Irish babies to be eaten by wealthy English landlords. Daniel Defoe wrote in the popular &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1719), near the end of the novel: &quot;[...] I began to regret having professed myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the best religion to die with.&quot;

Similar terms, such as the traditional &quot;popery&quot; and the more recent &quot;papalism&quot;, are sometimes used, as in the Popery Act 1698 and the Irish Popery Act. The Seventh-day Adventist prophetess Ellen G. White used the terms &quot;papist&quot; and &quot;popery&quot; throughout her book &quot;The Great Controversy&quot;, a volume harshly criticized for its anti-Catholic tone.

During the American presidential election of 1928, the Democratic nominee Al Smith was labeled a &quot;papist&quot; by his political opponents. He was the first Roman Catholic ever to gain the presidential nomination of a major party, and this led to fears that, if he were elected, the United States government would follow the dictates of the Vatican. , John F. Kennedy and Joe Biden are the only Roman Catholics to have been elected President of the United States.

The term is still sometimes used today, although much less often than in earlier centuries.

==Crypto-Papism==

In early use the term appeared in the compound form &quot;Crypto-Papist&quot;, referring to members of Reformed, Protestant, or nonconformist churches who at heart were allegedly Roman Catholics. Alexis Khomiakhov, a Russian lay theologian of the nineteenth century, claimed that &quot;All Protestants are Crypto-Papists&quot;.

Although the term has been used as a means of attacking Protestants with high church sympathies, such as William Laud and John Spottiswoode, at other times there have been individuals who have secretly converted to Catholicism, for example, James II of England, Bartholomew Remov and Yelizaveta Fyodorovich. Some people may later on openly convert, such as George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, or secretly convert with reservations, such as John III of Sweden.

<text>The Heritage Foundation (sometimes referred to simply as &quot;Heritage&quot;) is an American conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1973, it took a leading role in the conservative movement in the 1980s during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, whose policies were taken from Heritage Foundation studies, including its &quot;Mandate for Leadership&quot;.

The Heritage Foundation has had significant influence in U.S. public policy making, and has historically been ranked among the most influential public policy organizations in the United States. In 2010, it founded a sister organization, Heritage Action, an influential activist force in conservative and Republican politics.

Heritage leads the 2025 Presidential Transition Project, also known as Project 2025, an extensive plan that includes appointing ideologically aligned civil servants, restricting abortion access, opposing LGBTQ+ rights, transforming federal agencies for political purposes, and imposing strict immigration policies. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported The Heritage Foundation posted misinformation about the 2024 US election and crafted faked videos claiming that noncitizens would rig the election.

==History==
===Early years===

The Heritage Foundation was founded on February 16, 1973, during the Nixon administration by Paul Weyrich, Edwin Feulner, and Joseph Coors. Growing out of the new business activist movement inspired by the Powell Memorandum, discontent with Richard Nixon&#x27;s embrace of the liberal consensus, and the nonpolemical, cautious nature of existing think tanks, Weyrich and Feulner sought to create a conservative version of the Brookings Institution that advanced conservative policies. In its early years, Coors was the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s primary funding source. Weyrich was the foundation&#x27;s first president. Later, under Weyrich&#x27;s successor, Frank J. Walton, the Heritage Foundation began using direct mail fundraising, which contributed to the growth of its annual income, which reached $1 million a year in 1976. By 1981, the annual budget grew to $5.3 million.

The Heritage Foundation advocated for pro-business policies and anti-communism in its early years, but distinguished itself from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) by also advocating for cultural issues that were important to Christian conservatives&quot;. But throughout the 1970s, the Heritage Foundation remained small relative to Brookings and AEI.

===Reagan administration===
In January 1981, the Heritage Foundation published &quot;Mandate for Leadership&quot;, a comprehensive report aimed at reducing the size of the federal government. It provided public policy guidance to the incoming Reagan administration, and included over 2,000 specific policy recommendations on how the Reagan administration could utilize the federal government to advance conservative policies. The report was well received by the White House, and several of its authors went on to take positions in the Reagan administration. Ronald Reagan liked the ideas so much that he gave a copy to each member of his cabinet to review. Among the 2,000 Heritage proposals, approximately 60% of them were implemented or initiated by the end of Reagan&#x27;s first year in office. Reagan later called the Heritage Foundation a &quot;vital force&quot; during his presidency.

The Heritage Foundation was influential in developing and advancing the Reagan Doctrine, a key Reagan administration foreign policy initiative under which the U.S. began providing military and other support to anti-communist resistance movements fighting Soviet-aligned governments in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Nicaragua, and other nations during the final years of the Cold War.

When Reagan met with Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow in the 1980s, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; later reported, &quot;the Soviet leader offered a complaint: Reagan was influenced by the Heritage Foundation, Washington’s conservative think tank. The outfit lent intellectual energy to the Gipper’s agenda, including the Reagan Doctrine—the idea that America should support insurgents resisting communist domination.&quot;

The Heritage Foundation also supported the development of a new ballistic missile defense system for the United States. In 1983, Reagan made the development of this new defense system, known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, his top defense priority.

By mid-decade, the Heritage Foundation had begun emerging as a key organization in the national conservative movement, publishing influential reports on a broad range of policy issues by prominent conservative thought leaders. In 1986, in recognition of the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s fast-growing influence, &quot;Time&quot; magazine labeled the Heritage Foundation &quot;the foremost of the new breed of advocacy tanks&quot;. During the Reagan and subsequent George H. W. Bush administrations, the Heritage Foundation served as the brain trust on foreign policy to both administrations.

===George H. W. Bush administration===
The Heritage Foundation remained an influential voice on domestic and foreign policy issues during President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s administration. In 1990 and 1991, the foundation was a leading proponent of Operation Desert Storm designed to liberate Kuwait following Saddam Hussein&#x27;s invasion and occupation of Kuwait in August 1990. According to &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; Washington bureau chief Frank Starr, the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s studies &quot;laid much of the groundwork for Bush administration thinking&quot; about post-Soviet foreign policy. In domestic policy, the Bush administration agreed with six of the ten budget reform proposals the Heritage Foundation proposed in its &quot;Mandate for Leadership III&quot; book, which the administration included in its 1990 budget proposal.

===Clinton administration===
The Heritage Foundation continued to grow throughout the 1990s. The foundation&#x27;s flagship journal, &quot;Policy Review&quot;, reached a circulation of 23,000. In 1993, Heritage was an opponent of the Clinton health care plan, which died in the U.S. Senate the following year, in August 1994.

In the 1994 Congressional elections, Republicans took control of the House of Representatives, and Newt Gingrich was elected as the new House Speaker in January 1995, largely based on commitments made in the Contract with America, which was issued six weeks prior to the 1994 elections. The Contract was a pact of principles that directly challenged the political status quo in Washington, D.C. and many of the ideas at the heart of the Clinton administration.

The Heritage Foundation also became engaged in the culture wars, publishing &quot;The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators&quot; by William Bennett in 1994. The &quot;Index&quot; documented how crime, illegitimacy, divorce, teenage suicide, drug use, and fourteen other social indicators had worsened measurably since the 1960s.

In 1995, the Heritage Foundation published its first &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot;, an annual publication that assesses the state of economic freedom in every country in the world; two years later, in 1997, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; joined the project as a co-manager and co-author of the annual publication.

In 1996, Clinton aligned some of his welfare reforms with the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s recommendations, incorporating them into the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act.

===George W. Bush administration===
Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Heritage Foundation supported the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in the war on terror. The Heritage Foundation challenged opposition to the war. They defended the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s treatment of suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in 2005 that the Heritage Foundation softened its criticism of the Malaysian government after Heritage Foundation president Edwin Feulner initiated a business relationship with Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. &quot;Heritage&#x27;s new, pro-Malaysian outlook emerged at the same time a Hong Kong consulting firm co-founded by Edwin J. Feulner, Heritage&#x27;s president, began representing Malaysian business interests&quot; through his relationship with Belle Haven Consultants. The Heritage Foundation denied a conflict of interest, saying that its views on Malaysia changed following the country&#x27;s cooperation with the U.S. after the September 11 attacks, and the Malaysian government &quot;moving in the right economic and political direction.&quot;

===Obama administration===

In March 2010, the Obama administration introduced a health insurance mandate in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. This was an idea the Heritage Foundation initially developed and supported in &quot;Assuring Affordable Health Care for All Americans&quot;, a study the foundation released on October 1, 1989. The mandate proposed in the Heritage Foundation study previously had been incorporated into Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney&#x27;s health care plan for Massachusetts in 2006, commonly referred to as Romneycare. The Heritage Foundation opposed the Affordable Care Act.

Partly inspired by the model of the Center for American Progress Action Fund on the progressive side, in April 2010, Heritage Action launched as a sister 501(c)4 organization to expand Heritage&#x27;s reach. The new group quickly became influential.

In July 2011, the Heritage Foundation released a study on poverty in the United States. The study was criticized by &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, the Center for American Progress, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

In December 2012, Jim DeMint, then a U.S. Senator representing South Carolina, announced that he intended to resign from the Senate to head the Heritage Foundation. As Heritage Foundation president, DeMint was paid $1 million annually, making him the highest paid think tank president in Washington, D.C. at the time.

Some pundits predicted that DeMint would bring a sharper, more politicized edge to the Heritage Foundation. DeMint led changes to the historical process that the foundation had utilized for publishing policy papers under which policy experts authored policy papers that were then reviewed by senior departmental staff. Under DeMint, however, his team heavily edited policy papers and sometimes shelved them entirely. In response to DeMint&#x27;s new practice, several scholars at the foundation quit.

In May 2013, Jason Richwine, who co-authored a controversial Heritage Foundation report on the costs of amnesty for migrants, resigned his position following intensive media scrutiny to his Harvard University Ph.D. thesis, authored four years earlier, in 2009, and comments he made at an American Enterprise Institute forum in 2008. Richwine argued that Hispanics and Blacks are intellectually inferior to Whites and have trouble assimilating because of a supposed genetic predisposition to lower IQ.

The same year, in 2013, a Heritage Foundation study co-authored by senior fellow Richwine and Robert Rector was widely criticized across the political spectrum for methodology the two used in criticizing immigration reform legislation. &quot;Reason&quot; magazine and the Cato Institute criticized the report for failing to employ dynamic scoring, which Heritage previously incorporated in analyzing other policy proposals. The study was also criticized because of Richwine&#x27;s 2009 doctoral dissertation that concluded that immigrants&#x27; IQs should be considered when crafting public policy.

In July 2013, following disputes with the Heritage Foundation over the farm bill, the Republican Study Committee, which then included 172 conservative U.S. House members, reversed a decades-old tradition and barred Heritage employees from attending its weekly meeting in the U.S. Capitol, though it continued cooperating with the foundation through &quot;regular joint events and briefings&quot;.

====2015 cyberattack====
In September 2015, the Heritage Foundation announced that it had been targeted by hackers, which resulted in donors&#x27; information being taken. &quot;The Hill&quot;, a Washington, D.C.–based newspaper covering politics, compared the hacking to the cyberattack against the United States Office of Personnel Management a few months earlier by China&#x27;s Jiangsu State Security Department, a subsidiary the Ministry of State Security spy agency, that accessed security clearance information on millions of federal government employees. The Heritage Foundation released no further information about the September 2015 hacking.

===2016 Trump candidacy===
In June 2015, Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. In July 2015, appearing on a Fox News panel, the leader of Heritage Action, the foundation&#x27;s advocacy arm, said, &quot;Donald Trump&#x27;s a clown. He needs to be out of the race.&quot;

The following month, in August, a Heritage Foundation economic writer, Stephen Moore, criticized Trump&#x27;s policy positions, saying, &quot;the problem for Trump is that he’s full of all of these contradictions. He’s kind of a tabula rasa on policy.&quot; In December 2015, then Heritage Foundation executive vice president Kim Holmes, opposing Trump&#x27;s candidacy, criticized Trump as &quot;not a conservative.&quot; Holmes also criticized Trump supporters, writing that, &quot;they are behaving more like an alienated class of Marxist imagination than as social agents of stability and tradition. They are indeed thinking like revolutionaries, only now their ire is aimed at their progressive masters and the institutions they control,&quot; he wrote. Then Heritage president Jim DeMint &quot;praised both Rubio and Cruz, but said that he couldn’t &#x27;make a recommendation coming from Heritage&#x27;.&quot;

After Trump secured the Republican nomination and as the 2016 general election approached, the Heritage Foundation began emailing potential political appointees in the event Trump won the general election. &quot;I need to assess your interest in serving as a presidential appointee in an administration that will promote conservative principles,&quot; the email said. It asked that questionnaires and a resume or bio be returned to them by October 26, roughly a week prior to the general election.

===First Trump administration===
Following Trump&#x27;s victory in the 2016 presidential election, the Heritage Foundation obtained influence in his presidential transition and administration. The foundation had a say in the staffing of the administration; CNN reported during the transition that &quot;no other Washington institution has that kind of footprint in the transition.&quot; One reason for the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s disproportionate influence relative to other conservative think tanks, CNN reported, was that other conservative think tanks had &quot;Never Trump&quot; staff during the 2016 presidential election, while the Heritage Foundation ultimately signaled that it would be supportive of him.

Drawing from a database that the Heritage Foundation began building in 2014 of approximately 3,000 conservatives who they trusted to serve in a hypothetical Republican administration, at least 66 foundation employees and alumni were hired into the Trump administration. According to Heritage employees involved in developing the database, several hundred people from the Heritage database ultimately received jobs in government agencies, including Betsy DeVos, Mick Mulvaney, Rick Perry, Scott Pruitt, Jeff Sessions, and others who became members of Trump&#x27;s cabinet. Jim DeMint, president of the Heritage Foundation from 2013 to 2017, personally intervened on behalf of Mulvaney, who was appointed to head the Office of Management and Budget and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and later served as Trump&#x27;s acting White House chief of staff.

In May 2017, the foundation&#x27;s board of trustees voted unanimously to terminate DeMint as its president. In a public statement, the board said that a thorough investigation of the foundation&#x27;s operations under DeMint found &quot;significant and worsening management issues that led to a breakdown of internal communications and cooperation.&quot; &quot;While the organization has seen many successes,&quot; the board said, &quot;Jim DeMint and a handful of his closest advisers failed to resolve these problems.&quot; DeMint&#x27;s firing was praised by some, including former U.S. congressman Mickey Edwards (R-OK), who said he saw it as a step by the foundation to pare back its partisan edge and restore its reputation as a pioneering think tank. In January 2018, DeMint was succeeded by Kay Coles James as the foundation&#x27;s president. The same month, Heritage claimed the Trump administration had by then embraced 64%, or nearly 2/3rds, of 334 proposed policies in the foundation&#x27;s agenda.

=== Biden administration ===
In February 2021, after Trump lost re-election, the Heritage Foundation hired three former Trump administration officials, Ken Cuccinelli, Mark A. Morgan, and Chad Wolf, who held various roles in immigration-related functions in the Trump administration. Cuccinelli and Wolf authored several publications in 2021 before leaving the foundation.

At the same time, Heritage also hired former U.S. vice president Mike Pence as a distinguished visiting fellow. The following month, in March 2021, Pence authored and published an op-ed column on a Heritage Foundation website that made false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, including numerous false claims about the For the People Act, a Democrat-supported bill to expand voting rights. Pence&#x27;s false claims drew criticism and corrections from multiple media outlets and fact-checking organizations. Pence left the foundation in 2022.

The Heritage Foundation&#x27;s positions and management under Kay Coles James drew criticism from conservatives and Trump allies, which intensified in 2020 and 2021. &quot;In the early days of the pandemic in spring 2020, Heritage leadership under James rejected an article from one of its scholars denouncing government restrictions, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The foundation&#x27;s offices stayed closed for about three months, and signs urging masking became something of a joke for many conservatives who mocked the concept&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in February 2022. Conservatives also began commenting publicly that the Heritage Foundation had lost the significant intellectual and political clout that led to the foundation&#x27;s ascent in the 1980s and 1990s. &quot;People do not walk around in fear of the Heritage Foundation the way they did 10 years ago,&quot; one conservative told &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. In March 2021, in response to mounting criticism of her leadership of the foundation, James resigned from the foundation.

In October 2021, the Heritage Foundation announced James would be replaced by Kevin Roberts, who previously led a state-based think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, and participated as a member of Texas Governor Greg Abbott&#x27;s COVID-19 task force. Roberts stated that he saw the role of Heritage as &quot;institutionalizing Trumpism.&quot;

Beginning incrementally in 2022, the Heritage Foundation began publicly embracing national conservatism as its guiding ideology.

In May 2022, the Heritage Foundation completely reversed its position supporting military aid to Ukraine in its attempt to repel the Russian invasion of the nation, which it had previously supported. Following the reversal of its position on military aid to Ukraine, the foundation claimed, &quot;Ukraine Aid Package Puts America Last&quot;. In September 2022, the foundation&#x27;s foreign policy director said the foundation ordered him to retract his earlier statements supporting aid to Ukraine; he subsequently left the organization. In August 2023, Thomas Spoehr, the foundation&#x27;s Center for National Defense director, resigned his position over the dramatic policy change.

In September 2022, one Heritage employee said he had been &quot;required by management to remove a Twitter post condemning the January 6 United States Capitol attack.&quot;

In March 2023, the Heritage Foundation established a cooperative relationship with the Danube Institute, a Budapest-based state-funded think tank founded in 2013.

In May 2024, the Heritage Foundation donated $100,000 to the American Accountability Foundation (AAF) to produce a website which publishes personal information of career civil servants, who AAF describes as &quot;America&#x27;s Most Subversive Immigration Bureaucrats&quot;, including photographs, small-dollar political donations, and screenshots of personal social media accounts.

On July 12, 2024, Heritage stated a conspiracy theory that Biden could attempt to remain in office following the 2024 election by force (which ultimately did not occur despite Trump winning the election, with Biden withdrawing from the election 9 days later on July 21,) and that the 2024 election was illegitimate in advance.

==Activities==
The Heritage Foundation has historically ranked among the world&#x27;s most influential think tanks, influencing concrete policies, media, and political discourse in general. In 2020, the &quot;Global Go To Think Tank Index Report&quot;, published by the University of Pennsylvania, ranked the foundation sixth on its list of &quot;top ten think tanks in the United States&quot;, 13th among think tanks globally, and first in its category of think tanks having the most significant impact on public policy between 2017 and 2019.

===Policy Review===

From its 1973 founding through 2001, the Heritage Foundation published &quot;Policy Review&quot;, a public policy journal and its flagship publication; the journal was acquired by the Hoover Institution in 2001.

===Mandate for Leadership===

In 1981, the Heritage Foundation published &quot;Mandate for Leadership&quot;, which offered specific policy recommendations on policy, budget, and administrative action for the incoming Reagan administration. Ten additional editions of &quot;Mandate for Leadership&quot; have been published since.

===Asian Studies Center===

In 1983, the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s founded The Heritage Foundation&#x27;s Asian Studies Center, which publishes research studies and commentary on Asia and the Pacific Rim and U.S. policy toward the region. The center also has hosted Asia-specific lectures by Henry Kissinger (1995), Donald Rumsfeld (1988), Paul Wolfowitz (2000), Henry Paulson (2007), and others.

===State Policy Network===

The Heritage Foundation is an associate member of the State Policy Network, founded in 1992, a network of conservative and libertarian organizations financed by the Koch brothers, Philip Morris, and other corporate sources.

===Index of Economic Freedom===

Since 1995, the Heritage Foundation has published &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot;, an annual publication that measures countries&#x27; state of economic freedom, using property rights, freedom from government regulation, corruption in government, barriers to international trade, income tax and corporate tax rates, government expenditures, rule of law and the ability to enforce contracts, regulatory burdens, banking restrictions, labor regulations, and black market activities as key metrics.

In 1997, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; began partnering with Heritage as co-manager and co-editor of the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot;. In 2014, Charles W. L. Hill, a professor at the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington, criticized the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot;, writing that, &quot;given that the Heritage Foundation has a political agenda, its work should be viewed with caution.&quot;

===2012 Republican presidential debate===

In November 2011, the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) co-hosted a debate among the candidates for the 2012 Republican 2012 presidential election on foreign policy and national defense issues, which was televised by CNN and was the first presidential debate hosted by Heritage or AEI. Heritage fellows Edwin Meese and David Addington were among the debate&#x27;s moderators. Following the debate, political commentator Michael Barone wrote in &quot;The Washington Examiner&quot; that it was &quot;probably the most substantive and serious presidential debate of this election cycle.&quot;.

===The Daily Signal===

In June 2014, the Heritage Foundation phased out its blog, The Foundry, replacing it with The Daily Signal, a news and conservative commentary website.

In June 2024, &quot;The Signal&quot; became an independent publication with its own board of directors and leadership.

===Project 2025===
=== Project Esther ===

Project Esther is an effort by the Heritage Foundation to suppress what the group claims is antisemitism. It has been criticized by journalist Steve Rabey for actually incorporating antisemitic tropes into its own rhetoric, and for failing to address right-wing antisemitism.

===Other initiatives===
====Publications====
The Heritage Foundation publishes &quot;The Insider&quot;, a quarterly magazine about public policy. From 1995 to 2005, the Heritage Foundation ran Townhall, a conservative website that was subsequently acquired by Salem Communications.

====Index of Dependence====
Beginning in 2002, the Heritage Foundation began publishing &quot;Index of Dependence&quot;, an annual report on federal government programs in five areas: housing, health care and welfare, retirement, higher education, and rural and agricultural services that, in its view, constrain private sector or local government alternatives and impact the dependence of individuals on the federal government. The 2010 edition of the &quot;Index of Dependence&quot; concluded that the number of Americans who pay nothing in federal personal income taxes and the number who rely on government services have both increased measurably, and that, over the prior eight years, Americans&#x27; dependence on government had grown by almost 33 percent. In February 2012, the foundation&#x27;s conclusions were challenged by Rex Nutting of MarketWatch, who wrote that the report was &quot;misleading&quot; and &quot;alarmist&quot;, that the percentage of Americans &quot;dependent&quot; upon government had remained essentially the same as it was in the 1980s, and that a small increase was attributable to the Great Recession and an aging population with proportionally more retirees.

====Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom====
In September 2005, the Heritage Foundation established the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom named in honor of the former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Thatcher maintained a long-standing relationship with the Heritage Foundation. In September 1991, shortly after Thatcher left office, the foundation hosted a dinner in Thatcher&#x27;s honor. Six years later, in 1997, Thatcher delivered the keynote address at Heritage&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebration. In 2002, Thatcher was again honored by the foundation, which awarded her with its annual Clare Boothe Luce Award.

====Oversight Project====

The Heritage Foundation&#x27;s Oversight Project started in 2022, which they have described as &quot;investigating and exposing the Biden administration&quot;.

The Oversight Project files large numbers of FOIA information requests to government agencies. In a late 2024 interview, project director Mike Howell estimated it had filed 50,000 requests in two years. A ProPublica analysis showed many requests sought the names of employees who have used certain conservative hot-button keywords in communications, such as &quot;climate equity&quot; and &quot;DEI&quot; (diversity, equity, and inclusion). They also asked for communications with civil rights and voting rights organizations, and the names of all Biden administration appointees. 

In May 2024, the Oversight Project publicized a faked flier to falsely accuse an immigration-assistance NGO of encouraging illegal voting. The social media posts were widely disseminated, and the head of the NGO received threats. The head of the Oversight Project said they had not tried to verify the flier. The Oversight Project was the publisher of a2024 misleading video falsely asserting 14% of non-citizens in Georgia were registered to vote.

In January 2025, leaked documents from the Oversight Project detailed a plan to dox Wikipedia editors alleged to be antisemitic using techniques such as facial recognition software, cross-referencing to a database of hacked information, tricking Wikipedia users into visiting websites that harvest IP addresses, and creating sock puppet accounts. Journalist Stephen Harrison compared the plan to the 2021 doxing by pro-Chinese government editors, which led to some Hong Kong editors to being physically harmed.

==Positions==
=== Race ===
In 2021, the Heritage Foundation said that one of its two priorities, along with tightening voting laws, was to push Republican-controlled states to ban or restrict critical race theory instruction. The Heritage Foundation sought to get Republicans in Congress to put anti-critical race theory provisions into must-pass legislation such as the annual defense spending bill.

In September 2021, a Heritage Foundation senior fellow, Mike Gonzalez, released a book, &quot;BLM: The New Making of a Marxist Revolution&quot;, which characterizes Black Lives Matter as &quot;a nationwide insurgency&quot; and labels its leaders &quot;avowed Marxists who say they want to dismantle our way of life&quot;.

=== Climate change denial ===
The Heritage Foundation rejects the scientifically proven consensus on climate change. The foundation is one of many climate change denial organizations that have been funded by ExxonMobil, an oil and petroleum company that is the eighth-largest corporation in the world with over $413 billion in revenue as of 2022.

The Heritage Foundation strongly criticized the December 1997 Kyoto Agreement to curb climate change, arguing that American participation in the treaty would &quot;result in lower economic growth in every state and nearly every sector of the economy&quot;. The foundation projected that the 2009 cap-and-trade bill, the American Clean Energy and Security Act, would result in a cost of $1,870 per family in 2025 and $6,800 by 2035, which varied greatly from those of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which projected that it would cost the average family $175 in 2020.

===LGBT rights opposition===
In 2013, a Heritage Foundation panel denounced the Boy Scouts of America organization&#x27;s proposal to allow membership for gay boy scouts, but not gay scout leaders. Heritage&#x27;s panelists variously argued that the proposal, if implemented, would be a &quot;fatal concession&quot; that would lead to &quot;increased boy on boy contact&quot;, &quot;moral confusion&quot;, and damage to &quot;understanding of fatherhood&quot; or &quot;character formation&quot;.

The Heritage Foundation has controversially opposed gay marriage, including both the 2015 &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; decision by the Supreme Court, and the 2022 Respect for Marriage Act. Ahead of the &quot;Obergefell&quot; ruling, Heritage&#x27;s Ryan T. Anderson argued that gay acceptance is linked to single motherhood, sexual permissiveness, and reformed divorce laws. He added that the issue should be left to the states, but that the states should not legalize gay marriage either. Arguing against the 2022 Respect for Marriage Act, Heritage&#x27;s Roger Severino stated: &quot;Marriage is the exclusive, lifelong, conjugal union between one man and one woman, and any departure from that design hurts the indispensable goal of having every child raised in a stable home by the mom and dad who conceived him.&quot; In 2010, the Heritage Foundation also conducted meetings, which included social researchers opposed to gay marriage, which reportedly helped lead to the publication of the controversial New Family Structures Study.

The group has engaged in several activities in opposition to transgender rights, including hosting several anti-transgender rights events, developing and supporting legislation templates against transgender rights, and making claims about transgender youth healthcare and suicide rates based on internal research, which are contradicted by numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies. The Heritage Foundation-led initiative Project 2025 proposed LGBT-related policies, including the limiting of LGBT anti-discrimination protections, and a ban on transgender people from the military.

=== Ukraine ===
In May 2022, Heritage Action, the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s political activism organization, announced its opposition to the $40 billion military aid package for Ukraine passed that month following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, completely reversing the organization&#x27;s previous position of support for such aid. The Heritage Foundation&#x27;s foreign policy director at the time, Luke Coffey, said he was ordered to retract his earlier statements supporting aid to Ukraine; he subsequently left the foundation.

In August 2023, newly installed Heritage president Kevin Roberts stated in an op-ed column that Congress was holding victims of the 2023 Hawaii wildfires hostage &quot;in order to spend more money in Ukraine&quot;. The op-ed was followed by a public messaging campaign with the same message and with a tweet by a Heritage vice president, who argued, &quot;It&#x27;s time to end the blank, undated checks for Ukraine.&quot; This, in turn, led the foundation&#x27;s second senior official, Lt. Gen. (Ret) Thomas Spoehr, director of Heritage&#x27;s Center for National Defense, to submit his resignation.

===Voter fraud claims===
The Heritage Foundation has promoted false claims of electoral fraud. Hans von Spakovsky, who heads the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s Election Law Reform Initiative, has played an influential role in elevating alarmism about voter fraud in the Republican Party, despite offering no evidence of widespread voter fraud. His work, which claims voting fraud is rampant, has been discredited.

Following the 2020 presidential election, in which President Donald Trump made baseless claims of fraud after he was defeated for reelection, the Heritage Foundation launched a campaign in support of Republican efforts to make state voting laws more restrictive.

In March 2021, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s political arm, Heritage Action, planned to spend $24 million over two years across eight key states to support efforts to restrict voting, in coordination with the Republican Party and allied conservative outside groups, including the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, American Legislative Exchange Council, and State Policy Network. Almost two dozen election bills introduced by Republican state legislators in early 2021 were based on a Heritage letter and report. Heritage also mobilized in opposition to H.R. 1./S. 1, a Democratic bill to establish uniform nationwide voting standards, including expanded early and postal voting, automatic and same-day voter registration, campaign finance law reforms, and prohibiting partisan redistricting.

In May 2021, Heritage Action spent $750,000 on television ads in Arizona to promote the false claim that &quot;Democrats...want to register illegal aliens&quot; to vote, even though the Democrats&#x27; legislation creates safeguards to ensure that ineligible people cannot register. In April 2021, Heritage Action boasted to its private donors that it had successfully crafted the election reform bills that Republican state legislators introduced in Georgia and other states.

On January 21, 2024, after three years of silence on Trump&#x27;s position that Biden was an illegitimate president and that Trump actually won the 2020 election, Lulu Garcia-Navarro, a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, presented the question to Heritage president Kevin Roberts: &quot;Do you believe that President Biden won the 2020 election?&quot; &quot;No&quot;, Roberts replied.
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in September 2024 that &quot;the notion that [noncitizens] will flood the polls—and vote overwhelmingly for Democrats—is animating a sprawling network of Republicans who mobilized around&quot; Trump after he claimed the 2020 election was rigged, and &quot;the false theories about widespread noncitizen voting could be used to dispute the outcome again.&quot; In summer 2024, the Heritage Oversight Project produced videos for distribution on social media and conservative media outlets that made false or misleading claims about the extent of noncitizen voting registrations. In one video that was sent viral by an Elon Musk repost, Heritage falsely claimed that 14% of noncitizens in Georgia were registered, concluding, &quot;the integrity of the 2024 election is in great jeopardy.&quot; Heritage based their findings on an extrapolation of hidden camera interview responses from seven residents in a Norcross, Georgia apartment complex. State investigators found the seven people had never registered. Heritage maintains an election fraud database that in 2024 showed just 68 documented instances of noncitizen voting since the 1980s, and just 10 of those were in the country illegally. When Heritage president Kevin Roberts was presented in June 2024 with data from the Heritage database indicating there were only 1,513 total instances of voter fraud in the United States since 1982, he responded that fraud is &quot;very hard to document, and the Democrat party is very good at fraud.&quot; When asked if Heritage would accept the results of the 2024 presidential election regardless of who wins, Roberts replied, &quot;yes, if there isn&#x27;t massive fraud like there was in 2020.&quot; Despite the persistence of an election denial movement, no evidence of material election fraud in 2020 was found.

In July 2024, Mike Powell, the Heritage executive director for its Oversight Project said, &quot;as things stand right now, there is a zero percent chance of a free and fair election in the United States of America,&quot; adding, &quot;I&#x27;m formally accusing the Biden administration of creating the conditions that most reasonable policymakers and officials cannot in good conscience certify an election.&quot; Heritage released a report predicting without supporting evidence that Biden might try to retain power &quot;by force&quot; if he were to lose in November. Election law expert Rick Hasen remarked, &quot;this is gaslighting and it is dangerous in fanning flames that could lead to potential violence.&quot;

==Funding==
In 1973, businessman Joseph Coors contributed $250,000 to establish the Heritage Foundation and continued to fund it through the Adolph Coors Foundation. The foundation&#x27;s trustees have historically included individuals affiliated with Chase Manhattan Bank, Dow Chemical, General Motors, Mobil, Pfizer, Sears, and other corporations.

Heritage is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization and BBB Wise Giving Alliance-accredited charity funded by donations from private individuals, corporations, and charitable foundations. It is not required to disclose its donors and donations under the current laws that guide tax-deductible organizations.

In the 1980s, the Heritage Foundation reportedly received a $2.2 million donation from the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, the intelligence agency of South Korea.

As of 2010, the foundation reported that it had 710,000 individual financial contributors.

For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011, CharityWatch reported that Edwin Feulner, the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s past president, received the highest compensation in its top 25 list of compensation received by charity members. Two years later, in 2013, according to CharityWatch, Feulner received $2,702,687, which included investment earnings of $1,656,230 accrued over 33 years.

As of 2013, Heritage is a grantee of Donors Trust, a nonprofit donor-advised fund.

In 2022, the foundation&#x27;s total revenue was $106 million and its expenditures were $93.7 million, according to ProPublica.

<text>Radiex Records was an American record label during the 1920s. It was manufactured by Grey Gull Records of Boston, Massachusetts, from 1921 until the demise of Grey Gull in late 1930; it was then pressed for a few more months into 1931 by the successor firm, which continued the Radiex, Van Dyke and Madison labels. Radiex records were sold in Montgomery Ward catalogs although they were not manufactured specifically for that firm. In some cases, records have been found which had the labels of other Grey Gull products over Radiex labels or vice versa.

Radiex records were standard, lateral-cut, double-sided 78 rpm discs pressed in various colours of shellac which generally wore down easily. The earliest paper sleeves in which Radiex records were sold described them as &quot;The Record of Beauty.&quot; The issues are popular vocal and dance numbers of the era, from masters recorded by Grey Gull, Plaza Music, Emerson Records, and sometimes Paramount Records. The Radiex label was discontinued (on 78 r.p.m. discs) in 1931

A fairly large number of label designs and colour variations were used on Radiex records over its short lifespan. Little is known about the source of the &quot;Radiex&quot; name, which may have been used to suggest some connection with radio.

Radiex discs bore the same catalog numbers, and contained the same material, as Grey Gull and other products of that company. There are, however, examples of Radiex issues using other takes of the same tunes as the corresponding Grey Gull issues (for example, &quot;Sweethearts on Parade&quot; on Radiex 1587, which uses a faster take -A with partly different solos than on the slower take -B used on Grey Gull 1587). Radiex Records were numbered in a 1000 series (dance music), a 2000 series (vocal), a 4000 series (standards) and a seldom-found 7000 race series, along with a mysterious 8000/8100 series whose function is not currently known.

When the Grey Gull firm ceased business in late 1930, a successor firm continued pressing Radiex, Van Dyke and Madison records until some point in the spring of 1931. These records carried Madison numbers (5000s followed by 6000s) and also had an 800/900 series which paired older Grey Gull &quot;B&quot; sides; a few country records have been seen with 51xx numbers. These records are visibly slightly different from the earlier Boston-pressed Grey Gull products.

Record collector and reissue specialist David Lennick of Toronto, Ontario, revived the use of the Radiex name for CDs.

<doc id="316179" wikidata="Q1709507" url="?curid=316179" title="Nabal">
<text>According to the 1st Book of Samuel Chapter 25, Nabal ( &quot;Nāḇāl&quot;, &quot;fool&quot;)
was a rich Calebite, described as harsh and surly. He is featured in a story in which he is threatened by David over an insult, and ultimately killed by God.

==Biblical Narrative==

According to the Biblical narrative, David (who was not yet king) and his band of men, who had been fleeing from King Saul, went to the Wilderness of Paran.

The account states that Nabal lived in the city of Maon, and owned much land in the town of Carmel, as well as many sheep and goats. The account is set at the time of sheep shearing, which in Israelite culture was a time for great festivities, owing to the importance of the wool trade. At this time David sent ten men to Nabal. David told his men to remind Nabal that his men had not harmed or robbed Nabal&#x27;s shepherds, and requested that Nabal give him whatever provisions were on hand. David&#x27;s request is couched in language that refers to David&#x27;s men as Nabal&#x27;s servants, and to David himself as Nabal&#x27;s &quot;son.&quot;

Nabal harshly rebuffs David&#x27;s request: &quot;Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants these days that break away every man from his master; shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men of whom I know not whence they are?&quot;

Upon hearing of Nabal&#x27;s reply, David and four hundred of his men arm themselves with swords.

One of Nabal&#x27;s shepherds, considering Nabal too abrasive to approach about the issue, warns Nabal&#x27;s wife, Abigail, of the situation, along with a positive account of his previous experiences with David and his men.

Abigail chose to intervene in order to avert David&#x27;s wrath. In the account, while David armed his men and set off with 400 of them for Nabal&#x27;s home, leaving 200 men behind to look after the supplies, Abigail set off with her servants, and a very large quantity of provisions, without telling Nabal.

Abigail manages to meet David and his men before David could reach Nabal and she pleads for David to accept the gifts she has brought with her, and begs that there be no bloodshed, asking to take Nabal&#x27;s blame herself, and complimenting David by stating that Yahweh would make his dynasty long lasting, and David sinless and divinely protected; as a result of her actions, David recognized that he is about to sin and calls off his threat and sends Abigail home in peace. Abigail does not tell Nabal about what she has done until the following day as, when she returns, Nabal is drunk and high spirited due to a kingly banquet, but when she does tell Nabal he has a heart attack, or possibly a stroke, and dies ten days later. The account ends with David hearing about the death, recognizing that it was a punishment from Yahweh, and asking for, and receiving, the hand of Abigail in marriage.

== Abigail&#x27;s character ==
Abigail is described in the account as being beautiful and intelligent, and the aggadah treats Abigail as being one of the four most beautiful women in Jewish history (the other three being Sarah, Rahab, and Esther); in the aggadah it is claimed that David nearly fell in love with her while she was still the wife of Nabal, but Abigail&#x27;s moral strength and dignity prevented any liaisons, although she is also criticized for stating &quot;remember your handmaid&quot;, as in the agaddah&#x27;s view this was unbecoming of a married woman.

== Textual features and origin ==
The root meaning of the name &quot;Nabal&quot; is &quot;wilt&quot;, and came to mean &quot;failure&quot;, and so gained the figurative meaning of being &quot;shamelessly improprietous&quot;; in the Nabal narrative, he is described as living up to his name, in addition to being surly and mean. Traditionally &quot;Nabal&quot; is euphemistically translated as &quot;fool&quot;, for which a Hebrew synonym is &quot;kesil&quot; (literally meaning &quot;fool&quot;); scholars regard it as possible that some features of the Nabal narrative derive from primitive mythology, and it is notable that &quot;kesil&quot; particularly referred to the constellation of Orion, and was translated as &quot;Orion&quot; by the Septuagint.

&quot;Nabal&quot; (נבל) may be a deliberate satirical corruption of the name &quot;Nadab&quot; (נדב); if this is an eponym then it probably referred originally to Jehonadab (which is just a theophory of &quot;nadab&quot;), and thus represent the Rechabites. In the genealogical lists of the Books of Chronicles, there is a man named &quot;Nadab&quot;, whose &quot;brother&quot; is married to a person named &quot;Abihail&quot;; it is possible that the name &quot;Abigail&quot; (אבגיִל) is a corruption of &quot;Abihail&quot; (אֲביִהיִל), so that it more closely describes the character of the wife, since &quot;Abigail&quot; roughly means &quot;joy of my father&quot;, suggesting positive characteristics, while &quot;Abihail&quot; means only &quot;my father is strength&quot;. Rather than &quot;the name of his wife was Abigail&quot; (שׁם אִשׁתּוֹ אבגיִל) the account in the Books of Samuel may have originally read &quot;the name of the chief of Abihail&quot; (שׁם שר אביהיִל), and told of a clan named &quot;Abihail&quot;, which left a political alliance with the Rechabites (represented by Nabal/Nadab) to join the Kingdom of Judah (represented by David&#x27;s band of men).

Textual scholars ascribe this narrative to the &quot;republican source&quot; of the Books of Samuel (named this due to its generally negative presentation of David and Saul); the rival source, known as the &quot;monarchial source&quot;, does not at first glance appear to contain a similar narrative. The same narrative position is occupied in the &quot;monarchial source&quot; by the story of a raid by Amalekites on the town of Ziklag, and the subsequent defeat of the Amalekites by David. There are some similarities between the narratives: the fact that Ziklag and Maon are located in the region south of Hebron; David leading an army in revenge (for the Amalekite&#x27;s destruction of Ziklag and capture of its population), with 400 of the army going ahead and 200 staying behind; David gaining Abigail as a wife (though in the Ziklag narrative he re-gains her), as well as several provisions; and there being a jovial feast in the enemy camp (i.e. Nabal&#x27;s property). However, there are also several differences: such as the victory and provisions being obtained by a heroic victory by David rather than Abigail&#x27;s peaceful actions; the 200 that stayed behind doing so due to exhaustion rather than to protect the baggage; the main secondary character being the former slave of the enemy, rather than the wife of the enemy (Nabal); David&#x27;s forces rejoining their wives rather than being joined by damsels; and the Amalekites rather than Nabal being the enemy.

<doc id="316183" wikidata="Q440276" url="?curid=316183" title="Ernst Gideon von Laudon">
<text>Ernst Gideon von Laudon, since 1759 Freiherr von Laudon (originally Laudohn or Loudon; 13 February 171714 July 1790), was a Baltic German-born Austrian military officer and one of the most successful opponents of the Prussian king Frederick the Great.

== Background and early career ==
Laudon was the son of Otto Gerhard Ritter von Laudohn (1673-1732), a lieutenant-colonel, retired on a meagre pension from the Swedish service and his wife, Sophie Eleonore von Bornemann (1680-1734). The Laudohn family, of mixed German and Latgalian origin, had been settled in the estate of Tootzen, near Laudohn in Eastern Livonia (present-day Latvia) before 1432. he claimed a kinship with the Earls of Loudoun from Scotland, which could not be established. As upon the Great Northern War Livonia had been ceded to Russia according to the 1721 Treaty of Nystad, the boy was sent to the Imperial Russian Army as a cadet in 1732. During the War of the Polish Succession he took part in the 1734 Siege of Danzig led by Feldmarschall Burkhard Christoph von Münnich, he marched against French troops up to the Rhine in 1735 and back to the Dnieper River into the Turkish campaign.

After the 1739 Treaty of Belgrade, he returned to the Russian court at Saint Petersburg. Dissatisfied with his prospects and the conditions in the Russian Army, he finally resigned in 1741 and sought military employment elsewhere. He applied first to King Frederick the Great, who however declined his services. At Vienna he had better fortune, being made a captain in the &quot;Freikorps&quot; of Franz von der Trenck. During the War of the Austrian Succession, he took part in its forays and marches, though not in its atrocities, until wounded and taken prisoner in Alsace. He was shortly released by the advance of the main Austrian army.

== Silesian Wars ==
His next active service, still under Trenck, was in the Silesian mountains in 1745 (during the Second Silesian War against Prussia), in which campaign he greatly distinguished himself as a leader of light troops. He was present also at the Battle of Soor. He retired shortly afterwards, owing to his distaste for the lawless habits of his comrades in the irregulars, and after long waiting in poverty for a regular commission he was at last made a captain in one of the frontier regiments, spending the next ten years in half-military, half-administrative work in the Karlovac district on the Military Frontier. At Bunić, where he was stationed, he built a church and planted an oak forest now called by his name. He had reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel when the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War called him again into the field. From this point began his fame as a soldier. At first rejected by General Wilhelm Reinhard von Neipperg, he soon was promoted colonel at the behest of Chancellor Wenzel Anton Kaunitz and distinguished himself repeatedly. He drew attention at the small but much reported night raid on Ostritz on 1 January 1757 and during that year fought in Bohemia and Saxony under Feldmarschall Maximilian Ulysses Browne and became a &quot;Generalfeldwachtmeister&quot; (equivalent to major-general) of cavalry as well as a knight of the newly founded Maria Theresa Military Order.

In the Third Silesian War campaign of 1758 came his first opportunity for fighting an action as a commander-in-chief, and he used it so well that Frederick the Great was obliged to give up the siege of Olomouc and retire into Bohemia (Battle of Domstadtl, 30 June). He was rewarded with the grade of lieutenant-field-marshal and having again shown himself an active and daring commander in the campaign of Hochkirch, he was created a Freiherr in the Austrian nobility by Maria Theresa and in the peerage of the Holy Roman Empire by her husband the emperor Francis. Maria Theresa gave him, further, the grand cross of the order she had founded and an estate near Kutná Hora in Bohemia.

He was placed in command of the Austrian contingent sent to join the Russians on the Oder, and participated in Kunersdorf alongside Pyotr Saltykov where a joint Russo-Austrian contingent won a great victory. As a result, Laudon was promoted Feldzeugmeister and made commander-in-chief in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia. In 1760 he destroyed a whole corps of Frederick&#x27;s army under Fouqué at the Battle of Landeshut and stormed the important fortress of Glatz. In 1760 he sustained a severe reverse at Frederick&#x27;s hands in the Battle of Liegnitz (15 August 1760), which action led to bitter controversy with Daun and Lacy, the commanders of the main army, who, Laudon claimed, had left his corps unsupported. In 1761 he operated, as usual, in Silesia, but he found his Russian allies as timid as they had been after Kunersdorf, and all attempts against Frederick&#x27;s entrenched camp of Bunzelwitz failed. He brilliantly seized his one fleeting opportunity, however, and stormed Schweidnitz on the night of September 30/October 1, 1761. His tireless activity continued to the end of the war, in conspicuous contrast with the temporizing strategy of Counts Leopold Josef von Daun and Franz Moritz von Lacy. The student of the later campaigns of the Seven Years&#x27; War will probably admit that there was need of more aggressiveness than Daun displayed, and of more caution than suited Laudon&#x27;s genius. But neither recognized this, and the last three years of the war are marked by an ever-increasing friction between the &quot;Fabius&quot; and the &quot;Marcellus,&quot; as they were called, of the Austrian army.

== Later career ==
After the peace, therefore, when Daun became the virtual commander-in-chief of the army, Laudon fell into the background. Offers were made, by Frederick the Great amongst others, to induce Laudon to transfer his services elsewhere. Laudon did not entertain these proposals, although negotiations went on for some years, and on Lacy succeeding Daun as president of the Council of War, Laudon was made inspector-general of infantry. Dissensions, however, continued between Laudon and Lacy, and on the accession of Joseph II, who was intimate with his rival, Laudon retired to his estate Bečváry near Kutná Hora.

Maria Theresa and Kaunitz caused him, however, to be made commander-in-chief in Bohemia and Moravia in 1769. This post he held for three years, and at the end of this time, contemplating retirement from the service, he settled again on his estate. Maria Theresa once more persuaded him to remain in the army, and, as his estate had diminished in value owing to agrarian troubles in Bohemia, she repurchased it from him, in 1776, on generous terms. Laudon then settled at Hadersdorf near Vienna, and shortly afterwards was made a field-marshal. Of this Carlyle (&quot;Frederick the Great&quot;) records that when Frederick the Great met Laudon in 1776 he deliberately addressed him in the emperor&#x27;s presence as &quot;Herr Feldmarschall&quot;, but the hint was not taken until February 1778.

In 1778 came the War of the Bavarian Succession. Joseph and Lacy were now reconciled to Laudon and Laudon and Lacy commanded the two armies in the field. On this occasion, however, Laudon seems to have in a measure fallen below his reputation, while Lacy, who was opposed to Frederick&#x27;s own army, earned new laurels.

For two years after this Laudon lived quietly at Hadersdorf. A new war, with Turkey, broke out in 1787. The generals charged with prosecuting this war did badly, and Laudon was called for the last time into the field. Though old and broken in health, he was commander-in-chief in fact as well as in name, and in 1789 he won a last brilliant success by capturing Belgrade in three weeks. He served the position of military governorship of Habsburg Serbia from his capture of Belgrade until his death while cooperating with the resistance fighters of Koča Anđelković.

He died within the year, at Nový Jičín (Neu-Titschein) in Moravia, still on duty. His last appointment was that of commander-in-chief of the armed forces of Austria, which had been created for him by the new emperor Leopold. Laudon was buried in the grounds of Hadersdorf. Eight years before his death the emperor Joseph had erected a marble bust of Laudon in the chamber of the council of war.

His nephew Johann Ludwig Alexius von Loudon (1762–1822) fought in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars with credit, and rose to the rank of Feldmarschall-Leutnant.

== Personal life ==
Loudon was married in Bösing to Clara von Hagen, daughter of an Officer in Croatia and a relation of the Salviati family. Prior to the marriage, Clara has served as lady&#x27;s maid to Countess Charlotte of Solms-Sonnewalde (1725–1783), wife of Governor of the Archduchy of Austria, Count Christian August von Seilern und Aspang (1717-1801). He had to abduct his future wife because the family opposed the match. The marriage was childless.

==Notes==
The first battleship of the &quot;Ersatz Monarch&quot; class of the Austro-Hungarian Navy (officially known as &quot;Schiff VIII&quot;) was to be named &quot;Laudon&quot;. The ship was never completed due to the outbreak of World War I which interrupted all major warship construction in Austria-Hungary.

The phrase &quot;fix Laudon&quot; is a light curse sometimes used in Austria. It is said that it was first uttered by Maria Theresa upon her hearing of the loss of Silesia to Frederick the Great.

<text>was a &quot;daimyō&quot; during late-Edo period Japan, who later served as chief senior councilor (&quot;Rōjū&quot;) in service to the Tokugawa shogunate. He is remembered for having instituted the Tenpō Reforms.

==Biography==
Mizuno Tadakuni was the second son of Mizuno Tadaaki, the daimyō of Karatsu Domain. As his elder brother died at an early age, Tadakuni became heir in 1805 and was presented to &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ienari and future &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyoshi in a formal audience in 1807. In 1812, on the retirement of his father, he became head of the Mizuno clan and daimyō of Karatsu. He entered the service of the Tokugawa shogunate as a &quot;Sōshaban&quot; (Master of Ceremonies) at Edo Castle in 1816. However, faced with increasing difficulties over the policing of the foreign trade port of Nagasaki, in 1817, Tadakuni petitioned to be transferred from the Karatsu Domain to the much smaller Hamamatsu Domain in Tōtōmi Province. Although both domains were ranked officially at 70,000 &quot;koku&quot;, Karatsu Domain had an effective income of 253,000 &quot;koku&quot; as opposed to only 153,000 &quot;koku&quot; for Hamamatsu. As a consequence, this transfer was met with outrage and disbelief by his senior retainers, resulting in the &quot;seppuku&quot; of his senior advisor, but Tadakuni would not be dissuaded. The same year, within the shogunal administration, he received the post of &quot;Jisha-bugyō&quot; (Commissioner of Shrine and Temples).

In 1825, Tadakuni received the post of &quot;Osaka-jō dai&quot; (Castellan of Osaka), with a promotion to Lower 4th Court Rank. The following year (1826), he became Kyoto Shoshidai, the shogunate&#x27;s official representative to the Court in Kyoto. His courtesy title was changed from &quot;Izumi-no-kami&quot; to &quot;Echizen-no-kami&quot;. In 1828, Tadakuni became a &quot;Rōju&quot;. He steadily rose through the ranks of the &quot;Rōjū&quot; to become Senior &quot;Rōjū&quot; in 1839.

As &quot;Rōjū&quot; Mizuno Tadakuni wielded tremendous political power, and attempted to overhaul the shogunate&#x27;s finances and social controls in the aftermath of the Great Tempo Famine of 1832–36 by the passage of numerous sumptuary laws which came to be known as the Tenpō Reforms. The reforms tried to stabilize the economy through a return to the frugality, simplicity and discipline that were characteristic from the early Edo period by banning most forms of entertainment and displays of wealth. This proved extremely unpopular with the commoners. Another part of the Reform included the &quot;Agechi-rei&quot; which was to have daimyō in the vicinity of Edo and Ōsaka surrender their holdings for equal amounts of land elsewhere, thereby consolidating Tokugawa control over these strategically vital areas. However, this was also greatly unpopular amongst daimyō of all ranks and income levels. The general failure of the reforms caused Tadakuni to lose favor, and opinion of him declined further when Edo Castle burned down in May 1844. On February 22, 1845, he was relieved of his position in the government, and on September 2, 1845, he was exiled to Yamagata Domain in Dewa Province, where he remained in exile until his death. He died on March 12, 1851, five days before word of his release from exile would have reached him. He was succeeded by his son Mizuno Tadakiyo, who was also an important figure in the late Tokugawa shogunate.

Mizuno Tadakuni was married to a daughter of Sakai Tadayuki, a &quot;wakadoshiyori&quot; and daimyō of Obama Domain.

==Depiction in popular culture==
Mizuno is a recurring, sometimes major, character in the &quot;Nemuri Kyōshirō&quot; films, TV series and TV specials, where he is Chief Elder of the &quot;Rōjū&quot;.

<text>Caleb ( ; , , ) is a figure who appears in the Hebrew Bible as a representative of the Tribe of Judah during the Israelites&#x27; journey to the Promised Land.

Following the Israelite conquest of Canaan, Caleb was described as a Kenizzite and is said to have received lands originally intended for the Tribe of Judah. The Calebites, his descendants, likely comprised a mixed population of Edomite and Judean elements. They resided in southern Judah and in the northern part of the Negev region.

A reference to him is also found in the Quran, although his name is not mentioned (Al-Ma&#x27;idah: 20–26).

&quot;Caleb&quot; is related to the Hebrew word for &#x27;dog&#x27; (), with &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; reporting that the animal is thought to be &quot;the totem of a clan&quot;.

==Biblical account==
Caleb, son of Jephunneh from the tribe of Judah (Book of Numbers, ), is not to be confused with Caleb, great-grandson of Judah through Tamar (). This other Caleb was the son of Hezron, and his wife was Azubah ().

According to , Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, was one of the twelve spies sent by Moses into Canaan. Their task, over a period of 40 days, was to explore the Negev and surrounding area, and to make an assessment of the geographical features of the land, the strength and numbers of the population, the agricultural potential and actual performance of the land, settlement patterns (whether their cities were like camps or strongholds), and forestry conditions. Moses also asked them to be courageous and to return with samples of local produce.

In the Numbers 13 listing of the heads of each tribe, reads &quot;Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.&quot; Caleb&#x27;s report balanced the appeal of the land and its fruits with the challenge of making a conquest.

 of chapter 13 reads &quot;And Caleb stilled the people toward Moses, and said: &#x27;We should go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. Caleb and Joshua said the people should trust God and go into the land; the other ten spies, being fearful and rebellious, argued that conquering the land was impossible. They spread doubt and fear among all the people, who again wished to be back in Egypt (chapter 14 v 1-4)

===Caleb as a Kenizzite===
Caleb the spy is the son of Jephunneh. Jephunneh is called a Kenizzite (, ,). The Kenizzites are listed as one of the nations associated with the land of Canaan at the time that God made a covenant with Abraham (). However, Caleb is mentioned alongside the descendants of Judah recorded in : &quot;And the sons of Caleb the son of Jephunneh: Iru, Elah, and Naam; and the sons of Elah: Kenaz&quot; (). , likewise, lists Caleb as a tribal leader in Judah. Contrarily, the Kenizzites are also generally associated with Kenaz, the son of Esau, making them an Edomite clan (see ).

===Deeds===
In the aftermath of the conquest, Caleb asks Joshua to give him a mountain in property within the land of Judah, and Joshua blesses him as a sign of God&#x27;s blessing and approval, giving him Hebron (). Since Hebron itself was one of the Cities of Refuge to be ruled by the Levites, it is later explained that Caleb actually was given the outskirts (). Caleb promised his daughter Achsah in marriage to whoever would conquer the land of Debir from the giants. This was eventually accomplished by Othniel Ben Kenaz, Caleb&#x27;s nephew (), who became Caleb&#x27;s son-in-law as well ().

1 Samuel states that Nabal, the husband of Abigail before David, was &quot;a Calebite&quot; (Hebrew &quot;klby&quot;). It is not stated whether this refers to one of the Calebs mentioned in the Bible, or another person bearing the same name.

==Traditional Jewish accounts==
Traditional Jewish sources record a number of stories about Caleb which expand on the biblical account.
Jewish traditions identify Mered with Caleb, and his wife Bithiah with the princess who rescued Moses from the river.

One account records that Caleb wanted to bring produce from the land, but that the other spies discouraged him from doing so in order to avoid giving the Israelites a positive impression of Canaan. They only agreed to carry in samples of produce after Caleb brandished a sword and threatened to fight over the matter. A Midrash refers to Caleb being devoted to the Lord and to Moses, splitting from the other scouts to tour Hebron on his own and visit the graves of the Patriarchs. While in Canaan with the spies, Caleb&#x27;s voice was so loud that he succeeded in saving the other spies by frightening giants away from them.

== Islam ==
Caleb () is referenced indirectly in the Quran and some scholars consider him to be one of the Prophets of Islam, though this is debated.

<text>The Revised Version (RV) or English Revised Version (ERV) of the Bible is a late-19th-century British revision of the King James Version. It was the first (and remains the only) officially authorised and recognised revision of the King James Version in Great Britain. The work was entrusted to over 50 scholars from various denominations in Great Britain. American scholars were invited to co-operate, by correspondence. Its New Testament was published in 1881, its Old Testament in 1885, and its Apocrypha in 1894. The best known of the translation committee members were Brooke Foss Westcott and Fenton John Anthony Hort; their fiercest critics of that period were John William Burgon, George Washington Moon, and George Saintsbury.

== Features ==
The New Testament revision company was commissioned in 1870 by the convocation of Canterbury. Their stated aim was &quot;to adapt King James&#x27; version to the present state of the English language without changing the idiom and vocabulary,&quot; and &quot;to adapt it to the present standard of Biblical scholarship.&quot; To those ends, the Greek text that was used to translate the New Testament was believed by most to be of higher reliability than the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. The readings used by the revisers were compiled into a new edition of the Greek Testament by Edwin Palmer.

The Revised Version is significant in the history of English Bible translation for many reasons. At the time of the RV&#x27;s publication, the nearly 300-year-old King James Version was the main Protestant English Bible in Victorian England. The RV, therefore, is regarded as the forerunner of the entire modern translation tradition. It was also considered more accurate than the King James Version in a number of verses.

== New version ==

The revisers were charged with introducing alterations only if they were deemed necessary to be more accurate and faithful to the original Greek and Hebrew texts. In the New Testament alone more than 30,000 changes were made, over 5,000 on the basis of what were considered better Greek manuscripts. The work was begun in 1879, with the entire work completed in 1885. (The RV Apocrypha came out in 1894.)

The 1885 Revised Version was the first post–King James Version modern English Bible to gain popular acceptance. It was used and quoted favorably by ministers, authors, and theologians in the late 1800s and throughout the 1900s, such as Andrew Murray, T. Austin-Sparks, Watchman Nee, H.L. Ellison, F.F. Bruce, and Clarence Larkin, in their works. Other enhancements introduced in the RV include arrangement of the text into paragraphs, formatting Old Testament poetry as indented poetic lines instead of prose, and the inclusion of marginal notes to alert the reader to variations in wording in ancient manuscripts. The Apocrypha in the Revised Version became the first printed edition in English to offer the complete text of Second Esdras, inasmuch as damage to one 9th-century manuscript had caused 70 verses to be omitted from previous editions and printed versions, including the King James Version.

In the United States, the Revised Version was adapted and revised as the &quot;Revised Version, Standard American Edition&quot; (the American Standard Version) in 1901. The American Standard Version is largely identical to the 1885 Revised Version, with minor variations in wording considered to be slightly more accurate. One noticeable difference is the American Standard Version&#x27;s much more frequent use of &quot;Jehovah&quot; to represent the Tetragrammaton in the Old Testament, rather than &quot;the &quot; that is used more in the 1885 Revised Version.

The 1885 Revised Version and the 1901 American Revision are among the Bible versions authorized for use in services of the Episcopal Church and also of the Church of England.

==Later history==
The American Standard Version was the basis for many revisions in the first hundred years after it was released. The RV itself has never been the basis for any revision except for the American Standard Version and the Apocrypha in the Revised Standard Version.

As the Revised Version is out of copyright worldwide, it is widely available online and in digital and e-reader formats (although it is significantly less popular than the KJV or the ASV in this manner). However, interest in the 1885 Revised Version has grown in recent years due to the internet, for general research and reference, and study of history of English Bible translations. It is sparsely available in printed published form today, with only Cambridge University Press publishing it in the form of a KJV/RV interlinear.

<text>Grey Gull Records was a record company and label founded in Boston, Massachusetts in 1919. The company was started by Theodore Lyman Shaw, a member of an upper class family from Wellesley, Massachusetts.

Shaw was involved in a number of business projects, including the Marcus Lucius Quinn School of Music in Dorchester. He operated an advertising business (Harvard University Class of 1905, &quot;25th Anniversary Report&quot;, 575). According to the Massachusetts Department of Corporation and Taxation, Grey Gull was incorporated on December 31, 1919 and dissolved on March 31, 1934. (&quot;Acts&quot; 1934, c.187)

==History==

Grey Gull Records began at 295 Huntington Avenue in Boston (advertisement in &quot;Talking Machine World&quot;, 15 October 1920, p. 192), but city directories show that by 1923 the company&#x27;s offices were in South Boston at 135 Dorchester Avenue. In the early 1920s, Grey Gull discs were recorded and manufactured at a plant at 81 Wareham Street in Boston (&quot;Local Studio,&quot; C7; &quot;Boston Globe&quot; classified ad, 21 August 1920, p. 9)

The first issues of Grey Gull were high-quality, vertical-cut discs sold at premium prices. Their small grooves were to be played with a needle or stylus, giving about twice the playing time of the standard 10-inch 78 rpm. Most offered more than one selection per side. These records bore catalog numbers prefixed with an &quot;H,&quot; probably because vertical-cut discs were called &quot;Hill and Dale&quot; (Marco, 302-303)

These unusual records sold poorly at a rather high price for the time of one dollar each. They were phased out by 1920 to be replaced by the more common lateral-cut records. The essential patent on such discs had expired in 1919. The lateral discs bore catalog numbers prefixed with &quot;L&quot; (for lateral) and sold for the same high price. These records were recorded in Boston, where the company and Shaw were located (&quot;Local Studio,&quot; C7). In 1926 Grey Gull&#x27;s recording operations were moved to New York City. A &quot;New York Times&quot; mention on 24 April 1926, p. 31 said Grey Gull had leased offices on the fifth floor of 20 East 42nd Street in Manhattan. An announcement of the move also appeared in the trade publication &quot;Talking Machine World&quot; on 15 July 1926.

By 1922, Grey Gull records were priced at 55 cents each. Shaw placed a series of newspaper ads, publicizing this price and asserting that his Grey Gull Records were &quot;Better than 75-cent records...much better&quot; (ad in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, 10 September 1922, p. 6). He introduced a method of selling records that became standard in the music industry. Grey Gull placed display racks offering their latest product in newsstands, cigar stores, drug stores, and other businesses, returning on a regular basis to restock the racks and settle accounts with the merchant, a system known today as rack jobbing. The racks are mentioned in some of the ads Shaw placed, and Grey Gull Records became associated with them (see for example &quot;This Famous Rack is Everywhere,&quot; &quot;Springfield Republican&quot;, 12 November 1923, p. 7). A good example of Shaw&#x27;s strategy of placing the racks in a wide variety of locations can be seen in an ad for Ruth&#x27;s Drug Store in Elyria, Ohio. The druggist, Dr. Robert J. Ruth, offered to demonstrate the records to those who came into his store (&quot;Elyria Chronicle Telegram&quot;, 3 June 1922, p. 9).

With the drop in price came a drop in quality. Grey Gull had also introduced its Radiex Records label, and it too offered low-priced records. Raymond&#x27;s department store in Boston advertised Radiex records for 40 cents each, or two for 75 cents, in a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; ad (30 July 1922, p. 10). In 1924, a Los Angeles department store advertised Radiex records at 47 cents each, or three for $1.35 (&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, 21 September 1924, p. B26). Grey Gull also pressed client labels, such as Oriole for the McCrory chain, and later pressed by the Plaza Music Company, and Amco, Nadsco, and Globe, the latter possibly a continuation of an earlier label of that name.

During this period, Grey Gull typically put one &quot;hit&quot; song on the top side and original composition by one of the company&#x27;s &quot;staff composers&quot; on the flip side. Mike Mosiello contributed instrumentals (many often released on several issues with varying titles) which, apart from solo work by himself and Andy Sannella, often featured the accordionist Charles Magnante and xylophone virtuoso George Hamilton Green. This unusual line-up, combined with Grey Gull&#x27;s over-modulated sound, give these records a particular sound of their own. Vocalists included Irving Kaufman and Arthur Fields. Elmer Feldkamp was often heard as vocalist on The California Ramblers sides of 1929–1930. Grey Gull went out of business at the end of September 1930.

Grey Gull used primarily their own recordings during 1922 and 1923, although some were leased from other companies such as Plaza, Emerson, and the New York Recording Laboratories. The label did more of its own recording after 1926 with a house band that included trumpeter Mike Mosiello and clarinetist Andy Sannella. Grey Gull released music by Cliff Jackson, Clarence Williams, and the Wabash Trio. Grey Gull&#x27;s recordings were also released by other labels, such as Madison, Radiex, Supreme, and Van Dyke.

<text>&quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; is a song by English punk rock band the Sex Pistols. It was released as the band&#x27;s debut single on 26 November 1976 and was later featured on their album &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;. &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; was number 56 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.

==Releases==
Originally issued in a plain black sleeve, the single was the only Sex Pistols recording released by EMI, and it reached number 38 on the UK Singles Chart before EMI dropped the group on 6 January 1977, a month after members of the band used profanity during a live television broadcast. (Although the EMI version was recorded on 17 October 1976, an earlier demo version was recorded between 10 and 12 October at Lansdowne/Wessex Studios, London. This version later surfaced on the Sex Pistols bootleg album &quot;Spunk&quot;).

In 2007, the surviving members (not including original Pistols bassist Glen Matlock) re-recorded &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; for the video game &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot; because the multi-track master could not be found (it was rediscovered along with the rest of the &quot;Never Mind The Bollocks&quot; masters during a move in January 2012). The &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; version also appears in the film adaption of the &quot;A-Team&quot;. The song was also featured in the video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot; as part of the soundtrack. The song also appears in the &quot;Constantine&quot; TV series during the episode &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Vinyl&quot;.

A limited edition 7&quot; picture disc of the single was released on 21 April 2012 for that year&#x27;s Record Store Day. In June 2022, a test pressing of the single that belonged to John Peel sold for more than £20,000 at auction.

==Lyrics==

In the documentary &quot;The Filth and the Fury&quot;, John Lydon described the composition of the song&#x27;s opening lyrics, explaining that the best rhyme he could devise for the first line, &quot;I am an Antichrist&quot;, was the second line, &quot;I am an anar&quot;chist&quot;&quot;. (Lydon confirmed that he is not an anarchist in a 2012 interview.)

Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren considered the song &quot;a call to arms to the kids who believe that rock and roll was taken away from them. It&#x27;s a statement of self rule, of ultimate independence.&quot;

===Abbreviations===
The abbreviations used in the lyrics are a selection of civil war references from 1970s headlines, a suggestion of what could happen in the United Kingdom. The IRA and the UDA were the largest paramilitary armies in the conflict in Northern Ireland: the heavily armed IRA (Irish Republican Army) were on the Republican (anti-British, pro-unification) side, and the thousands-strong UDA (Ulster Defence Association) were on the Loyalist (pro-British, anti-unification) side. The MPLA (Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola, or the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola) were the political party that took control of Angola, formerly one of Portugal&#x27;s African colonies, in a 1975–1976 civil war, and still run the country today. When Rotten sings &quot;I use the enemy&quot;, it&#x27;s a deliberate homonym for &quot;I use the NME&quot;, or New Musical Express, the British weekly music newspaper.

== Cover versions ==

=== &quot;L&#x27;Anarchie Pour Le UK&quot; ===
An alternative recording of the song in time, accompanied by violin and accordion, apparently both translated into French and sung by a mysterious figure called Louis Brennon (also named as Jerzimy in some sources), appeared on the Sex Pistols&#x27; 1979 album &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot;.

=== Megadeth ===
&quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; was covered by American thrash metal band Megadeth for their third album &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot;, released in 1988.

Megadeth&#x27;s version has altered lyrics. Dave Mustaine explained that he could not understand Johnny Rotten&#x27;s singing, so he made up the parts he could not understand (in a notable example, the line &quot;another council tenancy&quot; is changed to &quot;and other cunt-like tendencies&quot;). In addition, the country is changed to &quot;USA&quot;, though the title is kept unchanged. The song&#x27;s music video is a montage of live footage of the band, cartoon political figures, various scenes of violence, and of a man being forced to watch (much like Alex&#x27;s therapy in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;). Steve Jones played the second solo.

Mustaine now refuses to play the song live due to lyrics referring to the Anti-Christ, and he believes he&#x27;s &quot;better for it&quot;.

====Charts====
===Green Jellÿ===
Green Jellÿ&#x27;s version of &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; is a parody cover of the original with added &quot;Flintstones&quot; references. The song originally appeared as &quot;Anarchy in Bedrock&quot; on Green Jellÿ&#x27;s (then Green Jellö&#x27;s) &quot;Triple Live Möther Gööse at Budokan&quot; album. William Hanna and Joseph Barbera took offence to this version and to Green Jellÿ mocking &quot;The Flintstones&quot; but later relented, as this version was featured on the soundtrack to the &quot;Flintstones&quot; film that was released in 1994.

====Critical reception====
Pete Stanton from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; gave the Green Jellÿ version five out of five, writing, &quot;They&#x27;ve followed the insanity of Three Little Pigs with more madness, littering a great song with &quot;Yabadabadoo&quot;s and an eardrum bursting &quot;Wiiillmmaaaa&quot; at the end. Get into Green Jelly quick before a doctor slips them into strait-jackets, shoves them into a room and locks the door.&quot;

===Mötley Crüe===

American heavy metal band Mötley Crüe covered the song on their 1991 compilation album &quot;Decade of Decadence&quot;, substituting US analogies and organizations in the lyrics for UK ones. It was also their last song with lead singer Vince Neil until 1997&#x27;s &quot;Generation Swine&quot;.

<text>Friedrich August von Finck (1718 – February 24, 1766) was a Prussian general and writer.

==Biography==
Finck was born in Mecklenburg-Strelitz. He first saw active service in 1734 on the Rhine, as a member of the suite of Anton Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Soon after this he transferred to the Austrian service, and thence went to Russia, where he served until the fall of his patron Marshal Burkhard Christoph von Münnich put an end to his prospects of advancement. In 1742 he went to Berlin, and Frederick the Great made him his &quot;aide-de-camp&quot;, with the rank of major. Good service brought him rapid promotion in the Seven Years&#x27; War. After the Battle of Kolin (June 18, 1757) he was made colonel, and at the end of 1757 major-general.

At the beginning of 1759 Finck became lieutenant-general, and in this rank commanded a corps at the disastrous Battle of Kunersdorf, where he did good service both on the field of battle and in the rallying of the beaten Prussians; Frederick eventually having handed over command to him. On September 21 Finck fought, in concert with General Johann Jakob von Wunsch, the Battle of Korbitz, in which the Austrians and the contingents of the minor states of the Empire were defeated. For this action Frederick gave Finck the Order of the Black Eagle.

However the subsequent catastrophe of the Battle of Maxen abruptly put an end to Finck&#x27;s active career. The Prussians had capitulated Dresden to the Austrians on September 4, and Finck was ordered by the king to Maxen (a village in the Pirna region of Saxony) to cut off the enemy&#x27;s movement. Being dangerously exposed, and having inadequate forces, Finck accordingly advised the king against such operation but followed his unchanged orders. Cut off and vastly outnumbered, he was forced to surrender with some 14,000 men on November 21, 1759. After the Peace of Hubertusburg, Frederick sent him before a court-martial, which sentenced him to be cashiered. He also was imprisoned for a year in the fortress at Spandau. At the expiry of this term Finck entered Danish service as general of infantry. He died at Copenhagen in 1766, still feeling wronged by Frederick&#x27;s inexorable rigor.

==Writing==
Finck left a work called &quot;Gedanken über militärische Gegenstände&quot; (Berlin, 1788).

Jonathan Kolia Favreau was born in Flushing, Queens, New York, on October 19, 1966, the only child of Madeleine, an elementary school teacher who died of leukemia in 1979, and Charles Favreau, a special education teacher. His mother was Ashkenazi Jewish and his father is a Catholic of Italian and French-Canadian ancestry. Favreau dropped out of Hebrew school to pursue acting. However, following his mother&#x27;s death, both sides of his family worked to ensure he had a bar mitzvah ceremony.

Favreau graduated from The Bronx High School of Science, a school for gifted students, in 1984 and attended Queens College from 1984 to 1987, before dropping out. His friend from college, Mitchell Pollack, has said that Favreau went by the nickname &quot;Johnny Hack&quot; because of his abilities in the game Hacky Sack. He briefly worked for Bear Stearns on Wall Street before returning to Queens College for a semester in early 1988. He dropped out of college for good (a few credits shy of completing his degree), and moved to Chicago in the summer of 1988 to pursue a career in comedy. He performed at several Chicago improvisational theaters, including the ImprovOlympic and the Improv Institute.

==Career==
=== 1992–2000: Early career ===
While in Chicago, Favreau landed his first film role alongside Sean Astin as tutor D-Bob in the sleeper hit &quot;Rudy&quot; (1993). Favreau met Vince Vaughn – who played a small role in this film – during shooting. The next year, he appeared in the college film &quot;PCU&quot; alongside Jeremy Piven, and the 1994 episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; titled &quot;The Fire&quot; as Eric the Clown.

Favreau then moved to Los Angeles, where he made his breakthrough in 1996 as an actor-screenwriter with the film &quot;Swingers&quot;, which was also Vaughn&#x27;s breakthrough role as the character Trent Walker, a foil to Favreau&#x27;s heartbroken Mike Peters. In 1997, he appeared on the television sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, portraying Pete Becker – Monica Geller&#x27;s millionaire boyfriend who competes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) – for several episodes. Favreau made appearances in the sketch-comedy series, &quot;Tracey Takes On...&quot; in both 1996 and 1997.

Favreau landed the role of Gus Partenza in &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998), and that same year rejoined Piven in &quot;Very Bad Things&quot; (1998). In 1999, he starred in the television film &quot;Rocky Marciano&quot;, based on the life of world heavyweight champion, Rocky Marciano. He later appeared in &quot;Love &amp; Sex&quot; (2000), co-starring Famke Janssen. Favreau appeared in 2000&#x27;s &quot;The Replacements&quot; as maniacal linebacker Daniel Bateman, and that same year he played himself in &quot;The Sopranos&quot; episode &quot;D-Girl&quot;, as a Hollywood director who feigns interest in developing mob associate Christopher Moltisanti&#x27;s screenplay in order to collect material for his own screenplay.

===2001–2015: Actor–director===

In 2001, he made his film directorial debut with another self-penned screenplay, &quot;Made&quot;. &quot;Made&quot; once again teamed him up with his &quot;Swingers&quot; co-star Vince Vaughn. Favreau also starred in a TV series called &quot;Dinner for Five&quot;, which aired on the cable TV channel IFC from 2001 to 2005.

He was a guest-director for an episode of the college dramedy &quot;Undeclared&quot; in 2001, and Favreau got some screen time as lawyer Foggy Nelson in the 2003 movie &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2003) (considerably more in the director&#x27;s cut version). He also starred in &quot;The Big Empty&quot; (2003), directed by Steve Anderson. His character was John Person, an out of work actor given a strange mission to deliver a blue suitcase to a man named Cowboy in the desert. Favreau is credited as a screenwriter for the 2002 film &quot;The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest&quot;.

He scored his first financial success as a director of the hit comedy &quot;Elf&quot; (2003) starring Will Ferrell, Zooey Deschanel, James Caan, and Peter Dinklage. Also in 2003, Favreau had a small part in &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot; (a film starring Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson); Favreau played Leo, Harry Sanborn&#x27;s (Nicholson) personal assistant, who visited Harry in the hospital. In 2005, Favreau directed the film adaptation of the children&#x27;s book &quot;Zathura&quot;. It received positive reviews, but was not commercially successful. Favreau continued to make regular appearances in film and television. He reunited with friend Vaughn in the romantic comedy &quot;The Break-Up&quot; and appeared in &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; as a reprehensible fast food manager. Favreau also made a guest appearance in Vaughn&#x27;s &quot;Wild West Comedy Show&quot;.

Also in 2005, Favreau appeared as a guest judge and executive representative of Sony Corporation in week five of the NBC business-focused primetime reality TV show, &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. He was called upon to judge the efforts of the show&#x27;s two teams of contestants, who were assigned the task of designing and building a float to publicize his 2005 Sony Pictures movie, &quot;&quot;.

On April 28, 2006, it was announced that Favreau was signed to direct the long-awaited &quot;Iron Man&quot; movie. Released on May 2, 2008, the film was a huge critical and commercial success, solidifying Favreau&#x27;s reputation as a director. In 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It is one of three superhero movies to achieve this honor alongside Richard Donner&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; and Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. &quot;Iron Man&quot; was the first Marvel-produced movie under their alliance with Paramount, and Favreau served as the director and an executive producer. During early scenes in &quot;Iron Man,&quot; Favreau appears as Tony Stark&#x27;s driver, Happy Hogan. He wrote two issues of a planned mini-series for Marvel Knights titled &quot;Iron Man: Viva Las Vegas&quot;, that debuted in September 2008 before being canceled in November 2008. Favreau also directed and executive produced the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;. Favreau said in December 2010 that he would not direct &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; but remain an executive producer.
Favreau was the third director attached to &quot;John Carter&quot;, the film adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; swashbuckling space hero. While he did not ultimately direct it, he did appear in a cameo in the film, as a bookie.

In 2008, he played Denver, a bully-type bigger brother to Vaughn in &quot;Four Christmases.&quot; Favreau co-starred in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Couples Retreat&quot;, a comedy chronicling four couples who partake in therapy sessions at a tropical island resort, which he wrote. The film saw him co-star with Vaughn again, while Kristin Davis played his wife. He voices the character Pre Vizsla, the leader of the Mandalorian Death Watch, in the animated series, &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;. In September 2009, he signed up to direct &quot;Cowboys &amp; Aliens&quot; based on the graphic novel of the same name created by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg. The science fiction Western film was released in 2011, starring Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, and is considered to be a financial disappointment, taking $174.8 million in box office receipts on a $163 million budget and received mixed reviews, with critics generally praising its acting while criticizing other aspects.

In 2012, Favreau directed the pilot for the NBC show, &quot;Revolution,&quot; and served as one of the show&#x27;s executive producers, alongside J. J. Abrams. In 2013, Favreau directed an episode (Season 9, Episode 16) of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Office&quot;. That same year he filmed a pilot for a TV series based on the novel &quot;About a Boy&quot;, but set in San Francisco. He also directed the &quot;Destiny&quot; trailer &quot;The Law of the Jungle&quot;.

In 2014, Favreau wrote, co-produced, directed, and starred in &quot;Chef&quot;. Favreau played a chef who, after a public altercation with a food critic, quits his job at a popular Los Angeles restaurant to operate a food truck with his young son. It co-stars Sofía Vergara, John Leguizamo, Scarlett Johansson, Oliver Platt, Bobby Cannavale and Dustin Hoffman, along with Robert Downey Jr. in a cameo role. Favreau wrote the script after directing several big-budget films, wanting to go &quot;back to basics&quot; and to create a film about cooking. It was well received by critics, who praised the direction, music, writing, story, and performances grossing $45 million against a production budget of $11 million.

===2016–present: Franchise work ===
Favreau directed and produced the live-action adaptation of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, for Walt Disney Pictures, which was released on April 15, 2016, to critical and commercial acclaim. That same year, it was reported that Favreau would direct a CGI adaptation of Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot;, marking his first time directing a musical. Donald Glover voiced Simba, and James Earl Jones reprised his role as Mufasa from the original film. The film was released in July 2019. On July 29, &quot;The Lion King&quot; surpassed &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; to become Favreau&#x27;s highest-grossing film as director, while also surpassing the original film.

<text>Kenaz ( &quot;Qənāz&quot;, &quot;hunter&quot;) is the name of several persons in the Hebrew Bible.

* A son of Eliphaz, and a grandson of Esau. He was an Edomite leader. (Genesis 36:11, 15, 42). He may have been the ancestor of the Kenezites.
* Caleb&#x27;s younger brother, and father of Othniel (Book of Joshua 15:17; Book of Judges 1:13; 1 Chronicles 4:13), whose Judahite family was of importance in Israel down to the time of David (1 Chronicles 27:15). Nothing more is said of Kenaz in the Hebrew Bible, but Pseudo-Philo (written c. AD 70) makes this Kenaz the first judge of Israel after Joshua, and includes several chapters of narrative about his supposed judgeship of 57 years.
* Caleb&#x27;s grandson. (1 Chr. 4:15)</text><links>

<text>Eliphaz ( &quot;My Elohim is gold&quot;, Standard Hebrew Elifaz, Tiberian Hebrew ʾĔlîp̄az / ʾĔlîp̄āz) was the first-born son of Esau and his wife Adah. He had six sons, of whom Omar was the firstborn, and the others were Teman, Zepho, Gatam, Kenaz and finally Amalek, who was born to his concubine Timna. The people of Amalek were the ancestral enemy of the Israelite people (Book of Exodus ; Book of Deuteronomy ; I Samuel ).

The Midrash relates that when Jacob escaped from Esau and fled to his uncle Laban in Haran, Esau sent Eliphaz to pursue and kill Jacob, his uncle, who was his Rabbi also. When they met, Jacob implored Eliphaz not to kill him, but Eliphaz challenged that he had his father&#x27;s instructions to fulfill. Jacob gave everything he had with him to Eliphaz and said, ”Take what I have, for a poor man is counted as dead.&quot; Eliphaz was satisfied and left his uncle and rabbi poor, but still alive: (Rashi to the Book of Genesis )

According to Louis Ginzburg&#x27;s Legends of the Jews, Eliphaz was a prophet.

<text>Guster is an American alternative rock band formed in Somerville, Massachusetts. Founding members Adam Gardner, Ryan Miller, and Brian Rosenworcel began practice sessions while attending Tufts University and formed the band in 1991. The members met during the freshman Wilderness Orientation program in August of that year, playing publicly together as a trio two months later at the Midnight Cafe coffee house set in the common area of the Lewis Hall dormitory. While attending Tufts, the band lived at 139 College Avenue in Somerville.

The band stayed &quot;underground&quot; for its first two full-length albums, &quot;Parachute&quot; (1994) and &quot;Goldfly&quot; (1997), but broke into the musical mainstream in 1999 with its third studio album &quot;Lost and Gone Forever&quot;, featuring the single &quot;Fa Fa&quot;, which made it onto the Adult Top 40. The band enjoyed moderate success on the charts with &quot;Keep It Together&quot;, its fourth album, with two singles in the Adult Top 40 (&quot;Careful&quot; and &quot;Amsterdam&quot;). Joe Pisapia joined the official lineup for &quot;Keep It Together&quot; and its follow-up, &quot;Ganging Up on the Sun&quot;, which peaked at 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. A variety of television shows and movies have featured the band&#x27;s music, including &quot;Martian Child&quot;, which featured their song &quot;Satellite&quot;; &quot;Disturbia&quot;; &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;; &quot;Life as a House&quot;, which makes several allusions to the band throughout the film; &quot;The O.C.&quot;; and one of the band&#x27;s songs was used in an ad for The Weather Channel. The band earned its first gold record in 2018 for its single &quot;Satellite&quot;.

Guster&#x27;s tours were originally local, but began to spread as the band gained popularity. In 1999, Guster gave its first performance in Canada, followed by a 2004 tour in Britain that had four shows in London and one in Manchester. Guster maintains a liberal taping policy and has a very dedicated and active taping community. In addition, the band has released several live shows via iTunes.

==History==

=== 1990s ===
The band members met during freshman orientation at Tufts University in 1991. A year later, after writing a few songs in their dorm rooms, the band named itself Gus and booked its first gig. The band recorded its first album independently in 1994, titled &quot;Parachute&quot;. This album established the band as a favorite of the same 1990s scene that became popular through bands such as the Dave Matthews Band, The Disco Biscuits, moe., Phish, and Widespread Panic. The band was still in college when it recorded the album. Shortly after the release of &quot;Parachute&quot;, another artist calling himself Gus signed a deal with a major record company, forcing the band to rename itself Guster.

In 1996, Guster independently recorded their second album, &quot;Goldfly&quot;, releasing it early the next year. In 1998 the band signed with Sire Records and re-released &quot;Goldfly&quot;. A year later, the band released the album &quot;Lost and Gone Forever&quot;, produced by Steve Lillywhite. With the backing of a major label, the band appeared on shows such as the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and it released their first music video for their song &quot;Fa Fa&quot;. The band also appeared at Woodstock &#x27;99, and performed at the 1999 Stardust Picnic festival at Historic Fort York, Toronto.

=== 2000s ===
Guster released their fourth album, &quot;Keep It Together&quot;, in 2003, with the first single, &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, getting significant airplay on the radio. Following the release of &quot;Keep it Together&quot;, multi-instrumentalist Joe Pisapia, who had been touring with the band, became a full-time member. A live album/DVD, &quot;Guster on Ice&quot;, compiled from two shows in Portland, Maine, in December 2003, was released in 2004. Guster released its fifth full-length studio album, &quot;Ganging Up on the Sun&quot;, on June 20, 2006. The single &quot;Manifest Destiny/Sorority Tears&quot; was released in November 2005 on the Internet. On September 27, 2006, Guster won Album of the Year (Major) at the Boston Music Awards. Alongside &quot;Ganging Up on the Sun&quot;, the band released on its website a documentary comedy series called &quot;Joe&#x27;s Place&quot;. The band also participated in the Barenaked Ladies&#x27; Ships and Dip cruise. In 2009, Guster took part in a similar event with musician John Mayer called Mayercraft Carrier 2 aboard the Carnival Splendor.

=== 2010s ===
Guster released their sixth studio album, &quot;Easy Wonderful&quot;, on October 5, 2010. Mixing for the album commenced on March 15, 2010, according to an update from the band&#x27;s Twitter account. On April 30, Guster released &quot;Jonah&quot;, an outtake from sessions for their then upcoming album, on the &quot;Download to Donate for Haiti&quot; compilation album. On July 20, Guster released the song &quot;Bad, Bad World&quot; as a free download on their website. Before starting their 2010 fall tour, Guster announced that Joe Pisapia would not be touring with the band. Instead, Pisapia would be touring with k.d. lang, with whom he had been writing songs. It was also announced that Luke Reynolds would be filling in for Pisapia starting September 12, 2010. On July 26, 2011, Ryan Miller went onto turntable.fm to give live previews of tracks off of Guster&#x27;s &quot;On The Ocean&quot; EP and listen to music with fans.

In early 2014, it was announced that Guster was recording its seventh studio album under the production of The Shins keyboardist Richard Swift. Guster announced that the album was finished on April 8, 2014, and would be independently published on their Ocho Mule label. Guster released &quot;Evermotion&quot; on January 13, 2015, with Ocho Mule/ Nettwerk Records. The debut concert for &quot;Evermotion&quot; took place with the release of the Greenovate Boston 2014 Climate Action Plan Update with Mayor Marty Walsh as a statement of the band&#x27;s support for environmental causes.

In 2016, en route to play a show in Philadelphia, the group was stopped in Pittsburgh due to the January 2016 United States blizzard. The group tweeted that they planned to play a short set on the North Side in front of a dumpster at the corner of Sampsonia Way and Veto Street at 2 p.m. Saturday. Several people showed up for the show, and a video of the show was posted to the band&#x27;s Facebook page. To celebrate their 25th anniversary, the band held a series of shows around their hometown of Boston in January 2017.

On January 28, 2019, Guster released their eighth studio album, &quot;Look Alive&quot;, on Nettwerk/Ocho Mule.

=== 2020s ===
In 2020, the group embarked on an acoustic tour with Connor Ratliff from Upright Citizens Brigade that was ultimately cut short due to COVID-19. In 2021, they began work on their next album with producer Josh Kaufman. In 2023 they embarked on a tour, which began on March 17, 2023, in Dallas. In December 2023, in a nod to Taylor Swift&#x27;s massively successful The Eras Tour, Guster announced their next tour, &quot;We Also Have Eras,&quot; covering songs from their 30+ years as a band. Two months later, in February 2024, Guster announced their ninth studio album and first new release in five years, &quot;Ooh La La&quot;.

In May 2024, Guster performed a short set at Porchfest in Somerville, MA, drawing thousands. The band members originally met while attending Tufts University in 1991, and performed on the same street (Aberdeen Road) on which they lived in the 1990s.

==Style==
Guster is often recognized for its choice of instruments during their earlier years: two members playing acoustic guitars and one member playing various percussion instruments. Brian Rosenworcel, the band&#x27;s percussionist (affectionately dubbed the Thunder God by fans), added to Guster&#x27;s unique sound with a combination of bongos, cymbals, and other drums, playing live shows using only his bare hands. While Miller played rhythm parts, Gardner would often play a bass line on his guitar. Guster&#x27;s sound is recognized for its vocal harmonies, with both Miller and Gardner singing lead vocals on different songs; in songs such as &quot;What You Wish For&quot; and &quot;Happier&quot;, the two members sing different lyrics simultaneously. While Guster&#x27;s studio albums included more instrumental variety (e.g. violin, bass, drum kit), its live shows generally retained the same lineup until tours supporting its album &quot;Lost and Gone Forever,&quot; in which the band diversified by playing different instruments on some songs. At this time, Rosenworcel began introducing a more traditional drum kit into the stage and studio performances in an effort to move away from bare-hand percussion.

Guster&#x27;s live shows have a style of their own. For encores, the band has sometimes featured drummer Brian Rosenworcel moving to the front microphone and singing humorous covers. These have ranged from Temple of the Dog&#x27;s &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; to 4 Non Blondes&#x27; &quot;What&#x27;s Up?&quot; to the theme song from the TV show &quot;Cheers&quot; (&quot;Where Everybody Knows Your Name&quot;). Other examples include: &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; by Bonnie Tyler, &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; by Phil Collins, and &quot;Firework&quot; by Katy Perry. Other traditions at live shows have been developed over the years. For example, at the end of &quot;Airport Song&quot;, people in the crowd throw ping-pong balls at the stage, in reference to the studio recording where the audio of a table tennis game can be heard in the background.

The band&#x27;s humor is noted by many fans. For laughs, the three original members of Guster opened a number of their own shows as the Peace Soldiers, three redneck-looking musicians. With the addition of Joe into the band, it has since opened for itself in costume as a jam band called Trippin&#x27; Balls. During a 2001 show (which was oddly enough opened by Joe Pisapia&#x27;s band Joe, Marc&#x27;s Brother) in Rochester, New York, the band started their show with an empty stage. The music to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; played over the sound system, and a voice called each of the band members down from where they had hid themselves in the audience. Upon hearing their name, each member played the part of an enthusiastic game show contestant all the way to the stage. During a show in 2002 when Guster played with John Mayer and John Butler Trio in Memphis, Tennessee, the band danced around on stage with KFC buckets covering their heads while J.B.T. was playing their set. In 2019, during their third annual On the Ocean festival in Portland, Maine, the band advertised a free afterparty &quot;headlined by the legendary EDM group, PIPPI&quot;. During the afterparty, PIPPI was revealed to be the band dressed in matching jumpers with Pippi Longstocking style wigs.

==Fan reception==

Guster maintains a close relationship with its fans with regular studio updates and road journals on their website, guster.com, and signs autographs after shows. Guster once maintained a rep (representative) program, through which fans received promotional materials for upcoming concerts and albums to sell. Reps were rewarded with a special, rep-only series of EPs called &quot;The Pasty Tapes&quot; as well as invitations to rep-only concerts. Following the release of &quot;Ganging Up on the Sun&quot;, the band formed a new program called the Wrecking Machines, through which fans are able to receive posters for advertising nearby concerts. Guster is a constantly touring band, at times playing up to 250 shows a year. Kesha was an early fan and communicated with the band via email.

==Activism==
In 2004, Guster guitarist and vocalist Adam Gardner and his wife co-founded Reverb, an organization dedicated to assisting touring artists by making activities more environmentally sound. It operates from within the music industry as well as the environmental world. Reverb greens artists&#x27; tours and the music business at large while raising awareness and support for the environment through an interactive eco-village. Since its inception, Reverb has worked with (among others) Billie Eilish, Jack Johnson, Barenaked Ladies, Bonnie Raitt, John Mayer, Dave Matthews Band, and Guster. In July 2006, Gardner was among those interviewed about Reverb by &quot;The Green Room&quot; magazine, which would later interview Gardner alone in coverage of a Guster show. &quot;Newsweek&quot; did a similar profile in its April 16, 2007, issue.

In 2006, Guster named its spring tour the Campus Consciousness Tour. The band toured with The Format, and it powered its buses and trucks with biodiesel and aimed to use the tour to teach audiences about the environment. Participation in the early 2007 IZStyle Winter Tour had similar goals. In fall 2007, Guster headlined the Crocs&#x27; Next Step Campus Tour with Brett Dennen as a supporting act. The tour promoted eco-friendly green initiatives while educating attendees on ways to help the environment. The tour stopped at fifteen colleges.

<text>Asher ( &quot;’Āšēr&quot;), in the Book of Genesis, was the younger of the two sons of Jacob and Zilpah, and Jacob&#x27;s eighth son overall. He was the founder of the Israelite Tribe of Asher.

==Name==
The text of the Torah states that the name of &quot;Asher&quot; means &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;blessing&quot;, implying a derivation from the Hebrew term &quot;osher&quot; in two variations: &quot;beoshri&quot; (meaning &quot;in my good fortune&quot;), and &quot;ishsheruni&quot;. Some textual scholars who embrace the JEDP hypothesis of the Torah’s authorship attribute them to different sources: one to the Yahwist and the other to the Elohist. The Bible states that at his birth, Leah exclaimed, &quot;Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy: so she called his name Asher&quot;, meaning &quot;happy&quot; (Genesis 30:13). Some scholars argue that the name of &quot;Asher&quot; may have to do with a deity originally worshipped by the tribe, either Asherah, or Ashur, the chief Assyrian deity; the latter possibility is cognate with &quot;Asher&quot;.

==Biblical narrative==
Asher and his four sons and daughter settled in Canaan. On his deathbed, Jacob blessed Asher by saying that &quot;his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties&quot; (Gen. 49:20).

Moses said of Asher: &quot;May Asher be blessed above other sons; may he be esteemed by his brothers; may he bathe his feet in olive oil.&quot; (Deuteronomy 33:24). 

Asher was the eighth son of the patriarch Jacob and the traditional progenitor of the tribe Asher.

Asher is represented as the younger brother of Gad, these two being the sons of Zilpah, the handmaid of Leah (Genesis 35:26). The Biblical account shows Zilpah&#x27;s status as a handmaid changed to an actual wife of Jacob (Genesis 30:9). Some biblical scholars regard this status as indicating that the authors saw the tribe of Asher as being not of entirely Israelite origin; they believe that Asher consisted of certain clans affiliated with portions of the Israelite tribal confederation, but which were never incorporated into the body politic.

The Torah states that Asher had four sons and one daughter, who were born in Canaan and migrated with him to Egypt, with their descendants remaining there until the Exodus; this seems to be partly contradicted by Egyptian records (assuming a late Exodus date), according to which a group named &quot;Aseru&quot;, a name from which Asher is probably derived, were, in the 14th century BC, living in a similar region to Asher&#x27;s traditional territory, in Canaan. Asher&#x27;s daughter, Serah (also transliterated as Serach), is the only granddaughter of Jacob mentioned in the Torah (Gen. 46:17). 

Her mother is not named. According to classical rabbinical literature, Serach&#x27;s mother was named &quot;Hadurah&quot; and was a descendant of Eber. Although Hadurah was a wife of Asher, it was her second marriage, and Serach&#x27;s father was actually Hadurah&#x27;s first husband, who had died. In classical rabbinical literature, Hadurah&#x27;s marriage to Asher was his second marriage as well, his first having been to &quot;Adon&quot;, who was a descendant of Ishmael. The Book of Jubilees contradicts this, arguing instead that Asher&#x27;s wife was named &quot;Ijon&quot; (which probably means &quot;dove&quot;).

Asher&#x27;s sons were Jimnah, Ishuah, Isui, and Beriah.

==In rabbinical literature==
Asher was the very one whose endeavor it had always been to reconcile the brothers—especially when they disputed which of them was destined to be the ancestor of the priests (&quot;Sifre Deuteronomy&quot; 355). In Asher 5 of the &quot;Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs&quot;, Asher is regarded as the example of a virtuous man who, with singlemindedness, strives only for the general good. According to classical rabbinical literature, Asher had informed his brothers about Reuben&#x27;s incest with Bilhah. As a result, Asher was on bad terms with his brothers. Once Reuben confessed to incest, the brothers realised they had been unjust towards Asher. Asher&#x27;s motivation is described by classical rabbinical sources as being entirely innocent of evil intent and always in search of harmony between his brothers. 

Asher was born on 20 Shevat 2199 (1562 BCE) and, according to some accounts, died on 2 Shevat.

Asher married twice. His first wife was Adon, a great-granddaughter of Ishmael; his second was Hadurah, a granddaughter of Eber and a widow. By her first marriage, Hadurah had a daughter named Serah, whom Asher treated as if she were his own. According to the Book of Jubilees 34:20, Asher&#x27;s wife was named Iyon (probably, &quot;dove&quot;).

Asher&#x27;s descendants, in more than one regard, deserved their name (&quot;Asher&quot; meaning &quot;happiness&quot;). The tribe of Asher was the one most blessed with male children, and their women were so beautiful that priests and princes sought them in marriage. The abundance of olive oil in the land possessed by Asher so enriched the tribe that none of them needed to hire a habitation. The soil was so fertile that, in times of scarcity, especially in the Sabbatical year, Asher provided all of Israel with olive oil. The Asherites were also renowned for wisdom.

==Scholarly interpretations==
A number of scholars have proposed that the tribe of Asher actually originated as the Weshesh group of Sea Peoples—the name &quot;Weshesh&quot; (or rather &quot;Uashesh&quot;/&quot;Ueshesh&quot;—for easy pronunciation, this is usually transcribed into English as &quot;Weshesh&quot;) can be decomposed as &quot;men of Uash&quot; in Hebrew, and hence possibly a corruption of &quot;Asher&quot;.

== Tomb ==
A Samaritan tradition recorded in the late 19th century considered Neby Toba near Tubas to be the burial place of Asher.

<text>Colonel George Bruce Malleson (8 May 1825 – 1 March 1898) was an English officer in India and the author of several works on British Indian colonial history.

==Biography==

Malleson was born in Wimbledon, son of John Malleson. Educated at Wimbledon and Winchester, he obtained a cadetship in the Bengal Native infantry in 1842, and served through the second Burmese War. His subsequent appointments were in the civil line, the last being that of guardian to the young maharaja of Mysore, Chamarajendra Wodeyar from 1869 to 1877. He retired with the rank of colonel in 1877, having been created C.S.I. in the 1872 Birthday Honours.

He was a prolific writer, his first work to attract attention being the famous &quot;Red Pamphlet&quot;, published at Calcutta in 1857, when the Sepoy Mutiny was at its height. He continued, and considerably rewrote the &quot;History of the Indian Mutiny 1857-8&quot; (6 vols., 1878–1880), which was begun but left unfinished by Sir John Kaye. Among his other books the most valuable are &quot;History of the French in India&quot; (2nd ed., 1893) and &quot;The Decisive Battles of India&quot; (3rd ed., 1888).

He authored the biographies of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, the French governor-general Dupleix and the British officer Robert Clive for the Rulers of India series.

He died at 27 West Cromwell Road, London, on 1 March 1898.

<text>In the Hebrew Bible, Jethro was Moses&#x27; father-in-law, a Kenite shepherd and priest of Midian, sometimes called Reuel (or Raguel). In Exodus, Moses&#x27; father-in-law is initially referred to as &quot;Reuel&quot; (Exodus 2:18) but afterwards as &quot;Jethro&quot; (Exodus 3:1). He was also identified as the father of [[List of minor Old Testament figures, A–K#Hobab|Hobab]] in Numbers 10:29, though Judges 4:11 identifies him &quot;as&quot; Hobab.

Muslim scholars and the Druze identify Jethro with the prophet [[Jethro (biblical figure)|Shuayb]], also said to come from Midian. For the Druze, Shuayb is considered the most important prophet, and the ancestor of all Druze.

==In Exodus==
Jethro is called a priest of Midian and became father-in-law of Moses after he gave his daughter, Zipporah, in marriage to Moses. He is introduced in .

Jethro is recorded as living in Midian, a territory stretching along the eastern edge of the Gulf of Aqaba, northwestern Arabia. Some believe Midian is within the Sinai Peninsula. Biblical maps from antiquity show Midian on both locations.

Jethro&#x27;s daughter, Zipporah, became Moses&#x27; wife after Moses fled Egypt for killing an Egyptian who was beating an enslaved Hebrew. Having fled to Midian, Moses intervened in a water-access dispute between Jethro&#x27;s seven daughters and the local shepherds; Jethro consequently invited Moses into his home and offered him hospitality. However, Moses remained conscious that he was a stranger in exile, naming his first son (Jethro&#x27;s grandson) &quot;Gershom&quot;, meaning &quot;stranger there&quot;.

Moses is said to have worked as a shepherd for Jethro for 40 years before returning to Egypt to lead the Hebrews to Canaan, the &quot;promised land&quot;. After the Battle at Rephidim against the Amalekites, word reached Jethro that under Moses&#x27; leadership the Israelites had been delivered out of Egypt, so he set out to meet with Moses. They met in the wilderness at the &quot;Mountain of God&quot;; Moses recounted to Jethro all that had taken place, and then, according to Exodus 18:9–12a:

Following this event, it was Jethro who encouraged Moses to appoint fellows to share the burden of ministering to the Israelites by allowing others to help in judging smaller matters.

These events take place in the Torah portion &quot;Yitro&quot; (Exodus 18:1–20:23).

==Names==

There is some disagreement over the name(s) of Moses&#x27; father-in-law. When he is first mentioned in , his name is Reuel, or Raguel in translations of the Septuagint. In , he is called Jethro, and in he is called both Jether and Jethro. In , a man named Hobab appears as Moses&#x27; father-in-law, while calls Hobab &quot;the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses&#x27; father in law&quot;, which scholars have considered more likely.

In Jewish tradition, these discrepancies were explained in the belief that the father-in-law of Moses had seven names: &quot;Reuel&quot;, &quot;Jether&quot;, &quot;Jethro&quot;, &quot;Hobab&quot;, &quot;Heber&quot;, &quot;Keni&quot; (comp. Judges i. 16, iv. 11), and &quot;Putiel&quot;; Eleazar&#x27;s father-in-law (Ex. vi. 25) being identified with Jethro by interpreting his name either as &quot;he who abandoned idolatry&quot; or as &quot;who fattened calves for the sake of sacrifices to the idol&quot;.

According to some modern scholars, &quot;Jethro&quot; was a title meaning &quot;His Excellency&quot;, and that &quot;Reuel&quot; was his personal, given name.

== Druze ==

Jethro, Moses&#x27; non-Hebrew father-in-law, is a central figure, particularly in the rites and pilgrimages, of the Druze religion. He is called Shuayb and viewed as the most important prophet for the Druze.

Nabi Shuʿayb is the site recognized by Druze as the tomb of Shuʿayb. It is located at Hittin in the Lower Galilee and is the holiest shrine and most important pilgrimage site for the Druze. Each year on 25 April, the Druze gather at the site in a holiday known as Ziyarat al-Nabi Shuʿayb to discuss community affairs and commemorate the anniversary of Jethro&#x27;s death with singing, dancing and feasting. Another Druze shrine in Ein Qiniyye is the supposed burial place of Jethro&#x27;s sister, Sit Shahwana.

Jethro is revered as the chief prophet in the Druze religion. They believe he was a &quot;hidden&quot; and &quot;true prophet&quot; who communicated directly with God and then passed on that knowledge to Moses, whom they describe as a &quot;recognised&quot; and &quot;revealed prophet.&quot; According to Druze belief, Moses was allowed to wed Zipporah, the daughter of Jethro, after helping save his daughters and their flock from competing herdsmen. He is also considered an ancestor of the Druze; as is expressed by such prominent Druze as Amal Nasser el-Din, and according to Salman Tarif, who was a prominent Druze shaykh, this makes the Druze related to the Jews through marriage. This view has been used to represent an element of the special relationship between Israeli Jews and Druze. The Israeli Druze also have a folktale called &quot;Jethro&#x27;s revenge on the [Sunni Muslim] inhabitants of the village of Hittin.&quot;
In Islam he is mentioned in the Quran as a prophet who was sent to the city of Midian. His people were destroyed because of their corruption except for the believers. He is thought to be the father-in-law for prophet Moses.

<doc id="316230" wikidata="Q1896138" url="?curid=316230" title="Porter's generic strategies">
<text>Michael Porter&#x27;s generic strategies describe how a company can pursue competitive advantage across its chosen market scope. There are three generic strategies: lower cost, product differentiation, or focus. The focus strategy has two variants, cost focus and differentiation focus, so it is possible to see the concept in terms of four distinct strategies.

A company chooses to pursue one of two types of competitive advantage, either via lower costs than its competition or by differentiating itself along dimensions valued by customers to command a higher price. A company also chooses one of two types of scope, either focus (offering its products to selected segments of the market) or industry-wide, offering its product across many market segments. The generic strategy reflects the choices made regarding both the type of competitive advantage and the scope. The concept was described by Michael Porter in 1980.

==Concept==
Porter wrote in 1980 that strategy targets either cost leadership, differentiation, or focus. These are known as his three generic strategies, which can be applied to any size or form of business. Porter claimed that a company must only choose one of the three or risk that the business would waste precious resources. Porter&#x27;s generic strategies detail the interaction between cost minimization strategies, product differentiation strategies, and market focus strategies of firms.

Michael Porter described an industry as having multiple &quot;segments&quot; that can be targeted by a firm. The breadth of its targeting refers to the &quot;competitive scope&quot; of the business. Porter defined two types of &quot;competitive advantage&quot;: lower cost or differentiation relative to its rivals. Achieving competitive advantage results from a firm&#x27;s ability to cope with the five forces better than its rivals. Porter wrote: &quot;Achieving competitive advantage requires a firm to make a choice...about the type of competitive advantage it seeks to attain and the scope within which it will attain it.&quot; He also wrote: &quot;The two basic types of competitive advantage [differentiation and lower cost] combined with the scope of activities for which a firm seeks to achieve them lead to three &quot;generic strategies&quot; for achieving above average performance in an industry: cost leadership, differentiation and focus. The focus strategy has two variants, cost focus and differentiation focus.&quot; In general:
*If a firm is targeting customers in most or all segments of an industry based on offering the lowest price, it is following a cost leadership strategy;
*If it targets customers in most or all segments based on attributes other than price (e.g., via higher product quality or service) to command a higher price, it is pursuing a differentiation strategy. It is attempting to differentiate itself along these dimensions favorably relative to its competition. It seeks to minimize costs in areas that do not differentiate it, to remain cost competitive; or
*If it is focusing on one or a few segments, it is following a focus strategy. A firm may be attempting to offer a lower cost in that scope (cost focus) or differentiate itself in that scope (differentiation focus).
The concept of choice was a different perspective on strategy, as the 1970s paradigm was the pursuit of market share (size and scale) influenced by the experience curve. Companies that pursued the highest market share position to achieve cost advantages fit under Porter&#x27;s cost leadership generic strategy, but the concept of choice regarding differentiation and focus represented a new perspective.

==Origin==
Empirical research on the profit impact of marketing strategy indicated that firms with a high market share were often quite profitable, but so were many firms with low market share. The least profitable firms were those with moderate market share. This was sometimes referred to as the hole in the middle problem. Porter&#x27;s explanation of this is that firms with high market share were successful because they pursued a cost leadership strategy and firms with low market share were successful because they used market segmentation to focus on a small but profitable market niche. Firms in the middle were less profitable because they did not have a strategy.

Porter suggested that combining multiple strategies is successful in only one case. Combining a market segmentation strategy with a product differentiation strategy was seen as an effective way of matching a firm&#x27;s product strategy (supply side) to the characteristics of your target market segments (demand side). But combinations like cost leadership with product differentiation were seen as hard (but not impossible) to implement, due to the potential for conflict between cost minimization and the additional cost of value-added differentiation.

Since that time, empirical research has indicated companies pursuing both differentiation and low-cost strategies may be more successful than companies pursuing only one strategy.

Some commentators have made a distinction between cost leadership, that is, low cost strategies, and best cost strategies. They claim that a low cost strategy is rarely able to provide a sustainable competitive advantage. In most cases firms end up in price wars. Instead, they claim a best cost strategy is preferred. This involves providing the best value for a relatively low price.

==Cost leadership strategy==
Cost leadership strategies involve the firm winning market share by appealing to cost-conscious or price-sensitive customers. This is achieved by having the lowest prices in the target market segment, or at least the lowest price to value ratio (price compared to what customers receive). To succeed at offering the lowest price while still achieving profitability and a high return on investment, the firm must be able to operate at a lower cost than its rivals. There are three main ways to achieve this.

The first approach is achieving a high asset utilization. In service industries, this may mean for example a restaurant that turns tables around very quickly, or an airline that turns around flights very fast. In manufacturing, it will involve production of high volumes of output. These approaches mean fixed costs are spread over a larger number of units of the product or service, resulting in a lower unit cost, i.e. the firm hopes to take advantage of economies of scale and experience curve effects. For industrial firms, mass production becomes both a strategy and an end in itself. Higher levels of output both require and result in high market share, and create an entry barrier to potential competitors, who may be unable to achieve the scale necessary to match the firms low costs and prices.

The second dimension is achieving low direct and indirect operating costs. This is achieved by offering high volumes of standardized products, offering basic no-frills products and limiting customization and personalization of service. Production costs are kept low by using fewer components, using standard components, and limiting the number of models produced to ensure larger production runs. Overheads are kept low by paying low wages, locating premises in low rent areas, establishing a cost-conscious culture, etc. Maintaining this strategy requires a continuous search for cost reductions in all aspects of the business. This will include outsourcing, controlling production costs, increasing asset capacity utilization, and minimizing other costs including distribution, R&amp;D and advertising. The associated distribution strategy is to obtain the most extensive distribution possible. Promotional strategy often involves trying to make a virtue out of low cost product features.

The third dimension is control over the value chain encompassing all functional groups (finance, supply/procurement, marketing, inventory, information technology etc..) to ensure low costs. For supply/procurement chain, this could be achieved by bulk buying to enjoy quantity discounts, squeezing suppliers on price, instituting competitive bidding for contracts, working with vendors to keep inventories low using methods such as Just-in-Time purchasing or Vendor-Managed Inventory. Wal-Mart is famous for squeezing its suppliers to ensure low prices for its goods. Other procurement advantages could come from preferential access to raw materials, or backward integration. Keep in mind that if you are in control of all functional groups this is suitable for cost leadership; if you are only in control of one functional group this is differentiation. For example, Dell Computer initially achieved market share by keeping inventories low and only building computers to order via applying Differentiation strategies in supply/procurement chain. This will be clarified in other sections.

Cost leadership strategies are only viable for large firms with the opportunity to enjoy economies of scale and large production volumes and big market share. Small businesses can be &quot;cost focused&quot; not &quot;cost leaders&quot; if they enjoy any advantages conducive to low costs. For example, a local restaurant in a low rent location can attract price-sensitive customers if it offers a limited menu, rapid table turnover and employs staff on minimum wage. Innovation of products or processes may also enable a startup or small company to offer a cheaper product or service where incumbents&#x27; costs and prices have become too high. An example is the success of low-cost budget airlines who, despite having fewer planes than the major airlines, were able to achieve market share growth by offering cheap, no-frills services at prices much cheaper than those of the larger incumbents. At the beginning low-cost budget airlines chose &quot;cost focused&quot; strategies but later when the market grew, big airlines started to offer the same low-cost attributes, and so cost focus became cost leadership! 

A cost leadership strategy may have the disadvantage of lower customer loyalty, as price-sensitive customers will switch once a lower-priced substitute is available. A reputation as a cost leader may also result in a reputation for low quality, which may make it difficult for a firm to rebrand itself or its products if it chooses to shift to a differentiation strategy in future.

==Differentiation strategy==
Businesses operating this strategy differentiate their products/services in some way in order to compete successfully. Examples of the successful use of a differentiation strategy are Hero, Asian Paints, HUL, Nike athletic shoes (image and brand mark), BMW Group Automobiles, Perstorp BioProducts, Apple Computer (product&#x27;s design), Mercedes-Benz automobiles.

A differentiation strategy is appropriate where the target customer segment is not price-sensitive, the market is competitive or saturated, customers have very specific needs which are possibly under-served, and the firm has unique resources and capabilities which enable it to satisfy these needs in ways that are difficult to copy. These could include patents or other intellectual property (IP), unique technical expertise (e.g. Apple&#x27;s design skills or Pixar&#x27;s animation prowess), talented personnel (e.g. a sports team&#x27;s star players or a brokerage firm&#x27;s star traders), or innovative processes. Successful differentiation is displayed when a company accomplishes either a premium price for the product or service, increased revenue per unit, or the consumers&#x27; loyalty to purchase the company&#x27;s product or service (brand loyalty). Differentiation drives profitability when the added price of the product outweighs the added expense to acquire the product or service but is ineffective when its uniqueness is easily replicated by its competitors. Successful brand management also results in perceived uniqueness even when the physical product is the same as competitors. This way, Chiquita was able to brand bananas, Starbucks could brand coffee, and Nike could brand sneakers. Fashion brands rely heavily on this form of image differentiation.

Differentiation strategy is not suitable for small companies. It is more appropriate for big companies to apply differentiation in any one or several of the functional groups (finance, purchase, marketing, inventory etc.). This point is critical. For example, GE uses its finance division differentiate itself. A company may do so in isolation of other strategies or in conjunction with focus strategies (requires more initial investment). It provides a great advantage to use a differentiation strategy (for big companies) in conjunction with focus cost strategies or focus differentiation strategies. Coca-Cola and Royal Crown beverages are good examples of this.

===Variants on the Differentiation Strategy===

The shareholder value model holds that the timing of the use of specialized knowledge can create a differentiation advantage as long as the knowledge remains unique. This model suggests that customers buy products or services from an organization to have access to its unique knowledge. The advantage is static, rather than dynamic, because the purchase is a one-time event.

The unlimited resources model utilizes competitors by practicing a differentiation strategy. An organization with greater resources can manage risk and sustain profits more easily than one with fewer resources. This provides a short-term advantage only. If a firm lacks the capacity for continual innovation, it will not sustain its competitive position over time.

==Focus strategies ==

This dimension is not a separate strategy for big companies due to small market conditions. Big companies which chose applying differentiation strategies may also choose to apply in conjunction with focus strategies (either cost or differentiation). On the other hand, this is definitely an appropriate strategy for small companies especially for those wanting to avoid competition with big ones.

In adopting a narrow focus, the company ideally focuses on a few target markets (also called a segmentation strategy or niche strategy). These should be distinct groups with specialized needs. The choice of offering low prices or differentiated products/services should depend on the needs of the selected segment and the resources and capabilities of the firm. It is hoped that by focusing your marketing efforts on one or two narrow market segments and tailoring your marketing mix to these specialized markets, you can better meet the needs of that target market. The firm typically looks to gain a competitive advantage through product innovation and/or brand marketing rather than efficiency. A focused strategy should target market segments that are less vulnerable to substitutes or where a competition is weakest to earn above-average return on investment.

Examples of firms using a focus strategy include Southwest Airlines, which provides short-haul point-to-point flights in contrast to the hub-and-spoke model of mainstream carriers, United, and American Airlines.

==Recent developments==

Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema (1993) in their book &quot;The Discipline of Market Leaders&quot; have modified Porter&#x27;s three strategies to describe three basic &quot;value disciplines&quot; that can create customer value and provide a competitive advantage. They are operational excellence, product leadership, and customer intimacy.

==Criticisms of generic strategies==
Several commentators have questioned the use of generic strategies claiming they lack specificity, lack flexibility, and are limiting.

Porter stressed the idea that only one strategy should be adopted by a firm and failure to do so will result in “stuck in the middle” scenario. He discussed the idea that practising more than one strategy will lose the entire focus of the organization hence clear direction of the future trajectory could not be established. The argument is based on the fundamental that differentiation will incur costs to the firm which clearly contradicts with the basis of low cost strategy and on the other hand relatively standardised products with features acceptable to many customers will not carry any differentiation hence, cost leadership and differentiation strategy will be mutually exclusive. Two focal objectives of low cost leadership and differentiation clash with each other resulting in no proper direction for a firm. In particular, Miller questions the notion of being &quot;caught in the middle&quot;. He claims that there is a viable middle ground between strategies. Many companies, for example, have entered a market as a niche player and gradually expanded. According to Baden-Fuller and Stopford (1992) the most successful companies are the ones that can resolve what they call &quot;the dilemma of opposites&quot;. Furthermore, Reeves and Routledge&#x27;s (2013) study of entrepreneurial spirit demonstrated this is a key factor in organisation success, differentiation and cost leadership were the least important factors.

However, contrary to the rationalisation of Porter, contemporary research has shown evidence of successful firms practising such a “hybrid strategy”. Research writings of Davis (1984 cited by Prajogo 2007, p. 74) state that firms employing the hybrid business strategy (Low cost and differentiation strategy) outperform the ones adopting one generic strategy. Sharing the same view point, Hill (1988 cited by Akan et al. 2006, p. 49) challenged Porter&#x27;s concept regarding mutual exclusivity of low cost and differentiation strategy and further argued that successful combination of those two strategies will result in sustainable competitive advantage. As to Wright and other (1990 cited by Akan et al. 2006, p. 50) multiple business strategies are required to respond effectively to any environment condition. In the mid to late 1980s where the environments were relatively stable there was no requirement for flexibility in business strategies but survival in the rapidly changing, highly unpredictable present market contexts will require flexibility to face any contingency (Anderson 1997, Goldman et al. 1995, Pine 1993 cited by Radas 2005, p. 197). After eleven years Porter revised his thinking and accepted the fact that hybrid business strategy could exist (Porter cited by Prajogo 2007, p. 70) and writes in the following manner.

Though Porter had a fundamental rationalisation in his concept about the invalidity of hybrid business strategy, the highly volatile and turbulent market conditions will not permit survival of rigid business strategies since long-term establishment will depend on the agility and the quick responsiveness towards market and environmental conditions. Market and environmental turbulence will make drastic implications on the root establishment of a firm. If a firm&#x27;s business strategy could not cope with the environmental and market contingencies, long-term survival becomes unrealistic. Diverging the strategy into different avenues with the view to exploit opportunities and avoid threats created by market conditions will be a pragmatic approach for a firm.
Critical analysis done separately for cost leadership strategy and differentiation strategy identifies elementary value in both strategies in creating and sustaining a competitive advantage. Consistent and superior performance over competition could be reached with stronger foundations in the event “hybrid strategy” is adopted. Depending on the market and competitive conditions, hybrid strategy should be adjusted regarding the extent which each generic strategy (cost leadership or differentiation) should be given priority in practice.

<text>Midian (; &quot;Mīḏyān&quot;; ; , &quot;Madiam&quot;; Taymanitic: 𐪃𐪕𐪚𐪌 &quot;MDYN&quot;) is a geographical region in West Asia mentioned in the Tanakh and Quran. William G. Dever states that biblical Midian was in the &quot;northwest Arabian Peninsula, on the east shore of the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea&quot;, an area which contained at least 14 inhabited sites during the Late Bronze and early Iron Ages.

According to the Book of Genesis, the Midianites were the descendants of Midian, a son of Abraham and his wife Keturah: &quot;Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah&quot; (Genesis 25:1–2, King James Version).

Traditionally, knowledge about Midian and the Midianites&#x27; existence was based solely upon Biblical and classical sources, but in 2010 a reference to Midian was identified in a Taymanitic inscription dated to before the 9th century BC.

== Land or tribal league? ==
Some scholars have suggested that the name &quot;Midian&quot; does not refer to geographic places or to a specific tribe, but to a confederation or &quot;league&quot; of tribes brought together as a collective for worship purposes. Paul Haupt first made this suggestion in 1909, describing Midian as a &quot;cultic collective&quot; () or an , meaning &quot;an association () of different tribes in the vicinity of a sanctuary&quot;. Elath, on the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba was suggested as the location of the first shrine, with a second sanctuary located at Kadesh.

Later writers have questioned the identified sanctuary locations but supported the thesis of a Midianite league. George Mendenhall suggests that the Midianites were a non-Semitic confederate group, and William Dumbrell maintains the same:
== Metallurgy ==
The area of Timna valley contains large deposits of copper that had been mined from the prehistoric times onward. Copper was mined here by the Egyptians during the reign of Pharaoh Seti I at the end of the 14th century BCE.

== Religion ==

It is uncertain which deities the Midianites worshipped. Through their apparent religio-political connection with the Moabites they are thought to have worshipped a multitude, including Baal-peor and Ashteroth. According to Karel van der Toorn, &quot;By the 14th century BC, groups of Edomites and Midianites worshipped Yahweh as their God;&quot; this conclusion is based on identification between Midianites and the Shasu.

The Midianite connections to metallurgy at Timna have been noted by many scholars. Large amounts of Midianite ceramic ware has been discovered at these mining sites.

An Egyptian temple of Hathor at Timna (Site 200) was first discovered during the Beno Rothenberg&#x27;s excavations.

:&quot;Rothenberg’s excavation of Site 200 revealed a number of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions including those of: Seti I, Ramesses II, Merneptah, Seti II, and Queen Twosret of the Nineteenth Dynasty, as well as Ramesses III, Ramesses IV, and Ramesses V of the Twentieth Dynasty (pp. 163–166).&quot;

The site also continued to be used during the Midianite occupation in the area, which is usually dated to terminal Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age.

The Midianites transformed the Hathor mining temple into a desert tent-shrine. In addition to the discovery of post-holes, large quantities of red and yellow decayed cloth with beads woven into it, along with numerous copper rings/wire used to suspend the curtains, were found all along two walls of the shrine.

Beno Rothenberg, the excavator of the site, suggested that the Midianites were making offerings to Hathor, especially since a large number of Midianite votive vessels (25%) were discovered in the shrine. However, whether Hathor or some other deity was the object of devotion during this period is difficult to ascertain.

A small bronze snake with gilded head was also discovered in the naos of the Timna mining shrine, along with a hoard of metal objects that included a small bronze figurine of a bearded male god, which according to Rothenberg was Midianite in origin. Michael Homan observes that the Midianite tent-shrine at Timna is one of the closest parallels to the biblical Tabernacle.

== In religious scripture ==
=== In the Bible ===

Midian was the son of Abraham. Abraham&#x27;s great-grandson Joseph, after being thrown into a pit by his brothers, was sold to either Midianites or Ishmaelites.

Moses spent 40 years in voluntary exile in Midian after killing an Egyptian. There, he married Zipporah, the daughter of Midianite priest Jethro (also known as Reuel). Jethro advised Moses on establishing a system of delegated legal decision-making. Moses asked Hobab, the son of Reuel, to accompany the Israelites travelling towards the Promised Land because of his local knowledge, but Hobab preferred to return to his homeland. A number of scholars have proposed that the biblical description of devouring fire on Mount Sinai refers to an erupting volcano in the land of biblical Midian identified as Hala-&#x27;l Badr in northwestern Saudi Arabia.

During the Baal-Peor episode, when Moabite women seduced Israelite men, Zimri, the son of a Simeonite chief, got involved with a Midianite woman called Cozbi. The couple were speared by Phinehas. War against Midian followed. Numbers 31 reports that all but the virgin females were slain and their cities burned to the ground. Some commentators, for example the Pulpit Commentary and Gill&#x27;s &quot;Exposition of the Bible&quot;, note that God&#x27;s command focused on attacking the Midianites and not the Moabites, and similarly Moses in Deuteronomy directed that the Israelites should not harass the Moabites. A modern-day movement, the Phineas Priesthood, has interpreted this story as a prohibition against miscegenation, despite the Midianites being closely related to the Israelites as descendants of Abraham, and Moses being married to a Midianite.

During the time of the Judges, Israel was oppressed by Midian for seven years until Gideon defeated Midian&#x27;s armies. Isaiah speaks of camels from Midian and Ephah coming to &quot;cover your land&quot;, along with the gold and frankincense from Sheba. This passage, taken by the Gospel of Matthew as a foreshadowing of the Magi&#x27;s gifts to the infant Jesus, has been incorporated into the Christmas liturgy.

=== In the Quran ===
The people of Midian are mentioned extensively in the Quran. The word &#x27;Madyan&#x27; appears 10 times in it. The people are also called (). The lands of Midian are mentioned in sura Al-Qasas (The Stories), verses 20–28, of the Quran as the place where Moses escaped upon learning of the chiefs conspiring to kill him.

Surah 9 (Al-Tawbah), verse 70 says &quot;Has not the story reached them of those before them? – The people of Nūḥ (Noah), ʿĀd and Thamud, the people of Ibrahim (Abraham), the dwellers [literally, comrades] of Madyan (Midian) and the cities overthrown [i.e. the people to whom Lūt (Lot) preached], to them came their Messengers with clear proofs. So it was not Allah who wronged them, but they used to wrong themselves.&quot;

In Surah 7 (Al-ʾAʿrāf), Madyan is mentioned as one of several peoples who were warned by prophets to repent lest judgment fall on them. The story of Madyan is the last, coming after that of Lot preaching to his people (referring to the destruction of the Cities of the Plain). Madyan was warned by the prophet Shuʿaib to repent of practicing polytheism, using false weights and measures and lying in wait along the road. But they rejected Shuʿayb, and consequently were destroyed by a tremor (&quot;rajfa&quot;, v. 91). Abdullah Yusuf Ali in his commentary (1934) writes, &quot;The fate of the Madyan people is described in the same terms as that of the Thamūd in verse 78 above. An earthquake seized them by night, and they were buried in their own homes, no longer to vex Allah&#x27;s earth. But a supplementary detail is mentioned in [Quran] 26:189, &#x27;the punishment of a day of overshadowing gloom,&#x27; which may be understood to mean a shower of ashes and cinders accompanying a volcanic eruption. Thus a day of terror drove them into their homes, and the earthquake finished them.&quot; Excavations at the oasis of Al-Bad&#x27;, identified as the city of Midian mentioned in classical and Islamic sources, have uncovered evidence of an occupation spanning from the 4th millennium BC.

== Pottery ==
Midianite pottery, also called Qurayyah Painted Ware (QPW), is found at numerous sites stretching from the southern Levant to NW Saudi Arabia, the Hejaz; Qurayyah in NW Saudi Arabia is thought to be its original location of manufacture. The pottery is bichrome / polychrome style and it dates as early as the 13th century BC; its many geometric, human, and animal motifs are painted in browns and dark reds on a pinkish-tan slip. &quot;Midianite&quot; pottery is found in its largest quantities at metallurgical sites in the southern Levant, especially Timna. Because of the Mycenaean motifs on Midianite pottery, some scholars including George Mendenhall, Peter Parr, and Beno Rothenberg have suggested that the Midianites were originally Sea Peoples who migrated from the Aegean region and imposed themselves on a pre-existing Semitic stratum. The question of the origin of the Midianites still remains open.

== Midian Mountains ==

The Midian Mountains () are a mountain range in northwestern Saudi Arabia. They are considered to be either contiguous with the Hijaz Mountains to the south, or a part of them. The Hijaz are treated as part of the Sarawat range, &quot;sensu lato&quot;.

<text>Charles William Ashworth (born August 10, 1956), known professionally as Charlie Peacock, is an American singer, songwriter, pianist, record producer, and author. His albums include &quot;Love Press Ex-Curio&quot;, &quot;Arc of the Circle&quot; and &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (2012). He is the founder of re:think, a record label that signed acts such as Switchfoot.

==Early life==
Peacock was born in Yuba City, California, and his father was a trumpeter and educator. As a youth he was inspired by the music of John Coltrane.

During junior and senior high Peacock received instrumental and theory instruction from his father and a local educator. Peacock, then known as Chuck Ashworth, left Yuba City High School after his junior year at the age of 16.

==Career==
After leaving California State University, Sacramento in 1976 Peacock began playing jazz piano in the band, The Runners. He met author Frank Kofsky at California State University in Sacramento and through him met various jazz artists such as Andrew Hill.

=== 1978 to 1999 ===

In 1978, songwriter Stephen Holsapple recorded Peacock&#x27;s vocal compositions and they began writing songs together. He began performing at Maurice&#x27;s American Bar and his song &quot;So Attractive&quot; was placed with a music publisher. Vocalist and songwriter Sal Valentino asked Peacock to join his band and gave Peacock&#x27;s music to his industry friends. In 1980 A&amp;M Records signed Peacock for a demo recording with producer David Kahne.

Peacock formed The Charlie Peacock Group with Erik Kleven (bass), Jim Caselli (drums), Darius Babazadeh (tenor saxophone) and guitarist, Mark Herzig. He also recorded with David Kahne at the Automatt and at Moon Studios with Stephen Holsapple during this period and those recordings became the album &quot;Last Vestiges of Honor&quot;, released in 1998. Peacock contracted with a production imprint company called Exit Records in early 1983. That year, he performed as a keyboardist and vocalist for Vector in the band&#x27;s 1983 release, &quot;Mannequin Virtue&quot;.

From 1990 to 1999, Peacock produced over fifty albums in the Christian and gospel music genre and founded the record company re:think (EMI/Sparrow) and signed the artists Sarah Masen and Switchfoot. Amy Grant&#x27;s 1991 single &quot;Every Heartbeat&quot; was co-written by Grant, Wayne Kirkpatrick and Peacock.

===2000 to present===
On March 9, 2004, Peacock released &quot;Full Circle: A Celebration of Songs and Friends&quot; commemorating his 20-year anniversary as a solo recording artist.
In 2005 Peacock released his first commercial jazz/improvisational music CD, &quot;Love Press Ex-Curio&quot;, short for Loves Pressure Exhibits Curiosity. According to jazz critics, &quot;while Peacock has consistently pushed the boundaries of pop and gospel music by adding elements of alternative rock, dance music and jazz, he has never before delved into jazz as unabashedly and wholeheartedly as he does on Love Press Ex-Curio&quot;.

In 2008, Peacock recorded the &quot;Arc of the Circle (Runway)&quot; with saxophonist Jeff Coffin and the album peaked at No. 2 on the CMJ Jazz Charts. The album&#x27;s original tracks, were recorded at Peacock&#x27;s Nashville home. The album also featured guitarist Marc Ribot, drummer Derrek Phillips, electronica player Tony Miracle, percussionist Ken Lewis, keyboardist/percussionist Chad Howat, and tuba player Joe Murphy. A review in Abstract Logix said the album contained &quot;high-risk improvisational music&quot; with &quot;eclectic influences&quot; that kept the sound &quot;bluesy and essentially American.&quot;

A &quot;Jazz Times&quot; review described it as &quot;an improvisational blend of modern classical and ECM-like influences&quot;.

In 2009, Peacock was the executive producer of music for the documentary &quot;Any Day Now&quot;. In 2010 he and businessman David Kiersznowski co-founded an artist development and music publishing company, Twenty Ten Music. Peacock wrote, directed and produced the film &quot;The Legend Hank Cochran&quot; and music producer/film producer/director for Brooke Waggoner&#x27;s concert DVD &quot;And the World Opened Up&quot;.

He executive produced and performed on Jon Foreman&#x27;s EPs &quot;Fall&quot;, &quot;Winter&quot;, &quot;Spring&quot;, and &quot;Summer&quot;.

Peacock, who had been in the audience during The Civil Wars&#x27; first ever concert, began producing the duo&#x27;s music during this period. He helmed The Civil Wars&#x27; 2011 debut album &quot;Barton Hollow&quot;, which reached No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Digital Albums chart, sold over 800,000 copies, and won the 2012 Grammy Awards for Best Folk Album and Best Country Duo/Group Performance.

In October 2012, Peacock released &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, his first vocal project since 1999. He reunited with The Civil Wars to produce their self-titled 2013 album. Upon its debut, it became the best-selling album in America, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart as well as &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Digital Albums and Canadian Albums charts, among others.

On January 8, 2014, he began production on &quot;American Idol&quot; Season 8 winner Kris Allen&#x27;s third album at his studio in Nashville. Allen&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Horizons&quot; was released August 12, 2014.

In late 2015, Peacock was appointed the Director of Contemporary Music and Industry Outreach at Lipscomb University&#x27;s College of Arts and Entertainment in Nashville, under his given surname, Ashworth.

==Personal life==
Peacock has been married to Andi Ashworth since the pair were teenagers. They are parents to two adult children, including Sam Ashworth.

Peacock began working with DATA and the ONE Campaign in 2002, placing co-founder Bono and ONE President David Lane in front of Nashville&#x27;s artist community.

<text>Eunice Norton (June 30, 1908 – December 9, 2005) was an American pianist.

== Life and career ==

Mrs. Norton was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She studied as a child at the University of Minnesota with William Lindsay, who later introduced her to Dame Myra Hess. Hess was so impressed with the 15-year-old Norton&#x27;s playing that she arranged for Norton to study in England in 1923 with Hess&#x27;s own mentor, the famed pedagogue Tobias Matthay, with whom Norton would remain in association for 8 years.

Mrs. Norton made her first appearance within that same year with the Queen’s Hall Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Sir Henry Wood, who subsequently took Norton on tour as soloist throughout the provinces. She played many recitals at that time in Wigmore Hall, and was soloist with the Manchester, Birmingham, and B.B.C. Symphonies under Sir Hamilton Harty and Sir Adrian Boult.

After winning the Chappell Gold Medal and the London Bach Prize in 1927, she performed in Vienna, The Hague, Paris, and Leipzig with the famous Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. In Berlin alone, she gave more than twenty concerts to dazzling critical reviews, including a Bach concert about which musicologist and critic Alfred Einstein wrote, &quot;Her Bach is played as Bach would have wished to hear it.&quot; In Amsterdam, Paderewski said after hearing her Chopin, &quot;You will play in all the great halls of the world.&quot;

As if fulfilling this prediction, Norton soon played in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Budapest. In the United States, she made her formal debut at Carnegie Hall and later premiered many new works at frequent concert appearances at Town Hall. She was invited by Koussevitzsky to play with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and was heard from coast to coast as recitalist and soloist with the New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, and Chicago symphonies under Dobrowen, Verbrugghen, Stokowski, Ormandy, Stock, Reiner, and Steinberg. One highlight from this period was her premiere
performance and recording with RCA Victor of Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Kammermusik No. 2&quot;, with Stokowski conducting.

An important milestone occurred in Mrs. Norton&#x27;s development when she heard Artur Schnabel&#x27;s performances of Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonatas in 1932. She spent three successive seasons under his tutelage in Berlin and Italy, and later enjoyed many rewarding years of friendship and association with him.

Yet, possibly the most important factor in Mrs. Norton&#x27;s evolution as an artist occurred during the years which she spent away from the concert stage developing her playing through more secluded work.

In 1934, Mrs. Norton married chemist Bernard Lewis and settled in Pittsburgh in 1942 to raise a family when he was hired by the U.S. Bureau of Mines. She continued to perform, soloing with the PSO under music director William Steinberg in 1954 and giving numerous local recitals. With her husband she founded Pittsburgh’s chapter of the New Friends of Music, which still exists today as the Pittsburgh Chamber Music Society, the city’s premiere chamber music series. She was an honorary member of the Tuesday Music Club. She later founded the Peacham Music Festival in Vermont, where many live recordings of her maturing performances were produced.

Mrs. Norton performed with the American Chamber Orchestra, the Juilliard, Budapest, Griller, and Curtis String Quartets, at the White House for President Hoover, a Schnabel memorial concert at Lincoln Center, an all Beethoven recital at Rockefeller University, and the first radio broadcast of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; in the USA.

She is well known for her master classes at her studios in Pennsylvania, Vermont, and at numerous universities throughout the United States, and taught at the University of Pittsburgh, the Catholic University of America, the University of Minnesota, and was Visiting Professor of Piano at Carnegie-Mellon University. Her series of four lectures on the teaching of Artur Schnabel was documented at the University of Pittsburgh in 1987, and her lecture on Matthay’s teaching was filmed in November 1995 at Carnegie-Mellon University.

She died in Vienna, Austria at 97.

<text>The Swedish Army () is the land force of the Swedish Armed Forces of the Kingdom of Sweden in Northern Europe / Scandinavia. The army&#x27;s history dates back to the Swedish War of Liberation in 1521.

== History ==
Svea Life Guards dates back to the year 1521, when the men of Dalarna chose 16 young able men as body guards for the insurgent nobleman Gustav Vasa in the Swedish War of Liberation against the Danish-dominated Union of Kalmar, thus making the present-day Life Guards one of the world&#x27;s oldest regiments still on active duty.

In 1901, Sweden introduced conscription. The conscription system was abolished in 2010 but reinstated in 2017.

==Organisation==
The peace-time organisation of the Swedish Army is divided into a number of regiments for the different branches. The number of active regiments has been reduced since the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s. However the Swedish Army has begun to expand once again, due to an increasing threat from the east with a resurgent Russian Federation and its attack on neighboring Ukraine in 2014 / 2022. Thus resulting in longtime neutral Sweden to become a full-fledged member of the 75 year old Western / Central European and North America democratic and military alliance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The regiment forms training organizations that train the various battalions of the army and home guard.

The Swedish Armed Forces recently underwent a transformation from conscription-based recruitment to a professional defence organisation increasing to an all-volunteer force. This is part of a larger goal to abandon the mass army from the Cold War era and develop an army better suited to modern maneuver warfare and at the same time retain a higher readiness. Since 2014, the Swedish Army has had around 50,000 soldiers in either full-time or part-time duty, with eight mechanized infantry battalions instantly available at any time and the full force of 71 battalions ready to be deployed within one week. The regular army consists of 8 mechanised maneuver battalions, 19 support battalions of different kinds including artillery battalions, anti-aircraft battalions, combat engineer battalions, rangers, logistics battalions and 4 reserve heavy armoured battalions and 40 territorial defence battalions. The battalion is the core unit but all units are completely modular and can be arranged in combat teams from company to brigade level with different units depending on the task. There are a total of 6 permanent staffs under the central command capable of handling large battlegroups, 4 regional staffs, 3 brigade staffs and 1 divisional staff.

===Leadership===

Until 1937 the King was the formal Head of the Army, and until 1974 of the Armed Forces at large. In 1937, the Chief of the Army position and headquarters staff (, &quot;CA&quot;) was created to lead the Army in peacetime. Following a larger reorganisation of the Swedish Armed Forces in 1994, CA ceased to exist as an independent agency, and all of the Armed Forces was centralized under the Supreme Commander (&quot;ÖB&quot;). Instead, the post Chief of Army Staff () was created at the then newly instituted Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters (&quot;HKV&quot;).

In 1998, the Swedish Armed Forces was yet again reorganized. Most of the duties of the Chief of Army Staff were transferred to the newly instituted post of &quot;Inspector General of the Army&quot; (). The post is similar to that of the &quot;Inspector General of the Swedish Navy&quot; () and the &quot;Inspector General of the Swedish Air Force&quot; (), later renamed to &quot;Inspector of the Army&quot; (). In 2014, the Chief of Army (, &quot;AC&quot;) position was reinstated.

=== Operational formations ===
The Swedish Army distinguishes an administrative from an operational structure. The administrative structure includes the peacetime depot units (&quot;depåförband&quot;), which are responsible for the training, equipment and combat readiness of the forces. Depot units are the army regiments, the air force flotillas, the naval flotillas or the armed forces centers. The depot units generate wartime units (&quot;krigsförband&quot;), which are transferred to their respective wartime formations, so normally the Swedish army regiments are composed of administrative and training companies during peacetime and their battalions are only formed for exercises and during wartime. The operational units in their entirety are known as the operational organisation of the armed forces (&quot;Försvarsmaktens Insatsorganisation&quot; (&quot;FM IO&quot; or just &quot;IO&quot;, followed by the year it has been introduced in, as &quot;IO 2018&quot; or just &quot;IO 18&quot; for example) in Swedish). The operational organisation of the army plans for the training regiments to form two combat brigades (2nd and 3rd Brigades) and a number of independent combat battalions within a few days. This plan, however, was considered by the Supreme Commander to be impossible due to the economic situation at the time.

In 2013, the Armed Forces issued a statement saying that the reorganisation would only suffice for a reasonable defence of Swedish territory for one week. The force was to include the following units:

As of 2022 the 1st Division was reintroduced as an operational unit. The Division currently contains four brigades; The Norbotten Brigade (&quot;Norbottensbrigaden NMekB 19&quot;), The South Scanian Brigade (&quot;Södra Skånska Brigaden MekB 7&quot;, The Life Guards Brigade (&quot;Livgardesbrigaden IB 1&quot;) and The Skaraborg Brigade (&quot;Skaraborgsbrigaden MekB 4&quot;)

==Size==

The army on active service during most of the 20th century only consisted of conscript receiving their basic training (at the most one year for privates), and conscripts called up for refreshers (at the most one month for privates) with intervals of at least 4–6 years. During WWII smaller or larger parts of the wartime establishment were also called up for periodical stand-by duty (up to 6 months). The figures for total strength below refer to the total force which could be mobilised.
Between the introduction of universal conscription in 1902 until the start of World War II, the army was usually maintained at a consistent strength of 100,000 men, with two-thirds of the force being conscripts for two years. From 1942 onwards, the Swedish government embarked upon a massive and ambitious militarisation program in which conscription was strictly enforced and compulsory service was extended. The basic training for privates was set at 12 months, for future conscript sergeants intended to become platoon leaders (mainly sixth form graduates) 18 months, and for future conscript officers 24 months. These periods were gradually reduced, and the ranks were raised, until it was the same period for all conscripts shortly before conscription was suspended in 2009. This combined with propaganda about conscription being a part of social duty and defending the Swedish principle of &quot;folkhemmet&quot;, led to an army a size of about 700,000 active duty soldiers that could be mobilised in late 1945. Since the late winter of 1945 the size of the army was slowly decreased as entire reserve battalions and brigades were gradually demobilised, and by late 1947 the size of the army was around 170,000 soldiers who could be mobilised and was planned to stabilise at such a quantity of personnel.

However, due to the rise in tensions between the East and West over the political landscape of Europe, the threat from the Soviet Union in 1949 and 1950, coinciding with the start of the Cold War, led to a return to the militaristic policy by the Swedish government. From 1950 until around 1976 the size of the army was at an average of 250,000 soldiers with a peak of 400,000 mobilisable soldiers during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The rules were badly enforced, but dodging the draft was punishable with imprisonment.

During the 1980s the size of the army was around 180,000 soldiers and was slowly increased as time progressed until around 1988. The end of the Cold War led to a massive restructuring of the Swedish Army. Every year after 1988, the Army discharged around 40,000 conscripts and recruited only 20,000, so that by 1995 the size was down to 80,000 soldiers. Around this time the compulsory service obligation was further reduced to 10 months, reserve service became more flexible, and changes made in enforcement so that forceful enforcement became withdrawn as policy. By 2004 the size of the Swedish Army was down to 60,000 soldiers, and in 2013, three years after the end of conscription, the size was at an all-time low of just 16,000 soldiers, though the army plans to reach a level of 50,000 professional soldiers by 2020, mostly through a large media campaigns. A number of previously disbanded regiments will also be re-raised (Dalarna Regiment, Västernorrland Regiment, Norrland Dragoon Regiment, and Bergslagen Artillery Regiment) with the Jämtland Ranger Regiment re-raised as a battalion of Västernorrland Regiment.

==Recruitment==
From the 17th century until 1901, Swedish Army recruitment was based upon the allotment system. In 1812, conscription was introduced for all males between age 20 and 25 to serve in the armed forces twelve days a year, increased in 1858 to four weeks per two years. The allotment system was abolished in 1901 and replaced with universal conscription for all males. All personnel were drafted as conscripts for a year of conscription, after which the unit the soldier trained with was put in reserve. Upon completion of conscript service with sufficient service marks, conscripts are eligible to apply for commissioned officer training, NCO/Warrant Officer or from 2007 stay in the Army as a professional private, mainly to be employed in the Nordic Battle Group. The army has employed soldiers for UN service on short time contracts since the 1950s for service abroad.

From July 2010 until 2017, the Swedish Army was an all-professional fighting force. The government announced on 2 March 2017 that conscription was going to be reinstated. Of a pool of around 13,000 men and women born 1999, 4,000 were going to be selected for conscription starting January 2018. The government stated that the number of conscripts may increase in response to foreign events.

<text>The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County (METRO) is a major public transportation agency based in Houston, Texas, United States. It operates bus, light rail, bus rapid transit, HOV and HOT lanes, and paratransit service (under the name METROLift) in the city as well as most of Harris County. It also operates bus service to two cities in Fort Bend County, and to Conroe in Montgomery County. The Metro headquarters are in the Lee P. Brown Administration Building in Downtown Houston. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== History ==

The Texas State Legislature authorized the creation of local transit authorities in 1973. In 1978, Houston-area voters created Metro and approved a one-cent sales tax to support its operations. Metro opened for business in January 1979, taking over the bus service owned by the City of Houston known as HouTran. HouTran was plagued by outdated equipment, infrequent service and a route structure which failed to account for Houston&#x27;s rapid population growth.

Metro&#x27;s service area encompasses and also serves portions of an eight-county region with its vanpool service; the agency employs about 3,800 people.

=== Executive leadership ===
Tom Jasien is the current President and CEO of the agency, since December 2023. 

Previously, Thomas Lambert held the position for a decade, being formally appointed in February 2014, although he had been operating as the agency&#x27;s interim CEO since the beginning of 2013. Lambert, a Houston native with a political science degree from Southwest Texas State University and master&#x27;s in public administration from the University of Houston, joined Metro as a security investigator in 1979. He was named agency police chief in 1982, ultimately overseeing close to 100 officers, then moved into higher ranks of management.

The Metro Board has nine members – five are appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by Houston City Council, two are appointed by Harris County Commissioners Court, and two are appointed by the 14 mayors of Metro&#x27;s smaller city members.

== Metro Bus ==

Metro&#x27;s local bus service usually runs on city streets, typically stopping at every other corner along its entire route. The bus system is the most used in Texas and the Southwest region. Metro also operates express bus routes on the Houston region&#x27;s freeway high-occupancy vehicle lanes, which stop at park-and-ride lots.

Prior to the construction of Metrorail, Metro consisted of the largest all-bus fleet in the United States, only because Houston was the largest major city devoid of any rail transit since 1990.

Circa 1991 bus services for handicapped people were implemented.

In 2015, the bus system was redesigned, eliminating low-ridership routes in favor of a high-frequency, high-demand bus network. This change was accomplished without any increase in operating costs.

=== Service types ===
*Local: Most Metro buses typically operate on city streets, with the majority of routes serving several of Houston&#x27;s major employment centers. The routes are grid-like &quot;crosstown&quot; routes that travel from one part of the city to another, typically without entering downtown. Many routes were truncated to METRORail stations to eliminate duplicate service.
*Express: A local limited stop service that serves key destinations but travel nonstop on freeway segments. They were formerly categorized as Limited prior to the 2015 restructuring of bus routes.
*Park and Ride (Commuter): Metro operates express service between major destinations and outlying areas via high-occupancy vehicle lanes on regional freeways. Buses on these routes stop at park-and-ride lots, which also serve as transit centers.
*Bus Rapid Transit: A pilot program introduced on June 1, 2009, to provide faster service with upgraded buses and fewer, more modern stops to busy corridors, beginning with a supplement of Route 2 (Bellaire), 402 Quickline Bellaire BRT. The second route in this system was a replacement of Route 33 (Post Oak), 433 Silver Line Post Oak BRT, which unlike Route 402, utilizes an exclusive busway for a majority of the route. The next planned line was the University Line, which was planned to start construction in 2025 and open in 2029. However, in June 2024, Metro announced that they had abandoned plans for the University Line.

=== Routes ===

Metro&#x27;s bus routes are numbered based on their service type and arranged in a grid. On August 24, 2015, Metro revamped their entire bus network with new routes and frequent service. Under the new network, all local routes run 7 days a week with the exception of two express routes.

Metro provided the free Greenlink shuttle services in Downtown Houston, but discontinued the service in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Metro&#x27;s express and commuter buses consist of MCI and New Flyer &quot;Viking&quot; buses, which have reclining seats, small individual lights, as well as small air conditioning vents for each seat. Viking buses went out of service in May 2015. In , the bus system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

=== Park and Ride lots ===

Metro operates 28 different park and ride locations.
=== Advertising policy ===
Metro has had a policy since its founding in which it refuses to place advertisements on buses, claiming that such a move would create an unsightly appearance on the buses. Metro had originally attempted to generate extra revenue by only advertising in its bus shelters, but a city ordinance blocked the decision. After a failed attempt to get permission to partially use advertisements on buses, Metro has since decided to continue enforcing its policy.

Due to the lack of funding for METRORail expansion, the policy has been proposed to be expanded to light rail vehicles in order to generate additional revenue. Metro began advertising the Houston Zoo on the side of three light rail vehicles in 2010. In late September 2010, due to the decreased budget, Metro began to seriously consider advertising on their buses.

=== Rates ===
In the fall of 2006, Metro revealed plans to rework its fare system. The new system involves pre-paid fare cards (contactless smart cards), called Q Cards, that can be recharged on local buses and Metro TVMs. 3-hour passes are electronically added to the card each time it is used. Frequent users get &quot;Rider Rewards&quot; that offer five free rides for every 50 paid trips.

Senior citizens 65–69 will continue to receive a discounted rate as will disabled patrons. Senior citizens over 70 may ride for free. Children under 5 also ride for free when accompanied by an adult (limit 3). This was intended to keep the base fare low and phase out the previous fare system consisting of transfers (was reinstated from July 2015 to March 2016), as well as day (reinstated on October 7, 2013), weekly, monthly and annual passes, which occurred in early 2008. On November 2, 2008, local fares increased to $1.25 from $1. Currently another fare increase is being mulled as a means to pay for constructing the expansion of the light rail.

== HOV system ==

Metro has been known for pioneering the use of express buses in HOV lanes. This was part of the reversible HOV lane concept that began in 1979 with the completion of the North Freeway (I-45) Contraflow Lane. This concept used the inside freeway lane of the &quot;opposite&quot; direction separated by traffic pylons and is closed to all vehicles except buses and vanpools. Although a head-on collision involving a car and a bus occurred in 1980, the concept became permanent, but with the HOV lanes separated from the rest of traffic with Jersey barriers.

The HOV lanes run between Downtown Houston (inbound A.M. and outbound P.M.) and the suburbs and are found on portions of the Katy Freeway, Gulf Freeway, North Freeway, Southwest Freeway, Eastex Freeway and Northwest Freeway.

Since Metro Express buses use them during rush hour, most routes lead to the Park and Ride lots and use &quot;secret&quot; HOV lane exits (often elevated T-intersections) that lead to the lots (also used by vehicles) without having to exit the freeway to street intersections. The HOV system will soon get an overhaul in the event of major freeway construction to take place in Houston and may have HOV lanes in both directions with the concept of HOT (Toll) lanes introduced.

In 2011, Metro began conversion of the HOV lanes to High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes. Commuters with only one person in a vehicle will be able to pay a toll to use the lanes when the conversion is complete.

== METROLift ==

Metro Lift provides transportation needs for people with a disability, who cannot board, or ride from a regular Metro bus. The Metro Lift vehicles are shared-ride, meaning that they take multiple customers and groups. Metro tells its customers to use standard Metro bus services whenever possible. Metro Lift uses special vehicles that are distinct from fixed-route Metro buses. The Authority&#x27;s METROLift paratransit service will have provided 1.9 million trips to 16,178 eligible riders in FY2017, using both METRO-owned lift-equipped vans and contractor-owned and operated accessible minivans.

== METRORail ==
Metro&#x27;s light rail service is known as METRORail.

Metro offers a trip planner on its web site that provides information for public transit in the region it serves. It is multi-modal, combining schedule information for buses and rail. Riders enter their intended origin and destination, along with optional time, date, the trip planner displays, itineraries showing the stops, departure and arrival times, times to get from the origin to the destination and other information.

Today, the average daily weekday ridership is 59,753 and 18.3 million annually. On November 9, 2007, Metro surpassed its 40 million boardings mark, something it did not expect to happen until 2020. Notable records in ridership have occurred on the following dates:
*February 1, 2004: 64,005 passengers rode Metro during Super Bowl XXXVIII
*February 23, 2004: 54,193 passenger boardings were recorded, the highest weekday at the time
*February 27, 2007: 56,388 passengers were recorded the day of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo
* February 4, 2017: 109,417 passengers were recorded during festivities preceding Super Bowl LI.
*November 3, 2017: 125,000 passengers were recorded the day of the parade for the Houston Astros, champions of the 2017 World Series.

=== METRORail lines ===

Metro currently operates three light rail lines: the Red Line, Purple Line and Green Line. The Red Line, the Authority&#x27;s first light rail line, began operation on January 1, 2004. Now extended to 12.8 miles, the line begins at the Northline Transit Center, serving HCC Northeast and Northline Commons mall, and then continues south through Houston&#x27;s Central Business District, Midtown, the Museum District, Rice University, the Texas Medical Center and the NRG Park Complex to the Fannin South Transit Center It is the second major light rail service in Texas following the DART system. The arrival of Metro light rail comes approximately sixty years after the previous streetcar system was shut down, which left Houston as the largest city in the United States without a rail system since 1990, when Los Angeles&#x27; Blue Line opened.

Metro opened two additional light rail lines in 2015, the Purple (Southeast) and Green (East End) Lines. Destinations served by these new lines include Texas Southern University, the University of Houston, PNC Stadium, and the Theater District. These new lines added another 9.9 miles of light rail. In total, Metro operates 22.7 miles of light rail service. Metro will reach approximately 18.6 million light rail boardings in FY17.

Two other lines were to be completed by 2012, but funding issues dropped the number to the northern extension of the Red Line and two of the original four new lines. The extension of the Red Line was opened on December 21, 2013 and the East End/Green Line opened on May 23, 2015. Due to federal investigations and the lack of funds, the plans may degenerate further. Three of the five lines were previously going to be bus-rapid transit, but due to high ridership possibilities, the decision was made to make them all light rail.

== Expansion ==

=== METRO Solutions ===
METRO Solutions was a regional transit plan approved by voters in November 2003 by a 52–48 vote. The plan proposed: 
* of Light Rail Transit
* of Commuter Rail Transit (CRT)
* 9 New Transit Centers
* 9 New Park &amp; Rides Lots
* 250 miles of two-way HOV lanes
In June 2005, METRO announced a revised plan for expansion of the METRORail system. The plan included one new light rail corridor and three bus rapid transit corridors. The bus rapid transit lines would have later been converted into light rail when ridership warranted the conversion.

On October 18, 2007, the plan was revised to allow for the possibility of more federal funding. METRO decided to have all the lines consist of light rail from the start after some public backlash to the agency turning back from its original plans of light rail corridors.

By 2017, only 15 miles of light rail were completed with no commuter rail lines established. 8 new transit centers, 7 new park &amp; ride lots, and only one new two-way HOV corridor were completed as well.

=== METRONext ===
The public with a 68% vote approved the METRONext plan in November 2019. The plan calls for:

* 110 miles of Regional Express Network, including two-way HOV lanes
* 21 new or improved Park &amp; Ride lots and Transit Centers
* 16 miles of light rail expansion
* 75 miles of a bus rapid transit network METRORapid
* 290 miles of BOOST and Signature bus service

The referendum authorized the agency to issue up to $3.5 billion in bonds to pay for the projects while the remaining $4 billion will come from federal grants and local funds.

== Metro Police ==
Metro operates its own police department. With over 185 Texas peace officers and 88 non-sworn, civilian employees, the department&#x27;s main goal is to ensure safety and security on the transit system. The department was established in 1982 and is accredited with the Texas Police Chiefs Association  (TPCA), one of only five public transit police departments in North America to be so.

State law grants Metro Police jurisdiction in the counties in which Metro is located, provides services, or is supported by a general sales and use tax. As peace officers, state law also grants Metro Police the power to arrest without warrant for any felony, breach of the peace, disorderly conduct or intoxication offense that is committed in their presence or view while in Texas. They may also make an arrest pursuant to a warrant anywhere in Texas.

== Headquarters ==
The Metro headquarters are in the Lee P. Brown Administration Building in Downtown Houston. The $41 million 14 story glass and steel building has over of space. The facility includes the Downtown Transit Center, a Metro Ride store, a Houston Police Department storefront and toilets for transiting passengers. The building was designed by Pierce Goodwin Alexander &amp; Linville. As of August 2010, two floors of the building are not occupied and are not used in any way.

The building was scheduled to open in early 2004, coinciding with the beginning of the METRORail. The groundbreaking was held in 2002. Patti Muck, a spokesperson for METRO, said that the agency would save $273 million, assuming that the agency occupied the building for a 30-year span instead of renting for the same length of time. The Federal Transit Administration, a part of the federal government of the United States, paid 80% of the construction costs, while Metro paid the other 20%.

The “Houston in Harmony” mural l in honor of Mayor Lee P Brown was commissioned by the Honey Brown Hope Foundation and its founder, Tammie Lang Campbell, in 1999. It was moved March 23, 2005, to the Lee P. Brown Metropolitan Transit Authority Administration Building, where it is on permanent display.

Previously the Metro headquarters were in the Louisiana Place (now the Total Plaza), also in Downtown Houston. The agency occupied 10 floors in the building and did not receive any federal funds to cover the $3.8 million annual rent. The Metro Board Room was located on the 16th floor. Total Petrochemicals USA, a subsidiary of TotalEnergies, moved into the space that was previously occupied by METRO; the agency scheduled its move into the Brown building to occur in January 2005. Metro&#x27;s lease of of space expired in April 2005.

== Ridership and demographics ==

A Regional Fixed Route Transit Rider survey sponsored by the Houston-Galveston Area Council (H-GAC), in partnership with METRO, was completed in 2017. Over 22,000 riders were surveyed—the most expansive ever conducted on a regional basis—and included eight regional fixed-route transit agencies which operate in H-GAC&#x27;s eight-county region. The survey found that 58 percent of riders use transit to get to work, 20 percent use it for shopping or personal business, and about 10 percent of riders use a bus or train to get to school. 88 percent of riders reported that they rode transit at least three days per week with almost 50 percent of riders riding at least five days per week. The survey&#x27;s findings concluded that 88 percent of all the trips were directly contributing to the region&#x27;s economy.

== Member cities ==
Metro provides transportation services to fifteen member cities, as well as some unincorporated portions of Harris County. Metro&#x27;s service area pays a 1¢ sales tax to fund the agency&#x27;s operations.

In addition to the city of Houston, Metro serves fourteen cities in the Greater Houston area, collectively termed the &quot;Multi-Cities&quot;:

* Bellaire
* Bunker Hill Village
* El Lago
* Hedwig Village
* Hilshire Village
* Humble
* Hunters Creek Village
* Katy
* Missouri City
* Piney Point Village
* Southside Place
* Spring Valley Village
* Taylor Lake Village
* West University Place

Metro also operates a park-and-ride shuttle between Houston and Conroe. However, Conroe is not a formal member; instead, the shuttle is funded on a yearly basis through an interlocal agreement.

<text>The Avengers are a team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby. The team made its debut in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #1 (cover-dated September 1963). Labeled &quot;Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot;, the original Avengers consisted of Iron Man, Ant-Man, Hulk, Thor, and Wasp. Captain America was discovered trapped in ice in issue #4, and joined the group after they revived him. The Avengers are an all-star ensemble cast of established superhero characters from the Marvel Comics portfolio. Diegetically, these superheroes usually operate independently but occasionally assemble as a team to tackle especially formidable villains. This in contrast to certain other superhero teams such as the X-Men, whose characters were created specifically to be part of their team, with the team being central to their identity. The Avengers were created to create a new line of books to sell and to cross-promote Marvel Comics characters.

An Iron Man fan might buy an Avengers book because Iron Man appears in them, and perhaps in turn take an interest in Thor, who appears in the same book as Iron Man&#x27;s friend and comrade. The cast usually features a few highly popular characters who have their own solo books, such as Iron Man, alongside a number of lesser-known characters who benefit from exposure, such as Quicksilver, Wonder Man, and Tigra.

The Avengers have appeared in a wide variety of media outside of comic books, including several different animated television series and direct-to-video films. Beginning in 2008, the group were adapted in a film series from Marvel Studios, known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, culminating with &quot;The Avengers&quot; in 2012, with more appearances of the team in subsequent films.

== Publication history ==
The team debuted in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #1 (September 1963). Much like the Justice League, the Avengers were an assemblage of superheroes who each had an existing series of his own. All of the characters were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. This initial series, published bi-monthly through issue #6 (July 1964) and monthly thereafter ran through issue #402 (Sept. 1996), with spinoffs including several annuals, miniseries and a giant-size quarterly sister series that ran briefly in the mid-1970s. Writers of the first series included Roy Thomas, Steve Englehart, Gerry Conway, Jim Shooter, David Michelinie, and Roger Stern. Artists included John Buscema, Tom Palmer, Neal Adams, George Perez, John Byrne and Steve Epting.

Other spinoff series include &quot;West Coast Avengers&quot;, initially published as a four-issue miniseries in 1984, followed by a 102-issue series (Oct. 1985–Jan. 1994), retitled &quot;Avengers West Coast&quot; with #47; and the 40-issue &quot;Solo Avengers&quot; (Dec.1987–Jan. 1991), retitled &quot;Avengers Spotlight&quot; with #21.

Between 1996 and 2004, Marvel relaunched the primary Avengers title three times. In 1996, the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; line took place in an alternate universe, with a revamped history unrelated to mainstream Marvel continuity.

&quot;The Avengers&quot; vol. 3 ran for 84 issues from February 1998 to August 2004. Early issues were written by Kurt Busiek and penciled by George Perez. To coincide with what would have been the 500th issue of the original series, Marvel changed the numbering, and &quot;The Avengers&quot; #500–503 (Sept.– Dec. 2004), the one-shot &quot;Avengers Finale&quot; (Jan. 2005) became the &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot; storyline and final issues. In January 2005, a new version of the team appeared in the ongoing title &quot;The New Avengers&quot;, followed by &quot;The Mighty Avengers&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Dark Avengers&quot;. &quot;Avengers&quot; vol. 4 debuted in July 2010 and ran until January 2013. Vol. 5 was launched in February 2013. After Secret Wars, a new Avengers team debuted, dubbed the &quot;All-New, All-Different Avengers&quot;, starting with a Free Comic Book Day preview. Following &quot;Civil War II&quot;, the book was relaunched in 2016 as &quot;Avengers&quot;, while retaining the same writer and much of the cast from the &quot;All-New, All-Different&quot; run. The series ran for 11 issues before reverting to the numbering of the original &quot;Avengers&quot; series with issue #672. Starting with issue #675, all four Avengers titles being published at the time (&quot;Avengers&quot;, &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot;, &quot;U.S. Avengers&quot; and &quot;Occupy Avengers&quot;) were merged into a single weekly series dubbed &quot;Avengers: No Surrender, lasting 16 issues&quot;, designed to close out this era of the team&#x27;s history.

Following the conclusion of &quot;No Surrender&quot; in 2018, the series was relaunched again as &quot;Avengers&quot;.

== Fictional history ==

=== 1960s ===
When the Asgardian god Loki seeks revenge against his brother Thor, his machinations unwittingly lead teenager Rick Jones to collect Ant-Man (Hank Pym), the Wasp, and Iron Man to help Thor and the Hulk, the latter of whom Loki used as a pawn. After the group vanquished Loki, Ant-Man stated that the five worked well together and suggested they form a team; the Wasp named the group &quot;Avengers&quot;.

The roster changed almost immediately; in the second issue (November 1963), Ant-Man became Giant-Man, and at the end of the issue, the Hulk left once he realized how much the others feared his unstable personality. Captain America joined the team in issue #4 (March 1964), and he was given &quot;founding member&quot; status in the Hulk&#x27;s place. The Hulk, upset about being replaced by Captain America and the apparent betrayal by Rick, sought revenge against the Avengers, who teamed up with the Fantastic Four to stop him in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #26 (May 1964). The Avengers went on to fight foes such as Baron Zemo, who formed the Masters of Evil, Kang the Conqueror, Wonder Man, and Count Nefaria.

The next milestone came when every member but Captain America resigned; they were replaced by three former villains: Hawkeye and the Maximoff twins, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Giant-Man, now calling himself Goliath, and the Wasp rejoined. Hercules became part of the team, while the Black Knight and Black Widow abetted the Avengers but did not become members until years later. Spider-Man was offered membership but did not join the group. The Black Panther joined after rescuing the team from the Grim Reaper and Klaw. &quot;The X-Men&quot; #45 (June 1968) featured a crossover with &quot;The Avengers&quot; #53 (June 1968). This was followed by the introduction of the android Vision. Pym assumed the new identity of Yellowjacket in issue #59, and married the Wasp the following month.

The Avengers headquarters was in a New York City building called Avengers Mansion, courtesy of Tony Stark (Iron Man&#x27;s real identity). The mansion was serviced by Edwin Jarvis, the Avengers&#x27; faithful butler, and furnished with state of the art technology and defense systems, and included the Avengers&#x27; primary mode of transport: the five-engine Quinjet.

The prequel comic &quot;Avengers&quot; #1 1/2 (Dec. 1999), by writer Roger Stern and artist Bruce Timm, told a retro-style story taking place between issues #1 and #2, detailing Ant-Man&#x27;s decision to transform himself into Giant-Man.

=== 1970s ===
The team encountered new characters such as Arkon in issue #75 (April 1970) and Red Wolf in #80 (Sept. 1970). The team&#x27;s adventures increased in scope as the team crossed into an alternate dimension and battled the Squadron Supreme, and fought in the Kree-Skrull War, an epic battle between the alien Kree and Skrull races and guest-starred the Kree hero, Captain Marvel. The Avengers briefly disband when Skrulls impersonating Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man used their authority as founders of the team and disbanded it. The true founding Avengers, minus the Wasp, reformed the team in response after complaints from Jarvis.

Mantis joined the team along with the reformed Swordsman. &quot;The Avengers-Defenders Clash&quot; storyline crossed over between the two team titles. &quot;The Celestial Madonna&quot; arc linked Mantis&#x27; origins to the very beginnings of the Kree-Skrull conflict in a time-spanning adventure involving Kang the Conqueror, and Immortus, who were past and future versions of each other. Mantis was revealed to be the Celestial Madonna, who was destined to give birth to a being that would save the universe. It was revealed that the Vision&#x27;s body had only been appropriated, and not created by Ultron, and that it had belonged to the 1940s Human Torch. With his origins clear to him, the Vision proposed to the Scarlet Witch. The &quot;Celestial Madonna&quot; saga ended with their wedding, presided over by Immortus. The Beast and Moondragon joined the team soon after. A seven-part story featured the Squadron Supreme and the Serpent Crown.

Other classic storylines included &quot;The Bride of Ultron&quot;, the &quot;Nefaria Trilogy&quot;, and &quot;The Korvac Saga&quot;, which featured nearly every Avenger who joined the team up to that point. Henry Peter Gyrich became the Avengers&#x27; liaison to the United States National Security Council. Gyrich was prejudiced against superhumans and acted in a heavy-handed, obstructive manner, and insisted that the Avengers follow government rules and regulations or else lose their priority status with the government. Among Gyrich&#x27;s demands was that the active roster be trimmed down to only seven members, and that the Falcon, an African American, be admitted to the team to comply with affirmative action laws. This last act was resented by Hawkeye, who because of the seven-member limit lost his membership slot to the Falcon. The Falcon, in turn, was unhappy to be the beneficiary of what he perceived to be tokenism, and decided to resign from the team, after which Wonder Man rejoined. The true origins of Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch were revealed in a three-part story that ran in issues #185–187 (July–Sept. 1979). After this adventure, the Scarlet Witch took a leave of absence and Ms. Marvel officially joined the team as her replacement.

=== 1980s ===
The first major development was the breakdown of Hank Pym, with his frequent changes of costume and name being symptomatic of an identity problem and an inferiority complex. After he abused his wife, failed to win back the confidence of the Avengers with a ruse and was duped by the villain Egghead, Pym was jailed. Pym would later outwit Egghead and defeated the latest incarnation of the Masters of Evil single-handedly, and proved his innocence. Pym reconciled with the Wasp, but they decided to remain apart. Pym retired from super-heroics, but returned years later.

This was followed by several major storylines, such as &quot;Ultimate Vision&quot; in which the Vision took over the world&#x27;s computer systems in a misguided attempt to create world peace; the formation of the West Coast Avengers; and &quot;Avengers Under Siege&quot; which involved the second Baron Zemo and the Masters of Evil taking over the mansion and severely injuring Jarvis and Hercules. &quot;Assault on Olympus&quot; featured Hercules&#x27; father, Zeus, blaming the Avengers for his son&#x27;s injuries and brought them to Olympus for trial, and the &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; arc saw the Super Adaptoid organized several robotic villains for an assault on the team. New members during the 1980s included Tigra; the She-Hulk; Monica Rambeau (then going by the name Captain Marvel); Starfox (the brother of Thanos); Hawkeye&#x27;s wife, Mockingbird; and Namor, while Hank Pym emerged from retirement to join the West Coast Avengers. Spider-Man was again offered membership, but failed to gain admission due to security concerns by the Avengers&#x27; government liaison.

The villain Nebula falsely claimed to be the granddaughter of Thanos. The team relocated for a period to a floating island off the coast of New York called Hydrobase after Avengers Mansion was severely damaged during the events in &quot;Under Siege&quot;. Hydrobase was later sunk during the &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot; crossover.

The Avengers and West Coast Avengers changed to allow members to be active when available and reserved when not available and merged the two separate Avengers teams into one team with two bases. The Vision had his personality fundamentally altered, along with the discovery that the children of the Scarlet Witch and the Vision were actually illusions. The loss of the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s children and the Vision, who was disassembled by government agents in retaliation for the &quot;Ultimate Vision&quot; storyline, drove her insane, although she eventually recovered and rejoined the team. This story revealed that the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s powers included wide-range reality manipulation and she was what the time-traveling Immortus refers to as a &quot;nexus being&quot; setting the stage for 2004&#x27;s eventual &quot;Chaos&quot; and &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot; storylines. This played out in the &quot;Darker than Scarlet&quot; storyline which ran in &quot;Avengers West Coast&quot; from issues #51–62 (Nov. 1989–Sept. 1990). The Avengers titles in late 1989 were involved in the major crossover event &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot; where Loki assembled many of Marvel&#x27;s arch-villains, his inner circle consisted of Doctor Doom, Magneto, Kingpin, Mandarin, Wizard, and Red Skull, in a plot to destroy the team. Loki orchestrated a mass breakout of villains from prison facility, the Vault, as part of his &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot; scheme, but he ultimately failed in his goal to destroy the Avengers.

=== 1990s ===
The U.S. government revoked the Avengers&#x27; New York State charter in a treaty with the Soviet Union. The Avengers then received a charter from the United Nations and the Avengers split into two teams again with a substitute reserve team backing up the main teams.

At this point, ongoing storylines and character development focused on the Black Knight, Sersi, Crystal, Hercules, Vision, and Black Widow. Their primary antagonists in this run were the mysterious Proctor and his team of other-dimensional Avengers known as the Gatherers. During this period, the Avengers found themselves facing increasingly murderous enemies and were forced to question their rule against killing.

This culminated in &quot;&quot;, a 19-part storyline that ran through all Avengers-related titles and showcased a conflict between the Kree and the Shi&#x27;ar Empire. The team split when Iron Man and several dissidents executed the Supreme Intelligence against the wishes of Captain America. After a vote disbanded the West Coast Avengers, Iron Man formed a proactive and aggressive team called Force Works. During the team&#x27;s first mission, Wonder Man was killed again, though his atoms were temporarily scattered. Force Works later disbanded after it was revealed that Iron Man became a murderer via the manipulations of the villain Kang, the same storyline seeing Iron Man sacrificing himself and being replaced by his teenage counterpart from a parallel timeline.

During the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; event, many of the Avengers together with the Fantastic Four and others, died trying to stop the psychic entity Onslaught, although it was revealed that Franklin Richards preserved those heroes in a pocket universe. Believing the main team to be gone, the Black Widow disbanded the Avengers, and only butler Edwin Jarvis remained to tend to the Mansion.

The previous continuity of the Marvel Universe was set aside as the heroes were &quot;reborn&quot; in the pocket universe created by Franklin Richards to save his parents and their friends, while the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; line ended and the heroes returned to the prime Marvel Universe. This restoration also undid recent changes to the team members such as the Wasp being mutated into an insectoid state, Hawkeye being rendered deaf, and Stark being replaced by his teenage self, attributed to Franklin&#x27;s childish perception recreating the heroes in the manner he was more familiar with.

After the Heroes Reborn series concluded, the Avengers comic was restarted with vol. 3 #1 written by Kurt Busiek and pencilled by George Pérez. New members during this run included the revived Wonder Man, Justice, Firestar, Silverclaw, and Triathlon. The Avengers fought many of their traditional villains such as the Grim Reaper, Ultron, Count Nefaria, and Kang the Conqueror. The limited series &quot;Avengers Forever&quot;, starting during this period, was a time travel story that explored the history of the Avengers and resolved many outstanding questions about Kang and Immortus&#x27;s past manipulations of the team, featuring various Avengers from the past (Captain America immediately after &quot;Secret Empire&quot;, Hank Pym early in his Yellowjacket delusion, and Hawkeye just after the Kree-Skrull war), present (Hank Pym as Giant-Man and Janet as the Wasp) and possible futures (Genis-Vell and Songbird) working alongside Kang the Conqueror and Rick Jones as part of Kang&#x27;s attempt to escape his perceived &#x27;destiny&#x27; as Immortus.

=== 2000s ===
The Avengers were granted international authority by the United Nations. Members joining during that period included Jack of Hearts and the second Ant-Man. A new Captain Britain was added to the team. The &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot; storyline followed. Titled &quot;Chaos&quot;, the story featured the deaths of some members and a loss of credibility for the team. The culprit is revealed to be the Scarlet Witch, who had gone insane after agonizing over the memory of her lost children and who subsequently lost control of her reality-altering powers. With the team in disarray and Avengers Mansion ruined, the surviving members agreed to disband.

A new Avengers team formed, in the series &quot;New Avengers&quot; after a group of heroes banded together to thwart a break-out at super-villain prison the Raft, composed of Iron Man, Captain America, Luke Cage, Wolverine, Ronin, Spider-Man, Spider-Woman, and the mysterious Sentry. This was soon followed by the &quot;House of M&quot; event.

In the company-wide &quot;Civil War&quot; story arc, Marvel superheroes were split over compliance with the U.S. government&#x27;s new Superhuman Registration Act, which required all superpowered persons to register their true identities with the federal government and become agents of same. The New Avengers disbanded, with a rebel underground starring in a series retaining &quot;The New Avengers&quot; in its trademarked cover logo and &quot;New Avengers&quot; in its copyright indicia. Luke Cage led this team, consisting of himself, Echo, Ronin, Spider-Man, Spider-Woman, Wolverine, Iron Fist, and Doctor Strange. During the long-term Secret Invasion by the shape-shifting alien race the Skrulls, it was revealed that Spider-Woman had been abducted and replaced by the Skrull queen Veranke before she even joined the team. After the Skrulls&#x27; defeat, Spider-Woman was rescued along with other abducted and replaced heroes. During the company-wide story arc &quot;Dark Reign&quot;, Echo and Iron Fist left the team and the Avengers gained Ms. Marvel, Bucky Barnes as a fill-in Captain America, and Mockingbird.

Iron Man, in the series &quot;The Mighty Avengers&quot;, formed a team under the aegis of the government&#x27;s program, and took up residency in New York City, joined by Ares, Black Widow, Sentry, Wasp, Wonder Man, and leader Carol Danvers as Ms. Marvel. After the events of the Secret Invasion story arc, Norman Osborn assumed control of the formerly S.H.I.E.L.D.-sponsored Avengers, now under the auspices of his own agency, H.A.M.M.E.R. All but Ares and the Sentry left this team — the Wasp appeared to have died — and the team migrated to the series &quot;Dark Avengers&quot;. Osborn recruited Marvel Boy to pose as Captain Marvel and Daken to pose as his father, Wolverine, bringing Moonstone, Bullseye, and Venom from his previous Thunderbolts team to impersonate Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye, and Spider-Man respectively.

In &quot;The Mighty Avengers&quot;, Pym, assumed the Wasp identity in tribute to his fallen ex-wife, led a new team of Avengers, and claimed the name for his team as he was the only founding Avenger on any of the three active Avengers rosters (Wasp and Cap were dead, Thor was acting solo, and Iron Man was on the run from Osborn). His team operated under a multinational umbrella group, the Global Reaction Agency for Mysterious Paranormal Activity (GRAMPA). This team featured the roster of Hercules, Amadeus Cho, Stature, the Vision, Jocasta, U.S. Agent, Quicksilver, Magneto, and Pym. Loki in disguise as the Scarlet Witch was a recurring character. Iron Man and the Hulk were briefly with them.

=== 2010s ===
After Osborn&#x27;s Dark Avengers are exposed as criminals and their attack on Asgard was thwarted, the next iteration of the Avengers roster consists of Thor, Hawkeye, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America, Spider-Woman, Iron Man, and team leader Maria Hill. Steve Rogers, briefly eschewing his Captain America persona, responds to Luke Cage&#x27;s concerns about the team reverting to old methods by granting Cage&#x27;s &quot;New Avengers&quot; recognition as an official team independent of Stark&#x27;s more traditional Avengers. Bucky Barnes as Captain America joined the main Avengers, while Iron Fist, Power Woman, and the Thing joined Cage&#x27;s team, Spider-Man and Wolverine maintaining dual membership in both teams. Rogers was an occasional presence and Victoria Hand was added as a government liaison for the New Avengers with Rogers&#x27;s backing.

A second series, titled &quot;Secret Avengers&quot;, was released in May 2010, written by Ed Brubaker with Mike Deodato as the regular artist. The second volume of the &quot;New Avengers&quot; series was launched in June 2010, written by Bendis and drawn by Stuart Immonen. A fourth title, &quot;Avengers Academy&quot;, was launched in June 2010, replacing &quot;Avengers: The Initiative&quot;. Christos Gage served as writer, with Mike McKone as artist.

Following a meeting between Rogers and MI-13, Captain Britain accepts a position with the Avengers. Noh-Varr later does as well. Bruce Banner made arrangements with Rogers for the Red Hulk to join.

The &quot;Shattered Heroes&quot; storyline leads to several changes in the main Avengers lineup, with Quake and Storm being recruited, and the Vision rejoining the team. Wolverine and Spider-Man leave the main team and become more involved with the New Avengers. During the events of the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, Storm quits to side with her fellow mutants as a member of the X-Men. The Avengers dismiss Noh-Varr after he attempted to betray the team, though ultimately he did not. The conflict ends with both teams united but defeated by an unrepentant Cyclops. A new series, &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot;, debuted in the flagship title of the Marvel NOW! initiative. The title is written by Rick Remender with art by John Cassaday, and the team contains members of both the Avengers and the X-Men. As well, a biweekly &quot;Avengers&quot; title was launched, written by Jonathan Hickman and drawn by different artists for each story arc. Hickman also began writing &quot;New Avengers&quot;.
During the 2014 &quot;AXIS&quot; storyline, when a now-evil Scarlet Witch invades Latveria, Doctor Doom forms his own team of Avengers consisting of 3D Man, Elsa Bloodstone, Stingray, Valkyrie, and U.S. Agent. After various heroes and villains experience a moral inversion in the battle against the Red Skull empowered with Professor Charles Xavier&#x27;s abilities, Rogers later assembles Magneto, Doctor Doom, the Absorbing Man, Carnage, Deadpool, the Enchantress, the Hobgoblin, the fifth Jack O&#x27;Lantern, Loki, Mystique, and Sabretooth, all temporarily &#x27;inverted&#x27; to act as heroes, to assist he and Spider-Man in defeating the inverted Avengers and X-Men until the original spell can be undone. During the &quot;Time Runs Out&quot; storyline, Sunspot created a team of the Avengers, consisting of himself, Black Widow, Cannonball, Manifold, Pod, Shang-Chi, Smasher, Spider-Woman, Validator, and the Children of the Sun. The &quot;Multiversal Avengers&quot; division of this team consists of Abyss, the Ex Nihili (including Ex Nihilo), Hyperion, Nightmask, Odinson, and Star Brand.

Following the destruction and reconstruction of reality in the 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, a new team is created known as Avengers Idea Mechanics, set to tackle Avengers-level threats beyond simply fighting villains, while the Avengers Unity Squad continues to operate to support mutant relations. Iron Man forms a new team of Avengers in the &quot;All-New All-Different Avengers&quot; series consisting of himself, the Vision, Nova, Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan), Spider-Man (Miles Morales), Captain America (Sam Wilson), and Thor (Jane Foster). Following the &quot;Civil War II&quot;, storyline, the title was canceled and replaced with a new volume of the regular &quot;Avengers&quot; title. The roster was also changed, where following Iron Man being placed in a coma, and Spider-Man, Nova, and Ms. Marvel&#x27;s resignation from the team (who instead teamed up with other heroes their own age to form their own group the Champions), the remaining three members are joined by Spider-Man (Peter Parker), Hercules and Wasp (Nadia Pym) to form a new team.

During the 2017 &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, when Captain America was &#x27;reprogrammed&#x27; to believe that he had been a Hydra sleeper agent since childhood, the Hydra regime formed their own Avengers. This team consisted of Odinson (Thor currently doubting his worth and believing that Rogers must be &#x27;right&#x27; as he could wield Mjolnir when Thor couldn&#x27;t, unaware that Hydra had used the cosmic cube to change the nature of the enchantment), Deadpool, a Chthon-possessed Scarlet Witch, Vision (who was suffering from an A.I. Virus created by Arnim Zola), Taskmaster, Eric O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Life Model Decoy counterpart Black Ant, and Doctor Octopus&#x27; Superior Octopus appearance. However, in the final stand, Odinson rejects Rogers&#x27; authority and sides with his old allies, while the Vision&#x27;s daughter purges him of the virus and Brother Voodoo exorcises Chthon from the Witch. Taskmaster and Black Ant free the imprisoned Champions in exchange for leniency, and the true version of Steve Rogers was restored, using Mjolnir against his counterpart.

In May 2018, another volume for the series was launched as part of Marvel&#x27;s Fresh Start initiative, written by Jason Aaron and drawn by Ed McGuinness. This new volume also saw the return of the main three core members, as Steve Rogers and Thor met up with Tony Stark to convince him to reassemble the group with themselves at its core. The reunion was consolidated by the machinations of Loki, who facilitated the arrival of the world-threatening Dark Celestials as a ploy to get the Avengers back in action, resulting in the participation of Black Panther, Captain Marvel, She-Hulk, Ghost Rider and Blade, with the Black Panther being elected chairperson. After the Dark Celestials were defeated, the Celestials set upright the corpse of the long-time dead Progenitor in the North Pole. The Avengers refurbished the Progenitor&#x27;s corpse, transforming it into their base of operations, the Avengers Mountain.

=== 2020s ===
== Team roster ==

The Avengers team lineup is known for being perpetually fluid and changing, with many members coming and going, often more than once. The founding members of the team were Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Ant-Man and the Wasp. Hulk left after a single issue, which would become a running gag among splinter team members (for example, Spider-Man leaving the second incarnation of the Avengers Unity Division), and his founder status was retroactively filled in by Captain America. Later additions and frequent members include Hawkeye, Wonder Man, Falcon, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, and Vision, among others.

There are also numerous splinter teams that have formed, starting with the West Coast Avengers in 1984. Each of these splinter teams tends to specialize in a way the main team does not. Members of these teams can be on other splinter teams or on the main team. These teams are, in alphabetical order:
* A-Force: An all-female team formed after the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event.
* Avengers A.I.: A team consisting of people with various artificial intelligence-related abilities.
* Avengers Academy: A school for teenage superheroes who served as Avengers members and received training from full-time Avengers members. The school was shut down shortly after the events of &quot;Avengers Arena&quot;.
* Avengers Unity Division: A team meant to bridge the gap between humans, mutates, and mutants following &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; by including members of all groups. Their mission statement was later expanded to include Inhumans.
* Avengers World: A team that specializes in international protection following the disbandment of the U.S.Avengers; not to be confused with the comic book of the same name.
* Great Lakes Avengers: A farcical team consisting of low-level heroes living in Wisconsin.
* Mighty Avengers:
** A team formed by Iron Man as part of the Fifty-States Initiative, which was broken apart after the events of &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;.
** A team formed by Hank Pym after the previous Mighty Avengers collapsed.
** A team formed by Luke Cage to deal with more street-level threats in response to the latest invasion by Thanos. It was shut down by Iron Man during the &quot;AXIS&quot; event.
* New Avengers:
** A team created after the disbandment of the main team to replace them. This team was known for including more prestigious Marvel superheroes, such as Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Daredevil, and disbanded after the retirement of its leader, Luke Cage.
** A team formed by Sunspot after he purchased and reformed Advanced Idea Mechanics.
** A similar team to Sunspot&#x27;s, going by the name &quot;Avengers Idea Mechanics&quot;.
* Savage Avengers: A team consisting of supernatural and/or antiheroic members.
* Secret Avengers:
** A black operation team formed by Steve Rogers.
** Another undercover team formed by S.H.I.E.L.D.
* U.S.Avengers: A patriotic-themed team.
* War Avengers: A temporary team formed during The War of the Realms event.
* West Coast Avengers: A team formed by Vision to expand the Avengers&#x27; reach.
* Young Avengers: A team consisting of teenage and young adult heroes.

Of these teams, only the main team, Avengers World, the Great Lakes Avengers, the Savage Avengers, and the Young Avengers are currently active. Additionally, all members of the Fantastic Four, as well as various members of the X-Men, Heroes for Hire, and other prominent Marvel teams have served as members of the Avengers.

== Enemies ==

The Avengers have a long list of villains they frequently face.

Some of the most recurring include Ultron, Kang the Conqueror, Loki and Thanos.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==

=== Critical response ===
Abraham Josephine Riesman of &quot;Vulture&quot; included the Avengers team in their &quot;12 Teams That Defined Superhero Storytelling&quot; list. Michael Doran of &quot;Newsarama&quot; ranked the Avengers team 1st in their &quot;Best Superhero Teams of All Time&quot; list. &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; asserted, &quot;The Avengers are known as Earth&#x27;s mightiest heroes, and that appellation is self-explanatory. The team combines Marvel&#x27;s greatest heroes into one powerful unit, an assemblage of heroes that faces down the deadliest threats the Marvel Universe can throw at them. The team has proven to be one of the most potent groups in all of comics, boasting legendary heroes and battling in titanic wars for the fate of all reality,&quot; and ranked the Avengers team 1st in their &quot;10 Most Important Marvel Hero Teams&quot; list, 1st in their &quot;Every Marvel Superhero Team&quot; list, 1st in their &quot;Marvel: The 10 Strongest Superhero Teams&quot; list, and 2nd in their &quot;Marvel: 10 Most Powerful Teams&quot; list.

Poushali Guharauth of &quot;Sportskeeda&quot; ranked the Avengers 1st in their &quot;10 Best Superhero Teams of All Time&quot; list. Jason Serafino of &quot;Complex&quot; ranked the Avengers 2nd in their &quot;10 Best Superhero Teams In Comics&quot; list. Chris Isaac of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; the Avengers team 2nd in their &quot;15 Best Superhero Teams Of All Time&quot; list. Geoff Boucher of &quot;Deadline&quot; ranked the Avengers team 3rd in their &quot;Stan Lee&#x27;s Legacy: Ranking The Hollywood Heroes Co-Created By The Marvel Comics Icon&quot; list.

=== Impact ===
Most of the characters that appear in Marvel Comics&#x27; books are set in the same fictional universe, known as the Marvel Universe. They occasionally make guest appearances in each other&#x27;s books, and more regularly in team books, such as &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Such crossovers encouraged readers to buy other books in the Marvel Comics catalogue, and readers became engrossed not just in the individual characters but in their web of relationships across the broader setting. DC Comics pioneered this idea with the Justice Society of America and the Justice League, likewise promoting and developing the DC Universe. Many readers devoted themselves to just one of these two comic book universes. After all, they were both quite large and didn&#x27;t overlap. Thus, the superhero fan community developed sub-communities of DC devotees and Marvel devotees.

==== Marvel Cinematic Universe ====
Marvel Studios repeated this business strategy when it produced the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), culminating with the release of &quot;The Avengers&quot; in 2012. Before the MCU, superhero movies were usually isolated productions mostly because of licensing issues, but the shared universe model has led to its continued growing success. In response, Warner Brothers (which owns DC Comics) began to produce its own series of interconnected superhero movies known as the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), culminating with &quot;Justice League&quot; in 2017. Movies tend to have bigger audiences than comic books, so, the general public are more aware that the likes of Wonder Woman and Captain America existed in separate universes owned by different companies. The movies raised brand awareness of DC Comics and Marvel Comics.

As of June 2022, the MCU is the highest-grossing film franchise in history, having collectively grossed over $26 billion in box-office revenue, more than twice that by the second largest franchise, &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

== Theme park attractions ==
===Avengers Campus===

After the acquisition by Disney in 2009, Marvel films began to be marketed at the Innoventions attraction in Tomorrowland at Disneyland. For &quot;Iron Man 3&quot;, the exhibit, entitled &quot;Iron Man Tech Presented by Stark Industries&quot;, featured the same armor display that was shown at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, with the Marks I-VII and the new Mark XLII. In addition, there was a simulator game, titled &quot;Become Iron Man&quot;, that used Kinect-like technology to allow the viewer to be encased in an animated Mark XLII armor and take part in a series of &quot;tests,&quot; in which you fire repulsor rays and fly through Tony Stark&#x27;s workshop. The game was guided by J.A.R.V.I.S., who is voiced again by Paul Bettany. The exhibit also had smaller displays that included helmets and chest pieces from the earlier films and the gauntlet and boot from an action sequence in &quot;Iron Man 3&quot;. The exhibit for &quot;Thor: The Dark World&quot; was called &quot;Thor: Treasures of Asgard&quot;, and featured displays of Asgardian relics and transports guests to Odin&#x27;s throne room, where they were greeted by Thor. &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot;″s exhibit, &quot;Captain America: The Living Legend and Symbol of Courage&quot;, featured a meet and greet experience.

From May to September 2017, Disneyland Resort featured the &quot;Summer of Heroes&quot;, which sees members of the Guardians and Avengers making appearances throughout the Disneyland Resort. Additionally, the Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Dance Off event was featured, which involved Peter Quill / Star-Lord blasting music from his boombox, along with the Avengers Training Initiative, a limited experience where Black Widow and Hawkeye &quot;assemble a group of young recruits to see if they have what it takes to be an Avenger.&quot; Marvel-related food and merchandise was also available throughout Hollywood Land at Disney California Adventure during the &quot;Summer of Heroes&quot;.

 As was established with Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout!, Avengers Campus exists in its own theme park universe that is inspired by the MCU. 

====Walt Disney Studios Park====
In March 2018, the Walt Disney Company announced a new Marvel-themed area inspired by the MCU to Disneyland Paris&#x27; Walt Disney Studios Park. The area includes a reimagined attraction where riders team up with Iron Man and other Avengers on a &quot;hyper-kinetic adventure&quot; on July 20, 2022. The park also hosted the &quot;Summer of Super Heroes&quot; live-action stage show from June–September 2018.

=== &quot;Avengers: Quantum Encounter&quot; ===

In July 2021, the immersive family dining experience &quot;Avengers: Quantum Encounter&quot; at the Worlds of Marvel restaurant on the &quot;Disney Wish&quot; cruise line was announced, which debuted when the cruise began voyages on July 14, 2022. The experience takes place during dinner with interactive elements and a full CGI recreation of the &quot;Wish&quot;″s upper decks. Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, Brie Larson, Kerry Condon, and Iman Vellani reprised their MCU roles, while Ross Marquand voiced Ultron after previously doing so in &quot;What If...?&quot;, in which he replaced James Spader. Chris Waitt directed Rudd and Lilly&#x27;s content, which was written by Steven Spiegel and featured visual effects by Framestore.

In May 2014, the &quot;Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N.&quot; (Scientific Training and Tactical Intelligence Operative Network) exhibit opened at the Discovery Times Square center. The exhibit features replica set pieces, as well as actual props from the films, mixed with interactive technology and information, crafted through a partnership with NASA and other scientists. Titus Welliver also provides a &quot;debrief&quot; to visitors, reprising his role as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Felix Blake. Created by Victory Hill Exhibits, &quot;Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N.&quot; cost $7.5 million to create, and ran through early September 2015.

The exhibit also opened in South Korea at the War Memorial of Korea in April 2015, in Paris, France, at Esplanade de La Défense a year later, and in Las Vegas at the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino in June 2016. The Las Vegas version of the exhibit featured updated character details and corresponding science to incorporate the Marvel films that have released since the original exhibit in New York. Additionally, the Las Vegas version features Cobie Smulders reprising her role as Maria Hill to &quot;debrief&quot; visitors, replacing Welliver.

=== &quot;Avengers: Damage Control&quot; ===
In October 2019, Marvel Studios and ILMxLAB announced the virtual reality experience &quot;Avengers: Damage Control&quot;. The experience would be available for a limited time starting in mid-October 2019 at select Void VR locations. &quot;Avengers: Damage Control&quot; sees players taking control of one of Shuri&#x27;s Emergency Response Suits–which combine Wakandan and Stark Industries technologies–to defeat a threat alongside Doctor Strange, Ant-Man, and the Wasp. Letitia Wright, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Rudd, and Evangeline Lilly all reprise their MCU roles, while Ross Marquand voices Ultron, replacing James Spader. The experience was extended to the end of 2019.

== Other versions ==
=== 1950s Avengers ===
A short-lived team of superheroes in the 1950s called themselves the &quot;Avengers&quot;. It consisted of Marvel Boy, Venus, the 3-D Man, Gorilla-Man, M-11, Jimmy Woo, Namora, and Jann of the Jungle, and existed in an alternate timeline that was erased by the time-manipulating Immortus. Agents of Atlas, a version of the group without 3-D Man and Jann, existed in mainstream continuity and eventually reformed in the present day.

=== Age of Apocalypse ===
A humanized version of the Avengers banded together during the Age of Apocalypse and were known as the Human High Council.

=== Avengers 1959 ===
The &quot;New Avengers&quot; vol. 2, #10 revealed another 1950s Avengers team, formed by Nick Fury to hunt the last remnants of Nazi Germany and consisted of Fury himself, Dominic Fortune, Dum Dum Dugan, Namora, Silver Sable, Sabretooth, Kraven the Hunter, and Ulysses Bloodstone. A follow-up miniseries penned by Howard Chaykin showed this group assisted by Blonde Phantom, Eric Koenig and a brand new character British wizard and spy, Powell McTeague. That time they fought against a cult based on the Nazi party which employed several agents, including Baron Blood and Brain Drain.

=== Avengers (1,000,000 B.C. version) ===
In the one-shot issue that ties in with &quot;Marvel Legacy&quot;, there was a version of the Avengers that existed back circa 1,000,000 B.C. The line-up consists of Agamotto, Odin, Lady Phoenix and Stone Age versions of Black Panther, Ghost Rider, Iron Fist, and Star Brand. This group first came together to defeat an out-of-control Celestial called the Fallen where they defeated it and sealed it underground somewhere in South Africa.

=== Avengers (1000 A.D. version) ===
During the 11th century, it is revealed that Thor had formed that time period&#x27;s version of the Avengers with Boldof the Black, the Black Panther Nehanda, Chief Hellhawk, the Atlantean Gale who wielded the Iron Fist, and a Sasquatch Sorcerer Supreme named Murkfoot.

=== Avengers Forever ===
One of the timelines seen in &quot;Avengers Forever&quot; is an alternate future where Martians have ravaged Earth and killed most of its heroes. An older version of Black Panther leads a team of Avengers consisting of Killraven, Living Lightning, Jocasta, a new Crimson Dynamo, and Thundra.

=== Avengers Next ===
In the alternate future timeline known as MC2, the Avengers disbanded, and Avengers Mansion was a museum. An emergency forced Edwin Jarvis to sound an alert, and a new generation of heroes formed a new team of Avengers. Most of the new Avengers were children of established Marvel superheroes.

=== House of M: Avengers ===
In an alternate reality which was created by the Scarlet Witch, the Avengers were a street gang of superpowered humans formed by Luke Cage in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, a human ghetto in the mutant-ruled reality. Although they were initially criminals, the disenfranchised human residents came to view the Avengers as their protectors and would often go to Cage when the mutant authorities refused to help them.

=== Marvel 2099 ===
In Marvel 2099, the Avengers were mentioned in this timeline where it was mentioned that Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, and Hulk were known members.

On the unified reality of Earth-2099, there was a group of Avengers that consisted of Black Widow, Black Widow 2098, Cable, Captain America, Daredevil (Samuel Fisk), Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster, a 2099 version of Grey Hulk, Iron Man, Moon Knight, Phastos, Relur, Roman the Sub-Mariner, Strange, and Thor. When Doom 2099 brought an end of the Heroic Age, it had affected the Avengers in different ways. Black Widow 2098, Daredevil, Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster, Grey Hulk, Phastos, Relur, Roman the Sub-Mariner, and Strange were killed by the 2099 version of Masters of Evil. Cable and Moon Knight survived with the latter forming the 2099 version of the New Avengers who successfully avenged the fallen Avengers by defeating the Masters of Evil and having them remanded to a prison on the planet Wakanda.

=== Marvel Zombies ===
The Avengers existed as a team prior to a zombie contagion&#x27;s arrival in the original Marvel Zombies universe and resembled their pre-disassembled roster. When several of their members were infected, they set about eating humanity and sent out a bogus &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot; call to draw super-humans to the Avengers Mansion, infected more heroes and thus spread the virus. The team fell apart and many of its members were killed as time passed.

The second team of zombie Avengers appeared in &quot;Marvel Zombies Return&quot;, set in another timeline where the original zombies had been sent after the final battle. That team was brought together to find food and kill any resistance (zombie or uninfected) and was led by Sentry. Also on the team were the zombies Moon Knight, Namor, Quasar, Quicksilver, Thundra, and Super-Skrull. They were joined by zombie Giant-Man of the original Zombiverse, who was trying to power a dimensional teleporter, but were all killed by Spider-Man&#x27;s New Avengers. The team was composed of himself with Iron Man (James Rhodes, who had escaped infection by the zombie virus by amputating his bitten limbs and replacing them with cybernetic implants), Sandman, and the zombie Hulk and Wolverine.

=== Secret Wars ===
During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, the different domains of Battleworld have different versions of the Avengers:
* In the Battleworld domain of Spider-Island, the Avengers were taken over by the same spider-virus turning them into Man-Spiders that obeyed the Spider-Queen&#x27;s every command. It took a combination of Man-Wolf&#x27;s gemstone, Morbius the Living Vampire&#x27;s serum, the Lizard serum, and the Goblin formula to free some of the Avengers. After the Spider-Queen was defeated, Spider-Island is now a domain filled with Man-Spiders, Dinosaur People, Lizard People, Bird People, Vampires, and Werewolves.
* In the Battleworld domain of the Regency, Hawkeye has kept the Avengers alive in S.H.I.E.L.D. after most of its members and other known superheroes were defeated by Regent.
* In the Battleworld domain of Marville, the Avengers are children and consist of Captain America, Black Widow, Captain marvel, Falcon, Hawkeye, Hulk, Iron Man, Nick Fury, Scarlet Witch, She-Hulk, Spider-Man, Thor, Vision, and War Machine.
* In the Battleworld domain of the Kingdom of Manhattan, elements of Earth-616 and Earth-1610 helped to make this domain which caused a new reality that is a fusion of both with characters from both realities co-existing. The Avengers consisted of Captain America (Sam Wilson), Captain America (Steve Rogers), Black Widow, Hawkeye, Hulk&#x27;s Doc Green form, Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man, Thor, War Machine, Wasp, Wonder Man, and the Unity Division (Rogue, Quicksilver, Sabretooth, Scarlet Witch, and Vision) while the Ultimates consisted of Ben Grimm, Captain America, Hawkeye, Human Torch, Invisible Woman, Iron Man, and Thor.
* In the Battleworld domain of the City, the Holy Wood section of it has its version of the Avengers led by Baron Simon Williams and consists of Black Panther, Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Hercules, Jocasta, Moondragon, Vision, and Yellowjacket.
* In the Battleworld domain of 2099, the Avengers are a team of corporate superheroes sponsored by Alchemax. The group consists of Captain America (a Latina woman named Roberta Mendez), Black Widow (an African-American woman named Tania), Iron Man (a dwarf named Sonny Frisco), Hawkeye (a human/hawk hybrid named Max), and Hercules.
* In the Battleworld domain of the Walled City of New York, the Avengers are allied with S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s part of the domain and consist of Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Rage, Scarlet Witch, She-Hulk, Spider-Man, and Thor.

=== Ultimate Marvel ===

In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, the Avengers are named the Ultimates, and were formed by General Nicholas Fury to protect America against superhuman threats. They first appeared in &quot;The Ultimates&quot; by Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch. After the events of &quot;The Ultimates 2&quot;, the team left S.H.I.E.L.D. employment to become independent and financed by Tony Stark.

A Black Ops team called the &quot;Avengers&quot; debuted sometime after the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; storyline. This version was a project headed up by Nick Fury and Tony Stark&#x27;s brother Gregory Stark to bring Captain America back. Its known members consisted of War Machine, Hawkeye, Black Widow II, Spider (an Asian in an orange and purple Spider-Man outfit who once claimed to be a spliced clone of Spider-Man and Professor X from the future), Tyrone Cash (who was the original Hulk before Bruce Banner), Red Wasp (a former Liberators member), and Nerd Hulk (an intelligent clone of Hulk who lacks Hulk&#x27;s rage). Additional members included Punisher (who joined the Avengers against a Ghost Rider manhunt) and the half vampire Blade (who joined the group to help against a vampire invasion).

==In other media==
===Television===
Three animated series have been based on the team.
* &quot;The Avengers: United They Stand&quot; was mainly based on the Roy Thomas era of the group, and ran from 1999 to 2000.
* &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot; was based on the early adventures of the team, but also used many elements from other runs. The TV show ran for two seasons, from 2010 to 2012, and started presenting the original Avengers line-up founded by Iron Man, Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk, who leaves the group after battling Amora the Enchantress and Skurge. Captain America later joins the team, replacing him.
* &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot; is mainly based on the MCU iteration of the group and premiered on May 26, 2013. The show also changed its title to &quot;Avengers: Ultron Revolution&quot; (2016), &quot;Avengers: Secret Wars&quot; (2017) and &quot;Avengers: Black Panther&#x27;s Quest&quot; (2018).
* The Avengers appear in the Disney Junior series &quot;Spidey and His Amazing Friends&quot;.

===Film===
Marvel Animation has made three Avengers films, &quot;Ultimate Avengers&quot;, &quot;Ultimate Avengers 2&quot;, and &quot;Next Avengers&quot;.

<text>METRORail is the light rail system in Houston, Texas (United States). In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of . METRORail ranks as the second most-traveled light rail system in the Southern United States and the 10th most-traveled light rail system in the United States, and has the highest ridership per mile for light rail systems in the Southern US. METRORail is operated by the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County (METRO).

== History ==
=== Predecessors ===

The first streetcar service was a mule-drawn railcar operated by the Houston City Railroad Company along McKinney Street in 1868. Because the company chose a bad street alignment, the nascent line foundered after just weeks in service. It was succeeded by the Houston City Street Railway (HCSR), which was founded in 1870 and began revenue operation in 1874 with routes following busy merchant districts along Congress Avenue and Main Street, the latter of which ran to one of the first sites of the Texas State Fair; the area was subsequently developed and is now Midtown, Houston. A competing service, the Bayou City Street Railway, was started in 1883 with a single route along Texas Avenue, but it was purchased and folded into HCSR later that year. A new competitor, also named Bayou City Street Railway, was founded in 1889; the new Bayou City was purchased and consolidated into HCSR in 1890 by Oscar Carter, who also announced plans to electrify the system.

By 1892, electrification of the existing streetcar lines was complete and extensions began past the immediate downtown/central Houston area (within a radius of the Harris County Courthouse), including the Houston Heights suburb, which was developed by Carter and required streetcar service due to its distance from central Houston. HCSR was acquired by the Houston Electric Company in 1901, which was managed by Stone &amp; Webster and continued to expand the service, including the start of interurban service to Galveston provided by the affiliated Galveston–Houston Electric Railway in 1911. However, the popularity of privately-owned automobiles began to displace demand for streetcar service and the system stopped expanding after 1927. Several streetcar lines were converted to conventional bus lines in 1936, and the right-of-way for the Interurban was sold in 1940, later being reused for the Gulf Freeway. The last streetcar completed its run early in the morning of June 9, 1940, and the rails were later removed and scrapped during World War II.

A &#x27;sample&#x27; monorail line was built in Houston in 1955; the Trailblazer operated over a line at Arrowhead Park with a peak speed of , starting on February 18, 1956. The monorail ceased operation in September of that year and subsequently was moved to Fair Park in Dallas for the Texas State Fair, where it continued to run until 1964.

=== False starts ===
Rapid Transit Lines, the successor to HCSR and Houston Electric, proposed a rapid transit system as a long-range project under the 1971 &quot;Transit Action Program&quot; (TAP), developed by Alan M. Voorhees and Associates, largely laid out along the radial spokes centered in the Inner Loop, tracing the city&#x27;s major freeways. TAP would be implemented in two stages. In Stage 1, of rapid transit routes would be built, including fixed rail lines serving the southwest, west, and northeast parts of Houston (with a downtown subway), and three bus-exclusive lanes along the North, Gulf, and South freeways. Stage 1 was planned to complete in the 1970s at an estimated cost of $800 million. Under Stage 2, scheduled for completion before 1990, the Stage 1 rail lines would be extended and two more would be added, bringing the total system to . TAP would have been the technical basis for the proposed Houston Area Rapid Transit Authority (HARTA), but a referendum to form HARTA was &quot;soundly defeated&quot; in 1973. The city of Houston purchased Rapid Transit Lines in April 1974 for $5.3 million and renamed it the Houston Transit System (&quot;HouTran&quot;).
Houston formed the Office of Public Transportation in January 1975 to plan the region&#x27;s public transportation system, and began working on an update of TAP. After METRO was formed in 1978/79, an initial Phase I alternatives analysis identified multiple potential transit corridors, and under Phase II, proposed in 1980, the &quot;Southwest/Westpark&quot; corridor (along what is now the Westpark Tollway) was prioritized for further study. The proposed Southwest/Westpark corridor would have run , generally parallel to the Southwest Freeway, with equal lengths west and east of the West Inner Loop. The planned route would run from downtown Houston along Main Street to approximately Elgin, and west from Elgin to West Belt along existing public and rail rights-of-way.&lt;ref name=&quot;S/WC-80&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Service options that could be operated along the corridor included a dedicated busway on an elevated structure (carrying 203,500 daily riders at an estimated capital construction cost of $878 million), an elevated light rail system (213,400 daily passengers; $1.297 billion), a light rail subway (226,800 daily; $1.572 billion), or a grade-separated heavy rail system with subway through the central business district (223,700 daily, $1.366 billion). At the time, it was estimated that 9.5 million person-trips were made per day in Harris County; of those, 98.7% were taken using private vehicles.

METRO updated its 1980 Southwest/Westpark corridor proposal and extended the eastern terminus north by , combining it with the proposed North corridor as the &quot;Houston Rail Rapid Transit Project&quot;; the extended line now ran north past I-10 and the North Inner Loop to Crosstimbers. The design called for of elevated tracks, of subway, and at-grade. The system would have 17 passenger stations (eight aerial, six at-grade, and three subway), and included a new railyard/maintenance facility at Cavalcade. The 1983 proposal was rejected by Houston voters via referendum. Light voter turnout was blamed for the defeat of the $2.35 billion proposal, which included the purchase of approximately 400 new buses and construction of a heavy rail system. The capital cost of the rail system alone was estimated at $1.436 billion, including 130 new rail vehicles.

In the wake of the 1983 defeat, METRO began work on a regional transit plan, integrating inputs from city, county, and state governments and developing three options for implementation: A (bus routes only), B (light rail loop and radial bus routes), or C (light rail with supplemental bus routes); after approximately 250 meetings were held in 1984 and 1985, citizens overwhelmingly supported Option C, with planned light rail service to operate along Main Street within the inner loop (I-610). Longtime Houston Mayor Kathryn Whitmire appointed Bob Lanier to chair METRO in 1988; Lanier shepherded a voter referendum that year which passed, approving the Phase 2 Regional Mobility Plan which included of fixed guideway transit. Under the 1988 referendum, METRO would devote of its sales tax revenue on roads, on improving bus service, and the remaining on developing the fixed guideway plans, but Lanier showed reluctance to follow through on developing plans for a fixed guideway, questioning the projected ridership numbers, and Whitmire fired him in late December 1989. Incensed, Lanier released a memorandum attacking the mayor&#x27;s rail transit plans, and Whitmire responded by holding a press conference on Lanier&#x27;s front lawn during his annual Christmas party.

Houston was the largest city in the United States without a rail system after the 1990 opening of the now A Line in Los Angeles. After issuing an RFP in July 1990, METRO received five proposals for the design and development of the fixed guideway system. In March 1991, METRO approved a plan to develop a monorail system similar to the one operating at Walt Disney World in Orlando at an estimated cost of $1.27 billion, operating along the extended Southwest/Westpark corridor between the Houston Galleria and downtown Houston. The proposed monorail system would operate with an initial segment servicing western residential regions west of downtown to Beltway 8 (Sam Houston Tollway), with construction planned to start in 1993 and revenue service to begin by 1998. Future planned expansions included one leg that would connect downtown with the Texas Medical Center and Astrodome to the south, and another leg connecting downtown to Texas Southern University and the University of Houston. In 1991, U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay removed $65 million in federal funding for the rail line and after Lanier was elected mayor of Houston in 1992, defeating Whitmire, the plan was stopped. Lanier&#x27;s election was seen as a second referendum on the monorail plan; the funding was diverted to road projects and police patrols instead.

=== Main Street Line ===
After these setbacks, Houston drew up a rail plan without federal subsidies and published it in 1997 as the Houston METRO 2020 Regional Transit Plan. The Houston city council approved the light rail project in November 2000 and set a January 25, 2001 date for a groundbreaking ceremony, but councilmember Rob Todd filed a lawsuit opposing construction, claiming the METRO organization was a &quot;private business&quot; and subject to Houston City Charter provisions requiring a public vote on business use of its streets; the ceremony was cancelled following a temporary restraining order, issued by Judge Tony Lindsay on January 18. Todd was joined as co-plaintiff by Allan Vogel, one of 1,100 residents who signed a petition seeking a public vote on the light rail plan. Judge Lindsay later recused herself from the case due to her personal ties to Todd and her husband&#x27;s public opposition to METRO. She was succeeded by District Judge John P. Devine, who issued an injunction on February 2, halting work on the light rail project and holding up contract awards. A second lawsuit was filed by four property owners.

The injunction issued by Judge Devine in Todd&#x27;s lawsuit was reversed on appeal on March 9, 2001. Ground was broken on the original , 16-station portion of the Main Street (now Red) Line on March 13, 2001. The Texas Supreme Court upheld the appellate court ruling on June 28. That November, voters approved Proposition 1, which allowed the light rail project to continue, but required public referendums for future extensions, and rejected Proposition 3, which would have initiated a public referendum on continuing the initial project.
The initial segment runs between UH–Downtown (northern terminus) and Fannin South (southern terminus). The opening of METRORail, which took place on January 1, 2004, came 64 years after the previous streetcar system had been shut down. At the time, two extensions to the north and east were already in planning, and a concept was advanced for a third extension west.

The cost of the initial segment was $324 million. Tom DeLay strongly opposed construction of the METRORail line and twice blocked federal funding for the system in the United States House of Representatives. Thus the Metrorail was built without any federal funding until November 2011 when a $900 million grant was approved for expansions, under an executive order issued by President Barack Obama.

In spite of the opposition of some groups to the Metrorail, surveys conducted by Stephen Klineberg and Rice University have shown consistent increases in support of rail transport and decreases in support for bigger and better roads/highways in the Houston metropolitan area in recent years. Klineberg considers these changes a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; or &quot;sea change&quot; on attitudes towards mass transit.

=== Phase II ===
METRORail Phase II was included as part of the METRO Solutions Transit System Plan (aka Metro Solutions Plan or 2025 Regional Transit Plan) that was placed before voters on the November 4, 2003 ballot. Phase II included six proposed light rail segments to complement and extend the Main Street line, then under construction.

Voters approved the $1.23 billion Phase II expansion of the as-yet unopened system, including four new lines. Critics of the system opposed METRO for spending public funds for &quot;educational advertisements&quot; about the proposed system, which critics claimed promote the referendum. Critics further claimed that the main political action committee (PAC) supporting the bond had a conflict of interest because it received over US$100,000 in contributions from contractors and equipment suppliers for METRORail who stood to gain financially from its expansion. By 2004, Rep. DeLay was hailing the leadership team at METRO for both its &quot;vision for a mobile Houston region, and the kind of open minds and flexible management style it will take to realize that vision&quot;, adding that &quot;[METRO] are holding a forum to look at all forms of technology and how those technologies fit into the mobility in Houston&quot;; at least one observer noted that DeLay was advocating for &quot;innovative rail solutions&quot;, not light rail.

In 2004, an alternatives analysis selected a shorter route for the Southeast Corridor.

The North and Southeast corridors received their records of decision from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in July 2008. Construction began in July 2009 on the North/Red Line Extension (North Corridor), including nine stations from UH–Downtown to the Northline Transit Center Station. The Purple Line (Southeast Corridor), with ten stations, and the Green Line, with nine stations, also began construction in July 2009. According to the project schedules, the Red Line Extension would enter revenue service by 2013 and the Green Line by 2014. However, METRO announced on September 9, 2010 that the opening dates for the Red Line Extension, Purple and Green lines had been pushed back to 2014 and by September 2014, the start date had slipped back to April 4, 2015.

In November 2009, METRO applied for a $900 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration to fund future construction. Allegations were made that METRO lied about the income from their sales tax revenue to allow them to gain $900 million in federal funds for all five planned rail expansions. However, city officials found no such attempt by METRO to mislead them, but the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) continued to withhold its approval for the money until further figures can be examined. On December 8, 2011, the FTA finally announced the award. The award of $900 million was broken into two $450 million grants from the New Starts transit program, to fund construction of the Red Line Extension and Purple lines. METRO offered the public a chance to name stations on its expansion lines.

Part of the funding allocated by the FTA under its New Starts program for the North, Southeast, and University Corridor projects included up to  million to expand the LRV fleet to 104 vehicles and replace the existing 19 LRVs on the Red Line. METRO selected a public-private partnership model for the North and Southeast corridors, where the contracted firm would be responsible for vehicle procurement and operation and maintenance of those lines, and entered a contract with Washington Group International (WGI); METRO/WGI issued a request for proposals for 103 firm new vehicles and an option of up to 75 additional vehicles on August 31, 2007. Although the FTA reminded METRO about federal procurement rules on multiple occasions, METRO told prospective bidders that Buy America rules did not apply (presumably because the RFP was issued by the private contractor) and awarded a contract to CAF on March 4, 2009. Later that month, METRO requested a Buy America waiver for two pilot vehicles which would be assembled by CAF in Spain; the FTA denied the waiver request, stating that CAF had signed a certificate of compliance with Buy America requirements. METRO proceeded to use local funds to pursue the pilot vehicle procurement, and the FTA opened an investigation in April 2010. Ultimately, the CAF contract was canceled and of the  million contract was refunded to METRO.
The North/Red Line extension opened on December 21, 2013 (ahead of its projected early 2014 opening), increasing the line to its current total of and 24 stations. Central Station was added to the Red Line to provide transfers to/from the Purple and Green lines.

After numerous delays, all but two stations on the eastern end of the Green Line opened on May 23, 2015, while Cesar Chavez/67th Street and Magnolia Park entered service on January 11, 2017 after the construction of an overpass. Both the Purple and Green lines, together costing $1.3 billion, share a track segment in downtown, then run east and diverge.

=== Cancellations and BRT conversions ===
Plans for the Inner Katy rail line (east of Loop 610) under the METRO Solutions Plan (2003) conflicted with existing plans to widen the Katy Freeway west of Loop 610 to Texas State Highway 6. A Major Investment Study for the Katy Freeway Expansion was started in 1994 and approved in October 1997; the draft and final environmental impact statements were completed by August 30, 2002. In preparation, TxDOT purchased a portion of the right-of-way for the old Katy Railroad from Union Pacific (UP) in 1992 for $78 million, and the UP was scheduled to begin track removal in the last half of 1997. In all, of track were removed from Katy/Fort Bend Road in Brookshire to Canal Street in Houston. The adopted alternative for the expanded freeway called for an at-grade roadway with a total right-of-way width of ; in each direction, there would be two managed lanes closest to the center, flanked by four main lanes, up to two auxiliary lanes, and three frontage road lanes. That year, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between TxDOT, METRO, and Harris County, which identified requirements for the managed lanes, including prioritization of METRO buses and an option to convert those lanes to light rail transit in the future. The Gulf Coast Institute criticized the contradictions between TxDOT, which selected the managed lanes over rail due to insufficient projected transit demand, and METRO&#x27;s Solutions Plan, which noted that a Katy line could &quot;offer the potential for sizeable transit volume&quot;. By 2005, the Inner Katy corridor had been dropped from METRO Solutions.

METRO began negotiations with Southern Pacific (SP) to acquire the tracks and right-of-way alongside the Eastex Freeway that were formerly owned by the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railroad and a conceptual agreement was reached in December 1992; METRO would re-use the line for commuter rail service. However, after METRO decided to purchase a subset of the original agreement at a fraction of the agreed-upon price, SP sued and the a settlement was reached in 1997, with METRO purchasing for $72 million. Shortly after the purchase was completed, business interests pressured METRO into selling a portion of the right-of-way to the Harris County Toll Road Authority, which was eventually developed into the Westpark Tollway. By 2006, a proposed revised corridor along Richmond was drawing opposition from local business owners and Texas Rep. Martha Wong, who advocated for a route along Westpark instead. In August 2010, a budget shortfall of $49 million was announced by METRO, which halted progress on the University Line. The line had received a final Federal Record of Decision letter from the FTA in July but METRO had not announced a construction schedule or funding plan. Since then, BRT service has been proposed along the corridor instead.

METRO published the &quot;Uptown-West Loop Planning Study&quot; in 2004, which was a proposed light rail line along Post Oak Boulevard and West Inner Loop, connecting new stations at Bellaire (at the junction with U.S. Route 59) and Northwest Transit Center (at the junction with I-10). In the alternatives analysis, bus rapid transit (BRT) service was considered and dismissed as an alternative to light rail, due to the reduced capacity of BRT vehicles and the strong community preference for rail. Due to lack of funds, it was announced in early 2013 that the Uptown Line will be constructed initially as a bus rapid transit (BRT) line. The design will feature the ability to easily convert the line to light rail in the future. This will allow the line to be functional as early as 2017.

Following METRO&#x27;s 2010 annual audit, the agency decided to cancel the Burnett Plaza project. $41 million was spent on the initial design of the proposed intermodal terminal. This was part of a $168 million asset liquidation. The price of the land $21 million is valued separately. $61 million of the liquidation was listed as &quot;unrealized assets&quot;, including charges for redundant design contractors and changes.

=== Future plans ===
METRO put the METRONext Moving Forward Plan before Houston area voters in November 2019; voters approved the $3.5 billion bond by a margin of nearly two-to-one. Bonds issued will be used to extend existing light rail service. The Red Line will be expanded North to the North Shepherd park &amp; ride, and both the Green and Purple lines will be expanded east and south to William P Hobby Airport, and west to the Houston Municipal Courthouse. In addition, new BRT lines would be set up along corridors that had previously been identified for light rail transit including Inner Katy and University; another new BRT line would bridge the gap between the northern terminus of the Red Line and Bush Airport, and a new north-south BRT service would operate along the western leg of Beltway 8.

A long extension or possible commuter rail line from Fannin South to Sugar Land and beyond has been studied since 2004. The route would parallel U.S. 90A in the existing right-of-way used by the Glidden subdivision owned by UP. In 2011, the Southwest Rail Corridor was proposed to connect Fannin South and Missouri City. This was not constructed, but the METRONext plan includes a similar route extended to Sugar Land which it describes as a &quot;future METRORail potential partnership.&quot;

== Operations ==
The light rail lines operate all 7 days of the week. They begin operations at 3:30 a.m. weekdays and 4:30 a.m. weekends and end service at 12:30 a.m. Monday through Thursday nights, 2:45 a.m. Friday and Saturday nights and, 12:30 a.m. Sunday nights. Scheduled train frequency varies from 6 minutes during the day to 20 minutes off-peak.

The light rail lines can handle three-minute headways during peak hours and have a design capacity of 8,000 people/hour in each direction while using two-car trains with such a headway.
The scheduled time for an end-to-end trip through the entire Red Line is on average 55 minutes.

Tracks on all three lines are usually in dedicated right-of-way in the center of the street; however, the southbound tracks between the Wheeler and Museum-District stations run along the left side. The downtown Houston tracks along Capitol and Rusk streets run along the south side of the streets. Furthermore, these light rail trains run in mixed traffic, sharing a lane with buses and other vehicles — often being their turn lane.

METRORail operations are controlled from Houston TranStar, a traffic and emergency management center for the city and surrounding region. Trains have priority signalling at intersections except for six stations near the medical center and downtown. At prioritized intersections, traffic lights for road traffic in all directions turn red when a train approaches.

=== Route and infrastructure ===
==== Red (Main Street) Line ====
The Red Line is a double-tracked, line with 24 stations approximately apart, running from to the Northline Transit Center Station. Almost the entire route is at grade and on city streets. The original 2004 portion from Fannin South to UH-Downtown is entirely at ground-level and at-grade with street traffic. However, on the North/Red Line Extension (from UH-Downtown to Northline Transit Center two small portions are elevated: the Burnett Transit Center station and a small section of track between Melbourne/North Lindale and Northline Transit Center on Fulton Street. Power is supplied at 600–750 volts DC from overhead wires, with nine substations (for the original 2004 portion). The line follows Main Street for eight stations from UH–Downtown to Wheeler station, then follows Fannin Street for the remainder of the original route until Fannin South. Northbound trains run on San Jacinto Street (rather than Fannin) for a small section of the route between the Wheeler and Museum District stations. The North/Red Extension runs along North Main Street until just after Quitman Near Northside, then turns onto Boundary Street until just before Fulton/North Central, and then runs along Fulton Street until Northline Transit Center.

Significant businesses and institutions along the Red Line route include the University of Houston–Downtown, Houston&#x27;s restaurant district near Preston Station, the Downtown Transit Center, Houston&#x27;s museum district, Rice University, Memorial Hermann Hospital, the Texas Medical Center and NRG Stadium.

A park &amp; ride parking lot is available at one station: Fannin South. It has approximately 1,200 parking spaces. Parking fees included a daily rate of $3 and a monthly hangtag contract of $40. The Burnett Transit Center was designed to have a park and ride facility next to the Casa de Amigos Health Center; it was scheduled to open in late 2014, but the project was canceled in 2011 and scaled back to a multimodal stop.

For the original 2004 portion of the Red Line, the architectural firm Pierce Goodwin Alexander &amp; Linville, of Houston, was in charge of the final architectural/engineering design and design support, with a $2.3 million contract. However, all stations south of Burnett Transit Center were designed by the Houston office of St. Louis-based architectural firm Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum. All stations are of similar design— long and partially covered by glass roofs. Station length was constrained by the distance between crosswalks in downtown city blocks; station platforms are low-floor and high. The line includes a bridge along Main Street which separates the double-track main line and a third pocket track from UP&#x27;s line and three streets. A yard and a maintenance facility for the Red Line is connected by loop track to the south of the Fannin South station.
The right-of-way and the stations for the original 2004 line were built by three contractors for approximately $115 million: Texas Sterling Construction Co. of Houston, Bencon Management of Houston and Beers Construction Co. of Atlanta. The line construction was divided into five sections, with a resident engineer for each section, to speed up construction.

==== Purple (Southeast) and Green (East End) Lines ====
The , 10-station Purple Line, and seven stations of the , 9-station Green Line opened on May 23, 2015. The final two stations of the Green Line opened on January 11, 2017. A storage yard/inspection facility is located off of Harrisburg and Clifton.

=== Fares ===
The standard fare for the rail lines is $1.25 for both cash and METRO Q Card riders; $3 for a Day Pass. A discount fare is available for qualified MetroQ Fare Card riders [those who are seniors 65-69, disabled, Medicare cardholders or full-time students (elementary, high school and university)]; the discounted fare is $0.60 for cash or $1.50 for a Day Pass. All discount riders must show ID (except for elementary and high school students). Free rides to METRO buses are available with the MetroQ Fare Card only, for 3 hours in any direction. Paper transfers from buses were accepted from July 2015 to March 2016 on a trial basis boarded for free: before noon good until 15:00, after it to end of service day. The MetroQ Fare Card holders can earn &quot;Rider Rewards&quot; of 5 free trips for every 50 paid trips. Tickets and cards are purchased from machines at the stations. No charge applies to Texans/Dash/Dynamo home game days with game ticket, nor to seniors over 70 or to children under 5 who ride with an adult (limit 3).

Fare collection, like most light rail systems in the United States, is based on a proof-of-payment system: METRO&#x27;s fare inspectors randomly check tickets and cards aboard trains. Failure to pay the fare is a Class C Misdemeanor and is subject to a fine of up to $500.
Consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited on the train platform and subject to the same fine as a Class C Misdemeanor.

=== Ridership ===
In the first year of METRORail, daily ridership, though increasing from 12,102 in January to 32,941 in October, tapered off slightly in the last two months of the year, and &quot;fell short of the 35,000 goal transit officials had set&quot; in early 2004, according to the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;. The line reached 75 million boardings in December 2011, four years ahead of schedule, but throughout that year, ridership numbers remained flat or showed small decreases. By 2012, average weekday ridership was 36,250.

The North/Red Line Extension exceeded ridership projections by 62% in the first month of operation, averaging 4,200 weekday boardings in January 2014; this was 1,600 more boardings than projected for the extension through September 30, 2014 (the end of the METRORail&#x27;s fiscal year).

Notable records in ridership have occurred on the following dates:

*February 1, 2004: 64,005 passengers rode the METRORail to Super Bowl XXXVIII
*February 23, 2004: 54,193 passenger boardings were recorded, the highest weekday at the time
*February 27, 2007: 56,388 passengers were recorded the day of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo
*March 15, 2012: 70,611 passengers were recorded; many of whom attended the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo and a performance by The Band Perry after the rodeo at the Reliant Park sports complex.
* March 19, 2014: 76,925 passengers were recorded due in part to the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.
* February 4, 2017: 109,500 passenger boardings were recorded during Super Bowl LI
*November 4, 2017: 125,000 passenger boardings were recorded the day of the Houston Astros World Series victory parade and rally held in Downtown.

== Rolling stock ==
METRO currently operates three generations of light rail vehicles. All of them are double-articulated, 70% low-floor vehicles with four low-platform doors per side to provide level boarding.

=== H1 series ===
The original fleet of 18 vehicles was built by Siemens Transportation Systems in Sacramento, California; the $117.9 million contract for Siemens included the light rail infrastructure (traction power, signals, and communication systems) and an initial order of 15 light rail vehicles. Three additional vehicles were ordered in 2002. 101 to 115 were delivered in 2003 and 116 to 118 in 2004, for the opening of the first stage of the Red Line. Designated by the manufacturer as S70 and based roughly on earlier vehicles built for Portland&#x27;s MAX Light Rail system, each vehicle is long and has a top speed of . They have a capacity of 72 seated and approximately 169 standing passengers, or a total capacity of around 241 per car.
This approximately 250-person capacity has been reached on certain Super Bowl weekends.

The H1 series cars are distinguishable by their streamlined cab ends and rectangular headlamps, with the electronic destination sign (which have been modified to indicate the line with a colored square) mounted directly in front of the cab rather than above it. They are normally used only on the Red Line and can be operated as single cars or in trains of two cars coupled together, though two-car trains have become the norm due to increasing ridership and the arrival of the H2 series.

=== H2 series ===
For expansion of the METRORail system, METRO turned to CAF USA, with a total order of 105 cars placed in May 2010. A subsequent investigation by the Federal Transit Administration determined the procurement violated the Buy America Act, and the  million order was cancelled in February 2011. CAF gave a partial refund of  million, which METRO applied to the purchase of what would become the H2 series cars.

In the spring of 2011, METRO purchased a further 19 Siemens S70 vehicles (the same model as its original 18), citing the need to accommodate ridership that was 4 years ahead of expectations and to get cars more quickly. These cars were options under a contract for Utah Transit Authority&#x27;s TRAX system, which METRO purchased for $83 million after UTA decided not to exercise its options. As with the previous H1 generation, these new cars were built in Florin, California, but they differ slightly from the cars Utah received in detail, including having more air-conditioning units. They were delivered in October 2012 and entered service that December.

The H2 series cars are shorter than the H1 series, at in length, accommodate slightly fewer passengers (60 seated, 225 maximum), and have a lower maximum speed of . Externally, the H2 series are distinguishable by their flatter cab ends and circular headlamps, with the electronic destination sign (which use colored dots to indicate the line) conventionally mounted above the cab. Like the H1 series, they are normally used only on the Red Line and can be operated as single cars or in two-car trains. The H1 and H2 series are electrically compatible and can operate together in the same train.

=== H3 series ===
In September 2011, METRO approved the purchase of 39 vehicles from CAF upon receipt of a new proposal compliant with Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and &quot;Buy America&quot; guidelines. The first six of these cars were delivered in January 2015 and entered service shortly afterwards.

The H3 series cars, built in Elmira, New York and based on the CAF Urbos platform used in cities across Europe and Asia, are similar in size and capacity to the H1 series with a length of and accommodating a maximum of 242 passengers (64 seated), but are distinguishable by their boxier design and framed window panes. They are in operation on all three METRORail lines and can couple to form two-car trains; however, the H3 series is electrically incompatible with the older types and cannot operate with them in the same train.

=== H4 series ===
In February 2019, METRO ordered 14 additional Siemens S700 vehicles (H4), with interior modifications designed to improve passenger flow compared to the agency&#x27;s prior H1 and H2 series S70s. These vehicles result from the reassignment of options from Minneapolis–Saint Paul Metro Transit in May 2018. Metro Transit previously had signed a contract with Siemens to deliver 27 low floor S70 LRVs with options for up to 50 additional vehicles in 2016. These new vehicles would be used for the Southwest LRT (Green Line) and Bottineau LRT (Blue Line) extension projects; subsequently, Metro Transit determined they would only need 27 vehicles for Southwest and 28 vehicles for Bottineau, leaving 22 options unexercised, and METRO requested the transfer of 14 of those options in 2018. Siemens re-designated the S70, as originally ordered with modifications in the center section per Metro Transit&#x27;s needs for passenger flow, to the S700 in 2020. They entered into service on 15 December 2022.

== Incidents and crashes ==
For a full year before the Metrorail system&#x27;s opening, a program to prepare drivers to share Houston streets with the Metrorail trains was conducted, consisting of driver safety classes, community forums and public service announcements. By August, the system averaged six crashes per month, 20 times worse than the national average for light rail systems. The high rate of incidents gave rise to local derogatory nicknames among detractors such as the &quot;Wham Bam tram&quot; and &quot;Danger Train.&quot; METRO has consistently blamed driver error as the cause of the high collision rate and the transit agency&#x27;s police department regularly tickets motorists who cross paths with the train. An independent panel of transportation experts at Texas A&amp;M University issued a report in 2004 finding no fundamental flaws with the Metrorail system, although this report did recommend minor adjustments to signal timing and signage.

The 100th accident, as defined by METRO, occurred on August 10, 2005. In the judgement of METRO police, only two of these were the fault of the train operator. Most crashes resulted from drivers turning into the trains or running red lights. Following the Texas A&amp;M report, METRO implemented four-way red lights at some crossings and other safety measures which led to a 75% reduction in incidents per train mile even as service ramped up. Critics have also noted the fact that the system is at-grade, while supporters contend that lack of federal funding due to political opposition made construction of a grade separated rail line unfeasible. Sociology and urban studies professor Stephen Klineberg argues that the high rate of crashes in Houston is attributable to the high rate of automobile driving and low rate of walking in Houston.

<text>Thomas B. Kin Chong (born May 24, 1938) is a Canadian-American comedian, actor, musician and activist. He is known for his role/inspiration in the marijuana industry, his marijuana-themed Cheech &amp; Chong comedy albums and movies with Cheech Marin, and playing the character Leo on Fox&#x27;s &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. He became a naturalized United States citizen in the late 1980s.

== Early life ==
Thomas B. Kin Chong was born on May 24, 1938, in Edmonton, Alberta. His mother was a Canadian of Scottish and Irish ancestry, and his father was a Chinese man who immigrated in the 1930s. After arriving in Canada, the senior Chong first lived with an aunt in Vancouver. Tommy had an older brother, Stan (1936–2018).

As a youth, Tommy Chong moved with his family to Calgary, settling in a conservative neighbourhood Chong has referred to as &quot;Dog Patch&quot;. He has said that his father had &quot;been wounded in World War II and there was a veterans&#x27; hospital in Calgary. He bought a $500 house in Dog Patch and raised his family on $50 a week.&quot; In an interview, Chong later described how he dropped out of Crescent Heights High School &quot;when I was 16 but probably just before they were going to throw me out anyway.&quot; He played guitar to make money. &quot;I discovered that music could get you laid, even if you were a scrawny, long-haired, geeky-looking guy like me.&quot;

== Career ==
=== Music ===
By the early 1960s, Chong was playing guitar for a Calgary soul group called the Shades. The Shades moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where the band&#x27;s name changed to &quot;Little Daddy &amp; the Bachelors&quot;. They recorded a single, &quot;Too Much Monkey Business&quot; / &quot;Junior&#x27;s Jerk&quot;. Together with bandmember Bobby Taylor, Chong opened a Vancouver nightclub in 1963. Formerly the Alma Theatre, they called it the “Blues Palace”. They brought in the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue, which had never been to Vancouver before. Although Little Daddy &amp; the Bachelors built up a small following, things soured when they went with Chong&#x27;s suggestion and had themselves billed as &quot;Four Niggers and a Chink&quot; (or, bowing to pressure, &quot;Four N&#x27;s and a C&quot;) before taking on the moniker Bobby Taylor &amp; the Vancouvers.

In 1965, the Vancouvers signed with Gordy Records (a subsidiary of Detroit&#x27;s Motown Records). They recorded their debut album, an eponymous release, and their debut single, the Tommy Chong co-composition, &quot;Does Your Mama Know About Me,&quot; peaked at number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. While on tour in Chicago for a short time, the band followed opening act the Jackson 5. Chong later referred to the young Michael Jackson as a &quot;cute little guy&quot;. After the band released two additional singles, Chong and bandmate Wes Henderson missed a Friday night performance to apply for green cards so they could become American citizens. Chong was fired by Chris Clark and Motown producer Johnny Bristol for arriving late to the gig. Later, when Berry Gordy told Chong that he wasn&#x27;t fired after all, that it had been a mistake, Chong said he wanted to stay fired. &quot;I said I want to become a Berry Gordy, I don&#x27;t want to just work for a Berry Gordy. And he says I can, I can dig that. So he was nice. He gave me $5,000 as the severance and to me that was a fortune.&quot; The group broke up shortly afterwards, when Chong tried to reduce the number of players covered by the Vancouvers&#x27; contract. He intended that he, Taylor, and Henderson would constitute the group, while other members would be classified as sidemen and session artists.

=== Cheech &amp; Chong ===

Chong co-wrote and performed on many Cheech &amp; Chong comedy albums, four of which were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. He and Cheech Marin shared the 1973 award in this category for &quot;Los Cochinos&quot;.

He also directed four of the duo&#x27;s films, while co-writing and starring in all seven with Cheech.

=== &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, biopic and guest spots ===

Cheech &amp; Chong, while a very successful comedy act, split in 1985 due to creative differences and Marin&#x27;s desire to focus on a mainstream acting career. This began a difficult time for Chong. He developed an unsold pilot for CBS called &quot;The Martinez Family&quot;, which was redeveloped as the 1988 sitcom &quot;Trial and Error&quot;. In 1990, he directed, wrote and starred in the movie &quot;Far Out Man&quot;. He did not act regularly until filling the recurring role (later a regular role) as the fun-loving, aging hippie &quot;Leo&quot; (similar to his Chong character) on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. Chong was absent during the fifth and sixth seasons of the show as he was serving a brief jail sentence; upon his release, he returned to the series for its final two seasons. He also played a role as a hippie in &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;.

Chong was originally going to voice the character of Shenzi, the hyena in the Disney film &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Cheech Marin voiced Banzai. (The Shenzi character was changed to a female and was voiced instead by Whoopi Goldberg.) Chong provided the voice of the character Yax in the 2016 Disney film &quot;Zootopia&quot;.

In September 2005, &quot;a/k/a Tommy Chong&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. The documentary, produced, written and directed by Josh Gilbert, chronicles Chong&#x27;s comedic and personal history. It includes material related to his prosecution by the US Justice Department and imprisonment. The project features interviews with Cheech Marin, Bill Maher, George Thorogood, Peter Coyote, Lou Adler, Eric Schlosser and Jay Leno. In 2011, Chong appeared as a Judge in an episode of &quot;Franklin &amp; Bash.&quot;

On September 4, 2014, Chong was announced as one of the celebrities participating on the 19th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He paired with professional dancer Peta Murgatroyd. Despite being at the bottom of the leaderboard numerous times, Chong and Murgatroyd were able to make it to the night of the semi-finals but were eliminated at the end of that night. Chong is the oldest contestant to have made it to the semi-finals of the show.
On April 4, 2015, Chong appeared as a guest speaker at the annual &quot;Hash Bash&quot; event in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which focuses on cannabis legalization.

In November 2017, Chong guest-starred as himself in an episode of the &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; spinoff &quot;Out of the Park: USA&quot;. In 2017, he also partnered with smoking subscription box service Daily High Club to create the DHC Tommy Chong Signature Smoking Supply Box.

On January 9, 2019, Chong competed in season one of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Pineapple&quot; where he sang &quot;I Will Survive&quot; by Gloria Gaynor.

On May 23, 2019, Chong appeared on episode #1303 of the internet video podcast &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot;, hosted by Joe Rogan.

On June 19, 2019, Chong appeared on episode #694 of the internet video podcast &quot;The Church Of What&#x27;s Happening Now&quot;, hosted by Joey Diaz.

In April 2020, Chong&#x27;s brand started working alongside the fashion brand Slicks.
On December 18, 2020, Chong appeared in the online cannabis publication &quot;The Green Fund&quot; for an interview to discuss his career with Cheech &amp; Chong and his upcoming branded dispensaries.

== Legal issues ==
=== &quot;U.S. v. Chong&quot; ===
In 2003, Chong became caught up in two American investigations, code-named Operation Pipe Dreams and Operation Headhunter, which tried to trace drug traffic and users through businesses selling drug paraphernalia, mostly bongs. Operation Pipe Dreams was based in Pittsburgh. US Attorney for Western Pennsylvania Mary Beth Buchanan oversaw the case. The estimated cost of Operation Pipe Dreams was over $12 million and included the resources of 2,000 law enforcement officers. Fifty-five companies that sold drug paraphernalia over the Internet were the subject of the investigation, with Nice Dreams being one.

Chong was charged for his part in financing and promoting Chong Glass/Nice Dreams, a company started by his son Paris. His case never went to trial, as his attorney negotiated a plea agreement with the US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Office. He admitted to distributing 7,500 bongs and water pipes on the Internet through Nice Dreams. Chong agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute drug paraphernalia in exchange for non-prosecution of his wife, Shelby, and his son, Paris. Chong cooperated with the government and was the first of the Operation Pipe Dreams defendants to plead guilty.

At Chong&#x27;s sentencing, Assistant U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania Mary McKeen Houghton said in her arguments that Tommy Chong &quot;used his public image to promote this crime&quot; and marketed his products to children. U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan also was present at the sentencing in Pittsburgh and released a statement to the press stating: &quot;There are consequences for violating the law, even if the violator is a well-known entertainer like Thomas Chong.&quot;

While Chong argued for community service and home detention at his sentencing, the district judge, Arthur J. Schwab, denied his requests and sentenced him to 9 months in federal prison, a fine of $20,000, forfeiture of $103,514, and the loss of all merchandise seized during the raid of his business. Chong served his sentence at the Taft Correctional Institution from October 8, 2003, to July 7, 2004. He was a cellmate of &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; Jordan Belfort, who credits him for encouraging Belfort to write his memoirs. They have remained friends.

These events were among those chronicled in &quot;a/k/a Tommy Chong&quot; (2006), a documentary by Josh Gilbert. It premiered theatrically at the New York Film Forum in New York City and won awards. His time in prison was also a main point in his book, &quot;The I Chong&quot;.

=== Controversy ===

While government officials denied that Chong was treated any differently from the other defendants, supporters felt his celebrity status was being used against him. Chong&#x27;s publicist Brandie Knight said the Chong family was shocked by the raid. &quot;We&#x27;ve done everything the right way, and the government is saying there is no right way,&quot; Knight said. Supporters started the &quot;Free Tommy Chong!&quot; movement that called for his release. They questioned why Chong was prosecuted rather than his son Paris Chong, who was CEO of the business. They also pointed to the disparity in sentences between Chong&#x27;s and those of other defendants, and they protested the DEA tactics used in the investigation.

Paris Chong had started Nice Dreams in 1999. He was never charged with his crimes in relation to the investigation, as part of a plea bargain. When asked why the government had focused on Chong rather than his son the CEO, US Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan said that &quot;Tommy Chong was the more responsible corporate officer because he financed and marketed the product.&quot;

Of the 55 people who were subjects of the investigation, Chong was the only one without previous convictions who received jail time. When questioned on the sentencing, U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan noted that Chong had never gone to trial and made a plea bargain. She said, &quot;He was a relatively new player, but he had the ability to market products like no other.&quot;

During its investigation of Nice Dreams, federal agents posed as head-shop owners from Beaver County in western Pennsylvania. They asked Paris Chong to sell them pipes through the mail to a fictitious shop in the town of Beaver Falls, from Pittsburgh. Paris Chong had been prohibited from selling to Pittsburgh or anywhere in Western Pennsylvania because of the successful federal prosecution of Akhil Kumar Mishra and his wife, Rajeshwari, who had two head shops in the city. Accounts differ as to who in Nice Dreams went against Chong&#x27;s prohibition, or even if it had been made up by the defence, but the sales did take place to the agents. This enabled the U.S. Attorney to show jurisdiction in Pennsylvania for Chong&#x27;s illegal activities, as opposed to California, which was the base for Nice Dreams.

=== Aftermath ===
In December 2004, Chong was to appear in an off-Broadway show entitled &quot;The Marijuana-Logues&quot;, a parody of Eve Ensler&#x27;s &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. His parole officer barred him from the show and the tour was cancelled, as audience members were smoking pot during performances. Such exposure would cause Chong to violate the terms of his parole. In 2006, Chong published a memoir about his experiences in jail and his exploration of meditation, called &quot;The I Chong: Meditations from the Joint&quot;.

In 2010, Chong and Cyril Wecht appeared at a Democratic Party fundraiser in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to aid the campaign against Mary Beth Buchanan, the United States Attorney who prosecuted him. She was running as a Republican candidate for the United States House of Representatives. She was defeated in the Republican primary.

=== Seizure of &quot;a/k/a Tommy Chong&quot; DVDs ===
On May 7, 2008, federal agents raided Spectrum Labs in an investigation related to its &quot;detoxification&quot; products. The search was one of nine conducted for Operation True Test, an investigation being led by Buchanan, still the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. It targeted companies that sold so-called &quot;masking products,&quot; intended to help drug users pass employer drug tests. No federal law bans such products; they are regulated on a state-by-state basis. Of the nine search warrants issued, none was for businesses within Buchanan&#x27;s district.

Chong claimed that federal agents had seized 8,000–10,000 copies of the yet-to-be released documentary, &quot;a/k/a Tommy Chong,&quot; from Spectrum Labs, but their attorney said no DVDs were taken. In a press release, Chong said: &quot;[The seizure of the DVDs is] a way to punish the distributor financially. There&#x27;s no way to get the DVDs back until the investigation is over.&quot; Chong said he did not have any ownership of the film. The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; later amended its story, saying that an &quot;undisclosed number of DVDs was taken&quot;. It noted the government is not required to disclose a reason for the seizure as the raid was part of &quot;an ongoing investigation&quot;.

== Reuniting with Cheech ==

Chong appeared with his long-time comedy partner, Cheech Marin, in a 2000 &quot;South Park&quot; episode called &quot;Cherokee Hair Tampons&quot;.

In mid-2008, Cheech &amp; Chong reunited and started touring. The tour was called &quot;Light Up America and Canada&quot; and &quot;The Felimony Tour&quot;, which referred to major experiences of each. In October 2008, they appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, the &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; Show, and the &quot;Ron and Fez&quot; Show on SIRIUS/XM Satellite Radio. On March 1, 2010, they hosted &quot;WWE Raw&quot; in Oklahoma City. On March 13, 2011, Cheech &amp; Chong were guest stars on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;A Midsummer&#x27;s Nice Dream&quot;, where, during a reunion tour, Homer briefly replaced Chong before the pair reconciled.

Cheech Marin appeared in Tommy Chong&#x27;s first dance in the season opener of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; on September 15, 2014. Around this same time, Cheech and Chong appeared together on the Internet-based, pro-marijuana show, &quot;Getting Doug with High&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1960, Chong married Maxine Sneed, the older sister of drummer Floyd Sneed, in Canada. They raised two daughters, Rae Dawn (b. 1961) and Robbi Chong (b. 1965). They divorced in 1970.

In 1975, Chong married Shelby Fiddis in Los Angeles. They had three children, including the actor Precious Chong. They also adopted Marcus Wyatt (b. 1967) in 1978. Marcus took the surname of his adoptive parents and siblings when he turned eighteen.

In an interview, Tommy Chong shared that he smoked with Willie Nelson, Snoop Dogg, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and his bodybuilding buddies, also with all the Beatles except Paul McCartney. He also calls George Harrison his favorite smoking friend.

Tommy Chong is a marijuana activist and supports legalizing the plant&#x27;s use. He is a regular contributor to &quot;Cannabis Culture Magazine&quot; and sits on the NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) advisory board.

=== Cancer diagnosis ===
Chong announced on June 9, 2012, that he was battling prostate cancer. He described the cancer &quot;as a slow stage one [that I&#x27;ve] had for a long time&quot;. He said that he had been drug free for about three years, during which time he began having prostate-related problems. On June 16, 2015, he said he had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer and was &quot;using cannabis like crazy&quot; to endure the treatment.

In 2019, Chong announced that he is &quot;cancer-free&quot;. He also opined that stress could have been a cause of his condition.

<text>City networks can either refer to a membership organization city leaders join to connect their city to other municipalities, or to a geographical concept used to describe inter-connectivity of cities on different levels (trade, railways, culture etc.).

== City networks in international cooperation ==
In the perspective of international cooperation, the term &quot;city network&quot; refers to a membership organization that cities join either to take part to specific projects, to be represented by geographical specificity, or to assert political commitments. One of the main reasons why cities join a city network is to learn good practices from peer cities that have similar characteristics and face comparable challenges (infrastructure, urban transport, water and sanitation, smart city, etc.).

== City networks as a geographical concept ==
City networks are a geographical concept studying connections between cities by placing the cities as nodes on a network. In modern conceptions of cities, these networks play an important role in understanding the nature of cities. City networks can identify physical connections to other places, such as railways, canals, scheduled flights, or telecommunication networks, typically done using graph theory. City networks also exist in immaterial form, such as trade, global finance, markets, migration, cultural links, shared social spaces or shared histories. There are also networks of religious nature, in particular through pilgrimage.

The city itself is then regarded as the node where different networks run together. Some urban thinkers have argued that cities can only be understood if the context of the city&#x27;s connections is understood.

It has been argued that city networks are a key ingredient of what defines a city, along with the number of people (density) and the particular way of life in cities.

<doc id="316284" wikidata="Q3880820" url="?curid=316284" title="Oddjob">
<text>Oddjob (often written as &quot;Odd Job&quot;) is a fictional character in the espionage novels and films featuring James Bond. He is a henchman to the villain Auric Goldfinger in the 1959 James Bond novel &quot;Goldfinger&quot; and its 1964 film adaptation. In the film adaptation of &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, he was played by the Japanese-American actor and professional wrestler Harold Sakata. Oddjob, who also appears in the &quot;James Bond&quot; animated series and in several video games, is one of the most popular characters in the Bond series.

==Appearances==

===Novel===
Oddjob&#x27;s real name is unknown. Goldfinger names him to describe his duties to his employer. A Korean, like all of Goldfinger&#x27;s staff, he is extremely powerful, as shown in one sequence where he breaks the thick oak railing of a staircase with knife-hand strikes (colloquially known as &#x27;karate chops&#x27;) and shatters a mantel with his foot. When Bond expresses surprise at these feats, Goldfinger explains that Oddjob trains extensively to toughen the striking surfaces of his hands and feet, which have developed a tough callus, significantly increasing his striking power.

Oddjob is described as being a &quot;squat&quot; man with &quot;arms like thighs&quot;, black teeth, and a &quot;sickly zoo-smell&quot;. In contrast with the film, where he is depicted as a man of average height, the novel describes his breaking of a mantelpiece seven feet off the ground and six inches above his head, placing his height at 6 ft 6 in (198 cm). In an early edition, Oddjob is described as having a black belt in the Japanese martial art of karate; in later editions it is learned that Oddjob practised taekwondo and hapkido in his native Korea but went on to earn his black belt in karate in Japan. The earlier novel tells of his hatred of being mistaken for Japanese, mainly due to Korean anger at the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910–1945).

Oddjob&#x27;s signature weapon is a razor-edged bowler hat, which he wears at all times and can throw with deadly accuracy. He is also a skilled archer, able to fire an arrow through a ring as it is held aloft. Due to a cleft palate, he has a speech defect that renders his speech unintelligible to everyone except Goldfinger. In addition to killing people who might cause trouble for Goldfinger, Oddjob functions as his guard, chauffeur, and manservant (though not his golf caddy, as depicted in the film).

He is killed when Bond uses a knife to shatter the window next to his seat on an aircraft, which depressurizes the plane and blows Oddjob out of the window, a fate transferred to Auric Goldfinger in the film version.

===Film===
At the beginning of &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, Oddjob is seen only as a silhouette against a wall as he knocks Bond unconscious at the Fontainebleau Hotel, after which he and/or Goldfinger kills Bond girl Jill Masterson, with whom Bond had spent the night, through &quot;skin suffocation&quot; by painting her entire body with gold paint.

When Bond meets Goldfinger for a round of golf, Oddjob is seen in full for the first time. Goldfinger describes him as &quot;an admirable manservant but mute&quot;. He only has four lines of &#x27;dialogue&#x27; throughout the film: in his first line, upon pretending to have found Goldfinger&#x27;s missing golf ball, he exclaims, &quot;Aha!&quot;. The second time, after killing Tilly Masterson, he instructs his men to dispose of her body by merely pointing at them and saying, &quot;Ah! Ah!&quot;. The third time, he says &quot;Ah!&quot; to order Bond to put on a gas mask before entering Fort Knox. The fourth time, as Bond electrocutes him in Fort Knox, he yells a final long, loud &quot;Arrgh!&quot;.

Oddjob acts as Goldfinger&#x27;s personal chauffeur, bodyguard, and golf caddy. He wears a bowler hat with a sharpened steel rim, using it as a lethal weapon in the style of a chakram (an Indian throwing weapon) or a flying guillotine. It is powerful and capable of cutting through steel and decapitating a stone statue. He uses it to kill Tilly Masterson by breaking her neck.

Physically, Oddjob is extremely strong and resilient; he crushes a golf ball with one hand, and during the climactic fight scene with Bond, he is struck in the chest by a thrown gold bar and struck in the head with a wooden object used as a club. He barely flinches after both these attacks. However, he is never mentioned to be a karate expert. He is also fanatically loyal to Goldfinger and his plot, as he is willing to die in the nuclear explosion in Fort Knox rather than allow the bomb&#x27;s disarmament.

Oddjob&#x27;s demeanor remains constant throughout the film. He smiles broadly whenever he encounters Bond, even during their fight scene. The only time he shows anything resembling fear or wariness is when Bond attempts to use Oddjob&#x27;s hat against him. Oddjob dodges the hat, causing it to get stuck between a pair of metal bars. When he retrieves his hat and tries to free it, Bond grabs a sparking wire severed by the hat earlier and thrusts the open end onto the bars. The electric current transfers to the bars and then to the metal in the hat&#x27;s rim, which electrocutes Oddjob to death. When asked what happened to him, Bond replies, &quot;he blew a fuse&quot;.

===Other appearances===
Oddjob appears in the animated series &quot;James Bond Jr.&quot; with a miniature top hat (in place of the customary bowler hat), sunglasses, and hip-hop style clothes (not only does he wear purple instead of black, but he wears more casual attire as opposed to his live-action counterpart&#x27;s dress suit), revealing that the electric shock did not kill him, but knocked him unconscious. The Americans arrest him before he escapes again in the series. When not wearing his hat, his hair is now more flat-top. Like his movie counterpart, he rarely speaks.

In the video game &quot;James Bond 007&quot;, Oddjob appears as a henchman for the main villain, General Golgov. Bond encounters Oddjob at his hotel room in Marrakesh. The two fight and Bond is defeated and left stranded in a desert. Later on, Bond trails Oddjob to Tibet, only to be captured. Bond escapes confinement and obtains a shield to protect him from Oddjob&#x27;s hats, which he uses to deflect back at him. In this game, Oddjob speaks.

In the video game &quot;&quot;, Oddjob is a henchman of Goldfinger and initially a companion of GoldenEye. He is killed when GoldenEye tosses him over a rail into a pit inside the Hoover Dam after he attacks GoldenEye.

Oddjob appears in the James Bond video games &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; and &quot;007: Nightfire&quot; as a playable character for use in multiplayer modes. His short stature in &quot;Goldeneye&quot; made him infamously hard to hit and often banned as a House rule. In &quot;Nightfire&quot;, he can use his hat as a unique throwing weapon that returns after 30 seconds. Oddjob is also a playable multiplayer character in the 2010 remake game &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;.

In Dynamite Entertainment&#x27;s ongoing comic book title &quot;James Bond 007&quot;, a new iteration of Oddjob is featured who is envisioned as a South Korean secret agent and a successor to another Oddjob (with Harold Sakata&#x27;s likeness), initially acting as a rival spy to Bond in a mutual assignment. His given name is John Lee.

==Oddjob&#x27;s hat==
The prop used in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; by Oddjob was made by British hat makers, Lock &amp; Co. The hat was then adapted by inserting a chakram into the brim. John Stears was responsible for making the hat fly.
After &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, the hat came into the possession of the James Bond Fan Club. In 1998, the hat was auctioned at Christie&#x27;s in a sale of James Bond memorabilia. The hat sold for £62,000. In 2002, the hat was lent out for an exhibition at the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television in Bradford, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the release of &quot;Dr. No&quot;. The hat was then auctioned again in 2006, when the final price was $36,000.
Replicas of the hat are sought after by collectors and replicas have been used as centrepieces for some exhibitions. In 2008, one replica joined the Bond exhibition at the National Motor Museum.

The television show &quot;MythBusters&quot; tested out the capabilities of Oddjob&#x27;s hat, testing whether or not it would have been able to decapitate a stone statue. It failed to do so, and the Mythbusters ultimately labeled it &#x27;Busted&#x27;.

Oddjob&#x27;s lethal hat was ranked tenth in a 2008 20th Century Fox poll for the most popular movie weapon, which surveyed approximately 2,000 films fans.

== Legacy ==
Oddjob&#x27;s popularity has resulted in numerous popular culture references and homages. In the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; video game franchise, recurring character Kung Lao&#x27;s throwable hat was inspired by Oddjob.

<text>The Texas Medical Center (TMC) is a neighborhood in south-central Houston, Texas, United States. It is immediately south of the Museum District and west of Texas State Highway 288.

Over 60 medical institutions, largely concentrated in a triangular area between Brays Bayou, Rice University, and Hermann Park, are members of the Texas Medical Center Corporation—a non-profit umbrella organization—which constitutes the largest medical center and life science destination in the world. As the world&#x27;s largest medical center, it&#x27;s also nicknamed as the &quot;Medical Mini-City&quot;. The TMC has the world&#x27;s highest density of clinical facilities for patient care, basic  biomedical sciences, and translational research. The neighborhood is .

The Texas Medical Center employs over 106,000 people, hosts 10 million patient encounters annually, and has a gross domestic product of US$25 billion. Over the decades, the TMC has expanded south of Brays Bayou toward NRG Park, and the organization has developed ambitious plans for a new &quot;innovation campus&quot; south of the river. The Medical Center / Astrodome area, highly populated with medical workers, is home to over 20,000 people.

The TMC is served by the METRORail Red Line, a north-south light rail route which connects the district to Downtown Houston and NRG Park.

==Overview==
The Texas Medical Center contains 54 medicine-related institutions, with 21 hospitals and eight specialty institutions, eight academic and research institutions, four medical schools, seven nursing schools, three public health organizations, two pharmacy schools and a dental school. All 54 institutions are not-for-profit. Among the affiliated medical schools are McGovern Medical School, Baylor College of Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and Texas A&amp;M College of Medicine. Some member institutions are located outside the city of Houston.

In 2016, more heart surgeries were performed at the Texas Medical Center than anywhere else in the world with 13,600 heart surgeries annually. 180,000 annual surgeries were performed. The TMC performed one surgery every three minutes. Over 25,000 babies were delivered each year, more than one baby every 20 minutes. The Texas Medical Center offered over 9,200 total patient beds.

The Center receives an average of 3,300 patient visits a day, and over eight million annual patient visits, including over 18,000 international patients. The TMC has over 750,000 ER visitors each year. In 2011, the center employed over 106,000 people, including 20,000 physicians, scientists, researchers and other advanced degree professionals in the life sciences. The TMC has over 160,000 visitors each day.

The Texas Medical Center houses the world&#x27;s largest children&#x27;s hospital (Texas Children&#x27;s Hospital), as well as the world&#x27;s largest cancer hospital (MD Anderson Cancer Center).

==History==

===Founding and early years===

Texas Medical Center was established in 1945, in part by funds endowed to the M.D. Anderson Foundation by businessman Monroe Dunaway Anderson. The fund&#x27;s first gift was a check of $1,000 to the Junior League Eye Fund for eyeglasses. In 1941, the Texas State Legislature granted funds to the University of Texas for the purpose of starting a cancer research hospital. The M.D. Anderson Foundation matched the state&#x27;s gift to the university by supplying funds and land on the condition that the hospital be established in Houston and named after its founder.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved the purchase of from the estate of local entrepreneur George Hermann (namesake of Hermann Park) in 1944 for the construction of a 1,000-bed naval hospital in Houston. The hospital, later renamed the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center, opened in 1946 and became a teaching facility for Baylor College of Medicine. In 1946, several projects were approved for inclusion in the Texas Medical Center including:
* Memorial Hermann–Texas Medical Center, built in the 1920s
* Shriners Hospitals for Children
* Baylor St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center, Houston Methodist Hospital
* The Texas Medical Center Library 

M.D. Anderson Hospital for Cancer Research of the University of Texas began construction in 1953. Texas Children&#x27;s Hospital admitted its first patient in 1954.

During the late 1950s, the Texas Institute for Rehabilitation and Research opened. The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute at Houston added the Gimbel Research Wing. Texas Woman&#x27;s University Nursing Program began instruction.

In 1962, the Texas Heart Institute was chartered and became affiliated with Baylor St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center (known then as St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Hospital) and Texas Children&#x27;s Hospital. Ben Taub General Hospital of the Harris Health System (known then as Harris County Hospital District) opened in 1963.

The TMC Library provides access to thousands of current digital books and journals and its John P. McGovern Historical Collections and Research Center houses rare medical books dating back to the 1500s, historical manuscripts such as the McGovern Collection on the History of Medicine, the Menninger Collection of Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis, and the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission which recorded the aftereffects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

===Recent developments===
In 1993, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center began a $248.6-million expansion project which constructed an inpatient pavilion with 512 beds, two research buildings, an outpatient clinic building, a faculty office building, and a patient-family hotel. From 2005 to present, the George and Cynthia Mitchell Basic Sciences Research Building, the Ambulatory Clinical Building, the Cancer Prevention Center and a new research building on the South Campus opened. The Proton Therapy Center, the largest facility in the United States where proton therapy is used to treat cancer, opened in July 2006.

In 2001, the Texas Medical Center was devastated by Tropical Storm Allison, which flooded basements and the first floors with 18 inches of water. This resulted in retrofitting of storm doors and barriers to prevent future flooding.

The Memorial Hermann Healthcare System constructed the six-floor, Memorial Hermann Heart &amp; Vascular Institute. Also recently completed around 2006 was the 30-story Memorial Hermann Medical Plaza, which is now the largest medical office building in the Texas Medical Center. At night, it became recognizable by its unique rainbow lantern. The construction was part of the system&#x27;s citywide &quot;Century Project&quot; initiative.

In 2005, Baylor College of Medicine opened the Baylor Clinic.

The Texas Children&#x27;s Hospital announced the largest investment and program expansion ever by a single pediatric organization. The $1.5 billion, four-year initiative was targeted for completion in 2010 and focused on research and accessibility. Major projects included the development of the neurological research institute ($215 million), the formation of a maternity center ($575 million), and the expansion of existing research facilities ($120 million). Texas Children&#x27;s was undertaking the development of one of the largest pediatric hospitals in a suburban setting ($220 million). The remainder of the expenditures were earmarked for new equipment and information systems.

In 2010, the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, including the John Sealy Hospital, became the 49th member of the Texas Medical Center and the first member-institution located outside the City of Houston.

Texas Medical Center–West Campus, serving residents of greater west Houston and adjacent areas, opened in January, 2011. Representing an initial investment of more than half a billion dollars, and almost 1.2 million square feet of healthcare development, the first two facilities to open in the new campus were the Texas Children’s Hospital and The Houston Methodist West Hospital. Texas Children’s West Campus is among the nation’s largest suburban pediatric hospitals.

In 2012, Texas Medical Center added the Shriners Hospitals for Children in Galveston, which treats pediatric trauma burns, as its 50th member institution.

In 2016, Texas Medical Center added San José Clinic, the community&#x27;s leading charity care clinic, as a member institution. Denise Castillo-Rhodes, executive vice president and chief financial officer of the Texas Medical Center, as well as a volunteer for San José Clinic noted when it became a member of TMC: &quot;San José Clinic serves a very important role in our community. Thus, it is a natural next step for the Clinic to join the Texas Medical Center as its newest member, as it continues to grow and provide extraordinary healthcare and education at affordable prices.&quot;.

In 2020, Texas A&amp;M announced plans to build a $550 million complex on the southern side of the TMC including academic, medical office, and housing buildings.

On June 24, 2020, The Texas Medical Center released data showing a 97% capacity in its ICU facilities due to the Covid-19 crisis. The Texas Medical Center has been a forefront of helping COVID-19 victims in Houston during the pandemic.

== Member Institutions ==
The Texas Medical Center (TMC) in Houston is the largest medical complex in the world, comprising 21 hospitals, 8 specialty institutions, 8 academic and research institutions, 4 medical schools, 3 nursing schools, 2 pharmacy schools, and 1 dental school. Additionally, The Texas Medical Center (TMC) hosts over 400 biotech and healthcare startups, alongside numerous major pharmaceutical companies, making it a leading hub for medical innovation.

==Cityscape and infrastructure==
The Texas Medical Center is a dense agglomeration of hospitals, schools, and ancillary businesses clustered on a triangular piece of land bordered by Rice University and the neighborhood of Southampton to the west, Brays Bayou to the south and east, and Hermann Park to the north. With 106,000 employees, the TMC has an employment density of approximately . The Texas Medical Center Corporation has compared its dense cityscape to the Chicago Loop and Lower Manhattan.

The core of the TMC is serviced by three large arterial roads. Main and Fannin streets run southwest to northeast, while Holcombe Boulevard runs west to east. The Texas Medical Center is one of the few employment centers in Houston which is not directly serviced by a freeway; the nearest freeway is Texas State Highway 288, located to the east of Hermann Park. To compensate, the TMC has developed strong transit connections; the entirety of the district is serviced by the METRORail Red Line, which runs along Fannin. Rail stops in the Medical Center include Memorial Hermann Hospital/Houston Zoo, Dryden/TMC, and the Texas Medical Center Transit Center, which doubles as a hub for local bus routes. These three stops are the busiest stations on the Red Line; ultimately, the district&#x27;s bus, light rail, and shuttle services deliver nearly 65,000 trips per day to and from the area.

In the 2010s, rapid development within the Medical Center began to strain existing transportation infrastructure; the average daily traffic on Fannin Street and nearby arterial Kirby Drive is expected to double by 2035. New development during the first half of the decade is expected to require an additional 50,000 parking spaces to meet demand. Solutions to the district&#x27;s traffic problems include expanding existing arterial roads, boosting transit capacity, and constructing new contract parking lots on the outskirts.

The Third Ward Redevelopment Council defines the TMC as being part of the Third Ward. T. R. Witcher of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; wrote in 1995 that the TMC and nearby areas are &quot;not the first places that come to mind when you say &quot;Third Ward,&quot;[...]&quot;.

=== Government services ===

The Texas Medical Center Corporation is headquartered at the John P. McGovern Campus on Holcombe Boulevard southeast of Hermann Park, adjacent to the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The United States Postal Service operates the Medical Center Station on Almeda Road, and Harris County Public Library operates the Texas Medical Center Library near the Baylor School of Medicine.

The Houston Fire Department Station 33 Medical Center, a part of Fire District 21, is near the Texas Medical Center at 7100 Fannin at South Braeswood Boulevard. The original Firehouse 33 was one of the last stations to be housed in an original volunteer fire station. The original Station 33 was the city hall/fire station of Braeswood. The City of Houston annexed the area in 1950. The current Fire Station 33 opened one block from the original station in August 2004. The city relinquished its ownership of the original fire station.

The Texas Medical Center is within the Houston Police Department&#x27;s South Central Patrol Division.

===Residential developments===
Formerly TMC had its own employee housing, Laurence H. Favrot Tower Apartments, which accommodated TMC employees and their dependents. On August 31, 2012 the complex closed. Dependent children living there were within the Houston Independent School District (HISD) and zoned to Roberts Elementary School in Southgate, Ryan Middle School in the Third Ward, and Lamar High School in Upper Kirby.

==Orchestra==

Formerly known as the Doctors Orchestra of Houston, the Texas Medical Center Orchestra was established in November 2000 and is one of the few orchestras in the world that originated from health professions. Members of the orchestra include physicians, dentists, nurses, medical students, biomedical scientists, social workers and other health professionals.

The mission of the orchestra is to provide health care professionals with a high-quality outlet for creative expression through the world of symphonic music; perform regularly at affordable concerts that are open to the public and in an accessible venue; attract a diverse audience by commitments to select popular programming reflecting Houston’s diversity; and bring public attention to, and provide programmatic support for, medically related and/or educational charities.

Organizations which have received contributions include: The University of Texas Medical School for heart research; The Ben Taub BOOKS programs; The H.O.M.E.S Clinic; Making a Mark Art Program at Texas Children’s Hospital; HISD&#x27;s DeBakey High School for Health Professions; Eye Care for Kids Foundation; The Greater Houston Chapter of the American Red Cross; The National Space Biomedical Research Institute; San Jose Clinic; Haddassah; and The Dr. Marnie Rose Foundation.

In an effort to increase appreciation for classical music in young audiences, Texas Medical Center Orchestra has developed a close relationship with the charter school, KIPP SHARP of KIPP Houston. By coordinating efforts with KIPP SHARP teachers and administrators, TMCO has integrated its musical programming into the school&#x27;s curriculum. Works that the orchestra performs are taught and discussed in history, art and music classes. The students are invited to display artwork and essays in the Wortham lobby at TMCO concerts, and they are encouraged to attend with their families. TMCO has included KIPP choirs and orchestras in concert performances.

In 2011, TMCO began working with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Lone Star Chapter in an annual co-sponsorship of a bicycle ride, &quot;Gran Fondo: Texas TMCO&quot; that precedes the MS150 and benefits both organizations.

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, the Texas Medical Center Orchestra was invited to perform Diane Warren&#x27;s Oscar-nominated song, &quot;I&#x27;m Standing With You&quot; in a monumental music video that featured more than 170 artists from six continents. Warren teamed up with director Gev Miron and composer/arranger Sharon Farber to put this effort together, which has raised over $7 million for the United Nations Foundation’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for the World Health Organization (WHO).

==Demographics==
The City of Houston defines an area around the Texas Medical Center as the Medical Center Super Neighborhood. In 2015 that area had 2,717 residents. 52% were non-Hispanic white, 16% each were non-Hispanic Black and Asian, 12% were Hispanics, and 4% were non-Hispanic other. In 2000, the area had 2,358 residents. 47% were non-Hispanic white, 33% were non-Hispanic Asian, 10% were Hispanic, 8% were non-Hispanic Black, and 2% were non-Hispanic other.

==Education==
The main TMC area is within the Houston Independent School District (HISD).

Melinda Webb School, a private school for deaf infants to 7 years old, is located in the TMC; it is operated by the Center for Hearing and Speech and was previously at 3636 W. Dallas. The school serves as a day school for children not yet mainstreamed into regular classrooms and a speech and therapy center for those that are. Previously known as the Houston School for Deaf Children, it was given its current name, after a deaf girl, in 1997. The girl died of leukemia circa 1958; a former student of the school, she had been the first area deaf child to be mainstreamed into a public school, as she began attending one in Texas City in 1954. Her father, Frank Webb, donated $1 million to what became the Melinda Webb School in 2002. That year its enrollment was 35-40. In 2020 it began admitting preschool students without hearing difficulties to provide a more mainstream environment.

Medical Center Charter School opened in 1996, catered to employees working in the Medical Center, and had the Montessori method, used until grade two. Its specialty as of 2003 was foreign languages. It was not located near the TMC area but in the Westbury area. In 2014, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) announced that the school&#x27;s performance was insufficient and that it sought to revoke its charter. By 2018, its charter had closed.

==Religion==

Christian churches near the TMC include City Life Church, Palmer Memorial Episcopal Church, St. Mathew&#x27;s Lutheran church, St. Paul&#x27;s United Methodist Church, and St. Vincent de Paul Roman Catholic Church (of the Galveston-Houston Archdiocese). Nine churches established the Church Apartment Ministry, which maintains three apartment complexes for families visiting hospitalized patients.

There is a Jewish house of worship, Medical Center Chabad House, which maintains the Aishel House program.

The Islamic Society of Greater Houston (ISGH) maintains the Al-Ma&#x27;adah Musalla (Medical Center Musalla), a prayer area.

==Parks and recreation==
The Weekley Family YMCA is in the area. It opened in 1951 as the Southwest YMCA, in West University Place. The current facility in Braeswood Place, Houston broke ground in 2001.

In 2023, Helix Park opened as part of the Texas Medical Center complex with six parks shaped around a double-helix and a campus collaboration building. The park is a center for connections, events, and outdoor respite in the heart of the life science center.

<text>The Houston Independent School District (HISD) is the largest public school system in Texas, and the eighth-largest in the United States. Houston ISD serves as a community school district for most of the city of Houston and several nearby and insular municipalities in addition to some unincorporated areas. Like most districts in Texas, it is independent of the city of Houston and all other municipal and county jurisdictions. The district has its headquarters in the Hattie Mae White Educational Support Center in Houston.

In 2016, the school district was rated &quot;met standards&quot; by the Texas Education Agency.

==History==
===20th century===

The Brunner Independent School District merged into Houston schools in 1913-1914.

Houston ISD was established in 1923 after the Texas Legislature voted to separate the city&#x27;s schools from the municipal government.

In the 1920s, at the time Edison Oberholtzer was superintendent, Hubert L. Mills, the business manager of the district, had immense political power in HISD. He had been in the employment of the district over one decade before Oberholtzer started. By the 1930s the two men were in a power struggle.

The number of students in public schools in Houston increased from 5,500 in 1888 to over 8,850 in 1927.

In the 1920s, the school district expanded its infrastructure to accommodate a growing number of black students. There were 8,293 students in Houston&#x27;s schools for black students in the 1924-1925 school year. In 1927, Houston ISD annexed the Harrisburg School District&#x27;s colored school. The district also built new schools such as the former Jack Yates High School (later Ryan Middle School) and Wheatley High School. The capacity of Houston&#x27;s secondary schools for black children increased by three times from 1924 to 1929. The original secondary school for blacks was named Colored High School (now Booker T. Washington High School). At the time, the district&#x27;s three secondary schools for black students had junior high and senior high levels. There were 12,217 students in the black schools in the 1929-1930 school year. William Henry Kellar, author of &quot;Make Haste Slowly: Moderates, Conservatives, and School Desegregation in Houston&quot;, wrote that conditions in black schools &quot;improved dramatically&quot; in the 1920s.

Houston ISD absorbed portions of the White Oak Independent School District in 1937 and portions of the Addicks Independent School District after its dissolution.

In the fall of 1960 12 black students were admitted to HISD schools previously reserved for whites. The racial integration efforts in HISD, beginning in 1960, were characterized by a lack of violence and turmoil as business leaders sought not to cause disruption. Prior to 1960 HISD was the largest racially segregated school system in the United States.

In the mid-1960s Gertrude Barnstone and Black board member Hattie Mae White, the sole politically liberal members of the school board, often clashed with more conservative board members in meetings held on Monday nights; the two women made efforts to racially integrate the schools. During the 1960s, HISD&#x27;s school board instituted a phase-in with each subsequent grade being integrated. Local African-American leaders believed the pace was too slow, and William Lawson, a youth minister, asked Wheatley students to boycott school. Five days afterwards 10% of Wheatley students attended classes. In 1970 a federal judge asked the district to speed the integration process.

Simultaneously Mexican Americans were being discriminated against when they were being labeled as whites and being put with only African Americans as part of HISD&#x27;s desegregation / integration plan. This kept both Mexican Americans and African Americans away from Anglos while satisfying integration requirements set forth by the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education court case decision. Many Mexican Americans took their children out of the public schools and put them in &quot;huelga,&quot; or protest schools. On August 31, 1970, and organized by the Mexican-American Education Council (MAEC), they began three weeks of boycotts, protests, and picketing. This action lasted approximately three weeks, during which up to 75% of the student bodies of some high schools participated in the boycotts. During the protests MAEC demanded twenty issues to be resolved and HISD began rezoning school areas within its jurisdiction in response. However, this rezoning encouraged &quot;white flight&quot; since minorities were now entering &quot;white schools&quot; in large numbers. At first the district used forced busing, but later switched to a voluntary magnet school program in order to discourage &quot;white flight&quot;.

The district eventually integrated races in a semi-peaceful manner. River Oaks Elementary School became the first school to implement the HISD&#x27;s Vanguard Program in the fall of 1972, with a program for 4th-6th graders. This program was initially named the Elementary School For The Gifted. The Vanguard Program name was adopted a year later. A desegregation busing plan, protested by Anglo White westside neighborhoods not wanting their children bused to predominately black schools, was rejected by the court system but white flight began by the 1970s.

Circa 1972, a group of citizens in western Houston tried to form Westheimer Independent School District out of a portion of Houston ISD. It would have removed from the HISD territory. At the time 90% of the students in the area were white. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected the appeals after formation of the district was denied.

HISD once served the Harris County portion of Stafford, until the Stafford Municipal School District was established in 1982 to serve the entire city of Stafford. Most of Stafford was in Fort Bend ISD, with a small amount in Houston ISD.

In 1987 Olivia Munoz, the district&#x27;s foreign language director, said that an increase in interest in foreign languages prompted the district to add foreign language languages to four high schools.

In 1992, the district, under superintendent Frank Petruzielo, massively rezoned Houston schools, moving students from overcrowded ones to underutilized ones. Donald R. McAdams, a former HISD school board member and author of &quot;Fighting to Save Our Urban Schools-- and Winning!: Lessons from Houston&quot;, wrote that Petruzielo accomplished this goal with a minimum of press coverage and controversy by using a participative process that minimized conflict between various Houston neighborhoods. McAdams credits the move with being the catalyst for the 1995 establishment of 11 geographic districts patterned around high school feeder patterns.

In 1994, after superintendent Petruzielo left the district, the school district voted 6-1 to make Yvonne Gonzalez the interim superintendent; the school district board members described this as a &quot;symbolic&quot; motion as Gonzalez was the first Hispanic interim superintendent. Gonzalez served until Rod Paige became the superintendent.

In 1995 HISD had a performance audit; this was the last such audit done.

In the 1990s, after voters rejected a $390 million bond package, Paige contracted with The Varnett School, River Oaks Academy, and Wonderland School to house 250 students who could not be placed in HISD schools. The schools were paid $3,565 per student. This was 10% lower than the district&#x27;s own per pupil cost.

===21st century===
====2000s====
A 2003 &quot;The New York Times&quot; report which asserted that HISD did not report school violence to the police created controversy in the community as teachers, students, and parents expressed concern about the district&#x27;s downplaying of campus violence. HISD officials held a news conference after the publication of the story. During the conference, HISD asserted that &quot;The New York Times&quot; published the story in an attempt to discredit the Bush administration&#x27;s new accountability standards for school districts nationwide, which were partly modeled after HISD&#x27;s system.

In 2005, HISD enrolled evacuees from the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina who were residing in Houston. The Houston Astrodome, the shelter used for hurricane evacuees, is located within the HISD boundaries. Many Katrina evacuees stayed for the long term within the Houston ISD boundaries. Walnut Bend Elementary School&#x27;s enrollment increased from around 600 to around 800 with the addition of 184 evacuees; Walnut Bend, out of all of the Houston-area elementary schools, took the most Katrina victims. Nearby Paul Revere Middle School, located in the Westchase district, gained 137 Katrina victims. Revere, out of all of the Houston-area middle schools, has taken in the most Katrina victims. Houston ISD&#x27;s &quot;West Region,&quot; which includes Walnut Bend and Revere, had about one-fifth of Houston ISD&#x27;s schools but contained more than half of the 5,500 Katrina evacuees in Houston schools. At the start of the 2006-2007 school year, around 2,900 Hurricane Katrina evacuees were still enrolled in Houston ISD schools. Around 700 of them were held back due to poor academic performance. 41% of evacuee 10th graders and 52% of evacuee juniors were held back. According to the October 2006 &quot;For Your Information&quot; newsletter, the eleven HISD schools which took the largest number of Katrina evacuees were:
* Elementary schools: Bonham, Foerster, McNamara, Walnut Bend
* Middle schools: Fondren, Revere, Sharpstown Middle
* High schools: Lee, Sharpstown High, Westbury, Westside

A University of Houston study concluded that the presence of Katrina evacuees did not impact the test score grades of native Houstonian students.

In 2007 the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Communications Commission, and the United States Department of Justice began an investigation probing business relationships between Micro Systems Enterprises, a vendor, and HISD. Frankie Wong, former president of Micro Systems, and two Dallas Independent School District administrators received criminal charges.

As of 2007 several existing HISD schools were converting to K-8 school setups while other new K-8 schools were opening. Prior to the bond election in November 2007, the district abandoned a proposal to convert several schools into K-8 campuses due to African American neighborhoods communities resisting proposed school consolidations.

====2010s====
In 2011 the Texas Education Agency ordered the North Forest Independent School District (NFISD) to close, pending approval from the U.S. Justice Department. NFISD would be merged into HISD.

On June 13, 2013, the HISD board voted unanimously to absorb the North Forest Independent School District (NFISD).

HISD won the Broad Prize in 2013.

On January 14, 2016, the HISD board voted 5-4 to rename four campuses named after Robert E. Lee or others linked to the Confederacy.

In October 2018 the HISD board chose to appoint Saavedra as the interim HISD superintendent, but the board later reversed its decision. The board members who did not favor bringing in Saavedra were not aware of this until a board member who did support this announced the decision at an official board meeting. The reversal meant that Grenita Latham remained as the interim superintendent.

By 2019 the Texas Education Agency (TEA) had opened an investigation against the school board and ordered a halt to any efforts to recruit a permanent superintendent. By August 2019 the TEA wrote a preliminary report recommending that the HISD school board be dissolved, with a state-appointed board of managers and conservator replacing it, and to reduce the accreditation of HISD. The report alleges wrongdoing of various board members, including violations of the Texas Open Meetings Act. The TEA initially had suggested a board takeover due to poor performance at some schools, but the alleged violation of the open meetings act when several board members attempted to re-hire Saavedra, without the knowledge of the remaining board members, became the reason to seek dismissal of the board. In 2019 HISD received a grade of 88 - &quot;B&quot; - from the TEA, while in 2018 it had a grade of 84. In 2019 271 HISD schools were counted in TEA accountability ratings. 250 schools passed, while 21 (7.5% of schools) did not.

====2020s====
In 2020 the HISD board voted 6-3 against naming Lathan as permanent superintendent.

Millard House became the new superintendent on July 1, 2021. All board members voted to approve him and he was the only finalist for the position. He was from the Clarksville-Montgomery County School System.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas House agreed to institute a mask mandate effective fall 2021 despite Governor of Texas Greg Abbott banning school districts from having mask mandates. Additionally the HISD board of education voted to approve the mask mandate. The vote was eight in favor and none voting against.

In 2023 the Texas Education Agency announced that it will remove the superintendent and the board of trustees, and therefore begin to directly control HISD. The Houston Independent School District takeover formally began on June 1, 2023 with the appointment of a new superintendent and board of managers. Millard House II was replaced as HISD superintendent by Mike Miles (school superintendent) as part of the planned takeover.

==Bilingual education, magnet, and vanguard schools==


HISD focuses on bilingual education of its predominantly Hispanic student body, including recruiting about 330 teachers from Mexico, Spain, Central and South America, Puerto Rico, China, and the Philippines from 1998 to 2007. Bilingual educational services, as of 2014, are available for Spanish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Mandarin Chinese, Nepali, Urdu, and Swahili speakers. According to Texas Administrative Code BB § 89.1205 a language is eligible to have a bilingual program if 20 or more students are present in a school district who speak that language as their home language.

Houston ISD offers three specialized programs, magnet programs, vanguard programs, and neighborhood vanguard programs. Each magnet program has a special focus and draws students throughout HISD. Each vanguard program is a gifted and talented program for students throughout HISD. A neighborhood vanguard program is a program designed for gifted and talented children zoned to a particular school. As of 2011, its 113 programs served almost 20% of the HISD student population.
HISD, which officially first opened its magnet system in 1975, started them as a way to voluntarily racially integrate schools. The High School for Performing and Visual Arts (HSPVA) was technically the first magnet school in Houston; this status was mistakenly attributed to River Oaks Elementary School. In 1984 the district had 75 magnet programs. By the mid-1990s many magnet schools no longer held the goal of integration and instead focused on improving educational quality of schools. As of 2011 magnet schools continued to be popular among HISD constituents.

HISD&#x27;s magnet (Performing Arts, Science, Health Professions, Law Enforcement, etc.) high schools are considered a model for other urban school districts as a way to provide a high quality education and keep top performing students in the inner city from fleeing to private schools or exurban school districts. Magnet schools are popular with parents and students that wish to escape low-performing schools and school violence. The members of the administration of schools losing students to higher-performing campuses, such as Bill Miller of Yates High School, complained about the effects.

There are 55 elementary magnet schools, 30 magnet middle schools, and 27 magnet high schools. Some magnet schools are mixed comprehensive and magnet programs, while others are solidly magnet and do not admit any &quot;neighborhood&quot; students.

In April 1997 a lawsuit against HISD seeking to end race-based admissions to magnet schools was filed on behalf of two white applicants to Lanier Middle School who were denied admission because the quota for White students was filled. The lawsuit was funded by the group &quot;Campaign for a Color-Blind America&quot;. That year, as a result of this lawsuit, HISD removed the ethnic guidelines to Vanguard enrollment.

==Student body==
For the 2017-2018 school year the district reported a total enrollment of 214,175

* 61.84% were Hispanic American/Hispanic
* 24.02% were African American/Black
* 8.7% were White American/White
* 4.05% were Asian American/Asian
* 74.93% were economically disadvantaged

As of 2015, 7% of black students, 13% of Hispanic students, 36% of white students, and 43% of Asian students in HISD were labeled as gifted and talented. Students from wealthy families were twice as likely to be labeled as gifted and talented compared to students from economic disadvantaged backgrounds. HISD has been implementing multiple strategies to ensure there is more equity in its gifted and talented program.

As of the 2014-2015 school year, over 59,700 HISD students reported the language spoken at home by their families as Spanish. Over 925 reported their home language as Arabic and over 445 reported their home language as Vietnamese. As of 2015 other common languages were Mandarin Chinese, Nepali, and Urdu. As of 2014 the most common native languages for limited English and/or English learner students were Spanish (58,365 students, or 92% of ELL students), Arabic (855 or 1.3%), Vietnamese (437 or 0.7%), Mandarin Chinese (319 or 0.5%), Nepali (295, 0.5%), Swahili (250 or 0.4%), French (139 or 0.2%), Urdu (143 or 0.2%), Amharic (107 or 0.2%), and Tigrinya (104 or 0.2%).

As of 2013 the numbers of ELL learners by home language were: 56,104 for Spanish, 662 for Arabic, 538 for English, 528 for Vietnamese, 277 for Nepali, 271 for Mandarin, 212 for Swahili, 159 for Urdu, and 1,750 for other languages.

In the 2015-2016 school year, 58% of HISD students went to the schools of their attendance boundaries, about 27% attended other HISD schools, and 15% attended schools in other school districts and/or charter schools. Of high school students, 54.7% attended the schools they were zoned to, 33% attended HISD schools that they were not zoned to, and 11.5% attended charter schools or public schools in other districts. In the 2015-2016 school year there were 4,894 students transferring to four comprehensive high schools located in communities in which 33% or more of the students were Anglo White (Bellaire, Heights, Lamar, and Westside high schools) and 4,073 students transferred to other comprehensive high schools.

The student population declined by about 4,000 in 2018, and the expected decline for fall 2019 was 1,500. HISD officials cited enrollment in charter schools as a factor. The district chose to engage in advertising as a way to combat this.

===Student body history===
Until 1970 HISD counted its Hispanic and Latino students as &quot;white.&quot;

Between the 1970-1971 and the 1971-1972 school years, during a period of white flight from major urban school districts across the United States, enrollment at HISD decreased by 16,000. Of that number, 700 were African Americans. The HISD student body had white students as the largest group until the 1972-1973 school year, when the largest group became the black students. The white student body decreased, while the Hispanic student body increased and became HISD&#x27;s largest student demographic in the 1989-1990 school year. In 1975 the student body was 39% White and 19% Hispanic. In 1981 the district had 190,000 students; 31% of the district&#x27;s students were Hispanic, and 21% were White. In 1990 the student body was 43% Hispanic, 40% Black, and 15% White. At the time 45% of HISD schools had no white students. By the 1990s HISD&#x27;s student body was increasingly made up of racial and ethnic minority groups. In 1999 4,400 students in the HISD boundaries were attending state-chartered schools.

Of the 9th graders that were in the graduating classes of 2004-2005 in the district, 15% successfully obtained bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees. The U.S. average was 23%. In the District of Columbia Public Schools, 9% of its equivalent 9th grade class received a bachelor of arts or a bachelor of science and/or higher.

The preliminary fall enrollment for the 2006-2007 school year (203,163) had 7,000 fewer students than the 2005-2006 student enrollment (210,202), resulting in a more than 3% loss; the 2006-2007 enrollment was a 2.5% decrease from the fall 2004-2005 enrollment (208,454). From the preliminary 2006-2007 student count, the West and Central regions lost the most students, with a combined 4,400 student loss. The enrollment reported for the year in February 2007 was 202,936.

As of 2007, of the more than 29 HISD high schools, five had White students as the largest group of students; one of them, High School for Performing and Visual Arts, was the district&#x27;s only White majority high school.

In 2010 Peter Messiah, the head of HISD&#x27;s Homeless Education Office, said that HISD classified around 3,000 students as homeless. Margaret Downing of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; said that Messiah predicted &quot;with confidence&quot; that the actual number of homeless is higher because some families are too embarrassed to self-identify as homeless. Messiah also said that in the years leading to 2010, the number of students classified as homeless increased because the school district became better able to identify homeless students and because the Late-2000s recession continued to have an effect on their families.

As of 2011, between 50% and 66% of the non-Hispanic White students within the HISD boundaries enroll in private schools. In 2009, 72% of the non-Hispanic White students attending the district&#x27;s schools were in magnet programs. In 2010 HISD had 15,340 non-Hispanic White students, the lowest numerical number of non-Hispanic Whites in recent history. This made up 7.6% of its student body. White enrollment increased to 17,313 by 2014, an increase by 13%. As of 2014, 8.2% of students were non-Hispanic White. Asian enrollment had increased since 2010. As of 2014 7,401 students were Asians, making up 3.5% of students.

In 2013 due to the absorption of the North Forest Independent School District, HISD&#x27;s enrollment increased to 210,000.

==Staff and faculty demographics==

As of 2007, Teach for America corps members made up about 25% of the number of HISD teachers. The district board voted to end its contract with TFA in 2019.

==Governance==

As of June 2023, Mike Miles is the superintendent of schools. He was appointed by the Texas Education Agency Commissioner Mike Morath.

As of November 2023, the elected members of the HISD Board of Education are:
* District I: Elizabeth Santos
* District II: Savant Moore
* District III: Dani Hernandez
* District IV: Patricia Alen
* District V: Sue Deigaard
* District VI: Kendall Baker
* District VII: Bridget Wade
* District VIII: Plácido Gómez
* District IX: Myrna Guidry
Due to the June 2023 state takeover, elected board members serve in strictly advisory roles. Governance authority has been shifted to the state-appointed board of managers that primarily resides on the wealthier west side of the school district.

As of October 2024, the appointed board of managers are:

* Audrey Momanaee, President
* Ric Campo, Vice President
* Angela Lemond Flowers, Secretary
* Cassandra Auzenne Bandy
* Michelle Cruz Arnold
* Janette Garza Lindner
* Rolando Martinez
* Paula Mendoza
* Adam Rivon

===Superintendents===

Former HISD superintendent Rod Paige used the PEER Program. Improving scores from its schools have caused a lot of praise from others nationwide. Kaye Stripling took over when Rod Paige headed to Washington, D.C. as part of United States President George W. Bush&#x27;s administration cabinet. After Stripling stepped down as the interim Superintendent, Abelardo Saavedra became the superintendent of the district on December 9, 2004. Terry Grier became the district&#x27;s superintendent 2009, followed by Richard A. Carranza in 2016 before standing down in order to become Chancellor of the New York City Schools. Dr. Grenita Lathan was appointed interim superintendent in March 2018 and left the school district to lead Springfield Public Schools (Illinois) in July 2021.

Billy Reagan served as superintendent until 1986. Joan Raymond began serving that year, and stepped down in 1991.

===Political divisions===
On December 1, 1994, HISD board members voted to divide HISD into 12 numbered geographic districts; of eleven districts, each district had one to three high schools. The 12th district was an alternative district.

Prior to Summer 2005, HISD had 13 administrative districts. Originally, the number of districts were to be cut to three, but HISD decided on cutting the number to five in fall 2005.

As of 2010 HISD schools are organized by elementary, middle, and high school offices.

Previously schools in Houston ISD were organized into &quot;Regional Districts.&quot; Each district had its own Regional Superintendent.

There were five regional districts in Houston ISD:
* Central Regional District
* East Regional District
* North Regional District
* South Regional District
* West Regional District

Before its 2005 reorganization, HISD had the following districts:

Geographic districts:
* Central District
* East District
* North District
* North Central District
* Northeast District
* Northwest District
* South District
* South Central District
* Southeast District
* Southwest District
* West District
Other districts:
* Alternative District
* Acres Homes Coalition Schools

An additional district, West Central, was later established before the reorganization.

===Taxation===
As of 2010, of the school districts in Harris County, Houston ISD has the lowest taxation rate.

===Support services===
In 1948, Federal funding for school lunch programs became available. The district refused to participate and was unable to raise funds elsewhere. As a result, there were no free or reduced-price lunches for local schoolchildren until 1967.

In the 2000s HISD established &quot;Breakfast in the Classroom.&quot; The program was replaced with a free breakfast program based in cafeterias. The &quot;Houston Press&quot; published a story about accounting irregularities regarding a program; the State of Texas announced it would investigate the program. On February 4, 2005, HISD Superintendent Abelardo Saavedra announced that the program was suspended. By 2006 HISD resumed its free breakfast programs.

==Houston ISD television channel==
HISD TV is an educational cable access channel.

Houses in the Houston ISD area get the Houston ISD channel on cable.
*Channel 18 of Comcast
*Channel 99 of AT&amp;T U-verse
*Channel 76 of Phonoscope Communications
*Channel 96 of Suddenlink
*Channel 18 of TV Max

== HISD coverage area ==
The district covers territory in nine municipalities and some unincorporated areas in Greater Houston, including: all of the cities of Bellaire, West University Place. Southside Place, and most of the area within the Houston city limits. HISD also takes students from the Harris County portion of Missouri City, a portion of Jacinto City, a small portion of Hunters Creek Village, a small portion of Piney Point Village, and a small portion of Pearland; Pearland annexed territory within HISD between 1998 and 2005.

All of the HISD area lies within the taxation area for the Houston Community College System.

===Cities===

Houston ISD covers all of the following municipalities:
* Bellaire
* Southside Place
* West University Place

Houston ISD covers portions of the following municipalities:
* Houston (the majority of Houston, including all of the area inside the 610 Loop, falls under HISD)
* Hunters Creek Village (areas south of Buffalo Bayou are HISD)
* Jacinto City (areas north of Market street are in Houston ISD)
* Missouri City (Harris County portion only)
* Pearland (A section of the Harris County portion)
* Piney Point Village (areas south of Buffalo Bayou are in HISD)

HISD also covers unincorporated sections of Harris County, including portions of the Airline Improvement District.

Prior to 1982, the district included the small Harris County section of Stafford. Stafford residents voted to form a municipal school district in 1977.

==Transportation==

Houston ISD grants school bus transportation to any Houston ISD resident attending his or her zoned school or attending a magnet program who lives or more away from the campus (as measured by the nearest public roads) or must cross treacherous obstacles in order to reach the campus. Certain special education students are also permitted to use school bus transportation.
 HISD does not provide transportation for pre-kindergarten students.

==Schools==
In HISD grades kindergarten and grades 1 through 5 are considered to be elementary school, grades 6 through 8 are considered to be middle school, and grades 9 through 12 are considered to be high school. Some elementary schools go up to the sixth grade. Some districts have grades elementary grades K-3 and 4-6 and then junior high school grades 7-8 and then high school grades 9-12.

Every house in HISD is assigned to an elementary school, a middle school, and a high school. HISD has many alternative programs and transfer options available to students who want a specialized education and/or dislike their home schools.

===Characteristics of schools and White enrollment===
Donald McAdams wrote that in the 1990s, within trustee District 5 there were schools that were about 50% White that usually had ample parent support and stronger test scores while there were schools about 90% or higher minorities that had low test scores and little to no parent support. He explained that in Houston white parents sent children to HISD schools that had minority children as long as the minority children tended to be middle class and that there was not too many of them. Many black students who lived in District 5 were middle class children who took school buses to the schools and did not live in the school zones. According to McAdams their enrollment levels were stable and White parents were comfortable with their presence. He added that very poor black children tended to go to their neighborhood schools outside of District 5. McAdams also stated that White middle-class parents did not consider Asians and Asian Americans to be minorities who could make a school less attractive to them. In the 1980s and 1990s increased enrollment of poor, non-English speaking Central American students at some HISD neighborhood schools made them unattractive to White parents.

According to McAdams, the White middle class community accepted minority percentages of around 50% for elementary schools, and for middle and high schools the White community accepted minority percentages of over 70 because classes at those levels were separated by academic ability. If percentages of minorities exceeded the tolerable levels at a particular school, white parents withdrew their children from the said school until there were few White people left. According to McAdams, HISD administrators knew about the levels of minority percentages tolerable to White middle-class parents.

McAdams argued that class was a far more important consideration than race to White parents. He stated that despite how &quot;negative&quot; his comments about White HISD residents sounded, many of the White parents were &quot;not necessarily racists&quot; but instead wanted high quality academic instruction in their schools, as methods and instructions for poor children were not suited for middle class children. McAdams argued that the attitude of the White community being willing to send their children to schools with about 50% minority enrollment was more progressive than the previous White attitude around the 1960s which was hostile to any minority enrollment in White schools.

==Dress codes==

As of 2013, more than 230 schools required their students to wear school uniforms or &quot;standardized dress.&quot;

As of 2006, over twenty high schools require their students to wear school uniforms or &quot;standardized dress.&quot; Of them, one, Lamar High School, had a White plurality. Nine Houston ISD high schools did not require students to wear uniforms or standardized dress. Four of them had White students as the largest group of students.

In 1991 Key Middle School was the first school in HISD to introduce school uniforms. At the time, they were not required, but encouraged. Around the early 1990s the district began a trend of more localized management, so local schools set their own dress code policies. At the start of the 1994-1995 school year 37 HISD elementary and middle schools had uniforms or standardized dress; this was a large increase from the previous school year.

==Administration building==

The current administration building, the Hattie Mae White Educational Support Center, is in northwest Houston. The administration moved into the offices in spring 2006. It is named after Hattie Mae White, the first African American HISD board member and the first African-American public official in the State of Texas elected since Reconstruction.

The current Sam Houston High School building in the Northside opened in 1955. The previous Sam Houston High School building in Downtown Houston became the administrative headquarters of HISD. By the early 1970s HISD moved its headquarters out of the building, which was demolished. As of 2011 an HISD-owned parking lot occupies the former school lot; a state historical marker is at the lot. In meetings it had been proposed as a new location for the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts.

Houston ISD&#x27;s administration building, which opened in 1969 and served in that capacity from July of that year to March 2006 was the Hattie Mae White Administration Building, at 3830 Richmond Avenue. It was designed by Neuhaus &amp; Taylor in a New Brutalist style. The facility was labeled the &quot;Taj Mahal&quot; due to the counter-clockwise circular layout and the split-level floor pattern. The design made it difficult for wheelchair-using individuals to navigate the building. The complex cost U.S.$6 million. The building had tropical indoor atriums, causing critics to criticize the spending priorities of the district. When the district considered cutting a popular kindergarten program for financial reasons, taxpayers voted many board members out of office. The district sold the former complex for $38 million to a company that demolished the site and developed a mixed-use commercial property; demolition began on September 14, 2006. Demolition crews destroyed the Will Rogers Elementary School, an adjacent school at 3101 Weslayan that closed in spring 2006. The former HISD administration building appears in the film &quot;The Thief Who Came to Dinner&quot;. The land of the former administration building now includes a Costco among other businesses.

==Athletic facilities==

Early HISD athletic facilities included West End Park (purchased in 1928) and Robertson Stadium (opened in 1942).

HISD has three athletic facility centers that were under its control as of June 30, 2013: Herman A. Barnett Sports Complex, Joe K. Butler Sports Complex, and the two-stadium Delmar - Dyer Sports Complex. Barnett has the capacity of 8,000 for American football and track games, 2,750 for basketball games, and 2,500 for soccer (football) games. Butler can seat 8,000 for American football and track games and 2,500 for basketball games. Butler also has middle school and high school baseball fields, which have a seating capacity of 4,500. The Delmar Stadium, an American football stadium, has a seating capacity of 12,500. The Delmar Fieldhouse has a capacity of 5,400. The Delmar baseball field has a capacity of 1,500. The Delmar middle school stadium has 3,000. The Dyer Stadium has a seating capacity of 6,000 for American football and track games.

In addition, the 12,000-capacity Jones-Cowart Stadium, which is used for American football, is located on the property of the former Smiley High School, now North Forest High School. When it was a part of the North Forest Independent School District (NFISD), it served as the district&#x27;s stadium for sporting events. As of July 1, 2013, the NFISD territory was merged into HISD.

On September 12, 2013, HISD announced that it plans to demolish the existing 5,400-seat Delmar-Tusa Fieldhouse and build a new one at the same site. In the 1960s the old fieldhouse served as the home court for the University of Houston basketball team. HISD moved several scheduled events to the Mark Anthony Wilkins Pavilion at Forest Brook Middle School. The new facility is scheduled to open in 2016.

<text>The , also sometimes read as &#x27; or &#x27;, is an early Japanese chronicle of myths, legends, hymns, genealogies, oral traditions, and semi-historical accounts down to 641 concerning the origin of the Japanese archipelago, the , and the Japanese imperial line. It is claimed in its preface to have been composed by Ō no Yasumaro at the request of Empress Genmei in the early 8th century (711–712), and thus is usually considered to be the oldest extant literary work in Japan.

The myths contained in the as well as the are part of the inspiration behind many practices and unified &quot;Shinto orthodoxy&quot;. Later, they were incorporated into Shinto practices such as the purification ritual.

== Composition ==

It is believed that the compilation of various genealogical and anecdotal histories of the imperial (Yamato) court and prominent clans began during the reigns of Emperors Keitai and Kinmei in the 6th century, with the first concerted effort at historical compilation of which we have record being the one made in 620 under the auspices of Prince Shotoku and Soga no Umako. According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, the documents compiled under their initiative were the &quot;Tennōki&quot; (, also &quot;Sumera-mikoto no fumi&quot;) or the &quot;Record of the Emperors&quot;, the &quot;Kokki&quot; (, also &quot;Kunitsufumi&quot;) or the &quot;National Record&quot;, and other &quot;fundamental records&quot; (, &quot;hongi&quot; or &quot;mototsufumi&quot;) pertaining to influential clans and free subjects. Out of these texts, only the &quot;Kokki&quot; survived the burning of Soga no Emishi&#x27;s estate (where these documents were kept) during the Isshi incident of 645, and was itself apparently lost soon after.

The &quot;Kojiki&quot; preface indicates that leading families also kept their own historical and genealogical records; indeed, one of the reasons it gives for the compilation of the &quot;Kojiki&quot; is the correction of errors that had supposedly crept into these documents. According to the preface, Emperor Tenmu (reigned 673–686) ordered the review and emendation of clan documents and commissioned a certain court attendant (&quot;toneri&quot;) of exceptional memory named Hieda no Are to memorize records and oral traditions concerning the imperial lineage. Beyond this memorization, nothing occurred until the reign of Empress Genmei (reigned 707–715), who on the 18th of the 9th month of 711 (Wadō 4) ordered the courtier Ō no Yasumaro to record what had been learned by Hieda no Are. He finished and presented his work to Empress Genmei on the 28th of the 1st month of 712 (Wadō 5).

=== Purpose ===

The &quot;Kojiki&quot; is a collation of different traditions woven into a single &quot;official&quot; mythology, made in an attempt to justify the rule of the imperial Yamato polity and at the same time to subsume different interest groups under its wing by giving them a place and an interest in the national genealogy-mythology. Apart from furthering the imperial agenda, an increased interest in the nation&#x27;s origins in reaction to the influx of foreign culture and the need for an authoritative genealogical account by which to consider the claims of noble families and to reorganize them into a new system of ranks and titles are also possible factors for its compilation.

The &quot;Kojiki&quot; narrative establishes the Yamato line&#x27;s right to rule via myth and legend, portraying it as the progeny of heavenly deities and the rightful heir to the land of Japan. A good part of the latter portion of the text is spent recounting various genealogies which served not only to give the imperial family an air of antiquity (which may not necessarily reflect historical reality), but also served to tie, whether true or not, many existing clans&#x27; genealogies to their own. Regardless of the work&#x27;s original intent, it finalized and possibly even formulated the framework by which Japanese history was examined in terms of the reign of emperors.

In contrast to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (compiled 720), the first of six histories commissioned by the imperial court, which was modeled on Chinese dynastic histories and was intended to be a national chronicle that could be shown with pride to foreign envoys, the &quot;Kojiki&quot; is inward looking, concerned mainly with the ruling family and prominent clans, and is apparently intended for internal consumption. Whereas the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; uses a variety of source documents (including Chinese texts), the &quot;Kojiki&quot; is apparently based on sources handed down within the court.

== Transmission and study ==

Whereas the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, owing to its status as one of the six imperial histories, was widely read and studied during the Heian period (794–1185), the &quot;Kojiki&quot; was mostly treated as an ancillary text. Indeed, a work known as the &quot;Sendai Kuji Hongi&quot; (also known as the &quot;Kujiki&quot;), claimed to have been authored by Prince Shōtoku and Soga no Umako, was considered to be earlier and more reliable than the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. (Modern scholarly consensus holds the &quot;Kuji Hongi&quot; to be a Heian period forgery based on both the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Shoki&quot;, although certain portions may indeed preserve genuine early traditions and sources.) By the Kamakura period (1185–1333), the work languished in obscurity such that very few people had access to the text, particularly that of the middle (second) volume. It is due to this neglect that the &quot;Kojiki&quot; is available only in comparatively late manuscripts, the earliest of which dates to the late 14th century.

It was with the advent of printing in the early modern period that the &quot;Kojiki&quot; first reached a wide audience. The earliest printed edition of the text was the &quot;Kan&#x27;ei Kojiki&quot; (), published in Kyoto in 1644 (Kan&#x27;ei 21). A second edition, the &quot;Gōtō Kojiki&quot; (, &quot;&quot;Kojiki&quot; with Marginal Notes&quot;) was printed by Deguchi (Watarai) Nobuyoshi, a priest at Ise Shrine, in 1687 (Jōkyō 4).
The birth of nativist studies (&quot;kokugaku&quot;) and nationalist sentiment during the Edo period saw a reappraisal of the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. &quot;Kokugaku&quot; scholars saw Japan&#x27;s earliest writings as the repository of a uniquely superior Japanese identity that could be revived by recovering the ancient language they were written in; the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, by virtue of its antiquity, gained the status of a sacred text. The &quot;Kojiki&quot; came to be highly regarded that scholars such as Kada no Azumamaro and Kamo no Mabuchi – himself a student of Azumamaro – produced annotated versions of it.
The &quot;Kojiki&quot; received its most serious study and exposition in the hands of Motoori Norinaga, who obtained a copy of the Kan&#x27;ei printed edition in 1754. After meeting Mabuchi in 1763, Norinaga began to devote his efforts to an in-depth scholarly study of the text. A monumental 44-volume study of the &quot;Kojiki&quot; called , composed over a 34-year period (1764–1798), was the fruit of his labor. With Norinaga, the &quot;Kojiki&quot; assumed an importance equal to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;; in fact, in his view the &quot;Kojiki&quot; was a more trustworthy source for ancient Japanese traditions than was the &quot;Shoki&quot; precisely because it was free of &quot;Chinese mentality&quot;. He viewed the &quot;Kojiki&quot; as a true account of actual events that when read correctly, could reveal Japan in its pristine, ideal state as a community where the &quot;kami&quot;, the emperor and the people lived in harmony. Norinaga&#x27;s work was carried on in different directions by his disciple Hirata Atsutane and his rivals Fujitani Mitsue (1781–1849) and Tachibana Moribe (1768–1823), who each produced commentaries and treatises on the text.

The &quot;Kojiki&quot; became once more the object of scholarly focus and discussion in the Meiji period with the introduction of Western academic disciplines such as philology and comparative mythology. The importance of the text as a work of literary value was recognized, and scholars realized that its accounts were comparable in many ways to ancient Greek and Roman myths. At the same time, however, the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; achieved a sort of scriptural status under State Shintō, which viewed the stories contained therein as orthodox national history. Official ideology upheld as unquestionable fact the belief in the emperor&#x27;s divinity and the idea of Japan as a racially superior &quot;national body&quot; (&quot;kokutai&quot;), with scholars who questioned their veracity facing the threat of censorship, forced resignation, or even trial in court.

Until the Meiji era, the text&#x27;s sacred nature was not known to have been questioned. However, the &quot;Kojiki&quot; was still widely seen as inferior to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; until Motoori Norinaga wrote the &quot;Kojiki-den&quot;. In 1913, Tsuda Sōkichi argued in a study that the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, particularly in its earlier sections, was neither history nor myth but a document created to legitimize the rule of the imperial line. While his conclusions led to considerable controversy, his influence remains in subsequent studies of the text (particularly in post-World War II scholarship), which amounts largely to development and correction of the line of thought originally proposed by him. In reaction to Tsuda, Watsuji Tetsurō (1920) argued for a literary appreciation of the Kojiki, claiming that this gave it inner coherence. Kurano Kenji (1927) took it a step further, proposing that the &quot;Kojiki&quot; may best be compared with Western epic literature and regarded as a national epic like &quot;Beowulf&quot; is in the English-speaking world. During the 1920s and 30s, linguist Hashimoto Shinkichi studied the phonology of the Old Japanese language, and his conclusions were applied by scholars to the study of the text.

The &quot;Kojiki&quot; continued to attract the attention of academics and other specialists in the post-war period, which saw the appearance of numerous editions, translations and commentaries on the text by authors such as Kurano Kenji, Takeda Yūkichi, Saigō Nobutsuna, and Kōnoshi Takamitsu.

===Manuscripts===
There are two major branches of &quot;Kojiki&quot; manuscripts: Ise and Urabe. The extant Urabe branch consists of 36 existing manuscripts all based on the 1522 copies by Urabe Kanenaga. The Ise branch may be subdivided into the manuscript of 1371–1372 and the manuscripts. The Dōka sub-branch consists of:
* the manuscript of 1381; only the first half of the first volume remains
* the manuscript of 1424; only the first volume remains, and there are many defects
* the manuscript of 1426; one volume

The Shinpukuji-bon manuscript (1371–1372) is the oldest existing manuscript. While divided into the Ise branch, it is actually a mixture of the two branches. The monk Ken&#x27;yu based his copy on Ōnakatomi Sadayo&#x27;s copy. In 1266, Sadayo copied volumes one and three but did not have access to the second volume. Finally, in 1282, he obtained access to the second volume through a Urabe-branch manuscript that he used to transcribe.

==Structure==
The &quot;Kojiki&quot; contains various songs and poems. While the historical records and myths are written in a form of the Chinese language, the songs are written in Old Japanese with the &quot;Man&#x27;yōgana&quot; writing system, which uses Chinese characters only phonetically.

===Sections===

The &quot;Kojiki&quot; is divided into three parts: the , the and the .

*The &quot;Kamitsumaki&quot;, also known as the , includes the preface of the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, and is focused on the deities of creation and the births of various deities of the &quot;kamiyo&quot; () period, or Age of the Gods. The &quot;Kamitsumaki&quot; also outlines the myths concerning the foundation of Japan. It describes how Ninigi-no-Mikoto, grandson of Amaterasu and great-grandfather of Emperor Jimmu, descended from heaven to Takachihonomine in Kyūshū and became the progenitor of the Japanese Imperial line.
*The &quot;Nakatsumaki&quot; begins with the conquests of Jimmu, which make him the first Emperor of Japan; and ends with the 15th Emperor, Ōjin. The second through ninth Emperors&#x27; reigns are recorded in a minimum of detail, with only their names, the names of their various descendants, and the locations of their palaces and tombs listed, with no mention of their achievements. Many of the stories in this volume are mythological; the allegedly historical information is highly suspect.
*The &quot;Shimotsumaki&quot; covers the 16th to 33rd Emperors and, unlike previous volumes, has very limited references to interactions with deities. (Such interactions are very prominent in the first and second volumes.) Information about the 24th to 33rd Emperors is scant.

== Synopsis ==
What follows is a condensed summary of the contents of the text, including many of the names of gods, emperors, and locations as well as events which took place in association with them. The original Japanese is included in parentheses where appropriate.

=== Preface () ===
Ō no Yasumaro&#x27;s preface, in the form of a dedicatory address to Empress Genmei, begins with a poem summarizing the main contents of the work. He then relates how Emperor Tenmu commissioned Hieda no Are to memorize the genealogies and records of the imperial house years earlier, and how Genmei in turn ordered Yasumaro to compile a written record of what Are had learned. He finally concludes the preface with a brief explanation of the Chinese characters used to transcribe native Japanese words in the text and the division of the work into three volumes.

<text>Built to Spill is an American indie rock band that formed in Boise, Idaho, in 1992. Centered on lead vocalist and guitarist Doug Martsch, the only permanent member, Built to Spill has released nine albums since its inception.

Martsch originally envisioned the band to feature a changing set of backing musicians for each album, but eventually settled with a stable lineup for over a decade before returning to his original plan in 2012. Having received consistent critical acclaim throughout their career, three of the band&#x27;s albums—&quot;There&#x27;s Nothing Wrong with Love, Perfect from Now On&quot; and &quot;Keep It Like a Secret&quot;—placed in the top 50 of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s Top 100 Albums of the 1990s list. &quot;Keep It Like a Secret&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album to chart on the Billboard 200 in the United States, while their 2009 release &quot;There Is No Enemy&quot; became Built to Spill&#x27;s highest-charting album of their career.

=== Formation, debut and &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing Wrong with Love&quot; (1992–1995) ===
Former Treepeople guitarist/vocalist Doug Martsch formed Built to Spill in 1992 with Brett Netson and Ralf Youtz as the band&#x27;s original members. In an interview with &quot;Spin&quot;, Martsch stated that he intended to change the band&#x27;s lineup for every album, himself being the only permanent member. The band&#x27;s name came from an invented phrase in an exquisite corpse-like game Martsch played with his wife. After the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Ultimate Alternative Wavers&quot;, was released in 1993, Netson and Youtz were replaced by Brett Nelson and Andy Capps for 1994&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing Wrong with Love&quot;. A compilation album called &quot;The Normal Years&quot; followed, which included recordings by both lineups. &quot;Built to Spill Caustic Resin&quot;, an EP that features Martsch with the members of Caustic Resin, was released in 1995. Between recording albums in 1995, the band gained exposure by playing on the Lollapalooza tour. Also in 1995, the band collaborated on the song &quot;Still Flat&quot; for the AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Bothered&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization.

=== First Warner Bros. period (1995–2002) ===
Martsch signed Built to Spill to Warner Bros. Records in 1995 for a three-album deal. Unlike many artists signed to major labels, the deal the band brokered with Warner Bros. allowed it to retain a large degree of creative control over future albums. Built to Spill produced its first major-label release in 1997 with &quot;Perfect from Now On&quot;. By this time, the band consisted of Martsch, Nelson, Netson, and Scott Plouf. &quot;Perfect from Now On&quot; was met with critical success and caused Built to Spill to become one of the United States&#x27; most recognizable indie rock bands. Before releasing another album, Martsch made Nelson and Plouf permanent members of the band. In 1999, the band released &quot;Keep It Like a Secret&quot; to continued critical success and for the first time, significant commercial success; it debuted at No. 120 on the Billboard 200 and a year after its release had sold 60,000 copies. The band&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Live&quot; was released in 2000. By 2001, the band&#x27;s three albums for Warner Bros. had sold a combined 200,000 copies in the US. The band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Ancient Melodies of the Future&quot;, was released in 2001.

In 2002, Martsch released &quot;Now You Know&quot;, a solo album with both blues and folk elements. He performed numerous solo concerts in support of the album. Built to Spill was on hiatus for most of this period.

=== Second Warner Bros. period (2002–2017) ===
In 2003, Warner Bros. Records optioned the band for another album. From 2003 to 2005, Built to Spill toured extensively, performing over 150 dates that included new songs from as early as 2004. Its sixth studio album, &quot;You in Reverse&quot;, was recorded in Portland in 2004 but was not released until April 11, 2006. The band&#x27;s official lineup for the album was Martsch, Nelson, Plouf, and Jim Roth, who was formerly only a touring guitarist. Brett Netson provided guitar work on several songs and later rejoined the band as a full-time member.

After the release of &quot;You in Reverse&quot;, Built to Spill continued touring almost non-stop. In March 2006, Martsch suffered a detached retina, which required surgery. This forced the band to miss an appearance at the South by Southwest music festival and postpone several dates of the tour. Even worse news came when former drummer Andy Capps was found dead in his home on May 18, 2006.

The band resumed touring on June 3, 2006, with a show that included four new songs. This show and many on the tour included the dedication of the song &quot;Car&quot; to Capps, who had played on the track when it was recorded.

Warner Bros. Records stated that Built to Spill had been recording its follow-up to &quot;You in Reverse&quot; on and off during the 2006 tour, but nothing appeared until the July 10, 2007 release of a 12&quot; single, &quot;They Got Away&quot;/&quot;Re-Arrange&quot;. &quot;They Got Away&quot; is a heavily reggae-influenced original song, while &quot;Re-Arrange&quot; is a cover of a song by the reggae band the Gladiators.The US tour was scheduled through October 2007, followed by an Australian tour. Martsch stated in a September 2007 interview that he didn&#x27;t want to tour in the United States again until the band records; however, the band then announced a one-month US national tour for spring of 2008.

In a March 2008 interview with Playback:stl, Martsch spoke of new material from the Halo Benders, a collaboration between Martsch, Calvin Johnson, Steve Fisk, former Treepeople member Wayne &quot;Rhino&quot; Flower, and original Built to Spill drummer Ralf Youtz, but &quot;we started that about a year ago, we have not even got anything off the ground.&quot; Later in the interview, Martsch gave his perspective on the future of Built to Spill past the current material; &quot;I do think that Built to Spill could be something better than ever just because our lineup is better than ever ... I think there is potential for the five of us to collaborate on something that is just way better than anything that I have ever come up with by myself or that we have done in the past.&quot; Martsch also interjected that &quot;This coming record we&#x27;re not doing that—it&#x27;s mostly going to be songs that I have been working on.&quot; The band extended its 2008 tour in the United States and Europe, performing the album &quot;Perfect from Now On&quot; in its entirety.

In 2009, the band announced its next album, &quot;There Is No Enemy&quot;. The tracklist and album art were revealed on August 17, 2009, the first single, &quot;Hindsight&quot;, was released on September 8, and the album was released on October 6, 2009. The band toured from August through November 2009 and for much of 2010, including performances at the Pitchfork Music Festival and the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival, curated by &quot;The Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening.

In July 2010, Martsch appeared on the first release from Brett Nelson&#x27;s the Electric Anthology Project, in which Nelson creates covers from an artist in a synth-pop style, featuring the vocalist from the original version. This self-titled EP, which featured one song from each Built to Spill record (using anagrams of their original titles) and newly recorded vocals by Doug Martsch, received a moderately favorable review in Pitchfork, even though &quot;it was obviously released as a goof,&quot; and the &quot;good moments almost make you wish Martsch had taken this concept more seriously.&quot; In September 2010, the band released a video for its single &quot;Hindsight&quot; from &quot;There Is No Enemy&quot;, directed by Bob Odenkirk.

On October 25, 2012, Built to Spill played a secret, invitation-only show at the Bunk Bar in Portland, Oregon, with a new rhythm section consisting of Jason Albertini (Helvetia, Duster) on bass and Stephen Gere (Uzala, Brett Netson Band, Atomic Mama) on drums. On January 7, 2013, Martsch, Netson and guitarist Jim Roth announced that Albertini and Gere would be permanent replacements for Plouf and Nelson, who were departing the band amicably. Built to Spill continued touring periodically as a five-piece but didn&#x27;t release another album for several years. Martsch would later state that a 2012 album was abandoned due to the departure of Nelson and Plouf and his dissatisfaction with the songs.

&quot;Untethered Moon&quot; was released on April 18, 2015. The album was recorded as a trio with Martsch, Albertini, and Gere and was co-produced by Martsch and frequent Built to Spill guest keyboardist and Quasi frontman Sam Coomes. The band toured summer/fall 2015 in support of the new album.

Brett Netson and Jim Roth left the band in the latter half of 2015 and a trio lineup of Martsch, Albertini and Gere debuted on a spring 2016 West Coast run.

=== Post-Warner Bros. years (2017–present) ===

On September 14, 2017, Built to Spill announced that they would leave Warner Bros. after 22 years.

In October 2018, Martsch announced on Facebook that the band will return to his initial idea of having a shifting rotation of members for each release. Brazilian musicians João Casaes and Lê Almeida served as the rhythm section for a set of South American shows. In 2019, the band added Melanie Radford on bass and Teresa Esguerra on drums. On June 12, 2020, they released the cover album &quot;Built to Spill Plays the Songs of Daniel Johnston&quot;.

The band signed to Sub Pop in October 2021. On September 9, 2022, the band released their first album of new material since 2015, &quot;When the Wind Forgets Your Name&quot;. The album was recorded with Casaes and Almeida on rhythm prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, they announced a 30th anniversary tour for &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing Wrong With Love,&quot; which started in August, during which the album was performed in full each night.

==Musical style==
Built to Spill are generally labeled as an indie rock band. Tim Sendra of AllMusic named Built to Spill &quot;one of the most popular and influential indie rock bands&quot;, and noted the band&#x27;s stylistic evolution from &quot;sparse lo-fi&quot; early in their career towards a sound described as &quot;sophisticated emo&quot; later on. He further described the band&#x27;s sound as an intermixture of &quot;postmodern, Pavement-style pop&quot; and the &quot;loose, spacious jamming&quot; associated with the likes of Neil Young.

Built to Spill&#x27;s work has been said to have been an influence on alternative rock acts such as Modest Mouse and Death Cab for Cutie.
